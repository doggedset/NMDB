Please stay tuned for updates![/color]\r\n\r\n[b]05.13.12:[/b] A new version of the mod is now available.  This fixes the issue with Apple Pies being named Meat Pies.\r\n\r\n[b]05.09.12:[/b] [b]RH Whole Foods[/b] is now available for download!  Please try it out and leave feedback in the comments or send me a PM!\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]OVERVIEW[/u]\r\nAs much fun as it is to delve into dungeons and slay dragons - or just pickpocket everybody in town without getting caught - there is a simple pleasure to a nice, home cooked meal.  At the end of the day, even the Dovahkiin needs a bite to eat now and again.\r\n\r\n[b]Rogue Hallow\\'s Whole Foods[/b] adds recipes for some existing foods that don\\'t already have them, and adds a handful of recipes for new foods as well.  In addition, it distinguishes soups by giving them distinct textures - no more mixing up your Cabbage Apple Soup and Horker Stew.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]WHAT IT DOES[/u]\r\n* Allows cooking of Bread, Pies, Sweet Rolls, Baked Potatoes, Grilled Leeks, Cabbage Soup, and Seared Slaughterfish\r\n* Adds Imperial and Skyrim Clam Chowder, Chicken Soup, and Beef Pie recipes\r\n* Gives distinctive textures to most individual soups and stews\r\n* Raises the Bread health effect from +2 to +5\r\n* Slaughterfish now drop raw meat\r\n* Places honey in bee hives and vendor inventories, and reduces the size of its model\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]NEW RECIPES[/u]\r\n-Cabbage Soup-\r\nOnly one sample of this soup could be found in the original game.  It can now be cooked at the cooking pot.\r\nIngredients: cabbage, garlic, leek, salt\r\nEffects: Stamina +10, Health +10\r\n\r\n-Skyrim Clam Chowder-\r\nA traditional soup of the Skyrim coastal regions.\r\nIngredients: clam, garlic, potato, salt\r\nEffects: Fortify Stamina 25 for 720 seconds, Health +15, Restore Health 1/second over 720 seconds\r\n\r\n-Imperial Clam Chowder-\r\nA newer take on the classic chowder, created by Imperial settlers and generally frowned at by native Nords.\r\nIngredients: clam, garlic, tomato, salt\r\nEffects: Stamina +15, Fortify Health 25 for 720 seconds, Restore Health 1/second over 720 seconds\r\n\r\n-Chicken Soup-\r\nThis famous healthful dish is now available to all slayers of dragons... and chickens.\r\nIngredients: chicken, carrot, leek, salt\r\nEffects: Stamina +15, Health +15, Restore Health 1/second over 720 seconds\r\n\r\n-Apple Pie-\r\nPies may now be cooked at the cooking pot!\r\nIngredients: green apple, red apple, wheat, salt\r\nEffects: Health +10\r\n\r\n-Beef Pie-\r\nA savory pie made with beef and carrots.\r\nIngredients: beef, carrots, wheat, salt\r\nEffects: Stamina +15, Health +15\r\n\r\n-Bread-\r\nMake fresh bread at any cooking pot.\r\nIngredients: wheat, salt\r\nEffects: Health +5\r\n\r\n-Sweet Roll-\r\nIf someone steals your sweet roll, just make another!\r\nIngredients: wheat, honey\r\nEffects: Health +5\r\n\r\n-Baked Potatoes-\r\nHot potatoes in the comfort of your own home.\r\nIngredients: potatoes, salt\r\nEffects: Health +5\r\n\r\n-Grilled Leeks-\r\nThey\\'re tough to keep on a plate, but they restore an extra point of health.\r\nIngredients: leeks, salt\r\nEffects: Health +6\r\n\r\n-Seared Slaughterfish-\r\nA slaughterfish bit you while you were swimming?  Bite it back.\r\nIngredients: slaughterfish meat, salt\r\nEffects: Health +5\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]KNOWN ISSUES AND CONFLICTS[/u]\r\n[b]Whole Foods[/b] should only conflict with mods that change soups and stews, extensively alter recipes, or edit the Inn Common Foods leveled list.\r\n\r\nThe Elsweyr Fondue texture needs slight adjustment to remove a minor graphical glitch.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not sure if anyone else is getting this, but my Apple Pie has been inexplicably renamed to Meat Pie.  I\\'m looking into it. [color=green](FIXED: Pies are now Applie Pies as they should be.  During the Burning of Olaf in Solitude, Sorex will give you a Beef Pie after offering you \\\"a free meat pie\\\")[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]FUTURE PLANS[/u]\r\n* Continue adding recipes and new food per user suggestions\r\n\r\n* Possibly make compatible versions for other mods, again, depending on user input\r\n\r\n* Create a version of the mod where wheat can be ground into flour, then used in recipes\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]OTHER MODS BY ROGUE HALLOW[/u]\r\n[color=yellow]Skyrim[/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16194]RH Psijic Archmage Robes Switcher[/url]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]Fallout 3[/color]\r\n[url=http://fallout3.nexusmods.com/mods/6938]RH IronSights[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=15883]RH New Weapon Animations[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=15858]RH New Races[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]LEGAL & CREDITS[/u]\r\nMod created by Rogue Hallow\r\n\r\nPrograms used:\r\nCreation Kit\r\nNifSkope\r\nG.I.M.P.\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\nBethesda and the makers of [i]Skyrim[/i]\r\nThe creators and maintainers of the Skyrim Nexus\r\n\r\nPlease do not use this mod in your own mod or upload it to any site but the Nexus without the express permission of its author, Rogue Hallow.\r\n\r\nNo assets from any other game were used in the making of this mod.",
