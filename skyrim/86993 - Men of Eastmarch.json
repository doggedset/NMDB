  "summary": "Appearance overhaul of several male NPC&#39;s in Windhelm and surrounding areas.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]This mod changes the appearance of several male NPC&#39;s in Eastmarch.   The changes mostly include removal of dirt and discolorations, sometimes wrinkles and adding hair for the gents over 50 because not all men at that age are bald.  Scars were left alone.  Age appearance may vary depending on the skin textures you use, so I&#39;ve included some comparisons with Better Males and Skysight.  NPC&#39;s included here are:\r<br />\r<br />Ulfric - mostly a smaller nose\r<br />Jorleif - removed his silly hat\r<br />Angrenor Once-Honored - Why is a former soldier walking the cold streets of Windhelm in prisoner rags? His former brothers and sisters in arms scraped together and bought him some warm gear.  He is now wearing scaled armor.   Also, because he uses a rare marriage voice type, I removed his forehead wrinkles. This was a personal choice to keep my marriage options open.\r<br />Oengul the blacksmith\r<br />Brunwulf Free-Winter\r<br />Adonato Leotelli\r<br />Torbjorn Shatter-Shield\r<br />Torsten Cruel-Sea\r<br />Kjeld in Kynesgrove - Fixed his overbite mouth.  That bugged me for a long time.\r<br />Kjeld the Younger \r<br />Verner in Darkwater because Annekke deserves better\r<br />\r<br />This doesn&#39;t include elves as I thought they looked fine with EEO.  Other males not included I thought already looked fine or are included in another overhaul I use.  This was made for my personal use.  If you don&#39;t like a certain NPC, you can remove them in TES5Edit.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Additional Mods Used in Images:\r<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69784/?http://]Rustic Clothing[/url] by Gamwich\r<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24909/]Amidianborn Book of Silence[/url] by Cabal\r<br />Better Males (NSFW) by Chris57\r<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58443/?]Skysight Skins[/url] by Fadingsignal\r<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41482/?]Rudy ENB[/url] by Rudy102\r<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4307/?]AOF Believable Hair[/url] by AnOldFriend\r<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41482/?]\r<br />\r<br />[/url][/size][/size]\r<br />\r<br />",
