My companions will never be up for download, questions about them will not be answered anymore. Learn to make you\\'re own unique characters, I find that\\'s better then receiving one. Please don\\'t demand anything from me, I\\'m not obligated to do anything for anyone. I do this because I enjoy it and I share it because I love the community. Thank you.)\r\n--------------------------\r\nDescription: (For the love of all that is good, please read it!!)\r\n\r\nX\\'D Hello Hello!! \r\n\r\nYou do not need to install his armor. This works on it\\'s own and does not replace anything. \r\n\r\nThe inspiration for this armor came from the amazing npc outfits from Assassins Creed Revelations xD. I loved the clothing style so much that I wanted to make a similar look for my follower. \r\n\r\nCan be crafted at the forge under leather. Is light armor. Clothing version can be crafted at the tanning rack under leather. \r\n\r\nNow for Men and Women. Comes with a scarf, hood, two different types of armor, and 6 different colors. Works for Khajiits and Argonians. But might be some slight clipping with the Hood. \r\n\r\nAnd for the females a hoods with hairs version of the Regal Assassin Hood have been added. Comes in many color variations that can be crafted at the forge under leather. \r\n\r\nThis is a standalone re-texture of NoseGoblins Assassins, Rangers and Thieves Armor.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4632/\r\n\r\nAnd uses a scarf mesh from Grimoa\\'s awesome Scarf and Gugel Mod::\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17401\r\n\r\nAnd uses Grace Darklings Ranger Armor as a base for the female regal armor.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7184\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to Gambit77, Hoods with hair by zzjay and Grace Darkling have been added.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28147/\r\n\r\nAlso, I recommend this blindfold mod::\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13551\r\n\r\nAs always, Thank you for downloading, and I hope you enjoy!\r\nAnd if you like the armor, be sure to come back and show me some love lol. \r\n\r\n[youtube]9o1kCe3UYaA[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[youtube]lM0DpQB2Qrk[/youtube]\r\n--------------------------\r\nInstallation: \r\n\r\nUse the Nexus Mod Manager to install or\r\n\r\nCopy all content to the Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\nUninstallation: \r\n\r\nRemove the following folders:\r\n\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\DreamBurrow\\\\RegalAssassin\r\nData\\\\meshes\\\\DreamBurrow\\\\RegalAssassin\r\n\r\nOr uninstall using NMM. \r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n\r\nPoor quality, I\\'m still learning a lot about texturing.\r\n\r\nThe cape has transparency applied to it, so it may have some issues like lighting, etc. \r\nSlight clipping on the hoods for Khajiits and Argonians. \r\n\r\nIf you find any more issues, please let me know! \r\n---------------------------\r\nPermissions:\r\nDO NOT upload any of my works with out my expressed permission.
