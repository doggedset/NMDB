  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Even more spells are available in Forbidden Magic: Spell Pack 2! Get it [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33867]here![/url] \r\nThis mod is also available on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=127929820]Steam Workshop![/url][/b]\r\nv. 1.3.5\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<<XXoXX>>------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOVERVIEW:\r\n\r\nFinally finished! This was definitely a fun mod to make and it\\'s given me lots of ideas for Forbidden Magic Spell Pack 2. I want to give a HUGE thanks to everyone who has and will endorse, comment, and download this mod. I make mods for you guys, so it\\'s always awesome when I get to hear from you! \r\n\r\nThe goal of this mod series is to add unique spells and powers to Skyrim, while still staying lore-friendly and balanced. Each spell pack contains 10 spells and powers. The content of each pack is largely influenced by your suggestions -- so speak up! If there\\'s something you want added, changed, balanced, or just plain deleted, tell me! \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<<XXoXX>>------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSPELLS, EFFECTS, AND TOME LOCATIONS:\r\n\r\nAll spell tomes can be found in Dragonsreach, first room on your right, on Farengar\\'s table next to the white shelf. \r\n\r\nFlare: A powerful fireball that flings back targets in a very satisfying way :D \r\n\r\nDark Blast: A sinister spell that deals damage and absorbs the target\\'s soul when it dies. \r\n\r\nMutagen: A toxic blast that does damage instantly and a little bit of damage over time. The more the spell is used on the same target, the more powerful the damage over time gets. \r\n\r\nIntense Lightning: A really sexy blast of lightning that sends enemies flying. \r\n\r\nKiller Bees: I hate bugs. I hate needles. Bees are freakin\\' FLYING BUG-NEEDLES!!! Basically a spray type spell, like Flames. But with flying bug needles. \r\n\r\nLight Beam: If you took a big magnifying glass and taped it to your hand on a sunny day, then found a bunch of ants... and then you took out a flamethrower... Well, this is nothing like that. It does do extra damage to undead, though! :D \r\n\r\nSpatial Distortion: Paralyzes and throws back enemies, AND makes a pretty little swirly thingy! \r\n\r\nSummon Ghostly Steed: Summons a spectral horse with awesome glowy red eyes. He is 75% faster than normal vanilla horses and can\\'t die. \r\n\r\nCataclysm: Don\\'t you want to be like Alduin, shooting meteors all over the place and just basking in the chaos and destruction? Well now you can! Introducing Cataclysm; the ultimate spell! It can be yours, for only $19.99! Haha! Got you, didn\\'t I? I\\'d never charge you guys $19.99 for a spell... It\\'s actually $99.99 :P \r\n\r\nWaterstriding: A spell that gives the caster the ability to walk on water! Marvelous!\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<<XXoXX>>------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG:\r\n\r\nv1.3.5 \r\n-Added all spells to their respective leveled lists, so they can now be found in loot from monsters, chests, etc. \r\n-Fixed a typo in the Summon Ghostly Steed spell effect that could possibly cause some small bugs. \r\n\r\nv1.3.2 \r\n-Moved the tomes back to the table next to Farengar because Farengar sometimes refuses to sell the spells. They are free now, but must be stolen. \r\n\r\nv1.3.1 \r\n-Fixed a glitch causing Farengar not to sell the spells to the player. \r\n\r\nv1.3 \r\n-Removed all spells from Dragonsreach and gave them to Farengar so he could sell them. \r\n-Made Cataclysm much less expensive. \r\n-Made Waterstriding a spell with a set duration instead of a concentration spell, so now you have both hands free and can not only walk, but also sprint across water. \r\n-Minor tweaks and bug fixes. \r\n\r\nv1.2 \r\n-Added a hit effect to the Dark Blast spell. Now the target will turn red when they are hit with it. \r\n-Changed Intense Lightning into a Master level spell. \r\n\r\nv1.1 \r\n-Changed Mutagen into a Destruction spell because it was wierd when it was an Alteration spell. \r\n-Decreased the Magicka costs of a few spells. Mostly Intense Lightning and Summon Ghostly Steed.\r\n-Gave Mutagen a new impact effect. \r\n-Fixed a glitch causing Spatial Distortion to heal enemies. \r\n-Fixed a glitch preventing Dark Blast from absorbing souls. \r\n-Replaced Dragonborn\\'s Rage with the Waterstriding spell. \r\n-Changed Mutagen\\'s sound effects a bit. \r\n-Fixed a glitch causing enemies to go flying when killed by Mutagen\\'s damage over time effect. \r\n-Corrected a stupid mistake on my part that sometimes prevented spells from being affected by relevant perks. \r\n\r\nv1.0 \r\n-Gave Dark Blast a more appropriate sound effect. \r\n-Fixed nearly all compatibility issues -- nearly all. \r\n-Fixed Spatial Distortion\\'s decal wanting to stay on the ground. \r\n-Changed spells to higher tiers. \r\n-Changed the visuals for Spatial Distortion, Flare, and Light Beam, and removed the damage effect from Spatial Distortion. \r\n-Moved all tomes to Dragonsreach. \r\n-Balanced out spells\\' magicka costs. \r\n-Changed Dark Blast from Conjuration to Destruction. \r\n-Added the Cataclysm tome and spell, and the Dragonborn\\'s Rage power. \r\n\r\nv0.8 \r\n-Added the Ghostly Steed npc, spell tome, and summon spell.",
