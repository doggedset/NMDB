It improves the alchemy room, it has lore friendly paintings, adds a desk, a fireplace, New types of weapon displays like an anvil, antlers, wood plaque and skeleton hands. Woodchoping area in back, adds a blacksmith shop out front. Re-done Lydia\\'s room but did not touch Lydia herself. Adds balconies with doors, lots of idle markers for companions and more. This mod has been cleaned with Tes5Edit and tested with 200+mods!\r\nGoes prefect with my other two Breezehome mods...... http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23317 .....http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23415\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ffff00][b]Details[/b][/color][/size]\r\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img706/6389/thanesbreezehomeadditio.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ffff00][b]Installation[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n1. This should work fine with NMM.\r\n2. Manual download- Extract the files to a temporary location. Copy the files to \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\ or steam steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ffff00][b]Uninstall[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n1. Remove all your stuff out of Thanes Breezehome Additions II. Then, in data files, Uncheck and delete.\r\nIf you need to delete everything that came with this mod then do this.... examine the contents of the whole mod folder and delete all\r\nthe corresponding files.\r\n2. Or use Nexusmodmanager\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ffff00][b]Compatibility[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nI wouldn\\'t go using this with any other breezehome mods unless it\\'s just a basement or something simple like that! I have a good basement mod if you want to use mine....\r\nMy other two breezehome mods were kinda meant to go with this one but not necessary, here\\'s the links..... http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23317 .....http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23415\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ffff00][b]Issues or Bugs[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nI\\'ve noticed some mods accidentally move or touch things in breezehome which will cause items to be there that aren\\'t supposed to be there like extra carpet for example. There are several ways to go about removing them...First is TES5Edit, or CK or you can simply disable them in game by going into first person mode, then opening console and clicking the item you want to disable then type \\\"Disable\\\" if you disable the wrong thing you just type Enable to bring it back.\r\n\r\nOne mod that does this is \\\"Regent Armory\\\" he accidentally moved the fire and one of the carpets, he just needs to clean his mod then re-release it.\r\nthere is one other mod that I have that messes with the fire in breezehome but I have not found which one yet.\r\n\r\nThis is not compatible with Hearthfire but here is a fix http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27053/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D27053\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ffff00][b]Authors Notes[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n1. Don\\'t forget to add this line \\\"iLargeIntRefCount=999999\\\" without quotes to your Skyrim.ini under the \\\"General\\\" tab located in documents/My Games/Skyrim/Skyrim.ini or you will CTD, all this does is allow more items to be in a cell than normally allowed, it does not hurt or effect your game in any way. Don\\'t forget to save!\r\n\r\n2.
