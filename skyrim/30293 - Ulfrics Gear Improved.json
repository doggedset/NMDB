In the process deciding to change the Robes and Boots, since Ulfric fights in them and lives(?) then why cant you?\r\n\r\n-Glass equivalent was chosen for best compatibility with increased difficulty settings/mods, and with the mindset that there is a pretty long quest line and lots of work and fighting before you obtain the gear, so it seems justifiable for them to be worthy!\r\n\r\n*See File Section for exact BASE (<--keyword) Armor Rating. I believe it is a good starting point, much better than Vanilla default #\\'s, and with all the options to increase they can become VERY powerful Armor pieces if you so choose! Between smithing & smithing skill level, smithing buffs on gear, smithing buff potions, Glass Smithing perk, Light Armor perks and even Fortify Light Armor buffs the potential is there for some great setups!*\r\n\r\n-Screenshots show Armor #\\'s on a character with all Light Armor perks that increase Armor rating, 5/5 Agile Defender, 1/1 Custom Fit, 1/1 Matching Set.\r\n*Note on Perks - Since there are only 3 pieces to this set Custom Fit perk (25% Armor bonus if wearing all Light Armor: head, chest, hands, feet.) will apply when combined with any Light Armor Helm. Matching Set perk (Additional 25% Armor bonus if wearing a matched set of Light Armor) will ONLY apply if wearing the Armor variant your using corresponding Helm, Glass Helmet for Glass Variant users, and Elven Helmet for Elven Variant users.\r\n====================================================\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\n-Simple download with Manager and Activate. Load order should be after any mod that changes Ulfrics Gear, like Armor Compilations. I will submit to BOSS right away, for those that prefer it, but it may take a couple days to be added.\r\n-Manual install just extract the .esp to your Data folder and activate in whatever launcher you use, same as above make sure in the load order you place this after anything that alters Ulfrics gear.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY/LOAD ORDER:\r\n\r\n-There should be no conflicts with this and other mods other than any mod that changes or alters Ulfrics gear, specifically, \\\"ClothesUlfric\\\" \\\"ClothesUlfricBoots\\\" or \\\"ClothesUlfricGauntlets\\\". Though to be honest I cant imagine why someone would consider using this if they already have a mod that changes Ulfrics gear. Only things I can think of off the top of my head would be a large type of Armor Collection, though I believe most of those are \\\"StandAlone\\\" style and would not conflict with a direct \\\"Replacer\\\" style like this.\r\n\r\n-That being said load order can pretty much be anywhere, unless you are running a mod you know or think alters Ulfrics gear, in which case load this after that just to be safe. That way the worst case scenario would be a simple \\\"override\\\" situation rather than a dreaded CTD! I will submit to BOSS right away, so those that want to use it will be all set, though it may take a few days to be added to the Master List. As always if in doubt, closest to last as possible!\r\n\r\n====================================================\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\n-Deactivate with NMM.\r\n-Manual install deactivate .esp in launcher and delete from Data folder.\r\n\r\n-If items are on person during Install or Uninstall it is fine.***\r\n\r\n====================================================\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\nMY OTHER MODS:\r\n\r\nSkyrim Shadow Striping Fix - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27418/\r\n\r\nBreezehome Shadow Striping Fix - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27051\r\n\r\n====================================================\r\nIf for some reason someone wants to use this in any way I have no problem as long as I am made aware first and properly credited!",
