  "descriptionHtml": "Although I have made mods in the past, this is my first time posting a mod on nexus. I have seen requests for a mod like this but I have not found one. \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;The idea of this mod is to add to the roleplaying of the game in that it adds a NPC dovahkin character to the game. Currently he does not do much but I intend on adding features and eventually having him wander skyrim slaying dragons, fighting bandits, and eventually completing the main quest while you do other non-dovahkin things. \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;These mods aren&#39;t required but they will help the experience greatly: (If you don&#39;t use them there will be 2 dovahkins and that is just wierd)\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/?]Alternate start - Live Another Life[/url] by: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/684492/?]Arthmoor[/url]\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9048/?]You are not the Dragonborn[/url] by: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/164068/?]frodone[/url]\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;THIS MOD IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS...PLEASE BE PATIENT.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to give me suggestions or critiques.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Twitter:\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;@Skr3b\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;",
