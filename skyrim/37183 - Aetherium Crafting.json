  "descriptionHtml": "Have your ever wanted to craft more than just the three original Aetherium items? Then this mod is for you! \r\n\r\nThis mod allows you to make weapons and armor with Aetherium. You can mine Aetherium in areas like Blackreach and Bthalft. Once you have enough Aetherium, you can smelt the ore into Aetherium Crests, which you can then use to make weapons and armor. There are both enchanted and unenchanted versions of all the items, so you can choose what meets your needs. \r\n\r\nEach item has its own unique, powerful enchantment when it is forged, much like the original Aetherium items that Dawnguard added. You can improve these items with Aetherium ore at the grindstone or workbench. \r\n\r\nThis mod also adds a Dwemer ruin called Buleft in which you can mine large quantities of Aetherium. Its location is show in a screenshot above. \r\n\r\nThis mod is completely lore-friendly. \r\n\r\nTextures were made by HighWarlordBob. Made from the Dwarven item set. \r\n\r\nBUGS: None known. \r\n\r\nPlease notify us of any issues you find with the mod. We welcome suggestions as well. \r\n\r\nThank you for your support. ",
