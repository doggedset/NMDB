All this does is replace the 1st-person view .nif files of Glass armor, with the .nif files of Hide armor.  While this is mostly a \\\"quick\\\" fix, until someone actually modifies the Glass armor .nifs so they display properly, it still looks great.   Look at the images to see the difference!  :)\r\n\r\nThis should work with all Glass armor mods.  I checked out most of them and they don\\'t modify 1st-person view .nif files.",
