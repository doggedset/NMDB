  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]Description:[/u][/b]\r<br />Do you like Glass weapons?  Do you like the Ancient Falmer ivory armour?  Do you wish you had a weapon set that matched the ivory armour?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, you&#39;re in the right place&#33;  Thanks to Calcelmo&#39;s investigations of the ancient Snow Elves, the knowledge of how to smith their weapons has been rediscovered and is quickly spreading across Skyrim.  Thanks to a rather straightforward process involving the tusks of Skyrim&#39;s mammoths and horkers, anyone skilled in Glass smithing can recreate the ivory-infused Glass weapons that were once used by the Snow Elves.\r<br />\r<br />You can forge a full set of Ivory Glass weapons at the forge, as well as arrows.  The Battleaxe, Bow, Greatsword, Mace, Sword, War Axe, and Warhammer require a Mammoth Tusk in addition to the materials used for the regular Glass versions, and the Dagger and Arrows require a Horker Tusk in addition to the regular Glass materials.  All of the weapons have tempering recipes so you can improve them at the grindstone with one Refined Malachite.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Notes:[/u][/b]\r<br />I prefer that my mods be lore-friendly, but in this case there isn&#39;t very much lore to go on.  What little we do know is that the ancient Snow Elves were a highly sophisticated race that rivaled even the Altmer, and were highly skilled in frost-related magic.  The Ancient Falmer armour set is actually named ivory armour in the game&#39;s files, so I figured it made sense to make ivory a crafting requirement for these weapons.  I also really love Glass weapons, which are Elven in origin, so I figured &#34;hey, maybe they infused the Glass with ivory from the tusks of Skyrim&#39;s native creatures.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Now, since Gelebor carries an Elven Mace and the Forgotten Vale is littered with regular Elven weapons, you could argue that they just used those and didn&#39;t have their own style of weapons, but I don&#39;t buy it.  They have unique armour and architecture, but not weapons?  I think that Bethesda, for whatever reason, just used regular Elven weapons out of convenience rather than any lore reason.  Ideally, this would be a totally unique weapon set, but the limitations of my skills mean it&#39;s just a simple retexture.  Hopefully you guys agree with me that the Ancient Falmer needed some weapons of their own.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Requirements:[/u][/b]\r<br />Latest update and Dawnguard.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Compatability:[/b][/u]\r<br />Thanks toÂ [url=../../users/4966917]jynx474[/url], there [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59240/?]are patches available[/url] for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34155/?]Dual Sheath Redux[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39870/?]Better Shaped Weapons[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Installation:[/u][/b]\r<br />--use NMM, or extract the IvoryGlassWeapons.esp and meshes and textures folders to your Skyrim Data folder\r<br />[b][u]Uninstallation:[/u][/b]\r<br />--use NMM, or delete IvoryGlassWeapons.esp and the meshes and textures folders named ivoryglass.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Credits/Programs Used:[/u][/b]\r<br />--[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/247/?]BSAopt[/url]\r<br />--[url=http://www.gimp.org/]Gimp[/url]\r<br />--[url=http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope]NifScope[/url]\r<br />--[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/740/?]Skyrim Retexturing Software Tutorial by David Brasher[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Permissions:[/u][/b]\r<br />If you want to incorporate my mod or its resources in a mod of your own, you may do so provided that you credit me for anything you use.
