  "descriptionHtml": "To put it quite simply I am a fan of the TV show Vikings on the History channel. Some might notice that a common sword that the vikings use looks a lot like the iron sword, so I made this file that does not replace the stats of an iron sword, because that would suck when fighting bandits, but adds a new sword that looks exactly like an Iron Sword but has stats jut a little better than a Daedric Sword. (Deadric Sword=14, Viking Sword=15) I did not however make a crafting recipe so just push the (~/`) key and type (help viking) and the code for it should pop up unless you have other items with the name viking in it. If this happens, just hit (PGUP) until you see Viking Sword.",
