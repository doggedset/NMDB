  "descriptionHtml": "Got rid of the old version altogether and re-uploaded it here.\r<br />This mod adds the Fellowship of the Ring from the Lord of the Rings films as followers to Skyrim. \r<br />You&#39;ll find them around a campfire on the route to High Hrothgar ( just after where you first see that frost troll). \r<br />\r<br />Be sure to let the data files finish updating when starting the game for the first time after downloading and make sure that the mod is active in your load order. \r<br />I wanted to make a complete fellowship mod that really made the characters look like they should. I hope you all enjoy. \r<br />\r<br />They all level with the player and are all essential. \r<br />Voices are just standard vanilla voices. Unfortunately there isn&#39;t an old man voice that works for a follower so Gandalf just has a Nord voice. \r<br />\r<br />If you want them all to follow you at once then use a multi-follower mod such as: \r<br />\r<br />UFO from Nexus- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037//? \r<br />\r<br />Credits: Ear models by nouserhere from Skyrim Nexus. \r<br />Cloaks by Nikinoodles from Skyrim Nexus",
