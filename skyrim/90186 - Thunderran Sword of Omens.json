  "descriptionHtml": "This was quite literally the first thing I EVER modeled or textured. I created this a couple of years ago and stuck it up on the steam workshop; no idea why I never put it up on here (possibly effort at the time)\n<br />\n<br />Anyhoo as it's now  a couple of years old and last year I updated it so it could go into special edition I figured I should probably get off my arse and upload it on here\n<br />\n<br />The file is still way big for a weapon, the size of the textures is to blame for that. I'm not planning on updating this pack again though so enjoy the gloriously over-engineered, hi-res plethora of texture files\n<br />\n<br />you can craft this in the forge, its cunningly hidden under iron although you need 2 steel ignots, 1 silver ignot and a ruby to craft it",
