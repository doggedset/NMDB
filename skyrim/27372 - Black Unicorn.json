I highly recommend Convenient Horses mod in addition to this, as it allows customization to this basic model for player\\'s tastes.\r\n\r\nBlack Unicorn does not need to be purchased, it comes essential and configured with a standard speed, and should be the player\\'s level. \r\n\r\nLocation: Riverwood gate if you\\'re coming from the beginning area, he is located to the right by the campsite.",
