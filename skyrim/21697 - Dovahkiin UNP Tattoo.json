  "descriptionHtml": "Thought I would throw up the tattoo skin I personally use, thought someone may enjoy it. The lettering on her side is dragon script for Dovahkiin. Uses the latest texture file from Dimon\\'s UNP.\r\n\r\nFor best results install a custom race or use the custom races mod or every female in game will have it, and that just kind of ruins it.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s NMM or Wrye bash ready, but again I would recommend a manual install into a custom race. Just overwrite the femalebody_1.dds with this one.\r\n\r\nCredit goes to Dimon99 and his UNP Body. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709[/url]",
