  "descriptionHtml": "Replaces Fus Roh Dah with Fah Que Doosh. Just a fun little replacement mod that I made when my gf told me about a dream she had where she was using fah que! as a shout. She provided the voice for the shout as well. Check the video section for the preview!\r\n\r\nTHIS MODS ONLY THE FEMALE FUS RO DAH SHOUT\r\n\r\nTo install, just extract the sound folder to skyrim/data.\r\nTo Uninstall delete it.\r\n\r\nUse Nexus Mod Manager its great!\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks goes to Lurtzello the maker of \\\"This is Sparta\\\" and \\\"Firin Mah Lazer\\\" shout replacements. Without those mods to look at I never would have figured out the proper way to name and splice the sound files. \r\n\r\nI used xWMAEncode for making the xwm files as well as fuz_extractor to make the fuz files. \r\n\r\nThis Is Sparta by Lurtzello - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1294\r\nVoice file extractor by Agnahim - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=950\r\n",
