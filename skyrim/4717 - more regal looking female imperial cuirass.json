  "descriptionHtml": "Here goes, first Mod!\r\n\r\nBasically  simple retexture of the heavy imperial female cuirass, which adds gold to a few bits. :)\r\n\r\nIt\\'s sort of like General tullius\\', but not quite that high. Lieutenant level perhaps.\r\n\r\n(if anyone has the knowledge to perhaps create this rank as a craftable and keep the original...)\r\n\r\n1.1\r\n- Added male version with more detail, namely embossing on the skirt and a \\\"skyrim division\\\" brand on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nDownload and extract file to anywhere on your computer (desktop e.g.)\r\ncopy file to skyrim/data folder   (usually steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data\r\ncreate a new folder and call it textures. Inside this folder create a new folder and call it armor. \r\ninside armor, create new folder called imperial. Inside this create new folder called f. then copy the cuirass.dds that you extracted into this folder.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n\r\nDelete the folder you created in skyrim data (make sure if you have any other skyrim texture mods installed, you only delete the cuirass.dds file especially if you have other imperial armor mods installed.)\r\n\r\nGirl in pics...http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4423\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\n",
