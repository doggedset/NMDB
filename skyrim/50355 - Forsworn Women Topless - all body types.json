  "modName": "Forsworn Women Topless - all body types",
  "summary": "A small texture trick to remove some parts of female Forsworn Armor.\r<br />I consider this to be lore-friendly, since Forsworn are savages and their armor cover very little by design.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod was inspired by UNP Forsworn Topless. I&#39;ve stumbled upon some issues with it and decided to do everything from scratch. Then I found out, that it will work with any body model, not only UNP.\r<br />\r<br />So here it is - my mod will work with any body (UNP, CBBE, CBBE+Bodyslide, any other you can think of). It will even work with vanilla body. The only thing is - vanilla body texture has no nipples so it looks stupid... If you prefer to stay with vanilla armor meshes, I recommend UNP body texture. See screenshot, you&#39;ll know why. Also you can use armor mesh replacer of your choice, so far I know about UNP Female Armors by Exeter and CBBE Vanilla Armors by Caliente. From those 2 I also recommend UNP version, since it has nipples modeled. But my mod will work with any armor mesh there is, so feel free to experiment.",
