  "summary": "When Bethesda released the 1.9 patch, it was met with great controversy - for one of the bugfixes was \\\"Fixed rare instance of couriers who would appear only dressed in a hat\\\". Fans everywhere were outraged. Now cheesybob1 has heard fan\\'s cries.\r\nNow with naked Jarls too.",
  "descriptionHtml": "9/6/13 - Added Jarl version. See Ulfric Stormcloak charge into battle wearing a chef hat! Watch as General Tullius shows off his manliness by bravely attacking enemies in the nuddy! (In Skyrim, the nuddy means wearing those glued-on pants of course)\r\n\r\nWhen Bethesda released the 1.9 patch, it was met with great controversy - for one of the bugfixes was \\\"Fixed rare instance of couriers who would appear only dressed in a hat\\\". Fans everywhere were outraged. No more could they be greeted by a courier wearing underpants. No more could they see the manliness of couriers. Now cheesybob1 has heard fan\\'s cries. \r\n\r\nSee couriers in their full masculinity! \r\nWatch as they follow you at night in nothing but a hat! \r\nGaze at their hairy Nord chest! \r\n\r\nThis mod makes all Couriers have no clothes apart from a hat (and underpants of course), \r\nOnly edits the courier npc. Compatability should not be an issue. \r\n\r\nWarning: Not for the faint of heart. These couriers have been trained to be as manly as possible. May cause side effects of manliness.",
