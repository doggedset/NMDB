With all permission I ask would like to ask Caliente for his approval. I take no ownership of the body except the designs in it.\r\n\r\n~~INSTALLATION~~\r\n*!Make sure to make a backup!\r\nPlace in C:/Program files/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Skyrim/Data/Textures/Actors/(and depending on which body of a race you want to change you place it there.",
