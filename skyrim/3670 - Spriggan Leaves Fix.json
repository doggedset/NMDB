  "descriptionHtml": "This isn\\'t necessarily a bug fix as much as it is a solution to an annoying problem I was having.  Somehow I randomly got the Spriggan Leaves particle effect attached to my character and couldn\\'t get rid of them so I made a quick re-texture of the particles and now they\\'re transparent.  The only problem is they are transparent on the Spriggans as well but if you have this glitch/bug then you know the effect being invisible on the spriggans is a minor aesthetic problem.  I also included a video to help with any questions.  Install the files to:\r\n\r\nC/Progarm Files/Steam/SteamApps/Commom/Skyrim/Data\r\n\r\nOr wherever you have Skyrim installed on your computer.  Hopefully this helps anyone with this problem.  Thanks.\r\n",
