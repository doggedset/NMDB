  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple bear Follower that I have made by following a tutorial on Youtube.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\nI\\'m a noob and forgot to include Scripts. so new version have script included\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bear is named Snorri and he is found near the Talos Statue just south west of Windhelm.\r\nI created him bracers made with parts of Steel boots, which is useful to identify him. They may clip a bit through his paws though in certain positions.\r\nArmor on the bracers is 20, and they have no enchantment.\r\n\r\nThe file was zipped using 7-zip 9.20\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nExtract the files and copy the Meshe and Scripts folders and BearFollower.esp to: \r\nSteam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n\r\nIf you want the Essential version of the follower instead, use the esp from Essential folder. \r\n\r\nActivate the ESP with your favorite manager.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, delete BearFollower.esp \r\nand folder: \\\\Data\\\\Meshes\\\\0hai\\\\BearBracers\r\n\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis mod use only modified vanilla Skyrim assets.\r\nSpecial thanks to SpiralDynasty on youtube for his tutorial",
