  "summary": "Modifies two conjuration sounds for the player and all NPCs. Currently \\'cast\\' and \\'portal\\' are changed. A link to LISTEN and compare is in the description. You will definitely notice this when an NPC summons a creature. I think you will like it after you hear it a few times. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "[u]V\\'s Conjuration Sounds[/u]\r\n\r\n[size=1]by Bethesda, and VirusType2 - AKA Vergis, January 1, 2012.[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\nModifies two conjuration sounds for the player and all NPCs. \\'Cast\\' and \\'portal\\' are changed. \r\n\r\n[url=http://soundcloud.com/virustype2/vs-conjure-summon-compare]LIisten and Compare (vanilla plays first, followed by the new sound)[/url]\r\n\r\nI thought vanilla sound is wimpy, harsh, loud, too short, and uninteresting. So I made quite a few tweaks. No offense to the sound designer - as a hobbyist sound effects engineer and musician - he\\'s my hero. \r\n\r\n\r\nI absolutely love it when I fight conjurers! You will definitely notice this, and I hope you will like. \r\n\r\n\r\nI used the bit rate and sample format Bethesda chose, so you don\\'t have to worry about any issues. It actually is synced to the portal better than vanilla. \r\n\r\n\r\nNews:\r\n\r\nJohn Kelly has put up a mod that changes the same two sounds. \r\n\r\nImproved Conjuration Sounds by John Kelly: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6625\r\n\r\nWhile I think my version is much better, you might prefer his version.
