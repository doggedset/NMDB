I would appreciate any advice.\r\n\r\n0.4\r\nSome minor edits. Changed hair and eye color, removed facial hair. Realized I left out a gods damned texture file. Frakkin\\' toasters.\r\n\r\n0.3\r\nFixes Civil War endings to use the new face as well.\r\n\r\n0.2\r\nI think I figured out the coloring issue. \r\nhttp://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/555629-discolored-head/\r\na google always helps :D\r\nLet me know if there are any issues.\r\n\r\n0.1\r\nI didn\\'t change much of his coloring except the purplish eyeshadow that vanilla Tullius had, but he still turned out kinda grayfaced . . . if anyone knows how to fix that let me know!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
