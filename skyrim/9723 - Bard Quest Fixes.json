  "descriptionHtml": "Bard Quest Fixes version 3.0\r<br />by Soltaris\r<br />\r<br />This mod resolves several bugs at the Bard&#39;s College which may occur if you aquire any of the instruments before receiving quests to find them. You&#39;ll now be able to successfully turn in Finn&#39;s Lute, Pantea&#39;s Flute, and Rjorn&#39;s Drum for quest rewards. The dialog with Giraud and Inge has also been updated to no longer display quest options once you&#39;ve turned in their items.\r<br />\r<br />Everything has been updated to the latest version of Skyrim and Creation Kit in 2014.\r<br />\r<br />Install, uninstall, and upgrade instructions are included in the readme.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility: This is not compatible with the Unofficial Skyrim Patch (USKP).  They added a unique way to solve the same issues some months after this mod was released.  My mod is mainly for players who have already encountered one of the bard instrument bugs and need a solution without starting a new game.  It should also appeal to players who want these quests to work correctly without having to install the USKP.\r<br />\r<br />Also available on Steam Workshop: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=12776/]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=12776/[/url]",
