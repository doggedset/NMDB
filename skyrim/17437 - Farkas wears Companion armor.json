  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'ve seen a couple of mods that do this and have even tried my hand at it a few times myself. It\\'s commonly reported that Farkas switches back to Steel armor after the Silver Hand encounter a Dustman\\'s Cairn. \r\n\r\nI found the script that manages that encounter and tried modding that, but he keeps changing to Steel anyway and I cannot figure out why. So, as most people are want to do in desperate times, I resorted to ugly hacks to get it done.\r\n\r\nThere are 18 references to the ArmorSteelNoHelmet outfit in the game. 16 of them have been changed to a newly created ArmorSteelNoHelmetCopy0000 and the original has been modified to contain Wolf armor pieces. \r\n\r\nThis has been tested up to Dustman\\'s Cairn and is confirmed working. \r\n\r\n",
