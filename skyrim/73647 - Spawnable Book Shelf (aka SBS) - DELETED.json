game:[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />[spoiler]You will see 2 new items added to your Inventory under the Misc tab:\r<br />Spawnable Book Shelf 11\r<br />Spawnable Book Shelf 18\r<br />\r<br />Dorp one of the Spawnable Book Shelf misc items from your inventory and your inventory will close and you&#39;ll see a book self marker in front of you at your feet.\r<br />(The Spawnable Book Shelf misc item you dropped will be returned back to your inventory)\r<br />\r<br />Move the marker to where you want (Read section further down or check the SBS MCM menu to understand what keys are used to move it)\r<br />\r<br />When you have the marker where you want press your Activate key.\r<br />The marker will disappear and the shelf will now be ready to be used just like any other book shelf.[/spoiler]\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][u]Keys and Movement:[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />There are only 3 configurable keys, the rest of the keys are based on your native in game keys.\r<br />At anytime you can look in the SBS MCM menu to see what keys are and do.\r<br />While you have a Book Shelf selected you will be snapped to first person view and won&#39;t be able to draw weapons/spells, access inventory/map or activate objects until you Unselect the book shelf.\r<br />You can still freely move about (eg: sprint, jump, sneak) and access the System/MCM menu while a book shelf is selected.\r<br />To make it so you can use most of your native game keys I have used Left Attack/Block and Right Attack/Block as modifier keys.\r<br />While a book shelf is selected and your holding a modifier key you can use your movement keys to move the book shelf.\r<br />While holding either of the modifier keys it will stop you from moving so you can move the selected book shelf.\r<br />This method saves you having to dance your fingers all over the keyboard as the keys are all your native keys you normally use in the game to move.\r<br />It also saves wrestling with key conflicts as your not having to map every movement key.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][u][size=4]Configurable Keys:[/size][/u][/color]\r<br />[H] = Select a targeted Spawnable Book Shelf activator to move, duplicate or delete a spawned book shelf.\r<br />[Delete] = Delete the selected Spawnable Book Shelf (any items the book shelf has will be returned to you before deleting).\r<br />[Y] = Duplicate the Selected Book Shelf on the spot (does not duplicate the itemss that the shelf may have stored).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][u]Keys when a Spawnable Book Shelf is Selected[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />Keys to move Book Shelf Forward, Back, Left or Right:[Spoiler]While holding [Left Attack/Block] use your movement keys (WASD or what ever you have them set as).\r<br />[Forward] = Move Book Shelf Forward\r<br />[Back] = Move Book Shelf Backwards\r<br />[Left] = Move Book Shelf Left\r<br />[Right] = Move Book Shelf Right\r<br />[Ready/Holster Weapon] = Reset Book Shelf position in front of you (this does not reset rotation or height).[/spoiler]\r<br />Keys to move Book Shelf Up, Down or Rotation:[Spoiler]While holding [Right Attack/Block] use your [Movement] keys (WASD or what ever you have them set as).\r<br />[Forward] = Move Book Shelf Upwards\r<br />[Back] = Move Book Shelf Downwards\r<br />[Left] = Rotate Book Shelf Anti-Clockwise\r<br />[Right] = Rotate Book Shelf Clockwise\r<br />[Sprint] = Snap Rotate Book Shelf (mcm settings let you configure the snap degree and direction)\r<br />[Ready/Holster Weapon] = Reset Book Shelf Height (Tap key) Or Reset Rotation (Hold key)[/spoiler]\r<br />Other SBS Keys (while not holding modifier key):[spoiler][Activate] = Unselect Selected Book Shelf\r<br />[Delete] = Delete Selected Book Shelf\r<br />[Y] = Duplicate Selected Book Shelf on the spot (does not duplicate the itemss that the shelf may have stored).\r<br />[Shout] = Move Book Shelf to where your looking\r<br />[Run] = Toggle Book Shelf movement speed 2 (slow and accurate), 50 (medium and less accurate), 150 (fast and no accuracy).[/spoiler]\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][u]Tip:[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />Read the SBS MCM menu tips when pointing at controls for brief info on what&#39;s what.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][u]Annoyances:[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />Books never seem to stand up straight, just like the vanilla Skyrim counter parts.\r<br />(I can change that, but at the expense of a more bloated and slower shelf script eg: Loop that calls multiple functions per book per iteration, no thanks).\r<br />Scrolls can stack in a mess, depends on the scrolls you store, but meh.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][u]General:[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />Expect bugs as I have not tested this for long periods of time as of yet.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][u]Permissions:[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />You may do as you please with this release, no need to ask or give credit.\r<br />Source scripts and models are in the BSA.\r<br
