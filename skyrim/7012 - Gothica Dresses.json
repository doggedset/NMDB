  "summary": "This mod adds a high-res standalone Gothic style dress into the world of Skyrim in a variety of colors. Currently only one color may be used at a time.",
  "descriptionHtml": "So yeah more details below but long story short the high res dds files are up--but the standalone is a bit glitchy. I don\\'t have anyone to run tests on these with so all I know is they work on my comp xD If you download this consider yourself a tester because in all honesty, it\\'s not quite finished. Should you run into any issues, please comment or message me and I\\'ll look into them. Also, if you like what I\\'m doing and are knowledgeable with modding then pretty please share any insight into how I might be able to fix the known glitches. I need a guru lol\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n Details\r\n =======\r\n*I just started modding a couple days ago--so there\\'s some errors I\\'m not sure how to fix. \r\nThe primary one being that when the dress is being viewed on the ground or via inventory; \r\nthe texture is that of \\\"belted tunic\\\". However, once the dress is equipped it changes into\r\nthe proper Gothica Dress of your choice. \r\n\r\n*Note that if the dress is shown in it\\'s male fashion; it will also look like a belted tunic \r\nas I was too lasy to create a male gothica tunic. Just equip it on a female and it should work.\r\n\r\n*The dress SHOULD randomly be for sale at any shop that sells clothes. I don\\'t know of a decent \r\nway to test this yet. Should you not be able to find it in a shop, pull up the command line by \r\npressing \\\"~\\\" then enter \\\"help gothica 4\\\" [press enter after doing so] which will pull up two \r\nitem IDs use the first one in the command \\\"player.placeatme GOTHICADRESSIDHERE\\\" press enter again\r\nthen \\\"`\\\" to leave the command line.\r\n\r\n\r\n Install\r\n =======\r\n 1. Place \\\"Gothica.esp\\\" in \\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\" then enable the plug-in\r\n 2. Place the \\\"Gothica\\\" folder from meshes into \\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\clothes\\\"\r\n 3. Place the \\\"Gothica\\\" folder from textures in \\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\clothes\\\"\r\n 4. Choose one of the colors and copy the .dds file from it into the Gothica texture folder\r\n\r\n Uninstall\r\n =========\r\n 1. Disable the Gothica.esp pulg-in\r\n 2. Remove the .esp file along with the Gothica mesh and texture folders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n History\r\n =======\r\n\r\n 1/26/2012 - 1.3 - Standalone, color options, high-res and ultra-high res dresses are released.\r\n\r\n 1/25/2012 - 1.0 - Initial release.
