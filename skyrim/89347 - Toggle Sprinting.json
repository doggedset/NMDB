  "summary": "Makes the sprint key work like it does in SSE.",
  "descriptionHtml": "As you probably know, Skyrim Special Edition changes how the sprint key works so that it functions as a toggle instead of having to hold the button, which I, for one, think was a smart move. However, I'm not particularly fond of SSE beyond that, so I decided to find a way to replicate it.Â \n<br />\n<br />And I have! This mod, partially based on a mod by xxt65xx that does the exact opposite for SSE, this mod makes the sprint key function as a toggle. It does so by using SKSE to trick the game into thinking that the key is still being held after it has been released.\n<br />\n<br />Requires SKSE",
