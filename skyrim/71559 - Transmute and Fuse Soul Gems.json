  "descriptionHtml": "[b]&#34;Transmute and Fuse Soul Gems&#34;[/b] Adds 3 new spells to the Alteration School that handle the transmutation and conversion of Soul Gems.\r<br />\r<br />[i]I personally don&#39;t like that kind of mods that allows crafting of Soul Gems through the Smithing station, and there are few one that do it through magic, but are a bit buggy. I had never modded before and it took me a day to figure out the Creation Kit and create this Mod based off the Transmute spell for the Ores. I had intended to keep it for my personal use, given that fact the game is a bit old now, and I am late for the Modding party, anyway I decided to share it with you guys, hope those few still playing the game enjoy it&#33;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/71559-5-1448464721.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />-&#34;Transmute Soul Gem&#34; It&#39;s an Apprentice spell that transmutes 2 lower capacity empty soul gems into 1 empty soul gem of better capacity:\r<br />\r<br />2 Petty : 1 Lesser.\r<br />2 Lesser: 1 Common.\r<br />2 Common: 1 Greater.\r<br />2 Greater: 1 Grand.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-&#34;Fuse Souls&#34; It&#39;s an Adept spell that Fuses 3 similar Souls contained in similar Soul Gems into one greater Soul and it will be stored in a better quality Soul Gem.\r<br />\r<br />3 Petty (Filled): 1 Lesser (Filled).\r<br />3 Lesser (Filled): 1 Common (Filled).\r<br />3 Common (Filled): 1 Greater (Filled).\r<br />3 Greater (Filled): 1 Grand (Filled).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-&#34;Transmute Black Soul Gem&#34; It&#39;s an Expert spell that transmutes 1 Grand Soul Gem into a Black Soul Gem. If the Grand Soul Gem is filled, the spell will transmute the nature of the contained Soul and store it in the newly created Black Soul Gem.\r<br />\r<br />1 Grand Soul Gem: 1 Black Soul Gem.\r<br />1 Grand Soul Gem (Filled): 1 Black Soul Gem(Filled).\r<br />\r<br />Spell Tomes of all 3 Spells were added to Dragon&#39;s Reach in Whiterun and The Arcaneum in Winterhold.\r<br />\r<br />*Misused the mod could be used for exploiting. I highly recommend to use Mods that permits the correct soul trapping for the soul gems.",
