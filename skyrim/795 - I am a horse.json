  "summary": "This is a save game file, not really a mod. I felt like sharing this bizarre bug.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This bug was caused by jumping off a cliff while riding my horse, hitting the tilda (~) key to open the console at the exact moment I hit the ground. I then clicked my horse, typed in \\\"resurrect\\\" without the quotations, and when I unpaused... My character had disappeared and I was the horse. \r\nIn this, you have full control over the horse. The camera works fine, but you can\\'t wander too far before textures blur and the game crashes. \r\nOne final thing, if you\\'re lucky you may switch back to the normal player character... With horse like reflexes. Turn on God Mode in the console before you hit the ground though.",
