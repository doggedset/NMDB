  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, Rhaegar fought honorably. And Rhaegar died.\\\"\r\n\r\nIn his youth Robert Baratheon was a paragon of a man, stronger and larger than most others on the battlefield. His chosen weapon was a war hammer of such immense size his friend Ned Stark could not wield it.Robert was never one to lead from the rear and his advance eventually brought him into combat with Prince Rhaegar. Robert decided the battle and ended the Targaryen rule in Westeros when his hammer crushed Rhaegar’s breastplate, spilling the rubies that adorned it into the water, giving the area now known as the Ruby Ford its name.\r\n\r\nThis is a mod to add Robert\\'s Warhammer from the book/TV show A Game of Thrones. The model is based on the reproduction created by the good folks at Valyrian Steel (http://www.valyriansteel.com/shop/swords/king-roberts-warhammer/prod_14.html)\r\n\r\nTo Install:\r\nUnzip contents into Skyrim Data folder: C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data (or custom folder of installed to a different location)\r\n\r\nThe weapon can be crafted at the Forge for 4 Iron Ingots, 2 Leather Straps and 1 Leather and improved at the grindstone for 1 Iron Ingot.\r\n\r\nLet me know you think and hopefully I’ll have some more weapons from A Song Of Ice And Fire series soon!",
