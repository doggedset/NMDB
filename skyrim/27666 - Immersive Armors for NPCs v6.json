  "descriptionHtml": "I have, in good faith, replicated toolmjk\\'s mod from scratch. No duplicate armors.\r\n\r\nThere may be minor differences between this and his mod (eye patches and capes at worst) but should be a good 100% replacement to his outdated mod.\r\n\r\nIf toolmjk desires I will remove this mod at any time.\r\n\r\nLoad after Immersive Armors. They may be naked at first. Go to a cell without any affected NPCs and wait 24 hours or play normally and they will in one days time be in proper gear.",
