Read their specific permission rules in the mod\\'s description or under the \\\"permissions and credits tab\\\". Don\\'t just assume things, that will get you banned. I\\'m taking some time off from modding Skyrim. I\\'ll be back to update everything I have on the site once I\\'ve gotten over the burn-out., maybe when the new DLC comes out. Until then, the use of any of my meshes and textures is strictly prohibited. I may be taking a break from updating, but that wont keep me from checking up on all my mods regularly to be sure there is no one abusing or stealing my work. Thanks always for all of your support and continue to enjoy my mods!\r\n\r\n\r\n*** ANNOUNCEMENT***\r\nI am currently working on getting CHSBHC, ADEC and Vanilla bodies in here so please be patient and watch for them. Also, an official BBP version for my CBBE variant is in the making, and will hopefully be here soon!!\r\n\r\nThis Mod has been a labor of love of mine for over 2 months now, so please don\\'t forget to endorse. This equipment mod is completely stand-alone and includes all of the following features:\r\n1. Full suit of Craftable, Dovahkiin Mercenary Armor including Shield and Amulet. \r\n2. Several Different Craftable, Dovahkiin Mercenary Weapons to choose from including Dagger, Axe, Swords and Bow and Arrows.\r\n3. Last but far from least, a beautiful, Dovahkiin Mercenary Armored Horse from Whiterun.\r\n\r\n****IMPORTANT NOTICE****\r\nMy Horse Armor is stand-alone and WILL NOT effect ANY other horses in the game. This means no bald or low resolution horses. It WILL however (if you have Armored Horse Mods installed) replace whatever horse the other mod has in Whiterun. No biggy, just make very sure you place  Dovahkiin Mercenary Armored Horse.esp BELOW any other Horse Armor mods!!! This WILL overwrite any of my other horse mods so choose only one.\r\n\r\nAcquire Instructions:\r\nArmor and Weapons:\r\n1. Craft: Everything but the Horse armor is Craftable under the \\\"Leather\\\" section of the forge once you have \\\"Steel Smithing\\\" perk unlocked.\r\n2. Console: Type \\\"Help Mercenary 0\\\" or \\\"Help Dovahkiin 0\\\" into the console.\r\nHorse:\r\n1. Just buy a horse from WHITERUN and it will come Armored. If It doesnt show after you buy it, just fast travel to any other city\\'s stable, thus respawning the horse and armoring it.\r\n\r\nInstall instructions:\r\n1. Unzip The Dovhakiin Mercenary.7z of your choice (Or just Install using Mod Manager and skip step 1 and 2)\r\n2. Place all files within into your \\\"Data\\\" folder located in your Skyrim install directory.\r\n3. Enable all Dovahkiin Mercenary .esp(s) from within Mod Manager or Skyrim Launcher, and preferably place them at the bottom of your load order list..\r\n4. This mod is the product of a combined 2 months of hard labor. Please Endorse!\r\n\r\nRequired Mods:\r\nDepending on your choice body style:\r\nCBBE v3 is Required - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\nUNP is Required - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6709\r\nNo horse armor mods are required!!",
