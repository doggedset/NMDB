  "descriptionHtml": "As we all should know Skyrim is 32bit with a 3gb total capacity. ANYTHING added to the game load will decrease the 3gb from the game.\r<br />Hi Def graphics take a lot of game load. Yet there are a lot of Hi Def mods available that are a\r<br />total waste of space. If you start with a poor quality texture, it does not matter how many DPI\r<br />you add, the visual graphic will not improve.\r<br />Look at the pictures I&#39;ve uploaded. All pictures on the left with HD texture mods installed.\r<br />And the picture on right is NON HD textures. You decide which visually looks better.\r<br />These pictures are in game before and after snapshots. Using a Full HD monitor.\r<br />If you like my textures then download my file.\r<br />Simple Install:\r<br />1: Unzip file\r<br />2: Drop texture folder on your &#34;Data&#34; folder inside your Skyrim directory.\r<br />That&#39;s it. Hope you enjoy these textures.\r<br />PS: The last picture is the inside of breezehome with a small modification I thought someone\r<br />might want to make on their own in Creation Kit.",
