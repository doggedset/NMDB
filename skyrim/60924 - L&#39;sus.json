  "descriptionHtml": "     This is a Mod that started as an inside joke, but I figured the world should enjoy L&#39;sus (Lapostrophesus). This is the rough early version. He only contains one line of dialogue as his voice actor is out of town at the moment. I plan to add a lot more to his character, but for now he is just a bum who will hack and cough at you in and outside of Whiterun. Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />---\r<br />He frequently sits upon the well in the center of Whiterun in the evening, but it&#39;s a little akward when he gets down.\r<br />\r<br />Let me know about any other issues to fix. Thanks.",
