  "descriptionHtml": "WARNING: I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CONSOLE COMMANDS DISABLE ACHIEVEMENTS ON STEAM. WHILE I MYSELF HAVE NO ISSUES WITH ACHIEVEMENTS, USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK\r\n\r\nEver find running around hunting for words of power before you can use them tedious? I know I do, so here\\'s a file to help you, which teaches you all words of power in the game.With the main wop.txt file you will still have to do quests relating to finding walls and will still have to kill dragonns for souls to activate the shouts, and it won\\'t affect any quest storylines at all. With wopsouls I have included 100 dragon souls, which is more than enough to unlock each shout to it\\'s full power\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: Word of power/dragon wall quests will still require completion, this just allows you to access words of power without hunting down the walls.\r\n\r\nTo use~~~\r\n-Place the wop.txt and/or wopsouls.txt file in your skyrim root directory (the folder that contains TESV.exe)\r\n-Load the game\r\n-Open the console\r\n-Type \\\"bat wop\\\" or \\\"bat wopsouls\\\"without quotes\r\n-Enjoy your words of power",
