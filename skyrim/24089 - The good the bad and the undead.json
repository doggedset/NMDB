  "descriptionHtml": "It was bought to my attention that I didnt ask permission to use Apachii hair and all the other mods......Before i start, I\\'d like to say thanks to everyone who made it possible for me to make this mod, All the links are supplies below. I do not take credit for the hair mods, etc, but i made the characters, and put the storyline together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good, the bad and the undead\r\nThe party\\'s started and it\\'s better when you\\'re dead   The 69 eyes\r\n\r\nWhile hunting near Helgen, I came across three mighty fighters, two Vampires and 1 Young Blond nord woman. Their story filled me with both sadness and grief, so i took them under my wing and asked them to be my followers. I was ever so wary of the two vampires, but something in the way they spoke made me trust them....for now.\r\n\r\nThe first, a mighty Male Nord named Lament.  level 15 Weapon Master Vampire. He towered over me, His eyes gleaming red. His chest heaving, I looked up into his eyes and immediately my legs turned to jelly. I tried to speak, but there was just silence between us, and yet i felt that so much was said I later found out that he and his sisters were attacked by Vampires . He and his elder sister were turned, but they managed to protect their younger sister, Winter, from this eternal death they are now doomed to suffer.\r\n\r\nThe second a beautiful red head named Demonia. She seems to be a Necromancer/Vampire. Also Level 15, She is the elder of the sisters and seems so much more mature than i expected.\r\n\r\nWinter is the younger and much smaller of the family, and I can\\'t help but feel sorry for her. She is a skilled  level 15 Rogue, with good illusion skills, I noticed that the two Vampires had faster speed than Winter.\r\n\r\nI shall walk with them through Tamriel, and trust these Vampires, and hopefully this will not lead to my untimely doom.\r\n\r\nI have left them in Riverwood Sleeping Giants Inn. \r\n\r\nWARNING    DAWNGUARD NEEDED\r\nYou must have ApachiiHair running for this mod. Make sure it is before her n the order.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/download/76734\r\nHair packs of Fallout http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17993\r\nHair packs of TES IV Oblivion http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18110\r\nOblivion Hair Pack Fixed now with NPCEditor Support   (not sure if needed)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22598\r\nBetter Females by Bella http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\nThe Eyes of Beauty http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722\r\nCoverwomen http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563\r\nBetter Face Gen  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6953\r\nFor RED EYES,   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/download/83976\r\nThe eyes of beauty    http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722\r\nExtended slide colors   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6923   (again not sure if this will be needed.)\r\nOther mods i have used\r\nCalientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- by Caliente\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r\nThe Wilds ENB   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21123\r\nCazy hairs and demoness hairs conversion by zzjay by cazy and zzjay\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19623\r\n\r\nFirst I\\'d like to thank netherwalk for his help and advice.http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1784046\r\nand Darkfox127 for his videos   http://www.youtube.com/user/DARKF0X127?feature=g-user-u\r\nand I\\'d like to THANK\r\nEvery one here for their fabulous Mods, \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/download/76734\r\nHair packs of Fallout http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17993\r\nHair packs of TES IV Oblivion http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18110\r\nOblivion Hair Pack Fixed now with NPCEditor Support   (not sure if needed)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22598\r\nBetter Females by Bella http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\nThe Eyes of Beauty http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722\r\nCoverwomen http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563\r\nBetter Face Gen  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6953\r\nFor RED EYES,   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/download/83976\r\nThe eyes of beauty    http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722\r\nExtended slide colors   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6923   (again not sure if this will be needed.)\r\nOther mods i have used\r\nCalientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- by Caliente\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r\nThe Wilds ENB   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21123\r\nCazy hairs and demoness hairs conversion by zzjay by cazy and zzjay\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19623\r\n\r\n",
