  "modId": 87575.0,
  "modName": "Skyrim Needs",
  "summary": "You will need to eat, drink and sleep and if you don&#39;t your health, magicka and stamina will reduce which adds realism to the game.",
  "descriptionHtml": "You will now need to eat, drink and sleep everyday or else your health, magicka and stamina will get reduced. You can eat, drink, sleep anytime in the day but along you meet up with the needs before the next day your health, magicka and stamina won&#39;t drain. You will need to eat 5 food items a day. Soups and Stews will count as two food items. You can eat 1 food item at breakfast 2 at lunch, and 2 at supper. You need to drink 3 drinks a day. You can have a drink at breakfast, lunch, and supper. You need to sleep for 8 hours. You can sleep from 10pm to 6am if you wish. You can also drink skooma and gain an addiction which makes you crave 1 bottle of skooma every day and your carrying weight and speed will be reduced if you don&#39;t meet your addiction. To make this mod easier I would download [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76040/?]More Inns[/url] mod and the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76042/?]Tel Mithryn Food And Bed[/url] which will add more Inns with rentable beds to sleep in. If you want the Skyrim Special Edition version go [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13183?]here[/url]. And if you play Oblivion also look at my [url=http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/44091/?]Oblivion Needs[/url].\r<br />\r<br />THIS MOD IS INCOMPLETE SINCE THE BEDROLL MODEAL, COOKING POT MODEL,  AND THE TENT MODEL IS NOT FINISHED. THE COLLISION ON THESE MODELS WILL ACT AS STATIC AND WHEN YOU DROP THEM FROM YOUR INVENTORY FOR USE THEY WILL NOT BEHAVE PROPERLY BUT ARE STILL USABLE. ALSO THE COOKING POT MODEL IN THE INVENTORY MENU APPEARS SMALL FOR SOME ODD REASON. IF YOU ARE SKILLED WITH MODELS AND WANT TO HELP FINISH THE MOD BY FIXING THESE ISSUES JUST LEAVE A COMMENT BELOW OR PM ME.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements\r<br />Skyrim\r<br />Hearthfire (Needs Hearthfire)\r<br />Dragonborn (Needs Dragonborn)\r<br />\r<br />To install just download then extract folder and drag the master and bsa file into your data folder.",
