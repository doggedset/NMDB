  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome and thank you for visiting Helms Haven. Helms Haven is medium sized player house with all of your needs as well as a few luxuries without being overloaded. It features a large main floor with a loft where the bed room is located. A crafting room and a storage hall all connected to the main floor. The house and surrounding areas are fully nav meshed and very follower friendly.  Located due west of the Guardian Stones south of Riverwood on the shores of the lake. Fast travel point is discoverable.\r\nAs far as I know it has no conflicts with other mods. It is on the cell borders of -2 -15 wilderness. If anyone find conflicts please report.\r\n\r\nCheck out my latest player house and village. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22618] Heartwood Village and the Amberhalls [/url]\r\n\r\n [url=http://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/skyrim/mods/bordeciel/habitations/havre_de_helms.php] French translation [/url] Thanks Xiony\r\n\r\nVersion 1.9 July 26th 2012\r\n\r\nLot of terrain editing around the outside, subtle but it is there. This should fix the cell border CTD bug caused from the Skyrim 1.6.89.0.6 update. Did a lot of nav mesh adjustments after the 1.6.89.0.6 patch.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.8 July 20th 2012\r\n\r\nAdjustments to loft beds. New idle markers. Made the loft feel a little more open.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.7 July 13th 2012\r\n\r\nVery minor update. I added one wooden beam and 4 ceiling panels to plug up some holes that I noticed after the 1.6 update for Skyrim.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.6 May 20th 2012\r\n\r\n[b]WEAPON PLAQUES![/b] How I hate them. Ok so since people where still having issues with the plaques I deleted every single one of them and put in new ones. I put in wooden beams behind them to pull them off the walls for MAXIMUM compatibility with custom weapon models. I filled my inventory with custom and vanilla weapons and shields and proceeded to go around the house and test every single with plaque with over 40 weapons. EVERY SINGLE PLAQUE works perfectly fine for me and two other people I had test this. *gives plaques the bird*\r\n\r\n[b][color=red] So pay attention to the following. [/b][/color] Go into Helms Haven BEFORE YOU UPDATE and take off all of your weapons and shields from ALL of the plaques then go OUTSIDE and save. Then update and go put them back. If you do not do this you will need to use the console and type TCL to get your weapons and shields from behind the new plaques.\r\nOh yea and I added some more plaques to the main floor.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.5 May 19th 2012\r\n\r\n[color=green] [b] Floating Grass Fix [/b] [/color] \r\nOkay so the reason I could not see any floating grass is because I have cleaned INI files. To fix the floating grass bug [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Floating_Grass_Fix] click this [/url] and follow the instructions. By the way this will fix the floating grass bug for ALL mods not just mine.\r\n\r\nAdjustments to lighting. I no longer see any flicker bugs of any sort in lighting or texture overlaps. Fixed the stair problem. Adjusted racks for better compatibility with custom weapon models. Added more idle markers.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.4 April 30th 2012\r\n\r\n[B] [color=red] Large update, please read before updating. [/B] [/color] All of what has been added was from requests via comments and PMs. Please endorse the file if you like it and use it. Same goes for any mod. This makes them easier to find for other people on the Nexus.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.4 adds a full basement to Helms Haven. It is filled with display cases, mannaquins, weapon plaques, weapons and shield plaques, dagger cases and enough book storage to hold 1 of every book in the game and then some.\r\nThe new door to the basement uses the wall space next to the storage hall so the two weapon plaques there have been removed so get your stuff off them before you update and make a back up save just in case. I tested it without removing the weapons and they just hung in the air and I could grab them. So I do not see any huge problems just overwritting the old file.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center] [b] Basement Feautures [/b]\r\n\r\n•\t10 Display cases (weapon)\r\n•\t8 Weapon Plaques\r\n•\t5 Weapon Shield Plaques\r\n•\t5 Dagger Cases\r\n•\t8 Mannaquins\r\n•\t4 54 Book shelves\r\n•\t2 22 Book shelves\r\n•\t9 Shines (all the divines, Talos counts don\\'t listen to the Thalmor)\r\n•\tBoiler for the hot tub\r\n•\tA vault with 2 large non respawning safes\r\n•\t3 dozen idle markers for sand boxed NPC and Dovakin Relaxes\r\n•\tProper lighting (no flicker bugs)\r\n•\tProper Nav Meshing (NPC friendly) [/center]\r\n\r\nGeneral updates. Fixed 2 display cases on the main floor to take weapons. Minor adjustments to lighting. Added about 2 dozen more harvestable plants and mushrooms outside as well as some lamp posts and lanterns along the docks. Added a dozen or so idle markers outside as well.\r\n\r\nFeel free to comment and endorse. I will be keeping tabs on the comments page for requests, for future updates and improvements.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.01\r\n\r\nMinor adjustments to lighting. Removes 2 weapon plaques and fixes that weapon and shield plaque above the workbench. Tested every single weapon rack and plaque again with one and 2 handed weapons and custom models. I did not run into any problems. Tested with three different saves.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.02 April 6th 2012 (optional update)\r\n\r\nChanges include minor adjustments to the nav mesh, moved 2 containers (should not affect stored items) a new large bath house style room complete with a fountain multiple seating areas for player as well as over 30 new idle markers for sand boxed followers or spouse. Idle markers also work with Dovakin relaxes too mod. A large amount of alcohol has been added to the other stock piles of bottled courage about. Enjoy.\r\n\r\nSee images tab for bath house. Install just overwrite the old esp with the new one. As always when upgrading a mod be sure to make back up save just in case.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.03 April 24th 2012\r\n\r\nMinor adjustments of the 1.02 version to lighting and placements to help with \\\"flicker bug\\\".\r\n\r\nRecommended files to use with Helms Haven.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14037] UFO-Ultimate Follower Overhaul [/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9504] Followers Relax [/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13931] Dovahkiin Relaxes [/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center] [b] Interior Features [/b]\r\n\r\n•\tOver 40 NON re-spawning containers.\r\n•\tForge\r\n•\tWorkbench\r\n•\tTanning Rack\r\n•\tGrinding Stone\r\n•\tAlchemy Table\r\n•\tEnchanters Table\r\n•\tCooking stations\r\n•\t6 Weapon Plaques\r\n•\t3 Weapon and Shield Plaques\r\n•\t8 Weapon Racks\r\n•\t3 2 shelf 11per book cases total of 66 books\r\n•\t2 Mannaquins\r\n•\tIdle markers for followers or spouses \r\n•\t2 Beds and plenty of seating\r\n•\tProper lighting\r\n•\tOptimized no unneeded rendering for better performance\r\n\r\n[b] Exterior Features [/b]\r\n\r\n•\tSmelter\r\n•\tWood Chopping block\r\n•\tGarden with some chicken and goats, nests included\r\n•\tA varitity of plants for alchemy\r\n•\tA new bridge to the house and one that leads out to a small island\r\n•\tOutdoor seating area\r\n•\tCampfire ring with chairs\r\n•\tIncreased critter / insect spawn for harvesting\r\n•\tThe roof is dragon friendly so they can land and burn your chickens and goats.
