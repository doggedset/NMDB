  "summary": "Portal Spell : Portal between all 3 houses with a single spell. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will allow you to zoom around the Hearthfire homes, like my other multiportal spell, as a form of teleportation. It also adds a vendor to sell the spell, and a couple other items. \r\n\r\nVendor location : Falkreath Tavern. Look for the kid. He also sells a few minor things as well. \r\n\r\nIf you use more than one of my multiportal mods, you will need all of the different files. Each one has different locations possible. \r\n\r\nLocations you go to : \r\n\r\nall three houses, front room. \r\n\r\nNote : You must have built the front door to access the house, so you need to get it normally, and build it up, before this spell is able to be used.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nFeel free to look up my other spells. Search for \\\"Higher Magic\\\" for a full list.",
