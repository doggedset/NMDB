  "descriptionHtml": "Bethesda has done it again. When giving From-Deepest-Fathoms a pamphlet of Mara during the \\\"Spread the Love\\\" radiant quest, it says \\\"Here, brother. Blessings of Mara upon you.\\\", even though Fathoms is clearly a female. This mod fixes that, giving the proper dialogue when talking to her during this quest.\r\n\r\nAll I\\'ve done is changed part of the dialogue branch so that you refer to Fathoms as \\\"sister\\\", rather than \\\"brother\\\".\r\n\r\nShame on you Bethesda for missing such an obvious mistake! :P",
