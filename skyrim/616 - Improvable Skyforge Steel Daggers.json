Nothing else has been changed, and you can still purchase them from Eurlond Gray-mane in Whiterun. \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nExtract the .esp file to your \\\\Skyrim\\\\data directory, and enable the file in your game launcher. \r\n\r\nIf you correctly installed the mod and your Data Files option is greyed out in the launcher, you will need to do the following.\r\n1. Go to Documents -> My Games -> Skyrim\r\n2. Open up the SkyrimPrefs.ini file\r\n3. Look about half way down for [Launcher]\r\n4. Add \\'bEnableFileSelection=1\\' no quotes and save.\r\n",
