So you can&#39;t use it around allies, you definitely can&#39;t use it in towns, and in fact personally I tend to hesitate to use it at all, since you never know when some idiot NPC (i.e. chicken) will be lurking around the corner waiting to report a crime or break a quest.\r<br />\r<br />So, I made this mod, which changes Storm Call so that it will only strike NPCs that are already hostile. It will even stop striking enemies if they turn non-hostile (e.g. a guard you just yielded to). You can even cast it in the middle of town and all you&#39;ll get is rain - until you attack someone&#33; Then you will get lightning.\r<br />\r<br />Admittedly, this makes the shout a little bit less awesome, but it also makes it safer to use, which is pretty good too.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Place the contents of the archive in your Skyrim/Data directory. Works with Nexus Mod Manager.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />\r<br />Not compatible with things that modify Storm Call. Obviously.\r<br />\r<br />History:\r<br />\r<br />1.0 - Initial release",
