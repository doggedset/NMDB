  "descriptionHtml": "*Original Mod Required!* Download it, it\\'s awesome!\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24352]Clanking Armor[/url] by LordSane\r\n\r\nWhile I love LordSane\\'s mod for Clanking Armor, myself and a few others requested sounds that are slightly deeper, with a little more bass. This is a mod of that mod!\r\n\r\nAfter about 15 minutes with a free sound editing utility, I changed the original files to suit my personal tastes. I added some bass and deepened the sound of the clanks for each sound file. They\\'re a bit more \\\"punchy\\\" with a lower pitch.\r\n\r\nAfter installing his original mod, just install these files to skyrim/data\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, delete from skyrim/data/sound/fx/newheavyarmorsound\r\n\r\nA huge thanks to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/5386406]LordSane[/url] for his Clanking Armor mod and files! His permission notes say that his files are free to use as long as I credit him, and he has approved my contribution.\r\n\r\nI wish only to share my immersive experiences with the Skyrim community. :)\r\n\r\nUser [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2645612]svaalbard[/url] / [url=http://www.youtube.com/user/insane0hflex]insane0hflex[/url] has made a wonderful mod spotlight video that shows the difference between the original and deeper versions. Thanks man!\r\n\r\n[youtube]9ThbZEn68oY[/youtube]\r\n\r\nClanking demonstration at 0:32ish",
