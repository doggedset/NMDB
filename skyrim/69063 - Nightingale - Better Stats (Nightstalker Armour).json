I like the stats of two items from each set, but I looked slightly odd wearing half of the pieces of each. Being a World of Warcraft player for about 3 years, I&#39;ve loved the transmogrification feature since it was released in Cataclysm. Using the transmog tool, you&#39;re able to take any varied piece of armour and give it the appearance of another that you already own. This allows you to give your character any look that you desire&#33; Rather than trying to install some buggy mod to accomplish this in Skyrim, I just decided to spend about half an hour in the Creation Kit to reach my goal.\r<br />\r<br />Have a similar idea and want a set of armour with the enchantments of another? Leave a comment&#33; If I have time, I can attend to your request and add the armour that you wish to the vendor included.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]2. How to Install[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*]Download latest version\r<br />[*]Drag Nightstalker.esp into your Skyrim Data folder ([url=http://i.imgur.com/uHvh7w5.png]Screenshot[/url])\r<br />[*]Launch the Skyrim launcher and go to Data Files ([url=http://i.imgur.com/e9HCPdA.png]Screenshot[/url])\r<br />[*]Move Nightstalker.esp to the lowest possible load order with the arrows, make sure the checkbox IS CHECKED, and click OK.

[b]Where to Get the Set[/b]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=2]Go to Belethor&#39;s General Goods in Whiterun and talk to Taryn. She&#39;ll be selling the entire set&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[/size][b][size=5]4. Closing Remarks[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/b]This is a very small and simple mod I made in my free time, but I hope it serves a mutual purpose to someone out there. Leave a comment if you want a set like this with enchantments from something else&#33; If I have time, I&#39;ll consider adding your suggestion to the mod. Thanks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Note: I&#39;m not responsible for any damage caused to your saves with improper (un)installation of my mod. Modification of Skyrim must be handled with care as the fate of your save games are in your hands.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]5. Changelog[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />08/24/2015 V.1 - First commit",
