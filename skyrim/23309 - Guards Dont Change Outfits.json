  "descriptionHtml": "Simply makes guards always have the normal armor of their hold, no matter whether the hold has been captured. (No Imperial armored guards in Riften, or Stormcloak guards in Markarth, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhen captured, there is no noticable difference to the guards. The armor does not change, their dialogue does not change, nor does their name. A guard in Falkreath will still have their name \\\"Falkreath Guard\\\" and their usual armor set. Basically the only noticable difference about a city is a scenery change (Most easily seen in Whiterun) and a different Jarl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShould be compatible with any mod that doesn\\'t change a guards outfit. Please inform me if you find any.",
