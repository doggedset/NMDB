  "summary": "Adds several new followers representing in-game factions.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds (at the current time) five followers, from the Imperials, Stormcloaks, Thalmor, Thieves Guild, and Forsworn. Each one has their own custom textured armor, which is not playable at the moment, due to me seeing little point in creating opposite gender textures etc for armor most people won&#39;t use anyway. A couple also have custom combat AI\r<br />\r<br />The followers are as follows:\r<br />\r<br />Avernus\r<br />Faction: Imperial\r<br />Race: Imperial\r<br />Location: Castle Dour, Solitude\r<br />\r<br />Ygritte\r<br />Faction: Stormcloaks\r<br />Race: Nord\r<br />Location: Palace of the Kings, Windhelm\r<br />\r<br />Lucius\r<br />Faction: Thalmor\r<br />Race: High Elf\r<br />Location: Outside the Thalmor Embassy\r<br />\r<br />Malath\r<br />Faction: Forsworn (ish)\r<br />Race: Breton\r<br />Location: Cidhna Mine, Markarth\r<br />AI: Very offensively biased, and will almost never use ranged weapons, preferring melee or his fists.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;The Viper&#34;\r<br />Faction: Thieves Guild\r<br />Race: Nord\r<br />Location: The Ragged Flagon, Riften\r<br />AI: Prefers to avoid combat, and favours bows.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Consider this a beta version. I am currently working on several additional followers, dialogue, etc, which may be released in the near future.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: I believe these NPCs do not suffer from the dreaded grey face bug. However, if this still happens, select the NPCs in the creation kit (they are all prefixed with R97R, so should be easy to find), and it CTRL+F4. This should solve the problem.\r<br />\r<br />Planned Extras\r<br />\r<br />-Dark Brotherhood, Companions, Dawnguard, Volkihar, Reordan and Skaal followers.\r<br />-Dialogue (currently half-done)\r<br />-Voices (will be added when sufficiently high standard audio is available)\r<br />\r<br />",
