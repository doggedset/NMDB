  "descriptionHtml": "some time ago i use a couple of mods to have darker nights and dungeons and heavier rain but now the lights from most interior locations and at night are too dark to see with my torch especially when it rains. not wanting to have to remove those mods and the immersion of going through dark dungeons and night time travel i created this little mod that changes the radius of most light sources (candles, torches, fire, ect) to 20-50% increase and player or npc held torches and candle light spells is near double the range.\r\n\r\nto install just move the lights.esm file to data folder and load the data files on the game launcher like all the other mods.\r\nto remove just remove the lights.esm file",
