  "descriptionHtml": "Lois: \\\"Glen, thank you so much for helpin me tear up my carpet.\\\"\r\nGlen: \\\"Well you know Lois, I gotta confess, ah, when you called me, I sort of misunderstood what you were askin for. That\\'s why I rushed over.\\\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRequires CBBE or CHSBHC to be already installed, as they share the same UV map.  If you use large breasts, the curvy texture is recommended for more shadowing under them. (Version 5.1 supports the Curvy and Slim versions of CBBE, as well as the hip texture compatibility packs for each.  You only need to install one version.  It\\'s just one texture, and it will overwrite the default female body texture you\\'re already using.\r\n\r\n[According to CHSBHC FAQ:\r\nQ: Will CBBE skin textures work on CHSBHC?\r\nA: Yes they should work perfectly fine as they both use the same UV template. So as long as the mod is just a texture it will work fine.]\r\n\r\nCalientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- by Caliente\r\nhttp://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nNatural Bodies all in one (for Dragon Age: Origins) by Newbypower, Thor925, adriangi, Rebel o Conner, Horrid, Gray, mutantspicy and Altorian\r\nhttp://www.dragonagenexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=554\r\n\r\nCHSBHC body mod and BBP -Breast and Butt Physics- by CherryHotaling\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4888\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nIt replaces only one file. Make a backup of it before you install this, in case you change your mind.\r\nSkyrim/Data/textures/actors/character/female/femalebody_1.dds\r\n\r\nAfter backing up your file, read the installation instructions in the readme.txt file included in the archive.\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\n\r\nOpinions about the asthetics of naughty bits are purely subjective.  I don\\'t want to go into it.  If you like this, use it.  If not, please just don\\'t.  I assembled this for myself and liked it enough to share.  I intend to keep working on it only until I\\'m happy with it.\r\n\r\nThere are some glaring issues with 5.1 that I\\'d like to fix.  If there is enough demand, version 6 will include those fixes, and perhaps even a vagina variety.  Vagina variety.  Now that is fun to say.\r\n\r\nI liked where Pretty Nudes was going, but the author hasn\\'t updated it in a while, so I whipped this up using Caliente\\'s CBBE base skin template and composited bits of a texture from Natural Bodies on Dragon Age Nexus.  I really wish someone would port Natural Bodies All In One to both TES and Fallout (and Sims 3 while you\\'re granting wishes! - although I don\\'t know if there is any cure for pudding-face).  Still, I hope someone will make it their project to bring more of those textures over to CBBE.  Maybe that increasingly hypothetical someone will be me.  But I doubt it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGlen: (Pointing to strip of carpet.) \\\"Hey, uh, Lois, do you want me to leave a little strip in this thing? Maybe a lightning bolt, a unicorn, or something like that?\\\"\r\nLois: \\\"No, I want it all gone Glenn.\\\"\r\nGlen: \\\"All right, we\\'re going Brazilian!\\\" \r\n\r\n",
