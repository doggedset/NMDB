In the events of Dragon Age, \r\nit can be witnessed that some humans get infected by Darkspawn during the Blight and in return they also become Darkspawn in days or less \r\nbecause of the corruption that flows in their veins. Well, in this mod 5 humans that are infected \\\"half-darkspawn\\\" are added into the game \r\nawaiting their death by you while frienzingly trying to kill anything else that stands in their way. They are located apparently east of Pinewatch (Falkreath Hold) \r\non the mountain where a burnt up cabin is located.They are scatered in they clearing so that low level characters (around 1-6 level) can somewhat pull each one\r\nand kill them with more ease. The reason for this is that they are level 15 and their \\\"boss\\\" (the one inside the cabin) is 20.However they shouldn\\'t be much of a\r\nproblem for level 10+ characters as they only wield daggers and wear clothing. Anyways... Good hunting and as always...\r\n\r\n \r\n                                                                                                                      !!!ENJOY!!!",
