  "descriptionHtml": "REQUIRES DAWNGAURD \r\n\r\nSimply makes it so that you can craft the Ancient Falmer Armor you can receive in game. I have also made the Ancient Falmer Crown craftable. I have based the required items off of the regular Elven Armor. I used quicksilver instead of iron, and doubled the Moonsilver requirements.\r\n\r\nNote: If you have any suggestions or bugs, the feel free to alert me to them and I will fix them as fast as I can.\r\n\r\nCHANGE LOG:\r\nVersion 1.2\r\n     -Added a ruby the crafting recipe for the crown.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n     -Fixed bug in NMM instal script.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n     -Added crown fix in which, unlike in Zerocloud411\\'s mod, it will not make your characters hair disappear. However, this means that depending on your hair style, there may be some hair clipping though the crown.  \r\n     -Made one main file that is modular, and uses NMM\\'s install script to make instillation easier.  \r\n\r\nVersion 0.3\r\n     -Made it so that you will not be able to craft items until after you have completed Touching the Sky Stage 130. This means you cannot craft these until after you have retrieved Auriel\\'s Bow.  \r\n\r\nVersion 0.2\r\n     -Added \\\"No crown\\\" version  \r\n\r\nVersion 0.1\r\n     -Initial Release  ",
