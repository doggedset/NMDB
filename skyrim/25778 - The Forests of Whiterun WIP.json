  "summary": "Changes the exterior plains of Whiterun into a forest.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod does one simple thing. It takes the plains outside of Whiterun and turns them into a forest.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have added forested areas to:\r\nBattle-Born Farm\r\nChillfurrow Farm\r\nHonningbrew Meadery (and the path going up behind)\r\nPelagia Farm\r\nWhiterun Stables\r\n\r\nThe general shape of the landscape is being left alone (for the most part). All I\\'m doing is mostly adding lots of trees, logs, stumps, rocks, shrubs, grasses, flowers, animals, and other things to the area. There is also a follower near the Whiterun Stables named Ranger Aelys. She\\'s a Nord with a bow and is modeled after the lovely Fastred of Ivarstead.\r\n\r\nI am not turning the entire tundra into a forest, as that would just take too long to do! Instead the forest is going to be all around the south of Whiterun, as well as around the city itself.\r\n\r\nAny mods that add or remove to the landscape outside of Whiterun MIGHT conflict with this. I can\\'t say for certain because I don\\'t use many mods outside of ones that affect the player/world textures.\r\n\r\nPlease leave feedback on this, as I will use it to improve what I am doing.",
