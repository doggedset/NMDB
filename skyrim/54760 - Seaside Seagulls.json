  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/QtD7v94.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This simple mod was created after I came across the fine [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54679/?]Ducks and Swans for Skyrim[/url]. I love the seaside, and wanted to try and make some seagulls, so here we are.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== ABOUT ==[/color]\r<br />The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />I am painfully aware that the texture I included in the first release is not the best - same with the model, but that model is the vanilla Skyrim model so I take no blame for that one. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4425231/?]Ewi65[/url] kindly hooked me up with some better textures (original textures were 128x256, new ones are 256x512), so be sure to download them when you get the mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== LOCATION ==[/color]\r<br />You can find these seagulls around the coastline, especially near ships and docks. I didn&#39;t put all that many (I think it was a total of 90) so don&#39;t worry about there being overpopulation. They drop seagull feathers on death, with effects similar to hawk feathers, but with a touch of resistance to frost.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== UPDATES ==[/color]\r<br />Version v2 adds sounds for the gulls, and a merchant north of Windhelm (rather hard to reach, but there&#39;s a map marker that you need to discover before fast travel), who sells seagull eggs and feathers. \r<br />\r<br />I hope the sounds are the right volume, but if they are too loud or too quiet for you, feel free to adjust them to your liking on a program such as [url=http://audacity.sourceforge.net/]Audacity[/url]. I cannot, unfortunately, offer a preview video because my rig is not up for recording, but you can preview the sound I used [url=http://www.freesound.org/people/juskiddink/sounds/77075/]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== COMPATIBILITY AND RECOMMENDED MODS ==[/color]\r<br />The mod touches a lot of cells on the coast, so I&#39;d recommend you place it as high as you can in your load order. It will work best with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1306/?]Ambient Seagulls[/url] by Tricolour and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54679/?]Ducks and Swans for Skyrim[/url] by Tamira.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== INSTALLATION ==[/color]\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== CREDITS ==[/color]\r<br />- Improved seagull textures by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4425231/?]Ewi65[/url].\r<br />- [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1264-catering-by-lilith/]Catering[/url] and [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1300-ready-clutter-and-furnishings/]Ready Clutter and Furnishings[/url] by Lilith.\r<br />- Fishing supplies by InsanitySorrow at [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1330-the-tesa-skyrim-resource-kit-project/]The TESA Skyrim Resource Kit Project[/url].\r<br />- Seagull sounds by Juskiddink at [url=http://www.freesound.org/people/juskiddink/sounds/77075/]FreeSound[/url].\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31252/?]Scale and Fur[/url] by Franklin Zunge.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]Visit [url=http://jokerine.webs.com/]my website[/url] for a unique showcase of my work&#33; Thank you, GhostAgent&#33;[/color] \r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
