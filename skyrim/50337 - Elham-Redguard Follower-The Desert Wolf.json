  "descriptionHtml": "Description:-\r<br />This adds a Redguard named Elham to the Dead Man&#39;s Drink Inn. He has a good one-handed sword skill and block skills, so I suggest you give him a shield and sword.He is Essential so  you don&#39;t have to worry about him dying on you. This was my first mod so he doesn&#39;t have a custom voice or a custom armor.As mentioned he will be found in the Falkreath Inn/Tavern\r<br />\r<br />Lore:-\r<br />\r<br />Elham was an Imperial veteran who lost his left eye in battle, and was branded the name &#34;Desert Wolf&#34; for his mercenary work in Hammerfell. He was then hired within the ranks of the Alik&#39;r to hunt down rogue citizens from Hammerfell who have commited something wrong..\r<br />\r<br />During one of his operations he accidentally killed one of his comrades and was set up to be a traitor to the Alik&#39;r, so he escaped to Skyrim and is now resting in the Dead Man&#39;s Drink Inn in Falkreath, looking for an old friend who can help him redeem himself.\r<br />\r<br />Recommended:-\r<br />Redguard Knight Armor by Hothtrooper44 \r<br />Redguard Shield Standalone by Nroski\r<br />Tribal Scimitar by ImsumDave\r<br />The Eyepatch shown in screenshots is Bandit Eyepatch by Ceekay9\r<br />(http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1874/?)\r<br />\r<br />Requrements:-\r<br />This mod requires  Skyrim 1.9.32.1.0\r<br />Nothing else&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Installation:-\r<br />Download via NMM or manually\r<br />Extract and put the esp in the Data folder in SKyrim directory\r<br />Activate the mod in NMM\r<br />Play the game&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall:-\r<br />Be sure to take everything he had from you\r<br />Deactivate the file in NMM\r<br />Delete the esp\r<br />Bingo&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Be sure to give a kudos or endorse this mod if you like....",
