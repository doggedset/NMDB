  "descriptionHtml": "[color=orange][b][b][b][color=#6d9eeb][u]Update - 6th of May, 2017[/u]Â - I thank everyone for trying out and enjoying my work. I am no longer active with Skyrim or modding as a whole, so I&#39;d like to change the permissions and say feel free to use any asset of this mod in your own work, but try and upload only to the Nexus. Just throw me a link, I like seeing what people come up with.[/color][/b][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Description[/b][/color]\r<br />[color=orange][b]Installation[/b][/color]\r<br />[color=orange][b]Files and their Changes[/b][/color]\r<br />[color=orange][b]Compatibility[/b][/color]\r<br />[color=orange][b]Permissions and Credits[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Hearthfire DLC required.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][b]=Description=[/b][/color]\r<br />This mod places ovens and churns added by the Hearthfire DLC throughout Skyrim. Main cities, settlements, and player houses are covered in separate files for maximum compatibility.\r<br />\r<br />Main feature of my other mod - Workable Churns is also included. This allows you to turn a jug of milk into butter. No more waiting for when it respawns&#33; If you were using Workable Churns, you don&#39;t need it anymore.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][b]=Installation=[/b][/color]\r<br />Use the Nexus Mod Manager to activate the mod. The installation process will guide you through the available options.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][b]=Files and their Changes=[/b][/color]\r<br />[b]Major Cities[/b]\r<br />This option edits the five major walled cities. It adds ovens and churns in their inns, the jarlhouses/keeps, and also in a few special places where appropriate, e.g. Windhelm&#39;s New Gnisis Cornerclub.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Areas affected:[/b]\r<br />Whiterun Bannered Mare\r<br />Whiterun Dragonsreach Palace\r<br />\r<br />Windhelm Palace of Kings\r<br />Windhelm Candlehearth Hall\r<br />Windhelm New Gnisis Cornerclub\r<br />Windhelm Argonian Assemblage\r<br />\r<br />Solitude Winking Skeever\r<br />Solitude Blue Palace\r<br />\r<br />Markarth Silver Blood Inn\r<br />Markarth Understone Keep\r<br />\r<br />Riften Mistveil Keep Barracks\r<br />Riften Bee and Barb\r<br />\r<br />[b]Minor Cities and Settlements[/b]\r<br />Affects minor cities, settlements, and inns. Almost all settlements now have ovens and churns, whether in the inn or in a major house.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Areas affected:[/b]\r<br />Morthal Moorside Inn\r<br />Winterhold Frozen Hearth Cellar\r<br />Falkreath Dead Man&#39;s Drink\r<br />Dawnstar Windpeak Inn\r<br />\r<br />Karthwasten Hall\r<br />Stonehills Sorli&#39;s House\r<br />Ivarstead Vilemyr Inn\r<br />Kynesgrove Braidwood Inn\r<br />Rorikstead Frostfruit Inn\r<br />Riverwood Sleeping Giant Inn\r<br />Shor&#39;s Stone Sylgja&#39;s House\r<br />\r<br />[b]Player Houses[/b]\r<br />Adds ovens and churns in player homes. They are disabled by default and come when the appropriate upgrade is bought.\r<br />\r<br />Breezehome - Churn available with the kitchen upgrade.\r<br />Honeyside - Churn with the kitchen area, oven with the alchemy lab.\r<br />Vlindrel Hall - Oven and churn with the living room upgrade.\r<br />Hjerim - Oven and churn with the kitchen upgrade.\r<br />Proudspire Manor - A separate little room was created in the basement. Oven and churn along with safe storage comes with the alchemy upgrade.\r<br />\r<br />Also, every file edits the churns in the Hearthfire houses to use my new script.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][b]=Compatibility=[/b][/color]\r<br />Compatible with Perseid&#39;s Inns and Taverns - Realistic Room Rental Enhanced. [b]Do not[/b] use the Hearthfire patch from his mod to ensure compatibility. I have placed the ovens and churns to make sure it works both with vanilla and Perseid&#39;s mod.\r<br />\r<br />Realistic Needs and Diseases - an option is available during the Nexus Mod Manager installation, allowing you to convert 2 milk bottles into a jug to create butter with the churn.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][b]=Permissions and Credits=[/b][/color]\r<br />You do not have permission to upload this mod anywhere, or take parts of it as your own without my permission. If you want to make a translation, feel free to upload it here on the Nexus.",
