Argus travels to Skyrim to pursue the life he dreams of. \n<br />He's excited to fight and desire to grow stronger, but as time goes by, Argus finds someone he loves in a village,\n<br /> and finally Argus decides to marry her and change his life to become a good husband. \n<br />but when Argus was on a mission to huntdown a monster in a dungeon, \n<br />the village where his wife was living was attacked by a group of necromancers who were performing their rituals.\n<br />\n<br />After completing his mission to hunt down the monster, Argus returns to the village and shocked to see the village destroyed, \n<br />and then run as fast as he can to see his wife's situation, then he sees group of necromancers has made all villagers into a bunch of undead, \n<br />Argus was attacked from all directions, but with his skill, he could block everything and defeat the necromancers one by one, \n<br />until leaving only one undead he couldn't kill, his own wife.\n<br />\n<br />Argus wept over the circumstances as he hugged his wife, but suddenly his wife attacked and almost killed him \n<br />because his wife was still under control by necromancer behind him who was hiding before, Argus immediately chased \n<br />the necromancer and instantly shoots him down with a bow, then Argus approached him and threatened to kill him,\n<br /> and asked the necromancer to save his wife, but the necromancer can't return the undead to life again, \n<br />he explain that the soul of his wife can still be saved, but her body can't be saved. \n<br />\n<br />After heard that Argus became very angry and prepared Black Soul Gem to save the soul of his wife, \n<br />and swear he'll find a way to revive his wife someday, instantly with tears in his eyes, \n<br />Argus slashed his enchanted dagger to his wife's body and hold the soul to make sure enter the Black Soul Gem he has prepared, \n<br />and then his wife's corpse turns into ashes.\n<br />\n<br />With a very dark sadness, Argus became very angry at the necromancer who had made his wife and the villager a living corpse, \n<br />and finally Argus tortured the necromancer until there was nothing left of his body, \n<br />not even his bones because Argus's mind had been blinded by anger.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=3]Credits :[/size][/color]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />All the credit goes to the mod's authors.",
