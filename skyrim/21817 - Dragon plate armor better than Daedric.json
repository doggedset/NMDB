One would also argue than dragons are the most powerful creatures in Tamriel.\r\nWell then, ever wondered why Daedric is still better?\r\nWonder no more because with this mod, this has been fixed! Dragonplate armor now offers as much protection as Daedric armor used to, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Dragonplate armor is now better than Daedric :)\r\n\r\nEdit: this affect Dragonplate and Daedric shields as well",
