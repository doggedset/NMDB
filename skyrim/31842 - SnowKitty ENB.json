  "modName": "SnowKitty ENB",
  "summary": "This is a realistic (i.e., no saturated colors, no film effects, etc) ENB for Skyrim. Its meant to enhance the graphics that are already there, apply SMAA, and make things blend together in a more cohesive manner. ENB .144 or higher required!",
  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE: Low/Medium quality versions are in the works and coming soon. The settings found here are what I would consider \\\"high\\\" quality settings, and will likely be a 10-15FPS hit total over default Skyrim.\r\n\r\nENB settings that are meant to tie the game together and enhance what is already there, rather than replace it. There aren\\'t any grainy film effects, or vignettes (though those ARE really good when done properly), instead I\\'ve chosen to focus on making this look like what I think Bethesda could have done if this was a PC only title, rather than having to allow for consoles as well.\r\n\r\nENB .144 or higher required (.dll NOT included in download, grab it from the ENB homepage)!\r\n\r\nMods that I use (you\\'ll see these at work in my screenshots):\r\n\r\nUnofficial Skyrim Patch\r\nSMIM\r\nBetter Dynamic Snow\r\nGet Snowy\r\nTowns and Cities Enhanced\r\nWhiterun Trees\r\nCrimson Tide - Blood\r\nSkyrim Flora Overhaul\r\n\r\nThese are confirmed to work well with my ENB settings, since, well, I use them myself :) Any mod that changes or modifies lighting/shadows, such as Realistic Lighting or Climates of Tamriel will of course change how the ENB looks, as it does with any preset. That doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t make them work together, however, and if you DO use my ENB with any lighting mods please drop me a line and let me know! I\\'d love to figure out which mods it plays nice with and which ones it doesn\\'t. \r\n\r\nFinally, thanks for checking out my mod!\r\n",
