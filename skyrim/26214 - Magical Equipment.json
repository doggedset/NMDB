  "descriptionHtml": "ALL THE ITEMS ARE CRAFTABLE AT SKYFORGE! \r\nNOW THERE IS PERK REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH BOOK!\r\nMPORTANT! RELATED TO THE ARMOR SHOWN ON THE PICTURES!\r\nThat armor is \\\"Oblivionwalker Robe\\\" I am working on.\r\nIt\\'s pretty much completed, but I need to link it to Dawnguard before I can upload it.\r\nAnd I can\\'t do this before CK has been updated. (I heard a rumor that the update is going to be released on Monday)\r\n\r\nI\\'ve been modding for some time, but for the first time I created mod which I can publish into workshop. (No stuff used from other authors and so)\r\n\r\nI thought the idea is pretty nice and original, and I haven\\'t seen anything like this on Nexus or in Workshop so I wanted to publish this. \r\nThis mod is a collection of some of the ideas I got when played Skyrim.\r\n\r\nBasically this mod adds big books that can be carried on your back, couple of scroll quivers (Big and small), smaller books which are positioned on lower back and slightly tilted, and wearable weapons (just a couple atm) and in future maybe something more unique.\r\n\r\nALL THE ITEMS ARE CRAFTABLE AT SKYFORGE! \r\nNOW THERE IS PERK REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH BOOK!\r\nI AM NOT GOING TO INCLUDE ALL THE RECIPES HERE, GET THE PROPER PERK AND CHECK THEM YOURSELF AT THE FORGE! (To be honest, recipes will just clutter up description, and in my opinion it’s messy enough already)\r\n\r\nHere\\'s the current Equipment:\r\nWEARABLE BOOKS, note that requirements are same for big and small book, recipes may vary.\r\n\r\nConjuronomicon, REQUIRES ADEPT CONJURATION PERK\r\nFortify conjuration 10%, regenerate magicka 30% faster, conjurations last 20% longer, -30% health and stamina regeneration\r\n\r\nGreat Book of Destruction, REQUIRES EXPERT DESTRUCTION PERK\r\nDagon\\'s Wrath, Fortifies destruction spells by 10%, but makes you 10% more vulnerable to magic.\r\nAlso increases magicka by 30.\r\n\r\nBook of the Dragonborn, REQUIRED THAT PLAYER HAS UNRELENTING FORCE SHOUT\r\nSimiliar effect to amulet of Talos. Reduces shout recovery time. Works with amulet for greater effect, however reduces stamina regen rate by 25%. It must be exhausting to shout all the time.\r\n\r\nHealer\\'s Book, REQUIRES PERK APPRENTICE RESTORATION\r\nRestoration spells are 15% more effective and health regeneration rate by 35%. No negative effects. \r\n\r\nIllusion Book, REQUIRES ADEPT ILLUSION PERK\r\nIllusion spells are 20% more powerful (Though I am not sure what it means. Spells affect higher level enemies? Maybe.)\r\nFortify magicka rate 30%, No negative effects. (30% ain’t huge at later levels, and I have no idea if 20% better illusion spells actually affect at all.)\r\nAlteration Book, REQUIRES ADEPT ALTERATION\r\nFortifies armor rating by 45 (Enchantment, works with mage armors), Alteration spells last 15% longer, health regeneration reduced by 35%\r\nWearable Elder Scroll REQUIRES THAT THE PLAYER HAS “DRAGONREND- SHOUT”\r\nIncreases magicka by 50, Armor rating by 50, Magicka rate 25% and reduces HP regeneration by 50%, Couldn’t think of anything more unique for this one.\r\n\r\nBig and Small Scroll Bag, these serve as fine base for your own enchantments, don’t you think? REQUIRES THE PERK WHICH REQUIRES ENCHANTING OF 20 \r\n\r\nWEARABLE Mehrune’s Razor, Requires the real dagger now and it can be crafted back to weapon. \r\nIncreases destruction spell damage by 10% and makes you immune to poison.\r\n\r\nWearable Chillrend, TESTING! You should be able to make it if you have Chillrend Equipped, I am not sure if it works on every version of chillrend. (Chillrend is leveled weapon, and there is 7 different versions of it, so it’s not miracle if it does not work, but I want to test this)\r\nResist frost 20% and resist magic 5%, not huge deal. I’ll improve it later.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSO AVAILABLE ON NEXUS! (+ better description)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26214\r\n\r\nALSO CHECK OUT MY OTHER MOD ON NEXUS\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19904\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit:\r\nShadowjin, The only person who wants to carry cool magical book on his back\r\n\r\nDonation:\r\nLiked the mod? Want to support me? \r\nI don\\'t want REAL money for my work. I usually make stuff for myself, and it then grows to a real mod after a while, and my mods aren\\'t \\\"professional\\\" quality, but someone might still greatly enjoy my mods, and want to support me.\r\nI\\'ve been thinking, donating Guild Wars 2 money sounds like good way to express your feelings.\r\nMy In-game-nick is \\\"Archiemonde\\\",  (ID: Archie.2375), and there\\'s no minimum size for the donations. Also, I am funny guy and my guild is always looking for great people, so give me a PM in-game if you are looking for guild! \r\n\r\n\r\nI\\'M NOW ON WORKSHOP! \r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=105771871&searchtext=",
