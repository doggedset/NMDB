  "summary": "Adds a cooldown to power attacks. Prevents the lame spam till they die combat.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Seven second cooldown for power attacks. Was already written into the game and previously set to zero seconds. Seems to include power bash as well. It does not seem to affect npcs. Still uses normal stamina costs. You can still do normal bashes inbetween cooldowns. Leaves a 3-4 second window after you get a good stagger on an enemy.",
