  "summary": "Fixes stuck scene between Deor and Fanari after they are interrupted, and allows &#34;A New Source of Stalhrim&#34; to start.",
  "descriptionHtml": "During my current gameplay it happened again. I came to talk to Shaman of the Skaals after cleansing the stones, and saw that Deor and Fanari are stuck again&#33; No talking, no moving, just standing in front of one another and doing nothing. I remembered that last time, even after finishing &#34;A new Source of Stalhrim&#34; they were still stuck. \r<br />\r<br />First, I searched the Internet for a solution and a reason why it happens. It turned out to be a common bug, when Fanari and Deor are interrupted during the scene, they are just stuck in it. Apparently there was no solution to this problem than just re-load a previous save before the problem occured. But I thought: &#34;There must be some other way to fix that&#34;. And I think I found it. \r<br />\r<br />This mod triggers misc quest &#34;Ask Deor about Baldor&#39;s disappearance&#34; by talking to Fanari during the stuck scene. When you ask Fanari if something&#39;s wrong, both Deor and Fanari become &#34;un-stuck&#34; and you can start &#34;A new Source of Stalhrim&#34; by talking to Deor. \r<br />\r<br />This mod ONLY fixes this certain bug.\r<br />\r<br />REQUIRES DLC2 - DRAGONBORN\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Version 1.1:[/color]\r<br />- Deor will become &#34;un-stuck&#34; the moment you ask Fanari if something&#39;s wrong (not like before, when she finishes talking)",
