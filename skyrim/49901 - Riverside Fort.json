  "summary": "A huge fallen tree that has been taken over by bandits. It is now used as a camp for robbing the merchants and citizens of Riverwood&#33; (REDONE&#33;)",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hi&#33; This is my first sort of &#39;&#39;dungeon&#39;&#39; mod (Its more like a camp than a dungeon :/) It is a small bandit camp. In the camp there are three to four bandits, one of them is the boss, so be ready&#33; It is a good place for new players to get some gear before going off an saving (or destroying) Skyrim&#33; Oh, there is also a hidden secret for you to find&#33; (Its in the images, just look)\r<br />\r<br />How to get there:\r<br />Leave Riverwood and follow the road that leads to Whiterun, when you get to the second waterfall you will see a fallen tree, cross that and be ready for a fight&#33;\r<br />\r<br />To be added:\r<br />Maybe a secret hatch leading into a cave?\r<br />More decoration\r<br />\r<br />Bugs:\r<br />Sometimes the bandits will get stuck in a wall, the idiots can&#39;t find the way past it (Navmesh)\r<br />\r<br />But....whys is &#39;&#39;refurbished&#39;&#39;? \r<br />Well, when I uploaded it at first it was pretty barren, the NPC hadn&#39;t a clue how to move and it was not even navmeshed, also the textures were a mish mash of random things. But I went a head and made it waaay better&#33; There is now a wall and a few more bandits, as well as the boss. They are also patrolling the place, so be careful&#33; I still need to add a cave under it, but thats a job for another day&#33;",
