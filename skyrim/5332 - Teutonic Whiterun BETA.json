  "summary": "this was a request to make a Teutonic Type Armor city replacer.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Version 0.3.5\r\n\r\nuploaded an optional file where the \\'Standard Guards\\' have a new Teutonic Texture, so if you want, you can keep the longhouse and porch guards in Heavy Plate armor, but keep the city guards and outer settlement guards in Standard Armor with new textures! check the screenshots!\r\n\r\nVersion 0.3\r\n\r\nVersion 0.3 is up! the Texture\\'s are alot more \\'Weathered\\' and so dont look as bright and happy. these texture\\'s now finally cover females as well! after discovering rupture1212 was actually female, i figured female textures are pretty essential seeing as she requested this mod!!\r\n\r\nanyway, check the screenshots y\\'all!\r\n\r\nVersion 0.2\r\n\r\nVersion 0.2 is up now, check the screenshots to see the MUCH improved Textures, i no longer have to gag seeing the original HORRID textures i made....\r\n\r\nVersion 0.1 \r\n\r\nThis was a request by rupture1212, she requested that i make a teutonic looking armor and use it as a replacer for a city if possible, it took me a HUGE amount of time to find out how i could replace one cities armor without replacing another. but i finally figured it out. as a result of how long i\\'ve already spent doing research on this, i admit the texture is a bit crummy, which is why this is a BETA, i need to keep going on with my other requests and can\\'t just spend all my spare time on this, so it will likely be a while before its updated again. so heres the BETA.\r\n\r\nthanks to rupture1212 for an amazing idea and one i will surely be using alot in the future.\r\n\r\nUsing My Work:\r\n\r\nif for any reason you want to use any files associated with this mod, ask my permission. if i agree then when your done, send me a link to the mod and obviously credit me in the file description etc etc.\r\n\r\nCallaghan04",
