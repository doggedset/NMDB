  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve been playing Baldur&#39;s Gate and decided I wanted my favorite tank to follow me around Skyrim. Just a basic follower for now. He doesn&#39;t set off traps, doesn&#39;t affect your sneak meter, and is marriable. He is compatible with AFT and should be compatible with other follower mods. If not let me know and I&#39;ll try to fix it. You can find him in the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />He also dual-wields whatever you want, just take away his greatsword when you first pick him up. If you already have him, take away 2 handed gear and shields and he should dual-wield whatever is best in his inventory. \r<br />\r<br />Boo WILL be added, I&#39;m working on learning how & getting it worked out, really&#33; I want Boo too&#33; This is all really new to me, so it will take some time, but I really am working on it&#33; \r<br />\r<br />I also have Dynaheir and Imoen, and will add other BG party members as I finish them.\r<br />Dynaheir: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52177/?\r<br />Imoen: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52182/?\r<br />\r<br />Let me know if you have any issues or suggestions&#33;\r<br />\r<br />",
