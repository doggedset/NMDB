  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]IfPIkK7gbn4[/youtube]\r<br />[Transferred to Nexus from Steam Workshop . All credit goes to the author Sorrien on the Steam Workshop for creating this mod.]\r<br />\r<br />This is a spell mod that adds a destruction spell to the game called dismember. It blasts the target to bits, leaving only bloody bones and a satchel containing their inventory behind. The mod comes with a custom spell tome that can be found in Ilinalta&#39;s deep. In the first level of Ilinalta&#39;s deep there is a necromancer standing beside an altar with a skeleton laying on it. You can find the book is in the chest next to this altar. This entire platform that the necromancer stands on will be separated from you by water, it is a very recognizable spot. \r<br />\r<br />I just wanted to quickly thank everyone for the first 1,000 2,000 3000 subscribers&#33; Thanks guy, if this were an MMO you would get special pets or something(?) \r<br />\r<br />The dismember spell will instantly kill anything that is not a dragon for a relatively large amount of mana. For now the only things that actually have the &#34;bits&#34; effect have the NPC actor type, which is basically anything that looks remotely humanoid, but isn&#39;t undead. Everything else, that is not a dragon, will simply disappear in a blood effect. This largely due to the fact that I happened to find a complete set of human bloody bones already in the game. I do not have dawnguard and because of that I cannot use &#34;harkon&#39;s pile.&#34; \r<br />\r<br />If for some reason you cannot find the book or you are simply too lazy you can do this: \r<br />\r<br />press the tilde(~)key to open the console \r<br />type help dismemberment \r<br />type player.additem #forthebook 1 (#forthebook is where you put the number that the help command gives you, for the one that says it&#39;s a book) \r<br />\r<br />Compatibility: \r<br />The only part of the game this mod alters is Illinalta&#39;s Deep, and any other mod that also changes that area may have issues with this one. \r<br />\r<br />Bugs: \r<br />None currently known. Measures were taken to prevent bloated save files, and other issues.",
