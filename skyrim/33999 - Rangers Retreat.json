  "descriptionHtml": "are you tired of living in lush mansions, displayed as a king? wanting to get away to a quite and peaceful little place to call your own?\r\n\r\nwell, look no further. this cabin by the lake experience can now be yours! \r\n\r\ncooking station, plenty of chests, bedroom with storage, alch and enchanting stations, some plaques for your weapons and such. outside is the full work up for blacksmithing and upgrading (almost, no smelting station yet) a dining area to sit with your companion or spouse. NO TROLLS, i\\'d imagine they don\\'t fit. \r\n\r\nor, a vacationing home, just to get away? i\\'ll probably be expanding this at some point. a smelting area, and maybe a basement.\r\n\r\nthis is NOT, a treasure filled wonderland! this is NOT, \\'fit for a king\\'. this is a basic home, for players wanting to escape that life.\r\n\r\nlet me know what you guys think?",
