  "descriptionHtml": "More unique weapons that look like all the rest. I\\'ve done retextures on the Gauldur Blackbow and Blackblade to make their names more fitting and give them a more unique appearance, so it doesn\\'t feel like you\\'re just using another plain enchanted Draugr sword.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I\\'ve compiled a file with texture files in them, so if it doesn\\'t work, please excuse my ignorance over the subject, as I\\'m still trying to figure it out. If the textures are missing from the weapons, let me know and I\\'ll try to fix it. But otherwise, they shouldn\\'t be.\r\n\r\nThis is my first weapon retexture mod, and I think I\\'m very satisfied with the results.",
