  "descriptionHtml": "NEW RELEASE - NOCTURNAL\\'S FAVORED CHILDREN v2.0\r\n\r\nDue to popular demand, I sat down and made up a \\\"Daughter\\\" set of the armor for you.  I almost like how the Daughter armor came out better! The male armor got some updates such as better shading on the piping running through the armor.\r\n\r\nAlso, by popular demand, now featuring an option for each gender\\'s armor set to substitute the cape with the wonderful Torn Scarf Variant by AlphaDragoon!  You can find Alpha\\'s original file here: [url=\\\"http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1584\\\"]AlphaDragoon\\'s Torn Scarf Variant[/url]\r\nPay him a visit, give him an endorsement; he does sick work.\r\n\r\nInstructions for Install are the same as version one [you can just overwrite the v1 files or delete them manually first.  \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  You can only install the Cloak OR the Torn Scarf Variant of either gender at any one time as they would take each other\\'s space.  So choose what you want, unzip, merge that data folder in your Skyrim directory and if you want to try the other one out later, remove what you added and put the other one in. \r\n\r\nv1.0  NOCTURNAL\\'S FAVORED SON Nightingale Armor Textures Set\r\n\r\nReplacement Textures for the Nightingale Armor Set in Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim by Bethesda.\r\nTextures are double the stock resolution and are complete with bump and specularity maps.  Armor set is for male characters only.\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Ornate leather and metal scrollwork throughout\r\n- More realistic shading under cloak hood than stock textures\r\n- Entire cloak covered in stitching that follows how it is draped around character model.  Where the stitching meets in the back there is a 2 by 2 two cross-stitch to join everything up.\r\n- Ornate armor actually befitting of that deal you made for your soul with Noctural.  Now you can give finally burn that, \\\"I sold my soul to the Daedric Goddess of Shadows and all I got was this crappy T-Shirt,\\\" Tee and finally rob and murder Nords in style.\r\n- You have to admit, those boots are Capitol-P Pimp.\r\n\r\nTo Install:\r\nUnzip and drop \\\"data\\\" folder into your Skyrim directory.  Merge it with the pre-existing data folder there.  Start game!\r\n\r\nTo Manually Install:\r\n1> Find your Skyrim Directory and make this folder path under the Data subfolder\r\n.SkyrimFolder\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\nightingale\\\\m\\\\  < put .dds files in the \\\"m\\\" folder.\r\n2> Start Game.  The presence of the new textures in the proper directory path will override the stock textures. \r\n3> C-walk across entirety of Skyrim with your pimp self - rob everyone you come across.\r\n4> Profit.  Literally, you *are* a thief after all.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, simply remove .dds files from the filepath you created.  [But you don\\'t want to do that, looking as fantastic and terrifying as you do.]\r\n\r\nComments and feedback are appreciated.  If you download, and enjoy this I\\'d appreciate you coming back and giving me an endorsement and help this mod become a success here at Nexus.\r\nYou can see and hear other things I do @\r\nhttp://mikeomni.com\r\n\r\nThanks for your patronage, Nexus community!",
