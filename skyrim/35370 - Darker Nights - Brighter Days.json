  "modName": "Darker Nights - Brighter Days",
  "summary": "Applies a specific imagespace modifier depending on the game-hour. Allows for brighter days and darker nights.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The mod consists of a script and 24 imagespace modifiers. Every ten-ingame minutes a check is made on the current game-time. This leads to brighter days with 12:00-4:00PM being the brightest; as well as darker nights with 0:00-4:00AM being the darkest.\r<br />\r<br />The performance impact is negligible. If there is any fps loss, you&#39;re computer wasn&#39;t able to play Skyrim sufficiently to begin with (e.g, Pentium II).\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;d post pictures, but the difference will be different for everyone, due to various mods and injectors that modify the look of Skyrim. It&#39;s best for you to give this a shot yourself and judge whether or not you like the change.\r<br />\r<br />You may not notice the effect immediately. Wait for ten ingame minutes (Actual waiting; don&#39;t call up that blasted menu), and the appropriate changes will be made.\r<br />\r<br />There are no conflicts with this mod. So put it wherever in your load order.",
