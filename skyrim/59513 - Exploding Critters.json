  "descriptionHtml": "Exploding Critters Version 1\r<br />\r<br />Description/Location/whatever else\r<br />====================================================\r<br />This mod adds three new summons (Rabbit, Goat and Elk) that are based around the Flaming familiar found in the High Gate Ruin (If you completed it correctly).\r<br />\r<br />The spell books are located in the Thaumaturgist&#39;s Hut in Morthal, yes you&#39;ll have to steal them because I didn&#39;t bother messing with a merchant chest/leveled list for something so small.\r<br />\r<br />Conjuration perks that reduce the cost of summons effect these summons (Although their cost is rather low already).\r<br />\r<br />Requirement\r<br />====================================================\r<br />Nothing really other than a working copy of Skyrim. It is pretty self contained.\r<br />\r<br />Install\r<br />====================================================\r<br />Extract to your Skyrim Data folder and check the Exploding Critters.Esp in whatever mod manager you use (Wrye Bash, NMM, etc).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits, permissions and whatnots (in that order).\r<br />====================================================\r<br />Myself\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to do whatever you want with this, expand it, make it better or worse, patch it, translations I don&#39;t really care. Go wild to your hearts content. (Cathedral modding is much more community friendly than Parlor modding). \r<br />\r<br />If you do choose to do something with it, it would be nice to hear about it but its fine if I don&#39;t hear about it. \r<br />\r<br />Misc. Notes\r<br />====================================================\r<br />\r<br />They may have a sixty second duration but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND not casting them all willy-nilly like the average summon because they have a tendency to explode everywhere and yes their explosion hurts you too as well as any NPC in the wrong place at the wrong time. Its just how it works.\r<br />\r<br />Why I used the term Critter? Because I associate that term with the random wildlife found in older RTS&#39;s (Warcraft, Starcraft etc).\r<br />\r<br />On how much damage they do, Rabbit/45, Goat/50, Elk/100.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-Flintlocke.",
