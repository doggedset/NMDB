  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a lesser power, \\\"Dragon Reaver\\\", granted to the player upon completion of the main quest. From the description:\r\n\r\n\t\\\"Fueled by the soul of a slain dragon for 60 seconds, your health,\r\n\tmagicka, and stamina regeneration is vastly increased, you recover from\r\n\tshouts very quickly, and your combat and spell-casting effectiveness is\r\n\tdoubled.\\\"\r\n\r\nUsing this lesser power consumes one dragon soul from the player.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nPlace the contents of the archive in your Skyrim/Data directory. If you have already completed the main quest, you will need to give yourself Dragon Reaver in the console. Open the console and search for it (\\'help \\\"Dragon Reaver\\\" 0\\'). You will find two entries named \\'Dragon Reaver\\'. The one with the formID that ends in D62 is the one you want to add with player.addspell.\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\n\r\nIncompatible with mods that change the final quest of the main quest line. It is compatible with any mods that e.g. give the player perk points in exchange for dragon souls.",
