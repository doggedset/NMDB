  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Verdana][b]Race: [/b]Breton\r<br />[b]Class: [/b]Assassin, Archer, Duelist, Mage\r<br />\r<br />[i][size=1]Please understand that english is not my native language[/size][/i]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Personality and skills[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />   Aldren is a breton girl about 26 years old. She was trying to cross the border after her parents&#39; death, but ended up caught in an imperial ambush along with Ulfric Stormcloak. She is specially skilled with bows, swords, daggers, sneak, alchemy and conjuration, and became somewhat good at destruction magic after being turned into a vampire. Aldren hates to steal and to kill innocents, but secretly feeds on bandits to maintain her vampire powers.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Gameplay history (you can do it your way) - [/size][size=4]May contain spoilers[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />   After escaping Helgen with Hadvar, Aldren discovered that she was the Dragonborn. She, however, did not want to follow that path, and then ignored the Graybeard&#39;s call and joined the Companions, but decided not to become a werewolf, leaving then after a while. She headed to the Mages College, where she studied conjuration, with focus on weapons and atronachs. At some point of her life, she had contact with the Dark Brotherhood, discovering that she was the Listener and killing the emperor. After some time, she began regreting the murders she perpetrated, and joined the Dawnguard to redeem herself. Aldren met Serana, and they became close friends, traveling together even after Harkon&#39;s death. By Serana&#39;s advice, Aldren finally accepted her fate as Dragonborn, to the time she killed Alduin. As Alduin&#39;s soul could not be absorved, Aldren worried about he returning in the future, so she made the decision to become a vampire and wait for his return. As an immortal being, she began to collect daedric artifacts in order to keep them safe under her protection.\r<br />\r<br />[/font][b][font=Verdana][size=3]Required mods:\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/font][/b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?]Dimonized UNP Female Body - Base Main Body[/url] by dimon99\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12951/?]Enhanced Character Edit[/url] by ECE Team\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51602/?]Fair Skin Complexion[/url] by HHaleyy\r<br />SG Hair Pack 268 (google it) by Hello Santa\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35327/?]SG Female Eyebrows[/url] by Hello Santa\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?]The Eyes of Beauty[/url] by [b]Gabriel Mailhot as LogRaam[/b]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9717/?]Better Vampires[/url] by Brehanin\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38829/?]BVFE - Better Vampire Fangs and Eyes[/url] (no bloodshot eyes) by Aipex8 \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55524/?]Wa Ribbon[/url] by Higeyosi\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Recommended mods:[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22765/?]Helmet Toggle[/url] by Maniczombie\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13490/?]Vampire Face Fixes[/url] by bluedanieru\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34733/?]Clean Your Vampire - Dirt Removal[/url] by vertex\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16757/?]UNP Underwear Replacement[/url] by[size=2] Thunderroar[/size]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54416/?]Eye Normal Map Fix[/url] by Mr Dave\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55640/?]TDN Vampire Armor Retexture[/url] by Nightshade\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10753/?]Auto Unequip Ammo[/url] by Alek\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35303/?]Female Facial Animation[/url] by nao4288\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5711/?]Closer Quivers and Longer Arrows[/url] [size=2]by [/size][size=2]EvilDeadAsh34[/size]\r<br />[size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30936/?]RealVision ENB[/url] by SkyrimTuner or [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22056/?]RealLike ENB[/url] by s3b3k87[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Hope you like it ;)",
