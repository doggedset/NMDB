  "descriptionHtml": "v2 - Fixed Female voices with male bodies, aka \\\"transvestite voice bug\\\"\r\n\r\nWhile playing Skyrim, it has always made me slightly, vaguely uncomfortable after killing a female bandit. While actually fighting for my life, I rarely thought of it. \r\nLast night, while watching Gamespot\\'s \\\"top 5 mods\\\" videos, I opened up the CK for the first time and made this mod. It took maybe 15 minutes. \r\nIs it for everyone? No. \r\nIs the whole concept of Chivalry somewhat sexist? Just ask a Feminist: Of course it is. \r\nBut if the mod makes someone else less morally uncomfortable while playing than it is a worthwhile 15 minutes spent. \r\nIf I decide to continue, I will do the same for the Forsworn. \r\nWhy? Because you cannot decide not to fight either of those factions. \r\nIf you join the Dark Brotherhood you are making a conscious decision to kill anyone, etc \r\n\r\nIf I do Chivalry Forsworn, I may follow up with a Misogyny set of mods, that make all the automatically hostile factions female. And I would make it modular, so you can have all female Forsworn and all male Bandits. Might work on Vamps at that point. \r\n\r\nWhile making different regions all female and all male is technically possible, it would not be compatible with this mod, and would NOT be a 15 minute project. \r\n\r\nAlso, I am male, I am happily married, and my wife laughed when I told her about the mod. Take it as you will.\r\n\r\n<original description below>\r\nIf killing all those women has ever made you uncomfortable, this is for you.\r\nFirst version changes just the Bandits to males, later versions may work on other factions, such as the Forsworn.\r\nChanges no named NPC\\'s, just the run-of-the-mill bandits.\r\nAlso available on the workshop. Not an April Fools joke, and also not intending not intending to start a comment thread flame war. ",
