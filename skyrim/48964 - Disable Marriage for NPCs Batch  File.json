  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;m using Better Divine Blessings by lobotomy0 and Forgotten Magic Redone by  3JIou and sward66 so my amulet of Mara has worth and I&#39;m using it because my restoration spells can deal damage to all enemies.\r<br />I&#39;m a lonely person who has children. I don&#39;t want to be bumped with &#34;are you interested in me?&#34; So I made this file. This file contains all non-dlc npcs who can be marriageable ( males for now females will come)\r<br />\r<br />Some may want some may not. If you didn&#39;t like than don&#39;t download like other mods.\r<br />Installation drop to your &#34;C:Program Files (x86)SteamSteamAppscommonSkyrim&#34;\r<br />It would be best to have legal version of game.\r<br />Just open console and write &#34;Bat NoDLC&#34;\r<br />\r<br />BEWARE;This is NOT-reversible except another batch file which I won&#39;t release.
