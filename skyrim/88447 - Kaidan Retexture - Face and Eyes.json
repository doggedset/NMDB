  "summary": "A retexture for the male follower Kaidan.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I absolutely LOVE Kaidan. His quest and voice are so authentic, immersive, and lore-friendly. And his skin is also beautiful, but since I am obsessed with texturing characters, I added my male texture to be used by him. This skin has yet to be released, so think of this as a sort of 'promo' for it.\n<br />\n<br />The original mod is clearly required and can be found [url=https://rd.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86872?]here[/url].\n<br />Thank you so much to LizTempleton for releasing such an amazing follower, for all of us to love and cherish!",
