Then I noticed that there are no burrito models or textures available for Skyrim, so I slapped some together, and figured I&#39;d share. Download it or don&#39;t, I really don&#39;t mind.\r<br />\r<br />This simple mod adds two new recipes - burritos and a tasty fresh salad. They cannot be bought, only crafted. I know the model for the burrito is hollow, but it&#39;s based on the linen wrap so nothing I can do there. The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC.\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
