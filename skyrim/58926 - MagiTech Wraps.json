So I took the model and duplicated it, making minor tweaks in various things. One example is marking them as clothing gloves, enabling them to count for Frostfall&#39;s body coverage.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I liked the look of the Mystic Tuning Gloves used in the &#34;Out of Balance&#34; quest at the College of Winterhold, and was disappointed that I couldn&#39;t keep them.\r<br />\r<br />I took the model and duplicated it, making minor tweaks in various things. One example is marking them as clothing gloves, enabling them to count for Frostfall&#39;s body coverage.\r<br />\r<br />You can craft them at the Forge (under the Misc category) after you&#39;ve completed the quest. (PLEASE tell me if it doesn&#39;t work for some reason. I have no idea if the recipe will vanish after completing it a few times.)\r<br />\r<br />To craft them you&#39;ll need:\r<br />- 1 linen wrap\r<br />- 1 silver ingot\r<br />- 1 leather strip\r<br />\r<br />Very simple mod, separate files, no conflicts should occur. Any texture replacers will also effect these.",
