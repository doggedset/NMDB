  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r\n==========\r\n\r\nA retexture of the Emperor\\'s Robe, Psiijic Hood and Farmer Gloves 3 to complete a clothes set. It\\'s in the same style as I did for Morrowind and Oblivion. Fur is darkened and a green silk texture applied as a base with silver details. The boots used are vanilla.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will find the set on the porch of the Proudspire Manor in Solitude.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n===========\r\n\r\nTo install, you will need to unpack the files to the Skyrims data folder.  There are only two files in the archive, \\\"amels robe.esp\\\" and \\\"amels robe.bsa\\\". Here is mine as an example :\r\n\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n========\r\n\r\n0.5 Released\r\n0.6 Polished and darkened even further.\r\n0.7 More polish and the belt was made dark/black leather.\r\n0.8 Darkened fur even further. Fixed transperancy issue. Also added Psiijic Hood, Farmer Gloves 3 in the same theme.  Also, I made a seperate file with a darker green.\r\n0.9 Released on workshop. Upgraded to the Bethesda\\'s High-Res package textures and reddid the ones that were affected. Packed files in .bsa. Made an ESP.\r\n0.91 Made a black set on request.\r\n0.92 Made a red set on request.\r\n0.93 Made a purple set on request.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n====\r\n\r\nWith the others I did a complete set with amulet, sword etc. I\\'m still looking into which items I\\'d use for this. I\\'m hoping to import a custom made dragon amulet from Oblivion.",
