  "descriptionHtml": "In the Creation Kit, I found a body laying beside the \\\"Heddic\\'s Volunruud Notes\\\" in Volunruud. It turns out this is the owner of this journal, but because the \\\"Initially Disabled\\\" box is checked, he never appears where he\\'s supposed to be. It always bothered me that there\\'s actually supposed to be someone laying there beside the book.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not sure who would be interested in this mod, as it\\'s nothing too special, but I thought that a little fix for this issue would be appreciated by a few people who like simple little fixes like this.\r\n\r\nThis should work at any point in the game, whether you\\'ve started a new file or have already cleared Volunruud.",
