  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a storage hall with entrances to all of the hold&#39;s capitals. \r<br />\r<br />The hall has shelves for many different types of items and has places to store the special items you get (with thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4138425]skyrimlazz[/url]).\r<br />If it seems like you can&#39;t activate the special weapon displays, you have to point slightly in front of the display case. \r<br />\r<br />The [b][color=#ff7700][size=4]entrance [/size][/color][/b]of the room in [b][size=4]Whiterun[/size][/b] can be found if you enter the city and jump to the right, off the brige. You see a sewer-like entrance (they all look the same). The one in [size=4][b]Solitude[/b][/size] is ro your right when you enter the city. You can hardly miss it. The entrance in [size=4][b]Winterhold [/b][/size]is to the righthand side of the bridge to the college. The other are harder to describe, or I&#39;ve simply forgotten where they are myself... I will add pictures of them once I have the time for it.\r<br />\r<br />The special items you can store are:\r<br />Sanguine&#39;s Rose\r<br />Wabbajack\r<br />Skull of Corruption\r<br />Ebony Blade\r<br />Rueful axe\r<br />Mace of Molag Bal\r<br />Maehrunes Razor\r<br />Volendrung\r<br />Dawnbreaker\r<br />Spellbreaker\r<br />The dragonpriest-masks\r<br />Calavius Vile&#39;s mask\r<br />Miraak&#39;s mask\r<br />Other masks from Dragonborn\r<br />Namira&#39;s ring\r<br />Hincine&#39;s ring\r<br />All claws\r<br />All paragons\r<br />All jars with bugs\r<br />The three Elder Scrolls\r<br />All of the Black Books\r<br />Oghma Infinium\r<br />\r<br />The amount of other items to be stored are: (don&#39;t worry, it also has two chests to store the rest)\r<br />8 sets or armorr (there are 8 mannequins)\r<br />36 loose pieces of armor (I recomment only helmets, boots and gauntlets.
