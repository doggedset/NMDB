  "descriptionHtml": "First I\\'m Japanese, and not good at English. I\\'ll do my best, but please do not expect enough support.\r\nI\\'ve used many mods, and appreciate their authors.That\\'s why I made my own mod. \r\nThis pack is low quality, but I hope that my gratitude is conveyed.\r\n\r\n[Description]\r\nThis mod adds several weapons. You can craft at forges, and temper at grindstones.\r\n\r\nI won\\'t add katana, because there are many  awesome katana mods, and I want you to know \r\nthat there are more minor and interesting weapons in Japan.\r\n\r\n# Bamboo Blade 1hd, 2hd, kodachi(dagger)\r\ncategory wood  \r\ndamage steel\r\n\r\nThese are used in Kendo for practice instead of real katana.\r\n\r\n# Houzouinryu Jumonjisou\r\ncategory steel\r\ndamage ebony\r\nweapon type battle axe\r\n\r\nThis was invented by a monk \\\"Houzouin Kakuzenbou Inei\\\".

Masashige Kusunoki and Jube Yagyu used.\r\n\r\n# Kanasaibou\r\ncategory... steel\r\ndamage... ebony\r\nweaptype... war hammer\r\nanimation... war hammer\r\n\r\nJapanese think that Oni(like an ogre) uses this weapon. \\\"Oni ni kanabou(synonym)\\\" is a proverb  means making a strong person even stronger. \r\n\r\n# Masakari\r\ncategory... steel\r\ndamage... ebony\r\nweapon type... war axe\r\n\r\nMasakari is a general term about big axes. In an Japanese old tale and a nursery song, \r\na boy named Kintaro appears.?He had fantastic strength, mounted a bear like a horse, \r\nand used Masakari. When he had grown up, he followed Raikou Minamoto and defeated Syutendouji that was the strongest oni in Japan.\r\n\r\n# Naeshi\r\ncategory... steel\r\ndamage... ebony\r\nweapon type... mace\r\n\r\nNaeshi means losing one\\'s energy. You can break bones whether  enemies wear an armor or not.\r\n\r\n# Naginata\r\ncategory... steel\r\ndamage... ebony\r\nweapon type... battle axe\r\n\r\nNow Naginata is used mainly by women. In the latter term of  Heian period(1180~), \r\nNaginata was used as a main weapon by samurai and monks. But it gradua??? disappeared \r\nbecause spears were selected. Samurai class women learned for self defense. You may think \r\nNaginata is female weapon and can\\'t defeat a man with katana. But please check out Hideo \r\nSonobe. She lost only 2 times.\r\n\r\n# Sai\r\ncategory... steel\r\ndamage... ebony\r\nweapon type... mace\r\n\r\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles use this weapon.\r\nYou may misundestand that it is a ninja weapon.\r\nIt was used by Uhuchiku and Chikusaji(police officer in Okinawa) like a nightstick.\r\n\r\n# Bokutou(1hd,2hd,kocachi)\r\ncategory... steel\r\ndamage... ebony\r\n\r\nThere are many types each style of samurai.\r\nIt is used like a Bamboo Blade.
