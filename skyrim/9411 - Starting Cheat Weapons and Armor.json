  "summary": "Adds overpowered armor and weapons to both Imperial and Stormcloak starting rooms. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds very overpowered armor and weapons to both starting areas suitable for every class- From The Mage, Ranger, Thief, or Dual Wielding Rogue to the Warrior or Duel Wielding Berserker.  This is my first mod for Skyrim as some friends expressed interest in it. \r\n\r\n------Have also added the weapons to both Gerder\\'s and Alvar\\'s houses.  They are in strongboxes on top of chests. in each house.\r\n\r\nGlitches and bugs:  when using The Helm of Shadowed Thievery of course opening doors and attacking breaks the invisibility effect.  to gain it again all you have to do is dequip and equip the helm again.\r\n\r\nAnd like all my mods questions, comments and rude remarks are encouraged-  it\\'s how I get better.",
