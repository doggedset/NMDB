  "summary": "Adds a dialogue option for your follower which allows you to ask them to take off their clothes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very simple mod, which adds a new line of dialogue for your follower \\\"Let\\'s get naked!\\\"... \r\nWhat it does is:\r\nRemoves all items from your companion inventory, stores them into a safe hidden location, and so your companion will be completely naked. (or in undies, according to your body/textures mods of course).\r\nWhile your follower is naked if you talk to him/her again you can ask them to get their clothes back on.\r\n\r\nWorks well with \\\"Followers can Relax\\\" ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9504 )\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nIt is not designed to work with any mod that makes you have multiple followers, although it should work anyway but it cannot handle the storage of multiple followers inventories.",
