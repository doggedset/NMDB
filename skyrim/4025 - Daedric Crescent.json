  "descriptionHtml": "This was mostly me getting prepared for my 3D class next quarter, so it isn\\'t anything fancy. There are some things with this file you must know so you don\\'t flame out on me in the comments:\r\n\r\nI\\'ve never had to import or export .obj files before so if it doesn\\'t work let me know how to fix it and I will.\r\nThis was not intended to be a super-high poly count model.\r\nI have no idea how to do texture maps for Skyrim... If you could lead me to a tutorial that would be awesome :)\r\nHowever: I\\'m a 3D artist, not a 2D artist, so my texture skills are traumatically bad.\r\n\r\nThis took about 7 hours of work (which is really horrifying if you\\'ve ever done any modeling), works decently well as the greatsword animation (except for holstering), was built in 3D Studio Max 2012, and has about 900 polys.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nNow available in 1 poorly hacked together texture! Complete normal map (does it work? I don\\'t know!), the _m thing (all white because I don\\'t know what it does or how to build one), and a side of Spam. Blood edge? Yes it exists, no it doesn\\'t work. Behold my half-baked concoction! But seriously that\\'s why it\\'s a resource, not a mod.\r\n\r\nThank you to HackettMan, I hope I didn\\'t offend you by not using your texture... But I used the link to the tutorial you suggested!\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nA list of people who alerted me that they are (probably) using my crescent! This mod in particular may be dead, but at least I can point to other mods that have benefited from it.\r\n(If someone could tell me how to add links that would be awesome...)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7756\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13960\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19704",
