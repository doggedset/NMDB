  "descriptionHtml": "This is a replacer .esp for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21884/?]Thunder TNT&#39;s Craftable Vampire Armor[/url] mod, you NEED to install his mod FIRST then install mine&#33; This mod adds Enchanted variants of the Royal Vampire Mage Armor and Royal Vampire Mage Hood to be equal to the Arch Mage Robe and Hood. So the Mage Armor is enchanted to give you 15% reduction in spell costs for all magic schools and 100% magicka regeneration and the hood adds 50 magicka in the spirit of the college robes and hoods. But I don&#39;t just give this to you, oh no, you need to search far and wide to get the ingredients for it. It is doable, I have done it legitimately to test it can be done and if it works which it does. :D So good luck. Also, just like Thunder TNT&#39;s mod, it requires you to finish Chasing Echos, be a Vampire, and craft it at Castle Volkihar&#39;s forge. If I can find an easy way to transfer these armors into his other variants I&#39;ll upload those variants here as further drop in replacement plug ins. \r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Install [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21884/?]Thunder TNT Craftable Vampire Armor[/url] w/o the Overrides, just the Main File\r<br />Install my mod and tell NMM / MO to overwrite his esp.\r<br />Done&#33; Enjoy. :D\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Thunder TNT for his awesome mod and for giving me permission to upload this mod.\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for an awesome game. \r<br />",
