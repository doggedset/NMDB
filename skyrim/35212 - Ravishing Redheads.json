  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG] http://i1149.photobucket.com/albums/o581/Ulan_X/RedHeadsFinalDescriptionLogo.jpg [/IMG]\r\n\r\n[size=4] This mod adds six stunning redheads to your Skyrim game.  There are 3 females and 3 males who can all be located throughout Whiterun.  All followers will level up to level 85, will not impact on your stealth meter.  They are also of questionable moral standing so you may thieve and/or murder away. \r\n\r\nMelee and Ranger class followers come dressed in cozy furs while mages receive a basic robe.  All are provided with an appropriate basic weapon.  This is because well, they are poor and you are probably rolling in the Septims so don\\'t be tight and fork out for a decent set of armour for your new buddy (or swipe a set off a newly deceased corpse).\r\n\r\nAll followers can be married, but they are not marked as essential so be careful not to get them killed.\r\n\r\nThey have been tested with Amazing Follower Tweaks, Convenient Horses and Skyrim Redone.  If there are any compatibility issues please let me know.\r\n\r\nYou can locate them in the following locations:\r\n\r\nThe Drunken Huntsman\r\nWarmaidens\r\nThe Bannered Mare\r\nJorrvaskr\r\nTemple of Kynareth (x2) \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this mod feel free to endorse - its much appreciated! [/size]\r\n\r\n[IMG] http://i1149.photobucket.com/albums/o581/Ulan_X/RedHeadsFinalInstallationLogo.jpg [/IMG]\r\n\r\n[size=4] There are two versions of this mod available, the Vanilla Version which is just that - no additional mods required and the \\'Fancy\\' version which requires the Apachii Hair and Apachii Hair Male files (you do not require the Apachii Hair Female file).  \r\n\r\n1.

Install both ApachiiSkyHair.esm and ApachiiSkyHairMale.esm if you want to use the \\'Fancy\\' version\r\n3. Download this mod using the \\'Download with Mod Manager\\' button\r\n4.

I use the below mods in my every day gaming and Skyrim just wouldn\\'t be the same without the fantastic work provided by these people.  Be aware that some of the below mods contain adult material.
