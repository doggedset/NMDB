  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#ff00ff][size=4]Taking Halofarms lovely [/size][/color][color=#ff00ff][size=4]Eiries Ohmes-Raht Race and tweaked it to work for Race Menu. As title says this is Phase One meaning there are a few minor issues because I have no idea how to script at the moment. The first being is there will not be eyebrows. And some of the hairs the earrings stick out of her head like antenna&#39;s lol But you can indeed still create lovely character&#39;s as shown in my screens.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][color=#ff0000][size=4]INSTALLATION &gt;[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff00ff][size=4]I prefer to extract the archive and install and uninstall manually so I know what folders and files it changes but you can be lazy and use a mod manager of choice however, if something doesn&#39;t uninstall right and your Khajiit race doesn&#39;t return to normal then you didn&#39;t delete the necessary files. This DOES NOT overwrite anything on your PC it only overwrites the virtual BSA Skyrim files so none of these files will harm anything, cause CTD and such. My advice is to backup this folder just to make things easier for you if you want to revert back to the vanilla female Khajitt and also uninstall texture files (See uninstall guide). [/size][/color]\r<br />[img]http://funkyimg.com/i/2wr2w.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]ONCE IN RACE MENU &gt;[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff00ff][size=4]What I did in my screens was take a human head, in this case a Nord Race and sculpted her and such and added elf ears then moved them as high as I could to resemble kitty ears. Once I was happy I exported the head. (If you do not know how to Import and Export in Race Menu it is really easy and there are tutorials out there). Anyway I then selected the female Khajitt Race and imported the Nord head I had just made and poof. Currently in phase one you will have ten eye colors that I made two cat like ones and the rest are from Eyes of Beauty. You will have 3 KS Hair Do choices and bald the rest are as I mentioned oddball. Once in the Khajitt Race menu you have few options such as changing the mouth etc. So I recommend doing this before when exporting a human head. \r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]UNINSTALL &gt;\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ff00ff][size=4]I recommend extracting the rar (if you installed manual you already know this) and looking at what folders and files were used and then going and deleting them. If you installed using NMM or other mod manager they don&#39;t always uninstall everything so it&#39;s a good idea to check.\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]NOTE &gt;[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ff00ff][size=4]This mod changes the head mesh, but I used the vanilla female Khajiit head mesh so your choice of UNP or CBBE should not matter because it doesn&#39;t change the body, hands and feet meshes.\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]CREDIT&#39;S &gt;[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff00ff][size=4]First and foremost a bow to the creator of this race Halofarm&#33; If you prefer the ECE version which is way better than mine check here.[/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://mod.dysintropi.me/eiries-ohmes-raht-race-v1-1/]Eiries Ohmes-Raht Race v1.1 by Halofarm[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff00ff][size=4]Also used by Halofarm was his poses and screenshot environments also found on his site.[/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://mod.dysintropi.me/category/poses/]Halo’s Poser S1.6 by Halofarm[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://mod.dysintropi.me/aether-suite-3-5-0-operation-helheim/]Aether Suite 3.5.0 – Operation Helheim by Halofarm[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?]KS Hairdos - Renewal by Kalilies Stealthic Khaos and Shocky[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?]The Eyes Of Beauty by Gabriel Mailhot as LogRaam[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13457/?]Face Light by tktk[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://enbdev.com/index_en.html]ENB Series by Boris Vorontsov[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83091/?]Antique Dragon ENB by ZwabberdieBo[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://nsfwmods.com/files/file/165-unpb-uunp-transparent-lingerie/]UNPB, UUNP TRANSPARENT LINGERIE 1.0.0 By Doublezero[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]Nifskope\r<br />Nexus\r<br />Skyrim[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/center]",
