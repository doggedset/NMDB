  "descriptionHtml": "New in Update 1.5:  These are now craftable at a cookpot with common alchemy reagents.  Consult the cookpot \\\"Misc\\\" category for recipe details.\r\n\r\nThis is a custom bodypaint map for the Caliente female body mesh/UV map.  The .esp file modifies female Forsworn to wear it instead of the Forsworn cuirass.  The simplest way to make this distributable and avoid any file version conflicts was to just have my own set of NIF files that are only used by this mod.  Available separately is the PSD file I worked from if you wish to blend the bodypaint over a different skin diffuse/specular map instead - I\\'m not offering any support on how to do that, look into how to modify texture files if you wish to try it for yourself.  There may be a better way to configure this such that only the bodypaint map is overlaid onto the existing skin map but I couldn\\'t find a working alternative.\r\n\r\nSee Optional Files for a couple of extras, craftable \\\"cloth\\\" versions of the Forsworn armor pieces and \\\"bare feet/bare hands\\\" pieces, which can be enchanted.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nSimply extract the contents of this archive into Skyrim\\'s data directory as any other mod and make sure the \\\"Forsworn Woad Caliente.ESP\\\" file is selected in the Skyrim loader\\'s Data Files menu.  \r\n\r\nQ and A:\r\n\\\"Where do I find these things?\\\"\r\nGo beat up female Forsworn.  If your game is already in progress, any newly-generated Forsworn should start using these.\r\nUpdate in 1.5:  How do the Forsworn make these in the first place?  Well now these can now be crafted at a cookpot with various alchemical reagents.  Each color has a slightly different recipe.  Check a cookpot in the \\\"Misc\\\" category for details.\r\n\r\n\\\"What armor type are these?\\\"\r\nEssentially they\\'re counted as Clothing, with zero armor rating and covering the BODY slot.  They can be mixed with other armor types, e.g. gloves and boots, as long as those also fit the Caliente body.\r\n\r\n\\\"Does this fit the CBBE/Slim/Vanilla body?\\\"\r\nAll three meshes are implemented and are selected randomly, along with six colors.  So if you wanted e.g. the Slim body with blue color, well I guess you have a whole bunch of Forsworn to beat up so you\\'d better get on with it hadn\\'t you.\r\n\r\n\\\"Does this replace the Forsworn cuirass armor/mesh?\\\"\r\nNo, it loads alongside it just fine.  Male Forsworn still drop the cuirass\r\n\r\n\\\"Can Khajit/Argonians wear this?\\\"\r\nI don\\'t know and I don\\'t care.  Mainly this was just done for fun and I don\\'t think I want to inflict the pain on myself to make it work overlaid on the khajit fur/argonian scales maps.\r\n\r\n\\\"Doesn\\'t it get cold wearing just woad in Skyrim?\\\"\r\nPah!  Milk-drinker!  THE REACH BELONGS TO THE FORSWORN!\r\n\r\nHave fun!",
