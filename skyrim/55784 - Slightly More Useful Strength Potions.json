  "descriptionHtml": "[b]NOTICE: [/b]As I have decided to no longer maintain Legendary Edition versions of my mods, this mod is now formally unsupported and unmaintained.\n<br />\n<br />A sadly necessary bit of boilerplate. The Nexus is the only legitimate location where you should find this mod. If you find it in any other location, particularly if that location has required you to pay to be able to download the mod, be aware that someone who isn't me is providing unauthorised (that is, pirated) and unsupported goods and you should avoid them. It might be nice to tell me about it too :)\n<br />\n<br />Strength potions in Skyrim have always annoyed me. Maybe I'm too hung up on the word \"Strength\" here, but I've always felt that they should do more than allow you to carry more (something which I don't find particularly useful in-game). If you are stronger, I feel that you also ought to be able to hit a little harder with a blade and draw back a little more with a bow.\n<br />\n<br />So I made this mod. What it does is take the Strength potions and add extra fortify effects to them. The intent is still that the primary benefit is to increase the amount you can carry, but there is also a short-lived very small enhancement to your weapon skills too, as if the potions have a first flush of potency that quickly wears off. Even the strongest of these extra enhancements is nowhere near as strong as you would get from even the weakest of the proper Warrior, Sure Grip and True Shot potions, but I think is enough to give you a very slight extra edge without becoming unbalancing and make them worth keeping around.",
