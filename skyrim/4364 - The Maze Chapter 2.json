Can you defeat it to earn the reward at the end? Good luck.\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#FF0000\\\"]**For testing purposes and ease of use I have made the zone in Breezehome. Zone into breezehome and you will be in the Maze. QUEST is a note, it\\'s in the Display case. Your house will be fine, when you done the quest, turn off this plugin.**[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#FF0000\\\"]**THIS IS NOT your typical Skyrim quest, the quest is done in notes, in this case it\\'s just a maze, there is a starting note, then you clue in and do what the note says etc.. other then that it\\'s more of an adventure then a quest, much like a vanilla journal you find in a dungeon**[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#FFF\\\"]**Please let me know of any issues you had during this maze.. Doing these things is very hit and miss ATM and feedback is really needed on testing.**[/color]\r\n\r\nThe maze starting area is much like you find in Fable, as you progress through the chapters you will find the starting area gets bigger and more decorated, chapter 2 has bookshelves in one door that will include books of the lore of each chapter as you finish them. Not much is known of Chapter 1 so the book is empty, for now.\r\n\r\nThe maze itself is difficult and will progressively become more and more difficult as the chapters progress.\r\n\r\nObviously once CK hits this will become much harder then it currently is, ATM it is a fairly hard maze with a decent reward at the end, eventually this will include traps/mobs etc. Downloading as usual is a form of testing more then anything, there are issues because this kind of modification wasn\\'t meant to be possible at this point. \r\n\r\n[b]Chapter 2 issues:[/b]\r\n- CTD when zoning out of Maze.\r\n\r\n[b]Chapter 3:[/b]\r\n- New maze, new reward\r\n- Much more maze clutter/decoration\r\n- Bug fixing\r\n\r\n[b]Support:[/b]\r\n- Contact me at Fusromod.com or at shawk@shaw.ca\r\n\r\n[b]Install:[/b]\r\n- Install plugin to Data folder, play.. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
