  "summary": "Adds the ability to craft a multitude of different explosive arrows if you have the right materials",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever felt like you needed some extra firepower to knock out those filthy thalmor?\r\nWell the Dwemer had the right mindset when they invented this advanced hi explosive arrow to their arsenal. Set your sights on that Dwemer ruin and go gather supplies because crafting these bad boys require some rare materials. Most of them youll find down in the dark Dwemer ruins but the crafting index sort of spoils that already :).\r\n\r\nwell either way. Like Ive said already, this mod adds a few craftable arrows to the game. Ive tweaked and worked on it a little to make them as lore friendly as possible via crafting materials and not too overpowered. or well they are powerfull arrows but youll only craft one at the time so you better resupply when you need them.\r\n\r\nArrows so far are:\r\n1. Explosive Arrow. The dwemer pyromancers discovery of explosive material were quick to put this new mixture into hi explosive arrows.\r\n -This arrow explodes on contact, dealing damage and knocking foes flat on their asses.\r\n\r\n2. Incinerator Arrow. Again the dwemer pyromancers obsession with fire and incineration led them to create a highly flamable liquid which could be put in a canister and mounted onto an arrow resulting in the birth of the Incinerator Arrow.\r\n -This arrow explodes on contact, dealing damage and setting foes on fire and anyone who walks where the arrow first exploded.\r\n\r\n2. Frost Arrow. The discovery of a cold explosion by a team of wandering nord alchemists made them think about recreating their discovery and put the effect on long range warfare. the result is the Frost Arrow.\r\n -This arrow explodes on contact, dealing damage and slows foes down while dealing frost damage.\r\n\r\n***************\r\nInstallation\r\n***************\r\nSimply download the file, extract the archive, copy the plugin to your Data folder and activate through nmm (at least it should be that simple)\r\n\r\nthis mod shouldn\\'t conflict with any other mods out there but do tell me if it does and I\\'ll see what I can do.\r\n\r\nv1.2\r\nUpdate with anorher craftable Incinerator Arrow to the game.\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\nUpdate with another craftable Frost Arrow to the game.\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\nInitial release. Adds a craftable explosive arrow to the game.\r\n",
