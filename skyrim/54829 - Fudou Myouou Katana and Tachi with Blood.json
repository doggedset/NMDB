  "descriptionHtml": "Because I wanted the Fudou Myouou Katana and Tachi to replace certain weapons in my game, I wanted to add blood meshes to them.  So I managed to with a heaping amount of web browsing and trial and error on my noobish part.  And I blurted it out on the forums... and then people started asking for them.  So here they are, with YYK&#39;s permission, of course.  Now you can get these beautifully shiny blades all nice and bloody... if that&#39;s what you&#39;re into.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: Install the original [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53872/?]Fudou Myouou Katana and Tachi[/url] before installing these new meshes.\r<br />\r<br />BTW, I just gotta say it, YYK... the work on these blades are BEYOND OUTSTANDING.  You and your team are ARTISTS&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy.",
