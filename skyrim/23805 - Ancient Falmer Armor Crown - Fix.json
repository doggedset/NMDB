  "summary": "The crown is now light armor and works with matching set custom fit and has 16 base armor rating (like a glass helm).",
  "descriptionHtml": "V2 = \r\nnow added the Helmet to Arch-Curate Vyrthur\\'s inventory, so when you collect the Ancient Falmer Armor from him the crown is also there. I couldnt get it to show on his character because I\\'m a spaz.  NOTE: just making sure you guys know. The helmet is upgraded with elven smithing. Just like the rest of the ancient falmer armor.\r\n=======================================================================================\r\n\r\nAlright, I searched around a bit and couldn\\'t find this mod so I made it myself.\r\n\r\nBasically the crown is a hidden item, unobtainable in game unless you use a console command (provided below).\r\n\r\nThe crown is originally a circlet with no armor rating.\r\nThis mod gives it an armor rating (same as a glass helm) and ensures that it works with the matching set and custom fit perks.\r\n\r\nAlso I\\'m fairly sure it can be upgraded normally, just like the rest of the set.\r\n\r\nHere is the console command to receive this helmet \\\"player.additem XX0c814 1\\\" without the quotation marks. Replace the XX with this mods load order on your mod list thingo.",
