the meshes and textures are still needed from the original mod , everything else is changed .  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />           loved the sets from yurica&#39;s mod kisetsu kimono ... i tweaked them while following a particular approach to do that , wanted these armors to accompany me while leveling and to remain useful at high levels while having to do a lot of adventuring to be able to craft them ...\r<br />\r<br />           how did i tweak the sets ? , well [b][color=#f4f4f4]first[/color][/b] i changed the armor values for the various sets and made every set different from the others in those values , the sets where named haru natsu aki fuyu and violet , i left the names and the colors as they were but gave some more meaning to the order of the sequence , so now the first set &#34;haru&#34; has an armor value similar to the leather set but more powerful , its like a first tier in the sequence , the &#34;aki&#34; one is like a second tier with the different color and more armor ratings its a bit more powerful then the elven one , the &#34;natsu&#34; represents the third tier it falls into the advanced armors category with a new color and more armor ratings , the fuyu is the fourth tier and belongs to the glass category in ratings but also more powerful then the glass set , the violet set is the ultimate tier more powerful then the dragonscale one .\r<br />\r<br />          they are more powerful then their respective categories but they are much more difficult to craft and temper , as i changed [color=#f4f4f4][b]secondly[/b][/color] the respective recipes for crafting and tempering , this way you&#39;ll need to do much more adventuring and maybe some shopping to get the materials to be able to craft them , each set now have its own different recipe to suit its category .\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4][b]          third[/b][/color] i made the sets to be crafted at the forge as they now needs some materials that i didnt see fit anymore for the tanning rack .\r<br />\r<br />          [color=#f4f4f4][b]fourth [/b][/color]i added a new req. for all the sets after &#34;haru&#34; the first one in the sequence which doesint have one , to craft &#34;natsu&#34; you now need the elven perk (smithing tree) , to craft the &#34;aki&#34; you need the advanced armor perk , to craft the &#34;fuyu&#34; you need the glass perk , and to craft the &#34;violet&#34; you need the dragon one , why did i add these req. ? , well because i believe that it doesint make any sense and that its game breaking that you can craft a set more powerful then the glass set or the dragonscale one from the game beginnings ... progression of abilities and adventure .\r<br />\r<br />          [color=#f4f4f4][b]fifth[/b][/color] i tweaked some of the sets (see description below) so they come now already enchanted when you craft them , and that in different styles to suit the different ways of playing the game (you can use the unenchanted versions if you dont like that or use a tool to disenchant the ones you like their enchantments to be changed) .  \r<br />\r<br />         [color=#f4f4f4][b] six[/b][/color] i added the various versions in two groups for different play styles .\r<br />\r<br />          all sets are to be crafted at the forge under miscellaneous , the ones that req. a perk will appear there only after you buy  the needed perk , they are all temperable .\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />          the crafting as i said above is much more difficult then in the original esp , that to compensate the higher armor rating values ... , and to give more purpose to adventuring , the whole work is to allow you to enjoy those beautiful sets at any level , feel a sense of progression with the different colors and to have some more competitive and lovely sets at high levels . well its a bit like a color/resistense/power/progression journey that begins with the spring purple ... to reach the ultimate violet after the winter white , i like it .\r<br />\r<br />          some of the already added enchantments will give some of the low level armor rating pieces a new purpose and that to make them still useful after advancing in the game , the various enchantments are not overpowered but interesting so you&#39;ll find useful to combine some lower pieces with some higher ones for different purposes ... \r<br />\r<br />          as i said above eight versions are included in the download , you only need one , they are in two groups (readme included in the download) .\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />the first group (normal) includes four version :\r<br />\r<br />1- base normal version (no enchantments) \r<br />2- normal general oriented enchantments where the various pieces comes already enchanted in a way to suit a non specialized way of playing .\r<br />3- normal generally thief oriented enchantments (for thieves)\r<br />4- normal generally mage oriented enchantments (for mages)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />armor ratings normal sets :\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />the purple &#34;Haru&#34; set , no perk needed .\r<br />body  29 \r<br />hands 9 \r<br />feet  9 \r<br />\r<br />the red &#34;Aki&#34; set , needs the elven perk .\r<br />body  33 \r<br />hands 10 \r<br />feet  10 \r<br /> \r<br />the yellow &#34;Natsu&#34;
