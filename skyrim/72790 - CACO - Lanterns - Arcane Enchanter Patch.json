  "summary": "A tiny little patch the changes the requirements for building the arcane enchanter in Hearthfire homes from needing beeswax to using candles instead.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I created this tweak for my personal use, but feel others may find it useful.  \r<br />\r<br />I was stuck in my recent playthrough with crafting an arcane enchanter for Lakeview Manor.  Since I could not find any honeycomb anywhere for the beeswax (A change by CACO), I figured it would be far easier to use candles as I can easily craft then with the normal loot obtained from Hunterborn (along with the Candles and Lantern patches)...  So, this patch was created.  I can now finally finish up my home.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod simply changes the Hearthfire crafting recipe for the arcane enchanter from requiring beeswax (Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul) to using Candles (Candles and Lanterns).\r<br />\r<br />I recommend placing this after both CACO and Candles and Lanterns.  Since this solely changes the Hearthfire buildable object, it should not conflict with any other mods.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Required Mods:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69306/]Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28377/]Candles and Lanterns[/url]",
