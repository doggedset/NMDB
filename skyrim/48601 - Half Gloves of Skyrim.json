I&#39;ve tried to fix this multiple times but the CK keeps reverting the gloves back to red. If any of you could try to fix this, I&#39;ll be in your debt.[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Thank you izon87604 (Nozi87) and DustReviews for featuring this mod in your video&#33; \r<br />Half Gloves of Skyrim begins at 2:19\r<br />[youtube]1bmCOk8I8dc[/youtube]\r<br />This video depicts v1.0 of this mod. \r<br />\r<br />Half Gloves of Skyrim begins at 2:46\r<br />[youtube]G1OshdrdSZg[/youtube]\r<br />This video depicts v1.0 of this mod. \r<br />\r<br />[/center]\r<br />[size=7][color=#B8860B]Description[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Whenever I played my archer character on Skyrim, I&#39;ve always felt like something was missing. It just didn&#39;t seem right drawing an arrow while wearing thick padded gloves. I looked around for a half glove or fingerless glove mod, and I just couldn&#39;t find one&#33; So I decided to give it a go and ended up making a glove in four color variants (brown, black, white, grey) and added them to the game. \r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod so please go easy as I am just now getting familiar with the Creation Kit and all that :3\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=7][color=#B8860B]Crafting[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />The gloves can be made in the tanning rack. You can find it under the MISC section and it will cost 1 leather to craft these gloves. Since the 1.1 update the gloves now have a leathery look after I redid all the textures. They are the same 512x512 textures but I will see about doing them in 1024x1024 later on.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=7][color=#B8860B]Installation[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />You can use Nexus Mod Manager to install this or if you are feeling ambitious you can extract the .rar file into your Data folder in your Skyrim directory. Make sure HalfGloves.esp is checked off in the DATA section of SkyrimLauncher.exe before you start up your game&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=7][color=#B8860B]Past and Future Updates[/color][/size]\r<br />v1.0: Original fabric half gloves\r<br />v1.1: Leather retexture of half gloves\r<br />v1.2 (future): Both leather and fabric gloves will be available for crafting.\r<br />v1.X (future): ???\r<br />v2.0 (future): Gloveless bracers from various armor sets (hide, leather, iron, steel, etc) equipped in a separate slot to allow you to mix and match bracers and half gloves.",
