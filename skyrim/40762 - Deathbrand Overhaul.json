  "descriptionHtml": "I didn\\'t like how Deathbrand armour was only light. I understand WHY it was light, but the enchantments on it were something I really wanted to use, but my light armour skill was low.\r\nTherefore, I created this.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n+ You can take the original light version to a forge and craft it into it\\'s heavy variant (using Stalhrim).\r\n+ You now only need to wear 3 pieces of the set for the full bonuses. (Including the +100 Armour Rating)\r\n+ The fortify one-handed enchantment no longer requires you to be dual wielding.",
