  "descriptionHtml": "Firstly this file contains ini settings that should be mostly universal for ENB&#39;s, namely Springtime ENB because that is what ENB I am using currently\r<br />\r<br />This ini originally contained a new command line that I thought would help to fix crashes &#34;GiveFirstBornToSheson&#34;. This was just a joke, and the members of Nexus were kind enough to point this out to me. Thanks guys&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; For anyone who downloaded this before I caught the error, I am deeply sorry for the misinformation. If you did happen to download this INI file with the &#34;GiveFirstBornToSheson&#34; you have nothing to worry about. Since the command does nothing it should not effect your game at all. The article where I originally found this hoax is below. \r<br />\r<br /> http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=2729\r<br />\r<br />If you do need a fix for the memory blocks getting used up and Skyrim Crashing I think I found a solution on Nexus, the link is below. Be sure to read the mod page for all the information. Again I think this is a fix for the problem, but I could be wrong. \r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50471/?\r<br />\r<br />One last time the new INI file does not contain &#34;GiveGirstBornToSheson&#34; and it should bea universal INI setting for most ENB&#39;s. I am really sorry for the confusion I created.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />V2:\r<br />This is just a small update to the original for those that use grass mods.\r<br />[Grass]bAllowLoadGrass=0 bAllowCreateGrass=1 bDrawShaderGrass=1iMinGrassSize=20",
