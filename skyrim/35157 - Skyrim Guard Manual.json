[/i]\r\n\r\n[size=5][b][color=#1BE042]For those who keep getting the error due the bug in 1.0.1, and have no idea how to fix this with NMM: \r\n\r\nGo to the folder where NMM stores the mod-files.\r\nIn my case this is E:\\\\Games\\\\Nexus Mod Manager\\\\Skyrim\\\\Mods\r\n\r\nNow you see all the mods you downloaded in archive format, now locate: [/color][color=#EBEB23] [i]Skyrim Hold Guards Patch-35157-1-0-1beta.zip [/i] [/color][color=#1BE042]\r\nRemove the file. Now the next time you start your NMM up, the error is gone!...at least for my mod. :)\r\n\r\nI\\'ve changed the version so you can see this message, but there\\'s no update..yet! [/color]\r\n[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a PREVIEW of version 1.1, it has already a nice start, and a little bit of a preview for my newest project The Elder Books.  ::-> When asking to upgrade the previously version, click on NO! Remove the older installation of this mod, it\\'s not like it will conflict, but just do what I say okay? \r\n\r\nIt has been made up again from scratch, so uninstall Skyrim Hold Guards Quotes since this has a total new ESP and name and all that.\r\n\r\n[b]Development changelog:[/b]\r\n1.0.3.0 - May 6, 2013 \r\nMade the first book of the mod\r\n\r\n1.0.3.1 - May 7, 2013 \r\nWrote the text inside the book\r\n\r\n1.0.3.2 - May 10, 2013\r\nCreated the second book.\r\nWrote the text inside.\r\n\r\n1.0.3.2B - May 10, 2013\r\nBeta testing...\r\n\r\n1.0.3.3 - May 10, 2013\r\nFixed some issues in the first book with text not displaying properly on the pages.\r\n\r\n1.0.3.4 - May 15, 2013 \r\nCreated the third book.\r\nWrote the text of the third book\r\n\r\n1.0.3.5 - May 17, 2013\r\nAdded the books in the world, you can find them in Whiterun.\r\n\r\n1.0.3.5B - May 18, 2013\r\nBeta testing...\r\n\r\n1.0.3.6 - May 18, 2013\r\nFixed the display issues with the second and third book. \r\nMade a building in the world: This will be in a new .ESP file that is still being created! This version is CLEAN in Skyrim except for the Whiterun Guard House, I changed some things inside, but it\\'s still as clean as possible!\r\n\r\n1.0.3.7 - May 19, 2013\r\nCreated the End book\r\nAdded all books in the world, properly placed them.\r\n\r\n1.0.3.8 - May 20, 2013\r\nFixed display issues in all the books, re-wrote some text inside the books.\r\nMade an NPC inside the world. With (hopefully) a not-yet-working Quest. \r\n\r\n1.0.3.8B - May 20, 2013\r\nBeta testing....\r\n\r\n1.0.3.8 - May 20, 2013 (After Beta test)\r\nNothing! :) All fine. NOTE: The NPC has NO voice yet for the custom dialogue, but she\\'s a polite girl so she\\'ll greet you and stuff. But the actual dialogue she has does not contain a voice, but forces subtitles until then! \r\n\r\n1.0.3.9 - May 22, 2013\r\nImproved the books a little bit.\r\nRe-wrote a few books.\r\n\r\n1.0.4.0 - May 26, 2013\r\nCleaned up the mod from accidentally made dirty edits.\r\nFixed issues with parsing\r\nChanged Alicia\\'s text.\r\nAdded a few new books. \r\nStarted working on a \\\"palace\\\" of the ancient guards.\r\n\r\n1.0.4.1 - May 27, 2013\r\nCleaned up the mod from accidentally made dirty edits again (I really need to stop working non stop for too many hours)\r\n\r\n1.0.4.2 - May 29, 2013 \r\nChanged a few things with the books.\r\n\r\n1.0.4.3 - June 1, 2013\r\nFixed a few issues with the text inside the books.\r\n\r\n1.0.4.4 - June 3, 2013\r\nAdded more dialogue options to Alicia.\r\nFixed a few bugs that apparently were added by Creation Kit or something I don\\'t know. \r\nFixed a few clipping issues with the books.\r\n\r\n1.0.4.5 - June 4, 2013\r\nTook a development break to work on Think to Yourself Quest Objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Production Change log:[/b]\r\nv1.0.3:\r\n- Wrote all the books, except for a few, those are still being created. \r\n- Added an NPC.\r\n- Let them spawn in Whiterun Guard House\r\n- Successfully passed the beta test.\r\n\r\n[b] Un-install & Manual Install [/b]\r\nTo Uninstall, simply de-activate the mod in Nexus Mod Manager, or if you don\\'t use Nexus Mod Manager:\r\nGo to your Skyrim folder,\r\nGo to Data\r\nRemove \\\"GuardManual.esp\\\"\r\nGo to meshes -> clutter \r\nRemove the folder \\\"books\\\" \r\nNow go back to Data,\r\nGo to textures -> clutter -> books \r\nRemove \\\"booksax\\\"\r\n\r\nIf you prefer not to mess around with textures etc etc, just simply remove the .esp file, and you won\\'t notice the book-meshes & textures at all actually. \r\n\r\nTo manual install the mod, place everything inside your Data file. \r\n\r\n-> The Seq folder is used for the dialogue the NPC has, this is required since version 1.6.\r\n\r\n[b]Permissions[/b]\r\nYou may use my mod in your own mod as long as you give credits to me. \r\n\r\n\r\n-- If you are interested in voice acting for my NPC let me know please. :) \r\n---- Any mod that changes the interior of Whiterun Guard House MIGHT conflict with this mod, but I\\'m not sure. ( I have one, but it doesn\\'t seem to conflict with mine.. maybe others might? )\r\n------ If you don\\'t like silent NPCs, then don\\'t talk to Alicia. \r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=#4876FF]Credits[/color][/b][/size]\r\nBethesda: Creationkit and Skyrim.\r\nAxhoff: For allowing users to freely use the book cover textures. \r\nSkyrim Wikia:  Although I wrote the new books myself now, without copying anything, I will be using the quotes they have listed for the guards.\r\nXxbtztrl: For helping me out with the spawn in the world-stuff when I just started.\r\nForleyor: For helping me out with the NPC things.\r\nArthmoor: For providing the tutorial on how to create the SEQ file. \r\nThe users: For using my mod. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\nAlso, have fun reading this, I\\'ve made it together with my girlfriend ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/6725705 ) so props to her for helping me with writing this!\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n--- >> Story introduction for my newest project  << ----\r\n[size=4][b][color=#D7DF01]The Elder Books[/color][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThe Elder Books are mysterious but very powerful books that were created before the First Era. They are sealed away for Tamriel\\'s safety. Alicia, a Vampire traveller, has found one of them during the Oblivion Crisis. She doesn\\'t know who created them, why they have been created, what power they contain, and what \\\"The end of Tamriel and all her people\\\" could possible mean.\r\n\r\nAll that she knows is that the book she found is not the only one, and that the books must not fall in the wrong hands. Because this could mean the end of Tamriel and all her people.  Only you, the Dragonborn, can discover the secrets for the good... or bad. \r\n\r\nIn this adventure, you will meet new friends... and enemies. New obstacles, cities, and information about yourself will be discovered, find out who you really are, what you really are, and unlock your true powers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone interested in helping with the mod, message me for my Facebook (or Skype but Skype\\'s been messed up lately), and those who want to become beta testers can shoot me a message too.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe old Description: \r\n[color=#DC143C]\r\n- Short description\r\n- Installation \r\n- Uninstall\r\n- Requirements\r\n- Version 1.0\r\n- Version 1.0.1beta\r\n- Version 1.0.2beta [size=2](NEW)[/size]\r\n- Version 1.0.2.1beta [size=2](NEW)[/size]\r\n[s]- Version 1.1[/s]\r\n- Known Bugs\r\n- Compatibility \r\n- Authors Note\r\n- Credits\r\n[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b][color=#4876FF]Short description[/color][/b][/size]\r\nCitizen, without this book you will never be able to become a guard. Then you will always be an adventurer like me. This book lists [b]every[/b] [i]single[/i] quote the Guards have. \r\n\r\nGrab your copy now, become a real Guard, oh and don\\'t forget your sweetrolls!\r\nWatch out for dragons, they can swoop up any time. ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=#4876FF]Installation[/color][/b][/size]\r\nIt\\'s quite easy, and it won\\'t break your game no matter what. I recommend using Nexus Mod Manager to get notified of the version 1.1 patch which will address a lot of issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=#FFC125]Manual Installation[/color][/b]\r\nDownload the archive file.  Extract it. You will now see the following:\r\n\r\n[i]fomod\r\nSkyrim Hold Guards Quotes.esp[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]Put the .esp file in:[/b]\r\n[i](Your Skyrim Folder)/Data[/i]\r\n\r\nAnd launch your Skyrim.\r\n\r\nTo get the book you will need the console. (This is no longer needed in version 1.1!)\r\n\r\nSimply type in the following:\r\n[i]help \\\"Skyrim Hold Guards: Quotes\\\" 4[/i]\r\nYou will now see the book\\'s ID (I can\\'t give the ID because it\\'s different for everyone) and now you have 2 choices.\r\n\r\nWhen I just started, I somehow couldn\\'t get it to spawn with \\\"player.additem\\\" no matter what code (the one in the creation kit, or the one in the console) but I could get it with the second option.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#FFC125]First option[/color][/b]\r\n[color=#FF0000][i]player.additem (bookID) 1[/i][/color]\r\nThis is highly recommended as it places the book directly in your inventory!\r\n\r\n[b][color=#FFC125]Second option[/color][/b]\r\n[color=#FF0000][i]player.placeatme (bookID) 1[/i][/color]\r\nThis is only recommended if the additem doesn\\'t work. Walk a bit forwards and look at the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b][color=#4876FF]Uninstall[/color][/b][/size]\r\n:( W-why would you... :( anyway.\r\nRemove the .esp from your data folder and it\\'s gone. \r\n\r\nOr use NMM to uninstall it. \r\n\r\n[size=3][b][color=#4876FF]Requirements[/color][/b][/size]\r\nThis mod needs Skyrim. It should just work fine with any version. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b][color=#4876FF]Change logs[/color][/b][/size]\r\n[size=3][b][color=#4876FF]Version 1.0[/color][/b][/size]\r\nVersion 1.0 is my first version of the mod, it doesn\\'t really have much yet, but at least it\\'s stable enough to work! \r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b][color=#4876FF]Version 1.0.1beta[/color][/b][/size]\r\nThis patch should address some slight issues, that I forgot to fix before I released the mod.\r\n\r\nThese issues have been fixed: \r\n- Fixed the description of the book being to large to fit (originally planned for 1.1 but it\\'s a really small thing to do). \r\n- Changed the value & weight of the book (originally planned for 1.1 but again, a small thing to do)\r\n- It no longer weighs 1.00 but 0.1, it no longer brings up 11 gold but 200.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b][color=#4876FF]Version 1.0.2beta[/color][/b][/size]\r\nThis patch doesn\\'t add anything new, but should fix the bug in 1.0.1 that didn\\'t allow you to patch it. (This is not on NMM\\'s end, but on my own)\r\nI\\'m terrible sorry for this! \r\n\r\n[size=3][b][color=#4876FF]Version 1.0.2.1beta[/color][/b][/size]\r\nAdded the changelog to the info in Nexus Mod.\r\nNote: When you download the mod, you will download version 1.0.2beta because that is the main version, 1.0.2.1 is just a mini patch for those who are expecting to have changelogs in their info in Nexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[s][size=3][b][color=#4876FF]Version 1.1[/color][/b][/size]\r\nThis update however is a little more time consuming for me, as I will address the bigger display issues. \r\n\r\n[b]What\\'s going to be new in version 1.1:[/b]\r\n- Added a category list. \r\n- Added page numbers on the bottom. \r\n- Addressed each page carefully to make sure it is displaying right.\r\n- Changed the way how some parts are being displayed in the book.\r\n- Ability to pick it up in the Guard\\'s barracks in Whiterun without any needs for the console to play a part in it. \r\n[i]DLC stuff related:[/i]\r\n[s]I don\\'t own Dawnguard, so I\\'m not sure if there\\'s anything new in the quotes when you have Dawnguard installed, if so, please feel free to add them in the comments and I will add them.[/s]\r\n\r\nAs for Dragonborn, the book is about Skyrim Hold Guards. Dragonborn features some new guards but they are in Morrowind, so it would break the concept a little of the book.\r\n[/s]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=#4876FF]Known Bugs[/color][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n1.0 :\r\nSome pages are not displaying the text right. They need to be aligned right.\r\nThe way some sections have been made are not looking good.\r\n\r\n1.0.1 :\r\nNot able to download with Nexus Mod Manager. [i]Fixed in 1.0.2[/i]\r\n\r\n1.0.2 :\r\nStill the same issues as in 1.0, those are being fixed in 1.1.\r\n\r\n1.1 : \r\nNone yet. \r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=#4876FF]Compatibility[/color][/b][/size]\r\n[i]Skyrim Hold Guards: Quotes[/i] should in no single way conflict with [b][color=#FF0000]any[/color][/b] mod you have. It will not change [b][color=#FF0000]any[/color][/b] existing book either so there is no way your quests can be broken. There is no single way this mod can cause a CTD.\r\n[i]Skyrim Hold Guards: Quotes[/i] is a stand-alone MOD that adds her own book into the game. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=#4876FF]Author\\'s Note[/color][/b][/size]\r\nRight now it looks a little messy, my apologies. I\\'m working on version 1.1 which will be improved, but it will be the last version. I think that after 1.1 the book will be stable, and doesn\\'t require any more work. \r\nMy next project however, can be made available for a whole new quest story, which can lead to an entire new story line, with even more dungeons, more lands, more quests, more enemies, and more power.\r\n\r\nI am looking for people wanting to help me with this, as I would be glad to invest my time in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=#4876FF]Credits[/color][/b][/size]\r\nMy credits goes to Bethesda for making the Creation Kit & Skyrim, and the author(s) of the page on Skyrim Wikia which I got the quotes from. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
