  "descriptionHtml": "Hello all&#33;\r<br />[b][u][color=#ff0000][size=2]Disclaimer: This was a save I just recently made. I utilized God mode and coc commands and /kill. I didn&#39;t want to go through the questline legit since it takes long and I wanted my character to be able to utilize showracemenu without having any problems with the stats of the character. [/size][/color]\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />So this save game came about from me wanting to play skyrim as Witcher 2 Triss Merigold. Now if youve played Witcher 2, triss is a powerful mage...so her being an archmage fits well. Now I wanted to play her as if Im progressing through a game with her as an archmage so In this save game youll find yourself as an imperial female at level 1. I tried to keep any experience from coming my way but I killed one or 2 people with destruction spells and I accidently read 1 alchemy book. Fortunately you dont have enough experience to level up so it is pretty much a  clean slate as an archmage. That meas SHOWRACEMENU should not have any problems &gt;_&lt;\r<br />\r<br />Hopefully youll enjoy this save :)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Required mods:\r<br />1. Alternate Start\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/?\r<br />2. race menu \r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?\r<br />[/color]3. Apachii sky hair is needed if yo want the hair (the optional female hairs are needed as well)\r<br />\r<br />Reccomended mods:\r<br />1. Showracemenu alternative (just in case you end up having some sort of problem with normal showracemenu)\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20394/?\r<br />\r<br />All credits go to all the mod authors of the mods I used :)\r<br />PS if you want the face, I tweaked DrowofShadows123 preset, found here:\r<br />[url=[url=]http://www.nexusmods...im/mods/62960/?[/url]&#34;&gt;Drow&#39;s Character Preset - Triss Merigold\r<br />[img]http://www.quickmeme.com/img/f1/f118b537695fff352a63fd2fa5e6ea41c1876f4386b79ee7402c31f6e1d0d0a7.jpg[/img]courtesy of http://www.quickmeme.com/",
