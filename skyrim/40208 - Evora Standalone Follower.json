  "descriptionHtml": "This is my very first time modding and I\\'m pleased that I was able to finish it and release it for others.  If you find any problems/bugs please let me know and I will do my best to correct it! Now to the good part......\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nEvora is a young and beautiful Nord Ranger who has ended up in the Riverwood Trader, but is looking for some adventures to embark on.  And who better to do that with than the Dragonborn!  Her appearance is based off one of my Player Characters that I use.  I always liked the look of the blonde hair and deep blue eyes, and thus Evora was created!\r\n\r\nThis mod is STANDALONE which means no other mods are required!!! :D\r\n\r\nScreenshots are greatly appreciated as I know many of you out there are way better at taking them than me! :)\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\nI uploaded a new version which adds the Light Foot perk to Evora so she won\\'t be setting off any traps now :)  I also changed it so she levels with the player instead of being set to level 50.  If you still want the version with her being level 50 just download version 1.0.  Thanks again for downloading! :)\r\n\r\nWARNING!!!\r\nEvora will be nude when you find her, but I added Ebony armor to her inventory which can be equipped as soon as you recruit her, or you can have her equip whatever armor/clothing you want.\r\n\r\nShe is a ranger and thus I equipped her with an Ebony bow and some Ebony arrows as well.  She is  level 50 so her Ranger stats are high and her health is as well.  She is marked essential but I can change that and her stats as well if you would like and I will upload optional files for that.\r\n\r\nShe is marriageable as well.\r\n\r\nSome of the screenshots are taken with A Realistic Hope ENB (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9936/?) activated, so your game will not look the same unless you use that mod as well.  \r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\nDimon99 for the UNP Body http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709/?\r\nMaevan2 for the Mature Skin Textures http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32986/?\r\nApachii for providing an amazing selection of hairs http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/?\r\nECE Team for allowing great customization with Enhanced Character Edit http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12951/?\r\nXenius for No More Blocky Faces http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30/?\r\nCOTS for No More Ugly Bronze Shine http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29791/?\r\nExpired for the Race Menu http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29624/?\r\nLogRaam for a fantastic collection of eyes with The Eyes of Beauty http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722/?\r\nxp32 for the XP32 Maximum Skeleton http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800/?\r\nSvarog for his tool the UNP Texture Blender to rid of those nasty neck seams http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30759/?\r\n\r\nAgain I am new to modding so any issues with the mod let me know or if you have any suggestions/tips I\\'m always willing to listen and learn! \r\nThank You! :)",
