  "descriptionHtml": "My version of the Game of Thrones character Margaery Tyrell (played by Natalie Dorner). This is a BRETON Female character preset that works with RaceMenu only.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Install with NMM[/b]\r<br />\r<br />To use it either start a new game or hit ` (above the tab key) and then type &#34;showracemenu&#34; (without the &#34; ), hit enter and then ` key again. You can find her face on the ALL or BODY tab. Just move the top slider, called &#34;Preset Slot&#34;, to 45 and hit F9 key. Note that this is just a Face Preset. You have to adjust the body on your own.\r<br />\r<br />[b]*IMPORTANT&#33;*[/b] Do NOT change the race of an existing character. It creates bugs in racial bonuses. If your character is not already a Breton you should probably start a new game if you want this face.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]These mods are required for the presets to work:[/b]\r<br /> - SKSE --- http://skse.silverlock.org/\r<br /> - Racemenu --- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]These following mods are optional[/b] but needed to make her look exactly like in the screenshot. She will still look more or less similar if you don&#39;t have/want some of these. Download and install in this order, click yes to overwrite:\r<br /> - Dimonized UNP Female body (Adult Content) --- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?\r<br /> - SG Female Texures Renewal UNP (Adult Content) --- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35267/?\r<br /> - The Eyes OF Beauty PLAYER --- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?\r<br /> - Brows Normal --- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30411/?\r<br /> - ApachiiSkyHair_v_1_5_Full --- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t like the glossiness of ApachiiskyHair you can also download this mod that will make those hairstyles blend in better with vanilla Skyrim hair:\r<br /> - ApachiiSKyHair a NATURAL retexture (it has several different v_1_5_Full versions, pick one you like) --- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35092/?\r<br />\r<br />Hair flower and dress. Note that these are equippable items you have to find in the game after you download those mods:\r<br /> - Menno Hairflowers --- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38728/?\r<br />- Witcher 2 Ehlhart Dress --- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36738/?\r<br />\r<br />Other things:\r<br />Even though SG Female Texture Renewal has Enhanced Character Edit listed as required, I do not use it. No idea if installing it alters how Racemenu presets looks or not.",
