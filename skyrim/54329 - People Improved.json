  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve been playing Skyrim for a while, and I couldn&#39;t help but notice how ugly the characters are. So I decided to make a mod to improve the looks of characters. \r<br />\r<br />Since I am only changing the face model and not any textures, this mod should be compatible with any face or body texture mod.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is new so I didn&#39;t really change that many characters. The only people I changed so far are Hadvar, General Tulius, Legate Rikke, and Legate Adventus Caesennius. I am planning on editing more.\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t like the certain look of a character, feel free to edit this mod.\r<br />\r<br />Note: The males in the pictures were taken with the better males face mod. If you do not have that mod installed (which the mod page is NSFW), the males will look different than the pictures.\r<br />                                                          -Change Log-\r<br />Update 1.1.0. is coming soon. The update will improve the residents of Riverwood. Stay tuned for updates\r<br />",
