  "descriptionHtml": "When I first found a fishing rod, I have to say, I was thrilled. Thinking about how I\\'d use it for decoration. Unfortunately I quickly found out that while I could move it around, I could take it with me. There have been a number of other similar objects that I come across and after being thoroughly annoyed I decided to go in and change every last Moveable Static into an actual item you can pick up, decorate with, sell, ect...\r\n\r\nUnless there\\'s some kind of batch tool where I can just swap the instances of them with the lootable versions this is going to take a while.  I\\'ve done about 100 objects so far, that being said there\\'s probably at least 1000; although, I haven\\'t checked.  Short version: It\\'s still in beta, but completely playable.",
