In his memoirs, \\\"Arrows Of Magicka\\\", one will find his research and recipes for magick substances that, when applied to weapons, will have useful and deadly effects.\r\nUrag in The Archaneum of the College of Winterhold has been known to carry copies of \\\"Arrows of Magicka\\\" and the previous owner of Proudspire Manor was said to be a fan of the book and was trying to recreate Dro\\'Baad\\'s magick arrows...before his untimely end.\r\n\r\n[center]\r\n[youtube]_SYO49SqIzE[/youtube]\r\n[/center]\r\n[color=009944]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[B]THE ARROWS[/B]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTo craft the arrows, you must first find a copy of the book \\\"Arrows of Magicka\\\" and read it. After you read it you will have access to the pastes at a cooking pot and the arrows at a forge.\r\n  \r\n[/color]\r\n[center]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/viarH.png[/IMG]\r\nMagick Arrow [Lesser Flame]\r\nSets target on fire, dealing 10 flame damage per second for 6 seconds.      \r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/viarH.png[/IMG]\r\nMagick Arrow [Flame Burst]                                                           \r\nExplodes on impact, dealing up to 75 damage to anyone in the blast radius and 10 flame damage per second for 6 seconds.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/2VImA.png[/IMG]\r\nMagick Arrow [Lesser Frost]\r\nDeals 6 damage to health and stamina per second for 10 seconds to a single target.\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/2VImA.png[/IMG]\r\nMagick Arrow [Frost Burst]\r\nExplodes on impact, freezing enemies for 15 seconds and dealing 8 frost damage per second for 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/l2Z3z.png[/IMG]\r\nMagick Arrow [Lesser Acid]\r\nDeals 10 damage per second for 8 seconds to a single target.\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/l2Z3z.png[/IMG]\r\nMagick Arrow [Acid Burst]\r\nExplodes on impact, dealing 15 damage per second for 10 seconds to anyone in the blast radius.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp44/kirishing/descriptshocklesser.png[/IMG]\r\nMagick Arrow [Lesser Shock]\r\nDeals 10 damage per second for 5 seconds to the Health & Magicka of a single target.\r\n[IMG]http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp44/kirishing/descriptshocklesser.png[/IMG]\r\nMagick Arrow [Shock Burst]\r\nExplodes on impact, dealing 8 damage per second for 10 seconds to the Health & Magicka of anyone in the blast radius. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/qCIiT.png[/IMG]\r\nMagick Arrow [Frenzy]\r\nExplodes on impact, causing anyone in the blast radius to become frenzied for 60 seconds.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/pxmdV.png[/IMG]\r\nMagick Arrow [Calm]\r\nExplodes on impact, causing anyone in the blast radius to be calmed and end combat for 60 seconds.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/oXJQ8.png[/IMG]\r\nMagick Arrow [Light]\r\nEmanates a soft blue light, allowing the archer to illuminate dark spaces.\r\n[/center]\r\n[color=009944]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     [B]VERSION HISTORY[/B]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[/color]\r\n22-February-2012 - Version 1.6 - [color=red]Current[/color]\r\nUpdate.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]2 New arrow types! [Shock Burst] & [Lesser Shock]. Complete with arrow and paste textures. Recipe can be found in the Arrows of Magicka book.\r\n[*]You are no longer required to have the book in your inventory to craft the items! You need only read the book once and an effect will be added giving you permanent access to all of the items.[color=red]If your save file has the book in your inventory you must drop the book and pick it back up for the script to execute.[/color]\r\n[*]Properly renamed Flame Paste.\r\n[*]The book found on Urag\\'s desk should now properly show that it is owned.\r\n[/list]\r\n20-February-2012 - Version 1.5.2 - [color=ccff00]Requires Clean Install If You Use Any Version Before 1.4[/color]\r\nUpdate.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]AoM now comes in 4 versions! Standard, Glowing Arrows, Leather Quiver and Glowing Arrows    with Leather Quiver! [color=red]YOU ONLY NEED ONE OF THE FILES[/color]\r\n[*]Restructured file folders for better mod manager support\r\n[*]Lowered damage of all arrows. Just the arrows themselves, NOT their special effects. Enemies should no longer fire the arrows back at you.\r\n[*]Book now has it\\'s own unique texture! Note: This is only the world model until I figure out how to add custom inventory model.\r\n[*]Renamed pastes to reflect arrow name changes, except Fire Paste which I renamed to Frost Paste because I\\'m a big dummy. This will be fixed in the next update. \r\n[*]Just wanna say it\\'s been a crazy time making this mod! I started it 5 days ago (uploaded v1.0 the day I started it) and I feel it has come a long way in such a short time, especially considering I\\'ve been teaching myself the CK the entire time. This is my first real mod (besides Increased Arrow Damage, which anyone could have made.) I appreciate all of the help and support from everyone. Just so you know, I may not always comment but I AM keeping track of all of the ideas people are leaving in the comments section. I\\'m trying to prioritize everything the way I think best. Now that the frenzy/calm arrows are working, I can get down to the real fun stuff. My leave is up tomorrow, so the updates will not be as often, but I assure you this thing is far from finished. Thanks for downloading and I hope you enjoy.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n20-February-2012 - Version 1.5.1 - [color=ccff00]Requires Clean Install If You Use Any Version Before 1.4[/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Still version 1.5.1 but added an optional version that uses a plain leather quiver. This is my personal preference as well as a request from [color=33AABB]jimbo1567[/color]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n19-February-2012 - Version 1.5.1 - [color=ccff00]Requires Clean Install If You Use Any Version Before 1.4[/color]\r\nUpdate. \r\n[list]\r\n[*]Added missing meshes to Glowing Arrows version. No more invisible quiver/arrows! Yay! Thanks to [color=33AABB]jimbo1567[/color] for bringing up the issue!\r\n[*]Reverted Frenzy/Calm arrows back to 1.3 settings, except for one small difference that I believe (Ha) has finally fixed their issues. I\\'m coming to the end of the line with these arrows. They are giving me an ulcer. Before long I may scrap them, or at least suspend them until I figure out wtf I\\'m doing. :P\r\n[*]The book has been updated to reflect the new [Lesser] arrows. As I type this I realize the names of the pastes were, however, not changed to reflect the new [Lesser] arrows. I\\'ll do that later. Not a priority at the moment.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n18-February-2012 - Version 1.5 - [color=ccff00]Requires Clean Install If You Use Any Version Before 1.4[/color]\r\nUpdate. \r\n[list]\r\n[*]3 New Arrow Types! [Lesser Flame], [Lesser Frost] and [Lesser Acid]. These new arrow types use the same respective pastes, but one paste can craft a stack of 12 but they have significantly weaker effects. Thanks to [color=33AABB]WarriorComic[/color] for the ideas!\r\n[*]Arrow types [Fire], [Ice] and [Acid] are renamed to [Flame Burst], [Frost Burst] and [Acid Burst]. Their effects are unchanged.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n18-February-2012 - Version 1.4.2 - [color=ccff00]Requires Clean Install If You Use Any Version Before 1.4[/color]\r\nUpdate. Special thanks and appreciation to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=2404593]Kodiak412[/url] for all his play-testing, help and feedback. If you like this mod, give him all your kudos!\r\n[list]\r\n[*]New mesh for Magick Arrow [Light] with a light source! Also, corrected missing Luna Moth Wing in the book.\r\n[*][Frenzy] & [Calm] Arrows have been overhauled. They now work properly. No damage from the explosion and larger radius. Now with 100% more predictability! \r\n[*]Added even more backstory to Dro\\'Baad\\'s book. \r\n[*]Magick Arrow [Ice] now has larger radius\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n18-February-2012 - Version 1.4.1 - [color=ccff00]Requires Clean Install If You Use Any Version Before 1.4[/color] - [color=red]Broken[/color]\r\nUpdate.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]New mesh for Magick Arrow [Light] with a light source!\r\n[*][Frenzy] & [Calm] Arrows have been overhauled. They now work properly. No damage from the explosion and larger radius. Now with 100% more predictability! [color=red]I lied! I left out one setting, fixed this in 1.4.2 Sorry for the inconvenience.[/color]\r\n[*]Added even more backstory to Dro\\'Baad\\'s book. \r\n[*]Magick Arrow [Ice] now has larger radius\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n18-February-2012 - Version 1.4 - [color=ccff00]Requires Clean Install![/color] \r\nUpdate.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]New Arrow type: Magick Arrow [Light]! Complete with arrow and paste textures. Recipe can be found in the Arrows of Magicka book. Thanks to [color=33AABB]jasonpklee[/color] for the idea.\r\n[*]Now with an optional version using Jerry60k\\'s Glowing Arrow meshes! Check out his really cool mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5811] here! [/url]\r\n[*]Added a lot more backstory to Dro\\'Baad in the book. \r\n[*]Also, I broke the book. You will have to reacquire it, sorry. There is one in the basement of Proudspire Manor (on the floor left of the crate) and one on Urag\\'s desk in The Archaneum. Or you can use the console. A bug may happen if you have the old book in your inventory when installing the new version, so I highly suggest you make a clean save (save game without Arrows of Magicka.esp activated) before installing the new version. Sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n[*]Magick Arrow [Fire]\\'s burn visuals now has the same duration as the burn damage (6 seconds).\r\n[*]Tweaks made to [Frenzy] & [Calm] arrows for a higher area of effect and raised the duration of the effect from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.\r\n[/list]\r\n16-February-2012 - Version 1.3\r\nUpdate.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]2 New Arrow types: Magick Arrow [Frenzy] & Magick Arrow [Calm]! Complete with arrow and paste textures. Recipes can be found in Arrows of Magicka book. Thanks to [color=33AABB]Reyq[/color] for the idea.\r\n[*]Reduced Magick Arrow [Fire]\\'s damage, force and radius by 25% and added Over-time Burn damage.\r\n[*]New normal map for paste textures. Less glossy/more gooey. Everyone loves gooey paste. \r\n[/list]\r\n16-February-2012 - Version 1.2\r\nUpdate.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]New Arrow type: Magick Arrow [Acid]! Complete with arrow and paste textures. Recipe can be found in Arrows of Magicka book.\r\n[*]Changed Magick Arrow [Ice]\\'s visuals to that of the Ice Form shout. \r\n[*]General tweaks to explosions\\' radius and damage for better balance.  \r\n[*]Scoured through each item to make sure all sounds, art, etc. were attached properly.\r\n[/list]\r\n15-February-2012 - Version 1.1\r\nUpdate. \r\n[list]\r\n[*]Grammar and spelling corrections in Arrows of Magicka book.\r\n[*]Took stupid fucking screenshots out of the archive. Don\\'t know how they got there. So file size is small like it should be! :P\r\n[*]New texture for Paste ingredient bowl. \r\n[*]Lowered duration of Ice arrows freezing affect from 60 seconds to 15 seconds. I never intended it to last so long.\r\n[*]You are now required to have the Arrows of Magicka book in your inventory to be able to craft the pastes or arrows. Will change this to only having to have read the book to be able to craft the items once I can find the proper Condition for it in the CK. \r\n[/list]\r\n15-February-2012 - Version 1.0\r\nInitial release. \r\n\r\nIncludes Fire & Ice Pastes, [Fire] & [Ice] Magick arrows and Arrows of Magicka book.\r\n[color=009944]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     [b]IN THE WORKS[/b]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]More utility arrows: Disarm and Soultrap\r\n[*]New trailer video to replace current proof of concept video (so maybe people stop running scared)\r\n[*]Unique texture for the book (inventory model)\r\n[*]Request from [color=33AABB]Kodiak412[/color] for \\\"toxic\\\" arrows\r\n[*]Request from [color=33AABB]WarriorComic[/color] for \\\"teleporting\\\" arrows\r\n[*]Magick Arrow [Necro] which, when fired into a corpse, causes Reanimation\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=009944]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHOW TO INSTALL\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[/color]\r\nDownload ONE of the available versions.
