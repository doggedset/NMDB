  "summary": "An undead mage with glowing eyes, for your travels.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Nadja was created to satisfy an urge of mine to create an OC with a deep drive for revenge against a former lover. Now you can have her follow you around Skyrim and like...do stuff, I guess.\n<br />\n<br />The next step is removing her voiced lines and giving her custom dialogue because Nadja is canonically mute in the state she is now but I want to upload her here as she is before I get into that.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]About Nadja[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Nadja is one of the Jahhat (lit. \"Hollow\") of the Seventh Temple, the lowest ranking one can possess within the cult. The Hollow are created through a process similar to Liches, with the exception that this is not voluntary or to the chosen invidual's benefit. Instead, they are treated as slaves, and their phylacteries are used to keep them in line. After the formula for creating a Hollow was solidified, it was ruled that in order to obtain the position of High Priest / Priestess within the Temple, one must successfully create a Hollow to serve the cult. Nadja was \"created\" by her former lover, who betrayed her in favor of gaining power. Her death was a messy beheading and her exact conversion into an undead being was no more clean, which left her unable to speak.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=1](Not fitting for Skyrim? It's not supposed to be. I do what I want. I'm developing this #deep lore for an original story.)\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]I don't care for stats much. She's uses the fire staves she comes with unless you know how to change that around. Good luck.[/size] [size=2]The body she uses is UNPetite.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Treat her gently and take pretty pictures.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Location: [/b]Whiterun's Hall of the Dead\n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits:[/b]\n<br />[size=2]In the actual mod...[/size]\n<br />[/size][/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=1][size=5][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35748/]UNPetite by Nightasy[/url][/size][/size][/size]\n<br />[*][size=1][size=5][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/]KS Hairdos by Kalilies and Stealthic[/url][/size][/size][/size]\n<br />[*][size=1][size=5][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73853/?]PureSkinTexture by Anini and regenbot03﻿[/url]﻿[/size][/size][/size]\n<br />[*][size=1][size=5][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21232/]﻿Glowing Eyes by dumle35[/url][/size][/size][/size]\n<br />[*][size=1][size=5][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84400/]﻿Immersive Warpaints and tattoos by reptileye[/url][/size][/size][/size]\n<br />[*][size=1][size=5][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49279/]Northborn Scars by Northborn﻿[/url][/size][/size][/size]\n<br />[*][size=1][size=5][size=3][url=http://mod.dysintropi.me/mods/skyrim/]High Poly Feet and Hands by Halofarm﻿[/url][/size][/size][/size]\n<br />[/list][size=1][size=5][size=3][size=2]In the screenshots...[/size]\n<br />[/size][/size][/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=1][size=5][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70451/]﻿Snapdragon Prime by Tetrodoxin[/url]﻿[/size][/size][/size]\n<br />[*][size=1][size=5][size=3][url=https://rd.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62639]Empyrean Warpaints by Empyrean42[/url]﻿ (The marking on her forehead.
