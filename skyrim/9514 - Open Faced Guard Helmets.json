  "descriptionHtml": "======================\r<br />Open Faced Guard Helms v 1.0\r<br />======================\r<br />\r<br />Always wondered what the guard complaining about an Arrow in their knee looks like? Now you can find out&#33; This mod changes all of the Guard Helms and Stormcloak Helmets to open face versions, so now you can see their pretty face&#33;\r<br />\r<br />If you like it, please endorse&#33; \r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9514\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=11210\r<br />\r<br />If you downloaded this outside of those two pages, please let me know at those websites&#33; I only will be updating on these pages, so if you don&#39;t visit you might miss out on new updates&#33;\r<br />\r<br />======================\r<br />Description\r<br />======================\r<br />\r<br />I had this idea for a while, to make open face guard helms. There was a model that had the open face, but it wasn&#39;t on a human model. So I rigged it to the human skeleton and here we are&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I will perhaps add more variations of the helmet, if/when I get a chance. This was a quick mod, since the mesh already existed in the game. Variations are a bit more involved, but when the time comes I&#39;ll add more. \r<br />\r<br />I was planning variations from the beginning, since it would be nice to have different versions of the helm dependent on the climate. A warmer climate would have someone suffer from wearing a closed helmet all the time; they would benefit more from this open version. Colder climates could have more bundled up kits...and stuff like that. But since that takes longer to do, I figured I would just release this first. \r<br />\r<br />Anyway, hope you guys like it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />======================\r<br />Installation Instructions\r<br />======================\r<br />It&#39;s just one mesh and one esp, so you just drop then in your data folder and you&#39;re done&#33;\r<br />\r<br />======================\r<br />Removal Instructions\r<br />======================\r<br />\r<br />Delete &#39;Data&#92;meshes&#92;armor&#92;stormcloaks&#92;helm_open.nif&#39; and &#39;Data&#92;OpenFaceGuardHelms.esp&#39;. That&#39;s it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />======================\r<br />Issues:\r<br />======================\r<br />\r<br />1) Some long beards clip with the mesh, not sure how to fix this.\r<br />2) A few guards are copy-pasta&#39;d by Bethesda, can be a bit of an immersion breaker, but this might be fixed in future versions or other mods by me.\r<br />3) Some clipping when guards turn their head too much in one direction, but not too noticeable. Not sure how to fix either. Maybe I&#39;ll scale the helmet? \r<br />But I like how it looks right now. \r<br />\r<br />======================\r<br />Version History\r<br />======================\r<br />v 1.0 - Initial Release (2/13/2012)",
