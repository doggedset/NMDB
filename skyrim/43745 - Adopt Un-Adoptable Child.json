  "descriptionHtml": "The Hearthfire DLC disappointed me about that you can\\'t adopt awesome children like Babette. So I find these console commands that you can use by:\r\n\r\n1-Opening the console.\r\n2-Click on the children you would like to adopt.\r\n3-Enter this console command: setfactionrank 03004290 1\r\n4-Finish.\r\n\r\nYou need Hearthfire of course and Hearthfire multiple adoptions - Now with custom home support for kids and spouse by TMPhoenix.\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\n \r\nBethesda\r\nTMPhoenix\r\n\r\nALL THANKS TO TMPHOENIX!\r\n",
