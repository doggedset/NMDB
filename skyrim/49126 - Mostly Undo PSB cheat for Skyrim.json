  "descriptionHtml": "I, like many out there, made the grave mistake of using the PSB cheat code.\r<br />\r<br />I pretty much ignored it for a while and went, &#34;meh&#34; not being much of a magic user (more archery anyways). \r<br />\r<br />Finally, I got fed up. I couldn&#39;t reload a previous save since at that point I had invested so much time and leveled that I didn&#39;t have a previous save I wanted to use.\r<br />\r<br />Finding that other BAT txt files were lacking, and only removing about 1% of the spells and shouts, I decided to go all out.\r<br />\r<br />I found the code for nearly all the spells and shouts available.\r<br />\r<br />So now here&#39;s my warning:\r<br />\r<br />******WARNING******\r<br />This will remove ALMOST ALL spells/shouts created by the PSB cheat code.\r<br />\r<br />This does not remove the &#34;No name&#34; spells. (because they had no name, so I couldn&#39;t find them.)\r<br />\r<br />This does not remove the main spells you start with.\r<br />\r<br />This will remove temporary quest related spells/shouts.\r<br />\r<br />If you want certain spells back, you can find the ID for the spell book/tome in the excel file under type &#34;BOOK.&#34; Then do: playeradditem.&lt;Book ID&gt;\r<br />\r<br />If you have dedicated a lot of dragon souls this will remove the shouts you invested those dragon souls into, and you CANNOT GET THE DRAGON SOULS BACK. \r<br />But it isn&#39;t as if there aren&#39;t enough dragons in skyrim to go around slaying. Seriously, go slay some dragons.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />P.S. A how to and additional side notes about the excel files are contained in the Read Me file. Please read it.",
