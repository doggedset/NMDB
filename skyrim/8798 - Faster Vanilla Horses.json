  "descriptionHtml": "Like many, I found Skyrim\\'s horses to be unrealistically and unreasonably slow. Travel by horse was hardly faster than by foot, making it unrewarding.\r\n\r\nHorse speed and gallop-time has been given a significant -yet balanced- boost, for a more realistic (and fun!) experience. You\\'ll find yourself riding more often, fast travelling less, and overall feeling like the mounts are more enjoyable and worthwhile.\r\n\r\nNo known bugs at this time.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n02/08/2012 - Updated to Version 1.1:\r\n\r\nAfter user feedback, and many hours of tweaking and playtesting, horse speed has been ever-so-slightly reduced to be a clean 30% faster than default. It feels really natural and balanced, without sacrificing the fun or feeling that you\\'re moving at a full gallop. While speed has seen a reduction, your horse\\'s stamina (gallop time) has been slightly extended. Like a real horse, yours wont need to take a breather every few seconds. As always, your feedback and suggestions are welcome; Please feel free to e-mail me at ByJovMods@gmail.com\r\n\r\nChange log:\r\n-Horse \\'Run\\' and \\'Sprint\\' speeds reduced to +30%\r\n-Turning speeds restored to normal due to the Intro\\'s horse trip becoming slightly quicker, causing a minor timing mismatch in the dialogue. \r\n-Horse stamina increased.",
