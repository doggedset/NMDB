  "descriptionHtml": "Ahkari and Keerava\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nBy c_striker\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#00FF00] UPDATE:[/color] I have now released a new mod, \\\"ESP - Expanded Skyrim Presets\\\", which makes these characters (along with 300+ other NPCs) available to play as presets in the character creation menu. If you\\'d prefer the preset version, which allows you to customize the character or to convert your existing character via the showracemenu console command, you can find the new mod [color=yellow] [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15963&tab=3&navtag=/modules/comments/comments_ajax.php?tid=658266|:|fid=15963] here[/color][/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Description\r\n==========[/color]\r\nBy request, this file includes level one save games of precise clones of the female NPCs Ahkari (traveling Khajiit trader) and Keerava (Argonian innkeeper of the Bee & Barb in Riften), for those who wish to play as one of them or as a beast character who looks like one of them.\r\n\r\nThese player characters are exact replicas of the NPCs upon which they are based. Their chargen settings are the same as the vanilla NPC settings, so no matter which face mods you use, if any, when you pull up the player character from the save game she should look exactly like your in-game NPC (unless you previously used an NPC editor to change the NPC, in which case all bets are off).\r\n\r\nEach character is saved just outside the cave after escaping Helgen Keep.\r\n\r\nIf you like my work, please feel free to check out my other mods:\r\n* \\\"Aela and Gormlaith\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=52773\r\n* \\\"Astrid and Karliah\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=50370\r\n* \\\"Cicero and Lucien Lachance\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=51857\r\n* \\\"Diverse Female Housecarls\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=49520\r\n* \\\"Dromarash and Veezara\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=51546\r\n* \\\"Hroki and Jordis\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=50842\r\n* \\\"Lisette and Muiri\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=51033 \r\n* \\\"Val - Twin Sister of Vex\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=39781\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Mods used in the screenshots\r\n=========================[/color]\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Installation (manual)\r\n==================[/color]\r\n1.
