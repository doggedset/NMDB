  "modName": "Dot crosshair and thinner compass",
  "summary": "Replaces the crosshair with a small dot and makes the compass thinner.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I made this mod because i think the vanilla crosshair and compass are just too big, especially on a large screen.\r<br />\r<br />There are several other mods which provide these features, but i could not find one with those two things combined. (at least none without serious bugs or other mods required)\r<br />\r<br />Licensing: I used the hudmenu.gfx from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12804/?]A Thinner Compass[/url], which can be modified without permission from the author, and changed the crosshair to a circle with a color I thought would fit. If you just want the thinner compass, use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12804/?]A Thinner Compass[/url], it modifies the compass only.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />- compatible with any mod that does not modify the &#34;interface/exported/hudmenu.gfx&#34;\r<br />- should also work with: iHUD\r<br />\r<br />If you want to alter the position of the dot/camera like in the screenshots, try [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37347/?]Customizable Camera[/url] or edit the [Camera] section in your skyrim.ini.\r<br />For accurate 3rd person aiming try [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13652/?]Proper Aiming[/url].\r<br />\r<br />I made this small mod for personal use and thought I would share it because I really like it so far, I will not implement any new features as long as I don&#39;t need them.",
