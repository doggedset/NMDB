(See Bug section below.)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=8]Bugs:[/size][/u]\r<br />[size=4]Now I should mention that this method is not really the best and has it´s flaws...\r<br />\r<br />Landing or falling lower than the height you jumped from will cancel weapon swings and bow draws\r<br />and at this point it will play the &#34;falling sound&#34; on repeat until you land.\r<br />Leap attacks á la Assassins Creed are therefor sadly not possible. :(\r<br />\r<br />In 3rd person there is no jumping animation anymore, the character will just move up in the air.\r<br />\r<br />I included silenced falling sounds to overcome the sound issue. Landing sounds still work.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=8]Notes:[/size][/u]\r<br />[size=4]This is a mod without scripts or .esp files.\r<br />\r<br />It works well with magic:\r<br />Magic attacks seem to not get cancelled.\r<br />\r<br />It works decent with 1h weapons:\r<br />Fast swings get executed nicely, power attacks might not work each time because of their slowness.\r<br />\r<br />It works bad with 2h weapons and bows:\r<br />The attack animations won´t finish before you land.\r<br />\r<br />It is still not possible to jump while attacking.\r<br />\r<br />The mod is split into 3 parts and you can choose and combine them to your liking.\r<br />For example if you want to keep your 3rd Person jump animations you can get only Pt01,\r<br />which has only 1st Person Combat while jumping and does not touch 3rd Person files.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=8]Outroduction:[/size][/u]\r<br />[size=4]I tryed the same method of replacing animation files for the attacking while swimming\r<br />and jumping while sprinting issue, but it didn´t work. :/[/size]",
