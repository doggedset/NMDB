  "descriptionHtml": "[i]Dawnguard users: This mod is probably not for you, as craftable arrows are already present in Dawnguard.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim Highly Advanced (or Hopefully Acceptable ;)) Role Playing Enhancements presents:\r<br />\r<br />[b]SHARPE: Fletching for blacksmiths[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Allows the creation of arrows at blacksmith forges, using the Smithing skill tree. As an added bonus, longbows, hunting bows and Imperial bows can now be created at forges as well.\r<br />\r<br />Details:\r<br />Iron arrows can be created without any perks, other types of arrows require the Smithing perk that corresponds to their main component (i.e. Ebony Smithing for Ebony Arrows).\r<br />Daedric Arrows and Nord Hero arrows can only be created from other arrows (Ebony and Ancient Nord, respectively).\r<br />The forging of longbows and hunting bows does not require a perk. Forging an Imperial bow requires the Steel Smithing perk.\r<br />\r<br />The requirements now match those of the recipes added by the Dawnguard DLC. If you have Dawnguard, this mod will be mostly useless.\r<br />\r<br />Install:\r<br />- put the .esp file in Skyrim&#39;s Data directory\r<br />- select the file using the Skyrim launcher under &#34;Data Files&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall:\r<br />- remove the .esp file from Skyrim&#39;s Data directory\r<br />\r<br />Also available from the Steam Workshop [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=10051]here[/url]",
