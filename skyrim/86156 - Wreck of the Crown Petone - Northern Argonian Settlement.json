What is the deal with these Argonians? These questions may [color=#c9daf8][size=1][i]or may not [/i][/size][/color]be answered here.\r<br />\r<br />The file has been[b] cleaned with TES5EDIT[/b] and [u][b]requires no DLC[/b][/u]. [i]Please remember that you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF][size=5][center]== WHAT ==[/center][/size][/color]Just a small settlement on a shipwreck - aptly named the [b][i]Wreck of the Crown Petone[/i][/b]. It has a [b]map marker [/b]that you can see on the map right away, but you will need to discover it before you can fast travel. Please see the pictures for the exact location.\r<br />\r<br />As this was a small request and I didn&#39;t want to make anything too elaborate [i](this mod was made in 14 days), [/i]there is admittedly not much to do here. A few NPCs have dialogue, one is a [b]merchant[/b], and another one is a [b]heavy-armor spellsword follower [/b]you can hire for 250 gold.\r<br />\r<br />- The merchant, [b][color=#c9daf8]Basks-in-Laconism[/color],[/b] works all day and will purchase [b]stolen items [/b]if you have them. He has plenty of coin to barter with and sells a wide variety of items.\r<br />- The mercenary, [b][color=#c9daf8]Smites-And-Slashes[/color],[/b] will follow you around after you pay, and has some interesting features - he carries a [b]ring [/b]that, when equipped by the player, will teleport him in case he gets lost; and he is able to heal the player through dialogue if their health goes under 75% or so[i] (about the time the screen goes red). [/i]This healing will replenish [b]health, stamina [/b]and [b]magicka.[/b]\r<br />- And, last but not least, a [color=#c9daf8][b]bewildered yellow Argonian[/b] [/color]can give you a random item once a day if you bother talking to her.\r<br /> \r<br />The other NPCs don&#39;t care about you. Sorry. Everyone here is [b]essential[/b], including Spotty.\r<br />\r<br />You can find all [b]crafting stations[/b] scattered around the settlement [i](smelting, tanning, cooking, smithing, armor workbench, sharpening wheel, enchanting, alchemy, firewood), [/i]can sleep in one of the [b]bedrolls[/b], and can collect a free meal and drink from the [b]pot [/b]and[b] wooden keg [/b]respectively.\r<br />\r<br />All containers here are [b]owned by the custom faction [/b]and[b] WILL RESPAWN[/b].[i][b] Nothing is safe&#33;[/b][/i] if you want to roleplay as this being your home or whatnot, a version that makes all belong to the player and not-respawning is available as an optional file. Note that you&#39;ll still need to pay for the follower in this one, but the gold will go to the safe so you can get it back easily anyway.\r<br /> \r<br />That&#39;s about it. As this was something I made as a request, [u][b]I WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES[/b][/u]. I will not add to it or subtract from it. [b][u]The mod is offered as-is[/u].[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF][size=5][center][/center][/size][/color][color=#1E90FF][size=5][center]== KNOWN ISSUES AND COMPATIBILITY ==[/center][/size][/color]If the dialogue with the NPCs doesn&#39;t work, save your game and reload. It should work then.\r<br />\r<br />Most NPCs here wear face masks that are not playable. Don&#39;t try to kill them for it or pickpocket them - it won&#39;t work. If you want one, take the one from the follower and multiply that one into your inventory with the console... or something like that.\r<br />\r<br />The navmesh in the area surrounding the ship isn&#39;t very good, because Bethesda probably never expected anyone to go there [i](if you swim north a bit you&#39;ll get to the end of the playable map),[/i] so navigate carefully. As stated before, you can use Smites-And-Slashes&#39; ring if he gets stuck somewhere. \r<br />\r<br />The mod adds two consumables [i](a kelp stew and a malt) [/i]that can be purchased from the merchant. There is no recipe for them as the ingredients, such as kelp, cannot be collected in the game. These foods are compatible out-of-the-box with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60270/?]RND - Universal Compatibility Patch[/url]. [i][b]I will not make a dedicated patch for it or any other needs mods.[/b][/i] If you want to make one, feel free to do so. You are welcome to send it to me, if you&#39;d like to have it uploaded here -- with credits, of course.\r<br />\r<br />Smites-And-Slashes starts off naked and equips his clothes through some scripting magic the first time you approach the ship. This is to allow the player to manage his inventory easily without needing extra mods. I never had it happen, but there could be a really small chance he may be naked when you first meet him. Your mileage may vary. If this happens simply hire him, take/add something to his inventory so he equips his stuff, and then dismiss him. You can give yourself the gold back with the console afterwards if you want.\r<br />\r<br />The player dialogue is arguably a bit wordy or whatnot. This is simply because I play with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51469/?]Immesive Player Dialogue [/url]and wanted mine to match.\r<br />\r<br />About compatibility with other mods, I honestly don&#39;t know. This is so far away that I doubt there&#39;s any other mod that edits the same area. It is compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33994/?]Underwater Treasure[/url], that I do know. So, if you find a problem, please let me know so I can list it here.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF][size=5][center]== HOW ==[/center][/size][/color]To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;[font=Courier New]Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data[/font]&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use your Mod Manager of choice to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go.
