  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=red][font=comic sans ms][size=24][b][i]Prisoner Of The Horned Helm[/i][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r\n\r\na Death Dealer story\r\n\r\nby Painkiller_Rider & Miguelfromhell[/center]\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, this (I recommend playing it with no sound; also, well, I apologize for the bikinis, don\\'t think they match the helmet):\r\n[center][youtube]EYkl1SXrr1I[/youtube][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/18077-1-1364565310.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n- STORY -\r\n\r\n\\\"In an age before the Dragons rose, an age rife with sorcery and violence, the earth trembled beneath the all conquering hooves of Death, and only one man, Gath of Baal, dared defy it, standing between the unstoppable power of Destruction and the wonders of Creation. To save the peaceful People of the Forest, Gath have diced with the gods, and the price he paid was to become death made flesh, the Prisoner of the Horned Helmet.\\\"\r\nFind the Death Dealer, learn of his story and stop Destruction before invading Tamriel once more!\r\n\r\n\r\n- FEATURES -\r\n\r\nBrand new Items\r\nNew Meshes\r\nHD Textures (2048p)\r\nMini-Quest\r\nUnlimited coolness :D\r\n\r\n\r\n- THE MOD -\r\n\r\nThis mod is inspired on one of the most iconic characters of fantasy lore, The Death Dealer, by Frank Frazetta. \r\n\r\nThe MOD itself is the product of merging the work of 2 people, Miguelfromhell and Painkiller_Rider; it draws origins from the older mods [url=http://morrowind.nexusmods.com/mods/42111]Art of War Museum[/url] (for Morrowind) and [url=http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/40837]Beyond The Realms of Death[/url] (for Oblivion), the later serving as base for Miguel\\'s recently retired Death Dealer mod (for Skyrim).\r\n\r\nWe have kept Miguel\\'s original mod unaltered, for the sake of the people who enjoyed and respected his work, as well as adding now Painkiller\\'s own version, closer to his original concepts (as detailed below):\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/18077-2-1338658005.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][color=blue][font=comic sans ms][size=12][b]Miguel\\'s Version[/b][/size][/font][/color][/center]\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the items, you´re gonna have to go and find the Death Dealer himself, defeat him, and loot his stuff from his corpse. These items are unique, so you can´t just go to a forge and make´em nor go to a merchant and buy´em.\r\n\r\nThe Death Dealer is extremely powerful, so if you want to take his gear from him you´d better think twice. If your character is less than Level 50, don´t even think about it. Go level up, get stronger, and then go challenge the Death Dealer - the equipment is balanced such way that for lower level characters will seem \\\"uber\\\", so obtaining it via console will break immersion.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 armors, SKULL PLATE it´s the heavy armor and it can only be obtained from the Death Dealer himself after you defeat him. The second armor is the CHAINMAIL, it´s a light armor inspired on the original Frank Frazetta´s paintings, its simple, minimalistic and practical. And the third armor is the GREATBELT, included because some times going bare-chest arround the land just like a true barbarian is the only way to go; also, the light armors can be found on the Alternate Location (checkout the \\\"Location\\\" section).\r\n\r\nMore items have been added. The COWL, AmethystDeceiver gave me permission to use the mesh of the cowl displayed on his beautiful MOD Black Tower and Black Sacrament Armor pack, just re-textured it and included it here; if you want some more cowls you should go download his mod, there are many variants you could combine with this mod - the Helmet is compatible with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ITEMS:\r\n\r\nDeath Dealer HELMET RETEXTURED\r\nDeath Dealer Skull Plate (Heavy Armor)\r\nDeath Dealer Chain Mail (Light Armor)\r\nDeath Dealer Greath Belt (Light Armor)\r\nDeath Dealer Equipable Glowing Eyes\r\nDeath Dealer Cowl\r\nDeath Dealer Cape\r\nDeath Dealer Warlock Hood\r\nDeath Dealer Wolf Pelt (upper cape)\r\nDeath Dealer BRACES RETEXTURED\r\nDeath Dealer BOOTS RETEXTURED\r\nDeath Dealer RING\r\nDeath Dealer BATTLE AXE (2H)\r\nDeath Dealer WAR AXE (1H) RETEXTURED\r\nDeath Dealer SCIMITAR (1H)\r\nDeath Dealer SHIELD RETEXTURED\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\r\nNow only the Helmet is enchanted, and the war-axe and shield related to the quest are also enchanted. The rest of the items are un enchanted, some can be found following the quest, and the oters can be found on the alternate location. On the alternate location can be found also the un-enchanted versions of those enchanted items i mentioned. All items are upgradeable now. \r\n\r\nThe Wolf Pelt is intended to be equiped only when you go barechest, if you equio it with the full armors, it will clip.\r\n\r\n\r\n- LOCATION -\r\n\r\nWhere do I find the Death Dealer´s Gear?, You may ask, well . . . \r\n\r\nMAIN LOCATION\r\nI heard that a foreigner has been asking for the Dragonborn at the Wayward Pass lately, you may go there and find out what he wants . . .\r\n\r\nALTERNATE LOCATION\r\nGo to Mount Anthor, it ´s said that a group of necromancers placed an altar to worship the Death Dealer there. Checkout the image on the gallery section to see the precise location of this altar.\r\n\r\n\r\n- INSTALATION -\r\n\r\nExtract all the contents in your \\\" C:\\\\ . . . skyrim\\\\data\\\" folder.\r\n\r\nTo enable the Death Dealer MOD:\r\nCheck the DEATH-DEALER.esp in your Skyrim Launcher, click OK, and have fun.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo uninstall this MOD just:\r\n\r\n- Uncheck the DEATH-DEALER.esp in your Skyrim Launcher, click OK\r\n\r\n- Delete these folders:\r\n\r\n\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\meshes\\\\armor\\\\DDhelm\\\\\r\n\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\meshes\\\\weapons\\\\DDaxe\\\\\r\n\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\textures\\\\ddhelm\\\\\r\n\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\sound\\\\voice\\\\DEATH-DEALER.esp\\\\ (folder)\r\n\r\n- And also delete this file:\r\n\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\DEATH-DEALER.esp (file)\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/18077-1-1338657479.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][color=blue][font=comic sans ms][size=12][b]Painkiller\\'s Version[/b][/size][/font][/color][/center]\r\n\r\nNOTE: this version can work with or without Miguel\\'s version; it adds a full set of armor (heavy/scaled), plus the 3 weapons, all using textures based on the Beyond the Realms of Death mod (as well as Painkiller\\'s original meshes); last, but not least, includes a dark horse named Slayer, who can carry your burdens, can follow you and/or come running for your calling! \r\n\r\nAll the items in Painkiller\\'s version also feature a different balancing system for armor/damage rating, as well as enchantments, tuned-in closer to Painkiller\\'s original design.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ITEMS:\r\n\r\nDeath Dealer Helmet - original texture (comes in 2 styles and 2 sizes, see Installation below)\r\nDeath Dealer Scaled Armor - original texture (Heavy Armor, comes in 2 styles, with cape attached and without cape)\r\nDeath Dealer Cowl - Retextured (comes in 2 sizes)\r\nDeath Dealer Cape\r\nDeath Dealer Braces - original texture\r\nDeath Dealer Boots - original texture\r\nDeath Dealer Battle-Axe (2H) - original texture\r\nDeath Dealer War-Axe (1H) - original texture\r\nDeath Dealer Scimitar (1H) - original texture\r\nDeath Dealer Shield - original texture\r\n\r\n\r\n- LOCATION - \r\n\r\nVery close to the spot where you fought the Death Dealer, you will find his horse, Slayer. Do not kill him, he\\'s as upset on his master as he is on you, so he may actually help you in battle. Being a horse coming from another world, he is pretty much invulnerable to damage, can run almost forever and can be quite helful in a fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n- HORSE & ITEMS -\r\n\r\nMoreover, if you SNEAK when close to (and facing) the horse, you will be able to access his inventory, where you will find the items listed just above + a book (called Slayer: Angel of Death) which will teach you the Power spell needed to Call Slayer: when you use it, Slayer will run to your side and continually follow you wherever you go. To have him wait just cast the spell again and he\\'ll stay put until you call him back to your side. If he\\'s really far away he\\'ll be teleported closer to you (hopefully not close enough that you\\'ll actually see it) and run the rest of the way. An easy way to know if Slayer is following you or not is to look at your magic menu under the \\\"powers\\\" tab. If Slayer is following you you\\'ll see a spell called \\\"Slayer is currently following\\\".\r\n\r\n\r\n- INSTALATION -\r\n\r\nExtract all the contents in your \\\"\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\" folder.\r\n\r\nTo enable the Death Dealer MOD:\r\nCheck the DEATH-DEALER-PKR.esp in your Skyrim Launcher, click OK, and have fun.\r\n\r\nFor Optional Equipment style/size:\r\nGo to \\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\\\\\Meshes\\\\armor\\\\PainDDarmor and locate the following files:\r\n- PainDDhelmet-OLD.nif and PainDDhelmetgnd-OLD.nif - these have the original style texture from the Beyond the Realms of Death. To use them, simply rename them to PainDDhelmet.nif and PainDDhelmetgnd.nif respectively (see that you overwrite the old files).\r\n- PainDDhelmet-XL.nif and PainDDhelmet-OLD-XL.nif - this is a slightly larger size helmet (same size as Miguel\\'s version), coming in both texture versions. Again, just rename ONE of them to PainDDhelmet.nif and overwrite the old one.\r\n- if using any of the above XL helmets, best if doing the same with the cowl: PainDDcowl_XL.nif, rename to PainDDcowl.nif.\r\n- last, but not least: the default body armor comes in with the cape attached - however, that is just an aesthetical detail, the cape not having any role but making the pauldrons fitting the armor better. If you equip the armor, the cape can be equipped separatedly, for the same visual effect, but with added magic enchantments. For a body armor with no cape, please use PainDDarmor - No Cape.nif and just rename it to PainDDarmor.nif...\r\n\r\n\r\nTo uninstall this MOD just:\r\n\r\n- Uncheck the DEATH-DEALER.esp in your Skyrim Launcher, click OK\r\n\r\n- Delete these folders:\r\n\r\n\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\meshes\\\\armor\\\\PainDDarmor\\\\\r\n\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\meshes\\\\weapons\\\\PainDDweapons\\\\\r\n\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\PainDDarmor\\\\\r\n\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\textures\\\\weapons\\\\PainDDweapons\\\\\r\n\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\scripts\\\\ (all files starting with PainDDhorse...)\r\n\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\scripts\\\\source\\\\ (all files starting with PainDDhorse...)\r\n\r\n- And also delete this file:\r\n\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\DEATH-DEALER-PKR.esp\r\n\r\n\r\n- CHANGELOG -\r\n\r\n- v1.0 - Initial release\r\n= v1.1 - Specular effects adjusted for all items\r\n- v1.2 - Almost every item retextured and rebalanced; items\\' description changed; Slayer got a new saddle and a new hide!\r\n- v1.2 BLACK METAL - all the armor items have been retextured with something I liked more... :) It includes the Esp I\\'m currently using (minor tweaks here and there), totally optional - full version 1.2 REQUIRED to be installed before this update (then let all the new files overwrite the old ones).\r\n\r\n\r\n- THANKS -\r\n\r\nThe big one goes to Frank Frazetta for being an inspiration for generations of fantasy fans - as well for my original works - RIP Master! \r\n\r\nI would also like to extend my very special thanks to Miguelfromhell, who was brave enough to tackle my humble work and bring it up in the Skyrim world - his porting was as masterfull as his new original textures! Miguel, this wouldn\\'t have existed without you! \r\n\r\nBethesda for the great game and background for modding, as well as for the useful Construction Set provided with the game; Manilla Turtle/qlhaele for the original horse scripting; Khugan, Ghogiel, Xilver and Waalx for their contribution in modelling/texturing; Jojjo, Adonnay, Phijama for being such long-time good friends! :)\r\n\r\nEveryone who downloaded this MOD.\r\n[center][img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/18077-3-1338657150.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n- CREDITS -\r\n\r\nMiguelfromhell\r\nBattle Axe Mesh, Mesh-Porting, Ground Models, Textures, re-Textures, mesh adaptation and Edition, Quest, Quest Voices, MOD Development (for Miguel\\'s version).\r\n\r\nPainkiller97\r\nHelmet, scaled armor, scaled boots, bracers, battle-axe, war-axe, scimitar and shield - all meshes&textures; horse retexture (for Painkiller\\'s version).\r\n\r\nZenl\r\nCape model&texture from the MOD [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11784]Berserk Black Swordsman Armor[/url]\r\n\r\nAmethystDeceiver\r\nZenl for the COWL model from the MOD [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5696]Black Tower and Black Sacrament Armor pack[/url]\r\n\r\nManilla Turtle/qlhaele\r\nHorse scripts and humour from the MOD [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8939]Wobums The Black Horse[/url]",
