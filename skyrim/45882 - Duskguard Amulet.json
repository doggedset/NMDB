  "summary": "Craftable Amulet that protects vampires from the sun with a cloak of darkness.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This amulet cloaks its wearer in shadow and darkness while outdoors during daylight hours, protecting them from the sun. It will counteract the health, magicka, and stamina amount and regeneration penalties imposed by vampirism during the day. [color=#05F1F5]The effect automatically disappears at nighttime, while indoors, and during an Eclipse.[/color] The visual effect works for all characters, but only vampires will receive the stat bonuses while wearing it, and only at times when they are exposed to sunlight. [color=#05F1F5]The enchantment also correctly compensates the amount of health, magicka, and stamina given based on what stage of vampirism you're currently in.[/color] The amulet does not protect against the weakness to fire vampires have, however.\r\n\r\nThe amulet is craftable at any forge under the \"jewelry\" category, but requires several rare ingredients to keep low-level players from having access to it right away (one of each):\r\n\r\n[color=#E6B112]-Gold Ingot[/color]\r\n[color=#000000]-Ebony Ingot[/color]\r\n[color=#7B07F7]-Nightshade[/color]\r\n[color=#979B9C]-Vampire Dust[/color]\r\n[color=#FF0000]-Daedra Heart[/color]\r\n[color=#078DB3]-Void Salts[/color]\r\n\r\nThis mod is [color=#05F1F5]Dawnguard Compatible[/color]. The main version requires Dawnguard, although I have included an optional file for players who do not own Dawnguard. Unfortunately, the amulet's effects are not active while in vampire lord form (unavoidable due to your equipment being removed on activation), so you will only be protected from sunlight while in human form.\r\n\r\nI do not play a vampire character and mainly just use this to make Serana look cool (it will work on any follower you want to give it to though), but have designed this mod to work for vampire players as well. You will still get notifications for \"your vampire blood boils in the sun,\" but the amulet's enchantments are set to activate in these same situations. The magic effects are hidden so as not to clutter up your active effects menu, only one effect named \"Duskshield\" will display whenever the amulet is active in any way. It is currently designed to work around the stat penalties imposed on the player by vanilla Skyrim, so if you use an overhaul that changes the stat values the amulet will likely still function, but the net values will not be balanced out to 0.\r\n\r\n[color=#05F1F5]Note that between the hours of 5AM and 6AM, you will get the \"blood boils in the sun\" notification, but your shadowcloak won't appear. Don't worry, this is normal and the countermeasure effects are still active at this time. I just chose to make the visual effect start and end an hour after the stat effects activate/deactivate to more accurately line up with the actual sunrise/sunset in Skyrim.[/color] Likewise, even though your stat effects will deactivate along with the vampire debuffs at 7PM, I chose to keep the visual effect enabled until 8PM when it's completely dark.\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000]FOR BETTER VAMPIRES USERS:[/color] I have designed a compatibility patch to change the amulet's values to properly line up with the sunlight debuffs from BV. It will work properly with the reversed vampire stages and partial regen in low light functions whether they are enabled or disabled. Unfortunately it will not prevent sun damage over time if you had been using that option (Skyrim difficulty level makes it impossible to account for without a script since the damage will be multiplied depending on what you're playing on). I recommend you simply disable the sun damage feature. Damage to your max health and stamina [i]will[/i] scale correctly based on your level and stage of vampirism though.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFB812]THE BV PATCHES WILL ONLY WORK FOR THE 2 DAWNGUARD VERSIONS OF BV, NOT THE VANILLA SKYRIM ONES. MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE CORRECT VERSION BASED ON IF YOU INSTALLED[/color] [color=#ff0000]BETTERVAMPIRES.ESP[/color][color=#FFB812] OR [/color][color=#ff0000]BETTERVAMPIRES ML.ESP[/color]. [color=#FFB812]IF YOU INSTALL THE WRONG VERSION, YOUR GAME WILL CRASH ON LOAD. ONLY INSTALL ONE VERSION AND THE ONE THAT CORRESPONDS TO YOUR VERSION OF BV. DO NOT INSTALL THE MAIN FILE, ONLY THE COMPATIBILITY VERSION. IT CAN BE PLACED BEFORE OR AFTER BV IN YOUR LOAD ORDER AND WILL STILL WORK.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFB812]WHEN FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPDATING BV, IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CLEAN SAVE REMEMBER TO DEACTIVATE MY MOD'S .ESP AFTER UNINSTALLING BV. OTHERWISE YOUR GAME WILL CRASH ON LOAD. YOU CAN RE-ENABLE MY .ESP AFTER INSTALLING THE NEW VERSION. BASICALLY, NEVER HAVE THE PATCH .ESP ACTIVE WITHOUT HAVING BV INSTALLED.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000]FOR VAMPIRIC THIRST USERS:[/color] There is also a compatibility patch for vampiric thirst. The mod author built in a sunlight immunity keyword for magic effects in his mod to use so it was really easy to implement. Wearing the amulet will prevent you from taking damage while outside during the day. [color=#FFB812]IN ORDER FOR THIS FILE TO WORK CORRECTLY, IT MUST BE PLACED AFTER VAMPIRIC THIRST'S .ESP IN YOUR LOAD ORDER. IF YOU EVER DEACTIVATE/UNINSTALL VT, YOU MUST ALSO DEACTIVATE MY MOD, AS IT USES VT AS A MASTER AND WILL CRASH YOUR GAME ON LOAD IF VT IS NOT PRESENT. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE MAIN FILE, ONLY THE VT VERSION.[/color]\r\n\r\nCurrently, the shadowcloak visual effect will be overridden by other \"cloak\" style magic effects such as the \"flesh\" spells, flame/frost/lightning cloak, the drain spell effects while they're active, or the auras you get from standing near an atronach. I haven't been able to figure out how to make the shadowcloak take priority over these, if it's even possible at all. If anyone has some knowledge about how effect shaders work, the shader this effect uses is called DA02ArmorShadow. Leave a comment with some advice and I will try to apply it. Or I might figure it out myself at some point later on. In any case, this won't actually affect the stat properties of the amulet, only temporarily reduce the shadowcloak effect to some smoky wisps around whatever your other current cloak effect shader is.\r\n\r\n[size=4]That's it, enjoy and endorse if you like!\r\n\r\nAlso check out my other mods:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21770/?]Ultimate Dragon Allies[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41402/?]Kyne's Peace Affects Spriggans[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26086/?]Improved Sleeping Tree Sap[/url][/size]",
