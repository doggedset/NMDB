You make the \r\nshort journey west from Windhelm to her home. Upon arrival, you find a note she left \r\nat the door, asking you to meet her at a nearby place to seek treasure with her. \r\nCurious as to why she had invited you to visit, and always interested in adventure, \r\nyou decide to travel to where the note instructed you to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1267.photobucket.com/albums/jj553/jaimekelly76/Location_zps2fcf3e79.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\nWest of Windhelm, not far from Ange\\'s Mill. There is a rock pile that looks\r\nlike a man holding a lantern, on your right.  If you get to the Dragon Mound, you \r\njust missed it.  If you reached Nightgate Inn, you passed it way back there. Turn \r\naround and go back.  See map .jpg for location.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1267.photobucket.com/albums/jj553/jaimekelly76/Details-1_zpsfd2c7b27.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis in not a beginner home. Suggested level is 15 or above because there is a unmarked \r\nquest involved to gain ownership. You will have to go into a crypt to find Carah. \r\nFonnheim has a large main hall, master bedroom, master bath, kitchen and dining\r\narea, solarium with alchemy area, basement, and undercroft. \r\nBasement includes sleeping accommodation for up to 7 followers. There is also a \r\nsmithy for your armor and weapon construction needs. \r\nUndercroft contains a mage room with enchanting area, and a place for your body\r\nto lie in rest should you die.\r\nThere are racks for weapons, shields, manikins, item sorters, ingredient sorters, \r\nbookcases, and places to store various items. It is easier for the player to\r\nexplore what is available than to try to explain them all here.\r\nContainers marked with * behind the name respawn, so you should not run out of\r\nwhat is stored there.\r\nAdhar is Carah\\'s horse and for some reason she decided not to have him with her\r\non her short quest.  He can be summoned and dismissed after you learn the spell\r\nfrom the book in the great hall. He does not fast travel with you when he\\'s dismissed.\r\nThree residents that can be followers: \r\nSabreen, a spellsword that usually stays in the main hall and defends Fonnheim \r\nshould intruders gain access. Thuryn is the mage that lives in a room between \r\nthe basement and undercroft. He can sell you magical items. Ralf...Ralf is dead...\r\nbut he not only looks after his ancestors, but can follow you to guard your back.\r\nTwo residents that are not followers:\r\nBoi is the man found in the kitchen or solarium. He can teach you alchemy and \r\nsell you things. Dura works in the smithy and can not only train you, but\r\nusually has things to sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1267.photobucket.com/albums/jj553/jaimekelly76/Install-1_zpsa4f5552a.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\nManual Instructions\r\n1) Extract the contents of the ZIP folder into your Data folder\r\n2) Make sure the Fonnheim.esp is checked in the Launcher\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Instructions\r\nInstalling the Mod\r\n1) Select \\\"Download With Manager\\\" option.
