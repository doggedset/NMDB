  "summary": "A work in progress, TWP will eventually add many well-documented weaves of the One Power from the Wheel Of Time epic fantasy series by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Version 0.3 up and running! Now with 10 new spells, as detailed below. In-depth spell descriptions can be found at the readme section, and in-game via the Book \\\"Spells of the One Power\\\" located in the Archmage\\'s Quarters.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\\\"The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Fourth Era by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains called the Throat of the World. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.\\\"\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe One Power, the mystical power and energy derived from the True Source which drives all of creation, is now available in Skyrim! This mod features a collection of new spells, based on the weaves of the One Power found in the Wheel Of Time fantasy novel series by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson, as well as an in-universe explanation how these new powers came to be. \r\n\r\nThe spells can be found in a new bookshelf in the Archmage\\'s Quarters, along with a book detailing the story of the mod and another which describes the effect of each spell. The bookcase requires the Archmage\\'s key to open. If you can\\'t be bothered with that, you can use the console \\\"help\\\" command to find the spell ID, then enter it in with the \\\"player.addspell\\\" command.\r\n\r\nThis mod is currently a work in progress, but will be added to constantly to expand the repertoire of weaves to match the breadth and complexity of the Wheel of Time series. If you experience any bugs, or have any suggestions or improvements, such as balancing issues, e.t.c, please let me know and i\\'ll see what I can do. This mod is effectively teaching me how to use the creation kit, so patience may be a virtue for the time being. Your co-operation is much appreciated!\r\n\r\nPlease do not copy my work without asking permission first. I\\'d love to collaborate, especially with experienced mod authors, but I would rather not see my work plastered across somebody else\\'s mod without asking. It\\'s so easy to do, and it\\'s for the benefit of the whole community, so why not, right?\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSpells Currently In \\\"The One Power\\\" (Version 0.3)\r\n-Folded Light\r\n-Binding Air\r\n-Wave of Binding Air\r\n-Aligning the Matrix\r\n-Cloud Dancing\r\n-Blossoms of Fire\r\n-Call Lightning\r\n-Shielding\r\n-Balefire\r\n-Soldier\\'s Gambit\r\n\r\n\r\nComing Soon\r\n-Compulsion\r\n-Riven Earth\r\n-Refresh\r\n-Air Shield\r\n-Wall of Fire\r\n-(Storm that kills, turns and banishes \\\"Darkspawn,\\\" Daedra, Summons and Undead)\r\n\r\nHopefully Possible (Requires Further Investigation)\r\n-Bonding\r\n-Linking\r\n-Arrows Of Fire\r\n-Travelling\r\n-Skimming\r\n\r\nOther Future Plans:\r\n-Ter\\'Angreal, Angreal and Sa\\'Angreal to be added to the game\r\n-Custom Mesh items, including Great Serpent rings and Ajah Shawls\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nStay tuned!\r\n-DaedalusAI\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nRobert Jordan - The man who brought fantasy to life, and opened my eyes to a world I only wish I could live. Rest in Peace, James Oliver Rigney. You earned it.\r\n\r\nBrandon Sanderson - For keeping the Wheel turning after the passing of the last age. Thank you for keeping the story alive, and seeing it to the end.\r\n\r\nBethesda - For creating both the platform and the tools that allowed me to bring this mod to life.\r\n\r\nThe Nexus - For creating the system that allows users from around the world to collaborate and improve their gaming experience.",
