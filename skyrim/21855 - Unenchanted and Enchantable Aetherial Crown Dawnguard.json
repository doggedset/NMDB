  "descriptionHtml": "Unenchanted/ enchantable Aetherial Crown, for players who want to put on their own enchantment(s) rather than have the vanilla &#34;2 Guardian Stone&#34; enchantment.  Just something I made for myself and thought I&#39;d share. \r<br />\r<br />You must craft the crown at the Aetherium Forge at the end of the &#34;Lost to the Ages&#34; Dawnguard quest, this file doesn&#39;t add it.  At the forge, the crown won&#39;t have any enchantment.  You can also install the mod after you&#39;ve made the crown to remove the vanilla enchantment.  Either way, the crown will then be ready for any enchantment(s) you&#39;ve learned that apply to circlets.\r<br />\r<br />Two versions: 1 lb and default 2lb - yeah, I know Skyrim isn&#39;t necessarily in pounds.  \r<br />\r<br />Apparently works just fine with Skyrim SE (don&#39;t have the SE myself, but has been confirmed by a user).\r<br />\r<br />Dawnguard is, obviously, required.  Install via NMM/ Mod Organizer, or manually by unzipping the file and copying & pasting the esp into &#34;skyrim/data&#34;",
