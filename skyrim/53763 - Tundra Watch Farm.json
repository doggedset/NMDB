  "descriptionHtml": "[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13862/]There's an SE Version now![/url]\n<br />\n<br />Adds a player farm outside Whiterun named Tundra Watch. \n<br />I created this for one of my characters who is a Nord, Thane of Whiterun, and Talos worshiper. I made it quite a while ago and put it on the workshop. I'm just now getting around to putting it on the Nexus. \n<br />\n<br />Things included \n<br />\n<br />Exterior: \n<br />\n<br />Stables with anvil, grindstone, workbench, and tanning rack \n<br />Windmill, garden, archery target, cows, goats, and chickens \n<br />Barrels, crates, and sacks for storage \n<br />Wood chopping block \n<br />Housecarl with full schedule to patol and guard the farm while you're away, or he can join you on your adventures. \n<br />A dog which wanders outside and can also be a follower \n<br />\n<br />Main house: \n<br />\n<br />Two weapon racks, two weapon/shield plaques, small display case, working bookshelf, alchemy table, cooking pot, cooking oven, butter churn, mead barrel, small Talos shrine, bedroom for the housecarl, bedroom for the player, and a small storage room. \n<br />There is no navmesh for the top floor so the housecarl doesn't eat his breakfast in the players bedroom upstairs,which I found to be rather annoying. \n<br />\n<br />Requirements: \n<br />\n<br />Dawnguard (for the dog) and Hearthfire (for the kitchen stuff)\n<br />\n<br />This probably won't be compatible with other mods that alter the same space.",
