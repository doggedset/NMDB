  "summary": "Female Imperial Companion",
  "descriptionHtml": "IMPORTANT: If you downloaded Nina and you were not able to give her items when trying to trade with her; uninstall her and then download and install the current file for her (version 2). This should fix the issue. \r\n\r\nNina Gale is a sultry Imperial rogue looking for two things: a strong adventurer to watch her back and the next big thrill. She is essential and can be married, but one should keep in mind what they say about falling in love with a thief...You can find her inside Haelga\\'s Bunkhouse in Riften.\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\nPlace the zip file\\'s contents into your Skyrim/data folder to install and be sure to activate the ESP and ESM files in you Data Files listing.\r\n\r\nShe should also work with a vanilla install of Skyrim, but she will not look like she does in the screen shots. To get her appearance as initially created, you will need the following mods:\r\n\r\nCBBE V3 (standard body) and the hip texture compatability pack:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nBella\\'s Better Females version 3:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nCover Eyes (eyes 1 file):\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869\r\n\r\nKiller Keos Skimpy CBBE V2 Armor Set:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3654\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Blackie for his CM New Companions mod that includes a top-notch detailed tutorial on how to create Skyrim companions without the face discoloration bug. Get his mod and tutorial (contained in the mod) here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11669\r\n\r\nThe work around I found for the bug with Bella\\'s face mod (the bug involving women looking like they have faint beard stubble on their jawline and chin) is to use the standard Better Faces Version 3, and then apply the \\\"No Shine\\\" option available on her mod page.\r\n\r\nSpecial note: All of my future companions after Divada, Taja, Viin, and Kyia will be made using the Better Females by Bella mod. I switched to another mod set for faces previously due to a bug I couldn\\'t resolve (the issue with females having faint male beard stubble on their faces while using Bella\\'s). I have resolved that issue, so I\\'ll be going back to Bella\\'s for my projects from now on. You DO NOT have to switch to Bella\\'s if you use Envision faces and RANs Headmesh (what I used previously) OR if you use other face mods. All of my companions should work with other face/body mods and vanilla setups unless specifically mentioned in the description.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking, and I hope you enjoy taking Nina with you on your future adventures.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n",
