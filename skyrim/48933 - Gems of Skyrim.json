  "summary": "Update- Adds refraction, new meshes, better reflections, and no more glow-in-the-dark",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][I][u]PERMISSIONS: Because this mod includes a technique by another author (Skysan4298) I cannot give permission for this mod to be used, uploaded, altered, or ANYTHING without his permission also. Even then, I do not want this mod re-uploaded anywhere. Please respect this decision.[/u][/I][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits:[/b] This mod was inspired by Harodath&#39;s Immersive Soulgem mod. I highly recommend you go download it.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Update: I found out what the conflict is. Apparently some mods (ENB particle patch for one) alter the game&#39;s default effect meshes, and this changes all meshes that use those effects including but not limited to gemstones. Upon installing ENB particle patch I noticed the gems look absolutely awful, removing all of the effect meshes under Skyrim/Data/Meshes/effects/ambient that start with fxglowfill should fix the problem. I&#39;m not sure what meshes these mods alter, and I don&#39;t have the know how or the time to fix this problem.\r<br />Ok.... The gems weren&#39;t working but when I removed the above files the looked fine, but after replacing them they still look normal.... I&#39;m very confused by this. If anyone else has any issues like this please try messing around with the effects meshes and post your findings.[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />The refraction in this mod would not be possible without the help of Skysan4298. Because of him the gems really look much, much better. If you like refracting things, go check out his mod that makes glass armor and weapons refract light. http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29123/?\r<br />\r<br />You really should install this mod and look at some gems, the pictures don&#39;t do them justice.\r<br />\r<br />[b][I]2.0 Changes:[/I][/b]\r<br />Adds refraction to all gems (include self-refraction and refraction of nearby objects + gems)\r<br />Changed some meshes (I personally think the only ones Beth did right are the Garnet and Emerald, so those use the same meshes)\r<br />Added 1024x1024 Cubemap\r<br />Added 512x512 normal map\r<br />Got rid of the glow-in-the-dark effect (check pictures)\r<br />Mesh changes:\r<br />\r<br />Flawless gems:\r<br />     Amethyst: Better mesh with more polys\r<br />     Diamond: Better mesh with more polys\r<br />     Ruby: Same as above\r<br />     Sapphire: Entirely new mesh with many more polys\r<br />     Garnet: Same mesh\r<br />     Emerald: Same mesh\r<br />Flawed gems:\r<br />     Amethyst: Uses vanilla flawless mesh\r<br />     Diamond: Same as above\r<br />     Ruby: Same as above\r<br />     Sapphire: Same as above\r<br />     Garnet: Vanilla flawed mesh\r<br />     Emerald: Vanilla flawed mesh\r<br />\r<br />[b]To install:[/b] Drop the Meshes and Textures folder into your Data directory. No ESP.\r<br />\r<br />[b]To uninstall:[/b] Delete the files.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Future plans:[/b] Not sure. There&#39;s really not much else I can do. I can try to make the flawed gems use a different texture to make them look dirtier, and add in some chips and more irregularities but I&#39;m kinda short on time so no guarantees.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Issues:[/b] \r<br />-The gems will not refract in the inventory. No way around it.\r<br />-At certain angles some faces will appear colorless. I think this is a game engine limitation, just be thankful Skyrim even supports refraction.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Endorse if you like, comments + suggestions are welcome.[/b]",
