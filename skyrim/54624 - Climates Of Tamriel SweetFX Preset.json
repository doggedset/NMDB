  "descriptionHtml": "COT is a great mod, but I found that it gave my colors and textures a washed out look. I have tweaked this Config to deliver a vanilla enhanced look, as well as enhance color saturation a bit. Sweet FX also has a positive effect on the definition of textures. \r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: In-Game Effect is more pronounced, my screen shots don&#39;t do justice (I&#39;m looking at you, afterburner)\r<br />\r<br />-FXAA and SMAA are enabled, so I recommend disabling in game AA.\r<br />-Recommend turning in game brightness down to minimum.\r<br />\r<br />Download Sweet FX 1.5.1 Here : http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23364/\r<br />Copy to your main skyrim folder and replace with my settings",
