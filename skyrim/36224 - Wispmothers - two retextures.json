  "descriptionHtml": "I always loved the wispmothers in Skyrim, but if you got a little too close to them it was pretty apparent that they were not covered by the official Bethesda Hi-Res DLC. This mod aims to up the texture quality a bit while remaining essentially lore friendly - a task made easier by the fact that the lore surrounding Wispmothers is cloudy at best.",
