Try this mod out&#33; Four generic enchanted rings have been added to vendor item lists and to loot lists. These four types of rings give differing levels of regeneration for health, magicka and stamina. Even those who aren&#39;t vampires will find these rings useful to sell, as they will fetch a very high price from most merchants. ",
