  "modName": "Cheat Chests and Containers Collection - DELETED",
  "summary": "A collection of various chests containing useful items.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]Description\r<br />[/u][/b]A series of mods I&#39;ve made over time to help get my new characters up to speed. Some contain base items some contain overpowered items. They can be installed individually or at the same time.  \r<br />Most can be fount at the Guardian Stones for easy access upon a new character creation.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Daedric Battlemage Sack\r<br />[/u][/b](See screenshot) Can be found at the Guardian stone near the back. The items are considered cheat items since they can&#39;t be made naturally ingame.\r<br />This adds a large sack containing two sets of heavy armor specifically enchanted for endgame battlemage type characters in mind.\r<br />Each armor set, one daedric and one blades, has the same enchantments. In addition they&#39;re lighter and slightly stronger then their vanilla counterparts.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Armor Chest. [/b]Enchantment decreased all magic costs by 30%, magic recovers 150% faster, and increases magic resistance by 25%.\r<br />[b]Armor Circlet. [/b](Classified as heavy armor)[b] [/b]Decreases magic costs for all schools by 15%.\r<br />[b]Armor Gauntlets. [/b]Fortify Block, Archery, and OneHanded by 50%.\r<br />[b]Armor Boots.

They are meant for characters who wants to upgrade their weapons and armor without needing to invest in enchanting perks.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Smithy Apron. [/b]Increase Smithing by 35%\r<br />[b]Smithy Necklace. [/b]Increase Alchemy and Smithing by 35%.\r<br />[b]Smithy Ring. [/b]Increase Alchemy and Smithing by 35%.\r<br />[b]Smithy Boots.

Each is useful for smithing or enchanting potions. There is also 15 filled black soul gems for enchanting. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Spell Book Starter Chest\r<br />[/u][/b]Located near the Guardian stone a wooden chest containing a copy of most of the games spell books. (requires Dawnguard DLC).\r<br />The only ones not included are quest related.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Compatibility\r<br />[/u][/b]Any mod that changes the Guardian stones may conflict with any of the above mods, they are compatible with each other.\r<br />They have no scripts and can be uninstalled at any time, just make sure to remove and clothing and armor first before uninstalling. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Dawnguard Rune Weapons\r<br />[/u][/b]A chest inside Fort Dawnguard just left of the front door that contains some modified versions of the rune weapons cut from the DLC. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Dawnguard Rune Axe. [/b]Does additional sun damage based on number of undead killed. I kept the enchantment the same but made it lighter.\r<br />[b]Dawnguard Rune Shield (heavy). [/b]Does +10 bash damage to vampires, upon sustained block created a sun shield effect that does additional damage to undead at the cost of stamina. I kept the enchantment the same but made this one heavy armor with a slight armor armor rating boost. \r<br />[b]Dawnguard Rune Shield (light). [/b]Does +10 bash damage to vampires, upon sustained block created a sun shield effect that does additional damage to undead at the cost of stamina.I kept the enchantment the same but made it lighter and stronger. \r<br />[b]Dawnguard Rune Hammer.
