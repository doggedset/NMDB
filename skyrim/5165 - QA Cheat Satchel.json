  "descriptionHtml": "The QA containers hold just about every item in the game. They are located in a satchel in the Torturers Chamber in Hegen that you go through at the start of the game.\r\n\r\n*Warning: The All Enchanted Armors and All Enchanted Weapons containers take a while to load, you will think your game has frozen but just give it time and it should load up.*\r\n\r\n*Warning 2: There are several quest items in the containers that could break a quest.*\r\n\r\nThis is a just simple mod, altering this one container for those that don\\'t want to use the console. It shouldn\\'t interfere with any other mods. ",
