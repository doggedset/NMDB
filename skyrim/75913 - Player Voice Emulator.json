  "descriptionHtml": "EmulatesÂ the player saying a certain voice set chosen by the esp.\r<br />An NPC that you cannot see and doesn&#39;t get in your way will say whichever voice set you choose.\r<br />There is over 90 voice sets in this file. ONLY USE ONE ESP VOICE AT A TIME\r<br />NO REQUIREMENTS, NOT EVEN SKSE. :D\r<br />\r<br />SIDENOTE:\r<br />I havent tested all the voices, Voices like Dagon wont have much effect. Ill still leave them in the file for reference.\r<br />For mods that might add voicesets upon these voices.\r<br />\r<br />Create Your Own Voice Set Optional:\r<br />Modders resource that allows you to put in your own voicesets and upload them &#34;Aslong as you credit me&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />If you run into any problems disable mod save reenable refresh cell\r<br />If you get stuck jump over npc\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE UPGRADE TO V1.1 MORE RESPONSES&#33;. :)\r<br />IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THE VOICES USE BSA EXTRACTOR TO EXTRACT THE VOICES INTO A FILE THEN UNFUZZER ON NEXUS TO TURN THEM INTO WAV\r<br />I BELIEVE THAT UPLOADING SUCH A THING WOULD PUT MYSELF IN DANGER OF COPYWRITE INFRINGMENT SO IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THE VOICES DO THIS",
