  "descriptionHtml": "===========================\r\nEnhanced Castle Volkihar\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nSeptember 2012. Requires Dawnguard.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds several changes to the Castle Volkihar Location to make it more pleasant for a vampire.\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]Because of the modifications, install this mod only after finishing the main Dawnguard questline and unlock the Courtyard access otherwise you will face bugs ![/b][/color]\r\n\r\nA new lighting system (I feel that vanilla lighting is too bright for a vampire place), a new guard system with the Soul Cairn skeletons, more miscalleneous items (candles, etc), more NPCs (like a bard and slaves), rearranged Courtyard and more...\r\n\r\nLook at the screenshots to get an idea about changes.\r\n\r\n===========================\r\nInstallation/Unistallation\r\n===========================\r\nBefore installing, and by precaution, take back your items you may put in the Castle\\'s containers. Except the big chest in the Boss Room, no other container should have been removed.\r\n\r\nTo install, just put the .esp file into your Data directory and activate it. \r\n\r\nTo uninstall, simply remove the CastleVolkiharEnhancement.esp after taking back your items from new containers.\r\n\r\n===============================\r\nTroobleshooting/Uncompatibility\r\n===============================\r\nCompatible with almost anything which doesn\\'t change the Castle Volkihar.\r\nDon\\'t install if you haven\\'t finished the main Dawnguard questline.",
