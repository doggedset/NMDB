  "descriptionHtml": "This is my very first mod, and first time using the creation kit, so it is not perfect. Jesus does not talk, but he interacts. He is tall. He is essential. Jesus has some special attributes, like fast speed, etc. This mod is designed just 4 fun purposes only. He should be near where heimskr loudly voices his beliefs in front of Dragonsreach. This took me 2.5-3 hours to do. All you have to do is place the esp file into the data folder, and Jesus is in your Whiterun. Please let me know if I did anything wrong or theres any problems. \r\n\r\nIn Version 3: Jesus is essential (V2 as well), it requires apachiisky hair, he looks better, he respawns (V2 as well), he has a tiny bit more dialogue somehow. If there are more than one Jesus, should fix it ok by click on the extra Jesus\\'s in the console and typing disable. If that doesn\\'t work, i don\\'t know what you should do. this is an issue i came across and the fix seemed to work so far.\r\n\r\nversion 3 is the best so far and i want to make him a follower, but do not know how.",
