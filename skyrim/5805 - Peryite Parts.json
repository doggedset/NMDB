  "descriptionHtml": "_____________\r\nPeryite Parts\r\n_____________\r\n\r\nThis \\'mod\\' is just a simple little batch file that will instantly add to your inventory the four items that are necessary to begin the quest called: \\\"The Only Cure\\\".\r\n\r\nInstallation And Usage:\r\n\r\n 1.Download and extract the file to your Skyrim folder (usually \\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim) The one where TESV.exe resides.\r\n\r\n 2.Start/load your game as you normally would\r\n\r\n 3.While in-game, open the console (usually the tilde ` key)\r\n \r\n 4.Type the words: \\\"bat peryite\\\" without the quotes\r\n\r\n 5.Press the tilde key again to close the console. The items    you need to begin the quest should now be in your inventory.  \r\n                      \r\nGreat Success!!!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI\\'ve tested this file both with and without having the relevant quest in my journal. Seems to work fine either way.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope this file helps a few people like myself who, are not only hopelessly lazy, but also have limited time in which to play this awesome game! \r\n\r\nSo, go on, get outta\\' here! Don\\'t you have a quest to do? :+)  ",
