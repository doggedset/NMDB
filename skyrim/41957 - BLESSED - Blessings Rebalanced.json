  "descriptionHtml": "[b][i]REQUIRES DRAGONBORN AND DAWNGUARD DLCS[/i][/b]\r\n\r\nTweaks and balancing to Skyrim\\'s various \\\"blessings\\\", making them worth acquiring and useful for gameplay. By default, most of the blessings you get from shrines are near useless and does not impact gameplay enough to worth using. The amulets in particular, which are quickly replaced early in the game just by enchanting rings and necklaces with better stats. The purpose of this mod is to fix that issue, especially for roleplayers such as myself that like having their characters act according to lore for immersion, but don\\'t like the gameplay suffering from doing so. I try to make the blessing more powerful, but not to the point where it becomes overpowered. Also, they have been modified to fit the image of the deities based on the lore of the games. The changes were designed to be played in higher difficulties or for those that have difficulty and gameplay mods. I\\'ve also removed the shrines\\' ability to cure diseases for balancing purposes.\r\n\r\n[b][i]Update: NEW BLESSING TWEAKS FOR DAWNGUARD AND DRAGONBORN DLC:[/i][/b]\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSING OF AURIEL:[/b]\r\nFortify Archery by 20%\r\nRestoration spells are 10% stronger during the day\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSING OF AZURA:[/b]\r\nResist magic by 15% (20% if player has Azura\\'s Star) (25% if player is Dunmer)\r\nFortify Magicka regeneration by 15% (20% if player has Azura\\'s Star) (25% if player is Dunmer)\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSING OF BOETHIAH[/b]\r\nFortify One-Handed by 15% (20% if player has completed Boethiah\\'s Calling) (25% if player is Dunmer)\r\nFortify Heavy Armor by 15% (20% if player has completed Boethiah\\'s Calling) (25% if player is Dunmer)\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSING OF MEPHALA:[/b]\r\nPrices are 10% better (15% if player has completed The Whispering Door) (20% if player is Dunmer)\r\nSneaking is better by 5% (10% if player has completed The Whispering Door) (15% if player is Dunmer)\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSING OF AKATOSH:[/b] \r\nFortify Health, Magicka, and Stamina by 20 points\r\nFortify Health, Magicka, and Stamina regeneration by 20%\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSING OF ARKAY:[/b]\r\nFortify Health by 50 points\r\nHealth regenerates twice as fast when near death\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSING OF DIBELLA:[/b]\r\nFortify Speech by 25 points (50 points if player is female)\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSING OF JULIANOS:[/b]\r\nFortify Magicka by 50 points\r\nSpells in all schools are 10% stronger\r\nResist magic by 50% when near full health\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSING OF KYNARETH:[/b]\r\nFortify Stamina by 50 points\r\nResist Poison and Disease by 50% when player is equal or above 50% Health\r\nFortify Stamina regeneration by 50% when player is equal or below 20% Health\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSINGS OF MARA:[/b]\r\nFortify Restoration magic by 30% (50% if used on an ally)\r\nAll skills increase faster by 10%\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSINGS OF STENDARR:[/b]\r\nFortify Block by 20%\r\nFortify Light and Heavy Armor by 10%\r\nResist 10% physical damage when player is equal or below 25% Health\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSING OF TALOS:[/b]\r\nShout cooldown is reduced by 30%\r\nWeapons are 5% stronger\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSING OF ZENITHAR:[/b]\r\nPrices are better by 20%\r\nFortify Smithing skill by 10%\r\nFortify Alchemy by 10%\r\nCarry Weight increases by 20 points (40 points if player is in full health)\r\n\r\n[b]BLESSING OF NOCTURNAL:[/b]\r\nSneaking is better by 15%\r\nIllusion spells cost 10% less to cast at night\r\nPrices are 10% better\r\n\r\n[i]As for the amulets, they\\'re about at half the strength of the shrine blessings. Equip them along with the shrine blessings to show your faith and have the blessings at 1.5 times their power![/i]\r\n\r\n[b]=== INSTALLATION ===[/b]\r\nUse any mod manager like NMM or just manually extract the files into Skyrim\\'s Data folder. If you manual installed, don\\'t forget to tick/activate the esp before starting the game. Although unnecessary, if you really want to be safe, remove any amulets or wait until the blessing wear off from your character.\r\n\r\n[b]=== UPDATING ===[/b]\r\nUse NMM or just replace the old file with the new one.\r\n\r\n[b]=== UNINSTALLATION ===[/b]\r\nRemove or delete Blessed.esp and as with installation instructions, unequip any amulets and/or wait until your blessings wear off to be safe.\r\n\r\n[b]=== LOAD ORDER ===[/b]\r\nAnywhere will work.\r\n\r\n[b]=== COMPATIBILITY ===[/b]\r\nNot compatible with anything that changes the same thing (obviously). This mod also does not use any scripts.\r\n\r\n[b]=== ISSUES ===[/b]\r\nThe effects description in the game\\'s UI may not be the same as what the blessings really do. For now I don\\'t know how to get around this, since the game sometimes automatically creates the effects description of every equippable item. I will try fix it once i find a way to work around this issue.\r\n\r\n[b]=== FUTURE PLANS ===[/b]\r\nTweaking other blessings from other deities too, including the ones from the DLCs or various quests in the game.",
