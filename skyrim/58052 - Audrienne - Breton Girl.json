  "descriptionHtml": "[u]Audrienne -  Breton Girl[/u]\r<br />\r<br />I tried to recreate one of my favorite chars from Oblivion but ended up with something completly new. However I am quite satisfied with the result, so I want to share it with the community. :)\r<br />\r<br />This is my first upload at Skyrim Nexus and I hope to make not too many mistakes and break noones computer in the process. ;)\r<br /> \r<br />Constructive feedback is welcome. \r<br />\r<br />The 7z-File contains two savegames, one at the beginning of the tutorial in Helgen Keep right after you get your controls from the game, the second one is a bit later in Riverwood shortly after the tutorial ended.\r<br />\r<br />You need the following files to get the same look (all on Nexus):\r<br />\r<br />CBBE 3.3 with activated face pack 2666\r<br />CBBE Female Texture Replacer NMM Installer 4686\r<br />Remodeled Armor for CBBE Bodyslide TBBP  (see mods page for required additional mods) 25259\r<br />OblivionHairPackAIO 22598 \r<br />More Hair Colors Updated for Dawnguard 27755\r<br />\r<br />If the hair is missing after loading the game you have to use showracemenu to get it back.  \r<br />\r<br />I use quite a few mods for my Skyrim, if you want to avoid problems with your mod-setup it might be a good idea to load the face on your own char via SkyrimFaceTransfer 15307.\r<br />\r<br />Audrienne is almost complete, but there a few minor problems left with her cheeks I can´t get rid off (a bit jagged if you look from certain angles) . If anyone can fix that better than me - be my guest. :) \r<br />\r<br />Installation: Drop the files in your Skyrim saves folder under C:&#92;users&#92;username&#92;documents&#92;my games&#92;Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />Update 13.09.2014 - LittleFighter created a (slightly different) preset for Audrienne - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58054/?\r<br />\r<br />I recommend using this if you have loading or saving problems with my savegames and don´t want to use SkyrimFaceTransfer. \r<br />\r<br />Update 14.09.2014 - after some problems were cleared version 0.1 of Audrienne Follower Mod is online -&gt; http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58129/?",
