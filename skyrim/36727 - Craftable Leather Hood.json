  "descriptionHtml": "Ok this isnt anything fancy just a unenchanted thieves guild hood that is craftable in the forge and temperable. \r\n\r\nI made it quite strong because I like how it looks and I wanted it strong so it could last through out game. I also made it craftable with the elven armor perk so it could also be tempered to legendary quality. I also made it so you can use circlets with it.\r\n\r\nArmor Rating: 20\r\nWeight: 1\r\nValue: 10\r\n\r\nMaterials\r\nForging: 2 Leather 1 Leather Strip\r\nTempering: 1 Leather\r\n\r\nArmor in the picture is the Mercenary Triss armor from the Triss Armor Retextured found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4708\r\n",
