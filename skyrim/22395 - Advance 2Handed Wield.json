  "descriptionHtml": "For a LONG LONG TIME... i\\'ve been dreaming to dual wield a 2H wpn on both hands, but never have I a chance to do so... Tytanis recreated a Warmaster-ONLY equip-able 2Hs. \r\nHe inspired me to make my own... now it is time to share it.\r\n\r\n===================================================\r\nCheck the video for a better idea how this mod works\r\n===================================================\r\n\r\n===========\r\nWhat I did:\r\n===========\r\nAdded ALL New 2H weapons to the recipe lists. They can be crafted as the usual weapons & enhanced as usual. I do not include any enhanced weapon. 2H Weapons of all Material Type has been added.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nWhat this mod do:\r\n==================\r\nAllows dual wield of ANY Two-Handed Weapons.\r\nTwo-Handed Weapons can now be equipped single-handed, with magic, with shield or with Fist.\r\n\r\n*equiping 2 Two-handed at the same time will revert the attack animations to their original 2-handed animations* Attack, Block, Power Attack, Bash (when blocking)*\r\n\r\n*equipping a 1H weapon on your RIGHT-Hand & a 2H at your Left, will disable the 2H power-attack, it will become a block instead.*\r\n\r\n*Equipping 2H at Right, 1H at Left, you can use both 2H & 1H power attacks, but u cant block and u cant use the DUAL-WIELD-1H-Power-Attack*\r\n\r\nThe NEW 2H weapons are labelled with \\\" - Remodeled\\\"\r\nThey are LIGHTER, FASTER, a little More expensive ($), a little less damage output (because now u can wield a Greatsword & a Shield/etc)\r\n\r\n**extra weapon textures & models are made by  Lrsamways (Extended Vanilla Weapons)**\r\n\r\n==============\r\nRequirements:\r\n==============\r\nSkyrim patch 1.7.7 above, Dawnguard, \r\n-------->>>Extended Vanilla Weapons (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19611)<<<-----------\r\n\r\n============\r\nInstallation:\r\n============\r\nUse NMM or Manual Install by extracting to the Data folder (where you have installed Skyrim\r\n\r\n=============\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n=============\r\n*Minor glitch of animations or total full animation bug, this is random, but occus more frequently especially during battle when switching weapons without sheathing (less likely) OR equipping Two-Handed at Left hand instead of Right Hand (occasionally)*\r\n\r\n===========\r\nWARNINGS:\r\n===========\r\nConsidered you have been warned!!! This may glitches up your animations if you DID NOT heed what i said, so quick save/ALWAYS SAVE a backup copy, just in case things goes wrong\r\n\r\n===========\r\nSuggestions:\r\n===========\r\nIf you encounter crashes, try running SKSE instead of the usual launcher\r\n\r\n=================================\r\nThis MOD works even better with:\r\n=================================\r\nDance of Death: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10906\r\nUFO: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037\r\nBYOG: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18474\r\n\r\nIf you found any bugs, please report to me\r\n\r\n=============\r\nChange Log:\r\n============\r\nv1.0\r\n-added basic 2H weapons to Remodeled crafting List\r\n\r\nV1.1\r\n1) Now includes all 2H Weapons from Extended Vanilla Weapons  \r\n2) Added Dawnguard DLC 2H Weapons (includes Skyforged)\r\n3) Fixed some minor mistakes\r\n4) Added some missing basic 2H Weapons\r\n\r\n=============\r\nFuture Plans:\r\n=============\r\n- Add Daedric Artifacts\r\n- Add more custom 2Hs",
