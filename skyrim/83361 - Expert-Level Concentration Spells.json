  "summary": "Adds more powerful versions of Flames, Sparks and Frostbite",
  "descriptionHtml": "I liked using Flames, Sparks, and Frostbite, but was disappointed that they were ineffective at higher levels. I created this mod to fix that. It includes new spells titled Expert Flames, Expert Sparks and Expert Frostbite (it does not replace the original [novice] versions).\r<br />\r<br />They are simply higher level versions of the original ones. They&#39;re Expert level spells, and are about thrice as powerful.Â \r<br />\r<br />Is it OP? No. Its cost, level and damage are all totally balanced.\r<br />\r<br />Found near the blue glowing thing in the Hall of the Elements (the main room) at the College of Winterhold.",
