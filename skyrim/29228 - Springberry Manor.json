  "summary": "A home near Whiterun Stables. Requires Dawnguard and Hearthfire, and highly suggested to have your game patched to 1.8.15.0.7 or higher.  Read the mod description for more plus check out the images. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "*Dragonborn Edition is out. I&#39;ve uploaded bsa versions of the mod as well. Choose only one version. Either the Dragonborn version or the regular version, BSA or Loose file. Read the requirements below as well as the update section for more information.*\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />You must have Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and updated Skyrim to version 1.8.15.0.7 or higher.\r<br />The Dragonborn Edition also requires Dragonborn in addition to Dawnguard and Hearthfire, and Skyrim updated to version 1.9.32.0.8 or higher.\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />I wanted my own home for Skyrim since day 1. After many failed attempts and a near completed Dawnguard styled castle, I decided to try to make a much smaller home. With Hearthfire&#39;s release, and after viewing the homes on youtube, I got a good idea of what I wanted my home to be like. One of their homes, but at the same time exactly how I wanted it. I tried building a home with vanilla meshes, but eventually I caved in and got Hearthfire to finish it up. I was also inspired by several homes I used while playing Skyrim so there may be little tidbits of similarity to other homes here and there. Without all that I wouldn&#39;t have been able to make this and its not a direct copy of their homes either. It&#39;s still unique in the end. \r<br />\r<br />Springberry Manor is near Whiterun between Whiterun Stables and the Western Watchtower.\r<br />\r<br />The name isn&#39;t really the best, but I had to call it something other then boring old, &#34;Faelrin&#39;s House Mod&#34;. Plus those recolored Whiterun trees sorta look like they have blue berry things on them and it was designed to work with the summer edition of Vurt&#39;s Flora Overhaul.\r<br />\r<br />Includes:\r<br />Numerous resources to give it a unique feel\r<br />A simple layout with three rooms\r<br />A kitchen, dinning area, a bedroom, library, enchanting and alchemy stations, and smithing\r<br />Hopefully enough storage, crafting, gardening, and planters on the porches containing most plants, and dragon priest mask busts\r<br />Interior and Exterior Navmeshed\r<br />A stable with two unique horses\r<br />\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />-Do not re-upload this entire mod as is too another site. \r<br />-Absolutely under no circumstances shall you upload this to be sold on Steam Workshop or any other site. \r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />Bethesda for Skyrim, Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn, and the Creation Kit\r<br />Oaristys and Tony67 for their Modder&#39;s Resource Pack\r<br />Tamira for the New Plant resource\r<br />eldiabs for the esp with the already created mannequins, bookshelves, and the shield racks\r<br />Blary for the PotionShelf, BookSets OpenBooks, and FoodContainer resources\r<br />Ithlia for the gem resource from Fairview Cabin\r<br />lilith for their Catering and Ready Clutter resources\r<br />Artisanix for the Paintings and Frames resource\r<br />The_Funktasm for the golden treasure urn from Morrowind Style Clutter\r<br />AlienSlof for Slof&#39;s Horses\r<br />Ztree and Elinen for their Hoddminir Water Plants\r<br />Berticus0001 for the Hearthfire Dairy Goods Resource and the Cow Milking script\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;d also like to thank the Skyrim modding community as a whole for the inspiration I needed to finally create my own house mod. This is something I&#39;ve wanted since day 1 of Skyrim&#39;s Release.\r<br />\r<br />Homes that seriously inspired me:\r<br />ArtsyCat&#39;s Lakeview Hideaway\r<br />Ithilia&#39;s Farview Cabin\r<br />Klandestyne&#39;s Frostfang Manor\r<br />Mattcm919&#39;s Dragon Falls Manor\r<br />Blary&#39;s Pinewoods Cottage\r<br />And Bethesda&#39;s homes such as Lakeview Manor and Breezehome.\r<br />\r<br />Recommended Mods:\r<br />Vurt&#39;s Flora Overhaul - Summer Edition\r<br />The Unofficial Skyrim, Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn patches by Arthmoor and Kivan \r<br />The homes listed above\r<br />\r<br />Bugs/Incompatibilities:\r<br />The animations are a little funky with the alchemy and enchanting stations due to the fact they were shrunk down.\r<br />Food will not respawn (inside the house), this has been here since day 1, I just failed to test it/mention it.\r<br />\r<br />If there are incompatibilities with other mods please let me know. \r<br />Known incompatible mods:\r<br />Whiterun Outskirts Market\r<br />Black Wolf Lodge\r<br />Four Seasons Inn\r<br />O_G Buy Tamriel\r<br />Elysium Estate\r<br />\r<br />Updates:\r<br />1.0 - 1.1: Added Key storage, changed &#34;Poisons&#34; to &#34;Damage Poisons&#34;, removed the havok from the containers that still had it. Removed the interior fog and brightened the lighting up a little. \r<br />\r<br />1.1 - 1.2: Moved Key storage next to the alchemy lab. Fixed spelling errors. Added Wood Chopping Block underneath the porch by the stable. Added Dragon Priest Mask Busts by the door where the buggy Weapon Plaques were. Removed the dead tree in the backyard, and did some more landscape texturing and height mapping to make it a little better. Added three more soil planters to the garden. \r<br />\r<br />1.2 - 1.3: Set all storage to player owned as well as the bed. Improved exterior by adding trees and bushes, an apiary, an animal pen, and a pond. Apiary is respawning. Fixed the issue with not being able to pick plants on the porch (you can pick them but might still have a little trouble with the creep cluster and the giant lichen). Fixed a shield rack that gave me issues. Added light to the back of the house. Also added two new horses, Cocoa and Moonlight, using Slof&#39;s awesome horses. Cocoa is a mare, and Moonlight is a stallion. \r<br />\r<br />1.3 - 1.4: Exterior navmesh finished. Added a mudcrab to the pond, and 3 chickens, 2 goats, and 1 cow to the animal pen area. \r<br />\r<br />1.4 - 1.5: Fixed dragon priest mask busts so they don&#39;t respawn. \r<br />\r<br />1.5 - 1.6: Fixed mannequin &#34;jumping/moving&#34; issue which in turn should fix the invisible wall issue that many had. They now have navmesh under them, so they won&#39;t &#34;jump&#34; to the nearest navmesh. Also gave the interior and exterior its own location data. The horse will now spawn with you on fast travel. The bed also gives you a well rested bonus now, however you won&#39;t receive a message for it. It will be there in your active effects though.\r<br />\r<br />1.6 - 1.7: Fixed the tristars mesh from not loading in the bsa version, and removed the full lod from the stable pieces for both the normal and dragonborn versions.\r<br />\r<br />1.7 - 1.8: Redid the planters. Rather then being filled with plants, each planter holds four of the Hearthfire soils so one can choose what plants to have growing. This will also eliminate any issues like being unpickable. Added the milking script from Bert&#39;s Hearthfire Dairy Goods Resources, so the cow can be milked for 2 Jugs of Milk now. Also created a churn that will give you four butters in place of the default one. \r<br />\r<br />1.8 - 1.9: Cleaned the esp with Tes5Edit.\r<br />\r<br />Dragonborn Edition:\r<br />Added some of the new lamp posts around the exterior, and replaced the lanterns by the stable with the new lamps as well. Added three new figures from the loader screen art on one of the bookshelves. \r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Drag the bsa or the meshes and textures folders and esp into the data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />I highly don&#39;t recommend this after learning about how turning off mods can easily damage your save especially if you plan to use this and save it. Try it out before saving it, and if you don&#39;t like it then you will be safe to uninstall it. \r<br />\r<br />Delete the esp and any other file associated with this mod. Make sure you got everything out of Springberry Manor before doing so. \r<br />I&#39;d also suggest saving inside Whiterun before uninstalling if you were playing with it previously.",
