  "summary": "A mesh and texture replacer for the Solstheim map.",
  "descriptionHtml": "When I finally reached Solstheim I was shocked how bad the map there looked, the mesh was low detail and had uv errors and the texture was tiny and blurry as hell. The texture from &#34;A Quality World Map&#34; was bigger, but did not show the real landscape, most of it was just a single tiled pattern.\r<br />\r<br />So I decided to do something about that. Basically, these are just meshes and textures created with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4727/?]Oscape[/url], but Ethatron himself never uploaded high quality meshes and textures for Solstheim, as he did for Skyrim itself.\r<br />\r<br />Features:\r<br />\r<br />- detailed high quality meshes for the Solstheim map and the distant Morrowind landscape\r<br />- high-res (2k) texture only for Solstheim itself, but not the surrounding distant landscape, as you never see it up close, anyway\r<br />- optional texture with roads (redrawn from the texture from &#34;A Quality World Map&#34;)\r<br />- 2k normal map for Solstheim, 512x512 ones for the surrounding landscape\r<br />\r<br />Sure, everybody could make these for themselves with Oscape, but maybe not everyone knows how to use it properly. But If you do want to create your own meshes for Solstheim, make sure you set the sea level to 256 in the Oscape Preview tab, otherwise the water plane will be too low.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Installation[/size][/b]\r<br />Just download the version you prefer, with or without roads, and install with NMM, MO, Wrye Bash, or manually if you like.",
