  "modName": "No Frost Slow Down Effect",
  "summary": "Completely eliminates the frost slowdown effect.",
  "descriptionHtml": "In my game whenever i get hit by frost magic, especially continuous spells like dragon breath, my character slows to practically a standstill. I think you can see the problem with that. Now, this might be due to a conflict in the 150+ mods I use, I think it stacks weirdly with changes made by SkyRe, but I have found no solution to this. So I simply edited the effects so they try to make their calculations using (nonexistent) scripts, so they don&#39; t do anything anymore.\r<br />I would love to find a more elegant solution to this but for now I&#39; ll use this. If anyone has any suggestions on how to solve this problem please post it in the comments.\r<br />Put this mod AFTER any mods that affect spells, just to be safe.\r<br />Enjoy.",
