  "descriptionHtml": "WARNING:\r\n\r\nNexus Forum Rules: \\\"Don\\'t like it, then don\\'t say anything and pass in silence.\\\" \r\n\r\nI built this \\\"project\\\" to better learn how to make custom armor in 3DS Max and I haven\\'t seen a \\\"real\\\" mesh based catsuit uploaded yet. In Lew of a better place to use it as \\\"armor\\\" in the game, I set it up for the DB because it\\'s fitting; well, the black one is. :-P Feel free to rename it as you see fit for other armors and clothes. \r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nCBBEv3 feet by Caliente.\r\n\r\nThe mesh started off based on someone else\\'s design, but it was so far off Skyrim\\'s skeleton, plus the \\\"enhancements\\\" I made, and the custom textures, I feel safe in calling it my own now. Actually, I don\\'t even know who the original author is. If the original from years back is yours and you can prove it, you name goes here. (just let me know)  \r\n\r\nReplaces:\r\n\r\nDB Shrouded Armor. (catsuit)\r\n\r\nDB Shrouded Hood with mask. (latex hood)\r\n\r\nDB Shrouded Feet. (cute shackles) \r\n\r\nDB Gloves. (no change) \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like any of the above, just do a manual install of the desired mods.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe body doesn\\'t change size so if you don\\'t use the hand, or feet armor at the same there, there could be some clipping, weirdness etc.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s very close to the CBBEv3 \\\"silly huge\\\" body style, but there isn\\'t much reason you shouldn\\'t be able to use it with any that your currently running. The breasts, buttocks, hips etc could change size drastically though since I made it really curvy. \r\n\r\nAs this was a \\\"learning project,\\\" I HAVE NOT completed a lot of testing with mixing and matching this armor with other kinds etc. There would probably be some clipping issues with more than a few. Please don\\'t ask me to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe DB gloves are unmodified, so either don\\'t use them etc, or live with it. I might do the gloves someday in the future.\r\n\r\nThere is some minor clipping on the back of the wrists. After 12 hours, I decided to say it\\'s \\\"good enough\\\" and called it a day.\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\n\r\nJammer \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
