  "summary": "The mod dissapeared (weird) & I loved it so I&#39;m backing it up&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "This adds one minion per mastery perk, provides a book that allows you to resurrect the dead, allows minions to level up with you, gives powers to edit your minion&#39;s equipment or kill them outright, teleports them to your location when getting too far away, drastically increases the duration & raises the level cap on each resurrection spell.\r<br />\r<br />Sadly this is not mine & I&#39;d give credit if I knew the author&#39;s name but I do not. If anyone is to let me know &/or find out why the mod dissapeared I will give credit. Thanks.",
