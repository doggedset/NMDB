  "modName": "Fortify Fortification - An Exploit Overhaul",
  "summary": "Establishes synergy between your fortified personal magical aura and appropriate fortifying apparel.",
  "descriptionHtml": "As you consume a fortifying potion, your personal aura becomes suffused with the power of a relevant school of magic. If you garb yourself while so empowered, your intensified aura will resonate with a suitably harmonious fortifying garment, imbuing it with extra potency as long as you remain clad. Should you choose to disrobe, the mystical link between you and your clothing will sever, and the effect will instantly dissipate.\r\n\r\nI meditated upon Bug 439 with tejon Paarthurnax to learn a little of how Skyrim magic works, and in the process realized I could make something like this for laughs. If you\\'re feeling weirdly nostalgic and actually want to use it, the handwavy roleplaying flavor text above may help you feel less guilty.\r\n\r\nThe 10 or 11 ITM records are supposed to be here, because they will kick in appropriately if you are running this mod somewhere below USKP.\r\n\r\nRequires Update, possibly 1.9.29 or higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
