At the headwaters of this charnal tide was Tyr, hero, slayer of the Last Dragon in Cyrodil, great warrior of the Blades and slayer of the vampire lord Athelstan. He alone remained standing at the end of the battle, though grievously wounded. Twas only upon receiving word from a squire that the battle was truly won and over that he fell to his knees, the last of his lifeforce ebbing forth. Tis said that as he died, his blood was absorbed by his armour, and a flash of fiery radiance flared from it for a moment. No man, no matter his strength, could undo the buckles of the armour and it was buried with Tyr in his great tomb in a distant land.

Lorekeepers and scholars still remember his tale, however, and speculation as to the whereabouts of his tomb has led seekers of both knowledge and treasure north to Skyrim, Tyr’s homeland. Some say he is buried within the city-tomb of Saarthal, while others say his remains are in a forgotten Blades temple somewhere near Markarth. Regardless of the location of his tomb, his tale and the secrets of his armour have been recently unearthed in the College of Winterhold. Only the finest smiths of Tamriel could even hope to make the suit, but making it even more difficult is the fact that it requires the particular magic and fires found only in the Skyforge. Thus, smiths who do not have the trust of the Companions of Jorrvaskr can only dream of forging such a masterpiece. These suits are but pale copies of the rumoured might of Tyr’s own set, however, and thus the quest for his tomb continues…\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/7189/36622333.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n2 Leather\r\n\r\n3 Leather Strips\r\n\r\n4 Gold ignot\r\n\r\n4 Steel Ignot\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/4990/guantlets.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n1 Gold Ignot\r\n\r\n1 Leather\r\n\r\n2 Steel Ignot\r\n\r\n2 Leather Strips\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/4943/helmetw.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n1 Gold Ignot\r\n\r\n1 Leather\r\n\r\n1 Leather Strips\r\n\r\n2 Stell Ignot \r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/831/bootspg.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n1 Gold Ignot\r\n\r\n2 Steel Ignot\r\n\r\n1 Leather\r\n\r\n2 leather Strips\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/3140/shieldnx.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n2 Gold Ignot\r\n\r\n2 Steel Ignot\r\n\r\n1 Leather Strip\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]====Added note====[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nEach armour piece has different perks, juggernaut, undead damage modifer, well fitted and bashing etc.. when the next update rolls out a second set, Tyr\\'s actual armour will be more \\\"powerful\\\".\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/1066/installt.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b]*Requires Dawnguard*[/b]\r\n\r\nEither download manually and extract the files to your Skyrim/Data Directory\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nDownload and activate through NMM\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/9233/uninstall.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\ndelete the .esp file and also go into your skyrim/data/textures/armor and delete the \\\"BLADhegonus\\\" file.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\ndeactivate and remove with the NMM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img542.imageshack.us/img542/8114/faqcl.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]Q:[/color][/b] Is this awesome armour craftable?\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]A:[/color][/b] Yes, yes it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]Q:[/color][/b] My game crashes after the Bethesda logo or i just see floating heads, am i missing something?\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]A:[/color][/b] Indeedy, you need Dawnguard to use this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]Q:[/color][/b] where can i find this decent bit of kit?\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]A:[/color][/b] you can craft it at the Skyforge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]Q:[/color][/b] Are you going to do any other variations of this armour?\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]A:[/color][/b] i will be doing a beefed up version with an added dungeon for the next update.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]Q:[/color][/b] if i really like this armour, what can i do to help?\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]A:[/color][/b] well, you can track and endorse the mod! or if you have a high end computer and can take beautiful pics, i\\'ll be needing your assistance probably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]Q:[/color][/b] This armour rocks!\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]A:[/color][/b] Not really a question, but i\\'ll take it :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]Q:[/color][/b] What ENB series were used for the screenshots?\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]A:[/color][/b] E ENB, True Vision ENB, cinematic ENB and sharpshooters (the really colourful ones)\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]REQUIRES DAWNGUARD[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n\r\nDarkAngel13 - for the awesome pics [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/771437/]Darkangel13[/url]\r\n\r\nBreandan - For the lore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[/center]",
