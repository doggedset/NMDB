  "descriptionHtml": "Changed magic lights radius from 450 to 850 and added realtime shadows.  \r\n\r\nMagic lights = Magelight and Candlelight. Both are affected.\r\n\r\nMost mods I\\'ve seen have RTime shadows on both torches and magic lights, but I wanted shadows ONLY on magic lights. Some had bigger radius but no shadows, and it was weird because a Magelight cast on a room would lit up other rooms if they were close enough. With RT shadows, this won\\'t happen :p and it will look natural. \r\n\r\nI\\'m using Superb ENB-RL on the screenshots:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11318\r\n(performance preset)\r\n\r\nI highly recommend: \r\nMy documents > My games > Skyrim > SkyrimPrefs > iBlurDeferredShadowMask=3\r\n\r\nNOTES: \r\n1- The strange lines and flickering on some shadows are still there, sorry... this is a problem with how the shadows are set up within skyrims engine and I don\\'t know how to fix it. If someone knows how please tell me. Setting iBlurDeferredShadowMask to 3, 5 or something higher than 1, helps a little with this problem. ENB\\'s detailed shadows help too. \r\n\r\n2- Since one of the official updates for the game, something was changed by bethesda and now, while outside, magic lights don\\'t cast a shadow, they only intensify the light from the sun/moon.",
