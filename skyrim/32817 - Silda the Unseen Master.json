  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][center]This mod is intended for Skyrim version 1.9.32.0.8 or higher. Older versions of Skyrim might not work with this mod.[/center][/heading]\n<br />The Silda the Unseen Master mod is a straightforward and simple mod that only makes a single change to Skyrim: It changes the pickpocket trainer level of Silda the Unseen in Windhelm from Expert to Master. This change should now allow anyone playing a good-natured character (or any other type of character) to max out the pickpocket skill without having to steal anything and without having to join the Thieves Guild to get access to Vipir the Fleet (who is normally the only Master-level pickpocket trainer in the game).\n<br />[heading]Installation:[/heading]\n<br />Either use a mod manager (such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334]Mod Organizer[/url]), or copy Silda_the_Unseen_Master.esp into the Data subfolder of your Skyrim installation directory and then enable it in the launcher.\n<br />[heading]Uninstallation:[/heading]\n<br />Either remove/disable it in your mod manager, or delete Silda_the_Unseen_Master.esp from the Data subfolder of your Skyrim installation directory.\n<br />[heading]Permissions[/heading]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]You may not upload this mod to other sites without my permission.\n<br />[*]You may not distribute this mod without my permission.\n<br />[*]You may not include this mod, in whole or in part, inside or alongside other mods without my permission.\n<br />[*]You may not release altered versions of this mod without my permission.\n<br />[*]You may not release translated versions of this mod without my permission.\n<br />[*]If I have not noted something here regarding my mod as needing my permission that does [b][u]not[/u][/b] mean you don't need my permission for it.
