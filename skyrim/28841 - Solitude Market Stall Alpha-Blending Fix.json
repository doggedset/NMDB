  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10009928/Skyrim%20Mod%20Images/mod_page_desc.png[/img]\r\nI don\\'t know if anyone else has noticed, but with stock Skyrim at least, the Solitude market stalls are glitching, parts of it overlapping the other areas of the Mesh that should appear in front of it. This can especially be noticed when using an ENB Series plugin, as the stalls become less opaque. This mod deals with that issue. Bethesda seems to have set the transparency settings incorrectly in the Mesh properties which causes the error, this is now fixed. \r\n\r\n[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10009928/Skyrim%20Mod%20Images/mod_page_inst.png[/img]\r\nNo ReadMe is included, as it is just two files that go into your Data folder. Just extract there or use Nexus Mod Manager. (Recommended.)\r\n\r\nFor those who prefer to know, for manuall uninstallation, file path is like this: \r\n\r\nData\\\\meshes\\\\architecture\\\\solitude\\\\clutter\\\\smarketstall01.nif\r\nData\\\\meshes\\\\architecture\\\\solitude\\\\clutter\\\\smarketstalltop.nif\r\n\r\n[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10009928/Skyrim%20Mod%20Images/mod_page_sugg.png[/img]\r\nShould you happen to find more errors like this, just let me know in the comments and I\\'ll see if I can fix it.\r\n\r\nThis bug has also been reported to the Unofficial Skyrim Patch team, so hopefully they will merge the fix with their patch, but for the time being this mod can be used by those who are getting too bugged by the... Bug.\r\n\r\n[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10009928/Skyrim%20Mod%20Images/mod_page_otmo.png[/img]\r\n[url=8236]HD Textures DLC Fix[/url][/center]",
