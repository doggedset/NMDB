  "descriptionHtml": "This mod includes 17 new skill books, 3 new spells, and one mage robe/outfit with jewelry. This pack is the first of three for the Mage skill tree. This mod has leveled list integration. I also plan to add 3 packs for both the warrior and thief skill trees. This mod is in the BETA stages so you may encounter bugs, even though I have tested it extensively, crap happens. The mod should not interfere with other mods, and you only need the Skyrim.esm file. \r<br />\r<br />With the Skill books they change the maximum of 5 to 8 books for magic skills; and from 5 to 6 books for Alchemy and enchanting skills.\r<br />\r<br />The spells include Wielder of Force, Wielder of Beast, and Wielder of Time.\r<br />\r<br />You can but the spells, spell books, and outfit from Farengar.\r<br />\r<br />If you like it, endorse it. Scheduled Release date for Mages Pack II is February 15th 2014\r<br />",
