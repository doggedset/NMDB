  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=peru][size=48][Short Description][/color][/size]\r<br />This is a race that I made for hunters. They are called Gralkin and they are closely related to Bosmer.\r<br />\r<br />[size=48][color=pink][Remember To Endorse&#33;&#33;] [/color][/size]\r<br />[color=deeppink][Please notify me about any errors. Please feedback and endorse if you like the mod.][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=48][color=palegreen][Back Story][/size][/color]\r<br />The Gralkin come from the Forest of Valenwood. They are very closely related to Bosmer. The Gralkin are a mix of Bosmer and an unknown race that is now extinct. The unknown race gave them special abilities like being able to spot predators and see in the dark. The Bosmer genes naturally tried to eliminate the ability to spot predators, but was unsuccessful. That made the lesser power have a down side of taking away health. The Bosmer allowed the Gralkin to be very good hunters of all things. Gralkin normally aren&#39;t assassins, but can make pretty good ones. The Gralkin&#39;s love of the forest creates a high weakness to fire. Gralkins also love to swim.\r<br />\r<br />[size=48][color=orangered][Overview][/size][/color]\r<br />Archery +10\r<br />Light Armor +5\r<br />One-Handed +5\r<br />Smithing +5\r<br />Alchemy +5\r<br />Speech +5\r<br />Greater Power: Gralkin Lung: You can hold your breath underwater for one minute.
