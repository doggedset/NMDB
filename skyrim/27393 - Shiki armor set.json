  "descriptionHtml": "For the moment, just a placeholder for the import of my favorite armor mod from oblivion.  Its A TYPE 2\\'s Shiki armor set. It was originally in two parts, and included some accessories and variants on some pieces i though were unnecessary. If possible it will be condensed into one actual mod and with out some of the unnecessary pieces. Until i find a modder who can help me make it, it won\\'t likely be made for download.  also, according to the permissions, it can still be ported to skyrim (where i think it fits into lore rather well, considering it look like a battlemaiden, and looks kinda royal or noble or whatever.  Again, until some agrees to help me make it for skyrim, it won\\'t be here for download.  That or i get blender and other programs to work on my PC.  All Credit will go to A TYPE2 and a bit to the person who successfully makes it for skyrim with me.\r\n\r\nEDIT: 11-24-2012 8:27 PM PST  I found it on a japanese website, still untested, but it says not to upload to to skyrim nexus specifically.  I give that anime style suspicious eyes.  Nevertheless, this is BIG news.  In the interest of not being busted, just google it and open it in IE, firefox with noscript hates it and me.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I tested it and it works, but it s just a single 3 piece set, and its from the second series.  since it was hard enough to figure out teh site, ill need someone else to help me ask teh modder to make the rest of it available or how she did it.  Still its something and tehres still hope and all that.",
