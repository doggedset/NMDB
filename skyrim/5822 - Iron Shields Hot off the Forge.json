  "descriptionHtml": "If you are looking for some great vanilla shield replacers or just another standalone iron armor then you might check out my other mod based on CaBaL120\\'s aMidianBorn Iron Armor:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21643]StormBorn Iron Armor Standalone and Replacer with Shields[/url]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1162.photobucket.com/albums/q524/exraycatt/mrslave.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nUPDATE 8/6/12: Version 5 added.  This version smooths out some of the ugliness of previous versions and addes new normal maps, some small texture changes, new normal maps, and removes the logo on the inner part of the banded shield.  Also added small viking logo to the front of the banded shield and reduced the size of the stag on the regular iron shield. \r\n\r\nUPDATE 4/29/12:  v 4 is now up.  Iron and Banded Iron Shield replacers, a little more unique this time.  Every last inch/pixel has been retextured, and there are new normal maps for both shields.  Everything is 2k resolution, although the regular iron shield is a little smaller because it is 2kx1k res.\r\n\r\nIf you like the look of the shields, they go best with the armor I made to go with them which you can find here:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5849]\r\n[size=4.0em][font=\\\"castellar\\\"][color=blue][u] IRON ARMOR HOT OFF THE FORGE! [/u][/color][/URL]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][u] IRON SHIELDS HOT OFF THE FORGE! [/u][/color][/size][/font]\r\n\r\n1/17/12: v3 released\r\nupdated textures for both shields\r\nnew custom normal maps for both shields\r\ngot rid of silly star on inside of banded shield\r\n\r\nupdate 1/13/12: v2 released\r\n\r\nv2 has new custom normal maps for both shields and some different metal texture effects on the regular iron shield.  Hopefully some of the plastic look to the banded shield has been removed.\r\n\r\nAll versions are 2k resolution\r\n\r\nI simply retextured these to my own tastes with the idea being this is what the shields looked like before they were left at the bottom of the lake for 600 years\r\n\r\nUse either NMM to download directly or you can pick both or one of the shields from the non NMM version.\r\n\r\nThe .dds file belongs in:\r\n\r\n\\\"Skyrim/data/textures/armor/iron\\\"",
