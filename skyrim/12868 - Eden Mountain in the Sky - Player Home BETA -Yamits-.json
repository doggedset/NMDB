It contains all the crafting facilities you need, along with some people to keep you company! This is my first mod, and it\\'s just a hobby mod for me.  If you have any requests let me know! However I am VERY new with the creation kit so I ain\\'t magic!\r\nPLEASE COMMENT AND ENDORSE IF YOU THINK THE MOD DESERVES IT!! Thankyou :D\r\n\r\n[b][color=#00FFFF]NEWS [/color][/b]\r\n-I promise I haven\\'t forgotten about the mod!  Just had a LOT to deal with recently, blech!  Also I\\'m still trying to work out a pretty important aspect of the mod.  I WILL be back in time!\r\n-Look at the teaser picture and enjoy :D\r\n-I\\'m working on the quest right now, it\\'s going slow but it is going!  In the meantime I\\'ll be putting out smaller updates (mostly visual stuff) to keep things rolling.\r\n(If you\\'re wondering about the notes/upside down map/anything else strange...it all has a plan)\r\n\r\n[b][color=#00FFFF]=VERSION HISTORY=[/color][/b]\r\n[b]Version 0.75[/b]\r\n-Changed the environment outside to a much more lush, woodsy landscape\r\n-Added effects (fog/sunbeams) to some areas of the world\r\n-More behind-the-scenes work and a little bug fixing\r\n[b]Version 0.7[/b]\r\n-Added foliage to the house and stream area\r\n-Set up a lot of the quest structure\r\n-Added a dungeon (not accessible yet)\r\n[b]Version 0.65 [/b]\r\n-Bug Fixes\r\n-Moved 2 walls to make the shack more spacious\r\n-Added more fog/clouds by the waterfall and a guardian dragon\r\n-Hellen now uses all 3 crafting stations by her\r\n-Added a trophy room with functioning mannequins, weapon plaques, cases and racks\r\n-Fixed the Navmesh a bit\r\n[b]Version 0.6[/b]\r\n-Added another house for the NPCs (they don\\'t use it yet but they appreciate it being there)\r\n-Added a tanning rack / area outside the worker\\'s shack\r\n-Fixed navmesh a bit so deer don\\'t try running up mountains, and added salmon in the stream\r\n-Touched up the house a bit\r\n-Added clouds and a patrolling dragon to the mountain!\r\n[b]Version 0.5[/b]\r\n-Added custom house (still heavy WIP)\r\n-Hellen now sells some armor/weapons\r\n-Added some outdoor lighting\r\n[b]Version 0.311[/b]\r\n-Fixed the teleport stones\r\n[b]Version 0.31[/b]\r\n-Fixed the names\r\n-Added/changed some lighting\r\n[b]Version 0.3[/b]\r\n-First Upload\r\n-Look outside the main gates of Whiterun, you can\\'t miss it :P\r\n-This mod contains a fully functional blacksmithing area with a merchant and two friends just chillin\\'\r\n-The house right now is just Black Briar on the inside, it\\'s a place-holder until I finish the real house.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#00FFFF]=FUTURE UPDATES=[/color][/b]\r\n-Adding a quest line that definitely involves a dragon\r\n-Moving the mountain to another, more remote location\r\n\r\n[b][color=#00FFFF]=KNOWN ISSUES=[/color][/b]\r\n-The LOD is...odd. If you fast travel to whiterun you can see Yamits for miles, however if you start from another location far away and walk towards it, the textures might not even generate at all. I know the CK does has LOD issues right now but if anyone knows how to fix this let me know!\r\n-The dragon (perched above the waterfall) seems to sometimes move from his perch and start glitching, no idea why but i\\'ll be working on it! EDIT: This should be fixed, but PLEASE let me know if it happens.\r\n- Let me know if you see any bugs/odd textures/whatever doesn\\'t seem right. Again this is my first mod and it is a hobby mod so I still need to do a lot of work!\r\n",
