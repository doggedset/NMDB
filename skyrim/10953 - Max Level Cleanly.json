  "summary": "Adds each level individually along with each perk in the correct order.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A simple batch file that will level everything seperately and cleanly.  Not much explanation needed but please read.  DO NOT install with NMM because it places mods into the DATA folder.  Place this mod in, Prgram Files(x86) -> Steam -> steamapps -> common -> skyrim.  DO NOT place in the DATA folder as it will not work.  This mod was created by adding all the console commands to add a level as it would normally into one batch file.  To run, open skyrim, load your save and open the console with, ~.  Have a backup save in case.  Type bat maxlevel into the console and let it run.  The leveling may be annoying but it should only do x-100 on alchemy and then you\\'re all set.  Contact me if you have any questions, complaints, rude remarks etc.",
