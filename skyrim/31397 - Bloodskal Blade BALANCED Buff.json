  "summary": "Balanced Buff to the bloodskal blade. Increased speed, lightened carry weight, increased damage, increased crit, and increased Stagger. Balanced to make deadric still do more damage!",
  "descriptionHtml": "Deadric is, the strongest in lore. So I balanced the blade to not do as much damage as deadric, but to still be awesome. It has all of its stats increased. Its faster then deadric, it staggers more then deadric, it crits higher then deadric, but deadric still does more damage.\r\n\r\nDoesn\\'t make it a godsword, but its no longer a joke compared to other weapons.\r\n\r\nObviously requires Dragonborn (Seriously? Sad that I have to mention that)",
