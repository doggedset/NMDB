So I have made a new set of meshes and painted a set of high resolution textures with a far more &#39;silver&#39; cast and moonstone accents.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*THIS IS NOW A STANDALONE ITEM*  You can thank VincentIcarus for that.  Kudos.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Location:\r<br />=========\r<br />\r<br />You will find the items in the smithing, under the &#39;miscellaneous&#39; category.  They are listed now as Ornate Silver weapons, and they are a bit stronger, offset by the requirement of an additional flawless sapphire in order to craft the item.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />=============\r<br />\r<br />Put the DATA folder in your main installation directory of Skyrim so that the folders line up.\r<br />\r<br />Use WryeSmash or Nexus Mod Manager to activate the esp.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />===============\r<br />\r<br />Delete the esp and the folders you put in there.
