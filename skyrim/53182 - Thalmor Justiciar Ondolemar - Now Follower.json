The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC, and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ondolemar]Ondolemar[/url] is a Thalmor Justiciar living in Understone Keep, in Markarth. With this mod enabled, after you complete Ondolemar&#39;s request to locate evidence of Ogmund&#39;s Talos worship, he will be available as a follower. That&#39;s it, really simple. I added him to the marriage factions as well, although I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;ll work, as I&#39;ve been unable to test and I&#39;m not sure if [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36913/?]More Follower Voices Mod Plus Khajiit Marriage[/url] supports marriage for his voice type. But he will follow for sure&#33;\r<br />\r<br />In case you may have killed him or if he&#39;s gone from your game but you want him back (who wouldn&#39;t?), use the console to place an emergency NPC copy I made. Type [i]help Ondolemar[/i] in the console and then use the [i]player.placeatme[/i] command, [u][b]using the ID number that DOES NOT start with 000[/b][/u]. This version of Ondolemar will stay wherever you spawn him and is immediately available as a follower, and thanks to the very talented [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/8337320/?]terzaerian[/url], he will have some extra dialog and the original Ondolemar&#39;s conversation topics. Thank you, terzaerian&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The [i]meshes[/i] and [i]textures[/i] folders I included in the download are only needed if you use the emergency NPC; otherwise you can just ignore them. They have the vanilla face info, so if you&#39;re using some kind of appearance overhaul for Ondolemar, the new NPC will not have the new look. \r<br />\r<br />In both versions, I altered his stats very slightly, raising his level cap to 75 and his confidence to foolhardy. His morality is set to any crime and he is now essential; I also gave him the Light Foot perk so he will not set off traps. All of his other stats have been left untouched. \r<br />\r<br />To make this mod work you [u][b]will need[/b][/u] to install [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36913/?]More Follower Voices Mod Plus Khajiit Marriage[/url] by Mysticentity. I would also recommend installing [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52019/?]Follower Commentary Overhaul[/url] by terzaerian, for a more talkative companion.\r<br />\r<br />As the mod was made with the vanilla Follower system, it should be compatible with any follower mod, such as the ever-popular [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14037/?]Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?]Amazing Follower Tweaks[/url].\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1869302/Skyrim/Banners/Knotwork.png[/img][/center]",
