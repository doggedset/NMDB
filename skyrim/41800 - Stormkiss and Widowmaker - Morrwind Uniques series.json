Anyway, this mod adds two new Nordic battleaxes, Stormkiss and Widowmaker. \r\n\r\nDetails\r\n- Can only be added through console, will eventually change that\r\n- Can be tempered\r\n- DRAGONBORN DLC REQUIRED!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nAlso be on the lookout for my new series that will be coming soon, the Oblivion Uniques series.\r\n\r\nthemusician6",
