  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;m sure not the first mod of this kind for them, but the first you can find. There are hundreds of Lydias, but the Hearthfire NPC&#39;s are seldom touched. So i put my big boy pants on and a cup of coffee (instead hot chocolate) and did it my self. \r<br />This changes the Housecarls, Valdimar and Gregor, from Heartfire to redguard woman like Rayya. Which was touched up a bit, too.\r<br />\r<br />I put some perks into them. Made the mage a taser. Set their max level to 1000 (i use the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1175/?]uncapper[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22800/?]an npc uncapper[/url]). They might become overpowered later on.\r<br />\r<br />If you experience neck gaps and/or colour mismatching you might want to &#34;reset&#34; the sisters with the console command [recycleactor]. Just take everything they carry. The reset deletes items, though follower status stays. If you have them following you, they will directly come back. Therefore it&#39;s recommended to have them follow you AND being indoor (they will just come immediately through the door).\r<br />\r<br />Open console while looking at the npc\r<br />V\r<br />click on the npc\r<br />V\r<br />make sure the right npc is clicked\r<br />V\r<br />write recycleactor.\r<br />\r<br />Requires:\r<br />Skyrim Legendary (all dlc)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?]ApachiiSkyHair by Apachii[/url] (main, female and male&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />Mods in pictures:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65479/?]Remodeled Armor for SeveNBase - 7B BombShell HDT TBBP by RickerHK[/url] (has it&#39;s own body meshes)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51602/?]Fair Skin Complexion by HHaleyy[/url] \r<br />\r<br />(Edit: Corrected the link to the remodeled armor.)",
