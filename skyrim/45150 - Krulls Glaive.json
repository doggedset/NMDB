  "descriptionHtml": "The Glaive an ancient, magical star-shaped five-pointed weapon. \r\n\r\nThis version always has the blades extended out. I am going to see if madrilous will add this to his throwing weapons mod so the people that actually remember the movie the blades retract and the weapon can be guided by thought.  \r\n\r\nYou can craft at any forge in Skyrim. Craftable under the Daedric section. To craft you will need 5 flawless ruby\\'s, 2 silver ingots and 1 gold ingot.This weapon is temperable as well. \r\n\r\nThanks Spidermax96 for making the original model. \r\nNote: (His is a Daedric sword re-placer and my version is a standalone model not a re-placer) \r\nOriginal Mod credit goes to him thanks for maing this for the community\r\nthe krull Glaive by spidermax96 \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31315//? \r\n\r\nEnjoy \r\n\r\nHistory \r\n\r\nKrull is a 1983 British-American heroic fantasy-science fiction film directed by Peter Yates and starring Ken Marshall and Lysette Anthony.
