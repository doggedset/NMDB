  "summary": "Tired of typing in console commands 1 by 1 for armor? Armor file scripts to quickly loadout companions and equip armor sets. Extract to skyrim>data. Example: open console and type bat bladesgear or whichever armor script you want to load.\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is intended to quickly loadout companions, thereby eliminating the hassle of having to type in alot of console commands.\r\n\r\nI\\'m very particular about the look of my gear and my character/companions appearances, so I can\\'t stand not being able to choose my gear. Plus this mod is great for alt faction roleplaying purposes.\r\n\r\nThese scripts will spawn a complete outfit for your character or companion aswell as a shield. \r\n\r\nExtra notes:\r\nI did not alter anyones files or change anything to anyones files at all. These scripts just spawn the gear for you to use on characters or companions eliminating the hassle and time of using console commands.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nI have chosen to upload my progress nightly of the top 10 armor mods both endorsed and downloaded on nexus. So everytime I work on new script files I will upload a new version at the end of the night before I goto bed.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://s7.postimage.org/lqsi3klyj/001.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nZip file contents in v4d\r\n[IMG]http://s3.postimage.org/lykmr0oo3/001a.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://s3.postimage.org/s0wuv92hv/002.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n                          CUSTOM ARMOR SCRIPT NAMES\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nAdded in v4d\r\n[IMG]http://s12.postimage.org/oyp16v2jx/007.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAdded in v4c\r\n[IMG]http://s3.postimage.org/6qrbkt9lv/006.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAdded in v4b\r\n[IMG]http://s4.postimage.org/i1i4khf25/003.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAdded in v4a\r\n[IMG]http://s7.postimage.org/z8cfj5f6z/004.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://s4.postimage.org/ezwe7n88t/005.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nYou can download the latest script files as I upload them. Current version is v4c\r\nv4d\\'s removal tool has been verified to function properly. I included a complete test folder to verify its execution and deletion works 100%.\r\n\r\nv4e is the next version that will feature black sacrament scripts.\r\n\r\nIts strongly recommended you view the readme included with the zip file as each readme to each folder contains different information.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nExtra info:\r\nHow do I run these scripts to get my gear?\r\nCopy all of the scripts you want to use to your main skyrim directory, then simply load the game and type bat \\\"<scriptname>\\\"\r\n\r\nScript sorting:\r\nI put all of the scripts, tools, and plugin files in seperate folders to help the user choose only the scripts they want to use based upon what mods they are wanting to use.\r\n\r\nExample \r\nbat \\\"bladesgear\\\" \r\n\r\nwould give me all of my blades gear to quickly loadout a companion.\r\n\r\nPlease note that scripts require quotes around the name to execute them thru the console. This isn\\'t a typo, its what is required when using scripts.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nUsing custom armors scripts: (No ones load order is the same, so your number will be different to mine or anyonelses. To use custom armors you must follows these two simple steps using notepad++.) It takes less than two minutes to make your custom armors usable.\r\n\r\nIf these images don\\'t appear correctly for you, then see my uploaded images on this mods page or the images included in the zip file.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://s8.postimage.org/4ljzsw8ud/30796_1_1360188521.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://s7.postimage.org/l180k96jv/30796_1_1360188738.jpg[/IMG]",
