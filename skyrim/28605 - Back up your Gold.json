  "descriptionHtml": "The problem I had with other mods that involved changing coins into ingots was that you could craft the gold into jewelry and amp up your smithing level rather easily, while also making more gold than you had to begin with.\r\n\r\nSo when you craft an Ingot with 100 coins, this time it\\'ll craft you a \\'Monetary Gold Ingot\\', which serves to back up your gold, but not let you abuse the amount of ingots you receive.\r\n\r\nIf there are any problems, let me know.
