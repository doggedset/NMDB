Download only one MAIN file. If updating your original MAIN install, download only one of the colour addons and perform overrides in your mod installer.[/color][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Additional boot colours (including red, brown, blue) and the circlet featured (comes in several colours) in the screenshots can be downloaded from my [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72966/?]Paige Cuirass[/url]\r<br />\r<br />This was originally started as an alternative to the Paige Cuirass, but eventually was altered into a Fox Hunter&#39;s clothes. I made the change in honour of my Grandfather who was a fox hunter and bred prize fox hounds. Not that I advocate fox hunting, quite the opposite, but my Grandfather&#39;s fox hunting rituals were laced into his funeral ceremony. An old hunting pal stood atop the hills and sounded off my Grandfather&#39;s bull horn which had always hung ceremoniously in his home. He and his buddies use to always tell us kids stories about how they would sit back and listen for who&#39;s fox hound was leading the pack. My Grandfather had shelves full of trophies to prove he had the best hounds running the hills. So it&#39;s safe to say, it was his hound that was on the fox&#39;s heels. At some point I may add a horn to the look, but one very similar to what my Grandfather carried is included with the Convenient Horses mod (the Nordic horn).\r<br />[center]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]2rBWGGRZC2A[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]g05YtSf9YlA[/youtube][/center]\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ffff00]\r<br />This is not meant to be &#34;lore&#34; friendly. This is my own design based on Medieval fashion of the real world. I will not be making adjustments to make this more lore friendly as it is exactly how I want it to be. Additional colours will be added in the future, but I am NOT taking colour requests. What will be added in the future are colours I already have planned for this piece, and nothing more. A matching hood will be part of the next update.[/color] [color=#ffff00]Update will also include a fix to first person I missed with the original meshes (thumb/hand base clips sleeve slightly during certain animations).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]ABOUT THE MESHES:\r<br />These are high poly meshes. If you have a lower end pc you may experience issues loading inventory or equipping. It was tested on both low end and high end pc, each with a decent amount of mods in use and worked. Depending on your setup and the amount of mods you use you could have issues. A low poly version will not be made available.\r<br />\r<br />Colours in game may vary depending on the use of an ENB. For the screenshots I used the Rudy ENB, but I play normally in Climates of Tamriel&#39;s lighting. It looks different in both. Some ENBs may darken or lighten the look of the textures. Also, as some elements of my textures use cubemaps, some ENBs will affect this as well. You may have textures that will look glassy, washed-out, or plastic looking. This is result of an ENB. It is not a glitch. Consult the mod page (for whichever ENB you use) for tweak solutions, if provided.[/color][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][center][color=#ffff00]Check out my other mods:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/14180385/?tb=mods&pUp=1]ViciousSARR[/url]\r<br />And for updates on future mods and WIPs\r<br />Visit [url=https://www.tumblr.com/blog/vicioussarr]Tumblr\r<br />[/url][/color][/center][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#6d9eeb][size=4]Installation:[/size][/color]\r<br />Manual, NMM or MO\r<br />\r<br />[color=#6d9eeb][size=4]Requirements:[/size][/color]\r<br />None\r<br />\r<br />[color=#6d9eeb][size=4]Credits:[/size][/color]\r<br />The waist belt, Dwarven dagger and white bodice trim beneath corset top are taken from Skyrim assets (property of Bethesda).\r<br />The rest is my own design (meshes and textures)[property of ViciousSARR].\r<br />\r<br />[color=#6d9eeb][size=4]Permissions:[/size][/color]\r<br />May not be uploaded to other sites.
