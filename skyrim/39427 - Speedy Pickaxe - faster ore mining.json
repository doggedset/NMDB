  "modName": "Speedy Pickaxe - faster ore mining",
  "summary": "Increased speed and reach for pickaxes makes for faster mining",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes the following stat changes to all pickaxes (other than the Notched Pickaxe) to 3\r\n* weight: 2 (default 10)\r\n* reach: 1 (default 0.7)\r\n* speed: 3 (default 1.3)\r\n* damage 1\r\n* crit damage 0\r\n\r\n(The damage reduction is to negate the increased attack speed in order to keep the DPS reasonable so they aren\\'t overpowered as weapons.)\r\n\r\nIn order to take advantage of this, [color=#ff0000]attack the ore veins- DON\\'T hit the activate button[/color]. You will be able to deplete most veins in about 3 seconds instead of 20.\r\n\r\nThe default file is SpeedyPickaxeDB.esp and includes the Ancient Nordic pickaxes from Dragonborn. If you don\\'t have Dragonborn, or you don\\'t want to modify those, use SpeedyPickaxe.esp instead. [u]Only activate one file[/u].\r\n\r\nBy the way, if someone would make a little video of this mod in action, I\\'d really appreciate it.",
