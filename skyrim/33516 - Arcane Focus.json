The perk is available when you have achieved 70 points in Alteration and already have the second-tier Mage Armor perk.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly useful for the master-level spells, because casting of lesser spells isn't interrupted by a stagger (although you still stagger). It works on the lesser spells as well, though.\r\n\r\nDon't use this with any mod that modifies perk trees e.g. Skyre, SPERG, whatever. Mod authors can feel free to include this in their mod.",
