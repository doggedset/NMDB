  "summary": "Basic Breezehome Basement , no fancy features, just plenty storage space.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I ve been using this mod myself like forever, and eventually thought there may be others interested in a simple storage cellar for Breezehome. \r\nThere are many Breezehome extentions/modifications already, but most have too many unnecessary features for my personal taste. So, this mod is not for you if you re looking for a fancy Breezehome extention. It s just a simple basement of realistic Breezehome size, with a lot of storage containers. There are no additional crafting stations, as you can find all you need in Whiterun. Also no sorting options, it s up to you to organize your collections any way you want.\r\nThe basement is accessible through a simple trapdoor in the side room.\r\nIt s companion friendly. DLC independent.\r\n\r\nInstallation: just drop the esp in your data folder. \r\nNot compatible with other mods that change Breezehome.\r\n\r\nCredits to Bethesda, for this amazing game and the Creation Kit \r\n",
