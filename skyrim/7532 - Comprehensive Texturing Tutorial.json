  "summary": "A sixty page tutorial designed to teach texturing without focusing on any specific image editor.  Over 100 images and screen shots both in game and out.",
  "descriptionHtml": "  The Comprehensive Texturing Tutorial is my attempt to teach people how to retexture; not how to use gimp or photoshop or Paint.Net to make textures.  This manual is about the process of texture work, not about press ctrl+Z and then blah, blah, blah.  If you are not comfortable with your editor, this is not the first tutorial you need to become a Texturer.  \r\n  That being typed, this tutorial WILL walk you through the process of retexturing the iron dagger.  I hope it will teach you my best practices for file handling, show you some tricks for work flow optimization, and how to do the in-game dance!  I hope it will make you laugh.  I think it will make you a better texturer, even if only a little.\r\n  This tutorial will show you how to take a texture and strip it down for retexturing, then build the texture, the normal map and the _em.  It will show you how to put them in game, and walk you through the process of building a high quality texture.  I will Post some of the images of the dagger through out the process in the images section of this post.",
