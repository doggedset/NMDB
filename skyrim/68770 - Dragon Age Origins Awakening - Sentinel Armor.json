  "descriptionHtml": "[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=499972897]Workshop[/url]\r<br />\r<br />This is a recreation of the Sentinel Armor Set from Dragon Age Origins: Awakening. No dlc required.\r<br />Credit to Bioware for the original design.\r<br />\r<br />The armor will apply to all races, but there are no race specific parts. Khajit, Argonians, and Orcs will see no special treatment for now. The armor is for both males and females.\r<br />\r<br />There are two versions of the armor: Unique (Sentinel [Ebony class]) and Craftable (Heavy Plate [Steel class]). Stats are similar and are either just above or just below Ebony Armor. The unique pieces also have enchantments and, should you wear the full set, you will get an armor bonus.\r<br />\r<br />The unique version can be found outside of Dead Crone Rock, Tamriel -44, -5 to be exact. A video of how to get the armor is under the Videos tab.\r<br />\r<br />To craft, you will need about a dozen the following: Quicksilver ingots, Iron ingots, steel ingots, and leather strips. \r<br />\r<br />To temper, you will need 1-3 of each of the ingots above for each piece of armor. For the Sentinel Armor, you will need a filled black soul gem for the helmet and cuirass. (The glow has to come from somewhere...)\r<br />\r<br />Note:\r<br />-This is not a copy/paste of the original mesh/textures. Everything has been recreated from scratch with the originals used solely as guides. No more, no less.\r<br />-The textures are 2048x2048 and 2048x4096 and the armor has approximately 50k polygons.\r<br />-This armor was designed to work with, well, itself. Mixing pieces with other armors may result in unsightly clipping, seams, and other fashionable oddness.\r<br />-Compatibility warning: To achieve the full set bonus, I had to edit the &#34;Player&#34; object. If any other mods also edit that object, weird things may or may not happen.\r<br />-I am using weapons from my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19263]Dragon Age Weapon Packs[/url] for some of the screenshots.",
