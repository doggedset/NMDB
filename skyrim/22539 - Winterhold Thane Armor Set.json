  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120311165113/elderscrolls/images/thumb/5/5c/WinterholdGuardShield.png/200px-WinterholdGuardShield.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=5][b][color=lightblue]WINTERHOLD THANE ARMOR[/color]\r\n\r\nA Part of the Thane Armor Sets project[/b][/size][/center]\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a personalized light Armor Set as a Gift to the player who becomes Thane of Windhelm. I thought the reward of an oftenly crappy blade wasn\\'t enough + if you\\'re the Thane then you must show it by wearing your favorite hold\\'s colors.\r\n\r\nFirst part of an extended Thane Armor Set mod. It\\'s fully functional even if this is a tryout for a bigger mod.\r\n\r\nSTATS - Light Armor, a little higher than Scaled Armor.\r\nSET: Cuirass, Gauntlets, Crown (as a Helm), Boots and the Thane\\'s Shield - see Pic.\r\nMODELS: from Vanilla until I find a good graphic artist. Uses the Guards cuirass & shield + appropriate vanilla models for the other part.\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBLE Male and Female alike + all body mods. If you use an armor mesh replacer It works, as the parts are from vanilla. Ex: I use the UNP body mod by Dimon99 & the UNP Female Armors by Exeter = that armor will apply the UNP meshes for the \\\"Stormcloak armor\\\", a.k.a. Guards armor. Same w/ ADEC, CBBE etc.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\r\n\r\n1 - First, you must become Thane of WINTERHOLD.\r\n2 - After that, go to [b]Birna\\'s Shop[/b]. The armor parts are almost for free - only 1 septim for the Jarl\\'s taxes!\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n- Temper: better with the Advanced Armors perk.\r\n- Considered as Scaled Armor Material\r\n- The Crown is enchanted appropriately to the Hold\\'s \\\"specialties\\\". Ex: the Winterhold Thane Crown has a magic-related enchantment.\r\n\r\nWIP - I haven\\'t figured out how to direclty give the items as a gift after completing the Jarls quest. If Anybody has a clue, please contact me via PM.\r\nFor now, the sets will be available via the merchants or on a mannequin at the player\\'s houses.\r\n\r\nINSTALL:\r\nExtract the .esp and drop it in your Skyrim/Data folder, or use the NMM.\r\nUninstall: just delete the ThaneArmory.esp file.\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH (main) + FRENCH (Optional) - [i]version francophone![/i]\r\n\r\nWIP - FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\r\n\r\nMake ALL Thane Armors of Skyrim: Markarth, Windhelm, Falkreath, Whiterun, Solitude, Riften etc. All of them will bear the colors of their Hold, all the Thane Crowns will have a specific enchantment, and all the Boots & Gloves will have an appropriate model, different from the Guards. Ex: Windhelm Thane Armor will use the Stormcloak Officer\\'s Boots & Gloves, Imperial for Solitude, Scaled for Whiterun, Thieves for Riften, Leather for Falkreath etc etc.\r\nI know armour collectors will love that ;)\r\n\r\nThat being said, if some artists want to customize the armor meshes & textures, I\\'m opened to any collab on this project.\r\n\r\nKeep informed. I will add the new Thane Armor Set regularly and don\\'t worry the updated .esp will be compatible with the previous one. At the end the mod will be renamed Thane Armor Sets",
