And when you start a new game you simple open the menu\\'s and restore your profile.\r\nI advice you to remove any other mods when you start a new game. So you have a \\\"fresh\\\" save game without losing any progress.\r\n\r\n[heading]Features[/heading]\r\nI always try to make the best mod to create \\\"fresh\\\" save game so you do\r\nnot need to start a new game and lose your progress. For now it got the following features:\r\n\r\n[heading]1. Profile system[/heading]\r\nWith this system you can save your current progress and restore it anytime you want.\r\n\r\n[heading]2. UPM merge system[/heading]\r\nWhen a new version of UPM that saves more of your progress is available, you can then save a new profile with your old save game so the progress that has not been saved yet is saved now. And with that profile you can merge it into your latest save game. UPM will take look what attribute on your profile is newer and apply it if necessary.\r\n\r\n[heading]Some notes[/heading]\r\nI try to contact some other modders to let UPM support their mods. So when you save your profile it will then also save all settings of the mods.\r\nOff course you can select what you like to save when creating a profile. ",
