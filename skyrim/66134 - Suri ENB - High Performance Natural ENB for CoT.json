  "descriptionHtml": "A couple of months ago, a friend of mine was blown away after installing Project ENB because he hadn&#39;t tried any ENB before, so he was basically freaking out (we all went nuts the first time we tried an ENB) . The only problem he had was low framerate (he barely had 15fps)\r<br />\r<br />I told him - &#34;I will make an ENB for you which looks similar to Project ENB but that performs way better&#34;. So what I did was, I took RealLike ENB&#39;s enbseries.ini file and I replaced most of the values with the ones found in Project ENB&#39;s .ini file. \r<br />\r<br />The result was pretty good so I sent him the files, he tried the ENB, and even though it didn&#39;t look as crisp and sharp as Project ENB, his performance went from 15fps to 30-40fps (due to using the old 0.113 binaries used by RealLike ENB)\r<br />\r<br />After tweaking it slightly, we decided that I would release it under the name &#34;Suri ENB&#34; (because his name is Suri)\r<br />\r<br />The default version includes Depth of Field and Anti Aliasing + Anisotropic Filtering, the &#34;More Performance Version&#34; doesn&#39;t have Depth of Field nor Anti-Aliasing\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />MAKE SURE &#34;bFloatPointRenderTarget=&#34; is set to 1  &lt;(bFloatPointRenderTarget=1)&gt; in your Skyrimprefs.ini file (found in Documents/My Games/Skyrim)\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOUND WITHIN THE .RAR FILE\r<br />\r<br />THIS ENB PRESET REQUIRES [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17802/?]CLIMATES OF TAMRIEL[/url]\r<br />\r<br />DOWNLOAD THE ENB BINARIES [url=http://enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0113.htm]HERE[/url]\r<br />\r<br />INSPIRED BY [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20781/?]PROJECT ENB[/url] (by Bronze316) and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22056/?]REALLIKE ENB[/url] (by [b]s3b3k87)[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I WILL ADD MORE DESCRIPTION WHEN I HAVE TIME (I&#39;M STILL LEARNING HOW TO SAVE MY SCHOOL BOOKS AS PDF FILES INSIDE MY MIND SO I DON&#39;T HAVE TO STUDY FOR MY EXAMS)",
