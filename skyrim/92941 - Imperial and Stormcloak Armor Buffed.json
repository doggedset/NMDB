  "summary": "This mod changes stormcloak armor and light imperial armor to be equivalent to leather armor, as well as heavy imperial armor to be equivalent to steel. In addition to this, both stormcloak and imperial armor benefit from the steel smithing, meaning you can improve not only the heavy imperial, but also stormcloak and imperial light 2x as much.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Simple mod, balancing stormcloak and imperial armor to not be worthless and useless, and making them more viable for roleplaying purposes as well as attaching them all to the steel smithing perk.",
