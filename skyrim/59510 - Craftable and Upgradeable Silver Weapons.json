  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve also added a better description seeing as lycans and vampires are also effected by the silver sword. Previous mods of a similar nature often have the description disappear. If this is a bug or a chosen design idea I&#39;m not sure but i&#39;ve left the description in. Construction is the same as steel sword and steel greatsword but silver replaces the steel ingots.",
