  "descriptionHtml": "Introduction:\r\nLove Shouting but hate waiting? Then Infinite Shouts is the mod for you. Infinite Shouts is an older mod I made, back when all I did was make cheats and god-items. My friend was complaining how there were no good shout cooldown reduction mods recently, so I figured I\\'d upload this. The basic feature that this mod adds is a 0 second cooldown for shouts. There was a precursor to this that I made that just reduced the cooldowns of the shouts themselves, but there were some major flaws with that one. Thankfully this mod is so simple that it\\'s completely bug free!\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThis mod is just for fun. So don\\'t complain about it being overpowered, because I know it\\'s overpowered.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nAdds a small dungeon near Falkreath\r\nAdds an Amulet that reduces the cooldown of Shouts by 100% (Take that Amulet of Talos!)\r\n\r\nUpcoming Features:\r\nMost likely not going to be any, it\\'s just for the amulet, and I need to focus on Armor Disguises.\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\nNone!\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\nNone!\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nNexus Mod Manager\r\n1) Click download with NMM\r\n2) Activate the mod once NMM is done downloading\r\n\r\nManual Download\r\n1) Click Manual download\r\n2) Open the file with 7zip, winrar, or something similar\r\n3) Extract the file to your \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data Folder\r\n4) Make sure the .esp is checked before running Skyrim",
