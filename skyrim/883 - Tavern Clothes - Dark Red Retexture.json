I also bleached the hand-towel on her hip and added a small embroidery to it.\r\n\r\nI\\'m aware there are issues with this file as it\\'s the first mod work of any kind I\\'ve done for an elder scroll game, let alone Skyrim. \r\n\r\nextract to *skyrim/data/ and merge with your textures folder, assuming you have one.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how I can improve my work.",
