INFORMATION ON THE MOD           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod changes soul gems to be colored like they were in Morrowind. Instead of\r\nhaving all the soul gems be the same color, they use different colors for ease of recognition\r\nand because they are more interesting to look at that way.\r\n\r\n\t   The colors of the soul gems:\r\n\r\nPetty: Light Blue\r\nLesser: Dark Blue\r\nCommon: Default unchanged Skyrim soul gem. (Pink/Purple/Blue)\r\nGreater: Purple\r\nGrand: Yellow/Orange\r\n\r\nBlack: Default unchanged Skyrim black soul gem. (Black)\r\n\r\n\t   The shapes of the models are the same as original Skyrim models.  The grand soul\r\ngem is shaped like a greater soul gem rather than like a Morrowind grand soul gem, but that is \r\nokay with me, because the greater soul gem had a more impressive shape than the grand soul gem.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod is designed to add additional meshes and textures without overwriting the\r\noriginal ones.  That makes it easy to deactivate and quit using the mod if you wish to.\r\n\r\n\t   Indeed, there are other mods available that change the colors of soul gems.  This \r\nmod just provides you another choice, is easier to install than some soul gem mods, and is \r\nmore traditional and lore-friendly than some of them.\t   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n2. Installation                           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n           Extract (decompress) the .esp, meshes, and textures to your Skyrim directory.  \r\n(It will be something like *Installation directory*\\\\Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data)\r\nMark the box next to the \\\"Morrowind-Colored Soul Gems\\\" plugin in your mod manager.\r\n \r\n           Alternately, extract someplace else.  Then move the .esp to Skyrim\\\\Data.  Mark the \r\nbox next to the plugin in your mod manager.\r\n************************************************************************\r\n3. Version History    \r\n************************************************************************\r\nV 1.0  2/11/12   Initial release.   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n4. Conflicts, Known Issues, and Troubleshooting\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   Other mods already exist to recolor soul gems.  This is just another option for you.\r\nThis mod tries to match closely with Morrowind lore, and it is easier to install than some soul \r\ngem mods.\r\n\r\n\t   The soul gems are very smooth and shiny.  The face that most directly reflects light\r\nfrom a nearby source will be a somewhat different color than the other surfaces.  The soul gems\r\nlook quite different depending on how much light there is.\r\n\r\n\t   The vanilla Skyrim grand soul gem model did not make it into this mod.  A slightly \r\nscaled-up greater soul gem model is used instead.  There were issues with CK errors regarding the\r\ndiffuse map and issues with excessive shininess no matter what textures and what spectral, \r\nemissive, and gloss settings were used.  The current version of NifSkope is still under \r\ndevelopment to be compatible with Skyrim, and it could not deal well with this problem model.   \r\n\t\r\n\t   If you locate a bug, contact David Brasher on TES Nexus so that the situation can be\r\nexamined and can hopefully be fixed. \r\n************************************************************************\r\n5.
