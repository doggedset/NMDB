Now, the exact reasons why it happens are currently unknown: perhaps it has something to do with the sheer number of items that we unload on the merchant or perhaps it has something to do with some very particular items which if are present in a merchant\\'s inventory prevent restocking, who knows? What really matters though is that a solution has been found.\r\n\r\nNo console command seemed to be working (resetinventory, removeitems etc...), the only way to restore the ability of the affected merchants to respawn their whole stock AND gold is to basically buy-out their whole inventory, wait 48 hours and only then their stock and gold would respawn.\r\n\r\nAs an added value, I made something that are probably the tiniest mod in the whole Skyrim universe:\r\n\r\n[color=orange][size=5]Respawning Barrel[/size][/color]\r\nAdds a RESPAWNING chest in Whiterun at Warmaiden\\'s where you could throw all the items you were forced to buy to restore the vendors ability to restock and have the game dispose of it once 10 days are passed and the cell respawns. Which has the added bonus of slimming your savegame size a bit.\r\n\r\n[color=orange][size=5]Faster Merchants Stock Respawn[/size][/color]\r\nLowers the vanilla time required to respawn a merchant\\'s inventory from 48 to 24 hours.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1283.photobucket.com/albums/a553/Mafia2050/M_ChangeLog_zpsf1ef8cda.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n1.0 \r\nInitial release.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1283.photobucket.com/albums/a553/Mafia2050/M_Instructions_zps0495af40.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n- Activate Respawning Barrel.esp\r\n- Load up your game.\r\n- Find a NON-respawning chest (such as in player houses).\r\n- Unload all your gear there (save for quest items).\r\n- Take note of how much gold you have.\r\n- Go to the non-restocking merchant.\r\n- Buy his whole stock.\r\n- Take note of how much gold you have left.\r\n- Grab a calculator and subtract the gold you have left to the gold you had before.\r\n- Fire up the console and type: [i]player.additem f XXX[/i] where XXX is the result you just got from your calculator and you will get your gold back\r\n- Go to Whiterun and enter Warmaiden\\'s\r\n- Drop the content of your inventory in the Respawning Barrel.\r\n- Fast Travel to another city (e.g. Windhelm)\r\n- Wait 11 days; this will reset all the cells but the one you are in AND the Respawning Barrel.\r\n- Go and enjoy your now working again as intended merchants.\r\n- Save the game and exit.\r\n- Now, if you want you can deactivate \\\"Respawning Barrel.esp\\\".\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1283.photobucket.com/albums/a553/Mafia2050/M_Installation_zps65c9502d.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nOpen the file Merchant Stock Respawn Fix.7z and/or Faster Merchant Stock Respawn.7z and extract to your Skyrim folder, or let NMM handle it.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1283.photobucket.com/albums/a553/Mafia2050/M_Notes_zps68e092e4.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[i][color=orange]If you follow the procedure to the letter, the only unwarranted thing you\\'ll get out of it is a small speech boost which depends on how many items you were forced to buy back. If you mind that, you can always use the player.forceAV command to lower your speechcraft to the value it was before the procedure.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=red]If you were affected by this bug please leave a comment, naming the affected merchant(s), I am curious on how common it is and if my mod/solution helped you out, I wouldn\\'t mind an endorsment as well :)[/color][/i]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1283.photobucket.com/albums/a553/Mafia2050/M_Credits_zps5740cbb7.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThe guys in this thread, which helped me figure out how to solve my issue:\r\n[url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1435285-merchants-stock-not-respawning-problem/]Bethesda\\'s Official Forum Thread[/url]\r\n\r\n[i][color=cyan]This mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit.[/color][/i]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1283.photobucket.com/albums/a553/Mafia2050/M_MyOtherMods_zps11728575.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27743]Spell - Brilliance[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28243]Colored Nails[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28431/]Enhanced Lydia[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28457/]Magistrate Eyes[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28588/]Improved Soultrap[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28684]Daedric Letters Warpaints[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29543/]Merchant Stock Respawn Fix[/url]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1283.photobucket.com/albums/a553/Mafia2050/M_Contact_zpsb87a9a46.jpg[/img]\r\n[url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1435448-relz-merchant-stock-not-respawning-fix/]Magistrate on Bethesda\\'s Forum.[/url]\r\nMagistrate on Nexus.[/center]",
