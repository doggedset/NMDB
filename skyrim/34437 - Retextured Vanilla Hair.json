  "descriptionHtml": "I liked all the hair mods on the Nexus, but they only worked on the player character unless you went through and manually changed the NPCs. And doing that would take a while, and I don\\'t feel like doing that.\r\n\r\nI also liked a lot of the vanilla hair styles, since they\\'re actually lore friendly and not just crazy. And I was a sad panda until I came across this guys awesome vanilla remeshes:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28491]Better Vanilla Hairs - Mesh Replacements by kebrus[/url]\r\n\r\nSeriously, go download it and support the work.\r\n\r\nAnyways, he\\'s stated he is going to do the textures later on, but I had some free time and I\\'m a \\\"pen and pencil\\\" artist attempting to get into digital art and I figured it\\'d be good practice, and this will suffice until then I suppose.\r\n\r\nIf I gather enough support, I\\'ll finish what I started and do more of the hairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=6][b][u]UPDATE[/u][/b][/size]\r\nI rolled back the hairlong.dds to an earlier version and played with some of the colors in them some to try and alleviate some of the \\\"wet hair\\\" look.\r\n\r\nAlso, my computer nuked itself. So this took a minute to get out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[b][u]version 0.1b[/u][/b]\r\nv0.1c\r\n-hairlong.dds  <returned to version used in v0.1a\r\n-hairfrizzy.dds\r\n-hairlong_old.dds\r\n-All colors were tweaked slightly to address the \\\"wet\\\" look the hair had\r\n\r\n-hairfrizzy.dds\r\n-hairlong.dds\r\n-hairlong_old.dds\r\n\r\n[b][u]version 0.1a[/u][/b]\r\n-hairfrizzy.dds\r\n-hairlong.dds\r\n",
