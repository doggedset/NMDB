  "summary": "Hi resolution texture of the original (Pre Dawnguard) Vampire Eye texture.\r\n\r\nIt replaces pre Dawnguard eyes and will not effect the Volkihar Vampire eyes. Although you can use it for them if you rename the file eyevampire_02",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a High Rez version of the vampire eye texture created using the Dawnguard vampire eyes. The black pupil has been restored and the iris and cornea tweaked to darken their appearance. The eyes are now a much darker amber due to the increased opacity of the texture, making Vampirism much more subtle. The glow effect itself is untouched but harder to detect, it will be faintly visible only in poor light.\r\n\r\nTo replace Pre-Dawnguard eyes just follow the intallation notes below.\r\n\r\nTo replace the Volkihar eyes instead the file must first be renamed to eyevampire_02\r\n\r\nTo replace both eye types, create a copy of the download file and rename this to eyevampire_02 \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nAdd the file to your Skyrim/data/textures/actors/character/eyes folder. Either overwrite the original texture file or swap it out.\r\n\r\nBeginners will need to first unpack their Texture BSA files, using a BSA unpacker, for this to work.",
