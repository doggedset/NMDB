Thanks to the people in the officials for the support and ideas.\r\nContact me at thepaladinof@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThanks! Have fun with it.\r\n========================================\r\n5)If you\\'re updating from an old version, please delete the old .esp, go ingame, save, exit, then install these files.\r\nOnce you\\'re back in-game, you will no longer have your old spells. If you want them back for free, type this in the console:\r\n\r\nCOC pal_spelltest\r\n\r\nThis will take you to my personal spell testing area. You can find all of the spells I have made or are working on on the\r\nbenches. However, I have set aside a barrel beside the tables filled with all of the current spells so that you can take\r\nyour previous spells back and then resume playing where you left off. Please do not abuse this kindness by stealing the \r\nspells. Just take the ones you had, and buy the rest from my trader. \r\n\r\nThank you, sorry for any troubles.",
