  "descriptionHtml": "after watching the 50th anniversary of doctor who I wanted to play a doctor who style character by playing peacefully unless it was a dragon and quest essential kill or a dwaven constructs (as the doctor kills darleks and cybermen) \r<br />so i created this spell which makes people and creatures \r<br />calm \r<br />flee \r<br />frenzy \r<br />and paralyze \r<br />it also turns the undead. and all for one hour i am thinking of adding a new vesion but without the paralyze effect also if you enjoy the spell there is a clara follower who uses the spell so go and support the mod \r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=204213102&searchtext=\r<br />only problem is you have to cheat the spell in as im not sure on how to add as a spell book or as a starting item but this is my first mod \r<br />enjoy ",
