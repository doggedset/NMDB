  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][color=#d8d8d8][size=3][center]\r<br />This mod changes the stats of every bow and arrow to make them feel more logical, at least in my opinion.\r<br />\r<br />Rather than just increasing the damage of every bow and arrow, I also added some logic. Bows like hunting bow is much faster than normal, also weaker at the same time.\r<br />\r<br />Enemies like Falmers will draw their bows much slower(since they&#39;re blind), but it will also dealÂ significantly more.[/center][/size][/color][/font]",
