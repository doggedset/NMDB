If you do not want the Crown change\r<br />use the older version 2.0 download \r<br />Edit: the latest 3.2 is just to upload a clean (TES5Edit) version, if you have the mod just get the esp only save time\r<br />**************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />If somebody does an Awesome retexture I love to see it, my skills are pretty thin on it\r<br />\r<br />I re-listed this because when I corrected my title spelling mistake the forum did not correct with it, this seems to be a short fall with the setup here, sorry for the hassles this may have caused some souls.\r<br />\r<br />DragonBorn Circlets is my very first attempt at 3D Max and I made some circlets with the dragon masks on them, one for each mask with the standard enchant so one can wear a circlet and get the effect of the mask and you will see a small mask center of the circlet, this resource is mainly for those modders making replacements for masks. But does have a crafting able esp.  to be clear\r<br />this is NOT a replacer, when you deal to that uber Preist you get the mask and you should also\r<br />get the circlet with the same enchant as the mask.\r<br />\r<br />The object here is to give the player a choice, wear a mask and cover the face OR wear a circlet\r<br />and let that pretty face shine\r<br />\r<br />A big thank you to those who feel my effort is worth an endorse, kudos to for your kindness\r<br />\r<br />I have added Beast Race&#39;s and will check I got it right, I&#39;m not totally sure on the correct process to do this and I will make it right\r<br />\r<br />Credit where credit is dew,.\r<br />If these are retextured and used in a mod then credit ALL those who have a part in it\r<br />my permission is only given if the right thing has been done by All\r<br />\r<br />I would like to know if they are used in another mod that I might like to use myself\r<br />\r<br />Honor the Crafter who ever he/she is:\r<br />\r<br />Xathra\r<br />For the Skyre Patch&#39;s for these mods\r<br />\r<br />Yuril for Better Circlets textures, I thank him bless his kind soul\r<br />\r<br />Maeldun0 & WastelandAssassin      for test feedback and help sorting mistakes\r<br />\r<br />Saiodin for his awesome Video coverage\r<br />\r<br />Also a huge thank you to both \r<br />IsharaMeradin    for the script and putting me on the correct path\r<br />T3nd0               for help filling in the process&#39;s I missed and proofing  my work",
