  "summary": "This is my configuration file for the awesome mod Skyrim Community Uncapper! \r\n\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "INSTALLATION: \r\n1. Get Community Uncapper by Elys: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1175\r\n2. Overwrite the SKSE_Elys_Uncapper.ini file (Usually in the Programs\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\SKSE\\\\Plugins directory) with this one\r\n\r\nWHAT DOES THIS CONFIG ACTUALLY DO?\r\n* The leveling curve has been balanced towards levels 1-50 being more important. Your character will spend more time in that level range. After you complete the game by defeating Alduin, you can continue to level up as much as you like at normal speed from level 50 to 100+\r\n* In Vanilla Skyrim, the rewards for each level were the same. Reaching a specific level like level 30 didn\\'t do anything special. But now when you reach specific levels (10,20,30,40,50,etc) you will receive significant bonuses. Now you can look forward to reaching these specific milestones for your character. \r\n* Skill trees take longer to level up. \r\n* Crafting no longer provides any character experience. If you want to become a high level hero, you can\\'t do it while in the safety of town. Get out there and adventure!\r\n* Crafting skills level up 20% faster. This is done purely to cut down on the drudgery of crafting. \r\n* Gain carrying capacity no matter whether you invest in health, magic, or stamina. Caster characters are no longer forced to invest in stamina just so they can carry a decent amount. \r\n\r\nMods I highly recommend to use in tandem with this uncapper config: \r\nSkyrim Redone by T3nd0: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286\r\nDeadly Dragons by 3JIou: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3829",
