  "descriptionHtml": "This mod I\\'v had in my mind for a looooooong time, just got around making it. The truth is I found a glitch to have a infinite bound sword but you loose it if you switch weapons. This mod adds a bound weapon to your inventory when you use a bound spell. Sheath the sword after summoning it then look in your inventory for Bound Sword and equip. This affects all default bound spells. There is a chest near whiterun (see video for a view of the location) that has a sword named retribution in it. This weapons model is the normal non translucent model with the glowing affects and is more powerful.\r\n\r\nWATCH THE VIDEO to see how it works :)",
