  "descriptionHtml": "There are many mods out there adding a player house to the village of Riverwood, but I have never liked any of them.\r\n\r\nThis mod makes a house that looks like it truly belongs in this lovely riverside town.\r\n\r\nThe mod does make some changes to the Town itself such as adding a stables, moving and improving the guard camp, and extending and in some case moving the exterior walls.\r\n\r\nRiverside also features a player house which includes all what the Dovahkiin needs to call it home. The house provides a small garden and lovely deck on the outside; the interior holds a small library, kitchen, proper amount of storage and of course a bed to rest after a long day of adventuring.\r\n\r\nFor now there is no script for you to have your wife in the house, but there is a mod just for that.\r\n(http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11370)\r\n\r\n***For the less observant the house does include a cellar that holds a wide variety of \\\"things\\\" for the player to enjoy.\r\n\r\nPlease subscribe and feel free to favorite and rate as well, Enjoy!\r\n(***THIS IS A MOD, IF YOU\\'RE LOOKING FOR THE SONG LET ME DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION \r\nHERE: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWsTUhGB710)\r\n\r\nUPDATES:\r\n\r\n1.1-Toned down the amount of light inside the house and removed some shadowing FX effects.\r\n\r\n1.2-Added Navmesh to the interior of house and changed exterior to match with new surroundings.
