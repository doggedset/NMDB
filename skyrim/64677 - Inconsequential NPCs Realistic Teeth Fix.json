There&#39;s no new assets, only those modified by realistic teeth patcher.\r<br />\r<br />I have extracted Facegeom data from Inconsequential NPCs with BSA Extractor, ran them through Realistic Teeth Face Converter Tool, and packed the resulting file as 7z. I haven&#39;t noticed any issues, feel free to bring up anything I may have missed so I can correct it if necessary.",
