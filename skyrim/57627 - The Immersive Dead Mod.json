  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Courier New][b][size=6]THE IMMERSIVE DEAD MOD[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/font]\r<br />This mod aims to add quite a bit of immersion to the world of Skyrim, through the Stormcloak camps, and the Imperial camps. \r<br />\r<br />[size=4]A war is raging on, people are being killed, enemies striking at any given moment. This mod shows the aftermath of raids and attacks, with bodies strung about, their weapons left behind, the dead being honored through coffins. \r<br />[/size]\r<br />Throughout Tamriel, people die all the time, and not always by your hand. This mod also creates death stories that are predetermined, or you can decide for yourself how they perished. This includes humans and animals alike. \r<br />\r<br />I took the time to hand-craft  [size=3]MOST [/size]of the NPCs (which means I picked out the hair, color, etc).\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />I will add more deaths/circumstances if this mod gains decent popularity. \r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4]If you&#39;re looking for a scavenger hunt and are into competition, hear this&#33;\r<br />Whoever is first to find the NPC labeled as &#39;DEAD SPY&#39; will win the opportunity to suggest the next mod I create&#33;[/size]\r<br />[/center]",
