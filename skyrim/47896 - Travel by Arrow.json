  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#9999cc][size=6]- Travel by Arrow -[/size][/color]\r<br />[img=150x]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/images/110/5594926-1385284649.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff2222][size=4]Important Note&#33;[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=2][color=#ffcccc]This mod heavily taxes the game in the amount of cell loads it creates in a short time. This means that CTD&#39;s can occur if your game or save is unstable, please read the note on CTD&#39;s further down on the page. This is also the reason I&#39;ve listed ENBoost or ENB as a REQUIREMENT to make the mod function properly. Don&#39;t be scared to try it out though, there is a less taxing version available if you are having issues.[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][size=4]Background[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=2][color=#ffffff]I initially wanted to make a mod that tracked an arrow you were shooting, just to see where it landed and how far off my target it was. I had some problems making it work smoothly and decided to abandon the idea. However after the optimizations and stability enhancements that came with ENB by Boris Vorontsov, it seemed to work much better. I found myself using the spell in my normal playthrough as a way to get around. So I decided to make this mod out of it.[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][size=4]Description[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]The mod adds a master conjuration spell called &#34;Conjure Soulbound Arrow&#34; to the world. It is equipped as a power and conjures a special arrow when cast. If you shoot this arrow with a bow, you will follow it until it reaches its destination and then teleport you there. Note: You will need 100 mana to cast the spell, even in god mode and game time multiplier is cut in half during flight to alleviate some of the stress on the Skyrim engine.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][size=4]Location/Acquisition[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]The spell tome is located on the mountain north of riften, under a skeleton. It is hard to get there but possible. Check the image section for accurate map location. Dont like climbing? Use console -help &#34;Spell Tome: Conjure Soulbound Arrow&#34; to find the tome id[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][size=4]Videos[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2][youtube]FDSEZeC76mE[/youtube][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][size=4]Game Balance[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Considering that you can get to places that you shouldn&#39;t be with this mod, it might break certain things (please use responsibly) or be considered imbalanced. I will probably make a version with increased mana cost later to make it less viable in combat. [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][size=4]Lore/Story[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]I had a story planned to put it in the game in a &#34;lore-friendly&#34; way, but I am limited in skill when it comes to storytelling and making quests. I also tend to obsess when it comes to details, so this would probably take a lot of time for me. The story was supposed to be something along the lines of a book detailing the myth of a wild elf who came to Skyrim long ago on a research quest into the mysteries of conjuration magic. He get&#39;s tricked by some Daedric prince who promises him the power of flight, and ends up stranded on the top of a mountain where he freezes to death. I planned a simple quest for the player where he traces down the origin of this myth. If anyone with more quest making experience feels charitable and wants to help make this please pm me.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff2222][size=4]Issues/CTD[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Needless to say there is a multitude of reasons why your game can CTD. And because the mod loads a lot of cells in a short span of time, it is likely to exacerbate these issues. Not to mention there probably might be legit reasons to why the mod itself will cause a CTD. This means it will be impossible for me to separate issues that might be mod related from issues related to an unstable game or save; I will unfortunate not be providing any support. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time trying to make it as stable as I can and I feel I&#39;ve come to a point where there is nothing more to be done. The source code is available as a separate download if anyone feel they can improve upon it. If you are having issues with the mod and desperately want to fix them. Take a look further down for some bullet points on game stability.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][size=4]Requirements[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38649/]ENBoost[/url] or [url=http://www.enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.htm]ENB[/url] with appropriate memory optimization and stability settings for your system, plus a stable game and save.
