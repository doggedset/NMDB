  "descriptionHtml": "[url=http://imgur.com/a/97z3D#0]All screenshots[/url]\r<br />\r<br />4 weather settings (Clear, Cloudy, Overcast cloudy, Overcast rain) for use with new worldspaces or as a part of other mods that use with lighting/weather effects.\r<br />\r<br />This is somewhat based on my mod Realistic Lighting Without Post-processing, but with a lot of changes. Each weather setting is non-replacing, and vanilla weather is untouched. I think the colors are more realistic than any previous attempts/other mods as well.\r<br />\r<br />Form IDs for testing are:\r<br />02007401 - Clear\r<br />02007402 - Cloudy\r<br />02007403 - Overcast Rain\r<br />02007404 - Overcast Cloudy\r<br />\r<br />You may use, modify, distribute this mod anywhere without permission or credits.",
