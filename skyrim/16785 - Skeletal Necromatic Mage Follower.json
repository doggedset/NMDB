  "summary": "Adds Lord Shadowscythe, a deadly shade necromancer, to High Hrothgar.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A powerful necromancer failed in the most crucial part of the transformation into a lich, and so his soul was forever doomed to a skeletal shade. The greybeards took him in, as he was shunned everywhere. He knows many spells and might surprise you.\r\n\r\nHe is found in High Hrothgar.\r\n\r\nThis mod is compatable with follower tweaks mods as far as I can tell, as i use several myself. This is my first mod and I thank you all for the support. Any bug reports would help me greatly. \r\nFuture plans: Might add a quest and some unique dialogue.\r\n\r\nWorkshop link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=68406255",
