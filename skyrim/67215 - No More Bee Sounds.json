  "descriptionHtml": "Update 6/24/15: I have a new mod called [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67214/?]No More Bug in Jar Sounds[/url] which removes the buzzing noises that the bugs in jars make. I have come to understand that a lot of people who downloaded this mod did so not only out of annoyance, but out of a real dislike of bugs and bees. That said, I hope this is another modification that will help some of you breathe easier while playing.\r<br />\r<br />tl;dr This mod disables the default noise that bees make. Does not include &#34;Bee in a Jar&#34;. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67214/?]But this does.[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Lydia, Valdimar, and I hadn&#39;t slept for days after building the greenhouse. The constant buzzing of the bees that would fly around Lakeview Manor drove us to the point of insanity. Even the Dragonborn needs to sleep, so I opened up the creation kit and removed the appropriate bee noises.\r<br />\r<br />While I made this mod for Hearthfire, it doesn&#39;t require Hearthfire. The down side to this mod is that it does remove bee noises entirely, so it may break immersion a little for some. For others who simply want to have a nice garden for alchemy without the constant, mind-shattering, droning noise, this should be a lifesaver. I know it was for me.\r<br />\r<br />Thank you, and enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />Note: I&#39;m the original author of this mod, but I&#39;ve switched to this account and reuploaded because there is no way to change usernames in Nexus.",
