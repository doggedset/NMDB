  "descriptionHtml": "WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?\r\n\r\nThis mod in an overhaul for many of the animals, creatures , undead and other such monstrosities in the game. This mod rebalances them, and in some cases changes their A.I. The starting level of some of the really hard creatures is a bit less, like trolls, but the level cap on everything has been increased, some by a bit, and some, like spriggans, massively. \r\n\r\nThis was done as most things in the vanilla game are stuck at one level, such as a Draugr who is always stuck at level 1, and a restless Draugr at level 7 for example. This mod changes this so things keep leveling and are more lore friendly as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod works perfectly with my better factions mod, which can be found in my workshop, but this mod does not require it.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPLEASE NOTE THE SCREENSHOTS ARE JUST FOR DECORATION, AND ARE FROM TESTING. THIS MOD DOES NOT ALTER SPAWN RATES.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTHE LIST OF CHANGES\r\n\r\nANIMALS: \r\n\r\nBEARS: Now level with the player. They start at level 6 and end at 24. Other variants of bear such as snow and cave bears can go up to level 26. They also give you more of a warning if you want to avoid a fight.\r\n\r\nWOLVES: Now level with the player, between levels 2 and stop at 12. They give you more of a warning now, so it is more difficult to provoke them by accident.\r\n\r\nSABERCATS: Start at lvl 4, and go up to 17. The snowy sabercat\\'s go up to lvl 24\r\n\r\nFROSTBITE SPIDERS: Now level with the player from levels 2-12. The bigger varieties are a bit more varied, but can go up to lvl 32\r\n\r\nCREATURES:\r\n\r\nTROLLS: Trolls now start at lvl 7, and end at 30. Frost trolls can level up to lvl 35\r\n\r\nSPRIGGAN: Spriggans now lvl from lvl\\'s 8 all the way to 32, Matron\\'s go up to lvl 37.\r\n\r\nUNDEAD:\r\n\r\nDRAUGR: basic Draugr level up to lvl 10 now, restless go up to 17 and wights up to 24.\r\n\r\nSKELETONS: Skeletons now go up to lvl 20 (like their oblivion buddies)\r\n\r\nDREMORA:\r\n\r\nDREMORA: now level with the player, starting at lvl 7 and go up to 45. The highest end Dremora spawns are replaced with a Dremora warlord, who is lvl 50 and has daedric weaponry.\r\n\r\nNEW DREMORA ITEM: Dremora now have their own weapons, with steel stats but with the appearance of deadric weaponry.\r\n\r\nDWEMER AND FALMER FORCES:\r\n\r\nFALMER: All Falmer level with you now to lvl 35. They start at lvl 5. Each variety of them has a different perks though\r\n1.\tFalmer: No perks\r\n2.\tFalmer Skulker: 20% boost to 1 handed damage\r\n3.\tFamler Gloomlurker: 20% Boost to 1 handed damage, 20% for light armour.\r\n4.\tFalmer Nightprowler: 40% Boost for 1 handed damage, 20% boost for light armour.\r\n5.\tFalmer shadowmaster: 40% boost for 1 handed, 40% boost for light armour.\r\nThe \\\"boss\\\" ones in each dungeon also have modest boosts to health and stamina.\r\n\r\nDWEMER AUTOMATONS\r\n\r\nDWEMER SPIDERS: Now lvl between 2-10\r\n\r\nDWEMER SPHERES: These guys start at lvl 7 and lvl up to 24\r\n\r\nDWEMER CENTURIONS: Now lvl from 24-50.
