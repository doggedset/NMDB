  "modName": "Roleplaying and Harder Start - Skills to Level 1",
  "summary": "Makes the start of the game harder by a simple bat file changing your skills to 1 at the start of the game.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Basically it really annoyed me how you start off with each skill at about 15 (or whatever).\r\nI\\'m into proper roleplaying so most my characters start off new to everything - you might want to set certain skills higher because that\\'s their background e.g. blacksmith\r\n\r\nThis is a simple bat file that sets all of your skills to 1.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gameplay Effects ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nNOTE - This affects the game in a few ways:\r\n   Your level cap will be increased to 82 yaaaay!\r\n   It will make the start of the game harder - since your skills are lower and you overall level higher enemies are more tough at the start - at later levels it makes barely any difference (which is good when it gets hard anyway)\r\n   You will level up faster at the start\r\n   Perks don\\'t always work when you have a skill level of 1 e.g. the steel smithing perk is available straight away but when you attempt to make stuf better \\\"You don\\'t have the sufficient skill\\\". This fixes when you get to the right skill level (which doesn\\'t take long)\r\n   You get a fair amount of perks straight away but can\\'t use them. It basically means you can unlock most perks when you get them\r\nNOTE - It makes you realise how useless some skills are and how little you use them\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Suggestions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nSome of the things I do (depending on how I\\'m roleplaying it):\r\nGive the player some gold to start off with (console command \\\"player.additem F Amount\\\") - maybe they come from a rich background, pulled off a heist ect.\r\nSet the player\\'s speed higher (console command \\\"player.setav speedmult Amount\\\") - default is 100, 115 is a nice speed - maybe they are a speedy character who darts in and out of combat\r\nSet Health/Magicka/Stamina to a higher starting value (console command \\\"player.setav Health Amount\\\") - Maybe they are just a hardy character or have a lot of willpower etc. NOTE - Setting stamina to a higher value does not increase carry weight\r\nI often use Tytanis\\' Perk Points Trainer to give myself two perk points per level (one you get plus one I add). At the start of the game you get ridiculous amounts of points but as you progress its much nicer when you can fill out a lot more trees.\r\nNOTE - When using these console commands change \\\"Amount\\\" to the value you want it to be or amount you want added\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nPlace the .txt file in your Skyrim/Data folder as usual. Usually located at   C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data   through steam\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Use in Game ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nPress the console key: ~ for most or Â¬ if you\\'re on a UK keyboard like me :) and type \\\"bat SkillToOne\\\" without the quotation marks.\r\nNOTE - only use after you first gain control of your character after Alduin attacks Helgen otherwise it will reset your skills",
