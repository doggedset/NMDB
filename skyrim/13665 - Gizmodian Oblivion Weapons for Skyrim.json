GIVE HIM ZEE LOVE&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16244\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />============\r<br />\r<br />These are random resources originally made for Oblivion.  Some have been ported backward for Morrowind, and these are now ported forward and available for use in Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />While this is a resource, I made a simple esp for those wanting to play with the items.  They are found in the Drunken Huntsman at Whiterun, directly to the left of the entrance on the seller counter in a small yellow urn near a pair of boots.  There is a Vicious Heart dagger sitting in front of it, so it&#39;s hard to miss.\r<br />\r<br />The items are player owned.  There are only two of some items, which are logically dual-wieldable.  If you want a second weapon [to dual wield] for items that have only a single, open the console with [~], type help &#34;[WEAPON-NAME]&#34; 0, and use PgUp and PgDn to scroll through the console items.\r<br />\r<br />Then type player.additem [CODE] 1\r<br />\r<br />Addendum: The images only show a *some* of the items, there are others.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />=============\r<br />\r<br />Drag and drop so the Data folder lines up with your installation folder, tick the esp in the program of your choice, and play.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />===============\r<br />\r<br />Delete the Gizmodian&#92;ObliviWeapon&#92; folders.\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />========\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda for making Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Programs Used:\r<br />==============\r<br />Autodesk 3DSmax9\r<br />Nifskope\r<br />Adobe Photoshop\r<br />Creation Kit [which ate my esp AND my backup esp and made me start over]\r<br />Several tufts of hair that I ripped out of my head in sheer frustration since nothing ever cooperates.  Ever.\r<br />\r<br />EVER.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Usage and Permissions:\r<br />======================\r<br />\r<br />This is open source, you cannot prevent somebody else from using these materials if you use them in your own mod.\r<br />\r<br />Credit is required.\r<br />\r<br />I rather like to be notified if you plan on using my stuff.  It&#39;s fun to see what other people are doing.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][i][u]ADDENDUM: NO MONETARY VALUE CAN BE GAINED FROM ANY ASSETS THAT I HAVE CREATED AND HAVE BEEN USED. THIS IS \r<br />OPEN SOURCE. FOR FREE. FOREVER.[/u][/i][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Additional Notes:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />If I get a question that&#39;s already been answered in the readme, I reserve the right to punch you through the internet.
