  "descriptionHtml": "Silverlight Armor clothing version ESP only\r\nReleased on 31th of March 2012\r\nOriginal mod by Jojjo and Frozzled\r\nEsp modified by masiyuan1989 with permission from one of the original mod authors Jojjo\r\n\r\nChange log\r\n\r\nv1.1 released 1th of April\r\nAdded non-enchanted version of rob (body slot)\r\nNow craft able in forge, enchanted version require gems as material\r\nScreen shot added\r\n\r\nv1.0 released 31th of March\r\nInitial release\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nSilverlight armor is perhaps the most amazing armor design I have ever seen in the nexus. However, it has been a pity that as a big fan of pure mage play style, I take penalties using silverlight armor due to its light armor nature. (wasting exp on light armor skills, unable to benefit from alteration perks)\r\n\r\nSo I made some modification to the original esp file, adding clothing version of silverlight set to fit mage characters\\' need. There are 4 pieces in total, with the main armor enchanted with archmage rob enchantment. (100% increased magica regen, 15% magica cost reduction for all magic schools)\r\n\r\nRequirement\r\n\r\nWarglaives and Silverlight Armor 099 CBBE, by jojjo and Frozzled\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10251\r\n\r\nHow to get it\r\n\r\nUse in game conceal and type in:\r\nhelp silverlight 4\r\nThen it will show a list of all silverlight armor and my modified clothing version, each with an item ID such as, xx000d62 where the xx is your load order of the esp.\r\nThen  type in the following command for which ever piece you need:\r\nplayer.additem (item ID) 1\r\nAnd the piece will be added into your inventory.\r\nNew in v1.1: you can now craft the clothing versions using forge, arcane blacksmithing perk is required.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n\r\nDownload using NMM then activate. NOTE, activate it after you install the original mod, press \\\"yes to all\\\" to over write the original .esp file.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n\r\nSimply deactivate the mod in NMM\r\n\r\nCredit\r\n\r\nThanks Bethesda for creating Skyrim\r\nThanks Jojjo and Frozzled for creating the asome silverlight armor\r\n\r\nLicence\r\n\r\nYou can not make any modification of any part of this mod without the permission from Jojjo - the author of silverlight armor.",
