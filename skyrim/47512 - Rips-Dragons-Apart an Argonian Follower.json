  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds an Argonian follower called 'Rips-Dragons-Apart' to the Hall Of The Dead catacombs in Whiterun.\r\nHe is lvl 80, though I have edited him to make him not overpowered he is designed to be a good follower for anyone of Level 10 or Higher, he uses two Akaviri katanas, the Fus Ro Dah dragon shout (He will often us this at the start of combat) and he can use a healing spell to heal himself.\r\n\r\nThe current version is 1.0 and I do intend to completely redo him at quite a later date but in the meantime I would appreciate it if you gave feedback and ideas in the comments area.\r\n\r\nRecommended Files:\r\nAny HD Argonian Skin Replacer\r\nCaBal's HD Retextures\r\nUFO (Ultimate Follower Overhaul) or any other follower overhaul mod of that sort.\r\n\r\nNotes: Does require Dawnguard and Dragonborn for version 1.0 this will soon be changed.",
