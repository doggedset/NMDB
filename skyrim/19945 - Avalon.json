  "descriptionHtml": "This is still a WIP , its 70 % completed and the reason for uploading it is only for feedback and critisism , changes i should make etc . The tower itself has a travel marker and has interior also , the interior is completed . It provides all crafting facilities and a lot of storage . The tower itself is not conpanion friendly i dont know how to do that for now sorry . It has 3 levels ( rooms ) with everything you would possibly need . It also has an exterior pool . So thats it for now i will be updating - making changes once there are more modder resources available . Let me know what you think . Its location is near Half Moon Mill inside the lake . See pics . Please people rate this mod and write down your thoughts in the comments its very important . I higlhy recommend using with this mod retexturing mods ( there are plenty ) found here on Nexus such as Sexy Villages And Towns , Painting And Frames and Sexy Mannequin Replacer mods , search a bit on the site . They enhance the experience a lot . Also i want to thank Reaper9111 and Dj20 for their support and ideas . Thank you ",
