Read before you judge.\r<br />\r<br />And before you ask, yes you can actually be instakilled without using a Cheat/exploit, as Hallodria already said in the comments.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]New: added a file you can download that completely removes the refelect blows perk of the ebony warrior, for those still having a bug or just dont want him having the perk at all, if you dont like it.[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][u][size=4]For People who say this isnt a bug (i know what you mean):[/size][/u][/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />If you Fight the Ebony Warrior, there is a chance that you will be killed instant of your own attack because of his &#34;Reflect Blows&#34; Perk, especially when using &#34;Marked for Death&#34; shout.\r<br />\r<br />Thats fine to me, i mean he is supposed to be a real challenge and everything, but....\r<br />\r<br />in my Game this Perk of his was Bugged and i got killed even when i was on full health (400 HP) \r<br />and attacked him with an Iron dagger that did 10 Damage and was not enchanted \r<br />and when i used the &#34;Marked for Death&#34; shout,i got killed on every first hit.\r<br />\r<br />Many people seemed to have that kind of bug or similar, so i decided to make a Fix.\r<br />\r<br />I encounted no Problems with this mod and everything worked fine,\r<br />but if this doesnt fix it for you, send me a message, maybe i can help.\r<br />\r<br />&#33; ATTENTION &#33;\r<br />\r<br />the Perk is NOT disabled and the Ebony Warrior is NOT weakend, you can still be killed by this Perk, \r<br />if you have to low health, but now it should work fine, \r<br />that means it should be a real 10% chance and not a 90%-100% chance.",
