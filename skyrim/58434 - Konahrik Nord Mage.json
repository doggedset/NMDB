  "summary": "Based off of the final Dragon Priest Mask, Konahrik is a Nord Spell sword skilled in destruction and one handed, as well as restoration and conjuration.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A mod adding a new follower to the game, a Nord Mage named Konahrik found in the Banned Mare in Whiterun. He comes equipped with Master Destruction Robes, an Ebony Sword, and a Staff of Firebolts. He also has the ability to shout using Fus Ro Dah and Yol Toor Shul, and is under the combat style of a spellsword. He has skill in Light and Heavy armor, so he will wear pretty much anything you give him. I may add onto this mod at a later date, but for now it&#39;s just a bare bones thing I made while playing around with the creation kit on my Craptop. He&#39;s a bit overpowered at lower levels, so be careful with that.",
