  "descriptionHtml": "There are a few mods that make the Abandoned House in Markarth a functioning living space, but I was never really satisfied with how they changed the layout of the house; they just weren\\\\\\'t for me.\r\n\r\nIn this mod I added a small handful of things to make it a fully functional home for the player, but without drastically changing it and possibly causing conflicts with the House of Horrors quest. The house should stay just as is for those who like living in dark, dreary abodes.\r\n\r\nWhat this mod adds:\r\n\r\n-A cooking pot over the fireplace in the first room.\r\n-Three weapon racks\r\n-Enchanting Table\r\n-Alchemy Lab\r\n-Tanning Rack\r\n-Workbench\r\n-Grindstone\r\n-Two keys, one for the basement door and one for the house itself.\r\n\r\nThe chests and barrels have also been marked to NOT respawn, so you should be able to safely store your gear and items in them. Some of the sacks I didn\\'t edit, however. Some of them respawn and some of them don\\'t, but I wouldn\\'t risk storing anything in them.\r\n\r\nIf there are any issues let me know. If there\\\\\\'s anything I might have forgotten or you would like to see possibly added into the house, let me know. If I get enough requests for it I\\\\\\'ll consider adding it into the mod, as long as it doesn\\\\\\'t change the house too much; that\\\\\\'s the only reason I haven\\\\\\'t added a forge. It\\\\\\'s too big and just wouldn\\\\\\'t look right in the cramped space, in my opinion.",
