Being a rather extreme perfectionist, this was the only way for me to both enjoy and rationalize using steel/etc. weapons more than Daedric weapons. Anyway, as my editing got more and more extensive, I realized I practicly had a weapons overhaul on my hands..\r\n\r\nSo, I decided to remake my edits into a more logical and *hopefully* mod-worthy endeavor. This mod is the result of my tinkering with the various weapon attributes I found in the CK. Over a period of several hours, I meticulously altered the stats of the Iron, Falmer, Executioner, Draugr, Imperial, Nightingale, Steel, Skyforge Steel, Silver, Orcish, Dwarven, Elven, Glass, Ebony, Daedric, Nord Hero, Bound(summonable), and Daedric Artifact weapons and arrows in a few completely modular flavors: Immersive (Coming soon-ish) and Unrealistic. I have yet to start on the Immersive weapon stats, as I want input from the community before I decide on what \\\"Immersive\\\" would be and add it to my mod. I encourage you to leave suggestions in the comments section or via PM.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFD200][size=3][b][u]Features (Unrealistic):[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r\n[color=#95E500][list][*]Faster weapon speeds\r\n[*]Stronger base weapon damage (All weapons do the same damage)\r\n[*]Stronger base arrow damage (All arrows do the same damage)\r\n[*]Lighter weapons\r\n[*]Arrows have increased impact force (dead bodies, etc. will fly pretty far if you shoot them)\r\n[*]Arrows have increased speed\r\n[*]Arrows have increased range\r\n[*]Arrows have no gravity\r\n[*]Arrows have a collision radius of 0.00 instead of 0.50, this means arrows will hit targets *more* precisely, but will still be subjected to the dimensions of the target\\'s hit box.\r\n[*]Daedric Artifacts\\' have increased speed, damage, and enchantments\r\n[/list][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#CCFF00\\\"][b]Due to the lack of arrow gravity and increased arrow range, I recommend you Copy/Paste the following lines to your Skyrim.ini file (You can place it right after the [General] Section, though I don\\'t think it matters where it\\'s placed exactly):[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#FFFACD\\\"][Actor] \r\nfVisibleNavmeshMoveDist=12288.0000\r\n[Combat] \r\nfMagnetismStrafeHeadingMult=0.0 \r\nfMagnetismLookingMult=0.0 \r\nf1PArrowTiltUpAngle=0.7 \r\nf3PArrowTiltUpAngle=0.7 \r\n[/color]\r\n[color=\\\"#CCFF00\\\"][b]These additions center your aim to the middle of the reticule to account for the lack of gravity, help to remove Skyrim\\'s aiming assist feature, and increases the range at which you can see projectiles.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFD200][size=3][b][u]Features (Immersive):[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r\n[color=#95E500][list][*]Coming soon-ish\r\n[/list][/color]\r\n[img]http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/1944/detailsw.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#CCFF00\\\"][b]These are the changes I made to all* of Skyrim\\'s unenchanted Vanilla weapons in the Creation Kit. I tried to list an accurate generic default value for each attribute so you could have some sort of reference to the changes I made. Also, you will notice that I have included things like \\\"(Fast), (Fastest), and (Fast & Fastest),\\\" these mean that the preceeding values affect the Fast and/or Fastest folders.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFD200][size=3][b][u]Immersive Stats[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#95E500][b]Bows, Maces, Swords, War Axes[/b]\r\n\r\n[list][*]Base Damage: Default= ~12, Altered= ???\r\n[*]Speed: Default= ~0.85, Altered= ???\r\n[*]Weight: Default= ~12, Altered= ???\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Arrows[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[list][*]Base Damage: Default= ~17, Altered= ???\r\n[*]Impact Force(Affects Arrows): Default= 1.0, Altered= ???\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Greatswords, Battleaxes, Warhammers[/b]\r\n\r\n[list][*]Base Damage: Default= ~21, Altered= ???\r\n[*]Speed: Default= ~0.65, Altered= ???\r\n[*]Weight: Default= ~23, Altered= ???\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Daggers[/b]\r\n\r\n[list][*]Base Damage: Default= ~8, Altered= ???\r\n[*]Speed: Default= ~1.3, Altered= ???\r\n[*]Weight: Default= ~3, Altered= ???\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nComing soon-ish...[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#CCFF00\\\"][b]Note: Immersive weapon stats will be individual, not homogenized like the Unrealistic stats.[/b][/color]\r\n---\r\n[color=#FFD200][size=3][b][u]Unrealistic Stats[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#95E500][b]Bows, Maces, Swords, War Axes[/b]\r\n\r\n[list][*]Base Damage: Default= ~12, Altered= 30(Fast & Fastest)\r\n[*]Speed: Default= ~0.85, Altered= 1.5(Fast), 2.0(Fastest)\r\n[*]Weight: Default= ~12, Altered= ~8(Fast & Fastest)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Arrows[/b]\r\n\r\n[list][*]Base Damage: Default= ~17, Altered= 30(Fast & Fastest)\r\n[*]Impact Force(Affects Arrows): Default= 1.0, Altered= 250.0(Fast), 500.0(Fastest)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Greatswords, Battleaxes, Warhammers[/b]\r\n\r\n[list][*]Base Damage: Default= ~21, Altered= 40(Fast & Fastest)\r\n[*]Speed: Default= ~0.65, Altered= 1.5(Fast), 2.0(Fastest)\r\n[*]Weight: Default= ~23, Altered= ~19(Fast & Fastest)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Daggers[/b]\r\n\r\n[list][*]Base Damage: Default= ~8, Altered= 20.0(Fast & Fastest)\r\n[*]Speed: Default= ~1.3, Altered= 1.5(Fast), 1.8 (Fastest)\r\n[*]Weight: Default= ~3, Altered= ~2(Fast & Fastest)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nNote: ~ means that the corresponding value was averaged and rounded.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#CCFF00\\\"]*[b]If I missed a weapon, please let me know in the comments section or via PM.

Paste the .esp(s) into your Skyrim\\\\Data Folder*\r\n\r\n3. Run your Skyrim Launcher (OR NMM)\r\n\r\n4. Click \\\"Data Files,\\\" a window displaying all the .esms and .esps in your skyrim\\\\data folder should appear\r\n\r\n5. Select my mod\\'s .esp(s) and position them somewhere near the top of the list, or above/ below any other mods that affect weapon speed.**\r\n\r\n6. Once you have the .esp(s) situated, click the OK button.\r\n\r\n7. At last! You\\'re done!*** Now go enjoy my mod, and don\\'t forget to endorse it on the Nexus if you like it! ;D\r\n\r\n*This folder is normally found in C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\data, which can be located manually or you can Copy/ Paste \\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\" (without the quotes) into your start menu\\'s \\\"Run\\\" window and click OK. Your Skyrim\\\\Data folder will be opened and you can now paste the .esp(s) you want into it.\r\n\r\n**If you have other mods that affect VANILLA weapons similar to the way mine does and you want to KEEP that mod\\'s effects, place my .esp(s) ABOVE the other mod\\'s.\r\n**If you have other mods that affect VANILLA weapons similar to the way mine does and you want to OVERWRITE that mod\\'s effects, place my .esp(s) BELOW the other mod\\'s.\r\n\r\n***If you plan on using the Unrealistic .esps, then I HIGHLY recommend that you add the lines for the Skyrim.ini that I showed you in the Description.\r\n\r\nNote: NMM Installation is NOT supported. I have no clue how to go about setting that up, so PLEASE DON\\'T ASK FOR IT. I feel that the installation is easy enough as it is with my comprehensive instructions.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://img826.imageshack.us/img826/3294/uninstallation.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#CCFF00\\\"][b]1. Start the Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file(s).\r\n2. Delete the .esp file(s) from \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n\r\nNote: There are no script files included in this mod, so there should be NO remaining data lodged in your save game file(s) to cause trouble later. :D[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/2292/incompatibility.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#CCFF00\\\"][b]This mod *should* only be incompatible with other mods that change the attributes of Vanilla Skyrim\\'s weapons that are listed in the Details section.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/606/knownissues.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#CCFF00\\\"][b]The mod\\'s mechanics themselves do not have any bugs that I know of, BUT... If you want to use an .esp from the \\\"All Weapons\\\" folder, then you can ONLY use that one .esp. If you use ANY other .esp from another folder, then problems might and probably will arise.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, you can use ONE of the .esps from the \\\"Ranged Weapons (Bows & Staves)\\\" folder with ONE of the .esps from the \\\"Melee Weapons (swords, Axes, etc)\\\" folder with ONE of the .esps from the \\\"Arrows Only\\\" folder with ONE of the .esps from the \\\"Magic Weapons (Staves)\\\" folder, and vice versa. I purposely designed things to be modular so that you can mix and match things to your heart\\'s content.\r\n\r\nYou\\'re welcome.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/3852/historydy.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#CCFF00\\\"][b]0.6\t6/17/2012 - Initial release.\r\n0.6.9\t6/18/2012 - Changed All Weapons->Unrealistic->Fast & Fastest .esps to include Daedric Artifacts and weight for all weapons.\r\n0.7\t6/19/2012 - Reworked folder structure to allow for fully modular customization, completed the integration of Daedric Artifacts into all relevant .esps.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/3116/creditsnm.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#CCFF00\\\"][b]Bethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit. :][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/1351/toolsused.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#CCFF00\\\"][b]7-Zip\r\nBethesda\\'s Creation Kit\r\nLHammond\\'s Readme Generator[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://img853.imageshack.us/img853/9246/contactv.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#CCFF00\\\"][b]You can PM me with any questions, comments, or suggestions on my Skyrim Nexus Account, Xanins.
