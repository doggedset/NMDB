  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod. I made it for myself after, but I decided to upload it if anyone wanted something similar (this has both Male and Female versions included).\r\n\r\nI always thought that the Imperial Studded armor was too similar to the Light armor, it just had the small piece of chainmail attached. \r\n\r\nThis mod simply replaces the texture to add more chainmail to the armor and differentiate it more from the light armor.\r\n\r\nVersion 2: Redid the texture with smaller rings and a better normal map. All Imperial studded armor is now renamed ingame.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to do whatever you want with these files.",
