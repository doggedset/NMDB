  "descriptionHtml": "This modular mod Removes perks that cause big jumps in skill effectiveness (such as juggernaut, enchanter, armsman or destruction Novice)  in place of a more gradual increase that doesn\\'t require perk points. Being more Realistic and allowing the player to diversify better . Balance!! The mod doesn\\'t make the game harder.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE concerning Normal Weapon skills (marksman,one handed, two handed) \r\n\r\nWeapon damage increases to 150% at 100 skill level. 5 perks Perks Double this to 300% \r\n\r\nMy mod (and npcs) The skill is at 300% efficiency at level 100 . Simple \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious itteration http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12984\r\n\r\nIf you imagine skyrim\\'s skill advancement being stairs, This mod makes each skill more of a ramp (which attains the same hight) If im not explaining this well enough- Skill Levels have a much larger effect on the player. I didn\\'t like how in vanilla skyrim i had to level up to buy a perk to improve a skill.. it was just silly. I also didn\\'t like how i couldn\\'t get Most perks because i had to buy the 20% or  1/5 ones to keep up\r\n\r\nFear not, For removal of this mod will give back any perks that you had beforehand. Furthermore the Esps are modular. This is so that you may Use parts of this mod with other perk changing mods. \r\n\r\nMain controls Weapon skills, Enchant, alchemy and armour skills.  This increases their effectiveness as you increase in skill\r\nMagic is seperate and contains Restoration,destruction,conjuration,alteration and illusion. I did this seperate as many mods Change these. This reduces magicka cost for spells as you increase in skill\r\nLockpick- This only does lockpicking. However, I haven\\'t made lockpicking improve without perks more than it normaly does (i don\\'t know how to) I included it because some of you may have thought about getting some of it\\'s perks but did not want to go through the nov/ap/ad/ex perks to get them. \r\nI have not modified Block or sneak because i do not know how. I have not modified smiting because it\\'s currently too much work, Although i have a good plan for it if i decide to do it.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, I may make Additional perks. These will be in alternative files. They will be balanced and lore friendly.  Any problems you find, i will fix. Don\\'t forget to endorse/comment\r\n\r\nDifferences between this and skill based skyrim- \r\n- My mod is better for New Characters. He still has one Useless perk for each skill.\r\n- My mod is modular and covers Nearly double the amount of skills. (7 skills,13 skills) You can download His changes and keep my Magic/lockpicking changes if you like both mods, Or if you download a mod which conflicts with mine. His mod is Less likely to conflict with some other perk mods. \r\n\r\nSo if you love my mod But also love a Mod conflicting with my \\\"Main\\\" file- I recommend you download his mod- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14783 and replace it with my main file.
