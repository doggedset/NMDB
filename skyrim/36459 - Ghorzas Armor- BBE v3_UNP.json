Armor, gauntlets, boots, helmet, shield.\r<br />The heavy armor properties are like the orcish armor but the weight is slightly lower.\r<br />The light armor properties are like a glass armor. \r<br />Available at Ghorza gra-Bagol in Markarth.\r<br />\r<br />Ghorza, the blacksmith from Markarth has designed her own armor exclusively for female fighters.\r<br />Ghorza has gained through her time with the Legion experience and impressions and let this flow into their design of a suit of armor.\r<br />\r<br />First and foremost, I have made this mod for myself in order to prepare my female Character for Dragonborn (not required). Moreover, it is a complement to my other mods, Svartbough and Orcish Sabre.\r<br />Of course I want them also provide to people who are looking for a armor for their female Character, without expectation that everyone likes it. \r<br />No curvy version, because I prefer it less ample. \r<br />\r<br />So, here is my first armor mod release.\r<br />\r<br />Note, to prevent incompatibilities with mods like SkyRe or Requiem, you may\r<br />download the optional &#34;Ghorza&#39;s Armor NP&#34; (non purchasable version) esp. file. \r<br />\r<br />If you have the respective mods or want to use they, I recomand to download the optional files  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23244]&#34;Svartbough lesser greenish &#34;[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25361]&#34; Orcish Sabre lesser greenish &#34;[/url] for a better matching to the armor. Main files required.\r<br />\r<br />Have fun playing&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This plugin was created with Blender, Gimp, and the Creation Kit\r<br />For the basic shapes of boots, pants and gloves and the helmet tail, I modified originals from Bethesda, also the texture of the helmet tail. \r<br />For the chainmail coat, I modified the upper part of an torso from Caliente&#39;s body mod. \r<br />All other meshes, as plates, belts, buckles, shield, helmet and details and all other textures are own creations.\r<br />\r<br />When using the plug in or parts of it for projects that are published\r<br />I ask for a reference to me as the author of  Ghorza&#39;s Armor.\r<br />\r<br />If there are severe issues, please report.\r<br />\r<br />You can contact me at skyrim nexus\r<br />\r<br />My thanks goes to Bethesda and nexus network\r<br />especially to Caliente for the CBBE body and Dimon99 for the UNP body\r<br />Very many thanks to 83Willow. She made the amazing images with the beautiful orc [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/938388/?#]Claymora[/url]  \r<br />I would also like to thank asianboy345, who inspired me to make an UNP Version,\r<br />hodilton and [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/7161804-mrabubu/]mrabubu[/url] for the videos, FrankBlack, also for great images\r<br />and as last Aruberikku, who fixed some wrong texture resolutions.",
