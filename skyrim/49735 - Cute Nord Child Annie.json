  "descriptionHtml": "A mod I made rather quickly today. It adds a unique ginger Nord girl named Annie to the Honorhall Orphanage in Riften. She&#39;s based on a musical play that I watched in a theater here in Sweden last year, the play was in fact better than I expected.\r<br />\r<br />Backstory:\r<br />Annie was left by her diseased parents outside the door of the orphanage as an infant and has lived there for 11 years. For every day that has passed during her childhood, she has been hoping for her parents to come back and pick her up. She&#39;s even planning on escaping the orphanage one day, just like Aventus.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m starting to think that the Honorhall Orphanage is some kind of easter egg based on the Disney movie Annie. Think of it, there are kids (although only girls in Annie) as well as strict personnel who is mistreating them and telling them that no one will [i]ever[/i] adopt them.\r<br />\r<br />Required files:\r<br />Hearthfire\r<br />Xvision Children - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38712/?\r<br />ApachiiSkyHair - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?\r<br />\r<br />Recommended files:\r<br />Make any child your follower - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23030/?\r<br />ApachiiSkyHair natural Retexture - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35092/?\r<br />\r<br />Known bugs:\r<br />Maybe it&#39;s just me but Annie might have two identical dialogue options for adoption.\r<br />\r<br />Screenshots and videos are always welcome&#33; I&#39;d also be glad if someone could make a machinima with one of these songs; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-DSywKhS7Y&list=PL3EB6C20B6E4B7890",
