  "summary": "Nora Strongheart is a rework using the NPCE, of an excellent follower mod named Naomi Stormlake Gothic Follower by SpiderAkiraC.",
  "descriptionHtml": " I have used Akira\\'s Naomi since the beginning of my game and love her look and game play. I recently changed her using the NPCE so she would work better with CBBE and a couple of other mods I use. I tweaked her looks a bit, facial texture color and changed her hair as well as her face a touch. Because of the length of time I\\'ve used the base character she is well tested.  Her stats have remained the same except I added Agile Defender to her perks. Changed her Makeup Job and removed her Tat, gave her the Sultry Voice instead of Young Eager. Her weight is 45 and scale is 1.00 \r\n\r\nSo now she is Nora Strongheart. a Nord Woman,\r\n\r\nLevel - 40\r\nClass - Spellsword\r\nDefault armor - Ebony set without helmet/shield\r\nWeapon of choice - 1H Ebony sword\r\nSecondary Weapon - 2H Ebony sword\r\nPrimary attack - Lighting Bolt\r\nMarriable - Yes\r\n\r\nSpells\r\nLighting Bolt\r\nRaise Zombie Left Hand\r\nHealing\r\nHeal other (not sure if it works)\r\n\r\n\r\nShe can be found in the Winking Skeever in Solitude\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at using the NPCE to create a mod so please feel free to give any crit you may have, I would appreciate honesty, it\\'s the only way to get better at this and move on to more complicated stuff. Thanks.\r\n\r\nIn order for Nora to look like she does in the pictures you need the following mods:\r\n\r\nNatural Eyes by nevenbridge\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589/?\r\n\r\nCalientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666/?\r\n\r\nCBBE skin texture V2 V3 plus Thepal and UNP compatible by navetsea\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6554/?\r\n\r\nArmor by KIller Keo\\'s mod:\r\nKiller Keos Skimpy CBBE V2-V3 Armor Replacer\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3654/?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to these guys for such excellent mods\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to SpiderAkiraC for permission to use Naomi Stormlake Gothic Follower. \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31078/?",
