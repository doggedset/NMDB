Blood demands blood. We have lived and lost at the whims of our masters for too long. I would not have it so. I would not see the passing of a brother, for the purpose of sport. I would not see another heart ripped from a chest, or breath forfeit for no cause. I know not all of you wish this, yet it is done. It is done. Your lives are your own.

This is a one off mod. I don&#39;t normally mod Skyrim, so asking for Crixus/Gannicus&#39; armor etc is not something I&#39;m going to do. I made this one because there weren&#39;t any Gladiator armors for Skyrim. I chose this specific armor as a tribute to the late Andy Whitfield.\r<br />\r<br />The first armor set is Murmillo, what is used by Spartacus in the arena in his battle against Theokoles, paired with a shield. The other is Dimachaerus which has two arm manicas instead of one for dual wield fighters.\r<br />\r<br />I have included a gladius made by Jedo_Dre. I also made Spartacus&#39; trademark curved Acinaces sword based off his model.\r<br />\r<br />All the weapons and armor can be crafted under the Steel category at a forge.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/Vy6FGiY.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[i]What would you do, to hold your wife again? To feel the warmth of her skin, the taste of her lips? How many men would you kill? A hundred? A thousand? There stands but one between you and her.[/i] \r<br />[right][color=orange][b]- Spartacus to Batiatus[/b][/color][/right]\r<br />\r<br />Scottmack - Models/Textures\r<br />Nivea - Rigging Murmillo armors\r<br />Hothtrooper44 - Rigging Dimachaerus armors and 2D art\r<br />maty742 - Plumes models and textures http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31521//?\r<br />Jedo_Dre - Gladius from http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10740/?\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/ApZMK7P.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />This is a Nexus exclusive.
