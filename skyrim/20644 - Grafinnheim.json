  "descriptionHtml": "Grafinnheim is intended to allow starting players a small room to store items and sleep initially, and then to open into a more fully equipped player home once they have gained the necessary abilities to beat the dungeon below it. There is a spell to teleport you and whatever followers you have nearby to and from there also. The background story is in books found in the location.\r\n\r\nExplore the area south west of Riverwood for clue to the location.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to get straight there, \\\"coc grafinnheim\\\" in the command console should put you right inside the front door.\r\n\r\nThere\\'s a more complete walkthrough in the ReadMe that should help you if you\\'re having trouble with any part.",
