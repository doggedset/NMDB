  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][font=Georgia][color=#dd7e6b][size=6]Garnet Tower[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />[color=#3c78d8]A Thane&#39;s Keep[/color]\r<br />\r<br />In light of Tullius&#39; inspired ambush and capture of Ulfric and his men at Darkwater Crossing, a modest keep was appropriated by the legion for the task. Here, the Dragonborn may find the place abandoned and move-in ready&#33; \r<br />\r<br />The player home is cozy, similar in size to Honeyside or Breezehome, furnished with commoner amenities but detailed to be very much like a medieval keep. There are several lovely design choices, and the location provides a scenic view all around. The home comes with many Hearthfire amenities, including being Multiple Adoption Friendly, although there are only 2 beds for children or followers. There are several soil patches for a garden, and a smithy behind the tower proper. And, most appropriately, there are well over a dozen weapon displays as well as 2 mannequins. Storage is plentiful as well, and you&#39;ll find a few unique options in that regard. \r<br />\r<br />Perhaps most importantly, the keep is compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67305/?]Artmoor&#39;s Darkwater Crossing[/url] and others&#33; It exists in the cell right of the south side of the bridge leading to the hamlet. And thank you Lolikyonyu for your[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62733/?] Lolicept Resources[/url]&#33; \r<br />\r<br />I hope the rest of the winter treats you well, and thank you for trying this out&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[color=#e06666]Requirements:[/color]\r<br />- Update, Hearthfire [/center]",
