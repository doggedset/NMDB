  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Comic Sans MS][size=4][u]Description[/u][/size][/font]This is just a simple (read: sloppy and desperate) modification to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2000006]JZBai's[/url] magnificent [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62017]Throwing weapons LIte[/url] to get them to cool it﻿. I slapped these changes to his mod for personal use a long time ago. I didn't bother to repack the BSA because, why would I? Also, might wanna change some other stuff later down the road. Also, I should be elsewhere adulting instead of screwing around. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][size=4][u]Features[/u][/size][/font]\n<br />Weapons are scrolls again.. yet still ammo somehow, so, you can throw knives from your left hand. If you lift a throwing weapon from a dead bandit, the other option (should) disappear.\n<br />\n<br />Throwing knives also fly instantaneously. You don't have to charge it like the others because.. duh, they weigh very little. \n<br />Knives are the only weapon here that can be wielded in the left hand. Remember, if you can do it, NPCs can as well and I grew tired of double damage from dual=wielding, axe-throwing bandits. But If there is enough demand to throw stuff other than knives with the left hand-- I still won't be bothered.. maybe.. I dunno. I'm a fickle pickle.\n<br />\n<br />Also, I reduced the number of throwable weapons NPC's carry to a tolerable amount. No NPC should have 5 oilpots or 10 javelins or 10 axes. \n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]If it explodes they only should carry 1.\n<br />[*]If it would be cumbersome to carry (Axes and javelins) they should only carry 2\n<br />[*]As for knives.. I can only tolerate 5 knives being thrown at me before I lose my SHIT, and console GODMOD on someone's ASS! Speaking of knives, they now fly straight. No more handle kills.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Oh, and lastly, the fire from oilpots has been nerfed! The magnitude from before was like a base of 20 damage for 2 seconds.. now it's only a base of 7 damage for 2 seconds.. or so I believe. You won't die within two seconds like before. Vampires and Draugrs everywhere, REJOICE!! \n<br />\n<br />There are also two different versions to download for now: 1 with the cosmetic quivers and the other without them, besides javelins. After a while.. I grew tired of an oilpot hanging off the side of my character's booty. \n<br />\n<br />[u][font=Comic Sans MS][size=4]Requirements[/size][/font][/u]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Dawngaurd\n<br />[*]Dragonborn\n<br />[*]If you want better-throwing animations,  you'll find that download on[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62017?tab=description] JZbai's Mod[/url]﻿ page.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[u][font=Comic Sans MS][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/font][/u]\n<br />Same as with regular-smegular Throwing Weapons Lite.. No mods that automatically loot. I've never tried auto-looting anything so I can't personally vouch.. tho\n<br />\n<br />[u][font=Comic Sans MS][size=4]Bugs\n<br />[/size][/font][/u]So this one is important.. bows think that throwing weapons are arrows for some reason. If you equip a bow without first equipping an arrow type whilst having throwable weapons in your inventory.. Your bow and that throwable weapon will bug tf out. I don't crash from it but it's annoying, especially in the midst of battle. If you need a bow on a hotkey.. use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59171]AH Hotkey Manager[/url]﻿ or an equivalent. Make sure to have an arrow type equip with the bow or several,  just in case you run outta your first pick.  Meanwhile, I'll casually look for a fix and when I say \"casually\" I mean I probably won't. Just use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59171]AH Hotkey Manager[/url]. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][font=Comic Sans MS][size=4]Credits[/size][/font][/u]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2000006]JZbai[/url] for allowing me to bastardize his good work. And all he credited before him for all of this to be possible:\n<br />*[i][font=Arial][size=1]Hastily copies and paste[/size][/font][/i]*\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Madrilous for the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36147/?]inspiration[/url] for this mod\n<br />[*]NyQuilKY for his [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48025/?]spinning \"Throwing Weapons Redux\" nifs[/url] off of which I based the nifs for this mod from\n<br />[*]h1zchan for the new throwing animations from 2.02 BETA which can be found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64438/?]here[/url]\n<br />[*]Hothtrooper and Eckss for making available the source code for \"Immersive Armors\" from which I learned how to dynamically add items to leveled lists\n<br />[*]Ousnius for making the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4089/?]nif converter for Skyrim Special Edition[/url] which my mod needed\n<br />[*]Fore for making [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11811/?]FNIS[/url] and providing WONDERFUL documentation on how to make a FNIS dependent mod\n<br />[*]whoever contributes to the Creation Kit wiki for providing documentation on Papyrus functions which Bethesda for some reason were too lazy to document and finally Bethesda for Skyrim, Creation Kit, and for making this game moddable because it would kinda be a crappy game if it weren't... :P\n<br />[/list]",
