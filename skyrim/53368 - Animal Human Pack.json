  "summary": "This is just a simple mod that adds 3 new NPCs that are animal versions of some people",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will add an animal version of 3 people so far\r<br />Nazeem-Skeever\r<br />Ysolda-Mudcrab\r<br />Heimskr-Chicken\r<br />\r<br />The 3 of them can be found in Dragonsreach. Chicken Heimskr is near the stairs, Skeever Nazeem is near the throne, and Mudcrab Ysolda is near the room Farengar is in. They also have the same voice as their human counterparts. \r<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />Q:Will I get a bounty for killing them?\r<br />A:No, if you hit Skeever Nazeem and he survives then he could attack you but no bounty\r<br />\r<br />Q:Are you planning to make more of these in the future?\r<br />A:Yes\r<br />\r<br />Q:Will downloading the mod REPLACE Heimskr, Ysolda, and Nazeem?\r<br />A:No, I just simply added a new NPC using their voices\r<br />\r<br />Q:Will they stay in Dragonsreach?\r<br />A:Yes, they won&#39;t move unless you attack them\r<br />___________________________________________________________________________\r<br />Known Bugs\r<br />\r<br />The only bugs I saw so far is in the Bannered Mare and with Mudcrab Ysolda\r<br />1.The fire in the Bannered Mare for some reason isn&#39;t there anymore and (not entirely sure) Mikael won&#39;t go to the Bannered Mare\r<br />2.Mudcrab Ysolda&#39;s body will partially go under the floor for some reason\r<br />3. NEW another Skeever Nazeem will spawn near the entrance of Dragonsreach\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t really know what was causing these bugs and I don&#39;t know how to fix bugs using mods so I&#39;ll appreciate it if someone helps me fix those bugs.\r<br />\r<br />If you have any suggestions, pls post in the comments",
