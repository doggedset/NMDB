  "summary": "Simple edit of Stenvars hair and facialhair",
  "descriptionHtml": "I just edited Stenvar's hair and facialhair so he would be hairier and more barbarian/crazy looking (to me atleast).\r\n\r\nStenvar is purely Bethesda's™ work, and this simple mod should work with most mods, but not with any other mod that changes Stenvar's appearance.\r\n\r\nI made the mod for personal reasons. But I felt like since this community has been giving me so much, it was time to give something back.\r\n\r\nThe new style is partially based on the Game of Thrones™ character Tormund Giantsbane played by Kristoffer Hivju.\r\n\r\nENB in Screenshots are Somber ENB Lut Sepia: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41465/?",
