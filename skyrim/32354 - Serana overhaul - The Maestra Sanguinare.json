  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i217/Braigus09/4ce83a5e-b093-450b-bb28-aae7a18301ab_zps59926d71.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i217/Braigus09/cooltext931399492_zpsf3b4a699.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSerana, when most Skyrim community hear her name, some may cringe, some may drool (ew). Me among them who can\\'t stand her. Well not just because she\\'s annoying but because she\\'s too much of a burden than a true companion. Yes she has character development in the Dawnguard storyline (to me at least) but has nothing new to bring to the table when it comes to combat, and she\\'s supposed to be a member of one of the most powerful vampire clans in Tamriel. So I\\'ve decided to draw the Creation Kit to make her more substantial yet appealing at the same time. \r\n\r\nBeing a fan of Ann Rice\\'s literary work, and gothic fiction; I fashioned Serana, to fit her role as a true mistress of the night, an Arch-Sanguinaire of Nightwalkers, a true Daughter of Coldharbour, and a worthy companion.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i217/Braigus09/cooltext931399976_zps87c825e7.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b]Physical Features[/b]\r\n\r\n~Changed her hairstyle\r\n~Added a fitting warpaint for intimidation factor\r\n~Left her overall facial morph of the original. I don\\'t want to feel alienated by completely altering her appearance.\r\n~Added some custom boots and custom daedric gloves to her default outfit.\r\n\r\n[b]Combat and AI[/b]\r\n\r\nYou wouldn\\'t think I\\'d forget this don\\'t ya? This is where it all goes down. It wouldn\\'t be an overhaul without this. I quipped her with new perks and spells and revved up her AI. Perfect for Master-level Difficulty and difficulty overhaul mods, while keeping her balanced and not overpowered.\r\n\r\n~Added perks from the Destruction School, now she wouldn\\'t just spam ice spikes or ice storms along with her weak-ass vampiric drain.\r\n~Augmented her with all 3 elements. She can now cast firebolt, lightning bolt, incinerate and thunderbolt!\r\n~She is now also perked with Mage Armor, she can now cast Stoneflesh at level 30 and below, and Ironflesh at level 31 and above. This is for her survivability. Now she can hold her own without you running back for her aid. \r\n~Revamped her Conjuration tree, she can now also summon Gargoyles at her aid.\r\n~She has now access to the vampiric ability of Dread Cloak. A revved frost cloak, that she can use multiple times a day.\r\n~Reworked her Vampiric Drain, I tweaked her drain spell a bit to be more useful to her and I made it a single-target spell. So you don\\'t have to worry about her friendly-firing your other companions, that is of course, if they get in the way. (Damn you Farkas)\r\n~She now has her own weapon, the Volkihar Blade. A custom sword, reworked from Harkon\\'s Sword. It retains the original enchantment but I scaled up the base damage a bit that of the Blades Sword. You can take it from her inventory OR... from Harkon, that\\'s right I also placed it on Harkon\\'s inventory. So you can get it by the end of the Dawnguard questline.\r\n~She is now also perked with Sneak, now you can have her along Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood questlines\r\n\r\n[b]UPDATE[/b]\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 \r\n\r\n~now includes the optional file if you want Serana\\'s original look yet has the same stats and perks of the main file.\r\n\r\n[B]IMPORTANT:[/B] Choose only one of the two esps.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i217/Braigus09/cooltext931433478_zps8db77fad.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n~Dawnguard DLC\r\n~Skyrim 1.8+\r\n~ApachiiSkyHair 1.5\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i217/Braigus09/cooltext931433291_zpsaae03eb4.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n~Just drag and drop to your data folder and you\\'re ready to go!\r\n~[b]IMPORTANT[/b] If you\\'re gonna install this mod, make sure you don\\'t have Serana in your proximity.
