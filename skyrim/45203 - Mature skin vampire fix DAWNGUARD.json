  "summary": "Love the Mature skin texture, but can&#39;t play as a vampire cause of ugly neck seams. Or are annoyed by neck seams by other vampires while having Dawnguard installed, but want to keep it vanilla? Here&#39;s a neck seam fix for you :).",
  "descriptionHtml": "EDIT:\r<br />Less dirt only deletes dirt from the main texture. However, most dirt is added by a separate dirt mask, only detectable in CK. If you want THAT to be gone, you&#39;ll need to download a separate mod, I&#39;ve seen one on the nexus. However the main texture will be more smooth and less dirt in general, see comparison picture.\r<br />\r<br />On the comparison without dirt mask I use the dirt mask remover from this mod, but not the textures:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21656/\r<br />\r<br />WHAT DOES IT?\r<br />making the Dawnguard vampire texture for female (high resolution texture pack) flow over into the Mature Skin texture from here:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32986/?\r<br />\r<br />HOW?\r<br />I tried to make the neck part flow over from the normal face texture into the vampire face texture in Photoshop with 3 layers (original face, vampire 50% and vampire 100%) for diffuse and 2 (original face, vampire face) for bump map. Then make the layer flow over into each other as good as I could.\r<br />\r<br />WHY?\r<br />When playing a vampire with this skin texture while having Dawnguard installed, you get a huge neck seam between Dawnguard head texture and Maevan2s body texture. This greatly reduces it, trough it does not seem to fix 100%, it like 90% fixet.\r<br />\r<br />WIL YOU MAKE IT FOR ... SKIN TEXTURE?\r<br />No, I made this for myself and I really do not like those doll like textures the rest seam to use. I rather like my female to look like woman. I don&#39;t even know teens with such a perfect faces, only girls around 7 years old and woman with way to much make-up...\r<br />I also was so stupid to not save the Photoshop file so you can&#39;t just add another original head texture to it.\r<br />\r<br />WHAT DOES IT CONTAIN:\r<br />A head texture and a normal map for it. Bove are made to fit to fit the mature texture set.\r<br />You will need the original texture by Maevan2 for it to work.\r<br />\r<br />HOW DO I INSTALL?\r<br />The rar file simple contains the two textures. You gotta copy them into this folder:\r<br />[your Skyrim root]&#92;Data&#92;Textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;female.\r<br />\r<br />I DON&#39;T HAVE DAWNGUARD?\r<br />No need to download, Dawnguard chances vampires, I believe that before Dawnguard vampires use vanilla head anyways. If not, this would still be no fix.\r<br />\r<br />DOES THIS WORK FOR MALES?\r<br />no, I don&#39;t use a replacer for females as I feel guys look okay. Vanilla guys will obviously fit with vanilla textures...",
