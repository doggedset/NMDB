This includes floral objects, rocks, ruin clutter and a lot of other landscape assets. This also aims to improve the distant appearance of mountains, cliffs and other rock formations. Requires DynDOLOD to generate proper Distant- and TreeLODs. This is the official resumption and continuation of the mod. The Redux update does improve some parts of the mod, while also adding many new objects and improving general compatibility. The new Redux version is the official continuation of the original mod.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][b]Requirement:[/b] [/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59721/?]Dynamic Distant Objects LOD - DynDOLOD by Sheson[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=6][u]FEATURES[/u][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Mountains Enhanced[/b][/size]\n<br />One of Enhanced Landscapes main features is the enhancement/improvement of Skyrims mountains with more objects and a better distant appearance. I've added thousands of rock/mountain objects all around Skyrim to completely overhaul the vanilla mountain appearance, the result is stunning, the mountains of Skyrim never have looked better.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Throat of the World[/b][/size]\n<br />The Throat of the World was overhaul by adding more mountain/rock objects and removing most of the trees. This makes the Throat of the World look like a real mountain.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Pine Forest[/b][/size]\n<br />The vanilla forests of Skyrim aren't really what you would call forests. Enhanced Landscapes adds hundreds of trees all over Skyrim, increases existing ones in size and makes forests feel much more dense/lush and realistic. The mod also comes with its own tree addon. I also made the forests around falkreath a lot denser and increased the tree sizes, it looks a lot better now.\n<br />[size=3][b]\n<br />Autumn Forest[/b][/size]\n<br />The Rift got a big overhaul with colored/autumn-inspired aspen trees, a lot more floral objects and a lot of landscape improvements. In my opinion the aspen forests looked too monotonous, so I overhauled them with unqiue colored autumn trees to make this fantasy world more beautiful and varied. You can [b]choose between colored autumn trees and green spring trees in the installer[/b], texture size is 2048x2048, which will look good and also have an minimal impact on performance.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Hjaalmarch Enhanced[/b][/size]\n<br />The vanilla marsh is a great area but lacks in uniqueness, so Enhanced Landscapes overhauls the marsh region with more floral objects and ruin clutter to make this area a lot more beautiful and unique. There are also two optional files available for this region of Skyrim: \"Barren Marsh\" and \"Dead Marsh\". The Barren Marsh plugin removes almost all trees from the marsh and gives this region a completely new atmosphere. The Dead Marsh plugin, however, changes all pine trees in the marsh region to dead trees for a more dark-fantasy inspired look.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Volcanic Tundra Revamped[/b][/size]\n<br />I made a lot of changes to this region. Enhanced Landscapes overhauls the rock formations, added hundred of landscape objects - existing and new ones like ferns, mushrooms, trees, small rocks, ruin clutter and much more.\n<br />[size=3][b]\n<br />Better City Outskirts[/b][/size]\n<br />Better looking city outskirts. Enhanced Landscapes overhauls the outside areas of Markarth, Windhelm, Riften, Whiterun and Solitude. These are just small landscape changes, but they'll make the outskirts look a lot better.\n<br />[size=3][b]\n<br />[/b][b]Landscape Enhancements[/b][/size]\n<br />Main part of Enhanced Landscpaes are thousands of changes all over Skyrim. New added floral objects, ruin clutter or just small improvements of different locations. This mod adds hundreds of objects and changes a lot of existing ones. The list is far too long to enumerate every little change, but you'll absolutely see the difference when wandering around Skyrim. I've added water lilies to a lot of rivers and lakes, overhauled the roads with many different objects and also made general enhancements to small farms, ruins and many other places throughout Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#6fa8dc][size=3]DLC Patch[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Version 1.4.0+ includes a new file called \"[color=#6fa8dc]Enhanced Landscapes - Patch.esp[/color]\". This file fixes incompatibility with Hearthfire DLC and forwards missing/deleted records from the DLCs and Unofficial Patches (especially XCLN records).[color=#dd7e6b] Load it as last in your load order!\n<br />\n<br />[/color][b][size=6][u]OPTIONAL FILES[/u][/size][/b]\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffd966]Included in the installer[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3][b]Barren Marsh[/b][/size]\n<br />This optional file will remove all pine/dead trees from the marsh region and make it look barren. Gives the marsh region a completely different atmosphere. [color=#f6b26b]Part of the main file.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Dead Marsh[/size]\n<br />[/b]This optional file will overhaul the marsh region with new dead trees &amp; morrowind-inspired giant mushrooms. This was originally part of the main file and is now chooseable as optional file. [color=#f6b26b]Part of the main file.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Grasses and Plants[/b][/size]\n<br />Based on [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88876]Unbelievable Grass 2 Redux[/url]﻿. \n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Green Fields[/b][/size]\n<br />This optional file will turn the tundra region into summer-like grasslands with green grasses, new green landscape textures and proper distant terrain textures. It also changes some textures of Whiterun. [color=#93c47d]This optional file is part of the grasses and plants addon and will only work with the grass plugin from Enhanced Landscapes, since it is build on that one.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Aspen Color Variety\n<br />[/b][/size][size=2]You can either choose mixed or single colored tree leafs for aspen trees. Mixed = yellow, red and orange mixed. Single = yellow, red and green.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b][size=5]WINTER EDITION[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d]Available as optional download.

Enhanced Landscapes contains a .ini files with references of objects that conflict with some specific mods. When generating LOD with DynDOLOD it will find the references, depending on the mods you use, and disable them. This doesn't mean all mods will work; Below is a list with mods which were patched.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]List of patched mods[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#4caac9]Enhanced Towns and Cities[/color] ([color=#dab844]works with ETaC Complete &amp; ETaC Modular + [i]ETaC - Dragon Bridge South Addon[/i][/color]) [color=#da4444]load ETaC_Complete.esp (or any of the modular files) after Enhanced Landscapes.esp &amp; all other EL files [/color]\n<br />[*][color=#4caac9]JK's Skyrim [/color][color=#d5d5d5]&amp;[/color][color=#4caac9] all of JK's Town Overhauls[/color]\n<br />[*][color=#4caac9]Cutting Room Floor[/color] -[color=#da4444] load Cutting Room Floor.esp after Enhanced Landscapes &amp; all other EL files[/color]\n<br />[*][color=#4caac9]Provincial Courier Service[/color]\n<br />[*]Other mods: [color=#4caac9]Gray Cowl of Nocturnal[/color] / [color=#4caac9]Pinegrove Lodge[/color] / [color=#4caac9]INIGO[/color] / [color=#4caac9]Routa[/color]\n<br />[*][color=#4caac9]Aurora Village[/color] (the mod includes a patch for EL, don't use it, use the patching function from DynDOLOD instead to patch this mod)\n<br />[*][color=#4caac9]Better City Entrances[/color] ([i][color=#e06666]only works with All-in-One version[/color][/i])\n<br />[*][color=#4caac9]Better Fast Travel - Carriages and Ships[/color] (works with Hearthfire and Vanilla version)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#e69138][b]Make sure to report any incompatiblities you find. I'll look into patching as many mods as possible.[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#93c47d][size=3]GENERAL COMPATIBILITY[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Skyrim Flora Overhaul &amp; Enhanced Vanilla Trees[/b]\n<br />Both mods are fully compatible and highly recommend, use either SFO or EVT. Also make sure to install the LodGen billboard files too. Here is a picture how the Load order should look:\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/Ac6neoh.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Town &amp; City mods[/b]\n<br />ETaC and JK's Skyrim were patched and are fully compatible. Other mods, which improve towns may be incompatible. Mods which edit the main cities are fully compatible.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Landscape texture mods[/b]\n<br />All landscape texture mods are fully compatible.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Landscape mods[/b]\n<br />There are a lot of mods available which make some small landscape edits here and there. Most of these mod only cover a few areas and only add a few objects. Enhanced landscapes aims to improve landscapes, locations, rock formations, mountains, roads and paths all over Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Simply Bigger Trees &amp; Skyrim Flora Overhaul and other Tree Mods[/b]\n<br />Fully compatible with the Basic files but since I increased alot of trees by hand, there may be some clipping or extraordinary big trees. Also Skyrim Flora Overhaul and every other tree mod is fully compatible with Enhanced Landscapes, as long as it only affects the meshes and doesn't place any new trees around Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul[/b]\n<br />Compatible, though there may be some bad AI acting. Most new added objects have collision boxes with NavCut (which will prevent NPCs from walking through them). \n<br />\n<br />[b]Touring Carriages[/b]\n<br />Not compatible. Due to a lot of objects added alongside roads it will end up in issues where the carriages will not pass through.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Merging all files into one[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />If you want to merge all Enhanced Landscapes files into one file, using the Merge Plugins xEdit Script or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69905]Merge Plugins[/url], make sure to name the output file \"Enhanced Landscapes - Merged.esp\". I've included a ini file for patching incompatibilities, which is depended on that file name. So you can use the merged file to generate LODs with DynDOLOD and patch incompatible mods. You can merge all files to save esp space.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=6][u]CREDITS[/u]\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]elinen and ztree for their [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24735/]grass resource[/url] - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29486/]water plants resource[/url] - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55158/?]flowers resource[/url] - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38651/?]trees and plants[/url][/size]\n<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10402/?][size=2]Morrowind mushrooms - modder resource by scot[/size][/url]\n<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59632/?][size=2]Phitt's Sheogorad Resource[/size][/url]\n<br />[*][size=2][url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/2144962-3amt/]3AMt [/url]for tree meshes and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/41808/?]vurt [/url]for textures -&gt; [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61932/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61932/?[/url][/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/141/?]vurt \"skyrim flora overhaul\"[/url][/size]\n<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24364/?][size=2]AOF HD Tree LODs by AnOldFriend[/size][/url]\n<br />[*][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3155782/?]sheson[/url] for creating DynDOLOD and also for a lot of advice regarding DynDOLOD. Also a big thanks for implementing a new patching function into DynDOLOD.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5866043/?]Shurah[/url] for a lot of advice and help regarding AI issues caused by new added objects.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]A big thanks to everyone, which helps with advice, suggestions or bug reports.[/size]\n<br />[/list]",
