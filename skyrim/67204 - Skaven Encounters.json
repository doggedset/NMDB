  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]REQUIRES DRAGONBORN[/u]\r<br />\r<br />What this mod does: \r<br />[/b]This mod takes all the Skaven creatures created by Buffscale McThundertail and Haishao and adds them to the leveled list so that you will encounter them out in the wild. These creatures are based off Warhammer fantasy. You will find Skaven archers, ogres, peons, riders, assassins, Globadiers, and leaders. They wear armor accordingly and carry weapons as well.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Where can I find them:[/b]\r<br />Skaven Riders will show up in hills, mountains, and the plains outside Whiterun running around.\r<br />Skaven Ogres show up most places, but they&#39;re more common in Marshlands.\r<br />All the other Skaven show up in all places except the colder regions of the game.\r<br />\r<br />Also note that Skaven Spawning doesn&#39;t start until level 10. If you have trouble finding some make sure you&#39;re level 10 and up, not in the very cold climates, and just be patient. You&#39;ll find some eventually.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]V1.1 Slight Update\r<br />[/u][/b]Some were complaining that Skaven were too rare. And some wanted them to show up in dungeons. This update hopes to please those people. Skaven spawning should be slightly increased, but not too much so that you&#39;ll be getting them everywhere. Fixed Skaven spawning in the plains region, should work properly now. \r<br />\r<br />Dungeon Skaven are now a thing, but I haven&#39;t replaced Draugr, Falmer, bandits, etc with Skaven. In dungeons where misc &#34;nuisance&#34; creatures would show up such as Skeevers, Spiders, Trolls, etc. You&#39;ll now have a chance to have a Skaven as well.\r<br />\r<br />...And you might find a little something more when fighting Falmer.\r<br />\r<br />Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]If you want to spawn some in instead of waiting for some to show up:\r<br />~\r<br />help &#34;monster name&#34;\r<br />Lists\r<br />Skaven Archer\r<br />Skaven Elite\r<br />Skaven Globadier\r<br />Squeakers the Unholy (two variants, mounted and normal)\r<br />Skaven Soldier\r<br />Skaven Assassin\r<br />Bubba\r<br />Little John\r<br />Ray\r<br />Hraughrrr\r<br />Skaven Warrior\r<br />Skaven Rider[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credit:\r<br />[/b]Credit to the Skaven resource goes to Buffscale McThundertail and Haishao.
