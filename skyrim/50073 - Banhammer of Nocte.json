  "descriptionHtml": "I made this mod in tribuite to Nocte Matrem&#39;s Skyrim Group on Facebook. She so happens to have a fetish for rules, conformity and banhammers.\r<br />\r<br />I made this weapon mod as a &#39;forum tool&#39;, or an image for comment threads. I used it on a post that was likely to get somebody banned for whatever reason. Usually due to excessive swearing or arguements stemmed from off-topic matters.\r<br />\r<br />Nocte herself gets the satire, as do a number of people so I have finally decided to share this mod public. Yes, this is a weapon mod and not the result of the restoration glitch.\r<br />\r<br />The weapon is found beside a dead TROLL in Whiterun.\r<br />Its a two handed weapon, does 666 base damage and has NO VALUE.\r<br />As in &#34;It has NO VALUE to me.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />In case you&#39;re wondering, the enchantments actually do work. The Banhammer has virtually unlimited recharge. The enchantments are paralyze, fire damage and soul trap for LITERALLY 72 hours. That is assuming they survive the base hit (which is likely 1500+ for established charcaters)\r<br />\r<br />Lets just say, this weapon makes instant or short work of any foe you&#39;ll encounter ever. Its an overpowered cheat weapon of course, but this is only a Joke mod. If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t download it. Keep it as a trophy in your extravigant Castle Mod or something.\r<br />\r<br />Again, this is a joke mod. Its an inside joke. Don&#39;t be offended. I don&#39;t care so much what you do with the .esp, so long it retains credit where due.\r<br />\r<br />Also, feel free to check out the Skyrim group here:\r<br />\r<br />https://www.facebook.com/groups/ElderScrolls.Series/\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Heed this hammer as a warning, my children.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS & SPECIAL THANKS:\r<br />\r<br />&gt;Nocte Matrem of course for her Skyrim group and Trollbait.\r<br />&gt;Myself for making this mod\r<br />&gt;Everybody who has mocked the hammer in face of Ban\r<br />&gt;The poor souls who liked my &#39;Banhammer&#39; comments\r<br />&gt;Ulbert TheEagle-Eye. Pretty much one of the best friends I have right now\r<br />&gt;Renji Tsaecii, same goes\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />R.I.P Imperial Guards and Banhammer victims.",
