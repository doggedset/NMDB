  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]**Description**\r<br />[/size]\r<br />This is Delmoag, the Dremora follower. A servant to Sanguine&#39;s court, he comes to Skyrim seeking adventure and debauchery that can&#39;t be found in the plains of Oblivion. Although Dremora may seem to have a distate for humans, Delmoag has always found them to be intriguing due to their unfamiliar nature. After hearing word of dragons appearing in Skyrim, he hopes to find a worthy mortal to cause a ruckus with.\r<br />\r<br />He can be found wandering near the entry of Riverwood while taking the path from Helgen. When you find him, he begins at level 5 and will continue to level with you while you he accompanies you in your travels. He is also eligible for marriage for all you freaky Dragonborns out there. He has been tested with Amazing Follower Tweaks, Ultimate Follower Overhaul, and My home is your home. He is compatible with all of them. \r<br />\r<br />He does not use the normal Dremora voice file due to the very limited number of voice lines they have so he uses the male Drunk voice (same as Sanguine uses). The Drunkard voice allows for marriage dialogue as well. Using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52019/?]Follower Commentary Overhaul[/url] works well with him, as this voice has some entertaining lines. His race is Dremora and therefore retains the tall height as seen in the screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />Side note: I know many many variations of this type of follower already exist, however I could not find one that suited my needs or that were compatible with the follower mods I use. I figured others may make use of it as well.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]**Recommended Mods**\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14037/?][size=2]Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/size][/url][size=2] or [/size][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?]Amazing Follower Tweaks[/url] to allow removal/change in his armor and for all the other great utility they provide to followers.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2488/?][size=2]Better Males[/size][/url][size=2] - allows him to look as he does in the screenshots. Without it he will look like a vanilla Dremora with a few facial tweaks.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52019/?]Follower Commentary Overhaul[/url] - for the reason stated above. Uses in game voice lines and adds ambient dialogue while questing.\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Mods seen in the screenshots:[/size]\r<br />[size=2]\r<br />ENB: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23812/?]Seasons of Skyrim\r<br />[/url][/size][size=2]Female Dragonborn Outfit: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67790/?]Zzjay&#39;s Wardrobe[/url][/size]",
