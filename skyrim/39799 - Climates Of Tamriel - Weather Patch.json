It&#39;s gone. Daytime sun will always be white.\r<br />&bull; Night image spaces have been adjusted for proper coloring at night time, comes with 4 new Night Levels (incompatible with CoT night levels&#33;). Examples of Night Level plugins without ENB under various conditions can be found [url=http://imgur.com/a/TwL0y#0]HERE.[/url] Going from No night Level, NL1, NL2, NL3, NL4, Fog NL4, Overcast NL4, Rain NL4.\r<br />&bull; Night time ambient lighting has been corrected, no more glowing vegetation/trees at night\r<br />&bull; Night time effect lighting has been adjusted on some weathers\r<br />&bull; Tons and tons of little fixes left and right\r<br />&bull; Compatibility available for MannyGT&#39;s Supreme Storms\r<br />&bull; Compatibility available for JonusL2D&#39;s Expanded Snow Systems - Climates of Tamriel Version\r<br />&bull; Options from Snow patch are included in the file and options in the NMM installer (bright snow fixes)\r<br />\r<br />You need the original mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17802/]Climates of Tamriel by JJC71[/url] v3.1 for this patch to work&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Load order:[/b] load after [u]any[/u] other Climates of Tamriel plugin which is part of the main mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange][b]KNOWN ISSUES AND GAME ENGINE LIMITATIONS[/b][/color]\r<br />[color=silver]&bull; Due to engine limitations the volumetric fog will disappear after opening and closing world map. This is a vanilla problem and even in the vanilla game camera attached effects not created in the CK will cease to exist after opening world map.\r<br />&bull; Due to yet another fine engine limit the fog will not nicely fade out when the weather changes to a non-foggy type, it will all be gone, all at once.\r<br />&bull; If you do not get the &#39;blur&#39; effect during heavy rain or fog and you [u]do not[/u] have Dynavision installed, make sure you have this in SkyrimPrefs.ini, as it is important for the effects to show properly&#33;\r<br />[code]\r<br />[Imagespace]\r<br />bDoDepthOfField=1\r<br />[/code]\r<br />If that is already set in SkyrimPrefs.ini, then perhaps you run an ENB and you need to set &#39;RemoveBlur&#39; under [FIX] to false in enbseries.ini or in enblocal.ini (depending on your Binary version)\r<br />[code]\r<br />[FIX]\r<br />RemoveBlur=false\r<br />[/code] \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Note that Climates of Tamriel is in no way a &#39;realistic&#39; weather mod but strongly hints to the fantasy of the game. I have so, gone with the flow of the mod not trying to be fully realistic in my colors (but not very far off it either). Read note about Real Clouds (if you use) below&#33;\r<br />\r<br />As with the normal CoT - it takes 24h in game time (or until the first weather change) before this mod is active. So if you load your game and start in overcast weather, and it looks weird...(eg. the sun is still there) wait 24h and then see again.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Not happy with something?[/b] - leave suggestion, be constructive and perhaps I can alter settings or include more.[/color]\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/JcksjxZ.png[/img]\r<br />[color=silver]This mod is recommended by the following awesome ENB mods:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48730/]Skylight ENB[/url] by Aiyeen (co-producer of this weather patch)\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30936/]RealVision ENB[/url] by SkyrimTuner\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34966/]E ENB Final Edition[/url] by ewi65\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20781/]Project ENB[/url] by bronze316\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36067/]Vividian ENB[/url] by Mangaclub[/color]\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/JcksjxZ.png[/img]\r<br />[color=darkorange][b]LOAD ORDER[/b][/color]\r<br />[color=silver]If you&#39;re also using Supreme Storms CoT version by MannyGT ( strongly suggested&#33; [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27022/]Supreme Storms by MannyGT[/url] ) there is a compatibility plugin available in the files as well. Load after Supreme Storms [b]CoT[/b] version. These presets will NOT look like what they used to be. All Rainy weathers have gone through a major overhaul.

Not needed.[/color]\r<br />[color=silver]&bull; [/color][color=whitesmoke][b]Revamped Exterior Fog[/b][/color] [color=silver]or other mods that push fog away - Do not use, I do fog, they overwrite everything I did, even when they&#39;re &#34;CoT compatible&#34;[/color]\r<br />[color=silver]&bull; [/color][color=whitesmoke][b]Real Rain[/b][/color] [color=silver]- Obviously, we both do rain[/color]\r<br />[color=silver]&bull; [/color][color=whitesmoke][b]Supreme and Volumetric Fog[/b][/color] [color=silver]- Load after patch and will overwrite CoTFog_1 to 6 (not _T) so you&#39;ll have a mix of both if you really need it but you will not have my colors in those conditions. Do not use with the Volumetric Fog Edition available here[/color]\r<br />[color=silver]&bull; [/color][color=whitesmoke][b]Dynavision[/b][/color] [color=silver]- Overwrites DoF effects added in Rainy, Foggy and Snowstorm weathers. Those effects will [b]not[/b] work for as long as Dynavision is active[/color]\r<br />[color=silver]&bull; [/color][color=whitesmoke][b]Real Clouds[/b][/color] [color=silver]- Overreacts to light color since it reacts to Particle (like smoke) when used together with ENB, results might be weird. It is also not very compatible with CoT&#39;s weather systems. There&#39;s no conflicts but use knowing it will not show the colors I give how they should be given.[/color]\r<br />[color=silver]&bull; [/color][color=whitesmoke][b]Real Shelter[/b][/color] [color=silver][b]update: the new Nexus release of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52612/?]Real Shelter[/url] comes with a compatibility version for the Weather Patch.[/b] [s]unconfirmed - just by author description - Real Shelter does it&#39;s tricks by changing image spaces, this works fine with the patched mod (CoT) but my mod changes, but most of all [u]adds[/u] new image spaces to support more variety. This could very well mean that these mods are not going to work properly with each other unless a patch is made to close the gap. However this mod is not listed on Nexus.[/s][/color]\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/JcksjxZ.png[/img]\r<br />[color=silver][b]HERE&#33;[/b] This is a mod that seriously needs some LOVE from everyone ...
