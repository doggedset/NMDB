  "descriptionHtml": "I wasn\\'t happy with the grey color of Nightingale armor, so I darkened the armor but not too dark that you can\\'t see the details. This re-tex includes both male and female.\r\n\r\n==New Version Notes==\r\nThe textures I uploaded previously turns out having saturation problem while in interiors. The new textures fix the problem and also come with matching gloves color and with red glowing eyes instead of blue.\r\n\r\n==Alternate Blue Glow Eyes==\r\nThe textures for people who want blue glow eyes are uploaded. REQUIRES MAIN FILES TO BE INSTALLED FIRST!\r\n\r\n==Darker Version==\r\nI have uploaded a darker version, as many suggest me to. But it\\'s MALE ONLY. Because, whatever I do the female armor doesn\\'t seems to change. On female, only the cape, gloves, and boots that could be changed. Therefore I decide not to upload it because it looks bad. If anyone knows how to fix this, please tell me on the comment section. Thanks. :)\r\n\r\n==Installation==\r\nExtract the textures folder to your .../Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod ever that I uploaded. You can modify this as much as you like and upload it anywhere. No need to give me credits. It won\\'t hurt though lol. It\\'s just a simple re-tex. :)\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nEnjoy.",
