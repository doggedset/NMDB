  "descriptionHtml": "Modification Name: Vivid Weathers - Distant Fog\n<br />Author: BlackerrR\n<br />Version: 1.0\n<br />Requirements:  -  [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73937]Vivid Weathers[/url]﻿\n<br />\n<br />This mod assumes that you already have Vivid Weathers installed\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966]Description:\n<br />[/color]\n<br />First of all, sorry for bad English.\n<br />Vivid Weathers is a fantastic mod, however many of new weathers added by it push distant fog far away so that we could have clear distant view, which would be fine if this wasn't Skyrim. Why? Because, in my opinion, Skyrim's LOD is ugly and 'removing' distant fog just ruins the whole atmosphere for me. That's why I decided to make my own very simple patch to bring the fog back, not as much as original Skyrim did, but keeping it as far away as it should be. For some reason, screenshots are of low quality, so I recommend that you try it instead since it can be easily removed from your load order.\n<br />\n<br />This edits were supposed to be made for my personal use, but after I saw how many records needed to be changed, I decided to create completely new plugin and share it on Nexus.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232]How to make LOD look better:\n<br />\n<br />[/color]- I [color=#e06666]HIGHLY(!!!)[/color] recommend [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88676/]Obsidian Mountain Fogs[/url]﻿ by Linnsanity. I use it and it goes perfectly with this mod. Not a single FPS drop (see the screenshots).\n<br />- Not needed, but [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59721/]dynDOLOD[/url]﻿ by Sheson. It might increase VRAM usage and drop FPS by a tiny bit, but nothing performance breaking, realy. Even with the lowest settings (like 64x64 textures, which I use) game looks much better than vanilla.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232]Incompatibility:\n<br />\n<br />[/color]- Don't use this mod with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9930]Revamped Exterior Fog[/url]﻿ by Greg Manthey - gargorias.\n<br />- Any mod that makes changes to weather records (obviously).\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232]Install:\n<br />\n<br />[/color]Copy .esp file from 7z archive to your Skyrim/Data folder and activate it with Skyrim Launcher or your favourite Mod Manager. Place it BELOW original Vivid Weathers.esp file. Wrye bash users can safely merge it in Bashed Patch to save extra .esp slot.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232]Uninstall:\n<br />\n<br />[/color]You can safely uninstall this mod anytime you want. Just delete Vivid Weathers - Distant Fog.esp from your Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232]Credits:\n<br />\n<br />[/color]All credits goes to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1632043]Mangaclub[/url]﻿ for creating [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73937]Vivid Weathers[/url]﻿, one of the best mods on Nexus.
