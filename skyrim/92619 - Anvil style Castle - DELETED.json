The report says that you're redistributing \n<br />Skyblivion assets. I have looked at your mod, and I know that it's only \n<br />an .esp, so it requires Skyblivion to work.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />I think it would be helpful if you added a note on your description page\n<br /> saying clearly that the mod requires Skyblivion to work. Hopefully, \n<br />that will put paid to anymore reports.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Thanks for your help on this.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />All the best,\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Jannifer\n<br />\n<br />Nexus Moderator\n<br />\"Most of our fears are tissue-paper thin, and a single bold step would carry us clear through them.\" ~ Brendan Behan\n<br />Â \n<br />Semper in lumine ambulamus, sed non timere tenebras.\"\"\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />AS IT IS CLEARLY STATED IN THE PRIOR STATEMENT BY A NEXUS MODERATOR THIS PLUGIN DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY OWNED ASSETS, AND AS I ALREADY MENTIONED IN THE PERMISSIONS SECTION SKYBLIVION IS NEEDED FOR THIS TO WORK.",
