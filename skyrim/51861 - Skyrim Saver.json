  "summary": "Application written C# to manage saved games for skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A simple application to manage different saved games in skyrim. The program initially copies all the save game files in &#34;My Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Saves&#34; to a new folder in that same directory called &#34;OldSaves&#34;, which you can then double click on in the window and rename. \r<br />You can then create, rename, and delete any saved game groups from there. \r<br />\r<br />The program edits your Skyrim.ini file to reflect whatever save folder you have chosen. The line that does this is the ONLY one that is changed. \r<br />\r<br />For security&#39;s sake, I&#39;m including the full source code with the program. You can tweak it as you see fit. \r<br />\r<br />The program is provided AS-IS. I don&#39;t plan on making any changes. I wrote this a few months back, and haven&#39;t been playing Skyrim lately. \r<br />\r<br />I have only tested this on my own machine, under Windows 8/8.1, x64 (however, it is compiled as 32-bit. No reason to make it x64). \r<br />\r<br />If you make any edits, please, only upload them to this website (The Nexus), and please credit me. ",
