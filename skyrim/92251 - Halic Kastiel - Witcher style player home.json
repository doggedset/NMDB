  "summary": "A house mod - Probably performance heavy. Focused on lighting",
  "descriptionHtml": "I wanted a house that was practical, beautiful, and great for taking screenshots.\n<br />But this turned into more than that...\n<br />\n<br />This unique house features:\n<br />Custom textures (I don't know how many... But there's a lot. Walls, floors, paintings, rugs, furniture, etc)\n<br />Custom books to read (The Witcher books! All imported for your leisure time within Skyrim)\n<br />'Functional' bathroom\n<br />Custom furniture\n<br />A ton of storage. Pretty much if it looks like you can store something in it, you can. No more pointless clutter! Well, not as much anyways.\n<br />Custom lighting\n<br />Custom crafting benches (as well as a custom cooking split!)\n<br />A fishing spot\n<br />Multiple gardening areas\n<br />Practical displays\n<br />[s]Undress markers[/s] (not yet, actually. I'm still figuring this out).\n<br />\n<br />And more!\n<br />\n<br />I've spent 2+ months working on this, but in reality more because I imported many of the assets about a year ago.\n<br />There are a lot of house mods for Skyrim... But a lot look the same, or are for aesthetics alone. And I really don't like how many have awkward display rooms kindof just thrown in. I've downloaded hundreds of houses, but none were to my liking for a main house, regardless of how much I liked them.\n<br />\n<br />This house is based around Celtic, Norse, &amp; The Witcher. It's similar to what you'd see in Solitude, but cozy &amp; warm. No more cold stone.Â \n<br />\n<br />Location:\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Credits:",
