  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][color=#ff0000][b]Finally someone with more skill than me take care of this texture. Instead of using my mod take [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/89294/?tab=files]Pfusher[/url]'s, it's ten times better.[/b][/color]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Jagged Crown, this little piece of armor hasn't been taken in consideration by anyone for years and now 2 mods in the same day?! \n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][b][size=3]Blah-blah-blah:[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />The fact is that, just yesterday, believe or not, I thought about making a retexture of it. It is not the best piece of equipment of Skyrim, not after all the amazing work of all the modders, but I always liked it. I also always thought he was too yellow.\n<br />Today browsing new mods I've seen Kredans retexture, I tried it and liked it. Unfortunately it's too small and he wrote he can't make a bigger version, so I took things into my hands.\n<br />After making my own work on his texture I noticed that Kedrans texture was 0.5K while I had a 1K texture in my folders (from the High Resolution texture pack), so, to obtain a better result, I took this 1K texture and applied to it my magic tricks and voil√† here's the result.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][b][size=3]Read this:[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />So, if you can afford 4K texture, I suggest you use mine, that are, by their own nature, more detailed. Otherwise use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84578/?]Kredan's excellent version[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Before I read some complaints I'd like to specify one thing. When I say this is a 4K retexture I mean that this textures are in compliance with what we agree to call 4K textures that is actually 4K for the chest armors and 2K for helmets, gauntelts and boots. So it is correct to name them 4K textures even if they are only 2K.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#0000ff][size=3]For Modders:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />I'd like also to make a suggestion to my fellow modders. If one of you who knows how to work with meshes would like to remove the helmet form this crown and make it a circlet it would be awesome! It would look better, more sexy and it'd became an actual crown, as name says.",
