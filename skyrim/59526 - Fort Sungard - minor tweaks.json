  "modName": "Fort Sungard - minor tweaks",
  "summary": "Fort Sungard now has a small gate and some other modifications. I felt that the fort had fallen in disrepair so for my bandit playthrough I wanted a cleaned up fort to set up camp in. This is what I came up with. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "First, I&#39;ve just been tweaking some walls and adding some towers and shelters. Most probably I&#39;ve made some really daft mistakes as this is my first steps at tweaking a game. \r<br />\r<br />At Fort Sungard: A shelter over the furnace seemed like a good thing. Also on top of the mess hall, I chose to put another shelter.\r<br />There was a path along the battlements ending in a dead end. I put a tower there, facing west. \r<br />\r<br />The pillar sky balcony now is built in and it&#39;s sheltered. No need to freeze if you don&#39;t have to.\r<br />\r<br />North of the well, there was a ruined part of the fort. I erected the walls and added a way to the east tower via a set of stone stairs.\r<br />\r<br />The oubliette now has a few minor changes. \r<br />\r<br />Thinking of all the iron ore findings in the mountain, it seems odd that no one decided the fort was worth holding as a mine faction at least. \r<br />My bandit will attempt that and set up a mining company somewhere close. Maybe at Serpent&#39;s Bluff. I already begun fixing the tower and the bad walls of  that poor place of a redoubt. Now it looks promising. Just need to show them savages on their way.\r<br />\r<br />I´ll be using Pocket Empire and Tundra Defense alongside Guild Starter to get my mining business going. \r<br />When I´ve earned a bit I´ll upgrade the fort to a better standard. \r<br />\r<br />Until then.\r<br />\r<br />May the seven be with you.\r<br />\r<br />/Dave",
