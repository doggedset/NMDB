They may be conflict with this mod.[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/569559aff1.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=2266DD][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/color][/size]\r\nThe purpose of this ENB is to keep maximum realism but stay playable, so, i try to reproduce what your eyes see everyday in real life.\r\n\r\nThat why I made this mod better in 1st person view, but i try to balanced every effects to be playable in 1st like in 3rd person view.\r\n\r\nThis is too dark at night? Yep, if you go into a forest at midnight with a cloudy sky, i suppose you\\'ll see absolutly nothing but the dark... Theres no point of lighting anywhere.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are in skyrim and it\\'s a game so i must made things a lil brigth to be playable, but not too much for keep realism.\r\nFor that, i played with many settings like brightness, lighting power, distant fog, contrast etc... to be balanced betwen each of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Areas without windows must never change their brightness level so it\\'s the same at night like at day.\r\nB. Fire and Light will always have the same brightness level so you can think they bright more at night but it\\'s a fake. Human eyes simulate a better dazzle when you look directly at them at night due to stronger constrat (dark/light) and continue to process when you look again into the dark.\r\nC. The slight gray effect which affect the whole game is here to simulate film grain and enhance HDR power, it give a better feeling of realism and minimum performance loss.\r\nD. Skyrim is not perfect, sometimes you could see some places with a wrong settings resulting on a absolutly too much dark cave or a fire camp which doesnt have any light radius. So it\\'s not my mod.\r\n\r\n[u]AT NIGHT[/u]\r\n1. Interiors with windows should be a little more bright than exterior at night (candles and lanterns + windows light)\r\n2. Interiors without windows should be exactly at the same brightness level than exterior at night. (only candles and lanterns will brighten more)\r\n2. Caves & Dungeons should be really dark for immersion and to force player taking a torch with him (role play)\r\n3. In Exterior, when no point of lighting around (forest), you should only see the nearest environment clearly (radius around you) and a little bit less in distance.\r\n4. In exterior, fire and torch must make the things a little more saturated and contrasted but not too much brigth at short distance. Only big light like Skyforge at Whiterun can greatly brighten nearest environment.\r\n4. In exterior, you shouldnt be able to see as far as day, darkness in distant view (dark moutains)\r\n\r\n[u]AT DAY[/u]\r\n1. Environment will not have the same brightness level depending on weather.\r\nEx: Sun will make the ground almost white at 2.00pm when clear sky but less when cloudy day.\r\nEx: Foggy day make everything blurry at distance and brighness level is lesser due to natural sun filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=2266DD][b]FEATURES[/b][/color][/size]\r\nNew ENB combined with and Realistic Lighting With Customization 3.4 provide Full optimized SSAO, Fast and Natural Bokeh DOF, Double Blur, Cinematic View, Film grain, Full HDR 6, Enhanced Sharpening, Soft Bloom for :\r\n- Realistic environment\r\n- Real dark nights & caves\r\n- Balanced color & contrast\r\n- Great sky and clouds\r\n- Amazing ambient\r\n- Realistic brightness\r\n\r\nAlternate Version is a bit different, with no more gray effect, 2 versions (Normal & Light) for HighEnd or MidRanged PC, optional plugins and less buggy.\r\nIf you want to know more, just try it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see the difference ingame, type:\r\n- Shift+F12 to disabled the entire mod\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center]\r\n[size=4][color=DD6622][b]CREDITS[/b][/color][/size]\r\n[url=http://enbdev.com]ENBSeries By Boris Vorontsov[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7654]Realistic Lighting by Plutoman101[/url]\r\nAll other ENB editor like SharpShooter for their great work\r\n\r\n[size=2][color=BB9933][u]Troubleshooting:[/u][/color][/size]\r\n[url=http://www.displaycalibration.com]Online Calibration Tutorial[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.tweakguides.com/Oblivion_1.html]Tweak Guide[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.canardpc.com/article-108-skyrim___tweaks_et_bidouilles.html]Another Tweak[/url]\r\n[url=http://segmentnext.com/2011/11/11/skyrim-crashes-freezes-sound-keys-errors-fps-lag-textures-and-fixes]Tips[/url]\r\nFreeze or CTD ?
