  "descriptionHtml": "[[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/51469]There will be no SE port of this mod. Read here for more information[/url]]\n<br />\n<br />A vampire becoming weaker as it feeds, and stronger as it starves, doesn't make any sense. This mod reverses that.\n<br />\n<br />There are a couple of other mods which do something similar to this, but they also make other changes which I don't care for.\n<br />\n<br />There is a Vanilla version for those without Dawnguard and a version for those with Dawnguard. Make certain you download and install the correct version or it will cause serious problems. Go to the Downloads tab and select your version. The loose files package contains both versions for manual install.\n<br />\n<br />Vampiric Drain:\n<br />Vampiric Drain becomes weaker as you progress from Stage One down to Stage Four. At Stage Four, it's hardly worth using. \n<br />\n<br />The Drain spells have been upgraded to be identical to the NPC vampire versions, which are considerably stronger than the default player versions. At Stage One, the base health absorption is 20 health per second (exact stats listed below). The Stage One and Two versions are affected by the Apprentice Destruction perk. The Stage Three and Four versions are affected by the Novice Destruction perk.\n<br />\n<br />The Drain spells used by NPC vampires are unchanged. They have their own version which they use.\n<br />\n<br />Vampiric Seduction:\n<br />No NPC will be too powerful for Vampiric Seduction. However, there are several NPCs and creatures that are immune to all Illusion spells, such as undead and Dwemer automatons (without Mastery of the Mind Illusion perk), mammoths, dragons and certain quest NPCs. The Calm effect lasts for 60 seconds (before perks or other modifiers). If you have Dawnguard, this means that you can use it on a follower and feed on them, regardless of their level and without having them sleep first.\n<br />\n<br />I had planned to make Vampiric Seduction a lesser power originally, but during testing I found myself abusing it constantly, so I changed it back to a greater power that's useable only once per day. \n<br />\n<br />Vampire Servant:\n<br />As you become weaker, your Vampire Servant power also becomes weaker and might not be able to reanimate more powerful creatures. At Stage One, it will reanimate NPCs or creatures up to level 30 (before any perks or other modifiers). At Stage One and Two, you can use this power as often as you like. If you are Stage Three or Four, you will only be able to use it once per day.\n<br />\n<br />Other:\n<br />Embrace of Shadows will work as often as you like, not just once per day. Now also includes the disappearing visual and audio effects of the Invisibility spell.\n<br />\n<br />Various messages shown after feeding or when progressing through stages have been changed.\n<br />\n<br />Frost and Fire resistances and health/magicka/stamina weaknesses have not been changed, since I think they were balanced well enough to begin with.\n<br />\n<br />The Dawnguard version makes no changes to Vampire Lord powers or abilities. Only the lesser vampire powers have been changed.\n<br />\n<br />All Stages:\n<br />Access to Vampire Seduction, Vampire Servant and Embrace of Shadows.\n<br />\n<br />Stage 1:\n<br />Can use Embrace of Shadows and Vampire Servant as often as you like. \n<br />Can use Vampire Seduction only once per day.\n<br />Vampire Drain: Absorbs 20 health per second, costs 40 magicka.\n<br />Apprentice Destruction perk reduces magicka cost.\n<br />\n<br />Stage 2:\n<br />Can use Embrace of Shadows and Vampire Servant as often as you like. \n<br />Can use Vampire Seduction only once per day.\n<br />Vampire Drain: Absorbs 15 health per second, costs 29 magicka.\n<br />Apprentice Destruction perk reduces magicka cost.\n<br />\n<br />Stage 3:\n<br />Can use Embrace of Shadows as often as you like. \n<br />Can use Vampire Seduction and Vampire Servant only once per day.\n<br />Vampire Drain: Aborbs 12 health per second, costs 23 magicka.\n<br />Novice Destruction perk reduces magicka cost.\n<br />\n<br />Stage 4:\n<br />Can use Embrace of Shadows as often as you like. \n<br />Can use Vampire Seduction and Vampire Servant only once per day.\n<br />Vampire Drain: Absorbs 10 health per second, costs 18 magicka.\n<br />Novice Destruction perk reduces magicka cost.\n<br />\n<br />I played one full game through the Dawnguard, Mage's Guild and Dark Brotherhood quest lines with this mod on Master difficulty and it worked very well. On lower difficulty, the drain spells might be a little overpowered, but I didn't test that.\n<br />\n<br />Known Issues:\n<br />Going from one stage to another will remove Vampiric Drain and Vampire Servant from your favorites list. This is a problem with the script that adds and removes these spells and powers based on your current stage and it happens with or without this mod. It's pretty annoying, but it can't really be helped. \n<br />\n<br />Highly recommend mods for vampire players. All are compatible with this mod:\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21631]Vampire Lords can Loot and Activate[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22132]Vampire Lord Collision Fix[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22274]Predator Vision[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29922]Serana SHUT UP[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28023]Real Royal Vampire Armor by Den987[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28200]Darker vampire eyes[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23999]Dawnguard Vampiric Drain Fix[/url] (An older version of this mod conflicted but the current version is perfectly compatible now)",
