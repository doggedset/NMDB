  "summary": "My first mod -  a simple sword with a custom texture and enchantment",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first Skyrim mod (that works anyway). Quite simply, it adds in a custom-textured unique one-handed sword. The sword has high base damage (should be equal to a Daedric sword), has an infinite health absorb enchantment, and is temperable (but does not benefit from any smithing perk). It is in the Midden, in the second large chamber. If it cannot be found, you can use &#34;help sostafiir&#34; and then &#34;player.additem [Sostafiir&#39;s code]&#34;. \r<br />\r<br />Please send in reviews regarding its function, especially if something doesn&#39;t work right. At the moment, the only known glitch is that it sits too high in weapon racks. Sostafiir may appear to glow or look very dark, but this is not a glitch. \r<br />\r<br />The name Sostafiir translates to &#34;Bloodthief&#34; in dragon language.\r<br />\r<br />[[[NOTE]]]\r<br />I have an update almost completed for this mod.  It will fix the shadow bug, hopefully (the problem was a glitched Normal map), add a dungeon containing the sword (and maybe some other rewards), and add some decoration to the sword.",
