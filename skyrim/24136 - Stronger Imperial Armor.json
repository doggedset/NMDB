  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple mod that increases the armor rating for all Imperial Armor found within the game.  It always bothered me that one of the most well funded military forces in all of Tamriel would have lower rated armor then what the player could find in most shops right at the start of the game.  With this mod, the light Imperial Armor will have an armor rating similar to that of Elven Armor.  The heavy Imperial Armor will have an armor rating similar to that of Dwarven Armor.  I didn\\'t want to make the armor rating too high, otherwise it would make the game seem unbalanced (considering you can get Imperial Armor at Helgan).  \r\n\r\nI will be working on a mod that does something similar for the Stormcloak Armor (as well as the various Guards Armors).  \r\n\r\nTo install, simply drag the file included here into you Skyrim\\'s data folder or use the Nexus Mod Manager.  \r\n\r\nSubmit all questions here or e-mail me at carbon.andrew@gmail.com.
