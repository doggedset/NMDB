I have been told there is a sort of quest to go there and fight bad mages n stuff&#33; Sounds fun but I was more concerned with making crystals. \r<br />\r<br />I did not really like the vanilla concept... So I made my own. I have provided shots with and without ENB in the image section&#33; Do note that how it will look with ENB depends on the preset&#33; The images here are made with Skylight ENB. \r<br />\r<br />If you want to see how they look with your game quickly then from the main menu open the console and type \r<br />coc azurasstarinterior01 \r<br />\r<br />This will bring you right on in for quick testing. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Installation:  [/size]\r<br />It is simple textures and meshes use your mod manager to install and remove like normal. Folder structure should be correct&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Credits: \r<br />Bethesda for the game and all the goodies to play with&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Permissions: \r<br />If you want to use these assets in your own mod, please ask me first&#33; I will most likely agree it is the best idea since sliced bread&#33; \r<br />I do not give permission for these assets to be redistributed to other sites then the Nexus. \r<br />",
