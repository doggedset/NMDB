It is found in the innermost chamber of the Twilight Sepulcher (the room in which you return the Skeleton Key to Nocturnal, and choose a Nightingale skill). THIS MOD WAS NOT CREATED BY ME. it is merely a mesh/texture fix so that the cowl\\'s color is correct. The original mod by Nephilim722 can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15242//?\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease support the original mod as well. :)",
