  "summary": "Simple tweak to Derkeethus to make him look cooler as well as removing his level cap.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Very simple mod where I went ahead and edited how Derkeethus, the only male Argonian companion in Vanilla Skryim (and all of the current DLC, for that matter), looks.  I also removed the level 30 cap on him so he will level with the player until they cap out.\r\n\r\nThe tweak to his appearance is super simple and just my personal preference, but uncapping his level from 30 is handy for anyone who is playing a lonely Argonian.\r\n\r\nAfter I finished this I ran across Wolfkin\\'s mod, http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27932, highly reccomend checking that out.  This is still good for a simple no-thinking-needed alternative.",
