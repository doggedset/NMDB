  "descriptionHtml": "[b]- Orc Warrior 1H Block Sneak Archery\r\n- made Essential\r\n- Crime: Violence vs. enemies\r\n- can be married\r\n- Auto-level up[/b] (normally...)\r\n\r\n[url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Borgakh_the_Steel_Heart]TES WIKI Page[/url] about the vanilla NPC, so you can compare and have further background infos.\r\n\r\nBorgakh is a very useful follower, easy to get and the perfect bride for an Orc player... or if you\\'re into green women with fangs.\r\nAnyway. I wanted to make her prettier and less scary without losing her toughness. She\\'s still that badass warrior but without the dirt, the pigface, the oversized chin & all. Just sexier.\r\n\r\nI also [b]added relevant perks & boosted a bit her speed & energy[/b], but unlike other mods I remained close to the original character, i.e. a cunning warrior that can shoot, slash, block and sneak even with a heavy gear, and who never complains or retreat.\r\n\r\nNow she can [b][color=red]Bash[/color][/b] properly, make a [b][color=red]Powershot[/color][/b] with her bow, and is way better with a sword ([b][color=red]Bladesman 2[/color][/b])... and other skills like [color=red]basic sneaking perks[/color] (lvl.1) or [b][color=red]Savage Strike[/color][/b] - very orcish indeed. These mods were not only made to strenghten Borgakh, but mainly to reinforce her specific traits and fighting style.\r\n\r\nThat being said, a great thanks to BETHESDA (of course) and to the creators of these mods:\r\n\r\n[b]RECOMMENDED[/b] - for the looks only. Not needed if you just want slightly improved perks & stats.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii SkyHair[/url] - who doesn\\'t have it already? Come on!\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812]Better Females[/url] by Bella, another classic.\r\n\r\nBorgakh will not look exactly like the pictures i took without these mods. I didn\\'t include their orcish female face textures/meshes but if you insist I will ask 4 their permission.\r\n\r\n[b]OPTIONAL[/b]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722]The Eyes of Beauty[/url] by LogRaam\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]Dimonized UNP Body[/url] by Dimon99\r\n\r\nI did that mod while using that body mod as a player, but any other body should work fine. Let me know in comments.\r\n\r\n[b]INSTALL:[/b]\r\n\r\n- Download manually (I know, I don\\'t use NMM)\r\n- Unzip with Winrar\r\n- Copy into your Skyrim/Data folder\r\n\r\n[b]UNINSTALL:[/b]\r\n\r\nJust remove the files!\r\n\r\nGREY FACE BUG TIP: as with any other Follower mod, there can be a \\\"grey face\\\" bug due to the CK. It shouldn\\'t occur now, but if It does, open the .esp with the CK, select Borgakh on the Actors tab and press Ctrl+F4. it will (re)create the needed meshes & textures.\r\nNormally you won\\'t have to, because I already included those files, but with the buggy CK, who knows? ^^\r\n\r\nFEEDBACK is always appreciated on the Comments section, as well as thoughful suggestions (ex: change warpaints? mix?) but no Trolling please.\r\n\r\n[b]OPTIONAL FILE ADDED:[/b] French Version - Version fran√ßaise.\r\n\r\n[url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Borgakh_the_Steel_Heart]TES WIKI Page[/url] about the vanilla NPC, so you can compare and have further background infos.",
