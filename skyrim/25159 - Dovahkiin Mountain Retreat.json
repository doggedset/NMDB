  "descriptionHtml": "You have inherited Dovahkiin Mountain Retreat; overlooking the major city of Riften.\r\n\r\nThis is a unique custom house containing all the amenities a Dragonborn could ask for. Compact, 3-level design makes everything easily accessible.\r\n\r\nThe house comes complete with 2 Dovahkiin Guards (followers) - Nina, a Nord specializing in one-handed sword and archery and Jorgen, a Redguard Spellsword.\r\n\r\nSmithing (forge, anvil, sharpening wheel, armor workbench) , Enchanting and Alchemy equipment are included.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is a large armory with Mannequins, shield and weapon racks, a separate library, a room for the Guards, greenhouse herb garden, stables and horses, and of course ample storage throughout.\r\n\r\nMajor features:\r\n\r\n• Full Smithing equipment located on upstairs patio and also at rear of the house\r\n• Ore Mines next to house: Gold, Malachite, Moonstone, Quicksilver\r\n• Mannequins for placing armor: 20 in the armory and 1 in upstairs bedroom\r\n• Shield racks: 11 in the armory and 1 in upstairs bedroom\r\n• Weapon racks: 18 in armory and 1 in upstairs bedroom\r\n• Alchemy and Enchanting labs\r\n• Large Weapon cases: 3\r\n• Dagger cases: 5\r\n• Bookshelves: 6 large and 1 small\r\n• Large armory in basement\r\n• Plenty of storage throughout\r\n• Dovahkiin Guard Followers Nina (one-handed and archery) and Jorgen (SpellSword)\r\n• Guard room\r\n• Bedroom\r\n• Kitchen\r\n• Civil War map\r\n• Separate Library downstairs\r\n• Light armor (Elven) modified Nightingale design.

When dismounted near the house/stables (within approx 200 ft) these horses will return to their stable. When stabled, they will no longer fast-travel with player (no other horses act this way). Both horses have more health and stamina than regular horses (similar to Frost), but less than Shadowmere.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nYou can replace the wall paintings with your own images If you know how to edit .dds files which reside in directory: skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\architecture\\\\osr\r\n\r\nInstallation is automatic. You will receive a Quest message and marker instructing you to visit the mountain home you have inherited.\r\n\r\nThis house does not directly support marriage partner habitation, but It does support companion/follower habitation. \r\n\r\nFully compatible with my other Workshop mods:\r\n\r\n- Dragon Weapon and Shield Set (not needed with this mod because already included)\r\n- Bound Dragonslayer Weapons\r\n- Aegis Shield Ward\r\n- Advanced Detect Life\r\n- Airstream Levitation\r\n- Smeltdown convert items to ingots\r\n\r\nNOTE: Not compatible with my Dovahkiin Riverwood Sanctuary mod on Syrim Nexus (no longer available)\r\n\r\nThanks!",
