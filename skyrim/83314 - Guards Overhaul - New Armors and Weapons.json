  "descriptionHtml": "[b][center][size=6]GUARDS \r<br />ARMOR AND WEAPONS\r<br />[/size][/center][/b]\r<br />[center]Probably to save money and time Bethesda decided to make all guards look all the same and just change their color depending on the city they are protecting. To fix this problem I found armors and weapons from Nexus and combine them in to one Guards mod (got permission from all authors more about it down below). They all have backstories , reasons why they use such armor and weapon style. Now this backstories are all made by me, something  like fan fiction or something, but I did made logic why they use what they use. These are Skyrim’s new guards.[/center]\r<br />[center][size=5]Guards[/size][/center]\r<br />[left]Solitude\r<br />The capital city of both Haffingar Hold and all of Skyrim , Solitude is  probably the richest city out of all nine cites and it is the headquarters to Imperoal Legion. Guards of such important and rich city should wear something fancy. Trained by captain Aldis they are honorable knights, wearing the colors of their home with pride and wielding large two handed sword that can cut through almost anything.[/left]\r<br />\r<br />[left]Markarth\r<br />In the city originally build by dwarves, guards rely on the strength of their walls and so they rely on strength of their own. They build armors by using what was left of dwarven metal and use dwarven weapons found in the city. Their armor is strong and can take a lot of damage. They are trained to use dwarven hammers and with those they can smash thru any foe.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Dawnstar\r<br />During the 4th era Dawnstar’s citizens were suffering from nightmares. Fearing that the source of nightmares is unnatural, like deadra or undead guards took silver swords and silver shields so they can deal with enemy if they find it. Even though their gear is primarily for undead there still able to defend the city against almost anything.\r<br />\r<br />Morthal\r<br />Morthal is the only city that is not build on the main roads of Skyrim. They don’t have strong walls so their best defense are guards of the city .Clan Axe-Bearer lived in the city for many years and they taught guards some of their skills and so guards weapon of choice for generations are axes.[/left]\r<br />\r<br />Whiterun   \r<br />Also known as heart of Skyrim. In the 4th era civil war rages Skyrim and Whiterun is the only city that did not choose side. Knowing that both Imperials and Sormcloaks are waiting for right chance to take the city Jarl Balgruuf the Greater decided to prepare his man for war and gave the order to make new gear for his man. Whiterun has the advantage of heaving Eorlund Gray-Mane as smith, he provided guards with light ebony armor and large ebony shields. He also provided them with his own craft - Skyforge steel swords, lot stronger than regular steel weapon. (to make the choice  of ebony make more sense I recommend mod Ebonvale Settlement).\r<br />\r<br />Falkreath\r<br />Falkreath is not the most interesting place in Skyrim. The city is most known for its graveyard. The guards of Falktreah are badly equipped. Heaving a lazy and narcissistic Jarl does not help either since he was carless enough to not provide them with new gear. Guards are left with weak armor , small shield and Iron weapons. Unfortunately for them they are by far the weakest guards in Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Winterhold\r<br />WInterhold is coldest city in Skyrim. Guards of Winterhold need outfits that can keep them worm. Their armor is covered in cloth and fur so they can to handle extreme cold weather. After the destruction that happened to the city Jarl forced college to help with defense. College provided guards with enchanted swords that freeze their enemies.\r<br />\r<br />Windhelm\r<br />Standing against the Empire are Stormcloaks and their home Windhelm. People of Windhelm are proud Nords and so are their guards. Their armor is designed to honor the original empire – one build by Tiber Septim and their weapon is replica of Wuuthrad, battleaxe used by Nord hero Ysgramor. Forged by Oengul War-Anvil and enchanted by Wuunferth the Unliving , it’s not strong as the original but it still provides extra damage to elves.\r<br />\r<br />Riften\r<br />Unlike the other cities guards of Riften prefer ranged weapons. They use bows and arrows, they are also carrying small dagger. Their armor is light , sacrificing durability for mobility keeping the distance and taking down their enemies from a far. Their bows are extrimly powerful. It can kill regular soldier with only few shots and sometimes even one shot is all it takes, but it is also slower to fire than regular bows.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][center][b]Compatibility[/b][/center][/size]\r<br />[center]Any mod that changes guards Armor is not going to be compatible.\r<br />All armors and weapons are renamed.\r<br />I removed recepies for crafting armors and weapons that are used by guards. You can still improve them.You will need original mods if you wish to craft armors .I tested compatibility with Resplended Armor and it worked fine. I did not test this with any other armors used in this mod (But it should work fine).[/center]\r<br />\r<br />Special Thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/25841670]DigitalRot[/url] for new ScreenShots and showing how can you combine this mod with others to get some amazing resaults.\r<br />[img]https://s30.postimg.org/q7kmhb6k1/Comp2.png[/img]\r<br />[center][size=5]Video by Jindo Skyrim[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]SSXvAraA8ww[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]Plans for the future[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]I plan to add modular version so you can download only the armors that you want to. Also I plan to expand armors to Imperial and Stormcloak guards (for each city). Also if anyone is interested I could use some help with textures. If anyone is interested to help me with this please send me the message.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Installation[/size][/center][center][/center]\r<br />[center]The only thing that is important to mention is to don’t forget to extract mash folder from rar file. If you don&#39;t HDT on Solitude guards will not work.\r<br />\r<br />[b][/b][/center][center][size=5][b]Recommendation\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/size]I recommend that you install Guards Dialoge Overhaul and Suspicious City Guards, just make sure that this mod is loaded after these two in your load order. Also I recommend Holds City overhaul (this one has nothing to do with guards but it changes desine of cities and new armors are going to fit perfectly)[/center][center][b][/b][/center][size=5][b][center]\r<br />Credits[/center][/b][/size]\r<br />[center]I want to thank all the Authors who gave me permission to use their assets to make this mod.\r<br />\r<br />maty743 : Talos Housecarl Armor\r<br />Madcat221 : Robed Steel Plate Armors\r<br />Azraille  : Dark Souls - Elite Knight\r<br />sarcasticshark : Resplendent Armor and Greatsword\r<br />newermind43 : Boots and Gauntlets for Resplended Armor\r<br />JayMercer : Helmet for Resplended Armor\r<br />singlebelong : skirt for Resplended Armor with HDT physics.\r<br />TheMedievalsKnights : Raubritter armor\r<br />billyro : Stalwart Axe\r<br />taro8 : Guard replacment armor\r<br />Actus Reus : for Credo WIP modders resource (Dark Coat of Plate Armor, Northman armor and helmet from NorthmanKnight)\r<br />TheMalfazar : B.D.Y.E.B - Crusade Shield (clean) , Old Knight Shield\r<br />Doodaboom : Scout Armor and Weapons ( Scout armor uses the cape which a had to remove since I could not get in contact with creator of the cape).\r<br />nivea : for help with some textures\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Also I want to thank all the Author who gave me permission to use their assets that I did not ended up using.[/center]",
