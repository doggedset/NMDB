  "descriptionHtml": "   A long time ago a rejected Jester confined himself inside an old tower to live out his days alone. As years passed his resentment grew and he plotted revenge. He created a Enchanted staff to teach his foes a lesson but grew too old to do so. He remains to this day in his  Jesters Recluse  along with the unused magic staff.  Maybe you can claim it as your own. Also his hat and outfit.  Beware his minions.  His tower recluse is east of Ivarstead near the water.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE...Removed duplicate staff in Riverwood and fixed tower door. Just overwrite ESP file....\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Do not upload elsewhere or use assets without permission please, thanks.",
