  "descriptionHtml": "so where to begin my pc died 2 months ago so i lost everything i was working on since the last update of this and my pc dying. but after coming back and seeing how many seem to love this . when my pc is fixed. dunno when that will be, i will remake the mod with everything more refined to the core instead of trying to do everything at once. dungeons i was working on will be removed and all the extra stuff will be removed to. \r<br />\r<br />this modual will be concentrating on the things already there. so basically buying things for the children in base game. then i will do the rest if i feel like it so most likely the imperfect ingots and that stuff will also be removed i may make the moduals all seperate to allow mix and match.\r<br />\r<br />so heres what they will be when i finally get back to it\r<br />Children Overhaul Lillian Modual\r<br />Children Overhaul Sissel / Britte Modual\r<br />Children Overhaul Adara Modual\r<br />Children Overhaul Svari Modual\r<br />Children Overhaul Agni Modual\r<br />Children Overhaul Eirid Modual\r<br />Children Overhaul Braith\r<br />Children Overhaul Extra Children Modual \r<br />\r<br />if i can figure out how ai packages work some may get their own house but wow they are complicated took me ages to get svari&#39;s quest working x.x who knows if i will remember how to do the buying things. i hope it comes back to me fingers crossed. first its working out the major irl problems though but soon we will have wonderful children i hope.\r<br />\r<br /> ps am not even gonna bother trying to change their bodies and what not god that frustrated me to no end bright heads dark bodies -.- but i still have permissions for some armors i was gonna use at least and weapons\r<br />\r<br />the reason for making them modual is that way if i find my future things failing the moduals will be a finished mod without the unfinished rubish bolted on the side and unfinished modual can simply be removed / dissabled\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />if you have come from the steam version to get the update just drag and drop the bsa and esp into the data folder. just as simple as pressing subscribe\r<br />\r<br />i would also like to know if people are ok with requirement mods. at the moment i try to get permission for most however if more people are ok with requirements it would make things much easier. and as you know this mod already requires higher magic children. \r<br />\r<br />i could do with serious FEEDBACK on this version. mainly to do with price of the upgrades for the kids. theres a few cheap ones but the room upgrades are designed to be end game they cost 100,000 gold. if this is way to steep for them then some recomended prices would be nice. also note that options only appear if you have the right amount of gold. you may need to save and load to make dialogues appear. i may limit eriths pure ingots to level 30-50 since they may be to OP that early for value\r<br />\r<br />if i get no feedback between now and the next release i will assume the prices are ok for end game people or that people are happy with them. eirids enchanting table will need to be bought in the next update and all the item creators and whatnot will be 150,000gold\r<br />\r<br />toybox (2,500)\r<br />teddybear(5,000)\r<br />new bed (10,000)\r<br />suprise option (10,000) [spoiler] at bottom [/spoiler] only svari and agni have this\r<br />room upgrade (100,000)\r<br />\r<br />For Adara all in 1 room upgrade (150,000) will be 300,000 posibly 200,000\r<br />For Dorthe secret blacksmith  needs room upgrade(150,000) may be increased to 300,000\r<br />Dorthe already has a teddybear\r<br />\r<br />beta female characters only be adopted by mila or braith. the note is right next to mila&#39;s house\r<br />to be adopted by mila you need (100,000)\r<br />to be adopted by braith you need her room upgrade and then just 10,000. so far all it does is add their house faction to your player.\r<br />\r<br />2.0\r<br />Svari&#39;s Room redesigned. you can pay Svari to have her upgrade her room\r<br />Eirid&#39;s Room redesigned. you can pay Eirid to have her upgrade her room\r<br />Agni&#39;s Room redisigned. you can pay Agni to have her upgrade her room\r<br />Adara&#39;s Room redesigned. you can pay Adara to have her upgrade her room\r<br />Braiths Room - you can pay Braith to have her upgrade her room\r<br />Dorthe&#39;s Room - you can pay Dorthe to have her upgrade her room\r<br />Aetheria&#39;s House in game\r<br />Lillian is in armor however she is like paper. i guess this conters the fact that she is set to essential\r<br />A surprise dialogue option for some of the kids not shown in the trailer :)\r<br />\r<br />Aetheria&#39;s House is in game\r<br />\r<br />This version adds children to the following places\r<br />Solitude\r<br />\r<br />Mersea\r<br />Skyre\r<br />Prina\r<br />Lillian\r<br />\r<br />Mersea, Skyre and Prina run around solitude and they sleep near the hall of the dead. If people want i could move them to their own place like an orphanage\r<br />\r<br />Lillian is her own more advanced package. She is also a follower with full follower voice for all but 2 things. any armor you give her will be more like paper it seems. her dress is enchanted to give her 10,000 health like all the kids. but i have seen her go down to a giant\r<br />\r<br />Markarth\r<br />Serlene\r<br />Sarond\r<br />they both stay in the warrens and run arround Markarth during the day. they are both also adoptable.\r<br />\r<br />Falkreath\r<br />Riri\r<br />Risrim\r<br />Riari\r<br />Ryari\r<br />\r<br />All 4 sleep in tents wich are near the graveyard and they will run around during the day. i need to expand the running markers slightly\r<br />\r<br />Ivarstead\r<br />Sphella\r<br />Skyler\r<br />\r<br />they both sleep near the inn and run up and down the path\r<br />\r<br />Shors Stone\r<br />Tanette\r<br />she sleeps in a tent and sits next to the fire\r<br />\r<br />Mage College\r<br />Aretla\r<br />\r<br />She will simply sit on the chair in the players room in hall of attainment and sleep on the rug next to the bed. need to make her involved in the quest eventually.\r<br />\r<br />Future Plans\r<br />Item System set up \r<br />- currently hrefna and erith are partially set up gold, silver, ebony and iron ingots but thats about it. i decided to concentrate on the rooms instead. Each child will have something unique to them weather it&#39;s food or misc. _____/____this will slowly make its way in hopefully as a modual with the one below. \r<br />\r<br />Armors / clothes / weapons for them \r<br />- waiting on permission for some of them\r<br />the ones i have permission for i will put here now. also note that these armors will be enabled for the child race only and dissabled for the rest also masks/hoods/open helmets are removed since they dont really fit children. so you will need to download the originals for the older races.\r<br />\r<br />Blood Witch Armor \r<br />by Zerofrost Satyr\r<br />\r<br />using since 2.0\r<br />Raven witch armor \r<br />by Zerofrost Satyr\r<br />\r<br />using since 2.0\r<br />Dovahkinder Collection\r<br />by jacknifelee\r<br />\r<br />item system\r<br />kids will have unique items to craft like secretly made things. all these will be slightly better than vanilla game but obviously take more of a requirement. i think the big one will be buying the kid the crafting stations in the first place requiring quite a bit of gold. ___/__ this base may be layed down in the modual so a modual to plug into a modual the base might have to be put into the base modual am thinking but am gonna get so confused lets just see how it goes\r<br />\r<br />Revive Helgi\r<br />A part of this is set up in 1.9.5 but will be disabled in 2.0 i may end up working on this next. aetheria may still show dialogue in 2.0 however no scripts are attached ___/___ who knows this might be added back sadly i lost this with the pc dying sigh maybe i could get back to this stage\r<br />\r<br />Crimson Child\r<br />once its at this stage this will be the town and dungeons. i will start working on this at a much later date. this is what i am currently working on\r<br />\r<br />Be Adopted. \r<br />although the base is down in 1.9.5 mila can adopt you and you become part of the family it needs major work. and will mainly be designed to run along side stall setup and be end game option if you dont ant to move onto crimson legacy. however this may be added in after crimson legacy.\r<br />\r<br />Crimson Legacy\r<br />at this stage am not sure if some would call it lore breaking or not but this will purely be end game stuff by that it will be all main quests done. dragonborn main, mage, theif, dark brotherhood and my mods crimson child. what i plan on doing at this stage would be huge and niether do i expect it to go smoothly really. think little lamplight but skyrim size.\r<br />\r<br />finally if you have any idea&#39;s for the children send me a message or post a comment i can arange it into a list if i like it.\r<br />\r<br />[spoiler] Pets (10,000) svari has a fox agni has a wraith [/spoiler]",
