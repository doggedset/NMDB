  "descriptionHtml": "Like in Oblivion, where you would get stuck in a jail cell with Valen Dreth, and if you were using a custom race, you would be stuck forever, they DID IT AGAIN!!!\r\n\r\nThis allows you to continue the quest, even if your race isn\\'t what would be in the base race list. You should still be able to select \\\"Yes?\\\" ... and continue. \r\n\r\nNote : Yes, sometimes you will have 2 options asking \\\"Yes?\\\" to her. First will be a default option. The Second will be THIS option. Both will continue the quest line.  ",
