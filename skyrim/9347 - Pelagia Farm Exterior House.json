  "summary": "UPDATE 18/2/12\r\n\r\nAn exterior home located on Pelagia Farmstead, just south of Whiterun.\r\n\r\nPart of my Alternate Start and Roleplaying addition to the game...\r\nBeing a prisoner seems way overused!\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE - 18/2/12\r\nOnce again rebuilt. \r\n*House has windows\r\n*Working Bookshelf\r\n*Weapon Plaques\r\n*Blacksmith Area\r\n*Mannequin\r\n*Roof Area\r\n\r\nMore stuff to be added - My character finds Alchemy and Enchanting basically USELESS so there is nothing there to do so (Only a short walk to Whiterun), and I am not a fan of houses that have EVERYTHING you need, when the world is a great place to walk and explore.\r\nComments and Feedback please!\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE - 14/2/12\r\nNavmeshed fully - Characters still occasionally try to walk through walls\r\nJackson - NPC with fully working schedule\r\n\r\nNOTE: The following video contains a bug that totally breaks any future of this mod having a quest added... Follower NPCs (and Jackson) DO NOT want to go near the modified area after changing cells (or fast travelling) a few times...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theengineeringguild.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=362:the-skyrim-navmesh-bug&catid=7:guild-news&Itemid=101\r\n\r\nJackson is located within the house, he will sleep, though due to the bug he will not follow any routines - This Bug (reported many times apparently by the accent in the video) totally DESTROYS any AI element I planned to add to this mod. Next update will be too V 1.0\r\n\r\nUPDATES in V 1.0\r\nGaps eliminated in walls and doors\r\nRoof completed\r\nNPCs wont walk through walls (Though NPC interaction wont be anywhere near what was planned due to aformentioned bug)\r\nMore stuff - Chests, Blacksmith etc\r\nANY SUGGESTIONS?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG:\r\n\r\n0.2\r\nHouse rebuilt from ground up\r\nFully Navmeshed and Used by NPCs (before \\\"Changing Cells\\\" bug\r\n\r\nAs of version 0.1 - House contains \r\n*a non respawning chest\r\n*3 Beds (1 owned by included NPC - Jackson)\r\n*1 Window so far (Using a door as I did not find opening glass)\r\n*Woodchopping block and Blacksmith station at rear of house\r\n*Cooking pots and fire at house front.\r\n*Dragons land on the house and attack\r\n\r\n\r\n(POSSIBLE SPOILER ON WHITERUN)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThough, I noticed that the attack on Whiterun includes this area, though any of the current placements do not seem to interfere, I have not personally reached that stage of the game (I can\\'t bring myself to take ANY sides) so the impact it has I have no idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Known Bugs -\r\n*Jackson insults the Player in a Daedric-esq voice (I dont know how this happened)\r\n*NPCs will NOT follow into the house, or open its doors (Mercurio does follow me in, though Lucien LaChance will run around the house\r\n*Overlapping textures\r\n\r\n",
