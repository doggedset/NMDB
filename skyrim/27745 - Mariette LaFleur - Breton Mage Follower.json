At least that&#39;s what I think anyway. If anyone is having trouble finding her, she moves around from the Hall of Attainment, to the Arcanaeum, to the Hall of The Elements, and Back to her room area. In the evening on Loredas you might find her at the Frozen Hearth in Winterhold. She isn&#39;t marriageable because she is a mage and has important mage things to do instead of tending to your laundry.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod ever, so please let me know what you think. ^-^\r<br />\r<br />Location\r<br />========\r<br />College Of Winterhold\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues or Bugs\r<br />====================\r<br />None (That I know of...)\r<br />\r<br />Contact\r<br />=======\r<br />I guess you can send me a message on TESNexus.\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />=======\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r<br />Thanks to my dog Rosco. \r<br />Thanks to my friend Endeavour for annoying me to try out the Creation Kit.",
