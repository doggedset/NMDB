  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes food more effective than vanilla skyrim.\r<br />This is not hardcore nor survival mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Details[/b]\r<br />-Cooked foods provide health, stamina or magicka regeneration.\r<br />\r<br />-You cannot eat raw food except apples and tomatos.\r<br />\r<br />-Magnitude of regeneration effect is always 25%.\r<br />\r<br />-Duration of the effect depends on the food&#39;s weight; most food effect lasts 30 minutes, but the effect of any foods heavier than 1 lasts 45 minutes. Also there are other exceptions; apples and tomatos&#39; effects last only 15 minutes.\r<br />\r<br />-Meat, cheese and fish dishes provide health regeneration. Fruits and sweets provide magicka regeneration. Vegetables and Breads provide stamina regeneration.\r<br />\r<br />-You can have health, magicka and stamina regeneration effects at the same time. But same effect does not stack. So eating same dishes gives you only 25% regeneration, not 50%.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirement[/b]\r<br />All Official DLC",
