  "modName": "The Retro Project Music and General UI Sound FX",
  "summary": "Replaces the sweeping orchestrated score with midi versions of various old school console games, mostly RPGs. Also replaces the basic UI sound effects with similar old school effects. Intended to work with the Retro Project Mod, but can stand on its own. ",
  "descriptionHtml": " ~Attention~\r\nI just got an E-Mail from the person whos midis I REALLY wanted, so this mod is gonna get reworked a bit soon. And it will FINALLY have Phantasy Star music as well. :)\r\n While working on the Retro Project, I realized that if we\\'re going to make it look all pixelly and old schoolish, it might as well sound that way too. After finding out that the Nexus doesnt take the actual old school tunes, I decided to revisit an old (OLD) favorite site of mine: VGMusic.com. The site that\\'s been around for as long as I have been on the Internet. XD\r\n I mailed a bunch of Artists of the midis and the result is what you see in the downloads section. A total of 324 midis were gathered for this project, as variety is the spice of life. Sadly, I had to leave behind a crap load of other midis whose artists seem to have abandoned them, leaving them to fend for themselves on the mean streets of the Interweb.. :(\r\n Anyway, the full credits are in the READ ME. Each Pack comes with a list of what tunes replace what. All these tunes are used with permission. They also sound a bit different than the midi originals as I had to convert them to WAV and then into XWM. \r\n I want to thank all the dudes who mailed me back and gave permission. My only regret is the noticeable (to me) lack of Phantasy Star tunes. Also in the \\\"explore\\\" folder there are alot of \\\"palette\\\" folders that would have sounded awful if I tried to replace them, so they are unchanged. Doesn\\'t really affect the mod as a whole, though.\r\n\r\nAll \\\"Expansion Packs\\\" are up. If you don\\'t like the initial music choice in the Main File, feel free to replace the four big categories: Dungeon, Explore, Towns, and Combat.\r\n\r\nHow to use: The main file requires you to change the folder name to \\\"music\\\". After that, just stick in the \\\"data\\\" folder. The optional files get put in the \\\"music\\\" folder and replaces whatever folder it is. For example, the \\\"Combat Alternatives\\\" consists of different folders, each bearing a theme. Simply choose a folder, rename it \\\"combat\\\", and stick it in the \\\"music\\\" folder (overwriting whats there).\r\n To uninstall, simply delete the music folder.\r\n ",
