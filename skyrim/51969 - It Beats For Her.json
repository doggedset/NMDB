  "descriptionHtml": "It Beats For Her is a short mystery tale set in Falkreath. You receive a note from a stranger who recruits you in his quest to find and stop a dangerous predator. But is it really a simple monster hunt or is there more to the story?\r<br />\r<br />=======================\r<br />\r<br />This quest, which will take around 15 minutes to complete, is specifically aimed at players who like exploration gameplay and a subtle narrative. A keen intellect is more valuable than a sword here, though maybe don’t leave the sword at home — you never know. Don’t expect any quest markers to help you out, though&#33;\r<br />\r<br />To start the quest, go to Falkreath and wait for a courier to arrive. Going in and out of a building will make him appear right away. Alternatively, you can incorporate the quest in your normal Skyrim playthrough, and wait to come across it naturally.\r<br />\r<br />=======================\r<br />\r<br />All content in It Beats For Her, with the exception of Bethesda’s material, was created by me, and thus may not be duplicated or altered. Screenshot were taken using Boris Vorontsov&#39;s ENB Series.\r<br />\r<br />A very special thanks goes out to everyone who gave me feedback and helped me out during the beta&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Questions, comments, opinions, and significant bugs can be sent to: me [at] veliremus.com. I will do my best to give a timely response. The quest is also available on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=235738396\r<br />\r<br />Last but not least: Thanks for playing, and have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />=======================\r<br />\r<br />Quotes from players:\r<br />\r<br />“This is definitely the kind of mod I love seeing added to this game, great work, thank you so much for sharing, time to play&#33;”\r<br />- Nomad\r<br />\r<br />“Just did it and it was great&#33; Nice story and nice atmosphere, reminded me of some fantastic books: you don&#39;t see anything but you feel something is wrong.”\r<br />- Wartow\r<br />\r<br />“The notes drove the story in such a way that dialogue wasn&#39;t needed and it was impressive to see in a small mod. I can&#39;t wait to see your next work&#33;”\r<br />- Codename Hexx\r<br />\r<br />&#34;This mod was a bit of a breath of fresh air from the typical quest mod we usually get. So go check it out if you&#39;re looking for a creepy, mystery, romance short quest.&#34;\r<br />- [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFEdj-7Cjwg]MMOxReview[/url]",
