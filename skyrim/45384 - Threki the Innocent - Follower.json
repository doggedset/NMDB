  "descriptionHtml": "Mod: Threki the Innocent (Follower)\r<br />Author: Undead Rufus\r<br />\r<br />-----------\r<br />Description\r<br />-----------\r<br />\r<br />Threki is a Nord follower suited for stealth and dual-wielding.\r<br />\r<br />In vanilla Skyrim, Threki the Innocent is jailed in Riften for speaking out against Ulfric Stormcloak, but interaction is limited to a few lines of ambient dialogue about her situation. This mod adds a [very] short quest allowing the player to free and recruit Threki. Begin the quest by looking for a note on the floor near the Riften Guard Jailor, and don&#39;t expect to just walk out of the jail unchallenged.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve taken the liberty of changing Threki&#39;s appearance. If you want her to look as she does in my screenshots, then you&#39;ll need CBBE and the CBBE version of Maevan2&#39;s Mature Skin Texture (links below).\r<br />\r<br />After her quest is finished, Threki will wander around Riften when she isn&#39;t following you. She can&#39;t be married, but you can change her default residence with the follower management mod of your choice. I use EFF.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve tested this mod extensively and tried to account for potential player behaviors as well as I can, but please let me know if you encounter bugs, typos, spontaneous explosions or other issues.\r<br />\r<br />Required:\r<br />An up-to-date version of Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />Recommended:\r<br />EFF - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12933//?\r<br />Convenient Horses - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14950//?\r<br />CBBE - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666/?\r<br />Mature Skin Texture and Body - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32986/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />------------\r<br />Installation\r<br />------------\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />With NMM, simply download the mod and activate it.\r<br />\r<br />Manual Installation:\r<br />Extract the archive and drag the contents to your .SkyrimData folder. From your launcher, check UR_Threki.esp.\r<br />\r<br />Start Threki&#39;s quest by reading the note on the floor near the Riften Jailor Guard.\r<br />\r<br />[heading] OMG&#33; The old Threki is appearing in Riften Jail&#33; [/heading]\r<br />Yes, when attempting to load Threki into an existing save, the original Threki the Innocent might spawn in Riften Jail. This seems to be an issue only if you&#39;ve visited Riften Jail previously, and vanilla Threki&#39;s data is already in your save file. To fix, install the provided Existing Save Patch and set it to load after the main mod. If using NMM (recommended), be sure to *not* upgrade when asked. This [i]should[/i] disable the unwanted doppelganger.\r<br />\r<br />Files:\r<br />.UR_Threki.esp\r<br />.UR_Threki.bsa\r<br />.UR_Threki.bsl\r<br />\r<br />Version History:\r<br />0.1 - Initial release.",
