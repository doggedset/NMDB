  "descriptionHtml": "Ok folks here\\'s a run down of what i\\'ve done and why.\r\nI felt as though the dogs were unappreciated and I saw no mods for them, I couldn\\'t help but care for meeko when I realized his owner was dead.\r\nThe dogs are ranked from lowest to strongest stray, meeko, & vigilence.\r\n\r\nStray has been made essential and has his speed increased by %50 and i didn\\'t do anything else to this one.\r\n\r\nMeeko has been made essential had his speed increased by %50 and has had a %25 chance to knock-down to his forward lunge attack and increased his aggression to aggressive.\r\n\r\nVigilence has had the most improvement since he\\'s a trained dog and cost 500 gold, he\\'s been made essential has his speed increased by %50 and has had a %50 chance to knock-down in his forward lunge attack and has the highest aggression to very aggressive.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has suggestions feel free to post and perhaps we can name the stray dog.",
