  "descriptionHtml": "I found it very frustrating to not be able to make paper rolls or baskets when using certain mods so this just adds recipes.  Making a basket can be used with either Linen or Straw; Making rolls of paper requires more effort, you need ruined books of any kind and use them in a cooking pot to create mush, then go to a armor table and create rolls of paper. \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No scripting so it won&#39;t interfere, the worse that could happen is you&#39;d find duplicate recipes in your menu if you have a mod that does something similar to this.",
