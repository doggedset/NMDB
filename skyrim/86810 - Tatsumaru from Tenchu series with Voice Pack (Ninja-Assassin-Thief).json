  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][color=#00ff00]Hello Tenchu fans &#33; The character is made based on images and movies from Tenchu 3, Tenchu 2. Same goes with the sounds remastered and cleared with Audacity. I didn&#39;t rip the assets so it&#39;s my authorial work.Â  \r<br />The clothes are based on Sub-Zero with significantly remodeled mesh.\r<br />\r<br />It really shines with the mods and voicepack shown in this video:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]C7r0A4QsHsI[/youtube][/size]\r<br />[size=4]You can also check Rikimaru and Ayame Mod on my profile\r<br />\r<br />I highly reccomend to use following mods:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />- Ponytail Hairstyles v3_0 by Azar\r<br />- Pull Mastery Hookshot or Grappling hook by Xzax\r<br />- Dragon Ninjatos by AlexScorpion\r<br />- Martial Arts by evanoblivion\r<br />- 1H and 2H katana attack animations by mofu\r<br />\r<br />All mods are available on Skirim Nexus\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4]WHAT THE DOWNLOADED FILES CONTAIN ?[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Tatsumaru&#39;s Armor, Gloves, Boots, Sword (decoration), Mask for Male Imperial (on the video), Male Nord, Male Redguard, Male Breton\r<br />- Voice pack - replaces player&#39;s Male Imperial (on the video), Male Nord, Male Redguard, Male Breton voices. Jump sound is used by everybody. \r<br />The is no way to differenciate the races with the sound files in this case. \r<br />There is a chance some NPC in game will use this voice pack but I didn&#39;t find any yet so don&#39;t worry. Jump sound uses\r<br />different pitch range depending on surface you walk on. Sounds preety weird on snow. I&#39;m not sure how to change it.\r<br />Anything else works perfect and gives the character Tatsumaru&#39;s personality. Enjoy &#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4]INSTALL:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1. Put and merge &#34;Data&#34; folder in your Skyrim directory&gt;2. To obtain the items in the game open console command &#34;~&#34;\r<br />3. type: help &#34;tatsumaru&#34; 0 (you will see all the items related to tatsumaru)\r<br />4. type: player.additem &lt;id number of chosen item&gt; 1\r<br />5. Put on added items from your inventory\r<br />6. Play\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4]\r<br />UNINSTALL: [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1. Delete the files from the &#34;Data&#34; folder. They don&#39;t overwrite original Skyrim files so it&#39;s safe to do it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Created by Bleeiz from Nexus Skyrim",
