  "descriptionHtml": "As usual, [u][b]SKSE FREE[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />NOT compatible with mods that [u]change the pots records [/u](Iron Pot, Dwemer Pan and Kettle)\r<br />Should be compatible with all the HD and texture replacers\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Warning: [/u][/b]This mod is designed to be immersive. No hotkeys, no spells, no &#34;easy&#34; ways. If you miss the old times when developers prefer realism over simplifications (for example, check the [i]Arx Fatalis[/i] cooking), this mod is for you. Otherwise, you will find it too complicated.\r<br />\r<br />Become self-reliant.  Cook ANYTIME, ANYWHERE using your fire spells and the existing in-game kitchenware. To cook anywhere you need a knife, a pot and a fire spell.\r<br />\r<br />Tutorial / Demonstration:\r<br />[youtube]yZzmUtreeYU[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />You can also use a torch or fire shouts to start cooking:\r<br />[youtube]QLoOyhadzME[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />This mod gives purpose to several kinds of pots you can find in game:\r<br />- Cast Iron Pot\r<br />- Dwemer Pan\r<br />- Kettle\r<br />\r<br />[u]How to cook[/u] (general instruction):\r<br />1) Find a [b]knife[/b]. You should have the [i]Dwemer Knife [/i]or the [i]regular [/i]knife in your inventory. You can also just equip a [i]dagger to your hand[/i].\r<br />2) Drop a pot to the ground and cast a[u] fire spell[/u] to it. The pot will gain heat\r<br />3) Hide your hands after you have enough heat to cook. The pot [u]MUST remain static[/u] while cooking (if your follower or another NPC touch it, the cooking session will end)\r<br />4) The pot will [b][u]LOSE HEAT[/u][/b] with time, you have LIMITED time to cook. After that the menu will disappear. If you want to continue, you will have to heat the object again.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Additional factors:[/u]\r<br />- Taking a hot pot will [i][b]damage your health[/b][/i]. You can cool it down using the Frost spells. Gauntlets will reduce damage a bit.\r<br />- [i][b]Wall of flames [/b][/i]provides more heat and you can cook longer.\r<br />- Drop [b][u]Firewood [/u][/b]nearby to heat faster and cook longer (one log will be burned down after each cooking session)\r<br />- Search campfires, forges and other [u][b]fire sources[/b][/u] to heat faster and have unlimited cooking time (just put the pot near the fire, stay close and cast the fire spell).\r<br />- You can also start cooking using just a torch near the campfire (perform bash attack on the pot)\r<br />- [i]Weather conditions[/i] matter a lot. In cold or rainy day it will require more time to heat the pot and the item will lose heat faster. Also, you won&#39;t be able to cook without fuel (Firewood or campfire) in cold weather.\r<br />- The [u]pot size[/u] affects how fast it will cool down while cooking. For example, kettle will keep heat much longer than the small iron pot.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Known issues:[/u] If the animation is stuck, use jump or try to equip another magic or weapon.\r<br />\r<br />After [u][b]uninstalling [/b][/u]the mod mid-game, script cleaning is recommended, but not required (you should have only the missing class warnings).",
