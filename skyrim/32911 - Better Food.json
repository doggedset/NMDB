  "summary": "Makes food a lot more practical for healing purposes for all types of characters and adds some new foods and recipes. DOES NOT require any dlc.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Meats heal your health and stamina\r\nFruits and vegetables heal your health and magicka.\r\nCheeses heal your stamina and magicka.\r\nThe amount of meat on most monster drops have been increased based on how big the monster is, and the new foods have been added into vendors inventory, enemy drops, and barrels like they were there from the start.\r\n\r\nCooked Meats from Mammoths heal for large amounts due to them coming from....well mammoths! Meat from Sabre Cats and Bears heal for a good amount while fish heals for a small amount due to how easy it is to acquire them.\r\nPlease give me feed back if you think that I need to balance any of the foods or if there is any issues!\r\n\r\nCompatabilities:\r\nShould be compatible with any mod as long as they don\\'t change the heal value on foods.\r\nNOT compatible with Real Needs and Diseases currently, I am hoping to come up with a solution for this in the future.",
