  "descriptionHtml": "This is a fixed version of a brilliant mod &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29979/?]Lock Overhaul[/url]&#34; by Quad2Core, which was sadly not compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59849/?]Perkus Maximus[/url] by t3nd0. For those unaware, t3nd0&#39;s Perma, like Skyre, switches Lockpick and Pickpocket tree, and while LO was compatible with Skyre, it couldn&#39;t detect Perma&#39;s changes. \r<br />\r<br />Truth to be told,the fix was dead easy to make (one global variable set to 1), but I&#39;ve recompiled it, so it now should properly detect Perma Thief Module (you should see that in the MCM menu). \r<br />\r<br />Full disclosure:\r<br />I&#39;ve contacted Quad2Core in February (&#33;) regarding this problem, and whether or not I can upload the file, or send them a fixed version. We had a short discussion, and I have been given permission to upload it, but after I explained what has changed (read below), I was waiting for some final confirmation (since, after all, the author should have the last word). But then, silence. No messages, no approval, disapprovals, or any form of contact. \r<br />\r<br />So, from now on, I&#39;ll assume that the creator of original mod, Quad2Core has been kidnapped by aliens, and thus couldn&#39;t respond. If that is not true, by any chance, and Quad2Core is reading these words, and does not approve of this, just send me a message. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This is a[b] full version [/b]of the mod, modified for perma, so you don&#39;t need the original. Download, install after Perma. proceed to the original page to learn more. The extra options for autopick, bash, etc. should work now, and it will level Dexterity. \r<br />\r<br />Oh, and this version is not just for Perma. It works for vanilla and SkyRe as well, just like the original, since that&#39;s how I modified it. See below for more explanation.\r<br />\r<br />Installation mid-playthrough. \r<br />If you have installed regular LO and realised it&#39;s not working, deactivate it, uninstall it, save, uncheck the mod, and then install my version, and then activate and configure again. If everything goes right you should get a message in MCM &#34;Perma thief detected&#34;, next to &#34;SKSE detected&#34;. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Another disclosure:[/b]\r<br />I&#39;d rather not start a helpdesk for a mod I haven&#39;t made, so unless you are absolutely sure I&#39;ve made something horribly, horribly wrong, and whatever you are experiencing is strictly related to perma-specific version of LO, please consult the original mod&#39;s forum/posts/google first and then contact me. Given the circumstances, I hope you understand why.  \r<br />\r<br />[b]What has been changed? (nerdy stuff)[/b]\r<br />\r<br />As I said, LO is ready to use Pickpocket instead of Lockpick, as it is compatible with Skyre. When loaded, it detects one global variable from Skyre_Main.esp, and using that as a base, it sets its own global variable to 1. All other scripts and perks silently running in the background then decide which skill to use, judging by that one number. \r<br />\r<br />So, when we get down to the basics, the simplest fix would be to set manually that one GV to 1 and then re-add the perks so they can start kicking. But I&#39;ve made it nicer for everyone. It now checks for a equivalent GV in PerkusMaximus_Master, and simply &#34;thinks&#34; we&#39;re running SkyRe. \r<br />\r<br />in _q2c_playerloadgame_script.psc, I&#39;ve added lines to detect variable isPermaThiefLoaded in PerkusMaximus_Master.esp\r<br />\r<br />    if isSkyReLoaded\r<br />        isSkyReLoaded = (game.GetFormFromFile(52156464, &#34;SkyRe_Main.esp&#34;) as Bool || game.GetFormFromFile(0x003176CB, &#34;PerkusMaximus_Master.esp&#34;) as Bool)\r<br />        ;the above checks whether SkyreLoaded or isPermaThiefLoaded variables are equal to 1\r<br />        if isSkyReLoaded\r<br />            _Q2C_Global_IsSkyReLoaded.SetValue(1.00000)\r<br />        else\r<br />            _Q2C_Global_IsSkyReLoaded.SetValue(0.000000)\r<br />        endIf\r<br />    else\r<br />        isSkyReLoaded = (game.GetFormFromFile(52156464, &#34;SkyRe_Main.esp&#34;) as Bool || game.GetFormFromFile(0x003176CB, &#34;PerkusMaximus_Master.esp&#34;) as Bool)\r<br />        if isSkyReLoaded\r<br />            _Q2C_Global_IsSkyReLoaded.SetValue(1.00000)\r<br />        else\r<br />            _Q2C_Global_IsSkyReLoaded.SetValue(0.000000)\r<br />        endIf\r<br />    endIf\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />and in _q2c_lockrequirement_mcm_base.psc I&#39;ve changed the MCM menu to show up the difference:\r<br />\r<br />                if _Q2C_Global_IsSkyReLoaded.GetValue() == 1.00000\r<br />                    if (game.GetFormFromFile(52156464, &#34;SkyRe_Main.esp&#34;) as Bool)\r<br />                        SkyReLoadedOID_T = self.AddTextOption(&#34;SkyRe is active&#34;, &#34;&#34;, 0)\r<br />                    elseif (game.GetFormFromFile(0x003176CB, &#34;PerkusMaximus_Master.esp&#34;) as Bool)\r<br />                        SkyReLoadedOID_T = self.AddTextOption(&#34;PerMa Thief is active&#34;, &#34;&#34;, 0)\r<br />                    EndIf\r<br />                else\r<br />                    self.AddEmptyOption()\r<br />                endIf\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />\r<br />Quad2Core for creating Lock Overhaul\r<br />t3nd0 for creating Perkus Maximus",
