  "descriptionHtml": "If you have the Dragonborn DLC, probably you have finished the Bloodskal Barrow quest? The bloodskal blade beam always deal a ridiculously low 30 damage, the beam was awesome , but it deals 30 damage only, which is useless mid to late game.\n<br />\n<br />Now I have created a better version of the beam, which levels up as your [b]Two-Handed[/b] skill does. That said, the higher your Two-Handed skill, the higher the damage the beam will deal. Be ready to love your Bloodskal Blade when you have installed this mod!\n<br />\n<br />Damage Table(Two-Handed Skill - Damage)\n<br />0 to 30: 30\n<br />31 to 40 : 40\n<br />41 to 50 : 50\n<br />51 to 60 : 60\n<br />61 to 70 : 70\n<br />71 to 80 : 80\n<br />81 to 99 : 90\n<br />100+ : 100\n<br />\n<br />Test done on Forsworn Briarheart(44313) [b]WITHOUT[/b] perks(Two-Handed Skill - Damage)\n<br />15 - 17\n<br />100 - 55",
