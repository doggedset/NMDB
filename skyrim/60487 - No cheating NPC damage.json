  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever wondered why a level 7 Stormcloak soldier was doing wayyy too much damage to your level 40+ dragonborn? Well I rooted out the culprit. There are a number of perks that alter damage for npcs in an unfair and disingenuous way. I haven&#39;t removed them; I simply edited their effects so that they will behave as expected.\r<br />\r<br />To install, simply drag and drop the ESP into the data folder and activate.\r<br />I guess you could use nmm. There are no assets, only the esp\r<br />\r<br />As for compatibility, this mod is basically compatible with all mods in that it won&#39;t cause skyrim to crash on its own, but if there is a mod that uses one of those perks, then you may have an easier fight than the mod creator intended. That&#39;s pretty much it.",
