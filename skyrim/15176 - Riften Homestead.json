  "summary": "Updated. Riften Homestead is a small lore-friendly player home by the shore just north of Heartwood Mill that has basement storage, an adjoining crafting area, stable, garden, small animal pen, and it\\'s own dock. ...",
  "descriptionHtml": "Updated version 0.49: Just added a bunch of stuff!\r\n\r\nOutdoors:  Stable with a horse, small vegetable garden, several planters with alchemical ingredients, a small animal pen with a cow and two chickens, and a dog to watch over everything.  Also much landscaping to carve out a larger area to include everything.\r\n\r\nIndoors:  Double bed instead of single, also gives rested benefit now.  Basement expanded to include guest/servant\\'s bedroom.\r\n\r\n=================================================================\r\n=================================================================\r\nFor my second mod I thought I\\'d try something a little less complex -- meaning no NPCs mainly.  The house is fairly small, but I added a basement for food storage, etc.  Additionally, outside the house is an adjacent covered area for crafting, a dock, and a raised stone area with a fire pit for enjoying the cool nights by the stream.\r\n\r\n=================================================================\r\n\r\nContents:\r\n\r\n1 alchemy table\r\n1 enchanting table\r\n1 bookcase (the lame kind)\r\n1 cooking pot\r\n4 weapon plaques\r\n2 large display cases\r\n2 small display cases\r\n3 mannequins\r\n1 blacksmith forge\r\n1 tanning rack\r\n1 sharpening wheel\r\n1 armor table\r\nvarious chests and containers\r\n\r\n===================================================================\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n\r\nAlmost due north of Heartwood Mill at the opposite edge of the water.  The map symbol used is a small house, fittingly.\r\n\r\nOr, you can use \\\"coc rifthome\\\".\r\n\r\n===================================================================\r\n\r\nKnown Issues/Bugs:\r\n\r\n1)  Navmesh should be good inside, mostly okay outside.  Sometimes the horse attempts to walk through the wall of the stable.\r\n",
