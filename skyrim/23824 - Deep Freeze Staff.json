  "descriptionHtml": "Uses: It is a staff that has the Ice Form shout enhancement. The Ice Form shout is the Greybeards\\' version. Duration of the ice form is one minute (Depends on the enemy\\'s level.) and Generic Frost Damage: 2.\r\nChanges in v1.1\r\nNow in cupboard! In the Markarth Warrens . (In front of Cindha Mine)\r\n\r\nCredits go to: Bethesda, Skyrim Nexus, Creation kit and a mysterious fellow who helped me.\r\nIf there is a bug, please message me!\r\nGmail: ecbagas21@gmail.com.\r\nYahoo: fattyback@rocketmail.com!\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nPut the StaffofFreeze.esp to your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nDelete the StaffofFreeze.esp in your Skyrim Data folder or from your Skyrim Launcher Data files.\r\n\r\nKnown bugs: Sometimes you will wield two Deep Freeze Staff. Just equip and unequip it.\r\n\r\nQuestions and Answers\r\nQ: Conflicting with other mods?\r\nA: I dunno.\r\n\r\nQ: Greybeards\\' Ice form version won\\'t break if attacked right?\r\nA: Correct.\r\n\r\nQ: When will the Ice Form effect be gone?\r\nA: 1 minute, just like the Greybeards\\' version.\r\n\r\nQ: If I accidentally freeze my follower, what should I do?\r\nA: Since the Ice Form effect won\\'t break by any hit, then you will have to wait until the effect goes away.\r\n\r\nQ: I am surrounded by enemies and I frozen my follower. I cannot help him/her and my follower is dead. What should I do next time to save my follower?\r\nA: 2 options from my idea: 1. Freeze your enemies, kill them and save your follower. 2. Let them kill your follower, then kill your enemies and use console command \\'resurrect\\' to your follower.\r\n\r\nQ: YOU RUIN MY GAME EXPERIENCE! WHAT WILL YOU SAY TO ME?\r\nA: Sorry, you could uninstall the mod if you don\\'t like it. Make sure you have an early save before you test it.\r\n\r\nQ: Why don\\'t you make the duration forever so it is like a God item?\r\nA: Cause god items are for milk drinkers (Just kidding) and a very good reason is that if its forever, then how will you recover your frozen ally?\r\n\r\nQ: Why is it steal not take?\r\nA: The staff belongs to the people of the Warrens.\r\n\r\nThe Ice Form effect will not work on mechanical like a Dwarven Centurion, Dragons, Dragon Priest (Not confirmed), mammoths, etc. (Note that it will still do the frost damage).\r\n\r\nThis staff is destruction so if you have a high destruction skill, the better.\r\nThe Ice Form will reduce the damage of spells and physical attacks.",
