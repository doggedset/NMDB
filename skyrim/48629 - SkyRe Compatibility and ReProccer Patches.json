I have made the patches for my own use, and thought I would share them with the Nexus Community. I know how hard it is to keep things updated for all the various mod authors and patches. Things are forever changing and evolving. I will always accept requests if they are within my scope to complete.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/28/d3pe.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imageshack.com/a/img826/8499/6jqm.png[/img]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50349]YOT -
