Their morality is set to \"Any crime\" so thay will commit any crime you ask. \n<br />\n<br />You can find them in the Drunken Huntsman, in Whiterun, the armory shop owned by two elves.\n<br />\n<br />The mod is standalone, so you don't need any other mod to make it work. But I recommend that you use UFO (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037) to add to these followers all the functionalities added by that mod.\n<br />\n<br />Changing their body shape\n<br />-------------------------------\n<br />They use the UNP base body as default, if you want to change it to another body mod:\n<br />\n<br />* Changing it to another UNP compatible body (UNP Slim, UNPB, UNPB-BBP, UNPC, etc):\n<br />** Copy the nif files of the body mod you want to use to the DataMeshesAsharaErin Follower folder\n<br />\n<br />* Changing it to another body mod\n<br />** Copy the mesh files (.nif) of the body mod you want to use to the DataMeshesAsharaErin Follower folder\n<br />\n<br />For Erin and Rowan:\n<br />** Copy the texture files (.dds) of the body mod you want to use to the DataTexturesAsharaErin Followerfemale folder. Beware that you may see a neck seam on Erin and Rowan if doing it. If there is a set of textures of the Temptress race made for the body you are using, you can copy those textures (including the face textures), to avoid the neck seam problem.\n<br />For Sienna and Amarie:\n<br />** Copy the texture files (.dds) of the body mod you want to use to the DataTexturesAsharaErin FollowerSiennaFemale folder. Beware that you may see a neck seam on Sienna and Amarie if doing it, so I recommend that you also copy a set of face textures compatible with the body you are going to use. My original Sienna character is a vanilla Imperial and my original Amarie character is a vanilla High elf.\n<br />For Anja:\n<br />** Copy the texture files (.dds) of the body mod you want to use to the DataTexturesAsharaErin FollowerAnjaFemale folder. Beware that you may see a neck seam on Anja if doing it, so I recommend that you also copy a set of face textures compatible with the body you are going to use. My original Anja character is a vanilla Nord.\n<br />For Sigrid:\n<br />** Copy the texture files (.dds) of the body mod you want to use to the DataTexturesAsharaErin FollowerSigridFemale folder. Beware that you may see a neck seam on Sigrid if doing it, so I recommend that you also copy a set of face textures compatible with the body you are going to use. My original Sigrid character is a vanilla Nord.\n<br />\n<br />Find them if they get lost \n<br />--------------------------------- \n<br />If you want to find them you can use the console command: \n<br />\n<br />player.moveto RefId \n<br />\n<br />and instead of RefId use the RefId of the follower you want to find: \n<br />\n<br />* Erin -&gt; xx00639A \n<br />* Sienna -&gt; xx009423 \n<br />* Rowan -&gt; xx00d4d7 \n<br />* Anja -&gt; xx00D4D8 \n<br />* Amarie -&gt; xx0125a5 \n<br />* Sigrid -&gt; xx014614\n<br />\n<br />where xx is the order in which this mod is loaded (you must use that number, not xx). You can see that number in Nexus Mod Manager Plugin list or use the console in game and type: \n<br />help Rowan \n<br />you'll see some items and numbers, one of them will be like this: \n<br />_NPC Rowan (xx00BF38) \n<br />instead of xx you'll see there the load order number for my mod in your game. \n<br />\n<br />That will teleport your character where the follower is. \n<br />\n<br />The recuiting dialogue doesn't appear \n<br />-------------------------------------- \n<br />Install the mod, save the game and exit Skyrim completely. \n<br />Launch the game and load the saved game. Now you should see the \"Follow me\" line when talking to them. Skyrim has problems loading dialogues the first time you install a mod.\n<br />\n<br />[size=14][color=yellow]Required mods\n<br />==========================================================================================================================================[/size][/color]\n<br />None.\n<br />\n<br />[size=14][color=yellow]Install\n<br />==========================================================================================================================================[/size][/color]\n<br />Install using Nexus Mod Manager (NMM)\n<br />-------------------------------------\n<br />1.
