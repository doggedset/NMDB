  "summary": "Making playable races as they once were.",
  "descriptionHtml": "While Skyrim is a great game,there is something different about it that I didn\\'t liked much.\r\nAs part of a simplification process the special feats and attributes of the various races has been nerfed,so your decision of what race your character will be doesn\\'t make much of a difference.\r\nBelieveing that if the races where more different from one another like they where in the old games would be more interesting to start new playthroughs,I decided to mod the game so each race of the game regains its special bonuses and feats as in older games!\r\nThis mod is to alter the resistances,abilities,and starting skills of each race so they are as they where in Oblivion.\r\nThe mod is not ready yet,but as soon as the Creation Kit is available,work on will practically start right away.",
