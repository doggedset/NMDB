  "descriptionHtml": "[center][quote]...After the Oblivion Crisis, a number of groups cropped up dedicated to wiping out the remnants of the Mythic Dawn Cult...  -Silus Vesuius[/quote]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a short quest line with some minor puzzles to solve that, when finished, will reward you with a collection of equipment and spells.  I added to this mod slowly over the years creating weapons, armor, and spells that fit my personal RP.  Recently, I decided that I would like to share them so I put together a quest and wrote some lore to explain the RP.\r<br />\r<br />Updates:\r<br />V.101: Small fixes\r<br />V.102 Fix for 1st person clipping of collar\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=5]What&#39;s in it? [/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]1) The Storm Axe: [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/b]A throwing axe that is enchanted to return to the user after it has been thrown.  Grants and ability called &#34;Throw Axe&#34; when in possession of it.  The axe cannot be upgraded or enchanted so I&#39;ve compensated for this by giving it a few perks.  To compensate for not being able to upgrade the weapon, I&#39;ve increased its damage to levels that should be similar to an upgraded dragon-bone waraxe if sharpened with max level blacksmith skill and the dragon-bone armor perk.  To compensate for the lack of custom enchants I&#39;ve increased the weapon&#39;s speed and crit chance slightly.\r<br />\r<br />Additionally, when the axe is in your inventory, you will be able to craft a replica of it that is up-gradable and enchant-able, however it cannot be used in place of the Storm Axe with the [i]Throw Axe[/i] ability.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]2) Ebony Chainmail:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Old set of ebony chainmail that was modeled after the Ursine armor from the Witcher 3.  Heavy armor and ebony in quality.  Is upgradeable and enchantable.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]3) Longhilt:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/b]An ebony greatsword that is enchanted with the ability to generate a ward in front of it when blocking.  Ebony in quality, upgradeable and IS STILL enchantable.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]4) Ebony Mace:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Simple mace, ebony quality, upgradeable and enchantable.  \r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]5)  Power - &#34;Leap&#34;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/b]A warhorn can be found, that when picked up will grant the ability, Leap, to the holder.  Leap is a sort of blink ability that quickly moves the caster to the targeted location.  On arrival the caster will deal physical damage that is determined by the caster&#39;s skill in the Alteration school of magic.  The higher the skill, the higher the damage and magicka cost of using the spell.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]6)  Power - &#34;Throw Axe&#34;[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This is the &#34;power&#34; that is given to the player after they have attained the Storm Axe.  By itself, the ability does a base amount of damage and staggers the opponent.  With the warhorn, however, the ability&#39;s damage output is increased, which is determined by two things:  the Blacksmithing skill and the Alteration skill.  \r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]7)  Lore[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll find a collection of books and notes as you proceed through the quest, most of which will be found at the end.  They give a small summary to the dead/dying order known by a few names but you&#39;ll know them as the &#34;Setting Sun&#34;.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5][u]Q&A:\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/size][/b]Q:  How do I begin the quest? \r<br />A:  Head to the border between Skyrim and Hammerfell.  If you don&#39;t know where that is, head to Falkreath and leave SW from there following the road.  The border should be just beyond Haldir&#39;s Cairn, there you should find a dead woman with a scroll and a journal on her.\r<br />\r<br />Q:  I&#39;ve picked up the journal and read it but the quest won&#39;t start&#33;\r<br />A:  Bug that occasionally happens.  Just drop the book and pick it back up.\r<br />\r<br />Q:  The scroll won&#39;t work&#33;\r<br />A:  &#39;Nother bug that happens, fast travel once to any location to fix it (stay in Skyrim however, Solstheim and modded areas won&#39;t work.  Lore reasons).  After fast traveling once you shouldn&#39;t have to do that again, the scroll will work normally forever more.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Resources used/Credits:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />tueffelachtein - Modular Crafting Table\r<br />Open Books Resource, Alchemy Resource - Blary\r<br />Elianora - Eli&#39;s Resources[/center]",
