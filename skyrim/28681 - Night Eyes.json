  "descriptionHtml": "NightEyes\r\nA New spell from the Illusion school that mimics the Khajit Night Eyes lesser power\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage : English\r\nRequirements : None\r\n\r\n* Story *\r\nWhile trudging around in a dungeon with low light I got tired of constantly casting Candlelight, and the uneven lighting it provided.  I checked for a mod that added a night vision spell like there was in Morrowind and Oblivion, but the only things I found were huge spell packs, and I just wanted this one spell. After figuring out how to create a new spell from an existing spell effect and then make a book that taught that spell, I tested it on my Nord and it worked great.  I how that you enjoy this mod.\r\n\r\n* Installation *\r\nDownload with Nexus Mod Manager \r\n-or-\r\nDownload the .rar file, unpack it and the files into your Skyrim/Data folder, then check it\r\nin the game launcher menu (Data Files).\r\n\r\nDrevis Neloren in Winterholm College sells the Spell.\r\n\r\n* Uninstall *\r\nUncheck or delete the .esp file.\r\n\r\n* Details *\r\nCopied from the Khajit lesser power Night Eyes.\r\n\r\n* Bugs *\r\nI am far from perfect, so something could be missed of course. I will gladly take care about your reports and constructive criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n* If you like *\r\nEndorsements are welcome indeed, do not forget to vote! Thanx in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
