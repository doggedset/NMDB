  "descriptionHtml": "Check out the video link above. The pictures show the form best.\r\nVideo really shows the enhancements to the form, with morphing.\r\n\r\n______________________________________\r\nthe ...

Painstakingly\r\nremapped with smoother edges and softer curves. From top to \r\nbottom, head to toes. Originally designed to make the perfect \r\n\\\"sexy\\\" female form. With a real life female figure calculation \r\nalgorithm. Then added smart weapon/ammo nodes designed for\r\na solid default fit with anti-clipping. Along with a snug realistic\r\nlook, including scabbards.\r\n\r\nFix to most clipping,  ...

(have not checked them all)  \r\n(weapon offset 0.00 base with trim)\r\n\r\n______________________________________\r\nI also suggest you use the mod ...\r\n\r\nAuto Unequip Ammo ... by Alek\r\n(to hide your scabbard when not in use)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10753\r\n-\r\nAuto Unequip Helmet ... by Alek\r\nI use the helmet one too.

Then give these a try!\r\n\r\n... Nothing like a live test ...\r\nYou only need to back up four files.\r\n\r\nskeleton.nif\r\nskeletonbeast.nif\r\nskeleton_female.nif\r\nskeletonbeast_female.nif\r\n\r\nSkyrim\\\\data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\skeleton.nif\r\nSkyrim\\\\data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\skeletonbeast.nif\r\nSkyrim\\\\data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets female\\\\skeleton_female.nif\r\nSkyrim\\\\data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets female\\\\skeletonbeast_female.nif\r\n\r\n______________________________________\r\nInstallation:  (back up your .nif files as shown above)\r\nUnpack .rar file drop the Data drawer in your Skyrim drawer.\r\nto Uninstall:  Delete the four files and replace with your back ups.\r\n\r\n______________________________________\r\nIf your having problems ...\r\nIf it helps to only use the one .nif ... [skeleton_female.nif]\r\nby all means try that. The \\\"skeleton_female.nif\\\" is the main file.\r\nThe others were added for known support to other mods,\r\nand to provide you with a full blown player skeleton.\r\n(a player skeleton helps many things in Skyrim run smoothly)\r\nThe [skeletonbeast_female.nif] is a bit on the male side.\r\n(no turning into a terrifying beast with a girlish form)  \r\n\r\n[Weapon offset] numbers in the body slot may cause unwanted results.\r\nThe skeletal .nifs was modeled around 0.00 the games default offset.\r\nWith a small variant to accommodate the games female armor offsets.\r\n\r\n______________________________________\r\nHow find your sweet spot ...\r\nWhile setting a controlled weight spread among the human females.\r\nsweet spot: The number the weight is at (from 1 to 100) when a naked \r\ntoon has a weapon (say a dagger) in the perfect position with minimal float.\r\nCan be tested and set from the consolel with the  [player.snpcw #]  command. \r\n(once you find your sweet spot your ready) ... Hint: try 30-40+\r\nthe games average default female weight.\r\n\r\nZeroing in with the Slider ... (same weapon different use) ...\r\nUse the Caliente\\'s Body Slider to zero in on that sweet spot number.\r\nAnd set your desired bode shape.  \r\n\r\nExample ... \r\nMy sweet spot number is say 40. So I set my desired shape right at 40% on both\r\nthe Slider sides. Then move all the sliders I wish to effect in the same pattern as\r\nmy desired shape pattern. The same amount to the left (for the low setting) as I \r\nmove to the right (for the high setting). Now my desired shape is right at my \r\nsweet spot number. (a beautiful thing!) You will need a test/starting body.\r\nSo generate the style you wish, then hit the console to find your sweet spot.\r\nAfter, regenerate with above method. You may need to re-adjust or tweak\r\nusing ... [player.snpcw #]. For a \\\"fine\\\" tuning in the console. Finishing touches\r\nwith the command ... [player.scale #]  (\\\"lightly\\\" up or down)\r\n\r\nNow not only are you lined up with your weapons but with the games defaults. With a \r\ndefined variant for the games human female npcs to weight. While within the non-float\r\nzone. (again, a beautiful thing!) Some of the larger female npcs (if they are just to large)\r\nmay suffer some float. It shouldn\\'t be much. But that\\'s not a problem to you. Everything\r\nfor you fits perfectly.  ... Save and your a weapons model!  ...\r\n \r\nIf you happen to run across a female that is floating weapons help her out with\r\nthe [snpcw #] command and save. ;)\r\n\r\n______________________________________\r\nOne last \\\"trick\\\" ... To armor modders as far as female gear. The games\r\naverage default female weight is around 30% to 40% some at 50%.\r\nUsing a [Weapon Offset] of 0.00 to 0.15 works out well for all.\r\nThe game was never designed to have such adorable shapely females.\r\nSo keep it tight to avoid \\\"floaters\\\" ... \r\n\r\nYou can also use the Skyrim Creation Kit (CK) to adjust/correct the mods\r\nyou have now if they cause floaters. By adjusting the [Weapon Offset] down to\r\nthe games default of 0.00 to 0.15 on the default body armor templates data.\r\nThey will be from the [Object Window]/[ArmorAddon] ... It will be the body\r\narmors like the cuirass\\'s or biki\\'s. The ones usually with a \\\"1stperson_xxx.nif\\\" \r\nline in the lower blank under [First Person] on their edit interface.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s easy, double click a cuirass from [ArmorAddon] in the [Object Window].\r\nThen take a good look at the interface. Your looking for the entry, \r\n[Weapon Offsets].\r\n\r\nNow you have every offset tool and technique you need!\r\n______________________________________\r\nEnjoy!  ;)  over 100 hours of research and design\r\nto get it just right. perused 100\\'s of skeletons!\r\n.",
