The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC, is fully navmeshed and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />This is a basic, free cabin with plenty of safe storage (except for the barrels and sacks), a bed for followers, a cooking pot, enchanting and alchemy stations, two mannequins and some weapon displays. The mod also adds smithing facilities to a destroyed house by the main road with a blacksmith vendor, and an alchemy shop with a vendor at the edge of town. The blacksmith will stay here during the night. There is a map marker for the cabin available for the start.\r<br />\r<br />The differences between the mods are not really big - I cleaned several dirty edits, decorated the cabin, fixed AI packages for the NPC vendors, gave the cabin its own location info, added a bathtub to stay clean if you&#39;re using a mod such as [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29025//?]Drink Eat Sleep Bathe[/url], and that&#39;s about it, really. If you, by any chance, are using the original mod and would like to upgrade, make sure to remove EVERYTHING from the house before, as the container IDs have been modified.\r<br />\r<br />This is compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8333/?]Expanded Winterhold Destruction Ruins[/url], although you will need to disable several pieces of rubble with the console in order to enter the alchemy shop.\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. \r<br />\r<br />Now, for the credits:\r<br />- [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=93257454]Winterhold Cabin[/url] by Aylissan.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/?]Modders Resource Pack[/url] by Oaristys and Tony67.\r<br />- [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1264-catering-by-lilith/]Catering[/url] by Lilith.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
