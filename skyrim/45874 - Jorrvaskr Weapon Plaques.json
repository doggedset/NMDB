  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a few weapon plaques to the Harbinger&#39;s quarters in Jorrvaskr (the weapons already in them belong to whoever is Harbinger).  It also makes the middle bay of the upstairs weapon racks useable by the player.  No more running across town to Breezehome to display your Harbinger&#39;s weapons&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I created this mod after I got frustrated that Jorrvaskr had no place to safely display a certain 2-handed axe after finishing the Companions questline.  I figured the empty bay of one of the weapons racks would do nicely if I made it player-useable.  The Harbinger&#39;s plaques downstairs were an outgrowth of that.\r<br />\r<br />No DLC requirements.  Should be compatible with anything that doesn&#39;t greatly modify Jorrvaskr. \r<br />\r<br />The bookcase pictured is from Jøkerine&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32552]Guild Book Cases[/url] (Jorrvaskr download) and is [b][i]not[/i][/b] part of this mod.\r<br />\r<br />Note: The weapons on the plaques [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Creating_a_Weapon_Mount#Known_Issues]might fall to the floor[/url] when first entering the basement.  If this happens, just exit the basement through the load door and come back in.  They will reappear properly fastened to the plaques.\r<br />\r<br />This mod has been cleaned with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/]TES5Edit[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Also available on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=130445759]Steam Workshop[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[b]Bugs / known issues:[/b]\r<br />• The west weapon rack (the one in front of the window) isn&#39;t always useable for storage in my game, especially after storing a weapon in [i]either[/i] rack.  \r<br />• The swords and shield on the plaque above the display case cannot be removed in my game.  (The items belong to CompanionsHarbingerFaction.  They&#39;re supposed show &#34;Steal &lt;itemname&gt;&#34; if the player is not Harbinger, and &#34;Take &lt;itemname&gt;&#34; if the player is Harbinger; instead they&#39;re completely non-interactable.)\r<br />• The swords on the shield plaque in the Harbinger&#39;s bedroom cannot be taken in my game (although the shield can).  (The items belong to CompanionsHarbingerFaction.  They&#39;re all supposed show &#34;Steal &lt;itemname&gt;&#34; if the player is not Harbinger, and &#34;Take &lt;itemname&gt;&#34; if the player is Harbinger; the shield behaves as intended, but the swords are completely non-interactable.)\r<br />\r<br />If you find any (other) bugs or incompatibilities, please let me know in the comments&#33;  (Ditto for solutions to the known issues above.)",
