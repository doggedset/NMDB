Proper preparation is vital for survival...play at your own risk!\n<br />\n<br />*NEW IN VERSION 3.0*\n<br />- Optional files have been deleted. The dragons are only available as-is. I will NOT be creating seperate versions for extra enchants, no items, or easier dragons.\n<br />- The Dragon Lords are now almost fully voiced. Lotsoslun and Britkulaas use a female dragon voice, as I always intended them to be female. *Custom-made shouts like Elemental Breath and Blood Frost are NOT voiced.*\n<br />- Now, The Dragon Lords will not appear until Alduin begins resurrecting his lieutenants. Once you have passed that point in the Main Quest, you will receive a message at the top of your screen telling you that the Dragon Lords have returned.\n<br />- The magical resistances of the Dragon Lords have been significantly increased. See their stats below for more details.\n<br />\n<br />The dragons are as follows:\n<br />\n<br />Britkulaas (Beautiful Princess)\n<br />Location: Deep Folk Crossing\n<br />Health: 9000\n<br />Magicka: 8150\n<br />Stamina: 8100\n<br />Powers: Fireball, Fire Breath, Unrelenting Force\n<br />Resistances: Fire 100\n<br />\n<br />Faalgolin (The Earth Master)\n<br />Location: Near Lund’s Hut\n<br />Health: 9500\n<br />Magicka: 8150\n<br />Stamina: 8100\n<br />Powers: Elemental Breath, Fire Breath, Frost Breath\n<br />Resistances: Shock 75\n<br />\n<br />Finkroniid (The Conqueror)\n<br />Location: Near Ilinalta’s Deep\n<br />Health: 10000\n<br />Magicka: 9150\n<br />Stamina: 9100\n<br />Powers: Frost Breath, Frost Storm\n<br />Resistances: Frost 100, Shock 75\n<br />\n<br />Hevnozok (Most Brutal)\n<br />Location: Near Mistwatch\n<br />Health: 11000\n<br />Magicka: 10150\n<br />Stamina: 10100\n<br />Powers: Elemental Breath, Fireball, Fire Breath, Frost Breath, Frost Storm, Disarm, Unrelenting Force\n<br />Resistances: Fire 100, Shock 75\n<br />\n<br />Junsenax (King of Cruelty)\n<br />Location: Near Septimus Signus’s Outpost\n<br />Health: 15000\n<br />Magicka: 14150\n<br />Stamina: 14100\n<br />Powers: Alduin’s Firestorm, Blood Frost, Elemental Breath, Fireball, Fire Breath, Frost Breath, Frost Storm, Disarm, Unrelenting Force\n<br />Resistances: Fire 100, Frost 100, Magic 75, Shock 75\n<br />\n<br />Kendovzoor (Warrior Legend)\n<br />Location: Reachwind Eyrie\n<br />Health: 12000\n<br />Magicka: 11150\n<br />Stamina: 11100\n<br />Powers: Elemental Breath, Fireball, Fire Breath, Frost Breath, Frost Storm, Disarm\n<br />Resistances: Magic 75, Shock 75\n<br />\n<br />Lotsoslun (Great Blood Leech)\n<br />Location: Near Ustengrav and the Abandoned Shack\n<br />Health: 12000\n<br />Magicka: 11150\n<br />Stamina: 11100\n<br />Powers: Blood Frost, Frost Breath, Frost Storm, Unrelenting Force\n<br />Resistances: Frost 100, Magic 75\n<br />\n<br />Mulvednah (Strong Black Fury)\n<br />Location: Near Fallowstone Cave\n<br />Health: 13000\n<br />Magicka: 12150\n<br />Stamina: 12100\n<br />Powers: Elemental Breath, Fire Breath, Frost Breath, Storm Call, Disarm\n<br />Resistances: Frost 100, Magic 75, Shock 75\n<br />\n<br />Roknirjul (He Hunts Man)\n<br />Location: Near the Twilight Sepulcher\n<br />Health: 13000\n<br />Magicka: 12150\n<br />Stamina: 12100\n<br />Powers: Fireball, Fire Breath\n<br />Resistances: Fire 100, Shock 75\n<br />\n<br />Sahkulaan (Phantom Prince)\n<br />Location: Near Steed Stone\n<br />Health: 14000\n<br />Magicka: 13150\n<br />Stamina: 13100\n<br />Powers: Frost Breath, Frost Storm, Unrelenting Force\n<br />Resistances: Frost 100, Magic 75\n<br />\n<br />Once you have slain the dragons, you may gather special scales from their bodies. These scales can be used to craft unique sets of armor. There are five light sets and five heavy sets. These armors may also be tempered at a workbench. Crafting requires the Dragon Smithing perk.\n<br />\n<br />One dragon in particular has an additional item to drop. Junsenax will yield his heartstone upon death, which can then be used to craft a magical staff. This staff will summon the ghost of Junsenax to fight for you for two minutes. Although he can be summoned anywhere, it isn't a good idea to summon him indoors due to his size!\n<br />\n<br />Please upload pics of your battles with the dragons, and your characters in the armors. I love seeing them! :D\n<br />\n<br />Install\n<br />=======\n<br />1. Extract the files to a temporary location, like the desktop.\n<br />2. Copy files to SteamSteamAppscommonSkyrim\n<br />3. Start Skyrim Launcher, click 'Data Files', and make sure \"AV1Dragon_Lords.esp\" is checked.\n<br />4. Play!\n<br />\n<br />Uninstall\n<br />=========\n<br />1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file.\n<br />2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod. Keep a copy of the zipped file, and if you need to uninstall, use the archive to check which files to delete.\n<br />\n<br />Incompatibility\n<br />===============\n<br />No incompatibilities are known.\n<br />\n<br />This mod has been tested and is known to work with Deadly Dragons. It is highly recommended to use this mod in tandem with DD in order to enhance your Deadly Dragon experience!\n<br />\n<br />This mod has also been tested and is known to work with Bellyache's Dragons.\n<br />\n<br />Known Issues or Bugs\n<br />====================\n<br />The eyes and mouths of Britkulaas and Roknirjul linger for a few moments after soul absorption, presumably because they both use Odahviing's model (which isn't meant to die). These parts do disappear after a second, though. No fix is known at this time.\n<br />\n<br />History\n<br />=======\n<br />1.0, 2012/02/25 - Initial release.\n<br />     2012/02/26 - Optional .esp with no armor enchants made available.\n<br />2.0, 2012/04/14 - esp's updated to fix LOD textures; Lotsoslun now has aerial shouts.\n<br />3.0, 2012/07/22 - File upgraded to version 3.0, with new voices and scripting.
