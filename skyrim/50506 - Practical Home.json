  "descriptionHtml": "A Practical Home for all your housing needs with no clutter. All crafting can be done in a single spacious room. All the plants you need for alchemy are there as well. A bedroom off to the side with plenty of storage for all the junk you collect. The bedroom also includes all the shrines for blessings. A seamless Navmesh allows for followers to go wherever they please. \r<br />\r<br />I constructed this for myself because I couldn&#39;t find a house with everything for crafting close together. I made it in a day so it only has minor aesthetics. It&#39;s conveniently located just east/south east of Whiterun. The exterior is just a door next to the road. You can go there right after you leave the first village if you want to drop off all the junk you have collected and get a jump on crafting. \r<br />\r<br />If you download it please feel free to inform me of any bugs or other things I could add or forgot to add. \r<br />\r<br />Daxian Preston \r<br />\r<br />Version 1.3\r<br />Added a merchant &#34;MerchantMudcrab&#34; with &#036;10,000 you may remember this guy from Morrownid\r<br />Version 1.2\r<br />Fixed dwemer chests. They no longer reset items inside.\r<br />Version 1.1\r<br />Added map marker",
