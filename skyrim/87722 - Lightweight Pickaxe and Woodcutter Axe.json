Mine includes the poacher&#39;s axe, the notched pickaxe, and the ancient nordic pickaxe.Â  I haven&#39;t been able to find one that includes all of those before. All USLEEP and/or WAFR fixes have been brought forward. Should be compatible with texture/mesh replacers that don&#39;t rely upon an esp.\r<br />\r<br />Fully compatible (and recommended) with Frostfall\r<br />\r<br />Requires Dragonborn",
