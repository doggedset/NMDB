  "descriptionHtml": "*UPDATE*\r<br />All generic voice types now supported.\r<br />\r<br />*NOTE*\r<br />Put last in load order for maximum compatibility.\r<br />\r<br />--------------\r<br />Description \r<br />--------------\r<br />Have you ever wanted to have Nazeem as a follower but lead him into death instead, or ever wanted the Greybeards to follow you and use shouts to cause mayhem? \r<br />Or have Whiterun Guards protect you or have beggars as your followers? \r<br />Now you can with Follow Me Spells v2&#33;\r<br />\r<br />When NPC is affected by &#34;Follow Me Spell&#34; they are assigned a different faction so they will help fight anybody even their own faction people. (EX: Whiterun Guard attacking Citizens a.k.a Nazeem.) They are also assigned Auto Heal so if they are not Essential or Protected, they will at least heal at the end of every battle slowly.\r<br />\r<br />The affected NPCs will have regular follower dialogue even all VOICE TYPES such as Guards&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I made a new Follow Package so they interact with environment more.\r<br />\r<br />Recast the spell on the affected NPC to dismiss them.\r<br />\r<br />If you have more than 9 (Maximum amount), then a menu will pop up in which you can replace and remove followers.\r<br />\r<br />BTW, if you want to use this mod to get BANDITS or other HOSTILE NPCs, use I Yield&#33; I Yield&#33; by MrPieman. (This mod should&#39;ve been implemented into the game in the first place&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />Once any hostile NPC yield (fall to the ground) they will get up friendly and you can use spell and PROFIT. You can also use calm spell or shout, I used &#34;Voice of the Emperor&#34; as an Imperial and got to calm a few bandits for followers.\r<br />\r<br />I Yield&#33; I Yield&#33;:\r<br />\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=151200916\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please endorse and share it&#33; I worked real hard on it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />-jedijosh920\r<br />",
