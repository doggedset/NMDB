  "descriptionHtml": "*** Re-uploaded because of a site bug which removed my comments on the file***\r\n\r\nTraps are pretty lame in Skyrim, while they are pretty decent at lower levels, at higher levels they are a joke. This mods tries to change that by making traps more deadly. It does this by simply increasing the damage traps do, making them more deadly than they where before. This way you should need to be more carefull when exploring dungeons. :)\r\n\r\nThere are limits as of now though. So far i can only change magic effects and spells, meaning that for example, fire traps and dart traps, have their damage increased and are affected. However, without the construction kit i can NOT change physical traps as of yet, meaning that for example, spike traps or spike walls, remain unchanged. I hope to adress this once the construction kit is here or when SkyEdit is able to change this.\r\n\r\nFor now though, enjoy being killed by a trap every once and again. :)\r\n",
