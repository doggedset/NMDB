  "descriptionHtml": "[b][i][u]~Gzashnalbur Stronghold~[/u][/i]\r<br />\r<br />First things first.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This is a Vanilla/Original Skyrim only Mod and there is no plans for a Special Edition in any future as I do not own that version of Skyrim nor plan to.\r<br />\r<br />This Mod Is highly recommended to be activated once you have done [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Pieces_of_the_Past][u][color=#0066cc]Pieces of the Past[/color][/u][/url] Mission (the one where you get &#34;Mehrune&#39;s Razor&#34;\r<br />\r<br />It basically places a number of Orc Guards, Civilians as well A Chief in the inner/upper fort area as well a number of small bed roles for the NPCs to make use of.\r<br />\r<br />They all have default sandbox AI at this point & they also have their own FaceGen data so no pesky gray face bugs here.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Feel free to enhance/mod revamp to your whim.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I created this little mod for my Orc playthough as I felt once you cleared out all the hostile Orcs in this place and walked around for any last min looting, I figured &#34;Boy, this sure would be a nice little Orc stronghold&#34; instead of another emptied dungeon waiting a month or so to be have a respawn of bandits or so.\r<br />\r<br />So Gznashnalbur was formed. \r<br />\r<br />[i][u]Conflicts[/u][/i] \r<br />\r<br />Only anything that edit&#39;s Crack Tusk Keep&#39;s interior names & Map Marking name really.\r<br />It may cause a issue with NPCS that are in and outside the fort. The Bandits will very likely fight the Gzashnalbur residents though will likely not win as each NPC is atleast lvl 25 up to 40. \r<br />\r<br />I tried to duplicate the Stronghold factions so the Orc Guard & Npcs should enforce the Orc Stronghold rules and thus.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is essentially to add more Orcish flavour for all those Orcs out there or Orc fans.",
