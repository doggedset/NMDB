  "summary": "Add Lake Port Riften near MerryFair Farm.\r\nThe town includes Bars/Black-smith weaponary/Some houses. \r\nAlso Lore-Friendly Riften people live there.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This location MOD is as follows;\r\n\r\nIntention of my mod (You dont have to read this part. ^ ^):\r\nAt first place (After few weeks of release of the Skyrim), I wanted to make town citizens (such as Ysolda/Ingun Blair/Rorik... etc) to follow me. and also I want the same thing from some special NPCs who cannot be follower due to the key-quest giver (Balgraaf/Ulfric/Tulius/Mercer... etc).\r\n\r\nSo I made several crones of them by the CK for my own use. still I felt alittle bit hollow just put my NPCs in the town or somewhere, so I decided to make some town where my Lore-base followers can live. \r\n\r\nIn a sense this town mod itself is my home (or i would like rather to say Player\\'s home ^ ^). When we want some help from the citizens of my mod, we can point them and type \\\"bat friend\\\" (in the console). And I made them various types of combat(1 handed/2 handed/ Dual/ Element/ Con). They are not essential but they are Re-spawning NPCs.\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n1. Lake-port town. \r\n=========================\r\nThe town is connected to Skyrim world by a Loading-door.\r\nThe loading door is very near the MerryFair Farm. (Map marker added)\r\nI show you the place in the pic.\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n2. Town includes the followings.\r\n=========================\r\nLake-port Town\r\n\\\\\\\\ Cafe bar (Alchemy sign)\r\n--> Port for harvesting\r\n--> Alchemy ingredients cave (mainly mushes/flowers/Nirn)\r\n--> Fire atronach cave (mainly for Fire saults)\r\n--> Ice wrath cave (mainly for Ice wrath tooth)\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ Wine bar (Winking skeever sign)\r\n--> A Door in the basement (will be some quests-like)\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ Mead bar \r\n--> Door to the Empress port (will be some quests-like)\r\n--> 2 Doors (will be some quests-like)\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ Black smith\r\n--> Port for mining\r\n--> Armo-ores mine (somehow the Ore-activater doesnt work,,,, will fix this)\r\n--> Jewel-ores mine (somehow the Ore-activater doesnt work,,,, will fix this)\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ House 001\r\nContains House-Carls \r\n--> A Door in the basement (will be some quests-like)\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ House 002\r\nContains Rift people\r\n--> A Door in the basement (will be some quests-like)\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n3. Rift people ready to follow\r\n=========================\r\n3.1 Stats of Town NPCs\r\nI set town people (such as Companions/ DB initiates/ Thieves members/ Colledge mages/ etc.. ) to be ready to fight by giving them many useful combat perks/skills/spells. \r\nSo when they level according to your char level,  they will be able to cast strong spells/ to manuver skills.\r\nI will list up all the stats of them later, but if you open my mod by the Creation Kit, you can see the stats by searching with a keyword \\\"MHMK001\\\" in the Actor tree.\r\n\r\n3.2 How to have town NPCs follow you\r\nIf you want my town people follow you as a Follower, use my optional BAT FILE.\r\nI suppose you know how to use a BAT FILE, though,,,,\r\nOr make a BAT file by yourself by including the following sentences;\r\n\r\nsetrelationshiprank player 4\r\naddfac 19809 1\r\naddfac 5c84d 1\r\naddfac 5a1a4 1\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n4. About Gray-faced NPCs\r\n=========================\r\nI put FaceGen file in Optional, so please put the folder in your;\r\nData\\\\\\\\textures\\\\\\\\actors\\\\\\\\character\\\\\\\\FaceGenData\\\\\\\\FaceTint> \r\n\r\n=========================\r\n5. About replica Airship (;o;).\r\n=========================\r\nIt just stay there...\r\nThe biggest Airship is named Empress.\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n6. Known problems\r\n=========================\r\n- Somehow the Ore-rocks in the mine dont activate at all... \r\ni will find some solution for this. or i wil change the cave to different ones.\r\n\r\n- When you use my BAT file to a follower in the mist-heavy place like in the bar,\r\nfirst \\\"disable\\\" the fog/mist, then use the \\\"bat friend\\\". \r\n\r\n=========================\r\n7. My other mod\r\n=========================\r\n- Marians Splash Markarth\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18507\r\n\r\n- Marians usual tools\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18854\r\n\r\n- Marians Pirates Coast Solitude\r\nWIP...\r\n\r\n- Marians Spa Windhelm\r\nWIP...\r\n\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n6. Lastly\r\n=========================\r\nThis is my first MOD, sorry for the inconveniences in DLing or other things...\r\n\r\nInitially this mod was for my own use, so i made this with my taste.\r\nBut as long as i upload the mod, i always listen to your advice/opinion. ^ ^\r\n\r\n\r\n<<<< Updates Planning >>>\r\n\r\n- Add several places like Raid type catsles/dungeons/strong-holds.\r\n- Add short mining/gathering dungeon\r\n- Add Player\\'s Rest House in the town (Ratway type)\r\n- Add more activities to Town people\r\n\r\n- And some suggestions from you ~~~~ o/ o/\r\n(Though i am humble modder, so Quests kinda are out of range T_T)",
