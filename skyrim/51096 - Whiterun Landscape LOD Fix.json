  "summary": "Fixes the buggy exterior LOD from within Whiterun.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever stood inside one of Whiterun&#39;s wall towers and looked at the empty ditch where there should be a stream and wonder why nobody&#39;s fixed it yet? I have, so I did. This probably wouldn&#39;t be an issue for most people, but when you use a great city overhaul like Dawn of Whiterun, or a home like Blackwalk Tower, (which this mod was specifically made for) the empty ditch really becomes a major annoyance. So I dug around in the Creation Kit and came up with this stupidly simple fix by placing a few water meshes into the riverbed. As stated above, I use this fix myself for Dawn of Whiterun and the Whiterun Museum and Blackwalk Tower mods, so I know that it is 100% compatible with both of them, as well as vanilla Whiterun if you choose to keep it basic. It SHOULD be compatible with any other mod since it changes so little in such an unused area, but if you find any bugs be sure to let me know so that I can get to work on fixing it.",
