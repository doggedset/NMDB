If you are traipsing about with 10 people, you should probably ask them to wait for you outside. And mostly as an experiment, I used Grimoa&#39;s fine painting frame resources to try and make a couple of mirrors. They are basically just paintings, so you won&#39;t actually see yourself, but I think they add a nice touch.\r<br />\r<br />Here is the list of buildings with changing rooms: \r<br />01- The White Hall (Dawnstar)\r<br />02- Jarl&#39;s Longhouse (Falkreath) \r<br />03- Understone Keep (Markarth)\r<br />04- Blue Palace (Morthal)\r<br />05- Mistveil Keep (Riften)   \r<br />06- Blue Palace (Solitude)   \r<br />07- Dragonsreach (Whiterun)    \r<br />08- Palace of the Kings (Windhelm) \r<br />09- Jarl&#39;s Longhouse (Winterhold) \r<br />\r<br />When you enter any of these buildings, look to your left, and you&#39;ll see the trapdoors. Since I am making changes to the interiors (even if it&#39;s just a trapdoor), this mod will probably not be compatible with other mods that make changes to the Jarls&#39; dwellings.\r<br />\r<br />To install, place the files in your &#39;SteamSteamAppsCommonSkyrimData&#39; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. \r<br />\r<br />Now, for the credits:\r<br />- Painting frame resource by [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10963/]Grimoa[/url]\r<br />- Mirror texture by [url=http://rcdezine.deviantart.com/art/Glass-Texture-350473344]RCDezine[/url]\r<br />- Wood texture from [url=http://wallpoper.com/wallpaper/wood-textures-248249]Walloper[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
