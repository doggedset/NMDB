I&#39;ll add more models and textures to the pack as I go.\r<br />\r<br />Now includes 10 rugs and 16 tapestries. \r<br />\r<br />Feel free to upload (appropriate) pictures of these in your mods so people can see what they look like in game..because i&#39;m to lazy to do it myself.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />As always if you encounter any issues with anything in this pack contact my supervisor, and we will resolve you issue in an almost certainly unsatisfactory manner in a few months. :)",
