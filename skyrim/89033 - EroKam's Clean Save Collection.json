  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]Hello Nexus users! This is a collection of clean saves (no mods used) that I have made because I got tired of having to re-do certain questlines every single time I want to start a new character, or have a problem with another mod, etc. This collection is very much in progress and more saves will be added to it soon!\n<br />\n<br />If you have a custom save that you would like for me to make for you (ie. Certain questlines with certain paths taken, guilds done or not done, various levels of completion, etc) then please let me know and I will get it done as soon as possible!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]\n<br />[color=#ff0000]***As of the moment, all saves require Skyrim: Legendary Edition with all of the DLCs or they will not work!!Â [/color][/b]\n<br />[/size]",
