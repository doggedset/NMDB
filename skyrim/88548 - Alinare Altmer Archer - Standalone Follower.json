  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3]This isn't Technically my fist mod, But it's my first mod that took actual work. I've done RaceMenu Presets in the past to gain experience modding (but mainly to acquire a presence here on the Nexus). If you are at all interested in those, they can be found [url=https://rd.nexusmods.com/users/41281005?tab=user+files]here[/url] on my profile.[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/110/41281005-1514078094.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3]Alinare, as previously stated, is an Altmer Archer who can be found in the winking skeever. \n<br />Her armor and Bow are powerful (but not OP) unique enchanted Items. [/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3]\n<br />Backstory:\n<br />Alinare was born some 200 years ago in Firsthold, Auridon, just after the catastrophe of the Oblivion Crisis. She is a indirect descendant of the High Kinlords of the Rilis bloodline, and was combat trained within the First Auridon Marines. Alinare would soon move to Chorrol, Cyrodiil to escape internal conflicts within Alinor, but those conflicts would soon find her again in the Great War. Alinare joined the 7th Imperial legion and fought in the desperate Battle of Red Ring. \n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3]After the signing of the Concord of White-Gold, she moved to Solitude, Skyrim to escape the Aldmeri Dominion controlled government bureaucrats. But her nature is to fight, and a boring idle life isn't within her tastes. She wishes to be back on a battlefield where she belongs, and if that means carrying around a few dragonbones and delving into dangerous ruins she'd have never dared set foot in before, so be it.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/110/41281005-1514078228.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3]Alinare is a standalone follower, so she has no requirements. All necessary mod files are included with the Main File. \n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3]This isn't completely standalone, You WILL NEED XP32 or any other HDT-enabled skeleton for Alinare to work. You will encounter CTDs when she equips her armor unless you have a skeleton installed.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/110/41281005-1514078259.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3]Plug-and-play. Simply shove the file into NMM and it will handle the rest. If for some reason you want to manual Install (which is not recommended), Simply unpack the file into your skyrim directory (data folder is included in the file).\n<br />\n<br />Theoretically this should work for Skyrim Special Edition as well, however I personally don't play it or mod it, so I'm uncertain. If you want to try it out, feel free, just don't blame me if/when your game breaks.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/110/41281005-1514092335.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35267/]SG Textures Renewal UNP[/url] - For the amazing skin texture.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311]KS Hairdos - Renewal[/url] - For Alinare's Hair (Paradox)\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2205977]Author[/url] of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69562/]Remodeled Armor for UUNP BodySlide HDT[/url]﻿ and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2442809]ChronoTrigger77[/url]﻿ - For giving me permission to use their Elven Light Armor Mesh\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49015]BodySlide and Outfit Studio[/url]﻿ - For giving me the tools needed to make this possible\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/571605]Author[/url] of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23125]aMidianBorn Elven Armor[/url]﻿ - For giving me permission to use these amazing textures\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624]RaceMenu[/url]﻿ - for giving me the tools needed to make this possible\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/110/41281005-1514078293.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3]The mods I credited and...\n<br />[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[font=Tahoma][color=#ffffff][size=3]Pretty Motion Collection - For the screenshot poses\n<br />\n<br />Facelight Plus - for the screenshot lighting\n<br />\n<br />The FNIS collection of mods - For HDT and some poses included in Pretty Motion\n<br />\n<br />The HDT Collection of mods - For HDT (obviously)[/size][/color][/font]",
