  "descriptionHtml": "So yeah, I went to visit a friends house for the weekend and while he was at work during the day I decided to jump on his Skyrim and make a new character. I decided with an Orc and gave him a backstory about how he hates most other races apart from Female Orcs etc. I enjoyed this save more then I should of and ended up getting him to around level 7 without advancing the story at all. He currently has full Steel armor and an Orcish Greatsword, with all his perks set into Two=Handed and Heavy Armor. \r\n\r\nThis save is for others to enjoy killing everything with an Orc without feeling the need to advance the story. In fact it\\'s better if you don\\'t. He isn\\'t some \\'mystical dragonborn\\'. He\\'s a fucking ruthless Orc, born n\\' bred.",
