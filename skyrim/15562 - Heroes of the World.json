  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Arial]The mod &#34;Skyrim - Equipment of Heroes&#34; adds three sets of armour with a fitting weapon to the game. In addition to that, you get three companions that would have worn a specific set of armour with the weapon.\r<br />\r<br />=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=\r<br />\r<br />v1.0 - Original release (20th of april, 2012):\r<br />\r<br />Added to Solitude&#39;s Blue Palace is the chest of Gaius Julius Caesar, containing his armour and weapon. Walking around the Blue Palace is the Roman hero himself. Caesar is a companion to the player.\r<br />\r<br />Added to Whiterun&#39;s Dragonsreach is the chest of Perseus, son of Zeus, which contains his armour and weapon. Walking near the back door of Dragonsreach is the Greek hero himself. Perseus is a companion to the player.\r<br />\r<br />Added to the barracks of Windhelm&#39;s Palace of Kings is the chest of Vercingetorix, containing his armour and weapon. Walking around the barracks is the Gallic hero himself. Vercingetorix is a companion to the player.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />All chests are player-owned, allowing you to freely take the items. All pieces of armour, maybe with the exception of Caesar&#39;s armour, fit both men and women. All added armour and weapons can be improved and the required materials for each improvement reside in the chests.\r<br />\r<br />[b]THIS VERSION IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />-     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -\r<br />\r<br />v1.1 - Update:\r<br />\r<br />Added a unique bow to every hero of old, plus a unique set of arrows to go with the bow.\r<br />\r<br />The weapons are no longer restricted to the player only. You should now be able to equip a random companion with them.\r<br />\r<br />[b]THIS VERSION IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />-     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -\r<br />\r<br />v1.2 - Update(s) (24th of may, 2016):\r<br />\r<br />Changed the file name from &#34;Skyrim - Equipment of Heroes&#34; to &#34;Heroes of the World&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />This mod&#39;s category has been changed from &#34;Weapons and armour&#34; to the proper category &#34;Followers&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />New installation requirement. As of the v1.2 release, you will need the Dawnguard DLC as well.\r<br />\r<br />Weapons and armour enchantments from the heroes of old have been revisited to make them far less overpowered. Any magical damage effect that was previously present on their weapons (Fire, frost and/or shock) has been removed.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Four new companion NPCs have been added to the mod, two of which you&#39;ll have to find on your own. As for the ones I will tell you about... The first one is Meridia&#39;s champion Apollo Dawnbreaker, located at Mount Kilkreath. The second one is a dual war axe wielding human armageddon by the name of Juliana the Bonecrusher, located at the Orc stronghold of Largashbur in the Rift hold. As for the grand surprise, the clues you&#39;ll need to find the last two companion NPCs can be found inside Riverwood&#39;s Sleeping Giant Inn. Just have a good look around. When you find the clues, you find the last two companion NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />Added a new Imperial camp. Repeat, a new Imperial camp. The soldiers and their commander(s) have yet to be created, but that wasn&#39;t vital in order to release the v1.2 update of this mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]IMPORTANT:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I haven&#39;t created the proper LOD files for the new structure in this mod yet. The mod itself is very much playable as always, just remember that while the LOD hasn&#39;t been generated the objects of this structure *might* pop up on your screen when you approach it.\r<br />\r<br />=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=[/font]",
