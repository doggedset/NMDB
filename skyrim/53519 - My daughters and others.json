  "descriptionHtml": "You may be asking who these two are, they are my real life daughters.  They love it when I play and always want me to adopt Lucia and Sofie and then they pretend to each be one of them.  So I just changed their names to match my girls and they smile big when they see it.  This is my first mod as well, I know it&#39;s not much but I have more things in the pipeline for mods so wish me luck.\r<br />\r<br />Lucy Ellen can be found in Whiterun and Carly Jo can be found in Windhelm.\r<br />\r<br />Requires full game with hearthfire DLC.\r<br />Thanks to my wonderful girls for the inspiration.\r<br />\r<br />Future plans are to add more children as well.\r<br />Changed name to reflect future plans.",
