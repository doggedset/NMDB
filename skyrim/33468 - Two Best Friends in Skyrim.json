  "descriptionHtml": "16/04/2013: Update. If any of the guys has the grey face bug in your game then download my recently added \\'facegen\\' file and follow the instructions in the description for it. That should solve the problem.\r\n\r\n05/04/2013: Update\r\n(YOU MAY NEED TO START A NEW GAME FOR THESE CHARACTERS TO WORK PROPERLY)\r\nThe new version is finally ready. Simply download the Super Best Friends in Skyrim file. I would recommend deleting the old file first if you have it. \r\nThis new version adds Woolie to the mix as well as all of the custom voices for the three guys.\r\nTo use all 3 at the same time I would recommend downloading the UFO (Ultimate Follower Overhaul) mod as I have tested them with this.\r\nKnown glitches: When using them with UFO it becomes impossible to dismiss them after asking them to follow you. Also if you \\'ask them to do something\\' and get them to wait somewhere the \\'follow me\\' command doesn\\'t seem to work. \r\nWhen I can find fixes for these issues I will update the mod.\r\nBig shout out to Matt Pat and Woolie for recording the dialogue for this mod and being really great sports. Check them out here  http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSw1tcher and here https://www.facebook.com/#!/tbfprulz\r\nAlso a very big thank you to Nichevo and his tutorial on how to add voices to Skyrim. Without his help I wouldn\\'t have been able to do this. Check the tutorial out here http://deck16.net/post/22645519500/making-a-unique-voiced-follower-in-skyrim-part-1\r\n\r\nOriginal Version:\r\nThis mod adds Matt and Pat from Two Best Friends Play as followers to Skyrim \r\nMatt comes equipped with a fire axe and Pat with a high frequency blade. \r\nYou\\'ll find them at the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. \r\n\r\nFuture updates will add their voices too! Trust me you will love it!\r\n\r\nCredits: The face textures used here are from the High Res Face Maps for Men mod by Geonox. \r\nCheck it out at the link below and give him your support :)\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4141",
