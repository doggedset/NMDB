  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Hello Folks&#33; This is S&#39;Rawl Vasa (Rains Underneath) and he is my first follower mod&#33;\r<br />[/b]\r<br />He is found in the Winking Skeever. He is a Punchcat that follows Rahjin the god of the hunt. He is Snarky and puts himself above others. He has custom equipment And is meant to fight with his gauntlets.(Just some edited vanilla equipment)\r<br />\r<br />He has most of the Basic voice dialogues working (had combat but for some reason it wants to mess up) and you have to put something in his inventory to activate his equipment.\r<br />\r<br />[b]He Does NOT Require ANY DLCs or Mods. Â As he currently is he IS compatible with UFO and AFT. IF ANYONE HAS TIPS FEEL FREE TO GIVE ME THEM SO I CAN REDO SOME OF HIS DIALOGUE[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I plan to continue work on him and maybe even add more lore if people like him. If you have any (Positive or improvement) comments or critiques feel free to leave them in the comments. Thanks&#33; Also Rate my khajiit voice ^_^\r<br />\r<br />[b]I Can Only Improve with Feedback&#33;&#33;&#33; If you try him out please leave feedback. Also I am working on actual textures for his uniques I just havent gotten them done yet&#33;[/b]",
