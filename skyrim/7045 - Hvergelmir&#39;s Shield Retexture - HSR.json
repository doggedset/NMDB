The new textures will be double (200% width, 200% height) the size of the original textures that show a lot more detail than vanilla textures ever did. With additional detail work and highly detailed normal maps, each armor piece will truly come to live and actually look authentic and realistic.\r<br />\r<br />This is a separated side mod based on [url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3261]Hvergelmir&#39;s Armor Retexture - HAR[/url]. It was decided the separate the shields from the armor retexture project for several reasons. It is still highly recommended to use [url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3261]Hvergelmir&#39;s Armor Retexture - HAR[/url] alongside Hvergelmir&#39;s Shield Retexture - HSR, but not necessarily required.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3261]Hvergelmir&#39;s Armor Retexture - HAR[/url] is first and foremost a high-quality retexture mod, but it is also a realism mod. That means when I see fit I&#39;ll make subtle changes to the original texture to give it more true earth-colors or change some of the material to other material. A good example here is how I changed the silver ornamental parts of the Iron Armor sets to bronze instead. It is (in real life) unrealistic that a warrior wearing the cheapest heavy armor set available will have silver ornamentals on his armor, instead (at least for Vikings), it was more common to have bronze ornamentals. Only the richest of people could afford silver and only kings and people of high importance could afford gold - I know that these metals are easier to come by in this game, but it is still my way to add realism to the game.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3261]Hvergelmir&#39;s Armor Retexture - HAR[/url] is for all races and genders, without exception.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://lthot.dk/har/current_progress.png[/img]\r<br />Please note that I work in a specific order from low to high tier shields as seen on this list, but even more importantly I follow the list on [url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3261]Hvergelmir&#39;s Armor Retexture - HAR[/url], this list is secondary.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://lthot.dk/har/progress_shields.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />That concludes the full shield list, including unique and artifacts. If there are something missing here, feel free to enlighten me - just make sure the item doesn&#39;t use the same texture as any other item on the list.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://lthot.dk/har/installation_and_uninstallation.png[/img]\r<br />It is recommended to install Hvergelmir&#39;s Shield Retexture - HSR with Nexus Mod Manager, it simplifies the process greatly and also makes it simple to uninstall again if needed.\r<br />\r<br />To manually install Hvergelmir&#39;s Shield Retexture - HSR, use either WinRar or 7zup to extract the files to: [b]Steamsteamappscommonskyrim[/b]\r<br />If asked to override, click yes. Please keep in mind this will override any other shield (re)textures you currently have installed.\r<br />\r<br />To manually uninstall Hvergelmir&#39;s Shield Retexture - HSR, delete the armor folder inside textures found here: [b]Steamsteamappscommonskyrimdatatexturesarmor[/b]\r<br />Please keep in mind this will delete any other shield and armor (re)textures you currently have installed. If you know what you&#39;re doing you can enter the armor folder and delete each shield manually as you see fit.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://lthot.dk/har/distribution_permission.png[/img]\r<br />You may not under any circumstances use my textures for a mod of your own without my explicit written permission.\r<br />If you see this mod distributed at any other place than on SkyrimNexus that is NOT found in the mirrors list, it is being distributed illegally. Please contact me here if you find such case. If the website is in a foreign language that you speak, it would be of great help for me if you contacted them yourself and notified them of this on my behalf.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://lthot.dk/har/additional_information.png[/img]\r<br />[url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3261]Hvergelmir&#39;s Armor Retexture - HAR[/url] is my first public released TES mod. I have previously done personal retexturing jobs for Morrowind and Oblivion (though nothing major).\r<br />Some of you may notice the above average quality of my texture mod, there&#39;s a simple explanation for that. I&#39;m a professional graphic designer and artist. I am also a system developer though it is irrelevant in this connection.\r<br />I appreciate any help and ideas you may have to improve this mod - just don&#39;t bomb me with your personal preferences and concerns. This is my mod after all, and I&#39;ll be doing it my way.\r<br />\r<br />I am open to suggestions and collaboration work on other mods, got any great ideas feel free to contact me. My strong side is mainly (re)texturing, but I am flexible and should be suitable for other jobs.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#af8c46][b]My other mods:[/b][/color]\r<br />[url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3261]Hvergelmir&#39;s Armor Retexture - HAR[/url]\r<br />Hvergelmir&#39;s Shield Retexture - HSR\r<br />[url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=14003]Hvergelmir&#39;s Redesigned Housecarls - HRH[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Read my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=30027]profile page[/url] if you want to know more about me.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://lthot.dk/har/footer_hsr.png[/img]",
