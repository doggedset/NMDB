  "descriptionHtml": "[size=+5][center][b][color=green]SkyFall Sanctuary WIP[/color][/b][/center][/size]\r<br />[size=+2][color=white]SkyFall Sanctuary is a player home located just outside of Riverwood, across from the mill. You will see a big Nordic temple with statues and torches outside the door. SkyFall Sanctuary adds a whole new cave as well as a player home. Inside the cave you will find various merchants including a fence, a bard, and a follower as well as all of your crafting needs. There is also storage out side of the house that is labeled as well as your very own 13 Standing Stones. This has a very Nordic theme to it, so if you play as a Nord, this home might be right up your ally. \r<br />=============================================================================================\r<br />Remember this is a work in progress so please, if you find any bugs shoot me a PM and Ill try to get it fixed ASAP. I appreciate every single download as this is my first mod.\r<br />=============================================================================================\r<br />SkyFall Sanctuary has assets from Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn, those DLCs will be required or you will get a CTD upon game startup. Also, SKSE or any other mods are not required.[/color][/size]\r<br />[line]\r<br />[size=+1][color=cyan]Thanks so much for 100 downloads&#33; Version 1.0.2 coming soon&#33;[/color][/size]\r<br />[line]\r<br />Bug Fixes in Version 1.0.1:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Fixes issue where followers were not able to go into the cave or the home\r<br />[*]Fixes issue where random Nordic temples were spawned in random areas of the map.\r<br />[*]Improves NavMesh\r<br />[*]Fills some void space\r<br />[*]Fixes issue where some users had grey faces\r<br />[/list]",
