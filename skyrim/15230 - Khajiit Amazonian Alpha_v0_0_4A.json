  "descriptionHtml": "This is a work in progress. \r\nv0.0.4A Update\r\nQuite a few changes in this update. Added some custom perks, one works for sure, the other one is iffy due to the lack of CK knowledge I have and is still in the process of working properly. \r\n\r\n[Note]:Please give me feedback on your opinions, thoughts, and complaints. If you guys find anything wrong or have issues with certain things please give me a heads up so I can fix them. \r\n\r\nWe\\'ve taken away both perks and abilities for using Light and Heavy armor, adding Alteration instead, giving her Mage Armor. Her starting gear still has their enchants but I\\'ve removed their armor titles, i.e. Light and or Heavy to none due to her Mage Armor skill now.\r\n\r\nv0.0.3A Update\r\nFixed her class. Should properly level the correct skills. Please take note, for the first five levels be sure not to give her a one-handed weapon, we want her two-handed skill to level higher then her one-handed; eventually making her using it more then a one-handed weapon. If you don\\'t then she\\'ll almost never use her 2H. I\\'d advise to not let her touch a 1H for the first ten levels but you guys can do whatever.\r\n\r\nv0.0.2A Update\r\nLargely modified. Testing build, not official. In this build she uses 2H for Close Range and Shield and Spell for Long to Mid-Range. Please note, it is preferred to not give her a One-Handed Weapon at this time, her perks and skills revolve around a Two-Handed weapon (preferred Mace) and using Spell w/ Shield.\r\n\r\nv0.0.2 Update\r\nHad to quickly rename all her files into Khajiit Amazonian so everything registered correctly. This should fix the earlier version I posted. Sorry for the trouble and confusion.\r\n\r\n::Note::\r\nThe armor and one accessory (ring) are for testing purposes only; they are end-game enchanted Fornsworn armor, modified as Heavy Armor. This will be entirely nerfed once I\\'ve fixed her playstyle a bit more.\r\n\r\nHer name isn\\'t finalized ether.\r\n\r\n:::Level:::\r\nShe\\'s set to level with you to the PC cap.\r\n\r\n::::Class::::\r\nAmazon Spellshield\r\n\r\n::::Skills::::\r\n::Primary Skills::\r\nBlock\r\nDestruction\r\nTwo-Handed\r\n::Secondary Skills::\r\nRestoration\r\nAlteration\r\nConjuration\r\nBow\r\n:::::Details(New Alpha v0.0.3A):::::\r\nThere have been drastic changes to this followers play style from the very first one I did. Her class is hard to put into a category honestly. If I could describe her she\\'d be classified as a Spellshield Shaman, she uses a shield and one-handed spells almost always. When she runs out of mana she usually brings out her giant two-handed weapon. As of right now her main skills are as follow... Blocking, Two-Handed, Alteration, and Destruction; Secondary Skills are Restoration, Conjuration, and Archery.\r\n\r\nFor the build right now, she\\'s built around two-handed maces, but this will change and I\\'ll be putting up a number of two-handed choices that are available in game right now. Down the road she\\'ll probably be going spears... if it ever comes out.\r\n:::::Details(Old Alpha v0.0.1):::::\r\nUltimately I wanted a follower that had an arrange of abilities and fighting styles. She\\'s efficient in Destruction, Conjuration, Heavy Armor and One-Handed. Her secondary skills are Blocking, Restoration, and Archery (not implemented yet). For the time being shes over-powered for at least Easy and Normal difficulty of the game and just a tad over-powered in Hard; I haven\\'t tried Master difficulty yet because I\\'m bad at video games, so Master difficulty testing will be done much later in the future. Every day she has a chance of using her Avoid Death perk with a few tweaks, allowing her stamina and magicka regenerate at 20% increase rate.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve made it so that she SHOULD be more versatile in combat... i.e.\r\n\r\nExtremely Long Range - Long Range\r\n- Bow\r\nLong Range to Mid\r\n- Dual Casting to Spell/Shield or Spell/Sword\r\nMid to Close Range\r\n- Spell and Shield/Sword to Sword and Shield\r\n\r\nWhen faced more then two enemies she\\'ll USUALLY bring out a familiar and 4 out of 10 times will only use Ice Spear and Shield when fighting dragons.\r\n\r\nThe above scenario/formula isn\\'t guaranteed to happen in every encounter -- being that this is my first mod and I have so little knowledge of the Creation Kit, all  I\\'ve done is simply manipulated game mechanics; forcing her to use certain items and spells a certain way. Ultimately I would like to figure out a way to set certain playstyles for her when shes fighting certain enemies\r\n\r\n:::::::::::::::::::::Background Story(?)::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\r\nFound and raised by a faraway Orc Clan. When she came of age she decided to explore what Tamriel had to offer and to discover where she came from.\r\n\r\n::::::Recommended and Required Mods::::::\r\nFor the Khajiit Amazonian I\\'m using a few visual mods to make her look half-way decent.\r\n\r\nUNP Female Armors - UNP Female Armors v1\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7305\r\nCovereyes\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869\r\nOfficial Khajiit Body Textures for CBBE v3\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666#content\r\n\r\nI\\'m also using a number of improved companion modifications in order for her to act the way she does. (Will Update the list, need to find the mods first -- manually installed them)\r\n\r\nBetter Followers\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7554\r\nUFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14037\r\n\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of what she does; she\\'s a combination of three followers already in the vanilla Skyrim\r\n\r\nAranea Ienith\r\nhttp://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Aranea_Ienith\r\nJ\\'zargo\r\nhttp://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:J%27zargo\r\nand\r\nMjoll the Lioness\r\nhttp://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mjoll_the_Lioness\r\n\r\nPlease check back with me for more updates on her in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe doesn\\'t have a weapon or shield unfortunately at this time, still experimenting with weapons and items.\r\n\r\n!!!!FEEDBACK IS GREATLY APPRECIATED!!!!",
