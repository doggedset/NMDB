  "descriptionHtml": "Restocks Arnleif and Sons Trading company to make it look more like a Business.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve always wanted to download a mod that fixed the look of the general merchant in Markarth. Before I made this mod I never really looked at this building as a shop, because it was so run down. Now (In my opinion) it looks like one of the best vanilla shops in Skyrim.\r\n\r\nSadly I\\'m not an expert at modding, so the items around the shop can\\'t be bought from the merchant inside, but my main aim for this mod was just to clean everything up.\r\n\r\nHope you like it!\r\n\r\n-I\\'ve removed all the cobwebs from the inside and outside of the building.\r\n-Everything I\\'ve placed is owned by the Arnleif and Sons Trading Company Faction.\r\n-I\\'ve changed most of the lighting inside the shop.\r\n\r\nIf you find any problems or have any recommendations please leave a comment and I\\'ll see what I can do.",
