  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\r<br />[font=Times New Roman][size=6][b]The Forests of Skyrim\r<br />[/b]\r<br />[/size][/font][font=Tahoma]I don&#39;t know about you, but when I first read about Skyrim in earlier games, I pictured a vast, untamed land full of\r<br />thick forests and woods. The sort of forests you could get lost in, like in Oblivion. Unfortunately in Skyrim, there are maybe only\r<br />[/font]two forests in the whole game you can really lose yourself in: Falkreath and The Rift, and both of those Holds have giant lakes in the middle&#33;\r<br />I&#39;m not sure why Bethesda was so afraid of trees, probably console limitations, but I&#39;ve gone through and added over 5000 new trees to the province.\r<br />This mod is highly modular, just download what holds you want to be changed. It should go without saying though that many mods are\r<br />going to be incompatible, especially housing mods, but I&#39;m more than willing to make compatibility patches for some of the more popular mods out there.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]The Reach[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />The Reach is the area that has undergone the most dramatic change with this mod. According the PGE, it supposedly looks very similar to the wild\r<br />highlands of Wayrest. I never imagined Wayrest, a very &#34;French&#34; land, to look so rocky and bare. Make no mistake, the Reach is still a craggy place full of\r<br />soaring mountains and juniper bushes, but now it too has mystical Falktreath-style forests and plenty of pines in the rocky river valleys.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Eastmarch[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Eastmarch always felt a tad bare to me. Yes, there are the sulfuric lakes and tar pits, but I felt like such a broad area needed some forestation.\r<br />I went for a Yosemite Park vibe, and hopefully it shows. New ground and grass textures are included to make Eastmarch look a little less dead.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Morthal[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Less of a forestation mod, and more of an alteration of an existing forest. I wanted morthal to look dead, but I didn&#39;t want to just flat out remove all\r<br />of the trees. So I simply replaced the vast green pines with the dead winter aspens from the Dawnguard DLC. The result is a very spooky moor.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please let me know what you think&#33;[/center]",
