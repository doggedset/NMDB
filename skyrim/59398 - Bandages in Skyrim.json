  "descriptionHtml": "Bandages 1.0 \r<br />\r<br />1.4 Added fortify rate recipes.\r<br />1.3 Reduced all bandages to weigh .2\r<br />1.2 Added Cure Disease and Cure Poison bandages which also contain 30s of Mag 100 resistance.  Renamed Energy and Mana to match Vitae for better sorting.\r<br />1.1 Added Clean bandages to tanning rack for those that didn&#39;t have them at the cooking pot.  Fixed spelling of &#39;Ultimate&#39;\r<br />1.0 Initial release.\r<br />No DLC required. \r<br />\r<br />Note - I know there are other bandage mods out there, but they either edit vanilla assets or are tied to character level.  This mod edits nothing and everything is availabe at level 1. \r<br />\r<br />Duration potions are for the most part fine, but have you ever thought that the way instant potions in Skyrim work was a bit overpowered?  I can go from the brink of death and with the push of a hotkey be back at the peak of health like Wolverine.  You get hit again?  Drink another potion in the blink of an eye.  I don&#39;t like this.  I didn&#39;t want to alter the default vanilla potions themselves as this can break quests and other mods so this mod was born. \r<br />\r<br />What this simple mod does is allow you to convert those instant potions into over time bandages.  Each bandage takes 30s to reach its full power.  I created bandages for each of the 6 levels of Restore Health, Magicka, and Stamina.  All you need are Linen Cloths (which are bountiful but all but useless until now) and the pre made Restore Health, Magicka, or Stamina potions.  Sorry, custom made potions are not supported.  \r<br />\r<br />All items are created at the cooking pot and are found under food.  Clean Bandages can also be crafted at the tanning rack.  First convert each Linen cloth into 10 clean bandages.  Then combine a clean bandage with any Restore potion to make a bandage.  Health bandages are called Vitae, Magicka are called Mana, and Stamina are called Energy.  To somewhat account for the loss of being instant each bandage is about 50% more effective than the potion used to make it as each bandage effect also contains the fortify rate effect for the 30s duration.  For instance, the default Minor Health potion heals 25 instantly.  The Novice Vitae Bandage heals 1 for 30s AND also fortifies Healing Rate by 50% for the 30s.  The Apprentice is 2 and 60%, Adept is 3 and 70%, Expert is 4 and 80%, Master is 5 and 100%, and Ultimate is 333 and 150&#33; \r<br />\r<br />The rare ultimate potions turned into bandages offer a nice feature as you will basically be unkillable with an Ultimate Vitae bandage for 30s.  With an Ultimate energy bandage you can power attack at will and with the Ultimate Mana bandage you can cast every spell without resorting to Enchanting cheats.  But these potions are very rare. \r<br />\r<br />My other Mods \r<br />Aetherium Sabers \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21294]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21294[/url] \r<br />Armored Robes and Cloth Armor \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50069]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50069[/url] \r<br />Call Animals \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58355]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58355[/url] \r<br />TMNT Expanded \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41494]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41494[/url] \r<br />Magicka Sabers Crystal (Earlier alternate version of Aetherium Sabers) \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10517]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10517[/url] \r<br />Drow Race - FR Lore Friendly (outdated) \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17458]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17458[/url]",
