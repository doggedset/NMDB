  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Georgia][color=#00ffff][size=6]Melrode Monastery[/size][/color][/font]\r<br />\r<br />To share along my love of Enderal, I&#39;ve decided to make another player home in the Goldenforst, in the far north-east of the country.\r<br />Melrode Monastery is a small and cozy settlement, with a suite which can serve as a player home for the Prophet. \r<br />Around the monastery are several NPCs to provide a lively atmosphere, and the structure itself may serve for quests to be made later on&#33; \r<br />Simple, fun, and immersive. \r<br />The previous tenant of the monastery, Keeper Myrrdin Dal&#39;Wylt, has left the key and will to his holdings somewhere in the monastery&#33;[/center][center]\r<br />\r<br />The player home contains:\r<br />- Several weapon racks, with 2 display cases in the suite\r<br />- Several lovely NPCs, including a priest to cure diseases\r<br />- A merchant with valuable wares and plenty of gold\r<br />- An immersive atmosphere and comfortable home to rest\r<br />- A unique location, which has for itself a new Teleportation Scroll\r<br />- No-respawn zone in the monastery, ensuring a safe storage location\r<br />- A history book and key to Keeper Dal&#39;Wylt&#39;s suite\r<br />Unfortunately, the monastery has very few crafting stations (at the moment), necessitating travel to Ark in order to craft your items.\r<br />At this point, the mod is pretty basic. If there are suggestions you have for this mod to grow, please voice them&#33;[/center]",
