  "summary": "The masks of Ahzidal, Dukaan and Zahkriisos without armor rating (converted into clothes)",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=50][b]1. Why I did this mod?[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />A mage, or the currently called &#34;pure mage&#34;, which is THE true Mage, doesn&#39;t use armor, or any piece that gives armor rating. So, Bethesda already destroyed the magic system removing spell creation, unbalanced the game&#39;s classes allowing overpowered warhammers, armors and swords and still, in the latest DLC, they give a ring which increases the Werewolf&#39;s damage by 50%, and gives a miserable 25% increased damage to Destruction spells, which already are weak, separately. As if that were not enough, they still put the enchantments in PIECES of ARMOR, the MASKS Ahzidal, Dukaan and Zahkriisos. This is an insult, a great insult for anyone who play as a Mage, so I considered it a &#34;bug&#34;, yes, a bug, and made a &#34;patch&#34; to correct the error.\r<br />\r<br />Tha masks now are how they should be, clothes. The three masks are now free to any true mage use, they are 100% tested and will not interfere with Ebonyflesh or any other mage armor spell. I didn&#39;t change the enchantments, so you will still deal miserable damage, but at least you can wear the masks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />PS: They are obviously not upgradable.\r<br />\r<br />PS: The weight of the masks was changed to 2.\r<br />\r<br />[size=50][b]2. How install[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />.esp file in Data Files, then mark it in Skyrim Launcher\r<br />\r<br />___\r<br />\r<br />Use the Lord Stone, my friend.",
