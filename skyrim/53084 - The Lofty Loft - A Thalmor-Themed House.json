This is, indeed, a little place I made with a Thalmor member in mind. If you don&#39;t like the idea, please keep your complaints to yourself.\r<br />\r<br />The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC, is fully navmeshed and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />This loft is located in Solitude, next to Fletcher. You&#39;ll find the key around the crops I put outside if you look carefully. It&#39;s a small house with one double bed, some weapon racks and bookcases, alchemy and enchanting stations, a weapon plaque, a mannequin, and safe storage in the house EXCEPT FOR THE BARRELS. Those WILL respawn&#33; There is a map marker for easy access, as well. Indeed I made this thinking of a member of the Thalmor, so I tried to give it a noble and luxurious look, with plenty of gold and jewels on display. I really like the end result, and maybe someone somewhere would like to use it as well, so here it is.\r<br />\r<br />As usual with me, I made most decorations and food statics to prevent the slightest bump from making a mess. There are several idle markers and a hand-made navmesh, so this house is compatible with mods such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045/?]My Home Is Your Home[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11370/?]Spouses Can Live Everywhere[/url]. \r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t come asking for a version without Thalmor stuff. If you don&#39;t like something, remove it with the console, TESEDIT or the Creation Kit, or just pretend you killed some Thalmor and are taking over their property... \r<br />\r<br />About compatibility, I am using several mods that edit Solitude and have not found any issues, but if you find a problem, please let me know so I can list it here.\r<br />\r<br />[b]UPDATE 19/April/2014:[/b] I implemented several aesthetic changes and ideas from skyf0rger. Thank you&#33; Now the house has a basement with a wine cellar/reading area and a bathtub that can be used to stay clean if you&#39;re using a mod such as [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29025/?]Drink Eat Sleep Bathe[/url]. Some of the bookcases are regular containers instead of actual bookcases because I didn&#39;t have room, so hopefully that will not be a problem. The house and basement now have their own location info to (hopefully) avoid issues with mods that change follower outfits according to their current location. I&#39;ve also packed up the resources into a .bsa file, so if you decide to update, delete the &#34;LoftyLoft&#34; folder from your Data/Meshes directory. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Now, for the credits:\r<br />\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/?]Modders Resource Pack[/url] by Oaristys and Tony67.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14133/?]FoodContainer[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14135]BookSets[/url] Resources by Blary.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36756/?]Berts Bits And Bobs[/url] by berticus0001.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34789]Strotis Castle Furniture Resource[/url] by Stroti and Tamira. \r<br />- [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1300-ready-clutter-and-furnishings/]Ready Clutter and Furnishings 1.1[/url] by Lilith.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18549/?]Painting resource for mods[/url] by jet4571.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24883/?]Morrowind Style Clutter and More[/url] by The_Funktasm.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26132/]Resources for modders[/url] by Runspect.\r<br />- [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1448-insanitys-bath-towels/]Bath Towels[/url] and [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1182-soap-resource/]Soap[/url] Resources by InsanitySorrow.\r<br />\r<br />Special thanks go to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3231858/?]Elianora[/url] for the gorgeous black bedding retexture and advice, and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Suggestiveleg]Nikki[/url] for the beautiful screenshots to use as paintings.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
