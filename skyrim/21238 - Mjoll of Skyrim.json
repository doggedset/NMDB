  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=5][color=lightblue][b]MJOLL OF SKYRIM[/b][/color][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n[b]- Nord Warrior 2H (battleaxes) Heavy Armor, Block, Archery\r\n- Essential\r\n- Crime: All, but will leave you if you have a bounty in Riften\r\n- can be Married\r\n- Auto-level up, now up to lvl.60[/b] (normally...)\r\n\r\nDefinitely one of the most likeable, liked & modded vanilla Followers of Skyrim, Mjoll had some annoying limitations and honestly, she could look better too.\r\n\r\nAfter trying a few Mjoll mods I decided to make my own from vanilla, because I wanted to implement some nice [color=yellow]Apachii Hairs[/color] to her model and change a few things.\r\nThe goal was to improve her for a long term use and a better look and keep her \\\"tough but childish\\\" face and \\\"walkyrie\\\" style - hence the scar and the chubby face!\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG from vanilla:\r\n\r\n- Changed warpaints + eyes + facetints (new face texture included) + nose, eye color, lips etc.\r\n- Changed Hairs for Apachii ones that fit better her status of Nordic Champion.\r\n- More perks: TwoHanded (Barbarian lvl2, Savage Strike), Juggernaut (Heavy armor), Ranger (bow) etc.\r\n- Levelling up: now she can level up to lvl.60 instead of 40. A small tweak but a major twist for advanced players. That makes her a long term companion. Normally she auto-levels up.\r\n\r\nNote: [b]She does use Savage Strike while charging on bosses[/b] and It\\'s really fun to watch!\r\n\r\nINSTALL:\r\n\r\n- Extract & Copy the .esp and the Textures folder\r\n- Drop them in your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\nRemove the copied files to uninstall.\r\n\r\nA great thanks to BETHESDA (of course) and to the creators of these mods:\r\n\r\n[b]REQUIRED[/b] - except if you want a bald Mjoll.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii SkyHair[/url] by Apachii.\r\n\r\n[b]RECOMMENDED[/b] - for the looks only. Not needed if you just want slightly improved perks & stats.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812]Better Females[/url] by Bella.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3574]Gizmodians Scars[/url] by Gizmodian and Xenius\r\n\r\nMjoll will not look excatly like the pictures I took without these mods, but the mod will work perfectly without them if you just want improved perks.\r\n\r\n[b]OPTIONAL[/b]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722]The Eyes of Beauty[/url] by LogRaam\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]Dimonized UNP Body[/url] by Dimon99\r\n\r\nFEEDBACK is always appreciated on the Comments section, as well as thoughful suggestions (ex: change warpaints? mix?) but no Trolling please.\r\n\r\n[b]OPTIONAL FILE ADDED:[/b] French Version - Version fran√ßaise.\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE:[/b] a special thanks to  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2996604]sumojellybean[/url]  for his inspiring work on Followers... and because I suck so much at modding that I still haven\\'t figured out how to change his vanilla hairs for the Apachii ones, so I open the CK & do my own mod from scratch... and change the whole Follower in the process!\r\n\r\nUPDATE from pics - just changed a bit the warpaints (no more double bars)\r\n\r\nWIP: I must change her default outfit (still vanilla) for a Ancient Nord gear & Dwemer Battleaxe. Right now the pics show what I equipped her with, including my modded BattleAxe, [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21039][b]Angrenost[/b][/url] - check it!",
