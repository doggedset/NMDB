  "descriptionHtml": "For those of you slightly frustrated by the lack of this deadly ingredient in-game...\r\n\r\nAdds a small satchel to the exterior of the Dawnstar Dark Brotherhood sanctuary, containing\r\n3 Jarrin Root, and a more potent modified version.\r\nThe modified version doesn\\'t use scripts or anything, it simply deals 250 damage every second for a minute, ensuring a nice, inevitable death.\r\n(The default Root deals a single dose of 200 damage.)\r\nOf course the modified version isn\\'t that necessary, I just felt cheated that I wasn\\'t killed outright by the default version (R.I.P. Poisoned Apple T_T)\r\nThe satchel respawns like any other loot container, so there\\'ll be a steady supply.\r\n\r\nThe stash is located just by the rock and tree slightly north of the Sanctuary door - See pics.\r\n\r\nAlternate high quantity (100 Root) version for those of you who couldn\\'t give a flying fig for realism.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nExtract DBJarrinRoot.esp to your Skyrim/Data folder, or you can use DBJarrinRoot HighQ.esp instead.\r\nThen select your chosen .esp in the Data Files section of Skyrim\\'s launcher.\r\n\r\nNMM: Will work with NMM but will not correctly extract the optional .esp, to use that simply find the DBJarrinRoot folder and manually place it in /data.",
