  "descriptionHtml": "This is a STANDALONE weapon it isn\\'t a replacer. \r\n\r\nHey guys thanks for visiting my mod. This is a Imperial Bronze Sword. It\\'s lighter, cheaper, and faster than the regualar one. It doesn\\'t do quite as much damage, but it has higher critical damage with higher chance for crit hit. As of right now it cannot be crafted, because I want to add bronze bars to the game first. It is however available for purchase at most vendors and temerperable with steel ignots for right now.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think in the comments below. I read all of them, so if you have a question or anything go for it.\r\n\r\nAgain thank you for checking out my mod :)",
