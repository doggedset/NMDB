  "summary": "Alters some shouts/adds new abilities/ Makes the shouting Dovahkiin truly one with the Thuum!",
  "descriptionHtml": "The Dovahkiin is a Mortal who is capable of using powerful shouts without long study of its ways. However, I found myself wanting the shouts to be more lethal/useful. So I created this mod which modifies the power of the shouts and actually wants to make you want to use the first 1 or 2 words in a shout, as they will have a unique ability such as Fus doing more damage than \\\"Fus Ro\\\" or \\\"Fus Ro Dah\\\"\r\n                                                   Currently In development, I have not finished adding unique abilities to ALL the shouts, which means that new versions will come up\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\nJust drop it Into your Data Folder and Activate the ESP. no textures, meshes or scripts! isn\\'t Bethesda great with modding?\r\n\r\nV1.0 RELEASED\r\nAll shouts have adjusted timers, all shouts can be used much quicker now\r\n                Unique Properties for individual words coming soon.\r\n-All shouts do more damage, or have more of a benefit to the player \r\n-Unrelenting Force does more damage and launch people further, Unrelenting Force is now usable as a weapon on its own\r\n-The Final Word in become ethereal gives you some health, stamina, and magicka to get back into the fight!\r\n-I Intend to use more special perks for the final word in shouts, as well as the first 2! feel free to suggest one and I may consider it!\r\n\r\n        To Do List\r\n1.Nerf Some shouts (All depends on what you think, I may have OP Some.)\r\n2.Add Unique Abilities to Every \\\"Level\\\" In the Shout (Fus, Fus Ro, Fus Ro Dah, This shout does have new abilities as of now, But not all the other shouts have their Unique Capabilities)\r\n\r\n        Compatibility\r\nAs far as I know, It is 100% Compatible to everything That does NOT Alter Shouts, You have to Pick my Mod or another shout mod.\r\nThe Way Of The Voice Benefits from Skyrim Redone\\'s Speech Perks\r\nDon\\'t know what skyrim Redone is? check it out here! http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286/? \r\n\r\nMake sure to endorse, comment, and enjoy!",
