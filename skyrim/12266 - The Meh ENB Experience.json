  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Work in Progress[/b]\r\n\r\nThis is my enbseries.ini file based on the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4142]Cinematic Lighting ENB (CLENB)[/url], working toward making it sharp and natural. --Jawz--\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8005]Guide to ENB[/url] has been quite helpful, as well. ENB is originally by and still developed by Boris Vorontsov, and should be installed from [url=http://enbdev.com]his website[/url]. I\\'m using the 102 DLL version, but will probably move to (or at least test) newer versions.\r\n\r\nThere are three guiding principles: it\\'s dark at night, the sun is bright, and Skyrim isn\\'t Azeroth. Dungeons and interiors, as well as nights, are balanced around light sources (torches, candles, and you\\'ll need them), and daytime around a winter sun. Those should correspond to reality as closely as possible. Everything else flows from this.\r\n\r\nThis is mainly personal, but perhaps someone else will find it useful.\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions and so on from the CLENB link. 99% of the credit goes to HeliosDoubleSix, --Jawz--, and of course Boris Vorontsov.\r\n\r\nAdditional things that I highly recommend, or the brightness levels might not be right:\r\n\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=131]FXAA PPI (preset 4)[/url] and added [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2069]WaningGibbous\\' FXAA Presets (preset 1)[/url] on top of it. I haven\\'t modified their settings in any way, though. You may prefer without FXAA (I sometimes do outdoors). Note: 0.9 will probably do away with FXAA.\r\n\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9605]Double Torch Radius[/url]\r\n\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9930]Revamped Exterior Fog[/url]\r\n\r\nI\\'m using a bunch of other mods and will post them at some point. Those three are the most significant for replication, though.\r\n\r\nThis is a work  in process. Looks mostly good to me in, but there are various issues, some stemming from game problems like night/interior separation, too-bright textures (stone in particular), point light disproportionality; and some from my settings not being correct yet, or fitting for some scenario.\r\n\r\nThere are several pictures in the image section, tagged with the version they relate to.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I play on a less-than-stellar machine (Q9550 quadcore, 8 GiB RAM, GTX 560 1 GiB OC\\'d to 910/4100, SSD) which is a slight problem with graphics performance. I can, however, maintain an average framerate of 35+ with both ENB and FXAA on. Toward that end, you\\'ll notice that I\\'ve turned off Ambient Occlusion in the enbseries.ini, and am forcing it via NVidia Inspector instead, which should be a bit faster. I\\'ve no idea how an AMD card might work, but please give it a go - just enable AO in the INI, and select the appropriate quality setting. On a beefier machine, the enbseries option will almost certainly produce better output, so enable it instead. I\\'ll try testing it to see whether it requires brightness changes at some point.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n0.8: Small improvements, plus adjustments based on Revamped Exterior Fog and Double Torch Radius.\r\n0.7: Mainly improvements on the direction set by 0.6. Should be better all around now.\r\n0.6: Moving toward darker, need to readjust lighting to compensate still. \r\n0.5: Initial.",
