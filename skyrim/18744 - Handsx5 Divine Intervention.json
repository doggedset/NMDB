  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]I AM NO LONGER WORKING ON THIS MOD AND RARELY LOG INTO NEXUS ANYMORE&#33; MEGAPATATO HAS CREATED A FANTASTIC DIVINE INTERVENTION MOD THAT IS NEWER AND WORKS WITH SKYRIM SPECIAL EDITION. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10235/?]CHECK IT OUT[/url].[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />v0.9\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds the spell Divine Intervention to Skyrim as well as Divine Intervention Scrolls and Tomes.\r<br />\r<br />Originally, I only uploaded my mods to steam and this is the first mod I&#39;ve uploaded to tesnexus, so if the .rar is screwed up in some way please inform me.\r<br />\r<br />Divine Intervention is an apprentice level alteration spell that, when cast, transports the caster to the nearest Aedric temple. This means you will go to the Temple of the Divines in Solitude, the Temple of Dibella in Markarth, the Temple of Talos in Windhelm (no arguments about whether he is a God or not please), the Temple of Mara in Riften, or the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />Due to the mechanics of Skyrim, it only works outside. I will continue to look for tricks which may allow this to change, but even if it could work there would always be the risk of scripted events and time-sensitive quests getting glitched because the character teleported away at a bad time.\r<br />\r<br />Just like in Morrowind, you can cast this spell while encumbered and since the teleportation is instantaneous, no game time elapses between casting Divine Intervention and arriving inside the nearest temple.\r<br />\r<br />You can buy tomes and scrolls from the court mages (i.e. Farengar in Whiterun, Wylandriah in Riften, etc...) and the professor of Alteration at the College of Winterhold. There&#39;s also a free copy somewhere in the depths of Bleak Falls Barrow.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to experiment with casting Divine Intervention inside, open your console and enter &#39;set aAllowDivineIntervention to 1&#39;. You do this at your own risk; I am not responsible for screwed up save games.\r<br />\r<br />To undo this, open your console and enter &#39;set aAllowDivineIntervention to 0&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy\r<br />\r<br />Things to add:\r<br />- Fine tune casting animations and sounds\r<br />- Make Divine Intervention work in interior cells\r<br />\r<br />My thanks to Drummi for making the mark and recall mod which inspired me to make this. Check it out.\r<br />\r<br />Fixes \r<br />(revision 2, v0.6):\r<br />- Fixed problem where people near Markarth would not be teleported to the temple of Dibella (thanks Dick z normisz)\r<br />- Tolfdir and the court mages sell only 1 copy of the Divine Intervention Tome at a time now\r<br />\r<br />(revision 3, v0.7):\r<br />- References cleaned up (thanks ravenmast0r)\r<br />\r<br />(revision 4, v0.8):\r<br />- All heading markers revamped, and four new ones added to make the mod compatible with open cities.\r<br />- Spell now transports characters to the inside of the nearest Aedric temple, as oposed to the outside.\r<br />\r<br />(revision 5, v0.9)\r<br />- Mod cleaned with Tes5Edit (thanks lightkeira)",
