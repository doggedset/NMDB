  "descriptionHtml": "Introducing, Elena Faro, a marriable female Bosmer Nightblade follower. \r<br />\r<br />This follower was based on my pirate queen character, Elena Faro (anyone interested in a pirate character should check out the Northern Cardinal and Bob&#39;s Armory [there are some great piratey hats in that mod, as well as a lot of other goodies.]). Faro spent her younger days as a displaced urchin in Valenwood, surviving off the land and whatever she could steal. As a young adult, she discovered her magical ability and took to the seas as a Nightblade on a pirate ship when one of her thief comrades introduced her to the captain. After a few years of plunder, her intelligence, natural ability and conniving nature brought her to Skyrim in charge of her own ship, which was wrecked in a storm near Dawnstar. She made it ashore however and started a new life in the Thieves Guild, where you may now find her (in the Cistern) and recruit her.\r<br />\r<br />She fights with one handed weapons and shock magic, and uses Alteration and Restoration for Mage Armor and healing.\r<br />\r<br />If you want her to look like the screenshot, these are the mods I&#39;m using:\r<br />\r<br />AOF Believable Hair - Male and Female\r<br />CBBE\r<br />LIFE - Lith Face Enhancement CBBE\r<br />Natural Eyes HD\r<br />Ethereal Elven Overhaul\r<br />\r<br />Installed in that order. I don&#39;t really think anything bad will happen if you install them in a different order or don&#39;t use them; none of them are required. She definitely will look different from the screenshot however.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is open for improvement, since it&#39;s my first follower mod. I&#39;d like to add a quest and some dialogue, but I don&#39;t know the first thing about how to do that, so if you have advice and suggestions, feel free to comment or PM me. Furthermore, if you like her and want to improve on her or use her in your own mod, please do so, but notify me and give me credit in your mod.Â \r<br />\r<br />P.S. don&#39;t forget to endorse&#33;",
