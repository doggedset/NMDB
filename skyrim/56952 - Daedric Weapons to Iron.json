  "descriptionHtml": "Fourth Mod&#33; \r<br />\r<br />I have a confession to make. I never liked the look of the vanilla Skyrim Daedric weapons. Too spiky, too obvious, too in-your-face, not practical in the least... that&#39;s my opinion, and you are welcome to disagree with it if you hate the idea of weapons that actually look functional. \r<br />As such, this is a mod that changes the meshes of the daedric armour pieces to that of Iron, which is one of the better looking (if sadly low level) weapon sets in the game. Nothing fancy, this is another mod that took about half an hour and a cup of coffee to make. \r<br />\r<br />Other mods seen in the screenshots: \r<br />Daedric Armor to Iron (My mod as well, on the Workshop and the Nexus)\r<br />Brigandine Armors (Another one of mine, not published yet) \r<br />aMidianBorn Book of Silence - Armors (available on the Nexus and highly recommended) \r<br />SkyUI (available on the Nexus) \r<br />\r<br />Please do not upload this file elsewhere without my permission. Hell, why would you bother? This mod took about ten minutes to make with the creation kit (not including playtesting). \r<br />\r<br />Credits: \r<br />BorderWise (that guy with too much free time) \r<br />Bethesda, for making the game that caused me to develop a dragon fetish. \r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0: Changed meshes of Daedric weapons to that of Iron weapons. ",
