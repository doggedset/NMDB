  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve downloaded some mods that increase the amount of enemies in the game to make it more challenging. However three guards are no match when a squad of 8 vampires wander into town. So in order to protect the villager population I&#39;m making mods that add more of the generic guards and soldiers to Skyrim.  I started with Whiterun Hold. I hope to start the Rift after I&#39;m finished.\r<br /> I still need to add more guards to the area outside of Whiterun. I also need to test the mod with the civil war quest line. \r<br />\r<br />If there are bugs let me know. This isn&#39;t my first mod but I&#39;m still very to this.",
