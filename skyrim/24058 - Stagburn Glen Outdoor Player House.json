[/size][/list]\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[size=4pt][color=green][b][u]Stagburn Glen Compatability[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r\n[size=3pt]This mod is probably not compatible with any mod that expands the layout of Falkreath or adds any player houses on the outskirts of the city.  Also please note that a few Dawnguard items were used.  Duplicates were made, such as of the sundial, which may carry over even if you do not have DG, but it is probably best used if you have DG installed.\r\n\r\nIf your mannequins move around, make sure to have [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10652]this mod fix[/url] installed.[/size]\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[size=4pt][color=green][b][u]A note about spouses and followers[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r\n[size=3pt]I use [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO[/url], [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11370]Spouses Can Live Everywhere[/url], and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18045]My Home Is Your Home[/url] to populate my home at Stagburn Glen with NPC’s and followers.  It all usually works except for a few quirks: \r\n\r\n[color=green]1)[/color] It seems best to establish the follower’s new home in a central location such as the pub or the lowest platform near the wood cutting area.\r\n\r\n[color=green]2)[/color] The whole area has been newly navmeshed, but that process involves a few pesky bugs that persist because it is an outdoor world space with a new navmesh.  Sometimes followers relaxing will walk into some walls or get stuck on furniture.  Mostly they do ok, but every once in a while they’ll get confused.  Don’t worry too much.  They’ll eventually self-correct.  This is as best as I can do given the limits of navmeshing anew a vanilla world space with the Creation Kit.  \r\n\r\n[color=green]3)[/color] The elevated living quarters near the falls seem to be a world unto itself because it is so high, so followers “released” below it may not be able to make it all the way back up there even though it is navmeshed with a clear path.  Also followers whose new home is established in the living quarters tend to spend all their time there, and don’t venture down into the Glen.  You may want to root your spouse up there, and give your other followers the run of the rest of the Glen.  \r\n\r\n[color=green]4)[/color]  Followers who are turned loose inside the Glen should not venture outside the Glen on their own.  They won’t be popping into Falkreath without you.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=green][b]FYI:[/b][/color]  You don’t have to worry about falling off the high staircase to the living quarters.  Invisible collision boxes on either side should protect you.  However, most players will not survive a jump from the balcony to the ground.  A few other collision boxes have been added to help with follower navigation.[/size]\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[size=4pt][color=green][b][u]Version History[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r\n[size=3pt]V.1.0  Initial Release[/size]\r\n\r\n",
