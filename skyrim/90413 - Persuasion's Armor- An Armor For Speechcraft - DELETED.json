  "descriptionHtml": "This is an armor that makes speechcraft incredibly easy. It is light ebony armor and can be find in the Warrens(Eltry's Room). Be careful no one is watching you take it because it apparently counts as stealing. Please endorse this mod because it is my first mod and i want to continue modding Skyrim. This armor will make nearly every speech check easy (except the ones that are impossible).\n<br />\n<br />For those that actually installed the armor and played with it, thank you and please don't take the armor seriously as it is a bit overpowered. Comment if you want me to give the armor a backstory. Thank you i hope you enjoy the mod.",
