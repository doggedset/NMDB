  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff7700][size=3]About the retexture[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />The original unique mead labels need some serious work. The vanilla textures are low-res and not very detailed. There are many mods that retexture these labels already, but I didn&#39;t like how most of them were depicted; either they looked like they were based off Microsoft ClipArt, or they made me think about the poor person getting carpal tunnel as they meticulously wrote and colored each individual label.\r<br />\r<br />No mass-production company would spend the money to write and color every product label, and I don&#39;t think they have color printers in Skyrim. Especially since Sabjorn and Maven are in heavy competition with each other, they would most likely be trying to increase profits and cut costs anywhere they can. So I imagined each label being hastily stamped with ink and attached to a bottle. Thus, this retexture was born.\r<br />\r<br />A result of my getting the flu one day and trying to learn how to use paint.net. This is the smallest retexture ever. Download it today&#33; Then go donate to another modder who actually knows how to retexture things well.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3]Credits[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]O[/b][b]riginal graphics[/b] by [url=http://emptysamurai.deviantart.com/]Elvis[/url] \r<br />[url=http://www.dafont.com/mael.font][b]Mael font[/b][/url] by [url=http://www.dafont.com/utopia.d61]Utopia[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.dafont.com/stonehenge.font]Stonehenge font[/url] on dafont.com",
