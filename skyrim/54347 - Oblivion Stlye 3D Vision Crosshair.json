  "modName": "Oblivion Stlye 3D Vision Crosshair",
  "summary": "Replaces some of the more useless Nvidia crosshairs with one styled on oblivions and importantly as several others. I found the one crosshair I find useful not suited to fantasy rpg&#39;s, so I ported and adapted oblivions crosshair.\r<br />\r<br />I was surprise at how well it came out, I can&#39;t tell it apart from the original Oblivion reticule, ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod also replaces several other crosshairs with some custom sights and laser dots that I view as more useful and less ugly. I included them since they might be useful but also as I no longer have the originals. So please if you like ANY of the Nvidia sights BACKUP your files. Some are just clones as I&#39;ve downloaded \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve include a file with every crosshair in the file inside, so if anyone wants to avoid deleting a crosshair they like, or only have the Oblivion reticule, a selection, or edit them to their taste they can with greater ease. If anyone would like to do this but doesn&#39;t yet know how it&#39;s not at all hard and I recommend trying.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s info on how to do so .\r<br />\r<br />https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/503584/3d-vision/complete-replacement-set-of-lasersights-for-all-33-red-dot-holographic-sniper-crosshair-etc-/",
