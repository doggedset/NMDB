  "summary": "A working, Lisette follower mod, built on the latest skyrim patch, and made in the creation kit.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is very tiny..  I mean that.  It basically makes Lisette a follower, and a potential spouse.\r\n\r\nI made it simply because the other Lisette mods were not (to my knowledge) built in the creation kit, nor were they made on the latest skyrim patch.  So in my experience, they did not work.  Or they caused bugs that made it more annoying than its worth.\r\n\r\nSo here are some things I did.  If you see something marked with an asterisk please read the notes to go along with it at the bottom. \r\n\r\n-class set to combat rogue\r\n-starting out at lvl 10\r\n-levels with player*\r\n-no default outfit so she will wear anything you give her*\r\n-court-able\r\n-She has been given a combat style which should (in theory) enable dual wielding*\r\n\r\n[Notes]\r\nBecause she has no default outfit she will be nude when you first meet her even though she has armor in her inventory to wear.\r\n\r\nDual wielding has been broken since day one (as far as I know) in the CK and I currently do not know how to make it work.  I know many classes and combat styles which should allow dual wielding but in game this does not always mean the NPC will.  \r\n\r\nAs for the leveling with player I could really use some feedback on this.  My save was corrupted, so I am starting over and it may be a while before I can really confirm she is in fact leveling along with me.\r\n\r\nOh and BTW, this IS NMM compatible.  Your welcome! \r\n\r\nOne thing I have never done before which should be fine, is I left a random loot generator in her inventory.  All it does is make it so that like any other random NPC, the first time you go through her inventory she will have a few random trinkets.  Maybe a ring, some gold etc.  Now the fear here is that, this loot generator may or may not override what you give her after some period of time.  Now I don\\'t think it works this way, I think its a one time deal.  It generates the loot once and thats it.  You remove it, its gone.  But if this is not the case I will fix it.",
