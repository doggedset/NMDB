  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][color=#008800][b]Adds new shout - &#34;Unrelenting Force on self&#34;.[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Just for Fun.Â Fart and fly&#33; Use for fast travelling :)\r<br />This shout throws the player in the cursor direction.\r<br />Force depends on time of holding of the &#34;use power&#34; button.\r<br />It is new shout (nothing is replaced ).\r<br />\r<br />You can adjust force of a throw via the console.\r<br />Console command:\r<br />&#34;set zshpushpower to 10 &#34;\r<br />(10-number by default)\r<br />The more value - the more initial speed.\r<br />At input of negative numbers the player will fly back.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#008800][b]How is it works:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Depending on a cursor position components of a vector of force on X Y Z axes are calculated.\r<br />Force is proportional to coefficient &#34;zshpushpower&#34;.\r<br />For the period of flight the script does the player invulnerable that he didn&#39;t die when falling :).\r<br />I consider that time in flight = time between two events:\r<br /> 1)Player cast shout\r<br /> 2)Player plays GetUp animation.\r<br />So it is possible to jump (cast W T F shout) off from the Throat of the World and to remain live.\r<br />\r<br />You can force down characters if during flight will strike them. :)\r<br />Unfortunately this function not always works, as at great speed flight it is impossible to process an event.\r<br />\r<br />(Script sources included)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#008800][b]Installation:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Unpack and copy the contents of the compressed ZIP file into your Skyrim game folder, into the &#39;Data&#39; folder. Using the &#39;vanilla game launcher&#39; tool, click on the &#39;Data&#39; button and make sure there is a check mark in front of this mod. This will activate the mod in your game. Now load the game up and your now done.\r<br />The player can use the new shout after escaping from Helgen (it appears automatically.)\r<br />If you have an older version, I recommend to do the following:\r<br />    - From the vanilla game start menu, disable the mod.\r<br />    - Start your game up and load your save game.\r<br />    - Save your game. This is now your &#39;cleaned&#39; save game. Exit the game.\r<br />    - Install the new version.\r<br />    - Enable the mod again using the vanilla game launcher tool.\r<br />    - Load up the game and load your last save game.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#008800]troubleshooting[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />1)If the player freezes animations (for example, when a player flies into the cave.), Wait about 30 seconds to fix.
