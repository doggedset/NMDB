  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/8L1mv.png[/img]\r\n\r\nNOTE: IF YOU DOWNLOADED BEFORE THE 1.1 UPDATE, DOWNLOAD THE HOTFIX.\r\n\r\n========================Candles of the North========================\r\n===============Morrowindesque wielded candles for Skyrim===============\r\n\r\n[youtube]TYpE9lVj6bU[/youtube]\r\n\r\n============================Description============================\r\nIf you are anything like me, you have probably wondered to yourself, \\'Hmm, in Morrowind, I could pick this candelabra off of this table and use it as an alternative to torches, yet in Skyrim, I can\\'t even interact with this lit one!\\' Well, if you have ever pondered that question to yourself, then you are in luck, my fellow outlander, as I have, after finding out that(surprisingly), nobody had made a mod to add usable Candlesticks and Candelabras to Skyrim, I decided to make one for all of you lovely people out there in dire need of silverware lighting solutions. Introducing Candles of the North: Morrowind-esque wielded candles for Skyrim. Now, you too can carry a stick of wax on fire to a dragon fight, or when clearing a barrow of Draugr!\r\n\r\n==========================What does it do?==========================\r\nCandles of the North adds in new lights into the game similar to torches, however there are a couple of differences that separate your Candles of the North quality Silverware Candlesticks from the every-man\\'s Lantern, or the Barbarian\\'s torch. They can be found in a barrel next to the steps of Alvor\\'s store/house.\r\n\r\n============================Compatibility============================\r\nDue to an issue in the Creation Kit regarding Idle Animations and Torches, the mod will probably be incompatible with mods that add usable LIGH objects, such as the beautiful Chesko\\'s Wearable Lanterns. There, as of right now, seems to be no way around this. Sorry for the disappointment. :(\r\n\r\n=========================Copyright Disclaimer=========================\r\nI have waived all of my rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law and the Creation Kit EULA.
