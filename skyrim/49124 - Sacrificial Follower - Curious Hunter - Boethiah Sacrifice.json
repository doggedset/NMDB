  "descriptionHtml": "The Curious Hunter is a sacrificial follower for the [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Boethiah%27s_Calling]Boethiah&#39;s Calling[/url] quest.  You can find him on the road near [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Traitor%27s_Post]Traitor&#39;s Post[/url].\r<br />\r<br />His default outfit is bandit furs, leather boots, and fur bracers. His starting weapons are a low-level bow, iron arrows, and a low-level dagger. He also carries random hunter items, some food and drink, and a small amount of gold. His NPC class is CombatRanger, and he prefers light armor, bows, and one-handed weapons. He is not essential (so you can kill him) and has a standard Nord male voice. His level ranges from 5-40 (player x 0.85) and he cannot be married.\r<br />\r<br />No known incompatibilities.  He has an idle marker near a tree stump, though (in Wilderness cell 38, 9) so something that rearranges that area too much might clip it or leave a gap.\r<br />\r<br />This mod has been cleaned with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859]TES5Edit[/url].\r<br />\r<br />If you find any bugs or incompatibilities, let me know in the comments&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Also available on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=207727858]Steam Workshop[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[b]-- Instructions (manual install) --[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Download the zip, then unzip the esp and bsa files to your [i].../skyrim/Data/[/i] folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b]-- Changelog --[/b]\r<br />\r<br />See [i]Changes[/i] tab above.\r<br />\r<br />[b]-- Notes --[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod&#39;s filenames are [i]AoM_sacrificial-hunter.esp[/i] and [i]AoM_sacrificial-hunter.bsa[/i].\r<br />\r<br />The Curious Hunter&#39;s base info in the Creation Kit is under [i]Actors → Actor → AoMSacrificialHunter[/i].\r<br />\r<br />His BaseID is [i]xx000D62[/i] and his RefID is [i]xx00182A[/i] (replace [i]xx[/i] with whatever number this mod gets in your game; type [i]help &#34;curious hunter&#34;[/i] in the console to find it).",
