  "descriptionHtml": "This mod replaces the standard \\\"fus ro dah\\\" voice for Unrelenting Force with Fluttershy, from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, saying \\\"yaaay.\\\" Shortly after the shout, she continues, \\\"Did my cheering do that?\\\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQJCxkT8B80\r\n\r\nThis mod should work with all default races and genders, though it has only been tested with male human and male bosmer.\r\n\r\nTo install, just extract into the Data folder inside your Skyrim directory. (This is probably C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\, but it may be different. Omit the (x86) on 32-bit systems, or just where you do not see an (x86) version of Program Files!)",
