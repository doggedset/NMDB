Grundle, however, is a special case. \r<br />A stray since he was a calf, forever wandering the shores of both Morrowind and Solstheim. Intelligent and fierce, the only being that can &#34;domesticate&#34; such a creature is one such as the Dovakiin.\r<br />\r<br />BEFORE YOU START DOWNLOADING&#33;\r<br />Please note that this contains coarse language and is barely an alpha (Meaning that if you want quality, go away).",
