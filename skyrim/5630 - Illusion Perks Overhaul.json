  "descriptionHtml": "Illusion Perks Overhaul Ver 1.0\r\n\r\nPlayers that use an extended leveling mod will notice that as they get higher in level (around 50ish) they\\'re illusion skill will become useless. The goal of this mod is to make illusion viable even at high levels. My main motivation was to overcome the issues I experienced, however, the changes made by my mod would work even in a vanilla playthrough. The high cost of master illusion spells and the sacrifice necessary to access additional perks act to balance the increased illusion spell caps, so give it a try. :)\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\nThis mod alters many perks in the illusion skill tree.\r\n\r\nNew Ranked Perks:\r\n- Rage (3 Ranks)\r\n  1. Adds 10 to the level effectiveness of frenzy type spells. (Requires Illusion >= 50)\r\n  2. Adds 10 to the level effectiveness of frenzy type spells. (Requires Illusion >= 70)\r\n  3. Adds 10 to the level effectiveness of frenzy type spells. (Requires Illusion >= 90)\r\n\r\n- Apect of Terror (3 Ranks)\r\n    1. Adds 10 to the level effectiveness of fear type spells. (Requires Illusion >= 40)\r\n    2. Adds 10 to the level effectiveness of fear type spells. (Requires Illusion >= 60)\r\n    3. Adds 10 to the level effectiveness of rear type spells. (Requires Illusion >= 80)\r\n\r\n- Hypnotic Glare (3 Ranks)\r\n    1. Adds 10 to the level effectiveness of calm type spells. (Requires Illusion >= 30)\r\n    2. Adds 10 to the level effectiveness of calm type spells. (Requires Illusion >= 50)\r\n    3. Adds 10 to the level effectiveness of calm type spells. (Requires Illusion >= 70)\r\n\r\nOther Perk Changes:\r\n\r\n- Animage: Now adds 15 to spell magnitude when cast on animals instead of 8.\r\n\r\n-Kindred Mage: Now adds 15 to spell magnitude when cast on people.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges to spells:\r\nFury, Calm, Fear now effect lv 10 by default.\r\nFrenzy, Pacify, Rout now effect lv 30 by default.\r\nMayhem, Harmony, Hysteria now effect lv 50 by default.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nDrop the following esp files into your Data folder in your Skyrim directory. \r\n-Illusion Perks Overhaul.esp\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\nDelete the above esp file from your Data folder in your Skyrim directory.\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\nThis mod only alters the recipes for items at the forge, so it should be compatible with any other mod that does not alter the same recipes. Other mods that add new recipes should work with it perfectly.\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFuture Plans:\r\nI plan on working on some of the other skill trees. Depending on the feedback I get from this mod, ver 1.0 could be final. :)\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nErrors and Bugs:\r\nPlease report any inconsistencies or error on the comments section for this topic or private message me. I\\'ll be glad to fix them as soon as possible. Thanks!\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDO NOT REUPLOAD MY MOD ANYWHERE!!!! THAT MAKES ME A SAD PANDA!!!\r\nIF YOU DIDN\\'T GET THIS MOD FROM www.skyrimnexus.com, THEN YOU SHOULD VISIT THAT SITE TO UPDATE TO THE OFFICIAL VERSION. (skyrimnexus is the only place I publish mods so there\\'s a thief about...)\r\nFEEL FREE TO ALTER IT FOR YOUR PERSONAL USE, BUT CONTACT ME IF YOU WISH TO INCORPORATE IT INTO YOUR MOD. Thanks. :)\r\n\r\n",
