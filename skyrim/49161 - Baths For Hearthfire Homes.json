  "descriptionHtml": "18/Aug/14\r<br />Apologies to all users of this mod for my complete lack of updates&#33; This has been a very hectic year for me and I&#39;m currently without internet on my home computer, but that will be all sorted within the next few weeks. I&#39;m taking as many suggestions for improvements/tweaks on board as I can, and I will be ensuring compatibility with the major needs & survival mods, plus adding a merged version for people who use all three houses. Thank you so much for your lovely comments and suggestions.\r<br />\r<br />-------\r<br />Updated 26/Dec/&#39;13: Fixed the issue where the Lakeview Trapdoor was in the wrong location.\r<br />------\r<br />\r<br />As a user of Ryan B&#39;s &#39;Drink, Eat, Sleep, Bathe&#39; mod, I noticed one problem when my character needed a bath while living in Heljarchen Hall. There was no nearby water source where she could wash in private. Instead, she&#39;d have to run several minutes to go bathe by a main road. It was a little less than ideal, even without the dragons. Thusly, I decided to make this as an unobtrusive, hopefully not jarring addition to the game, since I couldn&#39;t find anything similar. After some thought, I decided to make it usable for the other two hearthfire houses, since why not.\r<br />\r<br />The entrance trapdoors are located in the Entryway/Small House section of the houses, to the left near the front door. \r<br />\r<br />This is my first attempt at a mod, so it IS more function than form. However, as I become more experienced with the CK, I intend to spruce this up. \r<br />\r<br />Requires Heathfire, for obvious reasons. Does NOT require Drink, Eat, Sleep, Bathe, but was designed with it in mind. \r<br />\r<br />Also uploaded to the Steam Workshop, under SarahSyna.",
