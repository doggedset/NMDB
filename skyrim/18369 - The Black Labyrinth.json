Adventurers have been known to get completely lost in the maze (Keep a savegame outside the maze or a coc location to hand in case you get so lost you cannot find a way out). When you need to find it then it\\'s located north of Whiterun, just south of Fort Dunstead, right between the two giant camps there. Shows on the map as a cave symbol and is active from the start.",
