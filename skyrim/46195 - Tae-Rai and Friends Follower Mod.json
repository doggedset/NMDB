  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=red][b][u]Tae-Rai and Friends Follower Mod[/u][/b][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />This mod is a simple collection of all my Skyrim PC characters. I love every one of them and have been using them as followers for some time now and I figured I would share them with the world&#33; You should be able to marry all of them, but please let me know if there are problems&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=red][b]DAWNGUARD AND DRAGONBORN DLC REQUIRED[/b][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]====[b]Whose Here?[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Tae-Rai - Male Argonian Barbarian Archer, found in the Bee and Barb in Riften. Brother of Rai-Kae.\r<br />Rai-Kae - Male Argonian vampire Necromancer, found in the Ragged Flagon in Riften. Brother of Tae-Rai.\r<br />Olivus - Imperial Archer. Skyrim&#39;s Green Arrow\r<br />Ra&#39;Sankari - Male Khajiit Thief, found in the Worker&#39;s House at Mixwater Mill. Former skooma addict.\r<br />Boto - Male Nord Warrior, found in Candlehearth Hall in Windhelm. Strong Stormcloak supporter.\r<br />Ralos - Male Dunmer Barbarian, found in the Retchling Netch in Raven Rock. Hates the gods.\r<br />Jeta - Female Khajiit Beserker , found in Frostfruit Inn in Rorikstead. Innocent yet sneaky.\r<br />Do&#39;&#39;Rahza - Male Khajiit Paladin, found in Nightgate Inn, in the Pale. Proud, honorable warrior.\r<br />\r<br />[i]More followers coming soon&#33;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />All followers will do the basic follower stuff, and, despite their backgrounds, won&#39;t mind if you commit crimes&#33; All their armor also ties into their personalities and stories, so please don&#39;t bug me about how crappy some of their armor is *coughBatocough*. Some warpaint is missing too, but it&#39;s not a big deal right now.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]====[b]Installation[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Drag and drop to Data folder after unzipping OR use the NMM for easy installation. \r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]====[b]Compartability[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />I also took the liberty of editing the Worker&#39;s House for Ra&#39;Sankari to make it a bit more livable so any mod that changes this will make my mod INCOMPATIBLE. \r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]====[b]Future Plans[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />More followers&#33; Plus quests and unique dialogue. As well as some letters and journals detailing their lives and back stories. I am currently seeking voice actors for each of my characters. If you&#39;re interested, please message me.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]==== [b]Permissions and Credits[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod is not to be uploaded anywhere but the Skyrim Nexus. Please report to me if you see this anywhere else.\r<br />All characters belong to me, except for Ra&#39;Sankari, which is my partner&#39;s and gave him to me to torture- I mean, play with :)\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating a great game and letting us fiddle with it. \r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Thanks for reading and check my page for more mods&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7065334/?tb=mods&pUp=1 ] [IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/2dryws3.png[/IMG][/url]",
