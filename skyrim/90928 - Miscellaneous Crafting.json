  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds crafting recipes to create very mundane objects and clutter items. I am creating this with the mod \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35305/]Your Market Stall[/url]\" In mind; allowing you to create the clutter items NPCs may be searching for in regards to the mod, as well as it being an avenue for players to create some decorations for their homes in which I would suggest installing \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52583]Jaxonz Positioner[/url]\" to accurately place and lock decorative objects into place.\n<br />\n<br />Role-playing is the focus here. Rather than having to steal inane objects to sell them or painstakingly hope that the one object you want to purchase is being sold by a general merchant; you may now create and sell a (currently small) variety of basic goods. The base value of these clutter items have been increased marginally, to make their construction out of their raw materials profitable as well as better reflect the fact they are functional objects to other people than the player character.\n<br />\n<br />As of now, the mod includes these types of items:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Brooms\n<br />[*]Eating Utensils\n<br />[*]Dwemer Bowls, Plates, etc..\n<br />[*]and a few other misc items\n<br />\n<br />[/list]",
