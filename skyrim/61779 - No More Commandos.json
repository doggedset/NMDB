  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever been to a tavern in skyrim and just as you a gentleman were about to comment upon the short skirts of the tavern wenches you discovered to your terror, that the girl had no underwear. How is this possible, how can it be that the people of skyrim don&#39;t have any underwear. The indecency is unimaginable.\r<br />\r<br />Well the Holy order of Pantsu are on a holy mission to make the heathen people of skyrim wear underwear (Pantsu). The order has been on a mission to distibute on random pair of Pantsu to all inhabitants of skyrim, even the men have recieved one pair of pantsu, so that they can give it to any woman, who has lost hers.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Description:[/b][/size]\r<br />This modifies almost all outfit lists (about 500), to add one random pair of underwear. To further make sure that the underwear works well I&#39;ve checked for clipping between these underwear and a large armor replacer for SevenBase, namely [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47477/]Pfiffys[/url], and any armor which already has underwear or where no underwear is needed has been modified such that the underwear will be hidden if worn at the same time. This means that this mod is only useful together with this armor replace, but it can be modified to work with others.\r<br />\r<br />I won&#39;t create any alternate version for other mods, instead I&#39;ll leave a clean version of the mod and some nice tools for those who want to do this.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Requirements:[/b][/size]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47477/]Sexy Vanilla Clothes and Armors for Sevenbase Bombshell[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Conflicts[/b][/size]\r<br />Any mod that changes outfits may have a conflict with this and also any mod that changes armor addon entries, which are used to hide the underwear.\r<br />Due to the nature of outfit lists, this mod works best with a new savegame as any NPC that is already spawned won&#39;t get the underwear and worse due to the edits in the required mod by pfiffy, some NPCs may end up naked.",
