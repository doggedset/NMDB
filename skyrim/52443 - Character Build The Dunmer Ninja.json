  "descriptionHtml": "Hailing from his home country of Morrowind, the Dunmer Ninja strikes down his foes from the shadows. Also being able to inspire fear into his enemies. The Dunmer Ninja is a force to be reckoned with.\r<br />\r<br />-&#34;You&#39;ll never be safe...&#34;\r<br />\r<br />This is not a mod, but a way to create your character. This is the first time I tried to create a build so don&#39;t be too hard on me. I tried different ways to make a Dark Elf but none of these kind of pleased be, until now&#33; Behold&#33; THE DUNMER NINJA&#33; Lol. :P\r<br />\r<br />So anyhow, please, let me know what you think about the build, if you like it I might make some more. :)",
