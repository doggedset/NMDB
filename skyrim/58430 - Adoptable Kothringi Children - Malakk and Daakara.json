  "summary": "This mod adds two adoptable Kothringi refugee children to the game. Their names are Malakk and Daakara.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Are you the Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie of Skyrim? Are you one of the last surviving Kothringi and wish to adopt some children of your own kind? Are you a Sload with a sick sense of humor? Do you just want to adopt a child who isn&#39;t a traditional human? Then this mod is for you. \r<br />\r<br />This mod adds two Kothringi children to the game named Malakk and Daakara. Malakk can be found upstairs at the Bee and the Bard. Daakara can be found in the Argonian Assemblage in Windhelm. If you can&#39;t get into the assemblage, its open from 6AM to 9AM.\r<br />\r<br />This mod should work with any children overhauls like TK Children because they use vanilla meshes.\r<br />\r<br />[i]The [b]Kothringi[/b] are a silver-skinned tribal people indigenous to Black Marsh. Once considered the only humans native to Tamriel, they are now known to have shared the continent with many other tribal groups. They were rumored to be avid sailors, sailing as far as Hammerfell, notably spreading the Knahaten Flu of 2E[url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Era#2E_560] [/url]560 to Valenwood and nearby provinces by ship.\r<br />The Kothringi were thought to be exterminated by the Flu, although some of the infected fled on the Crimson Ship westward, away from Tamriel, never to be seen again. However, legends abound of those who supposedly saw the ship and never lived to tell the tale.\r<br />\r<br />[/i]This requires Hearthfire.\r<br />\r<br />You can use this with whatever you want. I made this because nexus doesn&#39;t have a lot of Hearthfire addons.",
