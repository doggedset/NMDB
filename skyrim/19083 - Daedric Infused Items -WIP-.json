  "descriptionHtml": "I need some help I have been attempting to create custom meshes but none of the methods I have heard of work please suggest something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at making a mod and I am currently planning on a large number of features but currently only the Orcish, Ebony, steel armors, and wolf armor are implemented.\r\nThis mod is planned to not only upgrade armor and weapons but also eventually bring the divines from just being blessings and amulets to the front line of battle.\r\n\r\nI am on a modding hiatus until school slows down again so updates will be erratic and I would actually like to have a partner on this mod so if anyone has any modding experience that would be nice especially if you know how to mesh or script.\r\n\r\n7/13/2012\r\nThe items that are found within the secret areas are required to create the infusers this mod hopes to add a storyline that has already begun so please follow the clues.  On another note I would love for somebody to submit some pictures of the items so that everybody can see that this does have more than just orcish.\r\n\r\n6/25/2012\r\nThis mod is currently being worked on by me and my friends by planning what will eventually come from it and I should have another update before the end of the week so keep downloading and recommending.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to for the support!\r\n\r\n1.5\r\nI added corrupt wolf armor, Hircine armor (doesn\\'t use but needs a reward from hircine\\'s quest) dragonbane can be upgraded with essence of dragons and then changed into DragonPurge, a there is also a new dagger that is quite powerful.\r\n\r\n1.4\r\nThis update will be the last for a little while as life is getting in the way.  This adds the (temporary) quest and finishes and adds custom skins for the three crafting items.  The next update will add the last few heavy armor sets and the beginning of the custom items.\r\n\r\n1.3 \r\nFixed steel armor recipes and added a little quest for those who want to obtain these armors legitimately my word of advice \r\n\\\"Follow the ethereal rider, the graves will be your guide.  Then look to the monument to the men of dust, the path to the breath of fire is mirrored to the forgotten tomb.\\\"\r\n\r\n1.2\r\nAdded Purified Daedric items\r\nto get the perk type \\\"help PurifierEssenceperk\\\" then \\\"player.addperk xxxxxxxx\\\"\r\n\r\n1.1\r\nFixed Orcish Battleaxe\r\nadded steel plate armor\r\nadded steel armor\r\nfirst implementation of divine side of the mod\r\n\r\nThanks to Tytanis for his mod \\\"Tytanis - Farming - Mounts - Crafts - Spells - Items - MORE\\\" on the idea of infusing items. Here is a link http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1601\r\nI would love any feedback and any suggestions on how to make the mod better.",
