In truth, I&#39;m no more a little girl than you are. I was once, of course. Three hundred years ago. Vampirism tends to keep one remarkably... fresh.&#34;-- Babette[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Babette&#39;s words are nothing but a mocking joke on Jenya, over jealousy, babette is condemned to be a child forever while she sees Jenya grow up to become a beautiful woman, something she will never be. Jenya does not like Babette herself, the child vampiress was the one that took her to the Brotherhood and forced her to stay. Years went by and the young Jenya became just another member of the guild, working along the other members fulfilling contracts for the Night Mother.\r<br />But there is something Jenya dont know about Babette, they are in fact relatives.\r<br />Babette keept an eye on her mortal relatives since the Oblivion Crisis 300 years ago and ever since then she has tracked and guarded her bloodline from the shadows. Jenya is the last known decendent of Babette&#39;s mortal family after the Great War, but only Babette knows this.\r<br />Jenya believes that her mother was killed by the Broterhood, but the truth is that she is the only daughter of Delphine, the head of the remaining Blades in Skyrim. Babette took Jenya as a child before one of the assassination attempts of the Thalmor against Delphine in Cyrodiil.\r<br />Being assassinations their bussiness, the Dark Brotherhood got to know about this contract, hearing of the death sentence on the last survivor of her mortal family Babette went looking for Delphine, finding her sleeping in her hideout, with Jenya sleeping by her side, her vampiric skills allowed her to take Jenya and leave a note without alerting the mother, &#34;Leave Cyrodiil or you will get your child&#39;s head in a bag&#34;.\r<br />After much searchig for her child, heart broken and with the Thalmor looking for her, Delphine moved to Skyrim hopping for some day find her daughter again.\r<br />Jenya was left in care of the Dark Brotherhood of Cyrodiil in the Cheydinhal Sanctuary, her cries as a child are the tool Babette uses to this day to bother her,&#34;I&#39;m just a little girl&#33; She killed my mama, and then she took me captive&#33; Please, please help me&#33;&#34;.\r<br />After the purification of the Cyrodiil Dark Brotherhood she wondered alone for a while, mercilessly killing those fools that would aproach her with duvious intentions.\r<br />Lost in her thoughts she wondered the streets until she realiced what she is now, an assassin. Accepting her fate and hearing of Cicero and the Night Mother moving to Skyrim she followed their path and came to join the Dark Brotherhood in Dawnstar Sanctuary... finding Babette there.\r<br />\r<br />To be continued....\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#30b3f7]Highly recomended mods to use with Jenya:[/color][/b]\r<br />[list][*]HDT Physics Extension for dinamic breasts and butt bounce.\r<br />[*]XP32 Maximum Skelleton Extended for full pregnancy, TBBP animations and HDT dynamics.
