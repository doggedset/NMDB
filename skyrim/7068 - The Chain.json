  "descriptionHtml": "============\r\nIntroduction\r\n============\r\n\r\nHi all; this is my first contribution to the nexus and my very first mod for Skyrim, I modded a little back in New Vegas but it was all just small personal mods, I\\'m a writer and first got the idea thinking it would be cool to find my book inside Skyrim, and this is where the idea for this mod came from.\r\n\r\nThis mod is in a very early stage, if not earlier STILL, but I hope you will enjoy it, I\\'m just going through learning how to edit the game so in time will try to evolve this into a deep lore-friendly rewarding Quest which could include new spells, weapons, areas... etc, all depends on how fast I learn these stuff frankly and when the CK comes out, but while I can write, and I can edit a bit don\\'t know much about textures or creating meshes from scratch so as long as this remains a one man project I don\\'t promise much on that front.\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n===========\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis is a simple \\'Quest\\' Mod, and at its very early stage for that matter, right now it only adds a few new books to the game along with how to collect them, I intend on developing it further to include many more books, new weapons, spell books, abilities, shouts, dungeons and so on. but the early stages will only involve books to read in a bit of a treasure hunt scenario.\r\n\r\nSimply put if you like to read you may like this mod at any stage, if you\\'re looking for diversity and quests you may be interested in this in the near future.\r\n\r\n==> Always Check the \\'Lost and Found\\' section to know how to start.\r\nNote: I changed the starting point of the Mod to provide compatibility with other mods that make use of Farengar.\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n=======\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n\r\n- Simply extract into your Data folder and activate through launcher or any other used mod manager.\r\n\r\n==============\r\nLost and Found\r\n==============\r\n\r\n- Go to The College of WinterHold, find the one person who cares more about books than anybody else, and Buy The first Narrator\\'s note, follow his words, and have fun.\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n====================\r\nFeedback\\\\Permissions\r\n====================\r\n\r\n- I welcome any sort of constructive criticism by all means, heck I can handle even non-constructive criticism.\r\n- I would love to hear any ideas anyone is having but I add that as a writer myself I usually follow my own imagination as far as story line goes, but as far as the game goes like I said I\\'m new to modding.\r\n- The writing material in this mod is mine, some of it is from my upcoming Novel, so under no condition any of it should be edited, or published somewhere else or used in any other means.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nRecommended Mods:\r\n=================\r\n\r\n- A Quality World Map - With Roads: Very helpful when it comes to exploring and treasure hunting.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4929\r\n\r\n- Wars in Skyrim IV: This might make every step you take a battle really.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6176\r\n\r\n========\r\n*UPDATE*\r\n========\r\n\r\nV1.0\r\n- Updated Mod Version to 1.0 after Testing.\r\n\r\nV0.3\r\n- Fixed 2 Bugs found in 0.2 (Please re-download if you got 0.2 & replace)\r\n\r\nv0.2\r\n- New Books\r\n- Journals\r\n- New Weapons (Recipes + Smith Upgrade)\r\n\r\n*Coming Soon-er\\\\or later*\r\n- New Spells\r\n- New Dungeons\\\\encounters\r\n- New lies... ehm ehm I mean truths, yupe truths\r\n_________________________________________\r\n=======\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\n- deadevil_x: I\\'d like to thank my dear friend for his supported and helpful ideas.\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1252205\r\n\r\n- Shawkab: I\\'d like to thank Shawkab for helping my with a few problems I was stuck behind, plus his mod is an inspiration really!\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6032\r\n\r\n- I\\'d like to also thank everyone for their comments and ideas so far, noting that I didn\\'t ignore any helpful advice or comment.",
