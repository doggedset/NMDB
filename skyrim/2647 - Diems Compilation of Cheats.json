  "descriptionHtml": "Hello, Diem here. This is a compilation of 4+ BAT files and one I.D.\\\\cheat list.\r\nBasically, this is for you who like to cheat or who beat the game and lost their stuff in a crash. We have all had that happen before. \r\n\r\nFILES:\r\n______\r\nGoodMagic: This adds some cool spells to your spell book and it makes your character had 9000 magicka. Winning\r\n\r\nGoodDaggers: This adds two ebony daggers, daedric daggers, Keenings and Mehrunes Razors as well as the Assassin\\'s Dagger perk.\r\n\r\nGoodMasks: This adds all of the dragon priest masks but the main one which you get by equiping the wooden mask and putting all of the masks in the appropriate places.\r\n\r\nGoodLocks: This gives you the Skeleton Key and all of the lockpicking perks. No more keys for the win\r\n\r\nList o\\' Cheats: This has an ID list for those item I bothered to look up. That took forever. The <br> is for a break in a book. I will make this into a book when the Creation Kit comes out or if I get into the mood I\\'ll use TESsnip... This also contains a list of funny\\\\good cheats at the top. Enjoy\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n_____________\r\n\r\nTo install, extract the files to a temporary location. Copy the files to your Skyrim directory/folder. The default folder for Windows 7 is C:/Program Files(x86)/Steam/Steam Apps/common/Skyrim/\r\nDelete your temporary location (NOT your Skyrim Directory)\r\nLast but not least, look at the BAT files. They all start with Good. See which ones you want to use then player Skyrim. Open up the console and type bat \\\"(whatever bat you want\\\" without the quotes and parenthesis. You can only enter in one BAT each command. Save and exit your game then re-load the game so you can earn achievments. \r\n\r\nBUGS:\r\n_______\r\nYes, after 30 minutes of release I have found bugs. \r\nThere is a bug where the Adept locks perk doesn\\'t get unlocked.
