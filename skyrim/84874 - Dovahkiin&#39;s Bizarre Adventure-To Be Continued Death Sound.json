  "descriptionHtml": "What:Â \r<br />This small mod replaces that hum-drum death sound with something a little more bizarre. The song is the same one used in the famous &#34;To Be Continued&#34; meme; true art indeed. The actual song is called &#34;Roundabout&#34; By 70&#39;s Progressive rock band Yes. Other JoJo mods are recommended for the best experience.\r<br />\r<br />Why: Your next line is: &#34;Why would you make this?&#34;\r<br />My answer: A wise artist once asked: &#34;Does art imitate life? Or does life imitate art?&#34; I don&#39;t know the answer to that question, but to answer yours, I made this because I thought it would be fun, sheesh...\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t think this mod has any copyright issues, there&#39;s one very similar mod for F04 which I recommend, it inspired me to do this. Thanks to whomever downloads this.",
