  "descriptionHtml": "Whenever I download a player home, I end up taking 20 minutes adding all the trophy items by console. I made this bat file for my own convenience and decided to upload it for other's uses.\n<br />\n<br />I made these for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4138425?tab=user+files]skyrimlazz's [/url]﻿[b]amazing[/b] player homes (especially Dragonfall Castle) but it's not like it won't work for other homes with trophy rooms.\n<br />\n<br />This file includes all dragon priest masks, daedric artifacts, dragon claws, dawnguard paragons, black books, bugs in a jar, elder scrolls, amulets, other special books, notable weapons (auriel's bow, wuuthrad, etc) and other miscellaneous (like the skull key, draw knife,  olava's token, etc). \n<br />\n<br />To access, just hit your ~ key in game and type \"bat decor\" without the quotes.\n<br />\n<br />To install, drop in your skyrim directory (steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim for steam users). Don't drop it in your Data folder, that's a step too far. \n<br />I've never used NMM to install bat files, so idk how it deals with it, so use mod managers at your own risk I guess!\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to comment other trophy items that I could add. Enjoy!",
