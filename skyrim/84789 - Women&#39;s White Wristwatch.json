  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a free modder&#39;s resource/blender file because I have absolutely no idea how to turn it into a wearable/equippable item into Skyrim. If you have the technical knowledge of how to do this, please do so, but please give me credit for it.\r<br />\r<br />The only requirement that I know of is the latest version of blender.\r<br />\r<br />Getting it into the game as an item might require nifskope and/or outfit studio, and since it comes in a zip file, you might need to use winrar.\r<br />\r<br />This mesh has an extremely high polygon count, over 30,000 in fact, so scaling that down might be important for in-game use. It also needs to be textured accordingly, preferably white plastic, but silver would also work well.\r<br />\r<br />This was designed after an actual women&#39;s sportswatch, and is intended for female characters, but there is no reason why it can&#39;t be worn by men as well.\r<br />",
