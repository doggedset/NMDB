Right now there&#39;s only one set on the gear table at The Palace of Kings, but I plan to figured out how to make it available for purchase only from the blacksmith in Windhelm. you can get yourself a set though console commands if you don&#39;t want to steal the existing set off the table.\r<br />\r<br />                                                         How To Install\r<br />\r<br />Installing is a simple matter of moving the .esp and .bsa files to the data file. Make sure to check it in the load mod section and then enjoy :)",
