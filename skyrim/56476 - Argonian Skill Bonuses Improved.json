  "descriptionHtml": "This mod simply makes Argonian starting Skill Bonuses more useful.\r<br />\r<br />Instead of having +10 Lockpicking, they now have +10 Alchemy, since it makes more sense with the Lore and Lockpicking is generally useless skill to have such a big bonus to.\r<br />\r<br />They now also have +5 to One Handed instead of +5 to pickpocket, just so they can perform better in combat.\r<br />Argonians can now also do Combat underwater.\r<br />\r<br />Hope you like this mod, and if you do, don&#39;t forget to Endorse :)\r<br />",
