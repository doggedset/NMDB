  "descriptionHtml": "Hi, this is a project that i´ve started but unfortunately i dont have the time and the knowledge about 3dmax and creation kit to finish this. The idea is basically make a heavy armor with some parts of the dragon priest armor and the miraak robes. Also make a crown instead of the dragon priest mask and a ring using the mesh of the shoulder part of the cultist robes. I think that dragonscale boots whit a good retexture could be better for this heavy armor.",
