All meshes and textures used by the tutorials are included as resources.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nDetails:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nMany simple, yet useful texture animations can be created directly in NifSkope, without the use of an animation program, by inserting a few simple controller blocks.\r\n\r\nThe tutorials in this resource explain how this is done, demonstrating the concepts using sample meshes and textures included in the package. Demonstrations include the creation of scrolling and zooming animations, glow animations, color changes, and transparency animations, alone and in combination with each other. The creation of Gamebryo animation sequences that can be accessed from Papyrus scripts is demonstrated as well.\r\n\r\nSome understanding of the structure of a .nif file and basic NifSkope editing skills are required to follow these demonstrations. The reader should also be familiar, at least, with the basic concept of animation using key frames, but does not need to have any in-depth knowledge of the subject. Some understanding of the UV map and its purpose is needed for the demonstrations in Part I. Knowledge of how colors are described numerically using RGB values is needed for the demonstrations in Part II.\r\n\r\n=========================\r\nInstallation (Manual):\r\n=========================\r\n\r\n1) Extract the contents of the archive to any folder.\r\n2) Copy the contents of the Data folder to the Skyrim Data folder.\r\n3) Read the tutorial.\r\n\r\n============================\r\nUn-Installation (Manual):\r\n============================\r\n\r\n1) Delete the tutorial and the demonstration resources.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nChange log:\r\n==================\r\n\r\n2013.11.09 - Initial Release\r\n2013.11.13 - Version 2.0 Release\r\n\r\n==================\r\nContact Details:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nBrettM @ http://tesalliance.org.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nCredits:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\nThanks to Dwiss for brainstorming session that helped me figure out how this worked, and for encouraging me to write it up for the benefit of others.\r\nThanks to the modding community at the TES Alliance for all-around goodness.\r\n\r\n[url=http://solitarius-advena.deviantart.com/art/Solitarius-Stars-71814237]Solitarius Stars[/url] (Brushes) by Solitarius Advena @ deviantArt.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nTools Used:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nCreation Kit\r\nNifSkope\r\nPaintShop Pro X5\r\nnvidia DDS plug-in\r\nInsanitySorrow's ReadMe Generator\r\n\r\n==================\r\nPermissions:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThis file will be hosted at TESA and Skyrim Nexus.
