  "descriptionHtml": "i use a few naruto mods for my game such as naruto jutsu&#39;s, the uchiha clan, naruto overhaul but it felt like there was something missing when i made an uchiha and followed sasuke&#39;s path. i haven&#39;t been able to find a curse mark mod so i finally decided to try and make it myself. this is my first attempt at modding and this isn&#39;t my fully realised idea of what i had in mind but with my lack of experience it&#39;s the best i could do.\r<br />   This mod adds orochimaru&#39;s hideout which is east of riverwood (a little south of the jutsu master hideout if you have that mod). oromaru sells two lesser powers, curse mark stage one and two. stage one gives increase melee damage and increases stamina for 3 minutes. stage two makes you turn entirely black also setting close enemies on fire with increased effects of stage one. also once you activate the power you cannot revert early, you must run the timer out. i dont know how to make a revert spell.\r<br />   I would like to add a stage three where the character might grow horns or wings or tail etc. im not sure how to do this yet but if anyone has suggestions please feel free to talk to me about it. i would also like to add debuffs to the effect like slower magika or stamina regen or a slow consumption of first mana then stamina. i would also like to change the way the power is acquired. instead ofp urchasing i thought it would be better if after some dialogue  with oromaru the character would be bitten (using the vampire lord animations) and recieve stage one, then after some form of progression recieve stage 2 and then 3.\r<br />   like i said this is my first mod and im happy to have made the mod as well as i did to begin with. im looking for someone to help me with this because what im aiming for is far beyond what im capable of at the moment. if anyone wants to tweak it im completely fine with that just let me know so i can see. ",
