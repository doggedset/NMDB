They are similar in many points to the Dremora, but do not have a caste system. Their lack of a caste system fits perfectly with their hatred of subordination and tendency for betrayal. They are also often in the service of Mehrunes Dagon. They can cast a wide variety of spells, including a Clannfear Summon.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/59791-1-1415517900.jpg[/img][/i]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a new race to play as, the Xivilai. The Xivilai are large daedra that serve as the torturers and assassins of Mehrunes Dagon and Molag Bal. They are highly intelligent bruisers, with a high potency for magic and magic absorption. \r<br />\r<br />There are male and female versions of the race, and they are compatible with the Dawnguard DLC. Though due to their daedric nature, they cannot fully become vampires. Though they can gain the powers of a vampire, so they can gain the powers of a vampire lord. Some civilians may be intimidated by you and will comment on it.\r<br />\r<br />There are many different options for horns, hairstyles, eye colors, face tattoos, and facial piercings. You can choose horns and hairstyles under hair, eye colors under eye color, face tattoos under complexion, and facial piercings under facial hair.\r<br />\r<br />Their voices sound like the Dremora, and make Dremora noises, but unlike most faces that use the Dremora voice type, they can shout with voice. This mod also makes it so people playing as Dremora can shout.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Features\r<br />[/b]-Playable Xivilai race\r<br />-A male and female marriageable companion\r<br />-Clannfears\r<br />\r<br />You can find the male companion at the Alchemist&#39;s Shack, and the female companion at Lund&#39;s Hut. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Racial Powers\r<br />[/b]-Resistance to fire \r<br />-Conjure a Clannfear\r<br />-Spell absorption\r<br />-Cold fire\r<br />-They do not have to sell their soul or become a vampire to enter Soul Cairn because of their daedric vestige\r<br />-Weakness to shock\r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements\r<br />[/b]-Daedra of Coldharbour\r<br />-Dawnguard DLC\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits[/b]\r<br />Apachii - Xivilai hair styles\r<br />Alienslof - Facial piercings and xivilai parts\r<br />Aipex8 - Daedra of Coldharbour\r<br />Diethardt - Weathered and worn warpaints\r<br />VectorPlus - Xivilai teeth\r<br />se7engames - Awesome fancy screenshots\r<br />Nuska - Her resources\r<br />dogtown1 - Clannfear",
