This home was once a Dwarven mine. This mine collapsed some many years ago. After the collapse the ancient Nord&#39;s built a stronghold in the center. The only Remanence of Dwarven inhabitance is the ruins up on the surface and the ancient Magi pool located in the center of the Nord stronghold. A few servants have been handed to you, they will sweep and clean. We have summoned some Sovngarde mages to help us understand the buildings history. They say that the old Smugglers passage is active, providing quick access to the Solitude Docks. The Nord family crypt is located in the stronghold cathedral. I will be in the master bed room if you need me.\r<br />\r<br />Yours faithfully\r<br />Adam, Cahill[/I]\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/s4hPh6h.jpg[/IMG]",
