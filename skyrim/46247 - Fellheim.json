  "summary": "This is Fellheim. A splayer home in the mountains near Ivarstead. This mod was my very first mod (made before Sutvaka) and now uploaded to nexus.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to the Fellheim fortified estate. A medium/large (not so lore friendly) player home situated near Ivarstead. To get to the estate you have to head north and follow the river until you come across a bridge which leads to the estate. The gate can be opened with a pullbar which is on the wall to your left (right next to the pillar inside the entryway).\r\n\r\nThe house is equiped with all the workbenches you might need. But the most are hidden away in the secret cambers wich can be entered through the secret passage in the main house. If you have played Dawnguard you'll have no trouble in finding the entrance. However the basics for sharpening and improving can also be found in the gatehouse / baracks.\r\nTo acces some areas you need the Fellheim master key wich can be located on top of the counter in the kitchen (as seen on the screenshot). One of these area's is the escape tunnel which leads to the base of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 versions:\r\nThe original Dawnguard version and the Dawnguard free version. The Dawnguard version is more suitable for vampire characters and the dawnguard free version comes with a prison.\r\n\r\nHere is a description of what you'll find.\r\n\r\nInside.\r\n- 1 maid\r\n- 1 steward / merchant with plenty of gold.\r\n- a dining / livingroom\r\n- a kitchen\r\n- a Master bedroom\r\n- a cellar with a small armory and servant quarters.\r\n- weaponracks and dummy's\r\n\r\nSecret chambers.\r\n- Everything needed for smithing.\r\n- Alchemy station.\r\n- Enchantment station.\r\n- Plenty of displays and dummy's\r\n- And a secret room within the secret chambers.\r\n\r\nOutside.\r\n- 4 guards who patrol around the entrance (they are also avaible as followers)\r\n- guard baracks / gatehouse\r\n- a watchtower with a view\r\n- a garden with alchemy ingredients.\r\n- a couple of chickens.\r\n\r\nEverything is fully navmeshed so you can bring in your own followers. \r\nThe chests are safe to store your items.\r\n\r\nThis was my first (public) Mod and i hope you guys will enjoy it!\r\nIf you like the mod please rate and comment.\r\n\r\nThis mod conflicts with Shatterhorn castle because they are both practicly on the same location.\r\n",
