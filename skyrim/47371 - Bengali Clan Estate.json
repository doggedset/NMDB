  "summary": "This mods adds a rather elaborate and sprawling Manor, as well as a Tower to the environment of Skyrim, which is not only intended as a player home, but to make life in Skyrim a bit easier, by providing all the modern and convenient amenities all in one place, including semi-automated inventory sorting.  Fully navmeshed and follower-friendly, and d",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mods comes in several versions: 1) the full version, which has been updated to include DLC content, and has the full estate, Tower, and Storage Room; 2) the Storage Room only version, non-DLC; and 3) the full mod, non-DLC.\r<br />\r<br />I will no longer be supporting the non-DLC versions (v3.1a and lower), as with the Skyrim Ultimate Edition, all the DLC is included, so likely, a non-DLC version is pointless.  The last non-DLC version will be v3.1a.\r<br />\r<br />I intend to continue to support the Storage Room only version, but it will require DLC (this is essentially a strip-down version of the main mod, but is much more compact, so appears to have less conflicts with other mods.\r<br />\r<br />I am no longer supporting Steam Workshop, other than comments and such, as I am too frustrated with the whole upload process, which is wonky at best.\r<br />\r<br />While I note in the version history that I consider things in “ALPHA Phase”, the mod itself is fully functional as-is; only the quest for the sale of the estate is still non-functional, so I see things as “ALPHA”.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Entrances:\r<br />The main manor entrance is over by Lake Llinalta, about SE of Half-Moon Mill, and almost directly south of The Lady Stone.  The Armory trap door is literally just inside the gate you use to enter Riverwood the very first time. Go through the gate, and turn a hard right, and you&#39;ll see it against the wall. The Storage Room (the crowning achievement to the mod IMHO) is under the ledge at the end of that same wall, on the other side of the stairs and over the fence.  The entrance to the tower is about 2/3 the distance between Riverwood and the bridge near Honningbrew Meadery, on the east side of the river.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Copy the following files into your Skyrim/Data folder:\r<br />\t(For the main mod version)\r<br />\tKenti_Warehouse_Skyrim.bsa &lt;-- archive file with the scrips, textures, and sounds\r<br />\tKenti_Warehouse_Skyrim.esp &lt;-- main module plug-in file\r<br />\r<br />\t(For the Storage Room only version)\r<br />\tKenti_StrgRoom_Skyrim.bsa &lt;-- archive file with the scrips and textures\r<br />\tKenti_StrgRoom_Skyrim.esp &lt;-- module plug-in file\r<br />\r<br />Optionally, there are several files which you can use if you want:\r<br />\tKenti_Khajiit_Mannequin.esp &lt;-- changes the mannequins into Khajiit (male, in vanilla and\r<br />\t\tDLC houses)\r<br />\tKenti_Khajiit_Housecarls.esp &lt;-- changes all the player-related housecarls into Khajiit; this\r<br />\t\tis ONLY a race change, and all their voices, weapons, armor, and behaviors remain\r<br />\t\tthe same as originally designed.\r<br />\r<br />Final Step: in the “Data Files” of the launcher, select any of the above files and place them into the load order as needed (I highly recommend using BOSS).\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: you CANNOT run the estate version together with the Storage Room only version&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Deinstallation:\r<br />\t1) from within the game, collect ALL of your things from any and every room in the mod or\r<br />\t\tyou’ll lose them all;\r<br />\t2) do a full save - not a quicksave or autosave;\r<br />\t3) exit the game, and then delete any of the above files from your Skyrim/Data folder;\r<br />\t4) re-enter the game, and do another full save;\r<br />\t5) exit the game, and then re-enter the game, and reload your latest saved game;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Room / Cell Descriptions:\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Kenti_Manor&#34;

fixed the staff supplies chest in Playpen facing wrong way; fixed silver sword temper which had ebony required instead of silver; added tempering for warrior (Blades-based) and wolf (Companions-based) armors; added DLC content from add-in into main mod, including crossbows and bolts, trophy bases into Storage Room, Playpen, and Tower Armory; added staff crafting table and supplies chest into Storage Room, Playpen, Tower Storage, and Tower Master Quarters; expanded the Storage Room display/armory room to increase the number of mannequins and weapon racks; (not working yet) added spawning buttons to large dwemer room which was otherwise unused to create an arena-like area; combined “Protection” and “Rogue” into a single enchantment to use on armors and jewelry; created rings, circlets, and amulet with the new enchantment; recovered the original sound/voice files for Do’rhen and Ra’drif and incorporated them into a new BSA file;\r<br />\r<br />v3.1a - (17Nov13) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; fixed all armor and rings lacking description; fixed teleport pull-bar to say &#34;Teleporter&#34;; combined &#34;Mage&#34; and &#34;Artisan&#34; enchantments into an single &#34;Energies&#34; enchantment; added book sorting capabilities; added silver weapon crafting and tempering; removed the storage area from the Playpen, as there’s no point, and added a cozy, walled-in bed instead; removed the display cases and tables in the corner of the Storage Room’s display area, to make way for a DLC add-in; added new tower house (because I as bored) based on the tower at the College of Winterhold with additional Dwemer architecture and features (incorporates all features of the Storage Room, including sorting); created a DLC add-in which includes a bunch of Dawnguard items re-enchanted, staff crafting tables in the Storage Room, the Tower Storage Room, and the Master’s Quarters, and trophy bases in the armories and Playpen; \r<br />\r<br />v3.0a - (09Nov13) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete (but I did get a bit further on the scripting for the quest, thus v3.0&#33;); added teleport pull-bar next to the ladder, to TP to any of the houses (I didn’t TP /in/ the houses, as there’s too many house mods out there); added a spell and tome for teleporting to the Storage Room; added a strongbox (identical to the one next to the armory door) next to the Storage Room door; thi\r<br />\r<br />v2.9a - (19Oct13) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; delved into the world of object scripting and added into the Storage Room: button to put all PC inventory in choice of two safes; button to put all PC inventory into choice of four junk chests; “Sell Barrel” to sell all items place into it (or just get rid of them); to replace the inventory safes, created more generic safes (6 total) next to the alchemy table; redid a few sorters to include more categories of items;\r<br />\r<br />v2.85a - (13Oct13) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; updated navmesh inside Storage Room around the open chests;\r<br />\r<br />v2.82a - (05Oct13) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; fixed a lot of navmesh problems, so now the followers can enter the rooms; thanx to &#34;saunders.bryan&#34; for the feedback which provided the impetus to fix it all (and wow&#33; were there some issues&#33;);\r<br />\r<br />v2.8a - (04Oct13) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; added auto-sorting functionality (only in Strg Room); added “Kenti’s Hyper-Arrow” and forge recipe (stupid-level of damage); all credit for the sorting functionality goes to”cire992” who created “Orlong’s Hearth”, found at --&gt; http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8684//? &lt;-- which I modded a bit and consolidated so I could add it into this mod (used with permission, thank you cire992&#33;&#33;);\r<br />\r<br />v2.75a - (02Jun13) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; put sets of Artesian and Mage jewelry into Enchanted Jewelry Safe, as it wouldn’t work in the main chest; renamed and moved Strong Box for Dragonborn questline; added Fur Boots to special safe; removed Nahkriin from armor chests; tried to make Detect Life ring, but couldn’t make a ring with that capability (and scrolls wouldn’t work as desired);\r<br />\r<br />v2.7a - (17Mar13) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; added an “Artesian’s Ring” and an “Artesian’s Amulet” to aid in alchemy, enchanting, and smithing, giving bonuses to those skills; added two open chests at the end of the bed in the Storage Room to put in all the neat rocks one might collect; v2.72a added amulet, rings, and circlets for Mage skills;\r<br />\r<br />v2.6a - (07Aug12) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; fixed several reference issues in the .esp file (unintended changes to other game parameters); fixed an issue with J’darii’s equipage, which wasn’t working quite right (it’s all non-playable so didn’t effect gameplay); changed the stats on the various weapons to be a little less destructive while in combat (though they’re still rather “unbalanced” and powerful); this update was in prep for a companion mod which pulls in various Dawnguard toys;\r<br />\r<br />v2.5a - (06Aug12) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; fixed J’darii’s coloration issue; fixed mannequin issues (I think) by upgrading scripts; added 4 more strong-boxes to cover the missing questlines, namely, College of Winterhold and Dawnguard, and then added two more “spares” for future expansion;\r<br />\r<br />v2.4a - (29Jul12) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; fixed the tracking rings, which stopped working for some reason; added smelting ability for gold ore/ingot into coin and coin into ingots; added ability to craft (all) and improve (most) Bengali items; added ability to craft (“cook”) skooma and high-grade skooma; added ability to craft (“cook”) a cure-all potion;\r<br />\r<br />v2.35a - (28Jul12) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; renamed several strongboxes for Civil War and Companions (this shouldn’t require removal and re-add of player inventory, as the boxes are the same, just with a different name); added functionality for Carlota’s “Khajiit Marriage Mod” for J’darii (marriage with him won’t function correctly without that mod also in-use); added a new, ebony-based armor set for J’darii; added a new ebony-based armor set, named for Kharjo (because I think Kharjo is awesome&#33;); added Wolf Armor-based armor;\r<br />\r<br />v2.3a - (22Jul12) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; added a shrine area in the Playpen (as that’s where there was easy-access room) and updated the navmesh.\r<br />\r<br />v2.2a - (13Jul12) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; added another “quest” and a single ring for combined but individualized tracking of the Khajiit caravans; added an NPC follower, a small but very aggressive Khajiit named J’darii who can be found in Rorikstead in the Frostfruit Inn.\r<br />\r<br />v2.15a - (06Jul12)  still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; added three more “quests” and associated tracking rings for the Khajiit caravans;\r<br />\r<br />v2.1a - (02Jul12) still in ALPHA phase as the quests are still incomplete; fixed the in-game issue of the manor being invisible (random); fixed merchant issue of the brothers having too much gold in their stash which caused the in-game gold exchange system to be non-functional (now they have 64k in gold); fixed the safes’ “gold glitch” where they display multiple lines for the same amount of gold; changed the two “Books” bookcases to be “Books A-M” and “Books N-Z” for a little added itemization; changed the “hypersonic” arrows to include a crit hit pin limbs possibility and “pass through small transparent”; added strong boxes on top of the safes for itemizing gold stashes, such as for the Thieves Guild and Dark Brother quest lines (6 total); added Firewood into the Gem/Ingot/Ore chests, as this is used for some weapon improvements; added Thieves Guild Leader based armor; removed the in-game Ebony weapons from the tables (only the specialized ones remain);\r<br />\r<br />v2.0a/v2.01a - (16May12/18May12) ALPHA phase&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; fixed issue of Ra’drif wandering all over creation; added the first of the quests to the mod, the entire set of which will eventually allow the player to be informed of, and then do the quest which will enable them to obtain the entire bengali estate from the NPC Khajiit brothers, Ra’drif and Do’rhen; first quest is a letter from Ra’drif via courier informing the player the estate is available (Quest ID: “kenti_bcq00”); the third (Quest ID: “kenti_bcq08” for Ra’drif) and forth (Quest ID: “kenti_bcq09” for Do’rhen) quests are effectively the same, which added rings (on the side of the Storage Room trapdoor) which when taken into the player’s inventory (or worn) will put up a misc quest which will add a compass target to track whichever brother the player is searching for (take the ring, tracking enabled; drop the ring, tracking disabled); there is not currently a working quest which will actually enable the player to get the estate; removed hireling capability from Do’rhen;\r<br />\r<br />v1.9 - (13May12) added two NPCs, “Ra’drif” and “Do’rhen” who are Khajiit brothers, which will be used for a quest for the player to obtain the estate; added merchant capability to Ra’drif and Do’rhen with plenty of gold to be able to buy most anything from the player, including stolen items; Ra’drif was placed in Solitude’s Winking Skeever and Do’rhen is in Windhelm’s Candlehearth Hall; added hireling capability to Do’rhen, but I cannot figure out how to change the pricing, and I don’t have any good docs as to the “proper” way to make a hireling, so this aspect will be removed in the version with quests;\r<br />\r<br />v1.8 - (11May12) added MineField room for ore and ingots; found a new location and placed the Manor back in-world, so the player can find it; eventually, there will be NPC(s) and a quest to obtain the keys;\r<br />\r<br />v1.7 - (03May12) removed several unused in-world references which might have been causing conflicts with other mods; added Blades-based heavy armor set; added a Circlet of Protection; added two new fine clothes types; added four “sort later” chests and corrected the respawn issues with the mannequins and cases in the Storage Room;\r<br />\r<br />v1.6 - (20Apr12) revision to Storage Room, which added a large Display Room, somewhat akin to an armory, as there are both mannequins and weapons holders, though they are intended for displaying items such as all the badge-of-office weapons for becoming Thane in the Holds or gift weapons; display cases and tables added for showing off all the Dragon Claws, Daedric Quest items, and Dragon Priest masks; corrected lighting issues (too many light sources);\r<br />\r<br />v1.5 - (18Apr12) minor change; fixed the floor in the Storage Room, which apparently oopsed during the expansion, and caused the textures to not line up; no changes to anything else; fixed because it was annoying but has tested as compatible with games already in-play with v1.4 (as in, no losses of already stored inventory);\r<br />\r<br />v1.4 - (12Apr12) expanded Storage Room by one section to make things more practical and less crowded; corrected the issues of storage chests respawning and deleting all contents previously placed into them (corrected in Storage Room and Playpen); moved safes to same side of Storage Room as chests for ease of sorting; created and added itemized safes (rather than the 8 generic ones) for ease of sorting (Playpen and Storage Room); added cooking pot to the forge firepit and a crafting anvil in keeping with the “everything-in-one-place” philosophy of the Storage Room; added navmesh to the Storage Room; added map marker “Bengali Manor - Storage” so it’s visible on map in-world; modified the gravity variable back to 0.35 on all arrows to better align with crosshair; set speed on bow to be 0.875 to match Imperial and Falmer bows;\r<br />\r<br />v1.3 - (19Mar12) fixed room boundary oops which was cutting the Storage Room in half; fixed &#34;clothes&#34; chest which had no name; fixed safes, which were no longer locked and didn&#39;t have gold as planned; fixed exit location in Riverwood (at end of city wall, under wood platform);\r<br />\r<br />v1.2 - (17Mar12) created Storage Room, with chests, bookcases, and safes, with full crafting suite, and bed; secondary entrance on ramp end of west city wall of Riverwood, under ramp; removed manor from in-world to eliminate conflict with &#34;Dovakiin&#39;s Hideout&#34; mod; will place again later when a new location is found; new cell for storage room, so now five total cells in mod;\r<br />\r<br />v1.1.3 - (14Mar12, rev 3) added new armor based on Dragonscale armor;\r<br />\r<br />v1.1.2 - (14Mar12, rev 2) added bow and arrows to arsinal;\r<br />\r<br />v1.1.1 - (14Mar12, rev 1) added new armor based on Nightingale armor;\r<br />\r<br />v1.0 - (09Mar12) all external designs are done, selected site outside of Whiterun, but decided against it; all internals designed and connected based on external design; putting in secondary entrance in Riverwood; main house and such east of Riverwood; discovered later, house is on top of Dovakiin&#39;s Hideout entrance; this will be fixed in a future revision so it will not conflict;\r<br />\r<br />v0.5 - (01Mar12) discovered during testing, character could no longer enter the cell; split the cell into three additional cells to ease required horsepower; three new cells are now manor, playpen, and armory; original cell now called “scratch_cell”. \r<br />\r<br />v0.4 -(28Feb12) &#34;armory&#34; is finished with a bunch of mannequins and weapon racks aplenty; created room markers to aid the game engine and minimize lag;\r<br />\r<br />v0.3 - (22Feb12) wanted a way to go on a lock-pick frenzie to increase that skill, so &#34;playpen&#34; was built for that purpose, but also became a catch-all and storage room; full suite of crafting stuffs; all the various chests full of everything are here;\r<br />\r<br />v0.2 - finished manor, but no room for things like armory or storage, so will build those seperately; everything tests okay right now and appears accessible from in-world;\r<br />\r<br />v0.1 - added sword based on ebony sword; added LH & RH daggers, based on ebony dagger; added robes, clothes, and boots; added amulet of protection; added gold and silver rings of rogue skills, one set with inviso; created misc chests for stuffs;\r<br />",
