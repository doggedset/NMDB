  "summary": "A small mod which makes Helgen Keep usable as a player home.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Created by request, this mod disables the blocks which prevent the player from waiting inside Helgen Keep, replaces its containers with identical, non-respawning ones, and replaces the beds with ones you can sleep in. There&#39;s a lever in the circular entrance (the one used by the Stormcloak in the intro).\r<br />\r<br />Credit for idea: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/65296/?]taro8[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Changes made before the lever is pulled:\r<br />[list][*]Waiting in area is allowed[*]A few containers are now non-respawning (bags, barrels, and the boss chest)[/list]\r<br />Changes made after the lever is pulled:\r<br />[list][*]Lever itself is disabled[*]Remaining chests and beds are replaced with non-respawning counterparts[/list]\r<br />\r<br />Nothing else has been changed. I was going to get rid of the dead bodies, but that the effort required to do so and include all the enemies that died instead of only the ones dead to begin with is disproportionate to the actual result. Anyway, since nothing else was changed, the block near the end is still in place. So, you can&#39;t get back to the spider area.\r<br />\r<br />The cell itself never resets in vanilla apparently (even if the containers do), so that shouldn&#39;t be an issue.\r<br />\r<br />Want something changed, added, fixed? Let me know, and I&#39;ll do my best.\r<br />\r<br />Incompatible withÂ Starting Spells Begone.",
