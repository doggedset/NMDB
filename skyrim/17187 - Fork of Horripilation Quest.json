  "descriptionHtml": "Possible Update with New, Better Rewards in The Works! (If I can keep it from breaking the script...)\r\n\r\nThe Fork of Horripilation Quest\r\nA Quest by: Rifli\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n----------------\r\n\\\"Why is Big-Head not in Skyrim? Big-Head wishes to be. The fork is there. Master is there. Why can Big-Head not be there? Even if it is too cold for Big-Head.\\\"\r\n-Big-Head, on his opinion of Skyrim.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a new quest to Skyrim, The Fork of Horripilation. This mod is a semi-short quest centered on meeting Big-Head, fighting the Nasty Man (the thief who stole the Fork), and retrieving the Fork from him. Big-Head can be found in the Pelagius Wing of the Blue Palace, down the stairs from the Sheogorath quest. This is a full side quest, with journal entries and a leveled reward. This quest is semi-lore friendly, as it adds a recurring character and Daedric artifact. The Fork comes with a curse that drains your magicka by 200 points when equipped. This mod is intended for Big-Head fans, people looking for new quests, people looking to add old characters and artifacts to Skyrim, and Sheogorath lovers. The Fork can be taken from Big-Head after the quest (But come on! You just helped the poor guy out!) and is fully usable and temperable. The requirements are interesting, and may take some time to track down. As of this time, the quest does not have voice acting, but does have a blank sound file so that the subtitles are readable. Please turn subtitles on!\r\n\r\nConstructive feedback, complements, and suggestions are all appreciated. Please thank PrivateEye for his Fork of Horripilation modder\\'s resource. Pictures of the Fork and/or quest in action are encouraged!\r\n\r\nNote: I\\'ve added a book to the Nasty Man\\'s location that gives info on the back-story and tempering recipe of the Fork. The Nasty Man\\'s Journal also gives clues to the recipe, but in somewhat more mixed up terms.\r\n\r\nCurrent Features\r\n------------------------\r\n-A fully formed quest\r\n-Dialogue\r\n-A leveled reward\r\n-Two new NPC\\'s\r\n-The Fork of Horripilation (Credits to PrivateEye)\r\n-The Curse of the Fork (Credits to PrivateEye)\r\n-Two new books\r\n-Schedules for the NPC\\'s\r\n-Journal entries\r\n-Map markers\r\n-Semi-Lore Friendly Inventory for Big-Head (forks anyone?)\r\n\r\nPossible Future Features\r\n----------------------------------\r\n-Voice acting\r\n-Longer quest\r\n-Follower Functionality for Big-Head\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n------\r\nNone known so far in the newest version.\r\n\r\nPlease report any and all bugs to me over comments or PM\\'s.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n---------------\r\nSimply download the file and extract the ESP and folders into the \\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\" (without quotes) or your corresponding folder.\r\n\r\nUninstallation\r\n-------------------\r\nSimply delete the ESP and related files from your \\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\" (without quotes) or your corresponding folder.\r\n\r\nIncompatibilities\r\n-----------------------\r\n-Dwemer Spectres\r\n-The Fork of Horripilation - A Morrowind artifact for Skyrim (the Fork is included in this mod)\r\n-Potentially other mods that affect the Reachwindeyrie01 interior cell and the Bluepalacewing01 interior cell\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n----------\r\nPrivateEye- For making the Fork\\'s textures, model, and curse script.
