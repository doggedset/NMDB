  "descriptionHtml": "Finally got around to making my very first mod ever, to be more specific, a weapon mod!\r\nThe Obsidian blade is craftable and can be improved, however you will need daedric smithing and probably magic smithing aswell, more on that when I\\'ve tested it. The blade is slightl stronger than the daedric sword, slightly faster, and has a ton of charges for its enchantment. The model was made by me using ZBrush, 3ds max and photoshop. I think it looks pretty neat, tho I would probably spend more time on my specular mapping if I\\'d redo it. Probably should have spend a bit more time on the whole thing, but meh :D\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso! Check out my new mod, Talos\\' Greatsword! It is looking a LOT better than this ^^;\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17783] Talos\\' GreatSword[/url]\r\n/////\r\n\r\nMod used for the armor: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11259]Alduin\\'s Scale Armor[/url]",
