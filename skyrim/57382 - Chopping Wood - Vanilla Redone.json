  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red][heading]Chopping Wood[/heading][/color]\r<br />[i]If you like it - Feedback appreciated[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Description:[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Ever wondered why you can fast mine ore veins via attacking but have to sit back and watch a long animation just to gather two pieces of firewood?Â \r<br />I did so I wrote this little mod. Now you can harvest firewood like you get your minerals.\r<br />\r<br />[b]All you need:[/b] Your usual woodcutters axe or any other piece that was able to harvest firewood before. Just attack the woodcutting block and earn your firewood. 1 attack = 1 firewood\r<br />\r<br />Maybe you will ask me ask, why I wrote this one instead using one of the other billions of woodcutting mods. Simple, neither of them used my approach and simply edited the value you get by the woodcutting animation. Something I didn&#39;t like.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]FAQ:[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: [b]Dragonborn[/b] (Yes&#33; There is another woodcutting block in the addon). There won&#39;t be a Skyrim only version.\r<br />Mod conflicts: There should be none other then those who change the same objects. Checked against USKP/UDBP (2.0.6) =&gt; No problems.\r<br />Languages available: Compatible with ANY&#33;\r<br />Clean: Yes. Cleaned with TES5Edit\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Installation:[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Use Nexus Mod Manager\r<br />Alternatively download and unpack files to your Skyrim/Data directory and activate the .esp\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Future Plans:[/b][/u]\r<br />None.",
