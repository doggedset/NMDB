  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new imperial race follower/marriage candiate to the game. Her name is Katsumi Aiko, and shes a mage who knows the basic destruction spells, basic healing spells, and the bound bows and sword spells. She is essential and like I said before marriagable. She uses a custom class, I made for her because I couldn\\'t find one I thought would fit her. She will level up the destruction, light armor, and conjuration stats. Speaking of level, she will also level up as you level up. She can be found living in a tent on the road to whiterun from riverwood, and she travels into town each day.\r\n\r\nKatsumi\\'s schedule: At 8 she will be in Dragonsreach working with Farengar part time, at 3 she will be at the bannered mare having her lunch/dinner and just hanging out there, at 6 she will be back at her tent. On Saturday\\'s and Sunday\\'s she will be in the market place at 8, instead of at dragonsreach because those are her day\\'s off.\r\n\r\nRecommended Mods(if you want her like what I have in the picture):\r\nCalientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- by Caliente: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\nBetter Females by Bella by BellaGail: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nMy other mods:\r\nCave Story-wip- characters: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15266\r\nKaraValentia: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15850\r\n\r\nCredit: \r\nBethesda for making the game and the creation kit.\r\nSkyrim Nexus for a place to share mods\r\n\r\nNote: Please tell me how you like this follower after using",
