  "descriptionHtml": "Naturalis Glarea, or Natural Grit, is an ENB which seeks to make the weather and lighting of Skyrim much more realistic whilst also maintaining enhancing the vanilla game&#39;s gritty aesthetic. \r<br />\r<br />Clear and sunny skies will result in pleasant, bright days, whilst overcast, cloudy or stormy weathers will result in much darker, greyer exteriors. Sunrises and sunsets during clear skies are a sight to behold. Nights are realistic, the level of darkness is heavily dependent not only on the time of day, but also the weather conditions. \r<br />\r<br />This ENB was built on the .266 binary and uses the full ELE Suite (http://enbdev.com/enbseries/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1930) and Relighting Skyrim as its base lighting mods. I will not provide support for ELFX, RLO, Pure Weather or CoT, this is ENB is technically compatible with these mods but it will look very different to my screenshots and will likely require a lot of tweaking in the GUI, but feel free to try this preset out with other lighting mods, half the fun of ENBs is experimenting and tweaking them yourself&#33; \r<br />\r<br />This ENB also utilizes the Particle Patch from Mindflux (http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1499)\r<br />\r<br />This is performance friendly ENB, exteriors rarely dip below 35 FPS even in performance heavy areas like Morthal, and interiors maintain 50-60 FPS on my rig which is:\r<br />i5 3570K 3.4ghz\r<br />8GB RAM\r<br />GTX 660ti (lightly overclocked)\r<br />\r<br />As with most ENBs, this will remain a constant WIP but I figured it was finally at a stage where I could release it to the public",
