  "descriptionHtml": "This mod beefs up horses without making them invincible.\r\n\r\nIt changes horse levels, base health and stamina, and damage multiplier.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Regular horse-\r\nLevel: 4 --> 15\r\nHealth: 289 --> 632\r\nStam: 126 --> 148\r\nDmg: 10 --> 20\r\n\r\n-Frost-\r\nLevel: 25 --> 40\r\nHealth: 562 --> 957\r\nStam: 168 --> 198\r\nDmg: 10 --> 20\r\n\r\n-Shadowmere-\r\nLevel: 50 (Unchanged)\r\nHealth: 887 --> 1087\r\nStam: 198 --> 218\r\nDmg: 10 --> 30\r\n\r\nAs well as increasing their damage it gives their attack a small chance to stagger.\r\n\r\nINSTALL using either NMM or just by dropping the contained Data folder into your Skyrim directory.\r\n\r\nDue to my limited modding knowledge, this mod will only immediately work on newly acquired horses. You can beef up your current horse by opening the console, clicking on your horse, and typing disable, hit <enter> and then enable, hit <enter>. Be careful before running these commands, however. I don\\'t know if running these can mess with other, more complex horse mods you may happen to be using. From my experience it works fine on vanilla horses.\r\n\r\nIf you want to check your horses new stats, open the console, click on your horse, and type getavinfo health and hit <enter>. You can do this with stamina as well, as well as getlevel to check their new level.\r\n\r\nIf there is a problem with the mod, let me know and I\\'ll try my best to fix it. Any suggestions or requests are also welcome.\r\n",
