  "descriptionHtml": "Disclaimer: This is a REUPLOAD of my first mod&#33; I plan to fix issues as I become more experienced with the CK and GIMP. Please, try to keep criticism constructive. Feedback is very useful&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This sword is a simple standalone re texture of the Imperial Sword so it looks like its made of dragonbone. Its shares the stats of the Dawnguard Dragonbone Sword. It can be crafted at the forge under the steel section (You still need dragon smithing)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Future Updates:\r<br />Better textures (I&#39;m a noob at GIMP software)\r<br />Added to the forge menu (Completed&#33;)\r<br />Allowing tempering (Completed&#33;)\r<br />Make a shield (Texture finished)\r<br />Fix Invisible sword (hopefully I did it&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />Hold on to your butts.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to:\r<br />Bethesda for awesome games and awesome mod support\r<br />Nifskope, Gimp, and the CK programs\r<br />Gopher&#39;s videos for keeping me entertained through the process.",
