  "descriptionHtml": "************************************************************************\r\nA Note to my Friends at Nexus:\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend and I were hit by a drunk driver just before Christmas 2011.  As you can imagine there have been some...distractions.  I have been feeling quite guilty about not being involved with the community and specifically updating this mod, as promised. Although we still have issues we are battling, I am now able to set aside some dedicated Nexus time.\r\n\r\nI was hesitant to log on, as I expected a much deserved stream of obscenities regarding my recent lack of support for this mod.  However, when I logged on, I was pleasantly surprised to find support from you guys, with your endorsements and your kind comments.  Given such difficult times, I\\'m not sure I can tell you how much your gestures are appreciated.\r\n\r\nThus, I\\'d like to give a warm thank you to everyone who has supported Nexus and this little project.  Please check back soon, as I will be updating this project in detail in the coming weeks.  Your support has been quite a motivation.\r\n\r\nOnce again, Thank you!\r\n\r\n~Bevier\r\n\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBevier\\'s Black Thieves Guild Armors v1.0\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to the first full release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nThis mod adjusts the original textures of the entire guild to a theme of black and silver.  It now includes all of the thieves guild armors for both male and female. This includes the light and dark versions of the standard guild armor, the guildmaster\\'s armor and even Karliah\\'s unique armor.\r\n\r\nThe original textures were color replaced and sharpened where needed.  In addition the lighting was adjusted to allow for certain details to show where they would have normally been too dark.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nWhy in His name they decided to make the original Thieves Guild Armor anything but black is beyond me.\r\n\r\nREQUIRED MODS\r\nNone--just the original game.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\nJust unzip and drag & drop the \\\"Data\\\" folder in to the Skyrim core directory.  Merge and overwrite any files as needed.\r\n\r\nFUTURE PLANS\r\nThis is the first full release and I intend on making adjustments in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease do not redistribute this mod without permission!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks & Happy Hunting,\r\n\r\nBevier",
