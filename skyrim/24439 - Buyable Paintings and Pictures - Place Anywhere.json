However, when I did a quick scan of &#34;paintings&#34; on the Nexus, I found out that modding resources had brought paintings to Skyrim, but those paintings weren&#39;t being used. But why should I spend countless hours decorating Skyrim for you? Skyrim is about choice, so you should be able to decorate it yourself.\r<br />\r<br />This was the funnest mod I&#39;ve made yet (and possibly the most polished as well). It was a pleasure working with Artisanix&#39;s modding resource. I hope you have as much fun decorating your homes and dungeons as I had putting this together&#33;\r<br />-Iceburg\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://z13.invisionfree.com/IceburgsSkyrim/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=22002743[/img]\r<br />For those interested in custom paintings: Track this file.\r<br />DONE- I will soon be putting out a [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/articles/407]tutorial so that you can easily add custom paintings with the CK.[/url]\r<br />After that (maybe a week to two weeks from this mod&#39;s release) I&#39;m going to attempt to make it possible to make custom paintings from screenshots – hopefully completely in game. May need use of the console.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/15827-1-1349804517.png[/img]\r<br />Consider [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29424]Painting  in Skyrim[/url] an official DLC for Buyable Paintings. It hugely expands Buyable Paintings by making the over 100 paintings craftable (paintable at an easel). Each painting requires a unique recipe and gives a unique buff when hung and studied.\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;d like to move around more than paintings, then check out one of my latest mods, [url= http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25068]Placeable Statics - Move Anything[/url]. It allows you to move almost any furniture and container, along with many statics&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Running out of iron ingots for Hearthfire? Running low on firewood and paper for Buyable Paintings and pictures? My new mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25539]Mines and Mills[/url] solves these problems in a lore-friendly way: Friendly mines and mills sell their wares&#33;\r<br />\r<br />For German translation, see [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26815]this mod by Norden.[/url]\r<br />\r<br />For the Chinese translation, see [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30491]this mod by Fdkdk[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/15827-1-1336698264.png [/img]\r<br />Many paintings in the Art Gallery cannot be &#39;activated&#39; which means you can&#39;t read their picture title. This is because house walls don&#39;t have the best collision – the collision protrudes the walls, blocking the paintings. (You&#39;ll see what I mean, but you may not even notice.)\r<br />\r<br />If you experience a bug, let me know. I&#39;ll post it here until it&#39;s fixed in an update. :D\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://z13.invisionfree.com/IceburgsSkyrim/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=22002748[/img]\r<br />I am currently not posting any mods on Steam Workshop. If you see one of my mods on Steam Workshop, please report the file to me. Thanks&#33; :D\r<br />Also, Buyable Paintings, like all my mods, is a Nexus exclusive. Please report any sites that are hosting Buyable Paintings, or it&#39;s translations other than the Nexus. \r<br />Thank you.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/15827-4-1336699170.png[/img]\r<br />Thanks to [url= http://www.creationkit.com/Category:Papyrus]The Creation Kit[/url] and the [url= http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Console]Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages[/url] wikis for providing all the info I needed on everything from script functions to lore&#33; They&#39;re invaluable sites&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Svaalbard for spotlighting my mod. The video really does a good job showing my mod off. :D\r<br />Thanks to Brodual for placing my mod in their Bits &#39;n&#39; Bobs video&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/15827-3-1336699170.png[/img]\r<br />Finally, if you have a great rig and some nice ENB settings, I&#39;d love it if you uploaded some pics of my mod&#33; If you&#39;re really ambitious, I&#39;d love to see someone make a trailer or video of it&#33;\r<br />Thanks&#33;\r<br />[img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/24439-4-1348250805.png[/img]",
