  "summary": "Revamps the look of most marriageable male NPCs.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Bethesda clearly has a sense of humour. If you compare the available spouse options for the straight male Dragonborn to the spouse options for the straight female Dragonborn, it seems to me that the level of ugliness achieved by the latter can&#39;t be anything but deliberate. Furthermore, most of the selection comprises drunks/gamblers/dirt-covered miners/criminals and even a beggar. My my, who do I choose?? \r<br />\r<br />Skyrim is definitely a land where the maxim &#39;all the good men are taken&#39; rings true - but no more&#33; \r<br />\r<br />This mod revamps the faces of most male marriage options in accordance with my own personal taste and I offer it up for anyone who is interested. The full list of men altered is as follows:\r<br />\r<br />Ainethach\r<br />Angrenor Once-Honored\r<br />Argis the Bulwark*\r<br />Athis*\r<br />Balimund\r<br />Belrand\r<br />Benor\r<br />Calder\r<br />Filnjar\r<br />Ghorbash the Iron Hand\r<br />Octieve San\r<br />Omluag\r<br />Onmund*\r<br />Pavo Attius\r<br />Perth\r<br />Quintus Navale\r<br />Revyn Sadri\r<br />Roggi Knot-Beard*\r<br />Romlyn Dreth\r<br />Torvar\r<br />Wilhelm\r<br />\r<br />*Asterisks indicate men who have only been tweaked very slightly.\r<br />\r<br />In each case I&#39;ve not strayed far from their original face since my aim wasn&#39;t to create sexy men everywhere you look but rather to make the worst offenders a bit easier on the eyes. Blacksmiths still have soot on their faces (albeit not quite as much), old people are still old (but a little more groomed) and random facial dirt has mostly been removed or toned down. Poor Pavo Attius had so much black dirt on him it was like he was in blackface :(\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />If you already have mods that tweak individuals in the list above, load the mod with the look you prefer lower down in the plugin list.\r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods:\r<br />Xenius Character Enhancement - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2356/?\r<br />Straight Hair Retexture - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4333/?\r<br />\r<br />Right now I don&#39;t intend to revamp any ladies since the sight of them doesn&#39;t offend me quite so much and there are already so many mods that tweak the female NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;",
