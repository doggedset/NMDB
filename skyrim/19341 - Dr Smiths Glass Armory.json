  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i1165.photobucket.com/albums/q596/andersonsmith969/logo-1.png[/img]\r\nVersion 2.0\r\n\r\n2.0 Update: Added Lite armors, which have lighter armor and duller glass, and new color Fire Orange, renamed original orange to Pumpkin Orange.\r\n\r\nI liked Devalinor\\'s glass armor and weapon replacers, but they were not actually high-res like they claimed, just resized to a larger resolution, and they had some graphical issues, so I decided to make my own version of cool glass textures based off of the high-res DLC since it\\'s fun to unnecessarily mod everything.\r\n\r\nHence Dr. Smith\\'s Armory is born, a texture replacer pack for both glass weapons and armor (including shields). There are both light and dark armor versions to choose from. I\\'m sure many of you will have differing opinions, so if you don\\'t like it, then don\\'t use it.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- 13 colors to choose from, both dark and light, including a Daedric style, for those of you who wear light armor but still want to look badass\r\n- Textures based off of the High-Res DLC, not Vanilla\r\n- Ingot and ore texture replacers to aid in believability\r\n\r\nFuture plans: Someday I may get the glow to work, but for now it looks like I\\'ll need modeling to do that, and I do not have the skills. Sorry!\r\n\r\nEnjoy the mod!\r\n\r\n- Dr. Smith",
