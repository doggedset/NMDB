  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a merchant to the Frozen Hearth in Winterhold that sells inkwells and rolls of paper. This is mainly to be used with PerMa so the player has a way to stock up on scroll making supplies.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod and even though it is incredibly simple I had not found another mod that solved my problem and figured other people might be in the same boat as myself.\r<br />\r<br />All you should have to do to install is extract the .esp to your data folder and activate it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I want to thank T3ndo and all the people that worked/work on PerMa and PaMa, as well as TheThirdRace for his mod publishing tutorial.",
