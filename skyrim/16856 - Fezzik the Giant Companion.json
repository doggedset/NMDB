  "descriptionHtml": "This is a tribute to the late wrestler and actor André the Giant who played Fezzik the lovable giant in the movie \\\"The Princess Bride\\\". I have him sandboxed in the Silverblood Inn in Markarth. He is a huge man and his combat skills and perks are geared towards War Hammers and Mauls. He is really fun to watch as he beats the snot out of people. You wont miss him when you walk into the bar! lol\r\n\r\nI will say that I did the best I could to try and make him look like Andre. No modders have done any curly male hairs that I could find so he is not going to be a perfect likeness by any stretch of the word.  \r\n\r\nNot much needed in the way of mods for Fezzik, he is wearing a Vanilla Miners Outfit and is armed with an Iron Warhammer. He is a Level 35 Calculated 2 Hand Boss\r\n\r\nI did this one just for fun, he is a drastic departure from my usual mods but I think he is a character that is absolutely worth having in the game. :) \r\n\r\nThe Great Maul shown in a couple of the screenies is from Bob\\'s Armory! http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12060",
