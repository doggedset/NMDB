  "summary": "i always e encounter problems when mining. Even after 60 days in game the ore veins are not re spawning , ",
  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;m still having problem using English as my language so  please ignore the wrong spellings and grammar. I change d the way how mining works by making all the veins infinite, changing the time u need to spend mining to get ores now you have to hit the ore veins 45 times to get the ores, i did this to avoid other players to get a huge amount of ores at a very quick time and destroying the game ,i also change the weight of all ores to 5. i only changed the effect  of the ores inside the mines, dungeons and caves and alos the ore veins outside are not affected  i also added a support for the dragonborn dlc its with the main files. if you dont have the dragoborn dlc simply delete the btterminingdragonborn.spe.. if you have complains or if you like the game please post a comment to this file or endorese it if you like it  .  i just want a feeed back to my first mod  ",
