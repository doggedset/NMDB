  "descriptionHtml": "''A man shot me through the heart...then I woke up. Thought it was kinda strange. But then it never stopped. Fell off a cliff, trampled by horses...poison, starvation...a stray javelin. In the end, I got the message. I'm the man who can never die...'' \r\n\r\nA sequel of sorts to ''Bad Wolf,'' This mod adds small chunks of wood called torch wood to loot throughout Skyrim. Yo can smelt those pieces of wood into coal and make torches out of them at a Tanning Rack.\r\n\r\nThat's it. \r\n\r\nOr, you could take the coal and cook it with some salt to make powdered torch coal. Combine that with some ale and some honey, and you have the Torchwood Elixir, which will heal you for 150 points and make you immortal for a few seconds by making your health 5000% faster. \r\n\r\nAll that from a chunk of wood. \r\n",
