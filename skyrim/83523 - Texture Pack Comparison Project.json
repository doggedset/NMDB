  "summary": "An ambitious project to compare texture by texture every single competent texture mod for every single texture in Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#6aa84f][size=6][b]Texture Pack Comparison (TPC)[/b][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />This is a project designed to help users decide which textures/texture packs to use. It can be used to assemble a mod pack that covers all textures. To do this I took thousands and thousands of comparison pictures. The goal is to cover all textures that have been retextured by a half-competent and lore-friendly mod, although exceptions exist at my discretion. The target resolution is 2k and up with exceptions. Balancing resolution and art style is difficult and inherently subjective. I do not use an ENB and I do not sugercoat the textures. For each texture there will usually be a picture with the texture changed to the normal map (to highlight where in the  picture the texture is used), a close-up picture (to evaluate fidelity), and a normal picture (to show art style). City overhaul mods are generally ignored since the goal is to compare textures.\n<br />\n<br />[center][/center]The point of this project is to show people which texture packs look better in a very fine grain way. This is a large project for people who are serious about their textures. From this project there is enough data to assemble your own custom texture pack made from your own personal favorite textures from many, many mods. It's very common for mods to skip multiple textures they were supposed to cover. With these archives you get comparisons at a level beyond which any video can offer.\n<br />\n<br />If you would like to help, please notify me of any texture packs I may have missed or would probably miss. Also, there are some textures I could not find in the game world so if you know where it's found that is always helpful. Please do not expect frequent releases. This project is very mind-numbing work and I have to take breaks to prevent myself from getting burnt out.\n<br />[center]\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=4]Progress:[/size]\n<br />As of 8/2/2018 the project currently has 17,787 pictures lined up (although some are not released yet).\n<br />Project Status: In Active Development\n<br />ETA Next Update: Mid 2019\n<br />[/color]\n<br />_BYOH..........[color=#6aa84f]DONE[/color]\n<br />Actors............[color=#6aa84f]DONE[/color]*\n<br />Architecture....[color=#6aa84f]DONE[/color]\n<br />Armor...........[color=#6aa84f]DONE[/color]\n<br />Blood............[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Clothes..........[color=#6aa84f]DONE[/color]\n<br />Clutter.........[color=#ffff00]Started[/color]\n<br />Critters.........[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Cubemaps......[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />DLC01..........[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />DLC02..........[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Dungeons.......[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Effects..........[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Furniture.......[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />ImpactDecals..[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Interface.......[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Landscape.....[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Plants...........[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Puddle.........[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Shadertests....[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Sky..............[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Trap............[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED\n<br />[/color]Water..........[color=#ff0000]NOT STARTED[/color]\n<br />Weapons.......[color=#ffff00]Started[/color]\n<br />*Some folders are not fully complete.
