  "summary": "This fixes many of the interiors to allow SSAO effect to work when using an ENB.\r\n\r\nCreated New Page for updated ENB setting.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Note: After looking around I think this might just be a problem with ATI users.  To test, go to Solitude Blue Palace and turn SSAO on and off and see if there is a change in the shadows.\r\n\r\nThis changes a setting for many interior spaces that was preventing the ENB effect SSAO to work.  Once you notice that it isn\\'t working, you can\\'t un-see it.  It took a little bit of testing to figure out what was causing the problem but I found it and had to change it.\r\n\r\nThere are many interiors that have been edited.  I\\'m not going to list them.\r\n\r\nOnly use it if you are using and ENB with SSAO, otherwise it\\'s pointless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can test to see if you need the mod.\r\n\r\nGo to Solitude Blue Palace, \r\n1. hit the ~ key for console command (it\\'s the key to the left of 1 on your keyboard)\r\n2. type COC Solitudebluepalace\r\n3, type ts, which means \\\"toggle sky\\\". See if this changes your shadows.  \r\nThis is basically what my mod does. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you install the files but don\\'t notice a difference you may need to do this:\r\n\r\n1. Using NMM, export your load order.\r\n\r\n2. Then unclick everything and only activate your top ESM\\'s and my ESP\\'s.\r\n\r\n3. See if that does anything in-game. If not, then you are not having the same issue. If so then, you are...\r\n\r\n4. Then import your load order again and try it.\r\n\r\nI don\\'t know why this worked for me, but it did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt doesn\\'t conflict with other lighting mods that I know of.  If you have any concerns about conflicts put these ESP\\'s last in your load order.  There are only ESP files in the mod, no other files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several fixes for DLC\\'s, Moonpath, and Falskaar.  Only activate the one\\'s you have in your game.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ESP\\'s are pretty self explanatory in their naming.  I\\'m sure you can figure it out.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Created New Page for updated ENB setting.\r\nI\\'ve also included my personal ENB setting.  They are edits of files from various other authors made for realism and the best ENB effects with maintaining the best performance possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\nYou can use these files however you like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nYada Yada Yada...\r\n\r\nBoris\r\nBethesda\r\nOther great modders, too many to name",
