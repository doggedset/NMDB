  "descriptionHtml": "8/19/12 LSBRuneWeapons by Lord Banewrath Sunblade\r\n\r\n\r\n       This mod adds 7 new weapons to the steel crafting list. Mostly just hammers that\r\nhave a one handed and two handed version and a spiked mace that is has two versions.\r\n I decided not to add them to lvld list because these will be included in my battlehammer\r\nmod update and that mod adds items to the lists.But since that update will won`t be ready \r\nfor awhile I thought I would release these and see how people like them in the meantime.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Installation is as easy as always, drag and drop the contents of the supplied data folder\r\nto your own data folder. When launching the game click the esp on and play.",
