  "summary": "My first upload ever&#33; Not really a mod but a illustrative guide to some of Skyrim&#39;s popular pose animations.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Please forgive me. English is not my native language.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m a huge fan of pose animations which are very useful for screenshots. Unfortunately, over the years there have been thousands of pose animations that have become available for use but without the corresponding guide. This guide is an attempt at providing convenience with a useful illustration of how a particular pose would look like rather than going to the tedious process of going thru each one of the available poses which could number in the thousands.\r<br />\r<br />There are several pose mods available in the net but my favorite is one done by Halofarm. But there are thousands of Halo&#39;s poses that I could only make a few at one go. I intend to cover all of his pose sets eventually.\r<br />\r<br />This guide starts with Halofarm&#39;s latest post release starting from Halo Poser 8, 7, 6 & 5. In subsequent uploads I will be working my way back. Another reason for uploading in installments is to save space. Uploading the guide containing all the released poses by Halofarm could easily reach 500 mb or more which would take too long to download.\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS:\r<br />\r<br />I would like to thank Bananbro for making me use his excellent armor mods - Angel Vixen armor and Dark Vixen (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58646/?) and the Skimpy Assassin&#39;s Outfit (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61858/?)Â  which I am using extensively in this work.",
