This is my first mod and my first building on that game. I decided to build a big house with a lots of bed, a seller, crafting items and everything needed to improve my game experience. There is even a misc seller if you need to sell your useless stuff.\r\n\r\nYou can find the building in Whiterun near the entrance (at the right).\r\n\r\nThe design is kinda Nordic and very cozy and pleasant to live in. \r\n[s]There is a Bard named Greta but she doesn\\'t sing yet, I will try to fix this asap. [/s]\r\nI removed the Bard, I will try to make him/her work after christmas.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.2 : I added a new brighter version of the house for those who have really dark presets, I hope it will be bright enough for you. Juste ask if it\\'s still not enough. The slave will now never counter attack you but will flee inside her cage. She will never go out of her cage (at least not on her will, if you push her it\\'s a different problem...)\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\nInstall the mod with NMM, no extension needed, or extract the content of the .rar file into your Skyrim\\'s Data folder (and don\\'t forget to activate it with your launcher).\r\n\r\n[b]Review[/b] :\r\n[center][youtube]EdpDq4gn5n8[/youtube][/center]\r\n[center]Thank you [url=www.youtube.com/user/MrBiggenGaming]MrBiggenGaming[/url] ![/center]\r\n\r\nPS : sorry for my english, i\\'m French\r\n",
