  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/23872-1-1347386154.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nI always enjoyed the Elite Archer armor set by Locaster, However it only came out in 1 color: Red, Lately the owner has uploaded a black rexeture, But for those hunters out there like e, Red and Black don\\'t really fit in our style, That\\'s why I made this Retexure, It\\'s brown. Like Leather. It doesn\\'t come with any new models though, only new Textures to fit in with the Hunter-theme.\r\n\r\nI\\'m aiming for making every color, But red and Black, Those are already made by the original author! you can ost a comment on what color I should do next. Although they all will be there!\r\n\r\n[10-9-12\r\nAwnsered some community comments and added more pictures. I\\'ll make a non-dragoin logo version soon! Although it might turn out horrible!\r\n\r\nIt\\'s my first mod. Positive comments are welcome, As well as negative ones, Although I prefer the good ones!\r\n\r\nNOTE: My Skyrim is not even starting up due my crappy computer and my ton of mods! If anyone could test this armor out and maybe upload a few pictures, it will be very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nCheck out my newest White retexture! http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24722/\r\n\r\nOriginal Armor: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22870\r\n\r\nCredit to Locaster!",
