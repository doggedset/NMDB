I have HEAVILY enchanted equipment as well. My original intent was for an assassin type character but since all stats are maxed and all perks are unlocked, you can play as her however you wish. The outfit I\\'m wearing in the screenshots is the Triss Dark Brotherhood armor replacer. Actually it\\'s from the stand alone .esp and I\\'m wearing the \\\"Wonderous Armor\\\" I crafted so I could enchant it. My weapons are an enchanted Daedric bow and an enchanted Daedric Katana. There are also other mods I used that I will list now.\r\n\r\nBeautiful Hair Retexture by Bloodysunday: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5152 (Wooly style)\r\n\r\nDetailed Faces v2 by Xenius: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=26&navtag=file/images.php?id=26&tab=3\r\n\r\nColorful Dragons 3 HD by Luddemann: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3740\r\n\r\nNo Helmet Mod by vuradic: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=562\r\n\r\nPretty Eyes by pikkatze: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3424\r\n\r\nTriss Armor Retextured by Psyke23: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4708\r\n\r\nWeapons of the Third Era by 747823: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3871\r\n\r\nTytanis - The Ultimate Mod - Crafts - Spells - Items - MORE by Tytanis: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1601\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nAll that\\'s really required is the hair pack and eye pack.
