  "descriptionHtml": "This is a texture swap mod for the male hands.  It will improve the following.\r\n\r\n-Finger nails have been redone to add detail\r\n-Fixes the elongated finger nails that were on some of the fingers\r\n-Adds more detail to nail bed in normal map to match new nails\r\n-Higher resolution with small amount of cleanup (will do more here soon)\r\n-Adds nail detail to specular of finger nails\r\n\r\nI personally thought the hands looked kind of funny.  I play in fov 85, so the finger nails were always present and looked kind of off place.  This mod will fix this and also add more detail to the nails.  This mod is a variation on some files from my other mod....\r\n\r\nPlease check out that Link Zelda mod here\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2588\r\n\r\nPlease contact me before using this or any of my files in another mod.\r\n\r\nCredit goes to Bathesda\r\n",
