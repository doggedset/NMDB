  "descriptionHtml": "[[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/51469]There will be no SE port of this mod. Read here for more information[/url]]\n<br />\n<br />When joining the Legion and getting your set of Imperial Legion armor from Beirand, he will now also provide a set of Imperial weapons. It doesn't matter whether you pick Light, Medium or Heavy armor.\n<br />\n<br />1 Imperial Sword\n<br />1 Steel Greatsword\n<br />1 Steel Dagger\n<br />1 Imperial Bow\n<br />48 Steel Arrows\n<br />\n<br />When choosing the heavy armor, you receive the standard helmet and also an Imperial Heavy (Full), which covers the face. This helmet is fairly rare (only appears in two places, as far as I know), so I've added this in case you want to wear that instead.\n<br />\n<br />An Imperial Officers Helmet and a steel ingot has been added to the map table in the Imperial Eastmarch Camp (see screenshot). You will be a Legate when sent to this camp, so now you can dress the part. I tried to make it so Tullius would give you this helmet upon promotion, but couldn't figure out how to do that.\n<br />\n<br />A version of this for Stormcloak players is now available: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28646]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28646[/url]\n<br />\n<br />*New in 1.1*\n<br />* As an unintended consequence of me being a noob and editing the wrong list, the weapon package was appearing on most Imperial soldiers. It wasn't a huge deal, but it certainly made the escape from Helgen more difficult if leaving with Ralof. That shouldn't happen now and only *you* will receive these extra items.\n<br />\n<br />* In addition to the weapons from v1.0, you now also receive a steel greatsword for you 2-handed warriors and, if choosing the heavy armor set, two different helmets. \n<br />\n<br />* An Imperial Officers Helmet and steel ingot has been placed on the map table for you at the Eastmarch Imperial Camp.",
