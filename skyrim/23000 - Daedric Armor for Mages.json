You can find it under \\\"Daedric\\\" in smithing, requires 1 Daedric Heart to craft. This is meant for mages that want the look of Daedric Armor while still getting the benefits of Alteration or without the need to level up smithing.\r\n\r\nIt is really small, only took maybe 15 minutes to make. I doubt it conflicts with any mods so you should be fine there.\r\n\r\nThis mod DOES NOT alter the original daedric armor in any way shape or form, you can still get the normal daedric armor in the normal way.",
