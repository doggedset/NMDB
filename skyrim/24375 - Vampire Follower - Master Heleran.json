  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a dark elf vampire follower to Whiterun, can be found next to the guy shouting about Talos sitting down. \r\n\r\nMaster Heleran uses vampiric drain, lightning bolt and other spells I forgot about but yeah,\r\ncompatible with UFO and other things like that.\r\n\r\n- Level 25 (Level doesn\\'t increase, so he\\'s OP for low levels and good for people who are high as 24\r\n- A cross between a nightblade and a spellsword, so pretty much Spellblade.\r\n- Is non-essential/killable\r\n- Doesn\\'t provoke or steal, because he\\'s the last of the noble Heleran family of Morrowind\r\n- Lore friendly and it\\'s a work in progress.\r\n- Occasionally uses a frost storm staff as well as a spell or weapon \r\nCan\\'t steal this and if you did you\\'d look pathetic because this is pretty basic.",
