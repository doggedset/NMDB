  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=limegreen][i]Remember to Endorse if you like this mod[/i][/color][/b]\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism is both welcome and encouraged, if you have any ideas on how to better improve the balance this mod, leave a comment.\r\n\r\n[b][size=4]=Description=[/size][/b]\r\nThis mod strives to improve the usefulness of foods in Skyrim, providing a feasible alternative to potions and restoration magic. I won\\'t bore you with a comparison between my changes and the default Skyrim\\'s food, just know that the next time you see that sweetroll laying helplessly on a lonely tavern\\'s dusty table, you may actually be tempted to steal it.\r\n\r\nThis mod makes no real attempt to be \\'realistic\\', instead the goal is to be \\'useful\\'.\r\n\r\nMeats will favor health restoration.\r\nVegetables will favor stamina restoration.\r\nFruits and sweets will favor magic restoration.\r\n\r\nThis doesn\\'t necessarily mean that one category of food will always, and only provide that type of restoration, but it is helpful to think of it as a general guideline when searching for the foods that meet your needs.\r\n\r\nYou will find that the effectiveness of each individual food is spread over a long duration; usually between 10 and 120 seconds. Some foods have additional bonuses that lasts between 1 and 30 minutes. Cooked foods are more beneficial to the player, as they are most likely to have the strongest secondary bonuses. Unlike potions and spells, food is best eaten before or after a battle.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Milk, no beverages have been altered...\r\nSee screenshots for examples.\r\n\r\n[b]=Known Issues=[/b]\r\nNone thus far.\r\n\r\n[b]=Compatibility=[/b]\r\nThis mod is not compatible with mods that make similar changes to foods in skyrim. Whether or not this applies to survival mods depends on how that mod\\'s features were implemented. So long as your survival/realism mod does not depend on changes made to the effects applied by consuming foods, it will work fine if this mod is placed after said mod in the load order.\r\n\r\n[b]=Installation=[/b]\r\nInstall with NMM\r\nor\r\nDrop the Esp files into your skyrim dictionary.\r\n\r\nEach ESP file will work independently in any order you choose. This means you can, if you so choose, install the Dragonborn or HearthFires optional files without any need of the Skyrim main file. Do not use the Another Food Mod -All_In_One file if you do not have both HearthFires and Dragonborn DLC installed. Do not use the All_In_One file in combination with any of the other files provided by this mod.\r\n",
