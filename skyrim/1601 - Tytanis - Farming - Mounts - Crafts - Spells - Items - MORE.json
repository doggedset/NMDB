DO NOT REPORT IT IF YOU LOAD FROM A SAVE FROM 1.01\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nV1.01\r\n\r\nSkyrim Farming + Horse Armor Vendor + Fixes\r\n\r\n\r\nFarming\r\n-----------\r\nNote: You can TURN ON the effect (beam) when a plant is ready (default is off)\r\n\r\nTo turn it on, type in console - \\\"set ShowPlantReady 1\\\"\r\n\r\nTo turn it back off - \\\"set ShowPlantReady 0\\\"\r\n\r\nFind seeds by finding \\\"Flowering\\\" plants in the world. (Random chance at getting seeds)\r\n\r\nTo plant - Hit the \\\"Fertilized Soil\\\" with your hoe. Only seeds you have will show in your inventory. \r\n\r\nPlants grow in REAL-TIME. I may add a variable to speed them up as a cheat, but for now, eal with it =P\r\n\r\nYou can craft a Hoe at the forge for 1 iron ingot and 3 firewood.\r\n--------\r\n\r\nHorse Armor Vendor\r\n-----------\r\nBig thanks to both tumbajumba and Mystikhybrid for the models.\r\n\r\nHorse vendor\\'s name is Skulvik, located at the Whiterun Stables.\r\nArmor will be applied to the last horse you rode.

All dragons are affected!)\r\n\r\nArrow Criticals\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFire Arrows - Fire arrows will burn the target, a critical hit will produce Midas\\' Meteor Shower on the target.\r\nFrost Arrows - Frost arrows will apply frost damage, a critical hit will produce Midas\\' Avalanche on the target.\r\nShock Arrows - Shock arrows will apply shock damage, a critical hit will produce Wall of Shock on the target.\r\nEarth Arrows - Earth arrows have three criticals, 1.

I didn\\'t include dragons yet because it\\'s currently corrupting saves, but I\\'ll get on it once I wake up (I\\'m very, very tired right now). I also need to update the mounting animation...and if your bear or sabrecat are laying down, you can mount them but you won\\'t be able to go anywhere. Just punch them in the face and when they get up, jump on!\r\n\r\nhelp \\\"tamed\\\" 0\r\nplayer.placeatme <code> - Tamed Mount\r\n\r\n\r\nNew items: Blank Power Tome, Dragon Brain, Runic Nightingale Sword, Gold Ebony Cuirass, Gold Ebony Gauntlets, Gold Ebony Boots, Gold Ebony Helmet, Ancient Argonian Scratches, Ancient Dark Elven Text, Ancient Wood Elven Text, Redguard Secret Handbook, Secret Imperial Knowledge, Ancient Altmer Text, Ancient Aldmeri-Nedic Manmer Text, Ancient Orsimer Glyphs, Karliah\\'s Secret, Mysterious Khajiit Notes,\r\nHoly Dust, Dragon Blood, Dragon Skull, Dragon Eye, Dragon Meat, Dragon Saliva, Dragon Heart, Coffee Bean, Brewed Coffee, Titanium Ore, Titanium Ingot, Platinum Ore, Platinum Ingot, Titanium Dust, Diamond Dust, Emerald Dust, Ruby Dust, Sapphire Dust, Amethyst Dust, Garnet Dust, Fire Stone, Frost Stone, Thunder Stone, Personal Grindestone, Silver Setting, Gold Setting, Platinum Setting, Jeweler\\'s Kit, Meteorite, Meteorite Dust, Mammoth Furs, Mammoth Wool, Spider Silk, Silk Thread, Silver Thread, Gold Thread, Rune Thread, Glass Thread, Ebony Thread, Dwarven Thread, Elven Thread, Quicksilver Thread, Dragon Thread, Thunder Salts, Blank Spell Tome, Enchanted Paper, Enchanted Quill, Enchanted Leather, Enchanted Ink, Arrow Tips/Nocks, Chunk of <mineral>, Leather Scraps\r\n\r\nNew mini-artifact weapons with enchanted FX! You can find these in certain locations (secret, no spoilers please). There are two of each enchanted swords spread out across the land in select chests that have a 10% chance for each mini-artifact to show up:\r\nNew weapons: Tamriel\\'s Storm, Dragon\\'s Breath, Glacial Tide, Terra Nova, Imperial Spear, Imperial Pike and Bear Trap\r\nWhen you have any two of the swords listed above, you can combine them to make artifact greatswords, dual wielding too!\r\nTamriel\\'s Storm + Dragon\\'s Breath would create the greatsword Firestorm.\r\nGlacial Tide + Dragon\\'s Breath = Terra Nova.\r\nAnd so on (yes, they can even be combined with the same element)! Users may post what the rest of the recipes and names are but NOT where they are located. Still working on the greatswords and other forms of artifacts (axes, maces, daggers, etc)\r\n(I will also be creating universal enchantment effects if desired)\r\nFor the Bear Trap, you may only set ONE...so only craft ONE. I did this to prevent it from being over-powered.\r\n\r\nWarmaster\\'s (All Weapons here (Iron Battleaxe, Steel Warhammer, Dwarven Greatsword, etc etc) When you dual-wield two-handers with Warmaster weapons, you are pointed to the one-handed tree!

You may hold a Greatsword with another Greatsword together or mix it up! You can also just hold one two-hander and use the other hand freely.\r\nNote: You must craft \\\"Warmaster\\'s\\\" weapons at the forge to dual-wield.\r\n\r\nSCAVENGER HUNT!
