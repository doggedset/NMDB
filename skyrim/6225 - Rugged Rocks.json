  "descriptionHtml": "Replaces the two rock face textures in the game with rugged looking, more crevassed variants.\r\n\r\nThe long and overly contextual version: I\\'ve never modded an Elder Scrolls game before, so I figured I\\'d start with the most minimal thing I could think of to get my feet wet. I replaced the two textures most of the rocks in the game use with my own, more rugged looking, slight variants, just by layering in some of my existing stock images to Bethesda\\'s texture. I rather liked the way it turned out, considering the minimal effort, so I figured why not upload it.\r\n\r\nCiao!\r\n_six",
