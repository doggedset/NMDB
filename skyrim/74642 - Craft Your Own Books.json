  "descriptionHtml": "[u][b][size=5][center]Craft Your Own Books:[/center][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u][left][u]\r<br />What this mod does:[/u][/left]It allows you to unlock and craft your own books at a new crafting station. There are currently 81 different books to craft. The main purpose of this mod is giving you an extra income by crafting and selling books. Some books are more rewarding then others.  \r<br />Crafting books will increase your speechcraft skill.\r<br />\r<br />[u]What this mod doesent do:\r<br />[/u]You cant actually write books. The pages are blank but you cant write anything on them, I dont have the skills to make a mod like this.\r<br />\r<br />[u]\r<br />How it works:[/u]\r<br />By completing a quest, collecting an item etc. you unlock a new recipe. For example: If you complete the quest for Azura you unlock the book &#34;Daedric Artifacts: Azuras Star&#34;. Now you can craft said book and sell it or put it in your bookshelf, its like a trophy system.\r<br />\r<br />[u]\r<br />How to craft books:[/u]\r<br />There is currently one crafting station located in Dragonsreach in Whiterun near the enchanting table (it looks like a regular table). \r<br />If you want your own crafting station for your home etc. I suggest you to use &#34;Jaxons Positioner&#34; mod. I am working on a portable crafting station.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The books are blank because I am not a good writer and my English is not so good. :D But if someone is interested in writing small stories, you are welcome to bring words to the empty pages. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Requires Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLC&#33;",
