  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i57.tinypic.com/2ujtbah.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />*Updated Less Exposure Preset and added a new DPX Preset*\r<br />\r<br />In these desperate times it is vital for ones games to look simply amazing. Nothing goes further than realistic graphics and a cannon story line. But, it seems Bethesda left out one important detail when creating this masterpiece. SweetFX... Just SweetFX. Not only do the images above speak for themselves but they offer up stunning visuals with absolutely no FPS drop. All those crazy ENB&#39;s out there... well... they make this preset look like shit but what I went for was a &#34;playable&#34; game rather that a Skyrim/ Minecraft adventure.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i61.tinypic.com/acd3b5.jpg[/img]\r<br />Now isn&#39;t that just the prettiest thing you ever did see?\r<br />\r<br />This preset is to easy to install too&#33; Let me lay it out for you who don&#39;t know:\r<br />\r<br />1) Download this preset\r<br />\r<br />2) Download SweetFX\r<br />\r<br />3) Download SweetFX Configurator\r<br />\r<br />4) Open that shit up and add Skyrim to the games list. While we&#39;re here we can add that preset you downloaded in step 1\r<br />\r<br />5) Load up the preset and click launch game or in the event you use NMM use that instead cause it&#39;s way more swanky\r<br />\r<br />6) Attempt to not loose your shit over how good (or bad) this preset is. I mean come on... really, that&#39;s not possible without space tech n&#39; stuff.\r<br />\r<br />Note: These images were taken at 2560x1440 down sampling resolution with no AA or anisotropic filtering or SMAA.\r<br />Mods that help this preset look like the pictures are:\r<br />Climates of Tamriel\r<br />Realistic Lighting Overhaul\r<br />Dynavision\r<br />\r<br />These mods together give SweetFX users the ability to manage lighting, depth of field and indoor, outdoor and cave lighting attributes.\r<br />If anyone wants my preconfig to test on your device let me know I&#39;ll send you everything I have including Skyrim.ini and SkyrimPrefs.ini. If you also need help with downsampeling resolutions I can create a small tutorial on how to do so to save you more VRAM.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Anyway you look at it, this looks 500 times better than that dingy mess that is better known as.... Vanilla. Leaves a dirty taste in your mouth too.\r<br />All of this is here for you to enjoy provided you know how to use SweetFX and the Configurator. It&#39;s to easy. So easy it should be illegal.\r<br />\r<br />Let me know what you guys (and gals) think about this work of art. Is it worth your time or is it a waste of 15 min you can never get back (no refunds&#33;)\r<br />Post your thoughts in the discussion board and if anyone out there can make it better or knows how to do magic on it, well, be my guest. I&#39;d love to see it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Now Go&#33;.... Go forth and Skyrim&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />Maybe your&#39;s truly,\r<br />MinorDiasaster23[/center]",
