  "descriptionHtml": "Black Book: Beyond the Abyss\r<br />\r<br />[b]A Seeker has escaped Apocrypha, taking a Black Book with him. Find him on Solstheim and defeat him to gain access to forbidden knowledge. [/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Dragonborn DLC REQUIRED\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]What this mod does.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a Lost Seeker somewhere on Solstheim, for you to find him. He carries a Black Book which will teach you the Conjure Lurker spell. This spell will summon a Lurker Vindicator for you for 60 seconds. \r<br />\r<br />Lurker Vindicators are level 54 and got nearly 1800 health, this is vanilla by the way. Some people might find that overpowered, but i got good news for ye, you can&#39;t just go to Solstheim and kill the Seeker and go bonkers with the spell afterwards. You&#39;ll have to earn yourself some conjuration levels first. Go there on a low level and the Seeker will blast you to bits.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This spell needs the Twin Souls perk in the Conjuration tree to be cast, casting it without having the perk will result in nothing&#33; Even then you can have only ONE lurker at your side.  Base Magicka Cost is 3000, that&#39;s more than twice the cost Fire Storm has.\r<br />\r<br />Alternatively there&#39;s an .esp for people who prefer it easier, without the perk requirement to cast the spell. The Seeker will still blast you into pieces if your level is insufficient.\r<br />\r<br />[b]SPOILERS AT THE END FOR PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T WANT TO SEARCH[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Complications & Incompatibilities [/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod should be compatible with everything, no vanilla asset is changed at all, even the twin souls perk, the spell merely has a reference to check if the player has the perk or not, if your twin souls perk is modded, that doesn&#39;t matter as the ID is the same.\r<br />\r<br />The Lurker is very huge in size and is best used outdoors or at places with enough room to let him get angry at your foes. Once again, this is vanilla size.\r<br />\r<br />The Seeker respawns for minor reasons, i.e. you nuking him with some post-nuclear spell to the red mountain and can&#39;t reach his corpse.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits[/b]\r<br />Bethesda for making the game we all love - Skyrim\r<br />Morodiilunahzaal - Whipping the spell together\r<br />Hermaeus Mora - For having tentacles and lurkers.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]LOCATION SPOILER[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Horker Island[/u]",
