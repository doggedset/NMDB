  "summary": "Adds weapon racks, plaques, mannequins, and bookshelves into a single cell for easy extraction.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I got sick of pulling all of the different markers and activators for bookshelves, mannequins, plaques, and weapon racks from the bethesda made player homes so I added them all to a single cell. I also adjusted all of them off of the 90 and -90 degree z axis. This will prevent weapons floating and the such.\r\n\r\nThis should also help modders keep slightly cleaner esp files as you do not have to view the cells of other locations as much and lessen the risk of accidentally modifying something, resulting in a possible overwrite of other mods.\r\n\r\nFigured I\\'d share it with the community. All you need to do is have it checked while you are working on your esp. Make sure YOUR esp file is the active file, not this one. It just needs to have the box checked next to it.\r\n\r\nCell is ElD_Activators\r\n\r\nHope it saves a few modders time. ",
