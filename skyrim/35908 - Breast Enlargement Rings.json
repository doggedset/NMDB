  "descriptionHtml": "#Update# - 1.2\r<br />Can now change Ring percentages in the Creation Kit, rather than scripts.\r<br />\r<br />To do this:\r<br />- Open br_enl.bsp in the Creaiton Kit. Find a Global named enl_ring1. This will have a fraction of 0.2, being 20% size increase. Change it to the size increase you want.\r<br />- Open the Excel spreadsheet named &#34;pulse_mod_calc.xls&#34; deposited in the Data folder. Plug the new percentage in there. Adjust the pulse_mod value until it matches (explained more in the spreadsheet). You don&#39;t care what the value is, so long as it matches for your respective Size Increase.\r<br />- Go back to the CK, find the Global named enl_ring1p, enter the pulse_mod value in there. Save.\r<br />\r<br />Note - pulse_mod is a cheap fudge value to allow a Cosine function to smooth in and out the enlargement as it starts/stops. Papyrus doesn&#39;t support calculus, thank sheogorath.\r<br />\r<br />#Update# - 1.1\r<br />Added npc &#34;thankyou&#34; to pulse ring\r<br />Fixed a flat-breast problem when unequipping pulse ring\r<br />Fixed a problem with wrong size when using reset ring and scaled skeleton\r<br />\r<br />I was going to call this mod &#34;BreastKrieg&#34; and make up a story, and put the rings on top of a mountain, mostly as a tongue in cheek reference to how lore-abiding this mod isn&#39;t. But then I couldn&#39;t be bothered.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />There are 10 rings, 5 will increase the breast size in increments of: 20%, 40%, 80%, 100%, 150% (150 is a lot, unless your body mesh is tiny, this will create udders). Trouble-shooting information is now listed further down, as there are a number of mods this relies on, and a few it can conflict with.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />There are 5 rings that do the same, except in a pulse effect, so breasts will expand out and in. This uses a Sine function in order to smooth in the start/stop for the expansion.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Other effects:\r<br />- If sitting, the ring wearer will look at their breasts when they start expanding and exclaim something from the vanilla dialogue (eg. &#34;Something&#39;s happening&#34;  &#34;What magic is this?&#34;).\r<br />- If standing, the wearer will thank you.\r<br />- There is a reset ring, in case you go ring crazy and make things go all Akira.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]==== How to Use ====[/u]\r<br />A box of rings is held in the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun (next to the cupboard). Otherwise find them using the console (~ help enl)\r<br />Equip the rings either by;\r<br />- Using Additem &lt;Ref&gt;, Equipitem &lt;Ref&gt; in the console\r<br />- Using the follower trade. If using this you will need to unequip/re-equip one item on the NPC in order to trigger the script.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]==== Requirements ====[/u]\r<br />You must have:\r<br />- SKSE\r<br />- a BBP or TBBP skeleton (XPMS and CHSBHC skeletons have been tested, other ones not so much)\r<br />- a BBP or TBBP mesh, ie either a naked body which supports BBP, or a clothing/armor which supports it.\r<br />\r<br />The vanilla skyrim clothes will not show this effect. Any downloaded clothes will not show this effect unless they support BBP.\r<br />\r<br />[u]==== Incompatibilities ====[/u]\r<br />Currently the mod will probably conflict with the Breast-resize options in:\r<br />Enhanced Character Edit\r<br />RaceMenu\r<br />\r<br />Any other functions from those mods should be ok.\r<br />\r<br />[u]==== FAQ ====[/u]\r<br />a) Why it not work? - Check the latest version of SKSE is installed, BBP or TBBP are working, and that you&#39;re using a BBP/TBP compatible body mesh (no vanilla clothes/bodies).\r<br />\r<br />b) How many rings can I disperse to NPCs? - maximum of 30 rings at the moment (can be of any type, eg 10 Type 1, 20 Type 2)\r<br />\r<br />c) Can I hack apart your scripts? - Yes, source is included, it&#39;s not the prettiest as some of the stuff to implement the Sine functions became messy and I&#39;m not really happy with.\r<br />\r<br />d) Which direction will the breasts expand in? - This really depends on the body mesh and skeleton, stock CBBE has a tendency to go downwards. The CB++ body I&#39;m using has a pushup effect, so boobs go outwards.\r<br />\r<br />[u]==== Troubleshooting ====[/u]\r<br />Please try this list if no animations occur.\r<br />\r<br />1) Can you not find the rings in the temple, or via &#34;help enl&#34; on the console? Please try reinstalling the mod via NMM. Check the br_enl.bsa file is in the Data folder and enabled in NMM.\r<br />\r<br />2) Are there rings, but no animation, and more importantly, no speech? Try re-loading the mod, check the BSA file is in the Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />3) Is there Speech but no BBP/TBBP Animations work at all (ie not this mod or any others)? Check that the skeleton is correctly installed, and that you&#39;re using a Body which supports BBP/TBBP.\r<br />\r<br />4) Is there Speech, and other BBP/TBBP Animations work, but no enlargement animation occurs? Check that the latest version of SKSE is installed correctly. The debug BSA file available will call out the SKSE version if you really want to know, put this into Data replacing the br_enl.bsa already in there. Also, double-check that you&#39;re not applying the ring to a non-BBP body mesh&#33;\r<br />\r<br />5) Animation occurs, but there are flat breasts, strange expansions etc? Please post a comment letting me know the following:\r<br />-Skeleton used (if Skulltyrant, which of the 400 ones there)\r<br />-If using RaceMenu/ECE, I think this might work with those mods, but haven&#39;t found out yet.\r<br />-Body mesh used, and how it was generated, ie Nexus download? Bodyslide? CB++?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]==== Future ====[/u]\r<br />I&#39;m uncertain what else to do with this. I&#39;d contemplated;\r<br />a) Some kind of &#34;breast holding&#34; idle during the expansion process, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be anything stock which comes close.\r<br />b) A more rapid expansion process, maybe which throws milk out. I might look at this for a later version.",
