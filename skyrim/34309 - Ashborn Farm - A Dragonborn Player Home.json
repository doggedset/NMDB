  "summary": "Adds a small player home to the ash wastelands of Solsthiem.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This modification adds a small player home to the ash wastelands of Solsthiem. The house is located South-East of Kolbjorn Barrow, and just up the hill from Hrodulf\\'s House. On first arrival at the house, three Ash Spawn will be waiting to ambush you. Upon closer inspection, you\\'ll see that they\\'ve just killed a contracted Thieves Guild member. Loot his body for a key to Ashborn Farm.\r\n\r\nAround the side of the house is a small fenced off patch of land that is growing various plants and other flora from across Solsthiem. These ingredients can be harvested, and grow back in a few days. At the back of the farm lies a smithing area, complete with a forge, sharpening wheel, a workbench, a tanning rack, and a smelter. There is also a small paddock for a horse next to the smithing area.\r\n\r\nThe house is comprised of four main rooms: the cooking/dining room, the landing, the basement, and the bedroom. The cooking/dining room has a large fire with a cooking spit, a small amount of storage, a dining area, and suitable decor. The landing has a few clutter items, and is used for storage in the house. The basement has an alchemy lab, an enchanting table, a desk, and a few bookcases. The bedroom contains a lavish bed, plenty of secure storage facilities, and decor items.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this mod. If you do, remember to endorse and give feedback.\r\n\r\nAttention: In the latest version, 2, a small change has been made that fixes the door to Glover Mallory\\'s house in Raven Rock, which was changed by the previous version of the mod. Also, the house is now fully Navmeshed and has a room for followers to stay, down in the basement. Please download version 2.",
