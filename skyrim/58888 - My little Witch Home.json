  "descriptionHtml": "this little mod is a remake of what might be my favorite house mod that I ever made for my self for skyrim.\r<br />its small but cozy and has all of my characters needs and also is more fitting to my theme. I know in our world witches live in pretty places but in elder scrolls that&#39;s not the case. its more like fairy tale witches or so I believe and so I always make my witch houses for elder scroll games like such.\r<br />\r<br />the house is up top of winterhold collage, as why wouldn&#39;t it be? if you&#39;re a spell caster of any type and can make portals why wouldn&#39;t you make one that opens up there? anyway the house has a kitchen with a cooking pot and oven, also a library with an alchemy workbench and an enchanting workbench. there is a bedroom with a staff enchanter, and a lot of storage containers all around but none look out of place. the house has a lot of animation makers, and a lot of cool things around and about to give it a haunted or enchanted feel to it. all it needs is a witch player to own it and a pet black cat.\r<br />I did want to post this mod up last Halloween for you guys but I didn&#39;t have dragonborn dlc at that time now I do and it made the house look a lot better from my point of view. anyway hope you like and happy Halloween.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />(the optional update places a cabin for the house in the world space, because a few people wanted it. it has a map marker and fast travel point. the location is in the swamp of Morthal. if you download the optional file it will no longer have a portal to the mage collage. btw you need the main file to use the optional update because it has all the meshes and textures.) \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />you can also get this in with a french translation by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/2235573-oaristys/][color=#ffffff]Oaristys[/color][/url] here\r<br /> http://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/skyrim/mods/bordeciel/habitations/maison_de_sorciere\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />oaristys - Modders Resource Pack\r<br />runspect - Resources for modders\r<br />Blary - Alchemy Clutter Resource\r<br />Blary - BookSets Resource\r<br />badgremlin - BadGremlins Witches Festival Resources\r<br />they are all resources so that should be no problem and i don&#39;t think I&#39;ve used anything from any other mods besides those, other clutter and such should be from the game it self unless im mistaken.",
