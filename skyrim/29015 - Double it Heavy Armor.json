Requires Dawnguard and latest patch.\r\n\r\nYou know how heavy armor is suppose to give more protection than light armor, well it didn\\'t feel that way. If you take into account that 12 armor gives 1% protection, there really wasn\\'t much difference between the two except that light armor gave you more utility.\r\n\r\nNow you can put it on even in early levels and feel somewhat protected. Of course enemies benefit from this too.",
