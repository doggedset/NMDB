  "descriptionHtml": "This is a new texture for the female jester outfit. It is a hybrid created from comic and concept art. *update* Now optional male outfit too. These files with OVERRIDE the vanilla jester/Cicero clothing.\r\n\r\nEdit: The white collar glows in the sun and I\\'m sick of looking at this texture so for now, it will stay that way. I have darkened the collar to grey but it still glows in DIRECT light.\r\n\r\nIf it is requested, I can take off the collar as an option. I\\'ve been working on this re-texture for a long time and it isn\\'t perfect, but it\\'s good enough to not drive me crazy :)\r\n\r\n*UPDATE*\r\nThere are currently 2 files for download. \r\n\r\nHarley Quinn 2 - This is the updated HQ as seen in new screenshots. This file comes with darkened gloves and boots. NO HAT. \r\n\r\nHarley Quinn 2 with darker Cicero - This is the updated HQ as seen in new screenshots AND the male version. This file comes with male jester retexture, gloves, boots, and hat.\r\n\r\nRegarding the hat: The hat file is used for both male and female. If I made the hat black and red to match the female I\\'d have to redo the male version too, and I have no interest in that. I have simply darkened the hat to match the male version, and I find it does not clash too much with the female version. I\\'m sorry for any inconvenience, but I don\\'t wear the hat in my game so I only see it on Cicero.\r\n\r\nRegarding the boots/gloves: They are simply darker. I left the gold. I happen to like the gold contrast and I do not feel it clashes with my Harley Quinn hybrid.\r\n\r\nRegarding the colors: I understand that some people may feel the red for example is too bright. I have included different screenshots to show how the red appears in different settings. The original HQ outfit was only pictured in the Temple of Kynareth - the brightest place I could find - to show the detail. That is not how it looks all the time.\r\n\r\nRequests are fine, if you would like different colors or something feel free to ask. \r\nFeel free to modify it for your own game but don\\'t upload Frankenstein-ed versions on my work :P",
