  "summary": "This mod is a WIC. My purpose is to bring weapons for the common class and then replace all the vanilla weapons for low level bandits with these weapons. First weapon added is the Sledge Hammer.",
  "descriptionHtml": "In medieval times, not eveyone had a sword. Actually, if you had one that meant you had a title. In Skyrim everyone has at least an iron sword, war axe or mace. The goal for this mod is to replace all the weapons for the low leveled bandits. Holy crap&#33; someone is charging with a spiked club on his hands. Have you shat your pants yet?\r<br />\r<br />Weapons list:\r<br />[color=#ff0000]\r<br />Iron Sledgehammer (2H): [/color]Can be crafted (2 firewood, 2 iron ingot), not tempered. Weight of 30. Extremely high damage rate but also extremely slow to swing.\r<br />[color=#ff0000]\r<br />Steel Sledgehammer(2H): [/color]Can be crafted (2 firewood, 2 steel ingot), not tempered. Same damage rate than the iron one but weights only 20lbs (or whatever is the scale used in Skyrim.) and it&#39;s also faster to swing than the iron one.\r<br />[color=#ff0000]\r<br />Log Hammer (1H): [/color]Craftable (1 firewood + 2 leather strips). Slower than a normal mace and does same damage as the iron mace but with better crit damage (x5) due to its weight (20).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Spiked Club (1H):[/color] Craftable only (2 firewood and 3 iron ingots). Heavier and slower than the iron mace (20) and has same damage but has better crit (x6).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Steel Spiked Club (1H): [/color]Craftable (2 firewood, 3 steel ingot and 3 leather strips). A bit less damage than the steel mace but it&#39;s lighter.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Iron Spiked Club (1H):[/color] Craftable (1 firewood, 2 iron ingot). Slightly more weight but has better crit than the iron mace. Both have same damage.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Log hammer (2H): [/color]Craftable (3 firewood, 5 leather strips). Less damage and crit than the iron warhammer but weight less and thus it&#39;s faster to swing.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Iron Truncheon (1H):[/color] Craftable (1 firewood, 3 iron ingot). A bit better damage than the iron mace but weights more and thusit&#39;s slower.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Steel Truncheon:[/color] Craftwable (1 wooden stick, 3 ingot steel, 3 leather steel). \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Wooden Stick (1H):[/color] Craftable (1 firewood). The stick everyone has used once in a lifetime. Required to build other clubs or maces based weapons. Low damage but weights less and you can swing pretty quickly with it. Count as a mace.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Nailed Club:[/color] (1 wooden stick, 1 ingot iron): Bit better damage and crit than the woodstick.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Spiked Wooden Club (1H):[/color] A bit better damage than the nailed club, fue to its thicker nails/spikes.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Half Nailed Club:[/color] A wooden stick with just half face filled with nails.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Steel mace Single head:[/color] Just one small steel head.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Steel mace single disk:[/color] A disk of steel in the head.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Iron great quarterstaff:[/color] A 2h kanabo weapon. Heavy but potent.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Steel morningstar:[/color] A classic. Wooden handler.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Iron mace single head:[/color] One portion of iron metal as a head.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Iron mace triple head:[/color] Triple head made of iron.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Iron long mace:[/color] Iron kanabo 1h.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Spiked wooden mace:[/color] a deformed 4 face spiked iron mace with a wooden handler.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Steel morning start full metal:[/color] A bit more damage and heavier and slower to swing morning star. Has better stagger rate.\r<br />[color=#ff0000]\r<br />Steel morning start full metal alt1:[/color] Slightly different model of the full metal morningstar.\r<br />[color=#ff0000]\r<br />Steel morningstar full metal alt 2:[/color] Slightly different model of the full metal morningstar.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Why can these be crafted but not tempered? because you can&#39;t improve them further to deal more damage, if you need more get an actual iron \r<br />or steel warhammer instead you commoner&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Issues:\r<br />\r<br />I tried. God knows i tried, but i was unable to add actual custom collission meshes, for two reasons:\r<br />- The tools used to add them are strangely outdated or\r<br />- There are no updated tutorials showing how to do it due to the use of newer tools centered for Fallout 4.\r<br />\r<br />So i used the iron warhammer collision data. Until someone better than me models the damn thing i&#39;ll be using my Sledge hammers as they are. If you don&#39;t mind to see weird collision stuff, feel free to use this mod.\r<br />\r<br />To do list:\r<br />- All clubs from basic to elaborated.\r<br />- All missing 2H and 1H versions.\r<br />- Rustic shields\r<br />\r<br />Tools used:\r<br />3DSMax\r<br />Niftools\r<br />Crazybump\r<br />Photoshop\r<br />Creation kit",
