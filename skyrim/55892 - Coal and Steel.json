  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/yTt8Il0.png[/IMG][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds coal as a mine-able resource to all mining nodes.  You can then take that coal to a smelter with an Iron ore and make Steel.  \r<br />\r<br />-There are some mods that allow you to make Steel using charcoal and making  charcoal from a piece of firewood.  I find it a bit too easy. This will allow you a chance to get the materials for coal to make Steel.  \r<br />\r<br />-Why should you use this mod? Since Steel is such low quality compared to orichalcum or ebony.\r<br />As a modder, I see a lot of mods which add new weapons to the &#34;Steel&#34; crafting section.  And some of those weapons are pretty potent.  This just adds a little more immersion.\r<br />\r<br />-Corundum, realistically corundum doesn&#39;t exist like it does in Tamriel.  It&#39;s more of an Aluminum crystal sort of speak.\r<br />\r<br />This is a beta, I can&#39;t 100% confirm that the coal can be found on all Mining Nodes, I will say it is 100% on nodes that produce Gems.  So if it gives a gem it gives coal.\r<br />\r<br />Know any other uses for Coal?\r<br />\r<br />I am curious what else I can make coal a use for in Skyrim besides coking steel.  Let me know in the comments and I will consider your suggestion.",
