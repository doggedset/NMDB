  "descriptionHtml": "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nGame: Skyrim\r\nMod Name: Forever Forsworn\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nVersion: 2.0\r\nOlder Versions are Obsolete (and broken)\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nAuthor(s): SkyrimSweetheart\r\nPlease contact me on SkyrimNexus\r\n\r\nMod Type: In-game Console BATCH FILES\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nUPDATE HISTORY\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\nCurrently a modular set of Roleplay, Choice Friendly, BATCH Files for immersion in any roleplaying campaign as a Forsworn PC. The extent of the immersion depends on your preference of roleplay, and the mods that you do or do not have installed that support forsworn immersion at any possible level. I prefer full immersion.\r\n\r\nI have made this as user optional as possible, please let me know if it needs farther separations, where, and what your suggestions are. I would love to hear them.\r\n\r\nDepending on how you roleplay, and the mods you choose, this could break quests. These files, in themselves should not. Please use at your own risk!. (Please read the LAUNCH  section in the Recommendations PDF Guide if you use Sanguine\\'s Debauchery.)\r\n\r\nRoleplay Immersion Choices\r\n\r\n1. To be, or not to be, forsworn?\r\n\r\n2. A PC crafted Subfaction\r\n     - Archer\r\n     - Pillager\r\n     - Ravager\r\n     - Shaman (Female is recommended for Lore Immersion)\r\n     - Looter\r\n     - User Custom Created\r\n\r\n3. Appropriate Tribal Gear that matches the choice in number 2\r\n     - No Gear (skip this section)\r\n     - Archer\r\n     - Pillager\r\n     - Ravager\r\n     - Shaman (Female is recommended for Lore Immersion)\r\n     - Looter\r\n     - User Custom Created\r\n\r\n4.  Bounty Level\r\n     - None (skip this section)\r\n     - Standard\r\n     - User Custom Choice\r\n\r\n5. Allies and Enemies\r\n     - No Adjustment (skip this section)\r\n     - Adjust Allies\r\n     - Adjust Enemies\r\n     - Adjust Allies and Enemies\r\n     - User Defined Custom Factions\r\n\r\nPDF USER MANUAL\r\nThere is an 8 page PDF manual with this to make your choices easier. The manual contains an easy reference chart for printing or copying by hand. \r\n\r\nNOTICE: The Manual has a misprint relating to Group 5. Allies and Enemies. It only reads to select one of the allies and enemies. You would have to select the Allies and the Enemies (run two bat commands) to modify both. They are kept separate. Sorry for the misprint in the manual.\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY\r\n\r\nThis is VANILLA BASED so NO DLC should be required to use it, and ANY DLC is okay to be used with it. No Mods are required to use this, though anything that sets up Forsworn to work properly (on the player side) is suggested. Recommendations are included.\r\n\r\nINCLUDES\r\n14 Standard Files\r\n4 User Customization Files\r\n14 Source Code TXT Files\r\nForever Forsworn PDF User Manual\r\nRecommendations PDF Guide\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES:\r\nAs far as I can tell, so far there is one issue that may or may not present itself. Depending on the mods installed, the skill attributes settings may or may not \\\"stick\\\". The ones that are higher like the 25  should not be an issue. The issue is the lower skills seem to jump to much higher whenever certain game activities train them. This is not a perfect solution for set skills, so mods that support it are definitely recommended. \r\n",
