The purpose is to provide individual standalone patches for all of the official DLC as well as all of the popular conflicting mods (and, for that, there are many).   \r\n\r\n[b][color=silver][size=3]What:[/size][/color][/b] compatibility patches and combined [i][b]\"DLC versions\"[/b][/i] for A.O.S. \r\n\r\n[b][color=silver][size=3]Why:[/size][/color][/b] to achieve maximum compatibility between AOS, Official DLC, the Unofficial Patch project, and other third-party mods \r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=blue][size=4][u]Installation: [/u][/size][/color][/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Read the \"Download and Installation Protocol\" above!!!\r\n[*]Install the .esp file to [size=2][i]SteamSteamAppscommonSkyrimData[/i][/size] -- Then activate the plugin using your mod manager or skyrim launcher \r\n[*]Most of my mod packages are structured so that your mod manager (NMM, MO, WB) should be able to recognize and install the ESP without any other re-packaging\r\n[size=2](the exception to this is any package that has more than one version of the patch, to accommodate for different DLC)[/size]\r\nThe good news is that these are only patches, meaning there is only one file.. the ESP file.  Simply copy/drag-drop/install the single file into [size=2][i]SteamSteamAppscommonSkyrimData[/i][/size]\r\n[/list]\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \r\n[b][color=blue][size=4][u]Author's Note:[/u][/size][/color][/b] \r\n\r\nI am a busy person so don't expect a miracle. I will accept requests for patches to popular mods, and then, when i have time, i will download that mod (if i dont already have it myself) and make the patch for it. Please be patient with me, especially when it comes to updating these files each time LordKorn comes out with a new revision of the main mod. If he releases an update, expect that it will take [b][i]at least[/i][/b] 6 hours for me to realize the mod has been updated, download the update, open it up and find the changes, compare them to the patches, make any necessary changes, then upload my new version. That being said, if you notice that AOS has been updated, it doesnt hurt to send me a message and let me know in case i havent realized it yet. Thanks for your patience and understanding. \r\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",
