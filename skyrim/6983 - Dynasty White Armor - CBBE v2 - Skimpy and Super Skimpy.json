  "descriptionHtml": "Dynasty White Armor for CBBE v2.\r\n\r\n\r\n***UPDATED with revealing bewbs of each curiass version\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a retexture of the Dynasty Armor. The original port from codecrackerx9 and the CBBE mesh from drakishar with my own texture. This mod comes in the following styles:\r\n\r\nSkimpy Regular (skimpy top only).\r\nSkimpy with black undies.\r\nSkimpy with white undies.\r\nSuper skimpy with.... you guessed it, no undies.\r\nEach of the above versions has a revealing bewb version.\r\nOriginal drakishar version retextured.\r\nOriginal codecrackerx9 chainmail version (this is the ported mesh so is a lot different from the others but I wanted to keep it in this set) retextured.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nAll versions are standalone and are available for crafting, buying at Bethlor\\'s shop in Whiterun, or obtaining with the console.\r\nAll versions are upgradable and have no enchantments by default.\r\nStats are based on either the Dragonscale or Dragonplate armor (not been able to work it out from the original .esp).\r\nRetextured the gloves with chainmesh and fixed parts where the skin was showing through. The gloves mesh is a little ropey and doesn\\'t quite fit the fingers properly; I can\\'t edit the meshes (yet) and it could so with some love.\r\nThe black/white undies are simply completely white or black but do look kinda cool in the right light with the light reflections.\r\n\r\nCraft at a forge (under dragon); leather strips, dragon scale and dragon bone.\r\nObtain via console. Type \\'player.additem xxxxxxxx 1\\' where xxxxxxxx is the id below.\r\nThe XX at the start is the loading order of the mod. If you don\\'t know the loading order start at 01 and work up until the item is added. Note the loading order is base 16 (hex) so goes in this order: 00-09 0a-0f 10-19 1a-1f and so on.\r\n\r\nXX0087A0 - original CBBE v2 curiass\r\nXX0087A1 - Boots\r\nXX0087A2 - Gauntlets\r\nXX0087A3 - Original ported chainmail curiass\r\nXX0087A4 - Super Skimpy\r\nXX0087A5 - Skinpy orig undies\r\nXX0087A6 - Skimpy white undies\r\nXX0087A7 - Skimpy black undies\r\nIn Ver 1.2:\r\nXX0087A8 - Super Skimpy with revealing bewbs\r\nXX0087A9 - Skinpy orig undies with revealing bewbs\r\nXX0087AA - Skimpy white undies with revealing bewbs\r\nXX0087AB - Skimpy black undies with revealing bewbs\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nDrop the textures and meshes folders over your existing textures and meshes folder. Place the .esp in the \\\\data folder.\r\nThe esp is a modified version of codecrackerx9\\'s/drakishar\\'s esp so should over write theirs with no issues. The modified esp contains additions only so should not cause any issues, though please report if it does.\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\nRemove the .esp file\r\nRemove the \\'Dynasty\\' folder from \\\\meshes\\\\armor\\\\\r\nRemove the \\'Dynasty\\' folder from \\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\\r\n\r\nChange Log:\r\n1.0 - Initial release.\r\n1.1 - Fixed bug where \\'black undies\\' version armor (only) would change to a less skimpy version with weight slider maxed. Thanks SuicideDream for spotting this!\r\n1.2 - Added revealing bewb versions of the 4 skimpy curiass.\r\n\r\nCredits and big thanks to:\r\ncodecrackerx9 for the original port to skyrim and the original .esp - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5733\r\ndrakishar for modding and making a fine CBBE v2 mesh - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6166\r\nken1945 for the original work, which none of these Dynasty mods would have been possible without - http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39413\r\nApogee777, see below.\r\nOther credits to kit rae, twenkle, durotar (I assume from the original TES4 mod)\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\nMy textures - Do what the hell you want with them, I don\\'t require crediting, but it would be nice.\r\nThe mesh from drakishar - use as you see fit. See his perms here: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6166 (It\\'s also nice to credit him too)\r\nCredit codecrackerx9 for the port and original .esp (http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5733).\r\nCredit ken1945 for the original work along with kit rae, twenkle, durotar.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral waffle:\r\nThis is my thrid mod so far which I\\'m pretty pleased with. The changes from drakishar\\'s mod are kinda subtle but offer a skimpy version of this armor to go in line with some of the other skimpy armors on the nexus (if you like that kinda thing, which I do). I would have upped this a few days ago but I had some wierd lighting issue on the parts where I have applied alpha. I do have to say thanks to Apogee777 as it was from pulling one of his mods to bits that I discovered the fix for the lighting issue.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in the parts of my character:\r\nCBBE v2 Body - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\nSkeuomorph skin (black) - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4254\r\nFace - Better Females by Bella - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\nDetailed Lips - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=689\r\nNo More Blocky Faces - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=30\r\nEyes - My own pink texture.\r\nHair - From some Chinese site. I don\\'t speak Chinese and didn\\'t understand a word on the website, so I can\\'t vouch for its permissions etc. Because of that and in line with the nexus rules, I won\\'t post a link to it. Don\\'t ask, your request will be simply ignored. Google is your friend.",
