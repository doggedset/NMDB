  "descriptionHtml": "I have played many characters who walk into Windhelm for the first time and see Rolff Stone Fist, belittling and harassing a dark elf. \r\n\r\nYou draw your sword in honor? Well, it wont do anything, as he is set to essential and cannot die.\r\n\r\nGive yourself the satisfaction of ending the misery of this racist man. \r\n\r\nThis Mod simply makes him non-essential.\r\n\r\nA quick warning. Everything in this game has consequences. I\\'m quite sure he was set to essential because he can potentially be used for a Radiant Quest, I\\'ve never had an instance of it, but I\\'m sure there are others who have, so this would conflict with that.
