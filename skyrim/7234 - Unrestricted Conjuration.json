  "descriptionHtml": "[About]\r<br />I found myself disliking that I could only summon two things at a time, when in Morrowind I could have 50 flame atronachs destroying a city with me. So after tweaking the &#34;Twin Souls&#34; perk I gave myself the ability to summon as many as I&#39;d need. I have it set to 30, which should be plenty, as more might hurt performance. I also modified the &#34;Dead Thrall&#34; spell to animate more than just human NPC&#39;s, check out my video below to see the mod in action.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]2wyjmx0M_Is[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[NOTE]\r<br />The screenshot shows the modified Dead Thrall spell as costing 0 magicka. I used my other mod (God Maker) on this character. So assuming you did not modify your game stats it will cost the normal amount.\r<br />\r<br />player.dispelallspells - this is a console command to release the thralls who can&#39;t find their way home :( In case anyone needs it.",
