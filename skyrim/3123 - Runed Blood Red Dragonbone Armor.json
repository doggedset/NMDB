  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is a texture repaint of the dragonbone armor. \r\n\r\nWhat\\'s Changed:\r\nI darkened the steel and brought out the highlights. \r\nThe bone sections have been recolored to be blood red. \r\nI have added runes from the dragon poem, directly off of the elderscrolls wiki. \r\n\r\nThe runes are located on the shoulders, chest and back of the male version and on the shoulders only of the female version. \r\n\r\nObjective:\r\nDragonbone armor is the most unique heavy armor in the game and is only worn by the player and their followers. This mod makes the player stand out more in a heroic and iconic way, less like a primitive scavenger and more like a fierce sorceror, or bloodthirsty berserker - a true hero of Skyrim! \r\n\r\n**Using this texture repaint will change every character using dragonbone armor in your game.**\r\n\r\nIncluded:\r\nDragonbone Cuirass \r\nDragonbone Helm\r\nDragonbone Boots\r\nDragonbone Gloves\r\nDragonbone Shield\r\n\r\n**Good for male and female characters.**\r\n\r\nI created this armor recolor to teach myself how to do it, this was my first mod. (Be gentle!)\r\n\r\nI don\\'t plan on supporting this mod. \r\n\r\nTo Install:\r\n1. Copy the \\\"textures\\\" folder to the Data folder in your skyrim directory. \r\n\tSTEAM USERS: ...\\\\STEAM\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\tThis could also be under your username, depending on the install path you selected. \r\n2. Launch Skyrim, and enjoy! All of the characters using the Dragonbone armor will show the new textures.\r\n\r\nUninstall (without uninstalling your other mods):\r\n1. Close Skyrim\r\n2. Navigate to ..\\\\STEAM\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\\r\n3. Delete the \\\"dragonbone\\\" folder\r\n",
