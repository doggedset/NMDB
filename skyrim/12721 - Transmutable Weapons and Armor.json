  "descriptionHtml": "Did you ever have an awesome weapon or armor but feel the appearance of it didn\\'t fit your character? Or the only reason you are using the current weapon or armor is because it\\'s the best one you can get stats wise?\r\n\r\nWhat this mod does is basically allows you, through crafting, turn that ugly Daedric weapon or armor and into a weapon like a steel sword or steal plate, all while keeping the stats of the Daedric\\'s original item.\r\n\r\nThe finished mod will allow you to change the appearance of all vanilla weapons and armor.\r\nI also plan on making this compatible with other 3rd party mods like \\\"JaySuS Swords\\\".\r\n\r\n---Usage---\r\nAll the weapons and armor available can be crafted and tempered.\r\n**YOU MUST READ THIS 1ST** \r\nBecause I don\\'t like a cluttered crafting menu the items won\\'t be visible until you have the requirements\r\n*Required Materials*\r\n-The non enchanted version of the (Vanilla)weapon or armor you want the stats from.\r\n-The original materials used to craft the weapon or armor you want it to look like\r\n-A filled soul gem based on the difference of quality of the 2 Items.\r\n(For example: making a Daedric dagger look like an Iron dagger you will need a Grand Soul, while making it look like a ebony would be a Petty Soul.)\r\n \r\n",
