  "descriptionHtml": "===============WARNING================\r<br />The previous (release 1.0) version of this mod WAS NOT CLEAN. While it won&#39;t destroy your game, it did have a lot of unnecesary data. I HIGHLY recommend updating as soon as possible. While it shouldn&#39;t be mess with anything you have in the home from the previous version IT IS STILL EXTREMELY ADVISED TO START FROM A CLEAN SAVE.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/0miNNTC.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />======================Details========================\r<br />Fort Gnisis comes with everything you&#39;d expect out of a player home:\r<br />REQUIRES DRAGONBORN\r<br />\r<br />-A plethora of Mannequins, Weapon Plaques, and Shield Plaques\r<br />-Not lacking in display cases either\r<br />-Smelter, Forge, Workbench, Grindstone, and storage for related items.\r<br />-Areas to mine some lower leveled ores.\r<br />-Wood block for wood cutting.\r<br />-A LOT of room for companions -- It&#39;s what this mod was made for.\r<br />-A handful of book cases\r<br />-A vault for all your valuables, including an open chest so you can drop your goods in and watch your fortune grow.\r<br />-Shrines to Daedric lords featured in Dragonborn\r<br />-A room for Enchanting and Alchemy, complete with cool effects to really make you feel like a wizard.\r<br />-A brand new companion&#33;\r<br />-Two new playable fire-enchanted ash spawn weapons&#33; ((will be nerfed in next update))\r<br />\r<br />For right now, you can fast travel directly to the forts entrance. It&#39;s an invisible door marker that you simply walk into like a cave (to make it seem like your character just walks there. It&#39;s supposed to be beyond Skyrims borders), Check the screenshots for details.\r<br />\r<br />========================Bugs==================================\r<br />Only one that I can think of, which may or may not be fixed in a future update. You can&#39;t fast travel, as it&#39;s in its own worldspace, and I&#39;m not sure how to &#34;connect&#34; it to Skyrim the same way the Fort Dawnguard (From the Dawnguard DLC, duh) is. If anyone knows how to do this, PLEASE send me a message.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s been awhile since the last time I uploaded a mod, and the last one I had was rather... Disappointing. So be sure to tell me if you spot any bugs&#33;\r<br />\r<br />==========================Installation=================================\r<br />To install simply drag and drop the HlaaluRetreat.esp into the Data folder which SHOULD be located in C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;data\r<br />\r<br />============================Version History===========================\r<br />1.1 -- Cleaned with Tes5Edit\r<br />1.0 -- Release\r<br />\r<br />Plans for the Future\r<br />===========================Plans for the Future========================\r<br />-Integration with the map, hopefully\r<br />-A weekly time skip when traveling to and from the fort via the mountain passes",
