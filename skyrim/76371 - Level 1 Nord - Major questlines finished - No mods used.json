I&#39;ve used speed cheat and sometimes the kill command and also god mode. I just upload this file so I can access it for mod testing without having to go through some of the major quests again but I figured someone else might have use for it so I upload it here.\r<br />\r<br /> No points have been added so the character is still level 1. The name of the character is Test and she owns one property which is the Lakeview manor. However only the small building is built so you can still customize the house to your liking. Also inside the Lakeview manor you&#39;ll find all items inside the chest (except for quests items, they are in inventory).\r<br />\r<br />For those that don&#39;t know how to change or re-customize your character: Use console command &#34; ~ &#34; key and type showracemenu\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Quests completed[/b]:\r<br />Main\r<br />Thieves Guild\r<br />Nightingale\r<br />Collage of Winterhold\r<br />Dawnguard - Dawnguard path\r<br />Dragonborn\r<br />\r<br />And for the rest check the quest menu for things I&#39;ve done and quest activated. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Install:\r<br />Put the save files into your save file folder.
