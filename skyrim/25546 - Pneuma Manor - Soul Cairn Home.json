  "descriptionHtml": "Random thought came up, why not have a house within the Soul Cairn. This mod will add Pneuma Manor, currently the only player home within the Soul Cairn. Good friend Morven will sell you this home for a sizeable bounty of Soul Husks. \n<br />\n<br />There are three levels to this home, the main level, the cellar, and the upper level. Upon entering the upper level, you notice that you are not the only ones living in the house. Meet the Necronn family, consisting of a mother, a daughter, a son, and a dog. To find out why they are in the house, and resemble most of the current Cairn residents, explore this upper level for any clues.\n<br />\n<br />The father, he left behind quite the legacy. Various books found near his desk will reveal the legacy he has left, and some for the worse. In the process of discovering the past, you will wake up the past. This past will eventually lead to new recipes, a new spell, a new enchantment, and several other followers or residents within Pneuma Manor. \n<br />\n<br />This house will serve you and your adventures in the Soul Cairn well, being the only calm place within the bleak landscape.\n<br />\n<br />What is Added:\n<br />-Three story home in the Soul Cairn, purchased via Soul Husks\n<br />-4 Mannequins, 2 Weapon Racks, 3 Weapon Display Plaques, 1 Weapon Display Case, 2 Bookshelves with 90 book capacity.\n<br />-Alchemy table, Enchanter table, Forge, Tanning Rack, Workbench, Sharpening Wheel, Smelter\n<br />-Storage in the cellar, Dresser, Safe, several Barrels near Mage Station.\n<br />-Thane, Bard, Soul family (step-daughter, step-son, dog, wife?), Assassin follower\n<br />-Soul Husk Extract recipe, Absorb health/soul trap spell, Absorb health/soul trap weapon enchantment, Absorb health/soul trap poison\n<br />-5 Books, 5 journals for backstory\n<br />-3 Quests for backstory and acquiring thane/bard/assassin, without direct quest markers.\n<br />-Spells to transport to Pneuma Manor and to College of Winterhold\n<br />\n<br />Requires: DAWNGUARD\n<br />\n<br />Revision History:\n<br />v1.2:\n<br />-Added new quest to clear up lore conflicts\n<br />-Added a new book and several supporting items for new quest.\n<br />-Corrected dog's voice.\n<br />v1.1:\n<br />-Added new book\n<br />-Added two new spells, one for transport to Pneuma Manor, one for transport to College of Winterhold\n<br />\n<br />Known Quirks:\n<br />-If you have dialogue issues, try saving-reloading in order to fix.
