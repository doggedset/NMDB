  "summary": "No more essential NPCs - all with a simple tweak. Because essential NPCs don\\'t deserve to live....",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Description:[/b]\r\nDon\\'t you just hate when you\\'re raiding a town and you come across an NPC that never dies? You attack him until he\\'s knocked down, go kill some more guards, and turn around just to see that same NPC attacking you again; very annoying. I\\'ve been using this tweak for a very long time now, I\\'m a bit surprised no one has posted it yet.\r\n\r\nThis mod will allow you to kill all essential NPCs for a much more immersive and less annoying Skyrim experience. No plugins needed. This will not make children killable (install [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13202]Non-Essential Killable Children[/url] for that).\r\n\r\nUnlike other essential NPC removing mods, this tweak is compatible with everything - DLCs, player-mods, etc., and this doesn\\'t require a plugin that further creates compatibility issues with other NPC mods.\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]:\r\nAdd the lines below to your [i]Skyrim.ini[/i] file located in [i]Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim[/i].\r\n\r\n[GamePlay]\r\nbEssentialTakeNoDamage=0\r\n\r\n[b]Conflicts / Known Issues[/b]\r\n-Incompatible with most \\\"no player death\\\" mods\r\n-Important quest NPCs can and will die with this - be sure to save often\r\n-The Dawnguard quest that involves saving the priest will not work, he dies instead of being saved - replace the 0 with a 1 during the quest\r\n-Brawling may or may not work, I have not tested it yet\r\n",
