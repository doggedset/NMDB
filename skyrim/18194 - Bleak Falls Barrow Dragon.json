Furthermore this dragon is NOT kidding around.I went there with a level 10 nord in heavy armor only to be turned to ash.\r\nThis is only a placeholder while i work at making him more evenly leveled.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\nAll I did was click on the dragon at Bleak Falls Barrow and click \\\"initialy disabled\\\" off. Not rocket science.",
