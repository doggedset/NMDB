  "descriptionHtml": "I have just had some good time to work on this and was able to update it. Khajiit players every where rejoice I deliver you Nocturnal\\'s Cowl. I was recently able to create and get the khajiit model to work. The Argonain model is still a work on progress since It is so time consuming.\r\n\r\nRemember just insert the files in your data folder in skyrim and you should be good to go. The texture for the the Cowl is thanks all to reaper9111. I owe a great load of thanks to Ghosu as well since he helped me out when I first hopped on this project. Thanks everyone for the support!!\r\n\r\nI would be in great debt to any one who would like to contact me about working on a more prestigious work on the story of the gray fox in skyrim. Since This cowl is a leg into a Quest line I had toyed with for sometime. Anyone good with the creation kit I would greatly enjoy your help.",
