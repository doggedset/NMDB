  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r\n\r\nChanges the \\\"Soul Siphon\\\" perk to refill 100% of your weapon\\'s charge on any kill.\r\n\r\nI know there\\'s another mod that does something similar to this. But the difference between my mod and the other is that the other gives you 100% of the target\\'s soul towards recharging. Meaning petty souls are still going to give very little charge. And it only works on creatures. My mod gives something along the lines of 10000% of the enemy\\'s soul and works on all enemies (except insects) so long as the actual deathblow comes from the weapon\\'s physical damage.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by that is that if you have an enchantment that does fire damage over 2 seconds, and the fire damage kills the enemy rather than the weapon/arrow itself, then it won\\'t trigger. But as far as I know, that\\'s how it\\'s always been, even in vanilla Skyrim. \r\nEither way, you should have no problem keeping a weapon charged once you have that perk, using this mod. \r\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nIf the mod seems like it isn\\'t working when killing things, try recharging your weapon with a soul gem and then try killing something again. Keeping the above (must be killed by weapon damage) in mind.\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nMy testing involved a 10 million hp giant graciously standing in place while I beat on him until all 5000 charges of Dawnbreaker were out. Once all of the charges were depleted, I killed a rabbit. BOOM! Full recharge. =D Enjoy.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve added a separate file containing different percentages for those of you who\\'d prefer a less over-powered perk.\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\n\r\nNone known. It shouldn\\'t conflict with anything that doesn\\'t alter the exact same perk in some form or another.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nOpen the compressed file and copy the .esp file into your Skyrim/Data folder. Then check the box next to the mod name in your Skyrim Launcher/Data Files, Nexus Mod Manager or whatever manager you use for your mods.",
