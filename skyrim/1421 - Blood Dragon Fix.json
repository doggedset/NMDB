  "descriptionHtml": "The Blood Dragon (or Swamp Dragon, as it is known by it\\'s texture) had an error with the alpha channel in the released version of the game, such that the webbing between it\\'s horns looked like flat triangular edges instead of ragged skin. I fixed it to be the way the artist had obviously intended it to be, and it looks much better.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS:\r\nif it\\'s not already there, create the data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\dragon folder in your Skyrim directory and copy dragon_swamp.dds into it, then play and enjoy better Blood Dragons.",
