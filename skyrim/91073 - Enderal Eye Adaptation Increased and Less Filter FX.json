  "summary": "I wasn't satisfied with the amount of \"blindness\"  in the game like in a real life sunny day or whatever. Since I couldn't find anything that increases the level and speed of eye adaptation, I made this mod.<br />It increases the strength and speed of Eye adaptation and reduces Tint effects.",
  "descriptionHtml": "*Currently replaced byÂ [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/91559]Enderal RC Tweak - Weather and Filter[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Increases the strength and speed of Eye adaptation. \n<br />Reduces the amount of the \"Tint\" effect.\n<br />As a result you may see very bright nights or interiors.\n<br />\n<br />In all scenarios tint is reduced to 0.1, brightness set to 1 and contrast to 1\n<br />- Many tint were like 0.3 or 0.8. In a dark environment like night for example not only the night was dark but also the spells in the hands were also dark, when they supposed to be even brighter than during the day, but that's way too much work for me.\n<br />\n<br />Eye adaptation\n<br />- Day light: speed changed to 80 and strength to 50\n<br />- Interiors, Dusk, Dawn, Fog and Rain: speed changed to 50 and strength to 30\n<br />- Night: speed changed to 10 and strength to 20 (have you noticed how long it takes for your eyes to focus on a dark spot in the night?) but it still feels it's not slow enough, I think even a value of 1 it's too fast for the nights.",
