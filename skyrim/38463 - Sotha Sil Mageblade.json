  "descriptionHtml": "This is an old, creation kit release era mod that has been on the Steam Workshop for a long time. I only uploaded it here because it was requested.\r\n\r\nAdds a powerful, and somewhat balanced mage\\'s weapon. Sotha Sil\\'s Mageblade is an ancient weapon that was used by Sotha Sil prior to achieving apotheosis with the Heart of Lorkhan. \r\n\r\n---------------------------- \r\n| Detailed Description | \r\n---------------------------- \r\n\r\n***************************Sotha Sil\\'s Mageblade******************************* \r\n\r\nIntended to be used by Mage builds, the dagger sacrifices the ability to dual cast for significantly increased spell power while providing the user with increased defenses. A much needed boost for mage builds. \r\n\r\nIncreases spell power by 50%. \r\n\r\nCasts a 30 magnitude ward at 74 Restoration and below, the ward increases to 60 magnitude at 75 Restoration and higher. \r\n\r\nIt can be tempered with a Refined Moonstone and is affected by Elven Smithing, however the dagger does not attack. \r\n\r\nVisually, it is a reskinned Iron Dagger. \r\n\r\n***************************Sotha Sil\\'s Spellblade******************************** \r\n\r\nA version of the Mageblade which does not cast the ward but can be used to attack. It is statistically the same as a glass dagger, but is lighter and cannot be enchanted. \r\n\r\nIt can be tempered with a Refined Moonstone and is affected by Elven Smithing. \r\n\r\n-------------------- \r\n| How to Obtain | \r\n-------------------- \r\n\r\nSotha Sil\\'s Mageblade can be found within a display case in the Archmage\\'s Quarters at the College of Winterhold. \r\n\r\nSotha Sil\\'s Spellblade can be obtained by combining a Refined Moonstone and the Sotha Sil\\'s Mageblade at a forge. It is listed under Elven Smithing but does not require it to transform. You can transform it back into the Mageblade the same way. \r\n\r\n--------------- \r\n| Other Info | \r\n--------------- \r\n\r\nDawnguard is not required. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------- \r\n| Check out my other mods | \r\n----------------------------------- \r\n\r\nColdharbour Greatsword\r\nNexus Link: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38461/?\r\nOn Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=89131581\r\n\r\nUnburied\\'s Drain Spells\r\nNexus Link: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38462/?\r\nOn Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=43131846 \r\n\r\n",
