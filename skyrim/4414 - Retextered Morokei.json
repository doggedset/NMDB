  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'ve re-textured this mask from 256px, to 1024px resolution. I\\'ve kept the original vanilla concept in mind. I choice a texture that perfectly resembled the original, minus the ugly artifacts caused by the compression. You can see the blue and green tints throughout the mask from the dds screens.\r\n\r\nIf anyone\\'s interested in a higher resolution version, drop it the comments. I\\'ll create one. Do the same, if you think something should be changed. Or you find any bugs.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it. :)\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n*For those in third person*\r\nSometimes this mask likes to disappear. This is nothing to do with the mod. This is a bug in the game. I found quick saving while in third person, and immediately reloading. Seems to fix it. It\\'s worked every time for me.\r\n\r\nI\\'d recommend  2999116\\'s retexture of the hood, in combination with this retexture\r\n[img]http://static.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/images/4414-1-1325281493.png[/img]\r\n\r\nHere\\'s the link to the file.\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4891\r\n\r\n**Installation**\r\nThis is compatible with the Mod Manager.\r\nBut manual installation is as follows.\r\n. extract the .rar file to your skyrim\\\\data folder.\r\n\r\n**For those with existing weapons packs**\r\nThis is also compatible with installed armor packs. All you have to do is say yes to override helmet_moonstone.dds\\', and it will only replace this. All the others in the installed pack will remain.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nI didn\\'t make my own texture for this.\r\nCredits go to the following, they allow use of their texture. Provided credit is given, of course.\r\nMask Stone Design : http://texturez.com/",
