  "descriptionHtml": "Changes the chances of pickpocket to emulate rolling a 20-sided die.\r<br />\r<br />It still has &#39;in-between&#39; values (eg 42%) rather than being multiples of 5, but this way you have a change of &#39;rolling 1&#39; and failing regardless of your skill (95%) or &#39;rolling 20&#39; and succeeding even if you&#39;re normally useless (min 5%).\r<br />This also means that in extreme scenarios (such as a person carrying thousands in gold) where failure ought to be guaranteed, you may be tempted to try your luck....\r<br />\r<br />Really quick edit to two Game Settings fields. Should be compatible with anything that doesn&#39;t modify iPickpocketMaxChance or iPickpocketMinChance.",
