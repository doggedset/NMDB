This will effect your FPS, just not as much as ENB.\r<br />\r<br />[/i][/u]This preset makes shadows darker, colors more vibrant, and slightly tweaks lighting. This is why it is most noticable at night or in interiors.\r<br />\r<br />I, like many others here, spend more time modding the game than playing it. Mostly I spend the \r<br />majority of my time trying to make the game as pretty as possible while \r<br />also being playable. This preset, when combined with other notable mods,\r<br /> should provide plenty of quality to the game&#39;s visuals. I managed to \r<br />run this with Hi res textures at a steady 30 fps on my \r<br />laptop. Obviously this won&#39;t compensate for the detailed shadows and \r<br />ambient occlusion of ENB, but that&#39;s the price you pay for performance \r<br />(considering those two and DOF are the most expensive processes of ENB).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />My specs:\r<br />\r<br />AMD A8-5550M APU with Radeon(tm) HD graphics 2.10 GHz\r<br />AMD Radeon HD 8550G \r<br />4GB RAM\r<br />Running Windows 8.1\r<br />\r<br />[b]INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />[/b]You will need SweetFX already installed in some compacity.\r<br />If you don&#39;t have an ENB or SweetFX already installed go here: \r<br />http://www.guru3d.com/files-get/sweetfx-shader-suite-download,1.html\r<br />Move the files into you root directory.\r<br />Simply replace the SweetFX_Settings file.\r<br />\r<br />It is also recommended that you use ENB for its speed and stability functions. Simply uncheck &#34;Use effect&#34;.\r<br />Using both should look like this in your enblocal.ini\r<br />\r<br />[PROXY]\r<br />EnableProxyLibrary=true\r<br />InitProxyFunctions=true\r<br />ProxyLibrary=d3d9_sweetfx.dllÂ  (or whatever your sweetfx .dll is called.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]DISCLAIMER:\r<br />[/b]\r<br />Results may vary. \r<br />Please be kind in your comments and I&#39;ll do my best to accomodate any requests.
