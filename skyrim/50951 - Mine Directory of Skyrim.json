  "descriptionHtml": "--\r<br />UPDATE: An optional version of the book excluding references to the game and UESPWiki has been uploaded for immersion purposes. These two versions are mutually exclusive and having both would likely cause conflict. Please choose one and enjoy.\r<br />--\r<br />Description:\r<br />This mod adds a weightless book to the game that details the 22 mines listed on the UESPWiki. It does not list all known vein locations (I may work on that separately) but rather the places categorized as &#34;mines&#34; as compiled on the UESPWiki.\r<br />\r<br />The book is located in the Embershard mine, past the bridge area and cells, on a table in the nook containing three sleeping bags. (See image)\r<br />\r<br />Alternatively, you can use the console to search &#34;help directory&#34; and with the ID number, add the item to yourself with the command &#34;player.additem [ID NUMBER] [QUANTITY]&#34; (sans brackets and quotations).\r<br />\r<br />The book is organized in alphabetical order as follows:\r<br />Bilegulch Mine\r<br />Region: Falkreath Hold\r<br />Location: South of Rorikstead, East of Lost Valley Redoubt\r<br />Ore veins: 9 Orichalcum\r<br />Features: Smelter, Forge, Workbench\r<br />Ore Vendor: None\r<br />\r<br />Cidhna Mine\r<br />Region: The Reach\r<br />Location: Markarth\r<br />Ore veins: 6 Silver\r<br />Features: Smelter\r<br />Ore Vendor: None\r<br />\r<br />etc.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />This mod is compatible with Book Covers Skyrim and Unread Books Glow. These are the only book mods I have, and so I&#39;ve not tested compatibility elsewhere. There may be issues if you have a mod that alters the interior of the Embershard mine.\r<br />\r<br />Notes:\r<br />This is my first mod. I hope someone out there finds it beneficial. If any problems arise, feel free to comment or message me and I&#39;ll do what I can to fix them (provided they&#39;re within my capabilities).\r<br />\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />You may not upload this file anywhere else.\r<br />You may not edit and/or republish this file as your own.\r<br />You may contact me if you would like to edit this file and republish with appropriate credits. (Feel free to ask as it&#39;s unlikely I&#39;ll say no, I just prefer to be consulted first.)\r<br />You may edit this file and use said edit for your personal enjoyment.",
