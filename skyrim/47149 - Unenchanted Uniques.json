  "descriptionHtml": "Tired of using armor that&#39;s pre-enchanted and doesn&#39;&#39;t fit your skills? Or do you just want to customise your assassin or thief? And you don&#39;t want to download too many mods to disenchant it and you don&#39;t want it to be craftable? This mod is your answer then&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The screenshots show a different texture but this mod does not include that, that is only my modded games. This is not a texture replacer mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=red][u][b]The Unechanted Uniques Mod[/b][/u][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange][b]=====What Does This Do?=====[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This adds in a few sets of unenchanted armor from the Nightingales, Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood for people to find and enchant. Unlike other mods that do something similar, the armor is still uncraftable and there is also only ONE set, for fairness. This is purely my personal opinion of not wanting a gazillion Thieves Guild or Dark brotherhood armors about. I&#39;ve also placed them in more &#39;end game&#39; locations so you&#39;re not running around in decent armor at Level 5.\r<br />\r<br />If you would like any more I have missed, let me know&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange][b]=====Armor Set Locations[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />* Dark Brotherhood Armor - Dawnstar Sanctuary, below bridge\r<br />* Dark Brotherhood Mage Clothing - Dawn Star Sanctuary, Master Bedroom\r<br />* Nightingale Armor -  Nightingale Hall, around the bed closest to the wall.\r<br />* Thieves Guild Alternate Armor (Linwe&#39;s, renamed) - The Ragged Flagon, in Vekel and Dirge&#39;s bedroom\r<br />Thieves Guild Armor - Thieves Guild Headquarters, in the lockpicking room \r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange][b]=====Known Issues[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />The Dark Brotherhood Gauntlets still say the back-stabbing enchantment but can still be enchanted. Not worth fixing as it&#39;s kind of awesome.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]===[b]Installation:[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Just drop the file into your data folder. Or use the NMM. \r<br />To uninstall, just remove the file. \r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Permissions and Credits[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod is not to be uploaded anywhere but the Skyrim Nexus. Please report to me if you see this anywhere else.\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating a great game and letting us fiddle with it. \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=red]Mods Shown in Screenshots[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28899/?] Nightingale Prime HD Rexture [/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/46873/? ] Thieves Guild HD Retexture [/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9752//? ] Masters of Death - Rise pf the Brotherhood [/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Thanks for reading and check my page for more mods&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7065334/?tb=mods&pUp=1 ] [img]http://i42.tinypic.com/2dryws3.png[/img][/url]",
