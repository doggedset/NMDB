  "modName": "Falkreath Cabin",
  "summary": "A small Cabin located west of Falkreath and just south of the Roadside Ruins for a nice relaxing retreat.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Just a little (previously) abandoned cabin for all you hunters out there, located in the lovely forests of Falkreath Hold. Has all the amenities needed: respawning ingredients and other resources, a small outside crafting area and an indoors enchanting table, and containers that don\\'t respawn so you can safely store your loot, and a woodchopping block with axe!\r\n\r\nI love the forests of Falkreath and felt they needed a little TLC in the form of a small, accessible player house, especially since there are no other similar mods that I\\'ve seen for Falkreath. Hope you all enjoy staying in it as much as I enjoyed making it! :)\r\n\r\n-UPDATE- I have added a new version with 3 Weapon Plaques, a Weapon Rack, and fixed the ground with a NoGrass texture! The Treasure chest inside has been changed from an Unowned chest to an actual Player House chest so grab any stashed loot before you update or you\\'ll lose it. \r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBethesda for this excellent game\r\nTheNexus for being the best modding site around\r\nYOU for your support and checkin\\' this out!\r\nsamusaran589 for their feedback! thanks!\r\n\r\nAlso check out my other mods!\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10184 Soft Leather Armor\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9784 Less Frustrating Hard Mode\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10249 Convertible Archmage Robes\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10899 Armor Padding Kits",
