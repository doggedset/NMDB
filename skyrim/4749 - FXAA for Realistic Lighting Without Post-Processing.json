  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k228/tj990/31024x57621024x576800x450.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=#FF0000][b]If you like it please endorse![/b][/color][/size]\r\nThis FXAA version has been created for the mod [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4323]Realistic Lighting Without Post-Processing[/url]\r\n\r\nThe main purpose is to enhance the mod itself using fxaa disregarding the dullness of vanilla.\r\n\r\nI specifically created this as the mod itself because the mod with vanilla didn\\'t feel complete. I wanted to enhance the stock mod as it still had that dull feel. Unlike games like stalker or oblivion this lacked clarity in image quality. While the mod itself uses darker nights, this only lowers this by a small fraction while maintaining contrast, and using a torch now seems to have purpose. This looks especially great indoors and in dungeons/caves etc.\r\n\r\nContrast,hues and saturation have been tweaked to suit. As well as this it is clearly noticible in things such as loading screens this greatly enhances just the visual quality of textures, almost providing a illusion of a retexture for most items.\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=#00FFFF][b]Using a torch now is important at night![/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[b]FPS:[/b]\r\nIt is known that FXAA slightly reduces fps, and it is strange that in some areas of the game it \r\n\r\nwill fluctuate and lose 4fps or have no loss at all.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Install:[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n1.Tick and enable FXAA in the Skyrim Options via skyrim launcher\r\n(Seems blurry in-game although with fxaa it will fix it)\r\n\r\n2.Download and install [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4323]Realistic Lighting Without Post-Processing[/url]\r\n\r\n3.Download FXAA4RL \r\n\r\n4.Place all files in Skyrim dir where TESV.exe is located (Firstly see though if you can run mod  without the .dll, then if it doesn\\'t work replace)\r\n\r\n5.Start the game and use the \\\"pause\\\" key on your keyboard to see effect\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b]\r\n\r\nIf you already have FXAA be sure to delete your previous files and put these ones in fresh.",
