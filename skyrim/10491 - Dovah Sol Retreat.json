  "descriptionHtml": "Dovah Sol Retreat\r\n\r\n[youtube]W4RfyTFbDME[/youtube]\r\n\r\n==============\r\nDescription\r\n==============\r\nThis mod adds a player home to Skyrim located north of Solitude (check screenshots).\r\n\r\n==============\r\nFeatures\r\n==============\r\n- Plenty of storage for all of your loot\r\n- Tons of display cases, shelves, weapon plaques/racks and mannequins to showcase your items\r\n- Crafting:forge, grinding stone, alchemy lab, enchanting table, tanning rack, workbench, smelter,cooking spit\r\n- Custom clutter items based on quest items/rewards that were non-droppable\r\n- All containers will not respawn and have unique IDs so they should be completely safe to store all of your loot in\r\n- One of each shrine\r\n- Custom gold clutter and tablecloth\r\n============\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nDrop the .esp and meshes folder in your Skyrim data folder and check the mod under data files.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nBugs/Known Issues\r\n=================\r\nThe mannequins can be somewhat buggy at times.  This is a vanilla problem as far as I can tell (had it happen in all of the default player homes).  If you load into the cell and notice them out of place simply reload or activate them and equip/unequip an item and they should be fixed.  Also the basement is not navmeshed for the time being so your companions may not follow you down there.  This is due to the fact that every time I navmeshed the basement the mannequins decided to go haywire for some reason.  So I am releasing the mod as-is for the time being until I find a solution to the problem.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nStill To Come\r\n==================\r\nNavmesh the basement, possibly add custom companions to occupy the bonus rooms.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nUpdates\r\n=================\r\n1.1 \r\n- Removed bugged weapon racks in basement, replaced with working plaques",
