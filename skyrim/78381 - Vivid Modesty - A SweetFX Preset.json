  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#1e84cc][size=6][b]~~INTRODUCTION~~[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]So I&#39;m playing on a low-mid range laptop, and I watch other people&#39;s Skyrim playthroughs and drool over their graphical presets. Some time ago I stumbled upon [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63839/?]I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s not an ENB 3[/url], and it had me thoroughly impressed. Over time, though, I came to resent the horrid bloom and the eye adaptation of the base game, and I wanted a bit more tame experience when it comes to SweetFX. So I decided to get my hands dirty and came up with this preset.\r<br />\r<br />What I went for was something that color-wise tried to mimic Project ENB. Whether or not I managed to do it, though, is entirely up to you, dear mod user. I hope you find this preset to your liking&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />&#33;[i] Please note that this preset uses faked HDR lighting, so it may have a bigger performance hit than other SweetFX presets. [/i]&#33;\r<br />&#33;[i] If you dislike the fuzzy feel of the image, open up SweetFX_Settings.txt and change #define USE_FILMGRAIN from 1 to 0 [/i]&#33;\r<br />[color=#e69138][size=6][b]\r<br />~~INSTALLATION~~[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />[list]\r<br />Download the .7z archive[/list]\r<br />[list]Unpack the contents to your Skyrim folder, [color=#ff0000][b][u]NOT THE DATA FOLDER[/u][/b][/color],  i.e. where you skyrim.exe file is. Usually this is C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim[/list][/size]\r<br />[color=#cc4125][size=6][b]~~ADDITIONAL MODS~~[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />While these are not MANDATORY for normal functioning of this mod, this preset was developed alongside them. They are [b]strongly[/b] suggested by yours truly. If you do not use them, your mileage WILL vary.[/size][/center][size=3]\r<br />\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />1. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13049/?]Imaginator[/url] -- An excellent mod with which you can tweak various visual aspects of your game. I use sky exposure at -4 with this, because I like to see clouds in the sky as opposed to a bright white stain.\r<br />2. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12525/?]Dynavision[/url] -- Another great mod for improved and dynamic depth of field. This might have a bigger impact on your framerate, but I do suggest trying it out nevertheless. You can easily disable it if you don&#39;t like it.\r<br />3. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17802/?]Climates of Tamriel[/url] -- A mod which massively improves the vanilla weather system. It adds tons of new weather types and I do believe it overhauls some sounds too. Very much recommended.\r<br />4. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53014/?]Dynamically Disable Eye Adaptation and Bloom[/url] -- Probably the most optional mod on this list. I resent bloom and the stupid eye adaptation, so this mod was a godsend. Do check it out if you dislike the stupidly bright bloom effect in the base game.\r<br />5. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/607/?]Skyrim HD - 2K Textures[/url] -- I personally use the Lite version, but if you can use the full version, all the better. Not directly related to the mod itself, but the game looks much cleaner and sharper with it installed.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[center][color=#6aa84f][size=6][b]~~CLOSING WORDS~~[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]That&#39;s it from me. If you have any questions, feel free to send them to me and I&#39;ll make a small FAQ section. Hope you guys enjoy this tiny addition. Cheers&#33;[/size][/center]",
