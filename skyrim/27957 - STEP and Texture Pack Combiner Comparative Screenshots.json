  "modName": "STEP and Texture Pack Combiner Comparative Screenshots",
  "summary": "A collection of comparative screenshots that were made during the process of installing the mods included in STEP\\'s graphic recommendations. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is merely a collection of comparative screenshots that I made during the process of installing the mods on STEP\\'s graphic recommendations.  I created these for my own sake, because I wanted to document the difference that all these mods were making to my game.  \r\n\r\nI took the screenshots to document the changes between different stages of the STEP install (TPC is part of STEP).  I wanted to be able to tweak and customize the textures to fit my own personal preferences and having the screenshots document the different stages helped me narrow down the specific mods that were adding the textures I liked and those few that I wanted to replace.  \r\n\r\nAgain, these are just comparison shots.  If you\\'re curious to see direct before & after shots from TPC and STEP or if you\\'re looking to pick and choose from the mods recommended by STEP, then you might find these screenshots helpful.  Otherwise, they probably have no particular use to you.   \r\n  \r\nNo lighting mods or ENBs were used in these screenshots.  \r\n\r\nGenerally, there are between 20-40 comparisons in each folder.  Each comparison typically includes 3-4 screenshots.  These are all individual images (not compilations like the images in the mod description).  I find having the separate images makes comparisons much easier, since you can flip back and forth between two images to highlight the differences between them.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the following sites for more information on the mods used:\r\n[size=2][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11]STEP[/url] \r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20801]Texture Pack Combiner[/url][/size]\r\nI highly recommend STEP for anyone looking for mod recommendations.  It been a few months since I re-installed Skyrim using STEP\\'s guidelines, and I\\'ve been impressed with the overall improvement to the game.\r\n\r\n============\r\nIMAGE KEY\r\n============\r\nThese are listed in order of increasing progression through the STEP installation process.  This means that each progressive version also includes the mods present in the previous one, but with the addition of further mods (some of which are overwriting the previous textures).  For example, the final version includes the TPC required & optional mods in addition to the rest of the graphic mods recommended by STEP.\r\n\r\nBethHR = Official HR Texture Pack + Hi-Res DLC Optimized version (Hybrid+NMs). I used the STEP recommendations for 1GB VRAM\r\n\r\nTPC_BASE = Texture Pack Combiner (Version 1.71) with only the 3 Required Packs, no optional files\r\n\r\nTPC_OPT = Texture Pack Combiner (Version 1.71) with all optional texture mods EXCEPT: Detailed Chests, Radiant&Unique Potions, and Realistic Intruments\r\n\r\nTPC+STEP = includes all STEP (Version 2.2) recommended graphics, conflicting and non-conflicting, with the exception of those listed in the readme.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in taking screenshots to compare their own game (mods, enb settings, etc) with these, I do still have all the saves that I used to create these shots that I\\'d be happy to make available on request. \r\n\r\n\r\n============\r\nCREDITS\r\n============\r\n\r\nA huge [i]THANK YOU[/i] to all the mod authors who have given their time and energy to create these amazing mods that improve the experience of playing Skyrim, and to the creators of STEP and the Texture Pack Combiner for creating these incredibly handy resources.\r\n\r\nI am not associated with STEP or Texture Pack Combiner, and all credit for those mods, as well as the many mods that they include, go to the individual authors. The accumulated amount of work that has been put into creating these mods is overwhelming.  More than anything, I think these screenshots show just how much the combined efforts of these modders have improved the visual experience of the game.  ",
