All models are static, they are not animated. (Donâ€™t ask me to animate them, because I do not know how to do this.)\r<br />All the original models and textures were made by\r<br />Yughues aka Nobiax (http://www.sharecg.com/pf/full_uploads.php?pf_user_name=yughues) except for the basic mesh of the new decidious trees which was made by Birdy (http://www.sharecg.com/pf/full_uploads.php?pf_user_name=birdy). The leaves for the new trees were also made by Yughues. \r<br />A big thanks to Yughues and Birdy for creating them and making them available for unrestricted use&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I think some modders can make use of these plants and so I imported them into the nif-format, modified and retextured some of them and made them game-ready for Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />I include a demo esp to show these plants. All plants can be found on a piece of land outside Whiterun along the way that leads to the Western Watchtower (you can use the console command: coe 3,-3). And I added the tropical plants to the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun. No pathgrids/navmeshes were touched so this should not affect the gameplay. \r<br />But of course this is only a demo, deactivate or delete the esp when no longer needed.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.3\r<br />============\r<br />\r<br />Reworked the collision of almost all meshes. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />More plants added:\r<br />\r<br />Cannabis plant flowering and not flowering, with and without collision. Cannabis was used in medieval times to make ship sails and ropes and even robust clothing. I am not responsible for what else you may use it. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.2\r<br />============\r<br />\r<br />More plants added:\r<br />\r<br />Bamboo plant with and without collision (Use with collision if you scale them up)\r<br />\r<br />5 new tropical shrubs\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1\r<br />============\r<br />\r<br />More plants added:\r<br />\r<br />Six decidious trees (you have to scale them up in the CS)\r<br />Cactus\r<br />Pumpkin Plant\r<br />\r<br />Added collision for the bent palm tree. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0\r<br />============\r<br />\r<br />Three different palm trees\r<br />Three tropical plants (Monstera, Bromelia, Palm Plant)\r<br />Two green bushes and a flowering bush in two colours (blue and red blossoms)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Tools used:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Nifskope\r<br />Gimp\r<br />Blender (for very basic editing and re-export)\r<br />Creation Kit\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />This is a modder&#39;s resource.You may use the meshes and textures for your own mods as long as you give credit, including the creators of the original models and you do not charge money for it.\r<br />\r<br />Do not upload to other sites\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Credits:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Yughues aka Nobiax (http://www.sharecg.com/pf/full_uploads.php?pf_user_name=yughues) for creating almost all of the original models and textures\r<br />Birdy (http://www.sharecg.com/pf/full_uploads.php?pf_user_name=birdy) for creating the decidious tree mesh.\r<br />The Niftools team for giving us Nifskope\r<br />Bethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit",
