  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#00FFFF]A standalone version of Uwry\\'s SpearBlade[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00]Since The SpearBlade was removed from the Immersive weapons Mod I have created a standalone version for anyone that misses it![/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#00FF00]All credit for this mod goes to Uwry the original mod creator. \r\nI have not changed anything with the SpearBlade, just made it available as a standalone weapon. \r\nFully craft-able and enchant-able.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00]Installation:\r\nFor easy installation just use the Nexus Mod Manager.\r\nTo install manually copy the downloaded .esp and meshes/textures folders into your Skyrim\\\\Data folder[/color]\r\n\r\nI hope you find this mod useful? I made it for my own personal use, but as I had noticed on the forums one or two people were missing the weapon, I decided to upload it. \r\nIf this mod is not to your taste, then feel free to move along to the next mod.\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000]Version history:\r\nV1.0 Initial release[/color]\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nAll credit and thanks go to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12087/]Uwry[/url] for the original mod and for allowing me to upload this standalone version.\r\nAdditional credit and thanks go to the original weapon designer - Iikka Ker√§nen\r\n\r\n[color=#00FFFF]Please take note: If you are using a pirated (ie non Steam enabled) version of the game, please do not leave comments about how this part of my mod or that is not working on your game! I am not prepared to waste my time trying to help you out with your illegal software! I\\'m unemployed, but still manage to pay for my games (they are what keep me sane) so if I can, you should be able to as well![/color]\r\n\r\nSoulMasterII\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/sm0g9rv24znf_zps9d795d9a.gif[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00]Please DO NOT upload any part of my mod any where else![/color]\r\n",
