  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=orange][size=5]THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS, ONE FOR THOSE WITH DAWNGUARD\r<br />AND ONE FOR THE OTHERS[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=199687024](Link to &#34;Vampirism: Weather&Brightness-Aware - Dawnguard Version&#34; on [color=yellow]Steam Workshop[/color])[/url]\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=199690087](Link to &#34;Vampirism: Weather&Brightness-Aware - No-Dawnguard Version&#34; on [color=yellow]Steam Workshop[/color])[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]-Description-[/size]\r<br />\r<br />The mod makes it so that, when you are outdoors during the day, you can regenerate Health, Magicka and Stamina \r<br />at a speed that depends on the light level that there is in the spot you are in. [u]This means that if you run out of Magicka or Stamina or\r<br /> just need to regenerate your Health after a battle, you aren&#39;t forced to go inside a building or cave or wait for the night, \r<br />but you can simply find a shaded place to rest for a while (like under a boulder, a big tree, or a building)[/u].\r<br />The changes to the regeneration speed all happen silently and swiftly, making it seem like a deeply-incorporated game mechanic.\r<br />\r<br />I put 5 ranges of light levels that I decided to use after testing in-game some of the game&#39;s weather conditions.\r<br />You will get 30% regeneration speed in the outside while it&#39;s raining or foggy, 50% - 65% in the shadows while it&#39;s sunny, 65% in storms and snowstorms, 80% in the shadows with rain or fog and 90% in the shadows with storms. The percentages may vary because the light levels that come with the various weather conditions are not sharply defined, and it also depends on the presence of other light sources.\r<br />\r<br />I decided not to touch the magicka, health and stamina damage because I felt the player would get a bit overpowered\r<br />(also because I should have made a spell for each vampirism stage and make the script bigger, too).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]-Updates-\r<br />\r<br />[/size][color=#add8e6]Update 4:[/color] I made a version compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80159]Sacrosanct - Vampires of Skyrim by Enai Siaion[/url]. It&#39;s based on version 2.03 of Sacrosanct\r<br />and it must be loaded AFTER it. Of course, you must have Dawnguard. If in Sacrosanct you activate its own &#34;regen in shadows&#34;\r<br />feature, my mod will be turned off. If you will decide to remove Sacrosanct for some reason (removing huge mods\r<br />can be dangerous for the save), you can switch to the normal version of my mod without problems, since the\r<br />script didn&#39;t change at all. Thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/1545890]kerrybeagle[/url], who tested the mod for me on Skyrim SE.\r<br />\r<br />[color=lightblue]Update 3:[/color] Version 1.2 is out. Now you don&#39;t have to manually remove and re-add the spell anymore\r<br />in order for it to get updated when installing newer versions of this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[color=lightblue]Update 2:[/color] I made version 1.1. Now, while swimming, you will get some regeneration, even under direct sunlight. Specifically,\r<br />you will get 35% regeneration speed under the sun, +20% while getting 30%, 50% or 65% from the shadows/overcast\r<br />sky and +10% while getting 80% from the shadows/overcast sky. I decided to leave the cap at 90%.\r<br />Thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/5855548/?]ScrollThief1984[/url], who pointed me out a page in which I found the informations on how to do this.\r<br />\r<br />[color=lightblue]Update 1:[/color] I made a version of the mod that is compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11487/?]Vampire Overhaul by Sann[/url]. The Dawnguard version\r<br />is based on version 4.5 of Sann&#39;s mod, and the no-Dawnguard one is based on the 4.3 one.\r<br />Since I didn&#39;t have to change the script, you can freely switch between this version and the normal one.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]-Compatibility-[/size]\r<br />\r<br />This mod won&#39;t give you any technical issue, because the only mods it&#39;s incompatible with are those that modify the effects of the sun on vampires, and more specifically only those that change the regeneration speed weakenings. It&#39;s not a dangerous type of incompatibility because the only bad side\r<br />would be having both mods modify the regeneration speeds, and since mine is calibrated on the vanilla behaviour of the sun&#39;s effects, you\r<br />would simply have too high or too low regeneration speeds during the day, depending on the changes made by the other one.\r<br />Confirmed incompatible mods: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9717/]Better Vampires by Brehanin[/url].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]-Installation-[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Simply put the files from the archive into Skyrim&#39;s &#34;Data&#34; folder (of course, you can download the mod with Nexus Mod Manager, if you use it).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]-Uninstallation-[/size]\r<br />\r<br />You better don&#39;t uninstall this mod since it uses scripts, but if you really want to, then:\r<br />\r<br />- Go to Skyrim&#39;s &#34;Data&#34; folder;\r<br />- Delete &#34;Weather_&_Brightness-Aware_Vampirism_[DG].esp&#34;;\r<br />- Delete &#34;Weather_&_Brightness-Aware_Vampirism_[DG].bsa&#34;.\r<br />\r<br /> Same instructions for the &#34;[no_DG]&#34; version.[/center]",
