  "descriptionHtml": "Hey, This is my first mod (that&#39;s been published) if you look at the mod data you&#39;ll see how messy it is [size=1](it shouldn&#39;t cause any problems with other mods... I think)[/size].\r<br />Its a basic follower named Arrow (comment if you&#39;ve got a better name). She has her own armour, sword, bow as well as CBBE body and SG-Hair (I didn&#39;t make them I just &#34;borrowed&#39; them) also she has chain lightning. As of now she is based i[color=#cccccc]n the Nightgate Inn and doesn&#39;t have any custom dialogue or quest but if I get enough attention I might add it (I don&#39;t know how currently).\r<br /> I am open to any suggestions, but seriously like anything  (Please don&#39;t hate)\r<br />\r<br />[/color]Mods Used/Stole the Meshes and Textures off :)\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52700/? - Sword\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60660/? - Bow\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11050/? - Armour (inverted the skirted version textures) \r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13180/? - Body Texture (I used body slide also)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
