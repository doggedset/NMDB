And make sure it loads after mine.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=008000][size=4][b]New Tempering Progression[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[color=008080][size=3][b] ACE - Crafting[/b][/size][/color]\r\n* Best tempering with no perks = Exquisite at smithing lvl87+\r\n* Best tempering with Armorsmith/Weaponsmith = Epic at smithing lvl100\r\n* Best tempering with Master Armorsmith/Weaponsmith = Legendary at smithing lvl100\r\n(the levels above get lower if Fortify Smithing enchantments are worn)\r\n\r\n[color=008080][size=3][b] Vanilla Skyrim[/b][/size][/color]\r\n* Best tempering with no perks = Flawless at smithing lvl100\r\n* Best tempering with appropriate perk = Legendary at smithing lvl91\r\n(the levels above get much lower if Fortify Smithing enchantments are worn)\r\n\r\nNote that in Vanilla the Fortify Smithing enchantments are much larger than in ACE Crafting.\r\n\r\n[color=008000][size=4][b]What this Mod does (more simply)[/b][/size][/color]\r\n - Tempering ability has been divided between weapons and armor perks\r\n - All weapons and all armor are now affected by these tempering perks.\r\n - The different armor perks only add the ability to create those items and add a slight damage bonus, they no longer add the double tempering bonuses.\r\n - Vanilla is easy to exploit, this mod is not.\r\n - Playing with this mod means you can max out the skill trees and still play a balanced game!\r\n\r\n[color=008000][size=4][b]For Existing Characters[/b][/size][/color]\r\n* To people adding this mod mid-game. All your perks will transfer smoothly. The weaponsmith and armorsmith perks are new though. You will have to add them. You can use the console command to replace missing perks with the new perks or to shift perk points around. (see below)\r\n* I strongly recommend making a new set of armor after installing this mod!\r\n* Item drops and loot can give better enchantments, it makes looting worthwhile again!\r\n* Your old potions and gear will still have their enchants unchanged on them.\r\n\r\n[color=008000][size=4][b]Mod Compatibility[/b][/size][/color]\r\nSmithing Perks Overhaul (SPO) - Not necessary and not compatible. SPO adds more items to some smithing perks. My mod affects all weapons and all armors in the game, so SPO is no longer necessary if you use my mod.\r\nComplete Crafting Overhaul (CCO) - Compatible. Furthermore, my mod removes SPO as a prerequisite to CCO. The load order is not important.\r\nWeapons and Armor Fixes (WAF) - Compatible. The load order is not important.\r\nother mods? - ask in the discussion thread, I will try them out!\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/10521-1-1333129414.jpg[/img][/center]",
