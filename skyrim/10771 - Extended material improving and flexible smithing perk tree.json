  "descriptionHtml": "ADDED FIX FOR SKYRIM PATCH 1.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\nAdds most missing armor and weapon materials by adding them to existing perks or the new ones: Basic Smithing and Silver Smithing.  Also it gives you freedom of choice past Advanced Smithing (same old advanced armor, only renamed and relocated): You can choose any of the materials without PERK requirements. Smithing level requirements still apply. So, once advanced smithing is reached, you can wait until 100 and pick only dragon smithing, if you choose so.\r\n\r\n Daedric Smithing stems out of Arcane Smithing, since it\\'s not a material, but a smithing technique. It still requires 90 smithing. The other perks have been renamed to reflect their materials, but they\\'re the same. All on a perk tree that  actually looks like a freaking anvil :P\r\n\r\n\r\nINCREASED IMPROVING ADDED FOR:\r\n\r\nSILVER PERK \r\nSilver\r\nFalmer\r\n\r\nBASIC SMITHING\r\nWood\r\nIron\r\nLeather\r\nFur\r\nStudded\r\nImperial light\r\n\r\nSTEEL\r\nImperial heavy\r\nDraugr\r\n\r\nELVEN\r\nElvend gilded\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to add materials that are still missing, go ahead and add them all, then PM me so I can get the files from you and give you proper credit on this page.
