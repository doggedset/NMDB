  "descriptionHtml": "[left][i][quote]This is a really simple Skyrim modification. It only took me a half an hour, and that&#39;s because I&#39;m clueless in regards to the Creation Kit. \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve left some tracks as they were, such as the Sovngarde track, but almost every other track has been switched. \r<br />\r<br />I categorized each track the exact same way it was organised in Oblivion:\r<br />\r<br />Combat:\r<br />   - A Knife in the Dark\r<br />   - Amon Hen\r<br />   - Ash and Smoke\r<br />   - Forth Eorlings\r<br />   - Helm&#39;s Deep\r<br />   - Minas Morgul\r<br />   - The Black Gate is Closed\r<br />   - The Black Gate Opens\r<br />   - The Bridge of Khazad Dum\r<br />   - The End of all Things\r<br />   - The Fields of the Pelenor\r<br />   - The Ride of the Rohirrim\r<br />   - The Riders of Rohan\r<br />\r<br />Dungeon: \r<br />   - Cirith Ungol\r<br />   - Gollum&#39;s Song\r<br />   - Hope Fails\r<br />   - Shelob&#39;s Lair\r<br />   - The Forbidden Pool\r<br />   - The Leave Taking\r<br />   - The Passage of the Marshes\r<br />\r<br />Explore: \r<br />   - The Ring Goes South\r<br />   - A Storm Is Coming\r<br />   - Breath of Life\r<br />   - Evenstar\r<br />   - Farewell the Lorien\r<br />   - Hope and Memory \r<br />   - Lothlorien\r<br />   - Minas Tirith\r<br />   - Samwise the Brave\r<br />   - The Breaking of the Fellowship\r<br />   - The Great River\r<br />   - The King of the Golden Hall \r<br />   - The Steward of Gondor\r<br />   - The White Tree\r<br />   - Twilight and Shadow\r<br />\r<br />Tavern:\r<br />   - Concerning Hobbits\r<br />   - Into the West\r<br />   - May it Be \r<br />   - The Grey Havens\r<br />\r<br />Town:\r<br />   - Anduril\r<br />   - Evenstar\r<br />   - Many Meetings\r<br />   - May it Be\r<br />   - The Council of Elrond\r<br />   - The Grey Havens\r<br />   - The Return of the King\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is recommended for anyone. The Skyrim OST grows exceedingly dull after a good while and the LOTR soundtrack is one of the greatest ever created. It suits the atmosphere of the game to the &#39;T&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Just drag and drop the &#39;Data&#39; folder into your main Skyrim directory and merge the stuff. Could not be easier. make sure the .esp is enabled in the Data Files section of the run menu.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy, \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />All Film Trilogy Soundtracks were not created by me, (DUH) but were composed by Howard Shore and performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra for the exclusive purpose of making The Lord of the Rings Film Trilogy an even more epic thing to witness.[/quote][/i][/left]                      ",
