  "descriptionHtml": "on STEAM - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=74678299\r\n\r\nNOTICE - IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH HIM NOT TALKING TO YOU WHEN YOU FIRST GO TO SEE HIM, LEAVE THE BANNERED MARE, THEN GO BACK IN.  THIS OCCURS BECAUSE OF HOW I HAVE THE QUESTS SETUP IN THE STORY MANAGER.\r\n\r\nHave you ever gotten bored while playing Skyrim with how your character looks?  Have you ever wanted to raise a skill 5 points to get to that next group of spells, or the next perk?  I give you Loki Manadagr.  His name carries with it change with the day of the moon.  (Manadagr means moon day from Norse)\r\n\r\nYou can find Loki In the Bannered Mare in Whiterun.\r\n\r\nThis gives the player the ability to change appearance, and level skills in game freely through an NPC. useful for playtesting and when you want to make a new character but dont want to start at level 1, yet don\\'t feel comfortable with console commands.  This mod will not conflict with any other mods.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\nNotes from Game Informer - issue 231\r\n----------------------------------\r\n[quoted under fair use copyright law]\r\n\\\"\\\"The ability to change your character\\'s face was something that came up often in fan feedback,\\\" says Carofano.  In response to those requests, Dawnguard adds a character hidden down in the Rayway of Riften who can alter your appearance.  Race and gender are still locked, but you can tweak your other facial features in case your hero doesn\\'t look as awesome as you initially thought.\\\" page 59\r\n\r\nLoki will continue to enable you to change ALL aspects of your character, and works on custom races.  I\\'ll have him be the other NPC\\'s mentor because the other NPC doesn\\'t offer as much.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nDeveloper Notes\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nI do NOT use EVENT OnRaceSwitchComplete(), which avoids any issues with werewolf or other modded transformations.  Some players will receive a level after using the race menu.  I\\'ve not discerned why.  This does not effect, change, or reset any quests.\r\n\r\nNOTICE: works on ALL custom races to date.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nPlease watch the below covering managing and troubleshooting mods.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltFnZD0DOHA\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 16th resolved issues with Loki not appearing in the Bannered Mare.  You\\'ll find him there now when starting a new game or continuing from a save.\r\n\r\n---------\r\nCredits\r\n---------\r\n\r\nConcept by: Sorrow_Xvi-Clic\r\nDeveloper / Programmer: Hellcat5",
