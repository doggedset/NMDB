TESV seems to dislike weapon racks which have a 90 or 180 degree position (which is why some weapons show upside down.) I have tweaked those racks and they now function as desired.\r<br />\r<br />2.  Weapon plaques also have an issue where the collision planes from other objects prevent you removing weapons from the plaques once placed. I have moved the plaques out slightly do accommodate this and they now work as expected.\r<br />\r<br />Please ensure you have a previous save to revert to to retain the weapons from those plaques as once the plaques are moved in the new update the weapons will be inaccessible as they will appear behind the plaque. \r<br />\r<br />3.  I have added two cupboards to the armory for storing weapons and armor you don&#39;t want on display.\r<br />\r<br />4.  I have added two more dagger display cases to the armory.\r<br />\r<br />5.
