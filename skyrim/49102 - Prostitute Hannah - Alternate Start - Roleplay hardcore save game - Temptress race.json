Especially after getting beaten up by a customer. I could get killed, and nobody would miss me. Because I&#39;m not worth anything to anyone. \r<br />\r<br />Maybe I can have a decent life one day. My father would have hated me for what I&#39;m doing. He would probably have wanted me to set out on a great adventure like him. All those corners of the world, I wish I could see them. \r<br />\r<br />I have to be careful who I&#39;m seeing. I got away with a  bruised eye today... I want to change, but I don&#39;t know how&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />/Hannah[/i][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />__________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />You are a 19 year old girl working as a prostitute. Your last customer beat you badly, and you realize that things need to change. But you&#39;re not sure if you have the courage to do so, whoredom is the only life you know.\r<br />\r<br />Your speech is increased to easier seduce men for a living. Other than that, you have no skills. You have no knowledge of the Helgen incident, and the main quest is disabled. If you want to make something out of your life, you must earn it the hard way. \r<br />\r<br />Welcome to an alternate reality in Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />__________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FFFF][b]REQUIRES:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Script Extender:[/color] [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]here[/url]\r<br />[color=#00FFFF]Temptress Race:[/color]  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18717/]here[/url]\r<br />[color=#00FFFF]Enhanced Character Edit:[/color] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12951/]here[/url]\r<br />[color=#00FFFF]ApachiiSkyHair:[/color]  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168]here[/url]\r<br />[color=#00FFFF]Osare GothicLolita:[/color]  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17727/]here[/url] (her dress -- might be naked otherwise)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />OPTIONAL:\r<br />[color=#00FFFF]ApachiiSkyHair natural Retexture: [/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35092/]here[/url] (hair texture)\r<br />[color=#00FFFF]BI Phenotypes version &#34;Barbarian UNP&#34;[/color]: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31954/]here[/url] (abused/bruiced textures)\r<br />[color=#00FFFF]Eyes of Beauty:[/color]  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/]here[/url] (eye texture)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FFFF]\r<br />If you want to gameplay as a prostitute you need [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10748/]Animated Prostitution[/url] (or other sex mods, but newer versions of AP does have a working NPC-pays-you-for-sex).[/color]  You can skip it of course, not required for the save to work.\r<br />\r<br />For immersion you may want to use some &#34;girly&#34; standing idles, like [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11954/]Pretty Female Idles[/url]. \r<br />\r<br />[b]OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS[/b]\r<br />\r<br />- Difficulty: Legendary\r<br />- Roleplay your progress from the bottom of society through notes in the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48375/]Journal[/url] \r<br />- Don&#39;t cheat using console.\r<br />\r<br />___________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />[b]TROUBLESHOOTING[/b]\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s possible to get different eyes if you have other mods installed. This is a common Skyrim issue. Open &#34;showracemenu&#34; and pick a new eye color.\r<br />\r<br />I have all DLC&#39;s + unofficial patches, the save game should work just fine with the Vanilla game and the above mods.
