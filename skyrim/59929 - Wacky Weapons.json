  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds several ridiculous weapons to the game made out of objects from around Skyrim.\r<br />These weapons are craftable and can be bought at Belethor&#39;s general goods in Whiterun. All weapons are of Daedric quality.\r<br />\r<br />So far these weapons include:\r<br />- Mr Bones\r<br />- Lil Dovah\r<br />- Lute\r<br />- Dibella statue\r<br />- Pan\r<br />- Pitchfork\r<br />- Shovel\r<br />- Charred Skeever\r<br />- Troll skull hammer\r<br />- Talos shrine (bounces target)\r<br />- Skeleton arm staff (pulls target to you)\r<br />- Giant&#39;s hammer (launches target into the sky)\r<br />\r<br />If anyone likes this mod I will make more weapons.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />NoteÂ [b][i]I am not an experienced modder&#33;[/i][/b]\r<br />I started making these weapons just to practice using creation kit and nifscope, but now that I made an esp I decided to upload it.\r<br />I also couldn&#39;t find another mod like this, but maybe I didn&#39;t search well enough.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Known issues:\r<br />- When these weapons are dropped they all have the physics of an iron mace, so they clip and roll around oddly\r<br />- Sometimes the Talos weapon will send enemies through the floor\r<br />- The lute uses thrusting killmoves\r<br />- The giants hammer does not kill people on hit and does not launch on killing blows\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please tell me if the mod does not work&#33;",
