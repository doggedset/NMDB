A cozy place for Tamriels most powerful magic user to relax and escape from the day to day trials he/she faces. \r\n\r\nThe home is modest, yet comfortable with many ammenities befitting a person in such a prestigious position. Including an elevator to the Masters Study.\r\n\r\nThe key can be found in the Arch-Mages quarters in Winterhold (therefore making it tricky to get before the related quests are done) and it has a journal under it explaining how it came to be. \r\n\r\n=== Features ===\r\n\r\n7 Mannequins\r\n14 generic containers (non-respawn)\r\n11 Named Containers\r\n2 respawning ingredient barrels\r\n1 respawning Apothecary Satchel\r\n6 display cases\r\n6 Book cases (Winterhold style)\r\nFully Nav-Meshed\r\n\r\n=== Whats NOT in it ===\r\n\r\nSmelter\r\nsharpening wheel\r\nwork bench\r\nweapon plaques/racks\r\nNor tons of statues/shrines/cheat/God items/banners et al. This is NOT a house for you if you want to have the Wal-Mart house (i.e. EVERYTHING in one place) \r\n\r\n\r\n=== Installation ===\r\n\r\nUnzip \\\"AMRetreat\\\" into your Data file and make sure it is checked when you start your game.\r\nPlace the included meshes in the appropriate folders.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Needed Files ===\r\n\r\nThere is nothing else \\\"required\\\" for the mod (other than what is packaged with it), but if you want it to look like the pictures above you must have the following (these other mods are AWESOME however so you should get them anyway)\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6604]\r\nLittle Baron Paintings 1p0 [/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5265]Enhanced Noble Furniture 4x _byMike[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Known Issues ===\r\n\r\nThe lower tower outside sometimes disappears (known Bethesda bug)\r\nSome light flicker in the Masters Study (known Bethesda bug)\r\nThere is a short pause when you hit the upper button on the elevator to go down. I\\'m not sure why this is. I know I have the \\\"delay\\\" set to 0, so I\\'m a bit weirded out by this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Thanks and Credits ===\r\n\r\nTo Blary for his/her [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14135]BookSets Resource[/url] and for the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14133] FoodContainer Resource,[/url] I use (and package with) in this mod.\r\n\r\nTo Eldiabs for his/her [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11618]Weapon Racks-Bookshelves-Plaques-Mannequins[/url]. It made making this mod SOOOOOOO much easier!\r\n\r\nBethesda (of course) for the world we play in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Final Thoughts ===\r\n\r\nThe Arch-Mage of Skyrim is a thankless position, full of hazards and pitfalls around every corner. So take a bit to relax and cool down in this glacier home.\r\n\r\nAnd throw a modder an endorse if you like it. Thanks all.",
