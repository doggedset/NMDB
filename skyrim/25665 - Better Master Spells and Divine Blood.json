  "summary": "Reduces cast time of Master Spells, makes most Either Hand rather than Both Hands. And an optional Divine Blood god ability.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Reduces casting time on Master spells to sub-1 second, many of which have also been moved to Either Hand rather than Both Hands - so you can use them with other spells or a weapon.\r\n\r\nI thought Master Spells were kinda retarded in vanilla. It\\'s like you go all DBZ style and are like \\\"hold on let me power up\\\" while everyone else is just like \\\"lol *slash slash interrupt kill*\\\". \r\n\r\nSo anyways, yeah. I did that. Greater Heal is a bit faster cast as well. I didn\\'t really feel like I needed all of the massive magic overhauls around here, just wanted my master spells to not seem so bad. It goes without saying, this will obviously be incompatible with anything that changes those skills. Well, probably. More than likely. Well, I dunno. I\\'m sure you\\'ll find out.\r\n\r\n[color=red]The following is an entirely optional CHEAT / GOD option:[/color]\r\n\r\nThere is also an optional ability added called Divine Blood. You can\\'t acquire this in-game by any means and it has to be added by console. It\\'s... basically how the name sounds. It\\'s for those playthroughs that you just want to kill absolutely everyfuckingthing. I thought to myself what I would want if I just wanted to wreck everything and not have to do a bunch of nonsense with the console or even wear things for that matter.\r\n\r\nI actually made it because I was like \\\"Okay. I became Sheogorath in Oblivion. Why can\\'t I still BE Sheogorath, coming into Skyrim? I mean, as a Daedric Prince(ess?) it\\'s not like I\\'d have died of old age...\\\"\r\n\r\nOf course, that\\'s all made a little confusing by Sheogorath actually being in Skyrim. But ah, as the Prince of Madness... I\\'m not sure anything HAS to make sense.\r\n\r\nAnyways, that Divine Blood ability (which is totally optional) adds the following:\r\n\r\nFortify Restoration - free casting\r\nFortify HealRate - almost instant\r\nFortify Carry Weight - +3000 capacity\r\nFortify Health - +350 health\r\nMelee Damage - 60 - not sure what this did...\r\nRegenerate Magicka - almost instant regen\r\nFortify Stamina - +2000 stamina\r\nRegenerate Stamina - almost instant regen\r\nFortify Magicka - +1000 magicka\r\nResist Disease - immune\r\nWaterbreathing\r\nFortify Unarmed Damage - hit harder unarmed (a lot harder)\r\nMuffle - silent\r\nFortify Shouts - reduced timer\r\nFortify One-Handed - stronger\r\nFortify Archery - stronger\r\nFortify Two-Handed - stronger\r\nForce Without Effort - eliminate stumble\r\nFortify Destruction Power - much more powerful\r\nFortify Destruction - free casting\r\nFortify Alteration - free casting\r\nFortify Conjuration - free casting\r\nFortify Illusion - free casting\r\n\r\nYou can basically let 50 Giants AND the entire Dark Brotherhood wail on you to no avail (while you\\'re completely naked even). I\\'m actually not entirely sure what made it basically impervious to damage, but... it definitely is. So, have fun with that. Oh and your Lightning Cloak (if you cast it, that is) will kill ALL of them in about 3-5 seconds (most of your destruction spells will yield a similar experience). Fun fun fun. Needs more cheese.\r\n\r\nhelp \\\"Divine Blood\\\" 0\r\nplayer.addspell xx000d62\r\nplayer.removespell xx000d62\r\n\r\nThough, I\\'ll note, you can still die from fall damage like a boss.",
