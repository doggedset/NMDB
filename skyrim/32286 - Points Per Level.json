  "descriptionHtml": "I was always bothered by the fact that as an assassin if I couldn\\'t kill them in one shot at higher levels, I would be destroyed if it got physical or I needed to use magicka. I never had enough.\r\n\r\nSo I figured I\\'d make it so I got more of it every level. \r\n\r\nAnd so I made this simple mod that gives you 7 more points per level, for a total of 17 points. This allows your character to become a more well-rounded fighter at higher levels, so you can be less picky about where your points go. I don\\'t call it a cheat because I always thought that only ten points per level was a bit skimpy.\r\n\r\n",
