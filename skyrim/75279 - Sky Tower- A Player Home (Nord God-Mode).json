  "descriptionHtml": "Built to suit my Skyrim needs, and wants. The Sky Tower save is my second console modding project, and my first submission to the Nexus. \r<br />\r<br />This massive structure was built by Hermaus Mora in agreement with the Ideal Masters, to contain a soul cairn crystal in order to study, and ultimately wield it&#39;s true power. \r<br />\r<br />You are a former prisoner of Apocrypha. For eons you&#39;ve remained undetected, and unable to escape whilst you studied the hidden knowledge within the dark lords realm. Your last frayed ends of sanity bound together by your sheer will to betray, and escape your foul captor.  ...but how?  How could you cut a god deep enough so that it would bleed for eternity?\r<br />\r<br />In a single moment, like a bolt lightning striking your very soul, you know the answer... Using the vast knowledge you&#39;ve accumulated you conjure a powerful portal rivaled only by the Oblivion Gates themselves. With this gateway you steal Hermaus Mora&#39;s most prized possession-- but that isn&#39;t enough... as a testament to your skill, and the final humiliating blow to a dark lord, you steal his eye. Keeping it in your private store room, in a dark box, so that he may be forced to gaze upon the one who cut him so deeply.\r<br />\r<br />Now you control the structure, sapping the energy from the world itself. Though by passing through the portal your mind has been altered, your memories are fractured, and yet your power is immeasurable. One thing is undeniably certain,  ...This world will never be the same again.",
