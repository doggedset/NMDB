  "summary": "Adds a Wood Elf child in Solitude.",
  "descriptionHtml": "By popular demand, this mod adds an adoptable Wood Elf child in Solitude. Her name is Aratalath.\r\n\r\nHer parents died from a disease and now she\\'s waiting for someone to come and take her away from the loneliness off Solitude.\r\n\r\nAbout the screenshot; she uses one of the vanilla wood elf eyes, but I\\'m using a texture replacer, making them bright blue. I don\\'t recall the name of that mod though.\r\n\r\nHere\\'s a texture replacer to remove the shimmer from the face and body that is present in the Drow mod. http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?pnoce1d0qpy4ww3\r\n\r\nRequired files:\r\nHearthfire\r\nDrow Race http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16399/?\r\n\r\nRecommended mods:\r\nChild clothes for adult based children http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26952/\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\nAratalath might grow to adult size when using a cooking pot or sitting at a bench. But she\\'ll shrink down to normal size when she stops using those items. It\\'s a vanilla bug for children of a custom race.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting:\r\nIf she wont leave the place after you\\'ve adopted her, you can target her in the console, type \\\"coc *house cell name*\\\"(example: whiterunbreezehome) and then type \\\"moveto player\\\".\r\n\r\nFuture plans:\r\nAdding a male Bosmer child in Markarth. I need name suggestions though.\r\nAlso thinking of adding a version with ApachiiSkyHair too.\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\nZazemel for the Drow (and child) race\r\ntktk1 for their Khajiit child mod I used as a template to make this child.",
