  "summary": "A script usable in the Creation Kit to turn a chair into a &#39;reading chair.&#39;",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a script you can use the CK to attach to a chair.  Use the &#34;auto-fill&#34; function to fill in the chair&#39;s ID, and thereafter, it is a &#39;reading chair&#39;, any character who sits in it will pull out a book and begin to read.  The script itself is fully commented and includes the source file so you can edit it for your own projects.  One suggested use would be to attach it to the chairs in the Arcaneum in the College of Winterhold, and/or in the rooms of the students there.  Then, when people sit down in the chairs, they&#39;ll start reading.  And, you know, look like they&#39;re actually at a college and maybe learning stuff.\r<br />\r<br />Permissions:  You are free to use this script in any project or mod of your own, permission is not required.  Some credit would be nice, but hey.",
