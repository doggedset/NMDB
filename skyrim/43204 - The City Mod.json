  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to THE CITY MOD NEW VERSION INCLUDES LODS FOR ALL NEW BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nThis mod is a resource pack of city buildings for modders to use to create their own large cities.\r\nIt includes a 27 new city buildings, LOD\\'s for the buildings and a demo area outside white run.\r\nThe demo area is about the same size as white run but is not nearly as detailed as its only purpose\r\nis to showcase the buildings. \r\n\r\nMost of the new buildings are based off pre existing buildings that had incomplete portions.\r\neg: they had no back as they were intended to be used in conjunction with other objects and only viewed from the front. What I\\'ve done is modelled up the missing facades, redone the collision meshes, and added a few entire new buildings, So you can now place city buildings anywhere, without requiring other objects to hide incomplete portions.\r\n\r\nNOTE MODDERS: IF YOU USE THIS RESOURCE PACK PLEASE CREDIT THIS MOD IN YOUR READ ME AND DESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nTo install, extract meshes folder, and gkbbigcity.esp into the skyrim data folder \r\n(default location C:\\\\\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\\\\\Steam\\\\\\\\SteamApps\\\\\\\\common\\\\\\\\Skyrim\\\\\\\\Data)\r\n\r\nThis resource pack includes the following -\r\n\r\n13 City buildings\r\n\r\nsanhousegkb.nif\r\nsevette san housegkb.nif\r\nsstyrrshousegkb.nif\r\nsthe winking skeevergkb.nif\r\nsbuildinggkb.nif\r\nsvittoriavicihousegkb.nif\r\nsbryling housegkb.nif\r\nsthalmorhousegkb.nif\r\nshouseforsalegkb.nif\r\nsblacksmith2gkb.nif\r\nshmd_apothecarygkb.nif\r\nsblacksmith1gkb.nif\r\nsthalmorbarracksgkb.nif\r\n\r\n14 houses\r\n\r\nsfarmhouse04gkb.nif\r\nsfarmhouse05gkb.nif\r\nsfarmhouse06gkb.nif\r\nsfarmhouse07gkb.nif\r\nsfarmhouse08gkb.nif\r\nsfarmhouse08gkbterrace.nif\r\nsfarmhouse09gkb.nif\r\nsfarmhouse09gkbterrace.nif\r\nsfarmhouse10gkb.nif\r\nsfarmhouse10gkbterrace.nif\r\nsfarmhouse11gkb.nif\r\nsfarmhouse12gkb.nif\r\nsfarmhouse13gkb.nif\r\nsoverhanggkb.nif\r\n\r\nALSO INCLUDES LODS FOR ALL BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nFor other GKB mods, look for GKB Green Trees (resource pack with hundreds of new tree models) \r\nand Caribou Gone (an environment mod adding hundreds of tree types across the skyrim landscape)\r\n\r\nPS. I named this the BIG CITY Mod before realising there is a Morrowind Mod of the same name, So I\\'m just calling it \\\"The City Mod\\\" because then at least it can be confused with hundreds of mods instead of one. :)",
