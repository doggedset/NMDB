  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very small mod for Enderal, which adds more time to do the 5 sticks riddle. If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, just ignore this, you either aren&#39;t there yet or it was easy enough for you and you already forgot about it. \r<br />I added 18 seconds to the previous 12 for a total of 30 seconds to complete the task. Now you could do it by walking. \r<br />Most people won&#39;t need it at all, but if you are like me and both hate those type of challenges and are truly bad at them, you might wish to give it a try to save yourself some frustration. \r<br />\r<br />Since the script seems to be only for this part of the quest, nothing else shoud be broken or affected in any way.\r<br />\r<br />To install, just extract it in the Data folder. You can simply delete it afterwards.",
