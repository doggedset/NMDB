  "summary": "Adds craftable iron bolts. Also available from the two existing bolt vendors. You learn to make them when you learn to make steel bolts. Requires no perks.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This adds Iron Bolts to the game. I was bothered that if I wanted to ever craft more bolts I had to go into the smithing perks. So I\\'ve added these to the game. \r\n\r\nThey do 8 damage, versus steel\\'s 10 damage. You gain the ability to craft them when you gain the ability to craft steel bolts, except they require no perks to make them. They cost one iron ingot and one firewood to craft. \r\n\r\nThey have been added to the two vendors that already sell steel bolts, however you won\\'t find any iron bolts lying around Fort Dawnguard, nor will any Dawnguard members use these. They will keep using steel bolts.\r\n\r\nRequires Dawnguard.\r\n\r\nAvailable on the Steam Workshop:\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=167222631",
