  "descriptionHtml": "Here is a improved texture and normal mapping pack for all the DragonPreist Masks that you can find in Skyrim. Just like my Daedric Texture Improvement, the mod follows the same path, and keeps the orginal size of the textures for keeping optimal performance, and is suitable for low end computers ho can run the game normaly, but cant run on HD Texture packs that can melt your CPU or GPU.\r\n-----Installation------\r\n\r\nPlace the Textures folder into your Skyrim data game folder. or let your Nexus Mod Manager fix it for you.\r\n------\r\n\r\nSince i dont have all the masks yet, there are only 2 or 3 screenshots on Vokun, Morokei and Krosis, but all masks are improved. To see the effect at best, you need to see the masks in the game, since the screenshots are not dynamic ;)\r\n\r\nGot any critics? Or maybe want to add something random? Feel free to post it in the comment section ;)",
