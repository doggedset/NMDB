She never knew her parents and was raised by a family in Falkreath. She learned to hunt at a young age, and was off hunting in the surrounding woods. She learned to harvest plants to make potions and poisons, and would often hike far for ingredients.\r<br />\r<br />She liked to be alone in nature. She learned to hunt big game and was fearless. When she was a young adult, hunting in the mountains, she was attacked suddenly by a dragon, which and left her partially blind with great scars on her face. She treated the wounds herself with potions and herbal remedies, but it never fully healed. Now she dresses that side of her face with warpaint, giving her a very sinister look. She would later return to the mountain and slay the dragon, making sure to take out both of its eyes with two well-placed arrows.\r<br />\r<br />Shortly after that encounter, she left Falkreath to wander Skyrim and immerse herself in its beauty.\r<br />\r<br />[center]___________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Akaata (Breton)\r<br />***********************\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/bocgEaMl.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />***********************[/center]\r<br />She was raised in Windhelm, saw the way the Nords treated people horribly, and wanted to leave. She&#39;s not too fond of the Imperials, but she hates the Nords&#39; part in the war because she believed their rule was less just than that of the Imperials. The Nords were seemingly racist and she hated Ulfrich Stormcloak, who she witnessed being very selfish and opportunistic, which are not qualities of a true Nord, nor a leader.\r<br />\r<br />She wanted to leave Windhlem. She learned to smith, made herself a sword, and left to join the college of Winterhold, where she discovered the Midden, and the evil that lied within.\r<br />\r<br />She uses illusion and destruction magic, and wields a single handed weapon.",
