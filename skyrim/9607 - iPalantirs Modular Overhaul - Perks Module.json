  "descriptionHtml": "\r\n=====================\r\n+++CURRENT VERSION+++\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nV1.01 - June 11th 2012\r\n\r\n=================\r\n+++Description+++\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis mod is aimed to change how perks are awarded to the player, introducing perk tomes. Instead of thinking of these abilities as perks, consider them as books of knowledge that can further your skill and mastery in a way that made you better than ordinary mages, warriors and thieves. These tomes completely replace the gain of perks through leveling. The tomes will be scattered around Skyrim in locations relevant to their content. So advanced techniques in stealth for example will likely be located in the possession of stealthy factions. Also, magical knowledge is probably found in the libraries of the College of Winterhold.\r\n\r\n================\r\n+++DOWNLOAD+++\r\n================\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9607\r\n\r\n==============\r\n+++Features+++\r\n==============\r\n\r\n-Perk Tomes will replace perk points when leveling.\r\n-Perk Tomes are relevantly located in places of interest, regarding the skills they\\'re based on.\r\n-No additional Perk points when levelling.
