INFORMATION ON THE MOD           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod makes it so groups of bandits attack hold capitals on a random basis.\r\n\r\n\t   When you are near the hold capitals, bandits may suddenly attack.  There will be eight\r\nof them, four with melee weapons, two with bows, one with magic, and one boss who is tougher than\r\nthe others.  They will attack anything that moves.  These bandits are leveled and will always be \r\nabout the same level that you are.\r\n\r\n\t   The bandits will jump out of hiding and start their attack outside the city walls or on\r\nthe outskirts of town.  This will minimize civilian casualties since they will mainly be fighting the \r\nguards and you.  But for cities without walls, there will be more civilian casualties.\t   \r\n\r\n\t   The bandits get reused by being resurrected and moved to where they need to be, so this \r\nmod cannot create any PlaceAtMe savegame bloat.\r\n\r\n\t   If a town has two gates, the bandits may attack either one.\r\n\r\n\t   There is a 1 in 20 chance of bandits attacking the average hold capital while you are \r\nentering or leaving it.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod uses vanilla Skyrim bandit templates, so if it is used with mods that edit bandit\r\nweapons and armor, then the new items should show up properly on the bandits involved in the raid.\r\n\r\n\t   If you have ever wondered why bandits don\\'t attack towns and have been unhappy about it, \r\nthen this is your chance to make it so they do. \t    \r\n************************************************************************\r\n2. Installation                           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n           Extract (decompress) the .esp and the .bsa to your Skyrim directory.  \r\n(It will be something like *Installation directory*\\\\Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data)\r\nMark the box next to \\\"Bandit Raid.esp\\\" in your mod manager.\r\n \r\n           Alternately, extract files someplace else.  Then move the .esp and .bsa \r\nto Skyrim\\\\Data.  Mark the box next to the plugin in your mod manager.\r\n************************************************************************\r\n3. Version History    \r\n************************************************************************\r\nV 1.0    6/6/12   Initial release.   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n4. Conflicts, Known Issues, and Troubleshooting\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod has been constructed to be compatible with the mod \\\"Mercy.\\\"\r\n\r\n\t   This mod should be compatible with Open Cities-style mods, but civilian casualties will be \r\nhigher.\t  \r\n\r\n\t   There is the chance that you could retrigger the trigger zone during a bandit raid, and \r\nhave the virtual die roll make the 1 in 20 roll thereby resurrecting all the bandits again and making\r\nthe raid longer and fiercer.\r\n\r\n\t   The bandits in this mod spawn outside the city walls and are usually unable to get into the \r\ncity due to the efforts of the guards.  But with the unwalled cities, this could turn into a massacre\r\nof the civilians.  If you use this mod, you will depopulate your cities to some extent or other.  The \r\neight bandits that make up each raid are about the same level as you.  If you are level 40, you will\r\nturn loose eight level-40 bandits among the helpless civilians.  So if you are worried about \r\ndepopulation, do not use this mod.\r\n\r\n\t   Although it was never witnessed in play-testing, this seems like the sort of mod that could\r\ntrigger a CTD at the instant a bandit raid starts if the computer is too weak for Skyrim or if it is \r\noverloaded with too many mods or background processes.\r\n\r\n\t   The way the triggers are set up, you will not see as many bandit raids if you always fast\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\n\t   The bandits do not check to see whether a dragon attack is underway.  They may possibly \r\nattack at the same time a dragon does.\r\n\r\n\t   The bandit raids do not check the status of the civil war.  The bandits could quite possibly\r\nattack during a major battle.  Not a very wise move on their part.  But nobody ever said that bandits\r\nwere very smart.\t   \t   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n5.
