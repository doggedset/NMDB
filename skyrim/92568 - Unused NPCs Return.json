  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=6][b]UNUSED NPCs RETURN[/b][/size][/center]﻿\n<br />\n<br />This mod aims to bring back NPCs that are unused or hidden in Skyrim's game files and repurpose them. [i][b]NONE[/b][/i] of these NPCs to my knowledge have been implemented through other mods such as Cutting Room Floor. I made it for my personal use but I've decided to share it on Nexus. This is a very, very simple mod, it doesn't do anything extravagant, it doesn't add any new quests, items or custom AI for any of the NPCs I reintroduced into the game.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=2][u]Content Added[/u][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Version 0.1\n<br />[i]What's New[/i]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Added NPC: Domna Magia\n<br />[*]Added NPC: Hrolmir, Reves, Skeggr\n<br />[*]Added NPC: Makhel Abbas\n<br />[*]Added NPC: Muril\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Version 0.2\n<br />[i][i]What's New[/i][/i]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Added NPC: Urchin\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Version 0.4\n<br />[i]What's New[/i][i]\n<br />[/i][list]\n<br />[*]Added NPC: Castor the Puzzlemaker\n<br />[*]Added NPC: Drunk Cultist\n<br />[*]Added NPC: Dawnguard Hunter (Now renamed 'Gardsgar the Hunter') [b][*WIP*][/b]\n<br />[*]Added NPC: Jolf\n<br />[*]Added NPC: Rogen\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Version 0.5\n<br />[i]What's New[/i]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Added NPC: Escaped Prisoner (Now renamed 'Mysterious Escaped Prisoner')\n<br />[*]Added Item: Khajiit Ring\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[i]How the mod implements these Unused NPCs and items\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]Castor the Puzzlemaker[/b] - An unused dead bandit to be found in Solstheim. He can be found dead somewhere in Solstheim.\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][b]Domna Magia [/b][/size]- An Imperial that was left disabled in Solitude by Bethesda. She has now been implemented as a Bard in the Bards College and will sandbox around Solitude.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Drunk Cultist[/b] - Meant to be used in quest 'A Night To Remember' as a cultist in Morvunskar but was left disabled by Bethesda. I've now enabled her, and she will sandbox around Morvunskar.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Gardsgar the Hunter[/b] - Originally meant to be a Dawnguard Hunter, likely to be used in the questline, but was cut out. I renamed him and changed his appearance. He will now patrol the Rift, Dawnguard HQ, and he will sandbox in the Dawnguard HQ aswell.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Hrolmir, Reves, Skeggr[/b] - 3 Unused NPCs meant to be used in the Thieves Guild quest 'The Pursuit', the now have new appearances, are brothers and have been added to the Thieves Guild. They will roam the Thieves Guild Headquarters.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Jolf[/b] - Unused NPC, seeming to be used as a Dock Worker. He has now been implemented as a dock worker on the Solitude Docks.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Makhel Abbas[/b] - Meant to be used in a scrapped civil war mission in the game. He is now a hunter who will roam around the Whiterun hold, hunting for wild animals. (If he doesn't do this, I will fix it in a future update.)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Muril[/b] - Meant to attack you with Estormo during the Staff of Magnus questline, but was removed. You may encounter him sometime in your travels... (Make sure you have some decent gear and weapons ;)..)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Mysterious Escaped Prisoner[/b] - Unused Nord escapee now repurposed into a mysterious Khajiit escapee who fled with a ring on his finger... He is a worshipper of Mephala, and is drawn to her again...\n<br />\n<br />[b]Rogen [/b]- Vampire Nord who might have been used as a carriage driver in Dawnguard. Now been implemented as a Vampire who fled during Harkon's Reign, as he threatened the throne and disagreed with Harkon's ways. After Harkon is defeated, he will come back to Castle Volkihar and live his life out there.[b]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[b]Urchin[/b] - Meant to be part of Dark Brotherhood Questline, but never made it into the game. He is now a prisoner in Riften Jail.\n<br />\n<br />CURRENTLY, these are the only NPCs I've implemented. In the future I will implement more, and hopefully make more complex uses for these NPCs in your game, and maybe even try to restore other content that has been missed by Cutting Room Floor related mods.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Installation Requirements[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Official Skyrim patch 1.9.32.0.8 or greater.\n<br />[*]Dragonborn, Dawnguard, HearthFires\n<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71214]Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch 3.0.2[/url]﻿ or greater. (Should run fine without it, however this patch is still strongly recommended)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Installation\n<br />[/u][/b][i]\n<br />Nexus Mod Manager\n<br />[/i]Use the \"Download with Manager\" button on the 'Files' section of this page. The installer should do the rest for you :).\n<br />Then make sure NMM has the mod activated.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Manual\n<br />[/i][color=#f1f1f1]Drop or extract the files and .esp into your 'Data' folder.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Uninstallation and Updating[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/u][color=#f1f1f1]Uninstall through a Mod Manager or simply deactivate the .esp from your load order and delete any related files.[/color]\n<br />[color=#f1f1f1]Just to be safe, do a clean save after uninstallation using [/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31724]'SKYRIM Save Cleaner'[/url][color=#f1f1f1]﻿ and AFTER THAT [/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52363/]'Save Game Script Cleaner'[/url][color=#f1f1f1]﻿. Instructions on how to use both are either on YouTube or on the respective mod pages.\n<br />\n<br />I suggest you do the same when updating.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Updates\n<br />[/u][/b]\n<br />[b]From  v0.4 onwards, every .esp will be cleaned with TESVEdit.[/b]\n<br />See Changelog for detailed update notes.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Future Plans[/i]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Add and repurpose more NPCs\n<br />[*]Reintroduce some items.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][u]Load Order\n<br />[/u][/b]\n<br />[/color]Load this mod as close to the top of your load order as possible since this mod involves restoring and editing vanilla content. (Even though they are very small changes, load it higher just to be safe.)\n<br />\n<br />Recommended to run [url=http://loot.github.io/]LOOT\n<br />\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[b][u]Compatibility and Recommended Mods\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b]This mod should be compatible with pretty much any other mod, except the ones which edit the NPCs implemented in this mod in ANY WAY. Below are mods that are recommended to use with this one and their compatibility.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47327/]Cutting Room Floor by Arthmoor[/url] - Compatible; It restores much more content into the game, including unused quests, NPCs, items, locations etc. I recommend you use this!\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/82128/]Open Civil War by simtam[/url]  - Compatible; Completely overhauls the Civil War questline, adding possibility to lose battles and other hidden mechanics that never made it into the vanilla game.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77027/]Opening Scene Overhaul by elderscrolliangamer[/url] - Compatible; Another great mod that overhauls the opening scene of the game with new unhidden dialogue and much more!\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74568/]Relationship Dialogue Overhaul by cloudedtruth[/url] - Compatible; Adds 1,000s of lines of hidden and original dialogue to all NPCs in Skyrim, also adds Terek.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38529/]Touring Carriages by DayDreamer[/url]﻿  - Compatible; Rideable carriages to different places in Skyrim, carriage riders use hidden dialogue to describe places while travelling.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/85540]BUVARP by AndrealphusVIII[/url]﻿ - Compatible; Gives purpose to NPCs who would be deleted by the game after their quest/usefulness is gone.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74164]Unused Whiterun Guards by kvatchcount[/url]﻿ - Compatible; Adds some unused Whiterun guards back into the game.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69399]College Guards and Saarthaal Miners and Terek by kvatchcount[/url] - Compatible; Quite similar to my mod, implements different NPCs into the game that were missed by CRF, and IS compatible with RDO (you can turn RDO's terek off in the MCM, thanks kvatchcount for the info). I have no plans to add these NPCs as you can just download this mod :). In the future I MAY, for those of you struggling with load order.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/89538]Domna and Rogen and Henrik and More by kvatchcount[/url] - INCOMPATIBLE; Edits many of the same npcs as my mod. This mod incorporates some NPCs with missions in the game. I haven't done this because I would like this mod to compatible with many others and I don't know how to do it. In a way this mod is more complex than mine, so if you would like these unused NPCs to be incorporated in some way into missions, then I'd recommend this one :).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Disclaimer\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b]This is my first attempt at modding, so if this mod is buggy, cut me some slack. As I become more experienced, I will update this or maybe someone else will get to it. On a separate note, I claim [b]NO RESPONSIBILITY[/b] if this mod ends up doing something crazy to your game (which it shouldn't). If the problem is on my end, I'll provide a fix in a future update, If it's on your end, I can't do anything about it, sorry.",
