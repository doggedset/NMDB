  "summary": "this just adds an unenchanted version of that nice slim golden nord amulet to the crafting table of the forge.",
  "descriptionHtml": "i noticed that with a lot of armor and clothing items (hoods are particularly bad here) the thick amulets seem to poke through causing very nasty clipping issues, and almost all of em are thick too.\r\n\r\ni just took the one that wasn\\'t all that thick, created a copy of it called \\\"Runed Golden Amulet\\\", and linked a hand crafted recipe to the jewelry section of the forge.\r\n\r\nyou need the advanced smithing perk, as well as 1 gold ingot, 1 pc. charcoal, 1 portion of bear claws... and you get two nice and thin gold amulets worth about 1500g a piece. not bad right? the amulets are unenchanted but fully enchantable. should be in the jewelry selection at a forge.\r\n\r\ninstallation: just drop the esp file into the data folder in the steam\\\\steam aps\\\\skyrim directory.\r\nand activate the esp, no new textures or anything, they are already used ingame. i just added a recipe to craft them.\r\n\r\nuninstallation: just delete the esp file.\r\ncan\\'t see any bugs, but you never know.",
