I will probably make a HF version where they are the same ingredients.\r<br />- Several of the meshes (ie. barrels, bowls) used in this mod are replacements from the mod Static Meshes Improvement Mod (SMIM).  This happened automatically when I archived, and I&#39;m not sure how to include the original ones instead, or if it&#39;s possible.  Credit to the author(s) for those meshes.\r<br />- [color=#ff7700][b]I will NOT be making compatibility versions for Realistic Needs & Diseases, or any other food mods[/b][/color], as I have no interest whatsoever in getting that mod myself, much less examining it in CK and making mine work with it.  If someone else would like to make a patch, you may do so, but credit me and link back to this mod.\r<br />\r<br />Please comment and rate if you like this mod ^_^ Thanks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#ffff66][size=+1][b]My other mods:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Anna NPCs 2.0+\r<br />Riverwood Cabin\r<br />Become A Bard Anduniel Expansion[/center]",
