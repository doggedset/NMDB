  "summary": "WIP- Adds the island of Artaeum into the game. Later versions will add quests and more buildings/NPCs.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome, to Artaeum.\r\nAs you may know, Artaeum was the island of the Psiijic order long ago before the island suddenly vanished. This mod adds Artaeum to the game. Right now, it is just an island with a few buildings, but I wanted to get this out there so people can expect it. \r\nNOTE: . If you want to visit Artaeum, go into the console and type in Coc ArtaeumExterior13\r\nThen you can roam around. Have some fun running around and stuff.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n__________\r\nA new island with 3 new npc. Adds a few buildings. \r\nHas an inn where you can rent a bed. I built the scripts from the ground up (it was hard). Partially works right now, I will definitely work on it.\r\nHas a trader named Jensen who sells \\\"potions, scrolls and arcane secrets\\\"\r\nHas a trainer near Jensen named Victun. He can train you to level 75 Destruction.\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\n__________\r\nYou can change your rooms with the inn, so you can switch from the half room to the whole combo room at anytime, but you still pay the fee.\r\n\r\nNext update will be on: Unknown, Finals has been really tough\r\n March 18, 2012\r\nNext update will include:\r\n__________\r\nVoice acting\r\nNew quests\r\nMany NPCs\r\nMany traders\r\nNew buildings and a way to get to Artaeum\r\nCredits: \r\n__________\r\nG-d for making the world and us.\r\nBethesda for making Skyrim and the CK\r\nMe for thinking of this idea.\r\nMy team for voice acting help. \r\n\r\n",
