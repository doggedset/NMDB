The weapon of Shadow.&#34;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Times New Roman][color=#1e84cc][size=6][b]STONEKEEP:\r<br />THE WEAPONS OF SHADOW\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/size][/color][/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />============\r<br />DESCRIPTION\r<br />============\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds the four Shadow weapons from the ol&#39; RPG Stonekeep, with some 2-handy versions for 2-handy people. They&#39;re a touch better damage-wise than Daedric weapons and are considerably lighter and faster as well.\r<br />\r<br />To get them, you&#39;ll need to venture to the Twilight Sepulcher. Outside in the stream you should find a strongbox, which contains a Piece of Shadow, a number of Shadow Fragments and a spell tome. The spell tome will allow you to conjure the Shadow Forge, with which you can make the Shadow Weapon of your choice. You only get one Shadow Piece initially, but the strongbox is set to respawn, so you may be able to get more if you return after 10-30 days. Once you make your chosen weapon you can temper it at a grindstone with a Shadow Fragment. The Shadow Weapons can be enchanted as well to your heart&#39;s content.\r<br />\r<br />The Shadow Weapons can also be reverted back into a Shadow Piece at the Shadow Forge, if you happen to change your mind and want to go for another weapon. All of the Shadow Weapons only use one Piece to make, so extra Pieces can be used to make other weapons.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]Dual Sheath Redux compatible&#33;[/color] Just download the &#34;DSR Meshes&#34; optional file, toss &#39;em in and run the patcher.\r<br />\r<br />=============\r<br />Known Issues\r<br />=============\r<br />\r<br />None at the mo\r<br />\r<br />===========\r<br />Installation\r<br />===========\r<br />\r<br />Just lob the .esp and .bsa files into yo&#39; Data folder and activate the mod through whatever mod organizer thingy you use.\r<br />\r<br />=============\r<br />Uninstallation\r<br />=============\r<br />\r<br />Delorte the .esp and .bsa from your Data folder. The mod does use a couple scripts but only with summoning the Shadow Forge, so it should be a clean pull if you choose to uninstall.\r<br />\r<br />===============\r<br />Special Thernks\r<br />===============\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda, for Skyrim (of course).\r<br />\r<br />Interplay, for creating Stonekeep (which I FINALLY beat after many years).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]LET IT BE KNOWN THIS MOD SHALL NOT BE COPIED AND PASTED ELSEWHERE WITHOUT PERMISSION OF THE AUTHOR (ME). DOING SO WITHOUT PERMISSION MAY RESULT IN FREQUENT RASHES, HEAD COLDS, ANTIDAEPHOBIA, WEIGHT GAIN, DEMONIC HARD DRIVE POSSESSION, BAD GAS, AND A SUDDEN LOVE FOR JUSTIN BIEBER.
