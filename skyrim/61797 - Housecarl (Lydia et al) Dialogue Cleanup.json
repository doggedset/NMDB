  "descriptionHtml": "Housecarl (Lydia et al) Dialogue Cleanup by ZHOOL\r<br />\r<br />With this mod housecarls will only give their spiels about thanes (I&#39;m a thane? What does that mean?) and housecarls (What does a housecarl do?) once, after which they will no longer clutter the dialogue window.\r<br />\r<br />V1 set two checkboxes in the master file that were supposed to make them offer each topic only once, but they&#39;d come back up occasionally when they had to be respawned.\r<br />V2 creates a hidden quest that is advanced by asking them about each topic and completed when they&#39;ve finished saying both, after which there is no chance the topics will arise again (for any housecarl). There may have been an easier way by fiddling with the base quest, but that quest also involves decorating the various houses and stuff and i didn&#39;t want to mess with it.\r<br />v2.1 tightened up the dialogue conditions to prevent random non-completion issue.\r<br />\r<br />if fsr the quest didn&#39;t complete for you (fixed in 2.1), open console and type (without quotes) &#34;completequest zhoolshutuplydiaquest&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: unpack the archive into your skyrim&#92;data folder (the .esp goes in &#92;data and the two .pex files go in &#92;data&#92;scripts), and activate using the data files option on the skyrim splash screen. Shouldn&#39;t conflict with anything unless it messes with the vanilla house-buying quest (housecarl character entries not affected).",
