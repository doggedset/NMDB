  "descriptionHtml": "-UPDATE- \r\nI apparently left some stuff out of the enchantment effect... my bad. I fixed it :) \r\nHopefully it works now.. Fingers crossed. Give me feed back please, I really appreciate it.\r\nI still have plans to add a quest a re-balance the staff.\r\n-UPDATE OVER-\r\n\r\nThis Mod Is A WIP/Beta and and may contain bugs, and or not work quite yet. Let me know if it doesn\\'t work, and Endorse if it does! It DOES REQUIRE the mod I am about to mention.\r\n\r\nThis mod aims to add a staff to the game which replicates the Meteor Storm Alduin uses. It is based of the mod: Spell Tome - Apocalypse v2 by Mass Carade. Here is a link to that mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10147\r\n\r\nThe staff is located in the Riverwood Trader. I do have some plans for this mod later on (A quest of Sorts, maybe a more balanced version of the staff.) So i need to know if it works. I cannot play Skyrim right now to test it out, but I can in a month or so, my game disk broke and I\\'m saving for a new one.\r\n\r\nNOTE- This is the second mod I have uploaded. I\\'m still trying to figure out the CK. If you have Ideas/Suggestions/ or just want to help please leave a comment or PM me. \r\nDOUBLE NOTE- here\\'s a link to my other mod:\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13301",
