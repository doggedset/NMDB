  "modName": "Dwarven Helmet - Open Faced Variation",
  "summary": "A variation of the open-faced dwarven helmet found in the Improved Closefaced Helmets Mod by navida1 found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15927",
  "descriptionHtml": "By popular request, here is the helmet found in the screenshots of the Dwemer Beards mod. This helmet was originally part of navida1\\'s \\'Improved Closefaced Helmets Mod\\' (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15927). In that mod, the helmet was worn by Argonians only. Now after some editing in Nifskope and the Creation Kit it can be worn by any human or elven race but note that male wood elves ears may clip a little at the tip. Khajiits can also wear the helmet but be warned that the ears clip through. With male khajiit it looks kind of cool actually, if you can stand it. Females can wear the helmet but some hairstyles might disappear entirely when equipped then reappear when unequipped. I noticed this with at least one default hair and a few apachii hairstyles.\r\n\r\nIf you want an argonian version, get the original Improved Close Faced Helmets mod. Since I made this helmet for personal use I won\\'t be doing fixes to make it fit anyone else\\'s character - be warned!\r\n\r\nYou should thank navida1 for allowing me to upload this and please check out the original Improved Closefaced Helmets here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15927.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n--------\r\nInstall this by placing the Data folder within your Skyrim directory as usual. The file structure is already in place for you.\r\n\r\nHow to Find in Game\r\n--------------------------\r\nThe open dwarven helmet is craftable at a forge with the same requirements as the normal dwarven helmet. You can also find a stockpile in a chest by following these instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Go to Deep Folk Crossing in the far west of Skyrim\r\n2. Open the container found on the bridge. It is named \\'Dwarven Armorial Chest\\'.\r\n3. PROFIT\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n--------\r\nThanks to navida1 for allowing me to upload an edited version his original meshes. You can find navida1\\'s mod \\'Improved Close Faced Helmets\\' here:\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15927\r\n\r\nUpdates\r\n----------\r\nNot likely haha\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n-----\r\n\r\n1. This helmet doesn\\'t look right on my character, Ogbulob the Grimheaver!\r\n\r\nThis helmet was resized in Nifskope to suit my male elven character. It wasn\\'t designed to fit every race although it does appear to be fine for all male races except the khajiit and the wood elf. Females might experience baldness issues under the helmet depending on their hairstyle.\r\n\r\n2. Will you make a version to suit the Mighty CC Muldragon of the Order of Draconii?\r\n\r\nNo. I edited the original mesh to suit my own character and only uploaded it because people requested it. The chances of me making alternative versions are slim to none, sorry.",
