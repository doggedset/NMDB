  "summary": "Rebalances and enhances the alchemy systems. \r\nImproves rare ingredients, potion\\'s recipes. \r\nRebalances common ingredient, potion\\'s price, some overpowered effect.\r\nI make much of balance, compatibility and simplicity to make this mod.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod rebalances and enhances the Alchemy systems and Food\\'s effects.\r\nAnd I got many original ideas from \\\"Phitt\\'s Alchemy and Food Overhaul\\\".\r\nSo this mod is similar to it (I didn\\'t use assets in it.)\r\n\r\n[size=6][color=aqua][b]==Features==[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=red][b][u]Alchemy[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=peru][b]1, Rebalanced prices of potions.[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nYou can become rich easily by making potions in vanilla. I decreased prices of potion that you make. I decreased the prices of some too expensive premade potions too, but most of them don\\'t become so inexpensive.\r\nAnd now custom potion\\'s prices don\\'t so much depend on kind of magic effects of the potions.\r\nThe prices depend on the number of effects of the potions, and on the Strength of the effects. \r\nAnd Alchemy Skill XP you get when make potions depend on potion\\'s price. So now you can\\'t gain a lot of skill XP by making very expensive potions. But because I rebalanced the leveling rate of Alchemy skill, you can gain some XP by making potions normally.\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=peru][b]2, Rarity of ingredients [/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nMost of ingredients already have rarity in Vanilla.(Common or Uncommon or Rare)\r\nThis rarity affects only how frequently merhants sell each ingredient in Vanilla.\r\nNow Rarity of Ingredients affect magnitude of ingredients\\' effects. You can make stronger potion if you use rare ingredients.\r\nIngredients are divided into 5 rarity.\r\n \r\n[b][color=Dodgerblue]Very common[/color][/b] (Magnitude of effects : -40%)\r\nPlants that can be harvested at over 600 places, and \\\"common\\\" in Vanilla. 9 ingredients are very common.\r\n\r\n[b][color=Dodgerblue]Common[/color][/b] (Magnitude of effects : -25%)\r\nMost of \\\"common\\\" ingredient in Vanilla. And \\\"uncommon\\\" plants that can be harvested at 400~600 places. 31 ingredients are common.\r\n\r\n[b][color=Dodgerblue]Uncommon[/color][/b] (Magnitude of effects : Â±0%)\r\nMost of \\\"uncommon\\\" ingredient in Vanilla. And \\\"rare\\\" plants that can be harvested at 200~400 places. 47 ingredients are uncommon.\r\n\r\n[b][color=Dodgerblue]Rare[/color][/b] (Magnitude of effects : +25%)\r\nMost of \\\"rare\\\" ingredient in Vanilla. And some ingredients that is hard to find. You can buy most of rare ingredients from merchants, but all rare ingredients are expensive (about 150~400 gold). 18 ingredients are rare.\r\n\r\n[b][color=Dodgerblue]Very rare[/color][/b] (Magnitude of effects : +40%)\r\nIngredients that can\\'t be bought and hard to find (even if you have some DLCs).  5 ingredients are very rare.\r\n\r\nThere are some ingredients that have weaker or stronger effects in vanilla.(e.g. Damage Health of Deathbell) \r\nSuch ingredients still have stronger effects than ingredients of same rarity. But I rebalanced ratio.\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=peru][b]3, Most of potions and poisons don\\'t work instantly[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nRestore Health, Magicka, Stamina potions have a duration of 5 seconds and don\\'t stack. (It has no meaning to use same Restore potions at the same time.)\r\nDamage Health, Magicka, Stamina potions have a duration of 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n\\\"Damage ~\\\" and \\\"Restore ~\\\" effects in vanilla (having no duration) are renamed \\\"Instant damage\\\" and \\\"Instant restore\\\".\r\nYou can make Instant resore potion (damage poison) from some ingredients.\r\nBut the ingredients are hard to be found and Instant potions are very weak.\r\nWhy the effects exist is to keep compatibility with other mods that add some ingredients.\r\nRestore and Damage effects of the ingredients added by mods become Instant Restore and instant Damage effects.\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=peru][b]4, The magnitude of ingredient effects and premade potion\\'s effect were rebalanced. (Includes ingredients of DLCs.)[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nI rebalanced all potions and ingredients?in skyrim and 3 DLCs(Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn)\r\nSo This mod is compatible with all DLCs. (Of course this mod doesn\\'t require DLC.)\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=peru][b]5, Added 5 rare effects.[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nAdded 5 new effects (3 potion and 2 poison). These effect are rare. Only 3 ingredients have each effect (If you have all DLCs). Mainly rare ingredients have these effects.\r\nTo add the new effects I deleted some effects that have low usefulness or potions of that are strong enough even if you use common ingredients.\r\nSo I think It won\\'t cause you any inconvenience.\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=peru][b]6, Enhanced Recipes.[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nYou can learn effect of 4~6 ingredients from one recipe and reading recipes automatically unlocks the ingredient effects. If you have DLC, you can learn some DLC\\'s ingredients effects from some recipes.\r\nbut recipe\\'s prices are more expensive. (about x8) \r\n\r\n[size=3][color=peru][b]7, Rebalanced Paralysis poisons.[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nI think paralysis posions that have long duration are too strong. So I rebalanced it.\r\nNow duration of paralysis poisons that you made doesn\\'t depend on you Alchemy skill.\r\nIt depends on rarity of [b]most common[/b] ingredients that you use.(common : 1 second , uncommon : 2 s , rare : 4 s)\r\nFor example, if you use common ingredient and rare one, the poison\\'s duration is 1s.\r\nIf you want to make \\\"4 seconds\\\" paralysis poison, you have to use two rare ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=red][b][u]Food[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nNow food\\'s effects will last longer(5minutes or 20 minutes) and are stronger than Vanilla. And cooked foods are stronger than raw foods. But now you can\\'t restore your health instantly.\r\nThe effects are devided into 4 groups.\r\n[b][color=Dodgerblue]Fortify HMS[/color][/b]\r\n\\\"Fortify Health\\\" , \\\"Fortify Magicka\\\" and \\\"Fortify Stamina\\\".\r\n[b][color=Dodgerblue]Regenerate HMS[/color][/b]\r\n\\\"Regenerate Health\\\" , \\\"Regenerate Stamina\\\" and \\\"Regenerate Magicka\\\".\r\n[b][color=Dodgerblue]Resistance[/color][/b]\r\nResist Fire, Resist Frost, Resist Shock, Resist Poison, Resist Magic and Resist Damage.\r\n[b][color=Dodgerblue]Fortify Skill[/color][/b]\r\nOther effects.\r\n\r\nYou can benefit from one effect in each group.(e.g. Forify Health + Resist Fire : OK , Fortify Health + Fortify Stamina : NG)\r\n\r\nA few new recipes were added.(Baked Potato, Soulhusk Extract, Grilled Leeks, Cooked Boar Meat)\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=red][b][u]Beverage (Alchohol)[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nNow beverage\\'s effects will last longer(10 minutes)and are stronger than Vanilla.\r\nEach beverage has a resistance effect and a fortify attribute effect. \r\nMost of them are stronger than food\\'s effects. But most of beverage have side effects.(Damage Magicka and Stamina Regen and Slow effect.)\r\nAnd if you drink too much alcohol, you will be not able to run.\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=red][b][u]Skooma[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nNow Skooma and Drugs that is similar to skooma have strong effects and the duration is long.(5 or 7 minutes)\r\nThey Fortify Health, Magicka, Stamina and spped. But you?become addict and it damage your Health, Magicka, Stamina and spped for dozens of hours.\r\nKhajiit have resistance to drugs, and can weaken damage effects. But weaken fortify effects too.\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=red][b][u]Perk[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nThis module changes Alchemy Perk tree. There are two version : normal ver. and Uncapper ver.\r\nUncapper ver. adds stronger perk ranks available at skill levels 100~300.(Requires Skyrim -Community- Uncapper)\r\n\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/35124-1-1372254933.png[/img]\r\nNow Alchemist Perk is weaker than Vanilla , but Benefactor, Physician and Poisoner Perk are stronger.\r\n\r\nAlchemist : 4 levels - 15% / 30% / 45% / 60%\r\n(Uncapper ver.: 8 lvls - 15% / 30% / 45% / 60% / 80% / 90% / 100% / 200%)\r\n\r\nBenefactor : 2 levels - 25% / 50%\r\n(Uncapper ver.: 4 lvls - 25% / 50% / 75% / 90%\r\n\r\nPhysician : Potions you mix that restore Health, Magicka or Stamina are 50% more powerful.(from 25%)\r\n\r\nPoisoner : 2 levels - 25% / 50%\r\n(Uncapper ver.: 4 lvls - 25% / 50% / 75% / 90%)\r\nNow Poisoner Perk affects Fear and Frenzy poisons.\r\n\r\nSnakeblood : Added 50% resistance to disease.\r\n(Uncapper ver.: 2 levels - 50% / 80%)\r\n\r\nPurity : Added a power that temporary disables Purity perk effect.(30 seconds)\r\nSometimes Purity perk lower the price of potions that you make, because this perk may remove some potion\\'s effect.\r\nSo I added the power that temporary disables Purity perk effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=6][color=aqua][b]==Recommended Mods==[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19]Unofficial Skyrim Patch[/url]\r\nUSKP fixes many bugs about alchemy and the others. I recommend to use.\r\n[size=3][color=red][b]Load USKP before my mod.[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1175]Skyrim -Community- Uncapper[/url]\r\nRequires SKSE. \r\nAlchemy Balanced Overhaul rebalances the leveling rate of alchemy skill.\r\nIf you don\\'t like the leveling rate that I rebalanced and you want to adjust the leveling rate by yourself, I recommend this mod.\r\n\r\n[size=6][color=aqua][b]==Installation==[/b][/color][/size]\r\nI recommend to install with NMM or Wrye Bash. (Download NMM and BAIN package.)\r\n\r\nInstall with NMM:\r\n1, Download with Manager.\r\n2, Select this mod in the Mods tab of NMM.\r\n3, Press the \\\"Activates the selected Mod\\\" button.\r\n4, Select features.\r\n\r\nInstall with Wrye Bash:\r\n1, Run Wrye Bash.\r\n2, Select Installer tab of Wrye Bash and then drag and drop my mod\\'s 7zip archive.\r\n3, Right-click and then select \\\"Wizard\\\".\r\n4, Select features.\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=red][b][u]Alchemy[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r\nIf you have all DLCs (Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn), select \\\"All DLC\\\".\r\nIf you have 0 or 1 or 2 DLCs, Select \\\"Some or no DLC\\\".\r\nThen choose ESPs for DLCs that you have.\r\nAlchOverhaul_DB.esp : Dragonborn patch\r\nAlchOverhaul_DG.esp : Dawnguard patch\r\nAlchOverhaul_HF.esp : Hearthfire patch\r\n\r\nIf you use \\'Skyrim -Community- Uncapper\\' select \\\"Uncapper\\\". \r\nAnd open SKSE_Elys_Uncapper.ini and make sure SkillExpGainMult of Alchemy are set 16~24.(I recommend 20)\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=red][b][u]Food[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r\nIf you have all DLCs (Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn), select \\\"All DLC\\\" version.\r\nIf you have 0 or 1 or 2 DLCs, Select \\\"No DLC\\\" version.\r\n\r\nIf you want to modify only food or beverage or skooma.\r\nSelect \\\"FoodOnly\\\" or \\\"Beverage\\\" or \\\"Skooma\\\"\r\n[size=5][color=aqua][b]==Compatibility==[/b][/color][/size]\r\nIncompatible with mods that change potions or ingredients.\r\nCompatible with mods that add new potions or new ingredients.\r\nCompatible with mods that change Alchemy\\'s Perk Tree.(If you don\\'t use \\\"Perk\\\" module of this mod.)\r\n\r\n--Credits--\r\nPhitt : I got many original ideas from \\\"Phitt\\'s Alchemy and Food Overhaul\\\"(rarity of ingredients, \\'recipe unlocks ingredient effects automatically\\', decreased prices of potions).\r\n\r\nMaybe my mod is simpler than \\\"Phitt\\'s Alchemy and Food Overhaul\\\".\r\nI removed no effects. (Just rebalanced.)\r\nI didn\\'t change kinds of ingredient\\'s effects so much.\r\nI didn\\'t touch Leveled list.",
