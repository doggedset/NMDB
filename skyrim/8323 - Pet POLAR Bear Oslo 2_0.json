  "descriptionHtml": "Bears are big and cool. Ever wanted a pet bear? Meet Oslo, a powerful bear companion with troll blood.\r\n\r\n--------\r\nNEWEST VERSION\r\nOslo Can now talk to the player, Just Talk to Him to tell him to Wait or Follow.\r\nVoice Acting done by real bears.\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLong dscrption\r\n\r\n\r\nOslo is an big friendly Polar bear. He will follow you wherever you go through doors, in towns, and even taking on dragons and being your big bear buddy. When he stands around sometimes he may nap at your feet.\r\n\r\nHe is stronger than other bears, and has the regenerative blood of trolls.\r\n\r\nVery useful companion. If he gets stuck or cant reach you (hes a big bear) simply wait.\r\n\r\nIf he dies(unlikely) he will eventually be reborn and will seek out his master.\r\n\r\nOnly thing lacking is a wait command, so if you tire of oslo simply turn off mod. When you turn on mod he will find you quickly.\r\n\r\nEnjoy! Comments welcome.",
