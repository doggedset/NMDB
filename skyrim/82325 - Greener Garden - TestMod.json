  "descriptionHtml": "Background\r<br />\r<br />Unfortunaly my computer hasn&#39;t enough power to actually play Skyrim. Voice and image aren&#39;t synchron and already the first 15 minutes need at least 20 in reality. I normally play on PS4 and I just got the Legendary Edition to start modding, but now I can&#39;t test my own mods myself. :(\r<br />So I hope for some brave tester and their feedback.\r<br />\r<br />What is this mod about?\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds multiple ingredients to be growable at your Hearthfire houses (including ingredients from Dawnguard and Dragonborn). Also there is a new merchant in the inn of Ivarstead (as a Khajiit she should be easy to find) for ingredients in general.\r<br />Hope this became something enjoyable.",
