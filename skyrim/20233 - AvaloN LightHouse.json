  "descriptionHtml": "AvaloN is a Dwemer mechanical lighthouse located way up in the northern frozen seas close to Winterhold and the Mages College . It is also equiped with everything an adventurer , warrior , hunter , mage would possibly need so that makes it perfect for Everyone . Plus it has a lot of storage and also has a nice view . This is my 3rd mod and it actually it took a while make mainly because i wanted it to be perfect . It is consisted of four rooms : bedroom , library - living room , armory with crafting facilities and a pool for meditation . The library also has enchanting - alchemy devices . At the top of the lighthouse there is a space with a chair for lookout and also there is where the fire pit is located . This mod took me a while to make , some times i wasnt satisfied with something , or i had very little free time . The whole experience was fun at some points mainly of the repeating CK crashes and bugs so it wasnt easy to make . I wont be uploading updates soon thats the final version for now . When the time comes and i can get more Modder Resources i will definetely make an update . I highly recommend using with this mod retexturing mods such as Sexy Villages And Towns ( they enhance the textures alot ) Paintings And Frames , Sexy Mannequin Replacers , Rug Texture Replacers , FishyTank , Palantir . All these Mods can be found here on Nexus . So enjoy . I really want to thank the Modding Comunity for their ideas and  support especially Dj20 , Reaper9111 and the rest . Please dont forget to comment and endorse if you like it . Dont say its boring to comment , if you dont i wont know what to change in the next update , so PLEASE write down in the comments your opinions . To install simply unpack the file with WinRar or 7zip in Computer/Programm Files/Steam/SteamApps/Skyrim/Data folder . The file contains only the Avalon.esp which works fine . So no worries about that . Also i want to note that you CAN NOT modify , change , present as your own work this file without my permission . For the last part you CANT present this as your own work . Enjoy",
