  "descriptionHtml": "It's time to get hunting in this catch-them-all mod! Druidism allows you to consume the remains of animals in order to gain a bit of their power! Basically, collect the remains of an animal, bring it to a cooking pot, and under misc find the recipe for their spirit. Then craft it, it will appear as a spell tome. Lastly, just use the spell tome and you will get a small but permanent passive buff related to your animal! You can collect them all, they all stack. They may be small, but they can quickly add up.\n<br />\n<br />There are a whopping 21 different animal spirits to collect!\n<br />\n<br />Have fun!\n<br />\n<br />Highly compatible and no DLC required!",
