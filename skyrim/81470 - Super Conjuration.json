  "descriptionHtml": "[center]This mod allows you to summon a bunch of powerful beings from Vanilla and Dawnguard. I&#39;ll be making the Dragonborn version to get Miraak and Ebony Warrior. You can use them as monsters or duel them. This allows you to battle Alduin again&#33; Dawnguard is required.\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t own the legendary edition, so if someone can help me create LE version plus console ports it would be fantastic&#33; Although I assume this mod will run on LE.\r<br />\r<br />Includes an optional utility lesser power &#34;[b]Super Conjuration[/b]&#34;, this greatly extends all summon duration&#39;s and gives you magicka so you can cast the spells if you are low level. This will allow you to summon super strong monsters and duel them properly without them phasing out. This applies to ALL conjurations so it works for vanilla and spells from other mods.\r<br />\r<br />Spells are added to leveled lists so buy them from Phinis Gestor and the college of Winterhold\r<br />\r<br />[b]All spells [/b]\r<br />[u]Summons:\r<br />[/u][b]Dragons[/b]- All dragons are ridable and have proper flying physics. Use bend will to ride, I shrunk some of them so they are easier to cast\r<br />Alduin- Will use stormcall\r<br />Red Dragon\r<br />Revered Dragon\r<br />Legendary Dragon\r<br />Dragonling\r<br />\r<br />[b]Others:\r<br />[/b]Knight-Paladin Gelebor\r<br />Arch Mage Savros Aren[url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Arch-Curate_Vyrthur]\r<br />[/url]Arch Curate Wyrthur\r<br />Werewolf\r<br />Vampire Lord (I can&#39;t get him to use blood magic)\r<br />Knight\r<br />Dawnguard Crossbowman\r<br />Horse\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\r<br />My mod only uses copies of existing assets, plus it uses no new scripts. So it should be compatible with everything. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Install\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Use Mod Organizer or Nexus Mod Manager\r<br />If manual place the .esp file into the data directoy\r<br />\r<br />[b]Uninstall\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Delete all of the spells of this mod from your spellbook (using console commands or another mod), then remove mod[/center]\r<br />\r<br />EDIT: Important, due to the fact that all the dragons use Durneviir&#39;s summoning script. If you have not yet learned all the soul tear shouts, summoning any of the dragons in this mod will cause &#34;them&#34; to teach you the words to Soul Tear even if you are not yet the dragonborn. Once all three words are learned the game continues as normal. As far I can tell, this won&#39;t trigger any problems down the line. And you can simply not unlock the soul tear shout for balance/immersion reasons.\r<br />[center][/center]",
