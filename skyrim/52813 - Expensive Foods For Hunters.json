  "summary": "This mod basically makes foods like venison more expensive, so that you can actually make a decent living off hunting, and fishing.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guys&#33; This is my first mod, so sorry if it&#39;s a bit simple :P\r<br />\r<br />I always hated how all those meats like venison were so cheap that there was really no point in hunting since you barely got ANY money for like 20 venison. This mod changes that. Making most/all animal drops *including hides and tusks* more expensive, it allows for quite a decent living for all of hunter/ranger characters out there. This mod requires nothing, as it is quite simple. There are 2 versions, Regular, and Over-powered, the regular gives you more gold than vanilla, but the OP gives you a LOT of gold per piece of meat. I would recommend it with a mod such as Ineed, making food aquirement much more interesting. NOTE: Making food more expensive to sell also makes it more expensive to buy. I have no way of changing this. If you enjoy it please endorse&#33; \r<br />\r<br />**NOTE** In the picture of the rabbit leg, it says it weighs 6.5 pounds. My mod does not do that, it is the result of a bug from another mod I am making. EFFH does nothing but change the values, it does NOT change the weights.\r<br />\r<br />PERMISSIONS: This is MY mod to put it simply. You can use it LPs, Reviews, and such but make sure you give a link to this page. Any reuploading on any other site is NOT ALLOWED EVER. PERIOD. DONE. END OF STORY. I only plan to post this on the Nexus, and possibly the Workshop later on, so dont ask.",
