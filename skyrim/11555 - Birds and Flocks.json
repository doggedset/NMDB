  "summary": "Adds many more flocks of birds and hawks to the environment, as well as more bats to dungeons.\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "(UPDATED DEC. 10, 2012.  SEE NOTES ON \\\"DIRTY MODS\\\" BELOW)\r\n\r\nThis mod will add in dozens and dozens more instances of birds that fly away when startled by either the player or another creature.  The effect is one that already exists in the game but was used very rarely, so I expanded its use. \r\n\r\nThis mod also adds in many more circling birds of prey along cliffs, tundras, forests, and mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nNow includes more bats in dungeons!\r\n\r\nJust download the plugin and place it in your \\\"data\\\" folder in Skyrim\\'s install directory.\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues or comments!  (Excluding \\\"dirty mod\\\" reports)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATTENTION: This version of Birds and Flocks is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH HEARTHFIRE.  If you are running Hearthfire, please download this version of Birds and Flocks instead:  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25280\r\n\r\nDisable and/or uninstall the original Birds and Flocks before installing this one.\r\n\r\nThe Hearthfire Edition is also available in the Optional section of the download page for Birds and Flocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT DETAILS REGARDING \\\"DIRTY MOD\\\" REPORTS:  (12/10/2012)\r\n\r\n\\\"Cleaned\\\" versions of Birds and Flocks are available for Skyrim and the Hearthfire expansion.  There is no particular advantage to downloading the cleaned versions, except a smaller file size.  I have reviewed the TES5edit reports for Birds and Flocks and found that the reports were all of minor changes that DO NOT affect stability or performance.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of reports regarded things like trigger zones in dungeons that trigger certain events or effects.  These trigger zones are massive, and are several times wider than the narrow path the player is traversing in the dungeon, which means there is no issue if the trigger zone gets moved slightly to the left or right. \r\n\r\nUnintended?  Yes.\r\n\r\nImportant?  Not so much.\r\n\r\nRemember that not everything that is reported by TES5edit is actually \\\"dirty,\\\" it may report intentional changes that are needed for mods to function.  \r\n\r\nIt is safe to automatically clean the Birds.esp and BirdsHF.esp if you have already downloaded them and want to do it.\r\n\r\nA few things to consider:  If you have never used the Creation Kit, or do not understand the reports that TES5edit generates when you analyze a plugin, or have not had provable issues with a mod, please think twice about reporting it to the mod author.\r\n\r\nIf you see that other users have already reported dirty edits in the comments of a mod, please think twice about reporting it.\r\n\r\nFURTHER COMMENTS REPORTING \\\"DIRTY EDITS\\\" FOR BIRDS AND FLOCKS WILL BE DISREGARDED.",
