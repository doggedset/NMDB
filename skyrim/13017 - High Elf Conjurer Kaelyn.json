  "modName": "High Elf Conjurer Kaelyn",
  "summary": "Female High Elf Companion Kaelyn",
  "descriptionHtml": "Kaelyn is a High Elf Conjurer that is currently resting at the Windpeak Inn of Dawnstar. She is an essential follower, will level as you do (up to a max of 80), can be married, and has a full compliment of conjuration spells she will use (spells that have a higher magicka cost will be used by her once she levels enough to use them). \r\n\r\nLike all of my other companion mods; Kaelyn will loiter around in the area that you dismiss her once you tell her you want to part ways (drop her as a companion). So if you can\\'t find her after you ask her to leave your service make sure to go back to where you left her. I set her AI up this way so that you can leave her in a convenient place and she won\\'t wonder off (you can also have her stay behind in one of your houses until you want her to tag along with you again). Remember that ALL of my companion mods have this feature.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This mod must have the following mod in order to work correctly:\r\n:::Apachii Sky Hair:::\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\nIf you have issues with hair colors turning dark when near light sources; download teh vanilla hair option on Apachii\\'s page and that should fix the issue.\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\nPlace the zip file\\'s contents into your Skyrim/data folder to install and be sure to activate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing. Ensure that the Apachii Sky Hair ESP and ESM are ABOVE Kaelyn\\'s data files in your load order (I\\'d recommend placeing Kaelyn\\'s files dead last in the load order so there are no conflicts).\r\n\r\nRecommended (but not required) mods to get her as she appears in the screen shots:\r\n\r\nCBBE V3 (standard body) and the hip texture compatability pack:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nBella\\'s Better Females version 3:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nCover Eyes (eyes 1 file):\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869\r\n\r\nKiller Keos Skimpy CBBE V2 Armor Set:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3654\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Blackie for his CM New Companions mod that includes a top-notch detailed tutorial on how to create Skyrim companions without the face discoloration bug. Get his mod and tutorial (contained in the mod) here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11669\r\n\r\nThe work around I found for the bug with Bella\\'s face mod (the bug involving women looking like they have faint beard stubble on their jawline and chin) is to use the standard Better Faces Version 3, and then apply the \\\"No Shine\\\" option available on her mod page.\r\n\r\nSpecial note: All of my future companions after Divada, Taja, Viin, and Kyia will be made using the Better Females by Bella mod. I switched to another mod set for faces previously due to a bug I couldn\\'t resolve (the issue with females having faint male beard stubble on their faces while using Bella\\'s). I have resolved that issue, so I\\'ll be going back to Bella\\'s for my projects from now on. You DO NOT have to switch to Bella\\'s if you use Envision faces and RANs Headmesh (what I used previously) OR if you use other face mods. All of my companions should work with other face/body mods and vanilla setups unless specifically mentioned in the description.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking at my work, and I hope you enjoy taking Kaelyn with you on your adventures.\r\n\r\nI recommend a manual install of this mod (read me included in the zip file). Install with Nexus Mod Manager at your own risk.\r\n\r\nThis mod was an experiment as I was learning how to use Apachii Sky Hair in the Creation Kit. If you\\'d like for me to keep Apachii hairs in the rotation as I create future companions feel free to leave a comment and let me know. Also do the same if you would prefer I not use them. Feedback helps determine the companions I create and upload to the Nexus, and feedback has played a big part in the mods I\\'ve released thus far (four of them have been requested concepts and most of the others have been results of talking with players and receiving ideas and feedback).",
