  "descriptionHtml": "Just a simple mod that allows you to cook some new foods from Humans Flesh and Human Hearts.  Thought it would go nice with the Dawnguard vampire storyline.  The foods are slightly more powerful due to the rarity of these components.\r\n\r\nIn the future I would like to add some new unique textures as well as more vampire focused foods, like a Blood Pudding.\r\n\r\nPlease inform me of any issues, this is my first mod for a while so I am a bit rusty.\r\n\r\nNote: I removed them from the vendor list so you have to craft them, no buying your man-steaks from the local innkeep.",
