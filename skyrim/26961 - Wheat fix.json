  "descriptionHtml": "[SIZE=5]No more floating harvested wheat[/SIZE]\r\n\r\nWhen you harvest a farm wheat in the game the remaining wheat stalk object will be badly positioned and floating on the ground. Look at the pics to immediately understand.\r\n\r\nThe bug was in a bad wheat mesh design. Original mesh has 2 models merged into one single mesh object (florawheat01.nif). My fix will solve (only) the 2nd model which was badly positioned on the Z axis. This solution have three advantages: vanilla and mods with correctly positioned unharvested wheat objects will look the same (= won\\'t look buried in the ground), but when harvested will finally look fine too and no more floating! Final advantage: fully compatible with any other mod since no cell has been edited.\r\nThere are no drawbacks or incompatibilities. It is the best solution.\r\n\r\nPlease report any \\\"strange\\\" problem, if you find one.\r\n\r\nWARNING (old, read below the EDIT):\r\nPlease, I deprecate this mod with USKP 1.2.4+.\r\nSince Unofficial Skyrim Patch 1.2.4 the same issue was addressed with a (uglier) workaround and all wheat objects in the game have been re-placed to look better when harvested (and uglier when non-harvested).\r\nUsing both USKP 1.2.4 + this mod makes harvested 3D model excessively buried in the ground. No apparent changes for the non-harvested model instead. Unfortunately this more elegant fix has been discarded by USKP authors in favor of an uglier workaround.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nSince v.1.1 is fully compatible with USKP 1.2.4+ as it simply reverts those unnecessary fixes (= undo fixes as it was in the vanilla game). No more USKP ugly workaround, and the haystacks will look perfect with all farm mods, both harvested and non harvested.\r\n\r\nNOW in BSA format (no more loose files). Please delete old data\\\\meshes\\\\plants\\\\florawheat01.nif.",
