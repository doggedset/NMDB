  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#B690DE][size=4][b]Noble Female Clothes[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />This mod is based on the gorgeous clothing texture by Karmoth.  See the original file here: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1393]Noble Female Clothes[/url]\r<br />\r<br />The original texture was a replacer for a mining outfit.  I turned it into new outfits that you can purchase at Radiant Raiments.  There&#39;s also a version with additional colors of sleeves, although personally I am a fan of the classic gray ones.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#B690DE][size=4][b]Notes[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />This outfit is [color=#B690DE]female only[/color]&#33;\r<br />\r<br />There are two versions of the outfit for each color.  The &#34;for Boots&#34; versions have no ankles, to prevent clipping issues when you&#39;re wearing it with tall boots.  The &#34;for Shoes&#34; versions have a longer pants leg.  Use whichever version you think looks best--both of them are for sale at Radiant Raiments.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#B690DE][size=4][b]Version History[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#B690DE]1.1[/color]\r<br />- Added versions with White, Red, Blue, Green, Lavender, and Sky Blue sleeves\r<br />\r<br />[color=#B690DE]1.0[/color]\r<br />- Converted textures into new outfits sold at Radiant Raiments\r<br />\r<br />[color=#B690DE][size=4][b]Installation Instructions:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Extract all files into Skyrim&#39;s Data folder (for me, that&#39;s under C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;Data). If you already have existing meshes and textures folders, click Yes or Yes to All when it prompts you whether you want to copy the files into them.\r<br />\r<br />Once you unpack the files, verify that the mod is activated by selecting &#34;Data Files&#34; from the loader screen, and ensuring that &#34;NobleFemaleClothes.esp&#34; is checked.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#B690DE][size=4][b]Credits[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Karmoth created the original texture.  What I did was convert the texture into something I could apply to the ground mesh, updated the meshes, and added them to the esp.  I also changed the sleeve colors to add more variety.",
