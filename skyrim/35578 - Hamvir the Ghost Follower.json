You will find this nice guy at Hamvir&#39;s Rest, a tomb located between Whiterun and Morthal. \r<br />\r<br />He carries a Drainblood Battleaxe and Bow, which I feel fit his theme and skills of a two-handed warrior, and has several ghostly perks, including Light Foot so he won&#39;t trigger pressure plates, Silence, Muffled Movement, and a ghost-only skill that will let him take only half damage from any attacks. He is also essential. I didn&#39;t check to see how it would look like if you gave him armor, but I figure there should be no problem. Do let me know how it goes&#33;\r<br />\r<br />His original voice type would not allow for him to become a follower, so I had to change it. He sounds like a regular person now, and I think it makes him livelier. (HEH GET IT?)\r<br />\r<br />To install, place the files in your &#39;SteamSteamAppsCommonSkyrimData&#39; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
