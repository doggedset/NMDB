Then a recently dumped magician saw him - and he took his anger out on poor Señor Pato, unknowingly sending him to the distant land of Skyrim, during the First Era. Where he met one of the three rival clans of Dwemer, who saw no worth in him in his current form, so they turned him into a mount. For centuries he was used as a war horse, but with the disappearance of the Dwemer, he no longer had a master.\r<br />[/SIZE]\r<br />[SIZE=3]   For thousands of years he wandered the cold, harsh land of Skyrim, but no one wanted to ride him into battle again, for they feared their butt would burn off (And with good reason). Then he heard of the Greybeard who had an amazing power (He didn&#39;t know what power though) and he set of for their HQ... and after decades of searching (He didn&#39;t have any directions, for he doesn&#39;t know how to speak) he found High Hrothgar&#33; He could return home&#33;&#33;&#33; But then, the Dragonborn found him, and he was forced to be a war horse once more. (But it&#39;s better than nothing of course).[/SIZE]\r<br />\r<br />[COLOR=#c00000][SIZE=6][U]Load Order[/U][/SIZE][/COLOR]\r<br />[U][COLOR=#c00000][/COLOR][/U] \r<br /> Put Senor Pato before any follower limit changer mods your using.\r<br />\r<br />[COLOR=#c00000][SIZE=6][U]Compatibility[/U][/SIZE][/COLOR]\r<br />[U][COLOR=#c00000][/COLOR][/U] \r<br /> Senor Pato is compatible with anything that doesn&#39;t change that precise area he&#39;s in, but he&#39;s not compatible with mods that kill all horses in existence.\r<br /> He IS compatible with Convenient Horses, though unless the author of that mod adds Senor Pato to follower options (Or let&#39;s me) your follower(s) will to be able to ride him.\r<br />\r<br />[COLOR=#c00000][SIZE=6][U]Thanks to:[/U][/SIZE][/COLOR]\r<br />[U][COLOR=#c00000][/COLOR][/U] \r<br />[SIZE=2][B]&gt;Razorpony, for the &#34;Dwemer Steam Horse Resource&#34;[/SIZE][/B]\r<br />&gt;Bethesda Game Studios, AWESOMENESS&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />&gt;Darkfox127 and BestInSLot, Creation Kit Tutorials.\r<br />&gt;My Dad, getting me a Computer and Skyrim  for Christmas.[line]\r<br />\r<br />[CENTER][COLOR=#c00000][SIZE=5][B][I][U]Please Endorse, Share, and Give Feedback&#33;[/U][/I][/B][/SIZE][/COLOR][/CENTER][line]\r<br />\r<br />[FONT=Arial Black][B][U][COLOR=#ffff00][SIZE=6]My Other Mods[/SIZE][/COLOR][/FONT][/B][/U]\r<br />[COLOR=#00b0f0][SIZE=5]Cute Mjoll the Lioness:[/SIZE][/COLOR]\r<br /> http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53046/?\r<br />\r<br /> ",
