  "summary": "Adds a standalone craftable armor based on Tsun&#39;s cuirass.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a craftable armor to the Daedric section (no perk needed). It&#39;s basically a standalone retexture of Tsun&#39;s armor and comes with a custom normalmap as well. I named it &#34;Unholy&#34; because I tried to make it as Oblivion-themed as possible. The cuirass itself has an armor rating resembling that of the Ebony Armor, but it weighs less.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is intended for those who are playing my Xivilai Race mod, as well as others. :)\r<br />\r<br />Bodies supported:\r<br />-Vanilla male (I had trouble pasting the armor piece to body replacers in NifSkope because they lacked the neck-node or something) Although it should work with most male body replacers since they all share almost the same UV-maps.\r<br />-UNP (might make a conversion for CBBE later on)\r<br />\r<br />Would be glad to hear some ideas as well as constructive critique in order to improve this mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Credit goes to:\r<br />-AlienSlof for the collar mesh and textures.\r<br />-GendunDrup for the letters on the bracelets.\r<br />-ReflexShooter for the UNP conversion of the Tsun armor.\r<br />I would also like to thank lagrie since I got inspired by their screenshot of their &#34;Daedric Barbarian/ Xivilai Armor&#34; that was sadly never finished due to crashing issues.\r<br />\r<br />Screenshots welcome&#33;",
