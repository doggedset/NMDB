  "descriptionHtml": "V2.5 Final UPLOADED:\r\n\r\n- I have tried hard to remove any tint from the image while trying to give a realistic look.\r\n- Reduced saturation a bit as i felt it was slightly over the top.\r\n- Tried to reduce the amount of red without bringing back the blue/green tint of vanilla (NOT EASY).\r\n- Image now gives cleaner, crisper and fresher look.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately i cannot work miracles, but ive done the best i can with what settings are available, i feel these latest settings give a more \\'realistic\\' look and is probably the best i can do. \r\n\r\nWhich is why this will be my final upload of these settings - also because the differences between the versions is becoming less each time, but when comparing these setting to previous uploads i felt this (v2.5) was better overall.\r\n\r\nI have put many hours into tweaking these settings, and if they give enjoyment for just one person, i will feel it has been worth it... ;)\r\n\r\nOver \\'n\\' out.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nV2.1 UPLOADED:\r\n\r\nTweaked again to give a more \\'natural\\' looking appearance with slightly less red, saturation and darker nights. Although nights still aren\\'t as dark as id like, but i guess you just have to compromise between brighter days and darker nights....\r\n\r\nMaybe i could have done a better job, but then i took an arrow in the knee, lol. But seriously, hope you like it as much as i do - feel free to leave feedback in the comments section ;)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nV2.0 UPLOADED:\r\n\r\nV2.0 to be used with RCRN 1.6\r\n\r\n- More vivid image (but not too much color)\r\n- Brighter days                                                       {  Than standard RCRN 1.6 settings.\r\n- Image is less cold\r\n\r\n- Just looks better overall... to me.\r\n\r\nAdded some screenshots... (i personaly think that it looks better in-game, not sure why)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nV1.1 UPLOADED:\r\n\r\nTweaked \\'slightly\\'...\r\n\r\n-  A little less saturation\r\n- \\'Slightly\\' darker nights\r\n- A little less redness to the image\r\n- A few other small tweaks i cant remember :)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAdded a few Before (vanilla) and After shots.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS IS JUST A FILE WITH MY SETTINGS FOR THE MOD \\'\\' Realistic Colors and Real Nights with HDR by aLaaa \\'\\' - YOU MUST HAVE THIS MOD FOR THIS SETTINGS FILE TO WORK! see bottom for link...\r\n\r\nAfter tweaking these settings for many hours, i have finally managed to come up with something i personaly am happy with. (user: aLaaa created the original file for his mod - i have just tweaked it)\r\n\r\nI set out to adjust the settings to make Skyrim look as beautiful and as realistic as i could without going overboard on anything. I have tried to remove the green/ blue cast that the default game has, and i believe i have.\r\n\r\nWith these settings \\'my\\' game now looks better than ever - everything seems to stand-out more and is crisper, cleaner and more realistic...\r\n\r\nTry it and see if you like it (making a back-up of your own file first). Simply copy to your main skyrim folder.\r\n\r\nNOTE: These settings were made on a calibrated Dell 2709w. If your screen is not calibrated correctly then it may not look as good to you. Should also mention that i play with in-game brightness set to the lowest setting. \r\n\r\nAlso i have disabled any image sharpening and AA within the file - to enable you will have to open the file with a text editor such as Notepad, then change the \\'0\\' to a \\'1\\' next to the sharpening and AA values near the top of the page... and then save. \r\n\r\nAgain these are MY personal settings, credit goes to \\'aLaaa\\' for creating the actual file and MOD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMods i am using in the above screens:-\r\n\r\nRealistic Colors and Real Nights with HDR - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1875\r\n\r\nLush Trees - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3385\r\nLush Grass - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3288\r\nSun and Cloud textures - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2616\r\nSkyrim Flora Overhaul - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=141\r\nRealistic Water Textures - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=711",
