  "descriptionHtml": "[i][b]\\\"To this day, those who walk the pine forest late at night tell tales of a weeping woman glimpsed between the trees. She carries a bloody axe, the stories say, and is terrifying to behold. \\\"[/b][/i]\r\n\r\nThose of you who\\'ve read the in-game books \\'The Woodcutter\\'s Wife\\' and \\'The Cabin in the Woods\\' will be familliar with the tale. This mod adds the titular spirit to the pine forests of Falkreath. Where exactly? Well, that would be telling now wouldn\\'t it. Suffice to say, keep an eye out when travelling along the road west of Lake Ilinalta. She is a tortured spirit who isn\\'t friendly.\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\nAdded creepy weeping.\r\nFixed her AI so she\\'ll no longer chase any random bunny that hops by.\r\nReduced her aggro radius so that you\\'ll have to get pretty close for her to turn hostile.\r\nShe now only appears between 8pm and 7am. She will reappear even if you\\'ve defeated her previously.\r\nShe now leaves no ash pile. This was done because otherwise she\\'d leave a new ash pile each time she was defeated.\r\nMoved her location so she\\'s closer the road west of Lake Ilinalta.\r\n\r\nInstallation: \r\nSimply extract into your Skyrim diectory. Or use Download with manager and let NMM do it.\r\n\r\nUninstallation: \r\nDelete Woodcutter\\'s Wife.esp and Woodcutters Wife.bsa, or let NMM do it.",
