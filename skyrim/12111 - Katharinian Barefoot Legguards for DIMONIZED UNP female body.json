  "descriptionHtml": "Katharinian Armor for DIMONIZED UNP female body\r\nVersion: 1.2\r\nAuthors: calyps & DamarStiehl \r\n\r\n1.2 Forsworn footwear is up. \r\n\r\n1.1 Fixed issue with calves disappearing with some armors. I (calyps) would like to apologize for not fixing this sooner. \r\n\r\nNEXT: Forsworn boots.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThe Katharinians were a small, all-female fighting unit that distinguished itself during the Great War. Followers of an obscure Imperial Saint, Katharina the Barefoot, they swore off footwear for their entire lives. Despite their heroism (or perhaps because of it), the Katharinians were annihilated during the Battle of the Red Ring. Their distinct leg armor became a curiosity that shows up every so often all over the former Imperial territories. During your travels, you met a blacksmith who had a light and a heavy versions of it in his collection, and he graciously taught you how to forge passable duplicates.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nPlace the ESPs and the \\\"Meshes\\\" folder into your Skyrim Data folder, and check the ESP.\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nUncheck and remove the ESPs and remove the following files from Data\\\\\\\\meshes\\\\armor\\\\imperial\\\\f folder:\r\n\r\nk_bootsheavy_0.nif\r\nk_bootsheavy_1.nif\r\nk_bootslight_0.nif\r\nk_bootslight_1.nif\r\n\r\nOBTAINING THE ARMOR PIECES:\r\n\r\nForge them at any forge. You will find them under the \\\"Imperial\\\" section. You will need Steel Smithing perk to forge the Heavy version.\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES:\r\n\r\n- When dropped on the ground, they look like regular Imperial boots and Imperial heavy boots.\r\n- When worn by male characters, they look like regular Imperial boots and Imperial heavy boots. THIS IS A FEMALE-ONLY ARMOR.",
