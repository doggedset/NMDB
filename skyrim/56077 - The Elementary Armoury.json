  "summary": "A Full armoury and crafting room with Lots of mannequins and storage&#33; (Needs Hearthfire)",
  "descriptionHtml": "The Elementary Armoury Is for Hearthfire DLC.\r<br />\r<br />TEA is a full armoury with every crafting table and plenty of storage.  There is also all standing stones and blessing stones so you can buff before you go out. It has over 20 mannequins for showing off your creations, a Smelter, weapon racks, a place for growing plants or herbs, and a bookshelf. Synergy.. all in one.. is the idea.  A Spell tomb can be found on the mages table in Dragonsreach in Whiterun.  This tomb teaches you a Teleport to Elementary Armoury.  You can Fast travel from inside of TEA whenever you are ready to head back out to your adventures.  This is my first mod and i hope you get some use out of it.",
