The summoning is permanent until the pet dies or you un-equip the ring/amulet. Re-equip the ring/amulet to re-summon the pet.\r\n* Use a scroll to summon a pet for one real-time hour.\r\n* You and your follower(s) can only have one summoned pet each. \r\n* When your follower wears a ring/amulet, the summoned pet will follow you, even if you tell your follower to wait. This also works when other NPCs equip the ring/amulet.\r\n* A summoned pet will have the same level as you, but does not advance with you. \r\n* All pets including foxes and cows will aid you in combat. They will only flee when heavily wounded. They have considerably more health than their wildlife counterparts, so they should last much longer in battle.\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Additional features of the \\\"immortal\\\" version:[/color]\r\n\r\n* All pets have over 30000 hitpoints, that\\'s more than any dragon has.\r\n* You can find all the items in the cellar under Anise\\'s Cabin, west of Riverwood. There are two new strongboxes on a table, one for the rings and one for the amulets.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Use only ONE version. When you have installed or updated the mod, all health values are still vanilla. You must advance a level and then re-summon the pet for the change to take effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Known Issues:[/color]\r\n\r\n* If your follower wears a ring/amulet, the summoned pet might duplicate after a while (unconfirmed). \r\n* Although you can wear both ring and amulet, only one pet will be summoned.\r\n* Sometimes the pets won\\'t follow when fast-travelling or entering/exiting buildings (re-summoning fixes this).\r\n* Sometimes the larger pets get stuck in narrow spaces, but they should teleport when you are too far away (not really tested yet).\r\n* There\\'s a Dremora shape slightly visible in the summoning effect (because the mod is based\r\n on the Summon Dremora spell).\r\n* The Sabrecat standing animation looks odd (no way for me to fix this).\r\n* Sometimes the Troll sits down and refuses to get up and move (he\\'s probably trolling you)\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Version history:[/color]\r\n\r\n1.6: added Cow, Elk, Cave Bear, Frost Troll and Horker, removed Wisp, increased health of all pets, adjusted body sizes, added items to loot lists. \r\n1.5a: fixed bug which made all NPCs merchants (i made a seperate mod from this quite useful incident: [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6802]NPC Bartering[/url])\r\n1.5: added Deer, Goat and Mudcrab, added optional version with essential pets\r\n1.4: replaced Large Spider with Troll, added summoning scrolls and new NPC who sells them\r\n1.3a: relocated the strongboxes from High Hrothgar to the cellar under Anise\\'s cabin\r\n1.3: added amulets, added Mammoth\r\n1.2: added more rings to the strongbox, pets level with the player, all pets follow player, foxes will fight\r\n1.1: added Fox, Snow Fox and Wisp, removed Horse\r\n1.0: initial release\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Installation:[/color]\r\n\r\n* Extract ONE of the esp files from the zip file to your Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\ folder\r\n* (optional) Locate the file C:\\\\Users\\\\{your user name}\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\SkyrimPrefs.ini. Open it and search for the [Launcher] section. Add this line: \\\"bEnableFileSelection=1\\\" (without quotes). Then start the Skyrim launcher, the previously greyed out \\\"Data Files\\\" option is now available and you can select the plugin(s) that you wanna use from the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Additional Info:[/color]\r\n\r\nIf you need more rings or amulets, open the console, click the strongbox, and enter [b]resetreference[/b]. This will respawn the items.\r\n\r\nAs of v1.2, it is possible to add a lot more pets by spawning them with a console command. These pets will follow you too, but they don\\'t have names.\r\n\r\nUse the following console commands to spawn them:\r\n\r\nhelp vvv 0\r\n(this will show the formID XXffffff. XX is the load order index of the mod)\r\n\r\nplayer.placeatme XXabbYYd #\r\n(XX is the load order index, YY is the pet index, # is the count)\r\n\r\nPet indexes are:\r\na0 = mammoth\r\na1 = sabrecat\r\na2 = snow sabrecat\r\na3 = wolf\r\na4 = ice wolf\r\na5 = snow bear\r\na6 = bear\r\na7 = frostbite spider\r\na8 = troll\r\na9 = chaurus\r\naa = chaurus reaper\r\nab = horker\r\nac = dog\r\nad = skeever\r\nae = fox\r\naf = snow fox\r\n10 = deer\r\n11 = goat\r\n12 = mudcrab\r\n13 = frost troll\r\n14 = werewolf (does not work properly, his death will result in a CTD)\r\n15 = elk\r\n16 = cave bear\r\n17 = cow\r\n\r\nUse this method at your own risk! Spawning too many pets may give unwanted results, so save your game before trying. If you spawn a lot of different pets at once, it may result in a fight between them, and other issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Legal Stuff:[/color]\r\n\r\nFeel free to use any assets of this mod in other mods, just give credit.\r\nThe merchant NPC was created with the help of Boopi!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
