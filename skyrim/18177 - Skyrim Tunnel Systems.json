  "summary": "Adds a tunnel system under whiterun",
  "descriptionHtml": "this mod adds a tunnel system under whiterun that can be used as a stealthy escape or enterance or just for your convenience. currently only breezehome, dragonsreach dungeon, and in the tunnel in the waterway at the city gates are connected to the tunnels, all leading to an exit that ends up behind honningbrew meadery, but you can enter here too. . .\r\n\r\nNOTE: for better immersion and common sense, you must have purchased breezehome to be able to access it from the tunnels or to access the tunnels from breezehome.\r\n\r\nI\\'m going to start adding tunnels to other cities and more content to them like clutter, loot, and such once work slows down a bit. If anyone has any ideas on how to make this mod even better, leave me a comment and i\\'ll get on it.",
