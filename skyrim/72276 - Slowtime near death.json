  "descriptionHtml": "Hello, \r<br />\r<br />this is a quick solution to a mod-request over at the forums. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Whenever you drop below 20% of your Health, there is a Slow-Time effect (like the one slow-time-shout does), as long as you are below 20% health. When you regain Health to get back over 20%, the effect will disappear. [/b]\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t worry about incompabilities, I did not change records, just added a few new. I did not use scripts, this is a magic buff.\r<br />\r<br />To install just use NMM or similar, then ingame open up console and type &#34;help perk_slowtime&#34; (without &#34; &#34;). This will show you a perk and its ID, looking something like XX00182C, where XX is the position in your loadorder. Then type &#34;player.addperk XX00182C&#34; (again without &#34; &#34;). Save your game and done. \r<br />\r<br />For uninstallation just open console and type &#34;player.removeperk xx00182C&#34;, save your game and delete esp. ",
