  "descriptionHtml": "Craft all the recipes that were left out by Bethesda. (Soon to be updated to include armor and weapons from Heathfire and Dawnguard.)\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\nI, and assuredly almost every member of this site, used one of the old mods that did the same that my mod does now, but they have been long since abandoned. I set out to make my own version. I could likely have simply contacted one of the old authors and added onto their mod, but I wanted to do it myself to gain experience. This is my first mod, but it is still a very useful mod. Hopefully you\\'ll like it.\r\n\r\nPS: This doesn\\'t yet include Hearthfire or Dawnguard items because I don\\'t have either DLC. I\\'m getting it this Christmas and I\\'ll update the mod accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mod do?\r\nThis mod just adds missing recipes in a lore friendly way. You can\\'t craft legendary artifacts, but you can craft many pieces of clothing, weapons, and armor that you could not before. Additionally, you will need to \\\"unlock\\\" guild faction armor in order to be able to craft it.\r\n\r\n[b]>Main File[/b]\r\nRecipes:\r\nAll (or almost all) clothes\r\nSilver Sword\r\nSilver GreatSword\r\nThieves Guild Armor\r\nThieves Guild Leader Armor\r\nCompanions Armor\r\nFalmer Armor and Weapons\r\nForsworn Armor and Weapons\r\nImperial Weapons and Missing Armor\r\nBlades Weapons and Armor\r\nNightingale Armor and Weapons\r\nHeadsman\\'s Axe and Clothes\r\nWorn Dark Brotherhood Armor\r\nGuard\\'s Armor\r\nScimitar\r\nFork\r\nKnife\r\nPickaxe\r\nAxe\r\nLockpicks\r\nForsworn Arrows\r\nFalmer Arrows\r\nNord Hero Arrows\r\n\r\nTempering:\r\nSilverSword\r\nSilverGreatsword\r\nStudded Imperial Armor\r\nHeadsman\\'s Axe and Clothes\r\nWorn Dark Brotherhood Armor\r\n\r\nSmall changes:\r\nImperial armor can only be made if you join the imperials\r\nStormcloak armor can only be made if you join the stormcloaks\r\nStudded armor was moved to leather\r\nExecutioner\\'s clothing has an armor rating\r\n\r\n[b]>Optional Arrow Smithing Plugin[/b]\r\nAdds arrow smithing for arrows that are already covered in Dawnguard.\r\n\r\nSome of the clothing pieces may not work with females, but that is caused by Bethesda, not me.\r\nAlso, if there is anything I missed (I had to have missed at least one article of clothing) please let me know in the comments.\r\n\r\nSPOILERS(How to unlock certain equipment):\r\nMost of these also require the steel smithing perk.\r\nThieves guild armor: Join the Thieves Guild\r\nThieves guild leader armor: Become leader of the Thieve\\'s Guild\r\nCompanion\\'s armor: Join the Circle\r\nFalmer armor and weapons: Dwarven smithing perk\r\nForsworn Armor and Weapons: Side with the Forsworn in their questline\r\nImperial Officer\\'s Helmet: Complete Rescue from Fort Kastav in the Imperial Legion civil war questline\r\nStormcloak Bear Armor: Complete The Battle for Fort Snowhawk in the Stormcloak civil war questline\r\nBlades gear: Kill Paarthurnax\r\nGuard\\'s Armor: Become thane of that hold\r\nDark Brotherhood: Join the Dark Brotherhood\r\nNightingale: Join the Nightingales\r\nNord Hero Arrows: Complete the Companions questline\r\n\r\nFeel free to cover this mod in a Youtube mod spotlight or something similar.\r\n\r\nAlso check out my other mod:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28649/][img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/28649-1-1356052783.png[/img][/url]\r\nIf you know how to resize this, let me know!",
