It is designed for people that\r\nlike to discover things on their own.\r\n\r\nI felt that Bethesda added cairns as a way of saying \\\"Hey, look over\r\nhere. There is something cool to do.\\\". This mod attempts to correct\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nThis mod is for people that like to use bShowCompass=0 and \r\nbShowQuestMarkers=0 in the INI file.\r\n\r\nNote: I am a hiker, I realize what cairns are used for in real life. However,\r\nvery early in the game, I found them leading right to cave entrances that\r\nI wouldn\\'t have discovered if I hadn\\'t seen the cairn. I don\\'twant the game\r\nleading me around by the nose, that is why I play with the compass \r\nturned off.\r\n\r\n",
