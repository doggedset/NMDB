  "descriptionHtml": "Vampire Castle ALPHA \r\n====================\r\n\r\nINFORMATION:\r\n============\r\nIncluded are 2 esps and several new exterior static meshes adapted from the Castle Dour meshes.\r\n\r\nVAMPIRECASTLE.esp adds a large Gothic Castle of the Undead roughly at -38, 35, near the Northeatern corner of the map, North of Northwatch Keep. It is VERY rough, I just set it up to make sure all the models work with properly with collision, etc. I have not yet created the interiors, but am working on a complete Vampire Castle mod.\r\n\r\nVAMPIRECASTLE_modresource.esp is intended for modders and just adds the new exterior static meshes to the construction set under \\'Architecture/VampireCastle\\', and makes no other changes to the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS:\r\n=============\r\nCopy the nif files into your Skyrim Data\\\\Meshes\\\\Architecture\\\\VampireCastle folder.\r\nCopy the esp files into your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUTION:\r\n========\r\nThe meshes do not yet have LOD files made for them, so they won\\'t be seen from a distance I guess. Collision seems to work very well thanks to NifUtils. Let me know if there are other bugs that I missed.\r\n\r\nAs with all mods, use at your own risk. I tried to make sure nothing in this mod would cause any problems or conflicts, but take no responsibility for any problems this mod may cause for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n========\r\nBethesda for making Skyrim\r\nSkyfox for NifUtils\r\nMacoron3 for updated NifUtils\r\nThe great \r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nZardalu\r\n\r\n",
