  "descriptionHtml": "First Mod so be Gentle :]\r\n\r\nFully summonable Crab followers. They last for 150,000 seconds, have 500+ health, and are essential. Their claws do 65+ damage so they are overpowered at low levels but high levels they do just about as much as an incinerate spell. There is a Large and a Small, I realized that in reality the large one is impractical for smaller dungeons so you have the smaller one which is a normal sized Giant MudCrab, the Big one is 2x the size of the average mudcrab. They both do the same damage so there is no difference between the two other than size. The run 2x faster than normal Crabs so they can catch enemies who run. Purchased from Farengar!\r\n\r\nPost any problems/Glitches below I will do my best to fix them ASAP\r\n\r\nRate what you think of the mod :]\r\n\r\nHave a fun time with it :D",
