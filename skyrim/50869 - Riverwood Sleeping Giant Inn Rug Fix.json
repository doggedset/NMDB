  "descriptionHtml": "Hi there,\r<br />\r<br />This is just a small 1Kb in size mod and all it does is translate the z position of the rug at the entrance of the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood slightly.\r<br />\r<br />I was using a conjunction of mods, one of which is the sands of time sleeping encounters mod, and i believe at some point one of the mods has brought the rug down to the collidable floor below. Which in the creation kit you can do by pressing F, causing Z-Fighting with the floor texture and the model texture. \r<br />\r<br />Just load this esp last and it will fix the position of the rug, and it is a totally safe as the tiny translation is the only thing contained in this esp file.",
