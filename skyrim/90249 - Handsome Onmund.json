  "summary": "This mod changes Onmunds hairstyle, fixes his chin and adds a little bit of facial hair.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I love that twink wizard Onmund but his gnarly chin and awful hair have bugged me to no end. But I also dislike how alot of mods that exist to change his face, change him TOO much for my taste. So I thought I would just make this for myself. All I really did was reduce his chin, change his hairstyle, and added a shaved beard look to him. Bethesda, you cant tell me that this tall lanky nord boy who studies magic all day doesn't look at least a little bit more disheveled than that!\n<br />\n<br />To install just extract and drop the esp in the data folder or just use nmm\n<br />\n<br />I use Shape Atlas for Men at https://www.vectorplexus.com/ (NSFW) and Fine Face Textures for SAM here on Nexus.",
