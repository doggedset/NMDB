  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=red][b]Yet Another Dark Brotherhood Initiate Mod[/b][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />There are quite a few of these replacers, no? Quite basically, this replaces the bland Nord assassin initiates with two of my own personal characters, a male Bosmer named Conor and a female Argonian named Climbs-Many-Trees. For the sake of simplicity, the voices remain the same.\r<br />\r<br />Conor is classed as a ranger rather then assassin and will use bows in combat over his dagger, while Climbs-Many-Trees is still classed as an assassin and will use either weapon. They are also called &#39;Initiate NAME&#39;, rather then the simple &#39;Dark Brotherhood Initiate&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />They have some fitting perks to enhance their combat (Overdraw and Bladesman) and some that increase their stealth (Light Foot and Muffled Movement). They both carry a random soul gem, a random poison, Ebony Bow with 50 arrows, Ebony Dagger and a Brotherhood Sword (unique katana that absorbs health).\r<br />\r<br />Please note that with the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9752/? ] Masters of Death replacer mod[/url], Conor&#39;s hood does not show but it is there with the vanilla armor. I do not know why this is happening and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s my mod or the armor&#39;s, but it&#39;s just something to be aware of.\r<br />\r<br />(If you wish to see other races or your own characters, please contact me).\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Installation[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Download and drop the file into your data folder. Place meshes and/or textures into the appropriately named folders. \r<br />Or just use the NMM. \r<br />To uninstall, just remove the file. \r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]====[b]Compatibility[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Compatible:[/i]\r<br />Anything and everything (except those listed below, of course).\r<br />\r<br />[i]Incompatible:[/i]\r<br />Any mod that replaces the Dark Brotherhood initiates. Conor is also included in my [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49075/? ] Forest Shack Mod [/url], but the two will not conflict. \r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Permissions and Credits[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />This mod is not to be uploaded anywhere but the Skyrim Nexus. Please report to me if you see this anywhere else.\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating a great game and letting us fiddle with it. \r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Thanks for reading and check my page for more mods&#33;[/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7065334/?tb=mods&pUp=1 ] [IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/2dryws3.png[/IMG][/url]",
