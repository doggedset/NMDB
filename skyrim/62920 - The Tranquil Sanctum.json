  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Trebuchet MS][color=#00ff00][u][size=6][b]Description[/b][/size]\r<br />[/u]   \r<br />   [size=4]The Tranquil Sanctum is an underground cavern home designed for those players who want a gorgeous, peaceful place where they can rest in between adventures. The underground hot spring provides a warm atmosphere to fend off the cold winter weather outside. This home provides plenty of room for followers, work stations, hangout areas, as well as some aesthetic statue gardens. There are several beds for followers and lots of lovely scenery.[/size]\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[u][size=5][b]Location[/b][/size]\r<br />[/u][size=3]East of Windstad Manor on the other side of the mountain (See screenshot for closer detail).[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][u][size=5][b]Details[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/u][size=4][b]Main Cavern:[/b]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*Work stations for crafting[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*Safe chests for storage[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*A pool with auto-undress scripting for npcs[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*A cozy flower garden[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*A kitchen and hangout area[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*Some nice statues[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*An underground spring[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Companion Bedroom:[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*9+ beds for followers[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*A fountain[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Personal Quarters:[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]*A large cavern with forest environment[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*Bedroom in &#34;green&#34; theme[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*A safe wardrobe for storage near the bed[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*Hangout area[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*Pool with auto-undress script for npcs[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*Throne area with sitting cushions for followers[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Armory:[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]*Mannequins[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*Display Cases [/size]\r<br />[size=3]*Safe chests for storage[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*Weapon racks[/size]\r<br />[size=3]*Mask Holders[/size]\r<br />WIP - Dragonborn mask holders, black book holders, special weapons/armor holders, dragon scroll holders.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5][b]Warning: I have not been able to fix the navmeshing bug which won&#39;t allow followers to enter the cells. You can add them in using the console commands, but until I can get help from an expert, this mod&#39;s updates will be on hold. Feel free to look at it yourself if you think you can fix it. If you are able to, I&#39;ll happily mention your name in appreciation.[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=5][b]Author&#39;s Note[/b][/size][/u]\r<br />   \r<br />   This is my first standalone house mod. I learned a lot of the ropes of the creation kit while working on this cavern. Overall, it&#39;s taken me about three weeks to get to this point. It is fully navmeshed and you shouldn&#39;t run into any problems with npcs getting stuck while they are in the cells. I debated on waiting on the release until I could figure out the scripting for the rest of the armory, but I decided to release it now. To be honest, I&#39;m a little burnt out, and the scripting is very tedious work. In any case, the home is fully functional. I have a tough skin if anyone would like to provide some constructive criticism, but every modder always appreciates compliments:) I am sure there will be some problems that I overlooked, and I will be happy to fix any issues that pop up if it is within my abilities. I might pick this up again in the future to modify it, but overall I am pretty satisfied with the end result. I set out to make a home that provided a nice getaway for the player, and The Tranquil Sanctum lives up to its name&#33; I hope you enjoy the atmosphere and the scenery. \r<br />[/font]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Unfortunately I&#39;m having trouble with followers not entering cells, the finalized version of my navmesh doesn&#39;t add green tirangles at the doors, instead the triangles are a solid turqoise/blue. So far I ahven&#39;t received any helpful solutions on my forum posts.",
