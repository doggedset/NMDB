A home called Ravenstone.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial]I designed this in mind for a Skyrim-like home on Solstheim, on an island due-west of Raven Rock's standing stone, whose NPC cast makes me feel at home; a true welcomed citizen.\n<br />This new player home comes with many features, but remains a simple establishment: \n<br />[size=2]- [color=#ff0000]Requires [/color]all 3 DLC's. \n<br />- Several weapon plaques and displays, 2 mannequins, Hearthfire's oven. \n<br />- A unique interior design heavily inspired and replicated from 'Legend of the Eagles Nest'. \n<br />- More bookshelves than your local library.\n<br />- A secret treasure alcove.\n<br />- Layout designed for mods which relocate NPC's. \n<br />- Custom Ravenstone banner.\n<br />- A heavily atmospheric design on the exterior, as is tradition.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />I may revisit this mod and update it with new designs and features; A dungeon might be applicable in the future.\n<br />I hope you all enjoy! \n<br />[/font][/size][/font][font=Arial][/font][/center]",
