  "summary": "A mod that adds a bound dagger spell to Enderal.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][u]\r<br />Description[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />I was disappointed when my shadowdancer never found any bound daggers, only to realize they were never added to Enderal. So I decided to take care of that.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds 5 new spells to the game. Mystic Dagger 1-5. \r<br />\r<br />I did my best to scale the damage with other comparable weapons and made it as seamless an addition as I could. \r<br />The daggers damage works with the Mystic Binding perk and should work just like they do in Skyrim. I also took the liberty of making sure the daggers themselves (not the summoning spell) were silent.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u]Installation\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/size]Just unzip the file and drop the esp and meshes folder in your Data folder.\r<br />It should work just fine with mod managers as well.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u]How to get them\r<br />[/u][/size]\r<br />I did not place the spell tome anywhere specific in the world, however I did add it to the leveled lists so it should spawn in locations where you might find other bound weapons (ie: magic vendors, loot, etc). \r<br />\r<br />If you can&#39;t wait to find the spell naturally in the world, you can type:\r<br />help &#34;Mystic Dagger&#34; 4\r<br />and you will see the 5 spells. Then type:\r<br />player.addspell [ID]\r<br />with the actual ID of the spell you want replacing [ID].\r<br />\r<br />As far as credit goes, anyone is more or less free to do whatever they want with the mod. And if sureai wants to make this obsolete and just incorporate it into Enderal I&#39;d be thrilled :)",
