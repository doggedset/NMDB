I&#39;d now like to help Christian movie makers by providing Actors and Sets.\r<br />\r<br />   If your Christian productions are good and/or reflect the Gospel well, I&#39;d also like to post them on this page, so please send me your links.\r<br />\r<br />   -----------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />     If this mod and the information included is helpful to you, let me know and if you have any suggestions as to other things that could add to this concept, please let me know.\r<br />   -----------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[size=3]   The Files that I [url=#]plan[/url] to be posting are:[/size]\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />   ACTORS:\r<br />   (this file includes over 50 Actors for the [url=#]death[/url] burial and resurrection of Jesus)\r<br />   [[[The mod will probably not be [url=#]finished[/url] at the first posting, I still have work to do.]]]\r<br />\r<br />      The following mods were used to design some of the costumes:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51682/?]      Ashara Imperial Outfit - UNP - 7B - Sundracon by SydneyB[/url]\r<br />      [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32988/?]Historical Revival - The Roman Era by Jedo Dre and the team[/url]\r<br />      [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43293/?]Ghosu - Helmets _ Bone Shield and Tribal Staff by Ghosu[/url]\r<br />      [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3733/?]JoO Jedi Robe by JackoO[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16886/?]      Friendly Guard Helmets by FurArmor[/url]\r<br />\r<br />   [[I wanted to Thank RGMage2 again for teaching me how to make the Crown of Thorns.]]\r<br />\r<br />   SETS:\r<br />   (this file will include Sets for the death burial and resurrection of Jesus)\r<br />   [[[I am not very good at designing sets. If anyone wishes to help, I&#39;d rather just link to your mod, otherwise this will take longer.]]]\r<br />\r<br />-------------------------------------\r<br />[size=3]   WHAT I STILL NEED:[/size]\r<br />-------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />   A Crucifixion Animation:\r<br />   \r<br />   All that I need is the lower animation of the DA02_BoethiahPostIdle.hkx combined with the upper animation of the MT_Shackled_01.hkx\r<br />\r<br />   Understand that Roman Crucifixion was not done like a classic Catholic Crucifix.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/59591-5-1419966029.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />   There were no ropes to hold Jesus&#39; arms and no stand for his feet to rest on. He was nailed through the bones between His wrist and palm and through the side of his foot, where it is also the heel.\r<br />\r<br />   “And I will put enmity between thee and the [url=#]woman[/url], and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” -Genesis 3:15\r<br />\r<br />   “For [url=#]dogs[/url] have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.” -Psalm 22:16\r<br />      \r<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[size=3]   How to use this Mod: (Installation)[/size]\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />   First, put the .ESP, .BLS, and .BSA files in your Data folder (should be “Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;Data” or something like that).\r<br />\r<br />   Next, I built this mod so that it will not interfere with anything in your game.\r<br />\r<br />   Everything in the mod starts with “000Actor” in the Creation Kit [None of the Actors are at a location in Skyrim.]\r<br />\r<br />   The way that you get the Actors into the [url=#]game[/url] is through the console.\r<br />\r<br />   So bring up your console (usually type “~”).\r<br />   Next type “help actor” and hit “Enter”.\r<br />   At this point you should see a [url=#]complete[/url] list of all the NPC actors, (there names all begin with “Actor”). You probably will need to scroll up and down with “Pg Up” & “Pg Dn” keys.\r<br />   When you find the NPC that you want to use as your actor, type “player.placeatme &lt;id number&gt;” (followed by a number if you want more than 1) and hit “Enter”.\r<br />   The actor will appear, (probably behind you). Repeat the process again until you have all the actors you want and then hit “~” again to turn off the console.\r<br />   Each of the actors is set up to be a follower so it should be easier to place them where you want. :)\r<br />\r<br />   (UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhall is highly recommended as you can only have 1 actor at a time if you do not use it.)\r<br />\r<br />   Uninstall is the same as Install, you just delete the .ESP, .BLS, and .BSA files.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[size=3]   Mods for Movie Making and Directing Actors:\r<br />[/size]------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56857/?]Skyrim Video Making Guide by ndh[/url](Lots of good tips & mods)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10870/?]Puppeteer Master by JohnB[/url](character animation tool)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10431/?]Directors Tools by Artisanix[/url](change weather, add effects and animations to characters, and much more)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36047/?]Alternate Actors by Iceburg[/url](allows you to switch your PC for any NPC in game and edit them)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14037/?]UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhall by Original – fLokii – Recent updates - Vamyan[/url](makes it possible to have more followers)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57589/?]Mixed Unit Tactics by flexcreator[/url](allows you to direct groups of people)\r<br />\r<br />[b]This is for majorly dedicated movie makers:\r<br />[/b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9718/?]3D Vision Complete Compatibility Project by chizow with HeliX Mod[/url](maybe this could be used for filming in 3D, I don&#39;t know)\r<br />\r<br />A Skyrim Modding Tutorial:\r<br />[url=https://www.academia.edu/10887563/Modding_Skyrim]Modding Skyrim[/url]\r<br />\r<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[size=3]   Helpful Console Commands for Movie Makers:\r<br />[/size]-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />   tfc - toggle floating camera on/off (i.e. disconnect camera from your character)\r<br />   sucsm &lt;number&gt; speed of free – flying camera Default 10\r<br />   sgtm &lt;number&gt; world speed Default 20 (20 minutes per minute)\r<br />   showracemenu - for editing your characters\r<br />   tm – toggle menu (HUD) on/off (note console commands and menus must be done blind as long as this is on)\r<br /> tc - toggle camera, for filming from different actors\r<br />   animcam – reset camera position F to lock & unlock\r<br />\r<br />-------------------------------------------\r<br />[size=3]   My Youtube Channels:[/size]\r<br />-------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />If you are [url=#]interested[/url], I also have a couple of Youtube channels that may inspire you further:\r<br />\r<br />   [url=http://www.youtube.com/user/SCWatchman]SCWatchman[/url]\r<br />\r<br />   [url=http://www.youtube.com/user/FHProdutions]FHProdutions[/url]\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------\r<br />[size=3]   Final Note:[/size]\r<br />--------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Finally, may God Bless, Inspire, and Guide your efforts to preach the Gospel via the instrument of film.\r<br />\r<br />Love IN Jesus,\r<br />-stormshallow, [b]SCWatchman\r<br />[/b]",
