The mod also adds an NPC called Edward, he is located in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. I have also forgot to mention, there&#39;s books in the village I added. Under the Skyforge there&#39;s a place called The Underforge, there&#39;s a book in there. You need to be a werewolf (not in werewolf form) to enter it. Also you need to have completed the Companion quests to enter.",
