  "descriptionHtml": "1) You\\'ll also need a program/website for transcoding mp3 to wav if\r\nyou need to do that step.\r\n\r\n2) Extract it to your desktop, and notice it\\'s got a folder in there\r\ncalled converting and one labeled Skyrim - Sounds. The converting \r\nfolder is where you put the wav files you would like turned into xwm\r\nformat(or vice-versa)- Just hold off moving songs for now. \r\nThe Skyrim - Sounds folder is where you will extract \r\nSkyrim - Sounds.bsa. Let\\'s do that first... \r\n\r\n...but not without making a back-up copy of the original \r\nSkyrim - Sounds.bsa, so find your install folder:\r\n..\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\\\\Data (might be in steam/maybe in \r\nProgram files) and make a copy of Skyrim - Sounds.bsa in a safe spot.\r\n\r\n3) Open up the BSAUnpackerMW.exe or BSAUnpack.exe and hit open.\r\n\r\n4) Find your install directory again and open the data folder.\r\nIn the data folder you\\'ll see Skyrim - Sounds.bsa. Open it.\r\n\r\n5) Extract all to the Skyrim - Sounds folder we made earlier.\r\nWelcome to your new clusterf0ok... Get familiar. \r\n\r\n6) Now if you\\'d like to hear what file you\\'re replacing put it in the\r\nconverting folder and double click the xwm to wav bat file, then give\r\nit a sec and open your new wav file and enjoy. \r\n...Now you see the light at the end of the tunnel a bit...\r\n\r\nFun part - yes that\\'s dry sarcasm.\r\n\r\n7) find a song to replace that with, and get it into wav format.\r\nThere\\'s even a website that will do that for you, g0ogle it. \r\n\r\n8) Put the wav file in the converting folder, and doubleclick the \r\nwav to xwm .bat file. give it a sec - especially if doing multiple \r\nfiles at once. \r\n\r\n9) Rename your new xwm file the samme as the one you want to replace\r\nthen move it to the corresponding folder in the Skyrim - Sounds folder.\r\n\r\n10) Do this until you have all the songs done that you want to do.\r\nNote that some of these are sound effects, so careful. Then...\r\n\r\n11) Open up the BSAopt you need and put your game to Skyrim, \r\ncompression to none, and remove all the checkmarks in the settings \r\nmenu.\r\n\r\n12) Hit browse UP TOP, select your Skyrim - Sounds folder and hit the \r\nUse this folder button. now give it a minute.\r\n\r\n13) Down bottom, type \r\nC:\\\\Users\\\\urusernamehere\\\\desktop\\\\Skyrim - Sounds.bsa and hit convert. \r\nFire up a smoke and get ready!\r\n\r\n14) Move the new .bsa from your desktop top your \r\n...\\\\elder scrolls v skyrim\\\\data folder and overwrite the current bsa.\r\n\r\n15) Start the game, try it out! Tell me the bugs! I\\'ve noticed some \r\nbattle music not working so lemme know if you have any help on this.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that It\\'s silent for about 30 seconds when the game \r\nfirst starts up, but then, I\\'m jammin XD\r\n",
