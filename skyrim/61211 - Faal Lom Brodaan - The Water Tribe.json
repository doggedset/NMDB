While sailing to Tamriel, a storm threw their ship off course, and another destroyed the ship entirely, killing many of the passengers. \r<br />\r<br />The survivors drifted to an island northeast of what became Winterhold. There, they met the ancestors of the Nords--the Atmorans. The Atmorans were initially hostile towards the Redguard refugees and waged battle for years, until both groups were nearly wiped out by a single dragon. \r<br />\r<br />Neither group could defeat the dragon, losing more men with each encounter. A Redguard monk named Dejir and an Atmoran shaman named Agnora, both deeply fascinated by Nirn&#39;s twin moons, had an epiphany while looking towards the horizon. They noticed how the tide changed depending on the position of the moons and tried to replicate the effect with their limited knowledge of Alteration magic. \r<br />\r<br />After much trial and error and even more lives lost to the dragon, The monk and shaman were able to form a temporary truce between the Redguard settlers and Atmoran nomads. Soon afterwards, they taught what they had created to both groups. Days later, the dragon returned at midnight during both full moon phases. Little did the dragon know that each and every person living on the island had learned water magic to some degree, a few even learning ice magic. With a single combined burst of magic from all villagers, the dragon was killed. Her bones were planted into the snow in the shape of the moon as a reminder of the villagers&#39; victory. With their people spread thin throughout the island, the villagers soon realized that if they wanted to survive and thrive, they should work together. Tossing aside their petty differences and realizing that in times of strife, they&#39;re not so different after all, a strong bond was made between both groups, and soon they donned the new name--Lom Brodaan.\r<br />\r<br />Centuries later, a seemingly peaceful group of Orcs landed on the island. Little did the Lom Brodaan know that all of these Orcs were convicted murderers who had escaped prison.\r<br />The Lom Brodaan welcomed them with open arms, giving them supplies and teaching them about Water magic, but after many of the Lom Brodaan refused to accept Malacath as their god, the Orcs declared war. Using their catapults, sheer brute strength, and newfound knowledge of Water magic, the Orcs destroyed the village and killed all Lom Brodaan who could not escape in time. Korra, a single descendant of Dejir and Agnora, named after her grandmother, was able to conjure a barrier long enough for a number of Lom Brodaan to escape the slaughter. Exhausted, the descendant was captured, tortured, then killed with a single arrow to the heart. Few people in Skyrim know what happened to the remaining Lom Brodaan or the Orcs who attacked the village. Legend says that to this day, the remaining Lom Brodaan yearn for revenge against the Orismer.\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][size=6][u][b][size=6][u][color=#1e84cc]/[/color][color=#ff7700]&#33;[/color][color=#1e84cc]&#92; [/color][/u][/size][/b][color=#1e84cc]&#34;SIDE QUEST&#34; /[/color][color=#ff7700]&#33;[/color][color=#1e84cc]&#92;\r<br />\r<br />[/color][/u][/size][/b]To begin your relatively short journey for power, use the Abandoned Canoe to reach The Abandoned Village just northeast of Winterhold.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/rBGhl5Gl.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700]IF THE CANOE DOES NOT TAKE YOU TO THE ISLAND, OPEN YOUR SKYRIM.INI AND ADD THIS LINE TO THE BOTTOM OF [/color][color=#ff7700][[/color]General[color=#ff7700]] [/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]bBorderRegionsEnabled=0[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700]OR IF THE LINE IS ALREADY THERE, CHANGE THE 1 TO 0.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]In order to unlock all of the shrines added by this mod, you have to be the Water Tribe race.
