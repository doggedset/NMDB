So he could be a \\\"whole time\\\" companion.\r\nInspired in Azog from the Hobbit movie, he has greater tall than average, but that does not makes any mess or bug as far as i know (dungeon tested)\r\n\r\n_Located at Falkreath main door entrance\r\n\r\nHope you have a good time, this mod is a request from the original mod where he belongs(as a final boss, not companion) [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28522]The Uruk hai Wars[/url]\r\n\r\n*Credits to Bethesda for making the best game ever\r\n*Credits to Nexus Site for having such a strong buil community",
