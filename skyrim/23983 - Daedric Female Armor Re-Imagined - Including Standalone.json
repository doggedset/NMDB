  "descriptionHtml": "***Update***\r\nFixed the missing .esp issue in the archives. please re-download\r\nSorry about that. :(\r\n\r\n*** Update***\r\nI added a standalone version of the armour as requested.\r\nTheir are now also two standalone variants.\r\n\r\nBoth include:\r\nDaedric Artus Corium ( tight leather/skin clothing)\r\nDaedric Gages (Gloves/Gauntlets)\r\nDaedric Hessians (Boots)\r\n\r\nI have given them very slightly lower stats than vanilla Daedric (just random numbers so don\\'t ask \\\"Is it better than \\'xxxxx\\' armor?\\\" because I didn\\'t check) and made them \\\"Light\\\" armour, I also changed the recipes slightly to reflect the fact that they are more skin/leather/hide, with less \\\"metal\\\" than the default Daedric. Hopefully that will (somewhat) appease the \\\"Realism Police\\\"\r\n\r\n*** Warning*** *** Warning*** *** Warning*** *** Warning***\r\n\r\nThere are two versions - the \\\"Original\\\" version uses vanilla emissive colours (pink!) and points to the original \\\"ore_ebony_e\\\" cubemap, which has a purplish tinge to it, so If you are using one of the \\\"Brighter Ore Vein\\\" mods it WILL make your armor glow VERY brightly!\r\n\r\nThe second \\\"Blood\\\" version uses the same emissive colours as my original mod and points to the \\\"bloodshinybright\\\" cubemap, hence the red glow effect. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe original version of this armor was included in my \\\"Avalon\\\" armor compilation, however after discovering the astounding work done by MAK07 found here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13004\r\nI was able to revisit this armor and optimize it.\r\n\r\nAfter posting a pic of this armor with my Skirtless Male Daedric Armor, several people have asked me to upload it, so here it is.\r\n\r\nBasically this uses Female Daedric armor as a base and i added/created a \\\"bodysuit\\\" to go with it instead of just a pair of panties. I\\'m a bit wired in that I don\\'t like non symmetrical attachments on armor, so I got rid of the single thigh plate, but I liked the look of the leg chain, so I kept that.\r\n\r\nI have changed the \\\"glow\\\" effects on the armor from their default purple/pink to a red/blood red version, so this armor won\\'t match the inventory versions (unless you\\'ve also installed my male armor) and it won\\'t match the glow on Daedric weapons.\r\n\r\nThe boots also come from MAK07\\'s mod.\r\n\r\nThese SHOULD work with any Daedric Armor retex, so long as it doesn\\'t change the vanilla UV layout.\r\n\r\nAs always PLEASE let me know if you have any issues, queries, suggestions and I\\'ll try and action them as soon as I can.\r\n\r\nThe SS are modeled beautifully by my Lydia, who\\'s lovely, curvy, 100% weight slider form, fills out the mesh nicely, However Serana (a slightly leaner 40% weight slider) seems to know when you use the console and type \\\"tfc\\\" and refused to stand still long enough to have her butt photographed, she did however pose for a couple of frontal shots and I like the effect of the glow on the armor matching her eyes.\r\n\r\nCredits/Thanks/Kudos to:\r\nMAK07 Remodeled Armor CBBEv3M http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13004\r\nBugthesda\r\nThe Niftools Team\r\nPaint.net\r\nThe Nexus for letting us run free with our imaginations",
