  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first attempt at modding. You have my absolute and utter permission to fix it up, add more to it, share with others. All I ask for is credit. \r<br />\r<br />-Description- \r<br />This mod aims to add a quick, reliable, and easy to find player house in Riften. If you go to Beggar&#39;s Row you&#39;ll find it down a formerly blocked off tunnel. Inside is a bed, an enchanting table, an alchemy workstation, and a non-respawning chest. \r<br />\r<br />-Compatibility- \r<br />This mod doesn&#39;t affect the rest of Riften in any way, shape, or form. It only affects the interior of Beggar&#39;s Row.",
