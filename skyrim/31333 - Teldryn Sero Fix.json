  "descriptionHtml": "Removes the annoying outfit from Teldryn Sero, the merc in the Retching Netch - you can remove his hood and basically decide what he wears.\r\n\r\nREQUIRES DRAGONBORN\r\n\r\nI found it so horribly annoying that Bethesda decides what our followers wear and not us. I liked this guy very much ever since I first met him, new voice actor and everything. How he comments on stuff makes him really special and not  just another mindless drone chasing up on your behind. \r\n\r\nAnyway, just extract to Data or use the manager (not sure if that is gonna sort it out, though; this being my first mod I dont know if the manager requires any special treatment).\r\n\r\nIf this helps you, leave a comment. Its always nice :)\r\n\r\n0.2 - original face, no outfit, enjoy",
