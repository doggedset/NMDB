  "summary": "Magnus Robes, clothes intended for the mages who want some really pimping robes instead of the rather tame ones in vanilla. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a none-replacer retexture version of the Dark Brotherhood Robes. More specifically, it adds one set of robes and a hood fitted for all races, gender and size, and those clothes are offered in 2 favors: regular and \\\"Powered\\\". The regular version is created without any enchantments, to let you enchant it however you see fit, while the \\\"Powered\\\" has enchantments chosen by me.\r\n\r\nThe clothes are not found anywhere, but can be crafted by anyone at any smelter. No perks requirement, not even for the enchanted versions. \r\n\r\nList of enchantments for the \\\"Powered\\\" version: \r\nRobes - + 300 Magicka\r\nHood - + 300% Magicka regen\r\n\r\nOn the subject of armor rating: it doesn\\'t have any. Because it\\'s clothes. Clothes intended for mages. I won\\'t add armor rating ever for that reason, so don\\'t bother asking.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, I play and balance in expert. So yeah, some of you might find it a tad OP. I also do not like perk requirement, if only because I consider that this mod is mainly aesthetic. People are also mature enough to decide if they find the enchantments on the powered versions too OP for their taste. \r\n\r\nThe recipe is in-game, just check at the closest smelter. \r\n\r\nDon\\'t be shy, leave a comment, leave an endorsement if you like the mod. \r\n\r\nRemember, report every bugs related to my mod. \r\n\r\nAs always, enjoy.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nInstallation: the files inside the \\\"meshes\\\"/\\\"textures\\\" folders goes in:\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\Meshes\\\\clothes\\\\robedarkbrotherhood\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\clothes\\\\robedarkbrotherhood\r\n\r\nWhile the .esp file (Magnus V3.0) goes in \\\"data\\\".\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI did a Magnus armor mod too!
