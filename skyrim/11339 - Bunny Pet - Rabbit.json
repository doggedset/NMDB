  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will allow you to summon a simple pet who will follow you to the ends of Tamriel and back, similar to ones found in most MMO games. \r\n\r\nDecided to stick with the K.I.S.S theory on this mod like my Shadowmere mod. Light, clean, and unlikly to interfere with most other mods.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\nA Bunny pet to follow you around and just look cute.\r\n\r\nThe Bunny pet will not run from combat and cannot be kill. \r\n\r\nThe Bunny pet will follow you any where you want to go.\r\n\r\nThe Bunny pet is a conjured pet with a one hour duration (or five minutes with the old version).\r\n\r\nThe Bunny pet can be banished by summoning a different companion or fast traveling by map.\r\n\r\nThe book to learn the cojuration spell to summon the bunny can be purchased at Farengar Secret-Fire in Dragonsreach (Whiterun).\r\n\r\n[u]Other Notes[/u]\r\nNo longer supported. I do not plan to purchase Hearthfire due to a personal distaste for the product and so cannot mod with the new content. This mod should still work with unexpanded Skyrim (and Dawnguard if noted as such). Sorry for any inconvenience but with this game being almost a year old I feel it\\'s time to move on to newer modding horizons. Thank you to everyone who downloaded and enjoyed my Skyrim mods. I hope to see you all again in other mod workshops. Best wishes!\r\n",
