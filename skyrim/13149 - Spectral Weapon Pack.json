  "summary": "8 Spectral Daedric Weapons and 4 Spectral Nord Hero Weapons; Each weapon has a clean version and 4 enchanted variants. 3 Elite Spectral Weapons based on the vanilla Bound Weapons; Each Elite weapon has 4 enchanted variants. All enchanted variants use custom weapon shaders and animated effects.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds craftable versions of the Bound Battleaxe, Sword, Bow, and Arrows to the Daedric Smithing section of the forge, along with all 8 Daedric weapons in Spectral form, 4 Nord Hero weapons in Spectral form, a new Elixer craftable at the cookpot, a Soul Gem conversion option at the smelter, and new animated shaders and effects that can be used on any weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]A NOTE ON UPDATING:[/b][/u]\r\nIf you are updating from a version prior to 2.4 it is STRONGLY advised to do a new install from a clean save. Since the mod has grown beyond my original plans, I had to restructure most of the data. Forms have been changed, renamed, moved, deleted, and rebuilt. If you do not do a clean save and install, it will probably cause issues.\r\n\r\nIf you are updating from 2.4 to something newer, just replace the files when prompted, no special instructions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]The Basics[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nThe weapons here all have similar stats to their Daedric counterparts. The arrows have slightly higher damage, 25 instead of 24, and the slower weapons have been given a 1-3 point damage increase as well. The main advantage of the new weapons is having a low weight and a slightly faster attack speed. Spectral Arrows also fly 50% faster than vanilla arrows.\r\n\r\nTo craft and temper them, you\\'ll need to have the Arcane Smithing Perk. Daedric Smithing is not required to craft any of the weapons, but you will need it to temper them to legendary quality.\r\n\r\nThe Bound-style weapons are technically not enchantable because the the special effects are applied via an enchantment, and without it they don\\'t really do anything interesting. In order to make them a bit more useful, they can all be upgraded to better pre-enchanted variants. All other weapons in the pack have clean versions that are fully enchantable.\r\n\r\nBecause of the way the weapons and their FX were designed, the Bound Battleaxe and Bound Sword types will not have images in the inventory screen, and they will be completely invisible if dropped or put on displays. The Bound Bow was designed differently and does not have this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]The Weapons[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[b]Clean Spectral Bow[/b]\r\n-Based on the Bound Bow.\r\n-Uses custom tweaked version of the Bound Bow model.\r\n-Freely enchantable.\r\n\r\n[b]Elite Spectral: Battleaxe, Bow, Sword.[/b]\r\n-Based on the Bound Weapons.\r\n-Basic variant + 5 upgraded variants for each weapon type.\r\n-Basic variant includes the vanilla Bound weapon enchantments (Soul Trap, Banish, Turn Undead)(Requires the appropriate Conjuration Perks).\r\n-Elemental variants include the vanilla enchantments + 30 Fire, Frost, or Shock damage.\r\n-Reaver variant includes vanilla enchantments + 45 Spectral Damage (Generic Health Damage).\r\n-Terror variant includes vanilla enchantments + Fear for 10 seconds on opponents up to level 50.\r\n-Each version uses a custom tweaked version of the vanilla Bound Weapon FX and models.\r\n-Unlimited Charges.\r\n\r\n[b]Ancient Spectral: Battleaxe, Bow, Sword, Greatsword.[/b]\r\n-Based on the Nord Hero weapons.\r\n-Clean versions and 5 enchanted variants for each weapon type.\r\n-Reaver Variant does 50 points of Spectral Damage (Generic Health Damage).\r\n-Terror Variant does 20 points of Spectral damage and causes Fear for 10 seconds on opponents up to level 50.\r\n-Elemental Variants do 20 points of Spectral damage + 30 Fire, Frost, or Shock damage.\r\n-All enchanted versions use custom animated shaders and effects.\r\n-Enchanted versions have unlimited charges.\r\n\r\n[b]Spectral (Daedric): Battleaxe, Bow, Dagger, Greatsword, Mace,  Sword, War Axe, Warhammer.[/b]\r\n-Based on the Daedric weapons.\r\n-Clean versions and 5 enchanted variants for each weapon type.\r\n-Reaver Variant does 50 points of Spectral Damage (Generic Health Damage).\r\n-Terror Variant does 20 points of Spectral damage and causes Fear for 10 seconds on opponents up to level 50.\r\n-Elemental Variants do 20 points of Spectral damage + 30 Fire, Frost, or Shock damage.\r\n-All enchanted versions use custom animated shaders and effects.\r\n-Enchanted versions have unlimited charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]The Custom Weapon FX[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nThis mod also adds new animated shaders and colored swirl effects that can be applied to any enchantable weapon in the game. For the main version, I wanted to keep the shaders optional so I didn\\'t mess with any vanilla settings. In order to make the new shaders useable, I made duplicate versions of all the vanilla weapon enchantments and then set them up to use the custom effects. The duplicate enchantments are statistically identical to the vanilla enchantments.\r\n\r\n-If you\\'re using the main version of 3.2, you need to learn the new weapon enchantments.\r\n-Make sure you have the Arcane Blacksmith Perk and at least one empty Grand Soul Gem.\r\n-Head to the forge and check the Misc section, where you\\'ll find 13 steel swords called \\\"Spectral FX [Enchantment]\\\". Just craft them and then disenchant them to learn the effect.\r\n-In the enchanting window, the new effects will have the \\\"Spectral\\\" tag. Ex: \\\"Absorb Health Spectral\\\", \\\"Fire Damage Spectral\\\", \\\"Paralyze Spectral\\\", etc.\r\n-Enchant the weapons as you normally would, using the new enchantments.\r\n\r\n-If you\\'re using the optional replacer version of 3.2, the above method still works, but all of the vanilla weapon enchantments have been set to use the new shaders and effects.\r\n\r\n-Version 3.5 is currently replacer only, uses same method as 3.2 replacer version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Crafting:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t see the recipes at the forge, don\\'t panic! In order to reduce/prevent menu clutter, all of the Spectral weapon options will be hidden unless you have the required main ingredients and the Arcane Blacksmith Perk. Soul Gem conversions don\\'t have any perk requirements, but they will also be hidden unless you have correct Gems in your inventory.\r\n\r\n[b]Clean Spectral Bow:[/b] 1 Daedric Bow + 1 Filled Black Soul Gem\r\n\r\n[b]Elite Spectral (Bound, Basic Variant):[/b] 1 Daedra Heart + 1 Filled Black Soul Gem\r\n[b]Elite Fire:[/b] Basic Variant + 5 Fire Salts\r\n[b]Elite Frost:[/b] Basic Variant + 5 Frost Salts\r\n[b]Elite Shock:[/b] Basic Variant + 5 Void Salts\r\n[b]Elite Reaver:[/b] Basic Variant + 1 Human Heart\r\n[b]Elite Terror:[/b] Basic Variant + Daedra Heart\r\n\r\n[b]Ancient Spectral (Nord, Clean):[/b] 1 Daedra Heart + 1 Filled Black Soul Gem\r\n[b]Ancient Fire:[/b] Clean Variant + 5 Fire Salts\r\n[b]Ancient Frost:[/b] Clean Variant + 5 Frost Salts\r\n[b]Ancient Shock:[/b] Clean Variant + 5 Void Salts\r\n[b]Ancient Reaver:[/b] Clean Variant + 1 Human Heart\r\n[b]Ancient Terror:[/b] Clean Variant + 1 Daedra Heart\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Spectral (Daedric, Clean):[/b] 1 Daedra Heart + 1 Filled Black Soul Gem\r\n[b]Spectral Fire:[/b] Clean Variant + 5 Fire Salts\r\n[b]Spectral Frost:[/b] Clean Variant + 5 Frost Salts\r\n[b]Spectral Shock:[/b] Clean Variant + 5 Void Salts\r\n[b]Spectral Reaver:[/b] Clean Variant + 1 Human Heart\r\n[b]Spectral Terror:[/b] Clean Variant + 1 Daedra Heart\r\n\r\n[b]Tempering:[/b] 1 Grand Soul Gem (Empty).

Crafted at any Cookpot.
