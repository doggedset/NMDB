  "descriptionHtml": "10 Morning Star 4E 202\r\n    Today my friend Erandur confided in me that his name wasn\\'t always Erandur, he used to be called Brother Casimir and he was in a daedric cult. The topic came up because I was some masked cultists were walking around Windhelm asking people if they knew who I was. I wonder what they want. Erandur was complaining about how cold it was in Windhelm. He\\'s right, and even though we live in Dawnstar I\\'d have to say Windhelm seems colder. Maybe just because its all stone. I cant believe it when I see a guard walking around with no sleeves on.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1/24\r\nI HAVE UPDATED THE FILE WITH AN ESP THAT ADDS 3 VARIETYS TO GAME , CHAINMAIL, ROBES, AND CLOTH. TO USE ONE OF THESE AS A REPLACER YOU MUST USE LOOSE FILES VERSION AND JUST CHANGE THE FOLDER NAMES. THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE IS THE SAME AS HIDE YOU JUST HAVE TO CHANGE CHAINHIDE FOR EXAMPLE TO HIDE. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeta Notes\r\nwhat i think i\\'m gonna do as i move on next to studded is that i\\'m gonna put the hide armor over clothes or robes and put the studded over chainmail so its consitent for male and female. in this release its chainmail for males and cloth for females. so the male one in the future is gonna be changed to studded and there will be a mail one with cloth and the studded female will have chainmail. I am also working on an alternative for the female that has fur and a satchel you can see in the images",
