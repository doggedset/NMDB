  "modName": "I Did It for the Lulz",
  "summary": "Basic, bland, and boring mod that changes one of the dialogue options when interacting with guards: when confronted with your crimes and prompted to say something in your defense, you now can answer how you always wanted to: \"I did it for the lulz.\"<br /><br />Nothing else has been changed, and the guards will react in a predictable manner.",
  "descriptionHtml": "There's really not much to say here. This mod simply changes the line \"I'd rather die than go to prison!\" to \"I did it for the lulz.\" The guards will still react as before, since I really didn't change anything significant.  Should be compatible with pretty much everything else out there.",
