  "descriptionHtml": "I want for my bad English said sorry, if I say wrong or below left anything out, please forgive me..\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHi, the software is not I do, but I highly recommend it.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is very cool. And you prefer drab icon or vivid images?\r\n\r\nSecond, it is free, you can freely use it.\r\n\r\nFinally, it\\'s resources occupation rarely, very stable, but function very powerful!\r\n\r\nI think there must be people will like, when you install/make MOD, it can help you quickly find needed Textures!\r\n\r\nThank the authors from Russia\\'s Nikolay Raspopov created such great software, this is his web site: http://www.cherubicsoft.com/projects/sagethumbs\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSageThumbs 2.0.0.12\r\n\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/sagethumbs/\r\n\r\nSageThumbs is a powerful shell extension allowing to preview enormous amount of image formats directly in Windows Explorer by using Pierre-e Gougelet\\'s GFL library (XnView\\'s author).\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\nExtended thumbnail image view of Explorer folder\r\nThumbnail image in explorer context menu (rigth-click menu)\r\nExtended info tips\r\nSupport 162 image formats (224 extensions) via GFL Library\r\nSupport additional 26 image formats via XnView plugins (if installed)\r\nSend by mail support\r\nOne-click conversion to popular image formats support\r\nWallpaper selection support\r\nCopy to clipboard support\r\nPlease read carefully the following information:\r\nAs SageThumbs is a Windows Explorer context menu extension, there is no an executable file that you should launch to bring it up. To use it, just open any folder with image files in Windows Explorer, and then right-click a file you want to preview. You\\'ll see the thumbnail immediately in the context menu.\r\n\r\nExternal plugins\r\nSageThumbs can use external XnView plugins, it tries to automatically detect XnView installation folder or if failed it will use predefined folder. Typically this folder is \\\"C:\\\\!Program files\\\\XnView\\\\PlugIns\\\\\\\" for 32-bit SageThumbs on 32-bit Windows or 64-bit SageThumbs on 64-bit Windows and \\\"C:\\\\!Program Files (x86)\\\\XnView\\\\PlugIns\\\\\\\" for 32-bit SageThumbs on 64-bit Windows. So if you have no XnView installed you can create this folder manually and unpack plugins to it. Just don\\'t forget that you need same \\\"bit capacity\\\" for plugins and SageThumbs.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nWindows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/7 32/64-bit\r\nAbout 5 Mb of disk space + additional space for cache\r\nChangelog\r\n2.0.0.12\r\n\\\"Maximum size of image file\\\" option limits image thumbnail generation only\r\nAdded Spanish translation\r\n2.0.0.11\r\nAdded new option \\\"Show type overlay on thumbnails\\\"\r\nSeparated 32-bit and 64-bit plugins folders\r\nFixed some issues under UAC\r\nAdded Chinese translation\r\n2.0.0.10\r\nImproved/optimized image property information (Windows Vista and above)\r\nAdded progress dialogs for long operations\r\nAdded Italian translation\r\n2.0.0.9\r\nAdded support for image properties\r\nImproved working with image files associations in Windows Registry\r\nCache performance optimizations\r\nAdded Swedish translation\r\nAdded Portuguese translation\r\nAdded new version checker to installer\r\n2.0.0.8\r\nCombined 32/64-bit distributive\r\nAdded \\\"JPEG quality\\\" and \\\"PNG compression\\\" convert options\r\nAdded \\\"Convert to PNG\\\" context menu item\r\nOptimized options dialog\r\n2.0.0.7\r\nAdded option \\\"Enable Windows thumbnail cache\\\" (as Win7 \\\"black thumbnail\\\" bug workaround)\r\nAdded support for work under restricted account privileges (UAC)\r\nPerformance optimizations\r\nFixed SageThumbs modules stuck inside parent process\r\nExcluded by default \\\"wmz\\\" extension (used by \\\"Windows Media Player Skin Package\\\")\r\n2.0.0.6\r\nFixed Windows 7 \\\"black thumbnail\\\" bug\r\nProject converted to MS VS2010 (if compiled minimum system requirements will be Windows XP)\r\nOptimized distributive file (smaller)\r\n2.0.0.5\r\nAdded \\\"Maximum size of image file\\\" option to prevent processing of very large images (performance)\r\nAdded \\\"Prefer image file embedded thumbnails\\\" option (performance)\r\nAdded \\\"Use thumbnails as icons in Explorer\\\" option\r\nAdded Windows Cleanup utility support\r\nImproved thumbnail cache structure (performance)\r\nSQLite library updated to version 3.7.7.1\r\nMinor bugfixes and optimizations\r\nOpened project on Google Code: http://code.google.com/p/sagethumbs/\r\n2.0.0.4\r\nAdded German translation\r\nMinor bugfixes (disabled unfinished yet code for Explorer\\'s preview plane)\r\nCopyrights\r\nSageThumbs Copyright (C) Nikolay Raspopov, 2004-2011.
