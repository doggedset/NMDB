  "summary": "Small mod that makes movement more fluid, fixing several annoying issues in vanilla&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "Features:\r<br />\r<br />&gt;Walk backwards at the same speed as forwards, ideally used with mods such as 360 Walk (it includes a similar fix but failed to deliver it properly).\r<br />&gt;No speed penalty to drawing bows.\r<br />&gt;No speed penalty to casting.\r<br />&gt;Lesser speed penalty to blocking.\r<br />&gt;Blocking now has two speeds, your normal run speed and a walk speed that was missing from vanilla.\r<br />&gt;Sneaking has less of a speed penalty.\r<br />\r<br />I recommend using this mod with Attack Commitment or Mortal Enemies, as it was made with them in mind and highly compatible with them.",
