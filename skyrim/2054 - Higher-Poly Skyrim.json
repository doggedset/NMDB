  "descriptionHtml": "HIGHER-POLY SKYRIM (v0.2.1)\r<br />\r<br />SUMMARY:\r<br />Higher-Poly Skyrim came from me not being overly happy with the low-poly count on a few items (namely the apples) in Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />A decent chunk of research on my night off and some experimenting has yielded v0.1.0 of Higher-Poly Skyrim&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod does exactly as intended and replaces the .nif mesh files with the ones I have edited. this does not at all effect textures so feel free to use whatever hd texture pack your used to :)\r<br />So far we have the main offender, the apple, and also one of the wine bottles fixed up (although looking at the texture i will definitely fix that to match the contours of the bottles top - youll know what i mean when you see it)\r<br />\r<br />basically the whole plan here is to eventually replace a whole heap of stuff im personally not happy with in poly size. this means for you - more rounded objects (candles/goblets/drawer handles being actually round) and as I get more used to the nif file format well look at kicking up the poly count on some other stuff (armor, weapons etc) but only where I feel its needed.\r<br />\r<br />My job working as a 3D artist keeps me very busy lately so to those wondering why I dont release a texture pack, purely its because alot of people are already doing a great job on that. I haven&#39;t seen others attempt to fix the actual models (fix may not be the right term as they are excellent to start) So thats something I thought i could help with.\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to make requests and give feedback in the comments I only ask that story items/quest items not be talked about as Im playing the game as much as all of you and im sure other players would appreciate a spoiler-free experience also.\r<br />\r<br />that said, any items of that nature I feel i should fix as i cross them in-game i will do so and hide changes appropriately in the description for a spoiler-free page :)\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE:\r<br />I have found a solution to the vertex colour problem that gives hue to items like ruby/gold. unfortunately this is a VERY basic process i have devised and until better tools are available objects like the green apple a just not a possibility, as they have quite precise hue shading applied which if i was to try and replicate would take a VERY long time using this method. Im getting more versed at this process though so who knows ;) more to come soon guys&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I still need to get my head around worn items, as they are setup differently (bones/skinning etc). when I have worked this out I will be able to make wearable rings, amulets etc :D\r<br />\r<br />INSTALL:\r<br />just extract to your Skyrim directory :)\r<br />\r<br />delete the included files to uninstall :D\r<br />\r<br />PERFORMANCE:\r<br />This mod should really only be at the mercy of your videocard. I have not in any way edited the collision data or textures, so ram usage (textures) and cpu usage (physics) should be unchanged.\r<br />\r<br />Im running a gtx590 and an intel 2600k 3.4ghz (overclocked to 4.5)\r<br />and these two models havent affected frames-rates for me (yet&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />As I do more and more, the poly count on these objects easily will triple to get the effect im looking for, and I imagine soon as theres enough changed obects the game may suffer on the performance scale for it. that said there wont be a &#39;mid&#39; range version as I count skyrim vanilla to already cater to that crowd.\r<br />\r<br />THANKS:\r<br />Big thanks of course to the amazing artists at Bethesda for their impeccable design, no doubt all the objects exist in a super-high poly version on their servers so really i wish they released a higher res pack from there&#33; but alas it is obviously a performance issue.\r<br />\r<br />Also A huge thanks to the creators & contibutors over at niftools.sourceforge.net\r<br />\r<br />- - - - - -\r<br />\r<br />VERSION OVERVIEW:\r<br />\r<br />- - - - - - \r<br />&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />v0.2.1   02/12/2011\r<br />FIXED\r<br />normal maps now display correctly\r<br />\r<br />ADDED\r<br />Bread\r<br />Long Taffy\r<br />Gold Ring\r<br />Cooked Chicken Breast\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />v0.2.0 - 01/12/2011\r<br />ADDED\r<br />Silver Ring (unequipped)\r<br />Silver Ruby Ring (unequipped)\r<br />Silver Garnet Ring (unequipped)\r<br />Ring (unequipped)\r<br />\r<br />note: equipped apparel coming soon&#33; :D\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />1st release&#33; v0.1.0  - 30/11/2010\r<br />ADDED\r<br />Red Apple\r<br />Corovian Brandy\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />made by Benjamin Swinbanks (DeadlyAzuril)",
