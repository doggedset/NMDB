  "summary": "Adds a small player home designed for Stealth characters.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new player &#34;home&#34; to the area right outside of Whiterun near Fort Greymoor. There isn&#39;t a lot there but it is suited for someone who would like to avoid the bright lights of the city.\r<br />\r<br />Perks of this little place\r<br />-Mannequin pre-equipped with some gear aimed toward a stealth character.\r<br />-Weapon racks with Elven swords preattached\r<br />-A bed that grants the &#34;well rested&#34; perk\r<br />-Safe storage (chest, satchel, knapsack, dresser)\r<br />-Alchemy table\r<br />-Small shelf that works as a bookshelf\r<br />-Statue of Nocturnal that adds a stealth perk and removes any diseases you may have caught.\r<br />\r<br />F.A.Q.\r<br />Q: How do I get into the Safehouse?\r<br />A: Once you get to the destroyed house, there is a key sitting on the fireplace mantle. Picking it up will complete the quest and allow you to open to trapdoor near the fireplace.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Why make such a simple house mod when there are so many better ones available?\r<br />A: I wanted something small and kind of &#34;out of sight&#34; for my Stealth based characters. Plus I wanted to figure out this &#34;writing a script&#34; thing, so I did.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Are you going to be adding features?\r<br />A: Maybe. I&#39;m toying around with the idea of adding more loot to certain places, making them worth robbing. High profile places will have more things of value to steal. I also may add a new fence merchant to sell your haul to, without having to be in the Thieve&#39;s guild.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Is the stuff that&#39;s already included guaranteed to be there in future release?\r<br />A: No and some items may be tweaked as well.",
