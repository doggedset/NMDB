  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][center]Lorgakh Yal: An Orc Stronghold Player Home[/center][/size][size=3]\r<br />\r<br />[center]I made this mod because I wasn&#39;t satisfied with the three Orc Stronghold mods I found out there. It&#39;s really a personal mod, but I thought some people would like it. This is my very first mod, so there may be bugs or clipping, although I did my best. Any bugs you find just post in the comments and I&#39;ll fix it.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />﻿[u]Description: [/u][i]\r<br />\r<br />Lorgakh Yal[/i] has replaced[i] Bilegulch Mine[/i], which is Southwest of [i]Fort Sungard[/i] and directly North of [i]Glenmoril Coven. [/i]Lorgakh Yal includes a longhouse with six beds for followers. There is a forge with a workbench, smelter, tanning rack, and a grindstone. The orichalcum mine has nine ore veins. There is an enchanter and alchemy table located outside. Also, a statue of Malacath watches over the stronghold, with an altar for offerings to him. Everything has been navmeshed so followers can navigate everything.\r<br />[u]\r<br />Requirements:[/u]\r<br />\r<br />Just Skyrim updated to the latest version, no DLC&#39;s or other mods needed.\r<br />[u]\r<br />Bugs:[/u]\r<br />\r<br />There are three radiant quests that may use this area. I have left the mine intact so you can still kill the bandit boss and complete the quests. There may be problems with the quest markers\r<br />\r<br />[u]Recommended Mods:[/u]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36459/?]\r<br />Ghorza&#39;s Armor by atomec[/url]﻿-A great Orcish armor for females.\r<br />[url=http:////www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9378/?]Multiple Marriages... by Dudestia[/url]﻿-Absolutely essential for multiple wives (or husbands) and the Orsimer culture experience.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045/?]My Home is Your Home by Volek[/url]﻿-Needed to make your followers live here.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?]Amazing Follower Tweaks by Dheuster[/url]﻿-Can make any NPC your follower, I used this and the above to make Ghorza (the smith in Markarth) my smith at home.\r<br />[u]\r<br />Permission:[/u]\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t want this reuploaded on other sites or reuploaded here with your own changes.
