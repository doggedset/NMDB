  "descriptionHtml": "Nightingale Hi-res Retex with Torn Scarf and Variants\r\nby AlphaDragoon and InfiniDragon, 2011\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\nHey folks, you may know me as that guy who did the Torn Scarf version of the Nightingale Armor. Well, my brother and I are done with our latest work, re-texturing the Nightingale Armor. \\\"Now you may ask, why do this? The Nightingale Prime armor mod is already out!\\\" Well, we did it because while Zerofrost did an awesome job with his mod, we thought people might like a hi-res re-texture that looks like the original armor. So if you are one of those said people, enjoy.\r\n\r\nThis was done completely from scratch, by hand (by Wacom tablet really XD), with no use of any other mods such as the Nightingale Prime. If you\\'d like to use it for any of your own recolors and such, please ask first. Thanks a bunch, my brother and I appreciate it.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to RabbitFly here on the Nexus, who showed me how to finally fix the stupid tanned fingers on the male version of the armor! That update is now available (version 1.1 of the main file if you haven\\'t downloaded it yet, or just get the Glove Fix optional file if you have the mod already). Again, thanks a bunch.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\nCHANGELOG:\r\n1.1 (1/3/2012) - Updated the Main Files with a fix to the gloves for male characters, the skin on the fingers is now matching with the character instead of being much darker. Also uploaded an Optional File for folks who already have the mod that just fixes the gloves.\r\n1.0 (12/15/2011) - First version.\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\n**IF YOU HAVE THE OFFICIAL SKYRIM HI-RES TEXTURE PACKS FROM BETHESDA, READ THIS FIRST**\r\nIn order to make it recognize my mod (or any texture mod that isn\\'t the official hi-res one), you have to uncheck the two .esp files for the hi-res packs (in the Nexus Mod Manager or in the Data Files when you load the Skyrim launcher), then change a couple of .ini files, which are \\\"SteamApps\\\\Common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Skyrim_default.ini\\\" and \\\"Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Skyrim.ini\\\". In both of those files, under the [Archive] section, you have to add both HighResTexturePack01.bsa and HighResTexturePack02.bsa to the end of your list. Mine looks like this:\r\n\r\n[Archive]\r\nsResourceArchiveList=Skyrim - AI!.bsa, Skyrim - Misc.bsa, Skyrim - Shaders.bsa, Skyrim - Textures.bsa, Skyrim - Interface.bsa, Skyrim - Animations.bsa, Skyrim - Meshes.bsa, Skyrim - Sounds.bsa\r\nsResourceArchiveList2=Skyrim - Voices.bsa, Skyrim - VoicesExtra.bsa, HighResTexturePack01.bsa, HighResTexturePack02.bsa\r\n\r\nThis should allow you to use the official hi-res pack and any mods for textures you already have (like mine) will override it. So anything that was still vanilla texture gets the official upgrade and anything the modders already got to remains unaffected. Thanks to Zabii for bringing this to my attention, and thanks to TheOutlander for providing the step-by-step process. There\\'s a thread about it, if you have trouble getting it to work post a comment on the following link rather than on my page (I\\'m just the messenger):\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/555176-bethesda-hd-pack-override/page__st__10\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\nChoose one of the files (Caped, Scarf or Capeless), and download it. They overwrite each other so there\\'s no way to have all of them on at once. If you\\'re nifty with placing mods in folders though you can have one version for males and another version for females.\r\n\r\nExtract the .RAR file anywhere, say your Desktop for example. Open up the unzipped file and locate the \\\"Meshes\\\" and the \\\"textures\\\" folder. Drag both the \\\"Meshes\\\" and \\\"textures\\\" folder into your \\\"Data\\\" folder for Skyrim, which is typically \\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data.\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\nUNINSTALLATION:\r\nGo into the skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor folder and the skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Meshes\\\\armor folder and delete the folders marked \\\"nightingale\\\".\r\n**********************************************************************************************************",
