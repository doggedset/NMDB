  "modName": "Rename Weapons via Static Damage Enchant",
  "summary": "Adds an enchant that does 1 point of damage (or nothing at all) to the game to allow weapon renaming without weapon charges or glows.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red]UPDATED: Since it seems at least a few people might actually use this I remade it and put a modicum of thought into the best ways to have it work (on the original I spent more time uploading it here than creating it) so fixed the minor text mistake on the original version and added an alternative means.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]---What does it do?[/b]\r<br />This mod simply adds an enchant that adds a &#39;1 point of damage&#39; enchant to the game. It does this in order to allow people to &#39;enchant&#39; their weapon and thus allow you to rename it, without having to deal with weapon charges, messages about your enchant being resisted or enchant animations. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]---Where to get it the enchant?[/b]\r<br />To get the enchant there is a lone &#39;Imbued Iron Dagger&#39; in the game located in Alvor&#39;s home in Riverwood which you can disenchant to learn the effect. Then simply &#39;enchant&#39; your weapon and you will gain 1 point of damage for your trouble&#33; (And more importantly the opportunity to rename the item)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]---Alternative Version: Rename Enchant [/b]\r<br />New version adds no effect at all, but if anyone can think of a better generic description to use please say as unfortunately it wouldn&#39;t let me have no name at all. You can easily alter the item description in the CreationKit by editing the &#39;Magic item description&#39; box for the RenameEnchant mod&#39;s &#39;AAAEnchRenameWeaponEffect&#39; Magic Effect.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]---Is it compatible with?[/b]\r<br />Either version should be compatible with anything given that it is simply three added entries and the placement of a dagger into Alvor&#39;s home as a means for people who don&#39;t like using the console to get the enchant. They are even compatible with each other if you really want&#33;",
