  "descriptionHtml": "Adds 11 metric tons of netch to sky rims outdoor worldspace. Put tons of animals/wisps/monsters with thier Morrowind variants. Good with my Mo&#39; Mushrooms mod. Also goes good with morrowloot 4e. I love to hear constructive criticism, from fellow modders/players. That being said, I made this for me, it&#39;s no where near perfect and actually pretty bugged up. I like netches and mushrooms so if you do too now is your chance to put one or the other or both in.",
