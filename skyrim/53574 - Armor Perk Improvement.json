  "descriptionHtml": "Sorry for my poor Engligh first.\r<br />\r<br />**Upload a patch for [Weapons and Armor Fixes - Remade with Dawnguard and Dragonborn support]**\r<br />\r<br />**v2_1 version is uploaded**\r<br />\r<br />=The reason for making this mod=\r<br />(1) make heavy armor more useful\r<br />In vanilla game, we can easilly reach the armor cap with light armor, so heavy armor isn&#39;t as useful as it should be.( See the Armor Cap section of this page:  http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Armor )\r<br />\r<br />(2) mix & match of heavy and light armor\r<br />In vanilla game, most perks of heavy armor and light armor require a full set of heavy or light armor (including cuirass, boots, helmet and gauntlets) to bring into effect, and this make mix & match of heavy and light armor is nearly impossible.\r<br />\r<br />(3) equipments added by mods.\r<br />In vanilla game, those perks not only ask a full set armor, but also ask us not to wear both heavy and light armor. It is ok in vanilla game, because there are not other equipments which can be equipped with a full armor set (4 pieces, cuirass, boots, helmet and gauntlets). But some mods add new equipments that are not cuirass, boots, helmet or gauntlets, so we can equip them with a full armor set. If we wear a full heavy armor set (cuirass, boots, helmet and gauntlets), and equip a equipment added by a mod which have the key word &#34;armorlight&#34; (means it belongs to light armor) , it will cause those perks not working.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />============================================================================================\r<br />v2_1 version\r<br />\r<br />=What&#39;s new=\r<br />(1) Require skyrim 1.9.32.0.8\r<br />\r<br />(2) Fix the issue that the two Matching Set perks (both Heavy Armor and Light Armor) do not work correctly on some sets in v2 version. It is my mistake that I made v2 without using the update.esm. v2_1 version is remade based on update.esm, so 1.9.32.0.8 is required.\r<br />\r<br />(3) Chang the descrption of the Matching Set(Heavy Armor) and Art Of Heavy. \r<br />(The discription in v2 version is too long to display in game.) \r<br />(Effects are the same as v2 version.)\r<br />( ........ Without Conditioning, the more pieces of heavy armor being worn, the more ranged(Art Of Heavy) /melee(Matching Set) weapon damage being reduced. )\r<br />\r<br />(4) If you have used v2 version, just uninstall it then install v2_1\r<br />\r<br />(5) Sorry for making such a big mistake.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />============================================================================================\r<br />v2 version\r<br />\r<br />=How I change vanilla perks=\r<br />I do these by couting the number of how much heavy or light armor being worn.\r<br />\r<br />=The differences in v2 version (compared with v1)=\r<br />(1) Thre are not new perks anymore.\r<br />     All the effects of new perks added in v1 are integrated into vanilla perks.\r<br />     Player need not pay additional perk points to get those effects.\r<br />(2) Perk trees are not modded.\r<br />     Now it is campatible with mods adding new perks and modding perk trees.\r<br />\r<br />=List of vanilla perks being modded=\r<br />&lt;&lt;Heavy armor&gt;&gt;\r<br />(1) [Well Fitted]\r<br />When wearing heavy armor without light armor, 25% Heavy Armor bonus if wearing at least 3 pieces of heavy armor; when with light armor, 25% bonus if wearing at least 2 pieces.\r<br />(Only heavy armor rating will be raised.)\r<br />\r<br />(2) [Tower of Strength]\r<br />50% less stagger if wearing more than 4 pieces of heavy armor.
