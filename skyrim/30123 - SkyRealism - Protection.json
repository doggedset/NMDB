Also, send me a PM to get ahold of me faster if you have problems.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Overview[/heading]Have you ever wondered why heavy armor and light armor both provide practically no protection at low levels, and both provide the same maximum protection at high levels, why they both scale at exactly the same rate, with a tiny difference in the base armor rating? Why there&#39;s really reason to use one or the other except for looks?\r<br />\r<br />I do.\r<br />\r<br />This is why I created [color=#87CEEB]Sky[/color][color=#C3B091]Realism[/color] - Armor Adjustment. It gives ALL bipedal races a scaling reduction to all physical damage taken depending on how many pieces of each type of armor you are wearing. This provides 25% protection when wearing 4 pieces of light armor and 50% protection when wearing 4 pieces of heavy armor, in addition to the reduction from Armor Rating.\r<br />\r<br />Heavily armored bandits will be much harder to kill; fights will take a while at low levels, and those in light armor will be at a severe disadvantage against heavily armored opponents. Draugr and Falmer will be harder to kill, and you&#39;ll find that fully armored Draugr and Falmer are extremely tough.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is intended to be used with the other [color=#87CEEB]Sky[/color][color=#C3B091]Realism[/color] mods, particularly [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21211]Encumbrance[/url]. When these are used together, it will make using heavy armor feel like you&#39;re walking around fully encased in a suit of steel, slow and clunky, but very hard to kill. However, heavily armored warriors will find mages to be much more dangerous; Frost mages can be truly frightening opponents for even the mightiest plate-wearing juggernaut.\r<br />\r<br />I highly recommend changing the game difficulty to Expert or Master when using this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Racial Perks[/heading]\r<br />I have include an alternate version of this mod which provides all humanoid races with one free racial perk; the first perk in the skill tree for that race&#39;s highest racial skill bonus (except Imperials). Imperials get Haggling (1/5), Khajiit get Stealth (1/5), Dunmer get Novice Destruction, Nords get Barbarian (1/5), Orcs have Juggernaut (1/5), and so on.\r<br />\r<br />This alternate version is the one I personally use, since I feel that most of the races don&#39;t really have anything to distinguish them. I felt that giving one racial perk would be more appropriate than tweaking or changing the racial powers, since they start at level 1, but have 0 perks.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Compatibility, Issues, and Troubleshooting[/heading]This mod will not work with any other mods which make changes to the Skyrim races.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Change Log[/heading][b]v1.2:[/b]\r<br />Changed Carry Weight values back to original Skyrim default (300). \r<br />Implemented changes from Unofficial Elder Scrolls Patch.\r<br />\r<br />[b]v1.0:[/b]\r<br />Initial Release.",
