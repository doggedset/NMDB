  "descriptionHtml": "*Update: I believe I have fixed the problem with the menu not showing up. If you had a problem remove the mod from your nmm or manual and redownload it. Sorry for that everyone\r\n\r\nNot sure if this has been done yet or not but what the heck here is a very simple main menu replacer of Miraak from Dragonborn\r\n\r\nSimply use the NMM or Manual where you just drop the Textures folder into your data and your PC should do the rest.\r\n\r\nUse however you wish since this image is trademarked to Bethesda\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy =)",
