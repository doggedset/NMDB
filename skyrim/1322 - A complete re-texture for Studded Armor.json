  "descriptionHtml": "The Studded Armor is one of my favorite armors in game and fits Skyrim like a glove. But the texture on the armor was a bit low quality so i decided to do it from scratch. This was a personal mod but since it was a long project i decided to share with you guys.\r\n\r\nThis isn\\'t a only recolor / saturation / sharpen texture mod.\r\n\r\n - Completely new high quality textures\r\n - Improved contrast/saturation\r\n - Doubled the resolution (1024x1024 -> 2048x2048)\r\n\r\n\r\n*UPDATE*\r\n - Added the male version\r\n - Female updated\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nPlace the two files in:\r\nfor female -> Skyrim dir/Data/textures/armor/hide/f\r\nfor male -> Skyrim dir/Data/textures/armor/hide/m\r\nTo uninstall just delete them.\r\n\r\nberna.",
