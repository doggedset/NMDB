  "descriptionHtml": "**********************************************************BETA************************************************************************\r\n\r\nThis mod needs to be tested for difficulty.  The chest only stays in place for 6 game minutes, so the spell can be used relatively rapidly for testing.  The value in the release will be at least 30 game minutes.  \r\n\r\nThe chest seems a bit finicky.  It can take between 5-45 seconds to appear.  And it is likely to not appear in tight areas.  Outside or large rooms work best.  \r\n\r\nPlease comment on whether the guardians are too weak or difficult, or if there is anything else to improve on. \r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nAdds a spell which summons a chest to store objects.
