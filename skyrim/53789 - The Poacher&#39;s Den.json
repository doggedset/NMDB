Even though Tanis is quite proud\r<br />of his hunting abilities, he still needs help sometimes. That\r<br />is where you come in. Help Tanis by finding pelts and other\r<br />items from the hunt, and he will give you rare enchanted\r<br />items as a reward. At the moment, there are 10 different\r<br />quests to do for helping Tanis. There will be more in the future.\r<br />\r<br />This mod includes:\r<br />10 new enchanted items\r<br />8 new foods\r<br />\r<br />If you want a more challenging approach to this mod, \r<br />I recommend the mod Hunterborn.\r<br />\r<br />Requires:\r<br />Skyrim & The latest update\r<br />\r<br />Future Plans for This Mod:\r<br />* Voices (If you are interested in either Tanis or Amaya&#39;s role, PM me.)\r<br />* More quests\r<br />\r<br />Mod Conflicts:\r<br />Aurora Village\r<br />Any other mod that edits that location.\r<br />\r<br />If you can guess where the mod got its name, I&#39;ll give you a cookie. :)\r<br />I hope you enjoy my mod.\r<br />",
