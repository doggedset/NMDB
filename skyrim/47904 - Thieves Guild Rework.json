  "descriptionHtml": "I really like the Thieves Guild Headquarter but i was missing a few things:\r\n\r\n- Arcane Enchanter\r\n- Private Room\r\n- Brightness\r\n- Mannequins \r\n\r\nMy aim is to keep it realistic, not to make some overpowered player home. thats why it should be basic. \r\n\r\nVersion 1.0: \r\n\r\nSo I've relocated the Alchemy Lab and added a Arcane Enchanter in the hallway to the Ragged Flagon.\r\n\r\nSince the treasureroom was quite useless i decided to use it as a private room. First of all i removed the old furniture which contains emty chests and so on.\r\n\r\nI've added a few chests and a lot of mannequins. Also a king sized bed in the center.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this ive placed some lights all over the HQ so it became brighter.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it, comments are welcome.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0:\r\n\r\nI've added a new room in this version. It is located on the left side when you go to the archery room.\r\n\r\nThe new room contains:\r\n- 7 Mannequins\r\n- a campfire\r\n- a kingsized bed\r\n- animal trophies at the walls \r\n- 2 guild chests\r\n- 1 large chest\r\n- 1 table enchanter\r\n- 1 alchemy lab\r\n- a few barrels for storage\r\n\r\nVersion 2.1:\r\n\r\n- added 2 weapon display cases\r\n- added a door to the room\r\n\r\nVersion 2.2:\r\n\r\n- added 2 new roooms\r\n-> alchemy room\r\n-> pool room\r\n- updated mainroom\r\n\r\nthe main room now has \r\n- a cooking spot near the campfire\r\n- a table with food to harvest, like salmon, chicken and pheasant\r\n- several meat at the table\r\n- i relocated the alchemy lab to the alchemy room\r\n- i also relocated the mannequins, so you can use the hallway properly\r\n\r\nthe alchemy room contains:\r\n- several shrooms wich can be harvested\r\n- alchemy lab\r\n- chicken stall, with chicken nests\r\n- campfire\r\n\r\na pool room \r\n- contains a lot of water\r\n- a statue of nightingale\r\n\r\nVersion 2.3:\r\n\r\n- added a large weapon rack behind the mannequins to store your weapons\r\n- removed brightness in the hallway to the red flagon\r\n\r\ni think this mod has so far everything you need - suggestions are welcome! :)\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\n- you can't place the ghostblade at the weapon rack\r\n- lightening bug -> objects are black until you get closer\r\n",
