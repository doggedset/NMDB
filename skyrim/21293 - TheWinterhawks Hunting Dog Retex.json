  "descriptionHtml": "TheWinterhawks Hunting Dog Retex v1.0\r\n\r\nThis is a simple dog texture replacer. To replace your vanilla dog texture, choose ONLY ONE of the folders from the downloaded archive and put it into your skyrim/data folder.\r\n\r\nI made the textures a while back while working on my BWL project and thought I\\'d upload the dog skins as separated files.\r\n\r\nTo make the choice easier I\\'ve included screenshots of the different textures. They all look very similar, because they were originally made to suit a little dog family, which I included in my playerhouse mod \\\"TheWinterhawks Black Wolf Lodge\\\". So don\\'t expect wide varieties! However, each of the 4 skins is unique in spots and coloring.\r\n\r\nIf you are a more advanced user you may assign unique skins to different dogs in the CK and put the files into separated paths of your choice.\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]This mod only provides the textures, it does NOT include any new unique dogs![/b][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nRelease Date: 7/29/2012 v1.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]My Other Mods:[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re interested in my other works, I\\'d be glad to see/read you on one of the following pages:\r\n\r\n[color=lightblue][b]- TheWinterhawks Black Wolf Lodge[/b][/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14660\r\n--> An upper class/noble playerhouse with horse stables, dogs and a farm maiden npc\r\n\r\n[color=lightblue][b]- TheWinterhawks Hunter Saddle With Variants[/b][/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22755\r\n--> 3 hunter saddle variants\r\n\r\n[color=lightblue][b]- No More Stupid Dog Comments[/b][/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21225\r\n--> Stops NPCs from saying: \\\"Stupid Dog!\\\"\r\n\r\n[color=lightblue][b]- TheWinterhawks Hunting Dog Retex[/b][/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21293\r\n--> 4 similar variants to choose from (replacer only)\r\n\r\n[color=lightblue][b]- TheWinterhawks Dog Retex - Spots[/b][/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26360\r\n--> A white dog puppy with black spots (available as retex and standalone)\r\n\r\n[color=lightblue][b]- Ice Floes - Travel the Polar Sea Dry-Shod[/b][/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26194\r\n--> No more swimming in half frozen water to get to several locations, incl.
