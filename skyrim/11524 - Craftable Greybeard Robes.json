  "modName": "Craftable Greybeard Robes",
  "summary": "Simple to make Greybeard robes - previously unavailable to the player unless the console was used. No perks necessary.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Updates:\r\n1.2 - Fixed the issue where NPCs accuse the player of being naked. Turns out the robes are missing a piece of script that all other clothing has that lets the NPCs know that the user is wearing clothes. Neat. There\\'s a \\\"Classic\\\" version for those who enjoy being accused of nudity...\r\n1.1 - Fixed issues with hood not appearing in some players\\' inventory\r\n1.0 - Mod uploaded\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nMaybe it was just me, but I thought that the Greybeard robes were the coolest looking robes in the game. I was surprised that they were not available to obtain without the use of the console...\r\n\r\nSo, for my first mod, I decided to make these awesome robes craftable. This includes:\r\nGreybeard\\'s Hood - 1 Leather, 1 Leather Strip\r\nGreybeard\\'s Robes - 2 Leather, 4 Leather Strips\r\nGreybeard\\'s Boots - 1 Leather, 2 Leather Strips\r\n\r\nNo perks necessary, and as you can see, not very demanding material-wise. The only catch is that they aren\\'t worth anything (other than their sentimental value!)\r\n\r\nManual Install:\r\nJust unzip the folder into your data folder for the game, located here if using steam:\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nThanks to...\r\nBathesda for both Skyrim and the Creation Kit, without either of them this could have never happened\r\nThis user\\'s video, which will help anyone interested in making a craftable item:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPFwC4XFjBo\r\nAnd you guys, for downloading, and to the bug finders out there (like Nexus user DarkGenius).",
