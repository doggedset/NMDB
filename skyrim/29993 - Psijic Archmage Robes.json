  "descriptionHtml": "Craftable Psijic Archmage Outfit\r<br />\r<br />I never really liked the Archmage Outfit, but the Psijic Outfit is kind of awesome.\r<br />So i made the Psijic Archmage Outfit.\r<br />All parts are craftable at any forge in the misc section.\r<br />I had no save game before i finished it, so i could not test this part, but i intended to make it not craftable until the quest Eye of Magnus is finished.\r<br />So the Psijic Archmage Outfit is a gift from the Psijic Order because you saved the world. (Again...)\r<br />The enchantments are similar to the Archmage Outfit but they are a little bit stronger, but not overpowered (in my eyes), since the Psijics are like the UBER magic guild somehow.\r<br />Unfortunately the orc and khajiit hoods have clipping issues. DonÂ´t know how to fix this yet.\r<br />Maybe someone can test, if it really is NOT craftable before the Eye of Magnus quest is finished.\r<br />\r<br />Have Fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I checked the mod with TES5Edit, so no problems should occur\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE: \r<br />1.1\r<br />- Thanks to BabattKhan for verifying that the outfit is really not craftable before the Eye of Magnus quest&#33;\r<br />- Clipping from Khajit and Orc races solved, just minor horn clipping from argonians left. If someone knows a solution say it^^\r<br />1.2\r<br />- Now Imperial vampires are able to wear the gauntles and boots too\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />Just unzip and copy the data folder into the Skyrim folder\r<br />And overwrite if it is asked.\r<br />\r<br />USER PERMISSIONS:\r<br />- Translations, if nothing else than the language is changed\r<br />- Retextures (will change normal Psijic Robes aswell)\r<br />- Custom body mods like CBBE and UNP (would also change normal Psijic Robes)\r<br />- Skyrim Nexus exclusive\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS:\r<br />Bethesda for making Skyrim",
