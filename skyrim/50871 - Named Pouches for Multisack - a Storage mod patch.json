  "descriptionHtml": "This is a patch I made for wgtein&#39;s mod Multisack, which adds 16 pouches into the game to store items into for better item management.  This patch changes the generic names of pouch A, pouch B etc. into more immersive and useful names.  \r<br />\r<br />NOTE: wgstein&#39;s mod MultiSack is required for this patch, I have only edited the esp plugin and have not uploaded the mesh, texture, or script assets from the original mod.  Please install his mod and overwrite his esp plugin with mine.  Mod link is below, in the Credits section.\r<br />\r<br />I have named the pouches as follows:\r<br />\r<br />Pouch-A   ---&gt;   Junk\r<br />Pouch-B   ---&gt;   Spoils\r<br />Pouch-C   ---&gt;   Clothing\r<br />Pouch-D   ---&gt;   Clutter\r<br />Pouch-E   ---&gt;   Magician&#39;s Bag\r<br />Pouch-F   ---&gt;   Survivalist&#39;s Sack\r<br />Pouch-G   ---&gt;   Prepared Food\r<br />Pouch-H   ---&gt;   Unprepared Food\r<br />Pouch-I   ---&gt;   Furs\r<br />Pouch-J   ---&gt;   Gems\r<br />Pouch-K   ---&gt;   Soul Gems\r<br />Pouch-L   ---&gt;   Forge Work\r<br />Pouch-M   ---&gt;   LeatherWork\r<br />Pouch-N   ---&gt;   Smelter&#39;s Sack\r<br />Pouch-O   ---&gt;   Follower A\r<br />Pouch-P   ---&gt;   Follower B\r<br />\r<br />The reason I chose these names is because I wanted to primarily make item management for dungeon crawling and crafting a little easier to do.  There are several pouches custom named to better sort crafting materials and even a couple for enchantment work, such as the soul gem bag and magician&#39;s bag where you can store all sorts of magical items.  In order to get all 16 named pouches, just craft 16 pouches&#33;  Keep the ones you need and store the ones you won&#39;t use.  There is no other method of obtaining them as each pouch is not craftable standalone, just like with the original mod.  I hope that others can find the same enjoyment I do in this mod, and if anyone has any suggestions let me know&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credit goes to wgstein for the original mod MultiSack.
