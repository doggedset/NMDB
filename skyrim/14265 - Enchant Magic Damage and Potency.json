  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Enchant Magic Damage and Potency\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nDate: 4/3/2012\r\nCategory: Magic - Spells & enchantments\r\nAuthor(s): Cupressi\r\nNexus: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14265\r\nSteam Workshop: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=20491\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nSteel can progress to legendary power. Magic stays the same the day you learned the spell from the tome. Good thing you can reduce spell cost by 100% because you needed to cast it 50 times to kill anything.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds 5 circlets which you can disenchant to give you the ability to enchant your armor to increase spell damage and potency.\r\n-Alteration: increases spell duration\r\n-Conjuration: increase spell duration\r\n-Destruction: increase spell damage\r\n-Illusion: increase level effectiveness\r\n-Restoration: increase spell potency\r\n\r\nThe circlets are enchanted at a 50% increase so they can be used for characters without a high enchanting skill. The enchantments will be somewhat more powerful than what you can reach with the weapon damage enchantments. This feels balanced since you can drastically improve weapons with smithing but cannot do so with magic. The power level feels appropriate compared to an equivalent weapon.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nCollege of Winterhold, Hall of Countenance, 2nd floor next to the enchanting alter.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\nNMM:\r\n1. Click activate\r\n\r\nManual:\r\n1. Copy the .esp file to (install folder)\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n2. Start Skyrim Launcher, click \\'Data Files\\', place a checkmark beside the .esp file.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\nNMM:\r\n1. Click deactivate\r\n\r\nManual:\r\n1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file(s).\r\n2. Delete the .esp file from \\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nShould be compatible with everything unless another mod puts something where the circlet box is. No vanilla assets are altered.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nNone at the moment. If you find something please post a comment or PM me.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0 - Initial release.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nComments section or PM\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r\nThanks to TESNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\nThanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nCreation Kit\r\nLHammonds Readme Generator\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nYou can do whatever you want with this mod but all I ask in return is that you give me credit and let me know if you distribute any part of this mod.
