  "descriptionHtml": "==============================\r\nDescription\r\n==============================\r\nJannis234\\\\\\'s Upscales is a series of mods that contain better (HD) versions of vanilla textures. They are basically upscaled versions of the vanilla textures that have been modified to look better. Why? Well, my art skills are extremely terrible. These mods are desinged to be a \\\\\\\"placeholder\\\\\\\" so you don\\\\\\'t have low-res vanilla textures between your high-res mod textures. They obviously don\\\\\\'t look as good as textures that were made by hand but they still look much better than the low-res vanilla textures.\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================\r\nDetails\r\n==============================\r\nThis mod adds HD versions for nearly all textures in the \\\\\\\"architecture\\\\\\\" folder. This folder includes the large cities (Whiterun, Solitude, Windhelm, ...) and some other buildings (Farmhouses, High Hrothgar, ...) - small villages are also included because they use the farmhouse textures.\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================\r\nCompatibility\r\n==============================\r\nSince this is just a HD replacer, it should be compatible with anything. If you have another texture replacer, you can simply replace my textures with the textures from that mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================\r\nInstallation\r\n==============================\r\nSimply use the Nexus Mod Manager or put the contents of this mod in your Skyrim\\\\\\'s data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================\r\nCredits\r\n==============================\r\nThe textures were created in GIMP (+ some GIMP plugins) and are modified versions of Bethesda\\\\\\'s original textures.
