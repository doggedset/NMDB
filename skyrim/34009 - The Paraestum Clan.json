(use ApachiiSkyHair Full, Female Style #8 for full effect)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nFor all intents and purposes, she is founding member and reluctant leader of the clan.  Some event in her past has made her reclusive, forlorn and hypersensitive to the atrocities and injustices of the world.  I haven\\'t been able to coax her into telling me the full story.  What I have heard has been in bits and pieces.  She carries the tattered family crest with her, with her father\\'s faded blood stains.  Her parents were taken from her at the same time.  Her elder sister is somewhere in Skyrim, but the fear is she is no longer herself.  Lady Paraestüm was looking for her until she was captured and was embroiled in the goings-on in Helgen.\r\n\r\nLady Paraestüm\\'s weapons of choice are dual-wielding swords and secondarily her bow and arrow.  She is not averse to using magic, but she will use it as a last resort.\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8517/8595893669_c2ac349ef0_b.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8534/8618811886_efa993a768_b.jpg[/img]\r\nAlternate skin using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32986]Mature skin texture and body for UNP and CBBE by Maevan2[/url]\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8375/8597225328_ba789f2f2c.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8231/8597129096_5f2955b86d_b.jpg[/img]\r\n[list]\r\n\r\n[*][u]Race[/u]: Imperial\r\n[*][u]Gender[/u]: Female\r\n[*][u]Leveled[/u]: Yes, with player\r\n[*][u]Follower Location[/u]: in Riften, at Honor Hall Orphanage\r\n[*][u]Is a CharGen Face Preset[/u]: No.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nSolveig Tiplauk is the second to join the Paraestum Clan. I know little about her other than that she is the epitome of \\\"Young Eager Female\\\". She is perhaps Lady Paraestum\\'s best mate and confidant, perhaps because they know what it is like to have an elder sibling. Solveig\\'s sibling is her brother Adelai, who is also part of the Clan.\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8102/8618815290_4e1716feac_c.jpg[/img] \r\nAlternate skin using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32986]Mature skin texture and body for UNP and CBBE by Maevan2[/url]\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8596120657_82117d041a.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8529/8571807335_8ea76ee79d_b.jpg[/img]\r\n[list]\r\n\r\n[*][u]Race[/u]: Imperial\r\n[*][u]Gender[/u]: Male\r\n[*][u]Leveled[/u]: Yes, with player\r\n[*][u]Follower Location[/u]: in Riften, at the Bee and Barb\r\n[*][u]Is a CharGen Face Preset[/u]: No.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nAdelai Tiplauk was brought into the Paraestum Clan through his younger sister, Solveig. From the get-go, I found him to be a bit of a \\\"ladies man\\\"...or at least he fancies himself to be. He has a swagger to him, even when he is fighting. But he takes his battles seriously. \r\n\r\nHe has gotten himself into trouble a few times, ending up in the Riften Jail. Solveig has had to help him out a few times. Though she thinks he has a friendship with Molgrom Twice-Killed, who has been in a cell across from him a few times, and perhaps are cooking up something. Getting him out of the city would probably be good for him, she says, at least to give him something constructive to do. He gets into trouble and she is helping at Honorhall Orphanage to help out Constance.\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8368/8597225244_e2cfd4b8b2.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8371/8572897990_ae709ffa3a_b.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][u]Race[/u]: Wood Elf/Bosmer\r\n[*][u]Gender[/u]: Female\r\n[*][u]Leveled[/u]: Yes, with player\r\n[*][u]Follower Location[/u]:  in Morthal, at the Mooreside Inn \r\n[*][u]Is a CharGen Face Preset[/u]: No.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nYmil (ee-meal) Marigold is a wood elf with a generally good personality. Yet she would rather be doing her own thing. She is a wanderer. But has had time for a few friends, most especially in this group Solveig. They are very close. They may be a couple, but I respectfully do not push them on the subject, because it is not really my business. \r\n\r\nYmil does have a darker side to her and may not be all that she seems, and can be downright animal-like, but she is trustworthy enough. Like the rest of her family, she does all she can to excel at archery.\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8246/8609072772_65466fc2c0_b.jpg[/img]\r\n[color=yellow]NOTE[/color]: I wanted her to have Lycanthropy, to have her become a werewolf every full moon. However my modding skills are poor at the time.  I have not yet learned how to effectively give this trait to her.  Right now I am bowing to better modding minds, using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11459/]Werewolf followers by Brevi[/url] or [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12687]Tales of Lycanthropy - Werewolf Overhaul by Brevi[/url].\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8380/8599330788_90b0a3410c_t.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8512/8596120547_290d0f7a7e.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8517/8571806209_fac74026de_b.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][u]Race[/u]: Khajiit\r\n[*][u]Gender[/u]: Male\r\n[*][u]Leveled[/u]: Yes, with player\r\n[*][u]Follower Location[/u]:  Shrine to Peryite in the mountains west of Karthwasten.\r\n[*][u]Is a CharGen Face Preset[/u]: No.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nKamik Linnsen is a Khajiit and, like most of his race, is more apt to be on the outskirts of town. Here he is at the Shrine to Peryite. It is in the mountains west of Karthwasten or north-east of Markarth, in the Reach, which is pretty remote. Kesh the Clean is there but he doesn\\'t really interact much unless you are doing his bidding. Kamik doesn\\'t like most people but still seems to have a good-nature. He doesn\\'t have a weapon, but will pick up one if he finds one. He is wearing Blades armour, which I believe he took from a dead Blade. I like to think of him as an opportunist.\r\n\r\nHe was brought into the Paraestum Clan through Ymil Marigold. They share similar animalistic tendencies, though he much more than her, and they are at least on familiar terms. In terms of physical stature, he is rather forebodingly tall, especially compared to her. \r\n\r\nHe seems to have a sense of humor and a fair amount of confidence and power. I gave him a Giant\\'s club once and saw him blow a guard across the room. I saw him do similar with his bare hands. I\\'d rather him walk ahead of me than behind. \r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8529/8596120617_0ddb6d9499.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8233/8571806867_a411a5a411_b.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][u]Race[/u]: Redguard\r\n[*][u]Gender[/u]: Female\r\n[*][u]Leveled[/u]: Yes, with player\r\n[*][u]Follower Location[/u]:  in Falkreath, at Dead Man\\'s Drink.\r\n[*][u]Is a CharGen Face Preset[/u]: No.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nOanu can be dredging through the marshes near Hjaalmarch...watching the herd of Mammoth and taunting Giants in any of their camps...or hanging around Falkreath and \\\"waiting on someone\\\", she says. She joined the Parestum Clan by \\\"accident\\\", after Lady Bebe Paraestum saved her from a group of Forsworn. Oanu does not like to be in another\\'s debt.\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8232/8596120519_e076bac8e9.jpg[/img]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/download/1000010750]ApachiiHairFemales[/url]\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8526/8597231614_337b0fd57c.jpg[/img]\r\n[u]This for ultimate multiple follower usage[/u]:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url]\r\n\r\n[u]These mods to get most similar look to the followers[/u]:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563/]Coverwomen[/url] Look#3\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5941/]CoverKhajiit[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24273]Ethereal Elven Overhaul[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27815]Fine Face Textures by Urshi - Men[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25531/]High Res Female Nord Skin[/url]\r\nA new skin I am using is [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32986]Mature skin texture and body for UNP and CBBE by Maevan2[/url]  - Gorgeous\r\n\r\n[u]These for even more immersion into these followers appearances[/u]:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]Dimonized UNP female Body[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21620]HQ Beards - vanilla texture replacer - Improved Dark[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589]Natural Eyes High Res 1_3[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1167]Pretty Lips V2[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28946]Sporty Sexy Sweat Wet Body Skin Texture[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722]The Eyes of Beauty[/url]\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8597225054_94c58c52c7.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[u]Where can I find them?[/u]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][color=yellow]Bebe Paraestum:[/color][i] just southeast of Ivarstead, camped near Lake Geir southwest of Geirmund\\'s Hall[/i]\r\n[*][color=yellow]Solveig Tiplauk:[/color] [i]in Riften, at Honor Hall Orphanage[/i]\r\n[*][color=yellow]Adelai Tiplauk:[/color] [i]in Riften, at the Bee and Barb [/i]\r\n[*][color=yellow]Ymil Marigoldl:[/color] [i]in Morthal, at the Mooreside Inn[/i]\r\n[*][color=yellow]Kamik Linnsen:[/color] [i]at the Shrine to Peryite, in the mountains west of Karthwasten, The shrine is positioned on the top of a cliff above Karthwasten.

Her face should be a preset under the female imperial. To get the precise hair, however, you need to have ApachiiSkyHair (the main file) and choose Female Hair #8.\r\n[*]Marriable: if I did it correct (which isn\\'t certain since I\\'m kind of a \\\"noob\\\") Adelai Tiplauk is marriable.  I fancy him as a mate for Bebe, though he is kind of a rogue compared to her.  Still, it may be good for her; he could get her to relax.\r\n[/list]",
