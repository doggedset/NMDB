  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to the construction Legue&#33; A brand new platform that can take any mod you&#39;ve downloaded for free and put&#39;s adds and paid content all over them.\r<br />\r<br />With the new Construction League, modders can now make the game we wanted to make, but for half the price we&#39;d have to pay an actual studio&#33; We all know that modding adds so much more to our games, patches, extra quests, armor that doesn&#39;t look like it came out of an ikea box, and even main quests that aren&#39;t lackluster and distracted&#33;\r<br />\r<br />We get it, our fans want more, you are holding us to a higher standard and that&#39;s totally fair, but in all honesty the board room meeting really gave us the impression that we didn&#39;t want to put much effort into our next game, so we thought...why not let the FANS make the game they&#39;ve always wanted us to deliver on&#33;\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ve given our Public Relations team a lot to think about, and we&#39;ve thought about it. By delivering all the content of our games like a series of LEGO packets, you can build the best Elder Scrolls experience you&#39;ve always wanted to believe in; The experience we always believed you could make for yourselves and pay us for. So without further ado, we present to you the Creatio- I mean Construction Legue.\r<br />\r<br />The Construction League,\r<br />It&#39;s totally not paid mods.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />FUTUR PLANS:\r<br />\r<br />Upcoming Version 1.1\r<br />-patches\r<br />-paid mods\r<br />-new PR representatives\r<br />-damage control\r<br />-reworking lore\r<br />-extended universe\r<br />-micro transactions\r<br />-horse armor\r<br />-lunch boxes\r<br />-merger with EA",
