  "descriptionHtml": "Hello, I\\'m here to share with you with my setups which allow you play Skyrim with rather comfortable FPS and pretty graphics.\r\n\r\nSo, what I have done:\r\n\r\n1. I set texture quality on high and anisotropic filtering on 16x, because as for me even today\\'s low-end PC could cope with it;\r\n2. Now speaking about shadows. They were the most problem how to make them look pretty nice and don\\'t load system very much. So I preferred low resolution but far LOD distance shadows rather than mid resolution shadows but with very, I\\'ll repeat, VERY short LOD distance. I\\'ve found it quite ugly. Also, I turned on shadows on trees and grass, \\'cos I think it isn\\'t decrease FPS too much;\r\n3. I set resolution on 1024x600, because on my 15.6\\\" screen it looks OK. Of course I could have made resolution 800x600 and it wouldn\\'t have lagged at all but it would have looked too ugly (sorry for too many conjunctive moods :)).\r\n\r\nAnd now a mod which I [i]strongly[/i] recommend you to use to have a performance boost it interiors (like dungeons, ruins, caves etc.):\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=736 (thanks user 747823 for this)\r\nIf you have weak PC like me it would help you quietly. \r\n\r\nAlso if you don\\'t like low quality scenery you could use this mod:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1598 (thanks to user OpticShooter)\r\n\r\nAnd my system configuration is:\r\nCPU: AMD Turion II Dual-Core Mobile M500\r\nVGA: ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4200\r\nRAM: 4 Gb\r\nOS: Win 7 64-bit\r\n\r\nWish you a comfortable game!\r\n\r\nP.S.
