  "descriptionHtml": "I have searched such a long time for a vampire mod that fixes that annoying glitch with the dirt appearing, but so far I\\'ve had no luck. So I decided to just simply edit the texture of the dirt that the vampire gets to make it look like there is no dirt. The upside to this is that there\\'s no way this is going to stop working, the downside is however that NO character will be able to have dirt nr.1 in the game, not such a big issue I think, but that\\'s up to you. Dirt nr.2 and 3 are still normal however.\r\n\r\nIf this glitch happens for females aswell just say so in the description and I will upload a fix for that aswell ;)\r\n\r\nEnjoy, just put the files in your Skyrim\\\\data folder",
