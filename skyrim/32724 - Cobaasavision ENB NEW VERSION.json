  "descriptionHtml": "This is my ENB, many hours have gone into this, lost most of the files after my computer broke, but still I kept going with it! It uses DoF, SMAA, and a whole load of other effects and what-not.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this all started when i started to use ENB\\'s, i could never find one that suited me, some came close but not quite what i wanted, so I made this for myself, after letting some friends use it i decided to just release it and let anyone who likes it to be able to use it.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not saying that this is going to suit everyone, but it suits me for now, but if you\\'re willing to take a chance with it then go ahead and try it out! If you do decide to try this out then i would be very grateful for any screenshots to be uploaded here, I just don\\'t have the time anymore...\r\n\r\nI will be updating this to include user feedback, so anyone ideas just send them my way! Have fun and I hope you like it!\r\n\r\nSome computers will take quite a heavy fps hit, but if the frame hit is too big then go into the readme, there will be instructions on how to remove smaa\r\n\r\nAny ideas for making this ENB better send it to me in a PM!\r\n\r\nCredits go to Boris Vorontsov for the .dll files! he can be found here: http://www.enbdev.com/\r\nAnd Midhras, he helped me get started with ENB\\'s and pointed me in the right direction so if it wasnt for him then this never would\\'ve been started! His ENB can be found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20429",
