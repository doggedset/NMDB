  "descriptionHtml": "[color=green]Gondorian Ranger Armor and Ithilien Ranger Cloak Standalone[/color]\n<br />\n<br />Author: haldir307\n<br />CO-Authors: MartinPurvis, Faelrin and NoseGoblin\n<br />\n<br />[color=Orange]For many times people reporting me the same problems they have when installing with and without NMM, but after my reply it works again, those problems doesn't exist at all in my mods, its happening from their mistake, did not get all the files they need and did wrong installation.\n<br />On the other hand, they may not read the description at all, NOT MY PROBLEM!\n<br />So pay attention because i wont reply anymore for the same subject!\n<br />\n<br />1) First you need to install the Main File and then the Update File, NOT just the Update File!!!\n<br />2) About the Optional File(s), first you need to install the Main File and then the Update File, NOT just the Update File,\n<br />then the Optional File(s) if you want, also NOT just the Optional File(s)!!!\n<br />3) On NMM while overriding a file over the other, it says you \"A different version of **** has been detected. The installed version is, the new version is.\",\n<br />and it asks you \"Would you like to upgrade?\", also it says you \"Selecting NO it will the new Mod normally\", you should click NO and not YES, it will keep the main file and will replace the update files over the main file, same goes for the optional files.\n<br />\n<br />Its not hard to do it so! oo[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=red][[[@To all\n<br />\n<br />Why i changed the Main File's version from 3.0 to 1.0 and the Update File's version from 3.1 to 1.1:\n<br />Because for long time i had deleted the previous versions and makes people wander,\n<br />\"if that is v3 where is v2 and v1?\", so i changed the versions of the new uploaded files.\n<br />In case of downloading and installing with Nexus Mod Manager:\n<br />People who download those files for first time there will be no problem.\n<br />*Those who already have the Main File v3, do not download the new update,\n<br />first uninstall the Main File v3, download and install the Main File v1.0, then download and install\n<br />the Update File v1.1!\n<br />\n<br />If you have issues like that the mod is not working, that the armor is invisible, that the armor doesn't show up in blacksmith or anything else, now i explain what you all do wrong, because i tested and the mod is working great like to all other people who installed it corectly and works great to them too!\n<br />\n<br />What you make wrong is:\n<br />You downloaded only the Update File \"GRA Female version - Ithilien Cloak for male and female\" and installed it, but not first the Main File \"Gondorian_Ranger_Armour\"!\n<br />\n<br />Why you have those issues:\n<br />Because the Main File contains the Meshes and Textures of the male armor only, also the esp file does not have armor rate and its my mistake.\n<br />\n<br />What you have to do is:\n<br />You must first install the Main File and then the Update File to replace the old esp with the new esp, the esp in Update File is fixing the armor rate also adds female armor and missing cloak.\n<br />\n<br />Where are the: armor, gloves, boots, hood, cape and cloak in blacksmith:\n<br />The armor, gloves, boots and hood are in the Leather section, but the cape and cloak are in Misc section.\n<br />\n<br />If you will install like i say, then it will work like to all other people works.]]][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Many thanks to Martin Purvis who gave me the permission to retexture his\n<br />LOTR Ranger Armour and he made the male version into standalone for me.\n<br />Many thanks to doodaboom who gave me the permission to retexture his\n<br />Forest Scout Hood and Forest Scout Cape from his mod Scout Armor,\n<br />also many thanks to Rudyard who made it standalone for me. ^^\n<br />\n<br />[color=green]Gondorian Ranger Bow can be found here:\n<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20417[/color]\n<br />\n<br />On this link can get Martin's Purvis LOTR Ranger Armour\n<br />which is the standalone version of NoseGoblin's mod.\n<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10283\n<br />*Edit: It has been removed by MartinPurvis!\n<br />For the case you do not have it, Nosegoblin's Assassins Rangers and Thieves armor.\n<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4632/?\n<br />\n<br />[color=green]Description:\n<br />Everything is standalone for every race.\n<br />Now and female version, sorry for the delay, but i did not modding about over a year.\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />Extract \"Gondorian_Ranger_Armour\" and copy the folder \"Data\" to Program FilesSteamSteamAppscommonskyrim\n<br />\n<br />Run SkyrimLauncher, click to Data Files and checkmark the empty box of the GondorianRangerArmor.esp,\n<br />checkmark the empty box of Load Loose Files and click OK.\n<br />Attention please, if the Data Files section is grey and isn't working, go to this directory:\n<br />C:Users****DocumentsMy GamesSkyrim\n<br />and open SkyrimPrefs.ini, find the [Launcher] and type under of the last line,\n<br />those two lines exactly like they are:\n<br />bEnableFileSelection=1\n<br />bLoadLooseFiles=1\n<br />Save and close it, go back to SkyrimLauncher and enable the checkmarks i told before,\n<br />you are ready to enjoy the Gondorian Ranger Armor and Ithilien Ranger Cloak.[/color]\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />[color=cyan]Update:\n<br />GRA Female version -
