  "descriptionHtml": "This is my own save game. I have completed the main story line and did quite a few quests. I have lots of good armour and robes and good weapons. My skills are all roughly over 60. And some of them are at 100 including enchanting, smithing, onehanded and destruction.\r\nI have also used some mods including Middas Magic and alot of weapon mods so if your see some weapons in the images that don\\'t appear in your game its because they are mods :)\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS:\r\nExtract the file using winrar (or another tool), search for your skyrim save game folder (for me it was in My document, My Games, Skyrim and then Saves. When you have found the saves folder copy the extracted file to that folder and enjoy :) ",
