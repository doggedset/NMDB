  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wanted Taylor Swift to be in Skyrim?\r<br />\r<br />This mod makes that all possible by going to the Nightingale Inn in The Pale. Taylor Swift can be your follower, and is extremely overpowered. She is listed as essential, wears Elven armour and duel-wields Daedric Daggers. Want to know how overpowered she is? Too bad, you have to see for yourself.\r<br />\r<br />==========REQUIREMENTS==========\r<br />\r<br />-None, just Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />==========NOTES==========\r<br />\r<br />-Taylor Swift also acts as a bard\r<br />-As I noted, she is very, very overpowered\r<br />-This is not Lore-Friendly. Haters please leave.\r<br />-This is my first mod\r<br />\r<br />==========================\r<br />\r<br />Feedback is much appreciated. Enjoy ;)",
