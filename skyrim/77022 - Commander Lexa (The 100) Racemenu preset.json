  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guys&#33;\r<br />As a big &#34;the 100&#34; and Alycia Debnam Carey fan I thought why not combine that and my love for Skyrim to make a character that looks like the 100&#39;s Commander Lexa played by ADC.\r<br />I&#39;ve spent a while on getting her to show up exactly as I wanted and now that I&#39;m finally okay with how it turned out - why not upload?\r<br />\r<br />So here she is: A hopefully lore conform Commander Lexa of the Twelve Clans.\r<br />\r<br />Race: Redguard\r<br />Class: Best played as a light armor build with two 1h weapons&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Hope you&#39;ll like it&#33; :)\r<br />---\r<br />\r<br />[u]You will need these mods to get her to show up exactly as in the screenshots:[/u]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]Racemenu[/url] by expired\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?]KS Hairdos - Renewal[/url] by Kalilies\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?]CBBE[/url] by Caliente\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30/?]No more blocky faces[/url] by Xenius\r<br />\r<br />[u]Warpaint\r<br />[/u]Lexa&#39;s famous warpaint (thanks to whoever invented it&#33;) was designed for Skyrim and brought into the game by myself. I edited the &#34;femalenordwarpaint_01&#34;, since I didn&#39;t know how to make it into its own mod.\r<br />Just download the optional file and place it into &#34;Skyrim/Data/Textures/actors/character/character assets/tintmasks&#34; and click &#34;overwrite&#34;.\r<br />You&#39;ll be fine with that.\r<br />\r<br />[u]How to install:[/u]\r<br />Just place the LexaFinished.jslot into &#34;Skyrim/Data/SKSE/Plugins/CharGen/Presets&#34; and go into your game. \r<br />\r<br />To get her looks on a new character:\r<br />In the racemenu, when starting a new character, just click on Presets, press F9 (load preset) and select &#34;LexaFinished&#34; from the List.\r<br />\r<br />To get her looks onto your current character:\r<br />Open the console (~) and type &#34;showracemenu&#34; to get into the racemenu. In the racemenu click on Presets, press F9 (load preset) and select &#34;LexaFinished&#34; from the List. Press &#34;r&#34; to finish customization and done&#33;",
