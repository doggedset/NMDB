  "descriptionHtml": "This adds a new enemy race called, \\\"Hybrids\\\". They look like werewolves \r\n\r\nand are twice in size of one of them(werewolf). They have a high amount of \r\n\r\nhealth that is 10000 so in order to kill one your going to need a weapon, \r\n\r\ne.g. deadric sword, that has high enchantment. They resist fear so watch \r\n\r\nout if you want to kill it using a fear enchanted weapon. Sadly your going \r\n\r\nto need to use the console to spawn one cause I was lazy to waste time \r\n\r\nplacing one by one around Tamriel. Instructions: open console using ~ key \r\n\r\nbelow the escape key. Then type help hybrid. After that an npc called \r\n\r\nhybrid or hybrids will be listed. So then type, player.placeatme .....\r\n\r\n(code of the hybrid npc). This actually follows the hybrid race file as \r\n\r\nthis new enemy has the same power as Hybrid Breton in hybrid race. So \r\n\r\nspawn one, a couple of guards, around 10, then have a lot of FUN! Caution, \r\n\r\nits attacks are powerful!",
