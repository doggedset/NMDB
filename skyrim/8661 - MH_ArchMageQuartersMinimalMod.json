  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Introduction[/b]\r\nThe purpose of this mod is to change the Arch-Mage Quarters in the College of Winterhold to make it more practical and realistic for those using it as a player home. This is a first mod and by design it makes minimal changes. The Arch-Mage Quarters is a very cluttered frame-rate intensive space it does not need a mass of mannequins, bookshelves and furniture added to it. However some aspects of the original design are very unimaginative - just how many tables with two chairs does one person need?? \r\n\r\nIn making changes the philosophy behind this mod is to offer those using the Arch-Mage area as a home, small quality of life improvements, that are lore-appropriate for an Arch-Mage and do not significantly impact gameplay. It is also a design principle that given how cluttered the area is, that in order not to impact performance, where items are added to the area this should be balanced by deletion of others. \r\n\r\n[b]Warning[/b]\r\n[color=red]This mod replaces the following storage:\r\n[list][*]Sack and Barrel near Alchemy desk\r\n[*]Barrel and ALL the sacks on the edge of the garden area[/list]\r\nAnd the following furniture\r\n[list][*]Chairs and table opposite the wardrobe[/list]\r\n[b]BE SURE AND REMOVE ANY ITEMS YOU WANT TO KEEP FROM THESE CONTAINERS BEFORE DOWNLOADING THIS MOD OTHERWISE THEY WILL BE PERMANENTLY LOST[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[b]Summary[/b]\r\nThis mod makes the following minor tweaks:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]General Purpose vendor (College Treasurer) added to the area enabling quick purchase and selling off items. Occasionally sells black soul gems. It is my intention the frequency reflect their status as rare and expensive objects and is likely to be subject to further tweaking.\r\n\r\n[*]A small desk with writing implements and a few appropriate items upon it to increase immersion including a small box to store documents. \r\n\r\n[*]Labelled storage around the Alchemy and Enchanting stations. For RP purposes I can never think of a sack as a suitable container for multiple types of ingredient thus I prefer not to use those or barrels. Equally the satchels tend to prove fiddly. Hence a discrete chest on the bottom shelf near the alchemy table. There is also a small box for storing soul gems above the Enchanting table. \r\n\r\n[*]Other organized storage is included in a book shelf loaded with chests against a wall, replacing a table. This includes one NON-SAFE chest, ie the items in eventually respawn, which has some special mage items for enchanting. These are low-value clothing items with zero armor rating and so will not endanger the mage armor perk. There are two sets of hand wear, a version of the gloves used in the Out of Balance quest and one resembling Daedric Gauntlets for the mage in need of something fiercer looking. Both these can be enchanted, removing a major difficulty for mages the lack of availability of anything which they can wear on their hands which they can enchant. Just for good measure I have included a non-enchanted version of the Arch-Mage robes should anyone wish to put their own alternative enchants on it. \r\n\r\n[*]Reception Desk added in corridor area which is jointly staffed by a new Receptionist NPC and a Security Guard NPC at different times. No longer can people interrupt the Arch-Mage without warning.\r\n\r\n[*]I have included one mannequin which by default shows the Arch-Mage\\'s robes.\r\n[/list]\r\nVersion 2 of this mod introduces additional storage area. Currently it is not intended to make any more changes to the original Arch-Mage quarters area.\r\n\r\n[b]Recommended Other Mods to use with this one[/b]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=766]Archmage variants[/url] (best-looking of the alternative Arch-Mage robes)\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7484]Sexy Winterhold College [/url](retextured college)\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=746]No NPC Greetings (Reduced distance version)[/url] (makes all npc interactions less spammy)\r\n\r\n[i]Compatible With[/i]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9053]Drakespire Arch-Mage\\'s Office[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Possible Future Changes[/b]\r\nConversion of one or more of the new NPCs to followers\r\nAdditional students in college to walk to reception area and through college areas\r\nExtra Scenarios including ones with substantial book storage and full crafting facilities\r\n\r\nPlease note I am not an artist and have no access to retextured work. The bench might not be the most appropriate set up for the desk but it is one of the few structures which allows backing out. I have not been able to find any true desks in game, even those in the Thalmor embassy are actually cupboards with pretensions. \r\n\r\n[b]CHANGES MADE BY THIS MOD:[/b]\r\nAlters the vendors levelled list in order to enable black soul gems to be sold\r\nDeletes 5 sacks, 3 chairs and 2 barrels from the Arch Mage area\r\nDeletes 1 bench from the corridor area of the Arch-Mage quarters\r\n\r\nReuses a number of major lore figures and items. Hence has the potential to break quests though it has been carefully handled and precautions taken. Please report any problems\r\n\r\n[b]KNOWN BUGS[/b]\r\nBook script activates regardless of position in Arch-Mage quest chain. Will be corrected to work only after you have become Arch-Mage in a future release. ",
