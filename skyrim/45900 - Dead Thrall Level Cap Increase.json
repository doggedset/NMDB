  "descriptionHtml": "TL;DR Simple change of the magnatude for Dead Thrall. The only change is the level cap. No new spells or clever gameplay overhauls.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter playing thousands of hours of Skyrim you would think i would remember there is a level cap on Dead Thrall. But no, i forgot.\r\n\r\nSo when i made a Necromancer, the first since forever, i was horrified when i realised DT is USELESS after level 40.\r\n\r\nI searched high and low for a mod that would lift the level cap. I didn't want new spells or a complete conjuration/necromancy overhaul. I just wanted the level cap raised.\r\n\r\nAs i was having internet problems meant i was having Steam problems, which meant the ******* Creation Kit wouldn't open so i could do it myself.\r\n\r\nI finally managed to get th CK open and seconds later i had changed the level cap.\r\n\r\nWeeks of annoyance over!",
