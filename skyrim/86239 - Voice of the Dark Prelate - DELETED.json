  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is the result of putting a lot of time and effort in order to bring you the unique Skyrim experience. This is just the beginning of my grand Skyrim project which will be released in the future, so you can call it a prototype mod for playing fully voiced characters from your favorite games. This is just a sound mod, but I made sure to combine it with some other mods out there and to make something really special out of it. \r<br />\r<br />1) WHAT THIS MOD DOES ?\r<br />\r<br />It makes your character sound like Zeratul from Starcraft universe. \r<br />\r<br />2) REQUIREMENTS\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72039/?]PC Headtracking and Voice Type[/url]\r<br />\r<br />3) HOW TO INSTALL ?\r<br />\r<br />Install the mod above first, then simply download my file and put it inside Skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />4) HOW TO USE ?\r<br />\r<br />Open MCM, find Headtracking mod, set your desired configuration, enable B.Y.O. voice in the right panel, and you are good to go. If you want to know more about PC Headtracking and Voice Type, visit the mod page to learn everything you need.\r<br />\r<br />Sound is triggered by taking one of the following actions:\r<br />\r<br />- Sitting in a chair\r<br />- Sneaking\r<br />- Waiting/Sleeping\r<br />- Combat (bleeding out, sheathing weapon while entering combat, losing percentage of health, dying, after killmove, etc..)\r<br />- Casting invisibility spell\r<br />- Being healed by follower (google for mods which enable this)\r<br />- Leveling up\r<br />- Greeting NPCs (hello and goodbye) [color=red]Mapped to desired button in MCM, triggers automatically if SPEAKER is enabled(Check MCM mod options)[/color]  \r<br />- Random speech [color=red]Mapped to desired button in MCM[/color]  \r<br />\r<br />5) THE MOST IMPORTANT PART &#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Install these mods, because without them, it&#39;s gonna be like swimming in the pool just beside the sunny beach and the sea water, if you catch my meaning. While they are not required for this mod to work, they pretty well add up to it. Here are the mods:\r<br />\r<br />1. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=612760596&searchtext=]Legacy of the Void \r<br />[/url]2. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33001/?]Improved Psi Blades - Master Blade[/url]\r<br />3. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53641/?]Jaxonz Blink Teleport[/url]\r<br />\r<br />6) ENJOY &#33;\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: [color=yellow]This is just a.. well... you can call it a preview of what I&#39;m going to release. I thought about posting my progress here, but it would just spoil the fun. Next things will be my own creations, which will include either armor parts or full player models, maybe even new races etc..[/color]  \r<br />\r<br />[u]***Audio source for this mod: [url=https://www.youtube.com/]www.youtube.com[/url].
