And yet Skyrim is NOT brutal, at least not after a certain point in the game. Dovahkiin just simply becomes too strong, if you have a decent build. My mod aims to rebalance Skyrim so that it is a challenge both at low level and high. I have done this by preventing Dovahkiin from becoming demi-god like in his/her abilities. How have I done this? Read on!\r\n\r\nLong Description:\r\n\r\n1) Races, Actors & Player Character\r\n2) Combat Mechanics\r\n3) Magic\r\n4) Perks\r\n5) List of Game Settings Changes\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://imageshack.us/scaled/large/837/logosectioncombat.png[/img]\r\n\r\nCOMBAT\r\n1a - Mechanics\r\nThere have been many changes to how combat works.\r\nBleeding Damage: Now enemies bleed when struck with weapons. Bleeding stacks, and lasts 10 seconds per strike. Therefore, faster strikes means more bleeding, making Daggers much more formidable against flesh-and-blood targets.\r\nArmor Running: Now running in armor will slow you down significantly. An approximation is that someone in Heavy Armor can sprint as fast as a person in clothing can jog. Light armor affects you as well, but not nearly as much as Heavy Armor\r\nArmor Ratings: Armor ratings work different from Vanilla. Basically, 1 point of armor will reduce incoming damage by one point now, but Armor ratings display as much smaller numbers than vanilla Skyrim. \r\nHeavy Armor: The protection gap between light armor and heavy armor has been increased. This means Heavy Armor will protect you MUCH better than an equivalent tier light armor, but the tradeoff is it will slow you down.\r\nSkill point value: Skill points are more important in deciding the overall damage your character can deal and withstand, than in vanilla.\r\n\r\n1b - Weapons\r\n-Melee Weapons\r\n\tMelee weapons had an unrealistic range in vanilla Skyrim. They were able to strike targets beyond their physical reach. I have lowered all these ranges to be realistic.\r\n\tSwords: -15% range\r\n\tWar Axes: -20% range (seems harsh, but War Axes are short!)\r\n\tMaces: -15% range, -13% speed\r\n\tDaggers: -15% range\r\nAll Two Handeds: -12% range\r\n\r\n-Ranged Weapons\r\nBow and Arrow combat is now significantly different than vanilla. I practice Archery in real life, so while I cannot exactly explain how all my changes add up to increased realism, you\\'ll just have to take my word that Archery is now more realistic.\r\n\tHunting Bow: \tCrt +1 (4), +18% spd (1.14), +5% stagger\r\n\tLong Bow: \t+4 dam (10), +1 wt (6), -25% spd (0.85), +35% stagger\r\n\tImperial Bow: \t+2 dam (11), Crt +1 (5), -24% spd (0.75), +40% stagger\r\n\tAnc. Nord Bow: +2 dam (10),  -20% spd (0.7), +50% stagger\r\n\tOrcish Bow:\t+1 dam (11), +20% stagger\r\n\tDwarven Bow: +3 dam (15), -50% spd (0.38), +90% stagger\r\n\tElven Bow:\t-4 dam (9), +31% spd (0.9), +10% stagger\r\n\tFalmer Bow:\t-2 dam (10), +25% stagger\r\n\tForsworn Bow:\t-5 dam (7), +43% spd (1.25),\r\n\tGlass Bow: No Changes\r\n\tEbony Bow: +17% spd, +40% stagger\r\n-Arrows\r\n\tArrows have been tweaked as well.\r\n\tIron: \t\tRenamed to \\\"Arrow\\\", -7 dam (1.0)\r\n\tAnc. Nord: \t-9 dam (1.0)\r\n\tFalmer:\t\t-6 dam (1.0), no monetary value\r\n\tSteel Arrow: \t-9.75 dam (1.25)\r\n\tOrcish:\t\t-9 dam (1.35)\r\n\tForsworn:\t-5.5 dam (1.5), no monetary value\r\n\tElven:\t\t-14 dam (2.0), +7 value\r\n\tDwarven:\t-10.5 dam (3.5), +4 value \r\n\tGlass: \t\t-13.5 dam (4.5), +10 value, destroyed on contact (!)\r\n\tNord Hero:\t-19 dam (5.0)\r\n\tEbony:\t\t-15 dam (5.0), +20 value (due to extreme rarity)\r\n\tDaedric:\t-14 dam (10.0), +42 value (due to extreme rarity)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://imageshack.us/scaled/large/577/logosectionraces.png[/img]\r\n\r\nPLAYABLE RACES\r\nMade default Health, Magicka, and Stamina for playable races = 50\r\nMade default Carry Weight = 100\r\nRemove health regeneration in combat.\r\nPowers/Racial Abilities were unmodified unless otherwise mentioned.\r\nUsed a simple racial stats formula based on starting skill bonuses:\r\nArgonian - 50h, 60m, 70s, 100cw\r\n\t+15 natural armor rating (due to having scales)\r\n\r\nBreton - 50h, 80m, 55s \r\n\tBetter than average Magicka regen\r\n\tStarts with a weak Heal spell\r\n\r\nDark Elf - 50h, 75m, 60s\r\n\tStarts with Flames\r\n\r\nHigh Elf - 50h, 85m, 50s\r\n\tBest Magicka regen\r\n\tStarts with Sparks & Fury\r\n\r\nImperial - 65h, 70m, 50s\r\n\r\nKhajiit - 60h, 55m, 70s\r\n\tWorse than average Magicka regen\r\n\tBest Stamina regen\r\n\r\nNord - 75h, 50m, 60s\r\n\tWorst Magicka regen\r\n\tHas Berserk rather than Battle Cry\r\n\tCarry Weight +25\r\n\r\nOrc - 80h, 55m, 50s\r\n\tCarry Weight +35\r\n\tBetter than average Stamina regen\r\n\tHas Battle Cry rather than Berserk\r\n\r\nRedguard - 70h, 55m, 55s\r\n\tCarry Weight +10\r\n\r\nWood Elf - 50h, 55m, 80s\r\n\tCarry Weight -10\r\n\tCombat Health regeneration while in nature (e.g. in the Tamriel worldspace)\r\n\tCan draw Long Bows & Hunting Bows 15% faster (stacks with the Perks)\r\n\r\nVampires\r\n\tDouble health vs non-Vampires of the same race\r\n\t+100 Carry Weight vs non-Vampires of the same race\r\n\tCombat Health regeneration\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://imageshack.us/scaled/large/15/logosectionperks.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://imageshack.us/scaled/large/23/logosectionmagicj.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://imageshack.us/scaled/large/16/logosectiongmsts.png[/img]\r\n\r\n",
