  "descriptionHtml": "Good Shield, Biggest in the game as far as I\\'m aware.\r\nThe only thing, can\\'t be upgraded properly! The smithing perks do not effect it.\r\n\r\nI changed that so it can now be upgraded properly with the steel smithing perk and I also removed the enchant.\r\nI just prefer to use my own enchantment.\r\n\r\nI left the defence at 30 base. This is still a pretty solid number and the shield itself is massive so it provides a good defence against projectiles.\r\n",
