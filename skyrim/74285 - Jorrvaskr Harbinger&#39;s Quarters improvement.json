  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes Harbinger&#39;s Quarters in Jorrvaskr to be more livable with plenty of custom storage and a secret room.\r<br />\r<br />Plan for this mod was to create a proper living quarters for my Companion character with enough storage to store all loot and to stay close to vanilla look of this place.\r<br />\r<br />All items in Harbinger&#39;s room are now static with few exceptions (daedra heart, giant&#39;s toe and 2 books on the table - those items are lootable with disabled havok). Display cases, wardrobe and suspicious cabinet requires a key which is located in final room of Ysgramor&#39;s Tomb. You can now store weapons in display cases.\r<br />All containers are set to CompanionsHarbingerFaction so before you became Harbinger it counts as stealing. Most of containers contains items from leveled list just to not make it too empty.\r<br />Bed gives well rested bonus.\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s a secret room containing alchemy and enchanting stations with storage for ingredients, potions, poisons, recipes, soul gems and regular chest. There&#39;s also weapons rack for few weapons.\r<br />\r<br />In bedroom there&#39;s wardrobe with separate containers for armor, helmets, gauntlets, clothes and boots. \r<br />\r<br />In study there are containers for weapons, books, scrolls, journals, notes, crafting supplies, food, dishes and regular strongbox.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />All containers are safe. There shouldn&#39;t be any problems if you install it during Companions questline. It&#39;s fully navmeshed. Cleaned with TES5Edit.",
