  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Hunting Grounds\r<br />Version: 1.0\r<br />Date: 2/25/2013\r<br />Category: Items, Objects and Clothes\r<br />Author(s): Kewin568\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]0-m1bU5RiPY[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />History\r<br />=======\r<br />v1.00, 2013/02/25:\r<br />- Initital release.\r<br />\r<br />v1.01, 2013/02/25:\r<br />- Fixed filepath.\r<br />\r<br />v1.02, 2013/02/26:\r<br />- Removes foxes, which makes the deers and elks docile.\r<br />- Changed the sky into a bloodmoon (while keeping the light and clearity, don&#39;t know if better, willing to change)\r<br />\r<br />Requirements\r<br />===========\r<br />It&#39;s not really required, but without Skyrim Flora Overhaul Summer Edition you&#39;ll be dissapointed in the overall look of the Hunting Grounds as I&#39;ve placed different types of foliage that without the mod has different seasoned looks. Although this is just a personal preferance.\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/141\r<br />\r<br />Locations\r<br />========\r<br />- The horn (which works like a portal device into the grounds) can be found on Hircines Shrine in Glenmoril Coven.\r<br />- The deer skull mask can be found infront of Hircines Shrine inside the hunting grounds, the place you arrive.\r<br />- Ernsts outfit and two variations of his hat can be found in his drawer, inside Ernsts shack.\r<br />- The Dragonslayer set is being held by the mannequin, although the set is not defaultly equiped to it.\r<br />\r<br />Details\r<br />=======\r<br />Do you feel a lack of Hircine-related mods? Are you in need of some relaxing gamehunting under the watchfull gace of the greatest daedric prince? Well look no further&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod takes you to Hircines daedric realm called the &#34;Hunting Grounds&#34;. Here you can find a bosmer hunter companion, two new sets of armor and Hircines deer skull mask. As a bonus the grounds itself looks pretty amazing (Remember the requirements for it to look it&#39;s amazingeztz&#33;).\r<br />\r<br />Content\r<br />=======\r<br />- A new companion called &#34;Ernst Hoodway&#34; (can you guess from which two names I got my inspiration?)\r<br />- The Dragonslayer armor set (no female version)\r<br />- Ernsts Hunting outfit, a remodel of Iorveths armor (no female version)\r<br />- Ernsts Hat, a Robin Hood hat lookalike&#33; \r<br />- A new Icebucket mesh for modders (has no collision atm, cuz imma lazy boi)\r<br />- A new Hircine statue mesh resource (no collision, same reason)\r<br />\r<br />Install\r<br />=======\r<br />1. Extract all the files to your &#39;Skyrim&#92;data&#92;&#39; folder.\r<br />2. Start the Skyrim Launcher, click &#39;Data Files&#39;, place a checkmark beside the .esp file.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall\r<br />=========\r<br />1. Start the Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file.\r<br />2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod. (meshes&#92;KORs Meshes, textures&#92;KORs Textures and last scripts&#92;KORsHornTeleportScript)\r<br />2.1. If you have other mods that I&#39;ve created, their files are most likely located in these folders aswell, so be carefull of which files you delete.\r<br />\r<br />Incompatibility\r<br />===============\r<br />I don&#39;t know of any possible incompatibility issues at this point.\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues or Bugs\r<br />====================\r<br />-There are clipping issues with some of the armors.\r<br />-There is no female version of the armors (and I don&#39;t have any plans of implementing it at this point, there are enough female armors around already, hehe.)\r<br />Anyway, since I only play male characters myself, I really lack the skill in creating a goodlooking female version. If someone wants to create it though, they can upload it freely to the Nexus or better yet; contact me and I&#39;ll add it and give you full credit&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Contact\r<br />=======\r<br />You can contact me on the Nexus under Kewin568.\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />=======\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r<br />Thanks to the Nexus for this amazing site.\r<br />Thanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\r<br />Thanks to L0rd0fWar for Iorveths armor.\r<br />\r<br />Tools Used\r<br />==========\r<br />7-Zip - http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=15579\r<br />Blender - http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=12248\r<br />NIFSkope - http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope\r<br />Photoshop - http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/\r<br />Readme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r<br />\r<br />Licensing/Legal\r<br />===============\r<br />You can do whatever you want with this mod but all I ask in return is that\r<br />you give me credit if you distribute any part of this mod.",
