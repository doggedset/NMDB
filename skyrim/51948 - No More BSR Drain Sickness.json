  "descriptionHtml": "Who likes [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17077/?]Belua Sanguinare Revisited[/url], show of hands? Yeah? Me too&#33; There&#39;s one small problem that I never liked about it though....\r<br />\r<br />DRAIN SICKNESS.\r<br />\r<br />It makes the mod unplayable in Dragonborn, and very annoying elsewhere.\r<br />\r<br />THE FIX\r<br />\r<br />The way the feeding script was *supposed* to work was (with many omissions) first it checked if the person was essential, or if they were used in a known quest. If they were, then the script checked if the person had Drain Sickness. If they had it, you got the message and lack of sustenance due to the sickness. If not, you got fed, and once you finished, they got Drain Sickness put on them.\r<br />\r<br />This of course meant that you couldn&#39;t feed on, for instance, Jarl Balgruuf more than one time and have it be any kind of beneficial. Breakdown:\r<br />\r<br />1. You initiate the feeding.\r<br />2. Check for essential/quest importance.\r<br />3. Checks for Drain Sickness.\r<br />4. Lose hunger, gain stats in vamp journal.\r<br />5. NPC gets Drain Sickness.\r<br />6. Feeding stops.\r<br />\r<br />Pretty clever on MM&#39;s part, however, he messed up. Like I say, the part of the code that slapped on Drain Sickness was way too early in the coding, meaning this happened instead:\r<br />\r<br />1. You initiate the feeding.\r<br />2. Check for essential/quest importance.\r<br />3. NPC gets Drain Sickness.\r<br />4. Checks for drain Sickness.\r<br />5. Lose hunger, gain stats in vamp journal. (Except, you don&#39;t, &#39;cause they&#39;re Down with the Sickness. Yes, I went there.)\r<br />6. Feeding stops.\r<br />\r<br />Simple enough fix, once you know what to look for, and you can feel free to fix it yourself, or use this mod to keep the original files within NMM if you want.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />NMM:\r<br />Download with Manager, activate, say yes to overwrite (only one, cause there&#39;s only one file :) )\r<br />\r<br />MANUAL:\r<br />Download, unzip, place scripts folder in the Data folder itself, yes to merge, yes to overwrite.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />FAQ:\r<br />What&#39;s this compatible with?\r<br />Whatever [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17077/?]Belua Sanguinare Revisited[/url] version 1.3.9.3 is compatible with.\r<br />\r<br />Will this break my game?\r<br />No, it&#39;ll fix it. You&#39;re welcome.\r<br />\r<br />What does this mod do, exactly?\r<br />Read above.\r<br />\r<br />Why are you so sexy?\r<br />It&#39;s a gift, both blessing and curse.\r<br />\r<br />Will you upload more mods?\r<br />Probably, but I usually only like to fix the little irksome stuff, hence the &#34;No More&#34; prefix to my mod names. Speaking of which....\r<br />\r<br />My other mod:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29542/?]No More Blindness[/url]\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS:\r<br />\r<br />MofoMojo and Jackisthe for a fantastic vampire overhaul\r<br />Bethesda for a fantastic game\r<br />Myself for a fantastic idea (that was subtle, wasn&#39;t it?)\r<br />\r<br />Legal Crap:\r<br />\r<br />I upload this mod with the full intent only to fix a broken piece of code within a previously existing mod. Should the author(s) of Belua Sanguinare Revisited take any issue with my uploading this fix, they may contact me here on the Nexus site, and I will take this mod down immediately upon request.\r<br />\r<br />BY USING THIS MOD YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING:\r<br />You will not share, distribute, disseminate, or otherwise re-upload this mod, or any parts therein, elsewhere without my express permission. Should it come to be that I am not available to give this permission, you will not do any of the aforementioned actions in any event, case, or happenstance.",
