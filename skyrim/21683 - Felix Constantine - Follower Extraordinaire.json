He has a younger sister, Aemilia. \r\n\r\nHis father, Gallio Constantine,  was officially a diplomat for Cyrodiil in many countries of Tamriel prior to the White-Gold Concordat. Unofficially, he was a spy. When the treaty was signed, he was transfered to the office of a liason with the Aldmery Dominion, where he continued his primary line of work of gathering intelligence. His mother, Annthea, was a head of a charity organization helping orphan children. \r\n\r\nGallio had a passion for collecting artifacts, both well-known and obscure. The collection fascinated young Felix, and he would spend hours trying to figure out the properties of the unidentified objects. That was how he realized he was pretty powerful in magic.\r\n\r\nDespite the political turmoil, Felix\\'s life was happy and quiet all through his childhood and most of his adolescence. However, this peaceful life was shattered in 4E 192, when his father vanished in the middle of the night. Following his disappearance, several burglaries of the family mansion occurred within one week. Nothing was taken, except for some of the artifacts from the collection. The office where his father worked denied involvement with his disappearance, they also refused to release any information about the cases he worked on or the names of his contacts. However, Felix managed to sneak into his father\\'s office and take all of his notes and journals. Everything was written in cypher, but Felix managed to crack parts of the code - enough to give him some names and locations. He left his mother in Aemilia\\'s care and embarked on a journey to find his father and return the missing artifacts, feeling the two are connected. \r\n\r\nAnd now, several years later his leads brought him to Skyrim. Despite the hardships of the recent years, Felix remains optimistic and amicable. He enjoys traveling in company and makes friends easily. He has a light and jovial character, but is fiercely loyal to his friends and loved ones.[/color]\r\n\r\n[img] http://rookery9.aviary.com.s3.amazonaws.com/15529500/15529996_e78a.png [/img]\r\n[color=#cc9933] [list]\r\n[*]He\\'s very good looking\r\n[*]Higher stature\r\n[*]Essential\r\n[*]Autoleveled up to 80\r\n[*]Doesn\\'t affect stealth meter \r\n[*]A lot of new perks\r\n[*]Changes clothes (apprentice destruction robes) as default outfit and a hide armor set in the inventory \r\n[*]Complex AI (search well for him before you complain that you can\\'t find him!)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[img] http://rookery9.aviary.com.s3.amazonaws.com/15530000/15530042_72c0.png [/img]\r\nHe lives in the Bannered Mare tavern in Whiterun, so you can find him there from 20:00 till 9:00 (you might need to search the tavern). \r\nHe goes to the Whiterun Market 9:00- 12:00. \r\nHe helps to \\\"heal\\\" people in the Whiterun Temple of Kynareth 12:00-20:00.\r\n\r\n[img] http://rookery9.aviary.com.s3.amazonaws.com/15530000/15530081_2118.png [/img]\r\nChain Lightning \r\nLightning Bolt\r\nLightning Cloak\r\nFireball \r\nFirebolt \r\nFlames \r\nIncinerate \r\nFlame Cloak \r\nIce Spike \r\nIce Storm \r\nWards: Lesser, Greater, Steadfast \r\nOak Flesh \r\nStone Flesh  \r\nHealing, Fast healing, Grand healing\r\nClose Wounds \r\nHeal Other \r\nHealing Hands \r\nInvisibility \r\nWaterbreathing\r\n\r\n[img] http://rookery9.aviary.com.s3.amazonaws.com/15530000/15530120_5b33.png [/img]\r\nStealth (ranks 1-8)\r\nMuffled Movement \r\nLight Loot\r\nCustom Fit\r\nQuiet Casting\r\nDestruction (ranks 1-10)\r\nDestruction Dual Casting\r\nAugmented Flames, Frost and Shock (ranks 1-6)\r\nImpact\r\nDeep Freeze\r\nAgile Defender (ranks 1-8)\r\nRestoration (ranks 1-10)\r\nRestoration Dual Casting\r\nRegeneration\r\nAlteration (ranks 1-5)\r\nAlteration Dual Casting\r\nMagic Resistance (ranks 3-7) [/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=#ff9999]THE CONTENT WILL LIKELY BE UPDATED, SO STAY TUNED! :)\r\n\r\nURSHI IS THE BRAIN BEHIND THE MOD, REALLY, I JUST MADE IT LOOK PRETTY. ;)[/color][/b]\r\n\r\n[b][color=#cc3300]IMPORTANT!\r\nThe mod uses face and eye textures from these mods:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1971]Smooth Faces for Ladies and Gents[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3424]Pretty Eyes[/url]\r\n[/b][/color]\r\n",
