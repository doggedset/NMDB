  "modName": "Room of Mannequins",
  "summary": "room full of mannequins, weapon+shield racks, and some storage chests",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#00ff00]Update 8/17:[/color] Added weapon racks beside the mannequins, with my little personal idea of a shield holder on the lower half (in my opinion, looks better than the mannequin holding it. If you&#39;d rather your mannequins hold shields, just don&#39;t use it I won&#39;t mind) As well as 8 chests, 2 on each side of the room. Overwriting previous ESP should just add these things and keep your mannequin army suited up ready for battle, I mean, display&#33;&#33; [color=#00ffff]:D[/color]\r<br />If not, just place old file back and collect the armor before updating.\r<br />\r<br />-No teleport spell...yet. I don&#39;t know scripting D: There&#39;s a video tutorial, but I currently only have mobile data internet... and I&#39;d have to watch in HD to read the text=lots of data I can&#39;t spare. Eventually I&#39;ll add it, but not anytime soon, sorry guys. If some rogue scriptor wants to script a teleport to/from spell for this mod, that would be awesomesauce&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]Description:[/color] 80 mannequins, 80 weapon+shield racks, 8 chests. Located just outside of Markarth to the south, over the stream.\r<br />\r<br />By request, and additions by request,\r<br />Need something? Just ask.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700]Warning:[/color] Mannequins are creepy and might move around on their own or strike random poses. I did what I could to prevent that. Putting armor on them will put them back in place if so. Also don&#39;t save/load game inside the room, it&#39;ll be like Andy walking in on a Toy Story party. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]Bugs:[/color] \r<br />-I don&#39;t know how stable a room full of armor and weapons will be... leaving-saving-reload-entering should fix some things.\r<br />-If you run into ghosts: there is some weird collision bug, like the mannequins moved around invisibly, leaving their skin... I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on&#33; D: But Visually, room looks fine, so I&#39;m personally not worried about it.",
