This requires no DLC and is fully navmeshed. I had kind of forgotten about it, but I found it today and I think it&#39;s good enough to be released. It was a lot of work, after all&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Located near Lake Ilinalta, Banehallow Camp is a roomy player home for the outlaw who is looking for a base of operations. It has all crafting stations including a smelter, a nice cooking area, sleeping, reading and torture rooms (that last one was part of the request and I&#39;m not very good at making evil stuff, so hope that doesn&#39;t disappoint), as well as a vault protected by a double door where you can store your loot. The master bedroom has a shelf to display your most prized treasure, and a grate that leads to an escape door in case of danger.\r<br />\r<br />It includes a visible map marker for you to travel to your new home, and a group of bandits who are essential and will be happy to follow you on your raids.\r<br />\r<br />izon87604 has also made a wonderful video review for your enjoyment - thank you&#33; \r<br />[youtube]-027ToKYTcA[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#39;SteamSteamAppsCommonSkyrimData&#39; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
