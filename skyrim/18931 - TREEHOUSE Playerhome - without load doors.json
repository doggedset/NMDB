  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a playerhome to the game, which is implemented into Skyrim, so you don\\'t have to go through load-doors.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about this playerhome (as you can see in the screens): It\\'s a treehouse !\r\n\r\nI did not put things like mannequins, shrines or an alchemy lab into the home.\r\nYou can only find some Barrels/Chest and a cooking-place and of course a place to sleep (look at screens)\r\n",
