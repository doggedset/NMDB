  "descriptionHtml": "Alessandra Bellamorte Vampiric Follower\r\n\r\nTwo Versions: Temptress and Bitten Peasant - Pick your poison... :) \r\n\r\nA standalone version of my Bitten Peasant can be found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17651\r\n\r\n\tThanks for downloading my Alessandra mod. She\\'s a level 20 Vampire that will return to the Hall of the Dead in Riften when you dismiss her. She was formerly the Priestess of Arkay there. Still have to do her quest but you can take her with you now. She also should be able to be married but I have not tried it. I will warn you now Alessandra is like my Illia mod which involves a little more interaction to get her to follow you again once you dismiss her. This is mainly due to the fact she\\'s not supposed to be a follower. You will know when she is not following you anymore. She will start insulting you in an echoed voice. She will call you things like Melon Nose and Skeever Breath. lol \r\n\r\nStats: I have given her Calculated mechanics at level 20 or you can chose Auto Level See screen shots for her perks and spells. \r\nInventory: Her standard inventory in-game NO CLOTHES!!! She will appear nude. \r\nVoice: Same as in-game\r\nHair: Custom Blue Black (Temptress) or Dirty Blonde (Bitten) coloring by me with styles by (*)Apachii SkyHair\r\nEyes: Ice Blue (*)RANs Eyeliner Replacer - v1_0\r\nFace: (*)Bella\\'s Better Female Faces - Makeup Version 1 with No Shine\r\nBody: (*)Dimonized UNP or CBBEv3 (I use (*)Navtsea\\'s body mod over it for more muscle tone, better seams and better looking genitalia.), (*)Glosstech v05 No Shine.\r\n\r\nIf there is an (*) Asterisk by the named mods above downloading these files will help make her look like my mod in the images I uploaded.\r\n\r\nI am including a follower bat file within the mod it will be installed into your data folder with the plugins if installed with the NMM. You only need to use the (bat follower) console command one time. After you dismiss her you need to use the console command to setrelationshiprank player 4 again for her to follow you. Theoretically if you marry her this should stop but console commands for marriage will probably have to be used they are included in her faction makeup so hopefully it will work.\r\n\r\n***Using the Bat File is simple. place the \\\"Follower\\\" file in your Skyrim Data file and then in-game hit ~ for the console and simply click on Alessandra \\'s character so her number appears and then type in console \\\"bat follower\\\" (without quotation marks) and you are done. She will follow you all over and then return to the Hall of the Dead in Riften when you dismiss her.*** (NOTE) You will still have to type (setrelationshiprank player 4 ) after you use the bat file (one time) to make her follow you and stop any odd behavior like the insults. \r\n\r\nGetting her to display properly: \r\n\r\nInstall ApachiiShyhair - Many people forget to do this and it is required for this mod!\r\n\r\nUse the right body type! If you are using CBBEV3 in game use the CBBE file, if you are using the UNP body use that file.\r\n\r\nOnce you install my mod you will need to start your game and go to the Hall of the Dead in Riften. You will find Alessandra there nude possibly with her head floating above her body and a discolored face. The fix for this is below. \r\n\r\nOpen Console (~) Click on Alessandra anywhere to show her Ref ID Number. Type in Console Temptress (setnpcweight 79) and (Temptress (setscale 99) and Bitten Peasant is (70 and .98). Now do a NEW save game and then close Skyrim. Restart Skyrim and she should now be perfect! :) \r\n\r\nMy take on Makeup on Female and Male NPC\\'s not being \\\"Lore Friendly\\\"\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of people playing this game that think the use of make-up is not lore friendly and so they are hesitant about using character mods like mine that use makeup or beautification mods. I would ask you to consider these following historical tidbits in relation to being lore friendly. Makeup is documented to have been used by the Ancient Egyptians over 3,500 years ago by paleontologists. Makeup was also documented to be in use by the Greeks, Romans and other ancient societies, including tribal body and face painting by Ancient Briton and Germanic tribes. To me it is completely plausible for makeup to be used in Skyrim given Bethesda supplied it and used it in the game on its own NPC\\'s. Inescapably Skyrim\\'s lore is tied to our history in some way shape or form, the latest \\\"trend\\\" of having NPC\\'s look more natural is more likely a current trend in modern use of makeup and not a direct reflection on the lore of this game or any game that that bases its lore partially on human medieval and ancient history. It is inarguable that Skyrim spans the times from early man to the late 16th century with the various in-game elements it provides us. Note the use of mammoths and saber tooth cats and then fast forward to some of the more modern items in the game such as steel bear traps (which were recorded to be first in use in the late 16th century). It is perfectly fine and period to this game to have your characters kicking ass in black eyeliner, eye shadow and red lipstick. Don\\'t let someone tell you it isn\\'t lore friendly because it really is. Given the choices of races we have in Skyrim it may not only be lore friendly but very plausible on some characters depending on their status and rank within their society. In the end it is completely your choice on how you want your NPC\\'s and PC\\'s to look. I personally am not interested in having androgyny rule my game so I opted to creating and sharing my own female characters that cannot be mistaken for anything else. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\n\r\nFalmerBane",
