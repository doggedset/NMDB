  "descriptionHtml": "Thanks for all the endorsements!\r\n\r\nTHIS MOD REQUIRES DAWNGUARD!\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nThe Snow Elves Also Known As as the Falmer or Ice Elves were once a proud race with unusually great aptitude for magic. There skin is coated with a thin layer of blue-white ice. They inhabited Skyrim long before the Nord\\'s Returned from Atmora and Had their own language which was written in a complex and indecipherable alphabet. The Snow Elves were Purported to use spears and archery in combat.\r\n\r\nSnow Elves Have These Stat bonuses:\r\n+10 One handed\r\n+5 Heavy Armor\r\n+5 Archery \r\n+5 Block\r\n+5 Restoration \r\n+5 Destruction\r\n\r\nSnows Elves Are : \r\n75% Resistant to Frost/Ice\r\n25% Weakness to Fire/Flames\r\nCan also Use Ice Shout as a Natural Power  \r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n\r\nThis mod works with the Vampire Lord/Werewolf with no problems as well as all the vanilla quests with no freezing or crashing ECT\r\n\r\nthe snow elf race should be compatible with most mod\\'s on the Nexus however Not all custom Armor will work with the snow elf race as Its not been assigned to the Snow Elf race on the Armor Add-on. To fix this I\\'ve added a armor compatibility plugin with this mod and will be making most of the popular armor mod\\'s on the nexus compatible with the snow elf race as well as writing a guide on how to do it yourself incase on of your favorite armor mod\\'s is not working with the snow elf race, But feel free to request some armor mods :).\r\n\r\nIf you find any conflicts with any mods or the vanilla game be sure to report them so I can fix them but Im pretty sure there should be no Conflicts with any mods.\r\n\r\nFuture Updates\r\n\r\nAny Bugs/conflicts will be fixed \r\nMore Hair Styles\r\nFemale Snow Elf  \r\nA Snow elf Companion with a quest \r\nPlus more\r\n\r\nFeel Free To suggest improvements/ideas for the mod ill add them in if I think there good :)\r\n\r\nInstallation  \r\n\r\nI highly Recommend using the the NMM as its pretty much a few click instillation just click download with manager and activate when downloaded in NMM. if its asks you to overwrite files in the NMM just click Yes to all to\r\n\r\nTo install manually just extract the archive to a place of you choice (e.g. the desktop) and add all the contents in the data folder to the Skyrim data folder and copy and replace any files it asks\r\n\r\nTo uninstall simply Deactivate the Mod in NMM or if you manually installed delete the following files in the skyrim data folder:\r\n\r\nRaceCompatibility.ESP\r\nSnow Elf Armor Compatibility.ESP (V3 or below)\r\nSnow Elf Race.ESP\r\n\r\n(OPTIONAL)\r\nData/Script/GenericRaceController.pex \r\nData/Script/Source/GenericRaceController.psc\r\nData/Script/RaceControllerSnowElf.pex\r\nData/Script/Source/RaceControllerSnowElf.psc\r\nData/Script/PlayerVampireQuestScript.pex Data/Script/Source/PlayerVampireQuestScript.psc Data/Script/companionshousekeepingscript.pex Data/Script/Source/companionshousekeepingscript.psc\r\n\r\nWARNING DEACTIVATING THIS MOD MAY AFFECT ALL YOUR SAVES WITH THIS RACE\r\n\r\nTo play as the Snow Elf simply start a new game or do \\\"showracemenu\\\" in the console and change your race to the snow elf doing this method this will effect all your characters stats in game but its recommend starting a new game or backing up you save before doing \\\"showracemenu\\\".
