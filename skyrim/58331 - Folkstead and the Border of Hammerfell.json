Talk to Red (the Redguard) and you'll be on a quest, traveling to a few other new locations, all near or behind the Skyrim borders. It's worth the trouble to talk with other NPC's too. Saadia for example, a Redguard woman, sells her Green Dragon beer to the inns of Falkreath and Riften. And Hjorlf might tell you something about the history of Folkstead. And this town has his local crazy lad: Helmut.\n<br />\n<br />From Folkstead, you can pass the [color=yellow]Cyrodiil border[/color] and visit a bordertown and a fort.\n<br />\n<br />[b]How to go to Folkstead:[/b] Travel from Falkreath to the Skyrim/Hammerfell border. Before the border, you'll see a path heading to the south, to a cave. This is the Folkpassage, heading to this town.\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow]VROSTHEIM (SKYRIM)_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n<br />[/color] \n<br />You can travel to a small fishing town, called [color=yellow]Vrostheim[/color], northeast of Windhelm, in a freezing cold area, close to the border of Morrowind. In this, perhaps most isolated town of Skyrim, Captain Redbeard (because he has a red beard) discoverd Vrostheims trade is in trouble and needs Dragonborn to help him. Beside some fishermen, there is a Khajiit dealer living there, giving you the best skooma. And there is an ancient holy place too, where you can pray.\n<br />\n<br />[b]How to go to Vrostheim:[/b] Travel from Windhelm to the northeast. You have to swim a little but that's not a problem for Dragonborn. \n<br />\n<br />[img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/6616512-1432483753.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[i]~Vrostheim, northeast of Skyrim, near the Morrowind border ~[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/110/6616512-1457812615.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[i]~Gabar Ja, your Khajiit dealer. Fully voiced, with angry cat sounds when he's in a fight. ~[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow]REACH AREA EXPANDED TO THE SOUTH(UNDISPUTED)_________________________________________________________________________________[/color] \n<br />\n<br />South of the Skyrim's province The Reach, two Forsworn settlements are located. These Forsworn are biding their time to reclaim Markarth, but it seems like this will take at least a couple of years, since the Forsworn are not only weakened since the Markarth Incident, but also too devided and decentralized. \n<br />\n<br />Beside one small quest, there is no huge quest involved with these Forsworn.  But you can walk, talk, trade, rest and make friends with these Forsworn. Even becoming one and live there if you want. The area is quite safe, you only have to get rid of a dangerous Black Dragon, breathing lightning. Roaargghh!  \n<br />\n<br />[img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/110/6616512-1448102695.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[i]~ Meet the Forsworn ~[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow]PRINCIPALITY OF MORREATH (HAMMERFELL)__________________________________________________________________________________________[/color] \n<br />\n<br />Last, but not least: this mod offers you a Redguard Principality; [color=yellow]Morreath[/color], also known as Morkreath, just across the border in Hammerfell! It's a small principality, perhaps the size of 1/2 hold. The capital is Morreath, with it's brownred walls. But there is also a small town and a few farms scattered around in one of the coldest areas in Hammerfell. Morreath is located in a cold, mountainous area. Only the southern part is not snow covered throughout the year and usable for agriculture.  Lately, Morreath keeps refugees from Skyrim, who fled the civil war.\n<br />\n<br />In the capital of Morreath, a trader is resting in it's inn; a wolf in sheepsclothing. He is not nice after all and seems to be a member of a group of bandits, hiding near Morreath. You will be greatly rewarded, after you got rid of the bandits, with a small house in Hammerfell! So, if you ever wanted to live in Hammerfell, this is the mod! \n<br />\n<br />[b]How to go to Morreath:[/b] Cross the Skyrim/Hammerfell border and just follow the path to the west. You'll first pass a small border town. And after 1 minute walk, follow the signs and turn right. You can not miss it.\n<br />\n<br />Team Beyond Skyrim creates Hammerfell at this moment, a team which I support fully, work with- and am part of. This principality of Morreath I created is not directly linked with- and part of Beyond Skyrim's Hammerfell, nor have I used their assets.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/110/6616512-1478354812.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[i]~The principality of Morreath, Hammerfell ~[/i]\n<br />\n<br />Like my other mods, this one makes use of the worldspace behind the Skyrim border and truly expands the game.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow]AS-LAL EXTENSION FOR FOLKSTEAD, MORREATH &amp; VROSTHEIM__________________________________________________________________________[/color] \n<br />\n<br />This additional mod, made by [color=yellow]Jknjb [/color], which is also downloadable from this site, gives you the opportunity to start your character in one of these three locations! \n<br />Your character will spawn at the map marker in Folkstead, the map marker on the island of Vrostheim, or the map marker in East Morreath, depending on what you select.  You will start with a basic suit of iron armor, a set of steel weapons, a woodcutter's axe and a pickaxe, a set of clothes, 10 lockpicks, 10 restore health potions and 500 gold.\n<br />\n<br />To play this mod, you need the Alternate Start-Live Another Life from [color=yellow]Arthmoor[/color] .\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/]Alternate Start-Live Another Life[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][color=yellow]THIS MOD CONTAINS:_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________[/color] \n<br />\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=2] Folksteadpassage, south of Falkreath, with a small miner's settlement; Mjolgrove[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2] Folkstead: A new Nordic town with NPC's, a passage and a shrine, south of Falkreath [/size]\n<br />[*][size=2] Vrostheim, a fishing town near the border of Morrowind, northeast of Windhelm[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Expanded the Reach area to the south, adding two Forsworn settlements.

There are two locations where you can find this file. You should not \n<br />have the one in your Skyrim data folder, where you put the mods for \n<br />example, but the one in your General folder (I think it is: User/My \n<br />Documents/My Games/Skyrim). \n<br />If you found the Skyrim.ini file, type: bBorderRegionsEnabled=0 in the section [General].
