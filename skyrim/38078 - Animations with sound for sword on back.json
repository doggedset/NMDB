To my knowledge, current mods that provide for a character to carry a one handed sword on the back don\\'t have animations with sound effects.  I had to hex edit the animation files to get them to use the draw and sheathe sounds. Note:  You will need one of several mods that allows a character to equip a one-handed sword on the back to make use of these animations.",
