INFORMATION ON THE MOD           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod makes it so right after a guard complains about it being too long since they \r\nhad a good bandit raid, a raid occurs.\r\n\r\n\t   The guard says, \\\"I mostly deal with petty thievery and drunken brawls. Been too long \r\nsince we\\'ve had a good bandit raid.\\\"  He better be careful what he wishes for!\r\n\r\n\t   The eight bandits that make up each bandit raid are fairly low-level and hopefully \r\nwon\\'t succeed in massacring too many townspeople and completely depopulating your towns. \r\n\r\n\t   The bandits get reused by being resurrected and moved to where they need to be, so this \r\nmod cannot create any PlaceAtMe savegame bloat.\r\n\r\n\t   If you get tired of waiting for a guard to wish for a bandit raid, you can trigger one\r\non your own by using this console code:\r\n\r\nSetStage AABanditRaid 10\r\n\r\n\t   So if you are looking for a laugh or a bit of unexpected excitement at odd intervals,\r\nthen this could be a good mod for you. \r\n************************************************************************\r\n2. Installation                           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n           Extract (decompress) the .esp and the .bsa to your Skyrim directory.  \r\n(It will be something like *Installation directory*\\\\Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data)\r\nMark the box next to \\\"Too Long Since We Had a Good Bandit Raid.esp\\\" in your mod manager.\r\n \r\n           Alternately, extract files someplace else.  Then move the .esp and .bsa \r\nto Skyrim\\\\Data.  Mark the box next to the plugin in your mod manager.\r\n************************************************************************\r\n3. Version History    \r\n************************************************************************\r\nV 1.0    5/2/12   Initial release.   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n4. Conflicts, Known Issues, and Troubleshooting\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This is a joke mod.  I do not imagine that everyone will want to keep it active in their \r\nload orders forever.  Many people will probably just want to play it for a few days and then remove \r\nit when the novelty wears off.\t   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n5.
