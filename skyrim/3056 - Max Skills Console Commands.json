  "descriptionHtml": "A selection of codes that max out individual skills (raises them to 100), instead of every skill at once. Handy for experimenting with different characters and play-styles. \r\n\r\n\r\nTO INSTALL:\r\nSimply download the files, then extract them to your Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\nTO USE:\r\nWhile in-game, bring up the console by hitting the \\'Â¬\\' key, and then type \\\"bat code\\\" replace \\'code\\' with the name of the code you want. \r\nSo for example if I want to have 100 in sneak, I type: bat givemaxsneak then hit enter, it will be increased to 100 and I will most likely have levelled up a few times and have lots of perk points to assign. If you already had say, 99 in sneak, entering the code will add one more to make it 100. If you already had 100, it would do nothing, not add another 100.\r\n\r\nCODES: \r\nEach of the commands maxes out the skill, and levels you up accordingly, complete with all the perk points to assign.\r\n\r\ngivemaxalchemy\r\ngivemaxalteration\r\ngivemaxblock\r\ngivemaxconjuration\r\ngivemaxdestruction\r\ngivemaxenchanting\r\ngivemaxheavyarmor\r\ngivemaxillusion\r\ngivemaxlightarmor\r\ngivemaxmarksman\r\ngivemaxonehanded\r\ngivemaxpickpocket\r\ngivemaxrestoration\r\ngivemaxsmithing\r\ngivemaxsneak\r\ngivemaxspeechcraft\r\ngivemaxtwohanded \r\n\r\nIf you have increased the skill a lot, you will hear the skill increase sound played over and over for every increase, to stop this, simply save your game after you have inputted the code then load it up and all the sounds will have stopped. Works with quicksave/quickload too.\r\n\r\nI may add more commands in the future, such as commands that give you certain weapons and armor. Not sure yet.",
