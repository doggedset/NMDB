  "descriptionHtml": "[url=https://twitter.com/PrvtIPrivateEye][img]http://i.imgur.com/N4B7zRX.png[/img][/url]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/xLJHc.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThis is a simple mod that adds the mighty Chrysamere from Morrowind to the game!\r\nI stayed true to the look of the original, but added some details to it. The original was pretty bland.\r\nIn Morrowind, you will have to find this balde as part of an Imperial Legion quest.\r\nThe Imperial Legion has now brought this weapon to Skyrim to aid their war effort!\r\n\r\nChrysamere waits for you in Castle Dour.\r\nThe empire has send this mighty artifact to Skyrim to help inspire the troops and boost morale.\r\nGeneral Tulius currently posses it and keeps it locked safel in Castle Dour in Solitude.\r\nSneak into the castle and steal the sword or win the war for the Stormcloaks to claim the blade at your leisure!\r\nTulius keeps Chrysamere safe in a display case in his quarters. Look around for a key and a note.\r\n\r\nBesides being a very powerfull two-handed sword, Chrysamere comes with a few other nice extra\\'s.\r\nFirstly, while Chrystamere is equipped you gain a nice little healing spell called \\\"Healing Faith\\\".\r\nAlso, as long as you carry Chrysamere around (you don\\'t have to have it equipped!), you gain the \\\"Paladin\\'s Shield\\\" ability.\r\nThis gives you extra resistance against fire and magicka.\r\n\r\nChrysamere can be upgraded with the Steel smithing perk. This requires a Steel and Quicksilver ingot and a Flawless Ruby.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Tub2a.png[/img]\r\n[b]Now the important part![/b]\r\nModders are [b]free[/b] to use the sword (the meshes and the textures and scripts) for their own modding projects!\r\n[b]All I ask is credit for my hard work.[/b]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Tub2a.png[/img]\r\n[b]Changelog[/b]\r\n\r\nV 1.0\r\nInitial release\r\n\r\nV 1.1\r\n-Small texture tweaking\r\n-The Healing Faith ability was added when Chrysamere was equipped. This made it unusable since the blade is unequipped if you try to cast the spell. Fixed this by adding the spell when Chrysamere is in the players inventory, not only when equipped. Also made the spell better.\r\n-Changed the ability Paladins Defence into Paladins Shield.\r\n\r\n!!If the new script does not work properly after updating, try deactivating the plugin and saving your game. Then activate the plugin again and get Chrysamere back from Castle Dour!!\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Tub2a.png[/img]\r\n[b]Translations[/b]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/skyrim/mods/armurerie/armes/chrysamere.php]French translation[/url] at La Confr√©rie des Traducteurs\r\n\r\n[url=http://tes-world.ru/load/plaginy_dlja_skyrim/oruzhie/khrizamer/52-1-0-1076]Russian translation[/url] at tes-world.ru\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Tub2a.png[/img]\r\nPlease also check out my other Morrowind mods :)\r\nHere are the latest:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18585]Shortswords[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17534]Sixth House Bell Hammer[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16637 ]Ashland Amulets[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15579]BiPolar Blade[/url]\r\n\r\nFor more, check [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=887024]my profile[/url]",
