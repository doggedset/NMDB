  "descriptionHtml": "[u][size=4]Introduction[/size][/u]\r<br />One of the great things about [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49791]Complete Crafting Overhaul Remade[/url] is being able to break down almost anything into base crafting materials to either sell or make into something else. So I was disappointed when my Argonian thief character, who thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14157]Thief Guild Requirements[/url] was not yet a Thief Guild member and so didn&#39;t have access to a fence, couldn&#39;t get rid of his newly stolen Cyrodiilic Iron Sword from the excellent [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44179]Lore Weapon Expansion[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Hence this patch...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=4]Details[/size][/u]\r<br />Adds smelting recipes for all the unenchanted weapons from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44179]Lore Weapon Expansion[/url], toggleable with the smelting option in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49791]Complete Crafting Overhaul Remade[/url]&#39;s Mod Config Menu.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve also added optional recipes for smelting Daedric weapons and armour into ebony ingots as CCO doesn&#39;t include these, use the console to toggle them on or off (which will also toggle LWE&#39;s two Daedric swords), open the console and type: \r<br />[i][color=#00ffff]set LWE_CCO_AllowDaedricBreakdown to 1[/color][/i] to enable them, and [color=#00ffff][i]\r<br />set LWE_CCO_AllowDaedricBreakdown to 0[/i][/color] to disable them.\r<br />\r<br />Oh, and I renamed the unenchanted LWE weapons, so they sort better with vanilla weapons, like moving the word &#34;Cyrodiilic&#34; or &#34;Rusty&#34; to the end of the name.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=4]Requirements[/size][/u]\r<br />In case it wasn&#39;t obvious by now this mod requires Lore Weapon Expansion, you WILL instantly crash without it.\r<br />This mod does not require Complete Crafting Overhaul Remade (but it&#39;s highly recommended&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=4]Compatibilty[/size][/u]\r<br />I made this mod as a companion to Complete Crafting Overhaul Remade, and added smelter recipes for Daedric items, if you are using another mod that already allows you to smelt your Daedric items, then you might get duplicate recipes in the smelter crafting menu. You can disable them as above but then you&#39;ll lose the recipes for the two LWE Daedric swords.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]Credits[/u][/size]\r<br />InsanitySorrow and Elvarheim for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44179]Lore Weapon Expansion[/url]\r<br />kryptopyr for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49791]Complete Crafting Overhaul Remade[/url]",
