  "descriptionHtml": "Story: High in the seven thousand steps of High Hrothgar lives a young man who dedicated himself to master the Thu\\'um, Hrethon, a greybeard. Though he was good, he was not close with Paarthunax, the Dragon grand master of the Greybeards. He would like to be alone and perfect his skill.\r\n\r\nOne day he saw a traveler, a woman from the path of Riverwood. He was captivated with the beauty of the young fair lady. Secretly he called for the woman and they talked. Soon after they started liking each other and finally fell for each other. The woman\\'s name was Synthi, a Breton. Synthi loves Hrethon so much she would visit Hrethon everyday through the seven thousand steps just to see him.\r\n\r\nThey knew it was forbidden for a Greybeard to fall in love ; for Greybeards are to live in isolation. They knew someone will find out and still they persisted until one day they were caught. Hrethon was banished from High Hrothgar and moved with his lover Synthi to Riverwood. There they had a daughter named Belladayna who was taught by her father the voice and after sometime married a man from Hammerfell, Andre Valentine. Belladayna bore 3 daughters: Fiona, Wealtheow and Eliza Valentine. The three dedicated themselves to The Companions for glory and honor.\r\n\r\n************************************************************\r\nLocation: Jorrvaskr (Mead Hall), Whiterun, Skyrim, Tamriel.
