  "descriptionHtml": "If you&#39;ve already completed the M.Q (Main Quest) or if you haven&#39;t been bothered to, You need to use the center-on-cell (COC) command to get to Sovngarde. You will find a statue near the broken word wall. The bow and some arrows are in front of the statue, which you need to disable in order to get the scroll containing Wizard&#39;s Fury. Some rules for using Shor&#39;s War Bow:\r<br />\r<br />1- The bow contains immense power, too powerful for even the Dovahkiin.\r<br />\r<br />2- Don&#39;t shoot it too close to yourself without god mode on.\r<br />\r<br />3- Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />If someone can help me make a dungeon to put this in it would be awesome&#33; I suck at making dungeons and houses and stuff, so that&#39;s why I&#39;d like some help. All that needs to be done is the actual building and some ambushes. I can do the rest.\r<br />",
