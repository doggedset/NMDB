  "descriptionHtml": "Blue Jeans, T-shirts, Singlets, Leather Jackets, Sneakers, Sunglasses (for males) Volume 3\r\n\r\nThis mod adds blue jeans, t-shirts, singlets (muscle shirts/a-shirts), leather jackets, sneakers, sunglasses, and a couple of bonuses to the game for males.  A new shop in Solitude called \\\"Canuck Imports\\\" with its own shopkeeper, \\\"Stephen\\\", (who is not quite as arrogant as Endarie at Radiant Raiments) has been created to accommodate these items.  Journey to Solitude and the shop entrance is across from the market stall area next to the ramp leading to the blacksmith. Look for the red maple leaf.\r\n\r\nThis mod replaces and adds to the earlier volumes of blue jeans and t-shirts.  \r\n\r\nNOTE: Singlets are called many things.  We call them muscle shirts;  But I have heard them called: \\\"Tank tops\\\", \\\"A-shirts\\\", \\\"Vests\\\", \\\"Wife beaters\\\", and just \\\"sleeveless shirts\\\".\r\n\r\nSOME HEADS-UP WARNINGS: \r\n1. This is not an immersion-friendly mod.\r\n2. This is a male-only mod.  There is already enough female material.  And a lot of players will enjoy some attention given the male character.\r\n3. This mod is not tested on the Khajiit or Argonian character models.\r\n\r\nThe clothing items and sunglasses carry no enhancements or enchantments.  The sneakers make you run faster.  The unique keris is a powerful weapon with a enemy-life-draining enchantment.  The knick-knacks have various minor attributes.\r\n\r\n============================\r\nCHANGELOG\r\n============================\r\n\r\nV. 3.0\r\nAdded sneakers of two colours.\r\nAdded leather jackets of two colours.\r\nAdded keris weapon and colourful gay weapon.\r\nAdded untucked tshirts and longer jeans.\r\nAdded sunglasses of five colours.\r\nAdded a few knick-knacks.\r\nAdded a new shop \\\"Canuck Imports\\\" to improve compatibility with any other mods that might affect other vanilla shops.\r\nFixed some more vertex problems (like the splitting jeans while swimming).\r\nFixed some more bone-weighting problems.\r\n\r\nV. 2.0\r\nAdded singlets of various colours.\r\nRepaired some mesh and vertex errors.\r\nCorrect some bone-weight errors.\r\nAdjusted the alpha and normal maps some.\r\nReduced brightness of shirt colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n============================\r\nCOMPATIBILITY\r\n============================\r\n\r\nUnknown at this time.  Anything that modifies the male body may be a prime suspect though.\r\n\r\n\r\n============================\r\nINSTALLING/UNINSTALLING\r\n============================\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\nUnpack the .7z file with \\\"7-zip\\\" or a similar programme.\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the contents of the mod\\'s data folder into your \\\"...skyrim/data/\\\" folder.\r\n\r\nOr, alternatively,  a compliant mod manager can be used.\r\n\r\nEnable \\\"bluejeans.esp\\\" in the launcher.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If u have either of the earlier blue jeans and t-shirts mods installed, installing this mod will overwrite the old files with the new and/or corrected ones.
