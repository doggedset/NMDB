I decided to take that concept and make Everweyr an entire city that exists in another dimension.   Now, instead of a small room with several doors, you can get to the various cities and even the smaller villages (such as Rorikstead) via the &#34;Hall of Doors&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Finding Everweyr\r<br />\r<br />If you want a challenge there is a note on the workbench outside of Warmaiden&#39;s in Whiterun with a small riddle on it.  However if you wish to use the more direct approach uses the COC command and head for 001EverHall\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />\r<br />    Skyrim 1.9 +\r<br />    All Official DLC\r<br />  \r<br />Important Information\r<br />\r<br />This is a work in progress, and not yet near completion at any rate. If I was to put a percentage on it I would estimate I have about ten percent done.  A few of the buildings can be entered but most cannot and I have not navmeshed most of it so any companions will not be able to enter the city with you (tho they can join you in the Hall of Doors)\r<br />\r<br />Eventually I hope to furnish all the buildings and add various NPCs and quests tho with the size it is and the amount I want to do with it I may require help.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE:\r<br />\r<br />Added a few more locations to explore as well as an Inn Keeper and a Bard \r<br />\r<br />In order to use the newly created &#34;Hall of Doors -Solstheim&#34; you will need to find the key in Solstheim which is somewhere in Raven Rock Docks and you will again need a seperate Key to unlock the fast door to Miraak&#39;s Temple.\r<br />\r<br />Screenshots\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b209/darkwriter/Skyrim%20Creation%20Kit/Graveyard_zpsa322afe3.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b209/darkwriter/Skyrim%20Creation%20Kit/Hall-of-Doors--Holds_zps9e72a054.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b209/darkwriter/Skyrim%20Creation%20Kit/Everweyr-Cathedral_zpsbfc2614a.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b209/darkwriter/Skyrim%20Creation%20Kit/Street_zps630ffa2e.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b209/darkwriter/Skyrim%20Creation%20Kit/Hall-of-Doors-Exterior_zps4bb7bda6.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
