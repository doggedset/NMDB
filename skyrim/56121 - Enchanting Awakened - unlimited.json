  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Intro:[/b]\r<br />Since I mainly play just my first character in Skyrim, but like to change my fighting style now and then (like every 30 minutes) I felt too limited with just two enchants per item (don&#39;t want to run around with a archer, melee and mage gear, same goes for alchemy, speechcraft etc.).\r<br />There are a few mods doing something similiar, but only for the vanilla enchanting system, but I prefer Enchanting Awakened, which makes enchanting way more fun in every way. So I&#39;ve made this mod, first for myself, now for all of you, since egocarib gave me permission to do so. \r<br />The skilltrees should be somewhat balanced, despite the missing factor of the number of enchants. If I messed that up somewhere, feel free to leave a comment, so I can look into it.\r<br />\r<br />[b]What it does:[/b]\r<br />- extends the last perks of each enchantment tree to a 5-point perk\r<br />- Each perk allows more enchantments per item \r<br />- since the Corpus tree worked with one stronger enchantment I designed the 5th rank of the other two to empower their enchantments as well\r<br />- Specialisations remain important, because the empowerments just work for the enchantments of that specific skilltree\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements:[/b]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42796/?]Enchanting Awakened[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installing:[/b]\r<br />Download with NMM, activate, win.\r<br />OR\r<br />Place the &#34;EnchantingAwakened unlimited.esp&#34; in your Skyrim&#92;Data folder and activate it in your Manager/Launcher\r<br />\r<br />In any case make sure to load this after Enchanting Awakened.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Uninstalling:[/b]\r<br />Just remove/deactivate &#34;EnchantingAwakened unlimited.esp&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Conflicts/Bugs[/b]\r<br />There should be no conflicts, since it&#39;s the only Enchanting Awakened mod to date.\r<br />I&#39;m not aware of any bugs related to this little mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Disclaimer:[/b]\r<br />If anyone wants to mod my mod of a mod, feel free to message me. You may not alter my mod without my permission.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits:[/b]\r<br />egocarib, for making enchantment awesome with his mod\r<br />Bethesda, cause.. well.. making Skyrim in the open minded way they did",
