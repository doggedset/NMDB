  "modName": "Posh Ponies - New Horse Colors and Horses - Not MLP",
  "summary": "This mod adds 36 new player horses available for free at a location across the river from Riverwood.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Here is a mod to give you access to 18 new colors of player horses, based on the wonderful colors and meshes created by Alienslof.  Available are saddled and unsaddled horses free for the taking - just hop on and ride.  Horses behave normally except they are Essential, they do not see you on the sneakometer when you\\'re being stealthy, and they do not return to anywhere when abandoned or replaced.  They simply stay put in case you come back.  Now that\\'s loyalty!\r\n\r\nThis mod is incompatible with any other mod that uses the same space across the river from Riverwood!  If you have a player house or anything over there, you will not be able to use this mod.  \r\n\r\nI don\\'t think I will be working on this mod or adding to it unless there are bugs found or a really nifty new color pops into my brain that I just have to add.  All of the horse colors were created by Alienslof except for the gold palomino, the black leopard, and the buckskin pinto done by me, but based on her work.\r\n\r\nIf you like the mod, please endorse and help others find this mod too!\r\n\r\nTo install:  Simply move the .esp file, the meshes folder and the textures folder into your Skyrim/Data folder.  Put a check mark beside the mod in your mod manager and you\\'re ready to go!   \r\n\r\nUPDATE:  Version 1.1 - Fixed fences by making them all stone so they look much better.  Added 2 new horse colors - brindled grulla and copper palomino (4 horses total).  Also fixed the color of the bay appaloosa which was glowing a little oddly.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 download contains all the files necessary for the mod.  It will overwrite your current files for 1.0, but should make no changes to the horse(s) you currently own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
