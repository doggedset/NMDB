  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Kortex Mod Manager[/b] is a mod-manager that uses a virtual file system (VFS) to isolate mods to provide simple resolution of conflicts between mods, clean installation and uninstallation.\n<br />\n<br />Discord server: [url=https://discord.gg/ZyzWjYj]https://discord.gg/ZyzWjYj[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Supported games[/b]:\n<br />The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind\n<br />The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\n<br />The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\n<br />The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition\n<br />The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - VR Edition\n<br />Fallout 3\n<br />Fallout: New Vegas\n<br />Fallout 4\n<br />Fallout 4 VR\n<br />Sacred 2\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features[/b]\n<br />[i]Configurator[/i]: Customize game parameters (graphics and similar). The full-featured configurator is currently only available for Skyrim, SkyrimSE and Fallout 4 (but SkyrimSE and Fallout use a copy of the settings for Skyrim because it is reasonably compatible). The rest of the games will have only with what Kortex can determine automatically (spoiler: only the types of parameters).\n<br />\n<br />[i]Plugin activation[/i]: like most other mod-managers Kortex can activate plugins. For Oblivion, Fallout 3 and FalloutNV, changing the file modification date is supported so that the load order will remain correct. For Fallout 4 and SkyrimSE, prepending of the asterisks in front of non-official plugins is supported.\n<br />\n<br />Installing mods: currently Kortex supports the mods installation only from the special installers. Supported formats: FOMod (for Nexus Mod Manager, XML config only), Kortex Mod Package (KMP) - native format of Kortex. Support for other formats like OMOD or BAIN can be added in the future (when I find specifications for these formats).\n<br />\n<br />[i]Virtual file system[/i]: this is perhaps the most interesting. Unlike [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75738]KMM1[/url], Kortex does not dump all mod files into the game folder, but dynamically combines them using VFS. This means that the mod's files is not copied into the game folder and nothing there is cluttered and not overwritten. Also VFS allows to simply move the mod in the list to change its priority (the mod is lower in the list -&gt; priority is higher). If you used Mod Organizer, maybe you will be familiar with such a system, or maybe not. I have never used MO, so I can't say anything.\n<br />\n<br />Unfortunately, VFS slows down the game starting. I have more than 200 mods installed and I wait ~2-3 minutes with ENB and 1-1.5 without ENB (you can reduce this time a bit using PrivateProfileRedirector [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/92725]LE[/url]﻿, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18860]SE[/url]﻿, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33947]F4[/url]). You may have a different result. Also I advise you to disable the antivirus (or add Kortex to its exclusion list) before starting the game otherwise AV most likely will increase game start time.\n<br />\n<br />VFS library is now open source: [url=https://github.com/KerberX/KxVirtualFileSystem]https://github.com/KerberX/KxVirtualFileSystem[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[i]Package creator[/i]: Kortex have built-in installer creation tool. This tool can be used to create full featured install packages in KMP and FOMod format.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements[/b]:\n<br />Windows 7 or later, builin LOOT requires [url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48145]MSVC 2015 redistributable [x86, x64][/url].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation[/b]:\n<br />Unpack from the archive to a folder (not in the folder with the game) and run as an administrator. When updating, follow the removal instructions and then the installation instructions.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Update[/b]:\n<br />1.x -&gt; 1.3: Plugins order and activation state will be reset, mod order and state should remain untouched.\n<br />\n<br />You want full user manual? Well, I have it, but it's in russian. You can try to read and understand it (it have pictures), or Google-translate it. I don't want to translate so much text. If you wish to do it for me, contact me and I'll send you a .docx source. Don't worry, the program itself have english UI.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][b]Back up important files if you intend to use the program. I am not responsible for the loss of a four-year-old mods assembly or the save of a 200-level character with 1000 hours played.[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Uninstallation[/b]:\n<br />Close the program, delete the VFS service by typing the command [b]sc delete KortexVFS[/b] in Windows console (cmd.exe, run it as admin), restart the computer and delete the program files.\n<br /> \n<br />[b]Additionally[/b]:\n<br />Import from Mod Organizer: [b]Mod manager[/b] page -&gt; [b]Add[/b] button -&gt; [b]Import from Mod Organizer[/b].\n<br />Import from Nexus Mod Manager: not supported.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Using LOOT[/b]\n<br />There is two versions of LOOT: embedded and external. Embedded comes with program. External version you have to install yourself and tell Kortex where it is. Both requires VFS to be enabled to run sorting.\n<br />\n<br />Sorting can be activated in plugins pane context menu. Embedded version (labeled [b]LOOT API[/b]) \"just works\" and external version will run LOOT GUI. First time you click this button you have to specify LOOT executable (LOOT.exe). In LOOT settings you need to change game folder to virtual game root (you can open it from Kortex menu -&gt; Open Location -&gt; Virtual game folder). Otherwise LOOT will not see .esp files form Kortex's virtual mods.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Other programs\n<br />[/b]SKSE, ENB, FNIS, xEdit (TES5Edit if you wish), BodySlide and OutfitStudio works fine and can be installed as virtual mod.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Linked mod[/b] (v1.2+)\n<br />This mod is not stored in Kortex database, but only links files from another folder. This can be any folder on your disk, but it's better to be persistent (i. e. not USB flash drive, another local drive is fine). Linked mod can be created using [b]Add mod[/b] menu ([b]Mod manager[/b] page -&gt; [b]Add[/b] button) -&gt; [b]New mod from folder[/b]. Select folder in displayed window and tick [b]Create as linked mod[/b] checkbox. Or you can convert any other mod to linked from mod's context menu.\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/90868/90868-1525263347-238737369.png[/img]\n<br />[/spoiler]",
