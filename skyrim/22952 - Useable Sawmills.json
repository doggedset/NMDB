  "descriptionHtml": "I never liked how Sawmills didn\\'t do anything, so I fixed them.  Now sawmills will give the player 20 firewood when a log is cut.\r\n\r\nAlso, I\\'ve decreased the firewood weight to 1.00, so cut some logs with the Sawmill!  Note that the firewood is not added to your inventory for a couple seconds after the log is cut, just watch for the note in the upper left of your screen.  This mod is simple and effective, so I don\\'t think there\\'s any way it could cause a mod conflict.\r\n\r\nCopy the Data folder from the .rar file into your Skyrim Data folder.  Make sure the script copies into your Skyrim Scripts folder.\r\n\r\nThat\\'s really all there is to it, just wanted to add to the immersion of the game.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.\r\n\r\nUpdates: Added a new file where NPC\\'s can no longer give you wood by using the sawmill.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
