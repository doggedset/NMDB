  "descriptionHtml": "\r\nImproved Daedric Artifacts v1.1\r\n(Steam Workshop version: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=76575666)\r\n\r\n==Purpose==\r\nThis mod is meant to increase the power of all Daedric Artifacts (besides Azura\\'s Star and the Skeleton Key for obvious reasons) whilst retaining balance. Each change was done carefully to ensure that these items do not become immensely overpowered, however it is possible that I\\'ve had some oversight on the features of some of them. I will be revisiting this mod in the future to address any of these possible issues.\r\n\r\n==How Did You Change the Artifacts?==\r\nI\\'ve enhanced the base damage and armor rating of each artifact slightly as to make them a little stronger than Daedric weapons and armor, or Dragonscale armor in the case of Light Armor. I\\'ve also adjusted the enchantment effects of most of the artifacts to increase their effectiveness and make them infinitely usable. On top of these changes, I\\'ve added new enchantments to some items as well as increased the value of every one of them. Each artifact has also been given a flavor description. For a full list of changes, see below.\r\n\r\n==Adjustments==\r\nALL weapons have been flagged to ignore weapon resistances.\r\n\r\nDawnbreaker\r\nOriginal Base Damage: 12\r\nNew Base Damage: 16\r\nOriginal Critical Hit Rate: 1.0\r\nNew Critical Hit Rate: 1.1\r\nCritical Hit Damage Bonus: 4\r\nEnchantment: Fire Damage, Meridia\\'s Flame\r\nOriginal Enchantment Strength: 10(fire)\r\nNew Enchantment Strength: 20(fire)\r\nValue: 5000\r\n\r\n\r\nEbony Blade\r\nOriginal Base Damage: 11\r\nNew Base Damage: 17\r\nOriginal Critical Hit Rate: 1.0\r\nNew Critical Hit Rate: 1.0\r\nCritical Hit Damage Bonus: 10\r\nEnchantment: I did not adjust the Absorb Health or Soul Feast attributes of this weapon, as I feel that they are already sufficient.\r\nValue: 3500\r\n*I also flagged this weapon to be upgradable with 1 Ebony Ingot, just like every other Daedric Artifact weapon. I\\'ve also flagged it to use Two-Handed perks instead of One-Handed ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nEbony Mail\r\nOriginal Base Armor: 45\r\nNew Base Armor: 52\r\nEnchantment: Sneak enhancement, Poison aura\r\nOriginal Enchantment Strength: 5(aura)\r\nNew Enchantment Strength: 7(aura)\r\nValue: 7500\r\n\r\n\r\nMace of Molag Bal\r\nOriginal Base Damage: 16\r\nNew Base Damage: 17\r\nOriginal Critical Hit Rate: 1.0\r\nNew Critical Hit Rate: 1.0\r\nCritical Hit Damage Bonus: 15\r\nEnchantment: Stamina damage, Magicka damage, Soul Trap\r\nOriginal Enchantment Strength: 25(stamina), 25(magicka), 3s(trap)\r\nNew Enchantment Strength: 25(stamina), 25(magicka), 5s(trap)\r\nValue: 3000\r\n\r\n\r\nMasque of Clavicus Vile\r\nOriginal Base Armor: 23\r\nNew Base Armor: 25\r\nEnchantment: Enhanced barter prices, Fortify Speech, Magicka Regen\r\nOriginal Enchantment Strength: 20%(barter), 10(speech), 5/s(magicka)\r\nNew Enchantment Strength: 25%(barter), 25(speech), 10/s(magicka)\r\nValue: 5000\r\n\r\n\r\nRueful Axe\r\nOriginal Base Damage: 22\r\nNew Base Damage: 27\r\nEnchantment: Stamina damage, Absorb health\r\nOriginal Enchantment Strength: 20(stamina)\r\nNew Enchantment Strength: 15(stamina), 5(health)\r\nValue: 3000\r\n\r\n\r\nMehrunes\\' Razor\r\nOriginal Base Damage: 11\r\nNew Base Damage: 13\r\nOriginal Critical Hit Rate: 1.0\r\nNew Critical Hit Rate: 1.25\r\nCritical Hit Damage Bonus: 1\r\nEnchantment: I did not enhance the Instant Kill chance beyond the original 5%, however I have added the ability for the dagger to banish all summoned daedra.\r\nValue: 6000\r\n\r\n\r\nRing of Namira\r\nOriginal Base Armor: 0\r\nNew Base Armor: 3\r\nEnchantment: Fortify Stamina, Increased HP and HP Regen after eating a corpse\r\nOriginal Enchantment Strength: 50(stamina)\r\nNew Enchantment Strength: 60(stamina)\r\nValue: 3000\r\n\r\n\r\nSanguine Rose\r\nEnchantment: Summon Daedra\r\nOriginal Enchantment Strength: 1 minute\r\nNew Enchantment Strength: 10 minutes\r\nValue: 5000\r\n\r\n\r\nSavior\\'s Hide\r\nOriginal Base Armor: 26\r\nNew Base Armor: 35\r\nEnchantment: Magic resist, Poison resist\r\nOriginal Enchantment Strength: 15%(magic), 50%(poison)\r\nNew Enchantment Strength: 20%(magic), 75%(poison)\r\nValue: 7500\r\n\r\n\r\nRing of Hircine\r\nOriginal Base Armor: 0\r\nNew Base Armor: 3\r\nEnchantment: Fortify Health, Fortify Stamina, Fortify Resist Disease, Health Regen, Extra Werewolf Transformations\r\nOriginal Enchantment Strength: 10%(werewolf)\r\nNew Enchantment Strength: 20(health), 20(stamina), 10(disease), 5/s(regen), 15%(werewolf)\r\nValue: 3000\r\n\r\n\r\nSkull of Corruption\r\nOriginal Base Damage: 2\r\nNew Base Damage: 4\r\nEnchantment: Additional damage, extra on sleeping NPCs\r\nOriginal Enchantment Strength: 20(awake), 50(asleep)\r\nNew Enchantment Strength: 30(awake), 70(asleep)\r\nValue: 4000\r\n\r\n\r\nSpellbreaker\r\nOriginal Base Armor: 38\r\nNew Base Armor: 38\r\nEnchantment: Magic ward when blocking\r\nOriginal Enchantment Strength: 50\r\nNew Enchantment Strength: 75\r\nValue: 3000\r\n\r\n\r\nVolendrung\r\nOriginal Base Damage: 25\r\nNew Base Damage: 29\r\nCritical Hit Damage Bonus: 7\r\nEnchantment: Absorb Stamina\r\nOriginal Enchantment Strength: 50\r\nNew Enchantment Strength: 75\r\nValue: 3500\r\n\r\n\r\nWabbajack\r\nOriginal Base Damage: 27\r\nNew Base Damage: 35\r\nCritical Hit Damage Bonus: 2\r\nEnchantment: Random Effect, I did not change this at all.\r\nValue: 5000\r\n\r\n\r\nOghma Infinitum\r\nOriginal Effect: +5 to attributes based on which path you choose\r\nNew Effect: +7 to attributes based on which path you choose\r\n\r\n==Changelog==\r\n1.2: Adjustment to Dawnbreaker and small bug fixes for Ebony Blade.\r\n*Increased Dawnbreaker base damage by an additional point.\r\n*Ebony Blade should now properly utilize Two-Handed perks.\r\n\r\n1.1: Adjustments to several artifacts.\r\n*Adjusted Oghma Infinium to increase skills by 7 rather than 15.\r\n*Adjusted Ring of Namira to increase stamina by 60 rather than 75.\r\n*Adjusted Mehrunes\\' Razor to banish summoned daedra.\r\n*Greatly increased the combat value of the Rueful Axe in order to make it a viable option for those who may not want the Masque.\r\n*Adjusted all of the artifact\\'s descriptions to better describe what they do.\r\n\r\n1.0: Initial release.\r\n\r\n==Comments, Concerns, and Suggestions==\r\nAre all welcome, please leave any feedback in the comment section and I\\'ll be sure to address it as necessary.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n",
