  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=red][size=+2]THIS MOD IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED AND IS FIXED IN THE UNNOFICIAL DRAGONBORN PATCH, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND PLEASE DELETE ASAP![/size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n========[b]*Update 03/022/2013[/b]=========\r\nThe mod is no longer supported.\r\n\r\n========[b]*Update 01/01/2013[/b]=========\r\nI added a video of the mod in action. Hopefully seeing the video will help explain why I made it.\r\n\r\n========[b]*Update 02/28/2013[/b]=========\r\nI moved the tome for the StandAlone Edition to the Arcanaeum in the College of Winterhold.\r\n\r\n========[b]*Update 02/27/2013[/b]=========\r\nI added an optional StandAlone version of this mod. This will not replace your vanilla Bound Dagger spell, but will add a tome that will add the [i]Bound Daggers[/i] spell that has the same effect as the replacer mod. The tome is found in Ferengar Secret-Fire\\'s office in Dragonsreach.\r\n\r\n===================================\r\n====[b]*Dragonborn DLC is required.[/b]=====\r\n===================================\r\n\r\n===================================\r\n============Description=============\r\n===================================\r\n\r\nWith the Vanilla Bound Dagger there were two highly irritating bugs that most people have taken a notice to: \r\n\r\n1. Unlike the silent swings from regular daggers, attacks with bound dagger are \\\"noisy\\\", causing the striker to be spotted when sneaking if the dagger is swung, regardless if the attack hits or misses. \r\n\r\n2. If dual cast so that one bound dagger is in each hand, using a dual wield power attack will not use the normal dual dagger animation. Instead, the regular spinning dual power attack will take place. \r\n\r\nThis mod changes the characteristics of the bound daggers to respond as if they were actually daggers. Also, they are completely compatible and tested with T3nd0\\'s Skyrim Redone and reacts as it should with the Assassination perk in the Sneak tree. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nT3bd0\\'s Skyrim Redone can be found [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286]here[/url].\r\n\r\n[b]Hymnaels Bound Dagger Fix is now in the Steam Workshop [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129916627]here[/url]![/b]\r\n\r\n[b]or for the StandAlone Edition, click [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129916627]here[/url]![/b]:\r\n\r\n===================================\r\n===========[b]Known Issues:[/b]============\r\n===================================\r\n\r\nTrying to make the initial mod, I changed the attributes to be exactly like the vanilla game, but the result were daggers that reacted correctly, but the right-hand dagger was completely invisible, while the left functioned properly. So they were changed to a Deadric model with Bound \\\"effects\\\" (like the pictures above) to avoid being invisible. I didn\\'t alter any stats, make them benefit from any Deadric perks or enhancements, or add any weight to them. Thank you for your patience as I am still working on a solution for this problem, and they will be brought back to that vanilla \\\"look\\\" as soon as possible.",
