  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][color=#FF8000][b]Halloween In Skyrim - Even More Pumpkins[/b][/color][/size] \r<br />Last year, the people of Solitude grew a large crop of pumpkins and carved them into jack-o-lanterns.  This year, the custom is spreading, and cities and towns all across Skyrim are decorating their doorstops with these agricultural lanterns.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds more than 400 pumpkins, both carved and un-carved, to locations across the map, all exterior.  It adds a few pumpkin vines from which you can pick your own pumpkins--an ingredient you can use for both alchemy or cooking.  Pumpkins can also be found in some barrels.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is really just a second version of Halloween in Solitude.  The reason I created a new file for it on the Nexus is that the name hardly seemed appropriate at this point.\r<br />\r<br />You can see the old file, along with some videos, here: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26014]Halloween in Solitude[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#FF8000][b]Installation Instructions[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />If you&#39;re installing this by hand, then extract all files into Skyrim&#39;s Data folder (for me, that&#39;s under C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;Data). If you already have existing meshes and textures folders, click Yes or Yes to All when it prompts you whether you want to copy the files into them.\r<br />\r<br />Once you unpack the files, verify that the mod is activated by selecting &#34;Data Files&#34; from the loader screen, and ensuring that &#34;HalloweenInSkyrim.esp&#34; is checked.\r<br />\r<br />You will have to disable this mod to make the pumpkins go away after Halloween.\r<br />\r<br />I would recommend disabling last year&#39;s version, HalloweenInSolitude, if you happened to still be using that one.  This mod includes everything the old one did.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#FF8000][b]Video[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Thanks to TheSpinia, Silverthorne11 (Skythorne) and Brodual for featuring this mod on YouTube&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]ogtm_uZAUqI[/youtube]\r<br />[youtube]yQIppyS5ImA[/youtube]\r<br />[youtube]VN-MwbJw2eU[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#FF8000][b]Credits[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />This mod was created by Deandra at the UESP (username Merilia at TESNexus since the name Deandra was taken). The pumpkins are based on a mesh and texture by Yughues aka Nobiax, which was packaged in a modder&#39;s resource by Tamira in her [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22018]New Plants 1_1[/url].  Please make sure to give credit to all of the people who have put work into these files if you choose to use them in a mod of your own, and respect their rights.",
