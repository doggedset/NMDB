  "descriptionHtml": "You may know of the elder scrolls renewal project. A group of dedicated modders attempting to re-create the games Morrowind and Oblivion in skyrim`s far superior engine by use of mods (Skywind and Skyblivion respectively). While progress on these is going brilliantly, and their work is an inspiration to us all, I believe that the first in the series, arena, also deserves such treatment.Â \r<br />Though this mod is little more than a dream at this time, I and a few trusted friends who share my opinions have begun our work. But we alone cannot manage this massive project. WE NEED YOU&#33;&#33; Anyone who wishes to contribute to this project need only to reply to one of the topics in the comments with a basic application, whatever you can do will be appreciated.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
