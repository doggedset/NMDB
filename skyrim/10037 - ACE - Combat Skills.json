And training light armor helps while unarmored\r\n* Heavy armor feels heavy and loud, but most importantly feels so protective\r\n* Light armor feels agile, a little risky, and much more versatile\r\n* The stronger distinction results in two very different playing styles, adding a lot of depth and fun to how you defend yourself!\r\n\r\n[b]Please see [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/readmes/ACE%20-%20Combat%20Skills_readme.txt]the Readme file[/url] for a full list of all changes in this module![/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#00a0a0][size=6][b] - - - [/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/13976-2-1339084411.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

[color=#00f0f0][size=4][b]ACE - Magic[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#f08020][size=3][b]In Skyrim, casting a spell is casting a spell, not much more to it, no other choices to be made.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[b]But with ACE Magic:[/b]\r\n* Spellcasting forms are introduced! These forms affect the spells you cast in different ways:\r\n* From the fun unpredictability of the Chaos Form to the dependable damage of the Battlemage Form!\r\n* Mages who focus on 1 school of magic will love the Specialization Forms, each school has one.\r\n* These forms are unlocked as you progress through the skill trees.\r\n\r\n[b]Please see [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/readmes/ACE%20-%20Combat%20Skills_readme.txt]the Readme file[/url] for a full list of all changes in this module![/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#00a0a0][size=6][b] - - - [/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/13976-5-1339084411.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. [color=#00f0f0][size=4][b]ACE - Melee[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#f08020][size=3][b]In Skyrim, 1-handed and 2-handed perk trees nearly mirror each other, not many real choices involved.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[b]But with ACE Melee:[/b]\r\n* 1H and 2H weapons are nothing alike, 1H is full of strategy, while 2H and dual-wielding are viciously fun!\r\n* Stances have been introduced based on what you have equipped (for instance the Duelist stance is 1H + empty off-hand)\r\n* 2H weapons cater to power attacks and raw damage, 1H weapons cater to strategy, speed, and criticals\r\n* These new stances, stronger roles, and variety of weapons create a multitude of combinations of playing styles!\r\n\r\n[b]Please see [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/readmes/ACE%20-%20Combat%20Skills_readme.txt]the Readme file[/url] for a full list of all changes in this module![/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#00a0a0][size=6][b] - - - [/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/13976-1-1339085669.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. [color=#00f0f0][size=4][b]ACE - Smithing[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#f08020][size=3][b]In Skyrim, legendary is hardly legendary if an average smith can do it, and the Smithing tree is so boring.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[b]But with ACE Smithing:[/b]\r\n* Legendary is a real goal, without the help of magic items or synergy bonuses (see below) you wont see it until Smithing 100.\r\n* The perks have practical combat applications, making them attractive to almost all player types.\r\n* Combat applications include doing more damage to armors you know how to craft and taking less damage from weapons you know how to craft.\r\n* The Smithing tree uses less perks than vanilla Skyrim using a new auto-perk system!\r\n\r\n[b]Please see [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/readmes/ACE%20-%20Combat%20Skills_readme.txt]the Readme file[/url] for a full list of all changes in this module![/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#00a0a0][size=6][b] - - - [/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/13976-4-1339084411.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. [color=#00f0f0][size=4][b]ACE - Speech[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#f08020][size=3][b]In Skyrim, money is a joke, it loses all meaning after about 3 hours of playing, and the Speech tree is so unattractive.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[b]But with ACE Speech:[/b]\r\n* The Speech tree can also be used to give combat buffs to followers.\r\n* Fewer perks are required to achieve a similar bartering potential.\r\n* Even with the Follower Buff perks, the tree has fewer perks than vanilla Skyrim, making it attractive!\r\n\r\n[b]Please see [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/readmes/ACE%20-%20Combat%20Skills_readme.txt]the Readme file[/url] for a full list of all changes in this module![/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#00a0a0][size=6][b] - - - [/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/13976-1-1339086208.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n8. [color=#00f0f0][size=4][b]ACE - Realistic Fighting[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#f08020][size=3][b]In Skyrim, there are surprisingly few factors that affect combat, obliterating any real combat strategy.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[b]But with ACE Realistic Fighting:[/b]\r\n* A multitude of factors contribute to how much damage, stagger, and critical chance are dealt\r\n* Factors such as: Sleeping, Prone (Crouched/Sneaking), Flat-Footed (Weapon Sheathed / Staggered), Casting, Power Attacking, \r\nIn-Combat (Weapon Drawn), Standing Still, Sure-Footed, Walking, Running, Sprinting, Damage from: side/back/front, and more\r\n* The idea is that when it\\'s intuitively more deadly to strike an enemy, it will actually be more deadly!\r\n\r\n[b]Please see [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/readmes/ACE%20-%20Combat%20Skills_readme.txt]the Readme file[/url] for a full list of all changes in this module![/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#00a0a0][size=6][b] - - - [/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/13976-2-1339085032.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. [color=#00f0f0][size=4][b]ACE - Synergy Bonuses[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#f08020][size=3][b]In Skyrim, there is next to no reward for diversifying your skills and perks, or for knowing complementary skills.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[b]But with ACE Synergy Bonuses:[/b]\r\n* A multitude of skills and perks give small bonuses to other related skills and perks.\r\n* There are many small benefits which represent a player\\'s cross-skill and other knowledge.\r\n* An example is having 80+ in a weapon skill and 80+ in the smithing skill gives a tempering bonus when upgrading that weapon type.\r\n* These are changes which cater to intuition, an Archery Smith would be able to make bows better than a Two-Handed Warrior Smith.\r\n\r\n[b]Please see [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/readmes/ACE%20-%20Combat%20Skills_readme.txt]the Readme file[/url] for a full list of all changes in this module![/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#00a0a0][size=6][b] - - - [/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/13976-1-1339084409.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n10.

[/quote]- PapaStalin\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]I love this. I love this. [/quote]- haerual\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]I finally got today playing a bit more, and Ive gotta say, it was worth installing all your mods. The immersion they give is amazing. I love how realistic wearing heavy armor is now. You cant run around like crazy with all that metal on you, and it makes sense. \r\nAlso the smithing mod fixed the Newby Crafting Quest, as with the Smithing Perks Overhaul I was using previously I couldnt craft the Iron Dagger as it renamed it to dunno what. \r\nThis mod has too few endoresments\r\n[...]\r\nawesome. \r\nas always[/quote]- alexi030289\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]One of the best perks overhaul mod, added much diversity, fun, and balanced. [/quote]- some1\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]First I\\'ve got to say that it\\'s great that you keep the mod modular Athyra. Being able to pick and choose goes a long way to make Skyrim fun. \r\n[...]\r\nThe Melee module is really good. I literally have nothing more to add than that. It is well balanced and a lot of fun. I have no idea how to improve upon it. [...] It\\'s obvious that you got a good feel for how to make combat fun. [...] Right now the Twohanded weapons rock, and one weapon in each hand is deadly.[/quote]- Wauthan\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]I must say you must be tired, cuz i think this mod impact was great for everybody who uses it and everybody come to you seeking for you to improve some of the aspects of it. :) [/quote]- Onigamibr\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]This just gets better and better.

I originally was only using the Archery portion, but after reading thru the comments I decided to try the whole pack. It is very well done!![/quote]- alricw\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]This mod package, in combination with mods that increase enemy variety and difficulty comes a long way towards \\'fixing\\' the vanilla game imo. [/quote]- Masthor\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]Got the same problem [...] but this mod is sooooo much awesome (Skyrim without ACE ? No way ! :p). So unless find which of my mods conflict ACE, i don\\'t take Eagle Eye 2/2 (1/2 works fine).\r\nAuthor\\'s note: - This problem was resolved using a clean save -[/quote]- Maise\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]wanted to let you know that this mod is VERY VERY enjoyable and makes archery more logical and therefor more rewarding.\r\n[...]\r\nstarted new journey, this time with focus on 1hand+ a bit archery. \r\ni must say the changed skilltree feels VERY GOOD. you get lots of choices for weapons, and you wont be able to just cherry-pick the best ones, because all of them are useful. \r\nso you wont be a one-man-army, but rather a specilized personality. \r\ni like that :) \r\nthanks again for further developing this mod, so far everything is GREAT \r\n[...]\r\nnow I\\'d like to thank you again for keeping up with this great mod and expanding it further and further! [/quote]- yaq\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]Love how you have evolved this project of yours Athyra. It just gets better and better every day, the decision to make other popular mods ACE-friendly is brilliant. :) Kudos![/quote]- ztrathego\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]Athyra a thousand thanks for listening to our suggestions[/quote]- Zalthre\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]Been playing around with this mod for awhile and I have to say that I\\'m impressed. The changes really balance what seem like rather broken mechanics in the vanilla game.[/quote]- JethroKirby\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]This is quickly becoming a one stop place for good bow mods with Athyra\\'s (frankly) awesome changes to bows.\r\n[...]\r\nA good sign your doing a good job with a mod is when people can\\'t wait for proposed changes. I found myself in such a position knowing that you were going to put this [update] out at some point today. Incredible work and I\\'m glad your taking other\\'s suggestions to heart as far as shaping this mod to completion.\r\n[...]\r\nLooks great, Athyra. Every point on the changelog I just kept saying \\\"Yes!\\\" over and over.[/quote]- zeromus88\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]Awesome. This is fast becming one of the best overhaul mods on the nexus. And thanks for speedy updates.\r\nGood to see a modder who understands that its important that their mod can be designed to work with other mods.[/quote]- Atardecer\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]Just wanted to drop by and say that I really love this project. I\\'ve been using it for a while, and now that I\\'m coming back to Skyrim, I\\'m going to try the latest version with one the ACE-compatible version of theycallmecheese\\'s dragonbone weapons (which I also love). Good work, Athyra![/quote]- jabarto\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]Thank you. Best perk mod, differences between heavy and light arm, one- and twohanded weapns, perfect craft balance. \r\nIf you change magic schools - it will be single perk mod on my PC. \r\nGood luck in modding![/quote]- letir\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]Love your work! Keep it up! I\\'m looking forward to the rest of your perk trees overhauls and Sneak in particular. =D[/quote]- FinalFrog\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]I must say, ever since I started using your perk mods, I\\'ve never played without them, ever again. It\\'s a refreshing and balanced change to the Perk trees, and I definitely recommend everyone to at least give it a try. Keep them coming ;D[/quote]- Yoshh\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]Bethesda should learn from this MOD, it\\'ll clearly become a complete and essential overhaul for those who want an improved and balanced game (not to mention realistic). I\\'m looking forward to see any changes in the Block tree and it\\'s Synergy bonuses. Thank you for creating this MOD and sharing it with us.[/quote]- Velkran\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]I totally love this mod it makes playing an archer fun and interesting again :) \r\nGreat job your doing. \r\nBtw I endorsed :)[/quote]- Quad2Core\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]i just wanted to thank you for making such a great mod Athyra! playing an archer was never as fun and rewarding as it is with your mod. \r\nsame goes for your other overhauls as well, keep up the great work :)[/quote]- MissAnthropist\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]Pretty essential mod for me, great work! I have noticed what other people have said about Deadly Combat making some bows very powerful, but it doesn\\'t bother me, mostly because I think longbows SHOULD be very powerful (historically speaking, they were a game-changer), but also because the nature of Deadly Combat means that you are pretty vulnerable to damage yourself, so the extra damage is offset. \r\n\r\nAmazing work, endorsed.[/quote]- maym_001\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]This mod makes archery much more interesting and balanced. I find having both long bows and short bows with different characteristics and uses to be very interesting. \r\n\r\nThank you Athyra for this great mod![/quote]- Liddan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[/center]",
