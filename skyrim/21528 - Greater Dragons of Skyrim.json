  "summary": "This adds ten greater dragons to Skyrim (warning: high level creatures). Battle them, slay them, marry them, it is not important. Just so long as you enjoy the mod, I do not care.",
  "descriptionHtml": "They can be found around most major towns (except solitude) and are level 65. I do not recommend this mod to anyone who is a low level, as the dragons attack fast and have high health. There is also one elder dragon, who is three times bigger than the normal dragons, and has upwards of 25X health and attack. He is located at Arcwind Point, and will most likely murder you completely.",
