  "summary": "Adds row boats to the island of Solstheim that can be used as a travel system to four different locations.  Also includes a knapsack to store items on your boat.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a boat at Raven Rock docks on Solstheim that can be used as a travel system.  There are four destinations in total...\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Raven Rock\r<br />[*]Tel Mithryn\r<br />[*]Haknir&#39;s Shoal\r<br />[*]Northshore Landing\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />The boat must be purchased for 150 gold before it can be used.  Activate the boat and a menu option will appear allowing you to purchase it.  \r<br />\r<br />To travel, simply activate the boat and chose your destination.  Choosing the [Open Knapsack] option will open up the boat&#39;s knapsack so that you can store items.\r<br />\r<br />The boat will only appear at the last destination that you traveled to.  If you can&#39;t remember where you left the boat, open up your world map and you will see its location as a map marker.\r<br />\r<br />The boat works in a similar way to fast travel, so time will have passed when you arrive at your destination.  Please be aware of this if you are using realism mods such as &#39;Realistic Needs and Diseases&#39; or &#39;Frostfall&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />[[b]Boat travel for vanilla Skyrim available here -----&gt; [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/46831/?]Realistic Boat Travel[/url][/b]]",
