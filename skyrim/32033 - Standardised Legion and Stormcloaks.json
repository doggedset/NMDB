  "modId": 32033.0,
  "modName": "Standardised Legion and Stormcloaks",
  "summary": "This mod is designed to make the empire seem more professional and better equiped when compared to the stormcloaks\r<br />Soldier armor and weapon sets have been standardised and all hold guards have been replaced with imperial or stormcloak troops",
  "descriptionHtml": "All hold guards will have the armor of whichever faction the hold supports.\r<br />\r<br />All imperial controlled holds will have the following...\r<br />imperial soldiers and hold guards wear a full set of standard imperial heavy armor and imperial weapons\r<br />imperial legates and guard captains wear a full set of standard imperial heavy armor and imperial weapons with officer helmet but no shield\r<br />Gerneral Tullius wears a full set of imperial heavy armor and imperial sword but no helmet or shield\r<br />\r<br />All Stormcloak controlled holds will have the following...\r<br />Stormcloaks and hold guards wear a full set of stormcloak armor with eastmarch shields and hide helmets\r<br />Stormcloak commanders and guard captains wear full set of stormcloak bear armor\r<br />\r<br />Holds that support the empire will have imperial equipment and holds that support the stormcloaks will have stormcloak equipment, of course the civil war will change the guards as required, so if you win as the imperials you will have imperials in every city and same with the stormcloaks,  it makes you actually feel like you accomplished something.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod so if I have missed something or overlooked anything please let me know and I will try to fix it.\r<br />\r<br />I have not done much testing of this with other mods so please advise if you have any difficulties, it might have trouble with other mods that change armor or armor textures perhaps\r<br />\r<br />I hope everyone enjoys the mod, now if you load a old game save the soldiers may be naked, new games should be unaffected. \r<br />if this occours you can either wait for about a month in game time for the soldiers to reset, start a new game or you can do this. \r<br />1. press the Tilde key ~ to open the console \r<br />2. left click on a soldier \r<br />3. type &#34;resetinventory&#34; without the quotation marks \r<br />4. press enter \r<br />5. repeat on every soldier you see\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
