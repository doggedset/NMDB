  "descriptionHtml": "currently borked\r\n\r\nif you equip an item that grants waterwalking, the effect still details waterbreathing (even though i changed it on the spell effect) and if you stand still you start to sink into the water - but you can jump back on to the surface\r\n\r\nso right now it\\'s a skipping stone instead of a constant effect (maybe this is why waterwalking isn\\'t available in skyrim :P)\r\n\r\nnecklace in Riften Fishery next to the strongbox, or a ring in Calixo\\'s Curiosities\r\n\r\ni\\'ve also added a few boots of muffling that were left out\r\n\r\nthe enchanted armor is there but i didn\\'t add it to any leveled lists yet because i didn\\'t want it to conflict with any other mod - so the only place to get the item is in the riften fishery - you can dischant it to enchant other items\r\n\r\nwaterwalking can be enchanted to rings, necklaces, foot clothing, and foot armor",
