  "modName": "Xenos Rest - WIP",
  "summary": "A player home with all that could be desired.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A player home located south-east of Riften.  It has everything you might want in a player home as well as a nice visual design and it is fun to move around in if I do say so myself.  Complete the quest Xeno\\'s Metamorphosis and this home could be yours.\r\n\r\nTalk to Uluthu or Xeno to start the quest. If you can\\'t initiate dialogue try saving the game and loading from that save. That should fix it. (Just hit F5 followed by F9 to quicksave and load.) \r\n\r\nThis mod does not require Dawnguard.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress, please excuse the unfinished nature of some areas.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUpdated on August 19th and added:\r\nFixed a few containers so they do not respawn. None of the containers in this home should respawn now.\r\nJail guards will become allies after the quest is complete. I still haven\\'t figured out how to make them arrest the player on sight.\r\nThe chain outside the hanging cage will teleport you to the adjacent ledge. We\\'ll just pretend it says \\'swing\\' instead of \\'open\\'.\r\nThe player can now crawl through the grate that looks into the wardens office from a hidden passageway. The stolen evidence chest is located in that office. It is a one way passage at the moment, I\\'ll think about whether I want to turn it into a two way door.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated on August 12 and added:\r\nExterior guards (called Thralls) that are hostile to the player when first encountered but are allies when the quest is complete.\r\nAncient Guardian (Big spriggan) who patrols the hallway and is hostile when first encountered and friendly after the quest is complete.\r\nAdded Zenkidu a smith.\r\nThe basement has had some major design changes.  I have also finished the navmesh and roombounds in the basement.\r\nThere are jail guards in the basement that will warn you that you are intruding and attack you and they can also arrest you if you commit a crim but their AI isn\\'t the best, I\\'ll work on that.\r\nA lot of other small things that I can\\'t remember.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFeatures I plan to add and fix:\r\nGuards AI!!! I want them to arrest the player on sight instead of warning and initiating combat.\r\nAdd clutter and containers to the basement.\r\nAdd clutter where the Thralls are located outside.\r\nAdd a vampire ambush to the encounter with Mosquiatti.\r\nFix the creepy mannequins so they don\\'t walk around or at least move them so you don\\'t see them when first entering the cell.\r\nFix weapon racks so they all display 2 handed weapons properly.\r\nAdd a Gollum-like npc in the sewer.\r\nAdd a new garden area that connects the mage apartment with the attic and the basement.\r\nAdd 1 or 2 more Thralls outside.\r\nMake AI packages so that the human NPC come and sandbox near the bar area at dinner time.\r\nMiniature eye of magnus decoration will become available after mages college is complete.\r\nSlade becomes available after thieves guild quest is complete.\r\nPotema\\'s Skull decoration after that quest is complete.\r\nZenkidu becomes available after companions quests.\r\nBurglar intruders for the Ancient Guardian to kill.\r\nMake it so the red orb in the basement turns on and off vampirism. (It looks cool at the moment but I want it to actually do something).\r\nMake it so the player can sit in the bath and become well rested.\r\n\r\nThis list just seems to get longer and longer.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a shortcut from the vault to the back of the fireplace downstairs. I thought I should mention that in case someone misses it, it makes repeated trips to the attic much easier.\r\n\r\nAs a little challenge, can you find Xeno\\'s skooma stash? (hint: think like a spider)\r\n\r\nI am such a slowpoke so this is still a work in progress. Any feedback, suggestions, praise or helpful criticism is always welcome.\r\n\r\nIf you notice any other bugs or if the paintings are missing or if the safe door in the attic isn\\'t there please let me know. I\\'m not quite sure if everything was archived.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCredit to a few over at the Skyrim Nexus:\r\nyourenotsupposedtobeinhere for a very nice rug\r\nDarkrder for some very nice paintings\r\njet4571 for telling me how to make a safe into a transition door",
