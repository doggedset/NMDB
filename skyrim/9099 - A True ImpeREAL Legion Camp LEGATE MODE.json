  "summary": "Brand new version 2.0! Now Legate mode where you as the player run the camp! Includes purchasable upgrades for the camp!",
  "descriptionHtml": "\r\nAfter the war, the former Pale camp commander, Legate Titulieus, chose to retire from his long military career. As the 4th Imperial Legion of the Imperial Empire newest Legate, you are the obvious replacement. As camp commander, there are many new things for you to do. First, you may ask any of your soldiers to follow you whenever you want, you run the morning formations, and you may also choose to fortify the camp. Visit Castle Dour and you will find a new Tribune who will sell you various upgrades to include a full smithy, horse stable, and to surround the camp with fortified walls.\r\nYou now are able to sleep in the Legateâ€™s tent and use his chest and end tables as safe storage. Make sure you read the letters sent to you from the General (they are in the chest near the bed). \r\n\r\nCHANGELOG for 2.0:\r\n- Legate Mode\r\n- Added purchasable upgrades for the camp.\r\n- Made everyone at the camp a potential follower.\r\n- Fixed user-reported bugs.\r\n- Even more spawn points for random encounters.\r\n",
