  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][center][font=Times New Roman]DESCRIPTION[/font][/center][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a new standalone armor (currently only for males) to the game called armor of the Listener. It suits assassin-like characters.\r<br />\r<br />Whole armor is considered light armor and can be found under the word wall in the Dark brotherhood sanctuary. It doesn´t matter if you have finished DB questline already it will be even in burnt up sanctary.  It has the same stats as nightingale armor but more useful enchantments. Weapons are made up of daedric arrow, nightingale bow and nightingale blade. Armor is combination of ebony mail and nightingale armor. EVERYTHING (exept hood, bow and sword) retextured to suit more Dark brotherhood style.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Times New Roman]RECOMMENDATIONS\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]I recommend you to use nightingale with a face with it, it should be fully compatible but didn´t tested myself[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]REQUIREMENTS[/size]\r<br />[size=2]\r<br />\r<br />This file is completely standalone and doesn´t require anything.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/font][center][size=6]\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />\r<br />[/size]To modder named vatakc for making the original mesh of the torso used in my mod[/center]",
