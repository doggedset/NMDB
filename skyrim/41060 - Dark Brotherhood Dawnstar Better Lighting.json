  "modName": "Dark Brotherhood Dawnstar Better Lighting",
  "summary": "This mod basically alters the lighting and atmosphere in the Dawnstar Sanctuary to increase immersion.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I altered the lighting and atmosphere inside the dawnstar sanctuary in order to give it this creepy dark feel to it. I always thought the dark brotherhood were an evil faction and was disappointed by how well lit the sanctuary was. I\\'ve also added a few quills and paper rolls here and there to make it appear as thought the tables are actually used.\r\n\r\nI would recommend this mod with Hail Dark Brotherhood - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25871/?tab=2&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D25871&pUp=1 to further increase the immersion.\r\n\r\nCheers! :D Please do let me know if you like it and perhaps I can re-light some other interiors.",
