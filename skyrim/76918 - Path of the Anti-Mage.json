  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=3][b][u]Thank you[/u][/b] to those who have sent me donations, know that I very much appreciate it and it is fueling my motivation to keep working on this mod and future mods I have planned.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=5]1.5.5 Changes\n<br />[/size][Spoiler]\n<br />1.5.5 [Spoiler]\n<br />[b][u]psisentry[/u][/b]\n<br />Places a psionic sentry, granting the caster vision of thesentry and creatures around it through walls. When an actor draws close, they will light up red indicating that they are within range and the sentry can be detonated, enemies that are close to the sentry take health damage (based on alteration). The explosion will also dispels magic, reduce their magic resistance for 1 minute, and slow their speed for 30seconds. Up to 3 sentries can be placed at once. Hold the trigger key for more than 1 second to force detonation on all your sentries at once.\n<br />\n<br />-         By default now allows up to 3 sentries at once\n<br />-         They will light up enemies within explosionrange red, allowing them to be detonated with the trigger key\n<br />-         Holding the trigger key for longer than 1 secondwill force all sentries to explode whether or not enemies are close enough\n<br />-         The ‘stalwart sentry’ upgrade now reduces theamount of sentries you can create to 1, in exchange for the ‘turret-like’\n<br />upgrade\n<br />-         New visuals for sentry (floating, pulsatingpinkish-purple crystals orbit the sentry)\n<br />-         No longer requires the target to not havedetected you\n<br />-         Will not stack, so detonating 3 sentries on thesame enemy will not deal their damage 3x, nor will the debuff to magic resist\n<br />of speed stack either\n<br />[b][u]\n<br />Psiblades[/u][/b]\n<br />-         Improved visuals for psiblades, now emit a fainttrail of purple-ish energy while also crackling strongly with a similar energy along the blades and around the hands\n<br />-         Still has a spell cost but will be ignored ifyou’re within an anti-magic zone allowing you to cast them even when in the\n<br />anti-magic zone.\n<br />-         Now benefit from power attacks (beyond justfiring a beam). Direct hits with a power attack using psionic blades will deal\n<br />1.5x damage.  Sneak attacks deal 2x(ontop of perks that increase sneak attack damage with spells, ie arcane\n<br />assassin and the like)\n<br />-         Added new upgrade option [i]Split[/i], which causes the ranged beams to deal 25% damage to enemiesnear the target.\n<br />[b][u]\n<br />Spell Steal (Now‘Counter Spell’)[/u][/b]\n<br />In my playing with this spell found it to be kinda clumsy. So,I’ve revamped it and renamed it to Counter Spell:\n<br />-         Counters a casting opponent. Any aggressive spells are instead cast back on them, while beneficial spells are instead cast\n<br />on you. This includes shouts.\n<br />-         However the original spell can be swapped backto via the upgrade shrine, for those who preferred that or wanna swap and\n<br />change as they see fit\n<br />[b][u]\n<br />Silence[/u][/b]\n<br />-         Having the max rank of cascading shadows will causeyour silence spell to fear enemies that are 10 levels or less below you for 3\n<br />seconds.\n<br />[b][u]\n<br />Shadowstep[/u][/b]\n<br />Improved functionality a bit, made the ‘teleport behind’part of the spell not trigger a cooldown. As well as visually show you where\n<br />it’s impacting\n<br /> \n<br />[b][u]\n<br />Devour Magic[/u][/b]\n<br />Now [i]actually [/i]restoresthe correct percentage of your total health pool, was previously only restoring\n<br />a percentage of your [i]base[/i] health poolmeaning not a whole lot at later levels.\n<br /> Now has an upgrade\n<br />-         Purge: Remove the cleanse effect of your devourmagic (removal of debuffs from friendlies) in exchange for a more vicious\n<br />purging of enemies’ buffs. Will now deal damage equal to the amount healed by\n<br />your devour magic to enemies who are affected by it, as well as slow their\n<br />movement by 30% for 10 seconds.\n<br />[b][u]\n<br />Dark Mending[/u][/b]\n<br />Now [i]actually [/i]restoresthe correct percentage of your total health pool, was previously only restoring\n<br />a percentage of your [i]base[/i] health poolmeaning not a whole lot at later levels.\n<br />[b][u]\n<br />Dark Charges[/u][/b]\n<br />Increase your chance to absorb spells per charge for magicka(like atronach stone) instead of magicka regeneration.\n<br />[/Spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />FAQ\n<br />[Spoiler]\n<br />FAQ\n<br />Q: Where can I get that armor?\n<br />A: Currently that armor is incomplete for all races/sexes, therefore it is kept out of current releases.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you release these spells on their own?\n<br />A: Unlikely I'm afraid, it would take quite a bit of work to detatch them from the current progression setup. \n<br />\n<br />Q: Future plans?\n<br />A: This mod is mostly where I'd consider it complete, however I am always adding things. Future updates will involve more adventure-type elements as opposed to spells though. I am also working on a new lands mod set in and around the Serathi Bog featured in this mod, I plan to have it link to the small chunk you visit in this mod. However this is far off and quite an endeavour to do solo.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Not a fan of (insert visual or way mechanic handles), can you change it?\n<br />A: Probably not since there will always be people who dislike something, however if you have a suggestion leave a comment, if I like it I may implement it later. I do plan to have alternate visuals eventually to things like the Psionic Blades.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Port to console?\n<br />A: No, sorry. But if you have the know-how in doing it pm me and we can work something out.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Face tats?\n<br />A: Check out Neithteam warpaints here on the nexus.\n<br />[/Spoiler]\n<br />[color=#efefef][size=2]\n<br />A HUGE Thanks to[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMQkYC9HUcPTertReHILVOA] Brodual[/url]﻿ for the comprehensive spotlight of my mod.\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]KYxeytMsOyE[/youtube]\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=5][u][b]\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Anti-Magic in Skyrim[/color][/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[i]\"There are several ways to describe this individual. Slayer of mages, sellsword, assassin of the wicked, the bane of vampires, even kinslayer applies to this man or woman. You see, to effectively hunt mages, you must become one. Indeed it is a cruel irony, to destroy that which you hate you must embrace it. Mage Hunters are not noble, nor are they sadistic. Some sell their expertise to the highest bidder, some live by a code of honor.  They hunt those that would sacrifice their mortality or morals to obtain power over others. Be them vampires, hagravens, briarhearts or rogue mages. With blade and spell, they purge the land of the wretched, no matter the cost to themselves.\" [url=http://tamrielvault.com/group/character-building/forum/topics/character-build-the-mage-hunter?page=2&amp;commentId=6452022%3AComment%3A889654&amp;x=1#6452022Comment889654][i]- An old, crippled scholar.[/i][/url]\n<br />[/i]\n<br />Travel to and explore a small part of a hidden land known as the Serathi Boglands hidden in the mountains between the eastern rift and morrowind.

The small amount of this area you gain access to is relatively desolate of life, however do not come unprepared, expect a fight.\n<br />\n<br />I highly suggest getting one of the mods that allow you to block whilst dual-wielding to use with this mod, as one of the spells equips you with dual-wielded anti-magic weapons and blocking with them will enable a ward.\n<br />\n<br />Thank you to Hirostormwolf for the video of my mod, however it is now outdated.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][color=#8e7cc3][size=5]The Perks[/size][/color][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Wombburn[/color][/b] Rank 1 -[i] Grants you the Mark of Shadow, stunting your magicka regeneration by 55% but increasing your resistance to all magic by 20%.[/i]\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Wombburn[/color][/b] Rank 2 - [i]Delve further into the shadow, stunting your magicka regeneration by 5% but increasing your resistance to all magic by 5%.[/i]\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Wombburn[/b] [/color]Rank 3 - [i]Delve further into the shadow, stunting your magicka regeneration by 5% but increasing your resistance to all magic by 5% and grants you the Darkcaster ability, which upon being hit by a spell, stores the energy as bonus magicka and magicka regeneration or use it to heal.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Shadow Mastery[/color][/b] Rank 1 - [i]Grants you two Anti-mage abilities; Occulent Sight, and Psionic Blades.[/i]\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Shadow Mastery[/color][/b] Rank 2 - [i]Grants you two more Anti-magical abilities; Silence, and Magic Biter weapon.[/i]\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Shadow Mastery [/color][/b]Rank 3 - [i]Grants you two Anti-mage abilities; Ignite Magicka, and Devour Magic.[/i]\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Shadow Mastery[/color][/b] Rank 4 - [i]Grants you two Anti-mage abilities; Spell Steal, and Shadow Step.[/i]\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Shadow Mastery[/b] [/color]Rank 5 - [i]Grants you one Anti-mage ability Anti-Magic Zone\n<br />\n<br />[i][i][b][color=#b4a7d6]Gifts of the Void[/color][/b] Rank 1 -[i] Grants you the Essence Font ability to temporarily transfer a portion of your Magicka into a target.[/i]\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6][i][i][i][b][color=#b4a7d6]Gifts of the Void[/color][/b][/i][/i][/i][/color][/b] Rank 2 -Grants you the Void Shatter ability; when cast at an enemy, consumes your Dark Charges and deals damage based on how much magicka they are missing from their total. [i][/i]\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b][i][i][i][b][color=#b4a7d6]Gifts of the Void[/color][/b][/i][/i][/i][/b] [/color]Rank 3 - [i]Increases the magicka transferred with Essence Font by 20%.

Also allows you to project the energy as an energy wave when power-attacking. This spell must be dual-wielded, and will be dispelled if you equip something in either hand. - It also takes 30 of your maximum magicka to maintain the spell now.[/i]\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]I highly suggest getting one of the mods that allow you to block whilst dual-wielding to use with this spell[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Anti-Magic Zone[/color][/b][i] - Creates a nullified zone around the caster, which makes all who are within it's bounds almost impervious  all forms of magic. The bounds of the sphere now block incoming and outgoing magical projectiles. Casting is near impossible within it's radius, and magicka is greatly reduced.\n<br />[/i]\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Dark Mending[/b] [/color][i]- Consumes your Dark Charge granted by Dark Caster to heal you. First charge is 20%, second 40% and third is 60% of your total health.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Occulent Sight[/color][/b][i] - Your eyes glow ominously as you now see most forms of magic upon the aether. Be it wielded magic, daedra (vampires too, but not undead) [i]or a creature with high magicka.[/i] Adds the ability to detect enchanted items lying around or in a container. Hold the hotkey slightly longer before release to detect magical items, instead of toggling off/on[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Devour Magic[/color] [/b][i]- Devours minor magic effects from the target to restore health. If the target is an enemy then the spell will devour beneficial magic. If the target is neutral or friendly, the spell instead devours negative effects.\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b][color=#b4a7d6]Enhance Weapon - Ignite Magicka[/color][/b] [i]- Enchants your weapon with \"Ignite Magicka\" properties, burning 5% of the targets magicka and dealing 142% of the burned magicka as damage.\n<br />[/i]\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Essence Font[/color][/b][i] - Transfer a portion of your magicka capacity to the target, After 10 seconds or if the target dies, the magicka will be restored.[/i]\n<br />[i]\n<br />[/i][b][color=#b4a7d6]Ignite Magicka[/color][/b] [i]- Ignite 50% of the magicka of an enemy, dealing 150% of the magicka burned as damage. The magicka burned is increased by 10% per perk rank of Mage Ire.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Shadow Dancer[/color][/b][i] - Enables or disables your use of Shadow Step. Tapping the assigned hotkey, Shadow Step allows you to blink roughly 3 feet in any direction, but not through obstructions. Holding the hotkey slightly longer before release will instead  lets you blink behind an enemy silently if they are in your crosshair and within range.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6][size=2]Silence[/size][/color][color=#b4a7d6][size=3] [/size][/color]- [/b][i]Silence an enemy, temporarily cutting off their magicka supply and interrupting their current spell.

Any aggressive spells are instead cast back on them, while beneficial spells are instead cast\n<br />on you.

Each level of Dark Charge multiplies the damage by +1. \n<br />\n<br />[/i][size=2][color=#8e7cc3][b]Mirror Image[/b][/color] – Create two illusions of yourself; copying all your currently worn gear as well. These will be equipped with bound weapons based on what you are wielding, and will follow you using a package that makes them stay on either of your flanks. Lasting 30 seconds, they will engage enemies and deal small amounts of damage, they are also not very tough, use them as a distraction! Recasting this spell will destroy existing images.[i]\n<br />\n<br />[/i][color=#8e7cc3][b]Psionic Sentry[/b][/color][b] – [/b]Places a psionic sentry, granting the caster vision of the sentry and creatures around it through walls. When an actor draws close, they will light up red indicating that they are within range and the sentry can be detonated, enemies that are close to the sentry take health damage (based on alteration). The explosion will also dispels magic, reduce their magic resistance for 1 minute, and slow their speed for 30seconds. Up to 3 sentries can be placed at once. Hold the trigger key for more than 1 second to force detonation on all your sentries at once.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][color=#b4a7d6][size=4]The Upgrade shrine\n<br />[/size][/color][/b][/u]Each of these upgrades will cost a daedra heart. They can be removed without cost, or swapped for another daedra heart.\n<br />[u][b][color=#b4a7d6][size=4]\n<br />[/size][/color][/b][/u]\n<br />[u]Mirror image[/u]\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3]Blurred Form [/color]- Each of your landed melee strikes have a 20% chance of creating another mirror image.

Moving or standing up will break the invisibility, 6 second cooldown. While melded, using your left power attack will fire a Empowered Blast, which will pierce through multiple enemies dealing x2 the amount of damage of a regular Psionic beam, as well as lower their magic resist by half of your alteration skill and their damage resist by x4 of half your alteration skill. Using the empowered blast will cost 50 of your magicka and break meld, causing it to be on cooldown for 20 seconds instead of 6.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#674ea7]Split[/color] - Your psi-beams will now split off of the target, dealing 25 percent damage to nearby enemies.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Counter Spell[/u]\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3]Spell Steal [/color]- Revert back to the older version of the spell, stealing the opponents equipped spells for a time and equipping them to the mirrored hands/power slots.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Psionic Sentry[/u]\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3]Stalwart Sentry [/color]- Reduce the number of sentries you can have at once to one. Whenever an enemy casts a spell within range and line of sight of the sentry, the sentry will fire a bolt of energy at the caster. Dealing damage to their health and stamina: The damage dealt is scaled with your alteration skill.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Shadow Step[/u]\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3]Shadow Strike[/color] - For a brief moment during your forward Shadow Step, your next melee attack will afflict your opponent with shadow poison.\n<br /> \n<br />[color=#8e7cc3]Dark Surge [/color]- After shadow stepping in any direction, chance to gain a 25 percent boost to your movement speed for 12 second.\n<br /> \n<br />[color=#8e7cc3]Lingering Shade [/color]- After shadow stepping in any direction,chance to turn invisible for 3 seconds.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][color=#b4a7d6][size=4]\n<br />Future Plans\n<br />[/size][/color][/b][/u][/size]More upgrades\n<br />This mod is mostly where I'd consider it complete, however I am always adding things. Future updates will involve more adventure-type elements as opposed to spells though. I am also working on a new lands mod set in and around the Serathi Bog featured in this mod, I plan to have it link to the small chunk you visit in this mod. However this is far off and quite an endeavour to do solo.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][color=#b4a7d6][size=4]Requirements[/size][/color]\n<br />[/b][/u]\n<br />This mod requires SKSE, the Dawnguard DLC, and the Dragonborn DLC.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][color=#b4a7d6][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/color]\n<br />[/b][/u]\n<br />As of 1.0, should not be any incompatability issues as this mod no longer edits any vanilla settings.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][color=#b4a7d6][size=4]Install[/size][/color]\n<br />[/b][/u]\n<br />Drop the contents of the .zip into your data folder and check it in the skyrim launcher/mod loader of choice. Please ensure to check the readme.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][color=#b4a7d6][size=4]Updating to 1.5[/size][/color][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Unfortunately if you have any other version in your save game, there is no way to update without many problems. This update will require a fresh save or new game.\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#b4a7d6][size=3][b]Uninstall [/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[/u]\n<br />I'd advise from removing this mod from a save it is baked into, but if you do then be sure to open the console with the tilde (`) key and type 'stopquest AM_WeaponSpellsHandlerQuest', 'AM_MirrorImageHandler' and 'AM_ShrineHandlerQuest' without the inverted hyphens. In addition, use the console to remove all the perks from your character, as not doing this will leave your character with some stats permanently altered. After that, simply remove the .esp and bsa file.\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6][size=3]\n<br />[b][u]Credits[/u][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Bethesda for making the game.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/4950996/?]ChizFoShiz[/url] for giving me permission to use elements of his mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32237/?]Imbued Weapons[/url] to help me make this mod.
