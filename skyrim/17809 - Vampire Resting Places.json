  "descriptionHtml": "We\\'ve all been there.  You\\'re a vampire, you\\'re tired and the sun is coming up.  Normally this would be the ideal time to head back to your castle or cave and rest after a hard night terrorizing the local population.  But calamity! You\\'ve been having so much fun draining folk dry that you\\'ve lost track of time and now you can\\'t make it back to your lair before sun up!  Well that\\'s a problem no longer!\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a sleepable coffin bed to every Hall of the Dead in Skyrim. With the exception of Falkreath. Because their Hall is just a cottage and the residents would probably notice a stonking great coffin sitting in their living room..\r\n\r\nAll credit for this mod goes to AmethystDeceiver for his/her great sleepable coffin resource found here: \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17583\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\n- Unpack the Zip to your Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\nManual Uninstallation:\r\nDelete the following files:\r\n-ksVampireRestingPlaces.esp\r\nDelete the following folders:\r\n-ksVampirebedsmesh\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\nFor permissions regarding the coffin resource, please refer to AmethystDeceiver\\'s mod (link provided above).  I can\\'t give permission to use this mod because it isn\\'t really my work.\r\n",
