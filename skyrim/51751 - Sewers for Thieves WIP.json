  "descriptionHtml": "This WIP mod adds sewers and Thieves&#39; Guild hideouts to the cities of Markarth, Solitude, and Whiterun. There&#39;s also a back door from the Ratway out to the docks of Riften.\r<br />\r<br />Each city has at least one back door into and out of the city, and at least one door into the city itself. The sewers also connect to most buildings, although most people tend to lock their sewers tighter than their front door...\r<br />\r<br />Each city has a TG hideout, some of which include another back door away from the city. TG hideouts are currently opened using the Guild Master Tribute Chest Key and include lots of cool stuff, but they do not refresh, so once you take it, it&#39;s gone&#33; They also include crafting stations and beds.\r<br />\r<br />I intend to keep expanding this mod quite a bit. My future plans include Windhelm and finishing the outskirts of Whiterun, Solitude, and Markarth. I also want to add some NPCs to the Thieves&#39; hideouts. And of course, I&#39;d like to hear anyone&#39;s suggestions&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Install: Just put the .esp in your Skyrim/Data folder.",
