  "summary": "Adds a basic bow and arrows for those who may need it when making a new character in the hunterborn mod. Requires hunterborn.",
  "descriptionHtml": "REQUIRES HUNTERBORN!\n<br />\n<br />Get Hunterborn Here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33201/?\n<br />\n<br />This is a small mod I made after I figured out how easy it is to add scrimshaw recipes to hunterborn. The player has access to these recipes the moment they activate Hunterborn and are given the scrimshaw ability.\n<br />\n<br />The Crude Wooden Bow deals 4 base damage(2 less then the longbow, and yes it says 8 in the image due to archery perks the character in the image has.) and uses the longbow's model, so if you have a mod that changes how your longbow looks, it will also change how the crude wooden bow looks.\n<br />\n<br />The Crude Wooden Bow takes 1 firewood and 2 leather strips to craft, and is crafted via scrimshaw.\n<br />\n<br />Wooden Arrows are basic arrows, crafted with only 1 firewood in scrimshaw, they deal only 1 damage though so don't completely rely on them! Crafting makes 10 each.",
