  "modName": "Deathbrand Two-handed Gauntlets",
  "summary": "Instead of +10% one-handed damage, Deathbrand Gauntlets now grant +10% two-handed damage for each piece of the set equipped.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple modification of the Deathbrand Gauntlets\\' enchantment, replacing the +10% one-handed damage bonus per equipped piece with +10% two-handed damage. I created this mod because I wanted to use the Bloodskal Blade alongside the Deathbrand set without forfeiting the gauntlets\\' enchantment bonus.\r\n\r\nPresumably, this mod will lower Haknir Death-Brand\\'s attack damage when you fight his spirit in Gyldenhuk Barrow, since he will no longer have +40% one-handed damage for his dual scimitars. For this reason, I recommend installing this mod after defeating him.\r\n\r\nObviously, the Dragonborn DLC is required for this mod.\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs and I will do my best to fix them.",
