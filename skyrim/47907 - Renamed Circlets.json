  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][size=2]Renamed Circlets[/size][/b][/center]\r\n\r\nThe way circlets are named has always bugged me. Most jewelry was in the format of, say, \"Gold Emerald Ring\". Not so with circlets; they were in the format of \"Gold and Emerald Circlet.\" I decided I would find a mod that renamed them by removing the redundant \"and\" in the name since I figured it would already have been done. Surprisingly, I found none - at least, none that I saw - which led me to create this mod.\r\n\r\nOnly requirement is that you have the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19]Unofficial Skyrim Patch[/url], as this mod incorporates some of its bug fixes. Can also be merged with a Bashed Patch to keep the plugin count down.\r\n\r\nOther recommended jewelry related mods:\r\n * [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6495]Better circlets HQ[/url]\r\n * [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27038]Jewels of the Nord - HD rings and necklaces[/url]\r\n * [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8361]Expanded Jewelry Crafting[/url]\r\n * [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4417]Craftable Circlets[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Like this mod?
