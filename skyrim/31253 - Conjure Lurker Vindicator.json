  "descriptionHtml": "My first attempt at a mod, was intended for my own interests but thought I could share.\r\n\r\nIts a two-handed master conjuration spell that can be bought of pretty much any wizard in Skyrim at a base cost of around 1000 gold, magicka base cost is around 750.\r\n\r\nI dont know how (or if its possible) to make the spell synergise with any of the conjuration perks. Hope you enjoy what Id say is one of the most badass daedra in the game!",
