  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=green][font=\\\"Impact\\\"][size=9]Caitlyn\\'s Echo[/size][/font][/color][/center]\r\n[line]\r\n[center][color=green][font=\\\"SanSerif\\\"][size=3]You would break our bargain? You dare to trifle with me? Take care, mortal. Clavicus Vile watches you now. And waits.\r\n-Clavicus Vile[/size][/font][/color][/center]\r\n[line]\r\n[center]A deal gone wrong, a bad decision, it\\'s what Vile does best. The temptation to trust the untrustworthy is sometimes fueled by greed, other times by fear. This mod presents a custom Spriggan Wolf follower and a journal that details exactly what happened to the soul of poor Caitlyn Perore.[/center] \r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[*]The Spriggan Wolf is like a dog follower, to \\\"recruit\\\" her, you simply activate it. No dialogue will pop up. If you activate again the wait/favor/dismiss dialogue will pop up.[/*]\r\n[*]It is an essential follower that has custom abilities and attacks (3 possible shouts randomly used when it \\\"power attacks\\\", witbane on some power attacks, shock touch on some normal attacks) and uses the WOLF combat AI, utilizes the Dog Behavior files for the \\\"pet\\\" idles (laying down, wagging tail, etc) BUT I CHANGED SOME BEHAVIOR FILES SO THAT IT DOESN\\'T BARK AND BECOME ANNOYING. It still does a very random \\\"wolf bark\\\" from time to time but it\\'s a gruff, quick, spaced out bark. It\\'s not going to drive you crazy like Vigilance or Barbas and what i changed will also quiet them down a little. IF YOU WANT THEM ALL TO BARK LIKE CRAZIES, simply remove the files in the meshes/actor/canine/behavior folder[/*]\r\n[*]The journal that tells you where the Spriggan Wolf is located is in Haemar\\'s Shame, under the desk in the pit area right before you get to Haemar\\'s Cavern. You do not need to get the journal first, but it tells the story about the Spriggan Wolf and how it came to be.[/*]\r\n[*]INSTALL WITH NMM or simply merge this data folder with your skyrim/data folder[/*]\r\n[*]Compatible with most mods. As for follower mods, I use it with AFT and use the spell to create a follower (just bypass the warning dialogue) since some other mods can prevent the MANAGE WITH AFT text from showing up by default.[/*]\r\n[*]Seems to work best with 100+ mod setups when loaded EARLY in the load order, although I\\'ve tried it early and late and it seems to work fine. It shouldn\\'t modify anything that other mods touch and vice versa[/*]\r\n[*]DOES USE 4 SCRIPTS. If you don\\'t know by now, Skyrim saves work best when you don\\'t uninstall anything that was installed and used scripts. Skyrim is NOT mid-save uninstall-friendly[/*]\r\n[*]You can install on a fresh game or old save. Just finish unbound before you attempt to go recruit Spriggan Wolf[/*]\r\n[*]Levels 1-100 with the player[/*]\r\n[*]You can patch it in with skyre/other java patchers or put it on the block list. I didn\\'t notice a difference either way[/*][/ul]\r\n[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img825/1980/clavicusvilemask.png[/img][img=right]http://imageshack.us/a/img825/1980/clavicusvilemask.png[/img]",
