  "descriptionHtml": "For those seeking a truly insane challenge, this mod makes your weakest enemies almost completely random and unleveled. Just inside Bleak Falls Sanctum might be a Draugr and two Restless Draugr--or just as likely two Draugr Wights and a Draugr Deathlord.\r\n\r\nThis mod works by altering the generic scaling factor used to generate the easiest leveled enemies. In vanilla Skyrim, these are randomly selected from entries on the leveled list not exceeding 33% of your level. With this mod, that upper limit is increased to 999%. Thus, the enemies spawned are (in most cases) just as likely to be level 1 as level 50.\r\n\r\nThis mod is designed to complement \\\"Immersive Difficulty Levels\\\" ([url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35569]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35569[/url]). If you use that mod, put it above this in the load order. Your chosen Immersive Difficulty Level will still affect all but the easiest leveled enemies.\r\n\r\nThis mod can also be found on Steam Workshop at [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=139995969]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=139995969[/url].\r\n\r\nIf you find any bugs or issues, please note them in the comments so I can promptly address them.",
