  "descriptionHtml": "What does this mod do? \r\n\r\nThis mod modifies how the \\'quick reflexes\\' perk is triggered. You still need to wait for an opponent to start a powerattack, but now simply pressing the block button will not trigger the slow time effect. \r\n\r\nYou need to press the block button AND stay still. This means that if you\\'re blocking but also moving in some direction (forward, backwards, to the sides...) the perk won\\'t trigger. If you block and also don\\'t press any directional key, then the perk will trigger (if the enemy is powerattacking of course). \r\n\r\nWhy the change?\r\n\r\nAfter getting the \\'quick reflexes\\' perk I realized that even though it was a nice move, the perk triggered much more often than I wanted. The OPTION to slow down time and stylishly evade a powerattack was very cool, but using it against every single powerattack felt cheap. That\\'s why I thought: when facing a powerattack, it would be good to be able to decide if I want to use quick reflexes or not. And from this idea, this mod was born. \r\n\r\nHow to install: \r\n\r\nSimply drop the \\'QRtweak.esp\\' in your data folder. \r\n\r\nHow to uninstall: \r\n\r\nSimply delete the \\'QRtweak.esp\\' from your data folder. \r\n\r\nPrograms used: \r\n\r\nSkyEdit v0.041a\r\n\r\n",
