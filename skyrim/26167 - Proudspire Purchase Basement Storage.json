  "summary": "Buy inobtrusively placed storage for the Proudspire basement from the Steward. Does not move or alter any of the original basement contents.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Rather then an over the top remodelling of Proudspire, this mod simply allows you to purchase a few convenient storage items for your basement from the Steward at the Blue Palace for 1500 gold. There are two versions, the second with a few more storage items than the first if the first doesn\\'t have enough for you to organise everything. Neither version moves or alters any objects in the original basement layout. \r\n\r\nYou can safely try out version 1 and then upgrade to version 2 if you later decide you want a few more storage items. You won\\'t need to revisit the Steward and spend more gold after upgrading or empty the chests before you upgrade.\r\n\r\nFor your 1500 gold, in version 1 you get one satchel on each crafting table, a small chest by the enchanting table, a low shelf by the enchanting table with a strongbox on it, another chest inside the back door with a shelf over it with two more strongboxes, and two chests by the weapon racks.\r\n\r\nIn version 2, you get an additional two chests by the back door, a second strongbox on the shelf by the enchanting table, a chest on top of the bookcases by the alchemy table, and two safes, one in each corner of the enchanting room.\r\n\r\nBecause the mod places satchels on top of the alchemy and enchanting tables, you should make sure you can afford to buy those upgrades from the steward in addition to this one.\r\n\r\nWith thanks to DatenThielt for his informative tutorial.",
