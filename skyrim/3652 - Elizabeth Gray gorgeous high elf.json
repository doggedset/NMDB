  "descriptionHtml": "Elizabeth was left by her parents when she was just a child, later adopted by an old breton trader, who saw great potential in her. She taught he different trading tricks, while she also developed a natural skill in Illusion school of magic. They were quiet succesful with the trade, either thanks to her mentor\\'s honeyed words or her magical tricks. But with success comes danger. A group of mercenaries was hired to \\\"shut down\\\" their trade house, by killing them and setting the place on fire. Elizabeth\\'s mentor died from their blade, but the young elf managed to escape. She realized that there\\'s a price set for her head, so there was nothing left for her in the Imperial City. So Elizabeth traveled to Skyrim, seeking fortune in the fires of the civil war burning there. Her skills in trade, as she thought, would help her to stand up on her feet again and find out who\\'s the person behind those mercenaries.\r\nP.s. Mods used - Bella\\'s Female faces, clean female bodies.\r\nP.S. Start = Helgen keep, Imperial. I added executionhood for full immerse into whole \\\"Execution\\\" thing. it costs nothing and gives no stats or whatever so u can just throw it away",
