I have been ultra busy getting ready for my freshman year of college. Now that I have moved into my dorm and am almost done with my first week of classes (Whoohoo!) I will sit down and figure out what the armor value/weight/price/damage and other stats of each weapon and armor piece should be and send them off to daantje987 who has been waiting patiently for them. Expect stand-alone armor and weapons as separate downloads very soon. Sorry for the delay!\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUpdate:\r\nAugust 01, 2012\r\nHey there every one! The armor is currently being worked on by the diligent daantje987 to make the armor and weapon set two separate stand alone files. That\\'s right, I\\'m done modding the daedric weapons to make them glowing white and gold in the same fashion as the armor!\r\nAs is in the unreleased version, the armor is craftable with the normal daedric armor ingredients plus some gold and silver bars, the amount depending on how large the piece being made is. The added metal will increase the armor value and weight by 15%. I\\'m not sure how this would affect combat, so just adjust difficulty. \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPlanned Improvements:\r\nThere are plans to make this armor a reward for completing a short quest line!\r\nWeapons will be stand alone and crafted/improved under same rules as armor.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nVersion 0.75\r\nJuly 30, 2012\r\nExtra gold detailing on the chest, neck, back, and boots. The red glow has been corrected to match the armor, and a shield has been added!\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nVersion 0.5\r\nJuly 28, 2012\r\nThis is is a re-texture, not a stand alone armor set. This armor is being worked into a stand alone set of armor and will be craft-able and also obtainable through a small questline that is in the works.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------",
