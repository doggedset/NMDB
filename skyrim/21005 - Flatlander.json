  "descriptionHtml": "::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\nFlatlander Town by M-7\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n\r\nJuly 18, 2012.\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\nWhile adventuring through Helgen, you stumbled upon a staircase in the hills nearby.\r\nThe stairs led to a small hole in the mountainside, and into this mysterious tunnel you \r\nentered a new realm, hidden by the high cliffs above... The Town of Flatlander beckons.\r\nYou peer across the locked gates, wondering who owns this out-of-place village; then you \r\nrealize it is largely abandoned, except for the local merchant and the Fence in the Town\\'s\r\nTemple.  Upon further investigation, you are tempted to explore the majestic trappings of\r\na missing King: his well-kept home with its more than ample storage space; all the craft devices\r\nyou require in skyrim, and an indoor pool below.\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\nIdeally situated near the start of the game, this town/player home/merchants Mod is yours for the taking, and it has leveled items and some constructive items in the Cooking/Blacksmith skills (the cooking items are based on historical research adapted to Skyrim).  I have tested this mod for conflicts with other mods I designed.  Any feedback for better performance & voting is appreciated!  \r\n\r\n::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\nFlatlander:\r\n\r\nV.1.0  \r\n\r\n- M7, TES-V: Skyrim, 2012.\r\n\r\n::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\nRated 3 Stars out of 5 Stars (so far) on Steam Workshop!\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n\r\n- Fixed Navmesh with \\\"Finalize Navmesh\\\" on all doorways and in tunnel.  (includes exteriors).\r\n\r\nM7 2012.\r\n\r\n",
