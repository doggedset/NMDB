  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a tavern to Whiterun \r<br />called Hall of the Followers. This\r<br />tavern contains followers that use\r<br />different weapons and fighting styles.\r<br />The followers are not fully voiced as\r<br />of now, they use the default voices\r<br />that Bethesda made. I may or may not\r<br />look for voice actors to voice the\r<br />followers. In later updates, I will\r<br />add a back story to each of the followers.\r<br />The followers are as follows.\r<br />\r<br />=====================================\r<br />\r<br />Arkon Soul-Bane: Heavy Armor/Two-Handed | Nord\r<br />\r<br />Ambreth: Mage | Dunmer\r<br />\r<br />Ak&#39;Hir: Assassin? | Khajit\r<br />\r<br />Calvario: Light Armor/One Handed | Imperial\r<br />\r<br />=====================================\r<br />\r<br />There is also a merchant added to the tavern\r<br />named Abevild, who is a Nord female and has\r<br />a hunters inventory.\r<br />\r<br />=====================================\r<br />\r<br />Please make sure to leave feedback on the mod.\r<br />This is my second mod and I want it to be as\r<br />good as possible. Also post if you would like\r<br />to voice act for one of the followers or the\r<br />merchant.\r<br />\r<br />Also note that the location of Ysoldas house was moved. I liked the location better for the hall. Since Ysolda is scripted to go through the door of her home, change of location should not matter.\r<br />",
