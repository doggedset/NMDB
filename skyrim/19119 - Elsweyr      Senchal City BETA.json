  "descriptionHtml": "NEWS UPDATE: I Am working on this mod, creating a jungle tree by tree takes a little time. Update soon\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Elsweyr: Senchal City~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UPDATE: Ver. 0.4.0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n-0.4.0: Fixed bugs, Changed ground Textures, Changed and added Trees, Created the final section outline for the city, started creating areas beyond city walls, Added a banner (from Moonpath to Elsweyr, GREAT MOD); And many more bits I\\'ve probably forgotten\r\n-0.3.5: Added Crime Faction (Currently Inactive as it causes Crashes)\r\n-0.3.2: Bug-fixes\r\n-0.3.0: Tavern has an inside (Very Basic), Also Customs office now set up\r\n-0.2.0: You can now enter Senchal Through the docks at solitude, there is a trapdoor on one of the boats.\r\n-0.1.6: Bugfixes\r\n-0.1.0: [open Beta]\r\n\r\nUp-Next: MORE Insides to some of the buildings\r\nComing soon: Merchants, Blacksmiths and more unique NPCs\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nOk, This is my first published Mod for Skyrim.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this Mod is as a beginning of creating areas from the land of Elsweyr using information taken from the books within skyrim, oblivion and morrowind. I started with Senchal as it was, in my opinion, a nice idea for a city, and something a bit different from anything else in Skyrim so far.\r\n\r\nThis is a VERY unfinished version of the Mod. With only 4 or 5 areas within Senchal Built so far. This includes:\r\n\r\n-The Main Docks\r\n-The Market Place\r\n-Housing Area\r\n-poor area\r\n\r\nThis is a very early version and I want lots of constructive feedback (please no haters, if you dont like the idea, dont use it)\r\n\r\nSo far there are only a few NPC\\'s in the city, including a few guards and a couple of other NPC\\'s. This is in no way representative of the population that will be in the final release, but as NPC\\'s and navmeshing for them is something best done once ive built the city, Im saving a lot of NPC\\'s until later development.\r\n\r\nPlease Don\\'t re-publish/re-release my Mod, as I\\'m putting a lot of work into it and would rather take credit ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you, and Enjoy\r\n\r\n=====================================================================================\r\n--CREDITS--\r\nRedarrow141 (ME) - Design and layout of city and areas\r\nMuppetPuppet - Allowing me to use objects from his mod Moonpath to Elsweyr \r\nBethesda - For creating such a good game, and allowing us to make mods for it.
