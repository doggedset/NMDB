  "descriptionHtml": "NO LONGER ACTIVE ON THIS MOD. \r\nSorry, I lost all the files for this and deiced to start my own new race. All my effort is for the new one. I might come back to this if people ask enough and I finish my new one. Sorry and thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod ever, so please keep that in consideration and this is still a work in progress, thank you. Read Issues section for known problems.The mod will now overwrite, Wyldsong\\'s, BUT you will be able to play as all elements and normal Noiral. And please post a comment. Your feedback would be nice. You MUST have Wyldsong\\'s The Noiral VERSION 1.5+ for this to work. I am going to add more screens/art on this page. MALE ICE NOIRALS ADDED! \r\n\r\nNew optional with lower health regen for those who thought it was a bit too fast. Just download the main 0.9b then the optional. When installing do NOT hit upgrade, say yes to overwriting. Only works with 0.9b.\r\n\r\nThis is an add-on race for Wyldsong\\'s Noiral called the Element Noirals, as of now it is only UNP. This mod aims to add specific magic type versions of Wyldsong\\'s Noiral. A link can be found in the required files section just about download button.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/91194398@N08/8289175250/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8205/8289175250_b29b0f9046_c.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Noiral are a race of Nords that fallow the teachings of Thadgeir the Tattooed hero of the Atmoran Civil war, and one of Ysgramor\\'s five hungered companions. In the manuscripts of Thadgeir held secrets of great power and only the select few who mastered the rituals and sequestered themselves in the wilds, were granted the knowledge. Few of the Noirals learned to wield the true fires of the primal flame, the harsh bite of the primal frost and thus was branded with special symbols thought to increase ties between the body and the flame, frost.\r\n\r\nFor more lore on the Noirals, visit Wyldsong\\'s original Noiral.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/91194398@N08/8288115731/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8060/8288115731_a50ece9b0d_c.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nThe Elemental Noirals are made to be played in a tougher Skyrim. I may make a version based off of Wyldsong\\'s Weakened Noiral.\r\n\r\nThe Fire Noiral:\r\n\r\nYou deal 100% more fire damage\r\nYou don\\'t have Wyldsong\\'s Runic Resistance but...\r\nYou have 50% fire resistance, but 50% frost weakness\r\nPrimal Flame: a new fire cloak\r\nNew red runes \r\n\r\nDestruction 10\r\nConjuration 8\r\nEnchanting 10\r\nTwo-Handed 7\r\nOne-Handed 9\r\nHeavy Armor 9\r\nLight Armor 7\r\n\r\nThe Ice Noiral\r\n\r\nYou deal 100% more ice damage\r\nYou don\\'t have Wyldsong\\'s Runic Resistance but...\r\nYou have 50% ice resistance, but 50% fire weakness\r\nPrimal Frost: a new Primal Aura\r\nArctic Runes: Super frost resist but super fire weakness\r\nBound Ice Sword: Summon a sword of ice to fight with. Note: Still WIP - model looks bad, srry.\r\nNew blue runes\r\n\r\nDestruction 10\r\nConjuration 10\r\nEnchanting 9\r\nTwo-Handed 8\r\nOne-Handed 9\r\nHeavy Armor 5\r\nLight Armor 9\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/91194398@N08/8288115459/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8078/8288115459_57167d9819_c.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWyldsong\\'s Noiral v1.5 - His esp MUST be installed first. When installing mine say YES to overwriting.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/91194398@N08/8289174894/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8080/8289174894_1f71d6b265_c.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nNoirals are greatly hindered when a Vampire, as vampires are creatures of the frost. You lose access to some abilities and lesser stats.\r\n\r\nVamperic Runes: 150% stronger fire and a fire resistance of 25% but a 50% weakness to frost...(sadly not working yet)\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/91194398@N08/8289175296/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8075/8289175296_aeb928b193_c.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Elemental Noirals should be ready for Dawngruard but if any issues arise please post an comment.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/91194398@N08/8288112193/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8057/8288112193_b183d1541d_c.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod was created due to the work of many talented modders and with out them this mod would not have existed.\r\n\r\nWyldsong and the origanal Noiral\r\nappachii and AppachiiSkyHair\r\nChris57 and Better Males\r\nKrisan and Spectral Shades\r\ndimon99 and UNP\r\nchrisvorster and Better Male Skeletons\r\nning999 and The Skeleton of Female Models\r\nexpired6978 and Creating a Playable Race\r\nTMPhoenix and RaceCompatiblity for Dawnguard\r\n\r\nThank you Obsidian Dawn for the awesome runes and circles!\r\n\r\nAlso those who help Wyldsong make his orignial Noiral.\r\n           \\\"Arisen1 for creating the new Primal Avatar skin, Primal Dragon skin and the Primal Bear     Skin, as well as the original textures for FrostFyre and Reaver, check out some of her work: Cuter Animal Textures\r\n\r\nmkta for allowing me the use of the Nature Spells mod as the basis for two primal spells, check out the original mod here: Nature Spells\r\n\r\njaredbangerter for the tutorial on creating playable monsters and making them into polymorph spells: How to play as Monsters in Skyrim\r\n\r\nJeremie, without whose mod I would not have figured out the scripting for the Primal Bear Form to allow for the transformation back without the beast blood ritual: Druidism Skill Tree\r\n\r\nd_rail1602 for coming up with the Custom Races mod, which got me started on this and whose mod helped me figure what I was doing wrong after some reverse engineering=) \r\n\r\nAs well, thanks to Obsidian Dawn for the rocking arcane designs, they really helped bring the vision of the Noiral to life!\r\n\r\nAnd another big thanks to ratrace, whose insights and recommendations made v1.4 possible!

Also, there is most likely issues in mine not present in his. I am sorry I am new to CK and it may take me awhile to fix issues, but I will try my hardest to product results. \r\n\r\n- Issue while in the race menu were only some or none of the head parts (eyes, hairs, etc) are there, to fix switch to a preset and they will all return.\r\n\r\n- When you turn invisible your eyes disappear, you can fix this by saving and then loading.\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/91194398@N08/8289171796/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8070/8289171796_5bda0e9627_c.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n0.9b Ice Males.
