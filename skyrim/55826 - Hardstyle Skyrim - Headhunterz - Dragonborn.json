  "descriptionHtml": "Changes the music in the main menu to the FREE hardstyle release of Headhunterz in 2012 - Dragonborn. Intro and outro were cut because they were not lore-friendly enough. \r<br />The quality was reduced as well. Check out the original in full quality here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaiHTvifGt0\r<br />\r<br />I know there was already a mod created similar to this but I&#39;m actually learning to mod skyrim and wanted to share my own version.\r<br />I do not claim to have created the track used, it was made by the music producer Headhunterz/Willem Rebergen as a FREE release.\r<br />All credit for the track goes to him. Please check out his website: https://www.headhunterz.com/\r<br />\r<br />Big thanks to arecaidianfox for his wav to xwm converter.
