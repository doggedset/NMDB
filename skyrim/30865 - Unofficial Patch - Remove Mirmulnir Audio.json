  "descriptionHtml": "All this does is add silent voice files for Mirmulnir, normally you wouldn\\'t need these but the unofficial patch added a new voice actor for these unused lines, some don\\'t like the change so this lets them bypass it as these loose files take precedence over the USKP\\'s BSA file.\r\n\r\nCredits:  I\\'ve reused a silent audio file with authorisation from the mod \\'SILENT Level Up Noise\\' by AlturDrake located here (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26049), I could have made a new silent file just for this but I find re-inventing the wheel when one is already available to use and with authorisation gained a silly waste of time so my thanks to AlturDrake for the permission to re-use his audio asset.",
