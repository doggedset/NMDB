  "descriptionHtml": "The Dawnstar Sanctuary reveals yet another secret possession of the Dark Brotherhood...a mysterious dagger forged from black meteoric iron, powerful and swift in its own right but also bestowed with a health- and stamina-absorbing enchantment. Its blade glows with a series of star-like brilliances, marking it as a unique item in the Skyrim world.\r\n\r\nThe dagger is to be found in a small Weapon Chest located in one of the lower back rooms of the Sanctuary, in the sleeping quarters of members of the Dark Brotherhood. Its usefulness in \\\"black ops\\\" missions seems very real...\r\n\r\nAnd now its brother, the Celestial Dagger, has been identified in the Thieves Guild...check that mod separately.",
