  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE\r\nThis is version 2 of my previous and first mod I\\'ve ever done. I basically took the advice I read from a comment and added some white back into the robe feathers. I also changed the hood to a dark red. Overall I\\'m very impressed and like my new version better. If interested check out the original here http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1058\r\n\r\n**********\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nI just got my Archrobes in game and while I like the look I honestly wanted something more arrogant and gaughty. I mean hey, I\\'m the archmage. I call it Sunburst as it kind of reminds me of the sunburst effect on numerous Gibson guitars.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\nTo install all you need to do is extract the file to your Data folder for Skyrim.\r\n\r\n**********\r\n\r\nPlease leave comments and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n",
