Lasts 60 seconds. Afterwords the spell is removed from the player for 5 minutes and re-appears after that time period (I was lazy)\r<br />\r<br />The chicken will only start going crazy if the player was in combat on summon or if it gets into combat via normal aggro. \r<br />\r<br />The chicken cannot initiate combat with non hostiles.\r<br />\r<br />The chicken will NOT hurt non-hostiles (As far as I can tell)\r<br />\r<br />The chicken cannot zone through doors\r<br />\r<br />The chicken CAN zone through auto-load doors, which will just bug out the camera until the spell wears off\r<br />\r<br />The player character is basically just invisible and invulnerable during and constantly translating to the chicken at mach 3 so exterior zones will load fine\r<br />\r<br />The chicken controls like a chicken, it seems to have no reverse so.. yolo?",
