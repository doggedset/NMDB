  "descriptionHtml": "Update:\r\n\r\nThis is a savegame of mine where I own all the vanilla houses in the game. I added my save game right after I completed the main quest, in case you don\\'t feel like playing the game I did it for you. I have 2 followers, a dog, and a horse but one of the followers is there for a quest (the Thieves Guild Quest where you enter the cave) so if you complete that quest he will be gone. All current followers are essential as well as Marcurio with their stats raised. I am an Archmage but most other questlines are early in the missions for the most part, I have still not chosen a side with the Legion or Stormcloaks, check all houses well because items are spread out all over them.\r\n\r\nOld:\r\n\r\nI figured people might want to check out the houses in the game to see what each one offers before you just go and buy one - since the way to get each house is basically the same (and is a time consuming process), might as well chose the one you want. This is an updated version of the headless horseman savegame I have on this site also, so you have no head.\r\n\r\nHouses (wih all upgrades):\r\n\r\nWhiterun - Breezehome\r\n\r\nRiften - Honeyside\r\n\r\nMarkarth - Vlindrel Hall\r\n\r\nWindhelm - Hjerim\r\n\r\nSolitude - Proudspire Manor\r\n\r\nI still haven\\'t joined the Stormcloaks or Imperials yet, and the houses are fairly well stocked (I have at least 10 of all ingredients somewhere in each house - except Riften, I have the 10 of each on me but have been having issues with my ps3 controller working on my pc, so have been trying to get that fixed... I also have a lot of good weapons/armor in the houses).\r\n\r\nFeel free to post your pictures of your houses as I haven\\'t yet, and probably won\\'t play until I get my controller issue fixed...",
