I got tired of redoing these quests at the beginning. >.<; If you\\'re like me and you always screw up your game with mods and updates.. then this might be able to help you out. I left the main storyline past High Hrothgar coz I feel like that\\'s where the Dragonborn can branch off to doing any quests and go anywhere to follow whatever path you want to take.
