  "summary": "Changes the base damage on all the Nord Hero weapons to be slightly less than Daedric and allows tempering of the Nord Hero Bow.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A simple plugin that changes the base damage of all the Nord Hero weapons created at the Skyforge after completing the Comapnions questline. I just used the CK to change it to one less than their daedric counterparts. \r\n\r\nThis also fixes the Nord Hero bow so that it can be improved at the grindstone.\r\n\r\nThe crafting and tempering recipes were NOT changed, and you still have to do the Companions quest to have the recipes appear at the skyforge. After completing the questline, talk to Eorland at the forge and he\\'ll say that it\\'s younger and can craft metals not seen in hundreds of years. Or something.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nExtract file and drop it in your Skyrim/data folder. Make sure the file is checked before launching the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL:\r\n\r\nDelete NordHeroWeapons.esp from your skyrim/data folder.\r\n",
