  "descriptionHtml": "If you enjoy this mod, Endorse it so others can find it easily.\r\n\r\nI had a request for this one, so if there is another, better, mod out there that already does this feel free to ignore this one all together! I didn\\'t bother to look, didn\\'t take very long to do.\r\n\r\nIf you have problems with this mod, its likely because you have prior Nocturnal mods installed. I\\'ve taken zero time to test which ones it works okay with. It appears to work fine with CBBE, adjusting and all. But no promises on that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nTHE MOD:\r\n[list][*]Robes and Hood can be crafted with no requirements other then materials at a forge.\r\n[*]Light armor and hood can be crafted with the Elven smithing perk at a forge.\r\n[*]Heavy armor and hood can be crafted with the Ebony smithing perk at a forge.\r\n[*]All versions fall directly in line with the other armors of their range, making them completely balanced. All versions look exactly the same.\r\n[*]All versions have hoods that are separate articles of apparel.\r\n[*]Some gloves and gauntlets make the sleeves look goofy. Sorry.\r\n[*]Both heavy and light armor versions can be upgraded at the armor upgrade station.\r\n[*]All three versions may be enchanted appropriately.[/list]\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n[list][*]The mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22565]Royal Bloodlines[/url] will cause this mod not to work.[/list]\r\n\r\nRequests, Comments?\r\nPlease comment and I\\'ll try to fix things as quickly as I can, same for adding new stuff. If you use and enjoy this mod, PLEASE endorse it.\r\n\r\nOther Mods by me:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20569]Follower, unique swords and armor[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21578]Follower, unique spell and bow[/url]\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
