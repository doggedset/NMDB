  "descriptionHtml": "ACPMS - Shadow Magic brings a complete modification to the destruction perk tree. No longer are players able to improve their favorite fire, cold or lightning spell. The destruction tree has been completly consumed by the Way of the Shadow. \r\n\r\nFocusing on dark and sinister ability\\'s, the Shadow Magic perk tree is for those that prefer to sneak in darkness, kill from a distance or to rush in with poisoned blade\\'s. The powers gained by investing in the Shadow Magic tree are mostly based on the lesser power ability (with the exeption of the Frost side of the tree). No more long cast time\\'s when one could simply put the dagger in ones back. As a true friend of the dark &amp; a master at moving silently behind ones back, thou gain only the benefits of the shadows if one is not wearing any armor. \r\n\r\nWith this first upload players are able to envelop oneself in poisons, be it instant or lingering poisons. \r\n\r\nRequirements: \r\n- Dawnguard. \r\n- Hearthfire. \r\n-Syynxs Perky Reborn - Major Perk Overhaul \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36542/?tab=1&amp;navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D36542%26preview%3D&amp;pUp=1",
