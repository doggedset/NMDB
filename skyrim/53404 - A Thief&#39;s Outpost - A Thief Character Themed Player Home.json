  "descriptionHtml": "[center]||~~ A Thief&#39;s Outpost ~~||[/center]\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: This is my first ever mod, so please, I need some constructive critizism&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[center]|~~ Description ~~|[/center]\r<br />\r<br />A Thief&#39;s Outpost is a playerhome for thieves&#33; (duh&#33;) It&#39;s placed on the east side of the north gate of Riverwood, no map marker, after all, people aren&#39;t supposed to know where a thief&#39;s outpost is... :P\r<br />\r<br />It contains what every thief needs:\r<br />-          Alchemy Table\r<br />-          Custom Container for Potions\r<br />-          Shelf with ingridients placed on it\r<br />-          Alchemy Satchel\r<br />-          Bed\r<br />-          Bookshelf\r<br />-          Enchanting table\r<br />-          Custom Container for Soul Gems\r<br />-          4 Chests\r<br />-          6 Weapon Racks\r<br />-          2 Display Cases\r<br />-          Some Gold and Gems\r<br />-          An entire set of custom thief armor&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]|~~ Armor ~~|[/center]\r<br />\r<br />The Thief&#39;s Armor that comes with this mod is NOT craftable. The armor rating is based on the Thieves Guild Armor, it uses the Thieves Guild Leader model and has some custom enchantments, which are, in my opinion, more useful than the Thieves Guild Armor ones.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]|~~ Speical Notes ~~|[/center]\r<br />\r<br />All containers in this playerhome should be safe, tell me if one isn&#39;t.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]|~~ Compatibility ~~|[/center]\r<br />\r<br />Should be compatible with any mod, except those that alter the cell the entrance is placed in.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]|~~ Thank you&#33; ~~|[/center]\r<br />\r<br />Thank you for downloading&#33; Feedback is greatly appreciated&#33;",
