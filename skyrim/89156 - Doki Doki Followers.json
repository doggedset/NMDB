  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Doki Doki Followers[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Your favorite characters from Doki Doki Literature Club are now available as standalone followers. They are waiting for you at the bards college in Solitude upstairs in the classroom. They are dressed in vanilla outfits, so feel free to give them whatever look you like. You can even marry your favorite.  They are all essential which means they cannot be killed. (You plans have been foiled Monika. :) )\n<br />\n<br />[u]Credits:[/u]\n<br />I have to thank Lind001 and HelloSanta for letting me use meshes and textures from their mods to make these followers standalone. Without their contributions, this mod could not be made. \n<br />Thank you. :)\n<br />\n<br />Monika\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/thumbnails/89125/89125-1516601967-45176011.jpeg[/img]\n<br />Monika is the president of the literature club. She's the kind of girl that's great at pretty much everything. Her favorite hobbies are playing piano, writing poetry, and practicing her archery. She hopes you'll spend lots of time with her. :) She carries some arrows and her bow that strikes her   target with a burning flame.\n<br />\n<br />Sayori\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/thumbnails/89125/89125-1516602095-982399992.jpeg[/img]\n<br />Sayori is the vice president of the literature club. She can seem to be very outgoing and happy, but she has a side she keeps hidden.  Her hobbies are writing poetry and hanging out with her best friend.  She carries a katana that strikes any foe with paralysis.\n<br />\n<br />Yuri\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/thumbnails/89125/89125-1516602109-2137067608.jpeg[/img]\n<br />Yuri is very shy and doesn't communicate well with people she doesn't know. She has a passion for reading and writing, and her favorite thing to collect is knives.  She carries an opalescent green dagger that is cool to the touch.\n<br />\n<br />Natsuki\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/thumbnails/89125/89125-1516602087-1214171777.jpeg[/img]\n<br />Natuki is the youngest of the group. She is mostly known for her cuteness and love of manga. Her favorite hobbies are baking, reading manga, and writing poetry. She's a tough life, but she doesn't let it get her down.  Since she's a fan of manga, I decided to make her a magical girl. She mostly knows lightning magic with a couple of healing spell thrown in.\n<br />\n<br />To Install:\n<br />Extract into Skyrim's data folder.  I recommend a [u]manual installation[/u] since programs like NMM and MO sometime do not copy all the files over.\n<br />\n<br />*If you want to make all of them your follower, you'll need a multi-follower mod. I recommend [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33002]FollowersLivePackage.[/url] This mod makes the followers seem like they have a mind of their own instead of following you blindly. If you speak english you also need the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56850]translation.[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Mods I Used in making these followers:  (These are included)\n<br />[url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8fvo3L3qhilY1pNQUQ0YkVIOWs/edit]SG Hairs by HelloSanta\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35327/]SG Eyebrows[/url]  by HelloSanta\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75674/]Lind's Human Eyes[/url] by Lind\n<br />\n<br />Mods I didn't use.
