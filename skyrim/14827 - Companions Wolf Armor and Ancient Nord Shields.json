Search no more, for this mod has exactly what it is you seek!\r\n\r\n===========\r\nWhat it does:\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis mod adds two new shields to Skyrim; the Wolf Shield and the Ancient Nord Shield.\r\n\r\nBoth these shields use the Shield of Ysgramor model, but reduced in scale to be closer in size to the Iron & Steel shields, and given custom textures to match with their respective armor sets.\r\n\r\nThe Wolf Shield is sold by Eorland Greymane at the Skyforge in Whiterun once you have been initiated as a full member of the Companions.\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Nord Shield can be obtained in two ways; it has a high chance of being in use by Draugr, and can also be crafted at the Skyforge once you are able to smith Nord Hero weapons & Ancient Nord armor.\r\n\r\nBoth these shields can be improved at the Armor Smithing Bench, and are linked with the Steel Smithing perk.\r\n\r\n==========\r\nOther Mods:\r\n==========\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re wondering about the other custom armor seen in the screenshots, here is a list of what I used:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12092]Cloaks of Skyrim[/url]: they just look awesome.",
