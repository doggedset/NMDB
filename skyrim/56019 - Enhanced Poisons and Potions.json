Well, everyone should no longer.\r<br />Before i change this, i just tank as long as i want in poison darts and enjoying the spray.\r<br />So i doubled the damage and make duration to 3 minutes.\r<br />\r<br />Basically, encourages you to use Cure Poisons or evading poison darts or healing.\r<br />Be wary though, the poison are stacking every dart.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=green][size=5]Way More Strong Poison[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Do you ever think ? Why purchasing Weak Poisons, Frenzy Poison, and Lingering Poison if you can made way more powerful version just by giving perks to Alchemist ?\r<br />Health Poison are much stronger.\r<br />Frenzy Poison affects higher leveled enemies.\r<br />And with Lingering Poison, you can shoot Bandit Marauder. Hide. Wait for minutes. And take the loot.\r<br />The poison effect stacks. You can stack 10 Lingering Poison on Legendary Dragon and watch their health draining.\r<br />This just lighten the way of poison usage. Not severe but lethal.\r<br />Not so powerful against Trolls. Because they&#39;re trying troll you.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=blue][size=5]Night Blade Friendly[/size][/color][/b] \r<br />\r<br />Aversion Poisons now last longer. The effectiveness still same.\r<br />LOL it&#39;s too naive to say balance. Balance is vary to each person. So this is my own balance.\r<br />Giving opportunity to Night Blade character.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=purple][size=5]Harvesting Frostbite Spider Venom[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[i]A brief nerf to harvesting frostbite spider venom.[/i]\r<br />Frostbite Venom was initially deals 5 points of health and stamina for 4 second. Total 20 points.\r<br />That&#39;s weak enough and even when you got Concentrated Poison perk. Which still deal 40.\r<br />For poison damage, compared to your Sword or Bow&#39;s damage is too low. So i change a bit to damage and triples the duration. That&#39;s Poison.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=red][size=5]Last Longer Beneficial Potions[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Got myself encumbered when raiding dwemer ruins, so i use Philter of Strength. Just collect some metal and it&#39;s effect stops.\r<br />So i think it need more duration. And magnitude of course.\r<br />Applied to all potions with beneficial effect.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s the simple table of modified potion and poisons.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s392/StereoxII/EPP2_zpsknju7ldv.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][center]CHANGELOG[/center][/size]1.0 - At least i uploaded my mod.\r<br />\r<br />- Initial Release\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />2.0 - At least i updated my mod.\r<br />\r<br />- Readjusted magnitude and durations.\r<br />- Crafted lingering damage poison enhanced.\r<br />- Fixed pricing.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=white][size=6][center]INSTALLATION[/center][/size][/color] \r<br />- [b][color=#ff0000]REQUIRES DRAGONBORN AND DAWNGUARD DLC.[/color][/b]\r<br />- Extract the file anywhere and move it to you Skyrim data folder.\r<br />- Enable it in SkyrimLauncher or Nexus Mod Manager or Mod Organizer or Wrye Bash.\r<br />- Make sure it loaded on your will. Or if you too confused, just use BOSS.\r<br />- This mod has been cleaned through TESEdit.\r<br />- [color=#ff0000]LOAD IT AT LAST, SO IT WOULDN&#39;T BE OVERRIDDEN BY OTHER MOD.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][size=6][center]CONFLICTED MOD[/center][/size][/color] \r<br />\r<br />This mod will conflict with any mods that changes or modify the Poisons and Potions data string.\r<br />I don&#39;t know many mods which change this.\r<br />This include SkyRe, Requiem, Better Magic and Spells and other.\r<br />If you&#39;re not sure, put this mod load order at last. After Bashed Patch if you use Wyre Bash.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][size=6][center]KNOWN ISSUES[/center][/size][/color] \r<br />\r<br />- Cure Poison does not work as intended. Still figuring out why.\r<br />- [s]Some Poisons and Potions are overpriced. [/s]Â [color=#00ff00]FIXED[/color]",
