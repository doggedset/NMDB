  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a short story as a book either replace &#39;Racial Phylogeny&#39; or be separately added to the game at large using a small script.\r<br />The script means that no patches or compatibility problems should arise, and its technique is heavily based on &#34;Convenient Crossbows&#34; \r<br />The story is called &#34;The Male Organs of Sentient Races and Their Properties&#34; by CaveFelem and is from [url=http://archiveofourown.org/chapters/1482095]http://archiveofourown.org/chapters/1482095[/url].\r<br />\r<br />The Summary is as follows:\r<br />&#34;Written for the Skyrim Kink Meme prompt which requested a rewrite of the in-game book &#34;Notes on Racial Phylogeny and Biology, Seventh Edition&#34;, only about cocks in &#34;long, adoring, lewd detail&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />This is what resulted, in an attempt to imitate the style of the in-game books. Note that since this is a rewrite of the abovementioned book, a couple of passages will likely sound familiar.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />The book is nearly lore-friendly, except that it refers to the dragonborn in the present tense and there are many British spellings (&#34;colour&#34;, etc).\r<br />\r<br />To install it either:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Use Wrye Bash or NMM and the included wizards will guide you.\r<br />[*] Manually copy either the files inside &#34;Separate&#34; or &#34;Replacer&#34; into Skyrim/Data. You could technically copy both, as there are no conflicts, but I would say that it is moronic to have two different copies of the book floating around.\r<br />[/list]",
