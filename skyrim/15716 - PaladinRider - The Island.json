  "descriptionHtml": "Northeast along the coast from Dawnstar you\\'ll find a captain and his vessel.  He offers you a once in an eternity opportunity to leave Skyrim on a 7 day trip.  Will you take him up on his offer?\r\n\r\nREAD :  This is more or less a proof of concept at the moment (April 22nd 2012). It is incomplete and THERE IS CURRENTLY NO WAY TO RETURN TO SKYRIM without the help of console codes.  BACK UP YOUR SAVE.\r\n\r\nThe command to return to skyrim is \\\"coc PRSkyrimShipPort\\\"\r\n\r\nPictures coming soon.  Description coming soon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease leave feedback. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nWalkthrough: \r\n1. Fast travel to Dawnstar.  Travel North east along the coast. When you\\'re near the sanctuary, you should see the captain and his ship off the coast. \r\n2. Talk to the captain, he brings up a proposition. \r\n3. Sleep in the bedroll and you\\'ll find yourself in the beginning of a new adventure. \r\n\r\nIf for whatever reason it doesn\\'t work and you want to see the island, open the console and type \\\"coc PRBeach\\\"\r\n\r\nAbout the author:\r\nI am a 3rd year university student in the computer science and business program.
