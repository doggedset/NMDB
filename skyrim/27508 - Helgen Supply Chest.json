  "summary": "Adds an \\\"Imperial Supply Chest\\\" to Helgen Keep with various items to help mage classes get a start.",
  "descriptionHtml": "So yeah, it sucks playing a non-mage race against type when starting out in Helgen (if you still start from the Helgen sequence anyway). Flames and Healing as your basic spells? Screw that.\r\n\r\nThis mod changes that, and helps aspiring mage classes get a better start from the Helgen sequence. It adds an Imperial Supply Chest to the supply room in Helgen keep that contains:\r\n\r\n-Every Novice Class Spell Tome for all schools of magic (except Flames, Healing, and Sparks due to obvious reason)\r\n-50 Potions of Magicka, Stamina, and Healing (2nd level potions)\r\n-An Imperial Bow (Helgen *is* an Imperial outpost anyway)\r\n-25 Steel Arrows\r\n\r\nThe chest is located in the Helgen Supply Room, the same area where you first pick up potions. It\\'s right next to the barrel that Ralof tells you to loot for potions.\r\n\r\nComments, Suggestions are welcome. Thanks for downloading and trying it out.",
