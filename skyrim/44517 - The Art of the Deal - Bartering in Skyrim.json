  "descriptionHtml": "The art of the deal is a bartering mod that features negotiation.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/44517-1-1381793497.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* Fully voiced\r\n* If you buy something from an NPC, you can negotiate for a discount.\r\n* The amount of discount you get is based on your speech kill and relationship with the NPC.\r\n   After all, in business it\\'s not what you know but who you know.\r\n*  If you don\\'t have enough speech skill or a good relationship with the NPC, you wont walk away\r\nempty-handed. The NPC will give you a small gift as an incentive to barter with them again. \r\n* Those who buy from you often (at least five times) will receive a gift from you (through gift menu) and a relationship boost. You must thank them after they buy from you for the count to take effect.\r\n* After you give the NPC a gift, the count is reset, and they will have to buy from you another five   times to get the gift and relationship boost again. This is done to make it not too easy.\r\n* Tested compatible with trade and barter. (Thank you ianjoseph1986.)\r\n\r\nNew Update!\r\n* Now you can haggle for discounts with merchants using the\r\nusual \\\"What do you have for sale?\\\" dialog.\r\n* Cleaned up the bartering dialog to make it less confusing.\r\n\r\nThis mod requires:\r\nA copy of skyrim and the latest title update\r\n\r\nTo install this mod:\r\nExtract contents of the zip file into skyrim\\'s data folder.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy my mod.",
