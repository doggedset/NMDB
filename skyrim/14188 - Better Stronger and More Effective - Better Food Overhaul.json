  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/so9w3.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=5]This mod aims to provide food with a useful purpose in Skyrim other than decor.[/size]\r\nIf you like this mod, please consider endorsing or leaving comments. Your input is always greatly appreciated. Thanks and enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/YKIfp.png[/img]\r\nThis mod follows a basic chart. Here\\'s the breakdown.\r\nAll foods besides alcohol heal a certain amount of Health and either Magicka or Stamina upfront.\r\nThen, all foods heal a certain amount of Health, Magicka, or Stamina per second for a certain amount of time.\r\nAlcohol heals some Stamina upfront and for a certain amount of time, but later causes slower Stamina regeneration for a while. Higher grade alcohol increases effectiveness and decreases negative side effects.\r\n\r\nAn even further breakdown.\r\nThe following remains true, disregarding certain exceptions.\r\nVeggies specialize in Stamina.\r\nMeat specializes in Health.\r\nPastries & FIsh specialize in Magicka.\r\nTomatoes & Carrots specialize in Magicka.\r\nEidar/Goat Cheese specialize in Magicka/Health.\r\nApples specialize based on their color. Red = Health, Green = Stamina.\r\nAlcohol specializes in Stamina.\r\nBread specializes in Health and Stamina\r\n\r\n*As someone has mentioned this issue in the comments section, I do realize that the foods\\' properties in my mod are able to be stacked, which makes it possible to become nearly invincible if enough food is consumed. I most likely will not make an update which will disallow the stacking of the healing effects. I believe that gameplay in Skyrim is should be controlled by the player. If he/she wishes to consume 30 potatoes in one go, it\\'s his/her choice. However, if you wish to only have one effect enabled at a time, simply consume one at a time. It\\'s on an honor system... whether you choose to follow it or not is your decision.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]EDIT: I have created a new mod version that will stop the abuses above, but will keep the previous versions up for those who appreciated the freedom. Thanks for all your support![/b][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/fgjj2.png[/img]\r\nAs pictured with the apples, there is 50% disease resistance for an hour.\r\nAfter all, the saying goes: \\\"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.\\\"\r\n\r\nIf this mod is received well, the upcoming updates will provide realistic side effects or bonuses.\r\nFor example, consuming Raw Meat may cause negative impacts on health or a chance of contracting diseases\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]If you have a suggestion for another effect for a certain food, please feel free to comment them. I will create an additional section for credits with your name.[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Y930M.png[/img]\r\n[size=4][b]v2.0[/b][/size] Remade mod. To combat the abuse the previous versions allowed for, food that heals stamina now increases stamina regeneration at a comparable rate, but stops power attack spams that 3 stamina a second previously allowed. Also, healing effects from food no longer stack, so 50 apples no longer grant near invincibility.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]v1.2[/b][/size] Added support for Hearthfire Foods. Many foods now have special effects such as Resist Magic or Fortify Carry Weight due to the alchemical powers in the ingredients used to create them. \r\n\r\n[size=4]v1.1[/size] Per [b]ermanyolcu\\'s[/b] and [b]solraven\\'s[/b] requests, most food besides alcoholic beverages heal for a more realistic time period, (about 2x longer). Elsweyr Fondue\\'s effects have been increased to provide better balancing towards the original Fondue. The Tomato Soup glitch has been fixed. Bread now also heals Stamina due its higher levels of carbs. There are also  other minor miscellaneous changes.\r\n\r\n[size=4]v1.0[/size] Initial Release.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/LVSTj.png[/img]\r\nNMM (Nexus Mod Manager) Installation is highly recommended.\r\nTo manually install, extract the compressed files into your Skyrim installation directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/kjich.png[/img]\r\nDelete \\\"KDC - Better Food.esp\\\" from your Data folder.\r\n\r\n[size=5]Special Thanks[/size]\r\n[size=3]The people listed here have provided insightful input on the effects of this mod.[/size]\r\n[b]solraven[/b]\r\n[b]ermanyolcu[/b]",
