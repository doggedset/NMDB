Who wields A glass sword and glass dagger. Found in Riverwood outside near Sven’s House.\r<br />\r<br />Khurgis-Khat – A Khajiit tank with a Combat style similar to Vilkas of the companions. That being said he comes equipped with an elven bow, elven greatsword and elven arrows. His strong suit is with a two handed weapon. Khurgis makes a great bodyguard and can be found in Kynereth’s Temple in Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />Valim Dragh – A Dunmer Hunter with a surly streak. Uses Attack Data from Aela the Huntress. Comes Equipped with a Daedric Bow, a quiver-full of Daedric Arrows and a Dragon Priest Dagger. Valim Can be found standing awkwardly in the middle of the room in Candlehearth Hall in Windhelm.\r<br />\r<br />Horst Eriksson - A true Son of Skyrim, Average Sword and Sheild Combat Style. Comes Equipped with the Sheild Of Ysgramor and A Skyforge Steel Sword. Horst may be found at the inn in Riverwood.\r<br />\r<br />Quintus Lentolus Batiatus  - (Yes, I ripped the name from Spartacus) A chivalrous Imperial a long way from home, Quintus is a gladiator style sword and shield fighter. Equipped with what else? Imperial Stuff, left over from his legionnaire days.\r<br />\r<br />Hadrian – A Redguard Mage, he is highly OP for the player to recruit until at least level 15. Otherwise he just kills everyone before you get a shot. He shares the same spell set and Attack Data as Ancano (the Aldmeri jerk from the CoW). All that means is that he is a raging elemental death machine. He can be found at the inn in Winterhold.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> My Opus:\r<br />             The reason that these guys exist is because I was running around with 3 Mod followers (all three of which I shall have in my recommended files section.) and for some reason I wasn’t able to keep them all at the same time even with the Follower Tweaks perk I have now (also in recommended files) and one went Carmen San-Diego got completely lost in the world. I wanted to express my individuality as a player and create a team of followers to suit my tastes. Now I have a Kick Ass HQ in the center of the country full of BAMF’s and I couldn’t be happier&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Plans for The Future:\r<br />             I would love to eventually learn how to script each character a unique quest, but as I understand this is a very labor intensive process. I do plan to do Custom Voice Acting for Each follower as they are all using vanilla dialogue and voices. If you would like to help with any of this feel free to contact me via Nexus or Twitter @o0TheZachPeek0o.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Recommended Files: \r<br />Immersive Armors by Hothtrooper44 - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19733/?\r<br />\r<br />Immersive Weapons by Hothtrooper44, Ironman5000, and Eckss - \r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27644/?\r<br />\r<br />SkyUI by SkyUI Team - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/?\r<br />\r<br />A Better Body Scale For Khajiit and Argonian Male by TS -http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6239/?\r<br />\r<br />A Quality World Map with Roads by IcePenguin - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4929/?\r<br />\r<br />Cloaks of Skyrim by Noodles - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12092/?\r<br />\r<br />Helgen Reborn by Mike Hancho aka Balok -  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35841/?\r<br />\r<br />Amazing Follower Tweaks by Dheuster - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?\r<br />\r<br />Immersive First Person View by Meh321 - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49036/?\r<br />\r<br />Populated Cities, Towns, Villages by RS - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/46469/?\r<br />\r<br />Populated Lands, Roads, Paths by RS -  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48127/?\r<br />\r<br />Winter is Coming Cloaks by Nivea - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13486/?\r<br />\r<br />Immersive Patrols by Scrabbulor -http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12977/?\r<br />\r<br />Atvir Dres- The Last Prince of Tear by JanusForebeare -http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19348/?\r<br />\r<br />Inigo by SmartBlueCat - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40960/?\r<br />\r<br />Hoth by Hothtrooper44 - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24666/?\r<br />\r<br />Towns and Villages Enhanced series- Steam Workshop\r<br />\r<br />Wearable Lanterns- Steam Workshop",
