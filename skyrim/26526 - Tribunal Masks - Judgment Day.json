  "descriptionHtml": "Tribunal Masks - Judgment Day\r\nby Zairaam, Treasure Chest & Rudyard\r\n\r\nThanks to Brodual for this awesome Mod Spotlight:\r\n[youtube]jh5yb3abHQQ[/youtube]\r\n\r\nMod Required:\r\nTribunal Masks http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20077\r\nfor the models and textures of the masks!\r\n\r\nThe original TribunalMasks.esp plugin is not required but it is compatible \r\nto use aside if you need non-enchanted versions of the first 4 masks. \r\nYou may only have the Judgment Day .esp active and it will work,\r\nbut you may also use both at the same time.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nThis mod distributes the amazing Tribunal Masks made by Zairaam (plus 2 additional masks) \r\non 6 boss NPCs placed in certain matching vacant interiors of Skyrim.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve done this to give the players the satisfaction of earning the masks, \r\nrather than the quick and easy option of crafting them at any forge. \r\nSort of an easter-egg hunt with epic boss fights :D\r\nAlong the line of adapting the first 4, the other two masks came to be.\r\n\r\nIn my perspective, the NPCs are warrior champions ready to challenge you for glory or death. \r\nEach boss has a specific mask with specific enchantments which can be looted.\r\n\r\nThe new enchantments are not overpowered, \r\nthey are similar but not identical to the dragon priest masks:\r\n\r\n1. Tribunal Mask Bronze \r\n- used by Bronxilus \\\"Bronx\\\" Zooltharion (redguard) \r\n=> active effect: Bronze Zoo = Health & Health Regen Rate Buffs\r\n\r\n2. Tribunal Mask Ebony \r\n- used by Larson \\\"Big L\\\" Lynx (khajiit) \r\n=> active effect: Ebonics = Sneak & Shout Recovery Rate Buff \r\n\r\n3. Tribunal Mask Gold \r\n- used by Aurelius \\\"Aureus\\\" Gold-Ember (high elf) \r\n=> active effect: Gold Rush = Speech Buff & Fire Resist\r\n\r\n4. Tribunal Mask Silver \r\n- used by Tepes the Impaler (nord vampire) \r\n=> active effect: Silver Lining = Poison & Frost Resist \r\n\r\n5. Tribunal Mask Argon \r\n- used by Marshwalker Mad-Gills (argonian vampire) \r\n=> active effect: Gills of the Marshwalker = Stamina Buffs & Waterbreathing \r\n[The 5th mask uses the Argonian mask model for all races (like an argonian disguise), and it\\'s meant \r\nto allow you to breathe underwater. It has a green-grey retexture to match vanilla Orcish armor.]\r\n\r\n6. Tribunal Mask Gator \r\n- used by Daedroth Dundi (orc) \r\n=> active effect: Jaws of the Glades = One&Two-Handed Dmg Buffs & Waterbreathing\r\n[The 6th mask uses a heavily modified argonian mask model (kind of looks like an alligator), \r\nand it allows underwater breathing as well, but also packs a punch along with it. \r\nIts retexture matches vanilla DragonScale armor.]\r\n\r\nAlso, every mask has an additional 20% magika damage resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe NPCs have no custom dialogue, they will be aggressive and attack on sight.\r\nThey have vanilla voices. Take them down to loot their masks and thematic gear. \r\nThey have a high health bar and pre-enchanted armor so be careful because they \r\ncan be quite a challenge. It\\'s best if you\\'re high level before you load this mod.\r\nThey do not respawn.\r\n\r\nThe masks are still forgeable (if you want to give some to your companions and still have \r\na copy for yourself) but now you can only create them at the Skyforge in Whiterun. \r\n\r\nI\\'ve customized the crafting recipes for each mask, because the original plugin only required 3 \r\nebony ingots for all of them, and they were all in the ebony section, which didn\\'t make sense since \r\nthey were of different materials. My new configuration is like this:\r\n1. Bronze - 3 Corundum ingots - Dwarven category\r\n2. Ebony - 3 Ebony ingots - Ebony category\r\n3. Gold - 3 Gold ingots - Elven category\r\n4. Silver - 3 Silver ingots - Imperial category\r\n5. Argon - 3 Orcish ingots - Orcish category\r\n6. Gator - 3 Dragon scales - Dragon category\r\n\r\nThe original masks could be upgraded but had no armor rating so it was pointless.\r\nI\\'ve given all a light armor rating of 5 base points, except for the Gator which has 10 points.\r\nThey now can be tempered with their respective material ingots (or scales).\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nWhere to find the 6 warrior champions:\r\n- in Frostflow Lighthouse\r\n- in Fort Kastav Officer\\'s Quarters \r\n- in Northwatch Keep\r\n- in Sightless Pit/Abandoned Cave exit \r\n- in Greenwall Cave\r\n- in Lost Prospect Mine\r\n\r\nAny mod modifying those places may conflict \r\n(i.e. if somebody else added NPCs there, they might start fighting). \r\nUnlikely to cause crashes. Mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nZairaam for the original masks and permission\r\nTreasureChest for modifying the Argon and Gator masks \r\n(especially the Gator mask which took quite enough effort)\r\nI brought the idea, the names (NPCs, enchantments, etc.), \r\nCK work and Argon & Gator masks retextures/recolors.\r\n\r\nSpecial appreciation for Bethesda \r\nfor the most modable and cool games :D \r\nand for the C.K. and mod support.\r\nand thanks to Nexus for mod hosting.\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\nIf you want to host or convert this mod, \r\nyou must ask Zairaam or DoctorPepper for permission like I have.\r\nFor translations of the mod only upload .esp, \r\nand not the models and textures from this or from the original package.\r\n\r\nThat\\'s pretty much it!\r\nI hope people will enjoy earning the masks of this mod.",
