  "descriptionHtml": "NEW VERSION: 1.5.2 READ BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS\r<br />\r<br />REQUIRES DAWNGUARD.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. A long Dragonbone bridge stretching from the Riverwood Path to Whiterun. \r<br />You &#39;ll find the South entrance close to the waterfall at the edge of Riverwood. Leaving the village, turn left and cross a part of the hill.\r<br />The North entrance is located near Whiterun&#39;s Gates, on right.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m still looking for a translator about the book in breezehome&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />For the moment, the entire mod is in French (Armor/Guards Names etc...).\r<br />I&#39;will release an English version soon (I hope).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Current version: 1.5.2 \r<br />Added: \r<br />- New Navmeshes \r<br />- Meshes & Texture LOD, The bridge is now Full LOD and can be visible from a long distance. \r<br />- A New model inside Whiterun (Actually, it&#39;s exactly the same than the bridge of the worldspace, so it is more realistic) \r<br />- Normal Maps for the armor texture \r<br />- A Model visible from the Skyrim Worldspace \r<br />\r<br />Fixed: \r<br />- A little bug: Two pieces of the bridge were flying over The Giant&#39;s Camp (Thanks to Sushi258) \r<br />\r<br />Soon in 1.6: \r<br />-More guards. \r<br />-A new entrance. \r<br />-A Bug Fix for the Quest \r<br />\r<br />CHANGELOG: \r<br />\r<br />V.1.4 \r<br />Added: \r<br />-A New NPC: Warlock de Ghluck (Warlock of Ghluck), writer of the Storv√§gorm book, in his own house (at the south entrance of the bridge). \r<br />-A Map Marker for the bridge \r<br />-A New Quest: BUG: The quest doesn&#39;t start, it will be fixed soon. \r<br />\r<br />V. 1.3 \r<br />Added: \r<br />-A new Guard Faction \r<br />-A new armor (craftable) \r<br />-Some Navmeshes, allowing NPC&#39;s to walk on the bridge. \r<br />-A New model inside Whiterun.
