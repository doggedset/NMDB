  "summary": "Poison that increases arrow damage the further the arrow flies.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new poison purchasable from the khajiit caravans which,  when applied to your bow, adds additional damage to your attack if the arrow flies over 25 meters (1 point of damage for every meter over 25).\r\n\r\nusing this poison is high risk, high reward as the closer you are to the enemy, you\\'re more likely to hit the target whilst doing less bonus damage. On the other hand, taking shots at greater distances, while difficult to pull of,  can potentially yield massive damage bonuses.\r\n\r\nNote: this does not act like poison in the traditional sense, damaging enemies slowly over time but instead adds the bonus damage at the time of impact,  allowing stronger enemies to be taken down quickly (from a distance of course).\r\n\r\nThis mod was made relatively quickly so there may quite possibly be spelling mistakes, bugs e.t.c.",
