THIS WILL CHANGE DRIFT WOOD!!! It will also make 'The Blessings of Nature' quest feel less immersive or more immersive depending on your idea of what makes something \"Immersive\".\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Why?[/b][/size]\n<br />I've been fiddling around with textures recently making the weirdest things for fun. I was looking for a new muse and there it was the dead tundra tree. Thought of the Gildergreen's textures and here we are.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Options and Folder Directories[/b][/size]\n<br />Before quest: \n<br />Dead bark- gives the dead tundra tree the dead Gildergreen's bark before the quest 'The Blessings of Nature' is completed.\n<br />Only Blank texture- no branches or roots\n<br />Only Branches- contains vanilla texture of branches with no roots\n<br />Only roots- contains vanilla texture of roots with no branches\n<br />\n<br />After quest: \n<br />Alive bark- gives the dead tundra tree the alive Gildergreen's bark after the quest 'The Blessings of Nature' is completed.\n<br />NoRoots- you will have Gildergreen branches. You won't have any roots growing out of the bottom of fallen over trees. \n<br />Normal roots- vanilla root texture with Gildergreen branches\n<br />Gildergreen branch Roots- you will have Gildergreen branches growing out of the bottom of fallen over trees.\n<br />[b][size=5]\n<br />READ THE 'Readme.txt' FOR INSTALLATION OPTIONS[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Installation:[/size][/b]\n<br />Pick and choose from the folders given.\n<br />Go to your Skyrim folder. Should be located under your C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim\n<br />Or in steam right click on The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, click properties, click local files tab, then click Browse Local Files.\n<br />Take the data(s) folders chosen and drop them in.\n<br />Merge when prompted.\n<br />Replace if asked.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][size=3][size=5][b]Future Plans[/b][/size]\n<br />Give these retextures a lore friendly explanation. Make more options and recolor everything.\n<br />I might add some of my other retextures to this mod as options.\n<br />Make 4k textures of the branches and possibly the roots.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Suggestions[/b][/size]\n<br />Before you start the quest 'The Blessings of Nature' use the Dead bark option. \n<br />After you start the quest 'The Blessings of Nature' use the Alive bark option.\n<br /> I also HIGHLY suggest using the 'Gildergreen branch Roots' option as it\n<br /> will look and feel like the Gildergreen has suddenly been brought back \n<br />too life.[/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Uninstall:[/size][/b]\n<br />tundradriftwoodbark01.dds\n<br />tundradriftwoodbark01_n.dds\n<br />tundradriftwoodbranches01.dds\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Permissions[/b][/size]\n<br />The textures are Bethesda's and so I claim no right to them. I do however claim the right to the thought and idea put into this mod. \n<br />Share your screenie's with me!!!!\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Credit/Programs Used[/b][/size]\n<br />Bethesda- for the texture's\n<br />GIMP\n<br />Brain.exe\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size]",
