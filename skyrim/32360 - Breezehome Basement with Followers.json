  "summary": "A practical and cozy basement for Breezehome. Simple and qwaint, includes four unique marryable followers.",
  "descriptionHtml": "**READ**\r\n\r\nThe basement is located under the stairs in Breezehome. There are a total of SIX followers. Three warriors, a \\'daedra\\', a housekeeper, and a merchant\r\n\r\nFully navmeshed so NPCs can get in and out and walk around normally. \r\nPLEASE inform me on anything you\\'d like me to improve and/or change. Also add any bugs I might have missed.\r\n\r\nBesides from the fun of simply making something of my own, I mainly do this for you guys. So if you want me to get better (I have some awesome ideas) then push me and bring me support. Updates will get done faster, and my mods will get better!\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso found on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129250373\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your awesomeness, don\\'t forget to comment. Endorsing would also be a good idea (;\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 3/2/2013\r\n-The Under Garden is MUCH livlier now!\r\n-You\\'ll find three spell tomes if you search a little.\r\n-The two goodlooking gentlemen will be a merchant and a follower once I can figure out why my script is acting funny.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 3/4/2013\r\n-Ranyu the Bound Daedric Shapeshifter will now follow you. As will Ma\\'Khar the Wry.\r\n-On top of that, Ma\\'Khar is a merchant anytime anywhere. I threw in the option to marry the khajiit, but not the \\'daedra\\'.\r\n-Fully navmeshed the basement to the outside world so an NPC will follow you throughout all of the basement and under garden, as well as \\\"The Editor\\\" place (QASmoke).\r\n-Linked the under garden to QASmoke. QASmoke is also linked to Proudspire Manor and Vindrel Hall (Solitude and Markarth houses) WILL be adding the rest of the houses soon.\r\n-Watch out for minor future updates. I\\'ll let you know when another big one comes!

If you DO have Hearthfire, I made a patch for this mod under the \\\"Optional Downloads\\\".\r\nDownload the Patch, and this mod will be 100% compatible with Hearthfire!",
