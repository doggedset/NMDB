You can also get them from the great compilation [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19733/?]Immersive Armors.[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]1 - Quick description and installation.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This is a mesh path fix for those who&#39;ve been wanting to play the extension made by CrimsonFairy of the Tribunal Robes in another directory that wasn&#39;t the default from steam in Program Files. Crimson originally made them for personal use, so it&#39;s fairly understood.\r<br />Basically I changed [u]every single texture path[/u] from [u]every single nitrishape in every piece of armor and colour[/u] in Nifskope. Because I drank too much coffee and wanted to play these.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;I don&#39;t know. Could be messy.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[b]2 - Thanks:\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Crimsonfairy.\r<br />Natterforme.",
