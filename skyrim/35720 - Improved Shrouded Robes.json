  "descriptionHtml": "Adds 75% magicka regen because I didn\\'t think that JUST 15% fortify destruction was fair for one of the better looking robes in game (since its also a faction armor). =<\r\n\r\nThis brings it up to Apprentice robe enchantment wise, buffing the Shrouded Robes to a usable level but not making it overpowered.\r\n\r\nHonestly the only thing that would conflict with it as far as I know is any other shrouded robe enchant modifying mod.\r\n\r\nIf the enchant isn\\'t showing up for a character that had the robes on before loading this mod, then drop them then re-equip.\r\n\r\nALSO: the reason it says +damage instead of reduced cost in the screencap is due to the magic balancing mod I\\'m using, otherwise it should still be -15% cost.",
