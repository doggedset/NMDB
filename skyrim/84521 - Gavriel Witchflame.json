  "descriptionHtml": "Have me as a follower, no idea why you&#39;d want that. I&#39;m not a marriage partner (taken), and I&#39;m OP as hell (not an ego thing, an effort thing, don&#39;t feel like setting him to scale with the player). NPC has untested necromancy, destruction and one-handed skills as well as armor that&#39;s bound to break your immersion if you care at all about the quest it&#39;s involved in. His axe is unique (if it didn&#39;t break in the CK), so steal it if you want.\r<br />\r<br />In the new update, he doesn&#39;t use Midas spells so you&#39;re good if you don&#39;t want buggy OP magic mods.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This was mainly uploaded for my friend, if you&#39;re wondering why this exists. Cheers.",
