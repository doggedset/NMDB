  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple mod I wrote of a couple of friends that expands many of the perk sets to include higher levels of existing perks for use with the uncapper. Each tree is a separate .esp file, so you can enable the ones you want and leave the ones you don\\'t want out.\r\n\r\nNoteable changes:\r\n-Spell damage/healing gets boosted by relevant perks based off skill points, instead of getting flat percentage gains from perks.\r\n-Most combat oriented basic skills have had their ranks increased from 5 to 10 total ranks.\r\n-Removed most prerequisite perks to allow you to skip over perks you don\\'t want.\r\n-Blacksmithing perks were not changed, as Headbomb has already done a great set of mods for crafting\r\n\r\nRequires Skyrim -Community- Uncapper:  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1175\r\nIf you install this with NMM, the custom settings I\\'ve made for uncapper will over-write automatically.\r\n\r\n----\r\nV 1.1\r\nFixed error in Sneak perks that caused a game freeze\r\nAdded Uncapper file to archive for ease of install",
