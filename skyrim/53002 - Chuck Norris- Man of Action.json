But after 5 days of agonizing pain... the cobra died.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[b][center]CHUCK NORRIS[/center][/b]\r<br />He is here, as accurate as is possible in the vanilla game. \r<br />In your interest, he has decided not to use his true power and weakened himself to serve as your follower.\r<br />Technically you are following him. He ran around the world and has decided not to lap you. \r<br />Chuck is an imperial ranger.\r<br />Nothing can kill him, definitely not you.\r<br />Traps are too afraid to go off when he touches them. \r<br />You are not good enough to marry him.\r<br />\r<br />No requirements except a legal, up to date copy of Skyrim\r<br />Based on a guide by LabCloning on [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-mFpJRM3xM ]YouTube [/url]\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to everyone for making this the #1 Chuck Norris mod on the Nexus&#33;",
