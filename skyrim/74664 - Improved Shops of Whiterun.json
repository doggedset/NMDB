  "descriptionHtml": "This mod aims to make the shops of Skyrim more unique by changing small things in every shop. The drunken huntsman has more animal items like pelts and wall mounted animals. The war maiden has a larger counter and more items. Arcadia&#39;s Cauldron has more shelves with magical items, along with a better counter. And now belethor is even more of aÂ hoarder. This is my first mod so it isnt to grand or fancy, but I think the changes aren&#39;t too over the top. If you make a youtube video showcasing this mod please contact me so I can feature it right here on the mod page.",
