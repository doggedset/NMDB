  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Verdana][u][size=5][i][b]FEATURES:[/b][/i][/size][/u][/font]\r<br />A small village located NE of Riften. You will need to earn your way into the village so prepare for a fight. (*hint bring a torch) There is a good working economy where the local villagers have made quite a nice living. There are a variety of traders to exchange goods with like the local fisherman and farmers. There is a player home overlooking the entire village which comes with auto-sort storage and a personal housecarl who can be married and turned into a follower. The village has a working guard system, so break the law and you will be thrown in jail. In the large inn in the western side of the village live a happily married Jarls.  Most villagers have a schedule they follow which adds life to the village. There are a variety of unique weapons you&#39;ll just have to find on your own. Included is a small bandit fort with a hidden passageway guarded by guards to ensure the bandits do not enter the village. If you choose to challenge the fort ensure you bring plenty of potions&#33; I&#39;ve added a lot of attntion to detail I hope you may enjoy. Best of all, I have added 4 tunnels that lead to 4 different holds: Solitude, Riften, Markath, and Whiterun.  It&#39;s perfect for players who do not like to fast travel and break immersion, like myself.\r<br />[font=Verdana][size=5][u][i][b]\r<br />LOCATION:[/b][/i][/u][size=2]\r<br />Refer to images. There will be a marker in your map that you may follow or fast travel to.[/size]\r<br />[u][i][b]\r<br />FUTURE UPDATES:[/b][/i][/u][/size][/font]\r<br />- I plan on adding some quest and perhaps more intriguing schedules to the local NPC&#39;s.\r<br />- Anything else I might think of or suggested by others.\r<br />- Perhaps a good story and history background to the village.\r<br />- If you have any suggestions or ideas please message me or make a post. I don&#39;t have a lot of CK skills but if I can do it I will.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Verdana][size=5][u][i][b]R[/b][/i][/u][u][i][b]EQUIREMENTS:[/b][/i][/u][/size][/font]\r<br />I utilized a variety of modders resources(credited below). I am not to familiar with mods but I *think you will need the folowing mods to ensure the right models show up in your end.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Verdana][size=5][u][i][b]TRADERS AVAILABLE:[/b][/i][/u][/size][/font]\r<br />-Fisherman\r<br />-Hunter who sells meat\r<br />-Alchemist\r<br />-Wizard\r<br />-Tavern workers\r<br />-Woodcutter\r<br />-Blacksmith\r<br />-Skooma dealer\r<br />\r<br />[font=Verdana][size=5][u][i][b]BUGS:[/b][/i][/u][/size][/font]\r<br />- In the exterior cell for the bandit camp one particular mountain &#34;may&#39;&#34; not load correctly. Just save and restart. It&#39;s a problem with CK I can&#39;t get around.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Verdana][size=5][u][i][b]CREDITS:[/b][/i][/u][/size][/font]\r<br />I&#39;d like to give recognition to the following mods/people for creating such awesome resources and mods:\r<br />---FoodContainer Resource by Blary- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14133/? **for their great mod resources\r<br />---Modders Resource Pack by [b]Oaristys and Tony67[/b]- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/? **for their great mod resources\r<br />---General Stores - storage resource for packrats by Harvey2112 http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18340/? **for the great selection of auto-sort    mod\r<br />---ApachiiSkyHair by [b]Apachii[/b]- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/? **for the amazing models created and used by some of the NPC&#39;s",
