  "summary": "Made 2 Races based on Wood Elf. Tree Elf Race and Lightning Elf Race.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I made this for me but decided to upload it. It is based on the Wood elf. Tree Elf Race and Lightning Elf Race. Have the same skills and such but I added the Storm and Frost Atronachs Frost and lightning effects to the Lightning Elf Race. I had made just the Tree Elf Race at first but found it had frost and lighning effect distracting and just made a duplicate, renamed it Light Elf Race, and removed the effects from the tree elf. I raised the starting skills and added another in the creation kit. There is an extra skill slot.\r\n\r\nSkills are as follows.\r\n\r\nArchery 10\r\nHeavy Armor 15\r\nDestruction 15\r\nAlteration 15\r\nOne Handed 10\r\nEnchanting 10\r\nRestoration 15\r\n\r\nSpecials:\r\nkept the power command animal\r\nresist poison 50\r\nDraugr Glow Eyes\r\nResist Damage 15\r\nFortified Combat Healing 0.50\r\nResist Frost 25\r\nWeakness to Fire 10\r\n\r\nlight Elf got Frost effect and lightning effect\r\n\r\nKhajiit Claws\r\n\r\nMade a race based spell.\r\nWoodsmans Cloak\r\nIt combines Frost Cloak and Oakflesh. Didn;t want to alter the original spells so just made duplicates and renamed them. Cold Cloak and WArmor Oak. Starting magnitude of WOak flesh 20 instead of 40 and upped the first mage armor perk bonus to 60. I done this so i could use it at the beginning of the game.\r\nhas no requirments\r\n\r\nversion 2.1\r\n\r\nAdded companion with her own custom race based on Orc to Whiterun Stables.\r\nAdded dog with custom race based on dog race. War Hound larger than the normal dog. \r\nAdded horse. Was supposed to be a pony. Uploaded an option file with an actual pony. Both based on the horse but smaller. Trying figure out how to get them to follow you into buildings, cities and dungeons. I want one that will always fight alongside you all the time.\r\nRequires Dawnguard and Dragonborn\r\n\r\nPlease leave some ideas on how to fix these things. I don\\'t know much about the creation kit but I have been messing with mods for a long time. Since Quake 2 and wanted to share one of those for once.",
