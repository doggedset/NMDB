  "descriptionHtml": "I was always unhappy with the Dragon Priest Enchantments. They were supposed to be some of the most powerful items in the game, but with an enchanting skill of 100, a few potions, and a few perks, the player can easily make better items. So I decided to create a mod that would make Konahrik (my favorite mask) better without being overpowered.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n\r\n+50 Magicka\r\n+50 Health\r\n+50 Stamina\r\n+Slightly increased base armor rating\r\nImproved item description\r\n\r\nThis is only a minor change and I tested it, so there shouldn't be any problems. However, this is my first mod, so if you find any bugs let me know.",
