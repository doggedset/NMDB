  "modId": 38114.0,
  "modName": "Modders Tools - Locator",
  "summary": "A simple little plugin that gives you a spell to check current position and editor coordinates. Incredibly useful for finding locations in the CK.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r\nAdds a spell, Locate, that can be cast for free to display your current position, as well as editor coordinates if in an exterior. Works for all vanilla, DLC and mod added Cells and Worldspaces. The spell tome should be added to your inventory automatically.\r\n\r\nAlso be sure to check out [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27855]Where in Oblivion am I[/url], which this mod was inspired by. The differences between Locator and WIOAI is that this mod uses a spell instead of a book, and thus can be hotkeyed and cast at any time, and it displays a notification instead of a messagebox, allowing you to check on your location seamlessly. It also displays fine-detail position coordinates, and works in interiors to boot!\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nYou know the drill. Unpack into skyrim/data.\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\nNone. You may have to wait a bit to get the tome after starting a new game with an alternate start mod, but other than that it should be totally fine.\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n1.0 - Inital Release",
