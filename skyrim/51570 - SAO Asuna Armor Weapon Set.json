I have made this armor about an year and a bit, but never got the motivation to pack it up since it might not be very compatible with some of the mods you guys are already using, plus I won&#39;t be using an NMM installer, so please browser the files for your own need, this mod was made under xp32&#39;s blessed UNP body, so..yeah, I should have made it under UNP but I didn&#39;t thought that much and found out it didn&#39;t fit very well beside of blessed UNP.\r<br />\r<br />ANYWAY&#33; the MOD&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Mods that are required if you want the custom voice and shorter height shown like in the video:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11811/]FNIS[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24168/]RaceCompatibility[/url]\r<br />(hair and face aren&#39;t included in the package)\r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28780/]UNP Jewelry Variants[/url] (for smaller accessories)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7887/]Pretty face[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12951/]Enhanced Character Edit[/url]\r<br />and other hair packs..\r<br />\r<br />The mod contains a custom race called Monli which I used when I was developing the mod but I&#39;ve changed some of the skeleton preferences replaced with x32 skeleton and some other skin meshes.\r<br />there are some other changes even I have forgotten, sorry about this.\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO GET THIS ARMOR AND WEAPON:\r<br />type &#34;help asuna&#34; under console and you will see set of codes\r<br />then type &#34;player.additem XXXXXXX 1&#34; (XXXXXXX are the code you see on every item)\r<br />\r<br />KNOWN BUG:\r<br /># lighting bug in 1st person every time you reloads the game, so solve this stay in 1st person and disarm the armor and wear it again until you see the lighting bug goes away.\r<br /># robe sticking out while crouching (bad weight skin painting)\r<br /># glove appears strangely when using magic or the elder scroll (bad weight skin painting)\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to \r<br />blessed UNP body by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/183089]xp32[/url]\r<br />x32 skeleton by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/183089]xp32[/url]\r<br />Pretty Female Idles by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3474785/]dualsun[/url]\r<br />Pretty_Combat_Idles by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3474785/]dualsun[/url]\r<br />some mixed animation pack to suite the character (forgot which one I have used, please message me if its yours&#33;&#33; would be grateful)\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE include this mod page if you are uploading to somewhere else please&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />ALOT of time were used to create this piece of armor and weapon&#33; since its my first go in modding&#33;\r<br />\r<br />videos:\r<br />combat:\r<br />[youtube]3L2oUkupwVE[/youtube]\r<br />poses:\r<br />[youtube]gNdOl713Snc[/youtube]",
