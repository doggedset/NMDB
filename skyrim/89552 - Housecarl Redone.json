  "modName": "Housecarl Redone",
  "summary": "This mod greatly enhances the 5 core housecarls of the game (Lydia, Iona, Calder, Argis, and Jordis) with different gear, weapons, perks, and custom spells/enchantments. Lydia summons a large black wolf, Jordis is more of a two hand paladin, Argis has large amounts of health and a spiked shield, Iona has a poison bow and can vanish, and Calder MAGE",
  "descriptionHtml": "There are plenty of follower mods out there, but for the lore friendly, this mod aims to enhance the already established housecarls that came vanilla with the game.\n<br />\n<br />To spare you the details here is the rundown of the major changes\n<br />Lydia can summon a level scaling large black wolf to reflect a connection to the companions.\n<br />Jordis is a two handed warrior with healing capabilities.\n<br />Iona has a customized bow with a lethal poison enchantment.\n<br />Argis has a large boost to health and devestating perks.\n<br />Calder has a customized concentrated ether spell for enemies who get too close and a powerful custom staff.\n<br />\n<br />For those of you who enjoy my Silnia Mod, download the Silnia Supported version. Since the 2018 Version of the Silnia mod replaces Jordis now, this mod replaces the hireling within the Winking Skeever at Solitude with Jordis.\n<br />\n<br />Why did I create this mod? Having powerful followers is fun, but I enjoy the prospect of unlocking and earning each member of the team (I use Ultimate Follower Overhaul mod) and too many downloaded/created overpowered characters may be entertaining, but over time I wish to return a proper challenge to the game, but spice up the characters to cope with the Hardcore mods I use to make the game more realistic and lethal.\n<br />\n<br />Enjoy the mod!",
