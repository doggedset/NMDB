  "descriptionHtml": "It's always been my dream to make Astrid look less like dog crap. So, here.\n<br />\n<br />Oh, yeah, and soon I might release some of my presets. Some.*\n<br />\n<br />*hint: not Brynhildr.\n<br />\n<br />Sorry if she still looks like dog crap in your game, I'm not much of a modding expert but if there's anything that even an idiot like me can fix, I'll try. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#c27ba0]NECKSEAM GUIDE!:[/color]\n<br />[/u]\n<br />If Astrid has a neck seam, (i.e. when the head colour is different from the body colour when looking at the bottom of the neck) then this is what most NPC replacers will ask you to do. She shouldn't even have a neck seam, she didn't when I tested my mod.\n<br />\n<br />1) Open console command\n<br />\n<br />2) click on Astrid \n<br />\n<br />3) type [color=#c27ba0]'setnpcweight 80[/color]' &lt;- this is HER weight. might not work for other npcs who have neck seam, everyone's got a different weight.\n<br />\n<br />4) she might look funny but just type 'disable' (make sure she's still selected.)\n<br />\n<br />5) then 'enable'\n<br />\n<br />now you probably have something that looks like the images I've uploaded of Astrid.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Want that exact same lighting? I use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41482/]Rudy ENB [/url]with[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54553] Bokeh blur [/url]files. Guide on how to install is on each mod's description. Sure, I use other mods, but I am WAAAAY too lazy to get the links for *each* and *every* one. And you probably don't want to install them, too.",
