[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Ashley has a very exotic appearance, including blue and purple hair, strange hairstyles, excessive makeup, flashy jewelry, and a strangely shaped nose and chin, but has stunningly beautiful features that are almost too perfect to be real and are very mannequin-like.\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re interested in making your female Skyrim character look like a model from a Victoria&#39;s secret magazine makeup ad, then this is the character preset for you&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Ashley is very unique, and in a good kind of way, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll love this&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]===INSTALLATION===\r<br />[b]Step 1.
