  "descriptionHtml": "Long before the age of men, elves and dwemer reigned the divines and god\\'s of old. Cataclysmic events were shaping Tamriel as we know it. The god\\'s created beings as puppets to create new life: to create lesser beings. However, whilst the creation of angels and heroic beings were forged in light, dark and mysterious magics were plaguing the world. \r\nThe god\\'s were distracted with their own life forms that they had not realised that other powerful, behemoth like beings were being created...\r\nThe Dathrohan\\'s were alive. In fact, they were more than just alive, they were thriving. \r\nDemonic beings, far different from the Daedra had been forged, beings almost as powerful as the ancient god\\'s of old. \r\n\r\nThe immovable object had met the unstoppable force.\r\n\r\nThe god\\'s had met the Dathrohan\\'s.
