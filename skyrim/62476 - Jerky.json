  "descriptionHtml": "Adds jerky from meats such as beef, venison, goat, mammoth, horse, dog, and boar.   Requires All official DLCs.  These items can be crafted at a cookpot.  Some base meats have had their weights changed to more realistic numbers.  All recipes require 1 salt pile and 1 of the base meats.  If anyone would possibly want to make this mod compatible with RND or IMCN I would be ecstatic and would love you forever.  Also, if someone with modeling skill could shrink the model for the jerky as it currently uses the model for charred skeever meat/hide I would be greatly appreciative.  ",
