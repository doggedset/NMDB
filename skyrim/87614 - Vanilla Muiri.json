  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wonder how an NPC got to look so different? It&#39;s from a mod usually. So rather than mod the mod I just exported Muiri&#39;s vanilla state from CK. I actually quite like the vanilla Muiri. So this changes her back to vanilla. Just make sure it&#39;s last in your load order so it can over write any other mods that change Muiri&#39;s appearance.\r<br />\r<br />Known issue: Yes, I know that Muiri has face paint in the vanilla game, but it isn&#39;t in the screen shot. Though it doesn&#39;t make any sense, because the face paint is listed in CK under face parts and with the right color, but it doesn&#39;t show up. If anyone wants to try to fix this, you are more than welcome to.",
