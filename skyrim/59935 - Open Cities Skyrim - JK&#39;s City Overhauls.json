  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve always been bothered by the fact that there hasn&#39;t been larger support for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8058]Open Cities Skryim[/url] by Arthmoor. Especially when it comes to city overhauls&#33; Well I&#39;ve set out on a journey to start making compatibility patches for all the major mods out there that everyone loves using, that have prevented myself and others from being able to use Open Cities in a playthrough. And I&#39;m going to of course start with the AMAZING city overhauls by JK&#33;&#33;\r<br />You might not think it sounds like much, but being able to simply open the gates and walk right in to any of the 5 major cities adds a HUGE amount of immersion to the world. To me that is what role playing games are all ab\r<br />\r<br />All files updated to version 1.0&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;  All major issues and bugs have been fixed, navigation meshes checked and corrected and all files have been thoroughly cleaned&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />There are plans to release the Dawn Of Skyrim compatible JK files in the future as well, along with modular Dawn of Skyrim plugins to go along with them&#33; Although these will take a little bit of time. All other Open Cities patches I plan to release will all be posted under an &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59937]Open Cities Skyrim - Patch Centra[/url]l&#34; page that I plan to get up and going soon.\r<br />Starting out with Patches for all of the [url=http://wiki.step-project.com/Pack:Explorers_Guide]REGS[/url] mods&#33;&#33;&#33; For anyone not familiar with the REGS project, you should really go check it out... and for those that are, if you can imagine using the full REGS setup ALONG with Open Cities... well it&#39;s extremely awesome and a perfect addition to the immersive world of Skyrim that it creates.\r<br />\r<br />The main file posted will be a merged replacer ESP containing the Open Cities version of all 5 of the latest JK overhauls. However I&#39;ll also be posting modular downloads of each individual city for compatibility purposes. There will also be a &#34;Mod Compatible&#34; version of JK&#39;s Whiterun posted, which will be optimized for several other Open Cities patches that add things to Whiterun.\r<br />For example : [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11158/?]Breezehome Fully Upgradable[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58045/?]Merchants Of Skyrim[/url] , both of which are also great addon mods&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I should also note that[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56639/?] JK&#39;s Whiterun exterior[/url] is already fully compatible with Open Cities.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Special Thanks :\r<br />\r<br />Arthmoor - author of Open Cities Skyrim as well as the unofficial patches, Cutting Room Floor, Bring Out Your Dead etc..\r<br />[url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/1305814-jkrojmal/]jkrojmal[/url] - author of the JK&#39;s City Overhauls\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/3002048-nonoodles/]nonoodles[/url] - author of several other Open Cities patches. Special thanks to him for his TES5 tutorial on patch making&#33; If it wasn&#39;t for him then I probably wouldn&#39;t have been able to make this.\r<br />\r<br />matortheeternal - author of the famous TES5edit Merge Script, as well as the Automation Scripts that were used in making most of my patches&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Also a VERY special thanks to  [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/4434180-lylesloudmouth/]lylesloudmouth[/url]&#33;&#33;&#33;  Without his help we wouldn&#39;t be near as close as we are to having final versions with all the issues fixed. When I started this project I thought it was going to be a simple copy paste of JK&#39;s objects into the Open Cities world space... but there has been a LOT more involve than that. Big thanks to him for helping with the edits/updates&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />and of course thanks to Bethesda and all the Nexus community&#33;&#33;",
