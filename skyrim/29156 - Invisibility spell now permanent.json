  "descriptionHtml": "Ok so probably everyone knows about the invisibility spell in Skyrim which lasts about 30 seconds\r\nSometimes you just want more time or just feel like messing around a bit so thats why I created this little mod which extends the time period from 30 seconds to 535 days\r\nYou can find this spell lying next to your chest in breezehome in Whiterun\r\nIf you can\\'t buy the house yet or simply don\\'t have it just goto to the breezehome door press the tilde key (Thats the one to the left of 1 on your keyboard) then simply type in \\'\\'unlock\\'\\' (Without quotation marks) then you should be able to enter it",
