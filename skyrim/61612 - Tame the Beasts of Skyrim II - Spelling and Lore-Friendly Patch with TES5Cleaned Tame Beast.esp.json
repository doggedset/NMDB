  "descriptionHtml": "[center][u]Tame the Beasts of Skyrim II - Spelling, Grammar, and Lore-Friendly Patch\r<br />[/u][i]By: Dragonaion[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[b]These are patches&#33;[/b] Please download the original mod by [b]TheSkoomaKing[/b]: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50698/?\r<br />\r<br />I created this mod specifically because there were so many little things that bothered me to the point of making TtBoS2 completely unusable for me. This modifies a few things so that the writing, dialogue, and Thu&#39;um description is more lore-friendly and has the spelling and grammar errors remedied.\r<br />(To keep things tidy, older versions of the mod will be deleted so only one version of the main file can be downloaded)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Please Note&#33;[/u][/b]\r<br />If you have Lillehus Home, put this mod after TameBeasts.esp [b]and[/b] Lillehus.esp\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]This is due to the fact that this patch changes the environment to &#34;fix&#34; the door problem in front of the petshop. Lillehus will overwrite the changes, and will make it seem like there is still a &#34;bench&#34; in front of the petshop door.\r<br />\r<br />[/list][/center]\r<br />--\r<br />[u]Changes[/u]:\r<br />\r<br />Dialogue:\r<br />[list][*]Fixes minor spelling and grammar mistakes with Malbros&#39; subtitled speech[/*]\r<br />[/list][list][*]Rewrites the dialogue with Roselia the Breeder\r<br />[/*][*]Adds a new (my) voice to Roselia the Breeder with the new dialogue[/*]\r<br />[*]Pet speech has been rewritten to fix grammar and spelling mistakes[/*]\r<br />[*]PC speech options have been rewritten to fix grammar and spelling mistakes[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Writing:[list][*]Changes The Art of Taming I, II, and Horses to be more lore-friendly and with fixed grammar and spelling mistakes[/*]\r<br />[*]Dragon notes in the Dragon Book quest have been rewritten to be more lore-friendly[/*]\r<br />[*]All letters from Roselia have been rewritten to be more lore-friendly and with fixed grammar and spelling mistakes\r<br />[/*][/list][list][*]Breeder notes have been rewritten to be &#34;Pet Shop Flyers&#34; with fixed grammar and spelling mistakes[/*]\r<br />[*]Quest journals have been rewritten to fix grammar mistakes and make it more lore-friendly\r<br />[/*][/list]\r<br />World:[list][*]Raises the ground to meet the front door so there isn&#39;t a &#34;bench&#34; right in front of the door[/*]\r<br />[*]Roselia&#39;s Fox&#39;s cage has been made larger with a rug, silver plate, and silver bowl placed inside[/*]\r<br />[*]The Art of Taming II is on the desk inside the Pet Shop beside the other two books[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Thu&#39;um/Shout:[list][*]Rewrote the &#34;Tame Beast: Tame Beast&#34; shout description to be more lore-friendly \r<br />[/*][*]The words of power translations right underneath have been written to look like other shout descriptions[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />(4.0) Spells:\r<br />[list][*]Rewrote the spell names & descriptions to remove grammar and spelling mistakes, and to make it more lore-friendly[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />---------------\r<br />[u]Optional Files:\r<br />\r<br />[/u]Cleaned Tame Beast.esp:\r<br />[list][*]This is a &#34;dirty edit&#34; free rendition of the original mod&#39;s .esp[/*]\r<br />[*][b][i]The Original Mod is Still Necessary to Install&#33; [/i][/b](See the CleanedTameBeast.rar&#39;s README for Installation and Uninstallation instructions)[/*]\r<br />[/list]",
