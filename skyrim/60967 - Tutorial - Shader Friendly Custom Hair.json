  "descriptionHtml": "[left][size=2]It&#39;s as cold as Oblivion out here. My sword, my armor, even my skin is frosted over.\r<br />But my hair is FABULOUS and UNTOUCHED by said Frost&#33; :(\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]                              [color=#BF9000]   Shader Friendly Custom Hair[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />            [size=4][/size][color=#BF9000][size=4]What is this?[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]This is a tutorial for setting custom hair (Apachii SkyHair, SG Hairs, etc etc.) to be affected by shaders. \r<br />&#34;Shaders?&#34; you may ask, &#34;I haven&#39;t seen any shaders.&#34; Actually, you have. Spells, snow accumulation from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27563/?]Wet and Cold\r<br />[/url]Â or [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19660/?]Get Snowy[/url], the flesh deterioration from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36158/?]Necromancy-- Undead FX[/url]. These are all shaders.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />            [color=#BF9000][size=4]Why?[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]I was tired of having every part of my character be affected by Wet and Colds&#39; snow shader except my hair.\r<br />So I scoured the Nexus looking for a solution. I didn&#39;t see any solutions until I check the optional files for Vilja.\r<br />And then, there it was: &#34;Dogiers Shader Friendly Hair for Vilja&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />So that&#39;s where this came from. I picked apart the changes Dogier made, and found which one enabled the shaders.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />         [size=4]   [color=#BF9000]Usage[/color]\r<br />[/size][size=3]The tutorial itself should be easy enough to follow along, but my artistic skills are non-existent. This was an hours time, and it shows.\r<br />So if you make a better one, send it to me and I&#39;ll host it (while giving you credit for it, obviously).[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]ALSO: [size=3]I forgot to mention it in the tutorial (because I rushed to make it because of another mod I&#39;m making to include custom races in race checks), but hairline meshes already have the 4846 flag. So you don&#39;t have to touch those.[/size][/size][size=2]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=3][color=#ff0000]BACK UP THE HAIR MESHES BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS&#33;&#33;[/color]\r<br />Or keep a copy of the original mod, either way. [color=#ff0000]YOU WERE WARNED.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#BF9000]Permissions:[/color]\r<br />Permission? It&#39;s a tutorial. I&#39;d like a mention and one for Dogier if you share this, but, it&#39;s a tutorial. There really isn&#39;t any work to steal.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#BF9000]Credits:[/color]\r<br />Dogier, for actually figuring this problem out\r<br />The Paint.Net Team, for creating such an easy and versatile program.\r<br /> Bethesda, [s]for creating the most realistic crash simulator this side of Deadly Premonition[/s], I mean a wonderful(ish) game to mod.[/size][/left]",
