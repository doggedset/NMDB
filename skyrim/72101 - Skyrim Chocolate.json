I did my best, hope you invest few minutes to read all the changes and appreciate the final results. Some changes will have an attached link, which represent the relative mod from where the changes are inspired.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Drop & Loot overhaul[/b]:\r<br />[/color]\r<br />Skyrim Chocolate has many things in common with mods like [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44212/?tab=3&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D44212%26gid%3D110]Morrowloot [/url]or [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49496/?]Scarcity[/url]. Philosophy is the same (make things a little harder to obtain, and make drops a bit more realistic) but of course there are no drastic changes, loot is just more polished and rewarding compared to Vanilla.\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Removed enchanted weapons and armors from vendors.\r<br />[*]Reduced arrows, potions, ingredients, raw and refined materials sold by vendors.\r<br />[*]Globally decreased lockpicks dropped, looted and sold by vendors.\r<br />[*]Globally decreased gold dropped and looted.\r<br />[*]Better loot for animals and giants, no armors, weapons or gems, just more leather and animals part.\r<br />[*]Removed poison and resist potion dropped from spider and ice wrath (they are of course added to enemies loot)\r<br />[*]Increased salt founded in barrels (this will help with the new Cooking mechanics).\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Worthwhile Cooking[/b]:\r<br />\r<br />[/color]Cooking has been slightly changed and expanded. Basically &#34;Restore Health&#34; effects has been removed from uncooked food, so you are now forced to cook ingredients if you want to have a &#34;Restore Health&#34; resource.\r<br />Skyrim Chocolate contains every feature from my [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69576/?]Easy Food [/url]mod, for more info check the modpage.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Fortify Alchemy and Smithing no longer overpowered[/color][/b][color=yellow]:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />The following changes will make the Fortify Alchemy+Smithing &#34;exploit&#34; far less powerful. Indeed the most powerful Fortify Smithing you can now craft is +45%, which is still lower than the Blacksmith&#39;s Elixir (50%), a potion you can only find during exploration. \r<br />Also the new armor rating cap will increase the usefulness of other low tier armor even if full tempered with all the best potions and perk. \r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Fortify alchemy and smithing base enchant magnitude has been reduced from 8 to 2. \r<br />[*]Fortify alchemy and smithing enchant from existing items has been reduced by around 50%. \r<br />[*]Fortify smithing magnitude from ingredients has been halved.\r<br />[*]New armor rating cap set at 1059.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Tweaked Perks and Talent Trees[/b]:\r<br />\r<br />[/color]In Skyrim Chocolate few perks and trees has been tweaked in order to buff existing Perks, condense trees or make them more clear and intuitive. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-Alchemy:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]The whole tree has been redisigned in order to grant more freedom and don&#39;t force the player to chose undesired perks.\r<br />[*]Experimenter Perk now have 1 tier only.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />-Enchanting:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Fire, storm and frost perks are now stand-alone perks.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />-Smithing:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Dragon Smithing Perk now requires 90 smithing (instead of 100)\r<br />[*]Daedric Smithins Perk now requires 100 smithing (instead of 90)\r<br />[*]Light and Heavy armor now have separated branch\r<br />[*]Advanced Armors is now a stand-alone perk\r<br />[/list]\r<br />-Lockpicking:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Lockpicking has been reworked in order to be less demanding and a bit more interesting.
