  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod and it replaces the animal in Skyrim with Pokemon. So far this mod contains:\r\nDragons as Charizard;\r\nSpiders as Ariados;\r\nand Trolls as Machoke.\r\n\r\nI saw a picture with a Charizard coloured dragon in Skyrim and dovahkin holding a pokeball and wearing Ash\\'s hat and i though id try to find a mod containing the Charizard texture of a dragon but i couldnt so i decided to make my own. After learning how to make a mod and all that good stuff i finally retextured it and am now working on other creatures.\r\n\r\nIf you see any bugs you think is related to this mod please dont hesitate to tell me. Only the basic dragons are retextured so frost dragons and skeletal dragons are still the same. Also not all spiders ar Ariados and only frost trolls are Machoke. please excuse the shaggy looking design for this is my first mod and i plan to expand on it by changing the textures of some other animals into Pokemon. if you like this please show by leaving a comment or an endorsment or whatever so i can continue adding to this.\r\nBest played with Adolifs Pokeball mod for full Pokerim effect :)\r\nthanks to magic22 for making this video, guys go support this by watching, liking this video and subbing to his channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtxVs9a6lqU\r\nto get the news on any new updates first subscribe to my youtube channel : http://www.youtube.com/user/fiercedietyfan/videos\r\nor follow me on twitter: @nabeelakram6\r\n\r\nupdate: that post on 9gag was me so if anyone has any doubts this is just proof",
