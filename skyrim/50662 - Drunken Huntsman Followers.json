In an attempt to rectify this, I present to you 8 followers that really wouldn&#39;t fit in in a lot of other places.\r<br />\r<br />All of these followers level from 5 to infinity, all have the light foot perk to avoid setting off traps, are essential and will return to the Drunken Huntsman if dismissed. No mods or DLC are required.\r<br />\r<br />------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][i][b]Garnk, the Pale Orc[/b][/i][/size]\r<br />Visually differential from all other orcs without being distractingly so, is Garnk, the Pale Orc: Barbarian (light armour, two-hander user).\r<br />[i]Perks: Barbarian 3/5, Champion’s Stance, Devastating Blow, Skullcrusher 2/3, Agile Defender 3/5, Unhindered[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][i][b]Zhiir[/b][/i][/size]\r<br />Zhiir is a large khajiit with a penchant for big swords and red warpaint, which may not be paint at all: Vanguard (heavy armour, two-hander user).\r<br />[i]Perks: Barbarian 3/5, Champion’s Stance, Devastating Blow, Deep Wounds 1/3, Juggernaut 3/5, Conditioning, Well Fitted[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][i][b]Draren the Skull[/b][/i][/size]\r<br />This handsome fellow favours dual wielding and stealth, and is totally not a murderer: Assassin (light armour, dual wield).\r<br />[i]Perks: Stealth 5/5, Muffled Movement, Silence, Deft Movement, Agile Defender 3/5, Unhindered, Custom Fit, Matching Set[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][i][b]Narellen[/b][/i][/size]\r<br />You may notice a distinct lack of weaponry about his person, but don&#39;t worry; he conjures it, and 90% of the time he doesn&#39;t stab himself in the face whilst doing so: Narellen (heavy armour, conjured sword).\r<br />[i]Perks: Armsman 3/5, Fighting Stance, Bladesman 1/3, Novice Conjuration, Mystic Binding, Juggernaut 3/5, Conditioning[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][i][b]Anra[/b][/i][/size]\r<br />This petite bosmer babe is just as happy to stick an arrow through you as a dagger: Ranger (light armour, bow user).\r<br />[i]Perks: Overdraw 3/5, Ranger, Quick Shot, Armsman 2/5, Agile Defender 3/5, Unhindered, Custom Fit, Stealth 5/5, Muffled Movement[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][i][b]Katrin the Bear[/b][/i][/size]\r<br />Her combat style is reminiscent of the Vikings, but unfortunately so are her manners: Vikings (light armour, axe, shield and bow).\r<br />[i]Perks: Overdraw 3/5, Shield Wall 3/5, Power Bash, Armsman 3/5, Hack and Slash 2/3, Agile Defender 3/5, Unhindered, Stealth 1/5, Muffled Movement[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][i][b]Urza Gro-Marak[/b][/i][/size]\r<br />With sword and board in hand, she&#39;s here to convince you to keep your mouth shut about the fact she can&#39;t shut hers: Tank (heavy armour, sword and shield).\r<br />[i]Perks: Armsman 2/5, Bladesman 1/3, Juggernaut 3/5, Well Fitted, Conditioning, Matching Set, Tower of Strength, Shield Wall 5/5, Deflect Arrows[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][i][b]Valae[/b][/i][/size]\r<br />How she came to be blind, I do not know, but I suspect it&#39;s something to do with her fondness for burning things: Fire Mage (no armour, destruction, conjuration).\r<br />[i]Perks: Novice Destruction, Apprentice Destruction, Augmented Flames 2/2, Novice Conjuration, Apprentice Conjuration, Summoner 1/2, Atromancy, Novice Alteration, Apprentice Alteration, Mage Armor 3/3 [/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />---------\r<br />[b]Credits[/b] (none of these mods are required)\r<br />\r<br />Male Body meshes: Better Males (Sundacron) by Chris57/Sundacron\r<br />Male Body and Face textures: Better Males by Geonox/Chris57\r<br />Female Body meshes: UNP by dimon99\r<br />Female Body Textures: Mature skin by Maevan2\r<br />Female Normal Maps: Sporty Sexy Map by xs2reality\r<br />Khajiit Textures: Coverkhajiits by mrLenski\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda, for Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r<br />",
