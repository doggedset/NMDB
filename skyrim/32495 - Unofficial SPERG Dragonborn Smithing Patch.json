  "summary": "This unofficial patch for SPERG fixes the bug with Dragonborn weapons and armor that doubles the bonus you gain from tempering them.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is an UNOFFICIAL Patch for the Skyrim Perk Enhancement and Rebalanced Gameplay (SPERG) mod which addresses an issue with Dragonborn.\r\n\r\nUsers with Dragonborn without this patch can improve dragonborn equipment (Bonemold, Chitin, Nordic Carved armor, Stahlrim Armor, Morag Tong Armor, and Skaal Armor) twice as much without taking the SPERG perks which are supposed to boost crafting. Users who DID take the crafting perks get double the effect which can make Dragonborn weapons and armors significantly stronger than they should be.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this patch REQUIRES the original SPERG file (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24445) to work properly. If you install this patch without first loading SPERG, then you will lose the ability to double-temper dragonborn weapons and armor!\r\n\r\nThis patch is uploaded with permission from Seorin, and will be removed when an official compatibility patch for Dragonborn is released for SPERG.",
