  "descriptionHtml": "Adds two new swords that can be crafted at Skyforge.\r\nRequires 100 Smithing, Enchanting and Alchemy.\r\nScroll to create the custom ingredient can be found near Skyforge.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Transform spell uses Firestorm effect, but it does not damage anyone nor does it initiate hostilities. It does, however, knock items around so I\\'d recommend strongly against using it inside your neatly arranged house.\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent couple of weeks trying to learn Blender, GIMP and NifSkope in order to make custom weapons for my char. Those swords turned out to be quite decent, so I put them here for public use too.\r\n\r\nThe both of these swords have same model and the only difference is different engravings (that are pretty much just the name of the weapon and some additional smack-talk in Draconic).\r\n\r\nThe swords are pretty powerful (30 absorb health and 30 absorbs stamina enchant with unlimited charges and almost as high base damage as daedric sword that is improved using smithing-alchemy-enchanting synergy) and thus require you to have all three crafting skills maxed. They also need a lot of ingredients and Dragon Souls to be crafted. Dragon Souls can be transformed into item form using scrolls that can be found near Skyforge. Scroll respawn, but the initial 10 pieces should be enough for crafting. Dragon Souls [items] can also be used as Grand Soul Gems for normal enchanting.\r\n\r\nThe swords are not disenchantable, you can\\'t improve them and you probably won\\'t find merchant that buys them. They also won\\'t respawn after being picked up.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use them in any of your own mods, feel free to do so as long as you remember to give me credit for my work.\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n\r\nV2.1:\r\n\r\n- Added 2 Dragon Souls to the list of ingredients. You can convert your Dragon Souls into item form using scrolls that can be found near Skyforge.\r\n\r\nV2:\r\n\r\n- Changed the weapons to be craftable. Requirements: 100 smithing/enchanting/alchemy and at Skyforge\r\n- Removed the pre-placed swords.\r\n\r\nV1:\r\n- Initial upload, only the weapons themselves. Can be found near Skyforge.\r\n- Reduced damage with optional, alternative .esp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: Original files that let you just pick the swords up near Skyforge can still be found under \\\"old files\\\".",
