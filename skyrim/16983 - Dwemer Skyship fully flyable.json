Requirements:\r\n#1 Skyrim – Version 1.5.26.0\r\n#2 SKSE - http://skse.silverlock.org/beta/skse_1_05_02.7z\r\n(SKSE IS REQUIRED!!! You will only be able to steer the ship if you install SKSE!!!)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n#1 Make sure you’re running the mentioned version of Skyrim(1.5.26.0) and SKSE(1_05_02 or higher)\r\n#2 Install via Nexus Mod Manager or copy all the files of the archive to your Skyrim/Data folder\r\n#3 Activate the .esp if you haven’t done already\r\n#4 Start Skyrim via the skse_loader.exe of SKSE and fight some dragons mid-air!\r\n(Make yourself a shortcout to your desktop to never forget skse_loader!!!)\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\nThis mod doesn’t replace any vanilla files – modified files have their own subfolders\r\n#1 Just uncheck Dwemer_Skyship_v1.esp from your Mod Manager list\r\n\r\n\r\nSkyship Location:\r\n#1 West of Riverwood along the road at the Guardian Stones\r\n#2 *** Make sure to take the book out of the chest there ***\r\n\r\n\r\nSteering Manual:\r\nThe book will grant you further options like:\r\n#1 Activation from anywhere\r\n#2 Setting Flight Mode from SetVehicle with OffSet Camera and Havoked where you can walk around the deck and fight anything in sight\r\n#3 Assigning customized keys for steering (make sure to hold at least 1-4 seconds till the messagebox re-appears to map the key)\r\n#4 Default Keys are Arrow Keys for Forward, Backward, Left, Right\r\nRight Ctrl for “Down” to lose height\r\nRight Shift for “Up” to gain height\r\nDel for \\\"strafe Left\\\"\r\nPage down for \\\"strafe Right\\\"\r\nNumpad 0 for “Handbrake” to reduce any speeds to 0 quickly\r\nEnter for “Dismount” to stop your current flying session\r\n#5 The Skyship can also be activated via the steering wheel (if u haven’t sunk the wheel into a stone, then i recommend using the book in non-havoked mode to get the Skyship back into an accessible position)\r\n#6 In case of having lost or sold the book; a new one can be added to the inventory by opening console “^” and entering “player.additem 2000d7b 1”\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n#1 – Player can fall trough deck/collision object of the havoked-ship.nif if going too fast (dismount if falling to be ported back on deck to prevent death and reactivate your flying session again manually)\r\n#2 - Player Ragdoll sometimes stuck on objects on the ground and causing death on dismount\r\n#3 – Assigning an already used key like walk modifier will result in a toggle\r\n#4 – The combined Skyship.nif files can cause a CTD/fps impact on weak/low hardware performance\r\n#5 – Little to high stuttering while steering the ship on high to low fps drop (for example activation of fraps or loading of a new cell) will relax after approx. 2-8 seconds on constant fps (frameadaptive translatespeed)\r\n#6 - Player stuttering on havoked version is caused due to asynchron havok updates\r\n#7 - The book can be sold, dropped or lost, looking for a hint on how to make it unsellable/undropable without defining it as a quest item\r\n#8 - Your Horse (if u got one) will fall through the ship when u fast travel to the Skyship marker and activate the non-havoked version\r\n#9 - If you reach the end of the world you won’t be able to go any further, turn around!\r\n#10 - The new euler implementation for local to global rotation is not suited for translating objects, just for calculating endpoints (at a tilt of 90 degree, hitting a gimble lock situation causes a 360°-turn of the object)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlans for future updates:\r\n#1 Troubleshooting Bugs from Open Beta Release\r\n#2 Include more ship models\r\n#3 Include pirate clothes\r\n#4 Make a questline (rebuild the crashed ship to make it flyable)\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking for:\r\n#1 Beta Testers to Report Bugs and give Feedback to improve this mod\r\n#2 Landshapers who might want to model a whole new world especially for skyships\r\n#3 Help at improving havoking of the player model to better collide with the havoked ship version\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Modders:\r\n#1 Almost all modified or new objects in the Creation Kit are prefixed with “_NoxyGame_” if you want to find all necessary modifications, so use this as a filter\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits to:\r\n#1 For the people that inspired me to start modding skyships\r\nZolo2006: making the skyship flyable in Oblivion\r\nDOSMaster for writing the Skyrim Skyship script\r\nHenkBein, QuarnAndKivan, Luke2135 for their scripts I used/modified\r\nmr_siika: meshes and textures, scripting\r\nQQuix: dwemer parachute\r\ncenturion: Interior building and CS work\r\nrung: quests, bug-fixing\r\n#2 Credits to Bethesda Game Studios for The Elder Scroll Series\r\n#3 Credits to Dark0ne for the Nexus - bringing the community and their creativity together\r\n#4 Credits to SLuckyD for giving me a reason to hurry up the official beta release\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nIf you’re thinking about using parts of this mod (Script for example), don’t forget to name us  (NoxyGame and DOSMaster) in your “Credits to:” section.\r\nIn other words, feel free to use/enhance the script/nif/mod, but give credits to the author!",
