  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#FF0000]V2.2: Fixes issue with Siara&#39;s subtitles if subtitles not enabled.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Ever wonder why all potential followers seem to just sit around waiting for you to recruit them instead of being out adventuring?  Now you can have 3 that will travel the roads on their own until you recruit them and will go back to wandering if you release them, unless you set a new home for them with a mod such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045/?]My Home Is Your Home[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF0000]REQUIREMENTS:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />None.  The new quests all have voice files but if you do have issues then I recommend using  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14884/?]Fuz Ro D-oh - Silent Voice[/url] and  [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE)[/url] \r<br />\r<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]The followers added are:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]Kati:[/color] A Redguard mage who is devoted to healing.  She does love to fight with her dagger though and will heal you when she can. Her heals will also cure poison.  If asked she will also cure any disease along with poison while out of combat.  In Option 2 Kati is a fire mage in addition to being a healer.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]Siara:[/color] A Woodelf hunter/ranger.  She lives more for the hunt but will gladly assist you in any battle.  Her preference is a bow, 1-handed weapons and light armor.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]Talrik:[/color] Your typical Nord warrior with a preference for two-handed weapons and heavy armor.\r<br />\r<br />All 3 followers are set for potential spouses and are essential. They initially start out near Whiterun but should immediately hit the road and start wandering about Skyrim. If you decide to release them from following you they will eventually go back to wandering the roads unless you use a mod to designate a home position for them.\r<br />\r<br />All 3 followers have a basic quest you will need to complete before you will be able to recruit them.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]COMPATIBILITY:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />- This mod should be compatible with any mod as long as vanilla travel locations are not removed or drastically changed.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]ISSUES:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />- No bugs that I&#39;m aware of.  I&#39;ve heavily tested this mod and found no issues so far.\r<br />\r<br />- Keep in mind that Kati will help you fight rather than just stand around and heal you.  She will heal you when she can but you still want to monitor your health just in case she is busy defending herself.  She will heal you as soon as she is able.\r<br />\r<br />- The dialogue for the quests may seem a bit lame possibly as I phrased things to work with existing voice files so their voices would remain the same.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]FUTURE PLANS:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />For now, I consider this mod complete aside from fixing any bugs that may come up. I may at some point consider adding more followers or possibly adding more locations for them to travel to.  If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know.  I can&#39;t guarantee I&#39;ll be able to add them but I will consider it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]INSTALLATION:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Just unzip and drag the data folder to your skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]UPGRADING:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Due to the changes from V1.0 to V2.1, I would recommend following the uninstall instructions and then doing a clean save before installing V2.0\r<br />\r<br />- If upgrading from V2.0 to V2.1, follow the uninstall instructions and then do a clean save before installing V2.1 (I highly recommend going back to a save before you installed V2.0 though as I had to make some major changes in V2.1)\r<br />\r<br />- If upgrading from 2.1 to 2.2 simply install 2.2 over 2.1\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]UNINSTALLING:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />1. Dismiss all followers from this mod if you have any.\r<br />2. Go to a location without any of the mod&#39;s NPCs.\r<br />3. Make a new save.\r<br />4. Delete the RW_Traveler.esp and RW_Traveler.bsa files from your data folder\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]CHANGELOG:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />2/3/2014: V2.2. Fixes issue with Siara&#39;s subtitles if subtitles not enabled.\r<br />\r<br />2/1/2014: V2.1 release. Fixed Kati&#39;s broken healing abilities, add the ability for her to cure disease, rewrote the basic quest for all 3 followers.\r<br />\r<br />1/21/2014: V2.0 release. Added healing abilities to Kati and added simple quests to complete before Kati, Siara, or Talrik can become your follower.\r<br />\r<br />7/30/2013:  V1.0 Original release\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]CREDITS:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />- m0nster and his  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15501/?]Travellers of Skyrim[/url] mod.  If not for his work I&#39;d likely never have thought of making this mod.\r<br />\r<br />- elliotcroft and his [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37561/?]Magoza - a Healing Companion[/url] mod.  When I couldn&#39;t reproduce his method of healing properly I was inspired to research papyrus and make one of my own based upon his.\r<br />",
