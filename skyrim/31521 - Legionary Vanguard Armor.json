  "descriptionHtml": "FACEBOOK!\r\nI now have a facebook page! So now you can easily get mod updates, chat to me, give me ideas, sketches, organize  mod projects or anything really. You may even on occasion get access to betas so I can get feedback before releasing final mods. This is the best place to message me as Nexus and steam workshop have limited messaging capability so on here I will always have a record of conversations:)\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Maty743-Modder/531811283537450?ref=hl\r\n\r\nLegionary Vanguard Armor \r\n[youtube]1bfRqYtHq3k[/youtube]\r\nIf you don\\'t like this mod please explain why in a constructive way and not just abuse it. It\\'s hard to get motivation to improve and continue modding when all you get \\\"this is crap\\\". I appreciate constructive feedback and try to embrace it and improve because of it with every new mod release.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nMOD FEATURES \r\n- All races and genders supported. (was designed for use of human players though.) \r\n- World/menu armor pieces \r\n- New custom handmade meshes and textures. \r\n- Weight support form male characters. \r\n- Lore friendly \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nHOW TO ACQUIRE \r\nYou will need the Advanced smithing perk (used to create steelplate armor). The armor can be created at the forge under the Imperial category. The armor has about the same stats as Steelplate armor. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nSIDE NOTES \r\n- I have deliberately made the female armor quite bulky as it is ARMOR! \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nPERMISSIONS \r\n- At the moment my assets are not available due to the fact I will be making new armors out of some of these assets. Translation conversions are fine, just credit me and link. If you wanted to use this mod in a quest you can however... Just make duplicate files with the same names as this mod then ask the user to download this as well and put higher in the load order. That means your default armor files will be replaced with these armor files in game. This method also allows both parties to get credit for their contributions easily due to the user having to download both mods. Message me if you\\'re not sure what I mean. \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nDONATORS \r\nA huge thank you to users that have decided to make a donation. It is really appreciated. Thanks! \r\n- VxVanguard321 \r\n- Tfig2110 ",
