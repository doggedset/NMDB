  "modName": "Special People",
  "summary": "Now many of the sweet citizens and followers of Skyrim come with their own unique weapons&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]First and foremost, a massive thank you to Billyro, Jrc0011, Ghosu (retroactively), Johnskyrim, Standalone09, Jmenaru, Kettlewitch, Satyr Zerofrost and Faxivcm&#33; Thier positively gorgeous weapons and generosity in letting me compile this mod is the reason it exists. It was they who did all the heavy lifting&#33;\r<br />[/b]\r<br />About the mod:\r<br />\r<br />Special People was birthed out of a displeasure of getting followers who . . Lacked a certain uniqueness, aside from them being unique NPC&#39;s and having &#34;unique&#34; checqued in thier data. Beyond that, I thought it might be nice if NPC&#39;s, who are unique, would also have a weapon that is unique. . even armour that is unique, to give them a somewhat unique feel beyond follower X who you only get one of. Mjoll was obviously the inspiration for this. So this mod adds unique weapons made by various modders here on the nexus, to several NPC&#39;s.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Regarding load order, [color=#cc0000]conflicts[/color], and other important things[/b]. . This mod alters NPC records, notably thier weapon and armour in some cases. [b]Any mod that touches an NPC record that this mod touches, will conflict with this mod[/b]. So im not talking about textures, but actual esp&#39;s that alter an NPC that this one also does. However, it is very easy to make this compatible with anything, and I welcome submissions for compatibility patches to mods that have large overlaps with this one.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you run in to compatibility issues, leave a comment and we can work it out.\r<br />\r<br />As a final note, some of the original names of the weapons were changed to fit more &#34;nicely&#34; in to Skyrim, and not done in any attempt to take credit for work that isn&#39;t mine. The armour and weapon data are based off of vanilla stats. Future patches may fix that in an effort to make it useful with overhauls. And finally, if you have Ghosu&#39;s weapon pack, JRC Witcher Swords pack, and any of the aformentioned authors weapons armors, you may not quite enjoy this as much, or at least you will already have some of the stuff included in this mod installed. [i]These textures do not exceed 2k unless their was no option for anything less than 4k via the original author[/i]. [b][color=#cc0000]Another heads up of a potential bug[/color][/b]: If you install this mod and have one of the followers affected currently following you, he or she may be unable to draw thier weapon (with an infinite animation loop and obnoxious noise). The only solution i&#39;m aware of to this is to deactivate the ESP, dismiss the follower, allowing them to go to thier own location, and then activate the esp. You may or may not have this issue, but I havn&#39;t come up with a solution to it in my own experiences.\r<br />\r<br />If you find any misbehaving weapons/enchantments, please report it.
