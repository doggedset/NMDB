  "descriptionHtml": "Wolf Companion v1.0\r\n\r\n-by SubRosa_Florens\r\nisubrosa@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nThis mod adds a wolf companion named Gladio to the game. He can be found just outside of Riverwood, standing at the western end of the bridge. He uses the same AI that the dog followers use, which is very basic. Simply click on him once and he will become your follower. You will not see any on screen messages when you do, or otherwise command him. When you walk away, you will note that he now follows you (though he has a rather large following distance, blame Bethesda, that is how they coded it). He will take an aggressive posture when you draw a weapon, and will attack anyone you fight with. He is flagged as essential, so you do not have to worry about him dying on you.\r\n\r\nVersion 3.1 of Followers Can Relax works with Gladio. I highly recommend using this in tandem with Wolf Companion, as it allows you to leave Gladio somewhere, and come back for him later. Get it here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9504 \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nSimply copy the wolf companion.esp file to your Skyrim\\\\data folder. When you start Skyrim, select the Wolf Companion mod. \r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n1.0 -\r\nOriginal Release\r\n",
