  "summary": "More vampire-like eyes for Babette.",
  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />My first ever uploaded mod.\r<br />I always found it strange that Babette was supposedly a child who turned vampire, but everything about her appearance remained drastically the same as any other child&#39;s. So, this is just a small mod that makes Babette of the Dark Brotherhood appear more... unnatural, compared to other children\r<br />found in Skyrim.Â \r<br />\r<br />It doesn&#39;t change her outfit, it merely changes the texture of her eyes and lightens her skin tone a little.\r<br />\r<br />I urge someone to please create a better mod than this for Babette, seeing as how I am very, very &#39;not good&#39; at this sort of thing. I originally wanted to modify it so that she has the eyes like the Dawnguard vampires, but I wouldn&#39;t even know where to start or how I go about doing that.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=3]Installation[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Simply extract the contents of the file into your Data folder in your game directory.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff0000]Doed NOT work with any other mod that alters Babette&#39;s appearance&#33;[/color]\r<br />[size=1]*obviously*[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/b][size=3][u][b]Requirements\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u][/size]As far as I can tell you don&#39;t need anything other than the base game.\r<br />If the mod doesn&#39;t work, please let me know&#33;",
