Ull possessed warrior-like attributes and was called upon for aid in individual combat. He resided at Ydalir (Yew Dales).\r\n\r\nAlthough not much has been recorded about Ull, he must have been a very prominent deity in the Norse pantheon at one time because, according to one tradition, the god Odin offered Ull’s favours as a reward to the one who would aid him. In addition, Ull’s name appears as part of many Swedish and Norwegian place-names. In the chronicles of the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus, Ollerus is the equivalent of Ull.\\\"\r\n\r\n-Enyclopedia Britanica-\r\n\r\n[u][font=Hobo STD][heading][color=#228b22]Description:[/color][/heading][/font][/u]\r\n\r\nv1.5 Added a new craftable bow found in Wood at the forge.\r\nv1.4 Check Change-log for update.\r\nv1.3 Check Change-log for update.\r\nv1.2 Check Change-log for update.\r\n\r\nDragonborn Required\r\n\r\nAdds a set of Retextured Nordic Carved Armor, Comes in Light and Can be crafted under the Wood cataegory in the tanning rack. An Armor ment for the master huntsman,\r\nyou will make great use of your extra Pelts.\r\n\r\nThis Armor is scaled to Dragon Scale Quality, but getting the materials isn\\'t easy.  For most recipes you need Bear, Wolf, and Fox fur.  As well as\r\nFirewood to carve and a Carving Knife.  The Knife can be crafted with Iron, leather strip, and firewood.  Also to give the wood a nice glossy finish\r\nyou are required to acquire Spriggan sap.\r\n\r\nI made this mod for my Current playthrough, a Nordic Ranger.  An Elite Hunter and explorer, I feel this armor will be a great end game for my story.\r\nI may or may not make a bow to go with this armor, but for now I recommend \\\"Faal Sizaan: by Artisantix.\r\n\r\nThis armor comes in both Male and Female sizes.  Does not Support UNP or CBBE.\r\n\r\n[u][font=Hobo STD][heading][color=#688e23]Installation:[/color][/heading][/font][/u]\r\n\r\nIf done manually, extract contents into Skyrim/Data folder.  If through nexus mod manager, just download and install through Manager.\r\n\r\n[u][font=Hobo STD][heading][color=#008000]Credits:[/color][/heading][/font][/u]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3201]Fur Hoods HD[/url]\r\nI would like to thank Northborn, creator of Fur Hoods HD for allowing me to use his Model and texture for the \\\"Cowl of Ulle\\\".\r\n\r\n[u][font=Hobo STD][heading][color=#ffff00]Recommended mods:[/color][/heading][/font][/u]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14085]Faal Sizaan[/url] by Artisantix\r\n\t\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13486]Winter Is Coming - Cloaks[/url] by Nivea - If you would like a more Thicker look.\r\n\r\n[u][font=Hobo STD][heading][color=#808000]Bugs/Conflicts:[/color][/heading][/font][/u]\r\n\r\nNo Known bugs, but from my experience with Modding some users whom have played my mods experience a texture issue.  Im not sure what causes it, but \r\nsome say running the game textures on high quality or even downloading Adobe photoshop trial mode can fix it.\r\n\r\nThis mod uses its own Models and textures, so conflicts are to a minimum if not any.",
