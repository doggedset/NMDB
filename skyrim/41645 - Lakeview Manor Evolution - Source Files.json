This means that you should go through the mod cleaning process before uploading your own creation to Nexus.\r<br />\r<br />All that I ask is that you drop me a credit if you do use these resources. You should also include credits for the other modders resources I&#39;ve used to create Lakeview Manor Evolution.  You can find the list on the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55154/?]Lakeview Manor Evolution[/url] mod page.\r<br />\r<br />Also, if you do upload your own modified Lakeview Manor based on the included .esp file please let me know via a PM and I will add a link to it here and on the Lakeview Manor Evolution mod page.",
