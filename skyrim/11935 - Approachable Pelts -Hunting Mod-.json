  "modName": "Approachable Pelts -Hunting Mod-",
  "summary": "A small mod that improves hunting by increasing the price of pelts and tusks. Not too much, not too little.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Have you completely neglected the game-hunting aspect of Skyrim like I have? Have deer and foxes always meant nothing to you? Well no more! Now you have motivation to strap your bow across your back and head out into the wilderness! \r\n\r\nWhile scouring SkyrimNexus and the Workshop I was disappointed with the selection of hunting mods available. Some made the pelts far too expensive(to the point a cow skin was worth more than 3 decent gems) and some not expensive enough. So here it is, my sweet spot mod.\r\n\r\nShould make for more rewarding hunting, while still making you put in an effort to afford that first horse. \r\n\r\nMost the pelts prices were increased by either x2, x2.5, or x3. \r\nSome pelts were increased even more so, such as the fox and the even rarer snow fox. Now you actually have a reason to hunt these cute little critters. You\\'re welcome! \r\n\r\nTusks were also increased in price a bit.\r\n\r\nThis mod suits my hunting needs and I hope it will suit yours as well. Happy hunting! \r\n\r\nCompatibility: Should be compatible with anything that doesn\\'t affect pelt and tusk prices. \r\n\r\nIf any problems or questions should arise, let me know and I\\'ll do my best to address them. :)\r\n\r\nUpdate: As requested, a vanilla mammoth tusk price version has been uploaded for your convenience. :)\r\n",
