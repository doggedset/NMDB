  "summary": "This mod adds a degree of realism by limiting the number ingredients the player can carry at one time. This limit is applied _per ingredient_ so that the player can carry a wide variety of ingredients but doesn&#39;t end up carrying an excessive amount of any particular ingredient. By crafting better alchemy satchels players can increase this limit",
