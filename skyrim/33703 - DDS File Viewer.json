  "descriptionHtml": "This isn\\'t a mod so don\\'t download it with the NMM.  Compared to the Skyrim DDS viewer file this is TINY and I take NO credit for it.\r\n\r\nI could NEVER get gimp to work. Never could get the Nvidia dds viewer to work.  Sagethumbs, after allowing this iiitsy view of the dds wouldn\\'t allow me to move the file , rename or anything. I\\'d have to reboot.\r\n\r\nThis thing it TINY.  I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR THIS FILE. ALL THE INFO IS IN THE README.TXT FILE.\r\n\r\nApparently there\\'s a new version from the original author at Nvidia.  See my POSTS for the link.  Also on that page is a Windows dds thumbnail viewer that I couldn\\'t get to work on my system...\r\n\r\nUse the help tab to turn it off or on for explorer shell extensions.\r\n\r\nTested with Comodo, AVG, Avast and norton.  Still... it\\'s an executable so...check again even though i set the thing to read only AND it\\'s in a zipfile.  Heck. Even Nexus got hacked.\r\n\r\nBTW... YaaaaY. Finally a TINY program I can use to view the oh say.. heck.. i dunno.. 4TB of texture files I have now.",
