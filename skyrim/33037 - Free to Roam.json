  "summary": "For those who feel pushed into the main quest line - this mod makes the quest \\\"Before the storm\\\" a miscellaneous one. So, after you exit Helgen, and are offered help from Ralof/Hadvar,the quest will still start, you will still be able to talk to Gerdur/Alvor and continue the Main Questline, but it wont stand out as a priority, as it did before.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=yellow][heading]Description[/heading]\r\nAfter you escape the dragon attack on Helgen, you are offered help from Ralof/Hadvar. You are free to roam, and yet the simple offer of help from the residents of Riverwood is displayed as something urgent - something which just stays there - staring down at you as a necessity throughout your playthrough, every single time you open the quest menu.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=green]Now, this is one very simple, yet for some (including myself) very useful mod. As I felt that starting the main questline had a far too obligating feeling to it (and thus, hard to avoid for those who don\\'t want to play the Dovahkiin in each and every new playthrough), this mod makes it so, that the quest \\\"Before the Storm\\\", in which you are directed to Riverwood is classified under \\\"miscellaneous\\\" - making it seem less urgent, and leaving you with a clear conscience to roam and explore Skyrim, without having to worry about the dragons for a while.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]I have also added a separate file that makes the starting quest for the Dawnguard DLC (Dawnguard) a miscellaneous one.[/color]",
