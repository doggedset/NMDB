  "descriptionHtml": "Swaps the sprint animation for the tail with the walk animation. End result: when sprinting, your tail will move more gently (you may not like this), but most importantly, when you go from sprinting to walking... your tail won&#39;t freak out.\r<br />\r<br />Basically this is a workaround to deal with something that has bugged me since the game came out. I don&#39;t really understand how the animation system works, but if you sprint... the sprint animation for your tail will continue until you A) stop moving completely B) jump or C) sneak.\r<br />\r<br />If anyone knows how to fix the original animation, PLEASE let me know. As far as I can see, it seems like the &#34;sprintStop&#34; anim event isn&#39;t telling the tail animation to stop.",
