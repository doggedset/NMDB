  "modName": "Paladins Of Dovahkiin",
  "summary": "This mod adds seven new followers into Skyrim. I mainly made them for the UFO mod so you could make your own easily without searching through Skyrim. They can be found in The Banered Mare in Whiterun. They are all over 25 levels.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The Mod includes: \r\nA Orc - Who is a barbarian \r\nA Breton - Who is a master wizard \r\nA Redguard - Who is a pro Ranger \r\nA Wood Elf - Who is a pro archer \r\n3 Nords - Who are all warriors two have a sword and shield. And the other is a barbarian. \r\n\r\nWhy should you get it: \r\nThis mod will add a little army of your own to skyrim which will be useful when hunting those dwarvish ruins or battling huge waves of enemies \r\n\r\nOther mods that go great with my mod: \r\nUFO - Ultimate follower overhaul so you can get all the followers at once \r\nWarzones - Civil Unrest so you can battle huge waves of enemies with your followers \r\n\r\nFuture ideas: \r\nIf I get enough downloads of this mod than I will add even more paladins to the faction",
