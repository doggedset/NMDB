  "summary": "The skull of an ancient creature wearable by all races, male and female. Craftable and upgradeable. Available in 1, 2 and 4K texture resolutions.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The skull of an ancient, 4-horned reptile crafted into a wearable helmet. I&#39;ve made 3 different palette swaps - default, bloodied and blackened. The only difference is cosmetic. The attributes are the same for each one. \r<br />It can be located in a chest outside North Brittleshin Pass but can also be crafted using bone meal, void salts and either a daedra heart, human heart or human flesh depending on which version you want. It can also be tempered.\r<br />\r<br />The helmet is wearable by all races, male and female though on male Argonians you can see the spikes on the side and back of their heads poking through it a bit. It works fine for every other race and gender and in order to fix it I would have had to do far more work than it was worth doing so I left it. I don&#39;t play Argonians anyway and it&#39;s not a huge problem in my opinion.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s available in 1K, 2K and 4K textures.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Her515 and Redd and everyone else in Darkfox127&#39;s Discord for helping me out with Max and Nifskope and the Creation Kit.\r<br />\r<br />Check out Her515&#39;s mods [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/17295269/?tb=mods&pUp=1]here[/url]\r<br />\r<br />*Permissions*\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t upload my mod to any other site & do not use it in your own without asking first please.\r<br />If you want to use my mod in your own mod then please contact me first & I&#39;ll consider it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkN_dlUwVpL5dSzAdLsrLA]S.Silin (Ikari)[/url] for featuring my mod on YouTube :\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]TV9cbibXPjI[/youtube]",
