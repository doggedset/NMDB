  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]uOUEl9_7R5g[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />-Description-\r<br />\r<br />As an unserious and pretty much lore-unfriendly mod, this is actually a port from Garry&#39;s Mod. It adds baby dolls known as Kewpie from the infamous, japanese Tarako Pasta Sauce commercials. They will stalk you in purpose of killing you, giving you an option to run. For your life. This mod also adds a conjuration spelltome that you can read and learn a spell that summons a doll to distract your enemies. You can find the tome near the lumbermill in Riverwood.\r<br />\r<br />So far, I haven&#39;t intergrated the dolls to any leveled lists. If you want to spawn them yourself, bring up the console and type &#34;help kewpie&#34; and you should see the list of the NPC base ID. Then you type &#34;player.placeatme xxxxxxxx&#34; without the quotes. I don&#39;t recommend spawning the one farthest down in the list as that&#39;s the summon.\r<br />\r<br />I know there&#39;s many players who will find this mod horryfying (which is intended), but could you please keep your immature comments for yourselves and try to be more positive or constructive? ^^&#39; It was actually fun reading &#34;freaked out&#34; comments at first, but I feel like it&#39;s getting kinda repetive the more popular this mod gets. Hope you understand, and thank you for looking.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-New in 1.1-\r<br />Fixed the normalmap, thanks to ImsumDave&#33;\r<br />Added a cloak ability so the dolls actually deal damage.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-Future plans-\r<br />If I find motivation, I will add the dolls to some leveled lists. Also I will increase their health points to make them slightly harder to kill.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-Known issues-\r<br />Let me know if you find any&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-Credits-\r<br />I would like to thank ProgSys and AndyV on Steam for letting me use the model and textures from their Gmod plugin, also thank you FelioCusland for rigging the mesh for me&#33; Without you guys, this mod wouldn&#39;t be possible.\r<br />I don&#39;t forget, credit also goes to Kigurumi for the sounds used ^^",
