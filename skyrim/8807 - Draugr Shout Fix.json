  "summary": "Fixes the Draugr shouts  so that \\\"Unrelenting Force\\\" actually sends you flying.",
  "descriptionHtml": "It always bugged me that I can launch Draugr across the room but all they could do was make my screen shake a little bit. Considering they\\'re basically the only other enemy in the game that can do dragon shouts, I thought it would be fun to have a challenge against an enemy who has knowledge of the voice. So I decided to make a quick little fix, and figured other people might like this too. Hope you enjoy this mod.",
