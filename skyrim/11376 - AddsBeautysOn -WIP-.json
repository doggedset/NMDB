  "descriptionHtml": "Well, after my Morrowind and Oblivion experience I tried out the Creation Kit to make two lovely ladies that could become both follower and wife. I started this out as a test, though perhaps I’ll work on it next week, we\\'ll see. \r\n\r\nAllison is a vampire & Angel is a bard class. Both are not essential, so they could die if you don\\'t watch out for them. \r\n\r\nThey are located at Proudspire Manor in Solitude. I made them \\\"bound\\\" to the wall as I disliked them walking around ;) \r\n\r\nFor some reason their faces were darker than their body (a bug?) so I decided to make them both a bit darker, but they are still cute as well. Guess they aren’t overpowered, they level with player. Also, they have basic equipment added. It’s nothing great. \r\n\r\nNo other mods were used for this, only the Skyrim basic file. This means only a .esp file is needed to run. \r\n\r\nOne of the pictures you see has navetsea\\'s face mod \\\"Female face retexture\\\" and modified clothes from SKimpy mod by Templar666 activated\r\n\r\nedit: changed the name because it seemed to be a nasty word somewhere on the other side of the world ;) \r\n ",
