  "descriptionHtml": "[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]DESCRIPTION[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />This mod adds an Firearms skill to Skyrim along with perks and its own perk tree. Although not technically dependant on it, this file REQUIRES the main [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56249/?]SCS - Skyrim Custom Skills[/url] files to work. [color=#e06666]Please visit the Main files&#39;s page for details about the mod&#39;s mechanics and installation instructions.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />As of version 2.0, there is also a Lockpicking version which uses the perk tree slot created by &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21792/?]Merged Thievery Skill[/url]&#34; by [b]LukeH.[/b] This version is &#34;standalone&#34; and does NOT need the main SCS file to work. Just download it and make sure it is loaded AFTER the Merged Thievery Skill mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]IMPORTANT UPDATE NOTE[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />If updating to version 2.0, make sure you update to version 2.0 (or higher) of the Main file FIRST - bad things will happen otherwise...\r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]ABOUT FIREARMS[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />I never really liked the idea of having firearms in a medieval fantasy world like Tamriel but playing Risen 2 somewhat shifted my opinion on that matter. Having semi-lore-friendly oldschool muskets and pistols actually expands the atmosphere in new directions. This mod is actually a modifed version of the amazing &#34;Project Flintlock Rifle - Sequel to Musket&#34; mod by Ghosu (link is in the Credits section below if you want the guns without an extra skill to manage them) and it incorporates Mikloud&#39;s take on the Flintlock Pistol.\r<br />After taking a few perks, your firearms should became fairly powerful with the following drawbacks: firstly - the black powder doesn&#39;t appreciate being wet so rain and swimming temporarily cut your firearms damage output by half; secondly - as the knowledge of crafting guns in not present in Tamriel, you will have to craft everything yourself including the black powder (a.k.a. gunpowder), guns and ammunition.\r<br />Speaking of ammunition, each type of firearms has its own types of ammo. However, Skyrim only recognizes two types of ammunition: arrows and bolts. This forced me to create a workaround which works in this manner: if your equipped weapon and equipped ammunition are not recognized as compatible, your combat controls will be disabled until you equip the right combination of weapon and ammo (or unequip the wrong one). Unfortunately, it currently also applies to pistols (although the reasons are a bit different), so if you wield a pistol in one hand and a sword in the other but have no pistol ammo equipped you will NOT be able to swing your sword so be careful. \r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]COMPATIBILITY NOTES[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />To avoid confusion (because there will always be at least 4 up-to-date versions of this mod), the mod comes in a package with some patches for its version. SCS-Firearms3.esp is the main file that you must use.[s] Then we have [color=#00ffff]SCS-Firearms_VanillaPatch.esp[/color] and [color=#00ffff]SCS-Firearms_SkyRePatch.esp[/color] - they fix a slight incompatibility between Firearms and Archery zooming perks. Use the Vanilla one if you use no mods that alter the Archery perk tree, use the SkyRe one if you use Skyre (obviously), if you use another mod that overhauls the Archery perks and tree use NONE and don&#39;t worry about it - nothing too terrible will happen. [/s](Not included and needed since v3.0.)\r<br />[color=#00ffff]SCS-Firearms_KCE.esp[/color], [color=#00ffff]SCS-Firearms-dwrsp.esp[/color] - If you want to take the Firearms experience to a new level, download &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26605/?]SkyRevolution - Assault Rifles_Sniper Rifles and Sub-Machineguns[/url]&#34; by Loshirai14 and/or &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54498/?]Dwarven rifle 2nd Generation[/url]&#34; by [b]mahty [/b]to add some automatic rifles to Skyrim and use this compatibility patches to make it compatible with the Firearms skill. You will need the Dwemer Technology perk to be able to craft Dwemer rifles. The patches are designed to work with the 8.1a &#34;Just 4 Fun Version&#34; of SkyRevolution and version 2.2 of Dwarven rifle 2nd Generation.\r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]PERKS[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />Gunsmith\r<br />Requires: Firearms 0\r<br />You know the basic technological principles of firearms.
