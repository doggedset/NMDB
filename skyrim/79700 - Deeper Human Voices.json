It was always a bit deflating to hear my character go &#34;HyaAAH&#33;&#34; like a pre-pubescent baby Link. Bretons, Imperials, Nords, and Redguards now sound like the hero you&#39;ve always known you were (MAMA WAS RIGHT). Nords & Redguards have Orc default player voice. Bretons & Imperials have High Elf default player voice. Feel free to comment and request other voice defaults (i.e. request for Nords to have default High Elf voice in separate mod version)[/size]\r<br />[u]\r<br />\r<br />[/u][size=3]All player voice sounds have been changed to sound more masculine, including shouts, and your usual combat grunts.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=6][u]Installation:\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/size][size=3]Drag the file into your data folder & enable it in your launcher.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=6][b]Testicmonials[u]:[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Courier New][i]&#34;Is good&#34; ~ Huffington Post[/i][/font]\r<br />[/size][/center]",
