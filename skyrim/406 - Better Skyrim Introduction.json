  "descriptionHtml": "Hello all, thanks for viewing/downloading!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick intro I made thats a couple of seconds long, I just learned a lot of \r\n\r\ntools about video editing today, and did this little mod after studying for several hours \r\n\r\nfor my exam. It felt weird playing an RPG that didnt have its name orientated somewhere \r\n\r\non the main menu or introduction, so I threw this little video file together. It may be \r\n\r\nimproved VASTLY if more people like it as well!\r\n\r\ninstallation:\r\n\r\nSimply extract this folder to your skyrim folder (usually located in C:\\\\Program Files \r\n\r\n(x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\)\r\n\r\nIf you get a prompt to overwrite the EXISTING Betheseda game logo introduction (the \r\n\r\nflashing name), select yes. I have included a backup named original just in case you do \r\n\r\nnot fancy my introduction.\r\n\r\nAnyways, enjoy =)",
