  "summary": "Adds Loki as a follower outside Riverwood with a spare set of Robes and Staff.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a unique follower to Skyrim, based on the Marvel character, Loki , The Asguardian, The Trickster, The God Of Mischief&#33; \r<br />\r<br />This is for Male Only. \r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll find him outside Riverwood. He will level with the player and is a necromancy, he also uses ice spells and has his own perks. \r<br />\r<br />Furthermore, it adds an second set of robes and staff. \r<br />\r<br />*************************************************** \r<br />The Armour: \r<br />Based around the Telvanni robes retextured with the green, gold and black scheme of Loki. It&#39;s unenchanted, and can only be crafted under the leather section of the Sky Forge, and tempered as usual at the workbench. Stat-wise it&#39;s a little stronger than Telvanni Robes. \r<br />Note the set is standalone, and not a replacer of the Telvanni Robes. Although it&#39;s based Loki&#39;s Robes of Marvel, i&#39;ve attempted to make it look more armor based, more in keeping with Skyrim. It&#39;s about as lore-friendly as you can get. \r<br />\r<br />The Weapon - Staff:\r<br />Based on Miraak&#39;s Staff retextured with the Silver, gold and aqua scheme of Loki&#39;s Staff from Avengers Assemble. It&#39;s enchanted with Ice Wall, and can only be crafted under the iron section of the Sky Forge, and tempered as usual at the sharpening wheel. Stat-wise it&#39;s a little stronger than Miraaks&#39;s Staff.\r<br />Note is is standalone, and not a replacer of Miraak&#39;s staff. Although it&#39;s based Loki&#39;s Staff of Marvel, i&#39;ve attempted to make it look more like a weapon from Skyrim. It&#39;s about as lore-friendly as you can get. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />************************************************** \r<br />Compatibility & Troubleshooting \r<br />This mod reqiures Dragonborn DLC.\r<br />\r<br />The armour should not conflict with anything else. \r<br />**************************************************\r<br />\r<br />Installation: \r<br />Simply extract the archive into the Skyrim folder, so the .esp, textures folder, and meshes folder all land into your skyrim/data directory. \r<br />Typically: \r<br />C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim \r<br />\r<br />C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim",
