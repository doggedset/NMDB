Hopefully they should look good enough for the average player.\r<br />\r<br />CONTAINS:\r<br />\r<br />Cultist Robes\r<br />Telvanni Robes\r<br />Temple Priest Robes\r<br />DB Dragon Priest masks\r<br />Skaal amulet\r<br />\r<br />Most are just improved versions of the defaults, although the colouring of the cultist robes has also been modified slightly.\r<br />\r<br />Any feedback is welcome, the mod exists just to slightly improve the visual quality of the DLC",
