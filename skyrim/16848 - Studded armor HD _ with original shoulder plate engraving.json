  "summary": "Just a small modification of Bernabn\\'s mod, to change the shoulder plate so that it looks like vanilla, for those who want to really look like Dovahkiin, in HD!!!",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI loved the work done by Bernabn here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1322\r\n\r\nBut I was so frustrated to have this flat, grey shoulder plate, so far from how Dovahkiin should look like based on the trailers... \r\n\r\nSo I just changed the texture and normal map for the shoulder only. Hope you will enjoy if you, like me, want to have the best \\\"Dovahkiin looking\\\" character :-)\r\n\r\nAll credits go to Bernabn for his amazing texture, done from scratch",
