  "descriptionHtml": "[u]Description[/u]\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a book to the player\\'s inventory called \\\"The Tome of Lesser Cheating\\\". Activating it opens up a menu that lets you quickly acquire some potions of ultimate healing, magicka, or stamina.\r\n\r\nThere\\'s also two non-item cheats for (a) increasing carry weight and (b) enabling/disabling \\\"god mode\\\".\r\n\r\nThis was mostly just a test project for modding using the creation kit. I use these cheats quite a bit and sometimes I don\\'t want to or can\\'t use or can\\'t remember common console commands (and forget that there\\'s a \\\"help\\\" :P). Maybe someone else will find it useful too.\r\n\r\n[u] Installation [/u]\r\n\r\nExtract the 7zip file and put \\\"Tome Of Lesser Cheating.esp\\\" into your Data folder.\r\n\r\n[u] How it was made [/u]\r\n\r\nIt\\'s nothing fancy. It\\'s composed of:\r\n-an in-game book\r\n-a Papyrus script that runs when you open the book that throws up menus, from which you click what items or effects you\\'d like.\r\n-a dummy quest that runs once.\r\n-the script attached to the dummy quest which adds the item to the player\\'s inventory once the quest is initialized\r\n\r\n[u] Source code [/u]\r\n\r\nAvailable on request.\r\nAlso, you can easily see the scripts using the creation kit, and what specific quest and book were modified, but I guess details on what properties were modified in those are difficult to see via the creation kit.",
