  "summary": "A simple texture mod that replaces the default field grass and snow grass object textures with a softer, and more realistic grass texture.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/1820/37506998.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAfter a long time of trial and error in trying to come up with the perfect grass texture to suit my tastes, I have finally succeeded!  \r\nI have tried other grass mods, but I didn\\'t much care for any of them, so I set out to create my own texture.\r\n\r\nSome of the stuff I created in the process was absurd.  Either the colors came out bizarrely, it looked more like shiny green fur rather than actual grass, or the edges got severely clipped off.  So many strange and unusual things happened in the process of inventing the perfect grass, but alas, I have done it!  Grass that is perfect to my own eye!\r\n\r\nI used a custom handmade texture that I crafted in Photoshop, and replaced all of the original fieldgrass dds files with it...and that\\'s it!\r\n\r\nAlthough, if you want it to look like how it does in my pictures, you will need to install some mods and make some Skyrim.ini changes.\r\n\r\n[b]Recommended Mods:[/b]\r\n[i]Not required, but some are highly recommended[/i]\r\n\r\nThe main mod that I used to make the grass denser is [b]\\\"Lush Grass,\\\"[/b] which you can download here: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3288]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3288[/url]\r\n\r\nAnd for ground textures, [b]\\\"Skyrim HD - 2K Textures\\\"[/b] is amazing.  Here is a link to it: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/607]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/607[/url]\r\n\r\nOnce you get that one, you should also download [b]\\\"Benjamin318s Realistic Rocks and Mountains.\\\"[/b]  The colors work very well with this grass texture.  Here is a link to that one:  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27753]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27753[/url]\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, I highly recommend [b]\\\"Wintertide - Fantasy ENB,\\\"[/b] as it makes just about anything look vibrant and beautiful...and just downright amazing!  And here is a link:  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28176]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28176[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, those are just the recommended ones.  If you want an even greater amount of density in your grass, like I have in my screenshots, you should also try the mod, [b]\\\"Grass and Grass\\\"[/b]  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21525]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21525[/url]  \r\n\r\nAlso, in my Skyrim.ini settings I have under \\\"grass\\\"\r\niMinGrassSize=4\r\n\r\nBut I warn you, you must have a really high performance computer to render so much grass!\r\nAlso, if you are on a low end pc, you also might take a small performance hit just from the textures.  So I can say that at least I warned you.  ;)  \r\n\r\nBut anyway, I hope you all enjoy my silly little mod, and I hope it brings as much joy to someone else as it does to me!  :D\r\n\r\n~Steph(Arisen)  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
