  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is preBETA version (BETA close to done). If someone wants to help me with making a questline, please send me a message on the Nexus forum: \r\nhttp://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showtopic=641659&st=\r\n\r\nThis mod adds Stormcloak intelligence base near Riverwood and one castle called Iron Pyke (based on Thy Pyke from Game of Thrones series). Base can be owned by player after completing a complex questline. There is also dungeon to be explored. Quest is not what you would expect. Its based on dialogues and players choices. There is a Dragon that will be your loyal advisor for all game (giving advice about treasure maps, civil war, dragon mounds,...) Also i have an interesting quest planed that will either allow you to capture castle Iron Pyke for Imperials or Stormcloak or maybe if you find a way to rule there under your own banner. I wanted to make a negotiation talks between Imps and Sons, but i dont have it all planed yet.",
