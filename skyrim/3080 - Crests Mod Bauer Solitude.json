  "descriptionHtml": "a while ago i created a mod using my own family coat of arms to re-skin Whiteruns guards (found below)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2722\r\n\r\nand agreed to take requests for others to send me a link to their family crests which i would then use to re-skin guards of a city they choose. this is the guards of Solitude re-skinned to carry the crest of the Bauer Family submitted by dokkka.\r\n\r\nagain and as always, any requests are welcome as i really enjoy texture meddling :)\r\n\r\nhope you enjoy the mod which will hopefully evolve into a large project incorporating many different families.\r\n\r\nCallaghan04",
