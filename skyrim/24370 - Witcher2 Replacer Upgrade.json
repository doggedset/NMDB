  "descriptionHtml": "================\r\nDetails\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis is an add-on intended for Witcher5688\\'s Witcher2 Replace Mod - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22054\r\n\r\nThe above mod, whilst great, does suffer from some technical problems. Noteably, most of the outfits - whilst working fine with NPCs - will crash the game if the player tries to wear them. That is the major issue that I\\'ve tried to fix with this upgrade. So far, the following outfits have been fixed:\r\n\r\nTemerian Light Plate Armour (in use by the Stormcloaks as their base armour)\r\nTemerian Heavy Plate Armour (in use by the Stormcloak generals)\r\nRedanian Light Plate Armour (in use by the Imperial Legion and Solitude Guards)\r\nRedanian Heavy Plate Armour (in use by the Imperial Legion Legates)\r\nOrder of the Flaming Rose Armour (in use by the Penitus Oculatus)\r\nAedirn Light Plate Armour (in use by the Whiterun Guards)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I adjusted the distribution of the Legion armour amongst NPCs (no more Solitude Guards wearing Penitus Oculatus armour).\r\n\r\nThe initial problem was two-fold: the armours were tagged to the wrong biped slots in the Creation Kit and the meshes themselves seemed problematic. I\\'m just guessing, but I think that Witcher5688 took LordofWar\\'s ported meshes and tried to strip them to make them less system-taxing in-game - which was a good idea, but I think something vital was removed along the way. Additionally, the meshes threw up a horrendous number of texture errors in the CK. So I put LordofWar\\'s meshes back in, retextured them with Witcher5688\\'s textures and adjusted the biped slots in the CK by trial and error until I got it right. It was quite a lot of work, so I\\'m not sure how fast I\\'ll be with the rest of the outfits, but I do intend to do them all.\r\n\r\n================\r\nRequirements\r\n================\r\n\r\nWitcher2 Replace Mod by Witcher5688 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22054\r\n\r\nYou must install this, or this upgrade mod will not work.\r\n\r\n================\r\nInstallation\r\n================\r\n\r\nInstall Witcher2 Replace Mod by Witcher5688 first - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22054\r\n\r\nDownload and install my mod with NMM is recommended, or manually extract to your date folder. Confirm any overwrites (it will definitely ask you to overwrite two esps - I thought about patch esps instead but I\\'m not in favour of esp clutter, especially as I\\'m at the 255 limit myself).\r\n\r\n================\r\nInstallation\r\n================\r\n\r\nUninstall via NMM is recommended, as that will automatically restore any files overwritten by this mod.\r\n\r\n================\r\nCredit\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis mod would not have been possible without meshes and textures from:\r\n\r\nWitcher2 Replace Mod by Witcher5688 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22054\r\nThe Witcher 2 Models by LordOfWar - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5588\r\n\r\nand finally, CD Projekt Red - developers of the Witcher 2 who have kindly allowed their meshes and textures to be used in other projects provided they are given credit.",
