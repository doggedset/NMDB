  "modName": "Cosmetic Overhaul Series",
  "summary": "An expanding series of NPC aesthetic improvement mods that incorporate (what I feel) are the best hair, eye, and brow mods available on Nexus and elsewhere.",
  "descriptionHtml": "First there was Supermodel Skyrim, NPC Overhaul, and People of Skyrim, and they were good... but with the passage of time, they&#39;ve become dated.  New hair, eye, and eyebrow resources have been published, and ECE and RaceMenu make fine morphing of faces possible.\r<br />Then there was Babes of Skyrim, and that was a good idea, but I wasn&#39;t very keen on the aesthetics of those mods (and I kinda&#39; disliked the author&#39;s edits of certain NPC inventories).\r<br />So, I did what any dedicated player should do... I started learning how to make my own versions, and for your benefit I&#39;m publishing them here on Nexus.\r<br />(The information on this page is subject to change as I publish more in this series.)\r<br />\r<br />[font=Verdana][color=#ff0000][size=5][b][i]   &#33;&#33;&#33; IMPORTANT INFORMATION &#33;&#33;&#33;[/i][/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />These are not standalone mods - they are dependent on a number of other mods for their resources.  If you attempt to use these mods without their dependent Master mods installed, you may experience CTD, severe graphic abnormalities, and other headaches.\r<br />For these mods to work properly, you will need to download and install the following list of mods.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4][b]Apachii SkyHairs[/b][/size][/color]                      by Apachii\r<br />- v1.6 Full - Download from Nexus at      [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/[/url]\r<br />You&#39;ll also need [color=#ffff00]Apachii Hair Males[/color] v1.2 and [color=#ffff00]Apachii Hair Females[/color] v1.5, available from the same download page.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4][b]Azar Ponytail Hairstyles[/b][/size][/color]      by Azarkiowa\r<br />- v3.0 - Download from Nexus at            [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31797/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31797/[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4][b]The Eyes of Beauty[/b][/size][/color]                by LogRaam\r<br />- v10.0.1 - Download from Nexus at       [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4][b]True Eyes[/b][/size][/color]                                    by JimtownIrish\r<br />- v1.06 - Sadly, JimtownIrish has withdrawn his mods from Nexus.  I&#39;m not sure if he has his own website to distribute them, for now.\r<br />It&#39;s possible to find them elsewhere on the www, but I don&#39;t encourage downloading from any source that the original author hasn&#39;t approved.\r<br />Future releases will include versions without this mod, and alternates that require True Eyes (for those-of-us who downloaded it prior to his departure from Nexus).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4][b]True Brows[/b][/size][/color]                                 by JimtownIrish\r<br />- v1.7 - Sadly, JimtownIrish has withdrawn his mods from Nexus.  The same conditions^ for this mod as for True Eyes.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4][b]SGEyebrows[/b][/size][/color]                               by Hello Santa\r<br />- v1.0 - Download from Nexus at            [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35327/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35327/[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4][b]SG Hairpack 268[/b][/size][/color]                      by Hello Santa\r<br />Not available for download from Nexus (sorry).  Google it to find a download link.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4][b]KS Hairdos - Renewal[/b][/size][/color]            by Kalilies, Shocky, and Stealthic Khaos\r<br />IMPORTANT - You need to use *this* version, and not &#34;KS Hairdos - Final&#34; (available elsewhere on the web).  My overhauls make use of several hairstyles that are *only* available in this version; failing to use this version will give a few NPC&#39;s severe gray-face bug issues.\r<br />- v1.4 - Download from Nexus at            [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />     ---------------\r<br />[b][u][color=#ff7700]General Specs for All Files in this Series[/color][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />THESE MODS ARE DESIGNED FOR USE WITH UNP(B)-TYPE BODY REPLACERS (and they should work with Vanilla as-well).\r<br />Graphic abnormalities (neck-seam issues) may occur if they are used with CBBE or other body-replacers.\r<br />\r<br />TintMasks have been optimized 1024x1024 DTX1 to minimize impact on performance.\r<br />\r<br />Additional requirements for each mod in this series are listed in their description, and in the ReadMe that accompanies each.\r<br />     ---------------\r<br />\r<br />First offering...\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=5][b][u]Skystone Castle Cosmetic Overhaul[/u][/b][/size][/color] \r<br />Based from the great Skystone Castle by SkyrimLazz, and published with his permissions given.\r<br />Check out the screenshots to see what changes it makes. :)\r<br />In addition to the list of cosmetic mods given above, this mod also required Dawnguard, Hearthfires, and Dragonborn (all the DLCs), and you MUST download and install the original &#34;with NPCs&#34; version of Skystone Castle from Lazz&#39; page for the .bsa archive it contains.\r<br />The download package I provide is an edited .esp file which overwrites Lazz&#39; original, and a number of FaceGenData and FaceTint loose files.\r<br />Note: This file was produced on &#34;KS Hairdos - Final&#34;   I&#39;ve checked it against &#34;KS Hairdos - Renewal&#34; (the version available on Nexus) and there are no incompatibilities - I didn&#39;t use any of the hairs that had permissions revoked.\r<br />Download from Nexus at                    [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54703/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54703/[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#bf9000]Watch[/color] [color=#bf9000]this[/color] [color=#bf9000]space[/color] [color=#bf9000]for[/color] [color=#bf9000]further[/color] [color=#bf9000]developments&#33;[/color]\r<br />Coming soon...
