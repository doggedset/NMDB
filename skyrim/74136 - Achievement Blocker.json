  "descriptionHtml": "I saw a request for such a thing and couldn&#39;t find a fully featured one. Figured it to be easy enough to do so I gave it a shot. This should do what JustinOther&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8057/?]Achievement Remover[/url] does, but it should cover DLC achievements as well. Seems he was going to wait forÂ [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19556/?]Nitpick[/url] to cover those, but that never happened.\r<br />\r<br />With the included script file in your Data folder, the game will no longer grant you any achievements. This won&#39;t undo any achievements you&#39;ve already unlocked, but it&#39;ll prevent you from gaining more. Note that removing the script file will NOT retroactively grant achievements you missed, either (though the game should start giving you new achievements again), and some can be missed permanently (unless you reload an old save or start a new character or something). The achievements you didn&#39;t get are still recorded in your Papyrus logs, if enabled - look for &#34;Sort-of earned achievement xx&#34; if you care.\r<br />\r<br />For the opposite of what this does (eg if you later change your mind), try [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16378/?]Achievements Unlocked Legendary Edition[/url].",
