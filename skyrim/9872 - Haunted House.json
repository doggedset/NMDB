The house, best suited for evil Mages and/or Vampires, is a fairly modest one room building. However, it has a semi-large basement complete with a friendly ghost and alternate exit to skyrim, among many other things.\r\n\r\nNote: To preserve the ambiance of the house, I suggest not using torches or magelight, and instead turn up the brightness if you can\\'t see good enough. If enough people complain about it I\\'ll up the ambient lighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b] Features[/b]\r\n ======[/center]\r\n Nav-Meshing for followers\r\n Hours of playtesting for errors\r\n Cleaned esp\r\n 1 room house, 2 room basement \r\n 9 non-respawning containers, including one at each entrance\r\n 2 thrones\r\n 4 beds (1 is a coffin with a bedroll in it, temporary spot for vamps.)\r\n Custom Shrine with all new buff (Regenerate Magicka 15% faster for 8 hours)\r\n Weapon Plaque (More later?)\r\n Shield Plaques (In the upper center of the mural by the thrones, you\\'ll see dark circles; those are the shield plaques.)\r\n Enchanting, Potionmaking and Smithing equipment included\r\n Custom Imagespace for a unique setting\r\n Friendly Ghost (basement area)\r\n Cattle NPC which sleeps 24/7\r\n Friendly small Frostbite Spider (main house)\r\n Frostbite Spiders on walls, ceilings\r\nRespawning goodies including potions and ingredients, but not overkill I hope\r\n Semi-hidden, respawning Treasure!\r\n Dragons can land on the house in combat\r\n And more!\r\n\r\n\r\n [center][b]Location[/b]\r\n ========[/center]\r\n To get to the house: \r\nQuick way: Fast Travel there; discovering the house beforehand is not necessary. Look south and a little east of riften on your world map, near the south border, for the travel icon. \r\nLong way: Head to the Shadow Stone from the south gate of Riften. From the Shadow Stone, head south, until you see a dragon burial mound slightly to the east. Pass the mound, and keep going straight until you see the house.\r\n\r\n[center][b] To-Do List (WIP) [/b]\r\n=========[/center]\r\nMake a quest to obtain the house\r\nAdd more ghosts, quest related\r\nAdd more scary things both inside and out\r\nAdd a chopping block outside\r\nReplace the \\\"bedroll-in-a-coffin-bed\\\" with a \\\"justa-coffin-bed\\\" (done)\r\nReduce the footstep volume of the Small Frostbite Spider (If possible within the editor)\r\nI\\'m sure there\\'s more...\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b] History[/b]\r\n =======[/center]\r\n 1.1: Fixed Nav-Meshes (Including Cattle not sleeping), fixed a couple placement errors, increased Altar buff magnitude, moved altar to cellar (in the room with skeletons), MOVED THE LOCATION OF THE EXTERIOR TRAPDOOR to a logical location, just leave the cellar to the outside to see where it\\'s at now.\r\n 1.0: Initial (non-beta) release\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b] Known Bugs[/b]\r\n ==========[/center]\r\n None that I know of.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b] Compatibility[/b]\r\n ============[/center]\r\nCompatible with all mods that do not alter the worldspace cells (43, -31) and (44, -31). If you do not know what that means, then don\\'t worry about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b] Install[/b]\r\n =======[/center]\r\n 1. Copy the files to \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n 2. Start your Skyrim Launcher, click \\'Data Files\\', place a checkmark beside the .esp file.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b] Uninstall[/b]\r\n =========[/center]\r\n Untick the ESP from your data files. Delete the ESP if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b] Credits[/b]\r\n =======[/center]\r\n Long live Bethesda!
