  "summary": "Tigress Rubee is follower and marriage candidate. She is also standalone so yay!",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod ever. So forgive me for the bugs you may trip on. \r\nI didn\\'t like the fact Skyrim has a lot of companion mods but they are always humanoid. My frustration with the xenophobic tendency of companion modders has led me to creating a stand-alone companion. \r\n\r\nRubee is a follower and marriage candidate. She is Auto-levelled with your character and whose skills lies within archery and I have given her some archery and sneaking perks to support that. This mod has adult content because she has no clothes on in-game so you can make her wear anything. \r\n\r\nYou may be surprised the first time you hear her talk like Lydia (just less rude lol) because female Khajiit voice has no follower and marriage dialouge. Story I made up for this is she has excellent speech mimmicking skills.\r\n\r\nYou can find her at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun or if she\\'s not there, press the \\\"~\\\" or \\\"`\\\" key and type in console \\\"help Rubee\\\" With the given code type \\\"player.placeatme npccodehere\\\" This companion was made with the Skyrim NPC editor so location placement was a bit shoddy. \r\n\r\nAnywho, have fun with her :) If you find any problem, just dump something on the comment section and I\\'ll try to answer back. \r\n\r\nOh yeah and... \r\nPLEASE ENDORSE!\r\n",
