  "modName": "Dark Brotherhood Extended Bedroom",
  "summary": "Expanded version of the master bedroom in Dawnstar Sanctuary. \r\nAdded alchemy lab, enchanting table, more chests and a living manikin. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "After completing the Dark Brotherhood quest line you get your own sanctuary in Dawnstar with a personal room, chest, mannequin, bed, etc.\r\nI personally loved the whole quest line and the sanctuary felt like home to me. But it lacked quite a few things, like enchanter table, enough chests and... that\\'s about it. Well it felt empty so I decided I\\'d stuff it with items.\r\n\r\nThis was my first attempt at modding for skyrim, so I added a bunch of chests, enchanter table, alchemy table, some other items, moved the table around and made the room generally look more filled and more \\\"alive\\\". Also due to me screwing up or something the mannequin is alive.. He watches you as you walk around the room. I found it kinda creepy, but when you equip something on him the issue is fixed.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally the safe located near the bed is locked with a key. The abandoned shack key is the one used. If you complete the main quest line you should have the key by the time you get to the safe itself.\r\n\r\nI had plans on adding smelter, anvil, etc in case anyone wants me to improve the mod.\r\n\r\nTo install just plug the \\\".esp\\\" file into your Data folder.\r\nOn windows 7 default is - C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nEnjoy.",
