  "descriptionHtml": "Hello denizens of the world wide web. I return shortly to give you a mod I made long after the Dwemer Coin, I didn\\\\\\'t upload it because I actually forgot about it until recently.\r\n\r\nThis adds 5 Ayleid Coins into Skyrim, and are much harder to find. But I shall not leave you hanging and end up missing or losing them so here are the 5 locations where you may find the coins.\r\n1. In Darklight Tower.\r\n2. In the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary of Falkreath.\r\n3. Deep in the Midden.\r\n4. In the Thalmor Embassy\r\n5. Found in the pockets of one Thieves Guild member.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS: Current version of Skyrim.\r\nCREDITS: Meshes and Textures were made by InsanitySorrow.",
