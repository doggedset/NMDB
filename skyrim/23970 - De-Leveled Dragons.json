Well then this mod is for you: this de-levels dragons but doesn\\'t do it randomly, you can fight a legendary dragon at level 10 but the chance of that hapening is small, but it raises with your level.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nLevel/Dragon| Dragon | Blood | Frost | Elder| Ancient | Revenant | Legendary |\r\n        1-17     |      5%     |   35%  |  25%  | 15%  |     10%   |       5%     |       5%     |\r\n        17-26   |      5%      |    5%  |  35%  | 25%  |     15%   |       10%    |       5%     |\r\n        27-35   |      5%      |    5%  |  5%    | 35% |      25%  |       15%     |     10%    |\r\n        36-44   |      5%      |    5%  |  5%    | 10% |      35%  |       25%    |       15%    |\r\n        45-58   |      0%     |    5%   |   5%   | 10% |     25%   |       40%    |       15%    |\r\n        59-77   |      0%     |    0%   | 5%     | 10% |     15%   |       25%    |       45%    |\r\n         >77    |      0%     |    0%    | 0%    | 10% |     15%   |       25%    |       50%    |\r\nVersion History:\r\n\r\n1.0 Initial Release\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues and Compatability:\r\n\r\nNone that i know but if u use a mod that changes dragons leveled list remember: the last loaded is the one that is used so if u wnat to use this load it last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Plans:\r\n \r\nProbably make a version that doesn\\'t need Dawnguard, maybe a hard and hardcore version that spawns 2 and 3 tier above player level, other than that sugestions are acepted",
