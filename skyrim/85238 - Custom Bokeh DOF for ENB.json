  "descriptionHtml": "Custom Depth of Field with Bokeh effect I tweaked for Snapdragon Prime ENB should work with most ENB&#39;s out there.\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />Just a custom Depth of Field with a stonger Bokeh effect for Snapdragon Prime ENB which makes for artsy screens and even playthrough. \r<br />Goal was a noticable DOF with Bokeh but not too intrusive to gameplay since I actually play the game with it on. Distance blur was pushed back a bit so it doesn&#39;t look like you need glasses... \r<br />Specifics:\r<br />Focus area is clear but surrounding areas that are unimportant get a subtle blur. Very far objects get the Bokeh effect. (The effect is more noticeable at night) So if you want pics like some of the screens with strong Bokeh just slightly move your focus point to the side(literally move the mouse a bit) and you will get it. Just need something in the background to see it like tree leaves or stars or glowing mushrooms,basically something that contrasts the background. I honestly forget its there but smile once in a while when I carelessly camera angle just right and activate it. Btw as you sprint on horse or foot, the distant blur will still move back so your not running blind.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />1. [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]Skyrim Script Extender(SKSE)[/url] (for iHUD)\r<br />2.
