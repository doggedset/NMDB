The meshes are not mine I merely put them together while learning how to work in Blender. So, it would be wonderful, if you could stop by the original mods&#39; pages (see credits section) to say &#39;thank you&#39; to the authors of those wonderful mods, whose work I have used.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds 6 dresses, 5 fans and 5 pairs of shoes to be sold at Radiant Raiment shop in Solitude.\r<br />There is also a replacer version for vanilla wedding outfit available in the Optional Files section. \r<br />\r<br />The dress mesh is originally meant for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12694//?]E55 body[/url], but it will work with any body that uses vanilla UVs - Vanilla body, CBBE, UNP and so on. The sandals are made for standard [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3666//?]Phygit fem feet[/url], meaning that they will work for most body replacers as well. \r<br />\r<br />Future plans: \r<br />- to add  new wedding wreath mesh and E55 version of the sandals.\r<br />- to add more texture variants to the standalone version of the mod.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]82OQbaT9rTw[/youtube][/center]\r<br />[center]Video by [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/6247421/?]dptheslothking[/url][/center]\r<br />[center][/center]\r<br />[center][size=+3][b][color=#E4D6B9]How to get it in game:[/color][/b][/size][/center]\r<br />All the items are sold at Radiant Raiment shop in Solitude. Beware that fans are actually are armor pieces (fan-shield) and therefore you have to have a Merchant perk in the Speech tree to be able to buy them in Radiant Raiment.\r<br />If you have conflicting mod installed and the items do not appear in Radiant Raiment inventory you can still get them with the console commands:\r<br />Open console by pressing &#34;~&#34; key and type:\r<br />[color=#B22222]help &#34;Noble&#34;[/color] including the quotation marks and hit Enter. You will see the ID codes of the items. To get them use the following console command:\r<br />[color=#B22222]player.additem [itemID] [quantity][/color] without brackets.\r<br />\r<br />Wedding Dress REPLACER version:\r<br />Either make Dark Brotherhood quest [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bound_Until_Death]Bound Until Death[/url], or use the console commands:\r<br />\r<br />Enter the console by pressing ~ key and type:\r<br />player.additem 00088956 01 and hit enter\r<br />The dress then will be then added to your inventory.\r<br />AND\r<br />player.additem 00088958 01 and hit enter \r<br />Wedding Sandals will be added to your inventory.\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=+3][b][color=#E4D6B9]Bugs and Incompatibilities:[/color][/b][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />- Clipping and stretching of the meshes, which can become even more obvious if the character is using non vanilla animations or poses.\r<br />\r<br />-The white color of the dress sometimes gets very bright in certain lighting conditions or when used with super bright ENB mods. \r<br />\r<br />- Sleeves in the first person do not hold on the different textures that I have assigned to them. Trying to figure out what the problem is right now. If anyone knows the solution - please let me know in comments.\r<br />\r<br />-Standalone version of the mod can conflict with any other mod that changes Radiant Raiment shop inventory. As a result you will not see the dresses for sale in the shop. You can change your load order and load my mod after the mod that causes conflict, or you can use console commands to get the items in game. Please refer to How To Get It in game section for console commands. \r<br />\r<br />- Wedding dress REPLACER version is incompatible with any other mods that alter Skyrim&#39;s Vanilla Wedding dress meshes.\r<br />It should be fully compatible with NPC&#39;s clothes  texture overhauls, even if they alter wedding dress textures, the meshes in my mod have their own textures and don&#39;t use the vanilla ones.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=+3][b][color=#E4D6B9]Installation and uninstallation instructions:[/color][/b][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Make your life easy and use NMM&#33; [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/modmanager//?]Get Nexus Mod Manager here[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Manual Installation:\r<br />1.
