  "descriptionHtml": "200 Years ago, there was a female Khajiit slave named Abanji who lived in the slaveyards near Vvardenfall&#39;s Morag Mar. One day, she met a courageous freed slave who eventually became known as the Nerevarine. This encounter left her inspired to fight for her freedom which she accomplished by rallying up her fellow slaves and overtaking their captors while they slept, in what became to be known locally as &#34;The Redmarket Massacre.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Soon after, Abanji was a free Khajiit who lead a small group of stealthy sellswords, mostly comprised of the slaves who survived that night. They called themselves the Sleep Keepers and found their success in taking righteous jobs all over Nirn. Allegedly, they still exist to this day. \r<br />\r<br />Many generations later, a direct descendant of Abanji named Abanjo is sent by the Keepers to pay respects to an old family friend named Eorlund Gray-mane and deliver a payment to him for a previous shipment of legendary Skyforge weapons. While there, Abanjo meets you and that is where his story truly starts..\r<br />____\r<br />Location: He can be found at the Skyforge in Whiterun.\r<br />____\r<br />VOTE for the next DRAGONONION follower at the link below&#33;\r<br />\r<br />http://theperfectonion.weebly.com/vote-for-the-next-onion.html \r<br />____\r<br />Credits/Mods used/Mods in screenshots:\r<br />- Creation Kit\r<br />\r<br />by: THEDRAGONONION",
