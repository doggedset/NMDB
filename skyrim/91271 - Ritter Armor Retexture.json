All I did was retexture, you still need to download the original here --&gt; http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13638\n<br />\n<br />I think you also need CBBE. It might not work with the vanilla body.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Please post screenshots! I'd love to see what they look like in your game :D\n<br />(Yes, my character has eyebrows. The helmet hides them.) \n<br />[/b][/center][/font]",
