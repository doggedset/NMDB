  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red]REQUIRES[/color] [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9959]Lorecraft v4.1[/url]\r\n[color=red]REQUIRES[/color] [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3656551]Original files and assets of any of hothtrooper44\\'s armor mods[/url]\r\n\r\n[b][u]UPDATES[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[u]Just a note[/u]\r\nI want to make a plugin for [b]Immersive Armours[/b] and the new armors from hothtrooper, but Lorecraft has issues right now with patch 1.6, so anything I make is probably going to be incompatible. I\\'m going to wait for Arcanesmith to update Lorecraft to Skyrim v1.6 before I make any updates. Sorry for the inconvenience but I don\\'t want to make a plugin that might cause errors for you guys on 1.6\r\n\r\n[u]v1.2[/u]\r\n- The \\'all armor\\' plugin completely discontinued. It\\'s too unstable, and there were multiple duplicate FormIDs problems with combining all the hothtrooper armors together as some were modified duplicates of each other. There was just no way to have them being nice all together without major rewriting of some parts of each mod each time I open the CK.\r\n\r\nAnd even then no guarantees it was going to be stable. Some scripts like on Vanguard would break and take a long time I don\\'t have to fix as hothtrooper continues adding armors.\r\n\r\n- Complete replacer .esps for older hothtrooper armors that aren\\'t likely to get updated and are in \\'final\\' form. This is would hopefully solve:\r\n\r\nA) Limited load order issues as less .esps to load!\r\n\r\nB) FormID and scripting issues as the .esps are kept in their \\'original\\' forms. I\\'m still not sure what happens if some of the older armors with the same FormIDs are installed together, but since noone has complained about the original mods being installed together on hothtrooper\\'s mod pages, I\\'m going to assume they will work.\r\n\r\nNewer armors (currently Akaviri and Dragonhide) are still being kept as plugins using the original .esps as Masters; as there\\'s still a high chance hothtrooper would update them or add things to them. \r\n\r\nOverall also the re-write was necessary to update properly v4.1 Lorecraft, with better sorting, better artwork on the books etc.\r\n\r\nYour recipes should remain if you have learned them already, but use the console to get back the new books.\r\n\r\nBaratheon has a new Shield book, and Vagabond has now separate books for the Red accented and Grey accented versions. Otherwise, the books are still the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center]------------------------------------------------------------------------[/center]\r\n[b][u]FEATURES[/u][/b]\r\nLorecraft plugins made for Lorecraft v4.1 and for the latest versions (as of upload date) of hothtrooper44\\'s amazing armor mods.\r\n\r\nYou must install specific plugins for each of the armors you want to use.\r\n\r\n[b][u]INSTALLATION[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n1) Pick which of the armors you want\r\n2) Install them normally with all their assets in the data folder\r\n3) Install specific Lorecraft plugins for each of them\r\n4) [b]OVERWRITE[/b] the original .esp with the Lorecraft version OR for [u]Dragonhide[/u] and [u]Akaviri Samurai[/u], load them after the original .esps\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease inform me of any error like wrong models etc. Note that hothtrooper44 didn\\'t give all the armors proper inventory models so if those look warped, they were in the original download. Just make sure the crafted models are correct!\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]CREDITS[/u][/b]\r\nArcaneSmith for the awesome Lorecraft plugin system!\r\nhothtrooper44 for his amazing armor mods and giving me permission to make a Lorecraft plugin for them!",
