  "summary": "This mod adds Disney&#39;s the Little Mermaid into the game. With a few dialogue options that play dialogue from the movie, including singing&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "Long story short, the mod adds Ariel to the Inn in Riverwood.  She has a few lines from the movie, is a follower, essential, levels with the player ect... She doesn&#39;t have custom dialogue for normal options, such as &#34;It&#39;s time we part ways&#34;. If this mod is popular or if I get enough requests, I&#39;ll add some more dialogue.  This is my first mod so don&#39;t expect too much out of me. Let me know if there are any problems.",
