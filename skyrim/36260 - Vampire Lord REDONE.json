  "summary": "Harkons Vampire Lord Armor and Cape! Stronger Blood Magic scaling with your level and destruction skill! No more weakness due to Serana!",
  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATES\r\n-Fixed an issue where the red cape would not appear due to the Script missing. If you already\r\ndownloaded this mod please get the newer version and add the Script folder to your Data folder.\r\n-Added casual version that has weaker spells that cost less magicka.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IT DOES\r\n\r\nThis mod aims to make the Vampire Lord look better and be of more use especially on higher levels where high difficulty levels are required which make the vanilla lord totally useless compared to crafted stuff.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n-Harkons Royal Armor and cape attached to the Vampire Lord\r\n\r\n-Bloodbomb got stronger but also more intensive on Magicka \r\n\r\n-Bloodbomb belongs to the school of destruction which allows you to\r\n increase skill and level using the Vampire Lord and which makes the casting\r\n cost dependand on skill and perks\r\n\r\n-Magicka absorption got more important to prevent running out of magicka.\r\n Now the Bloodstone Chalice is good for something\r\n\r\n-Vampire Lord is now playable with Serana as companion as I deleted the condition\r\n that weakens the Bloodbomb when she is there\r\n\r\n-Keep up with the strongest enemies on highest levels even on Legendary Difficulty.\r\n However being master of destruction is important to wield the strongest Vampire Lord perfectly.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nSimply drop the data file in your skyrim folder and tell your windows to integrate the file in the existing data file. Make sure that Dawnguard.esm is the second master file in your load order, so do not load hearthfire or dragonborn before dawnguard, else the game won\\'t find the correct IDs.\r\nIn case you do not want to have all features of this mod just delete the corresponding files. The files contained in the meshes folder are responsible for Harkons armor while the capeequip.pex script is responsible for the cape to appear and the esp does the gameplay changes. The mods are not dependend on  each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL\r\n\r\nDelete data/meshes/actors/vampirelord/charater assets/skeleton.nif + vampirelordarmor.nif\r\nDelete data/Scripts/capeequip.pex\r\nDelete data/Vampirelord.esp\r\nENJOY!!",
