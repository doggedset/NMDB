  "descriptionHtml": "Just sleep adds some more immersive effects to sleeping and to the lack of it. \r<br />\r<br />There are five stages of tiredness: \r<br />\r<br />Well Rested - Skill improve 10% faster. \r<br />Content - No Effect \r<br />Tired - Skill improve 25% slower, carry weight -30. \r<br />Very Tired - Skills improve 50% slower, carry weight -60, movement speed -20%. \r<br />Exhausted - Skills improve 75% slower, carry weight -90, movement speed - 30%. \r<br />\r<br />You get a notification when the stages change, and you can see your current stage in your active effects menu.\r<br />For stages tired through exhausted there&#39;s also an optional screen effect, getting progressively harsher on each stage. The chance for these can be changed through the configuration menu, or be disabled completely.\r<br />\r<br />The way it works is by having tiredness points, and those accumulate automatically as time passes and decrease while sleeping. The points go from 0 to 140, where 0 is fully rested. The stages start at: \r<br />\r<br />0 - Well Rested \r<br />25 - Content \r<br />45 - Tired \r<br />65 - Very tired \r<br />90 - Exhausted \r<br />\r<br />By default you get 4 points per hour, which means going from fully rested (0) to tired (45) takes just over 11 game hours. Recovery rate is almost double the exhaustion rate, so you don&#39;t need to sleep as long as it takes to get tired. \r<br />\r<br />You can change the exhaustion and recovery rates through the MCM menu.\r<br />Or, the exhaustion rate can also be changed through console:\r<br />set JS_ExhaustionRate to 4\r<br />where 4 is the default rate of 4 points per hour in this case.\r<br />\r<br />Versions 1.1 and up require SkyUI and SKSE.\r<br />Version 1.0 doesn&#39;t have the MCM menu and works without either, and will stay available alongside newer versions. You can still use the console command to change the exhaustion rate with it.\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------- \r<br />\r<br />I recommend getting Realistic needs and diseases instead if you want to have hunger as well in your game. I preferred to just have the sleep effects, so I made this mod instead, though the sleep effects are pretty much the same.\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------- \r<br />\r<br />My other mods:\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43153/?]Rotating Quicksave[/url] - multiple per character quicksaves\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16810/?]Ruined Prison[/url] - A new dungeon in the Reach",
