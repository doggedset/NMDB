Hooray for me!\r\n\r\nBetter detail pics via images link.\r\n\r\nObviously it should go without saying that this is not a lore-friendly retex.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, there appears to be a mistake in the Nightingale Bow texture making the bowstring wrap off center.  I\\'ve compared with the original files, and it is the same.  This is beyond my ability to fix.\r\n\r\nI personally can live with it being off center, but if anyone would like to take a crack at getting it fixed, please be my guest.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy the file, please endorse.",
