  "descriptionHtml": "Armor Perk Overhaul ~ For Mixing Light and Heavy Armors\r\n===================================================\r\nThis mod removes the \\\"full set\\\" requirements from armor perks that require them and changes \\\"matching set\\\" to \\\"full set.\\\"  Having a matching set no longer matters, while the old Matching Set perks now give a bonus for wearing a full set of only Light Armor or only Heavy Armor.  Their names have been changed to Skirmisher and Marauder respectively.\r\n\r\nThis is for players like myself who got pretty used to mixing light and heavy armor for the dual skill leveling acquired in Oblivion or don\\'t want to get heavily penalized for wearing some clothes or not wearing a helmet, etc.\r\n\r\nThis mod only changes the in-game name and effects of preexisting perks so it should be compatible with any mods that don\\'t alter those same perks.",
