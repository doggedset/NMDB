  "descriptionHtml": "The Shadowmarks have always annoyed me in Skyrim. They constantly looked like they were stuck on with glue or something, rather than scratched into the wall. This mod attempts to remedy this.\r\n\r\nPart one of the mod fixes the normal maps so they portray light and shadows better. I tried to decrease the reflectivity as best as I could.\r\n\r\nStill needing to fix:\r\nMake them look more \\'scratched\\' onto the wall, rather than a crappy overlay. I cannot make the texture transparent because the normal map will no longer show. Any tips on how to achieve this?",
