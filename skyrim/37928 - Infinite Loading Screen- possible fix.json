  "descriptionHtml": "After a full two months of completely modding my Skyrim to make it perfect, I was forced to re-install the game 5 times. Why? Because I continued to get the dreaded Infinite load screen, ctd, and freezing. Even after checking all 200 of my mods for compatibility and cleaning.\r\n\r\nI have reduced my mods since then from 200 to 70. Still no change.\r\nUntil***** FIX\r\n\r\nI decided to randomly take off/unplug the three \\\"HighResTexturePack.esp\\\"\r\nI then started Skyrim and attempted to load my unloadable game.\r\nNO INFINITE LOADING :D\r\n\r\nnote- My guess is that conflicting texture packs or the memory that is taken up so quickly keeps large areas from being loaded properly.
