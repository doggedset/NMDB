Can it be? 0.0\r<br />\r<br />- For when the corpses of your fallen foes aren&#39;t adequate company on your lonely nights out\r<br />- got a moment? check out my &#34;Finding Nemo&#34; [pun intended] article in the &#34;Articles&#34; Tab\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/2vRBtZH.png[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/ouYoKxb.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />Add variety to your killing spree&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This is a weapon pack I threw together because I was bored and I felt it was time to contribute to this great community. Inside you&#39;ll find new weapons, a set of armor, and a fancy new shield - all of &#39;em bright and shiny and Dual Sheath Redux Compatible to boot.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/mzfLf90.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />[u]Pravus:[/u] - wielded by the sensual [redacted], this is a sexy sword with a sexy purpose. Pravus is latin - it means Depraved. Through the grace of the divines a soul even in the depths of depravity may find a thief&#39;s virtue. I know it isn&#39;t much consolation after those damn pickpockets lift your last septim, but at least with Pravus you stand a chance retrieving it no?\r<br />tl;dr - pointy end goes in, enemy&#39;s lights go out.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/MZHjiH1.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />[u]Impunitas:[/u] - A deadly blade used by a deadly Dunmer. Called by many names, Nemo &#34;the Red Devil&#34; Hlaalu makes use of a blade very much suited to its master&#39;s macabre occupations. Also like its master, the blade eloquently captures the razor edge between the path of impunity and that of damnation. Impunitas has been many an unfortunate soul&#39;s final repentance.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/AUn3R6Q.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />All you need is a current version of Skyrim, barring that, a nice hot cup of tea - who doesn&#39;t like tea? (or coffee, for those of you who like to live life dangerously)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/LSry5g2.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />[u]Manually:[/u] copy files to your Skyrim Directory.\r<br />\r<br />Put the &#39;001RR_WeaponPack.esp&#39; in the same folder as the Skyrim .bsa files and .esm files (ie: Skyrim.bsm, Skyrim - animations.bsa etc. etc.)\r<br />\r<br />merge my &#39;data&#39; folder with the existing one, unless updating you shouldn&#39;t be prompted to overwrite.\r<br />\t\t\r<br />Folder Hierarchy:\r<br />Skyrim\r<br />001RR_WeaponPack.esp\r<br />\r<br />Data\r<br />Meshes\r<br />001RR_...\r<br />\r<br />Textures\r<br />001RR_...\r<br />\r<br />[u]via NMM:[/u] just click download and activate it once it&#39;s finished. Easy right?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/rNcMLrT.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />1) ALWAYS make a clean save when uninstalling - make a save (not a quicksave/autosave), uninstall the mod, load save (it&#39;ll give a missing content warning - ignore it), save again.\r<br />*it&#39;s also a good idea to back up your saves folder once in a while (it&#39;s in your &#34;my directoriesmydocuments&#34; folder)\r<br />\r<br />2)[u]Manually:[/u] Those files up there? ya, get rid of &#39;em xD\r<br />I&#39;ve prefixed all the assets of this mod with &#39;001RR_...&#39;, so it&#39;s safe to delete anything in there.\r<br />\t\t\t\r<br />**Do not EVER delete any skyrim assets - anything that isn&#39;t either in a folder marked &#34;001RR_...&#34; or that doesn&#39;t start with &#34;001RR_...&#34;\r<br />\t(if you already did - y&#39;know, right after I told you not to - google &#34;Steam Verify Game Cache&#34;)\r<br />\t\t\t\t\t\t\r<br />[u]Via NMM[/u]: double click the mod to deactivate it (this will uninstall the files, but keeps the zipped folder on your harddrive)\r<br />\r<br />**if you want to permanently get rid of it, press delete or go to the big red button that says &#34;delete selected mod.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/QNbBbfg.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />Should be compatible with all other mods - I&#39;m just throwing some more meshes in. I haven&#39;t edited Leveled lists or any other existing forms.\r<br />That being said there is always a possibility that I missed something or mucked up; if you find a problem let me know&#33;\r<br />\r<br />** some of my meshes have rather high polycounts - looking at you Rapier -.-\r<br /> while not exactly professional (working on it&#33;) it could lead to performance losses if you try rendering 5000 of them on screen at once... \r<br />ya don&#39;t do that...\r<br />\r<br />IMHO: it shouldn&#39;t be a problem, I&#39;m running skyrim with 90+ mods on a laptop with 6gb of RAM, Intel Integrated HDGraphics 4000 (intel core i3 processor, no dedicated graphics card) @ 2.40ghz, and it has yet to burst into flames (knock on wood)&#33;\r<br />\t\r<br />PS. I&#39;ll be updating this pack as time permits - I&#39;ve got a lot more meshes lying around&#33; If you have anything you particularly want to see in game feel free to post your request and I&#39;ll give it my best shot&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/oYLaZft.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />Don&#39;t use it to make money, don&#39;t pass it off as your own, don&#39;t put it on steamworks (or anywhere else for that matter), don&#39;t forget to eat 3 balanced meals a day.\r<br />\t\t\r<br />DO use it in your own mods (please don&#39;t forget to credit me and all original mod authors + give us a heads up first&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />DO retexture it, play around with it, see how it works - If you&#39;ve got questions I&#39;ll see if I can help&#33;\r<br />\r<br />DO have fun with it&#33; I&#39;m releasing it because I had fun making and playing it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/ZM0ZEJ9.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />I made the meshes myself - sometimes referring to others floating around the web for scale and/or inspiration - but all made from scratch using coffee and Maya 2012.\r<br />Unless otherwise stated, textures are either my own or modified Bethesda resources.\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda definitely gets top spot here&#33; Thanks for the great game and great tools&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Neovalen for his work on Dual Sheath Redux\r<br />[url= http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34155//?] Get it Here&#33; [/url]\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve decided that I can&#39;t do any better than Mr.Dave&#39;s Feather Textures so credits go to him:\r<br />[url= http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2324/?] Link for the Lazy [/url]\r<br />\t\t\r<br />Credits also go to TrebTreb for his work on the custom sigils pack, which makes it super easy to get custom shields in game:\r<br />[url= http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21037//?] woah so many links [/url]\r<br />\r<br />Credits also go to L0rd0fWar for his work in porting over the Witcher 2 Models:\r<br />[url= http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5588//?] last but not least [/url]\r<br />[/font]",
