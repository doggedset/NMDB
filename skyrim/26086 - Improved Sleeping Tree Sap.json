  "summary": "Increases Sleeping Tree Sap&#39;s effect duration to 20 minutes and removes the slow effect",
  "descriptionHtml": "A very simple mod that changes the duration of sleeping tree sap from 45 seconds to 20 minutes. Now your character can go on sleeping tree sap trips instead of just getting a brief high. Also removes the slow effect and instead reduces your stamina regeneration by 95%. Hope you have the respite perk.\r<br />\r<br />This is the only thing the mod changes so you might as well put it last in your load order. Enjoy.",
