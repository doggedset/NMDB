  "descriptionHtml": "This is a batch file I created in order to test a shouts mod I was working on.\r\n\r\nInstallation is very simple:\r\n\r\n1. unzip the archive\r\n\r\n2. copy addallshouts.txt to your Skyrim folder (not the Data folder, but the folder where TESV.exe is located)\r\n\r\n3. when you are in-game, open console command and type \r\n\r\nbat addallshouts\r\n\r\nNote that this adds Soul Tear and Drain Vitality if you have Dawnguard installed, but even if you don\\'t have the DLC, it still adds all the other shouts.
