  "descriptionHtml": "[size=\\\"5\\\"][b][u]Minor Update! 0.15![/u][/b][/size]\r\n[u]Whats new?[/u] \r\nAdded 20~ textures, removed some of the not working/useless tiles. \r\nRedrew whroughgroundmud.dds (muddy windhelm ground) in an effort to reduce repitition. \r\nSome cave textures have been tiled. \r\n\r\n[u]What next?[/u]\r\nFixing normal maps so the new tiled textures reflect light/glow correctly \r\nMore tiled landscape textures (currently only 1 as of 0.15) \r\nExpect more cities & dungeons/caves. \r\n\r\n[u]Comment[/u]\r\nWith this update, it\\'s most of windhelm done IMO, I will have to have a proper look at the stone trims and pillars. Might attempt some of the stone steps. \r\n_______________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nThe textures in Whitehelm are seriously stretched, so I thought i\\'d fix it a little. Being not so skilled in drawing textures and thinking that resizes look like ass, I took some of the textures that are easily tileable and tiled them. So instead of a 512x512 texture being stretched over a large area, you have a larger texture of the same quality not as stretched over that large area. However by doing it this way parts will repeat and this is visible in the muddy ground texture.  \r\n\r\nThe main improvements you will see is to the grounds, there are other areas i would have loved to have updated but i do not have the skills to do so. \r\n\r\nInstallation: Just extract the contents of the rar into Skyrim/Data/",
