  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple mod which redecorates the whiterun house called breezehome to be more spacious and noble. \r\n\r\n-It doesn\\'t add billions of ugly rooms like other mods, it keeps the same shape and doesn\\'t alter the exterior \r\n-it now has correct house upgrades.( when you buy them from the steward.) \r\n-doesn\\'t look glitchy with no upgrades \r\n-each upgrade works perfect. \r\n-different dining room to make it seem more spacious. \r\n-adds a couple more lights \r\n-added a better looking enchant and alchemy table. \r\n-different living room with better fireplace and cooking spot \r\n\r\nWatch the video to see what the house looks like. \r\n\r\nCompatibility issues: \r\nany mod which uses the interior cell of breezehome. \r\nRealistic lighting overhaul major city interiors.esp \r\n\r\nIf you have found a glitch or have a suggestion please comment below \r\n\r\nAlso I\\'m looking for some help with this mod since I\\'m fairly new to the creation kit, I\\'m looking for someone who would be able to help me add a couple of things. \r\n\r\nPLEASE BACKUP YOUR SAVE BEFORE INSTALLING! \r\n\r\nHow to fix some bugs: \r\n-the fire from the vanilla kitchen is still there. i have no idea why its doing this but i found a fix but you have to do it manually. first go into the console and type save backup. then go into console and type tcl.(should give you free fly type deal) Then go under the house and select the fire so the id should be something like 000cb9f. then type markfordelete. once you do that save and check if its gone. if something else is missing you clicked on the wrong object. this is the only way i can think of too fix this. this will also work for any other object that your don\\'t want to be there\r\n\r\nIf you know how to fix some of this, please let me know!",
