  "descriptionHtml": "*****College is going towards preping for finals, and you know what that means! Every scumbag professor gives out papers! YAAAY! So, until finals are done, I cannot update this mod for the 1.5 update, you guys will have to wait. Try \\\"Dance of Death\\\" its ALOT more superior to this mod.\r\n\r\n***This mod would more than likely have conflict with Killmove +. Only if you are using the esp which adds on to the killmoves. I\\'m using the one without the killmoves and find no conflict.\r\n\r\n*********FRONT PAGE!! You guys are awesome! I never though this mod would be that big!\r\n\r\n\r\n***For the people asking me to add these killmoves along with the vanilla one, I cannot do it know. Danni and his incredible mod \\\"Killmove Plus\\\" beat me to the punch. Go download his mod instead.\r\n\r\n*New in 1.2!\r\nAdds an even newer kill set for Warrior/Knight player who wants to completely  annihilate their opponents. Completely new killmoves new to this mod! In the next update, I will change 2handed swords along with 1handed axes and maces!\r\n\r\n\r\n*New in 1.1!\r\nAdds a kill set for a Ranger/Assassin/Thief player who wants flashy kill moves to prove their skill with a blade. It\\'s basically the 1st version with one extra killmove with one-handed swords and for dual-wielding.\r\n\r\nOk, lets all get one thing straight. Skyrim\\'s finishers is pretty much one of the best things in my opinion. But, for me atleast, they could be better. So, with the help sulezraz, I was able to make this mod. All credit goes to him. Check out his mod for unarmed kill moves! \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8094\r\n\r\n*What This Mod Does*\r\n\r\nReplaces the vanilla killmove set for a different set aimed toward different character types. Are you a Ranger who is highly skilled with a sword? Or are you a Knight whose purpose in life is to simply kill your enemy?\r\n\r\n*Installing*\r\n\r\nJust put it in your Skyrim Data folder and check it in the Mod Manager or data files.\r\nOnly download ONE of the kill sets. They will not work together.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Video*\r\n\r\nIf the video tab won\\'t work, go here\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2uxhspYSWM&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\n**************FAQ (READ THIS! FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS HOLY IN THIS WORLD, READ THIS!!)*********\r\nQ: Did you steal this mod from danni? THIEF!\r\nA: No, we are both using killmoves that Bethesda cut out from the original game. His mod adds on to the vanilla moves, my mod replaces them.\r\n\r\nQ: Oh, ok. So why make this mod then? Why not make these moves add on instead of replacing them?\r\nA: Well, the vanilla killmoves would sometimes not fit what player I would be playing as. Like a Ranger or something. So why not replace those moves to better killmoves that suit your play style?\r\n\r\nQ: How did you make these moves?\r\nA: I didn\\'t make them. Bethesda did but cut them from the final product.\r\n\r\nQ: I guess you can\\'t add *insert insanly violent killmove here* can you...?\r\nA: Nope.\r\n\r\nQ: You mod sucks, why even bother to upload this when danni\\'s is waaaaay cooler?\r\nA: Okay, I\\'ll give you that one. Danni\\'s \\\"Killmove Plus\\\" is a really cool mod and he did beat me to the punch when it comes to adding on the killmoves. But I\\'ll keep this mod up for the people who want killmoves to fit their play style.\r\n\r\nQ: I want ALL killmoves!\r\nA: And I want to know how to add them Once I do, there will be one large esp with all killmoves.",
