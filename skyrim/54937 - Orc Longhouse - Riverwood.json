  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=#FBB117]A small player home with an Orcish theme - designed to use with a companion mod such as UFO or similar. VANILLA Skyrim. No DLC’s needed.[/color][/b] \r<br />\r<br />First of all I was not going to make yet another house mod in Riverwood as there are lots about to choose from, however saying that I spotted this nice little ridge just outside the main entrance  and thought oooh ….. That would be a very nice spot for a defendable Longhouse \r<br />\r<br />As with my other house mods I make these for my characters and just upload them here to share with people, they are not designed for general populace, but are rather set out to my wishes and style (simple) . If you like them then cool, please enjoy -  if not then simply don’t download \r<br />\r<br />I have designed this with an Orc theme (obviously) and it has 2 guard towers that you can set your followers to guard at night - you will need [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14037/?]UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url] or similar and also [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045/?]My Home Is Your Home[/url]mods to do this. There is also a awning with 2 bedrolls for followers. Of course you don’t have to use any of them and just use it as a player home for yourself.\r<br />\r<br />If you wish to take a spouse then you will also need [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045/?]My Home Is Your Home[/url]\r<br />\r<br />There is a full smithing area outside and also wood chopping block and a few chickens. The whole of the outside has lots of ‘idle’ markers to keep your companions busy and is navmeshed.\r<br />\r<br />The inside also has a small room with two follower beds and a main bedroom for the player and/or spouse. To keep the Orc theme running throughout I have used meshes from the people listed below to make unique storage for armor and weapons.\r<br />\r<br />Inside also has a kitchen area and Alchemy and Enchanting areas with unique storage. Again lots of ‘idle’ markers to keep your companions busy.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#FBB117]It is compatible with[/color][/b] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13608/?]Expanded Towns and Cities[/url] - thank you to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/148336/?]Thaellar[/url] for checking that out.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]qmnEBX335Y0[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />A HUGE thank you to izon87604  for this beautiful video\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#FBB117]PLEASE CHECK OUT MY OTHER HOUSE MODS[/color][/b]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54846/?]TREE LODGE[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55212/?]Riverwatch (Dawnguard Themed) - Riverwood[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#FBB117] A HUGE THANK YOU TO THE FOLLOWING[/color][/b] whom I use in most of my house mods.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14133/?]FoodContainer Resource[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1505-strotis-ovens-resource/]Strotis Ovens Resource 1.0[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1591-strotis-kitchen-tools/]Strotis Kitchen Tools 1.1[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1440-general-stores-storage-resource-for-packrats/]General Stores[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1436-insanitys-paintings/]Insanity&#39;s Paintings[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1264-catering-by-lilith/]Catering by Lilith[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1480-static-armour-stands/]Static Armour Stands[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14134/?]OpenBooks Resource[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30599/?]Alchemy Clutter Resource[/url]",
