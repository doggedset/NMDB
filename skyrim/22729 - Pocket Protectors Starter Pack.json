  "descriptionHtml": "Due to requests for an easy to test out group of Pocket Protectors, I created a set of 3 that can be obtained right inside Whiterun.(Picture shows the barrel\\'s location)\r\nPocket Protectors are miniature versions of creatures that can be picked up and carried in your inventory. When you drop their item from your inventory, they become the creatures and fight for you! If they die, or you are ready to move on, just pick them up again!\r\n\r\nThis mod is separate from the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22408]Pocket Protectors[/url] since I wanted to keep the challenge of finding them as a core element to that module, but people still wanted to test these out.\r\n\r\nIf you like my mod, please endorse it, and try out my Quest Mod, which adds a new dungeon, \r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15896]The Dead Bee Scrolls[/url]\r\n\r\n",
