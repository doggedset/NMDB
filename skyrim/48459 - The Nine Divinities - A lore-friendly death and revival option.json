  "descriptionHtml": "I made this script after noticing little interest by the modding community to add dimensions to the aspects of player death in Skyrim. option\r<br />\r<br />I had used Zolmir&#39;s No Death Mod for awhile, but felt its efforts of balancing the game to be unfair, time consuming, and subsequently resulted in me reloading previous saves almost as much as in vanilla Skyrim. The Nine Divinities helps to add those dimensions, and should be compatible with any mods; all this mod does is add a script to the &#34;Player&#34; npc.\r<br />\r<br />What this does\r<br />*  *  *  *\r<br />First, after the players health drops below 1% they are rendered unconscious and blacks out. If the player possesses the appropriate religious amulets they can be revived at the nearest temple of a corresponding deity. After revival the player will suffer the stacking effects of ego and physical death, subsequently losing 1 point each of health, stamina, and magicka. This penalty can be negated if the player possesses the appropriate religious amulets. Second, a series of behind the scenes dice rolls are *rolled* to determine what equipment, if any, had been stolen from you during your blackout period. These items are placed in the inventory of the npc that last attacked you, and can be reclaimed at their defeat. Last,....\r<br />\r<br />While recuperating at a temple time passes at a static rate, and may be responsible for missed appointments,\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility\r<br />*  *  *  *\r<br />Fully compatible with:\r<br />. Frostfall\r<br />. Requiem\r<br />. Imp&#39;s More Complex Needs\r<br />\r<br />Not compatible with:\r<br />. No Death Mod\r<br />. Death Alternative\r<br />. any other mod that adds similar changes to death and revival.\r<br />\r<br />Compatible but buggy:\r<br />. Swift Potion\r<br />. Locational Damage",
