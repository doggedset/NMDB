  "descriptionHtml": "2013/4/1\r\nEdited the numbers a bit so it\\'s slightly closer to the body than what is shown in the screenshots.\r\n\r\n2013/3/30\r\nThere\\'s a small bunch of us out there that are extremely annoyed by the thigh clipping dagger in vanilla Skyrim. I am one of them, and I don\\'t even use dagger (but I\\'m still annoyed by it).\r\n\r\nI modified the skeleton.nif through trial and error, 100+ tries and 6+ hours of work, to finally put the dagger in a position that works better (for me anyway). I am a beginner modder, and most of the time I have COMPLETELY no idea what I am doing.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the idea is that I want to keep the dagger at the left thigh/pelvis area so that the draw/sheath animation for dagger isn\\'t too far off (and also because I don\\'t know how to modify the animation).\r\n\r\nWhen I started this mod I tried to edit vanilla skeleton.nif but any changes I made didn\\'t refect in-game(like I said, no idea what I am doing). So what I did eventually was use a skeleton.nif that only modified the dagger position as a template and re-positioned it from there on. Huge thanks to Metal-Gear-REX and his mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15658]Skyrim Weapon Positioning[/url] for that. \r\n\r\nAs it stands right now, the dagger is positioned at the left hip area where it will not clip into your character when sneaking or standing still. There may be some slight clipping with armor if the armor is wider around the thigh area (eg. scaled armor). While sitting on a chair it works fine, but it will clip into a bench if on one.",
