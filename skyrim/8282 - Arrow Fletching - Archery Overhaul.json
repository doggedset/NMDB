  "descriptionHtml": "---My Other Mod\\'s---\r\n\r\nDaedricforge ---> http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8305\r\n\r\n---Mod News---\r\n\r\nI have decided once I add the elemental arrows, and dragon arrows to be \\\"done.\\\" With this mod. I will still read comments and check for suggestions for the recipes and such.\r\n\r\nI will Release different mods to go along with it though. Such as and Archery Overhaul - Perk Revisions, and a Archery Overhaul - Bow Quest Series (With will have dungeons spread throughout skyrim with unique bows in them.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---Introduction---\r\n\r\nI don\\'t know about other people but I play mainly archery style characters, be it a \r\n\r\nassassin who is strictly bow and dagger, a pure archer, or a ranger type that uses sword \r\n\r\nand board as a back up.\r\n\r\nThe Vanilla game left me a lot to be desired. There aren\\'t many unique bows, and you can\\'t \r\n\r\ncraft arrows. The perks in general are okay, but can be improved upon.\r\n\r\nThis mod will seek to pretty much change archery and make it more in-depth. I will be \r\n\r\nconstantly coming up with new ideas/changing things. Please let me know what you think and \r\n\r\npost any bugs, If i find any bugs I\\'ll will post them myself, then work hard to fix them.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy the mod, Please Endorse/Let others no.\r\n\r\nHappy Skyrimming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---In Progress---\r\n\r\n-Add Dragonbone Arrows\r\n-Add Silver Arrows which do extra damage to werewolves (May not be possible. Still going to work on it though.)\r\n-Add Gold Arrow (Low Damage, High Value)\r\n-Add Elemental Arrows (Frost, Fire, Shock)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----History-----\r\n\r\nV1.0 --> All Arrows Craft-able.\r\n\r\nV1.1 --> Made Forsworn and Falmer damage one greater than Iron for Perk purposes. (Iron is \r\n\r\n8, Forsworn/Falmer is 9, Steel is 10.)\r\n\r\nV2.0 --> Changed Recipe\\'s. Must now make fletching first. Can only make 25 arrows at a \r\n\r\ntime. Added Rusty Arrow and Practice Arrow. Arrows now go under correct crafting categories \r\n\r\nin the menu. Ex. Iron is in Iron, Ancient Nord is in Draugur.\r\n\r\nV2.0.1 --> Fletching can now be bought from the Fletching shop in Solitude.\r\n\r\nV2.0.1b --> Fixed Small Typo, Updated Readme, Added .txt file with Recipes\r\n\r\nV2.1 --> Added Optional File that makes arrows only buyable at Fletcher in Solitude. You \r\n\r\nmust now buy them there, craft them, or find them in loot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---Credit----\r\n\r\nCredit to Gromit84 for his Fletching mesh.\r\nheadbomb for allowing me to a patch to allow his mod to work alongside mine.",
