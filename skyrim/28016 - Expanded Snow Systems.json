  "descriptionHtml": "Expanded Snow Systems: V1.4\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nNews: Updated to 1.4, dirty edits as well as sound bugs should be fixed now.\r\n\r\nAdded new version that has compatibility for both Dawnguard and Dragonborn (both are required)\r\n\r\n===========================\r\nInstallation: Place the Esp file in the data folder and enable the esp with your mod manager of choice.\r\nUnstallation: Delete the Esp file, Suggest doing this from a save thats currently in an interior.\r\n\r\nQuick note, the mod was done entirely with the CK so Removal should leave nothing behind as there is scripts added by this.\r\n===========================\r\nThis mod currently adds 3 snow types that each have 3 levels of strength. \r\n\r\n*Videos all show the LvL 3 severity of each type.\r\n\r\nType 1: Based on the vanilla snow storm has, has 3 additional levels that increase wind, the amount of falling snow and lowers visibility via fog levels.\r\n[youtube]xX2boK31I-M[/youtube]\r\nType 2: All new type that adds a more vertically falling snow with low wind influence. Lower fog levels for higher visibility.\r\n[youtube]VzGaWODvbJw[/youtube]\r\nType 3: This type adds very slow, large flake, no wind style snow that falls almost vertically, there is light fog and slightly brighter than the other types.\r\n[youtube]5H3dky_wbR0[/youtube] \r\n=========================\r\nRegions and types available\r\nWinterhold: Type 2 and Type 1, Windy area in general Type 3 Doesn't really fit at this location\r\nWindhelm: All, Type 2 and 3 predominant snow patterns type 1 is low chance.\r\nMountains: Type 2 and Type 1, high elevation and windy type 3 doesn't really fit here.\r\nSnowy Regions: All, Type 3 has the highest probability but the differences are slight.\r\nCoast/IceFlows: Type 2 and Type 3 Low probability.\r\n\r\nForgotton Vale: Requires Dawnguard and adds all types with the severe weathers having the lowest probability.\r\n\r\nNone of the vanilla probably weather patterns were removed so there is still the chances of clear/cloudy/normal snows/etc.\r\n\r\n=========================\r\nConfirmed Compatibilities:\r\nRevamped Exterior Fog\r\nWet and Cold\r\nMore Rain\r\nGet Snowy\r\n\r\n=========================\r\nConfirmed Incompatibilities:\r\nClimates of Tamriel: Loading one or the other last will override region lists, also lighting anomalies.  Use this version http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28110\r\nRLWC: Most part compatible if my mod loads after it, but lighting may be strange\r\nMore Snow: Direct Conflict I edited the same thing\r\nSupreme Storms: I edited the snow portion of this, technically compatible if you want the rain but you would have to load mine after to get my changes.\r\nRCRN: Modifies region locations and will conflict in the same way as CoT. Also has the added problem of script controlled sound systems for interiors that wont detect my weather patterns.\r\n\r\nIn general if a mod modifies regional weather systems it will conflict in such a way that will be what ever loads last wins situation. \r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\nRegarding Frostfall: I don't know enough about this mod and how it tracks cold climates if its a skse script similar to how Wet and Cold does it then it would work, but its unknown and I don't even know where to start to possibly make a compatibility patch.\r\n=========================\r\nCredits:\r\nBethesda - Without them there is no mod\r\njjc71 - Climates of Tamriel is a great accomplishment, and without it I wouldn't have enven known where to start with my mod.\r\n\r\nPlease give me feedback.\r\nAnd the pictures will never do justice, have to see it in action to appreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
