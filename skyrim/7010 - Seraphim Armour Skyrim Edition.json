  "descriptionHtml": "Original: http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36854\r\n\r\n***THIS IS NOT LORE FRIENDLY! THIS ARMOR IS MADE TO MY OWN PERSONAL TASTES, IF YOU DO NOT LIKE IT FEEL FREE TO WALK AWAY AND LEAVE***\r\n\r\n***this does not include the head used in the images, I could not find copyright info on them. sorry but please stop asking. No cosmetics mods are used here, It is my oblivion head ported into skyrim as a static object (Helmet), and once again, I have no copyrights to release it.***\r\n\r\nUpdate: added standalone version that you can forge at the blacksmith, all attributes the same as dragonscale armor and requires same smithing skill, but a seperate set from it (but you could wear this and the original dragonscale helmet for the same set armor perk). \r\n\r\nUpdate2: alternate weight slider version uploaded as standalone, (this one still has the exact same thin end, and the fat is just shorter legs so feet are above ground and slightly bigger breast size)\r\n\r\nHeres a link to the dark seraphim retex by iLily: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7478\r\n\r\nAnd heres a video of this being featured on Skyrim Mods show: \r\n[youtube]tJYi2yjamuI[/youtube]\r\n\r\n**** IF YOU LIKE LONG CALFS BUT DONT WANT FEET IN GROUND GET THIS GOODIE RIGHT HERE:\r\nRhaos HighHeel: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7129\r\nThis looks like it was made for my ports :)\r\n\r\nthe feet are in the ground on the thin end of the spectrum and its intentional because I like long legs. I\\'d rather have feet sinking in the ground with long calf than small calf and feet above ground.\r\n\r\nThird port released here. This one uses vanilla skin textures so there won\\'t be a difference in the skin color or a neck seam like the first port. This one also has a crappy weight slider, but there is barely any difference between the two ends and the fat end looks pretty bad because I didn\\'t really pay much attention to it lol.\r\n\r\nThis replaces dragonscale armor set minus helmet, does not include head used in ss.\r\n\r\nTo install extract the data folder inside the .rar into your skyrim folder\r\n\r\nThis was originally done by hentai but once again I made everything skinnier, and based the fat end of the weight slider on it so dont expect that end to look very good.\r\n\r\nPlease follow Hentai\\'s original permissions. \r\ncredits:\r\nHentai (<-best modder that actually lets other people use his stuff)\r\n\r\n***(And wow this thread turned into much more of a flame thread than my mixed armor thread Lol)...***",
