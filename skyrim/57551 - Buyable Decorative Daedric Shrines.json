The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />This small mod adds a merchant to the northern shore (check the screenshots for the map - there&#39;s an enabled map marker so you can travel there immediately. The merchant works all day. The little shrines she sells are all decorative so they do not do anything. [b]DON&#39;T COME COMPLAINING THAT THEY DO NOT WORK[/b]. They are meant as just tabletop decorations in your home or wherever, which is why some of them don&#39;t have a base and, if dropped, you&#39;ll be able to see through some. I used the existing statues and shrines in most cases, but improvised in others where there wasn&#39;t anything I could readily use. A couple of them have two variants. If you have suggestions for better shrine models, please let me know.\r<br />\r<br />French translation byÂ Edghar available [url=http://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/skyrim/mods/vetements_et_objets/autels_daedriques_decoratifs]here[/url]. Thank you&#33;\r<br />\r<br />You can buy shrines to [color=#1E90FF]Azura, Boethiah, Clavicus Vile[/color] (with and without the dog), [color=#1E90FF]Hermaeus Mora, Hircine, Malacath, Mephala, Meridia, Molag Bal, Namira, Peryite, Sanguine, Sheogorath, Vaermina, Mehrunes Dagon, Nocturnal and Jyggalag[/color]. As a little bonus, I also added decorative unusual gems (open and closed) and a small voodoo doll.\r<br />\r<br />In most cases, the shrines use vanilla textures, so if you&#39;re using some kind of mesh replacer that replaces textures as well, there may be conflicts and my miniatures will look odd. The collision is also a bit wonky. You&#39;ve been warned&#33;\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== CREDITS ==[/color]\r<br />\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/?]Modders Resource Pack[/url] by Oaristys and Tony67.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14923/?]The Fork of Horripilation - A Morrowind artifact for Skyrim[/url] by PrivateEye.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54152/?]Malo Statues[/url] by Malo and Tamira.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57394/?]Assorted Resources[/url] by Tamira.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]Visit [url=http://jokerine.webs.com/]my website[/url] for a unique showcase of my work&#33; Thank you, GhostAgent&#33;[/color] \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
