  "descriptionHtml": "-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSeanus Smithus\\'s Wifey Troubles (AKA KingCathcart\\'s Skyrim Tutorial Quest Mod)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUPDATE 1.2\r\n\r\n- Cleaned up audio files\r\n- Fixed bug which stopped actor hellos working properly\r\n- Couple of other small fixes\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1.1\r\n\r\n- All new and improved (but still slightly lame) voice acting.\r\n- New dialogue: Ask Seanus about his wife\r\n- Cleaned up dialogue (makes more sense and corrected spelling)\r\n\r\nORIGINAL\r\n\r\nThis is just a small questline made following the basics laid out in the Creation Kit wiki with my own twists.\r\n\r\nTo start the quest head to Mixwater Mill and let the adventure unfold.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve recorded my own voice acting which is hopefully laughably terrible in places. I hold my hands up to the inconsistency of the recording but may release a version with better voices at a later date.\r\n\r\nThis was an interesting experiment to see how easy the Creation Kit is to use and I\\'m pleased to say its a great (if a bit buggy) tool. You can see more thoughts over at www.urgetoplay.com.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve also made a little trailer at http://youtu.be/Bsunt4Bg4uc\r\n\r\nPlease do let me know feedback, thoughts and bugs if you find any. This is my first go at making a Skyrim quest. Next time expect a more detailed and polished affair.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nKingCathcart\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nJust export the files from the archive into you \\'Data\\' folder usually located in \r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim and select the tutorialquest.esp from the data menu in the Skyrim launcher.
