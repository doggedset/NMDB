  "descriptionHtml": "This simple mod tweaks the properties of Harkon\\'s Sword so that it has the same properties as the blades sword. I was rather surprised when I notice the stats were about the same as an iron sword. I also adjusted the ridiculous amount of low charges 23 to 50 so the weapon doesn\\'t need to be charged after every melee. \r\n\r\nTweaks are the following:\r\n\r\n-damage rasied to 11 (was 8)\r\n-critical damage raised to 5 (was 4)\r\n-increased charge consumption so the sword has about 50 charges (was 23)\r\n\r\nAgain weapon stats are exactly the same as a blades sword now since they have the exact blade design.",
