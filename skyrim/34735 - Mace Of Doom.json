  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod (so it will probably be crap) but i wanted to try and re-create the Mace Of Doom from Oblivion, but in Oblivion you could only access it if you typed in \\\"coc testinghall\\\" so I\\'ve made it possible for you to craft it in Skyrim. \r\n\r\nI would like you all to tell me your opinions (Good or bad) and be honest, tell me what needs improving and if you like it or not because I am trying to work with some people to bring The Lord Of The Rings to Skyrim. So other than that click \\\"Download with NMM\\\" or if you are a nerd download it with RAR or something and see if you like it :). \r\n\r\nALSO there will be an update before people start saying \\\" Mace Of Doom had a powerful Fire enchantment\\\", I am working on that so bare with me but for now to make up for it the damage is very high :). Thank you \r\n\r\nOh, almost forgot, you can only make it in the Skyforge and it\\'s under the Dwarven Smithing. BUT you have to have the skill \\\"Daedric Smithing\\\" but i can change that if loads of people have a problem with it :).",
