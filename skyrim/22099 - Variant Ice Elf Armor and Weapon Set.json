  "modName": "Variant Ice Elf Armor and Weapon Set",
  "summary": "Just a fun first armor and weapon set. Light and Heavy armor and one-handed weapons. Also up on Steam Workshop. There is a treasure with all items.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a weapon set that was favored by the old northern Snow Elf Hunters and skirmishers. This weapon set boasts chilling one-handed weapons and a fearsome bow. The Heavy Armor set assists with one-handed weaponry and your heavy armor attribute. The Light Armor was for Ice Elf Hunters who preferred stealth and marksmanship over brute force. There are both male and female outfits. I have also made a \\\"BASE\\\" set so you can enchant as you see fit.\r\n\r\nAll items can be crafted and will fall under “MISC” in the forge. The Light Armor is immediately available but the old Falmer recipe called for the tooth of the ice wraith through the entire set so come prepared (only for the pre-enchanted armor and weapons)! The heavy armor requires the knowledge of ebony crafting and the weapons are of elven lineage so if you know elven crafting you will know enough to create one of these ancient weapons.\r\n\r\nThere is a treasure chest by Winterhold I made a map marker that you can travel to without having to have been there previously. Look to the pictures if you have trouble finding it. \r\n\r\nPlease download I will update and have more to come! First mod for Skyrim be as mean or nice as you feel necessary.",
