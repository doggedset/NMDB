  "descriptionHtml": "Convert common weapons and armor to ingots using the standard Smelter\r\n\r\nTired of not being able to find enough ingots for your smithing requirement? Do you find yourself throwing away weapons and armor because they are not worth carrying?\r\n\r\nNow you can Smelt those unwanted items and create something useful!\r\n\r\nYes, there may be other mods that do something similar. Originally, the reason I developed this mod, was to accompany my new Dovahkiin Mountain Retreat house mod, but I soon realized this is best placed in a separate mod, and I decided to make it available as such.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Most metal weapons and armor that can be created can also be converted to ingots\r\n- Resulting ingot quantity is 50% (maximum) of that required to create the item in the first place\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nYou cannot convert an item if you are wearing it. For example, if you have 6 steel swords and you are equipped with one of them, you will not be able to convert any of them. This prevents accidental conversion of items you have equipped. In this case, un-equip the steel sword you are wearing and make sure you don\\'t Smelt them all, or temporarily place the one you want to keep on the ground or somewhere off your person.\r\n\r\nFully compatible with my other mods (on Steam Workshop):\r\n\r\n- Dovahkiin Mountain Retreat\r\n- Dragon Weapon and Shield Set (included in the Retreat mod)\r\n- Bound Dragonslayer Weapons\r\n- Aegis Shield Ward\r\n- Advanced Detect Life\r\n- Airstream Levitation\r\n\r\nChange Log:\r\n\r\nAugust 28, 2012 version 1.2\r\n\r\n- Added convert to ingots for Draugr weapons\r\n- Uploaded to Skyrim Nexus\r\n\r\nAugust 28, 2012 version 1.1\r\n\r\n- Added convert to ingots for Imperial steel armor and sword\r\n\r\nAugust 28, 2012 original version",
