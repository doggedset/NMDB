  "descriptionHtml": " According to the Third Pocket Guide to the Empire, Mixed Bloods are a mix of Atmoran and Aldmeri blood, with their origins dating back to the Merethic Era when  Ysgramor, leader of a great colonizing fleet to Skyrim and his men first settled,\r<br />They built the legendary city of Saarthal and established a connection with the native Snow Elves, and the two groups lived in relative peace. On the Night Of Tears, A splinter group Atmorans, in an attempt to survive and colonize a unfamiliar land fled Saarthal. Many of these Men took Elven Wives, and made their peace with the native Elves. Due to the difference in Lifespan between Men and Mer, coupling between the races is scarce, and as such there are only a handful of these original Man-Mer Hybrids left in the world, as most were slaughtered in the return of Ysgramor and his 500 Companions, or intermarried over the years with the Nede&#39;s of High Rock, resulting in the modern population of Breton&#39;s who claim it as their Homeland.",
