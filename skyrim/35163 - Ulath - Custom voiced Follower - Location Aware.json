  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/sSbds.png[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/6696/ulath.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[youtube]g_FvGilxvns[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[b]Requires:[/b]\r\n\r\nDawnguard\r\n\r\n[b]Stuff[/b]\r\nIf you like the look of this mod, love this mod, or love my voice, please endorse and track this mod! x)\r\n\r\nHowdy!\r\n\r\nwelcome welcome, come, sit, have some mead or a sweetroll =)\r\n\r\nThis is Ulath, he is a mean, gruff and rough sounding Dunmer, he hails from Morrowind and heard tales of the Dragonborn, so he has arrived in Skyrim to find the Dragonborn and help in any capacity!\r\n\r\nHe can be found in the Winterhold College Arcanaeum.\r\n\r\nHe is totally custom voiced, with over 200 lines of dialogue thus far, but more will be implemented as the updates go on. The actor who plays his voice is me, myself and i and i suffered from a bad sore throat for a while too :P\r\n\r\nI based his \\\"voice type\\\" on the Dunmer of the older series of TES games as the \\\"new age\\\" Dunmer sound soft and ergh.. So he has a deep voice, gritty and rough, just how they are supposed to be.\r\n\r\nHe comes in three flavours aswell, but only one can be used at a time, for obvious reasons, i did this so you, the player, can have a follower who is suited more to your attack style or general play style. The flavours are the Warlock (destruction, conjuration, alteration etc) who is pure magic force wrecking ball, The Ranger (conjure and restoration) who is an archer but also uses a sword if applicable and of course, the traditional Swordsman, a one handed (sword/shield) soldier who likes to get into the action whilst swinging his sword and bashing the masses.\r\n\r\nnote: all three have healing spells, just incase.\r\n\r\nAlso, all three have perks and powers, so they might be a tad over powered in the early part of the game, but a vital ally in the mid to late stages.\r\n\r\nAll the armour and weapons (recoloured/textured ebony sword, bow, arrows and armour) does not overwrite the vanilla Ebony set, it is standalone, they are also temperable and have recipes for crafting, they can also be bought from Warmaidens too, if you have the coin. The have also been placed in the level loot lists, so you will find them on your journey either on tables or chests etc.\r\n\r\n[img]http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/8762/warlockgj.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Perks[/b]\r\n\r\nConjuration dept\r\nAlteration Adept\r\nDestruction Adept\r\nIllusion Novice\r\nMagic Resistance\r\nNecromancy\r\nTwin Souls\r\nAlteration Dual Casting\r\nIllusion Dual Casting\r\nDestruction Dual Casting\r\nRestoration Dual Casting\r\nJuggernaut\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Spells[/b]\r\n\r\nHealing\r\nFast Healing\r\nGrand Healing\r\nClose Wounds\r\nConjure Familiar\r\nConjure Flame Atronach\r\nConjure Dremora Lord\r\nFire Bolt\r\nFire Ball\r\nSou Trap\r\nSparks\r\nLightning Bolt\r\nLightning Cloak\r\nMageLight\r\nParalyze\r\nWall of Flame\r\nWall of Frost \r\nWall of Storms\r\nWard Greater\r\n\r\n[img]http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/1479/rangerh.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Perks[/b]\r\n\r\nRestoration Adept\r\nConjuration Adept\r\nIllusion Adept\r\nJuggernaut\r\nOverdraw\r\nCritical Shot\r\nHunters Discipline\r\nRanger\r\nEagle Eye\r\nPower Shot\r\nQuick Shot\r\nStealth\r\nBack Stab\r\nDeadly Aim\r\nMuffled Movement\r\nLight Foot\r\nArmsman\r\nFighting Stance\r\nBladesman \r\nCritical Charge\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Spells[/b]\r\n\r\nConjure Familiar\r\nMage Light\r\nHealing\r\nFast Healing\r\n\r\n[img]http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/4238/swordsmane.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Perks[/b]\r\n\r\nJuggernaut\r\nMagic Resistance\r\nRestoration Adept\r\nArmsman\r\nFighting Stance\r\nCritical Charge \r\nBladesman\r\nShield Wall\r\nPower Bash\r\nQuick Reflexes\r\nDeflect Arrows\r\n\r\n[b]Spells[/b]\r\n\r\nHealing\r\nFast Healing\r\nMage Light\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\nAs usual, either download manually and extract to the Skyrim\\\\Data Directory or via the NNM button\r\n\r\nThis is the [b]IMPORTANT[/b] part\r\n\r\nThis file comes with 3 .esp files if you have guessed already, only activate [b]ONE[/b] at any given time.\r\n\r\n[b]Uninstallation[/b]\r\n\r\nSimply delete the files from the data directory\r\n\r\n[b]Bugs[/b]\r\n\r\nIt seems i have been victim of the custom voice dialogue bug, basically this means they won\\'t say things when they are supposed too (hello and goodbye, random jibber jabber etc) to fix this, you just need to look at the follower, save, exit to main menu, then load the last save, there, all fixed!\r\n\r\nUpdates will be coming at some point.\r\n[/center]",
