  "summary": "Adds a new spell tome and spell to the game to help keep Dwemer scraps to a manageable weight.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new spell tome to the game that teaches the player the Meltdown spell (level 50 Alteration, 185 base cost). It is nearly identical to the Transmute Mineral Ore spell in that it melts the six different Dwemer scraps that can be smelted into the correct number of ingots. It rewards exp to Alteration based on how heavy the item was. The items are smelted with highest yield having highest priority. This spell takes a slightly longer time to charge than Transmute Mineral Ore, but just barely, and it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s almost not noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe book can be found in the Dwarven Storeroom next to Mzulft, hidden atop the chandelier in the center of the room. To get it, one could use telekinesis or blast it down with an explosive spell (fireball, thunderbolt, etc) or probably even just jumping (unconfirmed). There is only one book and it does not respawn.",
