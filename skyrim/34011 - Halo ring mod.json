  "descriptionHtml": "From the series we all know and love, I give you... A Halo ring! This small but simple texture just replaces the moon in Skyrim with a halo ring high above the clouds. Thought this would be a cool idea for the mod community cause I have seen numerous halo mods for Skyrim, just not a Halo ring mod so... voala! by the way i did not make the ring, its an image i got from google and then erased everything inside the ring and around t so it looks real.\r\n\r\n*How to add the mod: Go to your the place among your C drive where you place your mods so they\\\\\\'re active in skyrim. Usually: Local Disk C> Program files (86x)> Steam> SteamApps> common> Skyrim> Data. Once in the Data folder open the textures folder and drop the Sky folder from the download in there and you\\\\\\'re set to go! Hope you enjoy!",
