  "descriptionHtml": "Dynaheir from Baldur&#39;s Gate, now in Skyrim&#33; I made her because I wanted my favorite party members to follow me around Tamriel. She&#39;s a Destruction mage with all 3 elements at her disposal, as well as a few healing spells. If she runs out of magicka she will fall back until it recharges, then jump back in.\r<br />\r<br />Levels with the player (up to 81), shouldn&#39;t set off traps, and sneak is one of her skills. She&#39;s marriable, essential, and AFT compatible. You can find her hanging out at the Frozen Hearth in in Winterhold. She should be compatible with other follower mods, let me know if there&#39;s any issues.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ll get more screenshots up as I can.\r<br />\r<br />I also have Imoen and Minsc, and plan on making other BG party members as I find the time.\r<br />Minsc: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52174/?\r<br />Imoen: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52182/?\r<br />\r<br />Let me know if you have any suggestions or issues&#33;\r<br />",
