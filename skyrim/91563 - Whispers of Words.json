  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][u]Description\n<br />[/u][/size]This is a lore-friendly quest that helps the character find the Word Walls around Skyrim in a simple and less tedious way. [b][color=#ff0000]A good and immersive starting point for this quest is when the player is welcomed by the Greybeards and has given them the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. From this point in the game, starting this quest makes the most sense[/color].\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[size=4][u]How to Start the Quest\n<br />[/u][/size]Starting this quest is simple, the player is exploring High Hrothgar when she/he finds a note on a shelf in the area where the Greybeards sleep. From that point onwards the player searches High Hrothgar for 9 journals, in correspondence to Skyrim's 9 Holds. \n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u]My Rationale\n<br />[/u][/size]Inside each journal, there are images that I have messed around with in photoshop to make it seem like they are hand drawn. My reasoning for this is because I wanted to make it seem like Arngeir drew these images from his mind. When he meditates, he hears Words across Skyrim. So I wanted to make it seem like not only does he hear the Word but sees the location from where it's coming from. Also, inside each journal are lore-friendly descriptions of each location. Where they are located, if the location is blocked (quest), etc. So, reading each location in the journals can be RP-ish if anyone plays Skyrim that way. Once the player opens a journal, the locations are updated on the map but you aren't able to fast travel to the locations.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u]Bugs and Whatnot\n<br />[/u][/size]If you notice any bugs with the quest or journals or see any spelling and grammar mistakes, please comment them to me in the comment section. \n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b][u]PLEASE ENDORSE AND ENJOY\n<br />[/u][/b][/size][b][u]MY OTHER MODS:[/u][/b] Skyrim SE, Skyrim, Fallout 3 \n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4770]HearthFires - Unique Display Rooms - SSE[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63207]HearthFires - Unique Display Room[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70318]Deathbrand Remodeled[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55951]Lake House[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20335]Improved Megaton Home[/url]",
