  "summary": "Ever wanted a professional cave retexture that is 100% handmade and has the one and only highpoly normalmap on the nexus? Ever wanted cave textures that actually looks like a cave? After many hours and corrections it&#39;s finally released.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=6]New handmade mountains that fits to this mod:\r<br />[/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59469/?]Advanced Skyrim Realistic Texture Overhaul Mountain[/url][size=6]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim Realistic Texture Overhaul Caves:\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]UdO-FFT3L7Y[/youtube]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][size=3]this cave retexture is handmade, which means that it will look good in close up and at distance. The normalmap (depth/roughness) is the only [b][u]highpoly[/u][/b] normalmap out there, which means that even though you don&#39;t have any parallax meshes. It will still feel like you have parallax.\r<br />This mod contains no parallax nor parallax maps. It will be added in later feature but as you can see, the normalmap gives the feel that it is parallax in this mod.\r<br />The normalmap is uncompressed but will still take as much VRAM as any other normalmap. No artifacts, the caves will look as intended.\r<br />The caves also have baked in AO(Ambient occlusion) for maximum depth and feel.[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][size=3]Here&#39;s an example with high/low poly normalmap:[/size][/font] [img]http://i.imgur.com/gfvo32g.png[/img]\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][size=3]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The benefits with hanpainted caves is that the caves will look good in closeup and at distance. Same if you have a older computer and needs a lower res caves mod.\r<br />\r<br />Even though it still will look good in closeup with low res I did add 4k/2K and 1K caves.\r<br />\r<br />This is an cave Overhaul which means that this is mod will be updated and improved.\r<br />[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]Advanced specs: [/size]\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][size=3]Handpainted diffuse with baked AO.\r<br />Uncompressed highpoly normalmap with HQ Specmap.\r<br />Seamless.[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]Install: [/size]\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][size=3]Use NMM or extract to your DATA folder.[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />DO NOT UPLOAD MY FILES SOMEWHERE ELSE.
