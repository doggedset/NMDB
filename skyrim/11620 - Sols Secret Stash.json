  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"Sol\\'s Secret Stash\\\" a novice conjuration spell that opens up a dimension rift allowing you to access your treasure chest from vast distances. A spell tome container this spell can be found in the Embershard Mine next to the tome of Clairvoyance.\r\n\r\nThis spell allows you to remotely store and remove items from a chest. For myself, who has an obsessive compulsion to take everything not nailed down this allows for much easier looting with no time consuming returns trips. Just load the chest up and take it back to town to sell.\r\n\r\nNote: As reported I have noticed that if it is the first time you have entered the mine you might need to exit it before the spell fires correctly. After leaving the mine the spell will work correctly.",
