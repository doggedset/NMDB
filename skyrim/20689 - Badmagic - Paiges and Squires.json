  "descriptionHtml": "Foreword:\r\n\r\nTried a few follower overhauls, some went too far for me, some not far enough, some conflicted out the yazoo some were just buggy, this works for me on new characters and on characters prior to Lydia being spawned only, if you try to use it post Lydia spawn I don\\'t know what will happen, it may work fine with a bit of dev command jigerdooery but meh. \r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nChanges NPC\\'s into non historically accurate Paige\\'s/Squires, rather than being a Knight in training these follow the stereotype of non-combat slave/dogsbodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nNPC\\'s Affected:\r\n\r\nLydia\r\n\r\n\r\nList of changes made to NPC\\'s:\r\n\r\n#001, Set to Essential.\r\n\r\n#002, Does not affect stealth meter.\r\n\r\n#003, Female gender animations.\r\n\r\n#004, Maximum level increased to 81.\r\n\r\n#005, Changed to use \\'CombatAssassin\\' class to ensure she levels sneak.\r\n\r\n#006, Set to unaggressive (Won\\'t start a fight).\r\n\r\n#007, Set to cowardly (Runs and hides from danger, comes back when you kill everything and/or everyone hostile).\r\n\r\n#008, Changed to \\'DEFAULT\\' fighting style as she will not be fighting and if set to anything else she tends to spaz out in an animation frenzy when you draw a weapon.\r\n\r\n#009, Adds appropriate sneak perks to avoid sabotaging the player.\r\n\r\n#010, Default outfit changed to lower class cloth tunic and boots.\r\n\r\n#011, Default sword swapped for iron dagger, speak to Bethesda about the asinine forced bow placement.\r\n\r\n#012, Appearance changed to a more stereotypical Nord (paler, blonder etc and less crap plastered on her face).\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues / Bug\\'s:\r\n\r\n#001, All the horrendous vanilla ones, speak to Bethesda.\r\n\r\n#002, Unless you happen to use exactly the same body/clothing/armour/face re-placers and not only that but the same version numbers there will be some differences in appearance, I\\'ll note what I\\'m currently using in the comments so you can see what\\'s what.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n\r\nv1.0 Scratch rebuild and public upload of mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nEveryone on the planet other than those affiliated, employed or associated with Bethesda.",
