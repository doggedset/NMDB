  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#e06666][size=6][b]Please view Requirements and Credits above for further information about the mod and images.[/b][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />About this mod:\n<br />5 followers who can transform into their own [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59463]werewolf meshes and textures[/url] form when their health reached below 50%.  Added an additional [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/89689]spell[/url] which increases their chance to transform.  Werewolf script was done by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/24266529]StCooler[/url] for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80574]Dividedbythe9s Rust Follower mod[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Compatibility:\n<br />Of all the Brevi and spwned mods only [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59463]Moonlight Tales - Werewolf and Werebear Essentials[/url] is fully compatible.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80983/]Moonlight Tales SE for Skyrim - Werewolf and Werebear Overhual[/url] is semi compatible, just turn off NPC randoms in the Ancient rings menu otherwise game will crash with NPC enabled when followers below transform.\n<br />\n<br />Side Note:\n<br />If you have [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76051]Are You There? Mod[/url], please use the ID's next to their name below. Where XX is your game load order.  If you summon others not listed below, you may accidentally summon their werewolf form and may follow you forever.  Just simply reload save.\n<br />If you use player.placeatme,the copy or cloned version of the followers won't be able to transform, as the script can only work on the original follower.  If anything, I'd prefer to meet them in their respective inn locations below.\n<br />\n<br />Name: Pack Leader Sayeon Meghan Jung [XX020F54]\n<br />Race: Breton\n<br />Trait: ht 0.96 wt 0.84\n<br />Wolf Trait: Howling Mighty Beast Large Dark Timber ht: 1.60\n<br />Voicetype: FemaleSultry ([color=#00ffff]Can Marry and Adopt[/color])\n<br />Class: Archer with bows and 2H weapons\n<br />Location: Falkreath Dead Man's Drink\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/gXdBfxG.png[/img][/center]\n<br />Name: Roffe [XX02045A]\n<br />Race: Imperial (Half Nord Half Imperial)\n<br />Trait: ht 1.03 wt 0.77\n<br />Wolf Trait: Howling Mighty Beast Husky ht: 1.14\n<br />Voicetype: MaleYoungEager ([color=#00ffff]Can Marry and Adopt[/color])\n<br />Class: Ranger with shield and dual wield\n<br />Location: Solitude The Winking Skeever\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/0ky8wWE.png[/img][/center]\n<br />Name: Susana [XX02047c]\n<br />Race: Nord\n<br />Trait: ht 1.03 wt 0.74\n<br />Wolf Trait: LeFemme Lycana Albino ht 1.15\n<br />Voicetype: FemaleCommander ([color=#00ffff]Can Marry and Adopt[/color])\n<br />Class: Lightning Mage and Spellsword\n<br />Location: Dragon Bridge Four Shield Tavern\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/aHIbz47.png[/img][/center]\n<br />Name: Ra'keem [XX023510]\n<br />Race: Khajiit\n<br />Trait: ht 1.01 wt 1.00\n<br />Wolf Trait: Frost Werebear ht 1.13\n<br />Voicetype: MaleKhajiit ([color=#00ffff]Cannot Marry and Adopt[/color])\n<br />Class: Frost Spellsword with dual wield\n<br />Location: Dawnstar Windpeak Inn\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/JcP3sBp.png[/img][/center]\n<br />Name: Ashaika [XX01e95e]\n<br />Race: Redguard\n<br />Trait: ht 1.08 wt 1.00\n<br />Wolf Trait: Howling LeFemme Lycana Striped Hyena ht 1.30\n<br />Voicetype: FemaleCommander ([color=#00ffff]Can Marry and Adopt[/color])\n<br />Class: 2H Warrioress\n<br />Location: Kynesgrove Braidwood Inn\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/1B0DoP7.png[/img][/center]\n<br />Name: Thursten (Imperial Legion Haughty Version) [XX01A842]\n<br />Race: Nord\n<br />Trait: ht 1.08 wt 1.00\n<br />Wolf Trait: None\n<br />Voicetype: MaleBrute ([color=#00ffff]Can Marry and Adopt[/color])\n<br />Class: 1H Shield with Lightning Cloak\n<br />Location: Rorikstead Frostfruit Inn\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/jwNc6tt.jpg[/img][/center]\n<br />Name: Mazoga [XX017c89]\n<br />Race: Orc\n<br />Trait: ht 1.16 wt 1.00\n<br />Wolf Trait: None\n<br />Voicetype: FemaleOrc ([color=#00ffff]Can Marry and Cannot Adopt[/color])\n<br />Class: 1H axes Dual Wield can also use 2H\n<br />Location: Whiterun Jorrvasker\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/jXPfM9E.jpg[/img][/center]",
