However, the version 0.4.7 of the original mod is causing CTD due to navmesh UDRs and conflicts with USP around several dirty edits. And the original mod has not been updated for long time. \r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />This patch fixes the CTD issue and several bugs of version 0.4.7 of the original mod and makes it completely safe to play with.\r<br />\r<br />[SIZE=4][COLOR=#FFFFFF][B]Important&#33;&#33;&#33; [/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]\r<br />\r<br />a) The patch will not fix CTD caused by other issues in your load order.
