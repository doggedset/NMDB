  "descriptionHtml": "Following Bellthesbas current design trends, I have created what I envision the next Belder Sprolls installment to be, where the studio&#39;s focus is mainly on creating a sandbox world where the player can do anything and go anywhere, and finally giving modders the power they have always dreamed of to make the Belder Sprolls they have alwasy wanted.I took most of my design for this sneak peak mod from an interview with Sprod Spoward, asking him what he thought where the key ingredients to making the next blockbuster action RPG.Earnestly he replied:\r<br />\r<br />&#34;The next Belder Sprolls, we want players to play the game players have always wanted to play, a game that is made by the players for the players.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />When asked what &#39;by the players for the players&#39; means, Sprod had this to say:\r<br />\r<br />&#34;We beleive in exploration, player freedom and player choice, so for Belder Sprolls six we decided to give all that to the players and more, we&#39;ve created a fascinating world where players can add any kind of content they wish, there are outlines for quests, some scripts for enemy encounters, there could even be giant squids in the game if the players wanted there to be, we are essentially leaving it totally unfinished.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />I questioned Sprod as to any details he could give us for the next epic main quest that was planned for the series, and what the ultimate fate of Splyrim and her people would be, if it at all factored in to the new title.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;We want players to feel like their decisions matter.&#34; he smirked &#34;So we are going to put some pre recorded dialogue into the base code that players can use in their mods if they want to either make a Splormbloke victory cannon or an Blimberial victory cannon. Ultimately, the previous games won&#39;t have a sort of, um, effect on the main quest per se because there is none.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />I was at first taken aback, surely the Blelder Sprolls must have a compelling narrative to draw players in to their fascinating world, but Splod explained:\r<br />\r<br />&#34;What we have noticed, is that people where very dissapointed in the stories of Oblobibon and Splyblim, so we&#39;ve listened to their complaints, taken multiple sources into account, and decided to not force the player into any particular path, they choose how they play, they choose their own main story, however they explore the world after that is up to them.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Blelder Sprolls six Balenwood will have two unique factions, the Swordsmen and the Wizards, who are in a conflict that can be built upon by anyone in the modding comunity. An exciting 3 new skill trees have been completely removed from the game, making it easier than ever for players to be dissapointed with the companies design choices.",
