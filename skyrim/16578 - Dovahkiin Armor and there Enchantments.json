  "modName": "Dovahkiin Armor and there Enchantments",
  "summary": "This mod as of now only adds a special set of armor with a set of enchantments that only a true Dragonborn is worth of adorning.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The armor worthy of only a true Dragonborn. The armors stats have been editted to be lighter and deadlier in honor of your smithing prowess and priced so they stand out as unique and Dragonborn worthy items. This does mean that disenchanting them, though grants you the enchantment does result in loss of this extra special armor with its custom enchantments. Wearing this armor set is OP and thus I suggest while wearing it, use master difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the Future:\r\nDepending on feedback and what kind of things people want, I will do my best to fill their requests, but otherwise I hope to:\r\nAdd more balanced custom enchantments\r\nAdd weapon enchantments\r\nAdd special potions with ingredient combinations that do not work as of yet\r\nAdd new OP spells but with a usage resriction based on time so as to not be OP\r\nIn the most ambishous future, I will be creating a custom NPC with a quest and backstory that will become your follower for the remaineder of the quest in which the dragonvborn travels to an old dwarven ruin that has been transformed into a secret outpost for a group I havent decided yet, thalmor bandit leaders, forsworn, something else just for funsies like giants spiders bears or Braith cause everyone has tried to kill the children, don\\'t worry it and you are completely normal, or stormcloaks/imperials ( I may make this based on user requests and what you want to happen)",
