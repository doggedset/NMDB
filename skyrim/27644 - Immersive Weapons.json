It is easy to keep track of.\n<br />Go tell the Nexus staff to fix this.

Delete anything with the name Immersive Weapons found there. Also do the same for the cache folder found under mods. Now download again.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/CgiqC6Y.png[/img][/center]\n<br />This compilation has been assembled by Ironman5000, Hothtrooper44, and Eckss.\n<br />\n<br />Disclaimer: All weapon mods listed below are either part of weapon resource mods or permissions have been granted by the authors themselves.\n<br />\n<br />Big thanks go to all the authors so be sure to endorse their mods as well as this one, it's only fair.\n<br />List of authors and their included mods:\n<br />- Hothtrooper44 for the Axestaff Weapon Pack\n<br />- 747823 for Weapons of the Third Era\n<br />- Urwy for URW Useless Resources\n<br />- Dogtown1 for the weapons from Skyrim Monster Mod\n<br />- PrivateEye for BiPolar Blade, Sixth House Bell Hammer, The Fork of Horripilation, Mace of Aevar Stone-Singer\n<br />- InsanitySorrow for Dragonbane, Ice Blade of the Monarch, Dragon Katana, Chrysamere, Goldbrand, Umbra Sword, Steel Bow, Silver Bow, Glass Bow.\n<br />- AlexScorpion for the Exotic Bow, Blades of Sithis, Dragon Ninjatos\n<br />- Cokla for the scimitar from Mongol Armor Standalone, YesThor Swords Standalone, Elven Great Blade, Barbarian Axe, Double Axes Of Skyrim, Dwarven Slayer\n<br />- gechbal for The Sword Of The One Eyed Crow, Orgnums Dagger\n<br />- ImsumDave for Black Sting\n<br />- Sushiyant for Hot Blood.
