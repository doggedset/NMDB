The other spell lets you raise any skull into a minion that will fight for during 60 seconds. You can have any number of skull minions.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]HuK8gussfUw&[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]AVmAaSRVOo4[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Femme Fatale Mod by Chapmister333 uses this mod, check it out if you want the ability to transform yourself into a sexy witch with the ability to decap your foes. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31692\r<br />\r<br />[b]INSTALLING[/b]\r<br />Install as any ordinary mod, dump all files inside skyrim/data.\r<br />Travel to Fellglow Keep east-northeast of Whiterun and fight Henry the Headless.\r<br />\r<br />If the head is invisible try extracting the *.bsa archive into Skyrim/Data.\r<br />\r<br />[b]RELEASE LOG[/b]\r<br />0.1: Public release\r<br />\r<br />[b]KNOWN BUGS[/b]\r<br />The decapitate effects visuals are a bit to much visual.\r<br />Your skull minions have no raise animation, they will simply appear over any nearby skull.\r<br />Try raising the decapitated body (I don&#39;t now if this is a feature or a bug)\r<br />I have not balanced the mod so much.
