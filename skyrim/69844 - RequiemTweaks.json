  "summary": "Adds a few small tweaks to the amazing requiem mod from Ogerboss.  Still under development and uploaded for testing.  Makes lore friendly changes to the necromancers amulet, changes invisible entities to dremora soul hunters and xivilai, and alcohol rebalanced to be slightly more mage friendly.  Also adds a few minor tweaks and items to a few bosse",
  "descriptionHtml": "Changed invisible entities to a xivilai boss using high level destruction magic, and ghostly dremora soul hunters that will seek to soul trap the dragonborn.  \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changed alcohol effects to equal out the boost to stamina and the magicka regeneration penalty, both time and magnitude.  \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added an item to kvenel the tongue.  \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More lore friendly necromancer&#39;s amulet.  Lore states the amulet provides equivalent protection to a suit of steel plate.  Since the necromancer&#39;s amulet is already very powerful and relatively easy to obtain, I made a few changes to Calixto to reflect his status as an experienced retired adventurer and having some knowledge of conjuration.  The necromancer amulet is now tagged as light armor both to correctly implement the armor rating and to avoid stacking with mage armor.  \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requiem is made by an amazing dungeon master team and Ogerboss, and I do not make these changes lightly.  They reflect issues some users have commented about, mostly regarding the invisible pugilists.  I made this primarily for the use of a family member, but if it works well for others I will expand and add to it.  ",
