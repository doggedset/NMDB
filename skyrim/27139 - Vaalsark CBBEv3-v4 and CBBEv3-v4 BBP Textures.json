  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r<br />NEW&#33;&#33; The 3rd optional retexture, COYOTE RETEX for CBBE v1.0, has been released&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod replaces the Vaalsark female body textures with ones that are compatible with CBBEv3-4 and CBBEv3-4 BBP.\r<br />\r<br />There are now three retexture options to choose from.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATES:\r<br />UPDATE: 12/12/12\r<br />The first version of the coyote retex has been released. It needs some tweaking, and the main focus is on the face. You could almost call it HD. :) However, I haven&#39;t done much work on the body yet, besides changing its tone so it doesn&#39;t look ridiculous with the coyote head. Overall it looks great&#33; See the new screen shots.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE 11/12:\r<br />A coyote retexture is in progress. Pictures of the incomplete coyote face retex are up. If there is enough interest in this, perhaps I will retexture the entire body with coyote coloring to match the face.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE 11/12:\r<br />I got the hairs to work. I also made a patch that adds khajiit hairs and scars and beards to the Vaalsark. I will probably make a separate pach tonight that adds apachii hairs. Most of the scars are small, sort of hidden by the fur texture and the nose mesh, but oh well. And two of the mustaches seem to come from the corner of the Vaalsark&#39;s mouth, but the muttonchop types actually look pretty cool :D. And so do the EARRINGS. They look awesome on those tall ears.\r<br />\r<br />Oh yeah, and I also added the night eye power and the claws perk to the race&#39;s specials list.\r<br />\r<br />I havent posted anything because I&#39;m seeing an extra vaalsark race in the showracemenu. It doesn&#39;t have a head, and its body is like a nord. Hmmm. Not sure what I did in the creation kit to cause that....Suggestions?\r<br />\r<br />SOURCES/CREDIT:\r<br />\r<br />The coyote re-texture was done from scratch, though the body is basically still just a modified Option 2 body at this point. Later I plan to re-texture the body with truly matching fur (doing this from scratch takes a long time&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />The other re-texture options are a blending of \r<br />Option 1. Kisa Khajiit nude fur textures by KisaFayd, specifically the Khajiit Skin v2, Basic Khajiit Skin for CBBEv3:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4962\r<br />\r<br />Option 2. CBBE V3-V2 Calientes - CHSBHC Physic - Body Texture - 4096 - by AnTiWoMaAgNoT, specifically CBBEv3 Khajiit Texture 4:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4686\r<br />\r<br />And\r<br />\r<br />The default textures of the Vaalsark race by Wolf of the Azar:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13561\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />FOR MORE VARIATION/OPTIONS WITH YOUR CHOICE OF RE-TEXTURE:\r<br />You can also get slightly different looks with your preferred texture. Do this by trying different UV maps with thicker/longer fur, shorter/smoother fur, fur that shows the belly button, etc by downloading and installing khajiit texture replacer mods like Kisa&#39;s and Antiwomaagnot&#39;s above (The Vaalsark race uses some parts of the Khajiit race, such as the specular/normal maps). However, I found that I liked the default khajiit maps best on the Vaalsark.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Required mods:\r<br />Vaalsark Race:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13561\r<br />CBBE:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666/\r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods:\r<br />Siamese Khajiit - this mod will let you have siamese cat type markings like my Vaalsark in the screen shots. It gives you quite a range of wolf-type markings as well, I think.\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1471\r<br />\r<br />I recommend using TexBlend by Caliente to get rid of any neck seams. :)\r<br />\r<br />Tell me if you have any trouble.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy,\r<br />Chaos (aka kichigaikikyokagome) ",
