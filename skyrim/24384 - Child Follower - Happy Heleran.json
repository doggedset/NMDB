  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a child companion to the game\r\nThis child is an ancient vampire that is deadly with his bow.\r\nHe trained himself to use the power of the Thu\\'um throughout the centuries \r\nand only needs to whisper to use it, he was an adopted Nord child of the Heleran family of Morrowind originally but was abducted by a group of Vampires a century before the return of the Nerevarine. After his abduction he was trained to become the ultimate vampire, though not as inherently powerful as the disciples of Molag Bal, he makes up for in his cunning ways of execution and slaughter, from time to time he goes to the orphanage to be adopted though he always comes back covered in blood saying they were killed by \\\"bandits\\\". True, not the best actor in Tamriel, but those with suspicions, are those that lay in the Halls of the Dead \r\n\r\nLocated in Riften on the dryside, check near the north gate, only kid with an ebony bow\r\n\r\n~Compatible with pretty much all mods, I use UFO with all follower mods so yeah\r\n\r\n- Uses bow and arrows\r\n- Non-essential/killable\r\n- Kills anything he so desires\r\n- Knows vampiric drain but he doesn\\'t use it because he hates using blood magic\r\n- Psychotic & as lore-friendly as possible, I mean Babette\\'s a vampire, so there you go. \r\n\r\n",
