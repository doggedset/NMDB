  "descriptionHtml": "After putting it off for a while, I\\'ve finally made the time to finish up this here weapon. The Gravity hammer comes in 2 forms, one that makes enemies fly when you hit them and another that is unenchanted. Both are craftable at the forge if you have the Steel Smithing Perk, or you could simply type \r\nHelp gravity 0 into the console and use the corresponding item code with \r\nPlayer.additem ######## 1\r\n\r\nThere are some minor oddities with the texture that I want to resolve, but it isn\\'t really anything horrible, I\\'m just a bit of a perfectionist. I figured it\\'s better to release it now and worry about that later.\r\n\r\nThere are literally a shitload of items in the works from us, so I\\'ll try to get better at finishing these things faster and getting them out to you.",
