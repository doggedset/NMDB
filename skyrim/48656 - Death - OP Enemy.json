The citizens and Jarls are worried sick with this event thus asking you to deal with this problem. Death is an overpowered enemy that should NOT be fought without proper levels and companions. He dwells in the ruins of Black Death Dungeon just west of Riverwood and will not hesitate to fight back with his minions.\r<br />\r<br />A very worthy treasure awaits those who succeed in this challenge. Are you the one to complete it?\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />For aid, I recommend getting UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul mod to increase the amount of followers you bring in to help you.",
