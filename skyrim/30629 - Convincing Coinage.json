Get it here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25814\r\n\r\nBasically, this is just like hiring a mercenary (Such as Jenassa), but you can now hire everyone, should they be an \\'acquaintance\\', I.E, they have a relationshiprank of 0 with the player.\r\nThey will also fight with you, if they are in the PotentialFollowerFaction, of which there are only a few NPCs in (With vanilla Skyrim. My \\\"Everybody is followable\\\" mod adds everyone to the required factions with no conflicts whatsoever).\r\n\r\nCurrently, the mod charges the Player 300 gold.",
