  "descriptionHtml": "Hello everyone! This is my very first mod and I hope to continue on with the series. As it stands, there are no goals, but if this works, I can see changes for the insides of more houses and businesses. \r\nI can take criticism and any feedback is appreciated and valued; especially if anyone can tell me how to remove Ysolda from the house without messing her up. Also, any bugs or technical issues you may experience, please bring them to my attention and I\\'ll work on correcting them!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and enjoy!",
