  "descriptionHtml": "This is a remake of Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess\\' whole map.\r\nIt\\'s going slow right now because I\\'m still learning the basics of the construction kit, I will be working on this everyday because I have no life xD and I wanted to have this done.\r\n\r\nThis is FAR from done but i needed a backup in case my computer decided to do some thing bad and delete it. (I don\\'t know I\\'m paranoid) \r\n\r\nUnder Heavy Construction about 0.1% done.......\r\n\r\nIf you really want to see my progress just type \\\"coc wilderness\\\" in the console after pressing the ~ button.\r\n\r\nI will update my progress everyday so you guys know my progress, I will work on making an entrance from somewhere but that is still out of my knowledge in the creation kit.",
