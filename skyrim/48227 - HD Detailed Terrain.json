  "descriptionHtml": "[CENTER][SIZE=7][COLOR=#92d050]HD Detailed Terrain[/COLOR][/SIZE][/CENTER]\r\n[CENTER][youtube]QovszuuJA9A[/youtube][/CENTER]\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis does exactly what it says it does. However, this is no ordinary distant terrain mod. These textures have been lovingly crafted, with extreme attention to detail. Most of the textures are 2K. The noise overlay texture is also replaced\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nThis modification will replace the boring, low detail, blurry and mundane Vanilla distant landscape textures. They will be replaced by 924 brand new High resolution, High detail and Spankingly gorgeous textures.  Each texture is the result of vigorous overlays, Magnificent filters and some other forms of witchcraft. However, this will only replace the distant landscape textures; that is, the textures you see which are further than 50m away from your character.\r\n\r\nThis also replaces the noise texture which is overlayed onto the distant landscape to make it appear higher resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTexture Size\r\n============\r\nCurrently the textures are a mixture of 512, 1k, 2k and 4k (The vanilla textures are 256x256) So some of them are quite a bit bigger, But it all runs smoothly on my computer, so provided you have a decent computer you shouldn't run into any trouble.\r\nIt should also be noted that most of the textures in this mod are actually 512, so there really isn't going to be much performance loss.\r\n(The actual percentages are 1.70% 4k textures, 6.10% 2k textures, 21.35% 1k textures and 70.85% 512 textures)\r\n\r\nAlso provided is a 50% version which contains a mix of 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 Textures\r\n\r\nI highly recommend that you first try the full resolution textures, However if this does give you any performance issues then try the 50% version.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n=======\r\n1. Download the file manually.\r\n1. Extract the contents of the archive to your data folder\r\n2.... No seriously, that's all you have to do :\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n1. Delete the following folder:\r\nSkyrim/Data/Textures/Terrain/tamriel\r\n\r\n2.Well, that was easy :)\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nThis mod is incompatible with any other mod which replaces the distant terrain textures. \r\n(you should be able to work out which mods this applies too :P)\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0, 28/11/2013 - Initial release.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nSend me a PM on the nexus :) \r\n(If I don't reply its probably because my inbox is full)\r\n\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nYou may not upload this mod partly or in whole to any other Websites without my permission. Also, you may not use \r\n\r\nany of this mods contents in your own projects.",
