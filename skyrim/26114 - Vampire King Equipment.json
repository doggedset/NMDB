  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to my 1st Skyrim mod. I haven\\'t played with the creation kit much so this isn\\'t very fancy.\r\n\r\nRequirments:\r\nSKSE\r\nDawnguard\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nJust unzip this esp file into your data directory.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThis mod makes available a set of very powerful armor and weapons to your player provided that they have been turned into a Vampire Lord.\r\nThe items are only craftable if you are a Vampire Lord, regular vampires do not qualify.\r\n\r\nArmor:\r\n\r\n\r\nVampire King Armor, Boots, Gauntlets = I used vanilla Dawnguard models. Boosted armor ratings and custom crafting recipies.\r\n\r\nVampire King Crown = I used vanila Skyrim \\\"Bone Crown\\\" model. Only takes up \\\"Hair\\\" slot so a circlet is also wearable.\r\n\r\nVampire King Shield = I used \\\"Auriel\\'s Shield\\\" model. Kept the enchantment aswell. It\\'s pretty cool. Later I will modify the scripts to lessen the charge cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeapons:\r\n\r\nVampire King Sword = It\\'s just Harkon\\'s Sword, only unenchanted and more powerful.\r\n\r\nVampire King Bow = \\\"Auriel\\'s Bow\\\", unenchanted and more powerful.\r\n\r\nVampire King Arrows = Used \\\"Blood Crusted Arrows\\\". I tweaked the enchantment on them to behave like the Vampire absorb life spell. Much more powerful and larger AoE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike I said, you won\\'t see them in crafting until you have become a Vampire Lord; other factions including regular vampires won\\'t work.\r\nThe equipment is found in the \\\"Misc\\\" catagory.",
