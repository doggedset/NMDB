  "descriptionHtml": "It always annoyed me that one of the coolest hairstyles in the game was clipping through the helmet. Since i didn\\'t find any fix i looked into it myself and discovered that the hairline-mesh file was the problem, so i replaced it with another hairstyle\\'s hairline-mesh.\r\nSince i am probably not allowed to upload the file, here is a short tutorial on how to fix this yourself within 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nHow to:\r\n-You\\'ll need an BSA Archive browser, such as Fallout Mod Manager .\r\n-Check Skyrim-Meshes.BSA and search for \\'hair\\'.\r\n-find:\r\nmeshes/actors/character/character assets/hair/male/hairline06.nif\r\nmeshes/actors/character/character assets/hair/male/hairline06.tri\r\n-extract them and rename them to \\'hairline04.nif\\' and \\'hairline04.tri\\'\r\n-drop these files in:\r\nskyrim/data/meshes/actors/character/character assets/hair/male\r\n-Done\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nRemove \\'hairline04.nif\\' and \\'hairline04.tri\\' from\r\nskyrim/data/meshes/actors/character/character assets/hair/male.\r\n\r\nConflict:\r\nThis fix will most likely conflict with any mod that alters the vanilla hairstyle-hairlines meshes.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to ask if you have questions. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
