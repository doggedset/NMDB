Rebuilt the main hall and upper levels as well as the bedroom. Over 45 packages have been added.\r<br />Of these npcs 5 are merchants. 15 are guards. 10 servants and many many more. Mechanical spheres and others have also been added.\r<br />\r<br />There are many many more changes which have been done. \r<br />\r<br />I have thoroughly tested this mod and I have no bugs. but by all means please let me know.",
