If your play experience is spoiled I am not to blame if you do so.\r\n\r\nA simple .bat which can be run on leveling up to simply increment your unarmed damage by 1. Nothing overpowering (or even really noticeable without at least a few level gains) but useful to help it\\'s scaling at higher levels where it would normally start to be quite :( by comparison to any other combat style.\r\nI was hoping to automate this process to upon level up but not good enough to pull that off without the construction kit. x.x If anyone else would care to let me know how to automate the process it would be appreciated. So enjoy! ",
