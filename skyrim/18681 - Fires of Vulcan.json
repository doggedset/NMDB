  "descriptionHtml": "Ever thought Skyrim\\'s Firestorm and Blizzard spells were well, undeserving for master spells?  Ever wanted a master-level destruction flame and ice spell that you can fire at opponents at RANGE? Well here\\'s a few.\r\n\r\nSpells:\r\nFires of Vulcan- launches fireballs at a rate of 120 per minute at the target.  Upon impact the fireballs explode and coat the ground within the explosion radius with flames.  These flames continue to burn and cause damage to opponents for approximately 20 more seconds.\r\n\r\nBlizzard of Skaldi- fires ice spikes at a rate of 120 per minute.  Upon impact with the ground it leaves the ground frozen in ice for around 6 seconds, causing further damage to opponents.\r\n\r\nCurrently you will have to use the console to add the spell tomes to your player.  I will later post an update where you can purchase the spells from a vendor.\r\n\r\nFires of Vulcan= xx07ef8c\r\nBlizzard of Skaldi= xx081541\r\n\r\nNote: Vulcan= Roman god of fire.  Skaldi= Norse goddess of snow, ice, winter, and hunting.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
