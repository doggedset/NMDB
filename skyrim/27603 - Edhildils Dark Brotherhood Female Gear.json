  "descriptionHtml": "Edhildils Dark Brotherhood Female Gear\r\nAuthor: Edhildil\r\n11,30,2012\r\nver1\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/1236/descriptionn.png[/img]\r\n\r\nPlease read all of the description before you post a comment.\r\n\r\nUpdate: added a standalone craftable version, you\\'ll need latest Skyrim update as of 5/16/2013\r\n\r\nThis is a female Dark Brotherhood Armor replacer, I made it from scratch and Calientes CBBE body.\r\n\r\nThe lowerbody has been enhanced in the derrier region (buttock)\r\nfor a fuller, rounder profile. The waist is somewhat thinner.\r\n\r\nThe armor has cool features such as a Poison flask on the upper right breast (so you can easily grease up your blade/ arrows), daggers on the right thigh (for that special moment), some lockpicks on the right arm, (to break into your clients\\' chateau), a coil of rope and grappling hook on your back that won\\'t clip with bows or arrows (so you can escape the tower after slaying that important client), and a lower back pouch to collect ears, store notes and maps, or what not. Now I feel like a readied assasin wearing this.\r\n\r\n[img]http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4153/requir.png[/img]\r\n\r\nCalientes Big Bottem Edition v 3.2 -You\\'ll need this for all the body textures and hand, feet, face/head meshes, etc. \r\n\r\n[img]http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/2482/installa.png[/img]\r\n\r\n1)Unzip the file to a temporary folder and read the contents.\r\n\r\n2)Choose which version you want, Busty or Medium. (you can only use one size, see below)\r\n\r\nOpen the folder you want and copy/paste the data folder into your \\\"skyrim\\\" folder\r\n(without the quotes).\r\n\r\nthis should add the following files:\r\n\r\ndbarmortorso_f_0.nif\r\ndbarmortorso_f_1.nif\r\n\r\ninto this folderpath:\r\n\r\nData\\\\meshes\\\\armor\\\\dbarmor\r\n\r\n3) Install the textures by opening the \\\"Dont_forget_this(textures)\\\" folder.copy/paste the data folder into your \\\"skyrim\\\" folder\r\n(without the quotes).\r\n\r\nthis should add the following files:\r\n \r\nDBgeaerblk.dds\r\nDBgeaerblk_n.dds\r\nleatherblackDB.dds\r\nleatherblackDB_n.dds\r\n\r\ninto this folderpath:\r\n\r\n\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\dbarmor\r\n\r\nNow your ready to slay, but you need to get the Shrouded Armor ingame.\r\nWhy? Because this replaces the Dark Brotherhood armor for female characters.\r\n(see description above)\r\n\r\n[img]http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/9233/uninstall.png[/img]\r\n\r\nDelete these files:\r\n\r\ndbarmortorso_f_0.nif\r\ndbarmortorso_f_1.nif\r\n\r\nfrom this folderpath:\r\n\r\nData\\\\meshes\\\\armor\\\\dbarmor\r\n\r\nand:\r\n\r\nDBgeaerblk.dds\r\nDBgeaerblk_n.dds\r\nleatherblackDB.dds\r\nleatherblackDB_n.dds\r\n\r\nfrom this folderpath:\r\n\r\n\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\dbarmor\r\n\r\n[img]http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/9223/bugske.png[/img]\r\n\r\nI only made two separate sizes, busty and medium. Why? because every time I try to make Bodyslide usable meshes my computer explodes and then I have to go down to the freeway offramp and panhandle coin for a new computer. So I am NOT going to make Bodyslide versions as of now. I also don\\'t like the effects of BBP, so I\\'m NOT doing that either as of now. Please don\\'t ask for requests of these, I will go into a PTSD mouth foaming rampage and have to be re-admitted into the mental institute. This alone took 20 long hours. Thank you.\r\n\r\nEven though I thought I got the Skyrim supported version of NifSkope,\r\nit will not show me the dismemberment vertices,(AARGH!)so I may have the \r\ndismemberments off, I will fix this when I can figure out the dismemberment vertices.\r\nThis armor seems unaffected during testing so far. This means that some combinations of gloves and/or boots may behave weird.\r\n\r\n[img]http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/8579/creditslo.png[/img]\r\n\r\nCaliente (CBBE body)\r\nEdhildil (Armor meshes and textures)  \r\n\r\nTools:\r\n========================\r\nBlender\r\nGimp 2\r\nNifskope\r\nmy brain, eyes, and hands\r\n\r\n[img]http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/4562/usaget.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n-E\r\n\r\nIf you want to use my meshes in your mod please give the proper credits listed in your mod readme/description. It would also be nice if you sent me a link so I can check out your mod.\r\n",
