That being said, if they seem broken/OP early on, or on low difficulties, that\\'s why.\r\n\r\nAs always, my follower\\'s are completely standalone, unless stated otherwise. I put a lot of work into their backgrounds, so I hope you take the time to read them :3\r\n\r\nI\\'ve recently made the switch to Amazing Follower Tweaks (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15524) upon updating my game, and I haven\\'t looked back. I highly recommend trying it out alongside my followers. Remember to place the followers below AFT on the load order.\r\n\r\nPlease, leave comments, and endorse if you enjoy playing with my mods!\r\n\r\nIf there are any bugs or glitches, let me know and I\\'ll gladly fix them ASAP to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n[COLOR=Red]Changelog:[/COLOR]\r\nVersion 1: Initial Release\r\n\r\nVersion 2: Realized the method I used had perks stacking up way too high, so, fixed that.\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]Background:[/Color]\r\n\r\n~4E 6~\r\n\r\n\\\"Th-that should do it... I think... Now, come on Selis, w-we can\\'t stay here any longer!\\\"\r\n\r\nA young Breton female is seen fleeing from the fiery wasteland of Red Mountain as it erupts nearby. The girl is holding tightly to a black soul gem, speaking in a calm, but stuttery manner.\r\n\r\n\\\"I\\'ll get you back into a body Selis. I stake my life on it!\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~4E 201~\r\n\r\n\\\"You... look rather pale ma\\'am. Are you sure you don\\'t want to visit Danica? Or maybe Arcadia, I could direct you to her. She\\'s a GREAT alche-\\\", asks Andur.\r\n\r\n\\\"No, I\\'m fine... though, I should probably go for now. Thank you for praying with me for my friend.\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"You\\'re welcome young lass. But, I have a couple questions for you, that is, if you don\\'t mind.\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"Sure.\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"So, this, friend of yours was kil-\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"She simply died sir,\\\" Manya interjects.\r\n\r\n\\\"Oh, er, sorry. Died, in, an accident you say. Now, I understand that this happened quite far away. Just what brings a Breton- not saying we don\\'t want you here of course, but, just, what brings a Breton out this far? No family in Windhelm?\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"I\\'ve got business is all. Ever hear of the Volkihar?\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"...Are you a vampire hunter or something? I\\'d appreciate it if you could NOT stir up a commotion in regards to vampires. We\\'ve already got ourselves a dragon problem.\\\"\r\n\r\nManya snickers, \\\"Something of the sort. And don\\'t worry, my lips are sealed.\\\"\r\n\r\nManya flashes a quick smile and walks out of the Hall of the Dead.\r\n\r\nAndur speaks aloud, \\\"There\\'s something about that young woman. Well, she seems nice enough. I wish her well...\\\"\r\n\r\nManya heads to The Bannered Mare to hear the latest gossip. Shortly upon entering, she hears the tail-end of a conversation;\r\n\r\n\\\"They\\'re here! I\\'m telling you, those vampires are back, and it won\\'t be long before they come to get us!\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"Just what would a bunch of vampires want with us anyways? You\\'re crazy I tell you.\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"So... they ARE here,\\\" Manya thinks to herself. \\\"Well, I guess I\\'ll pay them a little... \\'visit\\'... It won\\'t be much longer Selis. I\\'m glad you\\'ve accompanied me this far.\\\"\r\n\r\nShe reaches into her pocket, and grasps a black soul gem, adorned with several small gemstones that lay inside.\r\n\r\n\\\"Though, I think I\\'ll need your help from now on... Let\\'s go, Selis.\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]Description:[/Color]\r\n\r\nManya and her best friend Selis, who she had come to visit, are victims of the Red Mountain Eruption of Vvardenfell; Selis dies in the resulting catastrophe. Seeing no other choice to save her friend, Manya quickly seals her soul into a large Black Soul gem, and runs for her life. She vows to find a body for her friend in order to live out the rest of their days together.\r\n\r\nAlmost two centuries later, we come across the same Manya, looking no older than her late 20\\'s. She has embraced vampirism in her desperation to live long enough to find a body for Selis\\' soul. An accomplished mage and warrior, Manya has developed the ability to temporarily bind her friend\\'s soul to a Flame Atronach, so that she may battle alongside her, and retrieving the spirit as the corporeal body dissipates. Manya is now in search of the Volkihar Clan of Vampires in order to use their knowledge of life and death to find her friend a new host. \r\n\r\nHowever, she also seeks an end to her vampirism, in order to live out her days as a mortal again alongside her childhood friend. \r\n\r\nShe regrets her vampiric heritage, as it signifies a moment of weakness in her life; she strives to bring an end to the vampire menace of Skyrim. This prompts her to train herself as a pyromancer, in order to better dispatch those who hold the same blood she has in her veins...\r\n\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]Perk List:[/Color]\r\n\r\nConjuration: Novice-Master Conjuration, Mystic Binding, Summoner (2), Soul Stealer, Atromancy, Oblivion Binding, Elemental Potency\r\n\r\nDestruction: Novice-Expert Destruction, Augmented Flames (2), Intense Flames, Destruction Dual Casting, Impact\r\n\r\nRestoration: Novice-Adept Restoration, Regeneration, Recovery (2), Respite, Necromage, Avoid Death\r\n\r\nOne-Handed: Armsman (1), Fighting Stance, Bladesman (3), Dual Flurry (2), Critical Charge, Dual Savagery\r\n\r\nLight Armor: Agile Defender (1), Custom Fit, Unhindered, Wind Walker\r\n\r\nSpecial: Vampire (50% Frost Resist/-50% Fire Resist, Vampire Drain, Unarmed Damage Boost, Sunlight Weakness)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]Spell List:[/Color]\r\n\r\nConjuration: Bound Sword, Conjure Flame Atronach, Soul Trap, Flame Thrall\r\n\r\nDestruction: Flames, Firebolt, Incinerate\r\n\r\nRestoration: Healing, Fast Healing, Close Wounds\r\n\r\nShouts: Fire Breath\r\n\r\n\r\n[COLOR=Red](Hopefully) To Come:[/COLOR]\r\n\r\nFully Scripted Follower Quests\r\n\r\nFully Voiced Followers\r\n\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]Resources:[/Color]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666]CBBE NevNud Body Meshes and Textures[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9915]MissAniThrope and chakaru11\\'s C Eyes (eyeblue) Texture[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12951]Enhanced Character Edit Headmesh[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14569]Univision Face Textures[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii Skyhair Female Hair #8 Meshes and Textures[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27060/]Demon Hunter Armor (CBBE)[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17255/]Siberok\\'s Infinity Blade Sword (1 Handed Version)[/url][/B]",
