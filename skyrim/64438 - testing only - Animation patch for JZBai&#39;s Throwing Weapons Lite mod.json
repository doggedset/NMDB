  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is very crude at the moment. I uploaded it for mod testers only. Don&#39;t bother downloading it unless that&#39;s what you want to do\r<br />\r<br />Update 6pm 19/4/2015: I&#39;ve been shooting in the dark for months and finally we&#39;re getting somewhere. I seem to have succeeded with making a working first person animation file. It&#39;s the magic cast idle pose (i.e. weapon drawn, standing there and doing nothing) and I&#39;ve included in the latest update. Alas tis Sunday evening already. I&#39;ll try to make the rest of the necessary 1st person animation files next week or after\r<br />\r<br />Update 10:30pm 20/4/2015: Added the 1st person spell charge animation. The fingers are a little messed up I&#39;ll fix it at later stages. The hand moves outside of your field of view when you charge your spell. It&#39;s not the best looking for spell casting but for throwing javs it looks quite appropriate.Â \r<br />\r<br />Update 11pm 28/04/2015: Added 1st person run and walk. Altered the look of 3rd person idle\r<br />\r<br />Extract the folders containing .hkx files to the following location\r<br />C:&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Meshes&#92;Actors&#92;Character&#92;",
