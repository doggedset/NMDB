  "descriptionHtml": " Carved Ivory Armor - Skyrim Mod created by Lazarus Trout\t\t\t\t\t\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />VERSIONS\r<br />-------------\r<br />There are 2 variations of this mod:  \r<br />\r<br />\tVariation 1 is a &#34;lite&#34; version. It does not modify ANY vanilla objects in the game. \r<br />\r<br />\tVariation 2 is a more &#34;full featured&#34; version.  It modifies some vanilla &#34;Leveled Item&#34; \r<br />\tobjects and adds a new category to the &#34;Smithing&#34; perk tree.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />FILE CONTENTS\r<br />---------------------\r<br />Variation 1 is included in the archive file LazT_CI_Lite.ZIP and contains the following files:\r<br />\r<br />\tLazT_CI_Lite.ESP\r<br />\tLazT_CI_Lite.BSA\r<br />\tREAD_ME.TXT\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Variation 2 is included in the archive file LazT_CI_Full.ZIP and contains the following files:\r<br />\r<br />\tLazT_CI_Full.ESP\r<br />\tLazT_CI_Full.BSA\r<br />\tREAD_ME.TXT\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> D E S C R I P T I O N :\t\t\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />This mods adds a new set of Armor to the game, a heavy armor called &#34;Carved Ivory Armor.&#34;  It is \r<br />lighter, stronger, and more expensive than Ebony Armor, but not as good as DragonBone or Daedric\r<br />armor.  A shield is not included, but could be added in future updates. \r<br />\r<br />There are 2 variations to this mod:  A &#34;Lite&#34; version that does not modify ANY vanilla objects in \r<br />the game and a more &#34;full featured&#34; version that modifies a few vanilla &#34;Leveled Item&#34; objects and\r<br />adds a new category to the &#34;Smithing&#34; perk tree.\r<br />\r<br />Variation 1 includes a single set of armor, which can be found in a non-respawing player chest in \r<br />Whiterun.  (Located behind the Drunken Huntsman.)\r<br />\r<br />Variation 2 includes the same set of armor in the same player chest, but also adds the ability to\r<br />create Carved Ivory Armor at any blacksmith forge.  (It will appear under the &#34;Misc&#34; category.) \r<br />NOTE: In order to craft Carved Ivory Armor, you must first obtain the &#34;CarvedIvory Smithing&#34; perk \r<br />in the Smithing perk tree.  You can also improve Carved Ivory Armor at any Armorer&#39;s workbench.  \r<br />In addition, Variation 2 adds Carved Ivory Armor to &#34;Leveled Item&#34; lists, so that you may receive\r<br />Carved Ivory Armor when looting containers, receiving rewards, or by purchasing from vendors who \r<br />sell armor.  This includes over 200 enchanted variants of the plain Carved Ivory Armor.\r<br />\r<br />I hope that you enjoy this mod.  (If so, please endorse&#33;)  NOTE: The NIF meshes for this armor are\r<br />based partly on the &#34;Ebony Armory&#34; models in the vanilla game and partly on the &#34;Ancient Falmer \r<br />Armor&#34; models in the Dawnguard DLC, all of which was provided by Bethesda. Many diffuse textures\r<br />and almost all normal textures used for them models in this mod were modified (and in some cases\r<br />completely re-created) to create Carved Ivory Armor.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />TAGS\r<br />--------\r<br />  Armor/shields\r<br />  Items - Leveled\r<br />  Magic - Enchantments\r<br />  English\r<br />  Lore-Friendly\r<br />  New Textures\r<br />  Leveled Lists\r<br />  Fair and balanced\r<br />  For male characters\r<br />  For female characters\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />-------------------\r<br />To install the &#34;Lite&#34; of this mod, download and extract LazT_CI_Lite.ZIP and copy the files \r<br />LazT_CI_Lite.ESP and LazT_CI_Lite.BSA to your Skyrim DATA folder.  This folder is normally \r<br />located at &#34;C:Program Files (x86)SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimData&#34;\r<br />\r<br />To install the &#34;Full&#34; of this mod, download and extract LazT_CI_Full.ZIP and copy the files \r<br />LazT_CI_Full.ESP and LazT_CI_Full.BSA to your Skyrim DATA folder.  This folder is normally \r<br />located at &#34;C:Program Files (x86)SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimData&#34;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY\r<br />-------------\r<br />No DLC required. \r<br />\r<br />This mod is not dependent on any other mods.  \r<br />\r<br />The &#34;Lite&#34; version of this mod should not conflict with ANY other mods. A player chest containing \r<br />the Ivory Armor, plus a few small trees to hide it from view, have been added to Whiterun, behind \r<br />The Drunken Huntsman.  No other changes were made to any other cells in the game. No changes were \r<br />made to any vanilla objects in the &#34;Lite&#34; version of the mod.\r<br />\r<br />The &#34;Full&#34; version of this mod should not conflict with MOST other mods. A player chest containing \r<br />the Ivory Armor, plus a few small trees to hide it from view, have been added to Whiterun, behind \r<br />The Drunken Huntsman.  No other changes were made to any other cells in the game. SOME changes were \r<br />made to a few vanilla objects in the &#34;Full&#34; version of the mod. Specifically, new Leveled Items and\r<br />Leveled Item Sublists were added to existing &#34;Loot List&#34; Leveled Item Objects. Other mods that have\r<br />modified the same &#34;Loot List&#34; objects could conflict with this one. (In which case, the LAST mod to\r<br />appear in the load stack will take priority, possibly causing the prior mod&#39;s loot to not appear or\r<br />to not appear as often.)  This mod makes changes to the &#34;Smithing&#34; perk tree, and could conflict \r<br />with any mod that makes changes to the &#34;Smithing&#34; perk tree.  (Again, the LAST mod to appear in the\r<br />load stack will supersede any prior mods.)\r<br />  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />PERMISSIONS\r<br />-----------\r<br />Feel free to include, convert, re-use, or re-distribute this mod (including any of the assets it \r<br />contains) as long as you give proper credit in your mod&#39;s description.
