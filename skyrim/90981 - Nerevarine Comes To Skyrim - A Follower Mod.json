  "modName": "Nerevarine Comes To Skyrim - A Follower Mod",
  "summary": "This mod simply adds The Nerevarine (Protagonist From Morrowind) into Skyrim as a companion. He wears Banded Iron Armour, and wields a Dwemer Warhammer that absorbs health by default. He levels with the player as well.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod introduces the Nerevarine from Morrowind into Skyrim. He levels with the player, uses an enchanted weapon and banded iron as default. He resides in The Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun. He also makes mention of Neloth on occasion, seeing as how Neloth is a recurring character who first appeared in Morrowind. This mod has no requirements other than simply owning the game. This mod being Lore-Friendly is also up for debate as The Nerevarine is ageless, but is rumored to have disappeared in Akavir during Oblivion.",
