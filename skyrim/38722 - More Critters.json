  "descriptionHtml": "More Critters 0.8\r<br />By: SpiderAkiraC(AC3C)\r<br />\r<br />I made this mod quite awhile ago but for some reason never uploaded it, till now.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;More Critters&#34; is a gameplay enhancement mod that adds...well more critters to the game.\r<br />It intelligently places spawns in all the cities and villages that aren&#39;t covered in snow. They have a 100% chance to spawn and do not affect performance.\r<br />-Butterflies and the odd moth will come out in the day time. Torchbugs and Moths at night.\r<br />-Dragonflies are near any water source in the cities/villages and disappear at night.\r<br />-Pond Fish and Salmon are really active when it&#39;s early morning or raining, and calm down during the day. \r<br />-At night they are still around just in a &#34;sleeping state&#34;.\r<br />-Butterflies, Moths and Dragonflies do not spawn in rain.\r<br />-Butterflies, Moths and Dragonflies should fly away if you get to close too them.\r<br />-They spawn in many various different sizes\r<br />\r<br />For those that don&#39;t know critters are the following:\r<br />Butterflies\r<br />Moths\r<br />Torchbugs\r<br />Dragonflies\r<br />Fish\r<br />Pond Fish\r<br />\r<br />In all:\r<br />538 new land markers added\r<br />16 new spawners created\r<br />147 places to spawn\r<br />\r<br />Should I do interiors?\r<br />Temples, Inns, etc\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />I have 120+ mods and this one works fine among them.\r<br />If you have a mod that redesigns the cities/villages layout, then it could be a problem.\r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods:\r<br />101 Bugs - adds more variation with all the bugs.\r<br />skyBirds - adds birds that fly around acting much like real birds\r<br />Real Wildlife - adds more animals and improves their AI\r<br />\r<br />Installing:\r<br />Simply place the More Critters.esp file in the &#34;Data&#34; folder\r<br />MAKE SURE you are in an interior not effected by the mod, i.e Your house or shop.\r<br />Theres a chance if you load a save in a area affected by this mod your game will crash. Load again and the bugs will despawn until you revisit after 24 hours.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall:\r<br />Delete the More Critters.esp from the &#34;Data folder\r<br />\r<br />Known Bugs:\r<br />When a critter &#34;flees&#34; from the player theres a cool down time 3-5 sec so don&#39;t be chasing the same butterfly&#33;\r<br />Sometimes the flee function doesn&#39;t always work (working on fix)\r<br />Sometimes the Butterflies can land on top of each other.\r<br />Critters will despawn if the player is far away enough from them. In big cities. i.e Solitude or Riften.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy this mod and thanks in advance for downloading&#33;\r<br />please check out my other mods&#33;\r<br />Cheers",
