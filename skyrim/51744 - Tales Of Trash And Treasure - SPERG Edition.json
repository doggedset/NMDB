  "descriptionHtml": "Part of an inventory sorter that I am working on, this stand-alone &#39;plugin&#39; covers the clutter that SPERG makes recyclable by means of an aesthetic (to me anyway) renaming of the item, if needed, and the addition of &#34;Salvage:&#34; to the beginning of the line, grouping all of your SPERG recyclables in one place.  SPERG made more Dwemer metal smeltable, but I left the tagging of the vanilla metals out of this mod as they are going to be renamed in the full &#34;Tales Of Trash And Treasure&#34; nventory mod that I will be putting up on its own page when completed.\r<br />\r<br />There are two files available, the &#39;core&#39; file, which covers the applicable clutter from the game without requiring DLCs and the &#34;Semi-Legendary&#34; patch file which [b]requires[/b] both Dawnguard and Dragonborn as well as the core file (SPERG didn&#39;t touch Hearthfires).  [b]Both files require SPERG to be installed.[/b]  You can get it here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24445/?\r<br />\r<br />These files are (eventually) meant to supplement the main &#34;Tales Of Trash & Treasure&#34; inventory overhaul mod that I am working on, but I made this a stand-alone rather than a truly dependent plugin for people who might just want the SPERG recyclables sorted while leaving the rest of their sorting alone.\r<br />\r<br />While making this mod, I had another inventory sorting mod installed as well, and this mod played fine with it - you just need to make sure to place this mod AFTER any other inventory sorters in your load list in order for the changes I have made to &#39;win out&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />Also, this looks best under SkyUI.  I have not seen what it looks like in the vanilla menu.\r<br />\r<br />Many thanks to seorin for SPERG.  By far my favorite perk and crafting overhaul combo by far.",
