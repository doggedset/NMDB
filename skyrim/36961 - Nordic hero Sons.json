  "summary": "I just use this mod to make the Sons look more bad ass, thought y\\'all would like it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Not a retexture, it changes the outfits and leveled lists so the Stormcloaks wear and use cooler gear. Plus, i didn\\'t like Faendal so I changed him in the mod, don\\'t like what I did to him? then go in to the creation kit and change him. Ralof becomes a follower. You might see some guards using nord hero weapons, but nothing is perfect. Officers use the Helm of Yngol and the stormcloaks wear standard wearable ancient nord armor. Most field soldiers use the greatsword and most guards use the battle axe (Nord hero). Also, there is nothing really to add to this mod, so don\\'t expect and update.",
