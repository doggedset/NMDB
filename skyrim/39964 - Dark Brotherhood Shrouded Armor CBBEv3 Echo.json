  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/pCCVm.png[/IMG]\r\nThis is a simple replacer for the Dark Brotherhood Shrouded Armor mesh, for use with CBBEv3. \r\n \r\nAs those who follow my mods know, I made this armor a long time ago, but never released it.  It became part of my Dread Huntress mod.  I submitted an early image of this conversion, about a year ago, and since have kept receiving messages about a release.  So, finally, here it is. \r\n\r\n[b]Body Type[/b]\r\nAs always, I also modified the CBBE v3 body somewhat. For those familiar with my work, this armor uses the same body mesh changes as my previous mods.  \r\n\r\nAlso, as I never upgraded to CBBE 3.2; I\\'m not sure if there will be any conflicts with the newer body.  \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a standard CBBE conversion, without my edits, Killer Keos huge mod contains one. \r\n\r\n[center]Please check out my Savior\\'s Hide and Ancient Nord Armor replacers, Falmer Darkseeker Armor, Field Mage Outfit, Thieves Guild Duelist Armor, Dawnguard Female Vampire Armors replacers, and Dread Hunter and Huntress Armors (includes a Dawnguard Edition)[/center]\r\n\r\n[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10790]Ancient Nord and Savior\\\\\\'s Hide CBBE v3[/url][/center]\r\n[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11963]Falmer Darkseeker Armor CBBE v3[/url][/center]\r\n[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13646]Thieves Guild Duelist Armor CBBE v3[/url][/center]\r\n[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14198]Field Mage Outfit CBBE v3[/url][/center]\r\n[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22239//?]Dawnguard Vampire Armors CBBE v3[/url][/center]\r\n[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21125]Dread Hunter and Huntress Armors (includes a Dawnguard Edition)[/url][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/RollK.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Z7yeG.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/ePssp.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/51eVt.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/G1OOs.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/HihCu.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/AvHls.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/xtr5j.png[/IMG]\r\n- Dawnguard DLC\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666]Caliente\\\\\\'s Female Body Mod[/url]\r\n- CBBE v3 Compatible Texture (I use [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6554]Navetsea\\\\\\'s[/url]) \r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/0v4Qu.png[/IMG]\r\n  - Open the archive\r\n  - Copy the Meshes folder to the Meshes folder in Steam\\\\\\\\steamapps\\\\\\\\common\\\\\\\\skyrim\\\\\\\\Data\r\n  - Copy the Textures folder to the Textures folder in Steam\\\\\\\\steamapps\\\\\\\\common\\\\\\\\skyrim\\\\\\\\Data\r\n  - Select \\\\\\\"Yes\\\\\\\" when prompted\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/e2ur9.png[/IMG]\r\n- some clipping issues with the skirts and cape.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/WQcge.png[/IMG]\r\nCaliente - CBBE is an incredible work of art and I very much appreciate Caliente\\\\\\'s dedication and generosity to the Skyrim community. \r\n\r\nBethesda - Creating a great game and encouraging us to add something of our own to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/hQUqJ.png[/IMG]\r\nTo CherryHotaling for an excellent and thorough 3DS Max and Nifskope tutorial on armor conversions.\r\nLonti \r\nMxR for featuring my mods on Skyrim Mods Weekly.\r\nSaiodin for featuring my  mods on Skyrim Mods Series.\r\n\r\nAnd Everyone who tried out my previous mods, especially those who gave feedback, suggestions, and endorsed.
