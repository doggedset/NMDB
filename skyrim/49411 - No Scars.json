  "descriptionHtml": "**************\r<br />[b]Description[/b]\r<br />**************\r<br />\r<br />This is an extremely simple mod that merely replaces Vanilla scar textures with 1x1 blank textures. This effectively makes in-game scars completely invisible&#33; Also, it may VERY slightly improve game performance. :)\r<br />\r<br />I have made three versions of this mod, Male & Female, Male Only, and Female Only. I figured someone out there might the modularity useful.\r<br />\r<br />P.S. This affects both the player and all other NPCs.\r<br />P.P.S. This kills some immersion. Don&#39;t like it? Don&#39;t use it. Simple&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*********\r<br />[b]Version[/b]\r<br />*********\r<br />\r<br />1.0 Yup, *probably* won&#39;t get better than this.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />**************\r<br />[b]Installation[/b]\r<br />**************\r<br />\r<br />&#33;&#33;&#33;Warning&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />If you have any mods that alter Vanilla scar textures, this mod WILL replace them.\r<br />\r<br />*Unzip the file with 7zip or winRar. (if you don&#39;t have 7zip by now you should really go get it)\r<br />\r<br />*Open the No Scars folder, pick the option you&#39;d like to install, and copy the &#34;Data&#34; folder within.\r<br />\r<br />*Paste the Data folder into your Steam/SteamApps/common/Skyrim folder.\r<br />\r<br />*If your computer prompts you to overwrite any existing files, do so.\r<br />\r<br />*Voila&#33; No more scars on your NPC&#39;s faces&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*************************\r<br />[b]Recommended Mods[/b]\r<br />*************************\r<br />\r<br />These mods are by no means necessary. They are simply mods I enjoy and think you will too&#33;\r<br />\r<br />*Inhabitants of Skyrim-NPC Overhaul by Rops1981\r<br />( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23755/? )\r<br />\r<br />*Fine Face Textures for Men by Urshi \r<br />( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27815/? )\r<br />\r<br />*Apachii Sky Hair\r<br />( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/? )\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*********\r<br />[b]Credits[/b]\r<br />*********\r<br />\r<br />*Me (Xanins): I spent about 20 minutes making this. Yay me.\r<br />*Xenius: I used his mod, High Resolution Scars, to get the .dds files and folder structure necessary to make these changes&#33;\r<br />*Rops1981: He gave me the inspiration to make this mod. His mod, Inhabitants of Skyrim-NPC Overhaul, made my NPCs too lovely to have scars.\r<br />*Bethesda\r<br />",
