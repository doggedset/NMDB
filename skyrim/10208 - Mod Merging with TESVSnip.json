For more information about the issues of TESVSnip, read [url=http://www.darkcreations.org/forums/topic/1799-skyrim-handling-compressed-records-do-not-use-tesvsnip]this thread[/url].[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nIt seems that TESVSnip is not compatible with Skyrim 1_6.  But who knows.  Maybe they will fix Skyrim in a later update, or maybe TESVSnip will get updated to work with Skyrim again.\r\n\r\nSo I don\\'t think I will pull down this file just yet.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple tutorial with pictures to get you started on merging Skyrim mods with TESVSnip.  In these first days after the release of the CK, there are not a lot of tools available for mod merging.  TESVSnip is one option.  This is a low-level tutorial that will just cover the very basics to get you started.\r\n\r\nThe file is in .pdf format, is 17 pages long, and includes 31 images.\r\n",
