  "descriptionHtml": "A house rebuild on ruins in Winterhold. The current owner, a shady High Elf, has not been seen in a while. Even though this is not so unusual for this one, you shuld investigate. Perhaps you can inherit the place?\r<br />\r<br />[u]New:[/u] Now you get in the optional section a version with both the Cabin and the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30329/?]stable[/url] in one file. Remember to type »YES« to delete files&#33;\r<br />\r<br />New in 1.8: Changed Rogvir to stay alive at the bandit camp as originally intended. So now you get to fight for your house. But now you get a loft with Alchemy and Enchanting station for the price of fewer loot from Rogvir and Merindil (has anyone found him yet?).\r<br />\r<br />[u]Important:[/u] Delete your old versions with version number in NMM or manually to avoid problems.\r<br />\r<br />Stable: If you like a stable for your horse, you can use my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30329] Winterhold Stable Addon[/url] or the optional file with both the stable and the cabin.\r<br />",
