  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Arie Farm\r\nVersion: 1.9b\r\nDate: 3/30/2012\r\nCategory: Houses\r\nAuthor: Arion\r\nSource: TESAlliance\r\n\r\n=================\r\nRequirements:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nSkyrim 1.5\r\n=================\r\nDetails:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nPlayer home north of Whiterun. Nice farm house with large basement. Out buildings have blacksmith crafting stations, player horse that is essential, wood chopping stations, chickens, cow and goats.\r\n\r\nFarmhouse basement has all player safe chests and furniture for storage, enchanting station and alchemy station and working bookcases upstairs and in the basement. Beds for 2 companions as well as double bed for player and additional companion...\r\n\r\nHouse is companion friendly..\r\n\r\n=================\r\nInstallation\r\n=================\r\n\r\n1. Extract this archive to any folder and then copy the contents to your Skyrim folder.\r\n\tSteam\\\\SteamApps\\\\Common\\\\Skyrim\\\\\r\n  \r\n2. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, and enable the .esp file(s).\r\n\r\n=================\r\nUn-Installation:\r\n=================\r\n\r\n1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file(s).\r\n2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nUpgrade:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nAs with any upgrade there is always the possiblity that things may have problems. (Especially with all the patches that Bethesday has put out.) It is highly recommended that you back up your saves and if there is anything stored that is important to move it to a safe place first. I have NOT noticed any problems but warning has been given !!\r\nWith this upgrade there should not be any issues.The only thing removed from the mod were the books in the upstairs bookcase to make way for a working bookcase and the planters and mushrooms downstairs. I would HIGHLY recommend that you and any companions go to another city and save there before upgrading to prevent any wonky behaviors.\r\nJust extract these files in your data directory and if asked to overwrite say yes. \r\n\r\n=================\r\nIncompatibility:\r\n=================\r\n\r\n[b]NOT COMPATIBLE with HearthFires DLC[/b]\r\n\r\n=================\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThere is a bug with Skyrim where large items (houses) may not show up in game. If the house is not visible fast travel to Whiterun and back and the house will be there. You can also make a save at the house and reload and the house will appear. Hopefully beth will fix this soon. \r\nI recently got HearthFires and Beth has put a huge pile of rocks and changed the landscaping that affects 1/2 of the cell that the house and stables are in. They\\'ve also dropped clay pits in the cell as well. \r\nI am unsure if there is anyway that I can now make the mod compatible with hearthfires\r\n\r\n=================\r\nHistory:\r\n=================\r\n3/30/12 version 1.9b released to fix broken navimesh from update to 1.9\r\n\r\n3/29/12 version 1.9 released - Based on suggestions 2 corrals were addded to the exterior. 1 for the cow and goats and another for a larger and more diverse garden (now looks like a farm) Added 3 working bookcases, remodeled the Azura Shrine area, added planters with flowers and trees to give it a more homely atmosphere.\r\n\r\n3/16/2012 version 1.7 Added table with player safe chests for blacksmithing supplies including misc barrel, added a couple more lanterns on porch for aesthetics, Added chimney to house with smoke just because. Rearranged the chests in the basement and put them on shelves to make room for display cases in the center isle. Fixed the display chests so they actually work.\r\n\r\n3/13/2012 Version 1.5 Retextured the interior and exterior and made it a bit more homely\r\n\r\n2/25/2012 - 2/25/12 version 1 release\r\n\r\n=================\r\nContact:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nContact Arion by PM at TESAlliance\r\n\r\n=================\r\nCredits:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThanks to Horrorview for allowing me to use some of his farm textures from his \\\"Sexy Villages and Farms mod\\\".
