  "descriptionHtml": "Not yet completed!  Work in Progress!!!\r\n\r\nIf this looks interesting to you, please hit the Track button so you\\'ll know when the next version is up!  If you don\\'t mind playing halfway through and giving me any feedback, that would be very helpful :)  When I began making this, my ideas were too grandiose for my modding ability, but now maybe I can finally finish this thing.\r\n\r\n[color=#ffff99][size=+1][b]Features:[/b][/size][/color]\r\n- A short quest about a kidnapping, a group of rogue assassins, and a powerful magical item.\r\n- 4 primary NPCs, several supporting NPCs\r\n- A medium-sized dungeon, fully Navmeshed and optimized\r\n- Total Play Time:  about 25 - 30 minutes minimum\r\n\r\n[color=#99ccff][b]Starting the Quest:[/b][/color]\r\nTravel to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun to find a distraught young lady named Jenna.\r\n\r\n[color=#99ccff][b]Along the way:[/b][/color]\r\nChoose CAREfully from the dialogue options.  The wrong choice could immediately fail the quest!\r\nTravel to a radiant location to find an item.  The location will be different for each playthrough and could be any dungeon, small or large, vanilla or mod, as long as it has the keyword \\\"NordRuin\\\" and a boss chest.\r\nExplore a new dungeon, fully hand-Navmeshed and optimized, with enemies and loot.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  After retrieving the item, that\\'s as far as you can really go in the quest so far.  This mod has been on hold for a while as I worked on other mods and learned more scripting.  Now I\\'m going to finally try and finish it.  Next version (1.5) will hopefully be finished and bug-free (wishful thinking though that may be!)\r\n\r\n[color=#ffff99][size=+1][b]Compatibility:[/b][/size][/color]\r\nThe only possible conflicts this mod should have are location.  I added a house on the outskirts of Whiterun, and a tomb entrance northeast of Windhelm.\r\nDoes NOT conflict with Nernies Cities Expansion mod.\r\n\r\n[color=#ffff99][size=+1][b]Voice Credits (in order of appearance):[/b][/size][/color]\r\nJenna - Anduniel (me)\r\nFaranor - Elijah Lucian\r\nSamira - Anduniel\r\nRed Dirks - Elijah Lucian\r\nJasmina - Anduniel\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at my other, complete quest mod, [b][color=#ffff99][url=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25977]Loves Labors Avenged[/url][/color][/b]\r\n\r\n[color=#ffff99][size=+1][b]My other Voice Work:[/size][/b][/color]\r\nI\\'m available!
