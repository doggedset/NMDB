  "descriptionHtml": "Spacious home with lots of options! Adoptions, marriage, farming, extra follower beds, crafting equipment, and a special side quest back-story (we can't just have houses popping up out of thin air right?) There are a few other surprises, but you will just have to find them yourself. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nIncludes:\r\n- 4 story player home\r\n- 2 Potential Followers\r\n- 12 special npcs (1 with the quest and 2 Stewards with options to marry)\r\n- Huge weapons display room\r\n- 10 follower beds\r\n- 2 children's beds\r\n- Farming area outside with 36 available plots\r\n- LOTS of storage and very well organized with visual indicators\r\n- Respawnable ingredients of every kind\r\n- Respawnable mining nodes\r\n- Brand new original weapons\r\n- Great memorabilia from the game included\r\n- Funny movie references\r\n- Brand new voice acting\r\n- And a few other surprises... :)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTICE: MUST have \"HearthFires\" to work properly.\r\nOPTIONAL AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: HearthfireMultiKid.esp/\"Hearthfire multiple adoptions\" is needed to adopt and own the home for marriage.\r\n\r\nWARNING: If you are married or have children, you MUST move them to another house before uninstalling or your save will be broken, and you will not be able to get married or divorced afterwards. To fix this problem, kill your marriage partner, then console \"setstage relationshipmarriage 10\" then click and \"resurrect\" them.\r\n\r\nTO RE-INSTALL: Before you uninstall, grab everything in the house and tell the kids to move to a different home. This should keep anything from being lost or broken in your save. Before clicking play, go to \"data\" on the Skyrim loading screen. Un-select riverwoodpatronsmanor (make sure it stays un-selected). Load Skyrim and save your game this way. Completely log out to desktop, then go back to data and check that mod again and load that last saved game.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I would love to hear what you think, so please leave some feedback.\r\n",
