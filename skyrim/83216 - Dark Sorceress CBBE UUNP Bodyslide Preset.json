  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][color=#f4f4f4][size=4][b]A bodyslide preset intended to give a good balance of realism/sexiness.[/b][/size][/color][/font][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=4]\n<br />\n<br />I know there are tons of other files like this that have been made by other users, but this really was the only body I have been entirely satisfied with myself, and perhaps this might be exactly what you want as well.\n<br />[color=#351C75]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/color]\n<br />Some reasons I customized this body as such:\n<br />[color=#ff00ff]1.[/color] Decent diversity between weights 0 and 100. Many bodies such as the default CBBE body simply have too little variation in the weight sliders. Women tend to end up looking nearly identical, which I have always found to be immersion breaking.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff00ff]2.[/color] This body was designed to work with bodyslide compatible outfits as well as possible. While it is great to have bodies that range from flat-chested to mammoth udders, bodies that vary too greatly cause outfit textures to stretch or distort. For people like myself who don't want to edit outfit textures to get them to match your body, you may find this to be a good balance between variety and outfit compatibility.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff00ff]3.[/color] Realism. I am well aware that this body is more voluptuous than the average woman, but it is intended to be used by a more attractive sorceress/vampire character.  The body is however \"lore-friendly\" in the sense that a woman in a medieval fantasy setting could actually have such a body and not be 1/1000. \n<br />\n<br />Thank you for visiting my mod, and I sincerely hope you find this preset as enjoyable as I do.\n<br />\n<br />[i][color=#9900ff][color=#351C75]~Syvanna[/color]\n<br />[/color][color=#a64d79]\n<br />If you would like to get the racemenu preset for the lovely sorceress the screenshots, you can check it out here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/87826/?[/color][/i][/size][/font]",
