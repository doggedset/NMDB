  "descriptionHtml": "When I first saw the dragon armours I have to admit, it didn\\'t look as threatening as I had anticipated. All that hard work smithing! For what! So I could look like a dry bone thats been left in the sun for too long? THIS WILL NOT SUFFICE!\r\n\r\nThis Re-texture changes the pale bone colour to a more hardcore dark grey and changes the same old \\\"leather colour\\\" to more of a deep maroon.\r\n\r\nThis is my first retexture so please! Dont hesitate to let me know if there are any little glitches this might create! I have used it for well over an hour and so far all good!\r\n\r\nI will be creating an alternative for the dragon scale armour as well so not to worry!\r\nPlease endorse ;D",
