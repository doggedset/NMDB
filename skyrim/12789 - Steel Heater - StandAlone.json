  "summary": "My first mod! A retex of the Imperial shield. Now standalone.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I thought that the steel shield was fugly, and the imperial shield had potential, so I decided to mix the two. The result was the Steel Heater, and with just a half hour, it turned out better than I could\\'ve hoped.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested to merge this in Wrye Bash, because of the additions to the Lvl Lists. Thank shingouki2002, because I didn\\'t even know about that until now, LOL.\r\n\r\nV2.1.1 - \r\nThere was a minor issue with the shield model coming out twice the size it should have been, so I fixed it.\r\n\r\nV2.1 -\r\nAdded to most lvl lists between the levels of the steel shield and dwarven shield (9-12 give or take). \r\nCan be made at a forge:  1 Imperial Shield + 2 Steel Ingots = Steel Heater\r\nHas 3 ranks of enchantments, same as steel (Minor-Major).\r\nStat wise, it is as strong as dwarven.\r\n\r\nIf any of you pro\\'s want to use/improve it, by all means, do so! All I ask is that I\\'m given credit for the concept.\r\n\r\nA VERY special thanks to shingouki2002 for showing me the ropes to make this standalone.\r\n\r\nPlease Enjoy!\r\n\r\nFuture Updates:\r\nV2.2 - Revised Normal Map\r\nNew Model (Way Future) (Unless someone would like to assist... *hint hint*)",
