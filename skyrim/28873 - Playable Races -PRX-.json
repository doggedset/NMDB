  "summary": "After creating my 180th character, I decided I needed some new material to work with... here\\\\\\'s what I ended up with!",
  "descriptionHtml": "It gets to that point in one\\'s Skyrim experience, when one has to make a new character. For me, this wasn\\'t too easy. Almost every possible combination of races and features were taken one at a time. So I made this. So far it adds 5 new playable races from Elder Scrolls Lore. These are Sea Elves, Ka Po\\' Tun, Dremora, Xivilai and Elder Nords.\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/images/70110-1323793508.png[/img]\r\n[b]Maormer - Sea Elves[/b]\r\nThere is currently one Sea Elf living in Tamriel. She\\'s at a lighthouse near Dawnstar, It\\'s going to be a quest to save her but I kinda forgot to finish everything. The Maormer can blend into their surroundings by sneaking thanks to their chameleon-like skin. \r\n\r\n[b]Ka Po\\' Tun - The Akavir[/b]\r\nThe Ka Po\\' Tun (meaning Tiger-Dragon\\'s Empire) are an Empire of tiger-like catfolk, I envision them as big bad-ass pussies. Their leader, Tosh Raka can turn into a dragon. It\\'s a shame you can\\'t. I didn\\'t want to add that. Instead, you can summon a little red dragon after you learn \\\"Fus\\\".\r\n\r\n[b]Dremora - The Common Daedra (Kyn)[/b]\r\nThe Kyn are those awesome robot-voiced guys from the Daedric quests.\r\nY\\'know, you kinda ripped off their fashion sense after you cheated your smithing level.\r\n\r\n[b]Xivilai - The Blue Daedra from Oblivion[/b]\r\nYou remember these spell absorbing powerhouse daedra freaks? That\\'s right, I gave it a shot in the CK. Praise me now.\r\n\r\n[b]Elder Nords - True Warriors Never Die[/b]\r\nYou can finally role play as a creepy old pervert. Enjoy!\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/images/70110-1323793508.png[/img]\r\nUpdate Plans: \r\n- Armour - Alternate Dadric Armour Colours\r\n- Armour - Xivilai Armour\r\n- Armour - Greybeard Robes\r\n- Quest - Save Enial the Maormer Slave\r\n- Dremora - More Hairstyles\r\n- Xivilai - More/Fixed Hairstyles\r\n\r\nCurrent Issues:\r\n- Maormer - Chameleon Effect might not work after a few hours of playtime.\r\n- Xivilai - Hairstyles 1&2 have major clipping issues. More Dremora/Xivilai Hairstyles soon.\r\n- Enial - Enial has a Man\\'s Voice. Somehow talks with a gag on...\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/images/70110-1323793508.png[/img]\r\nSteam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=115578563\r\nNexus: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28873/",
