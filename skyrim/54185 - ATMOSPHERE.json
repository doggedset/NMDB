  "descriptionHtml": "This mod eliminates the so called &#34;Sky Line or Ripple Bug&#34;. Which means it removes the lines that you see running across the sky.\r<br />\r<br />The Sky Line or Ripple Bug is not actually a bug, it&#39;s the side effect of having colours in the sky. Colours that produce dramatic sunsets, etc., these are called colour bands and are the culprit for the lines you see when examining the sky.\r<br />The only way to remove these and give a clear lineless sky, are simply to remove the colour and that is basically what this mod does. So if you like really dramatic coloured dusks and dawns then this isn&#39;t for you.\r<br />\r<br />This mod was made as a request to fix this problem and I have spent a couple days trying to create a version which will still have colour but with less to no notieable lines but I had to put it on hold because of the tedium that is involved. I have half finished it and I may pick it up again at some point after my hair has grown back. Until then this one will remove all colour.\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY:\r<br />This will not be compatible with other mods that change this mesh.\r<br />\r<br />Compatible with all weather mods and ENBs but be warned it may change the look of the sky from what you may have expected. For better or worse that is entirely up to your own personal opinion. I do strongly advise you to look at the images before downloading.\r<br />\r<br />If anyone is looking for a brilliant lighting and weather mod and also does what I have done with this mod but completely and amazingly better, then click on the link and be prepared to be awed as I was.\r<br />[url=http://enbdev.com/enbseries/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1930&sid=9ace775be045503418bb201f3dcb6f32]Enhanced Lighting for ENB [/url]\r<br />\r<br />MY MODS:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56127/?]CLOUDS[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54185/?]ATMOSPHERE[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54085/?]RAIN[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53971/?]AURORA[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53917/?]STARS[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52986/?]SNOW[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52733/?]LEAVES[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51462/?]DANDELION SEEDS[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51011/?]DUST[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48538/?]WEBS extended[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33718/?]WEBS[/url]",
