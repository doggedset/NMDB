  "descriptionHtml": "By request, a revealing version of the leather armor! Thanks to TwilightStar for her inspiring comments and suggesting this armor!\r\n\r\nUpdate: The original optional underwear file was missing a piece, now updated to version 2 of that.\r\n\r\nCLIPPING WORKAROUND\r\n******************************\r\nWarning: If you use the main file only, the body will clip through the armor in a few places.  You can prevent all of this clipping by setting up the optional file, but it will take a bit of work.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the optional file is an alpha channel image that needs to be applied to the female body texture to make certain parts of it transparent (the parts that are clipping).\r\n\r\nSo, you\\'ll need to edit the following file to add the image as an alpha channel:\r\n\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female\\\\femalebody_1.dds\r\n\r\n(I bet 99% of you are already using a body texture mod, and if so you\\'ll have this file in your data folder.)\r\n\r\nYou can open and save the dds file with Photoshop with the nVidia dds plugin; or, I\\'ve heard there\\'s also a plugin for GIMP (a free image editing program).  To add the alpha channel in Photoshop, go to the Channels pallette and click \\'Create New Channel.\\' A new channel with the default name \\'Alpha 1\\' will be created.  Paste this image into it, save, and you\\'re done.  (I\\'m not sure about the exact steps in GIMP, but it\\'s probably similar.)\r\n\r\nThere are a couple reasons why I\\'m not just providing a skin texture with the alpha already added.  First, I myself use other people\\'s skin texture mods, which I don\\'t have permission to alter or redistribute.  Second, even if I did, you quite likely may be using a different one than I am, so getting mine wouldn\\'t be very useful to you anyway.\r\n\r\nSo, a bit of a pain, but hopefully worth it.  I actually like how this turned out, though I went into it not really knowing what I was going to do with it.\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL FUR THONG\r\n****************************\r\nIf you\\'d like to use underwear with this: well, so far no one has released independent meshes for underwear (as far as I know), so again it will be a bit of work to edit whatever skin textures you\\'re using.  I\\'ve provided photoshop files with layers that you can put over those.  So, you would have to use Photoshop or GIMP to add those.\r\n\r\nNote that, on the msn file, the layers use various blending modes.  The easiest way to copy them to your main msn file with the modes intact is: in photoshop, open both the underwear layer file and your main dds file; select the layer you want to copy, and then in the layers palette, click the triangle for the flyout menu and click \\'Duplicate Layer...\\' A window pops up; in the Destination section, pick your dds file from the dropdown list.  (Not sure about GIMP, hopefully it\\'s something similar.)\r\n\r\n(The diffuse file there also contains the clip-preventing Alpha, so you could add that while you\\'re at it.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
