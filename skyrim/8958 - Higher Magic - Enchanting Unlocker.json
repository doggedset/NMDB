  "summary": "Unlocks the restrictions of enchanting, allowing you to put enchants on more pieces of gear. \r\nVersion 1.1 now out. Updates :)",
  "descriptionHtml": "Long Story short. I have added other pieces of gear to the lists, allowing you to put enchants on gear you don\\'t normally have the ability to add them to. (ie: Muffle on a ring, or a helm)\r\nThat is all this does. Short, sweet, to the point.\r\nEnjoy :)\r\n===========\r\n\r\n1.1 is out now! \r\n\r\nUpdates :\r\n\r\nAdded a vendor in Winterhold Inn to sell & train enchanting items (+ a few other things).\r\nAdded disenchant ability to a number of items.\r\nAdded Enchant possibility to a number of items.\r\n\r\nYes, this includes :\r\nThief Guild armor\r\nDark Brotherhood Armor \r\nNightingale armor\r\n... a number of other things\r\n\r\nSee the text file to see a full list of what I changed, why I changed what I did, and why I left what I left alone\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n1.2 Updates\r\n\r\nAdded a Enchanting Station in the Frozen Hearth (in Winterhold). It is in Nelacar\\'s Room.\r\nAdded a Cure Disease Spell, for Sale, to Brenda\\'s Wares.\r\nAdded Armor Tokens with a few of the more obscure enchants on them for sale to Brenda\\'s Wares.\r\nAdded blank Armor tokens for sale to Brenda\\'s Wares.\r\n\r\nPermitted disenchanting of several weapons that were not Daedric rewards\r\n\r\nAllowed Disenchant of \\\"Dragonbane\\\" swords from the blades.\r\n\r\nNew Weapon Enchants : \r\n\tDragonBane : Added Damage to Dragon Health\r\n\tDragonDrain : Added Damage to Dragon Health & Magic\r\n\r\n\t(Yes, these are the same as the Dragonbane sword, but broken up)\r\n\r\nArmor Token enchants available include :\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nBackstab\r\nCarry Weight\r\nMuffle\r\nNighteye\r\nUnarmed\r\nWater Breath\r\nFire Cloak\r\nFrost Cloak\r\nShock Cloak\r\nPoison Cloak\r\n\r\n\r\nObvious Question you are probably asking...  : What Are Armor Tokens?\r\n\r\nArmor tokens are lucky charms of a VERY small size. So small, in fact, that they are effectively nothing weight wise, not even as long as a lockpick. They have no physical representation on your character, and they have no weight factor to them. You can have multiple of them on you, and wander around as you like with them. Due to their INCREDIBLY small size, they have no armor value, but they are able to be enchanted with armor enchantments, hence their name \\\"Armor Tokens.\\\" Note : They also do not take up a armor slot, due to their small size.\r\n\r\n=====\r\n",
