  "summary": "A small re-texture mod that makes the pick-able plants easier to spot while they still naturally fit in the environment. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a mod for people who likes the scenery of Skyrim, but wants it to be a bit easier to find the \\'pick-able\\' plants. This small mod makes all the flowers and plants that spawned in the nature easier to find because of enhanced color correction.  I tried my hardest to make it so they still fit in the nature, so it doesn\\'t look \\'cartoonish\\' \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nDownload the .rar file and use a program like WinZip/WinRar to extract the folders to your \\'skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\' folder.\r\nIf you don\\'t have a texture folder, just make one. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\nFeedback is highly appreciated, it helps me improve! :) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-If you see any plants that isn\\'t easy enough to see, or are too colorful let me know in the        comments or by message, so I can improve it. \r\n-I\\'m also doing requests for recoloring textures etc, so let me know the same way as above if  you have any requests. \r\n-Readme includes change-log, to do list and uninstalling guide. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese plants & pick-able items are re-textured\r\nBirdnest\r\nChickennest \r\nCreepclusters\r\nDeathbell\r\nGiant lichen\r\nNirnroot\r\nLavender\r\nMountainflower (Red, blue & purple)\r\nNightshade\r\nSlaughterfish egg\r\nSnow berry\r\nSwamp fungal \r\nThistle\r\nTundra Cotton\r\nBeehive\r\nMora tapinella \r\nChauruseggs and eggsack\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
