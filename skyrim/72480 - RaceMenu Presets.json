  "descriptionHtml": "Hello,\r<br />\r<br />Just as the title says, I have uploaded a couple of my RaceMenu presets.\r<br />To be exact: there is 30 of them, although they do not differ from each other that much. They are all a mix of three different noses and ten different eyes. \r<br />Hopefully you will find at least one of them to your liking.\r<br />\r<br />Just few important things that needs to be pointed out:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][u]Your character will NOT look exactly like mine even if you use those presets. They just won&#39;t.[/u] In order for them to look exactly like mine, you would also have to use [u]exactly [/u]the same textures, ENB and most probably even the same lighting mods as I do. As I use an edited versions of readily available mods - it is not probable that you will use the exact same ones mods and edited them in exactly the same way.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][u]Hair/brows/makeup can change the impression of any preset drastically[/u]. If you don&#39;t like any of them then try to change a hair or add a makeup - who knows, maybe you will find one of my presets usable after all?\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]If you don&#39;t like my presets and you feel like you absolutely have to share that with others, feel free to comment, but it will not change much anyway. I do not plan any updates or changes and I doubt I will look into comments too much. I simply uploaded the presets that I use, because why not.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]They were all [u]created while using Nord race[/u]. I am not sure if they will work on other races nor have I ever tried to, but somehow I doubt they will. Things are rarely so easy.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][u]In the bottom-right corner of each image you can find the name of the preset [/u](i.e N1E12, N2E16 etc.) - the preset files in the uploaded archive have exactly the same names.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Finally, below you can find a list (more or less) of mods I have used:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Hair: KS Hairdos\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Eyes: The Eyes of Beauty\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Brows: SG Brows\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Textures: A mix of SG Textures and UNP Creamy\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Makeup/Tintmasks: The ones included in the Ningheim race\r<br />[/list]\r<br />And quite obviously: [u]RaceMenu[/u].\r<br />\r<br />Like all RaceMenu presets, the files should go to: &#34;Data&#92;SKSE&#92;Plugins&#92;CharGen&#92;Presets&#34;, or in case of ModOrganizer: &#34;overwrite&#92;SKSE&#92;Plugins&#92;CharGen&#92;Presets&#34; (or wherever you keep your presets).\r<br />\r<br />Also, I don&#39;t think it needs to be said, but RaceMenu is quite obviously required to use any of those presets...\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy. :)",
