  "modName": "Morrowind music - day music replacement",
  "summary": "This is a very small and nice mod that basically replaces all the Skyrim day soundtracks with Morrowind ones. Nostalgia stroke me, so i decided to do such addon. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "[u]*This mod will replace all the day music with Morrowind tracks, also replaces the main menu theme with Morrowind theme. [/u]\r<br />[u](Doesn&#39;t replace dusk, night and cities music [b]yet, [/b]but that&#39;s surely gonna change)[/u]\r<br />\r<br />*It&#39;s a very simple mod made mainly with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8303/?]Skyrim Audio Converter[/url] by JohnB, so lots of thanks to him for creating that tool. \r<br />\r<br />*There is a preview video in the videos section, featuring &#34;Dance of Swords&#34; track.\r<br />\r<br />*Of course, all the music tracks belong to Bethesda, I made this mod only for fun, to bring some good and old Morrowind into Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />*As for requirements, I don&#39;t think you need anything else besides the Skyrim itself (that&#39;s pretty obvious)\r<br />\r<br />*If time allows, I&#39;ll try to update this mod and replace even more Skyrim tracks with Morrowind or maybe even Oblivion music. \r<br />[u]\r<br />*Installation - simply put the folder &#34;music&#34; into your Skyrim Data folder. It won&#39;t overwrite anything, unless you downloaded other music replacing mods. To uninstall delete the folder &#34;music&#34; from data.[/u] \r<br />\r<br />*Also, this is my first mod. If there are any copyright problems, contact me and I will immediately remove the mod. ",
