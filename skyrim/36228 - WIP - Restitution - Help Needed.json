I am currently seeking help in any form or fashion, considering I am still learning all that there is to learn about modding Skyrim.\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nHow to get to Restitution\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nYou can enter Restitution by the gate just before Chillfurrow Farm near Whiterun or by hitting the console command (~) and typing \\\"coc RestitutionStart\\\" without the quotations.\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\nThings Completed\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n3/4 Of the Island\r\nEntry hall\r\nThrone Room (Great Hall)\r\n\r\nThings I Would Like To Do\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n-I would like to add a short quest that involves passing four trials, Strength, Courage, Honor and Judgement. Each trial should be short, but challenging.\r\n-I would also like to add a quest line involving the ship in the dock in some way or another. Something similar to the Moonpaths mod, maybe?\r\n-Add and furnish rooms, including master. (Would like to figure out how to make an aquarium for the master bedroom as well, so if you have any ideas it would be much appreciated.) \r\n-Add training room, Alchemy room, Enchanting Room Blacksmith Room and Display room.\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\nHow to Install\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\nDownload with Nexus Mod Manager and install with mod manager\r\nOr\r\nDownload and Unzip files into your Skyrim program folder, under Data. Then run Skyrim and choose \\\"Restitution\\\" as a data file.\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs I said this is a WIP mod and anything is up for alteration/removal. All ideas are very much appreciated, and any and all help would be wonderful! Please don\\'t hesitate to contact me if you want to help out with this project!\r\n",
