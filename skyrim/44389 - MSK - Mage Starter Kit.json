  "descriptionHtml": "A small addition to the game in which spells and robes have been added to the Warden\\'s Chest in Helgen Keep.\r\n\r\nWere you ever disappointed with the lack of Mage items at the start of the game? I was. You only start off with two spells - which isn\\'t enough to diversify the player\\'s interest in other magic schools. Well, there is the Sparks Tome in the dungeon cage, along with some robes, but that is it. If you want to get new spells, you have to pay for them later in the game, which can be expensive at lower levels.\r\n\r\nAnd so, this Mod was born from that depressing fact. Hurray!\r\n\r\nContained within the Warden\\'s Chest there is at least one Spell Tome from each magic school, a few soul gems, a complete set of Imperial Light armor (it always annoyed me how there were no bracers) and an Iron Sword. But wait, there\\'s more!\r\nOn top of the chest, there are some Blue Hooded Robes, Monk Boots, Scroll of Fireball, Two Blue Mountain Flowers and a Giant\\'s Toe!\r\n\r\nDevelopment: There are now 2 options for this mod, Option A includes everything above, and Option B includes everything + robe enchantments. So hard to choose...\r\n\r\nInstallation is rather simple, check the ReadMe contained within the mod for details.\r\n\r\nDue to the simplicity of the Mod, it should be compatible with every damn mod in the Universe that doesn\\'t change the Warden\\'s Chest in any way. It is even compatible with SkyRe, check the images above.\r\n\r\nHave fun kids,\r\nPorkiousMaximus",
