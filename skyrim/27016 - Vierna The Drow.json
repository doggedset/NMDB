For hundreds of years, the drow slowly built their own society in the underground world they call the \\\"Underdark\\\"* until they finally built walls strong enough to repel their fallen cousins, the falmer.\r\n\r\nVierna, a young drow woman who existed since the time of the Oblivion Crises, had a small part in building this society in the Underdark, even though she has secretly done harm to it by serving bitter yet rich individuals as an assassin. Hoping to gain the favor of his own race, a once trusted client betrayed Vierna by revealing her identity as an assassin, and was banished from the drow city**, to die by the hands of the Underdark itself. However, with her own skills as an assassin, she survived the trials and made it to the surface world, where she waited for many weeks until her eyes adjusted to the sunlight.\r\n\r\nFor two years she wondered around a piece of the surface world called Skyrim, searching for opponents worthy of her bow and blade. She even occupied her time by fulfilling contracts from the Dark Brotherhood, being one of their most valued members. Over these two years she has gained both fame and infamy to the point where, when rumors began to spread about the coming of the dragons, she was believed to be the Dragonborn. Vierna herself heard these rumors and became increasingly interested in the Dragonborn and, even more so, the dragons. To this day, she continues to wonder around Skyrim, searching and waiting for the one they fear, in pursuit in fighting by his/her side and becoming a dragon hunter\r\n__________\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f377/TomAraya1981/vierna2_description.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nVierna is one of my characters and i decided to make her available as a [b]STANDALONE[/b] follower mod based on the Drow Beta race by zazemel.\r\n[color=#8AFB17]She\\'s an assassin based follower with her own perks, her own enchanted weapon (bow: fire damage. It become a fire explosion on critical hits) and enchanted light armor.[/color] Bows are her own master weapons, but she\\'s good on 1 handed as well.\r\nShe\\'s player leveled, so if you are looking for a \\\"cheat follower\\\", she\\'s not for you.\r\nshe\\'s essential and marriageable.\r\n\r\nTake in mind few things:\r\nFirst: she\\'s unique and she\\'s not a forgotten realsm drow!\r\nSecond: Drows doesn\\'t have yellow eyes? well...Drows usually doesn\\'t have lavender eyes as well...but one well known drow got them.\r\nso, i don\\'t want to read things and comments arguing about those things.\r\nTake in mind a simple rule: if you like it, feel free to download my mod and enjoy it...If you don\\'t like it, go on and download something else. There are tons of other cool followers around.\r\nI just wanted to share something i like with you and I\\'m not here to become popular or for endorsements.\r\n\r\n[color=#f62217]Location:[/color]\r\nSleeping Giant Inn (Riverwood)\r\n\r\n[color=#f62217]Possible Issue - Notes:[/color]\r\n- possible neckseam if you use skimpy armors on her. She has not born with those armors in mind...\r\n- [b]It could happen that vierna is hiding somewhere (well not showing herself in the Sleeping Giant inn). if that thing happen, be sure to patch your game to the last version[/b]\r\n- Vierna armor is not playable, so if you try to \\\"steal\\\" it Vierna will get naked and you\\'ll get nothing.
