  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r\n===========\r\nI like dogs as followers. I like foxes. I changed ALL dog followers into foxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nI saw a request somewhere for the follower dogs to be changed into foxes, thus this mod. All I did was change the outward appearance of all follower dogs, (Stray Dogs, Vigilance, and Meeko). Nothing else was changed. Yes, the foxes bark, sit, scratch, take a quick... uh... fox nap; everything the follower dogs did. They have all the same interactions, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you have a problem with the foxes barking, you can always remove their bark sounds. There is a mod out there somewhere that does that.\r\n\r\nThey have their mouths open most of the time as the dogs pant with their mouths open a lot. It is just more noticeable with the fox model.\r\n\r\nAlso, I changed Meeko to be a Snow Fox, because I wanted to have one of those, too.\r\n\r\nThis mod doesn\\'t change the fox texture. The texture in the screenshot is from the awesome mod Real Foxes by Ichibu.  HIGHLY recommended!\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Seen On Youtube!\r\n===================\r\nThis mod is featured in the awesome Skyrim Mods Series on Youtube #30!!\r\nCheck it out (right around the 4:00 mark) here:\r\n[youtube]OJwXeLE8TGI[/youtube]\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\nSimply extract the file \\\"DogCompanionsToFoxes.esp\\\" into your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\nJust remove the \\\"DogCompanionsToFoxes.esp\\\" from your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nThis mod will conflict with any other mod that modifies the DogCompanionRace.\r\n\r\nAny other mod that uses the DogCompanionRace as a basis for their Dog Companions, will now have their dogs turned into foxes. However, most of them SHOULD be self-contained, so actually shouldn\\'t conflict much.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nNot really a bug or issue, but the foxes use the dog sounds on purpose.  Foxes DO actually bark.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0, 2012/03/10 - Initial release.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim, the best game ever.\r\nThanks to NexusMods.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\nThanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\r\nThanks to r1de for testing these little critters for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nTESVSnip \r\nConstruction Kit\r\nReadme Generator\r\n\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nDo NOT upload this mod to the Steam Workshop.  Not a fan.\r\nOtherwise, you can do whatever you want with this mod but all I ask in return is that you give me credit if you distribute any part of this mod. I would also like to know what mods are including my work.",
