  "descriptionHtml": "Changelog(I guess I\\'m making one of these)\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n-removed \\\"slow\\\" effect because it didn\\'t do anything\r\n-removed decrease in magicka regen because it wasn\\'t affected by intelligence\r\n-added decrease in pickpocket and lockpick\r\n-added effects to unique item \\\"Kordir\\'s Skooma\\\"\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo-do(once the creation set comes out)\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n-finish the effects of increased speed(make player faster)\r\n-finish the effects of decreased agility(sneak and archery)\r\n-finish the effects of decreased intelligence(conjuration, alchemy)\r\n-make effects of decreased intelligence permanent\r\n-add addiction and withdrawal effects\r\n-lower the price\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSince modding is about the community, I have a question for anyone reading this: mysticism was affected by intelligence as well, how do you think this should be handled? If there\\'s no strong consensus in any one direction, I\\'ll be decreasing all schools that the spells were relocated to by a small amount.\r\n\r\nApplies the same drugged effect as Sleeping Tree Sap. I wanted to bring back to the clumsy powerhouse type effect as well, so I boosted 2h, 1h, stamina, and heavy armour in lieu of a strength attribute. I decreased magicka in lieu of intelligence, and increased light armour to simulate an increase in speed. To simulate the agility decrease, I\\'ve decreased pickpocket and lockpick.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'ve got any ideas at all, leave a comment. As far as I know, the creation set is necessary for all of the changes in the to-do list. I can\\'t find an already existent decrease/increase effect for anything listed in there, so if you know of any way to create those effects sans CS, let me know.\r\n\r\nDo whatever the fuck you want with this, I made it in 10 minutes, but I this is the only one I know of so give me credit.",
