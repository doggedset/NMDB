  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Comic Sans MS][size=6]Take a Leek[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[/center]I like vegetable soup. It gives you a handy buff and, as a user of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51473/?]iNeed[/url], I&#39;ve always got some grub on me. Problem is that of the four ingredients, one is surprisingly difficult to find. It never appears in containers, like those barrels and sacks scattered about towns and bandit camps.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds leeks to the leveled lists responsible for placing food in containers. That&#39;s all it does. You&#39;ll find leeks in those food barrels about as often as you find potatoes, cabbages and tomatoes. There shouldn&#39;t be any issues with compatibility or load order.\r<br />\r<br />Here is a picture of a leek:\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130928142120/cloudywithachanceofmeatballs/images/4/41/Leek_lm_v4-thumb-250x416-15673.jpg[/img]",
