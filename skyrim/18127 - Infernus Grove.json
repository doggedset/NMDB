  "descriptionHtml": "A small cave that was a player\\'s home, now left abandoned.\r\nI created this cave in my name, that others can see what I enjoy doing in Skyrim and loot my valuables.\r\n\r\nI will be adding a Tamrielic Ingredients version of this mod, which will use some of the ingredients from that mod as well as default as I enjoy both equally.\r\n\r\nAny information regarding where it is, refer to the images.\r\nI\\'ve included my ring that I enchanted, nothing OP.\r\n\r\nSome may find the amount of ingredients a bit heavy, same with the soul gems. I hoard ingredients and soul gems everywhere I go. I drop my weapons and armour just to keep them. So I think it portrays me alright.\r\n\r\nVideos:\r\nonlyDistort made a short YouTube review here;\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL0q6jA5Omc\r\n\r\nAny criticism would be taken well, thank you.",
