  "summary": "Adds a mediumish sized manor style home on the south shore of the Riften lake.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a cozy manor-style home with a great lakeside view in the Riften area. You can find it by traveling along the Southeast road from Ivarstead. This house has all the player amenities(alchemy table, enchanting table, smithing area) and plenty of display space. It also is navmeshed so your pets/companions/followers should be able to move about freely.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Acquiring the House\r<br />\r<br />There is a tiny chest located on the ground behind the right stone brazier with the key to your manor inside.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation\r<br />\r<br />1. Move Aspenspiremanor.esp to your Skyrim&#92;Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />2. Move the AARS folder into your Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Meshes folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Potential Future Updates\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m not sure if I will come back to this mod or not, but if I were to do that(probably depending on feedback) here are some things that have \r<br />the potential to be added:\r<br />\r<br />bathing room/sauna\r<br />extra bedroom\r<br />secret display room\r<br />exterior garden\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Additional\r<br />\r<br />This is my very first mod with the Creation Kit so I apologize if it is glitchy/buggy/doesn&#39;t work correctly. I sincerely hope that it does work for you \r<br />and that some people will enjoy it or even call it their own home^.^ I had a lot of fun building this and many many challenging design decisions. I also\r<br />learned a ton about the creation kit in the process. Hopefully I&#39;m on my way to bigger and better mods&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Thank you to Blary for his wonderful &#39;OpenBooks Resource&#39; mod also found on the Nexus that provided a little extra flair to my rooms.\r<br />",
