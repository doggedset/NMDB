  "descriptionHtml": "I always thought the vanilla magic in skyrim was kinda boring. If you wanted a higher level spell, you had to use a certain type. I made this mod to allow you to choose the spell type you like. It adds more spells such as fire/frost/shock spells that you hold down, shoot, place runes, etc. Use the kind of magic you want! \r\n\r\nIf you are worried that the spells might be overpowered/underpowerd, then do not worry. I used a magicka calculator, so if you use a strong spell, be prepared to have your magicka drained super fast. \r\n\r\nAnyone who sells spells will sell the spells added by this mod privided your spell proficiency is a high enough level. Ex. as soon as you become an apprentice in destruction you can buy the spells electrocute, blaze, etc. \r\n\r\nThere is a small glitch where it does not say the correct level for each spell. Even though a spell may say novice, it could be apprentice. You can tell which proficiency it is by looking at the damage. If its damage is close to 50, its adept, close to 75, expert, and so on. Still looking into this bug. I have just learned how to fix the bug and am working on it. Update coming.\r\n\r\nCompatible with USKP, all dlc, and all unofficial dlc patches.",
