  "descriptionHtml": "Not much to say about him. He is a friend of mine for many years and I decided I would make him, another friend, and my fiance to be my companions. Since he normally plays females I think he might find this amusing. Adam......This is you. If anyone does download this for some strange reason, you can find him at the nice famous inn in Whiterun.\r\n\r\nHe is a dual wielding Imperial. He looks like a monk since well... He almost is one in real life. The only difference is he is not a monk. He is just a martial artist kick ass person who isn\\'t afraid of no dragon!\r\n\r\n\r\nOhh and I would put up images.. but for some reason I seem to fail at getting images uploaded so until I can figure out how to do this I have an Imgur link below..\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/F2tQ3Iz,erd9XAm,NTUi26F,n4HhJdS#0\r\n\r\nThis is just a few pictures of him. Again you can find him in the Nice little inn in Whiterun. Bannerd Mare? Ehh I don\\'t remember at this point.. but He should be there just wandering around doing his monk like things.",
