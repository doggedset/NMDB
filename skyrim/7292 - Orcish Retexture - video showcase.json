  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=lime]So I was playing skyrim last night and finally made myself an orcish armor... And guess what?\r\n\r\nI was kind of shocked by it. I imagined some shiny greenish good-looking armor but all i got was a dull and grey thing. So I made some changes to fit it to my expectations and voilà, here it is.\r\n\r\nI simply wanted to share this for everybody who was disappointed by it.\r\n\r\nAlso, I\\'ve made a little showcasing video because let\\'s be honest... noone wants to see those stupid side by side pictures. A real showcase is always better\r\n\r\nCurrently done:\r\n- All orcish weapons\r\n- Male orcish armor\r\n- Female orcish armor\r\n\r\nI think everything has been done now. But if there are requests, ill sure do them. [/color]\r\n\r\n[Color=FF0000]IMPORTANT: I\\'ve also attached a bat file wich allows you to cheat the whole armor.\r\nHow to: Simply open the console (§) and type: bat orcish\r\n\r\nThere you go. The armor should now be in your inventory. Of course you can still build it yourself ;)[/color]\r\n\r\n[size=5][Color=FFD700]Here\\'s the video showcase (INSTALLATION VIDEO is at the end)[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[youtube]pfuxWgb1rqU&feature=youtu.be[/youtube]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Color=cyan]#Installation without video:\r\n\r\n1.)Download the main file to where you want\r\n2.)Extract the file to your main Skyrim directory\r\n3.) Enjoy\r\n\r\n#Deinstallation\r\n\r\n1.) Search up your skyrim/data/textures folder\r\n2.) delete the folder wich you want to delete\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: delete --> Skyrim/data/textures/armor/orcish\r\n\r\nThis will delete all your orcish texture mods.\r\n\r\nNO SERIOUSLY GUYS IF YOU *DO* LIKE THIS MOD:\r\nEndorse it! Not enough people do, largely due to the requisite elapsed time for an endorsement. It adds an element of memory and effort that many users simply do not commit to. And I can understand that - I\\'m not blaming you, and you know who you are. I used to be the same way and, sometimes, to my great shame, I still am.\r\nI\\'m told if you use the download manager it\\'ll give you reminders. That sounds super-great to me!\r\nAlso submit pictures of your character wearing my retexture! I love seeing stuff like this![/color]\r\n\r\n[color=red]I DO accept requests aslong as it is a texture mod. I don\\'t do meshes.. obiously because i started modding some days ago..\r\n\r\nBut I\\'m still happy to get messages to mod some textures. Keep me busy people![/color]\r\n\r\n-GeezasMods[/center]",
