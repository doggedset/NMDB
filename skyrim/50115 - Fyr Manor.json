When you first start up the game, a special glowing ball will spawn in front of you. Pick it up, and equip it to be taken to the entrance of Fyr Manor, enter, then talk to Serve (the console with the two lights).\r<br />To unlock new rooms, you must find &#39;room modules&#39; out in the world. Server will give you a list of where they might be if you ask him, and you can find an example module next to his box.\r<br />Once you have found a server module, take it back to Fyr Manor and place it in the server box (the big barrel in the foyer). You may then hook up that room.\r<br />Additional patches, that is, the Hearthfire and Dawnguard Plugins, must be loaded [b]AFTER[/b] the Fyr_ManorBase.esp mod. \r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY AND NOTES:\r<br />___________________________________\r<br />This mod is compatible with a vast majority of mods. All it truly adds out in the world is a platform near Dawnstar (between Ysgramor&#39;s tomb and the tower stone). Mods that add stuff at that exact location will, obviously, conflict.\r<br />This also modifies the marriage dialogue. If you have any mods that modify that (such as the &#39;spouses can live anywhere&#39; mod), load it AFTER Fyr Manor.\r<br />Otherwise, no other mods are known to conflict, since Fyr Manor is in Another Place.\r<br />Hearthfire&#39;s nursery does NOT support children from the get-go&#33; Modifying the scripts turned out to be far too risky.\r<br />Instead, use the multiple adoptions mod to make your adoptable kids able to live in the manor.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249/?[/url]\r<br />If you ask Server to hook up a room if you only have the first room (the bedroom), he will exist conversation. This is because he has no rooms to hook up. So go find a room.\r<br />\r<br />Changelog:\r<br />___________________________________\r<br />-1.01 Added additional mannequins and stands in the armory and hall of achievement, along with dragon priest displays.\r<br /> \r<br />CREDITS:\r<br />___________________________________\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/7017301/?]Opheuse[/url], for voicing Server.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1730967]Haishao[/url], for her models, testing, and general help.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1344637]Shippin[/url], for their Seht logo.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/258945/]InsanitySorrow[/url], for his barrel.
