  "descriptionHtml": "(NOTE: 1.2 IS NOW UP. THIS SHOULD FIX ANY CTD ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH HIM.)\r\n\r\nThis is my first release of any kind. I recently used that popular npc tutorial to make this character a follower, after quite a bit of effort. Now, let\\'s get down to it. Comments and Suggestions are appreciated! \r\n\r\nIsaac is a male nord follower that specializes in heavy armor and two handed weapons. His stealth is not very high at all, so I wouldn\\'t recommend taking anywhere that would require stealth or subtlety. You can find him in the Bannered Mare, wandering about near the back. He\\'ll probably start without his armor equipped, but if you have UFO, then you can just tell him that and he\\'ll don his armor. Keep in mind, I set him to a fixed level, which is the level I leveled him up to in his own game file, so he\\'s set to level 50 for now. An auto-level version is now up. Also, he is marriageable and is also set to be a bit taller than a high elf. You can use console commands to reset him to a normal height, if so desired.\r\n\r\n-Required Mods- These are mods you will need to get him to look exactly as he does in my Screenshots, outfit and all.\r\nApachii Skyhair By Apachii  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\nKnight of Thorns Armor by ZeroFrost http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18940\r\nWinter is Coming - Cloaks by nivea http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13486\r\nBetter Males by Chris57 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488\r\nThe Eyes of Beauty by LogRamm http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722\r\n\r\nThe ENB I\\'m using in the Screenshots is Synergy 1.2 by JoJoPineapples68, Which you can find right here:http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20741\r\n\r\n-Recommended Mods- Not necessary, but very nice to have.\r\nUFO ByfLokii http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037\r\nLively Followers by PrinceShroob http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23796\r\n\r\nIf you like him, go ahead and endorse! Add images as well, I\\'d love to see what adventures you all are taking him on.\r\n\r\nA big thanks goes to everyone in the required and recommended mods sections, as Isaac would not be what he is without them. Feel free to voice any problems that you come across and I\\'ll try to help. Oh, and if you decide to use Isaac in any kind of mod, please credit me with his creation. Thank you and enjoy!",
