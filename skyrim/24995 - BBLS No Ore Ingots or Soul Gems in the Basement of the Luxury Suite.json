  "summary": "For players who don\\\\\\'t like the idea of having free loot in a player home without working for it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "For everyone who can\\\\\\'t handle all the free ore, ingots, and soul gems in the basement of the Luxury Suite, this esp file will remove them all, and the useless hammers too. I can understand it gives a cheap advantage to new players to have all those resources, but some people don\\\\\\'t seem to be able to just ignore it if they don\\\\\\'t want to feel like cheaters.\r\n\r\nDO NOT activate this esp on a save made IN the basement; that will make you CTD. Activate it on a save out of the basement, then go and enter the basement, and it will all be gone.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not 100% sure, but it seems that de-activating this mod makes all those resources return, as if they were merely hidden. I have no idea if activating and de-activating this mod will restock your loot of you already used it up, but I doubt it.",
