Also added stagger effect to explosive arrow***\r\n\r\n\r\nRalen lives in the western part of The Rift, between Angarvunde and Heartwood Mill. Stop by and see him. If your archery skill is high enough, and you do a little favor for him first, he will agree to sell you his \\\"special\\\" arrows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nAdds some powerful new arrows to the game.\r\n\r\n- Explosive; A searing blast damages enemies within a small radius, chance of knockdown. Staggers oponents.\r\n- Frostburst; Cold-based, not as powerful as Explosive. No knockdown.\r\n- Knockdown; Enemies within a 10-15 foot radius are knocked down, taking a small amount of damage.\r\n- Reanimation; Bring your enemies (or friends) back to life. No explosion for this one.\r\n- Poision Gas; Releases a cloud of poision gas on impact.\r\n- Fire Bomb; Enemies and surrounding surfaces are covered in burning oil.\r\n- Proximity Blast: Think of it as a land mine... Use them to lay traps for your enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuto-aim correction is disabled (these arrows only), making near misses possible.\r\n\r\nAll arrows currently use the daedric arrow model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture plans:\r\n\r\n- None, unless someone is willing to do custom meshes & projectile anims. for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nExtract the files, and place Explosive Arrows.esp, sound folder, and .bsa file in \\\"The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim/Data\\\".\r\nActivate thru Data Files option in the launcher.\r\nOr install and activate with your mod manager of choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdating from previous versions:\r\nUninstall the old version, make a new save, and install the new version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nNone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommended:\r\nRealistic Ragdolls and Force - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=601\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\nNone known\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport:\r\nPlease post any issues in the official comment topic for this mod at Skyrim Nexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBethesda - For Skyrim and the Creation Kit\r\nThe Nexus Community - For support and inspiration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease do not upload this mod to other sites\r\n\r\nTranslation Permission - if you want to translate this mod into another language, YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE STEPS;\r\n\r\n1.
