It have small description and pictures from male/female on each race. \r<br />When you read the book you earn +1 speech. \r<br />\r<br />- Location of the book: \r<br />The book is in Whiterun, Farengar&#39;s study attached to the main hall of Dragonsreach, its in the table of the small room left when you enter the study. \r<br />\r<br />Very simple, but it toke me some time to learn and to make it. \r<br />I hope you like it. \r<br />\r<br />v1.1 Update 2014-03-15 \r<br />-Add Small description text after the name of the race. \r<br />-Add Description of each race between the characteristics and the pictures of each race. \r<br />-Small changes in the alignment of the text on some parts of the book. \r<br />\r<br />My other mod &#34;Skyrim Creatures Book&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Leave any comments you want, i would like that.",
