  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=#ff7700][size=3]DESCRIPTION[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />When you saw [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5866043/?]Shurah[/url]&#39;s combat and daily AI overhaul, were you forced to rip your favorite interior mod out of your load order so that you could finally watch NPCs behave like they would in a real city?\r<br />\r<br />Well, now you can have both non-robotic NPCs along with the clutter their new busy lives bring with them.\r<br />\r<br />This patch is made so that [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65013/?]Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul[/url] works with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5949431/?]iWil[/url]&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61237/?]Useless Shop Overhaul[/url] compilation.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65013/?]Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61237/?]\r<br />Useless Shop and Interior Overhaul[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]If you do not have both, you will crash on startup.[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][color=#ff7700]LOAD ORDER[/color][/b]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />Load order is VERY IMPORTANT. It should look like this:\r<br />\r<br />Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul.esp\r<br />iWil_UselessShopOverhaul.esp\r<br />My patch\r<br />Interior lighting mods (ELFX, RLO, etc.)\r<br />Lighting mod patches\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3][b]IMPORTANT NOTES[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This patch is made for the ENTIRE [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61237/?]Useless Shop Overhaul[/url] compilation, version 1.1. That version has reportedly fixed any deleted navmeshes.\r<br />\r<br />Sometimes, particularly in the Bannered Mare, NPCs will get stuck then jump from spot to spot to reach their destination. This is because the new interior layouts, along with the extra NPCs moving around the area (especially when using other population mods), make the area more cramped and more difficult for NPCs to navigate. To compensate for this, the game places the NPC where they are supposed to go so that they don&#39;t continually walk into other objects. I&#39;m sorry if this bothers you, but I don&#39;t think there is a way around it.\r<br />\r<br />I would also like to do a similar patch for the less-buggy [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77269/?]Skyrim Radioactive Glorified[/url] by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/21521784]SetteLisette [/url]sometime, but I&#39;m not sure what interiors would need patches and I don&#39;t think they have finished it yet.",
