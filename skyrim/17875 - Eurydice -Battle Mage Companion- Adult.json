  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/12989-1-1340985253.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n[b][size= 4][color= mediumseagreen]My initial plan was to simply make Eurydice a Wood Nymph that was more of a spouse than a combat companion. I kept playing with her settings and here we are, now she is a fairly strong Battle Mage that prefers light armor. To make things a little different she wields two handed swords, axes and spears with extreme prejudice. I will say that she has fast become one of my favorite companions as far as physical beauty and skills are concerned. I had also designed her to appear more natural (lighter makeup) and also to roam around topless but lack of topless armors here on the Nexus became an issue as far as conveying my plan in my screen shots (Oddly enough there are more topless UNP armors than CBBE armors). She is located at the Old Hroldan Inn south of Markarth and north west of Rorikstead.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[size= 4][b][color= red]Updated 07/19/12: I added two Essential versions and all files are now at 50% scaled weight so they are compatible with most bodies available.[/b][/color][/size]\r\n \r\n[b][size= 2][color= ghostwhite]\r\nRace: Breton\r\nHair: Light Blonde\r\nEyes: Dark Blue\r\nWeight: 120\r\nHeight: 5\\'2\\\" to 5\\'4\\\"\r\nLocation: Old Hroldan Inn\r\nRequired File:\r\nHair: Apachii Version 1.3\r\n\r\nOptional Files: To make her look like she does in my images\r\nEyes: Natural Eyes by Nevenbridge: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3589  \r\nI used Bella\\'s Better Females, Makeup variant 1 and No Shine (some pics) on her in combination with pretty lips by Danariel\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1167\r\nDarker Feminine Brows by Caliente (CBBE) \r\nDirt to Beauty Marks (CBBE)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\nPretty Lips by Danariel\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1167\r\n\r\nHer body in my images is CBBEv3 with Navetseas body \\\"Feminine Arms and Toned Abs\\\" textures.

This was done by using the console to add the various armor pieces to her inventory. Type in console: help arms, pauldron, belt, bikini etc...
