  "descriptionHtml": "Updated to V3.6:\r<br />Requires all of the official DLC.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=4]Awesome Showcase By Frosty[/size][/color][/b] ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/1249190/?]laiilaiiheii[/url])\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]w_d8cJOWjDg[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />New features -\r<br />\r<br />3.6\r<br />\r<br />Added facegen data for npcs which was missing. Should fix any grayface issues.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]3.5 \r<br />\r<br />Added a new island to the ocean of time as well as a new hidden rift.\r<br />\r<br />Improved Navmeshing.\r<br />\r<br />Recipes should only show if you have a required item in your inventory.\r<br />\r<br />Challenge Tower Reward Chest should now respawn.\r<br />\r<br />Minor Fixes.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Expanded the island and added new creatures to it.\r<br />\r<br />Expanded the rift adding some new areas like a telvanni house that you can have and an ancient falmer temple. Plus secret hidden rifts.\r<br />\r<br />Added a staff enchanting station, bookshelf and new mannequins.\r<br />\r<br />Added new teleporting spells for the new areas as well as the house you get in Raven Rock from the Dragonborn dlc.\r<br />\r<br />Added two new transmutation spells one lets you change your ingots and the other turns coal into diamonds. Also added coal deposits near the ancient falmer temple.\r<br />\r<br />And finally I added a challenge area for higher level characters, fight your way through Ethros&#39; captives to the top and claim a powerful sword as a reward.\r<br />Changed it so the Paradox Katana is not as overpowered and is no longer craftable, the only way to obtain it is by killing Xera in the challenge tower.\r<br />\r<br />Updated to V2: Adds 9 new spells to Teleport: Breezehome,Hjerim,Proudspire,Vlindrel,Honeyside,DawnstarSanct,Flagon,College,Jorrvaskr.Can be made at a Tanning rack, Require Decorating guides for the homes, Something special from the other 4 places.\r<br />\r<br />Updated to V1.1: Hopefully this fixes the issue with missing doors that some of you had, if not let me know so I may investigate further on the matter. Semi Navmeshed not done though.\r<br />\r<br />Adds a New Home in the voids of time and space, complete with 4 working mannequins, 5 working weapon display cases, all crafting stations aside from smelter, 3 teleporting spells, a freeform quest. Though Followers wont enter the rift, they will wait outside in my experience , and I doubt they would teleport with you so be warned about having a follower and teleporting via the spells.  Navmeshing has always been a pain to me and as frustrating as it is I will try to add a near flawless as I can navmesh to the cells for followers.\r<br />\r<br />Go to the shack in the volcanic tundra and fight your way through then use the magic portal on the floor to enter the Temporal Rift. Pictures speak louder than words so have a look at the images section please.\r<br />\r<br />Please if there are issues let me know so that I may address them.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits: \r<br />\r<br />Phitt for the Cliffracers:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8579 \r<br />\r<br />muppetpuppet for the Trees: \r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10312\r<br />\r<br />Vicn for the giant ebony knight meshes:\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37413/?",
