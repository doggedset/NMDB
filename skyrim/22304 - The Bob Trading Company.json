  "descriptionHtml": "The location of the Merchants are as follows:\r\nDragonsreach\r\nPalace of Kings\r\nJarl\\'s Longhouse in Falkreath and Winterhold.\r\nMistveil Keep\r\nHighmoon Hall\r\nBlue Palace\r\nUnderstone keep\r\nand\r\nThe Whitehall.\r\nAlso, Images: I will get you some and should be there when V.3 is released. \r\n\r\nTo install just move the Esp to the data folder.\r\n\r\nC:/Programfiles/Steam/Commonapps/Steamapps/Skyrim/Data\r\nIs the directory.\r\nOk, to confirm anyone\\'s questions there is a version 3 planned where all the merchants will be less \\\"Unfair\\\" plus, adding a house for each merchant, making Krosis mask light as archers mainly wear light armour. Also, going to add other stuff. :) Maybe a merchant to each tavern in the small villages.\r\nI have had to halt production on version three for a bit until I aquire Dragonborn.\r\nAnd while I am waiting to aquire that, I will be working on two of my other mod ideas.\r\nAnd, I might even add screenshots.\r\nEnjoy version two till version 3 comes out.\r\nPlease email any bugs/errors to BobTheMerchant@Aberlehouse.us\r\n",
