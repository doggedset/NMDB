While you can use these, in order to let people keep the look of the kitchen, I included the option to leave those where they are and store milk in the big milk jug and flour in the flour crate.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n99/Shezrie/bullet_ball_glass_green_zps9d835971.png[/img] Designed for use with my Winstad greenhouse for the complete growing and cooking experience.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n99/Shezrie/LakeviewGreenhouseBanner_zps5ab050f8.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />[center][size=7][color=#38761D]Lakeview Greenhouse[/color][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n99/Shezrie/bullet_ball_glass_green_zps9d835971.png[/img] 22 dirt plots for planting.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n99/Shezrie/bullet_ball_glass_green_zps9d835971.png[/img] I added small chests, ingredients jars, barrels and baskets for extra storage.

Just remove the workbench from that room.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n99/Shezrie/bullet_ball_glass_green_zps9d835971.png[/img] For the greenhouses: Build the North Wing Storage Room at your workbench for Lakeview and Winstad. For Heljarchen, build the North Wing Trophy Room. Then remove the workbench for that room at your planning table. You do not need to build any furniture, just the walls, roof, floor etc.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n99/Shezrie/bullet_ball_glass_green_zps9d835971.png[/img] When you enter your home you will find that room furnished already.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n99/Shezrie/bullet_ball_glass_red.png[/img] This file has been cleaned with TES5Edit.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n99/Shezrie/PermissionsGreen_zpsa293948d.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n99/Shezrie/bullet_ball_glass_red.png[/img] This mod is to be hosted exclusively on Steam and Nexus and no where else.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n99/Shezrie/bullet_ball_glass_red.png[/img] Do not alter and re-upload any part of this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n99/Shezrie/bullet_ball_glass_red.png[/img] You must apply to the author of specific resources used in this mod, for permission to use their resources.
