  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Do you want to start the game at a specific point of the main quest line but still be level 1?Â [/b]\r<br />\r<br />This file contains different save files of the same character with no skill increases at all.\r<br />Currently, I have done 14 saves:\r<br />1: after the Intro\r<br />2: after Helgen\r<br />3: after Bleak Falls Barrow\r<br />4: after killing Mirmulnir\r<br />5: after High Hrothgar\r<br />6: after Ustengrav\r<br />7: after Sahloknir\r<br />8: after Thalmor Embassy\r<br />9: after Ratway\r<br />10: after Sky Haven Temple\r<br />11: after meeting Paarthurnax\r<br />12: after asking about the elder scroll\r<br />13: after mzark\r<br />14: after defeating alduin\r<br />\r<br />In each save file you have a variety of different loot at your disposal. (Check the chest in the Sleeping Giant Inn in later saves)\r<br />I have used all of the dlcs during the making of the saves, but you should not have any problems if you do not have them.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Go to your [i]documents - my games - Skyrim - Saved Games [/i]and drag the saves into the file.\r<br />If you want to change the looks, sex and race of your character, just open the console and write [i]showracemenu [/i]to bring up the character creation screen, or use a mod such as ShowRaceMenu Alternative (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20394/?) to be more safe.\r<br />\r<br />I have used no more blocky faces and detailed faces during the making of the saves, but you should be able to use the saves without these mods because they only change texture files.\r<br />\r<br />Please report any bugs and in which save game you found them",
