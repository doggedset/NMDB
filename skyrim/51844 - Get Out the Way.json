  "summary": "Move ____, get out the way&#33; Tired of NPC&#39;s blocking your path? Followers and pets boxing you in? Shove them out of the way&#33; This mod gives you a power that lets you knock anyone you sprint into over, so you can stop getting stuck by immovable NPC&#39;s.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r<br />    Simply put, this mod gives you a spell effect that activates when you sprint into an NPC. They will fall over, and while in their fall animation, you will be able to move through them. It was specifically designed so you can finally stop getting stuck.\r<br />\r<br />- Only active when sprinting\r<br />- Only active while weapons are sheathed (can&#39;t use it during combat)\r<br />- Only works on NPCs that are not in combat\r<br />- Simple fall over effect, no damage, and no hostile\r<br />- Just get the book and go.\r<br />\r<br />Where:\r<br />    To avoid conflicts with other mods, I have placed the books in two locations. One book can be found behind Heimskr in the Whiterun square. Just look up on the stone wall. The other is on the counter in Belethor&#39;s General Goods in Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />    You can also now find rings next to the books called &#34;Pimp Hand&#34;, which are enchanted versions you can equip and use that way. This is so you don&#39;t have to use the book, which is a permanent effect. You can disenchant the rings, but the enchantment will not use any conditions, and will always be on.\r<br />\r<br />    They are conveniently placed near NPCs you can test them on.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />    Drop the esp into your Skyrim/Data folder. There&#39;s no extra files, and no scripts involved in the setup process. You only need to use the book like a spellbook for the permanent effect.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall:\r<br />    There&#39;s no scripts or quests involved in the mod, so you can simply remove the esp at any time.\r<br />\r<br />FAQ:\r<br />\r<br />Q: Can you add...\r<br />\r<br />A: No. This is all I want to accomplish with this mod, I&#39;m not adding fancy animations, or quests, or scripts, or changing how the book works. If there&#39;s bugs, report them. Otherwise, don&#39;t request anything more than what is given, please.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I don&#39;t see any spell, what went wrong?\r<br />\r<br />A: Nothing went wrong. The spell effect is permanent and conditional, that&#39;s how Skyrim works. Begin sprinting with your weapon sheathed and pause, go to your spell effects list and you&#39;ll see the spell effect there. It will only be active while you sprint.\r<br />\r<br />Known Bugs:\r<br />- For some people, the book and ring next to Heimskr doesn&#39;t work. That&#39;s why it&#39;s in two locations.\r<br />- Disenchanting the ring will cause the effect to always be on with no conditions. This is a side effect of the disenchanting process.",
