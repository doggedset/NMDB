  "descriptionHtml": "Update: 09/08/2012\r\nAdded new version using the high res DLC textures, specular maps and bump maps. See further info below!\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]What is this and why it has been made:[/size][/b]\r\nI noticed  at several points during the nightingale chain that Nocturnal was represented by the color purple, and a dark purple/blue.\r\nI love the nightingale armor but I felt the details of it were lost in the sea of black.\r\nI didn\\'t want to do anything to flashy, but I felt a few accents here and there using the colors of Nocturnal might help to bring out this armor sets hidden beauty. \r\nThis is a simple adjustment to the existing textures (not a complete overhaul).\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6]File Details:[/size][/b]\r\n\r\n[b][size=4]High res DLC version:[/size][/b]\r\nThe download includes everything you need texture wise so you don\\'t *need* to have the DLC for this to work. or at least you shouldn\\'t in theory..(I recommend getting it any way if your computer can run it).\r\nI\\'ve included  my edited versions of both _m.dds and _n.dds (along with the emits although they weren\\'t touched).\r\nIf you cant use the high res DLC you *might* not be able to use this. although it is only one texture set. so use at your own discretion on lower end systems.\r\nThe screen shots of the new textures were taken using Skyrim enhanced shaders FX ENB presets with a few of my own tweaks. This set will appear much darker with darker style ENBs and appears very flat with no ENB.\r\n\r\n[b][size=4]\\\"HD\\\" version:[/size][/b]\r\nAll of the below but doubled in size. It looks a tad bit better than the vanilla ones. This was back before we had the DLC.\r\nThis is just and up scaling of the original textures including the _m.dds files. still uses the \\\"out of box\\\" textures as a base.\r\n\r\n[b][size=4]Vanilla version:[/size][/b]\r\n\\\"Out of Box\\\"  textures that came with the game when it shipped. Minor edits to the _m.dds files to fix some serious pixalation. Fixed a few artifacts on the texture as well. They look pretty bad in comparison to the new DLC version.\r\n\r\n\r\n[s]Currently it\\'s for females only, if enough people want it for males I\\'ll work out some more male oriented accent points.[/s]\r\n\r\nMatching Nightingale Bow!\r\nSee it, Love it, or hate it!\r\nSee the matching bow at http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1853\r\n\r\n\r\nChange log:\r\nUpdate: 11/26/11\r\nMale version added\r\nMade some modification to the female version and added in some more accents, still left the over all outfit black, it should still just \\\"hint\\\" that you\\'re a servant of Nocturnal.\r\nUpdate: 09/08/2012\r\nHigh res DLC version added.",
