  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u][size=6][color=#ffff00]The Hole[/color]\r<br />[/size][/u][/b] \r<br /> \r<br />This mod is a player house that is mostly storage area.\r<br />There are people that are scared of loosing their items if a dragon manages to destroy their house. While houses usually do respawn (or should at least) and interiors are NOT affected in any way, they still try to keep as much with them as possible. Even if it&#39;s silly to think this is needed.\r<br />\r<br />Still not convinced or not into the player homes as many other people offer?\r<br />Well this mod may be for you then&#33; This mod will offer you 2 beds and enough storage space without too much mess around or the space being too big to handle&#33; Also this mod will remain simple and clean&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=4][color=#ffff00]What does this mod offer?[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/u][/b][list]\r<br />[*][size=2]8 beds, 8 chairs[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]3 Armor containers + 1 for mod armors[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]1 Clothing container + 1 for mod clothing[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]3 Jewlery containers + 1 for mod jewlery[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]3 Weapon containers + 1 for mod weapons[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Simple trapdoor entrance with light so you can find it easier[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Waypoint marker for quick travel (of course&#33;)[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]ALL workbench types in the same area with 5 containers for your materials[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Fully nav meshed[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Candle light instead of everywhere very bright lights[/size]\r<br />[/list][size=2]\r<br />[/size][size=4][b][u][color=#ffff00]Required[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b][/size][list]\r<br />[*][size=2]Skyrim ([color=#ff0000][u]PC Vanilla game ONLY[/u][/color])[/size]\r<br />[/list][size=2]\r<br />[/size][color=#ffff00][size=4][b][u]How To Install[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Simply copy the ESP file to your SkyrimData folder, then activate it with the vanilla mod manager or any other mod manager of choice. This mod is NOT Nexus Mod manager enabled&#33; Please do not try it, it won&#39;t work&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=#ffff00][size=4]How To Uninstall[/size][/color][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Simply delete the ESP file from yourSkyrim Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][i]NOTE: Make sure you take your items first andsave your game OUTSIDE this mod&#33; If you do not, your game may get corrupted, loose items and more bad things&#33;[/i][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=#ffff00][size=4]Location[/size][/color][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />When you get out of the cave under the Helgen tower (you enter this tower after the first dragon attacks once you are done getting your character looks done), follow the road until the snow makes place for grass. On the right side should be a large tree stump with a torch stuck on it (newly added). This is the location of the entrance, no key or anything required. Pass the torch and keep it on your RIGHT SIDE, it should not take you more then a few steps before you see the entrance.\r<br />\r<br />The entrance is a hatch down, so in case you installed a mod that enhances grass you may not see it. It should be there though, just aim your cursor to the ground and start scanning&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=#ffff00][size=4]Origins Of The Mod[/size][/color][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />The mod started as a private safe space with loaded chests with all kinds of items in them. Also it was originally placed in another place (former location was within Riverwood). I restarted the mod to be released since more people wanted a simple room with not too much junk in it. So this mod became a fresh start to give just that.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=#ffff00][size=4]Bugs[/size][/color][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />- The lights may flicker, not sure what causes this. Likely a vanilla bug",
