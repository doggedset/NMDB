  "descriptionHtml": "Adds glowing fins to the Nordic Dragonbone Arrows found in AeonVita\\'s mod, Dragonbone Weapons.  However, it does not really require that mod, as an ESP has been included that replaces the vanilla iron arrow meshes with AeonVita\\'s meshes, modified with the glowing fins.  This ESP is only required if you do not have AeonVita\\'s Dragonbone Weapons mod - if you have that mod, no ESP is required at all (but you can still use it to replace the iron arrow meshes, too).\r\n\r\nThe fins (fletchings) glow a pale blue, making them a LOT easier to find in the dark.  The stats of the arrows (Nordic Dragonbone or Iron) are not effected in any way.  The arrows in the quiver glow as well, but don\\'t worry - enemies can\\'t see them!\r\n\r\n[color=red]There are now two versions, one with the glowing fins shown in the images above, and another with a small aura surrounding the fins.  I will upload images as soon as I can find them on my %&#$*(@* hard drive.[/color]\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nUse NMM, it\\'s so easy.  If you\\'re stubborn, just extract the zip, and drop the data folder into your skyrim directory (or the meshes and textures folders into your data directory).\r\n\r\nREMOVAL\r\n\r\nUse NMM, it\\'s so easy.  If you didn\\'t learn your lesson while installing, you should probably reinstall Dragonbone Weapons, which will overwrite these meshes with the original ones, and delete the ESP from this mod.\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\nAeonVita for the original meshes (all I did was turn on a few flags and add a glow map) and Tamara for the request.\r\n\r\nSIMILAR\r\n\r\nI\\'ve done several similar mods:\r\n  Daedric Arrows: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/42792/?\r\n  Nordic Arrows from Dragonborn: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/43433/?\r\n  Dragonbone Arrows from Dawnguard: (Haven\\'t uploaded yet)",
