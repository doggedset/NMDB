  "summary": "Gives gold coins weight.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I noticed that gold appears as a miscellaneous item and thought it would likely be very easy to give it some weight, a tweak that was *relatively* desired in Oblivion (for which the implementation was much more complicated, I believe). So, as my first little mod for Skyrim, I give you weighted gold.\r\n\r\nEach coin weighs 0.01 units, so 100 coins is one unit. This means that its displayed weight is 0, due to the game only displaying one digit past the radix point.",
