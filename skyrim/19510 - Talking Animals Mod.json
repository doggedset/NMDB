  "summary": "A Mod that makes animals talk.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A mod created by hashbrownforever (youtube name) which makes all of the animals in skyrim talk!!! The mod also enables you to give your items to animal companions like Vigilance to carry, and to give orders to animals like Vigilance (Which count as followers). There is no point to this mod :P and it is quite fun to have, as it makes your gaming experience on The elder scrolls 5: Skyrim more interesting. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy both the video and the mod, please check out my youtube channel at http://www.youtube.com/user/hashbrownforever\r\nand subscribe, so you can keep up to date with mods I release. I also do videos on other games, and do reviews etc ;)",
