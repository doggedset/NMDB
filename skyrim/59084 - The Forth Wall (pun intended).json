  "descriptionHtml": "   Is it a [i]psychedelic [/i]experience? A portal into another world? A twisted dream? Find the potion resting on the skyforge in Whiterun, take a drink, and decide for yourself&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />      ************************************\r<br />      Warning, this game breaks the forth wall and adds modern graphics to the game. All role play breaking content is isolated to a cave and will       not bleed through to the world on Skyrim.\r<br />      ************************************\r<br />\r<br />   The forth wall was created to add some enjoyment to the task of learning to use a 3d modeling program called blender. It features a ton of brand new graphics including thousands of individual blades of grass, leaves, a monster truck, and a ton of other cool new graphics made from scratch. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />            ++++++\r<br />            Credits\r<br />            ++++++\r<br />\r<br />   I would like to thank all the creators of the many free texture files found on Google image search. Without them the mod would not look as good as it does. I would also like to thank all the folks who contribute to Blender swap, a great resource for trading and sharing blender templates. I got my inspiration from many of their files, and even used a heavily modified template file for a couple of the models.",
