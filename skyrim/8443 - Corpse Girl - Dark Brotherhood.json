Visit the Night Mother in the Dawnstar Sanctuary for your new gift.\r\n\r\nv1.5:\r\nBack to daggers and a bow.\r\nHer weapons now level as she levels.  Her level = your level (her min lvl is 10).\r\n\r\nv1.4:\r\nRedid entire mod from scratch to hopefully remove all bugs.\r\nGave her a bow for ranged attacks.  Swords instead of daggers.\r\n\r\nHaven\\'t done the quest line but want to try her out?\r\nplayer.additem ##000D67 1   :: where ## is the mod index number.\r\n\r\nSimply put file in Skyrim data folder and enable it.\r\n\r\nThanks to LaserWerewolf for the ideas.",
