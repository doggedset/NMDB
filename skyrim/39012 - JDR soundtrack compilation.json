  "descriptionHtml": "NEWS - New version will replace the wav file format with xwm for better file compression so the download won\\'t take forever! and you will have more space on your pc....\r\n\r\nThis was a custom soundtrack add on which i originally made for myself but i decided to share it here and not be selfish.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds 8 new tracks composed by JDR composer, a freelance composer operating on youtube. Do not worry, this does not add crazy otherworldly trash music, these tracks (in my opinion) are (can i say lore friendly for music mods?!) very heavily centred on the tone of the vanilla game, and in fact uses samples from many of Jeremy Soule\\'s previous work on the elder scrolls games within the tracks. You will recognise many from Morrowind and Oblivion as you play. Each track runs for around 3-5 minutes so about the same time as vanilla score tracks.\r\n\r\nTHIS MOD IS NOT A REPLACER. it simply just adds a few extra hand picked tracks to the game which i feel mix well with the vanilla soundtrack as well as (for a few of them) adding a nice elder scrolls nostalgia feel from the previous games in the series.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nworks fine with mod manager  installation.\r\n\r\nOr unzip/extract files using winzip or winrar into the skyrim data directory: \r\n\r\nNon Steam: Skyrim/data\r\n\r\nSteam: C:/program files/steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data\r\n\r\nAll credits and praise go to jdr composer, i just made the mod. Here is a taster of a few of the tracks included in the bundle!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnAqBal891A&list=PL197982E4FC5A42DF\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrFERCfBpk0&list=PL197982E4FC5A42DF\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ycZOPe19Sk&list=PL197982E4FC5A42DF\r\n\r\n\r\nmost of these tracks are in the explore and town category so will only be played there  \r\n\r\nThanks and hopefully enjoy as much as i do!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
