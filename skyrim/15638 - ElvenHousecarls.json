  "descriptionHtml": "Nothing too epic, just changes appearances and races for housecarls.  Default outfits were removed so they wouldn\\'t respawn and fill inventories (which really annoys me) and default weapons were upgraded from steel to skyforge steel.  \r\n\r\nNot dependent on other mods, however, I recommend having the following installed as I had them running when I did this:\r\n\r\nBetter females by BellaGail found here:  \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nLightning blue vampire eyes by shoni89P found here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2002\r\n\r\nI have run all of them around and found no bugs so far in my gameplay.  (something I can\\'t say for the NPC I was building that went epic fail and inspired this)  \r\n\r\nTo install:  just download the esp file and copy to your data folder then make sure it\\'s checked in your data files when you play.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.",
