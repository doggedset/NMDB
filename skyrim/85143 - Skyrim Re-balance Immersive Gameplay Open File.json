  "descriptionHtml": "I made 3 years ago and never released it. So I don&#39;t remember quite what I did here. It might require some clothes mod. Might include some which received approval. I just don&#39;t remember and can&#39;t even check\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to edit and do with it as you wish.\r<br />I might get along to work on it a little bit more if people are interested.\r<br />If you take it and upload it somewhere else please credit me.\r<br />\r<br />Other than that have fun.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />What this mod does is make the combat more intense and realistic. By turning the world into unleveled and realistic place.  Recommend along with mods that add additional spawns.\r<br />[youtube]g7G1MdTtcOY[/youtube]",
