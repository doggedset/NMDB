  "descriptionHtml": "%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r<br />\r<br />Accessible Merchant Storage v1.4\r<br />by ObsidianFire\r<br />__________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Fellow Thieves&#33; Tired of looking at merchant&#39;s inventories and never being able to steal from them? You can now. AccessibleMerchantStorage brings the merchant chests into the shops so you can steal from them.\r<br />\r<br />Chests are master locked, but can be unlocked with the key to the shop. Merchants who work in keeps have had keys added to their inventories. The exception to the rule are the merchant chests in taverns. They are only locked at adept and have no keys.\r<br />\r<br />Merchants who work outside have had their merchant chests added to their houses. Their service factions have been redirected to these chests so stealing from them will impact what they sell.\r<br />\r<br />In order not to mes with the navmesh, chests have been placed in out-of-the-way places. Bookcases, stairwells, and corners are all good places to look.\r<br />\r<br />The Thieves Guild merchants&#39; and fences&#39; chests and the Kajiit Caravan chests are still not accessible. They&#39;re too smart for that&#33; The Froostmoon chest can be accessed, but there is no key for it; you&#39;ll need to pick it.\r<br />\r<br />Happy stealing&#33;\r<br />\r<br />%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues & Bugs\r<br />___________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Be careful what you steal. The money in the chests is the gold the merchant uses in transactions. If you steal that and barter with the merchant before the chest respawns, the merchant will not have anywhere near the amount of gold they should have.\r<br />\r<br />If some chests are not showing up, check to see if there are any mods later in the load order that effect the same cells. If there are, load this mod after those and see if it fixes the problem. This is the first mod BOSS loads as part of the Overide catagory, so all the other mods in that catagory are overiding this mod. Moving it to be later in the load order should be fine as almost no other mods effect the merchant chest locations.\r<br />\r<br />%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r<br />\r<br />Changelog\r<br />___________________________________\r<br />\r<br />v1.1\r<br />All merchant chests can now be stolen from. The chests are located in the houses of the merchants. There is one person who&#39;s chest is still located outside as they don&#39;t have a house. The chests are all have master locks and are keyed to whatever key opens the front door or whatever key is on the person.\r<br />\r<br />Moved Wuunferth&#39;s Merchant Chest from the main hall in Palace of the Kings to his room. His service faction has been changed accordingly.\r<br />\r<br />I found out that Adrianne has two different service factions and they both reference the same chest. This meant that there were some items you could buy from her that were not in the chest. To fix this issue, I put another merchant chest outside of Warmaidens and made one of the service factions reference that instead. So if what you&#39;re looking for isn&#39;t in the chest in the shop, it&#39;s in the one outside the shop.\r<br />\r<br />v1.2\r<br />Took all the keys I made out of the NPCs inventories and placed them in cells. They are all in the same area as the NPC who used to have them. Keys that were already in the game have not been changed.\r<br />\r<br />The locations of the chests are the same as in v1.1. This is not so much of an update as it is a way to minimize conflicts with other NPC altering mods. Personally, I prefer v1.1, but there were mods after this one that were causing the keys not to show up.\r<br />\r<br />v1.3\r<br />Looked at every single chest and moved all the ones that were intersecting with objects. (That&#39;s what I get for not turning markers on in the CK&#33;) I didn&#39;t bother making a version with keys not on the NPCs as TES5Edit is now out. I&#39;ve also cleaned this with the current version of TES5Edit (3.0.26), so there shouldn&#39;t be anything wrong there. This should be the final version.\r<br />\r<br />v1.4\r<br />Chests have been added for DLC. As with all chests, everything you take from the chests will be flagged as stolen. NPCs that have been changed have had the USKP changes added to them as well so those won&#39;t be overridden.\r<br />\r<br />%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r<br />\r<br />Installation\r<br />__________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Make sure you download the right file as the .esp files have the same name and will override each other.\r<br />\r<br />This mod just consists of an esp (and readme). Unzip it to the Data folder inside your Skyrim folder. Then open up the launcher, click on &#34;Data Files&#34; and check the box next to this esp.\r<br />\r<br />%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation\r<br />___________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Delete the esp from the Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />__________________________________\r<br />\r<br />BluePheinox for his BP Merchant Storage mod for Oblivion. It provided a good working model to follow.\r<br />\r<br />%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r<br />\r<br />Licensing/Legal\r<br />___________________________________\r<br />\r<br />As long as my name is part of the credits, an e-mail is appreciated, but not needed.",
