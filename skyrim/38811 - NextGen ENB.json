  "summary": "ENBSeries has some amazing effects found only in top notch brand-new 2013 games, such as specular lighting, ambient occlusion, depth of field, light adaptation, reflections and so much more.\r\nNow how come none of them show in all the ENB tweaks? If you want your game to be next gen quality because after all this is 2013, look no further than NextGe",
  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/4kzXFrJ.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSo basically I am a small time modder and have been modding since Skyrim first came out. So far I haven\\'t posted any mods because I was either selfish, or deemed the mods not good enough for the public. my modding is mostly code and texturing but not on a high end level.\r\nSo, Hurrah! Here is my first mod ever on the Nexus and anywhere!\r\nSkyrim is such an amazing game with so much content, and back in the day Bethesda has really done some amazing work with it.\r\nBut lets face it, no one is getting any younger, especially games, and this one is almost two years old and is having a tough time putting itself in par with other games\\' graphics, even though everyone still wants to play it for numerous other reasons.\r\nSo to mend this, Boris Vorontsov has created ENBSeries, a tool to make everything better! (basically).\r\nSo what I did is take his amazing creation, and maximize it for Skyrim for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Q5EBwXV.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nVERSIONS:\r\nNextGen ENB - Includes all possible ENB features on the highest quality with minimal performance loss possible.\r\n\r\nNextGen Low-End PC - Same general effect and colours, includes 90% of ENB effect, low quality effects not extremely noticeable with an extreme FPS boost from regular version... A bargain.\r\n\r\n(P.S this enb\\'s version [0.195] will be updated with the ENBSeries releases and updated appropriately with new features from Boris Vorontsov)\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:\r\n1. You will have a performance hit, but it will not be terrible.\r\n2. Since I run this with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 660 so I will consider this as the minimum requirement.\r\n3. With my sort of poor card the game runs at 60+ FPS + and 40 at the markarth \\\"death point\\\".\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\r\nENBSeries by Boris Vorontsov version 0.193 as it is not included with this mod:\r\nhttp://www.enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.htm\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\nCopy ENBSeries files to the /Skyrim folder, then copy over my files, replace when prompted.\r\nTo install one of the optional files simply replace the enbseries.ini file with the one that comes with the default mod.\r\n\r\nRECOMENDED MODS:\r\n\r\nSkyrim HD - 2K Textures\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/607//?\r\n\r\nClimates of Tamriel\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17802//?\r\n\r\nEnhanced Light and FX\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043//?\r\n\r\nPure Waters\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1111//?\r\n\r\nEnhanced Night Skyrim\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/85//?\r\n\r\nReal Clouds:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/39450//?\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY:\r\nPretty much everything in the known universe. Actually probably not but there are no conflicts with any mods out there :)\r\n\r\nRECOMENDED:\r\n— Calibrate your screen contrast and brightness through your computer and calibrate colours and pretty much everything through the Nvidia panel (I can upload my calibration on demand)\r\n\r\n— Look through all my pictures, took me quite some time to collect them from\r\nmy travels.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/TjKcsSH.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nFAQ\\'s:\r\nQ: Why doesn\\'t my game look like yours?\r\nA: This could be the cause of a few things -\r\n     1) You are not using all of the recommended mods I mentioned, they are all mods that I have \r\n         mentioned so that your game will look exactly like mine. \r\n     2) You haven\\'t calibrated your screen either from your GPU interface or from the screen buttons   \r\n          correctly and so it won\\'t look exactly right.\r\n     3)  A certain lighting or graphics mod that you have installed that is not specified with this page is     \r\n          either conflicting or taking over, try using my recommendations.  \r\n\r\nQ: Sun shines through anything? (/ No god rays? / Sun is always visible?)\r\nA: There are 2 solutions available:\r\n    1) That is the result of some bad coding done by the guys at Nvidia with the nvidia 320.xx drivers, try\r\n        either updating to 326.xx or downgrading to 314.xx.    \r\n    2) Replace your sun texture or use the one that comes with the ENB.    \r\n     \r\nEnjoy your NextGen Skyrim graphics! If you like this mod, endorse it! Also, leave a comment if you have problems and please, read the important section above before asking questions mkay?",
