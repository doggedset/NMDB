  "descriptionHtml": "[i]\\\"Some of us refused to bow. We knew the old ways would lead us back to having a kingdom of our own.\\\"[/i]\r\n\r\nTwo decades have passed since the attempt by the Reachmen to take back their lands and establish a sovereign nation was crushed in Markarth by Ulfric Stormcloak, Jarl of Eastmarch, and the occupying Nords. Years later the struggle to take back The Reach carries on and the survivors of the Markarth Incident, now referring to themselves as the Forsworn, have sacrificed much to gain a foothold in the kingdom that is rightfully theirs. Some have even given up their mortal lives to be granted unnatural power in undeath.",
