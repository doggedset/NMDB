  "descriptionHtml": "At long last, my popular Odavira Dragoness Follower mod makes its debut on the Nexus&#33;\r<br />\r<br />A mod which adds a female (&#33;) dragon named Odavira as a follower. Gibby&#39;s Rex and Rhoana the Pet Dragons mod was used as a reference.Â \r<br />\r<br />Major thanks to Gibby for creating the Rex and Rhoana mod (the other dragon in the image is one of those two), and to HEXOS for inspiring me with the idea for a female dragon follower.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q: What is this mod?\r<br />[/b]Uhh... a mod that adds a big-ass female dragon as a follower.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q: Awesome&#33; what do I have to do to get her to follow me?\r<br />[/b]Nothing - she should spawn in Whiterun and head straight for you.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q: Can I marry her?\r<br />[/b]No, at the moment, you can&#39;t. She&#39;s too big to land most places, and right now she doesn&#39;t have any dialogue options implemented. Though I&#39;m sure you can find a way to do it if you&#39;re devious enough. ;)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q: Can she follow me into interiors?\r<br />[/b]No, unfortunately, she can&#39;t, because she&#39;s too big. However you have to admit that she sort of makes up for it with her sheer size. :P\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q: How effective is she in combat?\r<br />[/b]Get your enemies into any open area and watch the wreckage ensue. Yeah.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q: Can I ride her (pause)?\r<br />[/b]The Bend Will shout from Dragonborn should work on her, but she&#39;s double the size of a normal dragon, so there might be some glitchiness.\r<br />\r<br />[i][b]Future plans:\r<br />[/b][/i][list]\r<br />[*]Add a humanoid aspect to allow her to transform and follow you into interiors\r<br />[*]Marriage\r<br />[*]A quest line to acquire her as a follower\r<br />\r<br />[/list]",
