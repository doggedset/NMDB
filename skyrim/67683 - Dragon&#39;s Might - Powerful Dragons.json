They tried once to erase mankind from the face of Tamriel...[/b]\r<br />[b]I guess mankind had no mammoths back then&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/b][img]http://i.imgur.com/lqFbEX3.png[/img][/center][/size]\r<br />[size=2] [/size]\r<br />[b][size=3]Description[/size]\r<br />[/b]\r<br />[size=2]I was about to begin fresh game, then I thought about dragons... For me, they were only a challenge at the beginning of the [/size][size=2]game. After that, three or four swings of my weapon is all that took to take [/size][size=2]them down, or just stagger them to death with spells, not to mention the times [/size][size=2]the fierce dragons were stomped like mudcrabs by mammoths or giants.[/size]\r<br />[size=2]\r<br />Really? The once feared rulers of the world?\r<br />\r<br />[center]\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/yzLfp2i.png[/img][/center][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]What does this mod do?[/size]\r<br />[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I started searching for mods that address this by adding more types of dragons, more shouts or that increase the number of dragons you fight at the same time, etc. But I wanted a more simple approach. One day I found something really interesting in the Creation Kit, Bethesda gave the dragons an ability (a perk actually) named Dragon Skin, it reduces physical damage taken from all sources except the Dragonborn. I think this is a nice buff, but due dragons having no armor, weak shouts, a very slow melee attack and long delays between actions, the buff didn&#39;t really helped that much.\r<br />This mod just changes the Dragon Skin to:\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Dragon Might[/size]\r<br />[size=2] [/size][size=3]\r<br />[/size][list]\r<br /> [*][size=2]The dragon impenetrable skin reduces all damage taken by 70%, increases its armor rating by 450 and its stagger resistance by 100%.[/size]\r<br /> [*][size=2]Dragon gains 220% increased melee damage and 50% armor penetration to its attacks.[/size]\r<br /> [*][size=2]Finally it negates 96% of all physical incoming damage, except from the Dragonborn.[/size]\r<br />[/list][size=2]\r<br />[center]\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/wWz4LmJ.png[/img][/center]\r<br />[/size][b][size=3]Installation\r<br />[/size][/b]\r<br />[size=2]Just extract to your data folder and activate in your favorite mod manager.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]It should be compatible with every other mod, unless it modifies crDragonResistNPCs.[/size]\r<br />[size=2] [/size]\r<br />[b][size=3]Notes[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]First dragons in the game will be hard, if your level is very low and you are alone against the dragon fleeing might be the only [/size][size=2]option, getting face to face its suicide unless you are very good at evading, [/size][size=2]the idea is that they offer an epic fight even on higher levels.[/size]\r<br />[size=2]\r<br />NPCs will do close to no damage and will be devoured easily so a mod like [/size][b]Run For Your Lives[/b][size=2] is recommended.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=2]Heh, I once saw once a dragon grabbing a mammoth like it was its plaything (never seen that before), or another time a dragon[/size]\r<br />[size=2]landed and killed a giant in less than five seconds, only to leave peacefully to [/size][size=2]fly over the horizon.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Blessings&#33;[/size]",
