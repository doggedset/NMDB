  "descriptionHtml": "An epic but short story written by Jered Gunn. which has also been made into a video by Vindsvept with narration by S. Scott O&#39;Neal you can find them both at: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfSUheoljDlGDjerRylO4Nw \r<br /> https://www.youtube.com/user/nookncrannygame \r<br />\r<br />I do not own the contents of the book nor do I pass it off as my own work I simply enjoyed the story enough to want to carry it around in my adventures in Skyrim. The book is located in Breezehome on the shelf on the first floor near the table \r<br />\r<br />small note: This does require the dawnguard DLC because I used the book model from Immortal Blood\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />All credit for this mod goes to Jered Gunn, Vindsvept, and S. Scott O&#39;Neal, I do not claim ownership, if any of these creators wish to have the file removed I will do so",
