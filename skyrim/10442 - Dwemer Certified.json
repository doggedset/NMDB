  "summary": "Don\\'t just let those broken Dwemer Constructs and spare Dwemer Ingots go to waste- use them to build an army of steam-powered robots, upgrade and enchant their equipment, then lead them into battle from the driver\\'s seat of a Dwemer Centurion.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Dwemer Certified lets you build from scratch and repair from broken all the existing Dwemer Constructs, and two new ones- the humanoid Dwemer Simulacra, and the Dwemer Legionary (a small Centurion). All you need is a few perks and enough materials to forge the parts.\r\n\r\nOnce you have your robot army, you can remove their weapons and armour to enchant or smith it just like you would your own, and there\\'s a range of special upgrade items you can build to further improve them- so you can fit them with Daedra Hearts for cores, or internal storage so they can carry your loot for example.\r\n\r\nThen there\\'s a selection of machine-healing-spells to help keep them in tip-top shape, and a power that lets you order all your Constructs at once- telling them to wait in place, go aggressive or what have you. There\\'s also a spell that lets you take direct control of a Dwemer Centurion and go barrelling through your foes, knocking them aside with your bulk and spewing steam breath on them.\r\n\r\nWith all this, the only limit in the number of Constructs you can have following you is your Magicka- each one drains a small amount (for Spiders) or quite a lot (for Centurions).\r\n\r\nIf you like having an easy to control, highly upgradable and varied robot army following you then this is probably the mod for you. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n[youtube]zot8DUNvfFU[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[b]FAQ[/b]\r\n[i]-When I craft a bot I get a misc item rather than a companion![/i]\r\nMake sure you\\'re using the latest, Steam version of the game. That\\'s the only supported version, and the only one that will ever be supported.\r\n\r\n[i]-Is this mod compatible with other mods that add perks to the Smithing tree?[/i]\r\nYes, but only the mod that loads last will show their perks on the tree. You may need to shuffle load order occasionally.\r\n\r\n[i]-Will this work with an older version of Skyrim?[/i]\r\nI don\\'t know and I don\\'t care. It works with the newest version.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nFull contents list:\r\n[b]Perks[/b]\r\n[list][*][b]Dwemer Enchanting[/b]            [i]Requires Enchanter[/i]\r\nAllows you to scavenge Dynamo Cores from destroyed Constructs, or forge your own Spider Dynamo Cores and Dwemer Spell Tomes.\r\n[*][b]Advanced Dwemer Enchanting[/b]    [i]Requires Dwemer Enchanting[/i]\r\nAllows you to forge your own Sphere and Legionary Dynamo Cores, and more powerful Spell Tomes.\r\n[*][b]Tonal Architect[/b]            [i]Requires Advanced Dwemer Enchanting[/i]\r\nAllows you to forge your own Simulacra and Centurion Dynamo Cores, as well as forging special upgrade cores for all Constructs and yet more powerful Spell Tomes.\r\n\r\n[*][b]Construct Smithing[/b]             [i]Requires Dwemer Smithing[/i]\r\nAllows you to scavenge parts from destroyed Constructs, or forge your own Spider and Sphere parts and Constructs, as well as repairing destroyed Constructs.\r\n[*][b]Advanced Construct Smithing[/b]     [i]Requires Construct Smithing[/i]\r\nAllows you to forge your own Legionary and Simulacra parts, as well as forging special upgrade parts for all Constructs.\r\n[*][b]Numidium Scholar[/b]            [i]Requires Advanced Construct Smithing[/i]\r\nAllows you to forge your own Centurion parts.[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Bots and Specific Upgrades[/b]\r\n[list][*]Tier 1 - [b]Dwemer Spider[/b]            [i]Reduces maximum magicka by 30[/i]\r\nHas a weak shock spell and melee attack.
