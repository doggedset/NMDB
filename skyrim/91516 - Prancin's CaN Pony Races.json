[size=1]Or the vanilla ones if that's what \n<br />you have.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]And that would be it but I had an idea of adding a few racial abilities to this race too [/size][size=1]it kind of became the main thing about the mod now[/size][size=3], inspired by the Imperious mod by Enai Siaion:\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#b6b6b6]   ﻿   ﻿[size=6][b]All three races:[/b][/size]\n<br />[/color][color=#b6b6b6]\n<br />[/color][list]\n<br />[*][color=#b6b6b6][b][size=3]Horse Steppin':[/size][/b] You've got places to go and unlike those Men and Mer, you can recover much faster thanks to your equine lungs. Stamina Regen is 200% faster when not in combat and 30% faster when in combat (50% faster for Pegasis).[/color]\n<br />[/list][color=#b6b6b6]\n<br />[/color][list]\n<br />[*][color=#b6b6b6][b][size=3]Celestia's Blessing:[/size][/b] A divine from a far, far away land no one in Tamriel and perhaps not even you know exists. The blood in your veins links you to that place even if you don't know it anyway. Gives you a 30% Fire Resist during daytime only and not during Sundas, that's her day out.[/color]\n<br />[/list][color=#b6b6b6]\n<br />[/color][list]\n<br />[*][color=#b6b6b6][b][size=3]Luna's Blessing:[/size][/b] Ditto, except she basically never rests. Gives you a 30% Frost Resist during nighttime only.[/color]\n<br />[/list][color=#b6b6b6][i][u]\n<br />[/u][/i][i][u]^These two don't like Vamponies and will not give their blessings to them.\n<br />[/u][/i][i][u]\n<br />[/u][/i][/color][list]\n<br />[*][color=#b6b6b6][b][size=3]Art of The Dress:[/size][/b] Your friend made you some fine clothing for free.

Well, it works just the same I guess. +30 Speech when wearing clothes with the ClothingRich keyword, which are: [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Fine_Clothes]Fine Clothes[/url], [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Hammerfell_Garb]Hammerfell Garb[/url], [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Radiant_Raiment_Fine_Clothes]Radiant Raiment Fine Clothes[/url], among others and as well as ones added by mods if they have this keyword.[/color]\n<br />[/list][color=#b6b6b6]\n<br />[/color][list]\n<br />[*][color=#b6b6b6][b][size=3]Hush Now, Quiet Now (perk):[/size][/b] It's time for them to lay their sleepy heads, for good. 5x Damage on [u]sleeping targets[/u] with two-handed weapons and bows, and 30x with one-handed weapons. When combined with Deadly Aim and Assassin's Blade, bows deal 15x and daggers 150x. The Shrouded Gloves doubles all of those values.[/color]\n<br />[/list][color=#b6b6b6]   ﻿This one was inspired by the \"Mister Sandman\" perk from the Fallout series.\n<br />\n<br />[/color][list]\n<br />[*][color=#b6b6b6][b][size=3]Hooves for Hands:[/size][/b] Removed, as you no longer have hooves for hands and because I've always found it a tad too OP.[/color]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿[color=#dbb0a7][size=6][b]Earth:[/b][/size][/color][color=#dbb0a7]\n<br />[b]Base Health: [/b][size=3]130[/size]\n<br />[size=3][b]Base Magicka: [/b]70\n<br />[/size][size=3][b]Base Stamina: [/b]100\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3][b]Happy Trails Caravan:[/b][/size] Your honest heart's strong as horses, and given time, so is your back. Raises your Carry Weight by 10 every 5 levels (2 for every level) up to +150.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3][b]Let Arkay Sort Them Out (Lesser Power):[/b][/size] Make each hit count. Melee damage is 30% higher but Attack speed is 20% slower for 10 seconds. Lesser Power means you can use it as many times as you want.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#dbb0a7][size=3][b]Bro, Do You Even Draw?:[/b][/size] \"[/color][color=#dbb0a7]Bow and arrow, distance and string - these are my arts.\" 20% more damage with bows when Stamina is higher than 50%.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#dbb0a7][size=3][b]That's All You've Got?!:[/b][/size] [/color][color=#dbb0a7]\"No one bests an Earth equine!\" When your Health is lower than 25%, you get +150 Armor Rating.[/color]\n<br />[/list][/color][color=#cfe2f3]﻿   ﻿   ﻿[size=6][b]Pegasus:[/b][/size][size=3]\n<br />[b]\n<br />Base Health: [/b]100\n<br />[size=3][b]Base Magicka: [/b]70\n<br />[/size][size=3][b]Base Stamina: [/b]130\n<br />[/size][/size][/color][color=#cfe2f3]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3][b]Sweep, [b]Sweep, [/b][b]Sweep (Power)[/b]:[/b][/size] \"Only Twilight could make a fighting style about sweeping.\" Attack speed is 2x faster and bows do 2x damage for 15 seconds, but after the effect ends Melee damage and Stamina regen is 50% slower for 60 seconds. Power means you can only use this ability once a day.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3][b]Spirometry Dash:[/b][/size] You run like the wind, you just wish you could fly in it.

Fall damage is reduced by 90%.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3][b]I Believe I Can't Fly:[/b][/size] You sometimes wonder if flying would tire you. You do know however that when it comes to running, you recover basically instantly. That is, if you're not in a fight.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#cfe2f3][size=3][b]Gimme Fuel, Gimme Fire:[/b][/size] Stamina sustains you.

It doesn't raise any skills.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3][b]Unicorn Telekinesis:[/b][/size] The Telekinesis spell but at a very, very low Magicka cost per second. Throwing objects at others with this does 30 damage. The downside to this spell is that, unlike the regular Telekinesis spell (which has infinite range) the range of this one is very short.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3][b]Focus Pocus (Lesser Power):[/b][/size] If you're low on Magicka, activate this and either hide or use a weapon.

But be careful, because it won't regenerate for 2 minutes after that.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3][b]Healthy Magicka Equine:[/b][/size] If you have a lot of Health to spare... at 75% or higher Health, you have a 25% chance of absorbing enemy spells. That is, you still take damage, but you gain the cost of the spell in the form of Magicka.\n<br />\n<br />[/list][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e06666]﻿   ﻿   ﻿[size=6][b]Vamponies:[/b][/size][/color][size=3][color=#e06666]\n<br />\n<br />[/color][list]\n<br />[*][color=#e06666][size=3][b]Chrysalis' Blessing:[/b][/size][b] [/b]But somepony comes to save the Vampony's day, or in this case night. 30% faster Magicka, Health and Stamina regen when in light levels lower than 20 (think of dark corners and caves).[/color]\n<br />[/list][color=#e06666]\n<br />[/color][list]\n<br />[*][b]That's Apple's, Mate:[/b] \"Those vampire bats will give you a fright; Eating apples both day and night.\" Eating Red or Green Apples heals you 30 points of Health (as opposed to just 2), and grants you a roughly 2x faster sneaking movement speed for 20 seconds.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b]Note: The \"Happy Trails Caravan\" ability will only show up and start to take effect once you hit level 5.\n<br />[/b][b]Note[/b][size=1]2[/size][b]: If you created a pony before installing this, you will still have the \"Hooves for Hands\" ability. You can use the command [/b]\"player.removespell xx06fc38\" (where xx is the Mod Index of your load order where Crimes against Nature.esp is located)[b] to remove the ability.\n<br />[b][b]Note[/b][size=1]3[/size][b]: When loading a game where you're already a pony prior to installing this, there there's a chance that you won't get the abilities. Closing  and opening the game again should fix it. Or you can add the abilities via console commands.\n<br />[/b][/b][b][b][b]Note[/b][size=1]4[/size][b]: If you change your race to one of these three after you've already created your character, your Health, Stamina and Magicka will stay the same. This is an issue with the game and as far as I know, can't be fixed.[/b][/b][/b]\n<br />[b]Note[/b][size=1]5[/size][b]: A \"Vampony\" or \"Batpony\" as they are called in the show is just what you expect: A vampire pony.\n<br />[/b][/b]\n<br />In case you just want to use this for the abilities the mod adds, here's the IDs for each so you can add them to any race:\n<br />xx is the Mod Index of your load order where Prancin's CaN Pony Races.esp is located.\n<br />[size=2][b]Happy Trails Caravan       ﻿[/b]xx000d63\n<br />[b]Let Arkay Sort Them Out      [/b]xx012cb4\n<br />Bro, Do You Even Draw?        xx015279\n<br />That's All You've Got?     [b] [/b]xx01377c\n<br />Sweep, Sweep, Sweep     xx0106f2\n<br />Spirometry Dash   ﻿      xx010c5d\n<br />Leg Day   ﻿   ﻿    ﻿   xx010c5a\n<br />I Believe I Can't Fly          xx00dbce\n<br />Gimme Fuel, Gimme Fire      xx018867\n<br />Unicorn Candlelight         xx00dbd2\n<br />Unicorn Telekinesis         xx00d662\n<br />Focus Pocus   ﻿   ﻿    xx014245\n<br />I Put a Few Spells On You    xx00d65f\n<br />[b]Healthy Magicka Equine[/b]       xx014248\n<br />[b]Horse Steppin'   ﻿ ﻿     [/b]   ﻿xx001d8c\n<br />[b]Celestia's Blessing [/b]         ﻿xx003316\n<br />[/size][size=2][b]Luna's Blessing   ﻿  ﻿    ﻿ [/b]xx003319\n<br />[b]Art of The Dress     ﻿         [/b]xx0083de\n<br />[b]Chrysalis' Blessing    ﻿ ﻿     [/b]xx007918\n<br />[b]Hush Now, Quiet Now﻿    ﻿ [/b]xx008942   ﻿(Can be added to your character even if you use other mods that modify the Sneak tree)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]Compatibility:\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=4]I might be wrong but Celestia's and Luna's Blessings don't go well with Frostfall (technically they work fine together, but the Fire and Frost Resist might protect you more than you would like).[/size]\n<br />[*][size=4]Minor incompatibility with mods that edit the Red Apple (00064b2e) and Green Apple (00064b2f).
