  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]This is my first mod. All it does is tackle one of many tiny glitches that has bothered me every time that I&#39;ve played Skyrim, and something I haven&#39;t seen taken care of with any of the Unofficial Patches. Simply put, it makes Carlotta&#39;s Produce Stall in the Whiterun Market more aesthetically pleasing&#33; [/size]\r<br />[b]\r<br />[size=5][u]What it does:\r<br />[/u][/size][/b]\r<br />[size=3]1. Raises Carlotta&#39;s leeks and tomato display bins off of the ground to sit on top of a couple crates. [/size]\r<br />[size=3]2. Moves the NPC browsing marker back a little bit so that NPCs browse her vegetables without trying to climb into the bin.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]INSTALLATION[/size][/b][size=3] (If you didn&#39;t download with NMM)\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=3]1. Copy the file &#34;Carlotta_Stall_Fix.esp&#34; from the unzipped folder that you download from here.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]2. Paste it in your Data folder located under Skyrim/Data wherever you have Skyrim installed.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]3. If you have NMM but you downloaded and installed manually make sure you activate the check mark in NMM under the &#34;Plugins&#34; tab.[/size]\r<br />[size=3](This is the same process for many mods that only contain an .esp file)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]This little mod should work with any other Whiterun mods that don&#39;t change the area directly in front of Carlotta&#39;s Market Stall in Whiterun. [/size]",
