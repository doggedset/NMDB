  "summary": "Adds more locations to skyrim (36 so far), some only be reached via console at the moment, some are spread across Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "What it is: This mods adds more locations for your exploring pleasure to skyrim. Some are small farms, some are sprawling dungeons. Pretty much all of them are filled with stuff that wants to kill you. I&#39;ve tried to make them blend into the vanilla game as well as I can. Have fun, new enemies and supirises await&#33;\r<br />\r<br />And report any problems.\r<br />\r<br />Update .09\r<br />Only one new dungeon is ready, but its a pretty big one, fast travel to the abyss to find it. The boss here is very strong, so only go if your a high level.\r<br />All dungeons that will have markers have them. There are a number of places that I won&#39;t add markers for, and will only be happened upon while exploring.\r<br />For now the markers are fast travel enabled, will change in later updates.\r<br />\r<br />Update .08\r<br />All dungeons have been connected to with the exception of the ones that are still being worked on. Next update will have map markers on most, as well as another couple dungeons I have to finish up.\r<br />2 new locations:\r<br />patFolrelnaarPass\r<br />patSunkenGraveyard\r<br />(now up to 35 new cells, as well as a few points of interest.\r<br />Note: I&#39;d like to release my beta within the next couple of weeks, so any feedback would be appreciated.\r<br />\r<br />Update .07\r<br />4 new locations (up to 32 now..I think): \r<br />patHowlingCavern*\r<br />patMossDen*\r<br />patSnowpawCave*\r<br />patNcranzel\r<br />The majority or the available dungeons are now connected to skyrim.\r<br />Still no map markers, you&#39;ll have to find them by exploring :P.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Update .06\r<br />3 new dungeons:\r<br />patFrostbiteSewers*\r<br />patBtharenzel*\r<br />patConjurersDen*\r<br />patFolrelnaar has been changed to patFolrelnaarLabyrinth, patFolrelnaar is incomplete at the moment.\r<br />12 pieces of a powerful axe spread across tamriel. Can craft into the axe once all pieces are obtained. Look for a covered Talos shrine. (map will be made eventually if needed.)\r<br />Now have 3 outdoor cells, and 10 more are accessable from skyrim.\r<br />Lore added to some dungeons via notes.\r<br />A hint to Mercers hideaway location is on a desk in Mercers home.\r<br />Balance fixes.\r<br />Bug fixes.\r<br />No map markers yet. Will be added once all dungeons are connected.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m uploading this for back-up purposes, but would like for feedback on what I have completed. There are a number of dungeons(25 cells so far), reachable by console only for the most part. There&#39;s a few new artifacts with unique enchanments as well as a few spells. They have pretty much everything ready to go except for entrances from skyrim. However I&#39;m still creating more dungeons and won&#39;t be getting around to anything else for a couple of months now. So for now the console codes are:\r<br />\r<br />COC *****\r<br />\r<br />patAbandonedMine*\r<br />patAggevar*\r<br />patBarrelShack*\r<br />patBeeFarmCave*\r<br />patBernuldandSonApothecary*\r<br />patBlackMine*\r<br />patBloodrockMine*\r<br />patClearwaterMine*\r<br />patDushgarMor*\r<br />patDushgarMorMine*\r<br />patFolrelnaar\r<br />patFolrelnaarCrypt\r<br />patForgottenPrison*\r<br />patForgottenSewer*\r<br />patGlacierMoorCave*\r<br />patGlacierMoorShip*\r<br />patHiddenDen*\r<br />patHiddenTunnel*\r<br />patMercersHideaway*\r<br />patMystwindRuin\r<br />patPoachersCave\r<br />patRockbedFarmBasement\r<br />patSoulpineManor*\r<br />patSoulpineManorBasement\r<br />patWellspringFarm\r<br />patFishermanCabin*\r<br />patShipwreckCove*\r<br />\r<br />* = connected to skyrim\r<br />\r<br />Theres also a house I&#39;m working on, its fully functional, with teleportings to cities available.,several merhant trainers, and there&#39;s also several new crafting stations I made to prevent menu clutter, with over 100 new recipes spread among them(Soul gem upgrading, potion combining, others are a suprise). \r<br />The house is reachable by finding a teleport marker in a city. (look under whiteruns bridge) Once you find the teleport room in the house, you&#39;ll find a spell that will teleport you home.\r<br />\r<br />I have to be honest, I haven&#39;t playtested most of these very thouroughly, so I&#39;d love help with testing these so I can continue with bug fixes and new dungeons.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />To do list: \r<br />add in the lore I&#39;ve written for the dungeons\r<br />sound effects\r<br />special effects\r<br />\r<br />Things I need: \r<br />I need someone who can hook up a quest for me.\r<br />My computers graphics suck, so if anyone wants to upload pictures that&#39;d be appreciated.\r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods: \r<br />Unique Places: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15310\r<br />\r<br />Credits: \r<br />grobbendonk for alpha testing.\r<br />Oaristys for this resource: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16525\r<br />Gizmodian for his vicious Heart: http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/28881 \r<br />Snezko for porting the Vicious Heart: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6148\r<br />Bethesda for a great game and the CK.\r<br />Nexus for the awesome community.\r<br />Everything else is me :P",
