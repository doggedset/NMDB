  "summary": "This Mod Replaces ALL of the Children in the Game with Talking Dogs.  Essentially removing children from Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is a work around for people who are either annoyed by human children existing in the game, think there should be more dogs in the game, are curious about what dogs would say if they could talk, or want to use Adult mods freely without risking some stupid NPC underage voyeur walking in on something that would make them need therapy.  Haha!  That was a joke, but no really, its obvious Bethesda put story essential kids in the game to prevent anyone from ever having legal Adult mods in Skyrim, seeing as Oblivion had such a huge Adult modding community.  This mod should add a solution to all of the kid related issues by effectively removing kids from the game and replacing them with a mystical creature.  Like a bad Disney movie...  Anyway there are three esp files you can download separately.  One for Skyrim\\'s update, one for Dawnguard, and one for Hearthfire.  You know the drill.  Have fun!",
