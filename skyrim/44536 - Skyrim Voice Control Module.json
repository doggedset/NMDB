  "descriptionHtml": "Skyrim Voice Control Module (SVCM)\r<br />\r<br />Description\r<br />=========================================================\r<br />SVCM is a voice control module that allows users to map ALL their spells, shouts and powers to a voice control file (Windows Speech Recognition**). It also has the ability to save and equip gear combos and manage a single follower. The process is as automated as possible with Skyrim&#39;s scripting language &#34;Papyrus&#34; and the SKSE add-on. This module will handle the loading portion, but does not fire the loaded ability so the user retains finer control over the abilities use.\r<br />\r<br />A follower can also be mapped and issued voice commands, see below.\r<br />\r<br />Primary Features:\r<br />    Can easily map up to 800 spells/Powers\r<br />    Can easily map up to 100 Shouts\r<br />    Efficient response times\r<br />    Ability to toggle equip state (right/left/dual/cycle)\r<br />    Can issue commands to upto 5 followers\r<br />    5 right and left hand combo slots for weapons/spells/shield\r<br />    Rapid shout toggle\r<br />    Auto shout toggle\r<br />\r<br />Misc. Features:\r<br />    Ability to toggle debug logging as needed\r<br />    Command to toggle Exp gains for levelling (persistent after game save)\r<br />\r<br />**Other voice control programs are possible if there is enough community interest.\r<br />\r<br />How It Works\r<br />==========================\r<br />SVCM will cycle through all your spells and powers to build its required lists. Shouts can be recorded by equipping them and activating a hotkey that tells SVCM to record your current shout. This allows SVCM to create complete lists of spells, powers and shouts no matter what mods you have installed.\r<br />\r<br />In order to map so many potential abilities a multiple sequential keystroke input was implemented, so instead of being limited to a smaller number of possible combinations (cntl+1,alt+1,Shift+1,1) the possibilities are now unlimited (within reason).\r<br />\r<br />To ease the mapping process I have implemented key commands to build the lists then print a complete WSR macro file to the debug log for a simple cut & paste.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements\r<br />==========================\r<br />SKSE: http://skse.silverlock.org/download/\r<br />Windows Speech Recognition Macros (win7/8):  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13045 IMPORTANT - Microsoft requires you to use Internet Explorer to authenticate the download.\r<br />Microphone\r<br />\r<br />The control map is required to clear all bindings to the numpad keys. (one is linked on nexus page as Optional. MHP uses similar so you may not need a new one)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility\r<br />==========================\r<br />SVCM will conflict with any mod that remaps keys on the numpad or requires the use of a control map that doesn&#39;t clear the numpad bindings. MHP should not conflict by default, but you may have already mapped some numpad keys so they would need to be unmapped. MHP also uses custom control maps, many of which already unbind the numpad keys and handle the requirement.\r<br />\r<br />Problems initializing have been seen when an excess of 110 modules are loaded.\r<br />\r<br />Installation\r<br />==========================\r<br />First install Microsoft Speech Recognition Macros and confirm it is working.\r<br />\r<br />Second install the control map to disable skyrim&#39;s default mappings for the numpad keys.\r<br />Download the control map listed in requirements and copy to &#34;.&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Interface&#92;Controls&#92;PC&#92;\r<br />Backup your previous control map first by simply renaming it. You can also choose to use the nexus mod manager to install, but it will not be able to backup the original control map.\r<br />\r<br />Third, Install SVCM using the Nexus Mod Manager preferably.\r<br />\r<br />Fourth, start skyrim and start using it =)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Using SVCM\r<br />==========================\r<br />Once in game, the first thing to do is build the spell/power lists. This is done by simply tapping the &#34;9&#34; key on the numpad 3 times rapidly. This will cause a notification in the left top corner letting you know its working. Don&#39;t do anything until you get another notification saying it is done.\r<br />\r<br />Next, open your magic window and go to your shouts section. Equip your first shout then hit 9 9 2 rapidly on the numpad. If you haven&#39;t previously stored this shout you will get another notification letting you know it was added. Equip the next shout and hit 9 9 2 again to add the newly selected shout. Rinse and repeat until all your shouts are entered.\r<br />\r<br />Now all your shout, powers and spells are saved to the modules internal lists. Do a quick save to make sure the data stays persistent.\r<br />\r<br />Now we need to enable debug logging so we have a place to write the xml data for the WSR macro file. Tap 9 9 1 on the numpad and you should get a notification that logging is enabled.\r<br />\r<br />Then tap 9 9 8 to begin the data dump to the log file. A notification will appear when it starts and another when it stops.\r<br />\r<br />After it stops, hit 9 9 0 to close the debug file\r<br />\r<br />Now we need to open the debug file, open start menu and click Documents. Go to &#34;my games&#92;Skyrim&#92;Logs&#92;Script&#34; and open the file Papyrus0.log\r<br />\r<br />The data you need will look like this:\r<br />\r<br />    &lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;UTF-16&#34;?&gt;\r<br />    &lt;speechMacros&gt;\r<br />    &lt;command priority=&#34;127&#34;&gt;\r<br />            .....\r<br />            .....\r<br />            .....\r<br />            .....\r<br />    &lt;/list&gt;\r<br />    &lt;/rule&gt;\r<br />\r<br />    &lt;/speechMacros&gt;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Simply select and copy all of it then create a new text file and paste it inside and save as &#34;SVCM.wsr&#34;  (you can play with pronunciations and/or remove spells you wont use if you want, some wsr knowledge is wise)\r<br />\r<br />After the file is saved then move it to &#34;Documents&#92;Speech Macros&#92;&#34;. Now right click the file and select &#34;Sign Speech Macros...&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Start up Skyrim and start playing.....\r<br />\r<br />When you learn new spells and shout, this process will need to be repeated. I typically use a normal hotkey for a new spell/shout until I get enough to remake a new wsr file.\r<br />\r<br />Commands and Usage\r<br />===============================\r<br />There are a few built in commands you can use, just speak the phrase as written (not usable until first wsr has been completed and signed).*\r<br />\r<br />    build spell lists\r<br />    add shout to list\r<br />    dump lists\r<br />    enable logging\r<br />    disable logging\r<br />    stop levelling\r<br />    resume levelling\r<br />    \r<br />    equip left\r<br />    equip right\r<br />    dual wield\r<br />    equip cycle\r<br />    unequip spells\r<br />    save weapon set &lt;1/2/3/4/5&gt;\r<br />    equip weapon set &lt;1/2/3/4/5&gt;\r<br />    \r<br />    open Magic\r<br />    open Inventory\r<br />    open Map\r<br />    open Skills\r<br />    \r<br />    follow me\r<br />    wait here\r<br />    trade with me\r<br />    do me a favor    \r<br />    stop combat   (will re-agro rapidly if opponent not pacified)\r<br />    stand your ground\r<br />    Register follower &lt;1/2/3/4/5&gt;\r<br />    Follower &lt;1/2/3/4/5&gt;\r<br />    &lt;followers name&gt;\r<br />    Everyone follow me\r<br />    Everyone wait here\r<br />    \r<br />    Enable rapid shout\r<br />    Disable rapid shout\r<br />    \r<br />    Enable auto shout\r<br />    Disable auto shout\r<br />    \r<br />To use shouts, spells, follower commands, equip sets and powers you simply say them by name. If recognition doesn&#39;t work well for some spells then you can edit the wsr file, train windows speech recognition or try saying it differently.\r<br />\r<br />*More commands are possible if community interest justifies it.\r<br />\r<br />Follower commands\r<br />==============================\r<br />To use a follower you must first do the build process so your wsr file is complete and working. Then after registering your followers you need to remake the wsr file so it contains the updated names. Remaking the wsr file is only needed to use the actual followers names, the generic command of &#34;follower &lt;1/2/3/4/5&gt;&#34; will work without the remake if you want to delay a bit.\r<br />\r<br />When in game and next to your follow you wish to use voice commands with, simply say &#34;register follower &lt;1/2/3/4/5&gt;&#34; and wait for the notification in the top left. Then move your cursor over your follower so the cursor changes to show the name of the follower. When done properly there will be a notification in the top left with the followers name. Once this is done, your follower is registered and you should do a game save to make it persistent.\r<br />\r<br />From now on, you can simply use voice commands to direct your follower. To control which follower is accepting commands, simply say the followers name and wait for the notification in the top left showing the command was successful. Once control is initiated any successive commands will go to that follower. Instead of using the followers name you can also use &#34;follower &lt;1/2/3/4/5&gt;&#34;. There are 5 commands that can be used &#34;do me a favor&#34;, &#34;wait here&#34;, &#34;Stop Combat&#34;, &#34;follow me&#34; and &#34;trade with me&#34;. &#34;Stand your ground&#34; has been added but is not very pretty and is turned off by using &#34;follow me&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />There are two commands that affect all followers at once, &#34;Everyone follow me&#34; and &#34;Everyone wait here&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Rapid shout functionality\r<br />===============================\r<br />This allows the player to automatically use the highest powered version of the word with a single key tap instead of holding the key down to ramp up the number of words used. You can toggle the ability on and off so you can still access the first and second word versions if needed.\r<br />\r<br />Auto shout functionality\r<br />===============================\r<br />This allows the player the ability to toggle whether a shout will be automatically fired when it is loaded by voice commands. The effective key tap will only be long enough to fire the first word of the shout, unless rapid shout is enabled which will result in the strongest version the player has available.\r<br />\r<br />Custom WSR modifications\r<br />===============================\r<br />Users can get some very nice functionality by modifying the wsr file manually. A good example is a post in the &#34;posts&#34; section of the SVCM page on Nexus Mods by &#34; luister777&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />===============================\r<br />Thanks to SKSE for many useful papyrus functions.\r<br />\r<br />Change Log\r<br />===============================\r<br />v1.0.7 Nov-30-2014:\r<br />    - Changed follower support to handle up to 5 followers\r<br />\r<br />v1.0.6 Nov-13-2014:\r<br />    - Added &#34;Rapid Shout&#34; capability, toggleable.\r<br />    - Added &#34;Auto Shout&#34; capability, toggleable.\r<br />\r<br />v1.0.5 Nov-02-2013:\r<br />    - Bug fix to correct left hand spells not equipping with weapon set combos.\r<br />    \r<br />v1.0.4 Nov-01-2013:\r<br />    - Added functionality to handle saving and equipping weapon sets. Saving a set will store both right hand and left hand contents\r<br />      for easy re-equipping as a combo set. Can use weapons, spells and/or shield. There is 5 sets available.\r<br />    - Added a &#34;Stand your ground&#34; command for follower. The follower will stop moving, but it isn&#39;t pretty. The follower will keep animating\r<br />      animating as if it is moving but is locked in place until the &#34;Follow me&#34; command is issued. BETA feature until I can find\r<br />      a better implementation.\r<br />\r<br />v1.0.3 Oct-24-2013:\r<br />    - Added follower command &#34;stop combat&#34;\r<br />    - foxed an error that prevented hard coded commands from getting dumped to wsr file.\r<br />    \r<br />v1.0.2 Oct-23-2013:\r<br />    - Made the levelling setting persistent between game save so you don&#39;t have to remember to say command every game session.\r<br />    - Added a notification when a shout is equipped for consistency.\r<br />\r<br />v1.0.1 Oct-21-2013: \r<br />    -Added more voice commands: &#34;Open magic&#34;, &#34;open inventory&#34;, &#34;open skills&#34;, &#34;open map&#34;, &#34;Equip Cycle&#34;\r<br />    -The new Equip Cycle command will rotate between right and left hand every time a spell is loaded.\r<br />    -Added voice controls for one Follower. This allows commands to be issued to the registered follower (favor, wait, follow, trade)\r<br />\r<br />    \r<br />    \r<br />    \r<br />    ",
