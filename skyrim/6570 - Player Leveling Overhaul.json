  "descriptionHtml": "[color=Crimson][b]WARNING[/b]: this is alpha, Rested bonus from sleeping and Standing stones that affect skill gain rate are not modified and have no effect.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=Greenyellow][u]Description[/u][/color]\r\nSkills increase only by trainers\r\n\r\n[color=Greenyellow][u]Details[/u][/color]\r\nThis mod completely changes the leveling system - now you skills do not increase when you apply them. NO, this mod does NOT introduce \\'experience points\\'. So how do you advance your skills, and, therefore, levels? Simple - use trainers. The cost for training is reduced by ~35%, so that now you need only ~560k of Gold to reach level 50 if you train some skills to the maximum.\r\n[b]Now all that vast amount of Gold you accumulate playing Skyrim is really useful!![/b]\r\n\r\n[color=Crimson]As this mod renders the Rested bonus useless, I\\'d recommend to use the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9624]Better food and sleep[/url] with this mod.[/color]\r\n\r\nTraining times per level increased to 99.\r\n\r\nLike in vanilla, heavy crafting would net you a pack of levels really fast, because crafting is profitable. Unlike the vanilla, you would not automatically become a Super Mega Craftsman that can create artifacts of Godlike power (although you are still able to if you wish). As a result, you can fully enjoy in-game crafting activities without over-powering your character (yes, I think that crafting is unbalanced).\r\nAnd you still can dump that boring crafting and go hunt the wilderness for treasuries, thanks to well-balanced leveling system of Skyrim.\r\n\r\nWhen you feel that your skills are inadequate to the challenge you oppose - go find a trainer and spend some gold. Yes, [b]exploring the world is not just for fun[/b] now!\r\nBut if for some reason you do not want to, here is a [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Trainers]List of Trainers[/url]\r\n\r\n[color=Greenyellow]\r\nTesting and bugreports are quite welcome - this mod still needs testing regarding fine-tuning training costs and number of training times allowed per level.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=Greenyellow][u]Installation[/u][/color]\r\nCurrently there are two versions of this mod:\r\n[b]0.2[/b] is tested and clean, but Master Trainers train only up to 90\r\n[b]0.3[/b] is not tested and contains some leftover garbage made by Creation Kit, but Master Trainers are fixed and train up to 100 (I\\'ve used the code from dagincourt88\\'s mod http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8866 with some bugfixes of mine)\r\n\r\nUse the Nexus mod manager\r\nor\r\nDownload, extract and copy ESP file into the \\'Data\\' directory of Skyrim:  \\'<Steam folder>\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\' by default. \r\nActivate the esp you want in Skyrim Launcher.\r\n\r\n[color=crimson]Be aware - any savegames created while this mod is enabled become almost unplayable if you disable it. Backup your saves before you install this mod!![/color]\r\n",
