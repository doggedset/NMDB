  "descriptionHtml": "I tend to make new characters often and almost always cheat with them all (a lot).  So I made some text files that contain lists of common cheats I use which can then be run from the console using the \\\"bat\\\" command.\r\n\r\nI don\\'t like to cheat TOO much so most of these cheats leave some room for growth.\r\n\r\nThe RAR contains 5 text files:\r\nav.txt -- some basic ActorValue cheats to make a character more powerful (doesn\\'t add any skills)\r\nspells.txt -- adds all spells in the game that can be learned from spell tomes. (no shouts, etc)\r\ningr.txt -- adds one of every ingredient in the game (including Crimson Nirnroot 000b701a which will start a quest).\r\nperks.txt -- adds most of the perks in the game except for a few I don\\'t like or want.\r\nench.txt -- adds a couple of enchanted items to your inventory which augment different skills.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nJust copy and paste (or extract) to your Skyrim root folder.  When in the game hit the tilde ~ key to open the console and type \\\"bat perks\\\" to run all the commands in the perks.txt file.  It\\'s the same with all the others.\r\nbat perks\r\nbat av\r\nbat ench\r\nbat spells\r\nbat ingr\r\n\r\nYou can add or remove lines from the files as you like.  No skin off my nose.\r\nHave fun.",
