  "descriptionHtml": "[b][center]Your Thu\\'um is pure force, and shall eliminate your foes at once. Behold the Dragonborn\\'s power! This was the second mod I ever made, but it was forgotten on the Steam Workshop. I downloaded it and upgraded it. Now it is better![/b][/center]\r\n\r\n[b][i]Features[/i][/b]\r\n[list][*]Four new shouts added\r\n[*]Vanilla shouts upgraded[/list]\r\n\r\n[b][i]Upcoming[/b][/i]\r\n[list][*]More shouts\r\n[*]More upgrade to the vanilla shouts\r\n[*]Quests for the new shouts (they will not be as easy as these ones to be unlocked)[/list]\r\n\r\n[b][i]FAQ[/b][/i]\r\n[list][*]How do I upgrade my vanilla shouts?\r\nA: You don\\'t. Once you install this mod, your shouts will be upgraded. \r\n[*]How do I unlock the new shouts?\r\nA: There is a book written in the Dragonic language. Once you read it, the new shouts will be added to yout shouts list. You need dragon souls to unlock the words of power.\r\n[*]Ok, but where is this book?\r\nA: High Hrothgar. In the Greybeards\\' bedroom.\r\n[*]What are the new shouts and what do they do?\r\nA: Read the notes section.[/list]\r\n\r\n[b][i]Notes[/b][/i]\r\nThis mod adds 4 new shouts. Thunder, Meteor Rain, Fireball and Frostball. Fireball and Frostball are not the same as Fire and Frost Breath, respectively. Fireball and Frostball do more damage. Plus, Fireball has an effect that is close to the effect of Incinerate spell. Frostball is the same shout as the dragons have, but stronger. As the name says, it spits a frostball. Meteor rain is similar to Alduin\\'s Storm Call, but Meteor Rain does not hurt the player. Instead, it hurts only his foes. Using this shout in cities will cause everyone to hate you, haha. Finally, Thunder. This shout is similar to the thunderbolt spell, but stronger and focused. The shouts that were upgraded are: Fire Breath, Frost Breath and Unrelenting Force. Fire and Frost Breath, when shouting the first word, you will get the same effect as the three together. It means your shout recovery time will be reduced. Unrelenting force does more damage. Instead of 2, 5 and 10 (respectively, from the first to the third word), it does 100, 150 and 200 points of damage.\r\n\r\n[center][b][i]Other mods of mine[/i]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/40849]Domus Imperatoris[/url] | [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41535]Mining Guild[/url] | [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41567]Zumul Thu\\'um[/url][/b][/center]",
