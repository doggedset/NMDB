  "summary": "Removes the need to have your quest markers turned on. Updates the quest log\\'s with very detailed instructions to aid you in finding your destination. And the feature that sets this one apart... Prevents map markers from being added to your map during quests. You will have no indication of where you\\'re supposed to go except from the directions in",

For now, the best solution is to make a quest active that you have no intention of doing for a while. That will prevent the game from auto activating any new quests you pick up.[/color]\r\n\r\nSo my ISP has screwed my Internet for the past few days with no explanation so I can\\'t work on the mod :( ill be getting back to it ASAP \r\n\r\nIf you find a description that is too easy/hard to follow, bugs, grammar mistakes or spelling errors just let me know :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://oi39.tinypic.com/dn1ppt.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThis mod removes dungeon map markers and adds very detailed directions to your quest log and often, to your objectives. And is designed so you can play and turn off those annoying magical location arrows! \r\n\r\nSo you may ask yourself, \\\"Why should I use this mod instead of Even Better Quest Objectives\\\". Well that mod is awesome... if your still using quest markers, it\\'s great to have a little more description other than \\\"go here\\\". My mod is completely different. I\\'m designing this mod so you can play Skyrim without the use of quest markers or without having map markers added by quest scripts so you can get that feel of immersion you got back in the Morrowind days. It will encourage you to explore a little more as you don\\'t have an arrow to follow or a location plopped on your map. \r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://oi42.tinypic.com/5b1q3t.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Manually download the files.
