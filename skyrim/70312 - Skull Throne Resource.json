It [i]should [/i]be ready to be used in the Creation Kit (fully prepared in NifSkope), but it&#39;s the first furniture object I&#39;ve done, so I&#39;m not entirely sure. If there&#39;s a problem with it, tell me and I&#39;ll do my best to fix it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />As long as you credit me, you&#39;re free to use this for whatever project you like.\r<br />Please do not upload this anywhere else.",
