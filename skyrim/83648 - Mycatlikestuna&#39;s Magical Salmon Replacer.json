My models display 2 distinct phases of the salmon&#39;s life cycle. The ocean phase is depicted by the silver fish and the fresh water phase is shown by the red fish. The salt water fish should only appear in the Sea of Ghosts and around the rivers mouth&#39;s. Diddo for the fresh water fish. \r<br />\r<br />Why is this mod referred to as magical you may ask? Well, currently I am in the process of creating many new, lore friendly, and rare types of fish to be added to Tamriel&#39;s waterways along with the current base models. So don&#39;t forget about this mod, as it will be updated several more times as more fish are completed.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod, but hopefully it will be the first of many. I have spent months teaching myself how to implement my models \r<br />successfully, so please be patient if something isn&#39;t working for you.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/110/36468495-1493891270.png[/img][/center][center]\r<br />Official Skyrim Update\r<br />Dawnguard DLC\r<br />Dragonborn DLC\r<br />[/center]",
