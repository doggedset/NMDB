  "descriptionHtml": "Why did this get removed the first time I uploaded?\r\nQuote from Jaysus Swords page\r\n\\\"you may create plugins and mods based on this mod as long as your mod stays dependant on mine,\r\nyour mod may not contain any assets contained in my mod under any circumstances\\\"\r\nThat is what this is. A dependent esp that contains no assets of his mod.\r\nPlease don\\'t remove this again.\r\n\r\nAnyways on to the description.\r\nThis makes the vanilla iron sword look like the fine iron sword\r\nfrom Jaysus Swords. I was tired of how ugly and stupid the original iron sword\r\nlooked so I did this in like 2 minutes.\r\nRequires Jaysus Swords mod.\r\nAll credit goes to Jaysus for making the mesh and texture. (which is not included!)\r\n",
