  "descriptionHtml": "Karena Imperial Destruction Mage UNP\r\n\r\nAdds an Imperial Destruction Mage to Whiterun\r\n\r\nDue to a request I\\'ve uploaded a version with the hair included in the mod.  Apachii gave me permission to use the hairstyle, so please thanks goes to Apachii.  If you have Apachii installed already there isn\\'t any reason to install this one.\r\n\r\nTo look like she does in the pictures:\r\nDIMONIZED UNP female body UNP Base Main body V1dot2 by dimon99 here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709\r\nBetter Females version 3 Makeup Version 3 and No Shine by BellaGail here \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\nNatural Eyes by nevenbridge here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589\r\n\r\nRequired:\r\nRequires Apachii\\'s new hair, ApachiiSkyHairFemale, without it you\\'ll CTD, found here \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168, under Optional Files.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.7 is apparenlty required too since I built this mod after being updated.\r\n\r\nShe is set to\r\nLvl 1 auto lvl\r\nWeight 100\r\nEssential and Nonessential versions\r\nDestruction Mage:\r\n\tSpells:\r\n\t\tFirebolt\r\n\t\tLightning Bolt\r\n\t\tConjure Flame Atronach\r\n\t\tConjure Storm Atronach\r\n\t\tBound Sword, I\\'ve never seen her use this spell.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change her gear, stats, I suggest Extensible Follower Framework by Expired, found here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12933, don\\'t install with NMM though, download the NMM version, unzip it, and copy XFLMain.exm, XFLMain.bsa, XFLDialogue.esp, XFLPlugins.esp, and XFLTweaks.esp to your Skyrim/Data folder, or install the No BSA version with NMM.  UFO should work too, but I prefer EFF for the group commands. \r\n\r\nYou\\'ll find her in Whiterun, she patrols the city from 0800 to 1200, and again from 1300 to 1700\r\nFrom 1200 to 1300 and from 1700 to 1900 she\\'ll be in Dragonsreach eating\r\nFrom 1900 to 2100 she\\'ll be in the Drunken Huntsman and from 2100 to 2300 in the Bannered Mare partying (hopefully not too much)\r\n\r\nShe\\'ll be wearing the black version of Ashara Princess of the Woods, here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18008, and jewelry from Ashara Dimonized Dress and Dragon Jewelry here \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14146, both by SydneyB.\r\n\r\nSince SydneyB graciously allowed me to use parts of these two in this mod, you\\'re not required to install it, but I highly recommend both mods.\r\n\r\nInstallation is easiest with NMM\r\nOr if you want to install manually extract someplace, right click on CGKarena, copy the data folder, and paste it in your Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\nUninstall with NMM if you used NMM to install\r\nOr if installed manually:\r\nDelete:\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\CGKarena.esp\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Meshes\\\\Actor\\\\Character\\\\facegendata\\\\facegeom\\\\CGKarena.esp\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Meshes\\\\Karena\\\\\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Actor\\\\Character\\\\facegendata\\\\facetint\\\\CGKarena.esp\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Karena\\\\\r\n\r\nAny requests for changes I\\'ll try to accommodate, but changing faces\\\\editing followers in the CK is \r\ntricky, and can corrupt the file to point its unusable.\r\n\r\nCredits:  These modders did all the hard work, I just put stuff together, they\\'re the artists.\r\ndimon99 for the best body\r\nBellaGail for her face textures\r\nnevenbridge for the great eyes\r\nApachii for the awesome hairs, and for letting me upload a version that includes the hair.\r\neamico who I got the sandbox idea from\r\nSydneyB for the outfit, and allowing me to upload it as part of this mod\r\n\r\nOther Mods I use for lighting:\r\nULTRA REALISTIC WORLD LIGHTING: Normal Setting uploaded by MGE  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13531\r\nCLARALUX - More and Brighter Lights by MyGoodEye  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17605\r\nIMAGINATOR - Visual Control Device for Skyrim by MyGoodEye and Gopher  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13049",
