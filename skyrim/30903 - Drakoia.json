  "descriptionHtml": "This sword is currently a WIP. I am working on textures and fire effects right now. After getting it through, I will open this to the public.\r\n\r\nA legendary sword that is made from the teeth of a dragon. This sword will light your enemies ablaze with dragon fire.\r\n\r\nI hope to add a quest mod that you have to go along a journey to acquire the pieces to craft the sword, but I may have to wait on that as school has picked back up.\r\n\r\nDrakoia - dra-koy-ya\r\n\r\nNo, it isn\\'t part of the dragon language, but should be.\r\n\r\nThis sword won\\'t be overpowerful, but it will be strong as it will take a lot of time and energy to receive if I find out how I want to build the quest for it.\r\n\r\nCurrently no textures.",
