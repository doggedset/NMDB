  "modName": "Scientifically Accurate Unrelenting Force",
  "summary": "A small mod that changes the Unrelenting Force shout to be more physically accurate.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A while ago I noticed that the Unrelenting Force shout seemed a little under powered. Not in the sense of gameplay, but in the sense of physics. The size and speed of that shockwave is enormous.\r\nThis bugged me so much that I calculated the actual force of the shockwave. I know, it seems a little bit of a waste of time- but it eventually led to this mod. The current unrelenting force is about 200-300 kg of force (newtons), when in reality it should be about 19,784 newtons...... Wow. So this mod makes  it so that the unrelenting force (aside from the whole shouting dragon language that shoots stuff aspect) is more realistic. It kills low level things instantly, and sends most small animals and people flying. It crunches bones and destroys internal organs. This is a bit overpowered. So there is an optional version that exchanges that for an increased recharge time- about 2 minutes. Keep in mind this mod is supposed to be scientifically accurate as far as physics go- not exactly immersive.\r\n\r\nI am only in 10th grade level geometry, (I\\'m thirteen) so if you check my math and it\\'s wrong please tell me. I would very much appreciate it. I replied to one of the first comments with the math and I will put it in the description at some point.\r\n\r\nClarification: I measured the shout as a physical object carrying and pushing the air that it goes through, since that is how it acts in the game. I did not measure it as a very strong wind or something that dissipate, rather something that solidifies the air in front of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation - \r\nDownload with NMM (Recommended) \r\nor\r\nDownload manually.\r\nExtract.\r\nDrag and drop into skyrim/data.\r\nThis shouldn\\'t conflict with anything besides mods that change Unrelenting Force directly.\r\n\r\nPlease comment if you want to know how I found out the force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
