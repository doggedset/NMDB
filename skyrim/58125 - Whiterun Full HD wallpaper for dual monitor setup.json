  "descriptionHtml": "Because I am returned back yesterday to an amd graphic adapter, which I´m very happy about, I have made for my own use some wallpapers for my dual monitor setup in an resolution of 3988x1080. \r<br />You maybe would ask, why that resolution and not 3840x1080.\r<br />It´s because of I have created an eyefinity group with bezel compensation on my 2 displays which compiled this resolution.\r<br />\r<br />Because I thought today, that maybe some nexus users would really like to have some wallpapers of skyrim for a dual monitor setup I decided to upload this first screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />I have made the screenshot´s with uGrids 7.",
