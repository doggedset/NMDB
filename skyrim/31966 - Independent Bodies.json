  "summary": "Provides wearable CBBE and UNP bodies as well as a framework for allowing the use of armor made for those body mods (and potentially others) regardless of whether they have that body installed or not. brokefoot\\'s UNP mashup compilation has already been adapted and now works with any body.",
  "descriptionHtml": "CONTENTS\r\nOverview\r\nNotes\r\nChanging meshes/textures\r\nInstall/uninstall instructions\r\nCredits\r\n\r\nOVERVIEW\r\nThe fragmentation of Skyrim armor mods amongst the varying body types has bothered me for a while. I like having vanilla bodies generally, but wanted the opportunity to use armor made for UNP and CBBE. This mod is the solution I came up with. There are no scripts, no new races, and no race changing involved; simply items. Existing armor using UNP or CBBE textures can be adapted to work with this mod entirely within the CK--no mesh editing involved.\r\n\r\nThe main file Adds 6 items: the body, hands, and feet of both UNP and CBBE. Wearing these items gives you that body mod\\'s body, hands, and feet, with appropriate textures for your race. They can be made at a tanning rack out of thin air.\r\n\r\nFor an example of an armor mod working with this, see: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31983\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTES\r\nCBBE Argonians and UNP Khajiit and Argonians are supported by the esm but the textures are placeholders. Installing appropriate textures (see the next section) will allow you to use this mod with those races.\r\n\r\nI know there is a neck seam. I need to find a set of textures such that the head matches the vanilla, CBBE, and UNP bodies. Or body textures that match the head texture.\r\n\r\nThis will not make all armor mods magically work on any body--the armor\\'s esp must be slightly modified first to take on textures appropriate for the body it was originally made for. I have already done this with Brokefoot\\'s mashup compilation; it\\'s available here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31983\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGING THE BODIES OR TEXTURES\r\nBodySlide presets are included to change the CBBE body (including nevernude options). Run BodySlide, and under Outfit/Body, select a body ending in \\\"Independent\\\". NOTE: Selecting a body that doesn\\'t end in Independent will likely overwrite your standard body. Caliente\\'s BodySlide must be installed separately.\r\n\r\nAlternately, the meshes and textures can be changed the same way you would change vanilla textures, but with a slightly different file path.\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female becomes:\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\CBBE\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female and\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\UNP\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female.\r\nThe meshes folder works the same way.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, to change the UNP installation to UNPB:\r\n1. Download UNPB.\r\n2. Install the UNPB meshes into\r\nData\\\\meshes\\\\UNP\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALL\r\nUsing NMM is recommended for ease of removal, but you can also just dump the esm and textures and meshes folders into Skyrim\\'s Data folder.\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL\r\nNMM makes uninstalling super easy, but if you need to remove it by hand:\r\n1. Delete the esp and/or esm file\r\n2. Delete the folders:\r\nmeshes/CBBE/\r\nmeshes/UNP/\r\ntextures/CBBE/\r\ntextures/UNP/\r\n3. Delete all files in the Bodyslide folders with names ending in \\\"Independent\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\nCaliente\\'s CBBE body+textures: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r\ndimon99\\'s UNP body+textures: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709",
