  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15022]Skyrim Commander[/url] now includes all these functions plus more[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][b]Direct Input Paste v2.4.[/b][/color] Made with AutoHotkey on Windows 7 64-bit. Will work on Windows 7 full function. Should work on Windows Vista x32/x64 full function.\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][b]Introduction:[/b][/color]\r\nCopy a console command from Desktop and simulate paste into Skyrim console.\r\nSwitch between Skyrim and Desktop fast without using Task Manager trick on fullscreen Alt-Tab. No more double Alt-Tabbing.\r\nTune your master volume with your KeyBoard. For those that rely on multimedia KB volume control such as Logitech G15.\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][b]Main Feature:[/b][/color] In Skyrim, pasting text (Ctrl+V) into console normally isn\\'t possible.\r\nDirect Input Paste is a workaround, allowing simulated keystrokes of your clipboard\\'s copied text.\r\nYou still will be able to use Ctrl+V within Windows.\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=aqua][b]Hotkeys:[/b][/color][/size]\r\n[b]Ctrl+Alt+V[/b] = Simulate keystrokes from your clipboard. Paste a copied command to Skyrim console.\r\n[b]Ctrl+Alt+Up Arrow[/b] = Switch to Skyrim. Alternate to Alt-Tab. No more double Alt-Tabbing back to Skyrim.\r\n[b]Ctrl+Alt+Down Arrow[/b] = Switch to Desktop. Skyrim will pause, same as it does when Alt-Tabbing.\r\n[b]Ctrl+Alt+Left Arrow[/b] = Volume Up. Increments of 5. Left Arrow matches slider control, for finer tuning.\r\n[b]Ctrl+Alt+Right Arrow[/b] = Volume Down. Decrements of 10. Right Arrow matches slider control, for finer tuning.\r\n[b]Ctrl+Alt+M[/b] = Volume Mute.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, Skyrim can be running before starting Direct Input Paste and vice versa.\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][b]How to Install, use and test the exe (fast & easy):[/b][/color]\r\n 1. Extract the \\\"+Direct_Input_Paste_v2.4.exe\\\" file from the downloaded zip wherever you like.\r\n 2. Run \\\"+Direct_Input_Paste_v2.4.exe\\\". IF Skyrim is Run as Administrator, Run this exe as Administrator.\r\n 3. Select a Skyrim console command (e.g., from internet browser), copy the text with Ctrl+C or right-click menu.\r\n 4. Switch to Skyrim, Ctrl+Alt+Up Arrow.\r\n 5. Simulate keystrokes into Skyrim console with Ctrl+Alt+V. Don\\'t use Ctrl+Alt+V outside of console or where text input isn\\'t an option.\r\n * Increase your Volume, Ctrl+Alt+Left Arrow. Increments of 5.\r\n * Decrease your Volume, Ctrl+Alt+Right Arrow. Decrement of 10.\r\n * Mute your Volume, Ctrl+Alt+M.\r\n * Switch back to Desktop, Ctrl+Alt+Down Arrow.\r\n ^ Note: You can decompile the \\\"+Direct_Input_Paste_v2.4.exe\\\", to check it\\'s integrity;\r\n   ( http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic6973.html )\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]< Use either the exe or the ahk >[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][b]How to Install, use and test the ahk (requires AutoHotkey installed):[/b][/color]\r\n 1. This is an AutoHotkey script. Download and install AutoHotkey; http://www.autohotkey.com\r\n 2. Extract the \\\"Direct_Input_Paste_v2.4.ahk\\\" file from the downloaded zip wherever you like.\r\n 3. Run \\\"Direct_Input_Paste_v2.4.ahk\\\". IF Skyrim is Run as Administrator, Run this ahk as Administrator.\r\n 4. Works the same as the exe. See the above steps, 3, 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][b]How to exit Direct Input Paste, exe or ahk:[/b][/color]\r\n 1. The script will continue to run indefinitely, until you exit. To exit the script;\r\n    a) Right-Click the green AutoHotkey (H) in your Notification Area (next to clock) and select Exit.\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]Notes & Warnings:[/b][/color]\r\n* There is a 100 character and one line limitation on simulated paste. This was implemented to decrease user issues.\r\n* Wait for the clipboard to be sent, as it will continue to send after you Alt-Tab, switch windows and exit the current input.\r\n* Don\\'t press any keys when your clipboard paste is being simulated.\r\n[b]Why limits?[/b]\r\n* Previous versions would send multiple lines of text, however, upon further testing I found it to be unreliable.\r\n  Not all command lines would be completed. To execute multiple commands, run as a batch;\r\n   a) Create a new text document in your Skyrim directory with name of choice.\r\n   b) Paste in your list of commands and save the file.\r\n   c) Execute the list in console with \\\" bat filename \\\". It is much faster and reliable.\r\n  + You will now receive a message box informing you if multiple lines have been copied, when attempting the send.\r\n    This will take you to desktop. Switch back to Skyrim with Ctrl+Alt+Up Arrow.\r\n* To prevent extended hijacking, there is a 100 keystroke limit. Don\\'t copy text over 100 characters long.\r\n  + You will now receive a message box informing you if over 100 chars have been copied, when attempting the send.\r\n    This will take you to desktop. Switch back to Skyrim with Ctrl+Alt+Up Arrow.\r\n* Possible conflict: If your playing Skyrim on Intel graphics such as Intel HD 3000 the Ctrl+Alt+Arrow hotkeys could conflict with Intel graphics screen orientation hotkeys. You can disable those screen orientation hotkeys by reading here: http://www.jaws-users.com/text/Windows/DisablingScreenOrientationHotkeys.html\r\n\r\nScript created by Guru82 for Skyrim Nexusmods.com using knowledge from various forums.\r\nThis script was not a simple copy and paste job. It took an idea, research and lots of testing.\r\n\r\nCredit to AutoHotkey (GPL); Chris Mallett (Chris), Steve Gray (Lexikos) and everyone who works with AutoHotkey. Thanks.",
