  "summary": "Thief\\'s Refuge- The Thieves Guild old headquarters. Abandoned, but still littered with jewels and gold.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I always thought that joining the Thieves Guild didn\\'t give you enough. This is a collection of rooms and tunnels with a forge, smelter, enchanting table as well as an alchemy station. It has lots of chests so it\\'s perfect for the thief that gets over-burdened. The place is littered with diamond and other valuable jewels. To get in, you must go to the Bee and Barbs counter(where Keerava is) and steal the key from there. The Thief\\'s Refuge is under Riften.\r\n\r\nI am planning to not only extend the Thief\\'s Refuge to new areas, as well as other entrances, but to make a quest to get inside. At the moment, it\\'s not very big, but it\\'s a great home for someone that needs a great base to craft and store things.\r\n\r\nChange Log:\r\n1.0\r\nInitial Release",
