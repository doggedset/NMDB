  "descriptionHtml": "I sort of made this on a whim last night. It utilizes Keos' skimpy armor for a non re-placer. I made quite a few of them (if not most) craftable. \n<br />\n<br />Basically I loved the skimpy armor, but it's pretty lore breaking when everyone woman looks like they're freezing their asses off... not to mention \n<br />the danger of it all.\n<br />So who else would charge into a freezing battle half dressed?\n<br />\n<br />A BARD of course!\n<br />\n<br />All the bard class armors and clothes are half their normal weight and half the base armor rating of their respective category. For a little touch of realism.\n<br />\n<br />______________________________\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This is just sort of a test of an idea. I haven't modded since Oblivion, so a lot of re-acquainting to TES kit. I've tested a few and it seems pretty\n<br />solid so far.\n<br />\n<br />*Have a basic understanding of manual modding*     ....and maybe some intuition if I messed something up. XD\n<br />\n<br />INSTALL: \n<br />1) Unzip files to your skyrim directory or use mod-manager.\n<br />\n<br />2) Download \"Killer Keos Skimpy CBBE V2-V3 Armor Replacer\" file: \"aNMM Ready Installer for my Replacers and Custom armors\" manualy. \n<br />\n<br />BUT DO NOT INSTALL! OPEN HIS ZIP FILE AND NAVIGATE to 01mainmod/normal\n<br />\n<br />3) Move all the contents from Keo's meshes/ARMOR/ folder to: Skyrim/data/meshes/armor/Keos Skimpy/\n<br />\n<br />4) Move all the contents from Keo's meshes/CLOTHES/ folder to Skyrim/data/meshes/clothes/Keos Skimpy/\n<br />\n<br />5) Move all the \"clothes\" folder from Keo's textures/ to Skyrim/textures (allow overwrite if it comes up, there's only a couple files)\n<br />\n<br />6) Move \"02 dawngaurd/normal/\" and \"03 dragonborn/normal/\" contents in the same fashion.\n<br />\n<br />7) Make sure SkimpyCraft.esp and SkimpyCraft_DLC are check in your load order.\n<br />\n<br />SHOULD BE READY TO GO! ^o^/\n<br />\n<br />______________________________\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />In game they'll be craftable at a forge.\n<br />\n<br />Or type \"help bard\" in console to 'cheat'. For reference, each item ends with the suffix \"_bard\". For example \"ironarmor_bard\"\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />A couple of rare items are craftable only by destroying the normal rare item. For example, the 'Savior's Hide'. So if you just want to play around with\n<br />this, back up your save files first. Or use console commands instead of crafting.\n<br />\n<br />happy skimpy skipping in Skyrim, you sultry saucy bard!\n<br />\n<br />~nikita",
