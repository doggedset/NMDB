Disclaimer[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This is an older mod that was not released on the Nexus before. I have not worked on it for several years, nor have I played the game.\r<br />I cannot guarantee that it still works properly. However, I have seen it being used in screenshots every now and then so it does seem to work still.\r<br />\r<br />Not only is this mod old, it was also never finished. Meaning that many features that you might expect from a custom race mod are missing. This includes skill bonuses, spells abilities and so on.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is published &#34;as is&#34;. Due to unfortunate circumstances I am unable to offer any kind of support.\r<br />Why release an old, unfinished mod? Because I remember people were looking forward to these races a long time ago, but never got the chance to try them.\r<br />\r<br />[b]I. Description[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Previously known as &#34;Otherworldly Beings&#34;, Xenonomicon is a selection of custom races that were made in 2012 and 2013. \r<br />It includes the following races:\r<br />\r<br />- Obscuuri (male and female)\r<br />- Gorgon (female)\r<br />- Rusalka (female)\r<br />- Dryad (female)\r<br />- Leshy (male)\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://xenius.imgur.com/]More images can be found here[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]II. Installation[/b]\r<br />\r<br />&gt; Use 7zip or WinRar to extract the files\r<br />&gt; Find the Skyrim folder here: Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim\r<br />&gt; Place the OwB.esp and OwB.bsa files in your Data folder\r<br />\r<br />[b]III. Uninstallation[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Remove OwB.esp and OwB.bsa from your Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b]IV. Requirements[/b]\r<br />\r<br />- RaceCompatibility for Skyrim and Dawnguard by TMPhoenix\r<br />\r<br />[b]V. Recommendations[/b]\r<br />\r<br />- RaceMenu by Expired \r<br />\r<br />RaceMenu is not required to make the mod work properly. I do recommend installing it anyway; as it will allow you to pick any colour for both hair and skin. Without the menu, it would be hard to match the Gorgon&#39;s tentacle hair with the skin.\r<br />\r<br />[b]VI.
