  "descriptionHtml": "I Just wanted to share something as the community has given me so much, although not impressive I made some menu replacer music for myself. And I thought I would share.\r\nThis is an Instrumental only, and it fits the basic main menu picture nicely (my personal opinion)\r\n\r\nThe song <Ice Pond> is Korean, it has no words as stated above. So enjoy >:D\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twEImwWgphM\r\n\r\n- Fun facts!\r\n1. If anyone DL/likes this I have some more I could upload as I think they would fit the replacer to (that and I\\'m making myself a new one)\r\n\r\n2. If people think I did an OKAY job I could add more asian style music in different forms, like battle and so on. I have replaced audio with varying success over the years on different things and for other games for example M&B series and oblivion(who didn\\'t mod oblivions music? ha!)/etc\r\n\r\nOther songs with/without words would be from:\r\n\r\nthe People\\'s Republic of China,\r\nSocialist Republic of Vietnam,\r\nKorea, Republic of \r\nDemocratic People\\'s Republic of Korea,\r\nMAYBE Japan/others\r\n\r\n- I may take requests if you need me too -\r\n\r\nNeed help? Should work fine if you have a retail, up to date Skyrim. Pirates got hanged for a reason! :P (Any other questions ask me.)\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this for any reason why not :) (own mod etc fine) please don\\'t upload this to steam.\r\n\r\n<all songs have been edited, to a degree that you could at least upload them here-to Youtube or any other site without it breaking any content rules, though that isn\\'t / won\\'t be an issue. :)\r\n\r\nEnjoy~",
