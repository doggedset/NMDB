  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Comic Sans MS]This was created to my personal taste.\n<br />I tried to get a better coherence between the Falmer Ceiling Glow and the Glowing Mushrooms, typically in the caves.\n<br />\n<br />Because I play at 1080p on an 8 year old PC, a 1K texture (2x the dimensions of vanilla) is sufficient for me. Thus, this is the only and final version.\n<br />\n<br />I do not use ENB, so I have no idea what the result will be.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18069/]Also on the SE website:\n<br />[/url]\n<br />I share this with the Skyrim community. Not to be used for financial gain, whatsoever. You may use it otherwise as you wish.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to Bethesda for this life-invading game, and to Nexus &amp; community for completing the invasion. Couldn't have done it without you![/font]",
