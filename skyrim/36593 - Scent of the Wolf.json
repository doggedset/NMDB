  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Description[/b]\r\nAfter installing this mod wolves and werewolves will no longer attack you when you are a werewolf in human form. Your current horse and follower also won\\'t get attacked by wolves until you decide to cure your lycanthropy.\r\n\r\nThis is a remake of the mod with the same name, this version takes a different approach and only affects characters who are actually able to transform into werewolves.\r\n\r\nWolves will still attack you when you just installed this mod, it is only after your first transformation after installing this mod that they will stop attacking you in human form.\r\n\r\n[b]Instructions[/b]\r\n1. Install the mod\r\n2. Transform into beast form\r\n3. Wait until you are human again and enjoy your friendly relationship with wolves\r\n\r\n[b]Compatibility[/b]\r\nSpecial care was taken not to override any fixes by the Unofficial Skyrim Patch. Therefore this mod includes the fix that turns off the werewolf comments by NPCs when the player is cured.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately compatibility with other werewolf mods is not ensured, since it overrides the werewolf magic effect script and the companions quest.\r\n\r\n[b]How it works[/b]\r\nAfter you transform this mod adds you to a new HumanWerewolfFaction which is friendly with wolves and allies with werewolves. After you transform back to a human you will keep these relations until you decide to cure your lycanthropy. Your horse is also made friendly with wolves during this alliance with wolves.",
