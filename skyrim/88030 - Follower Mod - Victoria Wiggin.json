Now, Navmesh doesn&#39;t want to work, so I couldn&#39;t add a house to Skyrim to get to the house. You will have to player.placeatme the 4 characters to see them. If someone can tell me how to use Navmesh, thanks greatly.",

I will have to look into it. Victoria Wiggin is a one handed / archer with daedric armor.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexandria Wiggin is a mage with spells coming from the Archmage, because it is hell to get spells in Creation Kit.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shiloh Wiggin and Bec Wiggin are both normal dogs. If someone wants them upgraded, send me a message.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said with Navmesh, it doesn&#39;t want to work. So, I am going to put these four into another house, maybe a player house, maybe a house from a mod.",
