  "modId": 24194.0,
  "modName": "A Lil Representation",
  "summary": "So I noticed that there were a few missing follower race types in Skyrim (female Argonian/Bosmer/Khajiit, Altmers, etc.) so I decided to try and make some to fill the void.",
  "descriptionHtml": "***I removed a dialogue error with Jinkee that kept multiple followers from following. (v0_31)\r\n\r\nMy intent is to make at least 2 of each race in the Vanilla game that has no representatives. Hence this mod being: A Lil Representation.\r\n\r\nNow I\\'m not very good at modding, the best I can do is play around with templates so I\\'m sorry to say that I most likely won\\'t have any accurate voices for the follower types that don\\'t already have them in the Vanilla game. Just pretend damn it! Unless someone wants to inform me of working stock voices someone made already. \r\n\r\nAnyway, everyone levels with you and is essential because losing IRL/AFK connections is hard enough in our short time in human form.\r\n\r\n[b][u]TO INSTALL[/u][/b]: Use NMM OR Throw everything into your Skyrim installation directory. Activate the esp with your launcher of choice. The zip files contain a data folder with the mod contents, a little info in case you like to do it manual.\r\n\r\n[u]TO UNINSTALL[/u][/b]: Just use NMM OR\r\n1) Dismiss follower and save, \r\n2) Deactivate Xesp\r\n3) Delete Xesp\r\n4) Delete Meshes\\\\Actor\\\\character\\\\facegendata\\\\facegeom\\\\ALRcharacter.esp\\\\xxxxxxxx.nif\r\nAND Textures\\\\Actor\\\\character\\\\facegendata\\\\facetint\\\\ALRcharacter.esp\\\\xxxxxxxx.dds\r\nAND Textures\\\\Actor\\\\character\\\\facegendata\\\\facetint\\\\ALRcharacter.esp\\\\xxxxxxxx.tga\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b][u]The Representatives[/b][/u][/center]\r\n[u][b]Jinkee Thundercat[/b][/u], is a Khajiit that I have made in the likeness of my cat. She\\'s from the streets. Her claw attacks are electric and will sometimes throw her victims a few feet away. If she\\'s too far from her enemies, she\\'ll shoot lightning from her fingertips until she gets close enough to punch them in the face. She\\'s at the Bee and Barb in Riften.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Atayan the Hopeless[/b][/u], he\\'s Altmer with nothing to live for. After losing everything he loves to an ambitious politician, he was left in Skyrim for dead. Saved by a wandering troll (he killed it with his bare hands shortly after), now he spends his days making up for not being able to use magic by wrestling bears, and learning how to bring back life to the dead...Permanently. Though he can\\'t use magic other than necromancy, he can drain anything he touches of life, magic, and stamina. He\\'s at the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Morala the elderly[/b][/u], she\\'s an old Altmer who has seen the suffering her people has caused others. She went into hiding after years of being an assassin. Now she waits for a chance to make the world a better place. She helps the Dragonborn out by inflicting sharp and magical pain on those who get in their way. She\\'s also at the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Nana Ng the maid[/b][/u], she\\'s an Argonian house maid. She can read, cook, and clean. Fighting isn\\'t her strong suit. You can find her at the Jarl\\'s house in Riften.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Kleevaguh the clever[/b][/u], she\\'s an escaped Argonian slave. She knows a little magic but prefers to fight up close with two weapons and light armor. You can find her hiding out at Beggar\\'s Row in Riften. You might find her in desperate need for an upgrade in the armor department.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Kremari the lackadacious[/b][/u], she\\'s a Bosmer hunter who likes to live a simple life. She\\'s an archer, but she can dual wield and heal herself when she has to. You can find her at the Drunken Hunstman in Whiterun. Don\\'t ask her about her tribe, she won\\'t show you where they are.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Paongong the steady[/b][/u], he\\'s an escaped Argonian slave. Made after my turtles, who ran away and/or died. He\\'s best with one handed blunt weapons and heavy armor. His magic skills are more defense oriented. Also found at Beggar\\'s Row in Riften. Being another runaway slave, he also needs to go shopping for armor. Made after my turtles, who ran away and/or died.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Dusty the housecat[/b][/u], a fresh on the field Khajiit mercenary who likes to stick to a distance with her bow. When things do get close, she keeps a big sword to deal with it. She\\'s at the Winking Skeever in Solitude carrying some Skooma.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Kushka the berserker[/b][/u], an orc raised for killing, but she was too nice so they sent her out to gather valuable goods. You can find her currently at the Dead Man\\'s Drink in Falkreath. Spending some time with Sue Tiel has taught her some magic, which she gladly uses when she can. Otherwise, axe murder.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Siella the REDguard[/b][/u], she\\'s came to Skyrim with Sue Tiel. She\\'s at the Dead Man\\'s Drink in Falkreath, trying to stay warm. If she wasn\\'t broke, she would buy better armor to defend Sue Tiel with. Hopefully the magic she learned from her friend might help.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Sue Tiel the halfling[/b][/u], she\\'s in Skyrim because of a rumor about a soulless killing machine. Using the help of a Dremora Lord and her magic, she aims to collect the bounty on the rumored God Hand beast. Spending time with Siella has resulted in her familiarity with less magical skills, but she has little use for it. She\\'s also at the Dead Man\\'s Drink in Falkreath.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Manny the chicken[/b][/u], a soulless killing machine...Stuck in chicken form after Dibella punished him for trying to breed with some of her worshippers. He can\\'t do much but carry your things and distract enemies. Fortunately for you, he can use some of his infinite power to freeze enemies in place, allowing you the leisure to dispose of them as you please or run away. Being a chicken, he can\\'t open doors so he takes a while to catch up to you (try fast traveling somewhere, then he\\'ll catch up). You can also send him to attack an enemy, but the most he can do is distract and freeze it. ***Very over powered. Save your game before hiring this guy. He can be found at the prison in Falkreath.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Rikil the diver[/b][/u], a Redguard with an unusual interest for dwarven things. You can find him in the library at the College of Winterhold. He likes to throw balls of fire and punch things in the face while wearing the thickest armor along with a cloak of flame.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Odese the dreamer[/b][/u], he\\'s a lazy Bosmer hanging out in Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead. If you get in to trouble, he\\'ll call his familiars and use his ghost sword & bound sword to run into the mix regardless of the odds. Otherwise, he would really just prefer to stay somewhere and relax. \r\n\r\n[b][u]Rayna the freelancer[/b][/u], a Redguard light mercenary sent to kill Odese but called it off because her horse froze to death. Now she\\'s stuck at Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead waiting for a chance to go home. She likes to use her scimitar and shiv up close, but she\\'s not above sending a few arrows out beforehand. She also hates the cold.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Maybe kids + 2 old people IN THE FUTURE and interesting scripts if/once I learn to script write?![/b][/u]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI recommend [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15524]AFT[/url] because it makes basic followers like mine pretty awesome. You can turn your followers into werewolves or vampires. \r\n\r\nI hope this brings some kind of pleasure/joy to anyone who dares to try it. If there\\'s anything weird happening in relation to the followers, please tell me and I\\'ll look into it. As I get the chance to field test each one, I\\'ll be making balances so they don\\'t die so fast or kill everything too nicely. So don\\'t be shy to let me know if someone\\'s too strong or weak in whatever aspect.\r\n\r\nAlso, check this bad mofo out. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10565]Mushrooms[/url]",
