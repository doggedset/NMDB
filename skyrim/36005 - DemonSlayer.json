I don\\'t consider it to be over powered but if you do then feel free to make the adjustment in CK for yourself.\r\nIt has been styled to look more brutish than anything else. has HD textures,\r\n\r\nI would also like to thank all the people who suggested names for a sword i posted a while back.\r\nI have used some of those names, so for this one thank you Victoria G for the name...\r\nSorry no requests, if you have a problem feel free to post it and a fix will be uploaded as soon as i see the post.
