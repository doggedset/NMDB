  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]ABOUT BETHESDASCRIPT FILE BUILDER FOR BETHESDA GAMES[/size][size=4]\r<br />[/size][size=2]\r<br />If you&#39;re looking for the precious version, check here; https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54194?\r<br />\r<br />BethesdaScript is THE batch file builder for Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind (in the form of files you can paste into scripts with the Morrowind CK), Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4. Supporting targeted scripts and a whole bunch else, you&#39;ll spit out a batch file capable of putting any mod to the test. This application is an extension and rebuilding of the original Torvus Reloaded that I coded a few years ago. Given the expansion of certain games, I thought it prudent to redesign the application to accommodate all of the Bethesda Softworks games that use console commands.\r<br />\r<br />It will take a while to code, but I am personally aiming to have at least a working beta finished and ready for use in late March.\r<br />\r<br />[/size]PLEASE DL AND ENDORSE&#33; :) Thanx&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[i][b]THIS APPLICATION IS NOT ENDORSED, CREATED BY IS ASSOCIATED BY BETHESDA SOFTWORKS, ZENIMAX MEDIA OR ANY OF IT&#39;S ASSOCIATES OR SUBSIDIARIES.
