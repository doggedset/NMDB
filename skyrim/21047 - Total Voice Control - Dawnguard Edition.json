  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=1](Republished here with the explicit permission & support of the author.)[/size]\r\n\r\nTake TOTAL control of your Skyrim experience with over 250 Voice Commands \r\nincluding Menus, Movement, Shouts, Dual/Chain Casting/Wielding \r\nand control of your Follower, your Companion & even your Horse!\r\n\r\nNOTE:- For Skyrim 1.7.7 / English ONLY\r\n======================================\r\nDawnguard-compatible with brand-new Stage 6 (Teleports & Set Swaps)\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=red][b]WARNING[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[size=4]This project not only has the power to change the way you play Skyrim, \r\nbut it also has the power to change the way you [b]THINK[/b] about playing Skyrim, forever![/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]THIS IS A PROJECT NOT A DOWNLOAD-AND-FORGET PLUG-IN![/u][/center]\r\nIf you\\'ve never manually installed & tweaked a Skyrim mod yourself, this is probably not the wisest place to start - to get the best out of the project you\\'ll need to be(come) comfortable editing profiles & configuration files as well as copy/pasting files in various places within the Skyrim folder layout.\r\n \r\nHowever a lot of time has been spent over the last 6 months making it as easy to follow as possible. You don\\'t need to be a \\'geek\\' to follow it and full support is on hand should you need it.\r\n\r\nThe full STVC project is a six-stage \\\"integrated compilation\\\" of ten or so of the best & most useful mods & plug-ins for voice control ....\r\n\r\n[center][color=yellow]* all included with the written permission of the individual authors.\r\n\r\n* with customised configuration files, profiles & \\'tweaks\\' supported by\r\n easy-to-follow instructions, demo & tutorial videos \r\n& some useful, printer-friendly \\'crib sheets\\'.\r\n\r\n* the only other thing you\\'ll need is a (decent) PC microphone![/color][/center]\r\n\r\nComments have been disabled because the author has no access to reply to them, however a dedicated email account has been created so that you can get prompt, private support \\\"straight from the Lions\\' Den\\\":-\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i216.photobucket.com/albums/cc224/LionOfNarnia/stvcsupportemail2.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\nThe prime \\'public\\' support location (part of the official VAC support forum) remains:-\r\n\r\n[size=4][center][color=blue]http://www.dwvac.com/vac_phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=9[/color][/center][/size]\r\nThis should be regarded as the FAQ & Comments section for VAC in general & STVC in particular.\r\n\r\n[center]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[b]DISCLAIMER.[/b]\r\n\r\nThis project exists because of, and is reliant upon, a third-party commercial application called \\\"Voice Activated Commands\\\" (VAC). This is not Skyrim-specific & can be configured by the user for ANY keyboard/mouse dependent PC (XP/Vista/7) game or application. However the latest versions have been specifically developed in consultation with several Skyrim/STVC users to provide functionality & flexibility that is unmatched by ANY other application, Kinect included. The VAC installer included in the project is a fully-functional 30-day trial of the latest stable release version.\r\n\r\nIf you are the kind of person who thinks that they have the right to have everything they want for free, that people who have spent YEARS developing & supporting a worthy product should not be compensated for it, then \\\"jog on, kitty\\\".\r\n\r\nWithin the project documents is a link to a special registration arangement on the VAC website, for STVC users only, that gives lifetime support & updates for HALF the normal price, that\\'s less than the cost of a movie ticket. The support is VERY good, the developer is responsive to the needs & wishes of the users - He says he enjoys the challenge!\r\n\r\nThe author of this project does not seek donations & has neither sought nor accepted any kind of \\'reward\\' whatsoever from the developer of VAC or anywhere else for that matter. \r\n\r\nThat\\'s just his personal choice.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/center]\r\n\r\n [b]And finally ...[/b]\r\n\r\nIt is sincerely hoped, by both the creator of VAC & by the author of this project, that it can be of benefit to at least some of those people who cannot use a keyboard in the same manner that most of us just take for granted..... It\\'s only a hope, and a prayer - not a demand or a condition. \r\n\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][center]* * * * * * * * * \r\n[b]Uploaders\\' personal comment.[/b]\r\n\r\nI [b]AM[/b] one of those “people who cannot use a keyboard in the same manner that most people just take for granted”, I lost my right hand when I was 10.... I am an STVC user, and fan, I have also made minor contributions to the development of VAC. When I found out that the project wasn’t available here I got in touch with the Lion to offer my help. I endorse all that’s been said above, the project is flexible, powerful & stable and the support is friendly, fast & effective. The VAC program supports other games as well.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * [/center][/color]",
