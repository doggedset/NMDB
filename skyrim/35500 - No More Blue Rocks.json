  "descriptionHtml": "I was tired of waiting for the mod teams around the nexus to fix this so I committed my afternoon to it; now those little rocks are gone&#33;  They are ugly in the vanilla version but stay the same as everything is made better by HD packs.  They aren&#39;t affected by some lighting mods and look completely out of place.  Not only are they ugly but you find them floating in some areas - totally immersion breaking&#33;  I tried numerous ways to make them work correctly but nothing worked out so I just decided to kill them off.\r<br />All you need to do is place this after the load order for any mods that alter lighting and/or landscape and you will never see those things again.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3381541/?tb=mods&pUp=1]Check out my other mods&#33;[/url]",
