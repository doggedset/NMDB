  "descriptionHtml": "Bards attend classes (version 1.0)\n<br />====================\n<br />by Axhoff\n<br />\n<br />[b]﻿Users of the latest “Unofficial Skyrim Patch” or “Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch” do NOT need this mod.\n<br />[/b][b]\n<br />[/b][b]I will leave the mod up for those that, for whatever reason, are not playing with the Unofficial Patch installed.[/b][b]\n<br />[/b][b]\n<br />I will not be porting this mod over to Skyrim Special Edition.\n<br />[/b]\n<br />This mod changes the schedules of the students and some teachers to be in the right class at the right time. Classes now take place during the weekdays. The dialogue scenes have been changed in a way that they will now only play during their classroom sessions (no more 'ghost' sessions).\n<br />\n<br />This mod does not (nor will it in the future) fix or touch other Bards College quests.\n<br />This mod does not add new quests or dialogue.\n<br />This mod does not add npc's, followers or almighty swords of power. It's just some extra immersion (when it works).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Class schedules (from monday to friday):\n<br />\n<br />Lute   by Inge      from: 4am-8am (upstairs classroom on the left)\n<br />Song   by Pantea   from: 8am-12pm (upstairs classroom on the right)\n<br />History   by Giraud   from: 2pm-6pm (downstairs library)\n<br />\n<br />The dialogue is triggered by walking into the classroom.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Bugs? Sure, plenty!\n<br />===================\n<br />\n<br />It's still possible that some dialogue takes place without all studens/teachers present. This is caused by them being 'under way'. Solution: just wait or come back some other time.\n<br />\n<br />In some cases the dialogue doesn't start. This can happen if you've previously visited the Bards College with an old save where this mod isn't active. Just leave Solitude and give it some time to reset things (usually 10 or 30 game days).\n<br />\n<br />Sometimes the Bards will be in the courtyard standing and/or playing. This can happen after the buring of King Olaf. Same solution applies here, just leave Solitude alone for 10-30 game days. (happened with me where Jorn would play drums 24/7... he sure loves his drums...)\n<br />\n<br />Some of the other bard's quests mess with peoples schedules, this mod works best before the Bards College quests are started or some time after you've finished them.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />version history:\n<br />================\n<br />\n<br />1.0 initial release.\n<br />-------------------\n<br />The following people have changed ai packages:\n<br />Aia Arria, Giraud Gemane, Illdi, Jorn, Ataf, Pantea Ateia, Viarmo.\n<br />\n<br />Added sleep package to Ataf\n<br />Added Sit and read package to Viarmo\n<br />\n<br />Modified all SolitudeBardsCollegeClass Attend packages.
