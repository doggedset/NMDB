  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#5ea2e5][b][size=6]Description:[/size][/b][/color]\r\nChanges several NPC\\'s to be a bit improved (imo), including 11 children (optional). There are three core components:\r\n\r\n[color=#5ea2e5]Better NPCs[/color] - Made but not released yet since I have one big esp for all my changes but it has many I wouldn\\'t want to release. Will be things like Housecarls and a few more popular NPC\\'s.\r\n[color=#5ea2e5]Better NPCsII[/color] - part two, which changes a few more minor NPC\\'s rather than the very mainstream changed ones.\r\n[color=#5ea2e5]Better Children[/color] - changes several children (only girls thus far), mostly giving them eye color rather than that soulless evil black stare they have in vanilla *shudders*\r\n\r\nI\\'ll go into detail regarding each core component now:\r\n\r\n[color=#5ea2e5][b][size=4]Better NPCs[/size][/b][/color]\r\n[color=grey]Not released[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#5ea2e5][b][size=4]Better NPCs II[/size][/b][/color]\r\n[color=red][u]Requirements:[/u][/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url] - ApachiiHair.esm, ApachiiHairFemales.esm\r\n\r\n[color=#5ea2e5][b]The following NPCs were changed:[/b][/color]\r\nGerdur - I just never really liked how she was so dirty and I made her prettier while I was at it\r\nSigrid - Just some improvements to her. You can\\'t have her anyways, so it\\'s kinda taunting you.\r\nCarlotta - She\\'s supposed to be propositioned by every man in Whiterun, so I made her look the part (imo).\r\nRoggi Knot-Beard - He was my favorite marriage option in vanilla but he just didn\\'t have a very attractive face - I changed that. He should be a much better catch now.\r\nBalimund - Another improvement for marriage options. Since he\\'s an option, I decided to improve him a bit.\r\nVorstag - Same as the other two men. He\\'s a marriage option, so I made him purdy. :P\r\n\r\nYeah yeah, you made them \\\"better\\\" (so you say!)... whatever. Let me see them!\r\n[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/images/40510-2-1376778912.png[/img]\r\n[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/images/40510-1-1376778912.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nIf you want Serana and Valerica in similar style, grab [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/40341]Serana and Valerica Redone[/url].\r\n\r\n[color=#5ea2e5][b][size=4]Better Children[/size][/b][/color]\r\nFirst up, they\\'re still potato head clones. So if you have a mod that changes them completely and you prefer that you probably don\\'t want this. This is just some very minor changes.\r\n\r\n[color=red][u]Requirements:[/u][/color]\r\nHearthfires DLC\r\n\r\n[color=#5ea2e5][b]Children changed:[/b][/color]\r\nMila Valentia - given blonde hair and green eyes to match her mother in part II\r\nBabette - given pale skin and black hair\r\nBraith - given darker redguard skin and amber eyes\r\nDorthe - given some eye color\r\nRuna Fair-Shield - eye color\r\nHrefna - eye color\r\nSvari - eye color\r\nSissel - eye color\r\nBritte - eye color, slight hair color change\r\nLucia - eye color\r\nSofie - eye color\r\n\r\n[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/images/40510-1-1376780298.jpg[/img]\r\n[i]Note: Babette will have vampire eyes and fangs, she\\'s just inherited my vampire eyes. She\\'ll have whatever ones you have in your game.[/i]\r\n\r\n[color=#5ea2e5][b][size=6]Changelog:[/size][/b][/color]\r\nAugust 26, 2013: 1.1 - Better Children: Babette given a black blood stained dress.\r\nAugust 17, 2013: 1.0 - Better NPCs II, Better Children initial versions",
