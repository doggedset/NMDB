  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod&#33; \r<br />It requires all of the DLC.\r<br />\r<br />All containers should be perfectly safe. It contains crafting stations, so it may feel balance unfriendly. Lore wise it is still in tact.\r<br />\r<br />Minor edits include very little terraforming (to prevent clipping) and two deleted fences.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Sovengard&#39;s fire is muted because I needed the resource, but to be fair I personally thought it was annoying to constantly hear &#34;CHHHRRRCHHHSSSHHCH&#34; while getting wasted in Nord heaven or hanging out in the woods. This may be fixed, but I need to figure out the sound it makes.\r<br />\r<br />There are multiple safe containers, a vertical book shelf that I personally made using the CK, and various crafting pieces, including:\r<br />Alchemy table (namesake), an anvil, sharpening stone, wood chopping block, and a work bench.\r<br />\r<br />Please report any bugs in the comments&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Bethsoft/Bethesda and their amazing creation kit, and TES Alliance for their tutorial on bookshelves.\r<br />ENB Used: Tetrachromatic by dptheslothking. I highly recommend it.",
