When skyrim released dawnguard they added lots of new powers and abilities for vampires but they also made them easier to play. This mod not only Rebalances the vampiric system in skyrim but it also restores some of the original settings to give you a challenge and a new gameplay experience. This mod is lore friendly and doesnt overdue itself with lots of powers that you probably wont use it doesnt require skse or script dragon or anything like that. best of all this mod gives you a reason to feed. =]\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                         Vampires Rebalanced: version 2.5\r\n                                              ~~~~~~~ Features ~~~~~~~ \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRenamed the powers so they stay close together\r\n\r\nedited all the texts to provide better description and quality to the reader.\r\n\r\nChanged the seduction power and servant power to lesser so they can be used more than once a day\r\n\r\nVampires sight can now toggle on and off\r\n\r\nincreased the timer for when you reanimate a dead body now its 180 seconds\r\n\r\nrestored skyrim original weaknesses and resistences but rebalanced them for this mod.\r\n\r\nVampiric Drain buffed up alittle and bennefits from the Duel Destruction perk also tells you the damage & the duel cast damage so u know what u get when u duel cast.\r\n\r\nnow vampires servant is unlike any other necromancy spell because unlike other spells where the being u reanimated disinigrates into an ash pale vampires servant does not allowing you to reanimate it again or find a stronger being to reanimate\r\n\r\nFrost Resistence is stronger when your feed not when your starving\r\n\r\nadded 3 new active effects one of wich was given to all skyrim vampires but was not available to the player\r\n\r\nAdded 2 new powers to vampires that are useful\r\n\r\nmodified the seductive power so that it doesnt become useless when you level up\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nI hope you guys enjoy this remember to leave feedback because when i take my time doing something like this is for others to enjoy =]\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n",
