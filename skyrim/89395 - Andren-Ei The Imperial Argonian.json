  "descriptionHtml": "Hello Everyone! This is my first mod and first follower! He's an Argonian Mercenary, currently under contract with the empire. \n<br />He can be found in The Winking Skeever in Solitude, probably naked (to clothe, just ask to trade with him).\n<br />He comes with a full set of imperial gear, but it's not bound to him, so he can wear whatever you'd like him to. He's proficient with a sword/shield, archery, and even some conjuration, as well as heavy armor. \n<br />He will also scale with your character all the way up to level 100, and his minimum is 15. \n<br />Please Enjoy!",
