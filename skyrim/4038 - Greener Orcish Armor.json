  "descriptionHtml": "It\\'s well known that the armor of the Orcs does not have the same look like the weapon sets or even the shield. At least I hope the differences aren\\'t so obvious now...\r\nI tried to give the armor more green to let it look more simliar to Orichalcum.\r\nIt\\'s only a little re-texture of the male and female version.\r\nHope you like my very first mod, though it\\'s created quite without skill...\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n\r\nJust copy the texture folder into the data folder of your Skyrim installation.",
