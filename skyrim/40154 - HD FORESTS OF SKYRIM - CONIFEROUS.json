  "summary": "A high-resolution re-texture for the coniferous forests of Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod seeks to enhance the depth of Skyrim\\\\\\'s pine forests, and give them a warmer feel\r\n\r\nThe original landscape texture have been replaced with 2048x2048 real life photographs, with a higher resolution of 200ppi. An improvment from the original 512x512 and 96ppi.\r\n\r\nThe trees have been replaced with a 1024x4096 texture, also with a real life photograph(it was edited a little) and has a resolution of 300ppi. Compare that to the original texture that is 256x1024 and is also only 96ppi. \r\n\r\nThis mod also changes the dead trees to have orange needles and the living ones to have greener needles.\r\n\r\nIf you want me to add different version of this mod up I\\'ll consider it. \r\n\r\nINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\nNo .esp should be needed so i didn\\'t add one to download, so just drag the files to there special places\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL\r\nJust delete the files.",
