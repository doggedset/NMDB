  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever wanted to use some of the game\\'s windows in your Skyrim mod, but ended up feeling very frustrated over the fact that most of them are embedded into other models you may not want like walls?\r\n\r\nThis package contains 19 different windows that have been separated to the best of my abilities using NifSkope, which should give you much more freedom and flexibility in how you want to use them.\r\n\r\nThis pack only provides the raw .nif files without a .esp library, so to use them you need to create new statics in the Creation Kit, and refer it to the desired model contained in data/meshes/window\r\n\r\nNOTE: The windows shown in the screenshots use the textures from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6971/?]Visible Windows[/url]. Nope, couldn\\'t be arsed to disable it!",
