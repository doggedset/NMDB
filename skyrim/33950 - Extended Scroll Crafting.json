  "descriptionHtml": "[color=greenyellow]Update to version 1.1[/color] - Added scroll creation workbenches to all the vanilla player owned homes. Does not include ones added by DLC.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds the ability for the player to craft scrolls, using a new type of enchanting table. If adds a new location with one of these new workbenches.\r\n\r\nI thought that scrolls were really under-used when I was playing the game for a number of reasons. I found myself hesitant to use a scroll beacuse the only way to get another one was to either buy it or get it randomly as loot. I made this mod which allows you to craft new scrolls, this means you can use them in fights and as a source of income.\r\n\r\nScrolls can be enchanted at the Inscription table. You need a roll of paper and the spell tome of the spell you want to create a scroll of. A scroll of fireball requires a spell tome of fireball for example.\r\n\r\nThe roll of paper will be consumed in the process, but the spell tome will not and can be used as many times as you want.\r\n\r\nOnly scrolls you have the tomes to make will be shown in the window, to reduce clutter. You can make more rolls of paper by using ruined books on the inscription table.\r\n\r\n[youtube]7t5L0NJUKWQ[/youtube]\r\n\r\nThis mod does not require any DLC.\r\n\r\nThere are no currently known compatibility issues, if you have any specific concerns please tell me and I will investigate.\r\n\r\nTo install this mod, download the .rar and use the nexus mod manager. Or you can drop the .esp file into your Data directory if you don\\'t use the mod manager.\r\n\r\nCreated by mackam08 aka IrksomeBadger.\r\n\r\n=============\r\nRELEASE NOTES\r\n=============\r\n\r\n========================\r\nv1.1.0\r\n========================\r\n\r\nDate of release: 26/03/2013\r\nPurpose: Content Update\r\nNotes: Added scroll creation workbenches to all the vanilla player owned homes.\r\nReleased by: mackam08 aka IrksomeBadger\r\n\r\nCHANGED CELLS\r\n=============\r\n\r\n_esmshack (Wilderness)\r\n\r\n========================\r\nv1.0.0\r\n========================\r\n\r\nDate of release: 26/03/2013\r\nPurpose: Initial release\r\nNotes: Player can now craft scrolls.
