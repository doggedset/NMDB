  "descriptionHtml": "Update: Thanks to readyno from reddit, and  Eiries from Skyrim Nexus, I learned that I left the esp file out of my original upload. Sorry for that. It&#39;s in there now.\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re like me, you often find yourself saying, &#34;Why isn&#39;t Scary Terry in Skyrim?&#34; I&#39;ve tried to remedy that with this mod. This is just a taste of the larger Rick and Morty mod that will be done at some point. In the meantime, I encourage you to enjoy this mod, but more importantly, watch Rick and Morty on Adult Swim, because if that show goes off the air I won&#39;t have any new characters to put in Skyrim.",
