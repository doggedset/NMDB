  "descriptionHtml": "A Khajiit is alone outside of the Tower of Mzark and is in need of some help to retrieve his lost weapon. \r\n\r\n=====================\r\nBrief Description\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nRa\\'shiik\\'s Talon adds a new quest, weapon, and a voiced follower. Ra\\'shiik is a nightblade able to train others in the use of one-handed weapons. If you decide to help him retrieve his missing weapon, he will offer to travel with you. Ra\\'shiik does not take the place of a companion and is capable of all basic commands.\r\n\r\n=====================\r\nInstall/Uninstall\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nTo install, open the folder RashiiksTalon and move Rashiik.bsa Rashiik.esp and sound to the skyrim/data folder.\r\nTo uninstall, delete Rashiik.bsa Rashiik.esp and the folder Rashiik.esp found under skyrim/data/sound/voice\r\n\r\n=====================\r\nMore Info\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nAfter my first mod, Engineering, I decided I wanted to try experimenting more with dialogues and try my hand at making a quest. I plan to add in a small dungeon and add more dialogue and interaction with Ra\\'shiik later on. I also realize my microphone isn\\'t that great, so until I get a better one, you can always make use of dialogue subtitles.\r\n\r\n=====================\r\nFuture Updates\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nAllowing Ra\\'shiik to summon and mount a horse when the player gets on one.\r\nCreating a dungeon that is involved with the quest.\r\nMore backstory and misc dialogue, like side comments about the environment and events.\r\n\r\n=====================\r\nKnown Issues\r\n=====================\r\n\r\n*Possible conflict with \\\"Let followers relax\\\"\r\n\r\n=====================\r\nUpdates\r\n=====================\r\n1.02:Ra\\'shiik will now change gear properly. (Removed temporary fix from before.)\r\nFixed some scripting issues which caused some dialogue problems.\r\n\r\n1.01: Ra\\'shiik now will properly wield two weapons.\r\nRa\\'shiik will now be available as a normal follower after completing his quest, this is meant as a temporary fix to him not equipping better armor.\r\nRa\\'shiik is now in the potential marriage faction as per request. I haven\\'t tested this yet and dialogues may not be available for male Khajiit. I\\'ll look into this more later.\r\n\r\nFeedback is always helpful, please let me know if you run into any bugs or have any suggestions.",
