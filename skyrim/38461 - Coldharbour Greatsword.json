  "descriptionHtml": "This is an old, creation kit release era mod that has been on the Steam Workshop for a long time. I only uploaded it here because it was requested.\r\n\r\nAdds a powerful, yet balanced, and lore-friendly artifact of Molag Bal. The Coldharbour Greatsword is a deadly two-handed sword which absorbs magicka, deals frost damage, and steals the souls of its victims.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIntended to be used by Shadowknight type-builds, the sword is statistically similar to a Daedric Greatsword but slightly more powerful (25 base damage instead of 24). \r\n\r\nIt is custom enchanted with 25 points of Magicka Absorb, 25 points of Frost/Stamina damage, and 3 seconds of Soul Trap with a reasonable amount of charges. \r\n\r\nIt can be tempered with an ebony ingot and is affected by Daedric Smithing. \r\n\r\nVisually, it is a reskinned Dwarven Greatsword with a particle effect. \r\n\r\n-------------------- \r\n| How to Obtain | \r\n-------------------- \r\n\r\nWith Daedric Smithing, the sword can be crafted by combining a Daedra Heart and the Mace of Molag Bal at a forge. \r\n\r\nYou may also convert the Coldharbour Greatsword back into the Mace of Molag Bal by combining it with a Daedra Heart at a forge (under Misc). \r\n\r\n--------------- \r\n| Other Info | \r\n--------------- \r\n\r\nDawnguard is not required. \r\n\r\nThis was my first attempt at creating a visually customized item and it\\'s not perfect, but it turned out fairly well. There\\'s a minor issue with a texture seam I wasn\\'t able to fix, but it is not too noticable. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------- \r\n| Check out my other mods | \r\n----------------------------------- \r\n\r\n\r\nSotha Sil\\'s Mageblade\r\nNexus Link: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38463/?\r\nOn Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=90890034 \r\n\r\nUnburied\\'s Drain Spells\r\nNexus Link: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38462/?\r\nOn Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=43131846 \r\n\r\n",
