  "descriptionHtml": "hi whats up folks...\r<br />here i want to share my more decap blood mod. since changes in ini files at skyrim always suck i modified the art object decapbloodspray01 in the meshes bsa with nifskope. \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Easy install\r<br />[/u][/b]just download with your favourite manager and install. bam , you are done. dont forget to activate of course.\r<br />\r<br />this is the only version. if people want even more or reduced versions i could do them on request.\r<br />\r<br />you dont have to worry about your load order or anything at all since bloodsprays and such are managed in the meshes.bsa of Skyrim and should work with all dlc and even other mods that dont change decapbloodspray01.nif . and as far as i know no mod does that yet. correct me if i am wrong.\r<br />\r<br />here is video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4cAIeQMGeo\r<br />\r<br />so in the end happy decapitating\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]UPDATE\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u][u][b]More Decap Blood (for Enhanced Blood Textures) is not mandatory for more decap blood to work. this file is only for Enhanced Blood Textures and purely optional\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u]the mod enhanced blood textures will play the same decap animation like vanilla Skyrim after the original animation has ended just at half the size. in the download section you will find a new file modified for this animation. now it plays the animation at half the size of my mod.\r<br />\r<br />MANUAL INSTALL ONLY\r<br />\r<br />go to the enhanced blood textures install folder and replace the meshes folder with the meshes folder from my file\r<br />\r<br />DO NOT FORGET TO MAKE A BACKUP OF THE ENHANCED BLOOD TEXTURES MESHES FOLDER just in case you want to revert the changes\r<br />\r<br />since this for an already existing mod i want to credit dDefinder for Enhanced Blood Textures ",
