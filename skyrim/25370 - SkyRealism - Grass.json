It uses the exact same method outlined in [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3288]Lush Grass[/url] by SparrowPrince. I highly recommend downloading Lush Grass for the increased mesh density. I also recommend [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/141]Skyrim Flora Overhaul[/url] by Vurt. Both of those mods were used in the screenshots here, along with my SkyRealism - ENB Evolved Cinematic Preset.\r<br />\r<br />This mod DOES cost you some FPS. On more modern graphics cards (GeForce 500 series and Radeon HD 6000 series) you&#39;ll only notice a 5-10 FPS hit. On older graphics cards, it can be a much higher penalty. If you are experiencing large FPS penalties, you can use a mod which does not increase grass density as much as this mod does (e.g. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9185]Glorious Grasses[/url]). Alternatively, you can disable shadows on grass via the Skyrim.ini file.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Installation[/heading]You&#39;ll need to make sure that your Skyrim.ini file has the following settings under [Grass]:\r<br />[code]bAllowLoadGrass=0\r<br />bAllowCreateGrass=1\r<br />bDrawShaderGrass=1[/code]\r<br />Other than that, simply drop this in your Skyrim Data folder and enable it like any other mod.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Credits and Thanks[/heading]Thanks to SparrowPrince for outlining how to make this kind of mod, and to Vurt for his amazing grass textures.",
