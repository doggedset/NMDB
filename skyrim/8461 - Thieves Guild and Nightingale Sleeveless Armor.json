  "descriptionHtml": "-=If you liked this mod, please hit the endorse button!=-\r\n\r\nAlso available through [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=8692]Steam[/url] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=15049]Workshop[/url]\r\n\r\n================\r\nLatest Update 1.7:\r\n================\r\n\r\n* Corrected a lighting issue on the arms of linwe\\'s armor, sleeveless thieves guild armor, sleeveless nightingale armor & thieves guild gloves.\r\n\r\n* Fixed a 3rd-person clipping issue on the armpits of the male version of sleeveless armor and linwe\\'s armor.\r\n\r\n* Updated circlets with new models from the latest version of my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7696]Armored Circlets[/url] mod.\r\n\r\n* Lowered prices on unenchanted armor, raised price on gauntlets of backstabbing.\r\n\r\n===========\r\nIntroduction:\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a sleeveless version of the normal, improved & guild master\\'s Thieves Guild armor, with 4 possible color combinations, matching circlets, boots, gauntlets & hoods, and unenchanted versions. Now includes sleeveless nightingale armor, un-masked hood, and unenchanted versions of all nightingale armor.\r\n\r\n===========\r\nWhat It Does:\r\n===========\r\n\r\nYou can find / purchase these new armor variants from several possible locations, depending on your stage of progress in the Thieves Guild quest line.\r\n\r\nTonilia, your starting fence in the Ragged Flagon sells the basic version of all new Thieves Guild armor, as well as the original set, and also unenchanted versions. These are available to purchase as soon as you have completed \\'Taking Care of Business\\' and receive your first set of armor from her.\r\n\r\n* Tonilia also sells unenchanted nightingale armor, as well as disenchantable Thieves Guild gauntlets with the backstab enchantment, and boots with the muffling enchantment.\r\n\r\nGulum-Ei, the argonian fence in the Winking Skeever tavern in Solitude sells the improved versions of all new Thieves Guild armor. These are available to purchase as soon as you have completed \\'Scoundrel\\'s Folly\\' and Gulum-Ei becomes available as a fence, assuming you didnt kill him of course! Gulum-Ei also sells the original set of Thieves Guild armor; this is worth noting because after completing \\'Scoundrel\\'s Folly\\', Tonilia offers to exchange a single piece of your original armor for an improved version, however neither the sleeveless nor recolour versions offered by the mod are eligible for this exchange, and unless you complete this step Tonilia will no longer be available as a fence.\r\n\r\nThe Guild Master\\'s Tribute Chest that spawns after you have completed \\'Under New Management\\' and officially become the new head of the Thieves Guild, now contains the Guild Master\\'s version of all new Thieves Guild armor.\r\n\r\nAll the new armor variants offered by this mod can be improved as leather at the smithing table; the enchanted versions require the arcane smithing perk, and the unenchanted versions do not. Neither version can be improved until you have joined the thieves guild, in case you choose to give yourself these armors using the console.\r\n\r\nNote that all Thieve\\'s Guild armor have also had their sale value reduced to 1 gold; this is to enable you to purchase your preferred variants of armor without spending tens-of-thousands of gold.\r\n\r\nIf you were using a previous version of this mod where the armors were obtained through smithing; none of your armors should have disappeared, they will simply no longer be available for creation / reforging at the smithing forge.\r\n\r\n===========\r\nOld Updates:\r\n===========\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.1:\r\n\r\n* Black & grey boots can now be improved at the smithing table.\r\n\r\n* No longer requires daedric smithing perk to see under smithing tab.\r\n\r\n* Black & grey armors now show correct inventory models for females.\r\n\r\n* Can now be returned to original model & color, at a modest cost.\r\n\r\n* Removed superfluous \\'Brutal Elven.bsa\\' file from archive.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.2:\r\n\r\n* Thieves guild armor & advanced thieves guild armor now treated as leather for the purposes of armor set perks; can be combined with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7672]Armor Set Fixes[/url] to allow it to be doubly improved (up to legendary with 91 smithing skill) with steel smithing perk.\r\n\r\n* Added craftable circlets for brown, grey & black armor sets. These require the appropriate color hood to craft, and cannot be reverted to hoods.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.3:\r\n\r\n* Added support for improved & guild master\\'s armor sets.\r\n\r\n* Armors now appear in the smithing forge only if you are at the appropriate stage of the thieves guild quest to have that type of armor. Additionally, the original and improved armors disappear from the smithing forge once you have the guild master\\'s armor.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.4:\r\n\r\n* All armors added by this mod are no longer created through smithing; you simply purchase them (for 1g a piece) from Tonilia for the basic and unenchanted versions, Gulum-Ei for the advanced versions, and the Guild Master\\'s versions can be found inside the Guild Master\\'s Tribute Chest.\r\n\r\n* Added unenchanted versions, available for purchase from Tonilia the fence in the Ragged Flagon.\r\n\r\n* All Thieves Guild armor values have been reduced to 1 gold each.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.5:\r\n\r\n* Nightingale armor now comes in sleeveless version, as well as a maskless hood. These replace the existing models of these armors found throughout the game, including those worn by Karliah, Brynjolf and all other nightingale NPCs.\r\n\r\n* Added unenchanted nightingale armor, available for purchase from Tonilia the fence in the Ragged Flagon.\r\n\r\n* Tonilia also now stocks disenchantable gauntlets with the backstab enchantment, and boots with the muffling enchantment.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.6:\r\n\r\n* Thieves Guild & Nightingale Sleeveless armor have been separated into their own mods.\r\n\r\n* You can now buy both normal & maskless versions of the unenchanted Nightingale hood.",
