  "modName": "Unbalanced Ring for RPG playing",
  "summary": "Adds a ring with all necessary enchantments for playing.\r<br />Can be used for wearing whatever armor you want and still having all effects.",
  "descriptionHtml": "WARNING: This mod is not balanced at all.\r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT: Unequip the ring before upgrading to the next version or your save file can get bugged&#33; Unequip the ring before uninstalling or your character will gain its stats for permanent&#33;\r<br />\r<br />NMM compatible.\r<br />\r<br />When I started to switch between some nice armors of different modders all over this site I got bored by crafting, fortifying, enchanting and so on everytime to get back to the stats needed to be able to still kill stuff. So i added a ring for me to have all the stats needed to play whatever I want. A mate of mine then wanted this thing too and asked me to upload it, so here it is.\r<br />\r<br />There is a light and a heavy version of it and it can be crafted at a forge out of nothing. (Not lore friendly? well idc.)\r<br />Even if the inventory model is a silver ring it does not use the ring equipment slot and has no equipment model.\r<br />I know this can be abused very easily, but it&#39;s your decision what to do with it.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s a full list of all stats given by the ring:\r<br />Base armor rating of 600. (cap)\r<br />Spells cost 100% less to cast.\r<br />All Weapons deal 200% increased damage.\r<br />Increases carrying capacity by 200.\r<br />Resist 100% of magic/frost/shock damage. (cap is still 85%)\r<br />Resist 200% of fire damage. (to reach cap as a vampire)\r<br />Resist 100% of poison damage.\r<br />Can fortify weapons and armors 100% better. (same as a full set of this w/o alchemy)\r<br />Unarmed strikes deal 100 additional damage.\r<br />Resist 100% of diseases.\r<br />Take no falling damage. (Note: Does not affect your horse.)\r<br />Can breathe under water.\r<br />Sneak attacks with one handed melee weapons do double damage.\r<br />Created potions are 100% more powerful.\r<br />Prices are 50% better.\r<br />Time between shouts is reduced 20%.\r<br />Block 100% more damage with your shield. (cap is 85%)\r<br />\r<br />As requested I added another more overpowered ring into the game, the &#34;Imba Ring (plus)&#34; with additional stats, you can wear both at a time, but this one has no longer the &#39;replacer&#39; effect of the first, its stats are those:\r<br />Become invisible while sneaking. (Bugs if used with the Shadow Warrior perk.)\r<br />Move silently.\r<br />Increases Health/Stamina by 500.\r<br />Increases Health/Stamina regen by 250%.\r<br />While sneaking you are 500% harder to detect.\r<br />\r<br />Any other wishes? Let me know.",
