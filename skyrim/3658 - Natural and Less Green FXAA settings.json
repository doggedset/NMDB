  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"Natural and Less Green FXAA settings\\\" gets rid of the greenish atmosphere of skyrim and gives the game a more natural and fresh look.\r\nI tried to use a lower saturation than the original FXAA setting and a natural choice of colors in order to mantain the immersion of the game: the best results can be seen indoors and during night.\r\nThe latest version has Pre and Post sharpen: the FXAA Anti-Aliasing is deactivated in every version (in my opinion it makes the game look worse) but feel free to toggle it on with the FXAA_Tool if you want: you can also adjust other settings like the sharpen if necessary.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nDownload FXAA Post Process Injector 2.0 and install it (works with 2.0 only):\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=131\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nDrop the injFX_Shaders folder in the main folder of Skyrim and overwrite.\r\n\r\nExtra:\r\nUse the pause button in game to to see the difference between FXAA and original.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\nVersion 1.2: improvement to the lights.\r\nVersion 1.1: the sky is a bit more blue and the colors are more balanced; added sharpen version.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nThis is just a setting I came up with for the FXAA Post Process Injector, I didn\\'t create or contributed in the creation of the FXAA Post Process Injector. Look here for all the credits:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=131",
