It has slightly lesser stats than the regular Steel Crossbow.\r<br />\r<br />The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, [b][u]requires Dawnguard[/u][/b], and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />This was a request from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/2347283/?]blaholtzen[/url], who made the beautiful 1k textures of the crossbow and wanted to have them in the game. I simply made the bolt textures (which explains why they&#39;re so ugly in comparison, haha&#33;) and put the mod together in the Creation Kit.\r<br />\r<br />I added the crossbow to the leveled list  [i]DLC1LItemWeaponDawnguardCrossbowLoot75Gated[/i]  and, alongside bolts, to the inventory of the NPC  [i]DLC1LvlDawnguardMissile[/i]  so they&#39;d appear in the world. Any mod that makes changes to them may prevent the new crossbow from appearing in game. It can also be crafted at the forge, no skill requirements. You can temper the crossbow with an iron ingot. The bolts can be crafted at a regular forge at any point during the game with an iron ingot and some firewood.\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1869302/Skyrim/Banners/Knotwork.png[/img][/center]",
