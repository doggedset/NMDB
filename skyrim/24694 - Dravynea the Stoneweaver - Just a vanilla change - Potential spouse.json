  "summary": "Did you see the vanilla marriable women in Skyrim? Probabbly you dont like them. But they have a good heart! But still dont like them. Well, here\\'s just a vanilla change so you can now give a try to that ignored-woman in the game, like Dravynea.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[i]Hi all! This is my 6th mod, and [b]I really want to [u]thank you for the support[/u] on this![/b]\r\n\r\n[color=olive]So, you know that is a marriage option in Skyrim, wich is limited to a few women (and a couple of guys) targeted in a short list. If you discount the dark-evil woman the list gets shorter. And if you discount the girls wich you probabbly dont like because they aren\\'t hot as Sylgja, the list is even shorter. But, [b]who are them?[/b] I mean, the other-ignored girls in this last point? Did you ever listened to them? They used to have better stories, better backgroud, or even better quest than the others...[/color][/i]\r\n\r\nLike [b]Dravynea the Stoneweaver[/b], a dunmer from Morrowind who cares about the safety of the mine in Kynesgrove. [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Dravynea_the_Stoneweaver]Here[/url]\\'s the lore of her so you can take a look to her quest. Actually, [b]she doesn\\'t have a huge lore[/b] (I think that [b]Borgakh[/b] or [b]Brelyna Maryon[/b] have a better history), [b]but she indeed has a noble propouse to stay there[/b]. Also [b]she has a more reserved look[/b] (that\\'s why I dont get good and clear pictures of her face), but I think that its part of her reserved personality and suits better to her if she stays like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIm using the[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812] Better Females by Bella[/url] mod, but [b]this is [u]just a vanilla change[/b][/u]. If you have got another texture\\'s for woman (or if you just have the vanilla version), its NOT a problem. Probabbly you should get a less smooth skin, but the face change should be there. Anyways, I really recommend the mod.\r\n\r\n[i]If you like it, you may try my other vanilla changes:[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]Brelyna Maryon[/b]: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24435]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24435[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Avrusa Sarethi[/b]: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24500]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24500[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Borgakh the Steel Heart[/b]: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24418]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24418[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Ysolda[/b]: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24413]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24413[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Lydia[/b]: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24661]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24661[/url]\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\n",
