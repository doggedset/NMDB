  "descriptionHtml": "---README---\r\n\r\nfor PRINCESS\r\n\r\nby DALL\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n\r\n03/12/2012\r\n\r\nHordes of vile Daedra are back! High martial prowess and unique vocal talents of real Dragonborn are - once more - desperately needed! \r\n\r\nStory so far: Costal Patrol and large rescue party sent to find them - have disappeared without trace and it is now up to you to resolve this mystery. \r\n\r\nPrincess is multi-category mod with added (realistic n tough) fight Quest. It brings to Skyrim: new / previously unseen (interior) location, new powerful foes, two sets of their arms n armors (remade n improved - Daedric gear - brand new HD textures), location shop with rare items, crafting facilities n recipes. And (Main Quest) meet new / unique character / your potential follower - Warrior Princess - Lea.\r\n\r\nStart location - Stranded Rowboat (on Map) / Skytemple Ruins - North - East of Winterhold / Winterhold College of Magic.\r\n\r\nThis mod is supplied with all for it necessary models/textures but it can be improved further with some other (my stand-alone) mods: \r\n\r\nRecommended additions:\r\n\r\nNoble_Furniture\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7564\r\n \r\nAlchemy_Workbench\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7866\r\n \r\nArcane_Enchanter \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4332\r\n\r\nTo install you need to navigate to your Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim - game folder and paste / drag n drop in it my Data (mod) folder. Allow overwrite!    \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like this mod, simply delete / remove my mod .esp (plug-in) as well as (check for names my unpacked mod) files from Data/meshes/ DallsGear and armor/daedric; weapons/daedric together with textures from Data/textures/DallsGear n armor/daedric; weapons/daedric. \r\n\r\nBugs/conflicts: should be none.\r\n  \r\nUse:\r\nFree to use but if any files included (therein) are to be used for modding ask me for permission!\r\n\r\nImportant: For start - use save/s made somewhere other then Skytemple Ruins island.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and remember - if you find it fun - to give endorsement! \r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for really great game.\r\nPS. Is this mod worth your time? If you can still think for yourself and you are not afraid to try something else a bit more complicated and deeper layered - not found or represented in Nexus Top 100s mod shallows at all - it definitely is! I have been making game extending and retexture overhaul mods for last fifteen years - arguably quite successfully - which makes them all at least worth experimental try. In practice they represent - ten or more of single-purpose / different categories mods squeezed in one (DLC like) package. They were made to be permanent extensions n additions to my own game thus, they are safe n eminently useable but if not wanted - they and their content are very easy to remove without any harmful consequences to your saves.  If interested in other / similar (large-scale / multi-category) mods try - (my) Pine_Wood_Lodge, Arch_Mages_Tower, Proudspire_Castle and Temple.\r\n",
