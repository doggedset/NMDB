  "summary": "Brighter colors for Argonians",
  "descriptionHtml": "***This mod would conflict with any other mod that replaces the argonian skin textures, including the raptor feet mod*** \r<br />\r<br />-Adds several new skin tints \r<br />-Brightens existing skin tints \r<br />-Adds modified Argonian skin texture \r<br />-Adds new warpaint/face colors \r<br />-Adds a preset of the argonian in the preview picture \r<br />\r<br />This mod creates brighter colored Argonians, as well as adding a few more shades of skin color: purple, blue, teal, black, and gold. \r<br />\r<br />It brightens most of the existing shades, like white, red, and green. \r<br />\r<br />It also imports a modified argonian skin texture, which is tweaked to be brighter and less green. \r<br />\r<br />Also added are new warpaint and face colors: light blue, dark blue, dark purple, black, gold, lime, teal, and dark pink. \r<br />\r<br />The above screenshots are NOT before and after, they are just screenshot of all the skintones. \r<br />\r<br />The mod is also applied to Argonian NPCs \r<br />The unnatural skintones will not be applied to any NPCs, they may be brightened but will retain their skintone. \r<br />\r<br />Known Issues:\r<br />Sometimes the skintones fail to show up\r<br />Sometimes the hands do not match the skintones\r<br />\r<br />The only way I&#39;ve been able to fix it is by uninstalling, running the game, then closing the game, and reinstalling. It may help to start a new game or open showRaceMenu. If someone knows a better fix let me know.",
