  "summary": "Why can&#39;t I buy an axe to chop wood? Gotta steal Faendal&#39;s Axe? This fixes that immersion problem.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The Problem:\r<br />Ever tried playing an honest character in Skyrim? One who not only doesn&#39;t steal, but doesn&#39;t loot dead bodies, doesn&#39;t even take things that don&#39;t belong to him/her. Ever try working at a lumber mill or Inn chopping wood and then realize that you&#39;re going to have to steal an axe to do some honest work? Maybe you decided to try your hand at mining, but you&#39;d have to take another miners pickaxe or save up 5000g and buy a pickaxe with a bonus house to go with it.\r<br />\r<br />The solution:\r<br />I simply added Wood Cutters Axe and Pickaxe to each general good store.\r<br />\r<br />Q: If it&#39;s so easy to make why are you bothering to post it?\r<br />A: A lot of people are scared of making their own mods, I was for a long time and this is my first mod. Basically I want people like me to have access to things like this. \r<br />Plus, it&#39;s a little time consuming to make, no point reinventing the wheel.",
