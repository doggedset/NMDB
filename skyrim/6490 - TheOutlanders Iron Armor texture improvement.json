  "descriptionHtml": "=========================\r\n= TheOutlander\\'s Iron Armor Texture Improvement Pack =\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nAuthor: TheOutlander\r\n\r\nVersion: v2.0\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n= Details =\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nThe vanilla textures for iron armour and banded iron armour are sadly extremely low resolution and blurry compared to better textures like steel armour. This texture pack aims to improve the vanilla textures to the best of my abilities. The textures have been resized, sharpened, layered, and adjusted to try and improve the quality without having to remake the textures altogether.\r\n\r\nI created this because I was unhappy with what Iron Armor textures mods I could find (by searching iron), none of which really seemed to focus on improving the quality of the vanilla material (for example what I found seemed to focus on making it black, bloody, shiny new or removing rust). Hopefully some of you will find this pack useful.\r\n\r\nAlso included is an optional banded iron shield texture replacer, to bring it into line with the rest of the armour.\r\n\r\n================\r\n= Installation =\r\n================\r\n\r\n1. Copy and paste the textures folder from the extracted archive into \\\"Skyrim\\\\Data\\\".\r\n\r\n==================\r\n= Uninstallation =\r\n==================\r\n\r\nDelete the following files:\r\n\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\iron\\\\f\\\\cuirassplate.dds\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\iron\\\\m\\\\bootsplate.dds\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\iron\\\\m\\\\cuirassplate.dds\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\iron\\\\m\\\\gauntletsplate.dds\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\iron\\\\m\\\\helmetplate.dds\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\iron\\\\m\\\\helmetplate01.dds\r\n\r\n& also if you also used the optional banded iron shield texture replacer delete:\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\iron\\\\ironshieldheavy.dds\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n= Permissions and Usage =\r\n=========================\r\n\r\n1. 1. You may use the assets from this modification in your modifications.\r\n2. Permission is not required. \r\n3. Credit is required.\r\n4. A link back to the original modification on your file page is required. \r\n5. You must inform me (TheOutlander) of your usage of the assets. You do not have to wait for a reply before you can use them or release your mod, but you do have to at least send me a PM to say you are using them before you release your mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n===========\r\n= History =\r\n===========\r\n\r\nTheOutlander\\'s Iron Armor Texture Improvement Pack v1.0\r\n\r\nIntial release.\r\n\r\n- - - - - - -\r\n\r\nv1b = Fixed alphas.\r\n\r\n- - - - - - -\r\n\r\nv1c = Added optional separate whiter helmet horns download.\r\n\r\n- - - - - - -\r\n\r\nv2.0 = Replaced male & female cuirassplate.dds, gauntletsplate.dds and optional ironshieldheavy.dds with new Bethesda High-Res textures.
