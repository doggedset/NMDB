  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#6d9eeb][b]INTRO[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Having played through the main quest a few times I&#39;ve been restarting Skyrim via Alternative Start: Live Another Life, generally choosing a &#39;you \r<br />start at a campsite&#39; start.\r<br />\r<br />I have found myself disappointed, however, that my nord hunter always starts with knowledge of the arcane arts that I KNOW my nord hunter does not have. While I like that magic is in the world, I do not like that in Skyrim magic skill is forced upon the player. While this batch file doesn&#39;t, on its own, totally rectify this problem of role-playing, it does do the following:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Sets all magical skills to 0. Now you have the choice to develop magic skills or not have them at all.\r<br />[*]Sets Magicka to 0. (Can be raised, obviously, via leveling or enchanted items etc.)\r<br />[*]Sets other skills to normal levels, providing a little boost to marksman, one-handed, light armor and smithing.\r<br />[*]Sets the starting carry weight to 150 (down from 300) because bolting across the plains of Whiterun in search of a deer whilst carting around 300 units of shyte MUST require some form of necromancy (note: weight capacity will increase with stamina. And backpacks via other mods will increase carry weight more immersively).\r<br />[/list]\r<br />I have also added the lowest level (ZUL) of the throw voice shout because I think that this is a skill a nord hunter certainly would have. Although shouts technically involve magic, I think this particular one mimics something one could very easily accomplish without magic (one could throw a stone to distract, or shoot an arrow).\r<br />\r<br />Finally, for my own convenience, I have also set the Timescale to 5.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#6d9eeb][b]INSTRUCTIONS[/b]\r<br />[color=#ffffff][color=#6d9eeb][color=#ffffff]\r<br />[/color][/color][/color][/color][list=1]\r<br />[*][color=#6d9eeb][color=#ffffff][color=#6d9eeb][color=#ffffff]Download file manually[/color][/color][/color][/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6d9eeb][color=#ffffff][color=#6d9eeb][color=#ffffff]Extract file into Steamapps&#92;Common&#92;Skyrim&#92;    (Not into &#92;Data&#92;)[/color][/color][/color][/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6d9eeb][color=#ffffff][color=#6d9eeb][color=#ffffff]Upon new game (after choosing race etc.) type &#39; to get into the console and type [bat nordhunter]  (without square brackets)[/color][/color][/color][/color]\r<br />[/list][color=#6d9eeb]\r<br />[b]OTHER MOD RECOMMENDATIONS[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Here is a list of mods that I use to allow for no magic character builds:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10254/?]Starting Spell Choice[/url] (+ [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55489/?]patch[/url] if using Alternative Start) - to start without flames + healing spells.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43057/?]TOMES[/url] - to increase requirements for learning spells\r<br />\r<br />And no hunter play-through is complete without these essential mods:\r<br />\r<br />Campfire\r<br />FrostFall\r<br />Realistic Needs and Diseases\r<br />Hunterborn\r<br />Alternative Start: Live Another Life + New Beginnings addon\r<br />Warburgs 3d paper map (with no GPS patch)\r<br />iHud\r<br />Animallica (I use the deer variant edition)\r<br />Better Eagle Eye Redux\r<br />Wearable Lanterns\r<br />Realistic Nights\r<br />Fast Respawn\r<br />Take Notes\r<br />Alchemist Journal\r<br />Woodsman&#39;s Shack\r<br />Nature&#39;s Lure - Throw Voice Shouts",
