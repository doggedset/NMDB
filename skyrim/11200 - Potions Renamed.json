  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Potions Renamed\r\nVersion: 1.1\r\nDate: 2/25/2012\r\nCategory: Miscellaneous\r\nRequirements: Skyrim (should work on any version)\r\nAuthor(s): claudekennilol\r\nSource:\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThe first thing that bothered me about Skyrim was that potions were not organized at all.  So when the Construction Kit was released that\\'s the first thing I did when school allowed time for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nI simply went through the CK and renamed each potion that wasn\\'t a quest potion of some kind.  I also didn\\'t touch any thieves\\' guild potions as I couldn\\'t remember where they were used.  So this covers all the potions you\\'ll find in chests, stores, and laying about.  Instead of Weak \\'x potion\\', standard \\'x potion\\', exclusive \\'x potion\\', I renamed them with a Roman Numeral at the end.  This way when your list is sorted alphabetically, all of your like potions will be together.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n1. Extract the files to a temporary location.\r\n2. Copy files to (install folder)\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n3. Start Skyrim Launcher (or Bash or whatever mod manager you use), click \\'Data Files\\', place a checkmark beside Potions Renamed.esp.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file(s).\r\n2. Delete Potions Renamed.esp from your Skyrim/Data directory.\r\n3. Delete Potions Renamed.txt from your Skyrim/Data directory.\r\n\r\nif using the steam workshop version, I honestly don\\'t know the \\\"best way\\\" to uninstall.  I\\'m assuming you\\'ll have to manually uninstall it since just clicking unsubscribe on the mod page just stops it from being updated.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.1: 02/26/2012 - Renamed \\'Healing Potion\\' to \\'Balm of Healing\\' and \\'Vial of Magicka\\' to \\'Bottled Magicka\\'\r\n                  so they would be at the top of the list when sorted defaultly by alphabet (quicker access\r\n                  in combat)\r\n                  Also renamed \\'Feather Cordial\\' to \\'Feather Philter\\' and \\'Fireblood Philter\\' to \\'Fireblood Flask\\'\r\n                  (purely for aesthetics)\r\n1.0: 02/25/2012 - Initial release.\r\n0.0: 02/22/2012 - started building\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nThe easiest way to contact me would be to leave me a PM on the official TES forums at claudekennilol.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThe obligatory Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\nThanks to TESNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\nThanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nFeel free to reupload this mod in its entirety (meaning include this readme) to whatever site you want--as long as it remains completely free of charge to the downloader (including if there\\'s a subscription/signup fee for the site).
