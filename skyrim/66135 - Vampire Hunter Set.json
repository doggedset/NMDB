  "descriptionHtml": "The ultimate armor for the ultimate vampire hunter.\r<br />This mod adds am amazing full light armor set specialized for defeating vampires, wearing the full set will render you immune to magic attacks and also very resistant to physical attacks. The weapons and spells do a sick amount of damage without being over powered.\r<br />This armor set and weapons i would recommend to people who are playing on higher difficulties or just want to have fun.\r<br />REQUIRES DAWNGUARD.\r<br />The items:\r<br />-The shield looks and functions as a heavy shield, but it is in fact a light shield (so you get the benefit of both).\r<br />It can be made from level one, but requires things like dragon scales and fire salts.\r<br />-The armor set and the weapons require the steel smithing perk and requires vampire dust, steel ingot and leather strips(different amount depending on the item).Â \r<br />-The spell can be bought from Farengar in Dragonsreach, while it does a lot of damage it does have a 2 sec. charge time.\r<br />the spell also has an effect that creates a light ball on the target( this helps with enemies that can go invisible i.e vampires)\r<br />Possible updates for the future:\r<br />-More spells (near future, suggestions are very helpful).",
