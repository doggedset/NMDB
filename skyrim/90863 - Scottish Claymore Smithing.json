  "descriptionHtml": "SCOTTISH CLAYMORE SMITHING\n<br />This mod adds smithing capability to Billyro's Scottish Claymore (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75116), which is used by permission and with my thanks.\n<br />The original (\"Stendarr's Claymore\") can be found east of Rorikstead.  \n<br />With the Steel Smithing perk, you can craft a steel claymore at any forge and enhance it as your Light Armor smithing skill advances.  Elven Smithing allows you to improve the claymore to a \"burnished claymore\"; Advanced Armors allows you to craft a whetstone from moonstone ore (under \"Misc\" at the forge) and improve your claymore to \"honed\"; the claymore can be finally enhanced with the Dragon Armor smithing perk.  Each version uses the earlier claymore as the main component (I've imagined them as the same weapon, maintained and improved) and is listed under \"Steel\" at the forge.  All versions are fully temperable at any grindstone.\n<br />Installation:  drag the Scottish Claymore Smithing.esp and Scottish Claymore Smithing.bsa files into your data folder, and enable them.\n<br />Removal:  disable the plugin.  The esp and bsa files can then be deleted; you'll lose the claymore, but nothing else will be affected.\n<br />The screenshots include MacGrioghair's Great Kilt (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90398)",
