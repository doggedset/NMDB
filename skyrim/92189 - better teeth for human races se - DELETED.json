  "descriptionHtml": "high res texture replacer for race mouthhuman texture if you are not happy with yours. small mod but for me an important detail i like to \n<br />share with you.\n<br />teeth are changed (texture and normal map) and scaled to fit to the vanilla meshes and many custom human races (tested with \n<br />ningheim and lunari race) and look more natural. as far as i tested i \n<br />can confirm that it works with vampires if no other mod interferes. i \n<br />added a dimmed version for enb/hdr users if standard teeth texture \n<br />appears too shiny. \n<br />\n<br />this is a texture replacer only - no 3D mesh related stuff inside except the optional vanilla mesh replacer with \n<br />subtle mesh changes to be 100% compatible. \n<br />it is not a 3D mod. some 3D mod exist but i like it simple without a risk of compatibilty issues.\n<br /> so i decided to offer this simple but fully compatible version with \n<br />optimized 3D like normal map.\n<br />\n<br />i added an optimized mouthhuman mesh for download. i use it for my characters and npc. vertices are \n<br />slightly larger scaled and replaced to \n<br />fit better with many face meshes but not all. put it in the standard folder and replace vanilla mesh. \n<br />should work with many human races using the standard mesh. in case\n<br /> a race mod includes its own mouthhuman mesh you must replace it in the \n<br />race related folder. see tagged screenshots for possible result.\n<br />no guarantee that this works with all races (i encountered some gliches \n<br />using expressions with lunari) but it should almost. please try and give\n<br /> me feedback if you encounter problems. in case of problem replace with your backup mesh.\n<br />\n<br />installation\n<br />-------------\n<br />for more convenience the replacer files with folder structure for \n<br />replacement of the standard vanilla mouthhuman files are included.\n<br />if you like to use it for your custom races with deviating file structure \n<br />(ningheim race already included) you have to replace the files with the \n<br />same name in the appropriate custom race folder.Â  \n<br />\n<br />thanks to the gimp and nifscope developers, all modders for their beautiful \n<br />races, bethesda and nexusmods.com providing this platform",
