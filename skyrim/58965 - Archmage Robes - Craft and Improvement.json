  "summary": "Improves the Archmage Robes to be equal to the Master level robes. Also provides a crafting recipe to switch between hooded and non hooded versions.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]I always avoided using the Archmage robes because I hated the hood as well as being severely outclassed by the Master Robes of the schools.\r<br />\r<br />[/size]AMR Craft and Improvement enhances the Archmage robes to be equal to the Master level robes in magicka regen. The hooded version has +50 magicka (same as vanilla), the other does not (freedom to apply whatever you want on the head slot).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd966]The &#34;AMRCI Alternate.esp&#34; also increases cost reduction for all schools to 20% up from 15% (Master robes have 22% for a single school). This file requires the main &#34;AMR Craft and Improvement.esp&#34; and should be placed after it in the load order.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#e06666]This does NOT allow you to craft the enchanted robes.[/color]\r<br />[color=#6aa84f]This DOES let you craft [i]non[/i]-enchanted versions of both hooded, and hoodless Archmage robes, as well as the Archmage boots.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#6d9eeb][size=3]Crafting (All recipes appear after you receive the robes.):[/size]\r<br />[size=2]The Enchanted Archmage Robes (not custom enchanted) can be converted between hooded/hoodless at a tanning rack for free. (uses up one to give you the other.)[/size]\r<br />Non-enchanted Archmage Robes (both):\r<br />[/color][list][*][color=#6d9eeb]1 leather[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6d9eeb]1 leather strip[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6d9eeb]2 linen wraps[/color]\r<br />[/list][color=#6d9eeb]Non-enchanted Archmage Boots:\r<br />[/color][list][*][color=#6d9eeb]1 leather[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6d9eeb]2 leather strips[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6d9eeb]1 linen wrap[/color]\r<br />[/list][color=#6d9eeb] [/color]\r<br />Khajiit ears can now show through the hood. The poor Khajiit...that must have been really uncomfortable.\r<br />\r<br />Texture replacers will affect these the same as vanilla Archmage robes/boots.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd966]Incompatible with mods that alter the Archmage Robes. (load AMR after to keep my changes. Load AMR first to lose the enchantment and description changes, but keep the craftable ones.)[/color]",
