  "summary": "This mod aims to add some choices to the rather dull options players have in summoned / companion creatures.  In Vanilla Skyrim my choices are rather weak zombies, skeletons, or just 3 elementals.  I want to play as a Druid or Ranger.  What about Animals?  Or I play as a Shaman, any Spirits / Ghosts?

  "descriptionHtml": "This mod has now been merged with my Plasma Sabers mod and will no longer be updated.\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64807/?\r<br />\r<br />Call Animals \r<br />\r<br />1.1 Requires Creature Resource files&#33;  Adds Leopards, Lioness, Panthers, Lions, and Tigers.  Also added a Lion high level variant, Scar.  Also, added Khajiit Pahmars which look like a Tiger variant.  Also added a high level Panther, Guenhwyvar. I also added these to various level lists, so run a bashed patch if you use any other animal mods.  The new cats will drop new pelts to use for crafting but I also included recipes to craft the pelts with normal Sabre Cat pelts just in case.\r<br />1.0 Initial Release.\r<br />\r<br />This mod uses Vanilla resources only, no DLC required. This mod now uses assets from the free Creature Resource Pack.  I am going to only use the &#39;animals&#39; from that mod.\r<br />\r<br />I know that there are other &#39;animal&#39; mods out there.  But most of them have either out of the way vendors or are part of a larger or script heavy package that I personally can&#39;t run on my laptop.\r<br />\r<br />This mod aims to add some choices to the rather dull options players have in summoned / companion creatures.  In Vanilla Skyrim my choices are rather weak zombies, skeletons, or just 3 elementals.  I want to play as a Druid or Ranger.  What about Animals?  Or I play as a Shaman, any Spirits / Ghosts?  There is only one and it&#39;s outmatched by level 5?  This mod fixes this.  I have added most of the animals in the game as summon spells, both in regular form and as Ghosts.  Both are functionly identical.  (An Ice Wolf is the same as an Ice Wolf Ghost. )  \r<br />\r<br />Note - unlike the Familar summon which is considered a Daedra, all the Ghost animals have the keywords &#39;ActortypeUndead&#39; and &#39;ActortypeGhost&#39;.  This means that silver weapons, turn undead, Dawnbreaker, and the Dawnguard spells will affect them.  Also, all Ghosts have the waterwalking ability. (Except Mudcrab, I left that at waterbreathing. )\r<br />\r<br />There are no restrictions on where you can cast these spells.  So call a Mammoth in Blackreach or a horse in your house. Keep in mind some of these animals are large compared to the default summons.  In my testing I summoned a horse in Breezehome when standing next to the door to Whiterun, the horse appeared upstairs next to the bed.  \r<br />\r<br />Like the skeletal horse in Dawnguard, the horses from this will stay as long as you are mounted.  I did tone down the stats for both Shadowmere versions, they are level 4 just like the default horses.  If you want a powerfull horse, you will still have to do the Dark Brotherhood quests.  Also, both Shadowmere spells use conjuration since even the default one is considered a Daedra.  Guenhwyvar is also considered a deadra but I added both Illision and conjuration versions anyway.\r<br />\r<br />The Ghost spells use Conjuration as normal but the base Animal calls use Illusion instead.  I did this because I figured you are not actually &#39;conjuring&#39; them, you are calling / charming them from the wild and Illusion is the only spell school that deals with animals in any way.  The Conjuration / Illusion Novice - Master perks will effect spell cost as normal.  I tied Novice - Master to the soul level of the mob.\r<br />\r<br />All recipes are found at the Tanning Rack.  The recipes for both normal and ghost versions are identical.  You will need a leveled soul gem and ingrediants from the mob itself.  Just pretend that the soul gem you are using contains the soul of the animal in question. \r<br />\r<br />Novice - Petty Soul (1-3) \r<br />Deer 1 \r<br />Elk 1 \r<br />Skeever 1  \r<br />Wolf 2\r<br />Frostbite Spider 3\r<br />Mudcrab 3 \r<br />\r<br />Apprentice - Lesser Soul (4-15)\r<br />Horse (All) 4 \r<br />Ice Wolf 6 \r<br />Sabre Cat 6\r<br />Spriggan 8\r<br />Large Frostbite Spider 8 \r<br />Snowy Sabre Cat 11 \r<br />Lioness 11\r<br />Leopard 11\r<br />Chaurus 12\r<br />Bear 12 \r<br />Troll 14 \r<br />\r<br />Adept - Common Soul (16-27)\r<br />Cave Bear 16 \r<br />Panther 16\r<br />Giant Frostbite Spider 17 \r<br />Spriggan Matron 18 \r<br />Chaurus Reaper 20\r<br />Snow Bear 20 \r<br />Frost Troll 22 \r<br />Lion 23\r<br />Tiger 25\r<br />\r<br />Expert - Greater Soul (28-37)\r<br />Werewolf Beastmaster 28\r<br />Pahmar 35\r<br />Scar 35\r<br />Guenhwyvar 35\r<br />\r<br />Master - Grand Soul (38+)\r<br />Mammoth 38 \r<br />Mini Mammoth 38 (Same as Mammoth but scaled to 1/3 size )\r<br />\r<br />This mod now uses assets from the free Creature Resource Pack.\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=49682",
