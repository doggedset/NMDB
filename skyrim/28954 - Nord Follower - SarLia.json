  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/AJiVviH.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\nThis is my first posted mod although I have a few that I use myself.\r\n\r\nI created Sar\\'Lia as a complement follower to Lydia, one that is more range combat oriented and mostly stays out of the way, given Lydia just dives right in.  Sar\\'Lia is that follower for me.\r\n\r\nSar\\'Lia is a Nord available in the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood at no cost.  Her combat preference will veer towards the Arcane, but not until higher levels.  Until then, she will tend to favor the Bow but can (and will) also mix it up close and personal if required.\r\n\r\nFull stats and changes made by this mod are listed below.  Nothing has been overridden (checked with Tes5Edit).  I have been using Sar\\'Lia as a follower for a few months and have not noticed any quirks, errors or inconsistencies.  However, this is with my mods and my mod order therefore there is no guarantee the same can be said for your particular setup.  Its always advisable to make a backup save prior to applying any mod and this one is no different.\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/VhsLOZa.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][size=13][b] Installation:[/b][/size][/center]\r\nPlace Sarlia.esp and Sarlia.bsa files into your skyrim data folder, enable mod in plugins file.  Load order should not be an issue given this mod does not change (override) any of the base esm files.  If in doubt or if problems are experienced, try loading at bottom of order.  \r\n\r\n[b][i]Hair[/i][/b]\r\nIn order to save memory space, I manually replaced [b][i]HairFemaleNord03[/i][/b] with the one from an Apachii pack.  If you wish for your Sar\\'Lia to sport the same hair (as in the screenshots), the procedure is as follows (she will otherwise revert to the Vanilla Hair 3 model):\r\n\r\n1. Download [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/download/102916]ApachiiSkyHairFemale_v_1_1[/url]\r\n 2. Extract the following meshes from the archive data\\\\meshes\\\\ApachiiHairFemale\\\\Human\\\\\r\n[list]\r\n[*]hair03.nif \r\n[*]hair03.tri \r\n[*]hairline03.nif \r\n[*]hairline03.tri\r\n[/list]\r\n3. Place above mesh files into [i][b]<your skyrim folder>\\\\data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\hair\\\\female\\\\[/b][/i]\r\n4. Extract the following textures from the archive data\\\\textures\\\\ApachiiSkyHairFemale\\\\Newsea\\\\\r\n[list]\r\n[*]LongBraids_blonde.dds\r\n[*]LongBraids_n.dds\r\n[/list]\r\n5. Place above textures into the same folder structure as in the archive [i][b]<your skyrim folder>\\\\data\\\\textures\\\\ApachiiSkyHairFemale\\\\Newsea\\\\[/b][/i]\r\n\r\nIf you have already installed ApachiiSkyHair and are actively using it, then simply copy the applicable meshes as noted in step (3) above.\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a216/wskof/SarLiaMain_zps8f20f70c.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][size=13][b] Compatibility: [/b][/size][/center]\r\nMod has been tested with and actively used with  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url] since day 1.  Use of any other follower Augmentation mods has not been tested.\r\n\r\nPlace Sarlia.esp prior to the UFO esps in your plugins file.  I believe that I am currently using UFO 1.2g but I cannot attest to that as fact.  Follow instructions provided by fLokii when installing and upgrading UFO.  Sar\\'Lia will Sandbox in the current location when dismissed and is not likely to return to the Sleeping Giant Inn, be aware of that given it is often required to dismiss all followers prior to upgrading UFO.\r\n\r\n[center][size=13][b] Sar\\'Lia Stats and Style Summary:[/b][/size][/center]\r\n- favors ranged combat (Bow and Destruction Magic)\r\n- will tend to default to Destruction magic at higher player levels.  Not exactly sure when the transition from Bow occurs but believe it to be around Level 10\r\n- will heal herself although this is spotty, she has yet to heal me at any time\r\n- prefers Light Armor and will switch to it even if more protective Heavy Armor is in her inventory (seems as though she will switch to heavy armor if the change in protection is drastic enough).  She does, however, come equipped with Heavy Armor (what can I say,  I liked the looks of it)\r\n- she comes equipped with basic complement of Magica Spells, namely Firebolt, Ice spike and Lightning in addition to the base Restoration Heal and Heal Other\r\n- weapon load-out includes Skyforge Sword, basic hunting bow and 100 arrows\r\n- although preferring ranged combat from the fringes of battle, she will mix it up close and personal if required to do so\r\n\r\n[center][size=12][b] Sar\\'Lia Full Details[/b][/size][/center]\r\nRace -> Nord\r\nUnique -> True\r\nEssential -> True\r\nDoesn\\'t affect stealth meter -> True\r\nHeight -> 1\r\nWeight -> 50\r\nVoice -> Female Even Toned\r\nClass -> WKSCombatSpellswordDup (new)\r\n\r\n[b]Stats:[/b]\r\nHealth Offset -> 0\r\nLevel Multiplier -> 1\r\nPC Level Multiplier -> True\r\nBase Health -> 50\r\nCalculated Health -> 50\r\nMagica Offset -> 50\r\nBase Magica -> 50\r\nCalculated Magica -> 100\r\nStamina Offset -> 0\r\nBase Stamina -> 50\r\nCalculated Stamina -> 50\r\nOne Handed -> 20\r\nTwo Handed -> 25\r\nArchery -> 15\r\nBlock -> 20\r\nSmithing -> 20\r\nHeavy Armor -> 15\r\nLight Armor -> 20\r\nPickpocket -> 15\r\nSneak -> 15\r\nAlchemy -> 15\r\nSpeech -> 20\r\nAlteration -> 15\r\nConjuration -> 15\r\nDestruction -> 15\r\nIllusion -> 15\r\nRestoration -> 15\r\nEnchanting -> 15\r\n\r\n[b]Factions[/b]\r\nCurrentFollowerFaction  -1\r\nPotentialFollowerFaction 0 \r\nPotentialMarriageFaction 0\r\n\r\n[b]Relationships[/b]\r\nPlayer Ally\r\n\r\n[b]AI Data[/b]\r\nAggression -> Aggressive\r\nConfidence -> Brave\r\nMood -> Neutral\r\nEnergy -> 50\r\nMorality -> Any Crime\r\nAssistance -> Helps Friends and Allies\r\nCombat Style -> WKScsSpellswordDup (new)\r\n\t\r\n[b]Spells[/b]\r\nFireboltLeftHand\r\nHealing\r\nHealOther\r\nIceSpikeLeftHand\r\nLightningBoltLeftHand\r\n\r\n[b]Perks[/b]\r\nLightFoot\r\nRestorationApprentice25\r\nDestructionApprentice25\r\nIllusionApprentice25\r\nAlterationApprentice25\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]AI Package[/b]\r\nDefaultSandboxCurrentLocation1024\r\n\r\n[bLoad-out[/b]\r\nDefault Outfit -> ClothesTavernWenchOutfit\r\nOutfit Objects -> ClothesWnechClothes01, ClothesBoots01\r\nSleep Outfit -> None\r\nGeared Up Weapons -> None\r\n\r\n[b]Inventory[/b]\r\nArmorDraugrBoots\r\nArmorDraugrCuirass\r\nArmorDraugrGauntlets\r\nHuntingBow\r\nSkyforgeSteelSword\r\nSteelArrow (100)\r\n\r\n[b]Mods Used and Highly Recommended[/b]\r\n[url=http://www.enbdev.com/index_en.htm]ENB[/url] by Boris Vorontsov\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO-Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url] by fLokii\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286]Skyrim Redone[/url] by T3nd0\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8655]Static Mesh Improvement[/url] by Brumbek\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23600] Player Headtracking[/url] by Maegfaer\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19841]LIAT[/url] by Demidekidasu\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]DIMONIZED UNP female body[/url] by dimon99\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722]The Eyes Of Beauty[/url] by Gabriel Mailhot\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url] by Apachii\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19733]Immersive Armors[/url] by hothtropper44\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19281]Requiem[/url] by Xarrian\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32986]Mature skin texture and body for UNP[/url] by Maevan2\r\nTera Armors - various packages, search for them!\r\nNumerous others!\r\n\r\nConsider trying my other mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29451]Breezehome Rustic Basement Workshop[/url] should you be in the market for a more modest and rustic type basement lair.",
