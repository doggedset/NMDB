  "descriptionHtml": "Enchanted Ancient Armor Crafting Tools is a crafting set i made for my self to cheat the crap out the crafting and alchemy system without using console commands :D.\r<br />I used the ancient draugr set to fool myself into roleplaying and justifying this very overpowered crafting set.\r<br />It is actually useful if you&#39;re using it for anything other than you&#39;re normal gaming or if you don&#39;t mind a little cheating and making you&#39;re self more powerful armors and weapons.\r<br />\r<br />For whatever reasons anyone can think of i hope you enjoy it.
