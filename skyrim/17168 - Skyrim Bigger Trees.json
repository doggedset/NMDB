  "descriptionHtml": "Ever looked at the trees in skyrim... they&#39;re so small (especially near Riften).\r<br />\r<br />If you agree with me\r<br />[color=#38761d][size=5][b]THEN THIS IS THE MOD FOR YOU&#33;&#33;&#33;[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=#ff0000][size=5]READ BEFORE YOU GO FORWARD:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- If you have any questions or problems, [color=#ff0000]read the FAQ down below first[/color], before contacting me (Jonigts).\r<br />([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/561097/?]Jonigts[/url]).\r<br />- Xweto quit modding for a while, so I (Jonigts) got permission from him to continue the development of this mod. \r<br />- Xweto did a really great job. He resized a lot of trees, but some of them were too big (specially with SFO), and he didn´t care much about compatibility with other mods, overlapping trees and covered roads. \r<br />- My main goal now is to fix everything to make this mod work just fine (and also work together with as mods as possible).\r<br />- TI changed the version numbers, for example from 11.4 to 1.4[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]Version 1.65 is up.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- The BSA version is not working properly and I dont know why. Anybody? (I know, without Mod Organizer, etc.. have to be the same name as the ESP, but still not working).\r<br />- Merged the ESP for the Bigger- and Smaller Full tamriel versions.\r<br />- I made new LOD-s for SFO, but also left the ones from the Treefix mod (by Laacis2) for those, who prefer that.\r<br />- Few tree fixes\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]Version 1.6 is up. The Bigger Version is revisited in every area, see for yourself.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Everybody (~200 people), who already downloaded the 1.6, please re-download it, since I forget a mesh folder from the &#34;SkyrimBT Lite&#34; folder. There for SBT lite (without riften) doesn&#39;t have correct LOD-s. Sorry for that, and download it again, it has been corrected (thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4891508]kopasov[/url] for mentioning this for me).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#38761d][size=5]You can see the changes of the mod here [size=3](also If you know any bug, please report it here)):[/size][/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17168/?tab=4&&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fcomments%2F%3Fmod_id%3D17168%26page%3D1%26sort%3DDESC%26pid%3D0%26thread_id%3D2227064&pUp=1][size=5]Bug Tracker[/size]\r<br />[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#38761d][size=6]Description:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]This Mod changes the size of the trees for a more Fantasy Forest (but still realistic) like feeling for Skyrim.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />There are Two different version: The original with huge trees, and one with smaller trees (but still taller than Vanilla).\r<br />This mod edits a lot of Trees, so some of them are made bigger, especially in bigger forests with smaller trees on the edges of the forests.\r<br />A Lot of trees haven&#39;t even been touched, since there are also size variations in real life.\r<br />A Lot of trees around roads have been downsized ,because the branches covered up the hole road and the player couldn&#39;t see anything at all.\r<br />\r<br />There is another great Mod which makes Trees bigger  ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56877/?]Skysight - Simply Bigger Trees[/url] by [b]fadingsignal[/b]), but that mod is working in a different way than ours. Skysight just edited the Tree recources (several tree files), so it enlarges each tree equally, there for it lacks variation.\r<br />\r<br />Our mod, [color=#6d9eeb]Skyrim Bigger Trees[/color] only enhances trees is specific areas (especially in big forests) by editing every tree in Tamriel seperatly, ranging from 0.7x to 6x it&#39;s original size. Yes, this mod even makes some trees smaller, for more diversity. We try to make Skyrim more realistic and more awesome this way.\r<br />\r<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />[color=#38761d][size=6]Latest changes:[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]((You can find the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17168/?tab=12&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodchangelog%2F%3Fid%3D17168%26v%3D&pUp=1]changelog on the Changes[/url] tab)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#93c47d][size=4][b]Version 1.6[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />I reverted back to loose files.

If you have any mod that modifies the world of Tamriel (adds buildings, etc..) load that mod AFTER Skyrim Bigger Trees.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Does it require a clean save?&#34;\r<br />No, i should work with any save, since this mod doesn&#39;t use any Script at all and it is dirty edits free.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Will this lower my fps?&#34;\r<br />Yes, especially the Bigger version. This can range from -2 to -10 or more FPS depending on your system, graphical settings (UGrids, Shadow quality, etc.) and which other mods you&#39;re using.\r<br />If you get a big performance drop with the bigger version, try the smaller version, and/or lower your graphical settings, like shadow quality.\r<br />If you get a big performance drop every time in a specific location, let us know, and we&#39;ll solve it.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;What can I do If I get CTD&#39;s?&#34;\r<br />If you have a low-end PC, lower your graphics settings, because you&#39;ve most likely run out of memory. If you have a high-end PC, it can be a mod incompatibility or a bug. Try to find which mods cause the ctd&#39;s, notify us and we&#39;ll fix it. \r<br />If it happens in a specific location, also tell us where, and we&#39;ll solve that.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Does this mod work with other mods?&#34;\r<br />Yes, it should work with any mod without problems, as long as it doesn&#39;t change the Tree LOD meshes. If you find overlappings, please contact me.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Georgia][color=#38761d][size=6]Team[/size][/color][/font]\r<br />\r<br />Xweto - Creator of this mod, fixes, changes, compatibilities, layout.\r<br />Jonigts - fixes, changes, compatibilities with other mods, layout, LOD, cleaning\r<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />[font=Georgia][color=#38761d][size=6]Credits[/size][/color][/font]\r<br />\r<br />- Everyone who has provided critiques and suggestions.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7046031/?][b]Laacis2 [/b][/url]for the SFO LOD textures\r<br />- okal for the NMM installer\r<br />- Bethesda, Creation Kit.\r<br />- ElminsterAU, Hlp, Zilav and Sharlikran for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/?]TES5Edit[/url]\r<br />- Ethatron for BSAopt [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/247/?]BSAopt[/url]\r<br />- Photoshop\r<br />- 7z\r<br />- Nexus\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Saiotv and InsanOflex for reviewing this mod&#33;&#33;",
