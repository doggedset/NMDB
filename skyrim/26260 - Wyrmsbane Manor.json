  "descriptionHtml": "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWyrmsbane Manor (0.9b) - By Hypno88\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTES Forum thread: http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1420166-relz-wyrmsbane-manor/\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMod Description:\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhen you complete the civil war questline, the \\\"powers that be\\\" decide to honour the \r\nrole you played by presenting you with the newly created title: Viscount\r\n\r\nAs well as the benefits your new legal status brings (explained below), the reward\r\nincludes the deed to a medium sized, upper-class Manor. The grounds also include a \r\nStable and a Guardhouse/Blacksmith enclosed by a high wall.\r\n\r\nLike most things in life, theres always a catch. Due to a long term of neglect, the \r\nManor is in a sorry state. You will need to invest a tidy sum of gold to bring it \r\nback to its former glory\r\n\r\nFull List of Upgrades (total 25000g):\r\n- LivingRoom (2000g)\r\n- Bedrooms (3000g)\r\n- Dininghall (2000g)\r\n- Kitchen + Basement (3000g)\r\n- Armory (3500g)\r\n- Laboratory + Alchemy Garden (3500g)\r\n- Banners (1000g)\r\n- Hidden Vault (1000g)\r\n- Maid or Butler (1000g)\r\n- Guards + Captain/Blacksmith (5000g)\r\n\r\n\r\nViscount status?:\r\n\r\nThis new title can be loosely be described as \\\"Thane of All Skyrim\\\". In the political \r\nhierarchy, you could say it falls somewhere above \\\"Thane\\\", but still below a \\\"Jarl\\\".\r\n\r\nIn actual gameplay terms, what it does is give you the status of a thane in all the \r\nnine holds. At the same time, it is totally seperate from the vanilla system so you \r\ncan be both Viscount and Thane of Whiterun at the same time, for example. \r\n\r\nThere is one key difference to reflect the elivated position of the title, the guards \r\nwill treat you with a \\\"three strike system\\\". You can sweet talk your way out of trouble \r\neasily the first two times you are caught commiting a crime. But the third time, the \r\nguards will explain that they are fed up with you taking advantage of their hospitality \r\nand treat you like a normal citizen again. There are seperate trackers for each hold, \r\nso if you lose the privelage in one hold, it won\\'t affect the other eight.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything else?:\r\n\r\nTo round off the mod I have retextured a vanilla set of Heavy Armour, Light Armour, \r\nRobes and Clothes Outfit in the colours of your new family crest. The armours are made \r\nby your Guard-Captain/Blacksmith, and the cloth items by your Maid or Butler\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what if I don\\'t want to do the Civil War?\r\n\r\nThen do what they did in the medieval times...buy the title. In the Winking Skeever in\r\nSolitude, you\\'ll find an imperial named Brutus Rex. At 20,000 gold it isn\\'t cheap!\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nInstalling\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nunzip the 7z archive, then drag the data folder into your \\\"skyrim\\\" folder. A window will \r\npop up, just merge all folders. Then enable it in your load order. \r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUnistalling\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRemove any items from the containers in the house. Leave any mod related items (clothes, \r\nArmour, ring, keys, letter) behind. Go to the other end of the map, wait for a few days, \r\nthen make a new save. Exit the game, then disable the mod from your load order. Go to your \r\ndata folder and delete the wyrmsbane folders from \\\"data/textures\\\" and \\\"data/sound/voice\\\", \r\ndelete wyrmsbanemanor.seq from the data/Seq folder, in the scripts folder, sort by date \r\nthen delete all the pex made on the 30th oct (do the same in the data/scripts/source), \r\nthen finally delete WyrmsbaneManor.esp from the data folder. Start the game and load the \r\nsave, then make a new save. Continue playing with this save\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPlaying the mod\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhen you load the mod, nothing will happen until you complete the civil war questline \r\n(unless you pay a visit to Brutus Rex). After completing it, once you \\\"change location\\\"\r\na couple times, the vanilla courier will track you down and present you with a \r\nProclamation. \r\n\r\nIf you load this mod into a save that has already completed the civil war, then it \r\n\\\"should\\\" kick in right away\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIf the courier doesn\\'t come after you \\\"wait\\\" for a few days after paying Brutus, then it\r\nmeans the engine missed its que. You can confirm this by opening the colsole, and typing\r\n\\\"getstage hwe00\\\". If it returns 0 it means you havn\\'t payed brutus, 100 means you\\'ve payed\r\nand its waiting for its que to send the courier. If you then type \\\"setstage hwe00 200\\\" \r\nthat should get the ball rolling again.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAside from the brutus problem, I have not seen any other errors on my end. \r\n\r\nThe \\\"b\\\" in the version number stands for \\\"beta\\\". It means if you run into a problem, \r\nplease let me know so i can try and get it fixed as soon as possible\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCheats\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIf you just want to just have the house fully furnashed then here\\'s what you do:\r\n\r\n1. In the console, type \\\"Setstage HWE00 200\\\" (skip this step if you are further then \r\n   the first mission in the civil war)\r\n2. Walk through a door\r\n3. In the console, type \\\"Getstage HWE01\\\", and as long as it returns 0 or above then you \r\n   know the change location event fired and the quest is running\r\n4. In the console, type \\\"Setstage HWE01 900\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to add one of the outfit sets, type \\\"player.additem ??? 1\\\" into the console,\r\nreplacing the \\\"???\\\" with the following codes:\r\n\r\nxx01DEE3 - clothes\r\nxx01DEE2 - Robes\r\nxx01A8D1 - Light Armour\r\nxx018DB9 - Heavy Armour\r\n\r\nthe xx needs replacing, and what it is depends on where wyrmsbanemanor.esp is in your\r\nload order \r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCredits\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThanks to Bethesda for all their games, giving us the devkits and eventually squashing \r\nall the big bugs\r\n\r\nThanks to everybody in the Official Bethesda Forums, Creation Kit section\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod has been cleaned with Tes5Edit 3.0.23EXP",
