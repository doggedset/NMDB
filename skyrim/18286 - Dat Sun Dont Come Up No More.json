  "summary": "A small mod removing the daytime from skyrim for Vampire players. \r\n\r\nFor KvatchHero ",
  "descriptionHtml": "A quick mod changing the skyrim climate so the sun never comes up. I made this by a request for KvatchHero. \r\n\r\nThere shouldn\\'t be any bugs since one little thing was changed but ho knows, stuff happens. Let me know about them and I will see what I can do. \r\n\r\nAs for Compatibility as long as the mod doesn\\'t mess with the when the sunset/sunrise begins/ends there should be no problems with them running together.\r\n\r\n Have fun Vampires, cuz the Sun dont come up no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am currently working a much larger mod. The forum for it is [url=\\\"http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/692831-the-rise-of-death-wip/page__p__5488862#entry5488862\\\"]Here[/url]",
