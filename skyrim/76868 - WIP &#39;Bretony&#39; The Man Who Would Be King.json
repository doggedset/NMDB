  "descriptionHtml": "Drag and drop into your Skyrim/Data file and make sure to select it in your Mod-manager/Skyrim launcher.\r<br />\r<br />This adds a new area and eventually a new Civil War option to Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Travel to Daggerfall in this (hopefully) Expansion-pack sized mod that will allow you to take on new quests and slightly different enemies&#33;\r<br />Lucius Arturius Castus, an Imperial-born Breton, has begun a campaign to unite Skyrim and the Reach-lands. As the Pen-y-Draig the Reachmen have reverence for his powers. The Reachmen owned Skyrim before the Nords and as such they feel they have a right to put one of their own on the throne of High-King. This mod will allow you to join the Pendragon forces of Arturius and Myrddin to take Skyrim from the Stormcloaks and Imperials to create a lasting rule of even temperament and stop the chaos Alduin and his dragons have brought.\r<br />\r<br />[You can travel to Bretony by using a special cart in the Pendragon camp just outside of Markarth Stables. Or by using &#34;COC BretonyGate&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />(I&#39;ve only uploaded a texture mod on here before, let me know if there are any problems and I&#39;ll see if I can fix them.)",
