  "descriptionHtml": "[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/hXQSy.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />Enemies will fight you in shallow water and will pursue you across water. Followers will fight in shallow water and will pursue enemies across the water in combat. What makes this mod different from others is that there are no compatibility issues. The mod is scripted and will scan all playable races and apply the needed changes to each one whilst leaving everything else alone. Since it scans all the playable races currently available it should work on custom races also. It only applies the script once per game load so will cause no performance loss at all. It does require SKSE however but who doesn&#39;t use SKSE these days when there are essential mods such as SkyUI?\r<br />\r<br />Made on request. This mod will stop NPCs from avoiding water and they will chase through water and will also combat in shallow water.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i61.tinypic.com/317jkad.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Video:\r<br />[youtube]DR5EAhdU3Y0[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />SKSE is required. You can download it here: http://skse.silverlock.org/\r<br />\r<br />Installation: drag and drop the data folder in the zip file to:\r<br />C:Program Files (x86)SteamSteamAppscommonskyrim\r<br />and then allow it to copy the files into the existing folder or use Nexus Mod Manager (NMM)\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />Now fully compatible with all mods.",
