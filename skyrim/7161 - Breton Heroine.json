  "descriptionHtml": "I have found it difficult to create a nice-looking Breton with Bethesda\\'s character-creation tools, but this one came out pretty well.\r\n\r\nI chose to provide a level-one game save just after the character has exited the cavern after Helgen Keep.\r\n\r\nYou probably are familiar with using the console command \\\"showracemenu\\\" to change an avatar\\'s name--in this case, \\\"Eowyn\\\"--or hairstyle or anything else you don\\'t like, but \\\"showracemenu\\\" resets your avatar\\'s perks, so (as you are probably aware) it isn\\'t a good idea to use \\\"showracemenu\\\" with upper-level characters. \r\n\r\nBut using \\\"showracemenu\\\" with a level-one character that has no perks to begin with makes no difference.\r\n\r\nThis character looks perfectly okay with vanilla Skyrim, but even better with Xenius\\'s \\\"No More Blocky Faces\\\" mod.",
