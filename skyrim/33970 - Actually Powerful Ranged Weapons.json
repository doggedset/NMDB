  "summary": "Changes Projectile damages for more realism and a bit of a challenge. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod (three versions) tweaks the projectile damage. I felt they were too weak and people still looked like pin cushions. The damages work along the lines of one hit kill at novice. The normal version only affects Arrows whilst the dawnguard version only affects crossbow bolts, they work together fine and as such for a full experience both would be used if you have dawnguard.\r\n\r\nWarning; everyone elses arrows are powerful too so getting hit causes death...a lot. \r\n\r\nThere is now a small version I made since started playing again, simply put this is a middle ground so that there is less in the way of what I feel still pincushioning, I may be able to blame some of the mods I have for the feeling of everyone being overpowered...these do all work best on master is more my point though...else everyone dies immediately...This mod works great and 0 incompatibility with things like Warzones which is a great mod you should check out.
