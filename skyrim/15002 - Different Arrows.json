  "modName": "Different Arrows",
  "summary": "This is a simple mod which makes different arrow types fly at defferent speed and drop differently while flying. It also slightly changes damage values for arrows.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to my first mod.\r\nI have seen and tried several mods which altered arrow speed in the game, but I was always missing something about it. And then I realized what. Not all arrows would act the same in real life.\r\nSo I downloaded Creation kit and made my very first mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][b][size=4]EDIT:\r\nI found out, that bows ARE DIFFERENT too. Even though the speed of all arrows is originally still the same, better bow \\\"drops\\\" less, better bow also takes longer to fully draw.\r\nStill, \\\"problem\\\" with all the same arrow behavior persists. (My mod isn\\'t useless :D) So when you shoot different type of arrow from the SAME bow, originaly they fly all the same. This is what this mod changes.\r\n\r\nOn one of the pics, you can see two lines of arrows, left, using Daedric Bow, right using Long Bow, shot aiming to the same place.\r\n\r\nThat made me to completely rework the mod, I added a bit more of gravity to arrows, so now you need to aim really high to hit Bannered Mare from Adrianne\\'s forge with Falmer Arrow using Long Bow.[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#4455FF][b][size=6]What This mod changes:[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n- adjusts trajectory and travel speed of arrows listed bellow (values differes according to \\\"race\\\" they come from, or material they are made of - for example Elven Arrow flies faster and drops less than Orcish Arrow) - see the pic with text to get the idea. All arrows were shot to Bannered Mare from Adrianne\\'s forge in Whiterun, aiming at the same point, using Daedric Bow.\r\n\r\n- on pic you can se Dragon Bone Arrow from \\\"Dragon Bone Weapons Complete\\\" mod by ktacreations. Full mod here, load my file after this to make it work properly:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14701\r\n\r\n- I forgot to shot steel arrow, but according to first pic, it should be a bit above Ebony Arrow \r\n\r\n- also slightly alters damage for some of them - strange was, that Ancient Nord - very old arrow, could deal more damage than simple, but new, sharp Iron Arrow. These changes are now part of the idea, so I\\'m not planning to relase version without it, but if there is many of you who wish me to do so, I will, just let me now.\r\n\r\n- all arrows has increased range, so there should be no more lost arrows :)\r\n\r\nThese arrows are currently adjusted (Also mentioning damage):\r\n- Falmer Arrow - 7\r\n- Forsworn Arrow - 7\r\n- Ancient Nord Arrow - 10\r\n- Iron  Arrow - 12\r\n- Steel Arrow - 14\r\n- Orcish Arrow - 14\r\n- Dwarven Arrow - 15\r\n- Elven Arrow - 16\r\n- Glass Arrow - 18\r\n- Nord Hero Arrow - 22\r\n- Ebony Arrow - 20\r\n- Daedric Arrow - 24\r\n- Dragon Bone Arrow - 22\r\n- Bound Arrow - 22 - its kinda magic, so its the fastest arrow, and drops least :)\r\n\r\n[color=#4455FF][b][size=6]What This mod doesn\\'t change:[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n- so far any other arrow except ones listed above, no magic projectiles or anything else\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4455FF][b][size=6]To do:[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n- don\\'t have any idea right now\r\n\r\n[color=#4455FF][b][size=6]Instalation:[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n- it is just one file, so extract it to your /Data directory.\r\n- or use NMM :)\r\n\r\n[color=#4455FF][b][size=6]Known bugs:[/size][/b][/color]\r\n- not all arrows fly exactly where crosshair aims, some of them higher, some of them lower. This is because different speed of bows and arrows, and cannot be adjusted to be same for all.\r\n\r\n- surely colides with other mods which changes arrows (Faster Arrows, Better Arrows, Arrows Tweaks, Slow Arrows, etc...)\r\n\r\n[color=#4455FF][b][size=6]Credits:[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\nThis is my own mod made from scratch, but I got inspired by: \r\n\r\nFaster Arrows by FordPerfec\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1009\r\n\r\nAnd any other mod which changes arrows in Skyrim :)\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][b][size=4]Any comments, bugs or suggestions (or possible endorsements :)) posted here are most welcome, since this is my first mod and I don\\'t have much experience with modding.[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#4455FF][b][size=12]ENJOY! :)[/size][/b][/color]",
