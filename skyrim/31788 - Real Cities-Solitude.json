  "descriptionHtml": "[heading] CURRENT UPDATE [/heading]\r\nFixes:\r\n- Floating wood\r\n- Grey-face bug\r\n- Some of the houses\r\nAdds\r\n- Some interiors and new NPC\\'s in the Solitude Exterior\r\n- New Merchant in the Solitude exterior\r\n- Steps to some of the houses\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n  [heading] DESCRIPTION [/heading]\r\nThis mod turns Solitude into the city it should have been, a worthy capital of Skyrim. For being the capital, it\\'s pretty small. It has seven houses. For a city. This mod changes that. It add a bunch of new houses and building to fill up the city. It also adds houses outside the city walls, for the people who cannot afford the luxury of the walls to protect them. New NPC\\'s has been added and more are to come. The houses can not be entered. They are there to add to the atmosphere.\r\nI will not be adding anything to the docks because I feel there are mods that do it much better than what I would do.\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n                       [heading] HIGHLY RECOMMENDED MODS [/heading]\r\nRepopulated Skyrim http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=10050\r\nSolitude Docks District http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22821\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n                             [heading] FUTURE UPDATES [/heading]\r\nCouple things I would like to clear up:\r\n-This does not conflict with the civil war quest line, I placed the houses around the catapults.\r\n-I am also working on adding new NPC\\'s and some stalls and shops around, as well as adding ambient sounds.\r\n-I am also working on other cities. I am almost done with Morthal. I added more things but did not take away the general feeling of an old spooky town.\r\n-And thanks to everyone who downloaded and endorsed!\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n[heading] OTHER REAL CITIES [/heading]\r\nReal Cities-Whiterun http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30594\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n[heading] VIDEOS [/heading]\r\n[youtube]PNVM-h2eSUo[/youtube]\r\n[youtube]v2RDsiBOfoY[/youtube]\r\n[youtube]1jkbeGye5iw[/youtube]\r\n[heading] SPANISH MOD REVIEW [/heading]\r\n[youtube]kXoVeTe-mns[/youtube]",
