  "summary": "This mod adds seven new flame spells all based on new colors&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "Blood Flames (red) deals a strong and long DoT. \r<br />\r<br />Magicka Flames (blue) abosorbs magicka. \r<br />\r<br />Stamina Flames (green) absorb stamina. \r<br />\r<br />Holy Flames (yellow) deal high damage to undead. \r<br />\r<br />Soul Flames (purple) abosorb health and cast a soul trap effect. \r<br />\r<br />Death Flames (black) burn the enemy and have a chance to insta kill. \r<br />\r<br />Life Flames (white) are just a fancy way to heal. \r<br />\r<br />Obviously the missing color, orange, is the default flames so yeah. \r<br />\r<br />There are rumors that Farengar has stolen the secret of my spells... I suggest looking through his stuff to find the spell tomes. \r<br />\r<br />(If you have my previous mod, Soul Flames, I suggest ditching it before getting this.) \r<br />\r<br />Update 1: Holy Flames now deals 30 damage a second and costs more mana so now it may be useful and Blood Flames no longer affects undead because physically it makes no sense. No blood to boil, right?",
