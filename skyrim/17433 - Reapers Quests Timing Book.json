  "descriptionHtml": "Mod Name: Reaper\\'s Quests Timing Book\r\nBy: Reaper9111\r\nVersion: 2\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis mod simply add to Riverwood\\'s Inn a Book that explain the best Quests Timing in Skyrim.\r\nI did this because i wanted to have a quick access to those information in game, if you are like me, then you like to get the maximum of everything... That\\'s why i did this !\r\nYou can find the book on a table in Riverwood\\'s Inn.\r\nThe book\\'s information were taken from the Wiki. (so don\\'t be piss at me, if something ain\\'t right !)\r\nHere: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Quest_Timing\r\nQuote from \\\"kevkas\\\"\r\n[QUESTS TIMING = quest timing refers to the best way to get the most out of quests (good perks, benefits, game-lore development of events, etc). In this case, if you follow the wiki link in the description, you see that named quests (which in theory should be more important than miscellaneous quests) were divided in different categories:\r\n - Quests to Do Immediately \r\n- Quests to Do As Soon As Possible \r\n- Quests to Save for Later \r\n- Quests to Start but not Finish \r\n- Quests that Conflict \r\nSo if you\\'ve ever done a quest that you later found out (through a wiki, or even in-game) had conflicts with other quest, or that made the story of the game redundant, or maybe you got a benefit (like a temporary buff) which would have been a permanent buff (like an awarded perk) if you had done another quest before... then for those cases quest timing should help. Basicaly it\\'s a guide to what quests you should/could do first, and which ones should follow.]\r\n\r\nNews\r\n=====\r\nReuploaded, this is now v2 (the issue with the book mesh is now fix) I\\'m sorry !\r\n\r\nRequired mods\r\n=============\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\nInstall using Nexus Mod Manager (NMM)\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n1.
