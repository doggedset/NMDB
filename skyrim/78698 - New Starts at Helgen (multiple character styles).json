  "modName": "New Starts at Helgen (multiple character styles)",
  "summary": "These save files generally have the new player starting out at an intact Helgen. This is a work-in-progress, I intend to compile different starting characters with the same basic set-ups but tweaked individually. The storyline is cut up until A Blade in the Dark, thus skipping the whole Whiterun/Hrothgar malarkey.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The games have been saved with no mods in place, however the original starting sequence is completely cut. It should be absolutely compatible across all versions and mods, although largely untested overall. In any case, the latest patch is applied although it should work fine without it.\r<br />\r<br />This is a work-in-progress, I will look into several different starting options and will likely upload individual files as and when - hopefully I will eventually be able to have a good set of near-perfect starts, but at present there will probably be bugs and other inconsistencies which require attention. As such, please regard this as more of a demonstration at the moment, at least until I manage to sort out a few things. The layout of this page, as well as the mod title, will also change over time as it develops. So this is basically a test set-up, in fact I&#39;d never uploaded anything here before this so I&#39;m still learning. I&#39;m also not immensely educated on the Skyrim world, I&#39;ve played it a lot by all means but not so much at the outer-limits - which doesn&#39;t matter anyway since these saves are for a new character so the central parts are most relevant. Please use the mod&#39;s forum if you wish to offer recommendations or make any requests, I&#39;m more than happy to hear some feedback.\r<br />\r<br />A quick note... I&#39;ve noticed that the bandit save is particularly popular. I now have all the files in a good state and may not need to update them much now, bar any unforeseen problems of course. The bandit is something I can expand on, if I spend more time on it then maybe I&#39;ll eventually upload it as a separate mod to the rest.\r<br />\r<br />Follows the basic notes on the set-up...\r<br />\r<br />The character is a female Nord, she basically looks almost identical to Lydia. Like sisters. A batch file was applied which forcibly completed the first bunch of storyline quests. The current quest is [i]A Blade in the Dark[/i], ready to move on to the dragon. Other than the above, no quests have been taken (the only other exceptions may be the Imperial/Stormcloak auto-quests). No kills, no looting, nothing. The player is at level one with 1,000 credits. Default skills and attributes, slightly tweaked in places accordingly.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Nord[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Full set of Ancient Nordic Heavy Armour\r<br />[*]Banded Iron Shield of Blocking (20%)\r<br />[*]Nord Hero Greatsword\r<br />[*]Nord Hero Bow\r<br />[*]100 Nord Hero Arrows\r<br />[*]100 Ancient Nord Arrows\r<br />[*]Ancient Nord Amulet\r<br />[*]Notched Pickaxe\r<br />[*]Poacher&#39;s Axe\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[u]Bandit[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Same basic set-up as the above, except for...\r<br />[*]Full set of Iron Armour with buffs\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Helgen is populated with bandits, inside and out.\r<br />[*]Has two followers (one normal, the other is in the animal slot).\r<br />[*]Hold bounties all set to 100,000, set to hostile too but this resets.\r<br />[*]The storyline will obviously be rather broken, can&#39;t be a bandit else.\r<br />[*]I intend to work on this, maybe putting bandits in other locations.\r<br />[*]Note: if you go to Dragonsreach and get attacked, Lydia will go nuts.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Recommended mod alongside this: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31264]Organised Bandits in Skyrim (OBIS)[/url]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]If you want rid of the secondary follower and have problems: open the console and enter &#34;EmptyRefAlias animal&#34; (or instead of &#34;animal&#34;, &#34;follower&#34; if you need to). Also, you can select any NPC and enter &#34;ForceRefIntoAlias animal&#34; (or again, &#34;follower&#34;) which may cause them to follow you (does not specifically allow dialogue with them or affect their relations, and you can only have one of each without mods).\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[u]Forsworn Mage\r<br />\r<br />[/u][list]\r<br />[*]Armour of the Old Gods\r<br />[*]Spellbreaker Shield\r<br />[*]Briarheart Geis\r<br />[*]Forsword Staff x2\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Skills set for being a mage, not for weapons\r<br />[*]A few additional low-level spells\r<br />[*]Forsworn faction is friendly\r<br />[/list][u]\r<br />Wolf[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Permanently deals an extra 15 damage to animals\r<br />[*]Targe of the Blooded (shield, bash does bleeding)\r<br />[*]Bow of the Hunt (+20 to animals)\r<br />[*]Axe of Whiterun (+5 Burning)\r<br />[*]Full set of Wolf Heavy Armour\r<br />[*]Custom ring for muffling\r<br />[*]Kyne&#39;s Token\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]The player has a wolf companion.

She can definitely be targeted at the console with the usual A2C94 identification. It&#39;s worth pointing out that because she has already been created, her stats are set now - therefore I have improved them somewhat.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]For the Nord and Forsworn files, Helgen Keep is populated with bandits. It may not be wise to head right in because they are quite tough&#33; I intend to apply this to the wolf one as well, and the bandit one also has them currently but they&#39;re obviously friendly.\r<br />[/list]",
