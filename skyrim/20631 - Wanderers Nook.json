  "descriptionHtml": "***** UPDATE 01/06/2014 *****\r<br />A recent comment posted on this mod prompted me to log in to let people know that I am no longer supporting this mod. Anyone who wishes to change/update this mod is welcome to do so, my only request is that I be given credit as original author if the mod is uploaded elsewhere :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Wanderer&#39;s Nook is a 6 room player home located in the northeastern exterior battlement wall of Windhelm.  This mod is suited to the solo player, however is fully navmeshed to be spouse/companion friendly and includes a map marker for fast travel.\r<br />The home is comprised of a kitchen with food storage and cooking facilities, an alchemy and enchanting room, blacksmithing room, study/library, bedroom and finally, a spa/sauna for the travel weary adventurer.\r<br />All containers are safe for storage.\r<br />\r<br />Wanderer&#39;s Nook also contains the following:\r<br />- 8 mannequins\r<br />- 6 large weapon display cases\r<br />- 5 small weapon display cases\r<br />- 4 shield plaques\r<br />- 3 weapon plaques\r<br />- 17 weapon racks\r<br />- 6 bookshelves\r<br />- 10 shrines (including Nocturnal)\r<br />- 13 standing stones\r<br />\r<br />Please note - This mod contains mostly static items (ie cannot be picked up) as it was made to please my own aesthetics, rather than be filled with lots of &#34;free stuff&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Wanderer&#39;s Nook uses multiple new meshes/textures created by many talented modders which I have included in the download file.

I have used Radiant and Unique Potions Poisons and BOOZE v2 GLOWING VERSION. \r<br />\r<br />Known bugs/issues\r<br />None that I know of, however other mods located in the exact same place may well cause conflicts with this mod.\r<br />  \r<br />BUG UPDATE 18/07/12 1.

Uploaded 2 new files, Painting frame patch file (this includes the missing frame textures if you downloaded v1.0), and the second is Wanderer&#39;s Nook v2 which is the latest whole file downloaded including the missing textures - the patch file is NOT required with v2 \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation\r<br />The easiest option is to just download with Nexus Mod Manager http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/modmanager/\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to rickyrickylo for creating the following video of this mod [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7DqwP49ijM] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7DqwP49ijM[/url]",
