  "modName": "Slave Pit",
  "summary": "Have you ever felt like throwing people who steal your sweet rolls to the lions. Are you tired of your dancing girls not dancing for you. Or Perhaps you just want some Imperial style fun.  This mods adds a arena close to riverwood( I will be working on changing the location to somewhere more unique)",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is my first attempt at creating a house mod. The entrance should be visible from riverwood .  The living quarters and arena are designed to be beneath the mountains.   If you are looking for a house you will never find it because there is no actual house.  Across the river there should be  a door in a half moon shapped entrance.  once entered It contains two levels. The first level has a huge pool, a master bedroom, alchemy tables, forges and all other things necessary to be self sufficient. The second level contains 5 arenas. Each arena contains a different predator. Chaurus, wolves, spiders, bears, and sabretooths that should respawn. Each arena contains a throne which is high above the arena. It also contains a cage with a trapdoor for your dancing girl to dance. If she refuses to dance you can release the trap door and she will fall through into a pool . When she gets out the beasts should attack her. It is also how you would get slaves into the pit. Be careful not to fall into the pit because if you were not killed by the fall there is no way out. This was done purposely. I would suggest having mods such as amazing character Tweaks, paradise halls or other mods that allow you to capture npcs and control them.  If you use loverslab this would make the mod even more interesting as some of the mods there were an inspiration for me to create this. This mod so far does not require any other mod to work. I myself am annoyed when modders make mods where I have to download 15  hair mods in order to get the mod to work properly so I strive to create mods that contain all necessary files. Keep in mind that my mods are made on an alienware with an i7 processor and with 2 gb video ram. The room in the mod are quite huge so if you have a wimpy computer it might not be able to handle it. You should be able to simply download the mod to your nexus mod manager and install it there. I do not manually install mods for skyrim or minecraft so asking me how to do this is going to waste your time as I will not be able to answer that.  If you like the mod please say so and if you would like to donate I can provide information for that",
