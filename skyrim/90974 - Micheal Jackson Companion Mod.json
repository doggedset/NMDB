  "summary": "Have you ever awakened in a cold sweat late at night, thinking why there isn't a Micheal Jackson Companion Mod? Well I did, until I made this mod. This has all you need, and all you could ever want! I mean, If Micheal Jackson DIDN'T use a Katana and DIDN'T wear shimmering Dwarven Armor, Who Would? DISCLAIMER:This is my first mod.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod introduces a Companion Known as \"Micheal Jackson\" to the game. He can be found In Dragon Bridge at the Inn. He uses a Akaviri Katana (Blades Sword) and Dwarven Armor. I tried my best to make him look like Micheal Jackson, I'm not that good at modding or anything, (My First Mod) so don't expect a fully voiced and acted Follower Like Inigo though. I hope you enjoy it.",
