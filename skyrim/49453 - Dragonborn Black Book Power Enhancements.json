  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r<br />Changes the rewards from the Black Books in Dragonborn to be more worthwhile, changing Powers into Lesser Powers and making the summonable NPC&#39;s better.\r<br />\r<br />This mod comes in two parts: One which changes Powers into Lesser Powers to make them a bit more worthwhile, and one that changes the Black Market & Secret Servant to be much better than they were. There&#39;s also two versions: One that only requires Dragonborn and one that requires Hearthfires as well, which just includes a couple more things in the Dremora Merchant.\r<br />\r<br />NPC&#39;s:\r<br />Black Market - This merchant was given a wide variety of rare hard to find ingredients such as black soul gems, powdered mammoth tusk, charred skeever hide, 20,000 gold instead of 2,000, a wide variety of books, some of my favorite clothes hand picked, some good cooking ingredients, a lot of alcohol, tons of gems, some rare recipes, some enchanted jewelry, potions, poisons, scrolls, daedra hearts, human hearts, a good supply of every kind of ingot, and some other stuff as well. He&#39;ll also buy stolen items. Overall, massive improvement. Available in both a Hearthfires version which includes Butter and Argonian Bloodwine and one that is only dependant on Dragonborn which is missing those two things.\r<br />\r<br />Secret Servant - Carry weight was increased by 10,000. Now rather than having a carry weight limit of 186 or so, his limit is more like 10,186. Yeah. Go crazy. That Butler can hold just about anything you give him now, even 666 dragon bones (and some other stuff&#33;).\r<br />\r<br />Note: These spells are available from Black Book: Untold Legends. Also, if you happen to want both of them and don&#39;t mind cheating then you can just add the spells to yourself via console. Tip: &#34;help black market&#34; &#34;help secret servant&#34; then player.addspell (whatever id it was)\r<br />\r<br />Powers:\r<br />All changed from Powers (once a day use) to Lesser Powers (use as much as you want):\r<br />Mora&#39;s Agony\r<br />Mora&#39;s Boon\r<br />Mora&#39;s Grasp\r<br />Secret of Strength\r<br />Secret of Arcana\r<br />Secret of Protection\r<br />\r<br />Note: Dragon Aspect was not changed as there are already mods that do that, and it is not learned from a Black Book.",
