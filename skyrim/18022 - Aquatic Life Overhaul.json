I will upload the new version on the Nexus tonight. \r\n\r\nUpdate: Update: The Island is a work in progress. I will make a player house and other stuff, and I will decorate the waters with the tropical fish that people have complained (justifiably) don\\'t belong in Skyrim\\'s waters. The island will be based in Elsweyr, so it is lore friendly.\r\nUpdate:  Next update will remove the non climate/lore-friendly tropical fish from the ocean and only keep the norther coldwater fish.  However, those who liked the tropical fish, don\\'t worry.  To counter this, I\\'m going to make a tropical island getaway  located somewhere in...Elsewhere (spelling?)  I\\'m assuming that would be a good lore-friendly place, correct me if I\\'m wrong. But basically it\\'ll just be accessible by a portal or a ship or something and you\\'ll appear on an island in the middle of the ocean where I can put tropical fish and white sandy beaches and palm trees and such.\r\n\r\nUpdate:  Might join Tytanis Ultimate Mod.\r\n\r\nUpdate:  17 different species currently added.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nAdds lots more fish of many varieties to Skyrim.\r\n\r\nLocations Mostly Complete So Far:\r\nSolitude Docks\r\nOcean near Solitude Docks\r\n\r\nTypes of Life so far (all the same model, different sizes):\r\nYoung Shark\r\nShark\r\nGreat White Shark\r\nSandbarshark\r\nAngel Shark\r\nBlue Marlin\r\nHumpback Red Snapper\r\nHumphead Wrasse\r\nJellyfish\r\nGuitarfish\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Sharks use the slaughterfish animations and behavior, which is why they don\\'t move around as realistically as you might like. Please do not complain, as I don\\'t know how or if it\\'s even possible, nor am I interested at the moment, in trying to custom-animate every fish. \r\n\r\nAlso note that the non-hostile fish (the majority of the one\\'s I\\'m adding soon) use the vanilla \\\"salmon\\\" animations/behavior so they don\\'t do much more than swim around stupidly. Eventualy I\\'ll get to adding ingredients linked to these fish so that you can catch them and eat them.\r\n\r\nRunning list of what I have completed for the next update (this will take some time):\r\nSheep Head\r\nKelp Bass\r\nLeopard Shark\r\nSharksucker\r\n\r\nTo come?:\r\nCoral Reef\r\nShrimp\r\nLobsters\r\nDifferent types of crabs\r\nStarfish\r\nMangrove Red Snapper\r\nNorthern Bluefin Tuna\r\nCod\r\nPalette Surgeon\r\nSkipjack Tuna\r\nYellowfin Tuna\r\nYellowtail Clownfish\r\n\r\nMost of these will come quickly because I am converting them from an Oblivion mod. Things such as eels, other sharks, dinosaur sea creatures, squids, etc. will take a much longer time. I will also consider doing an overhaul of a part of Skyrim and convert it to a \\\"tropical\\\" environment where most of these fish will blend in better.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a quick Shark encounter, take a swim in the water by the Solitude Docks ;) .\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s to come? If people endorse, I will know they are interested, and I will continue to add new sea creatures to the waters of Skyrim.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you guys enjoy, please endorse!\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall: Use NMM or merge the data folders and check the .esp file.\r\n\r\n[youtube]Ww2cPPlnjG8[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[youtube]WNeG0W3muW0[/youtube]",
