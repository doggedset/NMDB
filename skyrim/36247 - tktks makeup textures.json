  "descriptionHtml": "Pretty much what it says on the tin.  It\\'s the makeup textures for tktk\\'s pretty face mod.  I like the mod itself, but I noticed that some parts of the face model messed with a few things, like scars, etc, so for the sake of my own mod, I lifted them, since I couldn\\'t find any other face mod that had similar results without the various issues I was having with pretty face, or well, at all.  All credit goes to tktk, by the way.  Here\\'s a link to the original mod\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7887/?tab=2&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D7887&pUp=1\r\n\r\nIt shouldn\\'t cause any problems with well....anything unless you already have a mod that messes with the tint textures, in which case I guess it\\'d just overwrite the one you had.  Also, permissions for this mod falls directly under tktk, who did all of the work on the original mod, since making this took about 30 seconds out of my day, so if you want to reuse, go to the original mod\\'s page and check his permissions.",
