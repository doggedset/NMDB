Starting in Whiterun, they managed to get a cult going, even if it was only three members. However, as the days passed, the visits to the shrine dwindled to the point that the Seers were being starved of what they craved most: Souls. The Shrine is now known as the Abandoned Cellar and the only way to get into it is by acquiring one of the only three keys in existence. Once inside, you&#39;ll be able to take one of their artifacts and carry out what the other three followers could not.[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=3]This  mod adds two staves to the game: [color=#980000]The Everseer[/color] and [color=#980000]The Overseer[/color]. They are both identical and both have the same enchants, however, when using the staves, they both fire differently. One is continuous ([color=#980000]Everseer[/color]) and the other is not ([color=#980000]Overseer[/color]). The three keys mentioned above belong to: Heimskr, Nazeem, and Farengar. You can choose to either kill Heimskr and Nazeem or just pickpocket them for their key. However, if you wish to not partake in those kind of shady actions, just take Farengar&#39;s key, it&#39;s on the desk in his study room. The Abandoned Cellar that the keys belong to is underneath Whiterun&#39;s bridge just as you are walking into the city or trying to leave it. At the beginning of this whole ordeal, the three cultists had fitted the Shrine to also be a home because they had spent much of their time in there. So, this mod also comes with a player home for both vamps and non-vamps. It has:\r<br />[/size][/center]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2]Vampire Coffin[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2]Bedroll[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2]Lots of storage and each are named.

Her name is Elvira and is a perfect snack for the player. If you don&#39;t wish to feed off of her or you just like having Potions of Blood, there is an Altar of Blood. It&#39;s a magical bowl that never empties no matter how many times you bottle up that lovely crimson liquid.\r<br />\r<br />[u]This mod requires:[/u]\r<br />[/size][/center]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2]Skyrim[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2]Dawnguard[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2]Dragonborn[/size][/font]\r<br />[/list][center][/center][center][size=3][u]Credits:[/u][/size][/center]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2]Bethesda[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/7393436/?]Fierydemon30[/url] - He helped me so much with figuring out Creation Kit and Nifskope.
