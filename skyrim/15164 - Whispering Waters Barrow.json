South of Dawnstar, in the icy mountains of the north of Skyrim, adventurers will find a haven in Whispering Waters Barrow, among the waterfalls which flow on the sides of this swallow-hole converted by ancient Nords into a tomb.[/i][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://img805.imageshack.us/img805/4537/38830642.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this! This is my very first mod, so please be indulgent with me, but don\\'t hesitate to criticize to help me to improve myself!\r\n\r\nMy goal was to create a simple player home in a central and convenient location, with aesthetic concerns. It\\'s a house for those who want to live in a Nord tomb and who love waterfalls... The place is very natural, not over-encumbered or over-colored, to keep a realistic atmosphere. Indeed, my second goal was to respect the ambiance of Skyrim, and so I used only Nord and cave architecture (no dwemer pieces or decorations from Sovngard).\r\n\r\nThe house itself, inspired by Ustengrav, has all conveniences in one cell: weapon plaques, mannequins, enchanting and alchemy stations, forge... All the chests are marked to NOT respawn and should be safe. I also add a unique sorter script to a chest in the entrance for adventurers who just want to quickly drop their loot into the 21 chests of the house. You will find some bonuses, like books with temporary boosts of crafting and a powerful weapon the presence of which is explained by the journal of the former resident. Finally, it is very follower friendly because exterior and interior are fully navmeshed.\r\n\r\n[center][url=http://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/skyrim/mods/bordeciel/habitations/tertre_des_eaux_murmurantes.php]Version française disponible ici[/url][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/7942/b2e.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]7 main areas:\r\n[/list] \r\n- Entrance\r\n- Throne/display area\r\n- Bedroom\r\n- Smithing: forge, smelter, workbench, grindstone, tanning rack, wood chopping block.\r\n- Kitchen with a cooking pot\r\n- Alchemy area\r\n- Enchanting area\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Storage:\r\n[/list]\r\n- A main chest in the entrance for quick depository which sorts all you put in into the chests of your home ([b]only vanilla objects[/b]).
