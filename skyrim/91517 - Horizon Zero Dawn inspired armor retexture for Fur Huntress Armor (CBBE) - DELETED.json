  "modName": "Horizon Zero Dawn inspired armor retexture for Fur Huntress Armor (CBBE) - DELETED",
  "summary": "My own retexture based on Aloy's outfit from the game Horizon Zero Dawn for Fur Huntress Armor by killerkeo",
  "descriptionHtml": "I have no modeling or texturing skill, it was all done by using Photoshop, made some changes, then open the armor's nif file in Nikskope to see how it turn out, mistake?, edit it again, reload the nif, rinse and repeat til it looks decent.\n<br />Turn out It wasn't pretty as i expected, so i kept it for my personal use. But since i saw, floating around the internet, many Horizon Zero Dawn mod for Skyrim requests, and non of them are fulfilled, i though it would be nice to share this retexture mod.\n<br />\n<br />The armor in the screenshots is edited using Outfit Studio, I simply remove the \"pant\" part, which mean I also made changes to the armor's model. but your will stay the same. If you want this changes, you can download my optional file and install it through NMM or manually.\n<br />\n<br />Requirement \n<br />- Fur Huntress Armor by killerkeo\n<br />- CBBE body\n<br />\n<br />Installation\n<br />1. install the original armor mod by killerkeo from here first: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31170/\n<br />2. install my retexture through NMM (recommended) or manually extract the file to data folder.\n<br />\n<br />Uninstallation\n<br />- If you install this mod using NMM, it can be easily removed, and your armor will revert to its default textures.\n<br />- If you installed this mod manually, the original textures will be overridden, and you will have to either reinstall the original mod, or manually replace the textures by extracting from original mod.\n<br />\n<br />Compatible with CBBE only! - If you use any other body than CBBE, it won't fit. However the armor can be converted to match your body type through Outfit Studio, if you don't know how, I highly recommend following this guide: https://tesmistel.tumblr.com/post/149567999810/outfit-studio-conversion-guide . This guide successfully help me convert many outfit, from zero experiences. If I have enough time I could make an even more simple guide, maybe I will in near future.\n<br />\n<br />Other mods used in screenshot (only something i thought worth to mention, but please don't hesitate to ask me if you see something you like but not listed)\n<br />- Dragonslayer Bow and Siege Arrows\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59335/\n<br />- Elemental Arrows\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49983\n<br />- ARTA Vindictus Hair\n<br />(It can be downloaded from various skyrim mod sites, i got it from Loverslab, which is a nfsw site, so i can't put a link here)\n<br />- Follower: Healer Onean, Tanker Neisa, Tania the Hermit\n<br />(weapon used by them are from Liliths series by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2407268]wiikki[/url], giant club mod, and vanila staffs\n<br />- Diverse Dragons Collection 3\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83559/\n<br />- tumbajamba's mounts\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57050/\n<br />- Lovergirl race dawnguard 1.0.7\n<br />(again, I got this from Loverslab)",
