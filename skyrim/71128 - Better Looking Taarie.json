  "descriptionHtml": "Being as this is the only Altmer you can marry in the game without mods, I was always disturbed about how butt-ugly and ancient she is.. So I decided to give my attempt at fixing this. The mod is extremely simple, does literally nothing but change her face. No skin texture mods, body mods, ect. were used in the making. Simply just download, activate, and play. If there are requests for a version with her having longer hair, then I will make a second file with said suggestion. This is my first uploaded mod so please be gentle on me&#33;",
