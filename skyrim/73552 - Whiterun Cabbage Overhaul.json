  "descriptionHtml": "Ever think to yourself that there isn&#39;t enough cabbage in your life? That Skyrim would be much better with just a little more cabbage? Neither did I, but a friend of mine did. Thus, this mod was born. This mod adds a uh... small amount of cabbage to Whiterun. Cabbage is powerful so it may take time for Whiterun to load when you enter the city, but be patient and you shall be rewarded.",
