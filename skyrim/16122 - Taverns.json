  "summary": "Subtle changes to many of Skyrim\\'s taverns...",
  "descriptionHtml": "While playing Skyrim I noticed the taverns tended to be a little drab and alike. So I set out on a journey to give them a bit of variation, by changing layouts, adding areas and also putting in some more NPCs to give the taverns less of a desolate look. Navmesh has been reworked for all taverns that I have done which include (From what I remember...): \r\n\r\nSleeping Giant Inn- Riverwood\r\nFrostfruit Inn- Rorikstead\r\nNightgate Inn- Near Windhelm\r\nMoorside Inn- Morthal\r\nDead Man\\'s Drink- Falkreath\r\nVilemyr Inn- Ivarstead\r\nFour Shields Tavern- Dragon Bridge\r\nWindpeak Inn- Dawnstar\r\nThe Frozen Hearth- Winterhold\r\nSilver-Blood Inn- Markarth\r\nOld Hroldan- Somewhere in The Reach\r\nBee and Barb- Riften\r\nCandlehearth Hall- Windhelm\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nVERSION 4\r\n\r\nOnce again spruced up most of the taverns, added paintings like suggested, added a few new rooms to different taverns and changed a couple of layouts. Once again nothing massive but I\\'m sure you already knew that. I think I might\\'ve shut that dog up in Four Shields Inn aswell...\r\n\r\nAs for this brawling issue, I believe it is slightly fixed, I know it is for Cosnach anyway, Uthgerd seems to be stubborn in wanting to brawl once again.\r\n\r\nThanks to Artisanix for the paintings which are scattered around the place :)\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nVERSION 3\r\n\r\nI have done a once-over in most taverns. Added some \\'toilets\\' to some of them (non operational, of course!). \r\n\r\nCandlehearth Hall has been changed a little too. Last but not least  I forgot about poor Old Hroldan so gave it some love and made it look a bit more...well...old.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend having a look at this mod which will fill out the taverns with some NPC travellers :) http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15501\r\n\r\nIf you have any improvements to mind, don\\'t hesitate to give me a shout and I\\'ll see what I can do!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
