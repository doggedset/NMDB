  "descriptionHtml": "I know, I know.  Another house in Riverwood.\r\n\r\nContains alchemy and enchanting workbenches, weapon display case, mannequin and more.\r\nHas a map marker for those that don\\'t want to walk a few steps after fast traveling to Riverwood.\r\nWarning: House is quite dim and cozy.  Comfort levels may reach critical mass.\r\n\r\nThis house is fairly small.  No purchase necessary.  Batteries not included.\r\nLighting may vary per user.\r\nHope everyone enjoys it as much as I do.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nMade everything near the fireplace and a few other things that were causing problems into static objects.  You cannot move them but the physics engine cant move them when you bump into stuff either.\r\n\r\n",
