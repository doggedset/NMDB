  "descriptionHtml": "The original game\\'s \\\"dead thrall\\\" spell only worked on NPCs. This mod adds several spells to extend the range of undead thralls you can have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe RAR file contains 2 Esp files so you can choose which part(s) of this mod to use:\r\n\r\n\r\nIncreased summons ESP: \r\n\r\nRaises max summoning cap at various points of the conjuration perk tree:\r\n- Novice Conjuration: +1 to cap\r\n- Summoner: +2 to cap at each tier level\r\n- Necromancer: +6 to cap \r\n- Atromancer now increases elemental summon duration by five fold\r\n- Final perk \\\"Master of Souls\\\" lifting the cap to 24\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNecromancy spells ESP: \r\n\r\n\r\nContains the following new spells\r\n\r\n\r\n\\\"Awaken Undead\\\" spells \r\n- 3 skill levels (Apprentice, Expert, Master) avaliable which raises undead of increasing power.\r\n- Allows indefinite reanimation of Undead creatures. \r\n- Permanent reanimation of already undead creatures such as Skeletons and Draugrs are simpler than creating a dead thrall. Hence these spells are lower in difficulty and cost than the dead thrall spell.\r\n- No effect on fresh corpses: the spells work on undead corpses (ie skeletons and draugrs) only!\r\n- Ash piles and Dragon Priest remains cannot be raised.\r\n\r\nFor non magic users there is a staff imbued with the \\\"awaken undead\\\" effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\\\"The Nether Ritual\\\" \r\n- The ultimate necromancer\\'s spell\r\n- Reanimates multiple weak to average strength undead in a large area.\r\n- Can be used in undead tombs/dungeons to quickly create an undead army.\r\n- Try with the \\\"zombie apocalypse\\\" mod for some interesting undead vs undead battles! \r\n\r\n\r\n\\\"Animal Necromancy\\\" spell \r\n- Raises animal thralls only, does not work on mammoths: they are too big for indoors.\r\n- Likewise reanimation of animals is also easier as they are more simple minded than humanoids, hence the reduced cost and difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\\\"Enslave Shade\\\" Spell \r\n- Summons Shades which are deadly indoors but is weakened by sunlight and is extremely weak to fire\r\nNB: My original intent was for Shades to be summoned from NPC corpses (which then decay into ash after the spell is cast) but so far I\\'ve been unsuccessful doing this... Maybe a more talented modder will take up this one day. \r\n\r\n\r\n\\\"Call Shadow Priest\\\" spell \r\n- Summons a powerful shade priest armed with multiple spells\r\n- Has the same weaknes as shades\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to obtain the spells\r\n- All spells plus the staff can be obtained from members of the Skyrim Necromancer\\'s Guild. \r\n\t+ Two guild Necromancers have been signted operating in Hamvir\\'s rest. \r\n\t+ The Guildmaster can be found travelling Skyrim, she will also teach you the spells.\r\n- The Riverwood Trader will now only sell the low tier spells.\r\n- The spell tomes will also appear randomly in other magic stores or loot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Install: \r\n1. Unzip \r\n2. Place in Data Folder\r\n3. Enable Mods \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMisc:\r\nI probably won\\'t be further updating this file, please feel free to use all or part of this mod in your own work as long as I am acknowledged in the credits.\r\n",
