  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE: A handful of tomes have been placed in the world to be found!  Spells can be Dual-Cast and Overcharged with the Alteration Dual-Cast perk.\r\n\r\nYou\\'ll have to excuse me for the rather short description I\\'m placing here, this is the first time I\\'ve ever created a file, and it\\'s all new to me! :D\r\n\r\nI got sick and tired of having to waste valuable enchant slots on armor for carry weight when there were so many other awesome enchants out there to use.  Plus, I missed having the Feather-style spells from Oblivion, so I decided to try my luck at making them myself!\r\n\r\nYes, there are other mods out there that do this as well, but I wanted something familiar, so I stuck with the Oblivion naming convention and spell progression.  It is as follows:\r\n\r\nEase Burden - Apprentice - Increases Carry Weight by 50 for 240 seconds.\r\nLighten Load - Adept - Increases Carry Weight by 75 for 300 seconds.\r\nPack Mule - Expert - Increases Carry Weight by 150 for 300 seconds.\r\nBeast of Burden - Master - Increases Carry Weight by 250 for 360 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe spells tomes aren\\'t littered about the world, but they are all currently purchasable from merchants who carry Alteration tomes and are hidden in a FEW places.  The Master version requires you to finish the Alteration Spell Ritual first, then it is available from Tolfdir at the College.\r\n\r\nI will work on improving this mod by adding the spell tome to random loot lists and such, if it gets a decent response.  Heck, I may just do it so that I can learn how. <--DONE!\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\n1. Download and decompress the .rar file to your Skyrim Data folder (usually C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\data for Windows Vista and 7)\r\n2. Make sure the mod is selected in the Launcher or Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n3. ????\r\n4. Profit!\r\n\r\nREMOVAL:\r\n\r\nSimply deselect the .esp file from the launcher or mod manager and then delete it!  Obviously you will no longer have those spells or spell tomes in your game if you do so!\r\n\r\nAny questions, comments, concerns, please hit me up here!",
