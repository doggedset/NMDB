  "descriptionHtml": "This is where I aim to make a collection of patches for ReProccer, a tool for Skyrim Redone.\r\n\r\nThe ReProccer is a fantastic tool. Much kudos to T3nd0 for making it so that any weapon or armour mod can work in SkyRe, nicely re-balanced to match the more brutal combat. However, when playing around with the ReProccer, I noticed some limitations... If you add textures to vanilla items that don\\'t normally have their own textures (i.e. they share textures with other vanilla items), ReProccer will return their textures back to the original textures. I first noticed this when I installed Skyforged Weapons. By default, Skyforge weapons have the same textures as their steel counterparts. When I first played Skyrim, it was a little disappointing, but as time has passed, there have been a few mods created to make them stand out from their originals. So... I decided to start playing around with modding, and fix my problem at the same time. Hence this mod, or collection of mods as it will end up being.\r\n\r\nYou can get Skyre [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286//?]here[/url]!\r\n\r\nHere is the list of mods I have so far made patches for:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36815//?]Skyforged Weapons[/url]\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:\r\nBefore running ReProccer, please ensure you add any of these patches to  your blocklist.txt file.\r\n\r\nPlease post any requests for mods that need patching in the \\\"Comments\\\" section.\r\n\r\nTo do list:\r\naMidianBorn Book of Silence - Skyforge Weapons - Should be up in a few days.\r\nMake this page look prettier - Soon!",
