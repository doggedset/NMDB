  "summary": "Also known as &#34;TUSH&#34; (hehe :3)\r<br />\r<br />Ok, It&#39;s not the &#34;ULTIMATE&#34; house but it is my first mod and I&#39;m quite proud of it. Basically a house with everything you need in it. With some nice ambiance added to it as well.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Update 6/7/2016\r<br />**This mod is no longer in active development obviously. Feel free to modify and reupload as you see fit if for what ever reason you wish to do so. This was my first and most likely only mod I will ever make and to be quite honest not the most useful compared to other mods. So I guess maybe if you&#39;re learning how to mod and make &#34;Cells?&#34; I think they&#39;re called? It&#39;s been so long. You can use this as a base and reupload as your own work, But only if it has been modified.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />This is The Ultimate Skyrim House, (Also known as &#34;TUSH&#34;)\r<br />It&#39;s not totally finished yet but it is usuable and has most of the features in it already. I was originally going to make this as an alternative house to use in my broadcasts but I decided, &#34;Why not convert it and realease it to the public?&#34;\r<br />\r<br />This mod is a house added outside of white run its along it&#39;s walls, Very easy to find it will literally stare you down and wait until you get closer to it. (If you can&#39;t find it I added an image showing it&#39;s location)\r<br />\r<br />The home features the following\r<br />\r<br />- Bedroom with a nice looking chest to place your loot in\r<br />- Library To store all your books that you don&#39;t want to carry\r<br />- Crafting room, Has an alchemy table, enchanting table, weapon sharpener, forge, smelter, and a place to make your leathers, and a cooking spit :3",
