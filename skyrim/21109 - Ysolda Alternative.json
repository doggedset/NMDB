  "descriptionHtml": "What does this mod do?\r\nHave you ever noticed how every marriageable person is Skyrim is pretty-much ugly? I sure have, and I\\'ve found my self wanting to marry someone attractive other than Hroki. If your like me, and can\\'t take the ugliness, then this mod is for you! I\\'ve taken the Ysolda textures and replaced them with VERY attractive ones. I\\'ve also renamed her \\\"Ariel,\\\" because Ysolda is a horribly ugly name, and makes we want to kill myself. :D\r\nRequirements:\r\nFor this mod to work, you NEED:\r\nApachiiSkyHair: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/\r\nCBBE: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666/\r\n( ALSO DON\\'T FORGET TO GET THE BETTER FACES FROM CBBE! )\r\nProblems:\r\nThe only problem I\\'ve run into is the slightly different skin tones from neck to body. If anyone knows how to fix this, please PM me.\r\nFuture:\r\nPlease, give me re-texture Ideas for NPC\\'s! ( Female NPC\\'s Only )\r\n",
