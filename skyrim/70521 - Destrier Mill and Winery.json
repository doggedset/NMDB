  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#ffff00][size=6]Destrier Mill & Winery\r<br />[/size][/color][color=#f1c232]- A small player home in Ivarstead -[/color]\r<br />\r<br />I was in the process of making a big castle for the season. It&#39;s on the backburner, idk why I felt the need to downsize again. However, whipping this up was very satisfying and I&#39;ll enjoy using this for a while&#33; Ivarstead is a beautiful town, and my last high-class home here was well received. \r<br />\r<br />Here, we have a lower- to mid-class home for the Dragonborn that matches the aesthetic of the town. Destrier Winery is a place for the Dragonborn to run their own small wine operation- the only kind in Skyrim&#33; (Besides wherever Solitude Spiced Wine is brewed.) The mill comes with the usual bells and whistles of a starter home with a few unique items and static artifacts, and a garden in the back for proper wine-making. There is no map-marker to the home, as it&#39;s right on the south side of Ivarstead&#39;s bridge. No need to further clutter the map with markers, methinks. It is Extremely vanilla, using only the original in-game parts without DLC, but can work well with mods like MHIYH. \r<br />[color=#00ffff]\r<br />The home comes with: [/color]\r<br />- Several weapon racks and displays with 1 mannequin\r<br />- Alchemy and Enchanting workplace with 1 large bookshelf\r<br />- 3 beds of varying class for self and followers\r<br />- Unique statics often featured in my homes\r<br />- Substantial storage inside, and a woodchopping block outside\r<br />- [color=#00ff00]Several unique respawning wine barrels containing Destrier Wine&#33;[/color] \r<br />[color=#00ffff]\r<br />Thank you Hodilton for this video&#33;\r<br />[youtube]kZj8Z3h0pW0[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Thank you RavegedPyro for this one&#33;Â \r<br />[youtube]MMGk6d1E3gU[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:[/color]\r<br />- It blends seamlessly with JK&#39;s Skyrim/Ivarstead, which makes the town even more beautiful I say.\r<br />- Apparently works fine with Expanded Towns and Cities.\r<br />- No problem with my previous Teonas Manor; Not the same location.\r<br />\r<br />Thank you for taking the time with this mod, it might be a while before I get back into modding. There&#39;s a lot on my plate, but I hope for something much bigger in the making&#33; [/center]",
