  "modName": "Tar-Melamar - Numenorean King Follower",
  "summary": "Follower based on LOTR lore.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my second mod (but the first one i can upload, you know, permissions...)\r<br />\r<br />BACKGROUND:\r<br />He is based on lore from LOTR about the kings of Númenor, the island where the men came from, who founded Gondor and Arnor. (Aragorn is also of númenorean origin)\r<br />Tar-Melamar is not an original name used by one of the kings, but in the same style (e.g. Tar-Minyatur, Tar-Elendil, Tar-Meneldur...)\r<br />\r<br />CLASS, LOCATION, ETC.:\r<br />You can find Melamar at the docks in Solitude, because the Númenoreans were great shipwrights.\r<br />Right now, he has nothing in his inventory, except from clothes, so you can equip him with whatever you like.\r<br />If you want to stick with lore, i recommend heavy armor and one-handed sword and shield or two-handed sword. (His perks are made to fit this kind of equipment)\r<br />I also recommend to use MERPs Gondorian Armament: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43641/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43641/?[/url] \r<br />If you want, you can marry him as well.\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS: All you need is ApachiiSkyHair for Males - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?[/url] (you need the males version, the full version does not include all of the male hairs&#33;&#33;&#33;)",
