  "descriptionHtml": "this fix uses simple console commands to remove the default bow from the Follower\\'s inventory so that they will use the bow you give them. \r\n\r\ni found Orv420\\'s esp files didn\\'t correct this problem, however through his description he was kind enough to point the way to the console commands. and i thank him for that.\r\n\r\ntook a while to figure out the console commands so i took the liberty of mapping out the steps i took to accomplish this in this .txt file \r\n\r\nI will also admit the possibility that clearing out Lydia\\'s default bows might increase her capacity as a \\\"packmule\\\"",
