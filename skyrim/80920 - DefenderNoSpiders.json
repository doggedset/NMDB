  "summary": "A mod for skyrim that replaces the frostbite spiders with dwemer ones.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is not my mod, just a mod i used originally and i can&#39;t find anywhere. It works with the SE of skyrim. It should replace all textures (It did even before the bear one). This replaces the spiders to dwemer spiders, all classes are replaced with their dwemer counterpart. Eggsacks, webs, and loot stay the same (replaced spiders drop the venom). I got this to work only through the NMM, so i recommend using this. I can&#39;t give compatibility as this is the only mod i use.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: my only intent is to upload this for people like me, who have no problem with the dwarven spiders but have problems with the frostbites. I can&#39;t change anything on this mod and fully expect addon spiders to NOT be replaced. Intended for vanilla play as this was a day one mod. I have no knowledge of how this mod works so i can&#39;t fix anything.",
