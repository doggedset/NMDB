  "descriptionHtml": "**Update 12/15/12\r\nI have been able to fix the bugs, and now it should be fine to play on your own now! :)\r\nThank you all for the \\\"set as active\\\" info.  That was really helpful for me to be able to make this mod stable now!  Please be sure to delete the old download and use the newest download as your main download! \r\nThe bugs were:\r\nYou couldn\\'t get the armor off the mannequins (I deleted the mans.)\r\nA Chunk of the basement was moved out of place and you can fall through the \\\"black hole\\\" ;)\r\nAlso, I put the armor and new weapon into the hidden cave room, and deleted the deadric mannequins.\r\n****************\r\nI uploaded this file to steam workshop, but I don\\'t know how to change/edit the file... so, here I am uploading this file to Skyrim nexus :)\r\nThis does have a few bugs, but nothing super crazy!  I tried to edit them out, but the creation  kit won\\'t let me combine loaded plugins to create 1 mod... so until someone makes a 3rd party app that lets me do that.  I won\\'t be able to fix the bugs in this mod.  Until then, here is the mod people, this should fix it to allow you all to explore the island home! :)\r\n*********\r\nin case you didn\\'t read the small description:\r\nThis adds a new Island called Terra Vuum, which can be accessed through a \\\"trapdoor\\\" on a rowboat in Dawnstar\r\n***************\r\nThank you all and enjoy!\r\n(readme can be found in the .zip file!)",
