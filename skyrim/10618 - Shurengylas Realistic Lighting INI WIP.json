I don\\'t intend for this .ini file to undo what they are trying to fix with their lighting changes.  My goal is to make dungeons slightly brighter so that you can sneak around with a bow and still see.\r\n\r\nI recommend you run your graphic cards configuration wizard to set your gamma.  In Skyrim the brightness settings range from 1 to 20.  Mine is set on 15 adjust as needed.\r\n\r\nI am still learning the mod and tweaking settings.  I have a lot to learn please be patient.\r\n\r\nFor the Dungeon and Interior settings I use a Sepia tone or tint.  If you would like a different tint to suit your eyes go to the following site for values compatible with Realistic Lighting.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse351/www/RGBlist.html target=\\\"_blank\\\"]RGB colour values for \\\"familiar\\\" colours[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.easyrgb.com/index.php?X=HARM target=\\\"_blank\\\"]Create RGB colour complements, harmonies, themes[/url]  After the results are displayed, click the link under the column \\\"Color Calculator\\\" this will display a column of RGB 0รท1 values that are compatible with Realistic Lighting.\r\n\r\nVersion V2\r\nChanged the tint so it isn\\'t as red. \r\nSwitched from modifiers to multipliers (Figured them out finally) \r\nAll settings close to plugin values. Slightly brighter dungeons with rich colors. \r\nThese settings are tuned to a brightness of 14. Lower your brightness in game as needed. \r\n\r\n2/22/2010\r\n\r\nVersion V2 Removed I uploaded the wrong file that I had used to learn how to make adjustments with multipliers.  I had not run the patcher and the settings were darker then the original mod.  I will upload V3 at a later date.",
