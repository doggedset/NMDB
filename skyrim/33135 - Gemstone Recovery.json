  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][center]This mod is intended for Skyrim version 1.9.32.0.8 or higher. Older versions of the game might not work with this mod.[/center][/heading]\n<br />The Gemstone Recovery mod is a simple and highly compatible mod that adds new recipes to the smelter which will allow you to melt down your jewelry items and recover the gemstones that were used to create them. This helps fix some of the ever-annoying gemstone scarcity problems in the game by allowing you to acquire gemstones from the various jewelry that you find, buy, steal, or create. The gemstones received from a piece of jewelry are the same as what is required to make that piece of jewelry. E.g., if you melt down a gold diamond ring you'll get exactly one diamond back from it.\n<br />\n<br />No new items or scripts are added by this mod; only new smelter recipes are added, ensuring that this mod is compatible with many other mods as well as allowing it to be installed and uninstalled at will with no ill effects on your save files.\n<br />\n<br />New smelter recipes as implemented by this mod:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Garnet (cost: Silver Garnet Ring)\n<br />[*]Amethyst (cost: Silver Amethyst Ring)\n<br />[*]Ruby (cost: Silver Ruby Ring)\n<br />[*]Sapphire (cost: Gold Sapphire Ring)\n<br />[*]Emerald (cost: Gold Emerald Ring)\n<br />[*]Diamond (cost: Gold Diamond Ring)\n<br />[*]Flawless Garnet x2 (cost: Silver Jeweled Necklace)\n<br />[*]Flawless Amethyst x2 (cost: Gold Jeweled Necklace)\n<br />[*]Flawless Ruby (cost: Gold Ruby Necklace)\n<br />[*]Flawless Sapphire (cost: Silver Sapphire Necklace)\n<br />[*]Flawless Emerald (cost: Silver Emerald Necklace)\n<br />[*]Flawless Diamond (cost: Gold Diamond Necklace)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Note: These recipes are hidden by default and will only appear when you have one of the aforementioned pieces of jewelry in your inventory.\n<br />[heading]Installation:[/heading]\n<br />Either use a mod manager (such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334]Mod Organizer[/url]), or copy Gemstone_Recovery.esp into the Data subfolder of your Skyrim installation directory and then enable it in the launcher.\n<br />[heading]Uninstallation:[/heading]\n<br />Either remove/disable it in your mod manager, or delete Gemstone_Recovery.esp from the Data subfolder of your Skyrim installation directory.\n<br />[heading]Permissions[/heading]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]You may not upload this mod to other sites without my permission.\n<br />[*]You may not distribute this mod without my permission.\n<br />[*]You may not include this mod, in whole or in part, inside or alongside other mods without my permission.\n<br />[*]You may not release altered versions of this mod without my permission.\n<br />[*]You may not release translated versions of this mod without my permission.\n<br />[*]If I have not noted something here regarding my mod as needing my permission that does [b][u]not[/u][/b] mean you don't need my permission for it.
