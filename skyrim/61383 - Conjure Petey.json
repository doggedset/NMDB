  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a spell that allows you to summon Petey, the white rat from the web series Unforgotten Realms. The spell tome is in the Riverwood Trader, on the counter just waiting for you to claim it! (It is marked as 'steal' in game though, so be cautious picking it up!) \n<br />   Petey starts at level 10, more than capable of defending you from renegade civilians and helping out in beginner quests, and will level with you up to level 80. The spell lasts for 300 seconds, or 3 minutes, and costs little to cast, making Petey an easy companion to summon on your adventures! He is also essential, so don't worry about losing your rat friend!\n<br />   This is my first mod ever, so constructive criticism and bug notifications are always welcome! I've also been thinking of adding the two main characters from Unforgotten Realms as followers, so if you have any advice on custom armor or creating custom voices, it would be much appreciated!Â  \n<br />WARNING: Whereas the mod itself doesn't contain anything inappropriate, the webseries it was inspired by is not for all ages. Don't let the kiddies do any searching for the original material!",
