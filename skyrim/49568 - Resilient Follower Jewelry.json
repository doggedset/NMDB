  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][b][b][i][color=#ffff00]Skyrim SE version nowÂ [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2997]available[/url][/color][/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[u]Description[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />When a follower goes into &#34;bleedout&#34; (i.e., health below 10% and falls to their knees), they often get back up with almost no health and so if any enemy so much as breathes on them they immediately fall down again into another bleedout and the cycle repeats (especially with essential/protected followers).\r<br />\r<br />This mod provides jewelry in the form of Rings of Resilience and Necklaces of Resilience to give to your followers. When they wear one of these pieces of jewelry, they will heal after several seconds on their knees, so they get up from bleedout quicker and also have more health when they get back into the fight. \r<br />\r<br />I know some people prefer the opposite behavior - that followers in bleedout stay down longer - but I&#39;d rather have them back in the fight, especially because I tend to play on a higher difficulty where the loss of a follower in mid-combat can be a big problem.\r<br />\r<br />The concept for the mod is based upon the Spriggan, which has a script which allows it to heal while in bleedout (albeit, on the spriggan they are only allowed to heal once). \r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][u]Notes[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]This jewelry has no effect if worn by the player.\r<br />[*]The NPC wearer does not technically have to be a follower. If you can give it to them (trade, reverse pickpocket, etc.) so that they will equip it, that is all that is required.\r<br />[*]This will not make non-essential/non-protected followers unkillable, but it will give them a fighting chance when they stand back up from bleedout since they will have more health.\r<br />[*]If you give both a necklace AND a ring to an NPC, they will &#34;double-heal&#34; and so this might be overpowered.\r<br />[*]Heal amount is currently 100 health.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][u]Where Do I Find the Jewelry[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />In the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun. Look for the strongbox labeled &#34;Gifts of Kynareth&#34; on the floor directly under the Shrine of Kynareth.\r<br />\r<br />There are 20 rings and 20 necklaces, so all your followers can be equipped.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][u]Requirements[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />Vanilla Skyrim.
