  "descriptionHtml": "Hi all;)\r\n\r\nMost modifications such as always depended on the intensity of the color change and nothing else.\r\nThanks to this alpha channel transparency of a reduced effect of this was that the - component plants after the break they looked the same as before the break!\r\nThanks so not once flew to the plant itself as seen from a distance of (cos there is) and place it turned out that nothing of this: D\r\nThe original texture nieruszane by lovers (saturation and nothing more) they looked too pale - but it is properly respond to breaking component ...\r\n-------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------\r\nIn my modification poloczylem find everything here and new colors and set them according to the alpha channel!\r\n-------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe modification changes the appearance of all plants.\r\n\r\n- Changed colors.\r\n- Changed the saturation of colors.\r\n- Now the break is only a small plant flowers! (after a period away you already know you have something to break or not yet)\r\n- I set the alpha channel so that when the plants break you can see it was still only in the lower parts of the plant ...\r\n- Changed texture sharpness.\r\n- Many plants I added extra texture. (as in my modified grass)\r\n- Now are more realistic colors (red = red no orange, etc. ..)\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT - before copying files make sure the folder (skyrim / data / textures / plants) is empty, or in general do not have one :)\r\notherwise it is a small chance, but it is that you have the files under extensions (n) example [plants_n.dds] who will not be replaced by my tosline and contains data from other plants - it will not correct display of textures! (bad bumpmapping)\r\n\r\nMY OTHER MODS\r\n\r\nmore grass and recolour ------------------------------ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28119\r\nNEW skill interface ------------------------------------ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27980\r\nTextures for mountains ------------------------------- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27999\r\nTextures for caves ------------------------------------- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25768\r\nRain and Thunders ------------------------------------- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26092",
