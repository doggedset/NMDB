  "descriptionHtml": "This plug-in is a more Lore Friendly version of Super Ale, a generic Ale replacement called Celtic Special Stout that increases your carrying capacity by 250 for 4 hours. It is more expensive and the effect is lower, with a duration decrease. \r\nFor the full power of Super Ale, go here:\r\n http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11035\r\nOnly one of these will work at time. \r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nDownload and extract to: C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data or where ever your Skyrim/Data file is located.\r\nUninstall:\r\nDelete the file SuperAleLF.esp \r\n\r\nI don\\'t think these files will install with NMM, however you can control them from the NMM interface.
