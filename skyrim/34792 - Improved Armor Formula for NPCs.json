  "summary": "Applies [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15860]Troy1010\\'s Improved Armor Formula[/url] to NPCs. No armor cap! Rationally scaling effective health! Immersive! Realisitic! Compatible with all body types!",
  "descriptionHtml": "The vanilla armor system is a joke. You can hit the cap in iron armor if you want. Not only that but the last 100 armor gives more effective hit points than the first 467. And raising the armor cap so better armors are actually worth more makes the effective hp scaling even worse. Someone should clean up this game.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/IntbUe0.gif[/IMG]\r\nIt was [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15860]Troy1010 and his wonderful and neglected Improved Armor Formula[/url]. Sadly Troy lost the use of the CK in a freak boating accident before he applied it to everyone besides the player. \r\n\r\nWith his implied consent I have slightly reworked his script and done the legwork to get it onto all the sexy argonians you will meet and try to conquer in your adventures. You know the ones I mean.\r\n\r\nwhats it do?\r\nI dunno I just know I can\\'t stop eating them. Seriously read [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15860]Troy1010 and his wonderful and neglected Improved Armor Formula[/url] page. You will need that one too if you want the player to use the new formula too. When I said NPCs I meant only NPCs.\r\n\r\nerrata\r\nIt uses a cloak effect so you might get brawl bugs. Turn the effect off by opening the console and typing \\\"set dht_IAFDisable to 1\\\" without the quotes of course and waiting a few seconds. Once your fisticuffs are finished type \\\"set dht_IAFDisable to 0\\\" to re-enable it.",
