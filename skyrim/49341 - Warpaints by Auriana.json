I will do it myself when I have the inclination and the opportunity.[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />I'm sorry if this decision disappoints you, but I would like to be responsible for my own mod pages and how the mods behave in the game. \n<br />\n<br />I have no idea how my mods for Oldrim will work in SSE, even after conversion, and I want to have a proper handle on that [i]myself [/i]before I put them out there for other people to use in their games.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Thanks,[/size]\n<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#B45F06][size=3]Auri[/size][/color][/font][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b]**Seven additional dragon-themed warpaints have also been included as an optional file. This was previously a separate mod. They can be used by both genders and all races (though they look a bit odd on beast races because the details are lost on fur and scales). All warpaints are entitled \"AV1DragonPaint\" in the textures menu.**[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Details\n<br />=======\n<br />[center][b]***This mod requires [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]RaceMenu by expired[/url] and the corresponding version of SKSE in order to work!***[/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />Warpaints range from large to small, simple to intricate, and vibrant to subtle. These paints were made intentionally for female characters, but due to the nature of RaceMenu, all of them will *technically* work on all races and both genders; however, it should be noted that many may be positioned slightly incorrectly on males, and details are bound to be lost on beast races.\n<br />\n<br />All paints are titled \"AuriV1Warpaint\" in the RaceMenu.\n<br />\n<br />[center][b]***It is strongly advised that you make the SKSE .ini tweak as follows: ***[/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[Display]\n<br />iTintTextureResolution=2048\n<br />\n<br />[center]This is to avoid pixelated textures.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />Install\n<br />=======\n<br />1. Extract the files to a temporary location, such as the desktop.\n<br />2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.\n<br />3. Copy files to (install folder)Skyrim\n<br />4. Start Skyrim Launcher, click 'Data Files', place a checkmark beside the .esp file.\n<br />\n<br />Uninstall\n<br />=========\n<br />1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file(s).\n<br />2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.\n<br />\n<br />Known Issues or Bugs\n<br />====================\n<br />Some paints are very faint and work better on darker-skinned characters. Some may also benefit from layering.\n<br />\n<br />History\n<br />=======\n<br />1.0, 2013/12/30 - Initial release.\n<br />      2014/2/05 - Added optional Dragonpaint file\n<br />\n<br />Contact\n<br />=======\n<br />Comment or send me a PM.\n<br />\n<br />Credits\n<br />=======\n<br />Main File GIMP brushes/designs from www.obsidiandawn.com (aka [url=http://redheadstock.deviantart.com/]redheadstock[/url] on DeviantArt)\n<br />Dragonpaint warpaints were created using the [url=http://auriv1.deviantart.com/art/Eleventeen-Dragon-Series-82825096]Eleventeen Dragon Series GIMP Brushes by Catdragon[/url].\n<br />Thanks to TairenSoul and SkyrimKnight2013 for helping me learn how to make my own warpaints. :)\n<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\n<br />Thanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Tools Used\n<br />==========\n<br />7-Zip - http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=15579\n<br />GIMP - http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=14920\n<br />Readme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\n<br />\n<br />Licensing/Legal\n<br />===============\n<br />This mod is not to be uploaded to any other site, regardless of whether or not you can contact me.",
