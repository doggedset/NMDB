  "descriptionHtml": "Yes, yes, \\\"O really now, yet another player house?\\\" you say. Or not. Uh, anyways... I swear this house is nice. And mysterious. I swear.\r\n\r\nWhen I designed this house I was aiming for a player character that at least wanted to keep up the pretense of normalcy to other characters. The Dark Brotherhood assassin that didn\\'t want everybody else to know what he/she is. The secretive mage. The thief wanting to protect his/her stolen goods. A vampire who\\'d want a protected base from intruders. The werewolf with a pile of hay and some meat in the basement.\r\n\r\nMystery House is located in the centralized area of Riverwood, though the key to gain access to it is located in the Farm Overseer building in Blackreach. So not exactly a starter house, but still keeping to the warm and cozy side. If you don\\'t want to do a bit of trekking you can always use the console code coc mysteryhouseb2 and grab the secondary key located inside. \r\n\r\nAdded Outside:\r\n2 Beehive houses\r\n2 Chickens\r\n1 Egg\r\n1 Wheat Plant\r\n3 Salmon\r\n3 Leeks\r\n3 Cabbage\r\n2 Gourds\r\nThief Cache\r\n1 Non-respawning barrel\r\nBoat\r\nBench\r\nCart\r\n\r\nInside the House:\r\n10+ Weapon racks\r\n3 Mannequins\r\n10+ Storage chests\r\n2 (dead) Harvest-able salmon\r\n3 (alive & swimming) Harvest-able salmon\r\n1 Fishscale (custom)\r\n3 Wardobes\r\nBlacksmith Forge\r\nSmelter (disguised as a stool)\r\nGrindstone\r\nWorkbench\r\n1 Crossed sword weapon plaque with dragon skull\r\n10+ single weapon plaques\r\n2 Large sword cases\r\n2 Dagger cases\r\n2 Dressers\r\n1 End table\r\n1 Garlic Braid\r\n1 Dried Elves Ear\r\n1 Dried Frost Mirriam\r\n5 End tables\r\n1 Backpack\r\n1 Pot container\r\nCooking pot\r\n1 Cupboard\r\n2 Sacks\r\n10+ Barrels\r\n3 Raven eggs (custom)\r\n1 Raven feather (custom)\r\n1 Safe\r\n4 Rabbits\r\n4 Pheasants\r\n1 Double Bed\r\n1 Hay pile\r\n1 Vampire bed\r\n10+ Alchemy jars (custom)\r\n1 Satchel\r\n2 Soulgem strongbox\r\n4 Soulgem sacks\r\n5 Large bookshelves (270 books)\r\n2 single shelves (22 books)\r\n5+ Large Shelves\r\nLots of hanging moss\r\n1 crimson nirnroot (custom, noiseless)\r\nAtronach forge\r\nOne-way teleporter (11 different locations)\r\nDragonfly spawnpoint\r\n\r\nThis house has two \\'hidden\\' areas in the basement section. To get to the main hidden area, you not only have to find the door but pull a lever to open the gate. The second hidden area requires a brief swim underwater. \r\n\r\nSorry about the lack of mannequins. I just think they\\'re creepy in how they sometimes breathe and move, on top of not always displaying armor properly.\r\n\r\nThe one-way teleporter is exactly that; you can teleport to the vanilla player houses as well as the other secondary player bases. Like the Arch-Mage tower, The Ragged Flagon, Jorvaskr, and Dawnstar Sanctuary. The other portals are to the Farm Overseer house in Blackreach and High Hrothgar. These will take you directly inside the buildings, not outside by the door.\r\n\r\nAlchemical jars are basically just containers pre-sorted and named based off of their various types, though if you just want to dump all your ingredients into one container there\\'s also a satchel and chest under the alchemy station. Same goes for the enchanting station, except with soulgems and sacks. Only black soulgems and grand soulgems have a slightly fancier strongbox.\r\n\r\nMost of the \\'new\\' items this house comes with are mostly just for aesthetic purposes and nothing fancy. Like actually having a spoon next to a bowl of stew, dropped bird feathers from the pet bird, etc etc. \r\n\r\nOh yeah, now got a pet bird. \r\n",
