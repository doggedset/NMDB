  "descriptionHtml": "Progress is going well, I\\'m full of ideas and feedback has been astounding. As this mod grows, so does my knowledge and experience with the tools at hand. Expect consistent updates and a more user friendly layout across all hosting and information sites. \r\n\r\n!Please keep posting your ideas either here or at the forums and it has a good chance at being featured in the mod!\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Info on future changes and greater mod description here----http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1348596-relzwip-loot-overhaul-rebalanced/\r\n\r\nCurrent Version Change-log:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n--- Removed all gold leveled lists from Draugr loot (NPCs, Bosses, Urns)\r\n--- An alchemical ingredient \\\"Ash\\\" can be found in place of gold loot in urns ( both large and small).\r\n---Also, a few rare items are thrown into the lists with a low chance of dropping. This will influence you to still look inside these containers.\r\n--- Bandit gold loot, both boss and npc lists, is now more static. Bandits no longer get richer while you level.\r\n\r\nI feel these changes will really help that lower level feeling of challenge remain into the higher levels. Focus is later versions will be that of making vendor items more worthwhile and less scaled. Hand placing lore, dungeon and risk appropriate loot throughout Tamriel. Things that were once common and easy to come by will be much rarer and coveted.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n--- Can use NMM or drop the zip folder into Bash Installers. Also, can manual install by          unpacking into the skyrim/data folder.\r\n\r\n--- Upon load up you may want to wait for 3 days( or however long your cell respawn timer is)\r\nit shouldn\\'t be an issue but it\\'s always good to do to prevent any possible glitches.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n---Uninstall, delete from the data folder or overwrite. Current updates are relatively minor and should not cause an issue. Keep a back up save handy just in case. Also, wait length of your cell respawn timer upon load up.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n--- Use NMM or remove the LORe.esp from your skyrim/data folder.",
