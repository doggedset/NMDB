  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Tahoma][color=#ffe599][size=3][i][center]Where does the power of the dragon&#39;s voice come from?\r<br />Not many people in Skyrim asked this question, but one person did. Ions ago. \r<br />Vienele was born in the First Era. She met Wulfharth, and became interested in the power of the Voice. That was when Ele Laurene (listen to her if you want to know how to pronounce it) showed herself. She made Vienele a part of Nirn. \r<br />Decades ago, the temple Vienele and the other members of her order built, collapsed. She was the only survivor. Now she is locked up there. \r<br />You, adventurer, can save her. Just take the key and open the door. It&#39;s that simple.[/center][/i][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]Where to find Vienele:[/b][/size]\r<br />She can be found in a small ruin near [b][color=#ffe599]Reachwind Eyrie[/color][/b].\r<br />[img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/61558-3-1420922367.jpg[/img]\r<br />The key is quite close to the door. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]What does she do?[/b][/size]\r<br />She has all the [b][color=#ffe599]capacities[/color][/b] of a regular follower.\r<br />She will [color=#ffe599][b]comment [/b][/color]on the location you are in (if you are not sneaking). She might also do this if you talk to her, depending on where exactly you are.\r<br />She might[b][color=#ffe599] sing,[/color][/b] if she feels like doing so.\r<br />She is the last of the order of Ele Laurene, and as such, you may join this order. She can also give you the blessing of Ele Laurene.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]The sound of magic:[/size][/b]\r<br />This mod not only comes with a follower, it also adds a [b][color=#ffe599]small home in Markarth[/color][/b], where Vienele used to live. If she leaves your service, she will return there. The house has a [b][color=#ffe599]map-marker,[/color][/b] so it should be easy to find. \r<br />In the house, there are three books. Just walk straight ahead, and you will find them.\r<br />These are [b][color=#ffe599]spell tomes[/color][/b] that teach to some &#39;spells&#39;. They will not draw on magic and (might) not improve any magic abilities, because with them, you are channelling the power of sound. Therefore, they [b][color=#ffe599]deplete stamina[/color][/b]. You will be able to use them if you have no stamina left. You do need to wear the [b][color=#ffe599]Ring of Ele Laurene[/color][/b] to be able to cast them.\r<br />The three spells are:\r<br />[b][color=#ffe599]Song of things[/color][/b] - will draw objects to you (telekinesis)\r<br />[b][color=#ffe599]Song of Sanction[/color][/b] - creates a ring from which undead will flee (circle of protection)\r<br />[b][color=#ffe599]Sound of Silence[/color][/b] - makes you more silent (muffle)\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]Known issues:[/size][/b]\r<br />I copied the sound of [b][color=#ffe599]Erandur[/color][/b] and apparently edited the wrong lines. (Creation Kit is a bit difficult here) This means that Erandur will (probably) not talk while wandering Skyrim or exploring dungeons, if you have this mod installed. I am searching for a solution.\r<br />The [b][color=#ffe599]quality of the voice-acting[/color][/b] is not too good. I don&#39;t own a microphone that will give a true and high quality sound. You should live with that.\r<br />The hood from Nocturnal does something strange to [b][color=#ffe599]the hair[/color][/b]. (also on Nocturnal herself, apparent) I just couldn&#39;t find anything else to fit the robes. If you give her a helmet (or a hat perhaps) the hair will be normal again.\r<br />The mod is incompatible with [color=#ffe599][b]Skyrim Landscape Overhaul[/b][/color], as pointed out by PsYchoMurderer.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]Solved Issues (and other changes):[/b]\r<br />[/size]The [b][color=#ffe599]grey face bug[/color][/b] is fixed in version 1.01 (thanks to GMus, MrGrymReaper and Seijin8)  \r<br />Version 1.01 makes her [b][color=#ffe599]sing[/color][/b] every song only once every [b][color=#ffe599]in-game[/color][/b] day.\r<br />Version 1.02 should make Vienele [b][color=#ffe599]level[/color][/b] with the player, starting at level 20 and going up to level 300. Thanks davoshannon for pointing it out.\r<br />There now is a patch using [b][color=#ffe599]ApachiiHair[/color][/b] for a new hairdo. It deletes the Nocturnal hood, since they are not compatible. You need the main file and Apachii&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]Extra Information and FAQ:\r<br />[/size][color=#ffe599][u]What songs does she sing?[/u][/color][/b]\r<br />Song of the Dragonborn, The first couplet of Sovngarde, The first and last couplet of Krummavísur\r<br />[color=#ffe599][b][u]What is [/u][/b][b][u]Krummavísur?[/u][/b][/color]\r<br />It is an old Islandic song. I am not Islandic, so I probably sung it quite wrong, but I like the song.\r<br />[b][u][color=#ffe599]Is it lore friendly?[/color][/u][/b]\r<br />I would say so. Even though Ele Laurene is nowhere in the Elder Scrolls Lore, I think she fits in there. I did not (yet) come across a way of explaining where the power of the Thu&#39;um comes from. This is my explanation.\r<br />[u][color=#ffe599][b]What exactly is Ele Laurene?[/b][/color][/u]\r<br />It is a spirit. She is neither an Aedra nor a Daedra. She is a force of nature. \r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]Leaving comments:[/size][/b]\r<br />As you might know from my other mods, I do appreciate [b][color=#ffe599]hints and tips[/color][/b]. I always try to find ways to improve my mods.\r<br />You might also know that I have [b][color=#ffe599]not been all to busy with my old mods[/color][/b]. Be assured, I will still work on them&#33;\r<br />I made this mod because it is easier to write dialogue and make spells during the break of a lecture, then work on towns and other things in the Render-window. This was just a small break-project.\r<br />[/font]Oh and if you are a voice-actor or do want your voice on a follower: if I have time, and am not too busy with improving my old mods, I might want to make a [b][color=#ffe599]follower with your voice-files[/color][/b]&#33; Just send me a pm.",
