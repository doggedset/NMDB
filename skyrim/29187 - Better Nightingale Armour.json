  "summary": "This is a mod that changes the enchantments to something more suitable on the Nightingale armour.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes the enchantments that comes to benefit for Archers and Close-up Assassins.\r\n\r\nWhat made me start making this mod, was that I found it ridiculous that a armour you have to equir like this doesn\\'t have Archery perks (Which is a bit ironic considering you get the Nightingale Bow later in the story).\r\n\r\nI have relocated a few enchantments and added some, that will benefit any type of assassin (Archer, Close-up/Dagger and Arcane/Illusion).\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the mod as much as i do. Pictures will be up soon, I just have to find the right software to take the pictures first:)\r\n\r\nAnd a little shout-out to the Nightingale Prime HD mod by AncientVampire, that fits well to this mod:)",
