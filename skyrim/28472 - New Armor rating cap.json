  "descriptionHtml": "[color=yellow][b]Description:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />In vanilla you need 567 armor rating to reach 80% damage reduction, the capped reduction.\r<br />\r<br />This means that at certain point armor crafting is useless. Many people have far more then 567, but it&#39;s useless due to 567 armor rating cap.\r<br />\r<br />I suggest this values: 667, 767, 867, 1000, 2000.\r<br />\r<br />For player who has reached incredible high values there are extreme high armor rating caps: 10000, 11000, 12000, 13000, 15000.\r<br />\r<br />You can start playing with one option, then when you reach a cap you can progressive choose one .esp to change the cap. No conflict, no problems. \r<br />\r<br />Armor rating cap will also affect npc but slightly less compared to player.\r<br />Maybe they will be more fragile, if you find that too easy, use difficulty setting optional file. It changes your damage done. More info in readme.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Make daedric upgrade to be worthwhile&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Suggest your armor rating and i will make new cap for you.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]How to calculate your damage reduction:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Easy, for 1000 version take your armor rating add +25 for each armor item weared and multiply it for 0.0728.\r<br />For 2000 version multiply your armor rating add +25 for each armor item weared for 0.0381.\r<br />\r<br />I will give you a pratic example: i have 500 armor rating. \r<br />With 1000 version your damage reduction is ((500+100)*0.0728)) 43,68% . \r<br />With 2000 version is ((500+100)*0.0381)) 22,86%.\r<br />And how much damage reduction i will have without this mods? With 500 your damage reduction is ((500+100)*0.12)) 72%.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Each armor item you wear adds an hidden +25 to your armor rating. For example wearing, helm, chest, boot and gloves (shield excluded) gives you a +100, but this value will remain hidden.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]AR 1134 rebalanced:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />In this version i have also tweaked very hard difficulty. Now damage done/received by player is 38%/180% down from 50%/200%. \r<br />Melee damage is buffed since NPC and player has less armor, but magic damage is nerfed.\r<br />To balance that i have tweaked player magicka regen rate from 33% to 40%. \r<br />Also dual casting get buffed: cost in reduced from 2.8 to 2.5 and effectiveness is increased from 2.2 to 3.0. Dual casting affect also npc. I guess. It&#39;s a global value so i think so. \r<br />The formula to calc your damage reduction will be: AR+100*0.0649.\r<br />\r<br />This optional files was the result of my experience, for me it was the best solution, but your experience may be very different.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]My other mods:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3271584/?tb=mods&pUp=1]Check all of them here[/url]",
