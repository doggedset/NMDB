  "descriptionHtml": "I will be working on the parallax shader files, to make this even more awesome. \r\n\r\nI\\'m giving out a special \\\"bright rock version\\\", which changes all hills to another specific brighter color, while the smaller rocks remain diverse.  See version 1.1a for it. The main difference is to version 1.0 is that all mountains received a brighter texture. (Originally I was just testing, but I liked it myself, and figured others may like it as well) \r\n\r\nI am adding new textures to the gameworld, since Skyrim only uses 2 textures ( both are essentially the same) for ALL rocks and stones. So, you can download whatever texture mod for your game, as long as there are no modified rock mesh files, all other modders can only replace or change these 2 (!) textures.  I am including several different textures and the only way to do this is to change the rock mesh (3D model) properties to accept the new textures. \r\n\r\nUpcoming version changes:\r\n1. get some high res textures. Or make them from scratch, test them within the game\r\n2. Reduce redundant/unnecessary files from the mod. \r\n\r\nNote: Some screenshots may not reflect the current version of the mod. This is due to this mod being a WIP (Work In Progress) and each version changes the textures around or one or more texture type may get axed. \r\n\r\nNote:\r\nIf you are using a high-resolution texture mod, this mod will not go well , since these textures are only 1024x1024, so obviously a re-texture mod using 2048x2048 or 4096 resolution such as the Skyrim HD or Realistic overhaul , you are better off not using this mod. \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 \r\n1. Removing some previous textures not suitable\r\n2. Experimenting with Parallax shader. \r\n\r\nUpcoming changes :\r\n1. Further texture improvements\r\n2. Proper normal textures for individual rocks (if you don\\'t know what a normal map is, it\\'s what makes the rock rough looking and/or shiny)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation: Unzip it and copy the textures and meshes folders into your skyrim/data directory. \r\nCompatibility: Works with other texture mods modifying the textures, since mine changes the texture property of the meshes, not the original textures (for now). \r\n\r\nUninstallation. Delete the meshes/landscape  folder, as well as textures/landscape if you have no other landscape mods, if you do, then you should have used the mod manager to install and remove the mod. ",
