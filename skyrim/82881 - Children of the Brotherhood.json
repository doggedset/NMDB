  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds new clothes for both Aventus Aretino and Babette from the Dark Brotherhood questline.\r<br />\r<br />Because Aventus was in his home for so long, handling human flesh and performing the black sacrament, I thought it would be more realistic if I added bloodstains and dirt to his clothing. As for Babette, she now has an outfit that suits her, as she IS in the Dark Brotherhood and thus requires its uniform.",
