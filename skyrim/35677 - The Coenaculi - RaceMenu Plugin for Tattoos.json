This mod has gone through a lot of phases and changes over its course.\r<br />\r<br />The first version was for use with Caliente’s TexBlend mod. This was received well at first, but fell short due to limited choices and customizing.\r<br />\r<br />Second to come was the utilization of Paint.NET which is a free photo editing program. While this opened the door for customizing by picking and choosing which tattoo(s) you wanted, it was an alien program to many. After receiving multiple complaints, one from a very dissatisfied person, I decided to go for broke and learn how to make a RaceMenu plugin.\r<br />\r<br />This was a whole new territory for me because the only scripts/codes I’ve written have been HTML scripts. I had to learn a new code for a new mod and learn how to create what I would need using CK and various other programs.\r<br />After reading, failed trials, and more reading until I started seeing lines of code every time I closed my eyes, I asked for help; and I got the best kind.\r<br />\r<br />Now with the enormous help from Expired, I give you The Coenaculi – Tattoo Parlor: A RaceMenu plugin. I know it’s kind of the same name, but I like it too much.\r<br />Now everyone has free reign of customization without having to learn a new program&#33;[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=#DA70D6]Below will be the normal subjects that every decent mod has, but I’m giving you shortcuts&#33; You’ll notice a [/color]**[color=#DA70D6] followed by a number next to each subject below.

This provides users with terrific options for customizing the look they want for their character. And, since this is now a plugin for a character creation mod, it doesn&#39;t overwrite your body texture. This means that [u]only[/u] your character will have the tattoos you choose with no hassle of making sure to install a texture in the right folder.\r<br />\r<br />   The last and more important thing I&#39;ve done for user convenience, is packing all the texture files into a BSA. Instead of a [b]HUGE[/b] 1 GB file size to download, you’re now only downloading a few MBs if that. I know&#33; That’s so nice of me. \r<br />[u]Cue more applause.\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/color][color=#00ffff][b][u][i]Regarding Version Zen:[/i][/u][/b]\r<br />Because of the extensive amount of tattoos I worked with and having to resize, reshape, and replace many of them to fit each body type, the names of tats have changed. If you&#39;re a user of a previous version, you&#39;ll notice some tats are no longer available or others have been moved. Because of this, you will have to perform a clean save before updating to Zen and then reapply the tats.\r<br />\r<br />There are now 4 plugins to choose from: CBBE, UNP, Male, Vanilla. If you use any body textures that involves one of these 4, such as Navatsea or UN7B, then download the appropriate plugin. See the Q&A section for more info.\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][u]Due to the names used being the same for each plugin, I recommend NOT using more than 1 plugin at a time.[/u][/i][/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-5.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/35677-4-1378109854.jpg[/img]\r<br />**2[size=4]\r<br />   The following are mods that are required, which means, [u][b][i]YOU NEED THESE&#33;[/i][/b][/u]\r<br />1 – [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29624/?]RaceMenu by Expired[/url]\r<br />[color=#FF00FF]You must have main file and any Optional files you want installed first.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />2 – [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE)[/url]\r<br />[color=#FF00FF]Make sure the version is the latest.

If you’re running an illegal copy, good luck.

Then activate version Ju and apply your tattoos.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[color=#FFD700]- The Coenaculi.bsa\r<br />- The Coenaculi.bsl\r<br />- The Coenaculi.esp[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]If using &#34;Loose&#34; Optional files:\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]- Data folder\r<br />- The Coenaculi.esp[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]   I recommend installing with NMM. Just click “Install with NMM” inside the Files tab.\r<br />   Once installed by NMM, be sure to have The Coenaculi.esp active and loading [u]below/after[/u] RaceMenu and all RaceMenu optionals you may have.\r<br />\r<br />   If you prefer to manually install, then it’s as simple as unpacking the Coenaculi folder and placing its contents inside the Data folder. Once there, make sure The Coenaculi.esp is active and loading [u]below/after[/u] RaceMenu and all RaceMenu optionals you may have.[/size]\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-5.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/35677-1-1378109985.jpg[/img]\r<br />**4[size=3]\r<br />Remove the following files from the Data folder:\r<br />1)   The Coenaculi.esp\r<br />2)   The Coenaculi.bsa\r<br />3)   The Coenaculi.bsl\r<br />\r<br />If using  &#34;Loose&#34; Optional files:\r<br />1) TheCoenaculi.esp\r<br />2) Scripts &gt; thecoenaculi(cbbe,unp,male,vanilla)\r<br />3) Scripts &gt; Source &gt; thecoenaculi(cbbe,unp,male,vanilla)\r<br />4) Textures &gt; Actors &gt; Character &gt; Character Assets &gt; Overlays &lt;-[ Delete ]\r<br />\r<br />[/size]NMM may NOT remove these files for you so be sure to double check if uninstalled via NMM.\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br /> [img]http://static-5.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/35677-4-1378109708.jpg[/img]\r<br />**5\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ea9999][size=4]The Overlay option has been removed in RaceMenu 3.0+. You&#39;ll find the Paints options in the main window to the right. You&#39;ll see &#34;Makeup, Body Paint, Face Paint, Hand Paint, Feet Paint&#34; options. The Makeup option is for Warpaints and you&#39;ll find 0 Coenaculi tats there.\r<br />\r<br />Once in game, press the ` key to open the Skyrim command. Type showracemenu and hit Enter. This will open the Character Creation. Scroll to the right to find the Paints/Tattoos options (ignore the Makeups option).\r<br />\r<br />We&#39;ll use Body Paints for our example.\r<br />\r<br />When you select Body Paints, you&#39;ll see some &#34;default&#34; listed in the window. Choose one of these defaults and follow the instructions on the bottom of the creation menu to choose a color and texture. Texture refers to a tattoo/paint. Be sure to adjust the color first because the default color is transparent, so selected tattoos won&#39;t show until a color is selected.\r<br />\r<br />Perform this for each default to choose your tats and adjust the color for each. See the FAQs below to learn how to add more defaults and thus more tattoo choices.\r<br />\r<br />If you need to turn/rotate your character and/or camera, you&#39;ll need to select the Camera Tab on the top right. Then follow the instructions on the bottom to adjust what you need. This will allow you to see each tattoo even if placed on the back.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-5.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/35677-2-1378109986.jpg[/img]\r<br />**6[size=4]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]Version Ju[/color]:[color=#00FF7F] - Scripts have been edited and recompiled using SKSE 1.7.3 and RaceMenu 3.0+ scripts.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]Version Zen[/color]:[color=#00FF7F] - The Coenaculi_Makeup Plugin has been removed.\r<br />- All tattoos have been resized, reshaped, and some moved to better fit each of the 4 base body types.\r<br />- 4 plugins now created for each base body.\r<br />- Each plugin has Face, Body, Hands, Feet tats.\r<br />- Tattoos have been renamed.\r<br />- More Lore friendly tattoos have been added to each plugin.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]Version Kyu[/color]: [color=#00FF7F]- All Face/Head tattoos have been removed from The Coenaculi and placed into The Coenaculi_Makeup. This will allow Glow to be used on ALL Face/Head tats.\r<br />- Some Face/Head tattoos were removed.\r<br />- NEW TATTOOS&#33; In celebration and thanks for reaching 1,000 Endorsements, I&#39;ve added new Face/Head tats with the Desu1K filter.\r<br />- NEW TATTOOS&#33; DesuScales has been added. A &#34;Full Body&#34; tattoo of Dragon Scales. There is clipping. It is unavoidable.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]Version Hachi[/color]: [color=#00FF7F]-\r<br />8 Eye makeup options, 4 of which used to be located in Warpaints. All 8 are under FacePaints and can be used with the Glow option from RaceMenu.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]Version Nana[/color]: [color=#00FF7F]-\r<br />1) CBBE and UNP scripts updated for RaceMenu 2.5.1\r<br />2) Coenaculi_Makeup released with basic makeup options (Eye shadow, tints, and liner. Lipstick.)[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]Version Roku[/color]: [color=#00FF7F]-\r<br />1) Due to capacity limit on the amount of paints RaceMenu can be scripted, I split the mod up. CBBE and UNP is listed under file description. Male characters should use UNP since that is a type closer to vanilla.\r<br />2) 3 Themes added: RealFaery, RealMagic, Vine.\r<br />\r<br />RealFaery & RealMagic include tats that are more realistic looking, placement, and size. RealMagic is masculine while RealFaery is feminine. Both could be used for either gender though.\r<br />\r<br />Vine includes Sleeve tats. This theme resembles the Irish theme due to vines being about the only thing that can pull off full sleeves/body tats seamlessly. Vine theme has been broken up into multiple tats for picking and choosing. Vine includes Face and Hand tats as well.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]Version Go[/color]: [color=#00FF7F]-\r<br />1) Configured key tats for UNP body proportions. Tattoos with the &#34;UNP&#34; at the end of name are those that have been realigned to fit better for UNP bodies. (Example:: DesuIrishBellyUNP)\r<br />All other tattoos need no adjusting for UNP and look good as is.\r<br />2) DesuAD package contains Angels and Demons themed tattoos.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]Version Yon[/color]: [color=#00FF7F]- Following tattoo packages added:\r<br />1) DesuDay package focuses on Face / Warpaint tattoos inspired by Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead).\r<br />2) DesuTribal package adds more body and feet tattoos. DesuTribal package are my answer for the more masculine tattoos that have been asked for. These tattoos can be used by both genders, easily.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]Version San[/color]: [color=#00FF7F]- Following issues fixed:\r<br />1) Feet tats placed in Feet Paints menu ... YES&#33; They are now&#33;\r<br />New Tattoos added::\r<br />1) 2 Face / Warpaints added - \r<br />- DesuDayMask = A full face tribute mask to Day of the Dead.\r<br />- DesuFacePowder = A full face overlay that can be colored any way. (White/Off White is preferred for DesuDay tats.)[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]Version Ni.Fixed[/color]: [color=#00FF7F]- Following issues fixed:\r<br />1) NMM showing version as Ichi addressed. NMM should now show Ni.Fixed as current version.\r<br />2) Feet tats still being located in Body Paints menu. Feet tats are NOW properly placed in Feet Paints menu.\r<br />3) Feet tats making character body blue. Fixed when above was corrected.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]Version Ni[/color]: [color=#00FF7F]- Corrected Alpha coloring so tattoos should appear black when set to black, not grey.\r<br />- Relocated Feet tattoos. Feet Tattoos are now properly under the Feet Paints menu in RaceMenu.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFD700]Version Ichi[/color]: [color=#00FF7F]Released&#33; Crossing fingers for no problems&#33;[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-5.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/35677-2-1378109854.jpg[/img]\r<br />**7\r<br />[size=4][color=#ADD8E6]\r<br />       The Coenaculi applies it&#39;s tats as Overlays, so the tats themselves will never change in position and can never be augmented (stretched, rotated, etc.) but, the body can be. With every body mod, the msn file and Meshes are tweaked to meet the desires of the author. There&#39;s also the Caliente Body Slide which allows you to tweak the Meshes to achieve a nearly unlimited amount of different body physics.\r<br />\r<br />   With that being said, some tattoos may appear warped or incorrect once applied. This is because the body you have set up may have excess or missing curves in a specific area where the tattoo goes. It is impossible to take into consideration every body option available and create my tattoos to fit them. So I&#39;ve placed my tats for a more align position, such as belly tats that go around the belly button. It is also due to this reason that I have never released a full body tat to be downloaded because that would force everyone to use the EXACT body that I use.\r<br />\r<br />   So before you go screaming and complaining to me on my comments that my tattoos suck because they look weird, take this into consideration first.[/color][/size]\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/35677-3-1378109854.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#a4c2f4]How to add more tattoo options:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=#3CB371]Skyrim Data Folder &gt; SKSE &gt; Plugins &gt; Nioverride.ini [/color](Use Notebook to open or a similar program.)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Once opened you&#39;ll see the following::\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][Overlays]\r<br />bPlayerOnly=1 ; Applies to only the player, or all humanoid actors NOT RECOMMENDED changing this, you can add overlays to certain actors via script\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FF7F][Overlays/Body][/color]\r<br />[color=#4682B4]iNumOverlays=20[/color] ; Determines how many overlays to add to an Actor NodeName &#34;Body [Ovl#]&#34; where # is the layer number, 0 being the bottom\r<br />iSpellOverlays=1 ; Determines how many spell overlay layers to add (Topmost layer &#34;Body [SOvl#]&#34;)\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Okay, it looks confusing if you&#39;re not familiar with ini/config files, but it&#39;s easy. Look for &#34;[color=#00FF7F][Overlays/Body][/color]&#34; and below that you&#39;ll see [color=#4682B4]iNumOverlays=6[/color]. As you can see from the above, mine is set to 20. This number is how many tattoos are allowed on the body. Change it to whatever, but not too high. There is a limit. Refer to RaceMenu and/or CharGen mod pages for the limit.\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]Q: Will one of your plugins work with &#34;this&#34; body and if it does, which one should I use?[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]A: Coenaculi will work on [b][i]EVERY[/i][/b] body ([u][i]see Possible Unwanted Outcomes above[/i][/u]). As for which plugin to use, you&#39;ll need to figure this out.\r<br />Take ADEC body for an example. The proportions and mapping are similar to CBBE&#39;s. So I would recommend using my CBBE plugin. If you are unsure, then download one and try in game. If you believe the tats are not aligned correctly, try a different plugin and see if it looks better. But, again, see [b][i][u]Possible Unwanted Outcomes[/u][/i][/b] above.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]Q: I&#39;ve installed all the latest versions, but some or all tattoos are not being shown.[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]A: This has been happening a lot since RaceMenu updated past 2.5.1. So far, what I&#39;ve been able to find, is that some RaceMenu plugins are not being updated. If you&#39;re using multiple plugins (Tat, Warpaint, etc mods), make sure that each mod is being updated. 1 plugin that isn&#39;t updated properly will cause problems with all plugins.\r<br />Many people now combine esp. If you do this with The Coenaculi and another RaceMenu Overlay mod, be sure that the other mod is updated.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]Q: Can I use both male and female versions?[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]A: Yes and No. If you wish to use 2, you will have to use them separately. For example: You want tats on your Male character so you download and install Coenaculi for Male. Once you&#39;ve applied your tats, you wish to put tats on that Female character you&#39;ve made. You&#39;ll have to download the appropriate type of Coenaculi, of course, but you&#39;ll also have to uninstall the Male type before installing the Female. You should ONLY HAVE 1 TYPE INSTALLED AT ANY TIME.\r<br />To further explain; your game shouldn&#39;t crash or become corupt if you do end up having both male and female versions installed. You&#39;ll simply have only the Male or Female tats show in your RM options is all. This is because I used the same name for each tats across all types of Coenaculi. I did this because the RaceMenu does have a soft cap on how many tats it will show in an option. I reached that cap on the earliest versions of Coenaculi, hence why I split the Coenaculi into 4 types.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]Q: Does your mod change my body texture?[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]A: No. It applies an overlay only. It&#39;s like putting a fake tattoo on your arm. If you don&#39;t like that tat, wash it off and your arm is back to normal.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]Q: Where did you get your hair color?[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]A: Did it myself. No, I can&#39;t make a mod for this. It&#39;s impossible.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]Q: Can I apply these tats to an NPC?[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]A: No.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]Q: I don&#39;t see the tabs where the tattoos were.[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]A: With each new RaceMenu version, the overlay/paints options may be moved. This is Expired&#39;s doing and not mine. Please DO NOT comment and bug me about not finding these options. Go to the RaceMenu mod page or investigate the menus in game. The options are there, you just have to find them&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]Q: I apply a tattoo, but nothing is showing, why?[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]A: Press “E” key to enter color options and move the bottom bar from the far left to the far right. For some reason, the default color may start out invisible.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]Q: When I type “showracemenu” my game freezes&#33; [/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]A: [s]This means you have too many assets loading and are overflowing the HeadPart cache. Go to RaceMenu and download the Optional File – DisableFaceGenCache.[/s]\r<br />You are running TOO MANY scripts and overloading your Papyrus. Try to refrain using the showracemenu command and do all your stuff during the character creation on a new game.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]Q: When I choose a tattoo, the entire body part turns a solid color.[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]A: This occurs when the script can’t find the file you’re trying to apply. This should not happen since everything is packed into a bsa file, but if it does: Uninstall The Coenaculi and then manually install it.\r<br />If the problem persists, please contact me and tell me which tattoo this occurs on.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]Q: I installed your mod and now my game keeps crashing&#33;[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]A: Wasn’t my mod…entirely. You’re probably loading too many things. Try cutting down on the amount of mods you use.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]Q: Is there a way to get more depth in the tattoos?[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]A: Unfortunately, RaceMenu requires I save the DDS files a specific way. This prevents me and the tattoos to show much depth and detail. I will be keeping this in mind for future tattoos so that I don’t add anymore textures, like flowers, that seem flat when they shouldn’t be.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEEB]An issue from a user, solved by the user :) :[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FF7F]Ok. I figure out the issue. I am not sure if you put this in the description. But I highly recommend you should. \r<br />\r<br />I was using my xbox one controller so I can access your tattoo mod. Y is for color and A is for Texture. \r<br />\r<br />The issue was, it was bringing the color pop up box instead of the tattoo box.\r<br />\r<br />So when I decided to change my controller to the keyboard&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />It worked&#33;&#33;&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />If a problem/issue you are having is not listed above, please leave me a Comment and submit a screenshot.
