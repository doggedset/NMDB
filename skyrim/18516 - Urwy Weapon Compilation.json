All carefully placed in leveled lists\r<br />3. Craftable and balanced\r<br />4. 1 Hand-placed enchanted weapon\r<br />\r<br />Weapon Summary:\r<br />Arakh (steel)-  An steel sickle with good damage.\r<br />Asuma Blade (elven)- A fast dagger held backwards (switchable to forward at the Skyforge for convenience).\r<br />Afterslash (steel)- A beautiful steel sword.\r<br />Assassin Sword (ebony)- A fast-swinging sword crafted from ebony and steel alloys.\r<br />Azura&#39;s Moon (daedric)- The weapon of acolytes of Azura. An ornate moon-shaped cross between dagger and axe tipped with soulgems in honor of the Lady of Twilight.\r<br />Ember Coil (ebony)- An ebony-inlaid steel sword with flaming elements fuel by fire salts.\r<br />Fleur De Lis (elven)- A light, ornate sword made with gold and moonstone.\r<br />Greyblade (ebony)- A powerful sword with gold accents.\r<br />Ice (dwarven)- a powerful two-hander with and dwarven metal handle.\r<br />Long Claw (steel)- The little brother to the Ember Coil, the ornate handle features a fire-breathing dragon.\r<br />Malacath&#39;s Cleaver (daedric)- The weapon of acolytes of Malacath. A large, powerful weapon with an Orchalium core and steel and ebony blade that makes it strong and heavy yet shard enough to split a hair. The name of The Price of the Spurned is carven in the blade and glows with his power.\r<br />Sword of Merlin (steel)- a strong, two-handed steel blade.\r<br />Orante Maul (elven&ebony)- to craft this great weapon, one must master both the elegance of moonstone and the density of ebony. The combination of these arts makes a weapon that rivals that of the gods.\r<br />Iron Pick (iron)- A simple but effective weapon that combines the speed of a sword with the cutting surface of an axe\r<br />Twisted Blade (steel)- A piercing head adorns the spiral handle in this light but strong blade.\r<br />Slipcleave (draugr)- By melting down a draugr sword, it is possible to combine ancient tradition with modern steel techniques. Rumor has it a few draugr themselves have gotten a hold of this interesting sword.\r<br />Serpentine Axe (steel)- A steel weapon with more surface area than your average axe. It looks cool and still bashes heads like a pro.\r<br />Spear Blade (steel)- A slim, sleek blade that swing even faster than the average sword.\r<br />Split Blade (steel)- A large sword that packs a punch, include a blade that goes from handle to tip.\r<br />\r<br />Bugs:\r<br />None known yet. I will update this section when some are reported.\r<br />\r<br />These were all modeled by [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12087]Urwy[/url] as a modder&#39;s resource but they never got a complete pack.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17515][img]http://i686.photobucket.com/albums/vv226/Oraln/SteamStaffButton.png[/img][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17279][img]http://i686.photobucket.com/albums/vv226/Oraln/DoubleHandAxeButton.png[/img][/url]",
