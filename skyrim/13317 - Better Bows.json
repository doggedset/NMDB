  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/13317-1-1335686306.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n- by Howiego08\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n[b]Overview[/b]\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nIntroducing Howiego08\\'s Better Bows - a set of beautifully crafted bows that (hopefully) do not look rediculous and out of place. My aim is to create new alternative bows based on the existing templates that Skyrim has to offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n[b]Description[/b]\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nAll bows can be found at the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun, sold by Ravn, the bowyer.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- [b]Mammoth Recurve Bow[/b] --\r\n\r\nA beautifully crafted mammoth tusk recurve bow with dragon scale reinforcing. Also includes a snow fox fur grip with golden stitching, gold & silver wiring, and dragon gut & sinew bowstring. The Mammoth Recurve requires great strength to draw, making it ultimately slower but packing a powerful punch.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- [b]Colovian Composite Bow[/b] --\r\n\r\nThe design of the Colovian Composite Bow originates from the old region of Colovia - now a part of the Imperial province of Cyrodiil. Although ornate, the Colovian Composite bow is purpose made for suitability in both the highlands and forest and is simple to wield.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- [b]Valenwood War Bow[/b] --\r\n\r\nThe simple design of the war bow belies the incredible skill required to wield one. Although not quite matching the draw weight of a recurve, the war bow can still deliver hefty damage and also includes an extra kick.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- [b]Elven Hawk Bow[/b] --\r\n\r\nThe Elven Bow perfected - the Hawk Bow is the perfection of the bowyer trade, as only Elven artisans know how.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- [b]Ornate Khajiit Bow[/b] --\r\n\r\nThe Khajiit Bow is a suprisingly able weapon from a race not known for their weapon craft. The original Khajiit bow, \\\"Thi-khaj\\\" or \\\"Wind of the Desert\\\", was presented 850 years ago by the Ohmes cheiftan, Ri\\'Shalat, to the young J\\'Vinsahy (later Do\\'Vinsahy), after he hunted down three Bosmer raiders and slew them with a crude self-made bow.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- [b]Orsimer Chieftan Bow[/b] --\r\n\r\nA bow fit for am Orcish Chieftan. Despite their rough appearance, the Orsimer produce fine smiths who take pride in their craftsmanship.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nI strongly advise using Nexus Mod Manager (NMM) for all Skyrim mods - it is very simple to use and has some handy features.\r\n\r\nFor manual installation - \r\n\r\nExtract all files to: \r\n\r\nskyrim\\\\data\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n[b]Uninstallation[/b]\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nDelete the following files & directories:\r\n\r\nData\\\\HBetterBows.esp\r\nData\\\\HBetterBows.bsa\r\nData\\\\Meshes\\\\weapons\\\\HBetterBows\r\nData\\\\Textures\\\\weapons\\\\HBetterBows\r\nData\\\\Textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\FaceGenData\\\\Face Tint\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n[b]A note from the author...[/b]\r\n------------------------------\r\nSome of you have probably guessed that I am no longer actively working on this mod. I am happy with the work I have done and am extremely pleased that so many people appreciate it too. \r\n\r\nIf you would like to use my mod, or components of it in any way, feel free. All I ask is that you give credit to me for the creation of the textures, as they are my pride and joy.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nHowiego08",
