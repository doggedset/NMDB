  "summary": "Adds a dialogue option to the Old Orc to recruit him as a follower.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a persuade dialogue option to the [url=http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Old_Orc]Old Orc[/url] (the one you encounter along the road and is looking for a Good Death) to recruit him a s follower, so he can find a good death when he joins you on your travels.\r<br />\r<br />Unfortunately, I was unable to test this currently, as my current PC is a bit of a mess and bluescreens when I play Skyrim or any other game for longer than 15 minutes. As a result, this file is [b]highly experimental[/b], and may or may not work. \r<br />\r<br />I also had to use some workarounds, as the &#34;Old Orc&#34; uses a leveled NPC list and therefor cannot get the unique flag, nor a relationship rank with the player. These will be reset to 0, when a game is loaded, \r<br />but at least a rank of 1 is needed to become a follower. So I used a script on game load, which sets the relationshiprank correct again.\r<br />\r<br />Permissions: \r<br />\r<br />This mod is shared with a WML 1.0 Cathedral License.\r<br />You are free to :\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Redistribute this work in unmodified form.\r<br />[*]Include this resource within another work\r<br />[*]Modify and redistribute this work\r<br />[/list]So long as you:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Give the author(s) credit.\r<br />[*]link back to this page.\r<br />[*]distribute your mod under the same license.\r<br />[/list]Translations are allowed under the same terms.\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />\r<br />- skyrimmods subreddit: for giving me ideas\r<br />- Bethesda Softworks: for Skyrim and the ability to mod it\r<br />- the entire modding community: for being awesome&#33; &lt;3",
