  "descriptionHtml": "Tired of being bad mouthed by tiresome brats when you report in after a long day slaughtering rebels, raising undead, and conversing with dragons? Then this spell is for you! Marked harmless, so not even chickens will object.\r\nOffending brats are humanely eliminated from your path by detention in an attractively colourful playpen (blue for boys, pink for girls). Should you later relent, the playpen can be unlocked, and will then disappear.\r\nThe \\\"Playpen of Doleful Detention\\\" spell is taught by a skill book called \\\"Sparing the Rod\\\". This is located on a bookshelf in the Whiterun jarl\\'s quarters (top floor). You will have to steal the book.\r\n",
