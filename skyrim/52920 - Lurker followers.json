I placed them there so you can find them easily without needing to go somewhere like Apocrypha.\r<br />When I learn more about using the creation kit I might make a black book which will lead into another part of Apocrypha and I&#39;ll place them at the end of the area as a reward.\r<br />\r<br />The only difference about them is their names.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements-\r<br />Skyrim\r<br />Patch  1.9\r<br />Dawnguard \r<br />Dragonborn\r<br />\r<br />I was going to make Vampire Lords too but I changed my mind after making the Lurkers. If I do end up making my own quest thingy I will use some Dawnguard stuff so the Dawnguard requirement isn&#39;t pointless. I just need to find some good YouTube tutorials for creating places.",
