  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4] REQUIRES DRAGON BORN DLC [/size]\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v738/bl3azy/DragonBornRobesMainDescription_zps42642cc7.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[size=4] DESCRIPTION [/size]\r\n\r\nDragon Born Robes, my first stab at making armor/clothing, which I now love, and hopefully you do too. It is a standalone robe set, complete with male and female meshes and boots. weight slider friendly (I think?), and currently it is enchanted with the same enchantment as the \\\"Tevanni Robes\\\" from which they derived from. If requested, I guess I could make un-enchanted versions as well. For the robes, you can forge them with 2 GlowDust, 3 Common Soul Gems, and 2 NetchLeathers(New from the dragonborn DLC). Elven Smithing is also required. Now if you don\\'t want to smith them and you just want to get your grubby hands on them as soon as possible, there is a chest somewhere on the island, but it is not too hard to find, I do believe.\r\n\r\n[size=4] UPDATE [/size]\r\n\r\n1. Customized The chest to really stand out, so you\\'ll KNOW you\\'ve found it.\r\n\r\n2. Added Un-Enchanted Versions. (Finally)\r\n\r\n[size=4] WHATS TO COME? [/size]\r\n\r\nIn the process of creating HD versions as well.\r\n\r\nIf requested, and popular enough, I MAY be convinced of making different color variations, maybe even have different enchantments correlating to the color of said robe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4] INSTALLATION [/size]\r\n\r\n1.Throw those ESP and BSA\\'s as HARD as you can into your Skyrim Data Folder.\r\n2. SMASH the check box next to the ESP in your Skyrim launcher.\r\n3. Violently Start up Skyrim.\r\n4. Aggressively Look for the ingredients and your nearest smithing forge. Or Mannishly search for the elusive chest and BREAK it open to obtain its sweet treasures.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
