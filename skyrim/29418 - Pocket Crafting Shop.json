It also contains access to player owned storage chests that are stored underground and can be accessed by equipping a token in your Armor inventory.\r\n\r\nThis is the latest iteration in the \\\"Pocket\\\" series of mods. It is a combination of 2 \r\nprevious mods: Pocket Smithy, & Pocket Magecraft. \r\n\r\nPocket Crafting Shop is activated by equipping the [Pocket Crafting] token in your inventory \r\nArmor section. Once equipped, the crafting tools will be summoned around you. On the 1st use, you will also receive the [Open Pocket Crafting Storage] token. This will enable you to \r\naccess hidden storage containers that are player owned and non-respawning. \r\n\r\nThe room where the storage chests are kept is now accessible by an external trapdoor or by \r\nusing the included [Pocket Crafting Storage Teleport], which will be added to your inventory \r\napparel section after the 1st use of [Pocket Crafting].\r\n\r\nThe storage room also contains a Trash Barrel where you can deposit your unwanted items. \r\nItems placed in the barrel will be deleted after 24 hrs. of game time. Any time you add to \r\nthe barrel, the timer gets reset. When you close the barrel, you will have the option of \r\n\\\"Empty Trash Now\\\" or \\\"Reset 24 hr. Timer\\\". So, if you have items in the barrel already and \r\nyou open it put more items in, the timer will be reset, but if you close it without placing \r\nitems in, the timer keeps going as before.\r\n\r\nWhen the [Pocket Crafting] token is equipped, the following crafting apparatus (apparatii, \r\napparatuses?) will be summoned:\r\n\r\n• Arcane Enchanting Table\r\n• Alchemy Crafting Table\r\n• Anvil\r\n• Grinding Wheel\r\n• Armor Crafting Bench\r\n• Tanning Rack\r\n• Mini Smelter - One-Third size & fully functional.\r\n• Wood Chopping Block (w/ axe) \r\n[line]\r\n[u][center][size=5][color=Black]HOW TO GET IT[/color][/size][/center][/u] \r\nAfter installing, the next time you launch your game you will be given the choices of \\\"Get It \r\nNow\\\", \\\"Purchase It From a Vendor\\\" or \\\"Craft It At the Forge\\\". Once you have the [Pocket \r\nCrafting] token, it will be in your Armor inventory near or at the top. Just equip it and the \r\nitems will be summoned. To put it back into inventory, just unequip it.\r\n\r\nAfter acquiring [Pocket Crafting], the first time you use it, the [Open Pocket Crafting \r\nStorage] token will be added to your inventory automatically. This will allow you to remotely \r\nopen any of the 5 storage containers without summoning them.\r\n\r\nThe containers are named as \\\"Ingot & Ore Storage\\\", \\\"Potion & Ingredient Storage\\\", and so on, \r\nbut you can store anything in any of them. I just labeled them for convenience. I also threw \r\nsome swag in them just for fun.\r\n[line]\r\n[u][center][size=5][color=Black]History[/color][/size][/center][/u] \r\n7.20.12 -- v1.03 -- Added entrance to storage area; added Storage Teleport to go directly to \r\nthe storage area from any outside location. The Pocket Crafting now is equipped to summon \r\ncrafting gear, then equipped again to send it away. It will automatically unequip after being \r\nused. Placed more labeled storage chests including a Trash Barrel. The Trash Barrel auto-\r\nempties after 24hrs of game time. You can also empty it right away.\r\n\r\n7.17.12 -- v.008 -- Several tweaks and code fixes. \r\n[line]\r\n[u][center][size=5][color=Black]Contact[/color][/size][/center][/u] \r\nNexus: cmosbob \r\n[line]\r\n[u][center][size=5][color=Black]Credits[/color][/size][/center][/u] \r\nSplynter created the mod, I just uploaded it to Nexus.\r\n[line]\r\n[u][center][size=5][color=Black]Manual installation[/color][/size][/center][/u] \r\nUnarchive to desktop, and drag the contents of the data folder to your ...\\\\skyrim\\\\data \r\nfolder. \r\n[line]\r\n[u][center][size=5][color=Black]Manual Uninstallation[/color][/size][/center][/u] \r\nDelete the files _pocketcraftshop.bsa and _pocketcraftshop.esp.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to uninstall, be sure you take everything out of the containers first so you \r\ndon\\'t loose them. If you forget to do so, and if you want your stuff back, you\\'ll need to re-\r\ninstall and load a save from a time before you unsubscribed. \r\n[line]\r\n[u][center][size=5][color=Black]Legal and Licensing[/color][/size][/center][/u] \r\nYou may use the content as you please, as long as Splynter is given credit for his work.\r\n\r\n(Quote from original SteamWorkshop Mod Page:\r\n\r\nPERMISSIONS\r\n*******************\r\nAnyone who wishes to upload to another site, modify the scripts, or basically make any \r\nchanges may do so as long as proper credit is given. I just do this for fun and to keep my \r\nmind working while I\\'m unemployed, so I\\'m not going to be too anal about other people using \r\nand/or expanding on my original code.) \r\n[line]\r\n",
