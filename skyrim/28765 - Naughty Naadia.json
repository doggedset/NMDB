  "summary": "Lvl 25, found in Breezehome. Combat Assassin Spec. Set up to be your follower via interaction, marriageable. Pretty aggressive traits, may cause issues. I fixed the ones i had. Starts with fancy duds, give whatever armors/weapons you like.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first toon mod. I cleaned with TES5, no errors there. Might be a little buggy, was alt+tabbing from CK NPC How-To and CK itself. She is Wood Elf, Combat Assassin Spec, starting level 25, and will auto level with you, cap at 125 (if you have mods for that) Feel free to take and change whatever you want. IDC if you put it on steam or redo yourself. Just want to share and try my hand at followers.\r\n\r\nRequired Files:\r\nApachii SkyHair v1.5\r\n\r\nRecommended FIles:\r\nADEC body mod\r\nBetter Females by Bella (your preferences, not mine)\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to thank Bethesda for their game, and all of the people from the Nexus for making such great additional content that makes this game amazing!",
