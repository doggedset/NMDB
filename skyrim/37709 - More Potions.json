  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r\n===========\r\nThis mod adds new potions and poisons with interesting and varied magical effects.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nIn this version, the potions are only obtainable via console. Future updates will add them to levelled lists, and a Bashed Patch will be required for compatibility.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\n\r\nPoisons:\r\nFire Damage\r\nFrost Damage\r\nShock Damage\r\nDisarm\r\nSilver Damage\r\nBanish\r\nWeapon Slow\r\n\r\nPotions:\r\nDetect Life\r\nAether (Become Ethereal)\r\nFire Cloak\r\nFrost Cloak\r\nShock Cloak\r\nLight\r\nMuffle\r\nNighteye\r\nSlow Time\r\nFlurry (Weapon Speed)\r\nFortify Unarmed\r\nSpell Absorption\r\nArmour Rating (Alteration Flesh Spells)\r\nReflect Blows\r\nResist Damage\r\n\r\nFuture Plans\r\n==========\r\nLevelled Lists Integration - Merchants and loot.\r\nCrafting Recipes - Not all effects are suited to the continuous nature of user created potions, so I have considered recipes such as Poison + Fire Salts = Fire Poison.\r\nNew Effects - Some of my ideas had to be scrapped for the first release, so hopefully I\\'ll be able to fix them for a later update. These ideas include contextual poisons, which will offer bonus effects on certain types of enemy, or on an enemy under a certain status effect. Simple contextual poisons are already in the mod, for example the Banish poisons work better on summoned Daedra, i.e. affect those of a higher level.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\nThe mod can be installed manually or using the mod manager of your choice. \r\nAs always, remember to rebuild any patch mods you may use after adding any mod to your load order.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\nUninstalling mods is not officially supported for Skyrim. However, this mod should be relatively safe to uninstall, if you so choose. Simply delete the files, or uninstall using your chosen mod manager.\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n=======\r\nThis is the first version, so this section is a placeholder for now.\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nThis mod does not make any changes to vanilla objects, as all new objects are added. As such, there should be no hard incompatibilities. \r\nIt may not work as intended with some mods which alter Alchemy or potions, if you come across any such issues, please let me know in the comments section.\r\n\r\nLoad Order\r\n==========\r\nThere should be no issues with load order, as the mod does not overwrite any objects, and no mod will overwrite my new additions. However, as always you should use BOSS to help sort your load order.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nIt seems the undead are immune to most of my poisons. I have yet to come up with a workaround.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0, 2013/06/28 - Initial release.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nYou can find me on the official Elder Scrolls forums and Nexus as \\'evilgiraffe\\'\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating TES and the CK.\r\nThanks to Nexus for everything.\r\nThanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was (loosely!) based on.\r\n\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\n7-Zip \r\nReadme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r\nTES5Edit\r\nCreation Kit\r\n\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nYou must contact me and obtain my permission before re-packaging any part of\r\nthis mod. If I do not respond within 6 weeks, feel free to do whatever you\r\nlike with this mod.",
