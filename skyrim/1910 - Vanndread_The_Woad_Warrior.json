  "descriptionHtml": "This is my Imperial, he is my 3rd character so far, a powerful skirmisher wielding the legendary sword Dawnbringer. Wielding destruction and restoration magic adeptly, he can rush into battle mending his wounds as they open or soften his foes with traps and bolts of fire and ice. and has began to grasp the essence of stealth and illusion, lots of fun. He comes with the Black Star and Azuras star for all your enchanting needs. And has read all the skill up books so he has fairly well rounded stats.\r\n\r\nI really enjoy playing him, he is my favorite so far,  Level 30, barely into any of the main quests, well, I may have slain Ulfric Stormcloak. At the perfect level to branch out and change focus for anyones style.\r\n\r\nHope you guys like him, its my first upload. I would improve him if someone could tell me how to showracemenu without resetting everything. If you play him add a screenshot later and share your adventures!",
