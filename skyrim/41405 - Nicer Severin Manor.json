  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=6][color=#F79646]Description:[/center][/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]&#34;You&#39;ve earned your citizenship here, and I hope you&#39;ll consider staying with us as a member of our community.&#34; Upon hearing these words I know that my hard work has payed off and I am no longer a stranger in Raven Rock. I happily head towards my new Dunmer house, remembering the good old Morrowind days when I walk past familiar looking buildings. I enter my new property only to find out that the proudly called &#34;manor&#34; is nothing more than a shabby and dark hut cluttered with hay, baskets and barrels. The gloomy dungeon tunes I hear inside successfully prevent me from feeling at home and I leave the place with disappointment. \r<br />Does this story sound familiar? Ever wanted to settle down in Raven Rock but the house&#39;s living standards prevented you from it? This mod fixes that for you, making Severin Manor a viable place to live in. It also removes Nordic influences and modifies the house so it looks more like a place Dunmers would live in. This mod comes with Dragonborn only and Dragonborn+Hearthfire versions. All esps have been cleaned with TES5Edit.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=6][color=#F79646]Features:[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[size=3][*]map marker to reach the house easily\r<br />[*]adjusted navmesh\r<br />[*]lore-friendly\r<br />[*]creepy dungeon music replaced by Solstheim explore music\r<br />[*]atmospheric light in every room - no more wandering in the dark&#33;\r<br />[*]vanilla lights in bedrooms are now dimmed, can&#39;t imagine anyone sleeping in brightly lit rooms like that\r<br />[*]almost every corner of the house (apart from one) has additional furniture and/or decorations to fill the empty spaces and make the place look cosier\r<br />[*]every Nordic chandelier and candle replaced by Dunmer lanterns and normal candles\r<br />[*]many new decorative items and custom containers with labels\r<br />[*]most of the added items are static (some vanilla baskets were also made static), so clumsy Dovahkiins don&#39;t need to worry  about objects getting misplaced all the time\r<br />[*]ugly pelts replaced by rugs\r<br />[*]removed the excessive amount of baskets, barrels and stacks of hay lying about and added furniture and candles in their stead\r<br />[*]the kitchen no longer looks like a barn but an actual kitchen\r<br />[*]Hearthfire oven, butter churn and containers for baked food and baking ingredients for DLC users\r<br />[*]mannequins were moved to the smithy -  bedroom should look more like a bedroom, not an armoury\r<br />[*]deleted one weapon rack that used to be in the smithy - after putting mannequins in there the place looked overcluttered with racks\r<br />[*]2 additional weapon plaques and 1 display case\r<br />[*]the storage corner in the main bedroom was turned into an office\r<br />[*]added activators to display cases in the master bedroom, also removed human skulls from one display case since some of  them were static, making it impossible to completely change the contents of the case ingame without using console commands\r<br />[*]added planters to make the house look more vibrant[/size][/list]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=6][color=#F79646]Requirements:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Skyrim patch 1.9.32.0.8\r<br />Dragonborn\r<br />(for HF esp only) Hearthfire[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=6][color=#F79646]Installation:[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />[size=3][u][b]IMPORTANT: Back up your save. You should always do it when installing new mods. Remove everything you put in the house before installing this mod. As some containers got deleted or replaced by different ones the items you kept in the old containers will be gone forever&#33;[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Extract the files and move bsa file and one of the esps to Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim/Data folder. Check the compatibility section if you have other mods installed to make sure your load order is fine. This mod was tested before and after entering Severin Manor and everything seemed to be in order but, like with other housing mods, it&#39;s always better to install it before entering it. \r<br />If for some reason items are not where they should be, exit the house, open the console (~ button), type &#34;pcb&#34;, press enter, then type &#34;resetinterior dlc2rrseverinhouse&#34;, enter some other building to get a new auto save, enter Severin Manor and check if everything is in order. If objects are still misplaced, load the autosave from the time you entered the other building and check Severin Manor&#39;s interior once more.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=6][color=#F79646]Compatibility:[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />[size=3]It IS compatible with Unofficial Dragonborn Patch. Just in case, I attached WIDeadBodyCleanupScript to Tilisu so my mod can be safely loaded after UDBP without overwriting the fix.\r<br />This mod IS compatible with RLO. If you use RLO, load this mod first. \r<br />It IS also compatible with Severin Manor Guard for Dragonborn DLC, however if you want to use both mods together, you&#39;ll also need to download the Dorethi Guard compatible esp along with one of the main files. All this esp does is remove one chair that was conflicting with Dorethi&#39;s chair. Download either DB only or DB+HF version depending on which DLCs you use. Load this mod after the Guard addon.\r<br />It&#39;s NOT compatible with mods that change the interior of Severin Manor.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=6][color=#F79646]Known Issues:[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />[size=3]1a. The middle display case in the master bedroom is a little finicky even though I set everything up properly. If you don&#39;t intend to utilise it and decide to keep its original contents you don&#39;t need to worry about anything. If, however, you want to use it the activator won&#39;t work right away. It starts working properly if you remove everything from the display case, exit the house and reenter. \r<br />1b. Rarely, weapons might sink into the display cases when you put them inside the first time. To fix that, simply remove the weapons and put them back in and they will display properly.\r<br />2. Smelter might become invisible all of a sudden. I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s causing it, since the only thing I did in the room where it&#39;s located was add an ore bucket and light. If that happens, use the smelter (the activator remains visible) and it will show up again.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=6][color=#F79646]Notes:[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />[size=3]This is my first mod and I&#39;m not yet familiar with all of CK&#39;s options and tricks. As much as I&#39;d love to make the stairway better lit I think it&#39;s impossible to fix. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time trying to make it work but always ended up with flickering lights. If you have any suggestions and/or problems related to the mod please post them in the comments section.\r<br />Hope you enjoy my mod&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=6][color=#F79646]Permissions:[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />[size=3]This mod was made for Skyrim Nexus exclusively and is not to be hosted anywhere else.
