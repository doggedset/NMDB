Sometimes I wish you could actually marry a Khajiit.\r<br />\r<br />Depending what you&#39;re looking for, this mod might solve your problem.[/color]\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/59498-1-1414698002.jpg[/img]\r<br />Diverse Lydia: Customization for your first follower&#33;[/size][/color][color=#ffffff]\r<br />One of the wacky ideas that was floating around in my head was to use the Creation Kit to change NPCs. I&#39;d seen mods that did it, and wondered why nobody had done it more (I found out why later). For a test run, I turned Lydia into an Orsimer. I left most everything about her the same (voice, name, equipment, etc.) so that she was still the Lydia we know and love on the inside, but on the outside she was a gruff orc.\r<br />\r<br />Initially, I wasn&#39;t quite happy with the results, as she didn&#39;t look anything like Lydia. But that didn&#39;t stop me. I turned Lydia into an Argonian. Though I was horrified by the result, I&#39;m going to include it anyway (once I&#39;ve modified it).\r<br />\r<br />Eventually, by studying her makeup, hair style, hair color, skin color, mouth, eyes, nose, and other features, I managed to make diverse Lydias that still looked kind of like her. I&#39;ve now made a diverse Lydia for each non-human race (I found that the human races were too close to the original).[/color][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]Why so few Lydias?[/size][/color]\r<br />Well, troubles arose with mesh and texture files, and I discovered it was a lot harder to modify NPCs then I had originally thought. No matter what I did to her, Lydia always had the same skin color and makeup. If she was an orc, khajiit, dunmer, or whatever, her skin was the same. Eventually I figured out what I had to do and managed to make Khajiit, Dunmer, Orsimer, and Bosmer Lydias. But because of how much time this takes, I can&#39;t do any of the others just yet.\r<br />\r<br />But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll finish the rest soon.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]Installation[/size][/color]\r<br />There&#39;s nothing special about installation.
