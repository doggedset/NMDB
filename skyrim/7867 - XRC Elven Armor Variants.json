  "summary": "Fine Armor worn by the Thalmor Elite, the virtuous knights of the Aldmeri Dominion, and the Guardians of Summerset Isle (in my fictional world).  Standalone and Replacers available.  Standalone versions are also upgradeable at the workbench",
  "descriptionHtml": "Changed the name to make it a little shorter and hopefully less confusing so in the NMM page so you will be able to see which variant(s) you are installing.  I understand this has been confusing for some and I apologize\r\n\r\n5/20/12 UPDATE V1.4: There were 2 parts to this update: 1) the Golden Vanguard Armor was added as a standalone version and 2) the bug was fixed regarding the boots for the Aldmeri Guardian Armor not displaying properly in-game - thanks to Zaph72 for pointing this out.\r\n\r\n2/15/12 Update: Aldmeri Guardian Armor now fixed and should display properly at the forge, workbench, and most importantly, on your body.  Thank you Misterbeard for pointing out this HUGE mistake on my part.\r\n\r\n\r\n2/10/12 UPDATE: ALDMERI GUARDIAN ARMOR NOW STANDALONE AND UPGRADEABLE!\r\n\r\n2/10/12 Update:  THALMOR INQUISITOR ARMOR STANDALONE AND UPGRADEABLE and the world models for the armor pieces now display properly in the forge and workbench menus as well as in your inventory and on the ground/shelves, etc. \r\n\r\n2/10/12 UPDATE: vanilla elven armor and shield at 4k added\r\n\r\nThe upgrade materials were incorrect for several of the items in the inquisitor set and that has been fixed so everything requires moonstone except the cuirass which requires quicksilver\r\n\r\n2/9/12 Update: Golden Vanguard Armor set now available.  Can be used as a replacer or along with the Inquisitor Standalone to give your vanilla elven armor a nice makeover!\r\n\r\n2/8/12 Update:  Standalone is now upgradeable at the workbench!\r\n\r\nThese are a set of alternative textures for the elven armor.  All parts of the set have new textures as well as new normal maps.  The Thalmor version (black and gold) has a standalone version available.  Currently the Guardian Armor (silver and gold) is only available as a replacer.  If there is any demand I will convert it to a standalone as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a 4k and a 2k version available for the black and gold.\r\nSilver and gold is only 2k.  If people request I will upload a 4k as well.   \r\n\r\nIn the Standalone version, you can craft the following items at the forge, under the \\\"elven\\\" category:\r\n\r\nThalmor Inquisitor Cuirass\r\nThalmor Inquisitor Gauntlets\r\nThalmor Inquisitor Helmet\r\nThalmor Inquisitor Boots\r\nThalmor Inquisitor Shield\r\n\r\nYou only need the \\\"Elven Smithing Perk\\\" to forge the armor.\r\n\r\nAt present, the Cuirass, gauntlets, boots, and shield will appear correctly in the forge menu with the correct textures.  The helmet will still look like the vanilla helmet.  This applies at the workbench as well  I haven\\'t found a workaround for this yet.  If anyone who reads this knows of one let me know.  The cuirass may be a bit annoying because it blocks part of the menu text.  When you put it on though it will look nice ;)\r\n\r\nAt present, the materials needed and armor ranking are the same as vanilla elven armor.  The cuirass has the stats of the Elven Gilded Armor.\r\n\r\nAs I add other variants, it will become more clear to me what the different material requirements for each should be, and the armors will also have a range of protection and weight values.  I am open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nThis armor should be BEAST RACE FRIENDLY though I can\\'t guarantee because I haven\\'t tested it.  I set it up so it would be but if someone tests it on their beast character I would appreciate any feedback on whether there are any problems or not. \r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\n\r\n1) STANDALONE VERSION:  For easiest installation, just use Nexus Mod Manager.  If using NMM, then be sure to go under the Plugins section and click the .esp \\\"Thalmor Inquisitor Armor Standalone\\\"\r\n\r\nIf performing a manual installation, just drop the \\\"data\\\" folder into your Skyrim  folder and choose to merge data folders. Then make sure you have the esp activated through whatever launcher you are using.  \r\n\r\n\r\n1) REPLACER VERSION:\r\nFor the replacer versions, either use Nexus Mod Manager or do a manual install.  If not using NMM, then just drop the \\\"data\\\" folder into your Skyrim directory and choose to merge folder.  \r\n\r\nEach piece of armor has both the main texture as well as the normal map along with it.\r\n\r\nThe files should be in the correct path as packaged.  For the male armor including gauntlets, helmet, cuirass, and boots, the path is:\r\n\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Armor\\\\Elven\\\\m\\\\\r\n\r\nFor the female armor, the only different texture is the cuirass and the path for those (cuirass.dds and cuirass_n.dds) is:\r\n\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\elven\\\\f\\\\\r\n\r\nThe shield (elvenshield_d.dds and elvenshield_n.dds) goes under the weapons category:\r\n\r\nSkyrim\\\\data\\\\textures\\\\weapons\\\\elven\\\\shield\\\\\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION:\r\n1) deactivate using NMM, and make sure the esp is not checked under the Plugins section if using the standalone version\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n2) Manually - if using the replacer version and you don\\'t have any other elven texture mods, then delete the \\\"elven\\\" folders in data\\\\textures\\\\weapons and in data\\\\textures\\\\armor.  If somehow you are using another elven texture mod then delete each file one by one so you don\\'t lose your other mods.\r\n\r\nManual uninstallation of Standalone version: delete the .esp from your \\\"data\\\" folder, and delete \\\"inquisitor\\\" folders from data\\\\meshes\\\\ and data\\\\textures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI credit Aedh for his save game upload as I used this character for some screenshots and to test the female version since I didn\\'t have one of my own\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/search.php\r\n\r\nI credit Bellyache for introducing me to photoshop and for helpful texturing tips. If you haven\\'t seen Bellyache\\'s work then what\\'s wrong with you?\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/search.php\r\n\r\nand of course Bethesda \r\n",
