  "summary": "A small player home located on one of Skyrims many snowy mountains.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my attempt at a small home in the mountains.  Located in the southernmost area of The Rift, between Avanchnzel and Largashbur. (See images for Map).\r\n\r\nThe outside of the home contains all blacksmithing needs - Forge, Leather station, Armour table, grind stone and smelter. Including a place to store ore, spare gems etc. A small pond is full with fish, as well as a little hut to store them. A balcony like area can be reached using the stairs where a mill and woodcutting needs can be met (with one hell of a view if I do say so myself!). \r\n\r\nInside the home is a Kitchen, Alchemy area, Bedroom, a \\\"Study\\\" of sorts on the top level with bookshelves and enchanting facilities. A mini armory is located downstairs which leads into the bedroom. \r\n\r\nI could describe it in detail but it\\'d just be easier for you to look at the images, I will say that I built this to be cozy and small, as I dislike running around large houses looking for everything.\r\n\r\nNo known conflicts with other mods, however my game isn\\'t heavily modded so who knows?\r\n\r\nRequires Skyrim, dawnguard, hearthfire and dragonborn.",
