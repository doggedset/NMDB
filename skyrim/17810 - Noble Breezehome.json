  "descriptionHtml": "Noble Breezehome v1.02 - Final\r\n\r\nNew replacer will replace vanilla cell, all other versions are still available.\r\n\r\nNoble Breezehome v1.01\r\n\r\nHello every one, E2B2’s wife here!  You will find two different files in this update.  The first will replace the vanilla Breezehome, the second will leave the vanilla as is and add a stand alone Breezehome located behind Belethors Goods.  I’ve spent the week trying to address the quirks that came to light and aside from the lighting I feel confident.  Lighting seems to be my nemesis but considering this is only my second mod for any game ever, and I didn’t know the tall ugly thing was the computer when I met my husband, I’m happy.  If any one has some ideas on how to fix the lighting PLEASE share them!\r\n\r\nNoble Breezehome v1\r\n\r\nAnother house mod by my wife. She was so happy to get her first house reward fit for a Thane. Only to find it fit for a bum, sorry Brenium.\r\nEnter the CK.\r\nShe has redone most of the interior, changed the walls, removed that hideous trip, fall and burn alive fire pit right as you enter. Added more storage, mannequin, a few shrines, enchanter, extended the master bedroom, patched the roof, and just more detail here and there. It is fully navmeshed for Followers.\r\n\r\nAll changes are NOT upgrade dependent, so you get it all right when you are rewarded *cough* and get the key.\r\n\r\nAnother note this new Breezehome is in its own unique cell, so the original Breezehome stays intact, just not accessible by the door. The door points to this new cell.\r\nSo this will NOT interfere with or be effected by other Breezehome mods, and is safe to install / uninstall without effecting the Vanilla Breezehome and possibly messing it up.\r\n\r\nPossible bugs:\r\nReplacer will spawn another Lydia.\r\nLighting bugs where objects are black, or lighting will change at different camera angles.\r\n\r\nVisual Mods in use as in screen shots.\r\n\r\nWe use Sexy Whiterun v3 by horrorview\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7059\r\n\r\nAlso we use FXAA Post Process Injector by some_dude v2.1 Manual Install Option 3\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=131\r\nOr it was FXAA Vanilla Enhanced by jellinn v1.1\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=384\r\nAlthough that is unconfirmed because we\\'ve tried about 3 different ones, and my only file is my own zip named \\\"My FXAA\\\"\r\n\r\nAnother one is No Bloom -Fix Eye Adjusting- by PhilBro\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12314\r\n\r\nLastly is Colorful Lights - No Shadows - More FPS by TRoaches\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10789 ",
