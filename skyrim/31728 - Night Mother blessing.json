  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will give you ability to become completely invisible during sneaking.\r\nAnd if i say COMPLETELY, thats what i mean.\r\nThis ability have same effect as Nightingale Shadow power, but it will never ends if you touch something, or transfere into another location.\r\nAs i said - you will be COMPLETELY invisible.\r\n\r\nAlso this mod will give you power to locate ANY creature around you. Human or undead, no matter. Also it have friend or foe indicator, wich is very useful.\r\n\r\nInvisibility is passive ability. Which means that you dont need to cast it again and again. It will work since you add this spell to your character.\r\n\r\nHunter vision is more traditional. It works like shout or powers. Look in Talents menu for spell.\r\n\r\nBoth those powers are overpowered, so use it on your own game expirience.\r\n\r\nBooks with this spells are located on a table in a test zone (type coc QASmoke)\r\n",
