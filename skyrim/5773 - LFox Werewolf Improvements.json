Version History\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nv1.21\r\n- Added back in the totem changes and modified them slightly for\r\nDawnguard.\r\n\r\nv1.20\r\n- Magic Resistance now scales up slowly with level.\r\n- Tweaked DG vanilla claw scaling to be higher on lower levels.\r\n- Shifted DG vanilla health/stamina to slowly scale on levels\r\ninstead of being a one time big bonus.\r\n\r\nv1.10\r\n- Silver Weapons do twice as much damage to the player (uses\r\nthe silver keyword allowing it to function with mod added weapons).\r\n- Werewolf abilities now auto update no more console commands.\r\n- Added a boon of +50 carry weight to human form.\r\n- Added player to werewolf faction.\r\n- Added Detect life spell to human form.\r\n- Summoned wolves now scale with the players level.\r\n- Summoned wolves now last 3 minutes up from 1 minute.\r\n- Removed rest penalty for werewolves.\r\n- Removed bleed effect from power attacks for now.\r\n\r\nv1.09\r\n- Werewolves can now feed on NPCs and anything classed as an animal.\r\n- Werewolf standing power attacks that throw people off their\r\nfeet will now apply a small bleed attack.\r\n\r\nv1.08\r\n- Overhauled werewolf form stats so they scale in level.  Low\r\nlevel werewolves will have higher damage but less survivability\r\nthan before.  Level 50+ stats untouched.  Wild werewolves will\r\nnow be much weaker than before.\r\n- Increased human form unarmed damage from 15 to 40 and tweaked\r\nwerewolf form damage to compensate.  You MUST update the human\r\nform spell or your damage will drop drastically.\r\n\r\nv1.07\r\n- Modified the detect life howl to have detect life, fear and\r\nnight eye effects.\r\n\r\nv1.06\r\n- Modified the summon wolves howl to have all 3 werewolf howls.\r\n- Removed the cooldown on the summon wolves howl.\r\n\r\nv1.05\r\n- Werewolves are seriously scary now.  When transforming npcs up\r\nto level 25 within 100 yards will be feared for 5 seconds.  Does\r\nnot work on Silver Hand members.\r\n\r\nv1.04\r\n- Werewolf damage resistance has been patched i was basing the\r\nvalue on percentages when it was actual armor rating numbers.\r\nYou should notice a MASSIVE difference from before.\r\n\r\nv1.03\r\n- Removed the level increase to the fear howl it\\'s now the\r\n  default level 25 again.  Sorry that was wayyyy too overpowered.\r\n- Increased stamina gain in werewolf form to 200 from 100 to\r\n  help non fighter characters.\r\n- Fixed the human form active effect so it displays 50% health\r\n  regeneration as it should.\r\n\r\nv1.02\r\n- Human form health regeneration reduced to 50%.  Werewolf form\r\n  tweaked to remain the same.\r\n\r\nv1.01\r\n- Werewolf form health regeneration is now 200% instead of 300%.\r\n  It was stacking with the human form ability, the beast version\r\n  has been lowered to take that into account.\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n- Many innocent civilians and guards were slaughtered in the\r\n  making of this mod.",
