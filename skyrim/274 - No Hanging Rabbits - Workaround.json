  "descriptionHtml": "This simply changes the meshes and textures for the suspended meat rabbit to the ones used for the pheasant. It does not actually change the container from a rabbit and so you can still harvest rabbit meat for recipes.\r\n\r\nI have pet rabbits and was bothered by seeing rabbits hanging from hooks all over Skyrim. I realize people eat rabbits, no problem with that here. I just find it distracting to see a half dozen rabbits or more hanging from most of the ceilings in the game.\r\n\r\nTo install extract to your Skyrim\\\\Data folder.\r\n",
