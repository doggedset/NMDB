  "descriptionHtml": "Hello everyone&#33; This is my first released mod&#33; I&#39;ve used the Creation Kit (and Construction set in Oblivion) in the past, but I mostly just messed around. About a week ago, however, I decided that I really wanted to make a legitimate, release-worthy mod, and so this was born.\r<br />\r<br />The Landscape: It&#39;s just a few islands, and the waters aren&#39;t filled with much. Also includes one small cave and a decently sized dungeon-style cave.\r<br />\r<br />How to get there: I&#39;ve added a trapdoor to the boat in Dawnstar, simply enter it and you&#39;ll end up on the islands.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy, and make sure to give me some criticism&#33; I know the mod isn&#39;t even close to perfect, and, in comparison to a LOT of mods on here, it&#39;s not that great. :)\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />&#34;Resources for modders&#34; by Runspect\r<br />&#34;Hoddminir&#39;s Modders Resources&#34;\r<br />&#34;Tamira&#39;s Plant Resources&#34; by Tamira\r<br />&#34;tiger retexture and skin&#34; by muppetpuppet\r<br />\r<br />Music Credits\r<br />Summer Day - Kevin Macleod\r<br />Easy Lemon - Kevin Macleod",
