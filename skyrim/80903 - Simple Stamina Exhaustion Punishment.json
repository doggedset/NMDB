You can still walk, though.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][color=#ff7700][size=4][u][b]Long Description\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u][/size][/color][size=3]Like most of Skyrim players, I&#39;ve been going for immersion since ever.\r<br />Even with many immersion mods, I never felt too &#34;punished&#34; when depleting the character&#39;s stamina. Even with mods that adds heavy breathing or blurred vision, it never bothered too much.\r<br />\r<br />This simple mod changes that.\r<br />If your Stamina drops to Zero, AND you try to run, the character will Ragdoll and not gently fall on its face.\r<br />You can still walk, though. (Useful on those situations when your stamina is stuck on zero, due to disease or other effects)\r<br />\r<br />Seems simple, but changes everything.\r<br />You will have to better keep track of your stamina in combat.\r<br />It becomes VERY hard to outrun pursuers now, specially on early game. (Don&#39;t go outside on your own&#33;)\r<br />And swimming becomes quite dangerous too, you&#39;ll float adrift if you&#39;re not careful. (At first, I turned off the function when swimming, but it&#39;s not half as fun, and becomes an exploitable feature)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][u][b]Mod Activation\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u][/size][/color]1) Download the Mod;\r<br />2) Drop it on your Skyrim/Data folder;\r<br />3) Activate it, and play the game;\r<br />4) To activate the Effect, you have to find and read the Book [b]&#34;Exhaustion Management for Dummies&#34;[/b]. It can be found on a barrel, by the side of the Sleeping Giant Inn, Riverwood;\r<br />5) Alternatively, you can add manually the Book via console;\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=3][color=#ff7700][b]Compatibility\r<br />[/b][/color]It&#39;s so ridiculously simple that should work with anything else. No need even for DLCs, I guess.\r<br />Mods that change the appearance of Riverwood may screw with the book location, forcing you to add it manually via console.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=#ff7700][b]Suggested mods\r<br />[/b][/color]It should go well with any stamina draining mods.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m currently using:\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59742/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s the first mod I&#39;ve built my own effects, so if you find any problems, feel free to report&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Thanks, folks&#33;[/size]",
