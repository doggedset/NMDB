Antic Skelettons with just new weapons and new armors, followers who are giving their lifes for you because you gave a letter to somebody..\r<br />That just horribly ridiculous &#33;\r<br />\r<br />Just enjoy this mod which is changing little bit of this.\r<br />\r<br />************************************\r<br />Version history:\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0\r<br />Version 1.1 : Fix a bug by the sum of all armor Rating wrote in your inventory.\r<br />Version 1.2: Fix the apparition of magic effect + clean the scripts for uninstalling\r<br />Version 1.3: Mod now compatible with races from others mods &#33;\r<br />Mod cleaned + Tutorial Forge now playable &#33;\r<br />part of project &#34;Skyrim: Usury and others uses.&#34;\r<br />Version 1.4: Now compatible for degrade + repair items from others mods &#33;&#33;\r<br />Version 1.51:\r<br />- Bug now corrected about integration of others mods items, if you had problems, now try this version &#33;\r<br />- Degrade now depends on weight and material: The most is the material expensive, the more is the item resistant to degrade &#33;\r<br />Version 1.52:\r<br />Bug corrected + 4 speeds degradation mode to select with the ring.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- At the end of the intro, escaping from Helgen, you will find in your inventory a ring named &#34;item degrade&#34;. Equip this ring to acceed to a mode menu to select the mode of degradation you want. \r<br />  Dégradation with 4 speeds to choice, according to the difficulty with yo play the game or your preference.\r<br />  You can too desactive the degradation completely.\r<br />\r<br />- Your items will degrade:\r<br />   -&gt; a daily dégradation of wear use.\r<br />   -&gt; An intensiv fight use.\r<br />\r<br />  Items are more or less solid according to the weight and their material &#33;\r<br />\r<br />- Réparation at wheel for the weapons, or bench for armors, in forge.\r<br />    -&gt; according to your abilitis in forge, you&#39;ll need to pay gold for his help...\r<br />\r<br />- On the aventure, equip a hammer to repair (just like in oblivion..)\r<br />Hammers are sold by merchants. You can too build some in forge if you have ability steel-forge.\r<br />Your hammer can break, according to your forge ability.\r<br />\r<br />- All the réparation cost ingots. (1 ingot for 1 item)\r<br />\r<br />- No réparation while fighting.\r<br />\r<br />- Repairing at forge will increase your skill blacksmith, but not the reparation with hammer &#33;\r<br />\r<br />- You can repair your self-enchanted items without to have the competence blacksmith arcane.\r<br />But for original magic items you will need to pay at the forge or have the ability magic blacksmith.\r<br />\r<br />- The weapons are now tagged with [new] or [unknown]:\r<br />\r<br />   -&gt; items [unknown] are found in the world, on bandits, in coffers..\r<br />         You can reveal them by just equipping them. This add much in realism: No new weapon on skelett &#33;\r<br />      You can&#39;t sell or enchant item tagged &#34;new&#34; or &#34;unknown&#34; You have to reveal it first.\r<br />\r<br />   -&gt; Items [new] are those built in the forge, or sold by merchants (but not only).      \r<br />\r<br />- For every item type (example: &#34;Iron sword of fire&#34;), &#34;only&#34; 3 copies are playable in the inventory of each type, at the same time.\r<br />  You will not be able to reveal the fourth item of the same type before you remove one of the first 3 ones from your inventory.\r<br />(this limit is for modding reasons)\r<br />This no big inconvenance.\r<br />\r<br />- This is just statistik degradation &#33;&#33; No graphism spectacle &#33;\r<br />Mod compatible with items from others mods\r<br />\r<br />****\r<br />Bugs\r<br />****\r<br />\r<br />- No bug known at this time.
