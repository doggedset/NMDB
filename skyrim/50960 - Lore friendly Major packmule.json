  "descriptionHtml": "This mod aims to make yourself or your follower/followers into a packmule. There are 16 lore friendly backpacks with enchantments. I&#39;ve made small and large backpacks that will suit a wide range of players. Some don&#39;t mind the bulky look and other dislike it. I lean towards immersion so the larger backpacks will boosts your ability to carry more than a smaller backpack.\r<br />\r<br />I decided that scattering the backpacks across Skyrim is a good idea, but I also wanted them to easily available. So I placed them in Skyrim according to the 1st couple main quests. I did place a few in dungeons and some in the cities/towns. Basically you&#39;ll find most or all of them just progressing through the game not really having to intensely search for them. Most are found found in lore friendly places according to the backpack itself. \r<br />\r<br />Most backpacks use the slot 44 but a few use slot 45. Some are actually meant to be worn together to achieve more carrying ability.\r<br />\r<br />List of backpacks/carrying gear\r<br />\r<br />Bards Gear \r<br />Common carrying bag\r<br />Dovahkiin carrier- reduces shout time\r<br />Drauger carrier- reduces shout time found on certian draugrs\r<br />Dwarven backpack\r<br />Fighters gear- boosts block and one handed\r<br />Fishermans bucket\r<br />Forsworn backpack\r<br />Mage gear -  boosts the 5 schools of magic\r<br />Merchants carrier gear - helps with persuasion and speechcraft\r<br />Natures gear -  regenerates stamina/health/magicka faster\r<br />Thief gear- boosts lockpick and pickpocket\r<br />Farmers gear- boosts alchemy and blacksmithing\r<br />Treasure hunter backpack\r<br />Warriors gear- boosts block and two handed\r<br />Marksmans gear- boosts archery and stamina \r<br />\r<br />KNOWN ISSUES\r<br />clipping with certain armors\r<br />may clip with the body depending on what animations you use\r<br />some ground items lack physics and will float where they are dropped\r<br />\r<br />Manual Install\r<br />unzip and drag the texure folder and esp into the skyrim (data folder). \r<br />\r<br />For best result start a NEW GAME\r<br />\r<br />Just uploaded a new file which fixes the filepath  for the meshes.
