There he drinks mead, wine, sings and just makes hes days go by. \r\nI havnt bound him to a quest yet, but the thought is that he is fed-up with living for nothing, and would love to follow the Dragonborn on its adventures.\r\nJust a simple guy who is incredibly good in 2h weps and prefers light armor.\r\nHe is even marriable, if you fancy him enough.",
