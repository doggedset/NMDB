I think it&#39;s time to get a new hobby...)[/i][/size]\r<br /> \r<br />...Welcome, welcome&#33; This mod was a [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/1753315-an-elder-scroll-weapon/]request[/url] I fulfilled some time ago, but figured it wouldn&#39;t hurt to share it here. Requires no DLC.\r<br />\r<br />An two-handed elder scroll weapon, pure and simple. It&#39;s outside of High Hrothgar, has the same stats as steel greatsword, and can be tempered with a paper roll. I know it clips a bit with the ground sometimes (you can see it in the picture), but it&#39;s the size it needs to be so animations work correctly. It uses default textures so it may look different in your game. I am NOT planning on adding any more weapons.\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
