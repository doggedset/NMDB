  "descriptionHtml": "This mod comes complete with bedroom, weapon racks, enchanting room, alchemy room, a teleport area, and the coolest teleport spell book ever made.  I will not keep this mod posted if the original maker comes forward and asks me to pull it, but I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to find the original author who did 98% of the work.  I would love credit to be given to the original designer of this mod and for it to be shared with everybody on Skyrim Nexus. All I did was add a teleport doors to the 3 Hearthfire homes, archmage tower, thieves guild, and Severan Manor (Dragonborn) complete with keys.  Entrances to and from are located right after you build and enter the Hearthfire Homes.  The Archmage Tower and Severin manor keys are still quest driven.  The thieves guild key is in the safe in the Cistern - Ragged Flagon.  I have incorporated all expansions into this and also the Leveler&#39;s Tower as it is by far one of the best player homes yet and the already established spell book contains a spell to take you there and many other custom made player homes.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY&#33;",
