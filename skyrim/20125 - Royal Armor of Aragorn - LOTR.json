  "descriptionHtml": "[color=RoyalBlue]Royal Armor of Aragorn[/color]\n<br />\n<br />Authors: haldir307 and Maty743\n<br />\n<br />[color=Orange]For many times people reporting me the same problems they have when installing with and without NMM, but after my reply it works again, those problems doesn't exist at all in my mods, its happening from their mistake, did not get all the files they need and did wrong installation.\n<br />On the other hand, they may not read the description at all, NOT MY PROBLEM!\n<br />So pay attention because i wont reply anymore for the same subject!\n<br />\n<br />1) First you need to install the Main File and then the Update File, NOT just the Update File!!!\n<br />2) About the Optional File(s), first you need to install the Main File and then the Update File, NOT just the Update File,\n<br />then the Optional File(s) if you want, also NOT just the Optional File(s)!!!\n<br />3) On NMM while overriding a file over the other, it says you \"A different version of **** has been detected. The installed version is, the new version is.\",\n<br />and it asks you \"Would you like to upgrade?\", also it says you \"Selecting NO it will the new Mod normally\", you should click NO and not YES, it will keep the main file and will replace the update files over the main file, same goes for the optional files.\n<br />\n<br />About the update file \"RAOA - Clipping Cape Fix\", read description before install it, its actually an optional-update file, but nexus does not have such a section, so i added it in update section.\n<br />\n<br />Its not hard to do it so! oo[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=red][[[@To all\n<br />If you have issues that the mod is not working, that the armor is invisible, that the armor doesn't show up in blacksmith or anything else, now i explain what you all do wrong, because i tested and the mod is working great like to all other people who installed it corectly and works great to them too!\n<br />\n<br />What you make wrong is:\n<br />You downloaded only the Update File \"RoyalArmorOfAragorn\" and installed it, but not first the Main File \"Royal_Armor_of_Aragorn\"!\n<br />\n<br />Why you have those issues:\n<br />Because the Main File contains the Meshes and Textures of the armor, also the esp file does not have armor rate and its my mistake.\n<br />\n<br />What you have to do is:\n<br />You must first install the Main File and then the Update File to replace the old esp with the new esp, the esp in Update File is fixing the armor rate.\n<br />\n<br />Where are the armor and cape in blacksmith:\n<br />The armor is in the Steel section, but the cape is in Misc section.\n<br />\n<br />If you will install like i say, then it will work like to all other people works.]]][/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Many thanks to Maty743 who game me the permission to use his\n<br />Dark Armor of the Knights of the Nine mod to make the mod i always want.\n<br />Also many thanks to Prometheus who game me the permission to use\n<br />his cape of the Prometheus Capes mod for any mod i make.\n<br />All credits goes to Maty743 and to Prometheus, but you can endorse the Royal Armor of Aragorn mod.\n<br />\n<br />[color=RoyalBlue]Description:\n<br />I retextured the Dark Armor and remade the meshes of Dark Armor from Knights of the Nine mod.\n<br />Its standalone, craftable in steel section and the cape in misc section.\n<br />Can get the armor aslo by console, player.additem xxxxxxxx\n<br />Cuirass -

Clipping Cape Fix\n<br />After i learned how to make texture parts invisible, today i thought that\n<br />it can work on the clipping issue of the cape over the shoulders,\n<br />so i tryed and it works, but in side views there may be little visible parts\n<br />which i do not know how to fix it, well, its not so bad, but better from before.\n<br />In this file are two folders, one fix for the main cape and one fix for the\n<br />optional cape, so you must [b][u][size=3]choose only one fix[/size][/u][/b] for the cape you are using!\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />First you need the main file installed!\n<br />Extract \"RAOA -
