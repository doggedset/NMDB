  "descriptionHtml": "[size=10]New Summon[/size]\r<br />The Dremora Lord is one of the mos powerful summons in Skyrim, but i always wanted an alternative summon, not a heavy-armored warrior or those funny atronachs. So i made this mod, for me and for anyone to use, a powerful Dremora Mage to fight with Arch-Mage Dragonborn&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Using Black Robes and a pair of boots, he can take down some of the most annoying enemies for you only with magic.\r<br />\r<br />The Dremora Mage has less health and stamina than Dremora Lord, but he only have ranged attacks and can heal himself if he is near death. I tried to do not make him overpowered and a mage version of Dremora Lord.\r<br />\r<br />[size=10]Overpowered[/size]\r<br />I was asked to make a hardcore version of Dremora Mage to those who play in extreme difficulties. I do not like god-like mods, but if you are a hardcore player, this will help. Dremora Mage OP is much more powerful than the default, he has a stronger version of Incinerate, can turn greater undead, can heal more health and conjure a Storm Atronach. He also has more Health, Magicka and Stamina.\r<br />\r<br />[size=10]Stats[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Health: 300 (450 OP)\r<br />Magicka: 500 (700 OP)\r<br />Stamina: 50 (150 OP)\r<br />Speed: Normal (130% OP)\r<br />\r<br />[size=10]Spells[/size]\r<br />I wanted the Dremora Mage with some good magic, but not overpowered. So i gave him some basic and varied spells:\r<br />\r<br />Incinerate: default ofensive spell, does great damage as the Dremora Mage is very skilled in Destruction. (Has 120 damage in OP version)\r<br />Flame Cloak: to burn near enemies.\r<br />Close Wounds: Dremora Mage use this when he is near death. \r<br />Greater Ward: magical protection against magic and weapons.\r<br />Ebonyflesh: best mage armor (300 armor rating).\r<br />Turn Undead: very helpful when fighting Draugr, Vampires and other abominations\r<br />Turn Greater Undead: can be used against more powerful undead (only in OP Version).\r<br />Grand Healing: heals much more health (only in OP version).\r<br />Conjure Storm Atronach: Dremora Mage is so overpowered that he can summon too&#33; (only in OP version).\r<br />\r<br />[size=10]Perks[/size] \r<br />Beyond the spells, Dremora Mage also has perks, here is the list:\r<br />\r<br />Augmented Flames II (70): makes fire spells stronger\r<br />Destruction Expert (75): reduces Incineration&#39;s cost.\r<br />Restoration Adept (50): reduces Greater Ward and Close Wounds&#39; cost.\r<br />Alteration Expert (75): reduces Ebonyflesh cost.\r<br />Mage Armor III (70): fortifies Ebonyflesh.\r<br />Stability (70): makes Ebonyflesh last longer.\r<br />Regeneration (20): fortifies Close Wounds.\r<br />Recovery II (60): recover magicka more faster. (only in OP version)\r<br />Aspect of Terror (50): makes fire spells stronger. (only in OP version)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=10]Video[/size]\r<br />\r<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNTM5DP9n8Y\r<br />\r<br />[size=10]Notes[/size]\r<br />*If you have any question, leave a comment and i shall reply.\r<br />*All Conjuration perks affects Dremora Mage, including Twin Souls.\r<br />*The spell tome can be bought from any magic merchant.\r<br />*Any bugs or errors contact me.\r<br />\r<br />[size=10]Updates[/size]\r<br />\r<br />1.1 fixed Conjuration level, now Dremora Mage will use Turn Undead.",
