Also includes a follower in the New Gnisis Cornerclub, from which he sleeps in an owned bed. He is Level 25 by default, and designed for the help from a higher level thief, who they wish to give arms and armour so that they fight well.\r<br />\r<br />This man respects the PC by default, and adores all of the Grey Quarter&#39;s residents. Harm them, and he might come after you.\r<br />\r<br />Future Update Planned: A basement under the Grey Quarter home, where pots containing the ashes of the deceased residents of the Grey Quarter. They have no business with the Nords, and mostly certainly will not be buried there, right?",
