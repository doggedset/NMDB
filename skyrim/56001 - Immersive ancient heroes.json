How you acquire the shout would definitely be a spoiler. Below is a brief spoiler-free description of this mod as I understand the mod to work:\r<br />\r<br />Within the vanilla game, as a player character, you will eventually be able to use a shout to summon each of these NPCs. However, you are only able to summon them in progression as you learn each new word of the Call of Valor shout. My understanding is that this mod will allow you to summon all three of these Nord heroes at once.\r<br />\r<br />In my opinion, this is a great idea. You will not be able to use this shout until the conclusion of the main quest.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][b]Thanks Mayhem King :)[/b][/size]",
