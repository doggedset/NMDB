  "summary": "This module offers multiple different values for health regeneration in and out of combat, including an option that disables health regeneration entirely.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=6][u]Health Regeneration Options[/u]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4][b][u]What this mod does:[/u][/b]\r<br />In the vanilla game, the player&#39;s health regenerates 30% slower while in combat. This is due to balance purposes, but depending on the combat mods that you may have installed or other factors, this might be unsatisfactory. I have also included an option that disables [i]all[/i] health regeneration for the more hardcore players.\r<br />\r<br />I have created four different options at the moment, but I am open to making more if anyone would like another option.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]The Mod Currently Includes Five Options:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]Heal Over Time[/u] - My preferred version, and the newest addition to the mod. In this version, you will heal over time outside of combat. This gives a purpose to sleeping in the vanilla game as well as a roleplaying element in the form of resting between dungeon raids. Health will regenerate from zero to full health in four hours, and from half health to full in two hours, etcetera.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][u]1x [/u][/b]- This option will make it so that health passively regenerates at the same rate both inside and outside combat. This could be for immersive purposes, or to make the system work better with a mod that alters some other aspect of health or healing.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]1.5x[/b][/u] - This option makes health regenerate 50% faster in combat than out of combat. This could be considered a cheat option, or an immersive option, depending on the character you are playing and the mods you are running.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]No Combat Regen[/u][/b] - This option does exactly what it sounds like. Your health will not regenerate while in combat, so you will have to drink a potion or two if you want to get back into the fight. This option makes combat more tactical and realistic. If you are cut by a sword or smashed by a hammer, your wounds will not begin to heal ten seconds after they occur.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]No Regeneration[/u][/b] - Health will not regenerate at all. This creates a realistic and tactical feel, forcing you to use potions or spells to heal yourself instead of your wounds magically closing without effort. [u][i]Note: [/i][/u][i]This option edits the vanilla playable races, not including vampires. It will not affect any races added by other mods unless you request a compatibility patch.\r<br />[/i][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][/size]Author&#39;s Note:\r<br />If you would like to see more options added for whatever reason, message me directly or post on this mod&#39;s page and I can make another option relatively easily. Thank you for using my mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />-Zer0The0Her0[size=6][/size][/center]",
