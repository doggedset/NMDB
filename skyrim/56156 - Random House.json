  "summary": "A house with all the craftables including mines in the lower levels.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I made this when I was teaching myself to mod so it is a bit all over the place. no sleeping etc. has 4 entrances around skyrim ALL craftables and a merchant with 25000 gold. this mod also includes guards at the entrances which are loyal to the player and also serve as followers. Archer guards in dragonscale armor and two handed guards in dragonbone. I use this with a no fast travel mod so it is more like a pit stop. the entrances are all marked on the map and are fast travel capablefor those that want the indoors is also navmeshed and follower friendly.\r<br />\r<br />there is plenty of room for improvement so suggestions are welcome or others who want to expand on the mod are welcome to it just ask.",
