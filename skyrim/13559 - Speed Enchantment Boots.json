  "descriptionHtml": "Update 4/4/12 - Made boots a bit harder to enchant with speed. I felt it was still too easy to make them go too fast. The old version is still available.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds boots to the game which increase movement speed (Running, Sprinting, and Sneaking). They use random item lists the same way most enchanted items do, so they will drop as random loot and be found in appropriate stores occasionally. They can be found as any kind of armored boot, and each kind has three enchantment tiers that vary anywhere from 10% to 20% movement increase based on level.\r\n\r\nThey can be disenchanted, and the enchantment can be added to any boot or shoe.\r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t want to wait for a random drop, there is a low-level pair that can always be found in Movarth\\'s Lair near Morthal, among the rest of his shoe collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me if you have suggestions or encounter any bugs (even small things like spelling errors - those bother me). This mod is relatively small but it may be incompatible with other mods that affect certain item lists. If it becomes obvious that this is the case, let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the future, I intend to create a balanced weapon speed enchantment that would be applied to gloves in the same fashion. I know how to do it and it would be no more difficult to make than this mod, but it would also be as time-consuming as this mod was. I\\'ll probably add it here as an optional file when I make it.\r\n---\r\n\r\nRecommendations (Unrelated): \r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9969]Spell Scaling with Skill Level[/url] by Honey Lemon\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12727]Vampirism Inverter[/url] by David Brasher\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9247]Dual Wield Parrying[/url] by Borgut1337",
