  "summary": "A minor AI edit that makes dragons hostile to each other.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Just a super simple and quick edit to the base AI references(NOT the AI scripts; I only changed the combat aggression in the referenced races that all the dragon races use) that allows dragons to attack each other. Note, however, that they don&#39;t prioritize each other; think of it like squabbling over food. \r<br />\r<br />Couldn&#39;t find another mod that did this so made my own. Just fixing something that always bugged me.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />Mod compatability: \r<br />Confirmed to work with Dragons Diversified 3 backport. \r<br />Seems to work with Deadly Dragons, definitely doesn&#39;t conflict but I have so many dragons from so many mods it&#39;s hard to tell if the DD dragons are being affected.\r<br />Anything else that edits the bases will conflict. Anything that simply references them should adopt the new behaviour. \r<br />\r<br />Bugs: None known yet, please let me know if you find anything. I&#39;m a bit worried this may affect otherwise friendly dragons IE Ohdaviing but I haven&#39;t had the spoons to test it yet. &gt;.&lt;&#39;",
