  "descriptionHtml": "~~~~~~~~~~~*gasp* What is this?~~~~~~~~~~~~ \r<br />If you couldn´t tell by now,it´s a home,for you,the player,on an island. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~How about being a bit more precise?~~~~~~~ \r<br />No... \r<br />Jk,here´s what this mod includes: \r<br />-A new home for you on a lovely island,which totally hasn´t got the skeleton of someone,who appearantly died here, \r<br />on it \r<br />-A docked ship loaded with sweetrolls \r<br />-And a little farm that you´re totally gonna use \r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~Just tell me what´s inside&#33;~~~~~~~~~~~~ \r<br />Okay,okay,fine... \r<br />-Up front,quite a bit of weapon racks and mannequins and even some customly mounted weapon plaques \r<br />\r<br />-To the left,an enchanting and alchemy area,complete with Potion Shelf,lots of chests to store and organize your ingredients,a little garden with almost every ingredient you´re (n)ever gonna need,leek,an enchanting table with a convenient storage for soul gems,so you have them at hand when needed,and a pretty display case,which I personally like to use to store all my daedra hearts in\r<br />\r<br />-To the right,upstairs,you´ll find a comfortable open bedroom with a large double bed,two nightstands on either side of it,a bookshelf(they´re a pain to make),and some shelfs on the wall to throw some ♥♥♥♥(or treasures,I don´t care) on \r<br />It even has some fancy magic ceiling lamps \r<br />-To the right,but downstairs,there´s a little kitchen,with central cooking spit,a cozy fireplace,some hanging dead animals(no fox),and A FRIDGE&#33; (didn´t expect a fridge in Skyrim,huh?) \r<br />\r<br />-If you go back to the enchanting table and take a look next to it,there´s actually a trapdoor that leads to the basement of this.Now the basement is where it´s getting real. \r<br />-Left and right are everything you need for crafting,like: a smelter,a forge,a workbench,a sharpening wheel and a tanning rack,if you´re into that,along with a few chests to store your smithing stuff \r<br />-Going straight,you´ll walk through a small corridor that has all the shrines,in case you´re picky \r<br />-The big room that this corridor ends in probably has more storage and hoarding space than you´re ever gonna need.It´s meant to be played with other mods that add weapons and/or armor to the game,how else would you ever be able to fill all of these chests and mannequins \r<br />\r<br />Pro Tip:Don´t search the horker \r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Wait,where is it actually?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \r<br />Look at your map,it´s on an island beyond Solitude (what a play on words). \r<br />Don´t worry,it´s got a map marker \r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Are you a banana?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \r<br />Silence,my brother.",
