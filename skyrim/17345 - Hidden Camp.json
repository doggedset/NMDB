  "summary": "A small camp in the wilderness, for someone who want somewhere to put their stuff without buying a home.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small mod that adds a hidden camp in the tundra, a little south of Orotheim by the riverside. It features a bedroll/tent, campfire with cooking pot, and several non-respawning containers. \r\n\r\nI made it for characters who may not want to do all the quests/favours for the Jarls of the cities that are required to purchase houses, but also don\\'t want a mansion mod when all they have to store are a few swords and gems.",
