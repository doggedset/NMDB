  "descriptionHtml": "Northern Encounters - extras 1 \r<br />\r<br />== Requirements\r<br />\r<br />Official DLCs Dawnguard and Dragonborn.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is also in spanish http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68377/?\r<br />\r<br />Northern Encounters -mod is optional. \r<br />\r<br />== About mod\r<br />\r<br />Mod adds deadly black predator slaughterfishes, battlemonks and Bob&#39;s manifestations wandering outside Bob&#39;s domain, in many places and in many forms. \r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s up to you to track down and kill all Bob&#39;s manifestations. Luckily Bob&#39;s manifestations aren&#39;t as strong as Bob in his domain* \r<br />\r<br />* Bob&#39;s domain is only in Northern Encounters -mod (newer versions than 2.1e)\r<br />\r<br />== Tips & facts\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s a journal you should find and read. It&#39;s located west from Northwatch Keep, near the shore. For those who have Northern Encounters -mod, it&#39;s located north from the door to Bob&#39;s domain.\r<br />\r<br />For those who don&#39;t know yet what Bob is; he&#39;s evil spirit that lives somewhere out of this world, in place he refers as his domain. He can take human form by possessing his victim. Evil spirit can&#39;t be killed, but corpse he&#39;s possessing can be. \r<br />\r<br />This mod adds 10 Bob&#39;s manifestations wandering outside his domain. They are a bit weaker than Bob in his domain.\r<br />\r<br />This mod also adds battlemonks. Usually they are interested about places where something markable or otherwise valuable/rare can be found. There&#39;s also a rumor that atleast one battlemonk is looking for daedric armor that Baltar has hidden. Or just something that relates to magic.\r<br />\r<br />And then there&#39;s these fishes... better watch out, black predator slaughterfishes live near the shore. They can also jump to land, although not far from the water.",
