  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]The most current versions of Mod Organizer comes with a couple of Default Themes.  My favorite one being the Dracula Theme.  But it has one serious flaw.  The horizontal scroll bar is not usable do to being set at 1 pixel tall! [b] (WTF!!!) [/b] So, I fixed it.\n<br />\n<br />To install, simply drop the \"dracula.qss\" file into the Mod Organizer's [b]Stylesheets [/b]folder that is located wherever you have MO installed and overwrite.\n<br />\n<br />Example location:  \"steamapps/Common/Skyrim/Mod Organizer/stylesheets\"\n<br />[/size]",
