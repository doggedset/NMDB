  "summary": "Converts Brokefoot\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s original mod into a clothing version (0 armor, not classified as light armor anymore)",
  "descriptionHtml": "I made this mod for my own personal use, but figured other people would be interested.\r\n\r\nWhat it does:\r\nChanges all the clothing sets (Leah, Dandelion, Vicky, Khantu, Temptress) into ArmorClothing category of apparel, and sets their armor level to 0.\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\nI use SkyRe, and in the alteration school there is a perk that makes armor type spells (oakflesh, ironflesh, etc) more powerful if wearing 0 armor.\r\n\r\nRequires the original brokefoot mashup:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20415\r\n\r\nDownload and install this mod over it, overwriting it (it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just the .esp)\r\n\r\nModified with permission from Brokefoot.\r\n\r\nAll categories in crafting have been maintained. The only changes that were made were:\r\n1. Removed ArmorLight from all pieces, added ArmorClothing and their respecting types for footwear/handwear\r\n2. Set Armor Class to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"none\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" instead of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"light\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\r\n3. Set Armor Level to 0.\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\nSpeak with Brokefoot for any changes, as it is his mod that I modified.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBrokefoot.\r\nEveryone credited in the original Mashup mod!\r\nMrTroubleMaker for making the UNPB-BBP version.",
