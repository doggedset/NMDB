  "descriptionHtml": "I always had trouble finding the ideal place to take screenshots of my character, armour, weapons etc. So I made a custom studio to make it all easier. This is ideal for mod reviewers/ screenshooters or anyone wanting to take a good look at their character and take a few pics. \r<br />The first room is a small empty room with decorations, I made this room mainly for armour and weapon mods to take a good look at them, and take some screenshots.\r<br />The second room is made for screenshots with my character and their companion with props suitable for two actors, such as a dining table and bed.\r<br />The third room is mainly for taking screenshots of just my character with some props around the go with some of the poses.\r<br />All of the rooms are connected by a hall that can be accessed in Solitude.",
