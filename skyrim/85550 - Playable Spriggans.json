  "descriptionHtml": "So this is a recreation of two playable spriggan mods put together. The meshes have been put into only one body slot and they come with their animated effects unlike the old mods. Since theres only 1 slot for the whole body i did not separate them to create hands feet and a head so you cannot wear any gear.\r<br />\r<br />The mod is pretty the same but with a few minor updates to them.\r<br />\r<br />Requires \r<br />\r<br />Dawnguard\r<br />Dragonborn\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24168/?]RaceCompatibility[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11105?]SSE Version[/url]\r<br />\r<br />All of the spriggans share the same sets of skills and stats but the burnt one comes with a firebolt and is resistance to fire but you will need another mod tovmake it 100% unlike vanilla where its only 85 or something.\r<br />\r<br />Each Spriggan can summon a black bear for 120 seconds. They can make animals and humans fight for them in battle for 120 seconds with a wide area of 6000. Use invisibility for 15 seconds. Use healing for 100 points.\r<br />\r<br />So when you cast magic you glow for a bit, kinda like a burnt spriggan when they cast fire or get hit, but it can get stuck if you spam it.\r<br />\r<br />Theres sometimes a visual bug with the glowing orbs inside the spriggans, not sure why. its not gamebreaking so eh. I did not make a spriggan faction item for them so you will get attacked by hostile spriggans.\r<br />\r<br />Stats - \r<br />\r<br />Resist Damage - 25\r<br />Resist Poison - 100\r<br />Underwater Breathing\r<br />Weakness to fire - 25 (not for burnt)\r<br />Restoration - 5\r<br />Destruction - 5\r<br />Alteration - 5\r<br />Speech - 5\r<br />Illusion - 10\r<br />\r<br />So i included vanilla weights as a option, you in this video why.. with the tweaked weights i made with a simple copy bone weight on a full male body. it animates fine for some parts but bad for others. weight the vanilla weights is animates very good but once you look at the pelvis and below it starts to bend in weird ways. Like the butt and hip movement is super strong and the kneecaps bend off other and the feet as well. I could try to tweak the vanilla weights but eh.\r<br />\r<br />As you see in the video:\r<br />\r<br />Modded weights - the butt moves less but the legs curve making it deform, the sneak is not so bad but the orbs stick out the leg socket.\r<br />\r<br />Vanilla weights - The whole butt shakes aggressively and the legs do not curve but when they bend it looks its gonna snap off. sneaking looks bad but hey look the orbs aren&#39;t sticking out\r<br />\r<br />Pick which ever one you want, main file + vanilla weights or just main file.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]qhW3wHcLY5Y[/youtube]",
