  "descriptionHtml": "Ever felt that Necromancy was lacking?\r\nHere\\'s a very small and easy fix, the Necromancer\\'s Blade.\r\nBased on the Orcish Dagger, it have the ability to permanently resurrect any NPC.\r\nBy hitting a dead body they are returned to life!\r\n\r\nAt Farengar\\'s room at Dragonsreach you can find this, I simply thought it would be a nice and accessable location. \r\n\r\nNote: This is in no way related to the Raise Zombie spells or the Ritual Stone. This doesn\\'t raise them to fight for you, simply resurrection.\r\nIt\\'s the same as typing \\\"Resurrect\\\" in the console.  \r\n\r\nUsed to fix quests, or simply Necromancy.\r\nAs of now, it does not have a unique texture. I might sometime later come to that, or someone else may help me with that.",
