  "modName": "Civil War Outfit Variety",
  "summary": "Adds more armor varieties to the stormcloak guard and imperial guard outfits",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever thought it was little weird that all Civil War soldiers wore only light armor? Even though the Imperials had their own heavy set available and the stormcloaks are all nords? Well this mod aims to change that, by integrating the already existing imperial armor sets to the imperial leveled lists, and different steel variants to to stormcloaks, due to their similar stats and the nords appreciation for steel.\r<br />\r<br />Compatible with any other mods that add more items to civil war soldiers, such as immersive armors and weapons by hothtrooper, or other mods of that nature, though some mods may cause soldiers to carry multiple sets of armor. \r<br />\r<br />Btw, the hood the stormcloak is wearing in the picture isn&#39;t mine. I believe it is from immersive armors. ",
