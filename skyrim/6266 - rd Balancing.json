  "descriptionHtml": "rd Balancing\tver.0.0.04b\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this mod\r\n=============\r\nThis is a total rebalancing mod that works with only an .esp file(Maybe optional files will be added in near future, but I\\'m not adding any meshes nor textures.).\r\nThis mod tweaks the balance in vanilla to more hardcore one.\r\nHumans become more deadly. Going out without food can be hazardous. The importance of Portion of Cure Disease increases.\r\n\r\n\r\nEfects\r\n=============\r\n-The stats of weapons and armors are tweaked, results in faster-paced combat.\r\n-Magics are tweaked. They become more useful.\r\n-Sneaking is now more difficult.\r\n-Enchanted weapons are now \\\"trump\\\". Need to be used carefully.\r\n-Forging and tempering weapons are tweaked.\r\n-Diseases become much more fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=============\r\nWeapons - Damages increased greatly. You need take care of enemy that carry weapons.\r\n\r\nShields - Greatly improved. Now you can block attacks much more effectively.\r\n\r\nArrows - Damages increased greatly. The more expensive arrows deal higher damage. You may need to select carefully which arrows to use.\r\n\r\nDestruction Magics - Now they deal greater damage, and their magicka cost decreases. Magics in combat become more fatal.\r\n\r\nRestration Magics - They heal more health, with reduced magicka costs. Results in improved viability in combat.\r\n\r\nWard Magics - They are now in the Alternation Magic Category. Blocks more damage, with reduced costs.\r\n\r\nLighting Magics - Brightness are reduced, but the effective range improved.\r\n\r\nSneaking - You are basically less easy to find, but sevaral factors such as light, movement, and distances effects greatly, makes sneaking more difficult as a result.\r\n\r\nEnchanting - Now enchanted weapons consumes more energy per hit, so you need to use them more carefully. However, the unique weapons are left untouched, so they become more valuable relatively.\r\n\r\nRegeneration in Combat - Now health, stamina and magicka regenerates much slower. Without food, you cannot keep fighting for a long time.\r\n\r\nDiseases - Now diseases are much more fatal. If you don\\'t care immediately, diseases results in an awful situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nForge - More ore are needed to forge an ingot. Ingots are now more valuable.\r\n           More materials are needed to forge weapons and armors that doesn\\'t require ingots.\r\n\t Those make Smithing skill improve slower, and self-made weapons and armors more valuable.\r\n\r\nTempering - Materials that are used to temper weapons are now more expensive ones. You need to think carefully before tempering.\r\n\r\nWeight Balance - Portions and Scrolls are now lighter.\r\n\r\nFoods - Foods now have regeneration effects for a long time. If you don\\'t eat, you gonna cry in combat xD\r\n\r\nTime Scaling - Timescale value is changed to 10.\r\n\t\t NPCs spawns after 3 days outside, 5 days inside the dungeon.\r\n\r\nReduced trushes - Enemies will no longer drop weapons when they die. Reducfes the size of savedata.\r\n\r\nWork in Progress\r\n=============\r\n-Tweaking balance of Sneaking. Changing values little and little for more oppressive sneaking gameplay.\r\n\r\n-Tweaking balance of magic. Looking for the best balance for mage players.\r\n\r\n-Charactalizing armors. Making Light armor and Heavy armor more different ones.\r\n\r\n-Tweaking how to get materials. I want to make the function that you can melt equipment into ingots.\r\n\r\n== When Creation Kit arrives... ==\r\n\r\n-I want to add diseases that are not so scary xD\r\n\r\n-Adding penalty to sleep outside. Maybe I will add a small chance to get ill.\r\n\r\n-Tweaking respawn point. If you keep working on the road, you won\\'t see strong creatures anymore.\r\n\r\n-Tweak the skill improving speed.\r\n\r\n-Tweaking LL. Tweak items enemy drops, items that vendors have, etc...\r\n\r\n-Building tweaked plugins, that can be used with other famous mod files.\r\n\r\nSince I am a Japanese, I am not good at English.\r\nPlease understand that it may be unable to reply to an opinion exactly.\r\n\r\nGratitude is offered to Mr.fiber who translated this text into English.\r\nAnd thank you for the 2ch.net \\\"SKYRIM SS/MOD thread\\\" which always gives an opinion.\r\n",
