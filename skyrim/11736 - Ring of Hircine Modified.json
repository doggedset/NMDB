A common feature I\\'ve noticed is that many of the werewolf tweak mods (including LFox\\'s highly popular one) make the Ring\\'s Additional Werewolf Transformations effect redundant, so I decided to modify its enchantment to be more useful.\r\n\r\nThis mod was originally intended for use with LFox\\'s werewolf mod, but it works independently and won\\'t conflict with any other mod as long as they don\\'t modify the  Ring.\r\n\r\nEffects\r\n-------\r\nThe Ring of Hircine now has the following effects:\r\n+10 Unarmed Damage\r\n-8% Fatigue Regen\r\nThe Cursed Ring is not modified in any way.\r\n\r\nInstallation/Uninstallation\r\n------------\r\nIdiot-proof. Just drag the .esp into your Data folder and enable. To uninstall, just delete it.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\nIn the future I want to find a way to make it work with Beast Form, and possibly tweak the enchantment some more to keep the Ring an artifact.\r\nAlso, this is my first successful mod, so any advice or feedback would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n----------\r\nv 1.0: First release.",
