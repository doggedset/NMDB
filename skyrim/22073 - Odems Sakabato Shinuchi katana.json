During the revolution, Kenshin was a former assassin who has mastered the technique of Battojutsu (sword drawing technique) and could draw his sword with lightning speed.\r<br />After the revolution, Kenshin has vowed not to kill anyone and was used with a reverse blade sword (sakabato). He became a wanderer (Rurouni) and helped those in need, to atone for his murder.\r<br />\r<br />The edge of the blade of this sakabato is on the inside of the curve of the blade. This feature is unique and enables to use a variation of techniques including short blade slashes and parries with an immediate counter strike.\r<br />\r<br />Sakabato(reverse bladed sword) is a sword that wasn&#39;t meant to be used to kill. There were two indentical swords that was made at the same time(according to Rorouni Kenshin&#39;s manga and anime). One was named Kageuchi, which was broken when Kenshin fought Seta Soujiro. The other one was named Shinuchi. Kenshin used this sword to defeat all of his anemies including Makoto Shishio and Yukishiro Enishi.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/489/46052692.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imageshack.com/a/img14/2374/qdnx.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />There are two ways to use sakabato. You can use blunt and sharp sides of the blade. When equipping a sword you&#39;ll get a new spell, which can turn sword and use different sides of blade.\r<br />\r<br />The sword is slightly different from the analogue of the anime - i added some detail to tsuba, fuchi and kashira to make it more realistic.\r<br />Creation of sword took 1 month of my life. Model and textures are maximum detailed. \r<br />\r<br />I hope you like it.\r<br />Please enjoy new sword ^_^\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/7298/30443475.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/4347/ntitle01.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Fixed perk issue.\r<br />Blunt side of sakabato similar to blunt weapons (not tested)\r<br />Sharp side similar to one handed sword\r<br />Sakabato get perk effects from one handed weapon skill tree\r<br />\r<br />Sakabato is not enchantable or upgradable on Grindstone, because of new specific spell that changing sides of blade. But i believe its powerfull enough.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4840/ntitle02.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />The sword is for sale in a &#34;Bits and Pieces&#34; in the Solitude\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img839.imageshack.us/img839/2603/ntitle03.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />1.
