  "summary": "As my first mod, I wanted to buff up some weapons that seemed pretty cool to me, the Nord Hero weapons. They are made only at the skyforge. I buffed their damage, but also changed their crafting recipes slightly to balance the buff they got.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Note: The textures seen on the weapons are not mine, nor are included with the mod, you can find them here: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2525\r\nNote 2: The retexture is absolutely -not- needed, but the glow dust requirement makes more sense if you -do- use it.\r\n\r\nI made this mod as my first mod ever to an Elder Scrolls game, and I made it because the above retexture for the nord hero weapons were really bada__. Sadly, the stats were still a little lackluster. So, I made this mod as an addon to the above retexture, and they are made to go together. This will buff the damage (and increase the price) of the nord hero weapons, to put them more in line with something you\\'d want to keep with you for a long time.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, they still have the restriction of needing to be crafted at the skyforge, including going through the quests for it, and I have also upped the ingredients for upgrading the ancient nord weapons into nord hero weapons.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1:\r\n- Lowered the base damage of all nord hero weapons from 1.0\r\n- Changed the quicksilver ingots to corrundum ingots in the crafting recipes\r\n- Changed the glow dust to ice wraith teeth in the crafting recipes\r\n- Added craftable nord hero arrows\r\n- Added Honed and Supple Nord Hero weapons, which have the same crafting recipes and stats as the original 1.0 Nord Hero buffed weapons\r\n- Doubled the price -again- on the Honed and Supple versions\r\n\r\nCurrent Features:\r\n- Prices have been doubled\r\n- Damage has been buffed\r\n- Steel ingots replaced with corrundum ingots in all recipes (Including tempering)\r\n- 1 Ice Wraith Teeth added to all recipes (Including tempering) to balance the buff to damage\r\n- Honed and Supple nord hero versions added, made from the honed and supple ancient nord weapons instead of the normal ancient nord weapons\r\n- Honed and supple versions use quicksilver ingots instead of corrundum, and glow dust instead of ice wraith teeth\r\n- Honed and supple versions are even more powerful and expensive than the normal ones\r\n- Added craftable nord hero arrows, which are powerful, using corrundum and quicksilver to forge out of normal ancient nord arrows\r\n\r\nPlanned Features:\r\n- New textures for both the nord hero, and the honed/supple version of the nord hero weapons. These textures will be different between each version.\r\n\r\nInstallation: Simply unpack the ZIP file into the Skyrim/Data folder, then add it to the list of active mods in the usual way (in the launcher, or in the plugins.txt file if the launcher doesn\\'t give the option).\r\n\r\nUninstall: Simply delete the NordWeaponBuff.esp file from your data folder, or turn it off in the launcher or plugins.txt file.",
