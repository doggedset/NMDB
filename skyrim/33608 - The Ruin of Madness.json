  "descriptionHtml": "Just a lore-friendly, radiant story enabled dungeon that focuses on atmosphere, realism, and a bit of difficulty.  This dungeon is also leveled, so you can enter it at any level!  There are two pieces of lore, of the back-story of the dungeon, in it, two journals, one in a tent, one in a bandit chieftain\\'s recently deceased body.\r\nIt will be dark in here, it is VERY recommended that you bring a torch or something that generates light or night vision.\r\nYou may edit this mod as you wish, but if there is something wrong with it please tell me about it so I may fix it and save you the trouble. :)\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod, enjoy!  Constructive criticism is welcome in the comments!",
