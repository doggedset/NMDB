It also uses another ammo type called &#34;Musket Ball&#34; instead of bolt. However, you can still load crossbow bolt as it was regarded by the game as one and there is no way to fix this. \r<br />\r<br />The musket had custom firing sound and smoke effects.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Acquiring the musket and ammo:[/b][/u] It can be crafted in the smithing forge and improved via the spinning wheel. Musket balls can be crafted in the smithing forge.\r<br />\r<br />The Musketeer Outfit is a set armor specifically designed for female musketeer, it had an attached ammo pouch for pure deocrative effect. It is designed for UNP body but can be used with any other body-types as well.\r<br />\r<br />The boots require [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36213/?]HDT-Highheels System[/url] to work properly, it is very easy to install. Optional non-HDT Highheels .esp is available.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Acquiring the outfit:[/u] It can be crafted in the tanning rack and improved in the armor bench.\r<br />\r<br />[i][u]Part II: The Musketeer Animations\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/i]Included in the optional file is a set of animations made by me designed for the musketeer. Original crossbow animation for the musket is very weird-looking for the musket and reload is a bit too fast for game balance. \r<br />\r<br />The animations will replace crossbow animations but in my opinion, it makes the gameplay experience with the musket more seamless, please consider [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14871/?]PC Exclusive Animation[/url] if you have some concerns.\r<br />\r<br />Further note that, my animations only replace those related to shooting, reloading and walking while aiming the musket.[b] I strongly recommend[/b] you to install Dualsun&#39;s Pretty Crossbow Idles for the running animations. [u]If you do so, please install his idles first, then install with my animations and allow replace.[/u][u]\r<br />[/u]\r<br />[center]:: + :: VIDEO DEMO :: + ::[/center]\r<br />\r<br />A short video demostrating gameplay of the musket and the animations -\r<br />[i](Please note Dualsun&#39;s Pretty Crossbow Idles were installed for the running animations)[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]WzX2QQd2lNU[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Another short video demostrating first person view with[i][b] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49036/?]Immersive First Person View[/url] -\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]Sh7gy1sID3Y[/youtube]\r<br />[/b][/i]\r<br />[center]:: + :: CROSSHAIR ISSUES :: + ::[/center]\r<br />Please take some time and look at [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11941/?]ABT - Arrows and Bolts Tweak[/url] for adjustment of the crosshair accordingly.
