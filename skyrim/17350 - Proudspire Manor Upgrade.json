  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'ve got married with Jordis the Sword-Maiden so I thought that room in the basement for her was just wasting. I named the room as Strategy Room. The key for the room is on the floor right next to the door. Also some extra store for Alchemy and Enchanting and changed the patio a bit. This is my very first mod for Elder Scrolls games, I\\'ve tried my best to make it smooth.I hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nAdded;\r\n- 1 Mannequin\r\n- 2 Weapon Displays\r\n- 2 Weapon Plaque\r\n- 1 Safe Storage\r\n- 2 Chest Storage\r\n- 1 Bookcase\r\n- Shine of Akatosh\r\n- 1 Knapsack \r\n\r\nPlease do tell me if I\\'ve done something wrong!!",
