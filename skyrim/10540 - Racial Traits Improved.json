  "descriptionHtml": "TheLostDeathKnight has uploaded a version which works with dawnguard vampires, along with a few other tweaks: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33795\r\n\r\nA small mod that changes the way your Race affects your skills. \r\nYou will no longer start the game with 10 less levels to gain in your Race\\'s \\\"specialised\\\" area, instead, the bonus is added as a fortify effect, meaning a wood elf with max archery skill will be 10% better than an orc with max archery skill.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I\\'ll explain how Skyrim adds racial traits by default.\r\nWhen choosing your level 1 character, you start at the lowest skill level (15). Then, depending on your race, your skills are \\'bumped up\\' by a pre-determined value.\r\nWhat I have done, is remove that boost, and added it instead as a bonus on top of your base skill level.\r\nSo even though you\\'ll be starting at, say, level 15 archery for a wood elf, your level 15 archery will be +10 levels better than an orc\\'s level 15 archery. Meaning you can level up the maximum 85 times even in your race\\'s main skill area.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a new racial effect to each race, modifying the relevant skills. The skills modified will be highlighted in the skills menu as are all fortified skill increases.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese effects are retroactive, so don\\'t worry about them not applying to save games. It will not rob any skill levels from you either!\r\n\r\nHope you like, feedback appreciated!\r\n\r\nUser Lasyan3 has uploaded a translation, for those of you French inclined:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31825\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nUse Nexus Mod Manager!\r\nManually - just put the .esp file in your Skyrim/Data directory, then check the file in the Data Files section of the game launcher.\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\n1.
