  "modName": "Skyrim Breakdown",
  "summary": "Decompose varies armors, weapons into their basic components and more.",
  "descriptionHtml": "You will require Skyrim version 1.9.32.08  \r<br />Also note that this mod is not meant for you to be overflowing with ingots, selling armor pieces to the store will net you more money than selling the ingots you get from smelting them. However it will be cheaper than selling the armor then buying then ingots (unless you have high speechcraft that is). If you are looking for a mod that practically hands over more money than you can ever use then you might want to look elsewhere. Balance is a factor and concern with this mod.\r<br />  \r<br />[u]Features[/u]  \r<br />1. Vanilla Weapon and Armor Decomposing at Tanning Rack and Smelter\r<br />2. Ingot and Leather upgrading and downgrading\r<br />3. Precious gem upgrading and downgrading\r<br />4. Soulgem upgrading\r<br />5. Clutter(aka. Misc) decomposing (this part is a bit complicated so read more at bottom)\r<br />6. Better Organization, Coming in regular Skyrim weight version or weightless version. For those who don&#39;t like it when the MISC tab in forge looks like the ruined remains of a bad toilet session.\r<br />I made the crafting list for ingots, gems and soulgems in the crafting spots easier to naivagate. \r<br />7. Heartfire items included.\r<br />8. Dawnguard items included, also changed Crossbow and arrow recipes so that you can make them in any forge around Skyrim because them being craftable only in the Dawnguard fort was pretty silly in my opinion.\r<br />9. Dragonborn items now included. However I will say after looking through the items list is that Dragonborn items and recipes are far far too good to be truly compatible with this patch, the item value yield from the DLC smithing is just utterly absurd. I tried to the best of my ability to keep everything reasonable but it isn&#39;t perfect.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Installation[/u]\r<br />Delete older version if you have one, this is important because sometimes I change the names of the file to make them better organized.\r<br />Install via NMM.\r<br />That&#39;s it\r<br />\r<br />[u]Update[/u]\r<br />1.01 (1/6/2014) Added Clutter decomposition recipes.\r<br />1.02 (1/6/2014) Clothes, Paper Roll, Jewelry and Precious Gems recipes added\r<br />1.03 (1/6/2014) Changed Ebony and Orcish conversion recipe due to drastic difference in their prices, also added missing dwarven cog/gear/gryo recipe.\r<br />1.04 (1/7/2014) Fixed some recipes and added a few more dwarven clutter recipes that I was miissing.\r<br />Also Hearthfire add-on released.\r<br />1.05 (1/9/2014) Human/Troll skull and Right Eye of the Falmer included.\r<br />Added Steel to Glass recipe for Hearthfire add-on.\r<br />Also Dawnguard add-on released.\r<br />1.06 (1/11/2014) All files unchanged.\r<br />Dragonborn add-on complete.\r<br />1.07 (1/16/2014) Added missing miner and monk robe recipes.  \r<br />Also changed ebony ingot to stalhrim recipe from 3 ebony ingots to only requiring 2.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Coming Soon[/u]\r<br />Some balance changes\r<br />Also possible missing recipes.\r<br />\r<br />[u]What you can decompose[/u]\r<br />[b][i]Weapons and Armor of these variants[/i][/b]\r<br />Iron, Steel, Scaled, Dwarven, Orcish, Ebony, Daedric, Dragonplate, Citizen Clothes, Hide, Fur, Leather, Elven, Glass, Dragonscale, Blades, Worn Shrouded, Unenchanted Thieves, Wolf, Falmer and Guard/Hold.\r<br />[b][i]Jewerly[/i][/b]\r<br />Unenchanted circlets, silver and silver gemed rings/amulets, gold and gold gemed rings/amulets.\r<br />[b][i]Almost everything you never regularly loot[/i][/b]\r<br />Cups,Plates,Bowls,Baskets,Kettles, and their dwarven counter parts, you name it.\r<br />\r<br />[u]What you can&#39;t decompose[/u]\r<br />Enchanted or quest received equipment are excluded in this mod except for those with no enchantments. Also items which I consider collectibles.\r<br />examples: dragon&#39;s bane, dawnbreaker, shrouded cowl, nightingale, ebony mail, etc.\r<br />\r<br />[u]How much do I get in return for decomposing?[/u]\r<br />Depending on the equipment you may get 1 more than the standard amount.\r<br />[b]Armor[/b]\r<br />Gloves = 1 ingot\r<br />Boots = 1 ingot\r<br />Helmet = 2 ingots\r<br />Shield = 2 ingots\r<br />Chest = 3 ingots\r<br />\r<br />[b]Weapons[/b]\r<br />Dagger = 0.5 ingot\r<br />Sword/Mace/Axe = 1 Ingot\r<br />Greatsword/Battleaxe/Warhammer = 2 ingots\r<br />Bow = 2 ingots\r<br />\r<br />[b]Rings/Amulets[/b]\r<br />Plain Ring = 0.25 ingot\r<br />Plain Amulet = 0.5 ingot\r<br />Gem Ring/Amulet = 0.5 gem\r<br />Silvergem(garnet) and Goldgem(amethyst) amulets are a 1:1 ratio in decomposing because crafting them costs more in gems than the other amulets.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Clutter[/b]\r<br />Some exceptions\r<br />0-1 weight = Varies\r<br />1-2 weight = 0.5 ingot\r<br />3-4 weight = 1 ingot\r<br />5+ = 2 ingots\r<br />\r<br />Ancient equipment receive only half the normal amount or a downgraded ingot.\r<br />Daedric items also have 2 options for decomposition, standard Daedra Heart amount or 66% more Ebony Ingots than their Ebony counterpart (rounded).\r<br />\r<br />[u]Conversion[/u]\r<br />Ingots can be upgraded into a higher tier ingot for the cost of 2 lower tier ingots at a forge.\r<br />Ingots can also be downgraded into a lower tier at a 1:1 ratio also at a forge.\r<br />Precious Gems can be upgraded into flawless by using 2 regular gems, flawless gems can be downgraded into regular gems at forges.\r<br />Soulgems can be upgraded into a higher level but not up to Black at a forge for 3 gems of a lower tier.\r<br />Leather to Leatherstrips remains the same as before\r<br />Leatherstrips can be reverted back to Leather at a Tanning Rack however you&#39;ll need 6 strips.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Conversion Tree[/u]\r<br />In the forge you can change ingots in this fashion and in reverse also\r<br />1 Ebony ingot turns into 2 Orcish ingots and you&#39;ll require 5 Orcish Ingots to make 1 Ebony Ingot, this is because of the value costs of the ingots.\r<br />Also Charus Chitin obtained from Falmer items turns into silver ingots (with the exception of Dawnguard Falmer Heavy)\r<br />Iron -&gt; Steel -&gt; Moonstone -&gt; Malachite\r<br />Iron -&gt; Steel -&gt; Dwarven -&gt; Orcish -&gt; Ebony\r<br />Iron -&gt; Steel -&gt; Silver -&gt; Gold\r<br />Iron -&gt; Steel -&gt; Quicksilver\r<br />Iron -&gt; Steel -&gt; Corundum\r<br />You can&#39;t however change directly from say a orcish to a moonstone, this is because I believe light class ingots should stay as light class and heavy as heavy. However if you truly wish to do so you can change your ingot material to another class by downgrading the ingot into steel class then back up the tree in the desired path.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Recommended Mods[/u]\r<br />Note these are not required but they really enhance the crafting experience in the game.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8298/?]Lost Smelters of Skyrim by hyralux[/url]\r<br />Probably the pinnacle of what it means to be simple yet effective, adds many convenient smelters.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26230/?]Sharlikrans Compatibility Patches by Various[/url]\r<br />Download the Complete Crafting Overhaul Version (no arrows if you are using dawnguard cause it makes a double reciple).\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34093/?]Weapons and Armor Fixes by kryptopyr[/url]\r<br />More of an extension to the one above, makes weapon and armor stats more consistent.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33959/?]Smithing Perk Overhaul by kryptopyr[/url]\r<br />Note this mod makes the game harder, but I really like the design in this and highly recommend this because it allows for so much more crafting options.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Concerning clutter or misc items[/u]\r<br />For these items, it&#39;s a bit tricky, the game has multiple versions of the same item (cups,flagons,plates,buckets etc) so if you were to say clear out your house and decompose all of your items you&#39;ll have many of them leftover un-decomposed with a little in each category. So to combat this I&#39;m making it so that you can convert all versions of the items with the same name into one singular homogeneous item which can be decomposed. The result will be satisfactory I hope.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Possible problems with other mods[/u]\r<br />If you are using a mod that changes ingots/gems/soulgems value,weight or name (appearance changes such as re-textures however can be ignored.) then load this mod after them.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Final Note[/u]\r<br />If you see an item that is not showing up or is missing please let me know, to save space I made it so that the decomposing recipe only shows up on the smelter and tanning rack if you have items in your inventory, there is a high chance that I might have missed one of them.\r<br />Also if you want to make another mod based on this mod, I don&#39;t really mind, just let me know and leave some credit if you are publishing it. \r<br />\r<br />As of right now I&#39;m not working on the mod because there&#39;s nothing left to do until the next issue shows up, but if anyone has any suggestions on how to fix the issue with recipes moving around in the smelter and has experience with the creation kit then leave a suggestion in the comment section.
