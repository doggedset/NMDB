  "summary": "Adds a high quality Dwemer dungeon.(60~120 minutes of game play time, based on your play style)\r\nWas built to encourage the usage of Whirlwind Sprint, along with puzzle solving that involves traps and levers.\r\nThe dungeon was focused on providing an adventure rather than a simple hunting ground.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[img]  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/35663-1-1367717110.jpg [/img]\r\n[b][color=red][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYVvs6pgBIk] Teaser Video [/url][/color][/b]\r\n[line]\r\n[b][color=red] Purpose [/color][/b]\r\nI built this dungeon to encourage the usage of Whirlwind Sprint. \r\nI know only one dungeon, the first place you go after learning, that requires this shout.\r\nI\\'ve heard from friends that it\\'s useless compared to other shouts. \r\nSo I decided to create a dungeon to make use of it.\r\nIn order to do this it asks the players to navigate across platforms, go through sequenced and deadly traps using the shout.\r\n[line]\r\n[b][color=red] Design [/color][/b]\r\nIt is quite highly populated in terms of monsters and traps both. Traps are heavily but carefully used so that it gives the player a slight challenge to figure out the pattern and a way to pass it. It has some puzzle factors too, which requires a bit more thinking than passing through the traps. It has two factions within the same dungeon, also containing 2 bosses.\r\nBased on the feedback from people who played it, the dungeon seems to provide 60~120 minutes of gameplay based on the play style. \r\n[line]\r\n[b][color=red] Features [/color][/b]\r\nThis is based on the feedback I received\r\n - Great usage of Whirlwind Sprint\r\n - Intense game play throughout the dungeon\r\n - Nice puzzle factors\r\n - Challenging traps\r\n - Engaging boss fights\r\n - Beautiful scenery\r\n - Overall high quality\r\n[line]\r\n[b][color=red] Testing and pre-release [/color][/b]\r\nThe dungeon was released to the Korean Elderscrolls community 2 days ago. It got 96 endorsements and over 3000 views during the last 2 days. It also became the most recommended mod of the week, and the 4th most recommended of the month. And based on the feedback I received, the mod was tweaked to make it more engaging. \r\n[line]\r\n[b][color=red] Requirements [/color][/b]\r\n - Dragonborn DLC\r\n - Whirlwind Sprint Shout\r\n[line]\r\n[b][color=red] Update News [/color][/b]\r\nVer. 1.20 is out\r\n - greatly enhances the exterior of the dungeon\r\n - the exterior experience itself becomes a teaser for the main dungeon\r\n - minor fixes within the dungeon\r\nVer. 1.15 is out\r\n - fixed the wall showing up randomly in front of the entrance of deep halls.\r\n - got rid of the music change triggers since it caused some issues with music switching.\r\n[line]\r\nI invested 370 hours on this mod(including learning the tools and play testing).\r\nWould be nice to get some feedback and some endorsements!\r\nI hope you guys enjoy it.
