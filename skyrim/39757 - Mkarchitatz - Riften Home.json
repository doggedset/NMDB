It is a lot less buggy, and a lot more house like. It has came out of the baby stages and is now into full development, and will eventually be a bug free, fully busy home for every Skyrim player to enjoy.[/center] \r\n\r\n[size=6][color=darkgoldenrod][center]~Description~[/center][/color][/size]\r\n[center]The house itself is featured in a valley, separate from the [color=darkgoldenrod]Riften[/color] world. The house\\'s interior has a kitchen, and blacksmith\\'s room, and an alchemy/enchantment room (the two are merged in one room), and a player room with completely safe storage, which consists of several safes, chests, a reading area with books and chairs, two double beds. The house has now been tweaked a little, to make for better living. I removed the random [color=darkgoldenrod]Deekus[/color] standing in the main hall; he was only there to test some random [color=darkgoldenrod]navmeshing[/color]. I made the house-carls and added cook a lot prettier in my opinion. I also added [color=darkgoldenrod]Works-With-Steel[/color], an argonian smith; [color=darkgoldenrod]Myiatar[/color], a Khajiit smith; a brute [color=darkgoldenrod]Nord[/color], [color=darkgoldenrod]Tytus Morndai[/color]; [color=darkgoldenrod]Skjon[/color]\\'s husband, [color=darkgoldenrod]Rickta[/color]; a demon-man [color=darkgoldenrod]Dark Elf[/color], [color=darkgoldenrod]Marstrys Demon-Rend[/color]; [color=darkgoldenrod]Almacyn[/color], a [color=darkgoldenrod]Dark Elf[/color] assassin; [color=darkgoldenrod]Niacron Force-Fane,[/color] a [color=darkgoldenrod]Wood Elf[/color] in [color=darkgoldenrod]Greybeard[/color] robes; Also staying are [color=darkgoldenrod]Skjon[/color] and [color=darkgoldenrod]Almirel[/color], your favorite house-carl\\'s. All of their AI is now set to a convenient option called \\\"sandbox\\\". This makes them choose from a myriad of random things to do. With that on hand, I added a ton, and I mean a ton of idle markers for the NPC\\'s to choose from. I felt the main dining hall to be a bit bare, so I put a meal for each seat on the table now. I made the blacksmith\\'s room more appropriate to a blacksmith. I took out some tanning racks and in their place, is now grindstones and workbenches. Also in the blacksmith room is now less invisible chest\\'s and more rearranged loot, but there is still a lot of smiting ingredients on there. Future builds will remove some of the 20 safes in the room.
