  "descriptionHtml": "~REQUIRES DAWNGUARD~\r\n\r\nThis mod adds Jills, which are the Dragon wives of Akatosh / Alduin.  They only appear randomly at level 100, but a non random one will appear above the temple balcony in the Vale.  I strongly recommend completing the Dawnguard Vale quests before downloading this mod.\r\n\r\nThe Jills all have 10,000 HP, have an attack that drains HP, stamina, and magicka, and makes you 25% weaker to magicka with direct hits.  I strongly recommend using magicka resistance enchants potions / enchants.\r\n\r\nThe Jills also all drop powerful all-new alchemy ingredient:  Aetherial Dust and Jill feathers.  Aetherial dust makes powerful magicka weakness poisons and is also a very very strong fortify enchanting ingredient.  Jill feathers fortify destruction power, restoration power, health, and stamina.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks goes to Zerofrost for giving me permission to use his Behemoth the feathered dragon model for the base of the Jills.\r\nAlso thanks goes to Halofarm, for helping me out with glow map textures and other advice.\r\n\r\nThanks for the video review, Bestinmods!  :3\r\n[youtube]SsxZnq546cU[/youtube]",
