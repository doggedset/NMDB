  "descriptionHtml": "Cryshal Tower is a very large player home/dungeon consisting of 6 cells, 3 above ground and 3 below. There is a portal to 5 holds, Whiterun, Windhelm, Riften, Markarth and Winterhold.\r\nIncludes a full forge, armory, private chambers, study areas and much more!\r\nThe tower is located in Winterhold and a tunnel system below connects all of the houses in Winterhold. See pictures for maps including portal locations. This mod is fully nav meshed and follower friendly. There are monsters in the tunnels below but the top levels are clean and cozy!\r\n\r\n\r\nBack Story:  (In Progress)\r\n\r\nThis tower was created by an Elvin litch for a Master wizard by the name of Icein Crylgar. Ironically, Master Crylgar was killed by this litch many years later.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall Instructions:\r\n\r\nIf you used a previous version of this mod DELETE old 1.* file \\\"cryshal.esp\\\"  before introducing the new file or your game WILL crash! If you saved any items in the tower remove them first or they may disappear! Also you should save your game outside the tower to avoid problems.\r\n\r\nSimply extract the new file \\\"cryshal2.esp\\\" to your data directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate Log:\r\n\r\nv1.2 - Added more detail and clutter\r\n\r\nv.13 - Removed some Wisp Mothers\r\n      - Spiders and more clutter added\r\n      - Skeletons improved and added\r\n      - Custom vampires removed, replaced with standard vampires\r\n      - vampire added\r\n      - Winterhold nav mesh improved/fixed\r\n      - Fixed nav mesh on the invisible stairs\r\n\r\nv2.0 - Forge and armory greatly improved! (added about 18 mannequins total in this update)\r\n      - Mine-able ore veins added to tunnel system cell\r\n      - Removed some loose arrows causing issues\r\n      - 1 new enchant table added\r\n      - More player chests! \r\n      - Guardian skeevers removed and more spiders added\r\n      - More clutter added!\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues & Incompatibilities:\r\n\r\n- This mod will probably conflict with other mods that make changes to Winterhold as all the buildings in Winterhold are modified (slightly) to accommodate the tunnel system.\r\n- Portals added to Whiterun Dragonsreach, Halls of the Dead (Markarth and Windhelm) and Riften Ratway. Mods that change those areas MIGHT conflict with my mod.\r\n- Some people experiencing crashing, DELETE the old 1.* files and add the new one; see Install Instructions.\r\n\r\nAny other Issues? Tell me please!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Pictures look brighter than in-game - I used photoshop to brighten them up ***\r\n\r\n*** This is a work in progress I currently have over 240 hours into this project ***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits, Special Thanks:\r\n\r\nInspired by Crenshinibon, the Cryshal-Tirith (Elvish, literally meaning crystal tower) in the novels by R.A. Salvatore.\r\n\r\nFemale mannequins by DaniWes found here ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19672 )\r\nYou will need to download his mod to get them.",
