  "summary": "My personal ENB gives Skyrim a unique theme that fits perfectly with the game\\'s design and feeling.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Based on the 0.108 series ENB for little to no FPS loss, my very personal settings aim to give Skyrim a very fantasy feeling.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not looking for realism or cartoon, I\\'m not looking for super brown static movies, I simply wanted something that accented Skyrim and what it represents. Days become bright and colorful, dungeons become dark and gloomy, nighttime is dark and fearsome, and finally mornings and dawns are breathtaking...\r\n\r\nThe screenshots don\\'t quite represent the in game look, just a heads up, I\\'ll use another program soon to take more accurate ones.\r\n\r\nTo install copy all the files into the Skyrim root directory then activate the Realistic Lighting and Realistic Lighting Patcher in the Skyrim launcher.\r\n\r\nI suggest using FOV 90 for this ENB",
