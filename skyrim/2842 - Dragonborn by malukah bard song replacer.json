  "summary": "(Yes, another one :p) Replaces some female bard\\'s singing with fake synced parts from malukah\\'s cover. Optionally with lute emote for the song.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Update: check here for a similar version done by K3FKA [URL=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3023]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3023[/URL]\r\n\r\nReplaces bards\\' song \\\"Dragonborn Comes\\\" from Lisette, Luaffyn and Pantea Ateia with the cover done by Malukah. The .lip files used are original ones so the syncronization isn\\'t perfect, but, although it\\'s a real shame to split and crop such a beautiful song, I found the bard simply staring at your char during it too immersion breaking for my tastes and thus made this variant. This version of the replacer doesn\\'t include any part from the main theme cover. Hopefully when the CK comes out somebody will make a proper version of this song\\'s replacer.\r\n\r\nI added as optional files a mod to makes all bards perform the lute playing emote while singing this song. Unfortunatly if there is a way to make it work only for those bards whose singing was replaced I haven\\'t managed to find it, so for now it\\'s all or none.\r\n\r\nVideo shows Lisette performing in the Winking Skeever with all the background sounds and other npcs muted.\r\n\r\nInstallation: extract into your skyrim data foulder. For the lute file make sure the \\\"dragonborn with lute.esp\\\" is checked when launching the game.\r\n\r\nOriginal video on youtube by malukah: [URL=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z9TdDCWN7g]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z9TdDCWN7g[/URL]\r\nAviable also to download as mp3 here: [URL=http://soundcloud.com/malukah/the-dragonborn-comes-skyrim]http://soundcloud.com/malukah/the-dragonborn-comes-skyrim[/URL]\r\n\r\nPermission to use the song was requested and granted on her Twitter page.",
