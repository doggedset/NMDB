  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will add three rings to your character:\r\nOne for invisibility, one for night eye, and one for detect life.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to set the rings as hot-key items, and then you can\r\nuse the hot-key to toggle that effect on and off.\r\n\r\n\r\nNight eye is pretty straight forward.  While worn, you get night eye.\r\n\r\nInvisibility is also fairly straight forward, with the exception that while\r\nwearing the ring, you can also interact with objects and not cancel the\r\neffects, as with potions and spells.\r\nYou do not become visibile again until you remove the ring.\r\n\r\nDetect Life works like the spell, except does not dispel until you\r\nremove the ring.  It also works on the undead, dwemer machines,\r\nand generally any invisible NPC.\r\n\r\nSee the README for more information.\r\n\r\nThis has been my \\\"hello world\\\" mod since Oblivion.  Standard basic god item.\r\nI will likely not be expanding any features here.  Hopefully there are no bugs to fix.\r\n\r\nI\\'d also like to give a shout out to Ayeque on the Nexus. Without his help, the Detect Life ring would not have been possible!",
