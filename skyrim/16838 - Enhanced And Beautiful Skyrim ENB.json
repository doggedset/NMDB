Reasons being me having left Skyrim for some time until recently, not following Bori\\'s ENB updates and being happy with the config as it is. So, please, consider this description outdated, especially the Recommended Mods section (I didn\\'t keep track of them or looked for other new alternatives), although Features, Installation and such sections should be fine.[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/16838-1-1363976575.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=red]Notice:[/color][/b][/size] What can be seen on [url=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/269/1683811339026922.jpg]this[/url] or [url=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/31/1683811337652557.png]this[/url] image is [b][u]not a bug[/u][/b]. It\\'s the result of using the [b]Edge Detect[/b] effect (like a drawn-ink-sketch) from the [b]Optional Effects[/b] file! (version 1.1, the current version 1.2 is better imo). So, if you are experiencing this \\\"bug\\\" just Delete or Re-Name the \\\"effect\\\" file, and it will be gone (it can be done while in-game, just Alt+Tab and erase it). The Optional Effects where added just for fun, they don\\'t make anything better so install them for fun purposes only :P.\r\n\r\n[size=6][b][color=red]UPDATE (3)[/color][/size]\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[/b]\r\n\r\n[b][u]New version 1.2[/u] of the mod is up!

If you are willing to take your time to configure them that is ;).\r\nIt also adds effects like SSAO and DoF (customizable). More information in [url=http://enbdev.com/index_en.html]Boris Vorontsov\\'s ENBSeries Official Site[/url].\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]The aim of this ENB configuration[/b][/size] is to [b]Enhance[/b] Skyrim\\'s graphic quality, making it look a lot [b]Better[/b] and [b]Realistic[/b] without going too far from what the developers set up. It has many Quality/Performance options too!\r\nIt makes Skyrim a more [b]Beautiful[/b] place by [b]softening[/b] the image and [b]enhancing in-game effects [/b]like sunsets, spells, fog and others while [b]adding graphical enhancements[/b] such us [b]Ambient Occlusion[/b] (SSAO, different options and optional), [b]Depth of Field[/b] (DoF, optional but looks great ;)) and tweaked [b]Bloom[/b].\r\nThis ENB will also add a great feel of [b]depth[/b] to Skyrim that makes you (or at least me :D) really enjoy exploring the world (and of course dungeons).\r\nAlso makes nights and dungeons darker (not too much) so they will look more realistic and feel more dangerous.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Quoting[/u] user Aetherian: \\\"The shadowing you use makes things much more 3D, making things much more solid, real and tangible looking even though it\\'s a fantasy world.

If you were using an earlier version than v0.112 KAGE of ENBSeries, be sure not to skip step 6![/b]\r\n\r\n[b]First[/b], since [b]Boris Vorontsov[/b] does not allow uploading ENBSeries binary files to the Nexus anymore, you have to download [url=http://www.enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0113.htm]ENBSeries v0.113 for TES Skyrim[/url] (click the arrow pointing down). Extract the files, open the \\\"WrapperVersion\\\" folder (you can use the \\\"InjectorVersion\\\" too, but I didn\\'t test it) and copy the d3d9.dll to your Skyrim game folder (where your TESV.exe is, not the Data folder). Then follow these steps:\r\n\r\n  [b]1.[/b]  Download and extract the main file from this mod to a temporary location.\r\n  [b]2.[/b]  Choose between the DoF version and the No-DoF Version folders.\r\n  [b]3.[/b]  Choose the folder with the SSAO Quality you prefer.\r\n  [b]4.[/b]  Copy the content of that folder to your Skyrim game folder (same folder as with [b]d3d9.dll[/b] file).\r\n  [b]5.[/b]  Set [b]bFloatPointRenderTarget=0[/b] to [b]=1[/b] in your [b]SkyrimPrefs.ini[/b] if it\\'s not already done (it\\'s in your Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim folder).\r\n  [b]6.[/b]  [b]([/b]Do this if you were using an earlier version than v0.112 KAGE of ENBSeries, i.e., in your \\\"SkyrimPrefs.ini\\\" after in \\\"sD3DDevice=\\\" there says \\\"ENB\\\" instead of the model of your graphic card[b])[/b] You have to make Skyrim \\\"re-detect\\\" your graphics card by starting the [b]SkyrimLauncher[/b].exe (then the game will detect your card again and configure graphics, as if it was the first time). That\\'s because this ENBSeries version doesn\\'t use the fake \\\"ENB\\\" graphics card anymore.\r\n  [b]7.[/b]  In the Brightness option in-game, set the slider to the middle.\r\n  [b]8.[/b]  Play as normal, you can disable/enable the mod in-game pressing [b]Shift+F12[/b] to see the differences :).\r\n\r\n[b]- To switch between SSAO versions[/b] just copy the [b]enbseries[/b] file from the version you want to the folder where you installed the ENB and replace.\r\n\r\n[b]- To switch between any SSAO to No-SSAO[/b] version or vice versa copy [b]both[/b] the [b]enbseries[/b] and [b]enbeffect[/b] files from the version you want to the folder where you installed the ENB and replace.\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]NOTE:[/b][/color] If you want better [b]Indirect Lighting[/b] for SSAO you\\'ll have to change (in the \\\"enbseries\\\" file):\r\n\r\n[b]UseComplexIndirectLighting=false[/b] to [b]=true[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Default =false looks closer to the 1.0 version though. And performance is a lot better with it set to =false, you decide.[/b]\r\n\r\nI you are going to do it anyway, better search and change the following variable too:\r\nAOAmount=0.4 to =0.6 or even up to =0.8 (To compensate, because changing the Complex IL variable will make this effect weaker, but be careful, this can make everything darker).\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=6][b][color=orange]How to Update[/color][/size]\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]IMPORTANT! If you were using an earlier version than v0.112 KAGE of ENBSeries, be sure not to skip step 5![/b]\r\n\r\n[b]1.[/b]  Download and extract [url=http://www.enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0113.htm]ENBSeries v0.113 for TES Skyrim[/url].\r\n[b]2.[/b]  Open the \\\"WrapperVersion\\\" folder (you can use the \\\"InjectorVersion\\\" too, but I didn\\'t test it), then copy and replace the d3d9.dll to your Skyrim game folder (the same as before).\r\n[b]3.[/b]  Download and extract the file from the new version of my mod.\r\n[b]4.[/b]  Choose as before but you only need to copy and replace the \\\"enbseries.ini\\\" file to your Skyrim game folder and replace (if you were using a SSAO version and chose the No-SSAO folder, also copy the \\\"enbeffect\\\" file). Although you can copy and replace all files just in case.\r\n[b]5.[/b]  [b]([/b]Do this if you were using an earlier version than v0.112 KAGE of ENBSeries, i.e., in your \\\"SkyrimPrefs.ini\\\" after in \\\"sD3DDevice=\\\" there says \\\"ENB\\\" instead of the model of your graphic card[b])[/b] You have to make Skyrim \\\"re-detect\\\" your graphics card by starting the SkyrimLauncher.exe (then the game will detect your card again and configure graphics, as if it was the first time).

The last version (R5 Beta Test 3) is only compatible with Skyrim version 1.4.21.0, so maybe it would be wise to often check for an update.\r\n\r\n[*]I\\'ve read users say they get some better performance using the [url=http://www.darkcreations.org/forums/files/file/205-unofficial-skyrim-patch]Unofficial Skyrim Patch[/url] (apart from the bug fixes).\r\n\r\n[*]I\\'m using [url=http://mrhaandi.blogspot.com/p/injectsmaa.html]injectSMAA[/url] in addition to this ENB, which IMO makes Skyrim look smoother with very, very little performance cost (It\\'s a type of Antialiasing). Can be toggled in-game with the [b]Pause[/b] key.

Plus you\\'ll gain some performance during day.\r\n\r\n[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8070]Dynamic Torches[/url] will let you remove every torch you find on interior walls, so it would be more fun and immersive to play stealthy.\r\n\r\n[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=85]Enhanced Night Skyrim[/url] replaces the night sky textures with high resolution alternatives made from real astrophotography to complete the look for truly dazzling nights.\r\n\r\n[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1653]Alternate Sun Glare[/url] looks awesome, it\\'s more in line with Bethesda\\'s original glare so the difference isn\\'t too drastic. Although you can use any sun glare of your preference.\r\n\r\n[*]This is for the immersion: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3222]Immersive HUD - iHUD[/url], it\\'s an essential for me :). HUD when you need. HIDE when you don\\'t :D.\r\n[/list]\r\n[size=6][b][color=orange]Known Issues[/color][/size]\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[/b]\r\n\r\nKnown issues with my mod or the ENBSeries version I\\'m using:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Water looks kind of transparent.\r\n[*]You can clearly see through fog and \\\"light\\\" effect from windows. This happens in vanilla game too but, with my mod it\\'s more noticeable (in dark areas).\r\n[*]At night or in dungeons water may be bright (for me, waterfalls and foams) although it doesn\\'t look bad :). There is a mod that can help with this: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13268]WATER - Water And Terrain Enhancement Redux[/url] (I\\'ve been using it for a while without knowing this anyway because it\\'s a great mod :)).\r\n[*]ENBSeries 0.109 and higher versions seem to have incompatibility issues with 3rd party programs with Overlay functions such as [b]\\\"MSI Afterburner\\\"[/b] or [b]\\\"DXtory\\\"[/b] (like, the game can crash after loading a saved game). I use [b]FRAPS[/b] and it works fine, a user said that [b]Bandicam[/b] seems to work well too.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=6][b][color=orange]Tweaks/Customization[/color][/size]\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]NOTICE:[/b] You can change the values in the ENB files while in-game, just Alt+Tab out from the game, change them and save, then go back to Skyrim and you\\'ll see the changes (just in case you didn\\'t know you have to Alt+Tab back to Skyrim two times, that\\'s how it works for this game in particular).\r\n\r\n- You can tweak a lot of effects in the \\\"enbseries\\\" and \\\"enbeffect\\\" files. I wrote some annotations in those to guide you (in addition to the ones made by Boris or HD6, they are the sentences that begin with \\\"[b]//[/b]\\\" or \\\"[b]/*[/b]\\\").\r\n\r\n- Note that \\\"Night\\\" values also work for dungeons. Brighter lights for the night mean brighter lights in dungeons too (except from the moon, although I\\'m not sure, as interiors and some dungeons are brighter during day than at night).\r\n\r\n[b][u]In the \\\"enbseries\\\" file:[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[b][PROXY][/b]\r\nIf you have another d3d9.dll (for antialiasing may be), rename it to something else, for example d3d9_smaa.dll and place to same folder where ENBSeries d3d9.dll is located. Set like this in enbseries.ini (or enbpatch.ini for case of patch version):\r\n\r\n[b][PROXY]\r\nEnableProxyLibrary=true\r\nInitProxyFunctions=true\r\nProxyLibrary=d3d9_smaa.dll[/b]\r\n\r\nThat\\'s all, now game will start ENBSeries, then ENBSeries will start aa_d3d9.dll.\r\n\r\n[b][CAMERAFX][/b]\r\n[list]\r\nThe Lenz Reflection effect from light (fire, spells, sun, etc) can be customized or disabled with this variables:\r\n[*]LenzReflectionIntensityDay/Night\t(How strong will the effect be, a value of \\\"0.0\\\" will disable the effect)\r\n[*]LenzReflectionPowerDay/Night\t\t(How strong will the light have to be to produce the effect)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b][RAYS][/b]\r\n[list]\r\nYou can customize the strength of the New Sun Rays effect by changing this variable (this will affect the sun light intensity as well):\r\n[*]SunRaysMultiplier (Bigger equals stronger effect and brighter sun)\r\n[*]You can also tweak the \\\"SunIntensity\\\" variable in the [SKY] section to make this effect more or less noticeable.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]BRIGHTER Nights/Dungeons/Interiors:[/b]\r\n\r\nThanks to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1646669]wkomarecki[/url] for the tip :): Download and install ENB Customizer (the first in the [b]Recommended Mods[/b] section). Then execute it and go to the \\\"Environment\\\" tab, expand the \\\"Light source\\\" section and increase \\\"Contrast at night\\\" by 1-2 points. That\\'s it! :).\r\n\r\n[b]OTHER options and notes:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Notice that more Bloom will also give more light to the scene, and less will make it darker.\r\n[*]Tweak the \\\"[b][ENVIRONMENT][/b]\\\" section to change different lighting options.\r\n[*]Tweak the \\\"[b][SKY][/b]\\\" section to change things like stars, clouds, sun, moon and sky.\r\n[*]The main changes are made by changing the different \\\"[b]...Intensity...[/b]\\\" values.\r\n[*]The \\\"[b]...Desaturation[/b]\\\" values affect the color saturation for each effect.\r\n[*]To apply fog changes, you\\'ll have to open the map (M key) in Skyrim and then you\\'ll see the changes.\r\n[*]See more options and details in the [b]enbseries[/b] file.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b][u]In the \\\"enbeffect\\\" file:[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[b]- The main changes I made in this are:[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]>[/b]  In the \\\"[b]#define HD6_COLORSAT_DAYNIGHT[/b]\\\" section, I changed these variables to adjust color saturation:\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]float3 dnsatn[/b]\r\n[*][b]float3 dnsatd[/b]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]>[/b]  In the \\\"[b]#define HD6_BLOOM_DEBLUEIFY[/b]\\\" section to adjust bloom color:\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]float3 nsat[/b]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]>[/b]  In the \\\"[b]#define HD6_COLOR_TWEAKS[/b]\\\" section there are variables that control the brightness, contrast, saturation and RGB color balance, each one for day and for night.\r\n\r\n[b]- See more options and details (by HD6) in the \\\"enbeffect\\\" file.[/b]\r\n\r\n- You can see more information in [b]ENBSeries Official Site\\'s [url=http://enbdev.com/doc_skyrim_en.htm]Documentation[/url] section.[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/16838-1-1336718969.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=6][b][color=orange]History[/color][/size]\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]05/10/2012[/b] - Initial release (version 1.0)\r\n\r\n[b]05/19/2012[/b] - Released version 1.1\r\n\r\n[b]06/07/2012[/b] - Released version 1.2\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=6][b][color=orange]Credits[/color][/size]\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[/b]\r\n\r\n- Many thanks to these awesome modders:\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3107253]Boris Vorontsov[/url] for developing ENBSeries and being so dedicated and supportive to users.
