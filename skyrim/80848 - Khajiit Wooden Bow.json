  "summary": "A small mod with a small unmarked quest to free a dragon who will sell you a new bow and arrows",
  "descriptionHtml": "This small mod adds a new bow and narrows to the game and a small mini unmarked quest to earn it. \r<br />\r<br />The mini quest starts in Dragon Bridge, in the local inn there look around for something weird... \r<br />\r<br />Far as I know there shouldn&#39;t be any conflicts or huge bugs. It&#39;s not perfect and the quest was just meant to add a unique way to get it. Included I will give a readme that gives a step by step on how to get the bow if the in-game notes are not enough. \r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll kill about three new enemies, collect items and create a key. \r<br />\r<br />The bow and arrows are just a tiny bit stronger then elven. \r<br />\r<br />To install just copy meshes, textures and the Khajiitbow Esp into your data folder, make sure it&#39;s checked and play&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Credits: Without these guys things would be even more ugly. \r<br />\r<br />Violet: [b]Kjell Granlund[/b]             \r<br />\r<br />Bow: [b]Andrej12[/b]             \r<br />\r<br />Arrows: [b]PSlayer[/b]             \r<br />\r<br />Kuna and Sumeu: [b]Ironman5000[/b]             ",
