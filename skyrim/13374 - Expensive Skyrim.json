  "descriptionHtml": "Tired of hundreds of thousands of gold in your pocket? So this mod for you.\r\nThis simple mod will highly increase buy prices, and highly decrease sell prices. So now you\\'ll need significantly more money to buy any good stuff. And sell significantly more stuff to get enough money to buy something. \r\n\r\nI was very surprised when didn\\'t  found something like that. So i had to made this by myself.\r\n\r\nIf you want increased prices for carriages and inn\\'s you can use \\\"Travel Tax\\\" by bootliquor (Note: I will not make same mod because it already exists.)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4290\r\nI also recommend to use Item \\\"Rewards For Bounties\\\" by Warrior G0el to use with Expensive Skyrim/ This mod will make bounties really useful.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11157\r\nIf you want to spend a lot of your money for a good purpose i should try \\\"Perk Point Potion\\\" by _DTG_ (Note: It will be very hard to get enough money for this potion, with Very Expensive Skyrim installed)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10836\r\n\r\nI\\'ve added mod which makes Houses (and other pruchases in houses), Horses and Hirelings more valuable (5x). I didn\\'t test it yet, but it must work proper, including prices in dialogs.\r\nTell me in comments if something works wrong.\r\nv.1.1. Now this mod works proper without starting new game. Thanks to Hidden_7 for help.\r\n\r\nThis mod is safe to activate/deactivate at any time.\r\nIf you liked this mod please endorse. If you don\\'t - you\\'re free to not use it.\r\n\r\nI will not make level based sistem of prices. I haven\\'t enough knowlege about CK, scripts etc. to make such thing. \r\nThis doesn\\'t mean i don\\'t like this idea. I like it and i want it... but i can\\'t make it.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n1.  Showing vanilla prices instead ES\\'s, while still operating with ES\\'s prices. -Don\\'t know how to fix it, because i can\\'t see this issue in my game. If you have a such thing, it may be caused by another mod\\'s which modifies same strings.\r\n2. ExpHHH - Still showing \\\"1000 gold\\\" price for horse in stables. Will be fixed, when i\\'ll get time for it.\r\n\r\nP.s. No credit\\'s and permissions needed to use this mod in other mod\\'s.",
