  "descriptionHtml": "Update:\r\nThe current version includes more detail to landscapes and even a Trader :D. He can be found in the marketplace in Whiterun and sells 25 armor/weapons which are implemented in the mod. Keep tracking guys and always look for more ideas.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the land of Eternia\r\n\r\nThis project is bringing a new world for exploration and enjoyment to Skyrim. The world will be very large and feature many areas for the player to explore.\r\n\r\nEternia also suffers from a civil war. However, it is between the 3 provinces of Eternia. The Kest province of the south, where the player shall begin the peasant story. The Rahj province to the east, where the player shall start the commoner story and the Hunn province to the north, rich family story.\r\n\r\nEach province will contain a small intro story into the game which will include some background knowledge on the civil war and events that have led up to it. Players will also find out about the return of the dark god Galthane Deathwing who, with his armies now massed, wishes to pillage and enslave the rest of Eternia.\r\n\r\nSo it is now the players destiny to unite the provinces OR let one take control and defeat OR join Galthane.\r\n\r\nThe Lost Island, is not really part of the game, more a DLC/expansion for the mod. The small island does contain a house with camp fire and a chest, bed and some benches. Access to this area will not (For Now) be through Eternia. I will upload a pic of the entrance to the Lost Island.\r\n\r\nJust keep watching and comment if you want me to add some stuff (No promises).\r\n\r\nHelp?\r\nIf anyone would like to aid just PM me.\r\n\r\nCurrent Team:\r\nMe(Natula123)\r\nMenacideX547 \r\n\r\nP.S\r\nNexus forums topic gives more info http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/557486-eternia-land-divided/page__p__4523357__hl__eternia__fromsearch__1#entry4523357",
