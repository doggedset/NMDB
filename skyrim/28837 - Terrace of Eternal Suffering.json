  "modName": "Terrace of Eternal Suffering",
  "summary": "An off-shoot of \\\"Sanctum of the Fallen\\\", made within a single day; it\\'s also only one room. Just a crazy difficulty for a battle by throwing multiple copies of the various bosses from SotF at you at once.\r\n\r\nAre you prepared?",
  "descriptionHtml": "Want a challenge, or perhaps you just want to see how much madness one could unleash in a single room?\r\n\r\nWelcome... to the Terrace of Eternal Suffering.\r\n\r\nThere\\'s no point here, just a throwing most of the bosses from \\\"Sanctum of the Fallen\\\" into a single room... and multiple copies of them while we\\'re at it, as well as several of the more elite foes too. All set to tune of \\\"Komm Susser Todd\\\" from \\\"The End of Evangelion\\\".\r\n\r\nA few tweaks to SotF\\'s enemies (changed the hairstyle on Aspect of Envy, removed some summon spells to make this mod no prone to crashes), but otherwise unchanged; the loot tables are completely intact.\r\n\r\nFound just south of Dustman\\'s Cairn (west and a bit north of Whiterun), with no access requirements whatsoever... but then again, only the mightiest of adventurers should dare venture within.\r\n\r\nNot bad for one afternoon\\'s work, yes?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[youtube]X1aHY8wvU7E[/youtube]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*** INSTALLATION ***\r\n\r\nThe requirements for this mod are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Skyrim.esm\r\n- Update.esm\r\n- Dawnguard.esm\r\n- Apachii\\'s SkyHair.esm\r\n- Sanctum of the Fallen.esm (basic or full version, doesn\\'t really matter)\r\n\r\nApologies for all the dependencies, but this mod is an offshoot of SotF (so requires both it and Apachii\\'s) and uses a couple of Dawnguard resources.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*** CREDITS ***\r\n\r\nGainax - For creating \\\"Komm Susser Todd\\\" and the film it originated from, \\\"The End of Evangelion\\\".\r\nApachii - For supplying the hairstyle mod again.\r\nBethedsa - Skyrim and CK, enough said.",
