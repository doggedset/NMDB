  "descriptionHtml": "____________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />New Features;\r<br />\r<br />Have reworked fur, so it&#39;s more tolerable. I made the Wool Leggings texture into a beltings texture to accessorize.\r<br />\r<br />Future Plans; \r<br />Work on textures optimized for males. \r<br />Rework Latex texture. Looking for suggestions for a more lore friendly outfit.\r<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />When using overlays, they use the normals of your skin, even though you are wearing chainmail, it may have the shape and appearance of a nipple. To prevent this, you can either blur your normal maps yourself, which I don&#39;t recommend, unless you know how to texture.\r<br />\r<br />Or you can take advantage of my mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/40053/?]Young to Womanly BodySlide[/url]. This is for CBBE, and you only need the alternate texture. This will prevent the normal map oddity, as it has blurred normals upon the private parts.\r<br />\r<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Khenta&#39;s mod is a great one for immersion and over all functionality. Many players may be fine running around in skimpy armors half naked but, not my characters. Khenta introduced a wonderful idea for easy under-outfitting. I used the mod and was in love with it, immediately. \r<br />\r<br />Using the mod for awhile, I decided I wanted a change, and I frequently texture things for fun, and had worked up a simple method and texture for the chain mail and wool. Originally it was only for personal use but, I decided I wanted to release it publicly, for others to use. (And also in case my PC goes crazy and deletes everything)\r<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />These current textures are female only and CBBE. I am unsure if other bodies will be compatible with the textures nav-map. But feel free to try, as it still will apply to the overlays, it may just look funky. The full body Chainmail however, will work with both genders and all body types.\r<br />\r<br />Currently replaces the chain mail and wool texture for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37962//?]Modesty Chainmail and Undergarments - Body Tattoos for RaceMenu[/url]\r<br />\r<br />The wool was replaced with fur but, is merely a placeholder. Majority of my focus has been on bringing the chain mail up to a good standard quality in appearance.\r<br />\r<br />Please Endorse Khenta&#39;s mod, without it, my work would not be possible, and he deserves the credit for this being able to happen.\r<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Requirements;\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37962//?]Modesty Chainmail and Undergarments - Body Tattoos for RaceMenu[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29624//?]RaceMenu[/url]",
