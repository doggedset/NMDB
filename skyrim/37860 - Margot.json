Had a little nervous breakdown due to the huge number of unfinished quests in her journal but she\\\\\\'s better now (not really, ha).\r\n\r\nEssential, levels with the player, knows Ice Form, melee only, sword & shield style. Skills: Sneak, Block, Light Armor, One-handed. Carries a sword and a stained Spellbreaker. Armor is upgradable (glass stats)\r\n\r\nLocation: inside Jorrvaskr\r\n\r\nRequired: Apachii SkyHair http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/\r\n\r\nThe armor is a retexture of Triss outfit which belongs to CD Projekt RED. Made available for Skyrim by Fraper http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5135/",
