  "modName": "Better Orcish Enemies - LOTR",
  "summary": "This is my first mod. It aims to make more Orc encounters in Skyrim more brutal. These Orcs are larger and are closer to LOTR Uruk-Hai. WIP",
  "descriptionHtml": "WIP. Upon Downloading this mod, you will find Patrols or Orc Warriors, Pillagers, and Orcish Legionnaires. I plan on making a large occupying force in the plains of Whiterun for the player to battle. Most of these Orcs are between level 40 and 60, so they are relatively difficult to dispose of. \r<br />\r<br />Please send me messages how I can improve this mod as I am new to modding and would like some help. Thank you.",
