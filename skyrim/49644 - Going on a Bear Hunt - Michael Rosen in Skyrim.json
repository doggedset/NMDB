  "descriptionHtml": "&#33;&#33;Attention¡¡¡\r<br />This mod was made by Sun Ra,\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sun_Ra/\r<br />Workshop page,\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=213651770\r<br />----------------\r<br />\r<br />I present: Michael Rosen in Skyrim. This mod contains around 400 lines of unique dialogue based on random and specific (wearing armor/in dungeons/fighting specific enemies) conditions. Rosen functions exactly like any other follower in Skyrim, so you can trade, give him commands, and dismiss. \r<br />\r<br />Some of the specific conditions depend on if he is in clearable dungeons, shops, cities, or the wilderness. They also depend on his armor, or if potatoes/tomatoes are in your inventory, or a circlet is worn on his head. There might be a few dialogue related bugs, as I haven&#39;t been able to test all of them. \r<br />\r<br />You can find Michael upstairs in the Bards College in Solitude. \r<br />\r<br />Special thanks to Nichevo on Deck16, with his fantastic follower guide. Here&#39;s the link for anybody interested: \r<br />http://deck16.net/post/22645519500/making-a-unique-voiced-follower-in-skyrim-part-1 \r<br />\r<br />Future updates(?): \r<br />- Marriage options for perverts \r<br />- More lines \r<br />- Bug fixes \r<br />- Cow levels",
