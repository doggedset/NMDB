  "descriptionHtml": "Let me tell you a story. I began playing Skyrim on PC in October 2013.  For the longest time, I didn&#39;t change the character models because I thought they were fine. I also didn&#39;t want to turn Skyrim into some ridiculous world where every woman is a supermodel. Then Sparrow Prince released his Booty Band Aid mod, which I liked because because it made the female model better while using the vanilla design. Then Sparrow Prince deleted the mod in an update, which I got. And so I no longer had Booty Band Aid. At this point, I decided the vanilla female model wasn&#39;t good enough. I looked at [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?]CBBE[/url]&#39;s vanilla preset, but was unsatisfied with how it didn&#39;t look exactly like the vanilla model and how I would have to replace all the meshes for female outfits to make the game consistent. I didn&#39;t want to compromise, so I looked at Bodyslide and gave it a go.\r<br />\r<br />Basically, I made CBBE look as close to vanilla as I could using Bodyslide. I also modified footwraps, Falmer boots, Moth Priest sandals, and wedding sandals to use CBBE&#39;s better foot meshes using Outfit Studio. Then I did the same with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58443/?]SkySight Skins[/url]&#39;s better feet meshes minus the wedding sandals plus Forsworn boots.",
