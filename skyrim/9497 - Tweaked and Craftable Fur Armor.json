  "modName": "Tweaked and Craftable Fur Armor",
  "summary": "just a simple mod that makes all fur armor prices craftable with slight state tweeks that I thought fit better.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I personally thought it was rediculous for the fur armor that was just the bottom to have the same armor rating as the full upper body covering one did. so I changed it.\r\nnow the catch with crafting them is they can only be crafted at the tanning rack. cuz honestly do you really need a hammer and anvil to make fur armor that\\'s pretty much tied together.\r\n\r\n\r\nnow as for the materials needed they are based off the looks of what might of actually been used in the vanilla textures. plus there is one new simple item intruduced, and that is leather laces craftable through the tanning rack. only thing I couldn\\'t find to change was what sections they fell under on the tanning rack lists.\r\n\r\nhope you enjoy.",
