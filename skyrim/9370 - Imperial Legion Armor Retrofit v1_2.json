  "descriptionHtml": "[color=green]---- Version 1.2 ----\r<br />[Center][size=32]NEW VERSION 1.2&#33;[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This mod changes the look of the Imperial legion to be closer to the original concept art while still keeping the same general feel of Skyrim&#39;s original Legionnaires.  Imperial soldiers now come in three visual varieties: Light Infantry, Medium Infantry, and the rarer Field Officer.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red] Please rate, comment, or endorse this mod&#33; It helps me to gauge interest and it gives me motivation to keep working&#33; [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[center][IMG]https://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/735x551q90/43/wri3.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />There are some mods that give heavy armor to legion soldiers, however I feel that the visual gap between heavy armor and light armor is simply too great to justify just giving every soldier heavy armor. The goal of this mod is to bridge the gap, giving regular Imperial soldiers more diversity and access to heavier looking armor while still keeping Skyrim&#39;s Imperial soldier flavor. The heaviest of armor is still rare, as it should be, and is reserved for the officers and Legates, whereas the rank and file soldiers will now wear a good mix of light and medium armor. Not only that, but mid level officers now wear their own standalone armor and can be found fighting alongside their comrades wherever Imperial Soldiers are found.\r<br />\r<br />Changes to the latest version:\r<br />- Fixed bug where armor wouldn&#39;t work with armor perks correctly\r<br />- Fixed armor materials and crafting recipes so that they show up in the correct category (Requires Steel Smithing Perk)\r<br />- Added Frostfall compatibility for the Imperial Cloak\r<br />- Added world/inventory models for the Light and Heavy Crested Helmet\r<br />- Changed Imperial Light Armor name to &#34;Imperial Scout Armor&#34;\r<br />- Changed Imperial Trooper Armor name to &#34;Imperial Soldier Armor&#34;\r<br />- Added a new item &#34;Light Crested Helmet&#34; (Added to leveled lists)\r<br />- Stat rebalance on all Imperial Gear (Imperials now have a fighting chance against Stormcloaks. Stormcloaks = better weapons; Imperials = better armor)\r<br />\r<br />Mod Details: \r<br />- New &#34;Imperial Soldier Armor&#34;, replaces Imperial Studded Cuirass\r<br />- New &#34;Imperial Officer Armor&#34;, standalone based off the Studded Cuirass and some Heavy Armor textures.\r<br />- New &#34;Imperial Scout Armor&#34;, replaces the Imperial Light Armor with a new mesh that includes pants and extra gear&#33; (Thanks asc_kel&#33;)\r<br />- New Imperial Cape\r<br />- Two New Imperial Crested Helmets\r<br />- All items craftable with the Steel Smithing perk under &#34;Imperial&#34; The cape is under &#34;Hide&#34;\r<br />- Modifies leveled lists so that soldiers will randomly wear the new armors.\r<br />- At the moment soldiers come in four visual styles, (Medium Infantry, Light Infantry, and two Field Officer types)\r<br />- Greatest chance of soldiers wearing scout or soldier armor, with a smaller chance of an officer type spawning.\r<br />- Increases the chance that Imperial Soldiers will carry shields into battle\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Known bugs or issues:\r<br />- Any Imperial soldiers that have spawned BEFORE adding this mod will still be wearing light armor even though they are wearing the re-textured cuirass. To fix this select the NPC in the console and type &#34;resetinventory&#34;.\r<br />- The ground models for the Imperial Crested Helmet (Light and Heavy) has some odd physics when placed into the game world, causing it to want to rest on its head. I am aware of this and investigating a fix\r<br />- The Imperial Cape currently does not scale well with the weight slider.\r<br />- Some minor clipping on some items\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS:\r<br />\r<br />- JackoO&#39;s crested helmet mesh.
