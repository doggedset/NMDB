  "descriptionHtml": "My first Mod it&#39;s not much but I really wanted him as a follower and thus was motivated to make this. since I didn&#39;t see a similar mod I decided to upload it. Other than the Vanilla Skyrim it has (to my knowledge) no requirements.\r<br />\r<br />Adds a follower of Sinding the Werewolf in Bloated Man&#39;s Grotto. Scales to level and has the Lightfoot Perk. \r<br />\r<br />Should also in theory be available for Marriage but, have not tested this myself.\r<br />\r<br />Note: This is intended for after ill met by moonlight is complete and [u]WILL[/u] break the quest if applied before then.\r<br />\r<br />Changelog: [spoiler]\r<br />[i]v1.2 - \r<br />Completely remade the mod so it now uses the original Sinding instead as I found that the two versions would attack each-other if they met for some reason. as a result of modifying the voice type of the original Sinding the Ill met by moonlight quest is almost surely broken if you install this before completing it. \r<br />(I may test this at a later date but, if anyone else would like to test it I would appreciate hearing the results.)\r<br />\r<br />02/15/2016 - Added an image as requested.\r<br />\r<br />v1.1 - \r<br />turns out I had messed up on the scaling, he should now be [b][u]much[/u][/b] more effective.\r<br />\r<br />v1.0 - \r<br />EDIT: Will be tweaking to improve his effectiveness in combat as of right now he is pretty useless.
