  "descriptionHtml": "I made textures and modified vanilla mesh in order to create Bethany Hawke - character known form Dragon Age 2. She is follower mage (with some perks and spells). You can wear her dress (only for female). She can be found in College of Winterhold, at the courtyard.\r\n\r\nI made also pants, but as standalone part. But I can\\'t connect it with robe (it\\'s not possible to wear it together at once - there is no right body slot).\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nJust drop folder in: X:...steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data\r\n\r\nNo requirements",
