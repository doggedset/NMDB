The rest is texture mods.\r\nNot married\r\nHe\\'s a vampire.\r\nUsing the Atronarch Stone at the moment for 100% spell absorb.\r\n100% Spell absorb if you\\\\\\'re not using the Unofficial Skyrim Patch, cause for some reason it fixes the necromage vampire bonuses. I wouldn\\\\\\'t really consider that to be a bug, more a clever way to maximize your character stats and enchants.\r\nThis character was lvled in a legit way, using the legendary reset skills option.\r\nAll the crafting gear can be found in the chest at Proudshire Manor below the bed. And all the Collections of Armor Guild master armor, Nightingale,  Daedra artifacts etc etc can be found in Whiterun Breezehome.\r\n\r\nNone ( if I remember correctly ) of the Mage college master quests are complete, nor does he have all the spells/shouts ingame. And ive probably missed a few sidequests in vanilla aswell. So there\\'s still a few things to do, the companion quests and Bards College are still there aswell. :) \r\nREQ : Update 1.9.32.0.8",
