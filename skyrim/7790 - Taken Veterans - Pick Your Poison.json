  "descriptionHtml": "Taken Veterans - Pick Your Poison\r\nIridia the Breton Enchantress,\r\nor Seldon the Breton Enchanter\r\n\r\nThis is Iridia, a fetching enchantress skilled in the art of stealth. By day she plays tag with the neighborhood children, and haggles with the local shopkeepers. By night she poisons town guards, dropping them in their tracks to harvest their very souls.\r\n\r\nIridia recently moved into Breezehome in Whiterun, she is a master Enchanter, and she has the knowledge required to create incredible double-enchanted items. Her expertly crafted poisons, pickpocketed into place, silently kill while bystanders watch helplessly in horror.\r\n\r\nIn combat, Iridia depends on the fast strike from ambush, hitting hard and killing before the enemy has any chance to respond. Humanoid opponents are softened up by poisons placed in their pockets, and her sneaky poisoned-dagger backstabs are among the heaviest hits in the game. \r\n\r\nShe already knows a number of utility spells, but does not have the perks to reduce their costs, so casting during combat is limited. Careful planning beforehand, plenty of poison, and the right enchantments on her equipment are the tools for her success.\r\n\r\nIridia is a Level 30 Breton with:\r\n200 Magicka\r\n190 Health\r\n200 Stamina\r\n\r\nIridia has 29 unallocated Perk Points, or optionally load the save-game with pre-selected perks to play a suggested build.\r\n\r\nIridia\\'s Skills:\r\nEnchanting 100\r\nSneak, Pickpocket 75\r\nAlchemy, One-Handed 60\r\nAlteration, Heavy Armor, Two-Handed, Restoration, Speech, Archery, Block, Destruction, Conjuration, Smithing, Light Armor, Lockpicking, Alteration 15\r\n\t\r\n1*(100*101/2) + 2*(75*76/2) + 2*(60*61/2) + 13*(15*16/2)\t\t\t\r\n=15,970\t[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Total Experience Spent In Skills[/url]\r\n\r\nIridia\\'s Spells:\r\nMagelight, Detect Life, Ironflesh, Telekinesis, Waterbreathing, Detect Dead, Equlibrium\r\nBound Sword, Conjure Familiar, Soul Trap, Bound Bow\r\nSteadfast Ward, Close Wounds, Heal Other, Repel Lesser Undead\r\n\t\r\nIridia\\'s Shouts:\t\r\nThrow Voice (Zul Mey Gut)\r\nMarked for Death (Krii Lun Aus)\r\n\t\r\nIridia\\'s Poison Supplies:\r\nPoison #1: Bleeding Crown, Deathbell, River Betty\r\nPoison #2: Canis Root, Imp Stool, Mora Tapinella\r\nPoison #3: Deathbell, Giant Lichen, Skeever Tail\r\n\r\nIridia\\'s Gear:\r\nGreen Robes, Shoes, Gloves, Jade and Emerald Circlet, Ebony Dagger, Enchanting Supplies\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nInstallation and Use:\r\nUnzip the saved game in the download to your .../My Games/Skyrim/Saves folder, then load it in Skyrim.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n2.0 New name. Added male enchanter.\r\n1.0 Old name, only female included.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIridia\\'s first major priority will be enchanting her basic clothing and daggers. She has plenty of alchemical ingredients to make three different knock-out poisons, but does not have any filled soul gems. To get the best filled gems you\\'ll need to kill some humanoids.\r\n\r\nWorking out of Falkreath for a while will give you some practice at pickpocketing and poisoning, meanwhile reaping souls, without marring your reputation with the folks back home. \r\n\r\nIf harvesting souls in town, or a crowded dungeon for that matter, a dagger enchanted with Soul Trap is more stealthy than casting the spell, which will both cause aggro and draw attention. Pickpocketed slow-acting poisons can kill without doing either, but to collect the soul requires a quick jab from an enchanted dagger.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOnly the minimum required questing and exploration was done to acquire Breezehome.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\\\"Veterans\\\" are pre-built characters, skilled and equipped in tune with the limitations of their level\\'s experience. Their Skyrim remains unexplored and the quests undone.\r\n\r\nTaken Veterans should look good with any texture or mesh mods you may use, if any. The mods used in the screenshots include:\r\nFace Textures (Female): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3563]Coverwomen[/url]\r\nFace Textures (Male): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=26]Detailed Faces[/url]\r\n\r\nLook in the discussions area for the batch commands allowing you to make your own veteran characters!\r\n\r\nMore Info:\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Experience Table[/url]\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimCharBatch]Tips on making your own veterans[/url]\r\n\r\nDrop a Taken Veteran save game in your Saves folder and load it up. See what you think!\r\n",
