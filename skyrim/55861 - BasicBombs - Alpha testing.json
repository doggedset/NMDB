  "summary": "Brief:\r<br />Here is just a simple, mostly &#34;bugless&#34; (none that i have seen) mod that I have made, which in its most simple state adds a throw-able tomato bomb. I know it sounds stupid but it is just a dummy so that the size of the object is symbolic of the ideal size of the final version. But to the point, this mod is simply here for publi",
  "descriptionHtml": "The tomato bomb I have made is pretty basic and simply uses an arrow projectile, from a spell/scroll, to &#39;lob&#39; it as if it is thrown. The bomb itself only does one thing and creates an &#39;Explosive gas trap&#39; that is primarily there for making a trap against pyromancers and torch-wielders. But aside from this it does nothing special, although this effect is useful for testers to see if the bomb is working.\r<br />\r<br />What I need you, the modding community, to do is to check the mod out and play test it. Check if the projectile: is too slow, has too much gravity, has too long of a timer, look/acts funny, is bugging out, needs improvement, etc. Also if any testers have any good ideas for other bombs to make then please comment them to me.\r<br />Lastly, don&#39;t expect much because the mod is in its crappy state and is only here so that i can improve the basics of it as best I can.\r<br />\r<br />Testing Info:\r<br />Where to find it: in the console put in &#39;coc BBTESTCELL&#39;\r<br />Where to respond: In the comments\r<br />",
