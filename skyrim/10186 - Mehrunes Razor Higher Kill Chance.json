  "modName": "Mehrunes Razor Higher Kill Chance",
  "summary": "Raises the Instant Kill chance of Mehrune\\'s Razor to a level of your choice.",
  "descriptionHtml": "After hundreds of play hours, I\\'ve come to the conclusion that Mehrune\\'s Razor isn\\'t very useful. Hundreds of battles and countless swings, and I barely scored an instant kill on anything. So I decided to fix it.\r\n\r\nI have modified the enchantment script to increase the Instant Kill chance from 1% to between 2% and 10%. I personally use 5%. In my testing, wherein I slaughtered all of Riverwood a dozen times, I scored about 9 or 10 instant kills. Much more satisfying and, in my opinion, not overpowered all things considered.\r\n\r\n...of course, if you\\'re looking for overpowered, it was just as easy to change the kill chance to 100%. This version is, naturally, broken as all Oblivion. But maybe you\\'ve heard one too many comments about arrows and lollygagging and missing sweetrolls that you just need to [b][color=red]SLAUGHTER EVERY THRICE-DAMNED NORD IN THE ENTIRE PROVINCE![/color][/b] ...If that\\'s the case, you\\'ll like the super-cheat version.\r\n\r\n[b]Update![/b] There is now an option to grant the Mehrunes\\' Razor the ability to kill essential NPC\\'s! This option will work on any percentage offered. Tired of Ulfric being a dick? Want to take General Tullius down a notch? Eager to give that little n\\'wah Rolff Stone-Fist a view of his own intestines? Enable the \\'Kill Essential\\' option and give them a taste of the Razor!\r\nNote that this does not actually change their status as essential. No other weapon will kill an essential NPC, nor will merely combat kill them. It has to be the instant kill chance that does it, as the killing of essentials without removing their essential status is handled via the script.\r\n\r\n[u][b]INSTALLATION:[/b][/u]\r\nI have set everything up in a Nexus Mod Manager Package, so please use that for installation. If you insist on a manual install, then copy over one of the scripts found in the scripts folder to the scripts directory in your Skyrim/data directory. Remove the number so that the script is called CD_MehrunesRazorMagicEffectScript.pex. Copy over only one of the esp files. The esp with 100 in the title is meant to be used with the 100% script, but either esp will work with any script.\r\n\r\n[u][b]NOTES:[/b][/u]\r\nThis mod changes only the script which controls the Instant Kill effect. As such, it should not affect nor be affected by any other mod. Any alternate textures or weapon fixes will not be affected nor will they affect this mod. Only something that alters the actual Enchantment script will conflict, and I don\\'t think there is a mod that does that.\r\n\r\nThis mod does not affect the vanilla script, but rather installs a rewrite that the dagger uses instead. So if you don\\'t like it, it will not affect your game in any way.\r\n\r\nHappy killing!\r\n\r\n[u][b]NOTE:[/b][/u]\r\nWith the new 1.4.26 Patch, the load order system for the game has changed. If it appears that the mod isn\\'t having any effect at all, check the plugins.txt file and move the mod down to the bottom of the list. [url=\\\"http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showtopic=583662&st=0\\\"]More information can be found here.[/url]\r\n\r\n[u][b]ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:[/b][/u]\r\nMy Khajiit killer in the pics is wearing armor from the excellent [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4708]Triss Armor Retextured[/url] mod. The dagger is custom skinned with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2209]Darky Mehrunes Razor Retextured[/url]. Thanks to both authors for their top-notch work! Neither work is in my mod whatsoever, I\\'m just a happy user of those files.",
