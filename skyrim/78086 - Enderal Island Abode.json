I know it&#39;s only just recently come out and i have put over 45 hours into the mod already&#33; and have only got as far as the &#34;Ark&#34; i figured id give creating a house mod a try. The island Abode is an epic island filled with mystery and open isolation. You can see from the pictures how awesome this truly will become. It&#39;s still currently a WIP V0.1 I have previously modded for Skyrim however i haven&#39;t released a single file yet However  seeing how advanced and uniquely built Enderal is compared to Skyrimi figured id challenge myself to build something that i believe can improve your experience. Id like show you my progress. \r<br />\r<br />Located at Riverville across from the bay&#33;\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s still a long way from being completed. The mod is entirely handcrafted by myself as is the exterior and environment. My intentions to include in the mod are:\r<br />\r<br />*All crafting facilities - Done\r<br />*Categorized sorting chests & storage - Linked Storage Done, There are storage chest but limited will be fixed asap.\r<br />*0 Goditems im afraid this is just a generic housing/mansion/possibly castle in the future: mod\r<br />*Myrad trasport to and from the island abode. -\r<br />*Every room in the house will be unique and hand crafted using a handplaced template -\r<br />*Master bedroom\r<br />*Farm\r<br />*Harbour/Dock\r<br />*Boat Transport\r<br />*Fenced/Defence Tower\r<br />*Massive Categorized Vault to store your loot\r<br />*Access to Riverville via either a dock or possibly using a bridge\r<br />*Walkway to the top of the mountain for the scenery&#33;\r<br />*Shared Storage chests used in the game themselves to connect your items to each major city & area.\r<br />*Alot more extensive plans in the works also, please feel free to comment what you&#39;d like me to add/what you&#39;d like to see included in Enderal\r<br />and i&#39;ll see if i can do my best to include the mod&#33; I&#39;m hoping to have a V1.0 release within a few weeks, however i&#39;ll be frequently adding in photos during my progress.\r<br />\r<br />Regards, Immy.",
