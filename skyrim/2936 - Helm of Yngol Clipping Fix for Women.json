  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very simple mod that I made for myself so that my character could wear the Helm of Yngol without her hair clipping through the back of it. However, I thought that it would be nice to share.\r\n\r\nThere\\'s still a [i]slight[/i] clipping issue on the sides, but it\\'s much less noticeable than it was before.\r\n\r\nPlease don\\'t ask if I can fix the slight clipping issue that remains -- I can\\'t. That would involve editing the mesh, and I have no knowledge of how to do that. This is a simple mesh swap mod.\r\n\r\n",
