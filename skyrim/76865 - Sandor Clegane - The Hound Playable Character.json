This is still a work in progress and the template will be updated, yes i am aware that it doesnt look exactly like him but it will be updated. feedback would be appreciated as to help me make this better. Thanks and enjoy &#33;\r<br />\r<br />Note this mod requires:\r<br />-Race Menu\r<br />-SKSE\r<br />IT WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DONT HAVE THESE INSTALLED AS OF CUSTOM TEXTURES THESE MODS PROVIDE",
