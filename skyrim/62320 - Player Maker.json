  "descriptionHtml": "Sometimes I like to play Skyrim for just the stories and skip worrying about building a character using the traditional leveling system. These BAT files are what I use to completely subvert the Skyrim leveling system.\r<br />\r<br />Contents:\r<br />player - The base file for building a character\r<br />sbooks - Adds all skill books to the player&#39;s inventory\r<br />player2 - Sets all skills to 100\r<br />\r<br />How it works: \r<br />-Execute the player.txt file\r<br />-Make all skills legendary\r<br />-Execute the sbooks.txt file and read the skill books until a level is gained\r<br />-Execute the player2.txt file\r<br />-Apply perks as desired\r<br />\r<br />This ensures most level triggered quests are active with the exception of \r<br />the Ebony Warrior quest added by the Dragonborn DLC, which you need to be level 80 to start.\r<br />You may want to talk to Mjoll before gaining a level as well. That quest won&#39;t trigger until the player gains a level after initial dialogue\r<br />with her.\r<br />\r<br />Commands: bat player\r<br />                bat sbooks\r<br />                bat player2\r<br />\r<br />I recommend using Arthmoor&#39;s Alternate Start - Live Another Life mod with this.\r<br />Can be found here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/?",
