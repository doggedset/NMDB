  "descriptionHtml": "Warning you MUST have Racial Compatibility for this mod to work \r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24898/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Make sure this mod is not loaded before Racial Compatibility or it will crash your game. \r<br />\r<br />2nd Skyrim mod. This time I wanted to mess around with making a race that can wear armor. So I decided I wanted to try it with the falmer. \r<br />\r<br />Right now the Evolved Falmer can equip most armor that does not show skin. Because I have to recreate those armors to fit the falmer, which I will eventually. \r<br />I heavily edited the falmers mesh to become a playable race in 3ds max, so you should have no problems playing as one of these fugly elves, since they should move like the player character. \r<br />\r<br />I had no one to test it, so please report any bugs you find. \r<br />\r<br />My story for these guys, well based on a Dawnguard quest it is said the falmer are slowly becoming more intelligent, I guess they&#39;re a very slightly \r<br />evolved and more intelligent type of falmer, that is all I got really. I worked so hard on this mod that my brain is practically mush now. x.x\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-This mod comes with a follower, a mute falmer wearing DB robes named Geldur. He is a very skilled frost spellsword located in the ratway in Riften. He starts at lv 10 so beware he may be a bit too powerful when you first ask him to follow, if you&#39;re not at that level yet. \r<br />\r<br />-The evolved Falmer come with a spell called heightenedSenses. If you tap it slightly it allows you to see in the dark, and turn it on and off at will. Holding down the spell will detect enemies nearby. \r<br />\r<br />-They are 50 percent resistent to frost \r<br />\r<br />-You are able to get a edited piece of falmer armor from crafting it located in the hide tab or getting one out of Geldur&#39;s inventory. This armor was made specifically for evolved falmer only, so no other race can wear it. \r<br />\r<br />Future updates I will slowly make more of the armors that can&#39;t be equipped by the falmer or at least become visible. The evolved Falmer can wear most boots, robes, and hoods. I would like to eventually try to make others attack this race on sight but alas I don&#39;t have knowledge on making factions. So maybe one day once I figure it out.Also might make a Dawnguard/Dragonborn version eventually. \r<br />\r<br />There is no female option yet. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Be careful when when wearing certain items. Circlets, possibly necklaces, iron, leather, hide, some casual clothes, and steel armor might cause crashing on some computers. Since they are not edited to fit the falmer yet. If it doesn&#39;t crash then it should just only appear invisible.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to play as the Falmer race. Start a new game, do not use &#34;showracemenu&#34; console command or it will crash your game sometimes.Not sure why the showracemenu console command is crashing games but it just does for some reason.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Update\r<br />\r<br />-Can now turn into a vampire. \r<br />-More armor and clothing can be worn, including non-dawnguard falmer armor pieces. However Steel armor is bugged and needs to be fixed.\r<br />\r<br />Next update\r<br />\r<br />-possibility of more selection of traits to choose from in character creation menu. \r<br />-More armor to wear\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Warning the vampire Falmer will not work right with  extra playable skeletons race mod. When contracting vampirism, you will turn into a skeleton instead.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Steam version http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=380311575\r<br />\r<br />Other skyrim mods http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=330832765",
