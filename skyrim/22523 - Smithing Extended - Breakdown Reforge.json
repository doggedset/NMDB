  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE (December 28th, 2013) - Personal Update\r<br />\r<br />I know that I haven&#39;t been active in this community for quite some time, but I would like that to change.  I installed a clean version of windows not too long ago (and lost all installed programs) but I plan on downloading the creation kit this week to finally CONTINUE PROGRESS on Dragonborn and Dawnguard integration and fix those pesky jewelry bugs.\r<br />P.S. - I hope you all had a wonderful holiday season and a great time in Tamriel while I was gone&#33;\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE (July 1st, 2013) - Final Vanilla Version, DLC Progress\r<br />\r<br />Although not functional now, support for Dawnguard and Dragonborn items are being processed as I type this. Wait for those in the next version, 1.4, coming somewhere during the next two months.\r<br />\r<br />Again, and as always, thanks for all the feedback and support.  Remember to click the &#34;track&#34; button to know when new releases are uploaded, and please endorse if you enjoy using the mod.\r<br />Keep sending your bug reports to me at bastump987@gmail.com and in the comments here if you wish, it helps with development and speeds up the releases.\r<br />\r<br />.::CHANGELOG::. (versions 1.2)\r<br />Added a new perk to the Smithing tree - &#34;Breakdown/Reforge&#34;\r<br />  -Requires 25 smithing and is needed to breakdown and reforge anything (added for more balance)\r<br />Added &#34;BREAKDOWN&#34; tab in the forge\r<br />  -Unfortunately, crafting tabs are hardcoded into the game, so this tab replaces the &#34;STUDDED&#34;\r<br />   one.  Studded armor can now be crafted in the LEATHER tab\r<br />\r<br />.::CHANGELOG::. (version 1.0)\r<br />Added Imperial Sword to breakdown list (I kinda neglected it&#39;s existence, sorry)\r<br />Added jewelry breakdown features (see instructions below)\r<br />\r<br />.::CHANGELOG::. (version 0.5)\r<br />\r<br />Added steel plate armor to breakdown list\r<br />Added Silver Sword and Silver Greatsword to breakdown list\r<br />Added ability to smelt coins into gold ingots (350:1)\r<br />Added imperial armor to breakdown list\r<br />\r<br />A big thanks to CloudDragon for his wonderful feedback&#33; \r<br />\r<br />This mod adds the ability to break down most weapons and armor in the game so you can make ingots of the core component at the smelter. This is how the process works:\r<br />\r<br />BREAKDOWN PROCESS\r<br />1) Find a weapon or piece of armor you would like to break down.\r<br />2) Take it to a forge and navigate to the category &#34;Misc&#34;.\r<br />3) You should see a huge list of possible recipes. Navigate to the ore type of the item you are breaking down and click &#34;craft&#34;. MAKE SURE it is the item you really do want to break down, and not your equipped gear (this happen one too many times during testing...)\r<br />4) You should get a certain number of ore fragments that can be used to reforge ingots.\r<br />\r<br />REFORGE PROCESS\r<br />1) Gather at least 5 fragments of one type.\r<br />2) Take the fragments to a smelter.\r<br />3) As you can see, there are two entries for most ingots: one to make ingots from ore, and one to make ingots from fragments. Highlight the fragment option and click &#34;craft&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />COINS-TO-GOLD\r<br />If you&#39;re really desperate for gold ingots, you can head on over to your nearest smelter and turn your &#34;unwanted&#34; coins into gold ingots for a ratio of 350:1. What a fantastic deal&#33;\r<br />BUT WAIT, THERE&#39;S MORE&#33;\r<br />Not really though.\r<br />\r<br />JEWELRY BREAKDOWN PROCESS\r<br />With update 1.0, it is now possible to breakdown jewelry to get your precious gems back&#33; To do this, just take the desired piece of jewelry to a forge, navigate to &#34;misc&#34;. After sorting through all the clutter my mod has created in that list, you should see a grouping of entries that read &#34;Items&#34;. These are the entries for jewelry breakdowns. To breakdown a specific piece of jewelry, scroll through these entries until you see the item you want in the &#34;requirements&#34; area. Just a tip, the entry will also be highlighted. When you click craft, the jewels required to craft the item will be added to your inventory, along with one fragment of the corresponding metal. That&#39;s all there is to it, enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Item Types Compatible With Breakdown/Reforge:\r<br />-Iron\r<br />-Steel\r<br />-Silver\r<br />-Dwarven\r<br />-Orcish\r<br />-Elven\r<br />-Glass\r<br />-Ebony\r<br />-Daedric\r<br />\r<br />Please feel free to rate and comment, this is only my second mod (and first serious one). Thanks for your time and I hope my mod improves your Skyrim experience&#33;",
