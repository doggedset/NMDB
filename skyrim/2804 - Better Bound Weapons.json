  "summary": "Adds two extra ranks to the mystic binding perk in the conjuration skill tree. Useful if you felt that the bound weapons became underpowered as you leveled up. Now there is a modular and non modular version so that the user can choose which bound weapons this mod affects, or the user can just download a single .esp which affects all the bound weapo",
  "descriptionHtml": "=========================================================================================\r\n[color=0000ff] I have been absent from the Nexus for quite some time. Apparently my mods do not work correctly with Dawnguard, so use at your own risk. I will not be updating my mods any time soon. Sorry for the inconvenience. If on the other hand you want to use these mods in your own projects or improve these mods, feel free. You do not need to ask me for permission. [/color]\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n[color=ffff00]Description:[/color]\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nThis mod will add two extra ranks to the mystic binding perk located in the conjuration skill tree. \r\n\r\nUseful for all those mages, conjurers, and spell swords who felt that they had to break character in order to smith a weapon that could actually protect them.\r\n\r\nThe exact effects on your bound weapons is dependent upon which .esp\\'s you have installed.\r\n\r\nBound Sword: MBSword.esp\r\n=====================================================================\r\nConjuration 20, rank1: 50% damage increase (base damage is 09)\r\nConjuration 50, rank2: 90% damage increase \r\nConjuration 80, rank3: 130% damage increase \r\n\r\nBound Axe: MBAxe.esp\r\n======================================================================\r\nConjuration 20, rank1: 50% damage increase (base damage is 17)\r\nConjuration 50, rank2: 80% damage increase \r\nConjuration 80, rank3: 110% damage increase \r\n\r\nBound Bow: MBBow.esp\r\n======================================================================\r\nConjuration 20, rank1: 50% damage increase (base damage is 18)\r\nConjuration 50, rank2: 70% damage increase \r\nConjuration 80, rank3: 90% damage increase \r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n[color=ffff00]To Install:[/color]\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\n[color=ff0000]Place \\\"MBMaster.esm\\\" into your Data folder. This must be loaded before .esp files.[/color]\r\n\r\nThen choose which other esp\\'s you want. If for example, you feel the bound bow is powerful enough already, don\\'t add \\\"MBBow.esp\\\" to your data folder. But if you feel the bound axe is too weak at higher levels, then add \\\"MBAxe.esp\\\" to your data folder.\r\n\r\nThen open up the skyrim launcher, click data files, and mark the check box located next to the files you want loaded and running when the game starts.\r\n\r\nYou may need to open the skyrimprefs.ini file and add the line \\\"bEnableFileSelection=1\\\" under [Launcher] without quotes if \\\"data files\\\" option in the launcher is greyed out and unselectable. Skyrimprefs is located in My Documents\\\\my games\\\\skyrim.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n[color=ffff00]Add Perks Through Console:[/color]\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nTo add or remove these perks via the console, type:\r\n\r\nhelp \\\"mystic binding\\\" 4\r\n\r\nThis will yield a list of things that contain the words mystic binding. Look for\r\n\r\nPERK: (XXXXXXXX) \\'Mystic Binding Y\\'\r\n\r\nwhere the X\\'s denote the form id and the Y denotes the mystic binding rank. You should see \\'Mystic Binding 2\\' and \\'Mystic Binding 3\\' now type:\r\n\r\nplayer.addperk XX33553f \r\n\r\nwhere the X\\'s are a random number that the game picks. This will add Mystic Binding 2 and then type player.addperk XX33b5d2 for Mystic Binding 3. (Of course don\\'t type the X\\'s replace those X\\'s with the numbers you got from the previous command) \r\n\r\nTo remove one of these perks, just do as above but use the command player.removeperk xxxxxxxx instead.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n[color=ffff00]To Uninstall:[/color]\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\n[b]You must follow these instructions exactly to ensure an error free game afterwords. Follow even if you want to reinstall this. Useful for uninstalling other mods too.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]1)[/b]\r\nIn your current save. Press [color=ff00ff]~[/color] to open the console. \r\n\r\n[b]2)[/b]\r\nType in [color=ff00ff]help \\\"mystic binding\\\" 4[/color] you will see a list of everything that is related to this mod accompanied by labels and hexadecimal numbers.\r\n\r\n[b]4)[/b]\r\nLook for [color=ff00ff]PERK: (000640B3) \\'Mystic Binding\\'[/color] and [color=ff00ff]PERK: (XXXXXXXX) \\'Mystic Binding 2\\'[/color] and  [color=ff00ff]PERK: (YYYYYYYY) \\'Mystic Binding 3\\'[/color]\r\n\r\n[b]5)[/b]\r\nType in [color=ff00ff]player.removeperk XXXXXXXX[/color] Press enter, then type in [color=ff00ff]player.removeperk YYYYYYYY[/color]\r\n\r\n[b]6)[/b]\r\nSave your game.\r\n\r\n[b]7)[/b]\r\nRemove MBMaster.esm, MBBow.esp, MBAxe.esp, and MBSword.esp from your Data folder\r\n\r\nDone\r\n\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n[color=ffff00]Known Bugs:[/color]\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nhopefully none now\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n[color=ffff00]Credits:[/color]\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n I would like to also thank the modding community in general for as being as active, helpful, and resourceful as they have been and also Bethesda for creating such a fun game. Special thanks to those users who haveuploaded their own .esp\\'s and posted tutorials.\r\n\r\nThankyou for downloading and please comment.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n[color=ffff00]Change Log:[/color]\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nv2.0\r\n*! Added all bound weapons. Made a modular and non modular version\r\n\r\nV2.1\r\n*! Fixed a bug where upon installation of this mod, bound spells had a prohibitively high magicka cost\r\n\r\n*! Removed all versions except v2.1 modular. All the different versions were giving me a headache.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n[color=ffff00]In the Pipeline:[/color]\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nI am currently quite busy unfortunately with schoolwork, so I will probably not be able to work on theses mods for a while.\r\n",
