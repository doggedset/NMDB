  "descriptionHtml": "Skyrim Dawnguard Edition: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21923/\r\n\r\nAdds a chest in the Whiterun\\'s Dragonsreach that allows you access to several items in an non-enchanted state.\r\n\r\nThese items are unaltered aside from their enchantments or \\'playable\\' status. The actual item is duplicated and the duplication is edited, not the original. It should not cause problems.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'d like to see more items please let me know which ones. I will do Weapons, Armor and Miscellaneous items. I will not change their magical attributes, nor will I make \\'God\\' items. Items which have a \\'Playable\\' status that is supposed to be turned off will likely cause graphical collision with other items, use them as you deem fit.\r\n\r\nDue to quite a few asking me, I have moved it to Whiterun\\'s Dragonreach because it is always availible to the player, and have left it unlocked to remove the annoyance of a locked chest. I hope you appreciate this. :)\r\n\r\nWARNING: This chest is set to refresh, which means it is NOT SAFE to place your own items in it. It WILL delete them.\r\n\r\nUpdate1(Added Several Deadric weapons by request)\r\nUpdate 2(Fixed the items so they can be upgraded on workbenches and Grindstones. Added Several enchantable Robes by request)\r\nUpdate 3(Fixed a bug where Mehrunes Razor is not enchantable)\r\nUpdate 4(Added the Savior\\'s Hide, Nightingale Bow and Blade by request)\r\nUpdate 5(Added Blade of Woe, Keening and the Dark brotherhood Shrouded Armor)\r\nUpdate 7(Chest moved to Dragonsreach of Whiterun, is now unlocked by default to make it more accessible, added all the Dragon Priest Helmets, Wooden Helmet requires Firewood to upgrade)\r\nUpdate 8(Added Thieves Guild regular armor)\r\nUpdate 9(Added the Short-Sleeve Shrouded Armor and the Blades armor for extra use by request)\r\nUpdate 10(Added Dawnbreaker - Released a Dawnguard separate version)\r\n\r\nAgain, if you have any requests or bugs please let me know!\r\n\r\nItems currently in:\r\nA full un-enchanted set of Nightingale armor, Blade and the Bow\r\nThe Jagged Crown\r\nA Black Hood\r\nUn-enchanted Mythic Dawn Robes (hooded and hood-less)\r\nA full un-enchanted set of Thieves Guild Master armor and regular armor.\r\nUn-enchanted Thalmor robes (Hooded and Hood-less)\r\nA full un-enchanted set of Dark Brotherhood Shrouded Armor and the Short-Sleeve chest.\r\nDawnbreaker (Un-Enchanted)\r\nVolendrung (Un-Enchanted)\r\nRueful Axe (Un-Enchanted)\r\nMehrunes Razor (Un-Enchanted)\r\nMace of Molag (Un-Enchanted)\r\nSavior\\'s Hide (Un-Enchanted)\r\nSpellbreaker (Un-Enchanted)\r\nShield of Ysgramor(Un-Enchanted)\r\nHelm of Yngol (Un-Enchanted)\r\nBlade of Woe (Un-Enchanted)\r\nKeening (Un-Enchanted)\r\nSeveral different robes/hoods (including the Shrouded Robes and Psijic Robes)\r\nDragon Priest Helmets\r\n\r\nPlease note: The Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild armor sets require that you actually completed the quest that you would normally need to do before you can upgrade them on the workbench. The Short Sleeve Shoruded armor is heavy by default this is not my doing, I renamed it to \\'Heavy Shrouded Armor\\' to tell the difference.\r\n---\r\n\r\nYour soulbound chest is your gateway to otherworldy objects, that you could only dream of obtaining! But with access to great power, comes great responsibility! Well... not really. Since these are not objects of great power!\r\n\r\n\r\nFar within the depths of this chest lay objects that already exist in your world, Nirn! The only thing that is unique with these particular collectables: YOU can actually use them! That\\'s right! Yo--What\\'s that? You can already use some of these!? Well YOU can enchant them with YOUR own enchants! How about that? Huh? You can already enchant some of them? Well then it makes it easier to get ANOTHER SET OF IT!\r\n\r\n\r\nThough this chest contains these items, it should be noted that you should not place your own within this chest. It appears that this chest has the ability to \\'refresh\\' itself. Placing it in a previous state of fullness! Your items will be utterly and irreversibly destroyed and the particles will be use to re-create what the chest desires. YOU\\'VE BEEN WARNED! MWAHAHAHAHAHA! Sorry. Yelling makes me laugh hysterically and I\\'m in the process of writing down everything I say magically... So that\\'s how it ended up on this page. Enjoy the Centurion Dynamo on me.",
