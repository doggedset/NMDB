  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a quick and easy fix to enable some controller support for Dev Aveza by Deaprie.\r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24234/?\r<br />\r<br />Basically you&#39;re going to need Xpadder\r<br />\r<br />http://xpadder.com/\r<br />\r<br />You can get it there.  It&#39;s a utility to enable controller support by mapping keyboard and mouse controls to the controller.  Just load this setting into Xpadder and DO NOT CHANGE any of the controls in Dev Aveza and you should be able to use this wonderful mod without having to switch from controller to the keyboard and mouse.\r<br />\r<br />Once you&#39;ve loaded up this file in Xpadder, just load up Skyrim and start playing.  Everything should be the same for the controller as you have it set outside of using Dev Aveza, but when you activate the wheel, you can pilot the ship with your controller.  Be sure to make the player stationary.  I haven&#39;t tested the controls to enable both flight and movement on the deck and I&#39;m guessing it simply will not work.  Admittedly, this will have some limitations.\r<br />\r<br />Known issues:\r<br />\r<br />Because the controller has limited buttons, this will cause a couple of odd instances while flying.  Things such as bashing with your bow or shield or weapon when you go down with the ship or maybe even going through the attack when going up.  Flying the boat around is going to have a slight headbob motion because the left stick is mapped to both walking around and of course flying the shit.  But these instances were really minimal and didn&#39;t seem to ruin the mod.  \r<br />\r<br />Controls:\r<br />\r<br />Left thumb stick -steer, reverse, and accelerate\r<br />\r<br />Right thumb stick -camera control\r<br />\r<br />Press left thumb stick - Dismount ship\r<br />\r<br />D-pad Up - Cruise Control\r<br />\r<br />D-pad Down - Hand brake\r<br />\r<br />Left and Right Bumpers - Strafe left and right\r<br />\r<br />Left trigger - descend\r<br />\r<br />Right trigger - Ascend ",
