  "descriptionHtml": "===ALPHA===\r<br />\r<br />Disclaimer:\r<br />In this mod the quest is the minority of the mod, You will find notes and books and I hope that people have some intuitiveness and will read these and go off on your own accord to investigate and reap the rewards of your curiosity.\r<br />\r<br />1. Info\r<br />2. Future plans\r<br />3. Requirements\r<br />\r<br />-Info-\r<br />\r<br />&#34;A small quest line that I plan on expanding. A Witch hunter mysteriously disappeared years ago. When you run into her husband gone insane with grief he points to a mysterious dungeon, enter at your own peril and be warned, dark forces have been known to reside within the dungeon.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />A fully voice acted with custom made armour that is open ended and allows for choices with different rewards tailored for your decision. I plan on making more quests on top of this to really delve deep into the somewhat &#34;lacking&#34; evil side of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Outside of Markarth a &#34;Crazy man&#34; is encamped, approach him and ask about his wife to start the quest. The  dungeon is further down the road.\r<br />\r<br />-Future plans-\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;d like to finish the quest then work on extras like 2 followers which will spawn depending on how you finish the quest. And powerful abilities given by deities and try-hard deities (points at mannimarco) \r<br />\r<br />We are still waiting on the textures and voices so please bear that in mind\r<br />\r<br />-Requirements-\r<br />Just the base skyrim as up to date as possible",
