Also, DELETE your old Castlevania Demo and it&#39;s bsa  to have the bug fixed version working. Also try not to have many mods installed, it worked for many people. If you are still experiencing crashes, it must be a conflict with other mods, try checking with Wrye Smash or any other programm you like.\r<br />\r<br />************************************\r<br />ChangeLog:\r<br />************************************\r<br />\r<br />-Fixed the bugs with Germain not speaking properly or speaking twice.\r<br />-Fixed the Skeleton Blazes and their effects.\r<br />-Fixed the Important items but not the Hp, Parameter Max Up. They stuck in your inventory but you can drop them. The powers are not dispelling if you do so.\r<br />-Fixed the wall section.\r<br />-Now we can leave the Abandoned Castle from the elevator. You will be teleported back to Riverwood.\r<br />-The rooms are now working properly, so you will not see a floating room.\r<br />\r<br />************************************\r<br />Author: LordKarnak\r<br />************************************\r<br />\r<br />************************************\r<br />Featured in Week 32 weekly mods by MxR:\r<br />************************************\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]eJf9I2xoAkA[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />************************************\r<br />Before we start, you could watch those videos to have a better idea of what this mod is offering:\r<br />************************************\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]3cCcbvKQA5s[/youtube]  [youtube]WlppLOMV9sU[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />************************************ \r<br />Walkthoughs:\r<br />************************************\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]UWJI373B6Fc[/youtube]  [youtube]jrvuUy774qE[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]WZSCUxpjJpE[/youtube]  [youtube]4Gr1aywmJFs[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />And a Spanish walkthrough:\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]SzV6vfM2vUc[/youtube]  [youtube]WQMzTa5fvm8[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]2cAEN29MdGY[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />************************************\r<br />Quest Start Up\r<br />************************************\r<br />Notice that you should be at least at level 15 or higher to overcome the mod even with some potions or healing spells.

Better to go from the pathway to avoid a broken scene.\r<br />\r<br />-When you fight the boss, stay away from his attacks if you are in low level. He casts a fire breath which is perfect opportunity to attack him.\r<br />\r<br />-When you have been ambushed by many enemies, try to maintain your stamina, because a low stamina makes you harder to move especially if frozen.\r<br />\r<br />-Try not to hurry. There may be something useful you missed.\r<br />************************************\r<br />Hope everything is fine and game reads the files with no problem.\r<br />\r<br />*About the vocals and the clothes I added, they will not be the standard for the full version.
