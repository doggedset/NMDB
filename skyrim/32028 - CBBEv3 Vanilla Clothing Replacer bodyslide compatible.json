  "modName": "CBBEv3 Vanilla Clothing Replacer bodyslide compatible",
  "summary": "A mod to replace all clothing within the game with some sexier variants. Similar in concept to maks armor set. Currently a work in progress. A portion has been replaced and additional bodyslide sliders coming soon.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The body is based on a smaller variant of CBBE I created in body slide. The bodyslide compatibility will allow anyone to change the mesh to suit there own desired body. As of now it is in the Beta stages and will be updated, hopefully, on a regular basis, no guarantees. Right now there are 2 sliders for each item, more to come as I update. I have been overly busy with staying alive. I will be getting back to this at some point soon.\r\n\r\nCurrently Replaced\r\nBarkeeper Clothes\r\nBeggars Clothes\r\nBlacksmith\\'s Apron\r\nChef\\'s Tunic\r\nFarm Clothes 2\r\nFarm Clothes 3\r\nFarm Clothes 4\r\nMerchant Clothes\r\nMiner Clothes\r\nTavern Clothes\r\n\r\nStill to be done:\r\n1st Person mesh changes\r\nFarm Clothes 1\r\nYarl Clothes 1\r\nYarl Clothes 2\r\nYarl Clothes 3\r\nFine Clothes 1\r\nFine Clothes 2\r\nWedding Dress\r\n\r\nRequired Mods:\r\nCBBE V3 Caliente\\'s Big Bottom Edition (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666)\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\nNext Version(ETA 8-15-13:\r\nAdd Yarl Clothes and Farm Clothes 1\r\nFixes for clipping with certain bodyslide settings(noticed problems with certain settings for both breast and butt, will fix this before adding additional sliders.)\r\n\r\nFurther down the line\r\nWedding Dress\r\n1st person meshes\r\nOptional Files for less skimpy clothes ie skirts etc.\r\nAdditional Sliders in bodyslide\r\n\r\nV0.6 Beta\r\nInitial Upload\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\nCaliente for the mod which this is based on.\r\nMak07 for his armor mod.
