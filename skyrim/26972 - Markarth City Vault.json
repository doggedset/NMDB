  "summary": "Adds a small vault to Understone Keep in Markarth. Not finished yet, but navmesh is done, lighting needs finetuning. Clutter is partially done. NEEDS GUARD PATROLS. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This adds a wip vault to understone keep. You should need a high sneak to get past the original guards, so loot is balanced for what you would already find just by exploring the caves & dungeons around Markarth, and the surrounding area. Nothing magical, and little in the way of high level armor or weapons that you wouldn\\'t be able to find by going into the local dwemer ruins. ",
