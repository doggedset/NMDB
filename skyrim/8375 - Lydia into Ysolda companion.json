  "descriptionHtml": "[color=green]UPDATE: I no longer support this mod, since I made it a long time ago. You can try it with newer versions of SKYRIM , though people are reporting floatings heads etc. If it doesn&#39;t seem to work, just uninstall it.\r<br />\r<br />I may do a new version of this in 2014, just a bit rusty when it comes to the CK.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />This replaces Lydia with Ysolda of Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />REQUIRES:\r<br />\r<br />1. A mod that hide helmets, otherwise you won&#39;t see her face. Like this one: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6515\r<br />\r<br />2. Lovely Hairstyles by sn00p : http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7403\r<br />\r<br />3. Optional: If you want Ysolda to look EXACTLY as in the pictures. Open up the file &#34;Cheeks, Lips, Eyebrows.rar&#34; and install IN ORDER like the folders are numbered (1. followed by 2.)  Warning: This WILL affect all your default females in-game&#33; Also, you must clean out all other facial female mods (like Bella&#39;s Females, Coverwomen, and similar mods). \r<br />\r<br />(Her blue eyes would depend on your particular eye replacer. I recommend:) http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869\r<br />\r<br />Want to change her armor in your current save? Look here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9161\r<br />\r<br />_______________________________________________________\r<br />Hair ref. = HairFemaleNord11. Essential: Yes.\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~INSTALL~~~~~~~~\r<br />\r<br />Drag & drop to Data folder, activate .esp.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~DESCRIPTION~~~~~~~~\r<br />\r<br />Please note that if you already met Lydia in-game, she will wear her normal armor & weapons. Either you can start over, or equip/unequip her items in console. Her items is bound to your Save file. (Another option is to replace Lydia&#39;s standard armor).\r<br />\r<br />Easiest thing is just to make a new game and meet the new Lydia, and she will apear like she does in the pictures. \r<br />\r<br />Why this mod? I wanted the lovely Ysolda at my side instead of Lydia. Her voice, walk animation, body scale, etc... No longer Lydia. She is Ysolda now&#33;\r<br />\r<br />- Legolas light... she shoots bit better than original Lydia.\r<br />\r<br />- &#34;Real&#34; Ysolda NPC is still in the game. I recommend killing her for immersion.  (Quick fix: click her in console, &#34;tcl&#34;, fly off to behind a building or something... type &#34;moveto player&#34;, dispose her body... yay&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />GEAR: Her face, voice & body animation will still import into your current Save. But inventory is dependent on your Save file.\r<br />\r<br />If you load a Save right after you killed the dragon and spoke to the Jarl, Ysolda spawns with the following Default gear:\r<br />\r<br />- Blades armor\r<br />- Elven sword\r<br />- Hunting Bow \r<br />\r<br />Like in the pictures.\r<br />_______________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Q: &#34;She doesn&#39;t look like in the pictures&#33;&#33;&#33;&#34;\r<br />\r<br />A: She will look like Ysolda. Her face is Ysolda NPC face + HairFemaleNord11. Will look different depending on your mods. \r<br />\r<br />Q: &#34;omg what is this&#33;&#33;&#33; It crashes my game&#33;&#33;&#34;\r<br />\r<br />A: Should be working 100%. Just delete the .esp to uninstall. Doesn&#39;t overwrite anything.\r<br />\r<br />Q: &#34;I don&#39;t want to restart just to change her gear...&#34;\r<br />\r<br />A: Get this: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9161\r<br />\r<br />",
