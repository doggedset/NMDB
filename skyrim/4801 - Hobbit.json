  "descriptionHtml": "==HOBBIT GAME SAVE== by WartyX\r\n\r\nHobbits have been living and farming around Riverwood for many hundreds of years, quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk. Tamriel being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count, Hobbits must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors nor counted among the very wise...\r\n\r\nIn fact, it has been remarked by some that Hobbits\\' only real passion is for Alchemy. A rather unfair observation, as they have also developed a keen interest in One-Handed, Archery, Lockpick and Pickpocket.\r\n\r\nBut where their hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet and good bit of Sneaking around.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, no doubt to others, their ways seem quaint. But today of all days, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life!\r\n\r\n===WHAT IS THIS?===\r\n\r\nIt\\'s a basic savegame in which a Level 1 Breton has been modified to have the appearance and attributes of a Hobbit, as seen in Lord of the Rings and other Middle-Earth and Tolkien works.\r\n\r\n\r\n===INSTALLATION===\r\n\r\nSimply copy the .ess file into My Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves\r\n\r\n\r\n===DETAILS===\r\n\r\nYour character starts at 0.75 the height** of a normal character in Riverwood with 500 gold to start you off.\r\n\r\nSkill modifiers:\r\n\r\nAlchemy: \t+10\r\nArchery:\t+5\r\nOne Handed:\t+5\r\nSneak:\t\t+5\r\nLockpick:\t+5\r\nPickpocket:\t+5\r\n\r\n**According to Tolkien\\'s lore, Hobbit height should correctly be approximately 0.61. However, I felt this was too small. You can change this if you wish by going into the Console and typing: player.setscale 0.61",
