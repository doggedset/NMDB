  "summary": "Small change to make daedric weapons more powerful than dragonbone weapons.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'ve been playing the series for a while and it irked me that Bethesda added in dragonbone weapons that are stronger than daedric weapons, which doesn\\'t fit within established lore that Bethesda recognized by making daedric armor stronger than dragonbone armor. So, I flipped daedric and dragonbone weapon stats to make daedric weapons the strongest in the game. This is a very small mod that I\\'ve been using for a while and I thought I should upload it to help anyone else who had the same problem. It requires Dawnguard and is likely incompatible with mods that change daedric and dragonbone weapons, including arrows.",
