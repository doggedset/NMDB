  "summary": "This is a retexture/redesign for Chillrend to make it look nice and frosty and icy.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod project for Skyrim. I\\'ve been wanting to get involved in modding for quite awhile, and I thought a first good project for me would be to do a retexture and redesign for the sword Chillrend.\r\n\r\nWhen I got the sword, I was disappointed to find that it was just a glass sword that was blue instead of green. I thought it would be cool to actually make it look icy and frosty, so it looked different and unique. I then decided it would be cool to have some parts see-through like real ice. I think it looks great for the most part, though there are some lighting situations where it looks strange (in intense direct sunlight and in very dark interiors), but 90% of the time it looks great.\r\n\r\nThough I do have a 2D art background, I consider myself a novice at 3D and texturing (particularly normal maps). If I get better at working with normal maps, I\\'ll be sure to update the sword, but in the meantime I think it looks great, and hope you do too.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, enjoy the new texture and design for Chillrend! Keep a lookout for any other mods release by me in the next few weeks, I have some projects in mind.\r\n\r\n************************************\r\n\r\nUpdate 3/7: I\\'m requesting some feedback on anyone who downloads the new version 2.0. Basically I changed the lighting properties on the weapon (which I did on my glass weapon and armor mods as well) so it\\'ll start showing shadows on the weapon, rather than be constantly in direct sunlight. It\\'ll also now be lit up by indoor light sources such as fires. The problem is the shadows can look kind of weird sometimes, as it shows the shadows of objects BEHIND the blade. In my opinion, it looks fine 95% of the time, but I\\'d like to hear from anyone else on whether they prefer Version 1.3\\'s lighting properties or the new one. I also cleaned up the seam a bit, though the black line is still there, and added a subtle glow to the gem. Thanks!\r\n\r\nUpdate 3/14: Decided to go back to 1.2 as the main file, as I felt the shadow problems from 2.0 were worse than the lighting problems from 1.2, I\\'ve kept 2.0 as a \\\"beta\\\" version. Feel free to try both and use whichever you prefer. Any more feedback I can get on which version you prefer would be great.\r\n\r\n************************************\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\nV 2-0 Beta: Fixes some of the lighting issues, though adds a weird shadow problem.\r\nV 1-2: Cleans up the seam slightly (black line is still there unfortunately) and adds a slight glow to the gem.\r\nV 1-1: Changes the lighting properties from green to icy blue.\r\nV 1-0: Initial Release\r\n\r\nUpdate: Craftable_Chillrend released under the optional files section. This will allow you to create Chillrend at the Skyforge with the required components: 1 Ingot-Moonstone, 1 Ingot-Malachite, 1 Leather Strip, and 1 Void Salts- Frost. It also requires that you have the Glass Smithing perk.\r\n\r\nI\\'m working on making a craftable version that doesn\\'t have enchantments on it, but I\\'m running into a problem where I can make it, but it\\'s not enchantable, which defeats the whole point of it not having enchantments. If I figure it out I\\'ll release it as another optional file.\r\n\r\n************************************\r\n\r\nPLEASE CHECK OUT MY OTHER MODS:\r\n\r\nREAL Glass Weapons with Realistic Transparency: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9892\r\nREAL Glass Armor and Shields with Realistic Transparency: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10751\r\n\r\n************************************",
