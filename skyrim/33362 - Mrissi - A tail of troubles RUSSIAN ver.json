Just walk in and hear some talks.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />At first I was planning to do a catgirl comedy, but the story happens to became more serious, lorefriendly and sometimes sad. There are still \r<br />some cat jokes, though.\r<br />\r<br />She has a personality (curious and a little selfish, as a cat. She was born as a khajiit after all. But she has a little more catlike behavior \r<br />than a usual khajiit) and will comment world interactions.\r<br />\r<br />She is essential, will not become hostile forever even after several friendly fire accidents, and will not set off the traps. Also she has a \r<br />unique mount to ride.\r<br />Her skills are (or more likely will be, after the quests) light armor and archery. And a bit of onehanded.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Mod is marked adult-only for some dark story moments and for her textures.\r<br />(You will be able to change her clothes after earning her trust. NOTE: she will not be happy about going around naked)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[color=yellow][u]{Translations}[/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34794]English version[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41211]German version[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[color=yellow][u]{Features}[/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Unique follower with her own dialogues and quests (and yes, you can loose and get a bad ending).\r<br />[*] She is using UNP slim body with custom textures.\r<br />[*] Full voicing.\r<br />[*] About 6-15 hours of gameplay, depending on your game progress.\r<br />[*] World commentaries about places and game events, including ones from dragonborn and dawnguard.\r<br />[*] Custom follower system, will not clash with vanilla and other companions and quests.\r<br />[*] Unique tiger mount, she will ride when you are.
