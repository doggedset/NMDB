  "descriptionHtml": "After being a bit agitated by the lack of decent looking mage gear, I decided to create a simple mod to allow purchase of enchantable Nightingale Armor. I included 10 sets of the armor (probably way overkill but I often mess up armor while enchanting it). I created this for myself but then thought maybe others would like to use it as well so I am sharing it with you all.\r<br />\r<br />The vendor &#34;Khaleesi Mage Vendor&#34; can be found at The Frozen Hearth in Winterhold.Â ",
