  "descriptionHtml": "Humour in Skyrim?\r\n\r\nThis mod is what I call a direct affront to the drab, dingy, colourless, and humourless \r\nworld of Skyrim.\r\n\r\nWe tried to make it the least \\\"immersion-damaging\\\" as possible.  The content introduced in \r\nall probability never existed in historical times similar to SKyrim...but it COULD have \r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nThis is probably not a mod to be retained as a permanent mod, but we had fun making it and \r\nthought we would share it anyway.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not going to spoil the mod by giving everything away.  But with this mod installed the \r\nplayer encounters various billboards along the roads of Skyrim advertising \\\"unusual\\\" \r\nproducts and where they can be obtained.\r\n\r\nSIDENOTE:  This mod does have a gay reference.  My roommate (who designed it) is gay and \r\nfelt it was appropriate.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nINSTALLING/UNINSTALLING\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nInstalling follows the usual procedure of unpacking with \\\"7-zip\\\" (or similar), and dragging \r\nand dropping the contents of the mod into your \\\"....skyrim/data/\\\" folder.  \r\n\r\nOr a mod manager can be used.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, delete the files (listed below) installed by the mod.  Or use your mod manager \r\nif it supports uninstalling.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nFILES\r\n==========================\r\nSkyrimHumour.esp\r\nmeshes/clutter/billboards/dragonnogbillboard.nif\r\nmeshes/clutter/billboards/forrentbillboard.nif\r\nmeshes/clutter/billboards/gaybladebillboard.nif\r\nmeshes/clutter/billboards/kneearrowsbillboard.nif\r\nmeshes/clutter/DragonNog/dragonnog.nif\r\nmeshes/weapons/gay/1stpersonsteelgreatswordgay.nif\r\nmeshes/weapons/gay/steelgreatswordgay.nif\r\nmeshes/weapons/knee/kneearrow.nif\r\nmeshes/weapons/knee/kneearrowflight.nif\r\nTextures/clutter/billboards/billboard_n.dds\r\nTextures/clutter/billboards/dragonnogbillboard.dds\r\nTextures/clutter/billboards/forrentbillboard.dds\r\nTextures/clutter/billboards/gaybladebillboard.dds\r\nTextures/clutter/billboards/kneearrowsbillboard.dds\r\nTextures/clutter/DragonNog/dragonnog.dds\r\nTextures/clutter/DragonNog/dragonnog_em.dds\r\nTextures/clutter/DragonNog/dragonnog_n.dds\r\nTextures/weapons/gay/steelclaymoregay.dds\r\nTextures/weapons/knee/steelarrowknee.dds\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nCREDITS and PERMISSIONS\r\n==========================\r\nBrad Meeks...most of the inspiration, artwork.\r\nAndrew Clements...most (maybe all) of the grunt work, some artwork.\r\nBethesda...game, creation kit.\r\n\r\nAnyone is welcome to use any part of this mod however they would like.
