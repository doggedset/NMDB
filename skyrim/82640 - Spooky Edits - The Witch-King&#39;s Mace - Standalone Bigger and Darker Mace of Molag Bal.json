  "descriptionHtml": "[b]THE ONE MACE TO CRUSH THEM ALL&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />First of all, a very big thank you to SpookyMunky for his avaibility, permissions and his awesome textures&#33; I recomand you checking all of his ones&#33;\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1877065/?tb=mods&pUp=1]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1877065/?tb=mods&pUp=1[/url]\r<br />\r<br />The Mace of Molag Bal; probably one of the coolest weapon in the game, whatever character you are playing, with very nice enchantments too.\r<br />I decided to use it as soon as I obtained it, however that enchanment was a bit disappointing, I just wanted it in his raw bloody glory. Moreover that green didn&#39;t fit at all a vampire character.\r<br />This is how the need of a standalone was born.\r<br />I then discovered some LOTR mods here (in particular the Witch-King armor one and the Weapons pack by Isilmeriel, see the section below) and I found how tiny and too light colored was the mace in that contest. Do not get me wrong: the vanilla Mace of Molag bal suits well a daedric warrior, but compared to those huge weapons and dark armors, it definitely needed some working on.\r<br />\r<br />My mods adds a bigger (1.26x from the original) and darker(textures from SpookyMunky) standalone version of the Mace of Molag Bal, only craftable at the Skyforge, upgradable and enchantable. It will be stronger then the best mace in vanilla game, wich is the Dragonbone (18 damage instead of 17) and faster (0.95; let&#39;s face it, vanilla ones are too slow) and an higher radius (1.15).\r<br />Perfect for a Witch-King character (for whose was mainly thought) since in the novel it actually use a mace, not a flial, as in the movie.\r<br />\r<br />[i]...Out of the wreck rose the Black Rider, tall and threatening, towering above her. With a cry of hatred that stung the very ears like venom he let fall his mace. Her (Eowin&#39;s) shield was shivered in many pieces, and her arm was broken; she stumbled to her knees. He bent over her like a cloud, and his eyes glittered; he raised his mace to kill...[/i]   [[i]The Return of the King[/i], Lord of The Rings - Book 5, Ch 6, [i]The Battle of the Pelennor Fields[/i]]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />For who thinks it&#39;s too large, that&#39;s my opinion: [i]&#34;...It is ludicrously large, but it works because It&#39;s ludicrously large. I mean you see that thing, and you see the look on Eowin&#39;s face when she sees it ... she&#39;s terrified&#33;&#33;&#34;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]ZAO4t8672hc[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />...by the way if you want a smaller/normal version just ask and I&#39;ll put it in the optional files. ;)\r<br />\r<br />MODS SEEN IN THE SCREENSHOTS:\r<br />The perfect &#34;Left Hand Rings Modified&#34; mod: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58491/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58491/[/url]?\r<br />\r<br />The wonderful Witch-King helmet and armor ar from &#34;Return of the Witch King&#34; mod...: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24124/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24124/[/url]?\r<br />...but the black linen cloack is from &#34;Cloaks of Skyrim&#34; mod: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12092/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12092/[/url]?\r<br />\r<br />The superb weapons are from &#34;Isilmeriel LOTR Weapon Pack&#34; mod...: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5727/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5727/[/url]?\r<br />...but the 2H non replacer version of the Witch-King sword is an addition to that mod made by me.
