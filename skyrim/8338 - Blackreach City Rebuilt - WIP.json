It\\'s the fruit of Calcemo\\'s fascination of the dwemer culture as the player is landed with the task to research and rebuild the ancient Dwemer capital Blackreach to its\\' former glory and continue the research going on there.\r\n\r\nFor now this is just a placeholder for further updates, since this is a huge story-line related mod that will take me, most likely, ages to finish when paralleled with studies etc.\r\n\r\nThe idea this far is to either reconcile with the Falmer or wipe them out, reason with the holds to all pitch in and help with Blackreach and eventually get started on rebuilding the city with many, many different choices and roads to walk in this, what I hope to be, epic story line about a slightly mad researcher, an expert diplomat, a bloodthirsty warrior and the Dohvakiin to chose whose path is the right one in each situation.",
