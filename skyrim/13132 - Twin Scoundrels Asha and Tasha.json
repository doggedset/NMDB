  "descriptionHtml": ":::Requested Mod:::\r\n\r\nAsha and Tasha are Imperial rogues that are looking for adventure, loot, and the thrill of the hunt. They are both essential, use dual wielding melee (and Tasha is also an accomplished archer), and can heal themselves as well as you...provided you give them what they\\'re looking for. They can be found hanging out inside of Haelga\\'s Bunkhouse in Riften and like all of my other companions they will hang out in the area where you leave them when you dismiss them as followers (so don\\'t forget where you leave them).\r\n\r\nPer request; Asha and Tasha do not use Apachii Sky Hair and should be vanilla compatible. \r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\nPlace the zip file\\'s contents into your Skyrim/data folder to install and be sure to activate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing. Ensure that the Apachii Sky Hair ESP and ESM are ABOVE Summer and Autumn\\'s data files in your load order (I\\'d recommend placing their files dead last in the load order so there are no conflicts).\r\n\r\nRecommended (but not required) mods to get them as they appears in the screen shots:\r\n\r\nCBBE V3 (standard body) and the hip texture compatability pack:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nBella\\'s Better Females version 3:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nCover Eyes (eyes 1 file):\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869\r\n\r\nKiller Keos Skimpy CBBE V2 Armor Set:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3654\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Blackie for his CM New Companions mod that includes a top-notch detailed tutorial on how to create Skyrim companions without the face discoloration bug. Get his mod and tutorial (contained in the mod) here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11669\r\n\r\nThe work around I found for the bug with Bella\\'s face mod (the bug involving women looking like they have faint beard stubble on their jawline and chin) is to use the standard Better Faces Version 3, and then apply the \\\"No Shine\\\" option available on her mod page.\r\n\r\nSpecial note: All of my future companions after Divada, Taja, Viin, and Kyia will be made using the Better Females by Bella mod. I switched to another mod set for faces previously due to a bug I couldn\\'t resolve (the issue with females having faint male beard stubble on their faces while using Bella\\'s). I have resolved that issue, so I\\'ll be going back to Bella\\'s for my projects from now on. You DO NOT have to switch to Bella\\'s if you use Envision faces and RANs Headmesh (what I used previously) OR if you use other face mods. All of my companions should work with other face/body mods and vanilla setups unless specifically mentioned in the description.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking at my work, and I hope you enjoy taking Asha and Tasha with you on your adventures. Feedback is welcomed and remember to endorse it if you like it.\r\n\r\nI recommend a manual install of this mod (read me included in the zip file). Install with Nexus Mod Manager at your own risk.",
