  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small, dangerous dungeon loosely based off of the Lokir&#39;s Tomb tutorial series by Bethesda. These halls are not filled with Draugr however, but are inhabited by a cult of necromancers using ingredients from the dead to create noxious poisons.\r<br />\r<br />You can find it west of Anise&#39;s Cabin near Falkreath (there&#39;s also a location in the screenshots). The recommended player level is 6 and above, but you can definitely finish it at a lower level. While there is no active quest associated with this mod, there is radiant quest support, so you may run into it on your miscellaneous quests.\r<br />\r<br />Let me know if you run into any bugs&#33; I&#39;ve tested it pretty thoroughly, but you never know. Feedback is greatly appreciated&#33;\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE:\r<br />I cleaned up the dirty ITM edits, however the nav mesh changes that you might see in TES5Edit are necessary for companions to enter the dungeon.\r<br />As long as you have the hallsofdeath.esp loaded AFTER the base .esp files and any other unofficial patch files, your game should be just fine.",
