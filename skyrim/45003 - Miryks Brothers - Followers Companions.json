  "descriptionHtml": "2 very strong Companions who can fight in a team (if you use UFO Ultimate Follower Overhaul) you can hire them together as team players. together with you they clean up every thomb, castle, cave, dungeon whatsoever, fast and radically :-) and they are funny.\r\n\r\nLocation pick up / Meeting Point:\r\nYou can find them in Solitude Imperial Fort chapel area waiting for you.\r\n\r\nPreparation:\r\nYou need also better hair for these guys so please preinstall Apachi Hair if you did not already. that^s all you need.... have fun.\r\n\r\nThis wishlist is the Background:\r\n\r\nCODEX for the good Followers\r\n\r\nCompanions how they should behave for not beeing boring and desgusting quickly:\r\n\r\n- The followers should not discuss and talk all the time during the journey but instead act quickly and without hesitating.\r\n\r\n- The followers shall let the the player (main actor => YOU) deside and go ahead. But when you stop in a cave the shall protect you.\r\n\r\n- When you stop a fight they shall also stop. Not to much collateral damage after your stop order (I hope these two guys do obied you)\r\n\r\n- If you have more followers, the two Myriks Brothers should be a role model for all the others (lets test that ).\r\n\r\nYes in the past it was so boring when Artificial Intelligence Followers made your battles running differently as prevented because of their stupidity. In fact this can be only balanced in the game code itself...but they are some good scripts that prove: a good Follower matters. A good follower will not be disbanded after some failed missions...because...he/she does help you to win ....\r\n\r\nso these guys look special...and they are special. :-)\r\nThanks to Myriks Mage Junior and Myriks Bloodhair ...thats the real name they have and normally do not tell :-)\r\n",
