  "descriptionHtml": "Adds Ingredients and Clutter items from the \\\"Fishing In Skyrim\\\" mod to the \\\"Arod\\'s Better Containers\\\" mod.\r\n\r\nArod\\'s Better Containers will forever improve your Skyrim experience. It works on any chest, barrel, pouch, sack or other container, and with any item you can put in your backpack, even if they came from third party mods. Supports Dragonborn, Dawnguard, and Hearthfire DLCs as well.\r\n\r\nInstantly move [i]any[/i] items from your pack into [i]any[/i] container. Easily Move, Rename, or Unlock any container... even from other mods! Stow your gear or open a chest in your home from anywhere else. Craft your own containers to add permanent new storage to any location. \r\n________________________________________________________________\r\nTHIS IS A SUPPORT PATCH ONLY. TWO OTHER MODS ARE REQUIRED:\r\n\r\nREQUIRES \\\"[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16139]FISHING IN SKYRIM[/url]\\\" AND \\\"[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28196]ARODS BETTER  CONTAINERS MOD[/url]\\\". \r\n\r\nThis optional mod will add Ingredients and \\\"Clutter\\\" items (Slimy Tankards, Remains, etc) from my \\\"Fishing In Skyrim\\\" mod into the Container Presets of my \\\"Arods Better Containers\\\" mod. Upon installation, you will have to recast the Presets on any containers that you wish to have learn the new items.\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\nDedicated, as always, to my fiancee Kiersten, who died one year ago this week from a blood clot she got from playing video games for too long in a MW3 competition. The full story is on the Fishing In Skyrim page. Better Containers is a huge timesaver mod: use that time to get up off the couch for a few minutes, move around, and avoid her fate.\r\n",
