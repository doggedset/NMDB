  "descriptionHtml": "There are a lot of very cool and unique items in Skyrim, and a lot of them would make awesome decorations (especially the Thieves Guild larceny targets), but I was always disappointed when I couldn\\'t keep them.  Well, this mod adds non-quest versions of those items to Lucan Valerius\\' shop in Riverwood.  All of the items are categorized as miscellaneous and no longer have any function if they had one before (such as the Skeleton Key lock-pick).\r\n\r\nTo install, just place the .esp in your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\nItems included are:\r\nTrolfdir\\'s Alembic\r\nBerenziah\\'s Crown (this has no Havok, I\\'m not sure why)\r\nStatue of Dibella (both the all gold and the white and gold ones)\r\nDelphine\\'s Dragon Map\r\nDragon Stone\r\nDrinking Horn\r\nJeweled Candlestick\r\nJeweled Flagon\r\nJeweled Goblet\r\nJeweled Urn\r\nJeweled Pitcher\r\nDwemer Lexicon Cube (runes, blank, and corrupt)\r\nDwemer Puzzle Cube\r\nEast Empire Shipping Routes Map\r\nLeft Eye of the Falmer\r\nFocusing Crystal\r\nShip Model (both the larceny target and the jeweled version)\r\nBust of the Gray Fox\r\nHonningbrew Decanter\r\nMercer\\'s Plans\r\nOlava\\'s Token\r\nQueen Bee Statue\r\nCurious Silver Mold\r\nSkeleton Key\r\nTorture Tools\r\nDamaged White Phial\r\nSigil Stone\r\nPotema\\'s Skull",
