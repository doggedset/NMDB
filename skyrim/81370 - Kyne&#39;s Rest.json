  "descriptionHtml": "Kyne&#39;s Rest is a lore friend player home above the Steamscorch Mines in Kynesgrove. And my very first from-scratch mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />Compatible with most mods. It conflicts with mods that change the Steamscorch Mine world space such as other homes featured in that spot. It is compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67181/?]Kynesgrove[/url] town expansion mod. Which I do recommend with this mod to make the space more full.\r<br />\r<br />Known issues: \r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Followers don&#39;t want to climb the steps to go into the house. I don&#39;t know what to do to fix this. If you have a fix, message me on how to do that.\r<br />[*]If you do have Frostfall you can get colder in the house and do not stay warm except by the fire. I also need help on how to fix this.\r<br />[*]Day and night doesn&#39;t show inside. Still trying to figure that out.\r<br />[/list]",
