  "descriptionHtml": "Kyia (pronounced Kee-eye-uh) is a young Redguard adventurer currently visiting the town of Whiterun. You can find her in the dining hall within Dragon\\'s Reach most likely sampling the local wine. \r\n\r\nKyia comes with her casual default clothing (as shown), two scimitars (one for her and one for you), her father\\'s ebony bow, and a small compliment of ebony arrows. Kyia is also a single girl in the wild north and can be married. She is also flagged as essential and was created with low level characters in mind (she should level up as you do). Her functions were tested on my system, and she shouldn\\'t suffer from the head discoloration bug (ESP, ESM, and appearance files are included).\r\n\r\nShe should also work with a vanilla install of Skyrim, but she will not look like she does in the screen shots. To get her appearance as initially created, you will need the following mods:\r\n\r\nCBBE V3 (standard body) and the hip texture compatability pack:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nEnvision Face for CBBE:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7897\r\n\r\nRANs HeadMesh Variants (Type D):\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7127\r\n\r\nCover Eyes (eyes 1 file):\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869\r\n\r\nKiller Keos Skimpy CBBE V2 Armor Set:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3654\r\n\r\nInstallation: Place the contents of the Zip file into your Skyrim/data directory and make sure that Kyia\\'s ESP and ESM files are activated in your Data Files listing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first Skyrim companion (I released several Oblivion companions back in the day under an old account that has been retired). More companions coming soon.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Blackie for his CM New Companions mod that includes a top-notch detailed tutorial on how to create Skyrim companions without the face discoloration bug. Get his mod and tutorial (contained in the mod) here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11669\r\n\r\nSpecial note: All of my future companions after Divada, Taja, Viin, and Kyia will be made using the Better Females by Bella mod. I switched to another mod set for faces (the ones listed here) due to a bug on my end I couldn\\'t resolve (the issue with females having faint male beard stubble on their faces while using Bella\\'s). I have resolved that issue, so I\\'ll be going back to Bella\\'s for my future projects. You DO NOT have to switch to Bella\\'s if you use the face mods listed above OR if you use other face mods. All of my companions should work with other face/body mods and vanilla setups unless specifically mentioned in the description. \r\n\r\nThe work around I found for the bug with Bella\\'s face mod is to use the standard Better Faces Version 3, and then apply the \\\"No Shine\\\" option available on her mod page.\r\n\r\nThe link to Bella\\'s Better Females is below.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nNote: I have added two screen shots with Bella\\'s Better Females installed so you can see the difference. If you\\'re still using vanilla; you might find either Envision or Bella\\'s to your liking. If you already have Envision installed, future companions will still work or if you currently use Bella\\'s you\\'ll now have an idea as to what my first four companions (Kyia, Viin, Taja, and Divada) will look like on your system.",
