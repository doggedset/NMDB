You must first download Zero frost&#39;s great mod here for this to work. Enjoy&#33;\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25476/?\r<br />\r<br />Installation is easy just drop this folder into your Skyrim folder and let it overwrite zero frosts files.\r<br />\r<br />Do note that this will change the original masked hood from his mod to just a mask i do not know how to add a standalone version without overwriting his hooded version.\r<br />\r<br />All meshes and textures are originally made by Zero Frost all credit goes to him.",
