  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a race that can turn invisible, this race also has a special spell. This is my first mod.\r\nso feel free to point out some errors, the invisibility power is now toggle. Credit to allzero for teaching me how to make a toggle spell, I would love it if someone could make a little video on my mod.\r\n\r\nI may also need some help with invisibility, it works like normal invisibility, only it makes you look like your invisible. So I\\'d be glad if i could have some help on that. I\\'m also thinking of adding more races in the future so be prepared.",
