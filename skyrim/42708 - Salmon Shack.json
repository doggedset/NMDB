It&#39;s near the cart of Solitude,\r<br />so no matter for who don&#39;t use fast travel, and of course is near Solitude to buy foods and other things.\r<br />Since there are some NPCs near the shack, the foods inside it will respawns as usual in exterior places (call this as &#34;lore&#34;).\r<br />However there is a safe chest (the only one&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />* INSTALLATION *\r<br />Just unpack the rar and put the ESP into data folder. Enable in your Skyrim launcher and enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />* UNINSTALLATION *\r<br />First off, take back all your things from the safe chest (if you did it).\r<br />Then simply remove the ESP file.\r<br />\r<br />* COMPATIBILITY *\r<br />This mod is your friend, free from scripts and there are no mods conflicts. Works fine together my Lanterns of Skyrim mod.\r<br />\r<br />* FACEBOOK *\r<br />I&#39;m on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MannyGTSkyrimMods",
