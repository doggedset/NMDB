The original version was good, however the castle exterior still needed much work, and had no interior. When I saw the potential of the mod, I decided to carry on this undertaking alone; since then, I have put in around 500 work hours and over 40 all-nighters. You do not accomplish something great without an equal amount of effort, determination, and sacrifice; I believe I have done it, and I will continue to do so. I am ambitious; small deeds do not satisfy me, and I believe that, for many, Riverhelm is that one dream mod, and I wish for you all to have a good game.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]What's in this mod ?[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Have you ever felt that the rewards in the game pale in comparison to the deeds and quests that are asked of you? \n<br />If so, this mod is for you. You can now own your very own fortress and rule it as its King. Collect taxes, salaries, and feel like a true noble! If that gets boring, go on up to the arena to watch or participate in a battle. Want more action? Go down to the sewers and fight the Crokers, a tribe of great lizardmen. Still not satisfied? Ever want to defend your castle from an invasion? Well now you can, just by talking to the guards at the gate! Want a place to store all your trophies and other accolades? Well there's a secret temple within the castle with massive storage space just for you! Are the guards' armors not up to your standards? No problem, become the King of Riverhelm and talk to the General in the castle hall and replace it with another type of armor!\n<br />\n<br />You can do all that and much, much more with this mod.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />                 [youtube]EdNyII8OHqY[/youtube]  [youtube]AFxUI4548BY[/youtube] \n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]\n<br />[/size][/b][b][size=4]If you want to like my page in facebook and join me :)\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.facebook.com/Become-King-of-Riverhelm-and-Locaster-mods-123193281131815/][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/20614-0-1509676613.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]\n<br />Start new Patreon![/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.patreon.com/locaster][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/20614-1-1509676613.jpg[/img]\n<br />[/url][size=3]\n<br />[b][color=#efefef]If you would like to thank me for this mod, please read below.

(See spoiler)[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#efefef][spoiler] [/color][/b]Greetings to all my dear friends and followers! Thank you for reading this text.\n<br />If at least one of you get what I’ll be saying here and put in practice what I’m writing\n<br />about, or, if my words help you somehow, all the effort I dedicated to the creation and\n<br />development of this mod, as well as so many others, will be made worth it.\n<br />\n<br />Have you ever thought about what you have been doing to make the world a better\n<br />place? It is a hard task, isn’t it? Specially when we find ourselves immersed in personal\n<br />issues, essential/existential problems, heavy work routines, and the list goes on... I\n<br />understand it–better than you can imagine.\n<br />\n<br />Yet, one day I decided to suspend the exterior queries and get some time to look inside\n<br />myself. “To look inside oneself?”, you might ask. It can sound weird at a first, as it was\n<br />for me in the beginning of this intimate and profound journey—a search for something\n<br />superior. I started reconsidering my behavior, analyzing my right attitudes and mistakes\n<br />from the past. From then on, I began working on each one of my faults and weaknesses\n<br />by looking at myself as if I were an spectator, observing me in the third person. With\n<br />each of my faults mapped, I started observing what was leading me to commit each\n<br />error. This task takes time, the results don’t come overnight, but it will transform you\n<br />substantially, if you allow it to happen.\n<br />\n<br />I eliminated most of my anger, hate, greed, envy, and vanity, among other\n<br />imperfections. I still have a lot to learn and I hope to die learning. Hence, I try to be a\n<br />little better every single day. Scientific studies have shown that negative emotions cause\n<br />diseases such as cancer, and they have a huge negative social impact. I’m not better nor\n<br />worse than anybody else; all of us have these and other imperfections to smaller or\n<br />greater degree.\n<br />\n<br />These negative emotions are the reason why so many people are starving in the world,\n<br />or pay huge amounts of money for medicine that are in fact, cheap to produce—in such\n<br />a way that few can make fortunes. And those who need it most don’t have access to\n<br />basic necessities—while corrupt politicians steal taxpayer's money with their insatiable\n<br />and deranged greed.\n<br />\n<br />This is only a small part of the troubles caused by these character flaws, which are truly\n<br />a worldwide disease. Yet, you all know about the problems of the world. What many\n<br />people don’t know it is how to start solving these problems, how to improve the quality\n<br />of life in the world. Along the years, I listed some of my conclusions and inspirations. A\n<br />good point of departure is to start following these steps:\n<br />\n<br />1– What you do not want done to yourself, do not do onto others.\n<br />\n<br />2– At a certain point in your life you will harvest the seeds of the good and the bad you\n<br />have done. It can take many years, but one day what you have done will get back to you\n<br />(so, do good deeds, “greasy soul”! lol)\n<br />\n<br />3– Try to take something good out of the bad things that happen to you. There are\n<br />lessons to be learned.\n<br />\n<br />4– Before criticizing others, try to put yourself on their shoes and ask yourself if you\n<br />wouldn't do the same, or how would you act better under the same circumstances. Know\n<br />yourself very well before judging the others.\n<br />\n<br />5– Try to always show a positive attitude. This attracts good things (yeah, it is hard, I\n<br />get it—specially with a half dozen trolls salivating on your neck, but be faithful and you\n<br />will succeed).\n<br />\n<br />6– Don’t take things for granted. Be grateful for the good things you receive, and for the\n<br />ones you already have, by forgetting for a moment what you don’t have.\n<br />Very well then. Look at the #1: “What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to\n<br />others”– How much better the world would be if everybody followed only this thought?\n<br />Much, much better... wouldn’t it?\n<br />Folks, think about it. How can we make the world a better place if, so often, we\n<br />ourselves are sick?\n<br />\n<br />It is simple: start by improving yourself. Practice the list above. I put it in practice and I\n<br />improved a lot—personally and toward the ones around me. That is the reason why I’m\n<br />sharing it with you. Acquire knowledge by studying many books, religions, and\n<br />philosophies. Have an open mind, absorb the best of each lesson, and build your own\n<br />truth. Eventually, you will see the world and the circumstances more clearly.\n<br />Look inside yourself. It all starts with this. Question yourself, and, if feasible, follow the\n<br />six steps above. I can assure you the world would be a much better place if people\n<br />followed it. You might not be perfect, but you can be a little better at each day. It is up\n<br />to you.\n<br />\n<br />Well, that’s it. I may not be the Lord of Universal Truth, but I’m talking to you with an\n<br />open heart, sharing my two cents. I hope no one will take a wooden baton and beat my\n<br />head with it thinking I’m crazy... Or, perhaps it is the world that is?\n<br />Open your eyes and your consciousness. Thank you for reading this far. I wish the best\n<br />for each of you. The power of change is in the hands of each one of us. Don’t wait for\n<br />the change to happen—be the change!\n<br />Peace and light to everyone.\n<br />\n<br />Sincerely,\n<br />Locaster[b][color=#efefef] \n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler][/color][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Features[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Location between riverwood and whiterun\n<br />\n<br />To buy titles, go talk to the Baron in the castle hall.\n<br />\n<br />1 - Buy a mine inside the castle.
