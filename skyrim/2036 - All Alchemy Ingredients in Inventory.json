  "descriptionHtml": "Adds 100 of each ingredient to your inventory. Make sure you are by a container when you use this, as you WILL be overweight.\r\n\r\nThere are two versions. 1 includes Crimson Ninroot (add-reagents) that automatically starts a quest pertaining to collecting them, so use this one at your own discretion. The other (add-reagentsnocrimson) doesn\\'t include Crimson Ninroot, and the quest will not automatically be started, and you\\'ll have to find it yourself. =P\r\n\r\nI, for one, love alchemy, but I can\\'t seem to find enough ingredients, and find the hunting tedious and not at all game-enhancing. I looked around the Skyrim Nexus,  but was unable to find anything, so I decided to make my own! Hope this helps all of you aspiring alchemists reach your goals. =]\r\n\r\nTO INSTALL:\r\nSimply extract to your Skyrim folder. (C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim) \r\n\r\nTO USE:\r\nIn game, press ` to open the console, and type \\\"bat add-reagents\\\" or \\\"bat add-reagentsnocrimson\\\" depending on which you decide to use, without the quotes. That\\'s it! =]\r\n\r\nI\\'m horrible at modding, so these console command files are the only way I have to contribute to the Skyrim Nexus community. Thank you all who make mods for us! I wish I had better ways to repay you, but for now, this is what I have to offer. <3",
