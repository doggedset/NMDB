  "summary": "Makes executioner clothing lootable, the gloves and boots, gives the Solitude executioner Ahtar an Executioner\\'s hood.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I have only been modding for less than a month now and so I know almost nothing but I am learning fast. This mod is the first in a series that will make specific armor and clothing lootable because I think they should be even if they each have their own small bugs. This mod renames the executioner gloves and boots so instead of saying \\\"Gloves\\\" and \\\"Boots\\\" they will read \\\"Executioner\\'s Gloves\\\" and \\\"Executioner\\'s Boots\\\" just like the hood and clothes. Ahtar\\'s outfit was changed to a new outfit I made that includes the hood so I think he is the only executioner in the game with full executioner outfit. I also modified his sleeping outfit so he would not put on those rediculous clothes while still leaving his boots and gloves on, now he has no sleeping outfit so he should stay in his executioner outfit.\r\n\r\nSimply load it into your skyrim data folder in order for it to work.",
