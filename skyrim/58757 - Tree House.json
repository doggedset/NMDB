  "descriptionHtml": "A year (or two) ago I did a house for my game. After I deleted the game with this mod. But as I see I have other version, which was lost in my files^^\r<br />House have a small library corner, kitchen, bedroom and etc.\r<br />Location it&#39;s north-west from Helgen near waterwall (should be an icon of a town), I don&#39;t think you can miss it.Â \r<br />\r<br />This mod is replacer for other location where was burned people near small house, but all their items should be on the table near house (as I remember).\r<br />\r<br />House placed on the border between two cells, so followers can do weird things like walking far distance, except do 5 steps to you. I don&#39;t know how to fix it, but in CK works all perfect. I think it&#39;s just a game bug. Thanks to Satan what it&#39;s happen not often.",
