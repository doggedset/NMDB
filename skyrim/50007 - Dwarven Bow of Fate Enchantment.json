  "descriptionHtml": "In the un-altered Dragonborn DLC, the Dwarven Black Bow of Fate&#39;s enchantment was not obtainable via dis-enchant (as opposed to the Champion&#39;s Cudgel and its enchantment of &#34;Chaos Damage&#34;). This mod allows players to obtain this enchantment as you would any other type of enchantment. The enchantment is titled &#34;Chaos Absorb&#34;, to fit with the theme of the two enchantments.\r<br />\r<br />Note: This mod requires the Dragonborn DLC, as well as the update needed to play it. As obvious as this might seem, I felt it needed to be stated in the description.",
