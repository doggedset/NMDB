  "descriptionHtml": "Simple white orc race for a mod I am developing, Should be compatible with nearly everything, adds White orcs as a player race.\r<br />\r<br />For the screenshots results will be dependant on your body and character edit mods, I am using WSCO and that is what is shown in the images for my mod. WSCO is not required, enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />If anyone has any other custom race mods that are not much more than skin and stat edits let me know and I&#39;ll work into it.\r<br />I am not a modeler, my mods will mostly be re-works, and re-used content from the game itself or using files I have gained permission of use from other modders.\r<br />\r<br />Also keep an eye out for my next upcoming mods, a custom pre-furnished player home, and likely more races to play skyrim with.\r<br />",
