  "descriptionHtml": "A player home for my friend Sean. The hideout is tucked away up on the cliff above Old Hroldan and overlooks the valley beneath it. If you like a great view of untamed mountainsides and a tankard of mead, then this might be the mod for you.\r\n\r\nOwnership of the house can be secured by using the key located atop the table in front of the hideaway to unlock the door to the home. Some of the entrances to the rooms in the hideaway are disguised by either false bookshelves or wardrobes, so it may take a bit of poking around to find the entrances to all of the rooms. Hopefully they are not too difficult for a dragonborn to find.\r\n\r\nRequirements: Skyrim + the latest Skyrim Update (because I did not use any features from the DLCs to create this mod, it should work fine without them as well)\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n-Alchemy Table\r\n-Anvil\r\n-Tanning Rack\r\n-8 safe storage chests\r\n     PLEASE NOTE: The mead barrels in the dinning area of the hideaway are respawning and\r\n     consequently, unsafe to store things in. All respawning chests, primarily those respawning\r\n     cheese and mead, are marked as \\\"respawning\\\" and thus, also unsafe to store things in.\r\n     All other containers, such as satchels and sacks, are non-respawning and merely contain a few\r\n     vegetables, making them safe for a little extra storage if need be.\r\n-2 mannequins\r\n-13 weapon plaques\r\n-2 weapon racks\r\n\r\nWarning:\r\nAs this is the first version of this mod, please inform me of any major concerns or difficulties encountered with the mod, such as missing walls or things of that matter, so I can fix them as soon as possible.",
