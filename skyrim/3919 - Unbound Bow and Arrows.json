  "summary": "(Un)Bound Bow and Arrows, fully upgradeable/enchantable (replaces Daedric Bow)\r\n[Obsolete]",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]NOTE:[/b] This mod should be considered obsolete. It has been superceeded by my new version [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14687]found here[/url]. The new mod no longer replaces the Daedric Bow, remains upgradeable, enchantable and fires unlimited Unbound Arrows.\r\n\r\nThis mod replaces the Daedric Bow with the other-worldly model of the Bound Bow, renamed Unbound. It is craftable, upgradeable and enchantable in precisely the same way as the normal Daedric Bow and also shares the same damage/weight stats. It also adds Unbound Arrows to the game, which do the same damage as Daedric Arrows (24).\r\n\r\nThe arrows need to be added via the console, with the following command:\r\nplayer.additem 139C1 X (where X is the number you wish added)\r\nIf the above item code doesn\\'t work, please try the following console command instead:\r\nhelp \\\"unbound arrow\\\" 4\r\nThis will give the correct item code.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use the included script to add the bow and some arrows to your inventory, by typing at the console: bat unbound. I would suggest not using this on a low level character. Please let me know if there are any issues.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n- The (Un)Bound Bow doesn\\'t have a model when examined in the inventory/workbench/enchanting table. I don\\'t believe one is available.\r\n- The Unbound Arrows are labelled as Daedric Arrows when retreived from the environment. They will however stack correctly in inventory and are otherwise unaffected.\r\n\r\nOnce the toolset is released, I intend to re-create all the bound weapons as seperate, fully upgradeable and enchantable \\\"Unbound\\\" versions.",
