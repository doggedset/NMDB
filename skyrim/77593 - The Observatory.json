  "summary": "The Observatory was once an abandoned tower that has been taken over by an enigmatic mage. With a bit of telvanni magic and some forbidden secrets it&#39;s become a unique abode that explains a bit of the owner&#39;s story.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Mod and art created by Serpentwined, for more stories and art related to characters involved with this mod you can [url=http://adelein-gardinier.tumblr.com/]visit this blog\r<br />[b]\r<br />[/b][/url][b]This does require Dragonborn&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br /> There isn&#39;t a lot of intractable content here for dragonborn collectors to display their items, this mod focuses more on the story of my own personal characters with a lot of new lore ideas and stories to read. It&#39;s catered to the owner&#39;s tastes and not the dragonborn&#39;s, making it more of a point of interest mod rather than a house mod (You CAN use it as a house if you want, however). I&#39;ve been using this to make screenshots for my own personal stories based on Elder Scrolls characters and decided to make this public for other&#39;s to explore. \r<br />\r<br />The tower is in Falkreath just north of Knifepoint Ridge.\r<br />\r<br />I lost the sheet that has all the credit to custom content and currently rebuilding it to post it here soon, if you are a creator of any tools and assets used in this mod let me know so I can properly accredit you. I posted it here first just in case anyone is quicker to find the information then I am.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Modders resources used: \r<br />Caliente \r<br />stroti \r<br />Blary \r<br />Elianora \r<br />Lolicept \r<br />Tamira \r<br />\r<br />If I missed any let me know&#33;",
