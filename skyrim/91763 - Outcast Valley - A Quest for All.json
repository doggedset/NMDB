  "summary": "This mod provides an experience to the player that changes depending on their actions throughout the level. It does so by taking the player’s actions and changes the outcome of the level based on those actions. Through these changes, it makes the player feel like they have made an impact on the world – good, or bad. Play it your way and enjoy!",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a seemingly small quest, but has many different outcomes and experiences along the way. This was originally designed for my Master's Thesis focusing on Using Gamer Playstyle to Create A Dynamic Level. So play it how you like to generally play and see what kind of experience you have and how that differs from others who have played! \n<br />\n<br />This was a fun experiment for me, and I had a blast creating branching dialogue paths, and no matter how you choose to play, you will nearly always have a different experience, or find out more/less about the area than others. So enjoy and share your experiences with your friends to see how they played it and what you missed!",
