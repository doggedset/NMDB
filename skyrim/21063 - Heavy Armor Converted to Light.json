  "descriptionHtml": "I duplicated all standard types of heavy armor (orcish, steel) and made a light armor version. They are all craftable, and upgradeable. Should you find anything wrong with it, an armor labeled as \\\"light\\\" is still heavy, or something like that, don\\'t hesitate to leave a comment. This is an all armor pack, so you can\\'t get them individually. At least not yet.
