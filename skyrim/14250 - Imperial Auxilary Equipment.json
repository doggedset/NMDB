  "descriptionHtml": "Adds new lore friendly equipment and armour that better befits an Imperial auxilary legionnaire.  I will be updating this file with new stuff as I finish them, currently as of version 1.0 there are two pieces, a plumed imperial helmet, and a scutum style shield.\r\n\r\nTo get them ingame open the console and type \\'help auxilary 4\\'\r\nComes in light and heavy versions for both shield and helm\r\n\r\nKnown issues: Some style of hair clip through the helmet, I don\\'t know how to fix this so if you do let me know and I\\'ll get right on it.\r\n\r\n***For those who do not want the mask part: Simply open up the CrestedHelmF or CrestedHelmM with NifSkope (whichever sex your character is), right click on the NiTriShape named \\'Mask\\' and select Block->Remove Branch.  Save the file using the same name and play on with your glorious mug showing :P",
