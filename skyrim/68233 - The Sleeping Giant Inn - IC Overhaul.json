I&#39;ve added things like a new wooden plank floor so no more stone floor, many plants and ivy around the place for a bit of colour, lots of clutter items to fill the place and make it look more &#34;full&#34;, added bar stools to the bar so you can sit and drink at the bar, more sun beams coming in from the windows during the day and a few things have been moved around, changed and added. It is fully navmeshed so followers can still move around smoothly inside.\r<br />\r<br />Only requires the latest Skyrim update.\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to upload your pictures of it because I&#39;m not using an ENB so there is probably many people out there who could give it more justice than my pictures.\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]Slideshow[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]jqhPpZ5i-vI[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]Installation[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />Use NMM for easy install or just put the meshes folder and the esp into your skyrim data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Remember to activate the esp in your launcher or mod manager of choice.\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]Uninstallation[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />If you have installed using NMM then simply deactivate the mod or if you installed manually then delete the esp.\r<br />\r<br />[line][/center]",
