  "descriptionHtml": "Feel let down by this armour set, as the Nord Hero weapons are pretty decent? Want more than a re-skin of Iron armour? Want to look old-school Nordic and yet have a decent armour rating? \r<br />\r<br />This mod replaces the base armour values of the set (including the Ancient Helmet of the Unburned) with those of Daedric. \r<br />\r<br />Ysgramor and The Five Hundred could have actually conquered Skyrim wearing this armour now. \r<br />\r<br />Now the strongest armour for women is....backless and mainly leather?\r<br />\r<br />Also on the steam workshop.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility issues:\r<br />Anything else that modifies these items, otherwise it should be fine. It&#39;s just a number change in the creation kit, after all.",
