I found the funnest quests in this game to be the Journal quests that you would randomly find, you know the ones.. You will find your first note in front of Breezehome and go from there.\r\n\r\nThis is a Beta stage, I ain\\'t proud of it so far, editing like this is just getting frustrating.. It is not entirely completed, I need your feedback because with the nature of this type of quest, I have no idea how hard it is.. Like I said this isn\\'t complete, but the end of this stage is Note #6, but I would be very surprised if anyone can reach that point with the difficulty of the last note.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, take this as a challenge.. Have fun. Don\\'t cheat on the riddles!\r\n\r\nCheck out my other mods, \r\n",
