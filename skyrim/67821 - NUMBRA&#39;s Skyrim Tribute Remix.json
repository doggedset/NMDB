  "descriptionHtml": "Oh wow look it&#39;s another music producer shamelessly plugging his shitty music. O_O\r<br />Usually I&#39;m making music to appease to rave culture and festivals I play but since I&#39;m such a big fan of this franchise I thought it&#39;d be fun to remix it for myself. Wasn&#39;t going to post it here but I had a few friends suggest otherwise, I hope you guys smell what I&#39;m stepping in&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I, as well as a few of my friends use this as a replacer for the main menu music, who knows- might tickle your fancy dangle.\r<br />\r<br />If you do dig it, you can find more of my weird shit here:\r<br />https://soundcloud.com/numbraoffical/\r<br />\r<br />And alternatively if you don&#39;t want to download it you can just go preview it using this link here:\r<br />https://soundcloud.com/numbraoffical/dragonburn-curmz",
