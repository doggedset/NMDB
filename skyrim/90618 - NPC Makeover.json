  "descriptionHtml": "This mod removes all scars, wrinkles, dirt, and makeup from all unique named female NPCs for the Skyrim LE.\n<br />Elder race, child races, argonians, and khajits are left untouched.\n<br />\n<br />Only vanilla assets were touched by changing tint maskÂ  interpolation values, removing scar headparts, or swapping complexion.\n<br />Facegen was reexported for all characters. ESP should only be necessary to make scars disappear.\n<br />\n<br />To install, select the BSA version or the loose version. To install the loose version, just drop the contents of the makeover folder in the 7z you picked into your Skyrim data folder, start the game, tick the esp (or not) and enjoy.\n<br />\n<br />To install the BSA version, just drop the bsa and the esp in your skyrim data folder, start the game, tick the esp, and enjoy. No top level folder in that 7z.\n<br />\n<br />Since it makes older women appear 30 years younger, I have assigned the not-lore-friendly tag.\n<br />If this mod is not your cup of tea, just move on politely. \n<br />\n<br />I did not include images due to the number of NPCs touched (about 280). Conflicts with other beautifiers are likely, and are left to the downloader to solve.\n<br />I would recommend putting this above any mod which touches the same NPCs, especially followers, in your load order. This includes Serana/Valerica as well as the usual vanilla followers (Lydia and the other housecarls for example).\n<br />\n<br />Recommended that this be used with Fair Skin textures by HHaley. I personally use RaceMenu and UUNP as well.\n<br />\n<br />To uninstall the loose version of the mod manually, delete the following files and folders from your Skyrim Data folder:\n<br />makeover.esp\n<br />meshes/actors/character/FaceGenData/FaceGeom/Skyrim.esm\n<br />meshes/actors/character/FaceGenData/FaceGeom/Dawnguard.esm\n<br />meshes/actors/character/FaceGenData/FaceGeom/Dragonborn.esm\n<br />meshes/actors/character/FaceGenData/FaceGeom/Hearthfires.esm\n<br />textures/actors/character/FaceGenData/FaceTint/Skyrim.esm\n<br />textures/actors/character/FaceGenData/FaceTint/Dawnguard.esm\n<br />textures/actors/character/FaceGenData/FaceTint/Dragonborn.esm\n<br />textures/actors/character/FaceGenData/FaceTint/Hearthfires.esm\n<br />\n<br />To uninstall the bsa version just delete the bsa and the esp from your skyrim data folder.\n<br />There are no scripts in either case so while a save cleaner can't hurt it probably isn't required.",
