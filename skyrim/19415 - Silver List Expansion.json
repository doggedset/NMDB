  "summary": "Expands silver weapons to work on more things.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Inspired by The Witcher, I like to carry around a (skyforged) steel sword and a silver sword, but the silver only sees use against undead. I wanted to increase the usefulness.\r\n\r\nNormally, silver weapons gain damage against werewolves, undead, and ghosts. I\\'ve expanded the list to also include:\r\n[list][*]Daedra\r\n[*]Dwarven Automatons\r\n[*]Hagravens\r\n[*]Ice Wraiths\r\n[*]Magic Anomalies\r\n[*]Spriggans\r\n[*]The White Stag\r\n[*]Wisps\r\n[*]Wolf Spirits[/list]\r\n\r\nNow silver weapons are useful against all manners of magical creatures (just like in The Witcher). I\\'ve also changed the bonus. Weapons almost universally have critical hit damage values equal to half their base damage, rounded down. The normal bonus for silver is +20 base damage, so I\\'ve also thrown on a +10 critical hit damage. Critical hits still won\\'t really matter, but at least they can pretend now.\r\n\r\nYes, this is sort of cheating. No, I do not care. I have plenty of other mods to make the game harder. I made this for myself to simply expand the usefulness of silver weapons so I have more reason to keep carrying one around. I\\'ve uploaded this because I\\'m sure at least four other people might want it.\r\n\r\nI assume you\\'re using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1020]Lost Art of the Blacksmith[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1690]Legendary Smithing Upgrades[/url] so that your silver weapons are actually useful in the first place. You might as well also grab [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3301]WE HR Silver Swords[/url] so they look pretty too.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis changes only three files, making it compatible with nearly anything. Files changed were:\r\nSilverPerk [size=1]- to modify the effect and expand the list[/size]\r\nSilverSword [size=1]- to update the description[/size]\r\nSilverGreatsword [size=1]- same[/size]\r\n\r\nThis will work on any new silver weapons other mods add. It won\\'t change the descriptions on those weapons obviously, but the new effect will work.",
