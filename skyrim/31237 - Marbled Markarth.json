  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://img577.imageshack.us/img577/9227/whitemarbletexture01byg.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=7][b]Marbled Markarth[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a complete texture overhaul that I made just to suit my own tastes in Skyrim.  I had always pictured such a grand city like Markarth to look like just that....grand!  And what better way to accomplish this?  Add marble...lots and lots of solid white, pure marble.  And that makes an instant Heaven.  :D\r\n\r\nNow, before you ask any questions, let me answer a few:\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]This isn\\'t lore friendly.  Everything looks shiny and new.  Where did all the marble come from?[/size][/b]\r\nI did not intend to make this lore friendly, nor do I care where the white rocks came from.  Perhaps it was imported from Cyrodil?  Either way, this is made for aesthetic reasons only.  No lore was considered, nor shall be considered.\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]Does this affect all Dwemer ruins?[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nYes, this does have an affect on most Dwemer ruins...not much, but certainly noticeable.  Even still, I didn\\'t much care much for the looks of those ruins to begin with. If anything, it is actually a unique improvement on them.  xD\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]Will this affect my performance?[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nI have tried to make this as performance friendly as possible, by making the textures a generic, standard size.  However, it is possible that you will have slightly lower FPS.  Depends on your machine, and what colors it can process well.  \r\n\r\n[b][size=5]Why is this so sloppy??[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nBecause it started out as an experiment, and ended the same way...as an experiment.  Sure, it\\'s not the fanciest texture mod out there, but it accomplishes a basic task, and I personally like it.\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]My ENB makes this too bright!![/size][/b]\r\nLike many of my texture overhauls, I try to make it look good for vanilla Skyrim.  If you are using a bright ENB, it\\'s just not going to look right.  Also, there are some ENBs that make it look purple.  \r\n\r\n[b][size=5]What are the rock textures used behind the buildings?[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nYou can find them in my other mod, [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29745]Natural Fantasy Textures\\\"[/url]  ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have anymore questions, feel free to ask.  Just bear in mind that I made these for my own personal tastes, and I don\\'t plan on changing them.  You are free to modify them or make them darker, if you so choose.  Just make sure to credit me for the original.  :)\r\n\r\nAlso, feel free to try out my other texture mods.  I really appreciate it!!!",
