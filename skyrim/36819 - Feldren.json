  "summary": "Adds a new race with necromantic abilities",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds the Feldren as a playable race.\r\n\r\nIn the future, it\\'ll be three or four different races, all with Necrotic Pulse, and all with a different form type, but for now, it\\'s just the one. \r\nThis is my first mod, and I have some more ideas for it, but I don\\'t know how to make them. Also I want to add the master spell animation to Necrotic Pulse. If anyone can spare some help, it would be very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nVampire compatible, NON-Vampire Lord compatible (If you try going into Vampire Lord form, t freezes), I don\\'t know about werewolf.\r\nI could use some help trying to get VL to work. \r\n\r\n\r\nRacials:\r\nNecrotic Pulse (It\\'s up, it works, it just has no animation except the basic one)\r\n-This acts like a mini version of the Ritual Stone, it has a smaller range (40 instead of 75) and a shorter duration (1 minute instead of 3). The advantages? It\\'s a lesser power, so you can use it was often as you wish, and it frees up your stone for something else. This will be for all Feldren once I implement the multiple options\r\n\r\n-Lich Form (Not yet implemented. I don\\'t know how to do this actually)\r\n-What I want this to do is:\r\n--It\\'ll be a greater power lasting for 1 minute\r\n--When it\\'s active, all your spells are stronger, but you can\\'t be healed, not even by potions.\r\n---If it\\'s possible, I would LIKE drain spells to still heal the caster, but only drains. This isn\\'t that big a deal though.\r\nThis will be the for Feldren Arcana, the Mage version.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to help me-\r\nSend me a message. I would like it if you told me how to do what I want instead of doing it for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nPermission-\r\nYou can use this in any of your mods, but don\\'t -complete- it for me. I have my own vision for this, but if you want to add to it, go ahead. Just don\\'t publish it.\r\n\r\n\r\nthis mod doesn\\'t require anything else, and maybe the only reason it isn\\'t VL compatible is because I didn\\'t build it with Dawnguard checked in the CK. HOWEVER< I highly recommend this mod-\r\nBetter Vampires by Brehanin 6.2 (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9717//?)",
