  "descriptionHtml": "Introduction :\r\n\r\nThis is  my first mod so please be gentle.\r\n\r\nSo i was looking for a simple player home with lots of mannequins / display cases and nothing to busy but couldn\\'t find anything to my liking.\r\n\r\nThere\\'s many player homes that have a armory as part of it but it\\'s usually a giant beautiful home that will take up more performance that it should.\r\nSo i made my own.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription :\r\n\r\nIt\\'s basically a stripped version of the interior cell from dragon\\'s reach with just the main room and all the other rooms removed.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s well lit and the interior has been changed a bit.\r\n\r\nIt has :\r\n14 mannequins\r\n15 display cases\r\n8 weapon rack\\'s\r\n3 large chests\r\n1x enchanting table\r\n1x alchemy table\r\n1x forge\r\n1x smelter\r\n1x tanning rack\r\n1x armor workbench\r\n1x sharpening wheel\r\n\r\nIt\\'s also follower friendly.\r\n\r\nIt should show up on your map as soon as the mod is activated and u can fast travel from within the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation :\r\n\r\nSimply extract the archive and put the esp file in your data folder, then activate it through the Skyrim Launcher / Nexus Mod Manager / Mod Organizer / etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issue\\'s :\r\n\r\n1. Sometimes when u look up it seems like the roof pieces aren\\'t properly aligned and there\\'s a tiny space in between them.\r\n\r\nIn the creation kit these are perfectly aligned so i have no idea how to fix this.\r\n\r\n2. The weapon racks.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve spent roughly 2 hours fiddling with the weapon racks, at first they didn\\'t work at all so i took them from a existing player home... those didn\\'t work as well so i scrapped them and tried them again and now they seem to work though big axes will still bug now and then.\r\n\r\nNo idea how to fix this.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal words :\r\n\r\nIt\\'s my first mod, it\\'s not much but it\\'s functional.\r\n\r\nIf anybody installs this and run\\'s in to an issue let me know and i will see if i can fix it, suggestions are of course welcome.\r\n\r\n-Anubis",
