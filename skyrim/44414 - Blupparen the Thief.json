Uploaded to share it with friends and others.\r\n\r\nHe is a Khajiit currently staying in Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. He has thievesguild armor, two ebony daggers, ebony bow and arrows and a few skooma bottles. It\\'s a companion version of my main skyrim character so he looks a bit weird. :) Anyway I hope you like it!",
