  "descriptionHtml": "A very simple mod that does two things:\r<br />\r<br />1.\r<br />Adds clothing that, while worn, temporarily increase certain skills such as blacksmithing, speech and alchemy in order\r<br />to make regular clothes a bit more useful and more immersive.\r<br />Now you can switch to blacksmithing clothes when smithing or dress in fine clothes to increase your overall charisma.\r<br />The clothes can be found on several merchants around skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />2.\r<br />Adds a unique clothing set that increases speech. The set constist of a hat, a robe and a pair of boots along with matching jewelry.\r<br />\r<br />Lore:\r<br />The Fashionable Attire; once created by a famous court tailor from Solitude was so desirable that it became a target for power hungry politicians, wizards, \r<br />thieves and greedy merchants.\r<br />Over time each piece of the set was lost and scattered across Skyrim along with the knowledge of it&#39;s true potencial and influencial powers.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Just put &#34;The Fashionable Attire.esp&#34; in your skyrim/data directory.\r<br />Or..\r<br />Download with manager should you use nexus mod manager.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall:\r<br />Just delete &#34;The Fashionable Attire.esp&#34; from your skyrim/data directory.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />This mod should be compatible with anything.\r<br />The mod simply adds new clothing with skill bonuses rather than editing all existing clothes in order to reduce\r<br />potential conflicts to a minimum.\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to use/change or get inspired by this mod in any way possible.\r<br />You do not have to ask for our &#34;permission&#34; or something (ridicilous) to use this.\r<br />\r<br />(Please pardon the terrible picture. Our skills in paint increased by 1. It is now 1... Yes... Really...)",
