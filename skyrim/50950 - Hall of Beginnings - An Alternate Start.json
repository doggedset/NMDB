Souls of the dead are sent to places\r<br />called &#34;Halls of Beginnings&#34; all over Tamriel. When you start a new game, you will\r<br />be among these souls waiting to start your life anew in Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r781/MimiTheAlchemist/Skyrim%20Mods/hobquote2_zpsc94ad9e4.gif[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />Once your are teleported to the hall, talk to the old sage at the desk.\r<br />He will tell you about your death and ask if you are ready to live a new\r<br />life. You will say yes (no is not an option here). You will then choose your\r<br />new form using the race menu. \r<br />\r<br />After choosing your new form, you will be asked to choose a new life\r<br />for yourself. You have many different choices, for example dragonborn, \r<br />hunter, alchemist, mage, assassin, etc. After you make your choice,\r<br />you will receive a tome.\r<br />\r<br />When you read your tome, you will be teleported to a place suitable to\r<br />your chosen profession. You will also receive a random weapon or staff, \r<br />random clothes / armor, and other random things depending on your chosen\r<br />profession. For example, if you choose alchemist, you will receive ingredients\r<br />and potions.\r<br />\r<br />The game continues on normally until you die. When you die, you will be\r<br />given 3 choices.\r<br />\r<br />A: Return to the Hall of Beginnings.\r<br />You return to the hall of beginnings and choose a new life.\r<br />You get two extra choices.\r<br />    1. Retain all knowledge of your past life\r<br />\tall stats stay the same, and you keep all of your perks\r<br />    2. Forget all knowledge of your past life:      \r<br />\tall stats are reset, and you loose all of your perks\r<br />\tto reset your level back to 1, type the console command:\r<br />\tplayer.setlevel 1\r<br />\r<br />\t*When you choose this option, it will take a while\r<br />\tfor the next dialog to load because of the size of\r<br />\tthe script. Please be patient and do not press cancel.\r<br />        Unfortunately, you&#39;ll keep all the quests you were currently on unless I\r<br />        find a workaround that doesn&#39;t mess up the game. If you pick dragonborn,\r<br />        you will have the main quest in your journal no matter how many\r<br />        lives you live.\r<br />The contents of your inventory (excluding quest items) are in a chest to the left\r<br />of the sage&#39;s desk. After you retrieve your stuff (or leave it), you will then \r<br />choose another tome and go about your way.\r<br />\r<br />B:  Roam this world as a ghost.\r<br />You are transformed into a ghost. The bright side is no one can\r<br />harm you and you get to keep all of your items.\r<br />If you don&#39;t want NPCs to see you, type the console code:\r<br />tdetect\r<br />\r<br />*If your are bored of being a ghost, you can be resurrected.\r<br />Speak to Joric at Morthal&#39;s Highmoon hall. He will direct you\r<br />to where you can go to return to land of the living.\r<br />\r<br />C: Pray to the Divines for mercy.\r<br />Since I&#39;m an optimist, there is a 7 out of 10 chance the Divines\r<br />will help you. If the divines help you, Your health will be restored\r<br />to the base stat (100), and you&#39;ll live to fight another day.\r<br />If the divines refuse to help you, you will be doomed to roam\r<br />Tamriel as a ghost. (see B)\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />This mod requires a copy of skyrim & the latest update.\r<br />\r<br />Mod Conflicts:\r<br />* Other Alternate start mods\r<br />* Alternate Actors causes the after death portion of the mod not to work.\r<br />* Kuertee&#39;s Professions will not work with this mod unless you choose the Dragonborn tome.\r<br />* This mod is incompatible with Frostfall because of its sudden death feature. Thanks to Unsavory\r<br />for pointing this out. To fix this problem, follow these two steps:\r<br />\r<br />Step 1:\r<br />Turn off lethal exposure under Survival Settings, Exposure. \r<br />If you use SkyUI, you can open the Mod Configuration Menu, and go to the Gameplay page, and uncheck &#34;Exposure is Lethal&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Step 2:\r<br />Turn off Lethal frigid water under Survival Settings, Exposure, Water. If you use SkyUI, you can open the Mod Configuration Menu, and go to the Gameplay page, and uncheck &#34;Frigid Water is Lethal&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Update - Hall of Beginnings 2.0&#33;\r<br />* spruced up hall of beginnings\r<br />* random tome choice (excluding dragonborn and race specific tomes)\r<br />*  New tomes \r<br />      Forsworn (for breton characters) - suggested by LillithSuccubus  \r<br />      Thalmor (for altmer and bosmer characters) - suggested by LillithSuccubus \r<br />      Pirate - suggested by LillithSuccubus \r<br />      Khajiit Caravan  - suggested by LillithSuccubus\r<br />      Necromancer - suggested by Kinei \r<br />      Stronghold member (for Orc characters)  - suggested by Kinei\r<br />      Vigilant of Stendarr  - suggested by Kinei \r<br />      Town Guard  - suggested by Kinei \r<br />      Noble (and owner of Proudspire manor) - suggested by magickman12 \r<br />      Treasure Hunter  - suggested by Kinei\r<br />       Scholar - suggested by Kinei\r<br />* Some Minor fixes\r<br />\r<br />Future plans for this mod:\r<br />* better animations (the current ones are not good at all)\r<br />* voices for the sage, the priestess, and the souls waiting in the hall of beginnings\r<br />* I am open to any suggestions to make this a better mod\r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy my mod. :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",

There is a free one lying on the sage&#39;s desk, but you have to buy them from an alchemist once you have used that one up.\r<br />\r<br />* Reaper NPCs that will catch you if you are in ghost form and take you directly to the Hall of Beginnings. (Thanks to Kinei for that suggestion.)\r<br />\r<br />* For those of you who changed their mind about the main quest, I placed a tome of the Dragonborn in Helgen.\r<br />\r<br />* The Message to Whiterun civil war quest has been fixed so that you can finish it without having to be the dragonborn.
