  "descriptionHtml": "[b]New AV Package up!\r\nThanks to Wolverine2710 for making the AV package for me, and to Bedlambob for suggesting it, and for all of the hard work in helping me to get this awesome package!! [/b]\r\n\r\nWoo hoo!  My first official \\\"mod!\\\"\r\nSo I decided a few days ago to learn retexturing...and in the process, I came up with some cute animal patterns.  I was going for exotic patterns at first, but I also wanted to retexure some of the creatures into different species. There are still many animals I\\'ve yet to touch, and there are only five retextures so far, but eventually I will expand upon this once I have a better grasp of texture editing and such.  So expect an update soon.  :)  Also, I will expand upon this description once I\\'ve gotten everything laid out properly.\r\nFor now, I have the Automatic Variants version and a loose files version.  If anyone asks, I can also include an esp/bsa version. :)  \r\n\r\nEnjoy!!",
