  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"Veterans\\\" are pre-built characters, skilled and equipped in tune with the limitations of their experience. The entire game is unexplored, and adapted to your new level--allowing you to try out advanced play-styles and quest-lines without the hours of involved preliminaries.\r\n\r\nReign the male Altmer Shock Trooper, \r\nor Tsuni the female Altmer Shock Trooper\r\n\r\nThe Shock Trooper is a lightning-magic offensive powerhouse. Alteration magic reinforced Light Armor keeps the trooper on the front lines and fast on their feet. Enemies at a distance fall to the crack of the trooper\\'s Thunderbolts, and in melee confrontations the shock trooper covers foes in the plasma from Wall of Storms--all while swinging a sword and dodging opponent blows with considerable dexterity. \r\n\r\nThe Shock Trooper is always ready to take charge, without putting a positive or negative spin on the mission at hand (ok, ok¬¬). The priority is getting work done, with efficiency and alacrity. What tasks can the Shock Trooper get done for you?\r\n\r\nThe level 30 veteran has 29 unallocated Perk Points.\r\n\r\nTrooper Attributes:\r\n\t290 Magicka (+50 Highborn)\r\n\t200 Health\r\n\t100 Stamina\r\n\r\nTrooper Skills:\r\n\tAlteration 100\r\n\tLight Armor, Destruction 75\r\n\tRestoration, Speech, One-Handed 50\r\n\tConjuration, Illusion, Archery, Alchemy, Enchanting, Sneak, Smithing, Pickpocket, Heavy Armor, Two-Handed, Block, Lockpicking 15\r\n\r\n1*(100*101/2) + 2*(75*76/2) + 3*(50*51/2) + 12*(15*16/2)\r\n=16,015 [url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Total Experience Spent In Skills[/url]\r\n\r\nTrooper Spells:\r\n\tMagelight, Detect Life, Telekinesis, Waterbreathing, Detect Dead, Ebonyflesh, Paralyze, Dragonhide, Mass Paralysis, Equilibrium\r\n\tBound Sword, Bound Bow\r\n\tLightning Bolt, Lightning Rune, Chain Lightning, Lightning Cloak, Thunderbolt, Wall of Storms, Lightning Storm\r\n\tSteadfast Ward, Close Wounds, Heal Other, Repel Lesser Undead, Turn Undead\r\n\r\nTrooper Shouts:\r\n\tDisarm (Zun Haal Viik)\r\n\tStorm Call (Strun, Bah, Qo)\r\n\t\r\nTrooper Powers:\r\n\tImperial Luck (Find more gold)\r\n\tHighborn (+50 Magicka & Daily Fast Regen)\r\n\tProwler\\'s Profit (Find more jewels)\r\n\r\nTrooper Gear:\t\r\n\tRing of Recovery\t00100e5c\r\n\tNecklace of Renewal\t0010df5e\r\n\tGlass Armor of Eminent Destruction\t0010cfa0\r\n\tGlass Helmet of Eminent Destruction\t000d53c8\r\n\tGlass Gauntlets of Major Wielding\t000d53af\r\n\tGlass Boots of Brawn\t000d536f\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nInstallation and Use:\r\nUnzip the saved game(s) from the download to your .../My Games/Skyrim/Saves folder, then load it in Skyrim.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1.0 Shock Trooper is ready to go. Fun, powerful.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhenever a character earns a rank, r, in a skill they gain r-1 experience. So when a character has 0 in all skills they have zero experience, and when they have 100 in all skills, at around level 81, they have 90,900 experience. A level 30 character should have about 15,865 total experience summed from their skills.\r\n\r\nTaken Veterans should look good with any texture or mesh mods you may use, if any. The mods used in the screenshots include:\r\nFace Textures (Female): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3563]Coverwomen[/url]\r\nFace Textures (Male): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=26]Detailed Faces[/url]\r\n\r\nLook in the discussions area for the batch commands allowing you to make a veteran out of a character you\\'ve created yourself!\r\n\r\nMore Info:\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Experience Table[/url]\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimCharBatch]Tips on making your own veterans[/url]\r\n\r\nDrop a Taken Veteran save game in your Saves folder and load it up.
