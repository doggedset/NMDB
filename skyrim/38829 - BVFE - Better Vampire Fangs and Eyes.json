  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff0000][size=3]\r<br />ATTN SKYRIM SPECIAL EDITION PC AND CONSOLE USERS&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I will be porting all my mods to SSE for PC, and all but DVA (because SKSE) for consoles. Porting will start in December (getting new computer) so it will be a bit of a wait, but I am planning on updating each and adding a bit more content so hopefully it will be worth it.\r<br />\r<br />To impatient players and modders: I&#39;m totally fine if you want to port them for personal use, but do so at your own risk and please do not post them. Some will be getting quite a bit of clean up to get the size down, and running the current mod and then updating may cause issues.\r<br />\r<br />Stay tuned.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is now available for SSE Xbox One:\r<br />https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3387461\r<br />https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3387441\r<br />https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3387398[/size][/color][color=#ff0000][size=6]\r<br />\r<br />Version:[/size][/color]\r<br />1.0 - Initial release\r<br />\r<br />1.1 - Added a new main file that includes fangs and new glowing eyes (see images). Includes an updated eye mesh that retains glow, but also includes the double sided lashes and invisibility fix. If you&#39;ve previously installed one of the other two packages, this can be installed over top, just replace all files.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE: Two additional files have been added:\r<br />No Bloodshot Eyes replaces the second bloodshot texture with the non-bloodshot version\r<br />Serana, Valerica and Harkon replaces their headmeshes with new ones that don&#39;t have glowing eyes (everything else is original though). This is not my stand-alone replacer, but for those who don&#39;t want to wait for it or want these characters to look close to vanilla.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE 2:\r<br />ECE Patch has been added. If you are using ECE, please install your desired main package first, then install the ECE patch and overwrite when prompted.\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6]Requirements:[/size][/color]\r<br />Dawnguard\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6]Recommended:[/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34346]Smile in HD[/url] by zzjay\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10870]Puppeteer Master[/url] by JohnB\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35303]Female Facial Animation[/url] by nao4288\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6]Overview:[/size][/color]\r<br />This mod changes the fangs and eyes of vampires to make it more believable that they could mingle with humans. Fangs are shorter for males and now present for females. Eyes are non glowing and red but a little more subtle. This mod does not effect Khajiit or Argonians. Orc vampires will get the eyes from this mod, but not the fangs.\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6]Fangs:[/size][/color]\r<br />For males, the bottom fangs have been removed and the top fangs have been shortened. The female fangs have been created from scratch instead of reusing the male mouth, and look similar to the male fangs. Vampires should now look capable of actually biting something without unhinging their jaws. You should also be able to see the tips of their fangs while talking.\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6]Eyes:[/size][/color]\r<br />Male and female eye meshes have been replaced with non-glowing meshes. A couple other small changes to the meshes include double-sided eye lashes and a fix for the glitch that happens when you use any kind of invisibility and the eye texture gets scrambled. Also included are new vampire eye textures (for both the player vampire eyes and the other vampire eyes that some NPCs have). The eye texture is based off of MrLenski&#39;s dremora eye texture included in [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4869]Covereyes[/url]\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6]Facegendata:[/size][/color]\r<br />By default the above mesh replacers will only be visible on the player. I&#39;ve also included facegendata for most of the vampire NPCs in the game, so they will have the same eyes and fangs. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]WARNING:[/color] If you are using another mod that makes changes to any vampire NPCs, including but not limited to EEO, overwriting the head mesh with the ones that I&#39;ve provided could cause miscolored heads. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]FYI:[/color] Serana, Harkon, Valerica and Alva are not &#34;true&#34; vampires by race, and therefore will not get the fangs or eyes from this mod (they will get the new eye texture, but the mesh will still glow). I&#39;ve released a companion mod that makes changes to them that can be found here: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/39549]BVFE - Serana and Family[/url]\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6]Options[/size] (choose one):[/color]\r<br />Fangs and Eyes - This includes everything listed above. \r<br />\r<br />Fangs and Glowing Eyes - Includes fangs and an updated eye mesh that retains glow, but also includes the double sided lashes and invisibility fix. New glow compatible textures also.\r<br />\r<br />Fangs Only - For those who prefer glowing eyes, this option is only the new fangs for both player and NPCs. \r<br />\r<br />Fangs Player Only / Eyes Player Only (you can choose one or both) - A la carte options for those with modded NPC vampires or those who prefer to generate the facegendata themselves. These options will only effect the player.\r<br />\r<br />No Bloodshot Eyes - This replaces the second bloodshot texture with the non-bloodshot version\r<br />\r<br />Serana, Valerica and Harkon - I&#39;m moving this file to the old file section because Madcat221 has released a new mod that does the same thing except with fangs&#33; Big thanks to him for releasing it. And he&#39;s released both a glowing and non glowing eye version.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/39951]Seranafangs[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Of course there is also my reimagined Serana and Valerica, now packaged with madcat221&#39;s fanged Harkon:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/39549]BVFE Serana and Family[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />ECE Patch - If you are using ECE, please install your desired main package first, then install the ECE patch and overwrite when prompted.\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6]Installation:[/size][/color]\r<br />Pick your option and install with NMM, or download manually, unzip and drop in your data folder.\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6]Credits:[/size][/color]\r<br />MrLenski for his [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4869]Covereyes[/url] mod.\r<br />Nuska for her [url=http://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/Working_with_Skyrim_head_TRIs]awesome tutorial[/url] on editing TRI files.\r<br />DoubleH for testing and screenshots.\r<br />Bethesda for making this wonderful game and supporting the mod community.",
