realism, immersive, immersion, natural, supernatural.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00][size=3]Athletic Jump is a mod of my own creation, it changes the default ability to jump in the game to be more in my opinion realistic.~\r<br />\r<br />What makes my jumping mod different than all the other jumping mods out there?~ Well, the other jumping mods just seem to alter the height of jumping and little to nothing else, but mine changes how FAR you can jump, how HIGH you can jump, as well as how far you can FALL before getting HURT and it doesn&#39;t do this to the point of being ridiculous and game-breaking thus it is not considered a &#34;Cheat Mod&#34;.~[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]This WILL NOT allow you to jump onto the roof of a house with just 1 jump.~\r<br />\r<br />This WILL NOT allow you to jump of a cliff and be not at all hurt.~\r<br />\r<br />This WILL make your jumping ability more &#39;athletic&#39; to be some what more of a &#39;gymnast&#39; athlete, perfect for trained stealthy agile characters.~\r<br />\r<br />This mod comes in only 2 types, USE ONLY 1 AT A TIME: \r<br />\r<br />[b]Athletic Jump[/b][/size] [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FFFF][size=4][b]Supernatural Jump[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]ATHLETIC JUMP AND SUPERNATURAL JUMP ARE NOT ANIMATION MODS, THESE MODS &#34;ONLY&#34; AFFECT THE PHYSICAL RULES OF THE GAME TO ALLOW MORE REALISTIC AND SUPERNATURAL JUMPING, THESE MODS DO NOT AFFECT HOW ANY OF YOUR JUMP WILL &#34;LOOK&#34;&#33;~[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b][color=#FFFF00]If you want BETTER JUMPING ANIMATIONS I HIGHLY recommend[/color] [color=#00FF00]Davjes&#39;s Jump Animations, the link can be found below in the Recommendations section.~[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/49167-2-1388296868.gif[/img]\r<br />Werewolf Leaping\r<br />[url=http://s702.photobucket.com/user/jordanwoolfe/media/jumpinglycan.gif.html]Gif Source[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FFFF][size=20][u]Supernatural Jump[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Have you SEEN the SIZE of those HUGE Werewolf haunches (legs)?&#33;~ THEY&#39;RE HUGE&#33;&#33;~ You&#39;ve got to be JOKING if you&#39;re telling me I can&#39;t LEAP great distances with those HUGE legs and fall from great heights to (without being invulnerable to falling damage)&#33;~\r<br />\r<br />NOW THIS IS A REALITY WITH THIS MOD&#33;&#33;~\r<br />\r<br />Supernatural Jump is made more for characters who are supernaturally gifted: PERFECT for a Werewolf character or a Vampire character, WITHOUT BEING IMMUNE TO FALL DAMAGE&#33;~[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]IMPORTANT NEW UPDATED INFORMATION: Werewolves Jump Higher and Farther HAS BEEN UPDATED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH Athletic Jump Type 1 mod, THIS MEANS YOU CAN HAVE A CHARACTER WITH IMPROVED REALISTIC JUMPS USING Athletic Jump Type 1 AND HAVE A STRONGER VERSION OF THIS SAME JUMPING ABILITY [u]ONLY IN WEREWOLF FORM[/u]&#33;&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Before you had to choose between using either Athletic Jump Type 1 or Supernatural Jump Type 2 and either have always &#34;realistic jumping&#34; or always &#34;supernatural jumping&#34; regardless of whether you were in Werewolf Form or not, cridus&#39;s new update has changed this.~ Try it out and tell us what you think&#33;~ ^_^\r<br />\r<br />For everyone&#39;s power of choice Supernatural Jump Type 2 will still be available for downloading, each are different so try out whatever you like.~\r<br />\r<br />Just remember if you use Athletic Jump Type 1 with Werewolves Jump Higher and Farther load Werewolves Jump Higher and Farther AFTER Athletic Jump Type 1.~\r<br />\r<br />Here is the link to Werewolves Jump Higher and Farther:[/size] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32431/?][size=4][u][color=00FF00]Werewolves Jump Higher and Farther (click these words)[/color][/u][/size][/url][size=4].~[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=00FF00][u]YOU CAN GET [u]PROGRESSIVE FALLING DAMAGE PROTECTION[/u] IF YOU USE MINE AND MichaelDusk&#39;S OTHER MOD WITH THIS MOD TO: Werewolves Unleashed&#33;&#33;~\r<br />\r<br />SCROLL DOWN FOR MORE DETAILS&#33;~[/u][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00][size=5]WARNING: THIS ALTERS THE GAME&#39;S GLOBAL JUMPING HEIGHT FOR EVERY ONE, BUT USUALLY ONLY THE PLAYER CAN ACTUALLY JUMP IN THE GAME, THIS MEANS THAT FOR ALL YOUR CHARACTERS IN YOUR GAME WILL JUMP HIGHER, FARTHER, AND FALL FARTHER BEFORE TAKING DAMAGE.~[/size] \r<br />\r<br />[size=6]GREATER WARNING: THIS DOES NOT MAKE YOU IMMUNE TO FALLING DAMAGE SO IF YOU JUMP FROM A REALLY HIGH PLACE AND YOU HAVE NO FALLING DAMAGE PROTECTION YOU WILL PROBABLY DIE&#33;&#33;~[/size] \r<br />\r<br />[size=7]CITIES ARE LOADED SEPARATELY FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN[/color][/size] [size=7][color=#00FFFF]SKYRIM[/color][color=#FFFF00], UNLESS YOU ARE USING[/color] [color=#FFFFFF]THE OPEN CITIES MOD[/color][color=#FFFF00]: DO NOT JUMP OVER CITY WALLS OR YOU MIGHT END UP FALLING THROUGH A HOLE IN THE WORLD OR OTHER STRANGE THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN&#33;&#33;~[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FFFF][size=10]Requirements:[/size] [size=4]Shouldn&#39;t be any requirements that I know of other than having the Skyrim game for PC.~[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=10]Manual Installation:[/size] [size=4]Simply extract the contents of the [color=#FFFF00]Athletic Jump OR Supernatural Jump[/color] .RAR file using an extraction program like WinRAR into your Computer/LocalDisk(C:)/ProgramFiles(x86)/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim/Data/ folder OR where ever your default installation folder for The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim is then place in the Data folder of your TheElderScrollsVSkyrim folder.~[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00][size=10]Compatibility:[/size] [size=4]Put this NEAR THE BOTTOM of your mod load list for MAXIMUM compatibility, this should be compatible with mostly every thing although I always put this NEAR THE BOTTOM of my mod load list just in case, if you are using a Bashed Patch just place this BEFORE the Bashed Patch.~\r<br />\r<br />If you are using my other mods More Believable Carrying Weight [color=#FFFF00]and[/color] [color=#00FFFF]Werewolves Unleashed (created with MichaelDusk)[/color] [color=#FFFF00]then place this BEFORE these other mods.~[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FFFF][size=10]Recommendations:[/color][/color] [size=4]I recommend using this mod WITH my other mod called [size=5]More Believable Carrying Weight[/size] to start out with a more realistic carrying capacity that is different for each race, place in your mod list load order AFTER [color=#FFFF00][size=5]Athletic Jump or Supernatural Jump[/size][/color].~[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48929/?][color=#FFFFFF][size=5]More Believable Carrying Weight[/size][/color][/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#00FFFF]I also HIGHLY recommend using [size=5]Supernatural Jump[/size] WITH MichaelDusk&#39;s and mine&#39;s other mod called [size=5]Werewolves Unleashed[/size] if you like playing as a Werewolf and you want that PERFECT jumping ability as a supernatural creature, place [size=5]Werewolves Unleashed[/size] AFTER[/color] [color=#FFFF00][size=5]Athletic Jump or Supernatural Jump[/size][/color] [color=#00FFFF]in your mod order list.~[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48956/?][color=#00FFFF][size=5]Werewolves Unleashed[/size][/color][/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Also you can try my other mod series called &#34;Realistic Items&#34;: a set of VERY simple mods that increases the weight and the value of most items in the game.~[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49312/?][color=#00FF00][size=5][u]Realistic Items[/u][/size][/color][/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#00FF00]ALL MODS ARE COMPATIBLE AND WORK WELL TOGETHER&#33;~[/color]\r<br />\r<br />If you want to use all of my (and MichaelDusk&#39;s) mods together, then place them in this order: \r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]Athletic Jump or Supernatural Jump[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FFFF]Werewolves Unleashed[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF00]Any of the Realistic Items series[/color]\r<br />More Believable Carrying Weight[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#FFFF00]If you want BETTER JUMPING ANIMATIONS I HIGHLY recommend[/color] [color=#00FF00]Davjes&#39;s:[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br

Flipping Gymnastic Forward Jump&#33;~[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FF00][size=10]Feedback:[/size] Please tell me all about your experiences with this mod, take pictures,
