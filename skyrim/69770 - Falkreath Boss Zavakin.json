  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a fun boss 10x stronger than the Ebony Warrior to Falkreath. You will find him in the Falkreath cemetery. If not, he&#39;s probably wandering around somewhere in Falkreath. Keep in mind: He wants to find you more than you want to find him. He will blast you with lightning storms, he will shout you down. He will spawn daedra creatures, and he will make it rain storms down upon you and your companion. Yes, I said companion. Because there is no way you will defeat him on your own. But if you&#39;re up for the challenge, feel free to install this mod just for the battle. If you don&#39;t mind it, keep it on. But keep in mind, there will be an overpowered monster in Falkreath waiting for you. Always... at least until you kill him.\r<br />\r<br />He&#39;s basically a mage knight, endowed with unimaginable might. Can you beat him?",
