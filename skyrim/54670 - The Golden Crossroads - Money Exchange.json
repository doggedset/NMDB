  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/QtD7v94.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve always been a huge fan of the mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51871/?]Coins of Tamriel[/url], and recently decided to move to the script-less version of it to reduce strain on my game. But now I needed a place to sell off the new coins in order to gain their value - I didn&#39;t just go around selling them to Belethor or Lucan. So here we are.\r<br />\r<br />The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC, is fully navmeshed and has one tiny script, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Coins of Tamriel is recommended, [u]but not required[/u]. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== ABOUT ==[/color]\r<br />This new merchant will buy coins, banknotes, jewelry, gems, ingots and the occasional piece of clutter, from 8 AM to 11 PM. Since I cannot for the life of mine get NPCs to lock doors, they will stay open but guards will be about. Maybe it offers thieves out there some challenge... There&#39;s also a non-respawning cupboard for the player to store valuables for safekeeping.\r<br />\r<br />As an extra thing I wanted to have, I added banknotes with a base value of 200. There is an extremely low chance (10%) of finding one these banknotes around, so don&#39;t worry about ending up swimming in them. They are added to only one seldom-used leveled list, LootSmallTreasure10, via a small script to avoid compatibility issues. If you don&#39;t like these, feel free to remove them with TES5EDIT or the Creation Kit.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== LOCATION ==[/color]\r<br />The Golden Crossroads is located in Haafingar hold, on the road between Dragon Bridge and Solitude. There is a visible map marker so you can fast travel to it right away. Due to a request, there&#39;s an optional file that moves the building to Solitude, outside the Blue Palace yard. I will put this bluntly so we&#39;re clear: in this new location, [u]I DO NOT CARE ABOUT COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER MODS[/u]. I did not plan on moving the building to start with, so if you have a house or some other mod that conflicts with the bank in Solitude, feel free to move it around yourself with the Creation Kit. Thank you~\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== COMPATIBILITY ==[/color]\r<br />Besides [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51871/?]Coins of Tamriel[/url] (V2 Legendary Edition - script free version), the mod is also compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11701/?]Valuable Coins[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48195/?]Skyrim Coin Replacer Redux[/url]. Thanks, emieri00&#33; If you&#39;d like to make another mod compatible with mine, make sure to give your new items any of these keywords: [i]VendorItemCurrency[/i] (a new keyword I made specifically for this mod), [i]VendorItemClutter[/i], [i]VendorItemGem[/i], [i]VendorItemJewelry[/i] or [i]VendorItemOreIngot[/i], so the merchant can recognize them.\r<br />\r<br />A patch for RS Children can be found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70119/?]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />If you do not have Coins of Tamriel, have it but don&#39;t use the version with the Dwemer and Nordic coins, or just don&#39;t like the indoor price chart I made, there&#39;s an alternate texture included in the main download. Simply extract it to your Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== INSTALLATION ==[/color]\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== CREDITS ==[/color]\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51871/?]Coins of Tamriel[/url], by Force70, for inspiration and help.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12394/?]Celtic Decor for Skyrim I[/url] by DarkRider.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/?]Modders Resource Pack[/url] by Oaristys and Tony67.\r<br />- Curtains from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52049/?]New World Modder Resource[/url] by breti.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53192/?]Elianoras Extra Resources[/url] by Elianora.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36756/?]Berts Bits And Bobs Resources For Modders[/url] by berticus0001.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14133/?]FoodContainer[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30599/?]Alchemy Clutter[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30600/?]Ingredients Drawer[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14135]BookSets[/url] Resources by Blary.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33812/?]Dwemer Coin[/url], [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1473-insanitys-wall-charts/]Wall Chart[/url], [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1135-insanitys-celtic-coin/]Celtic Coin[/url] and [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1319-insanitys-clutter-stuffs/]Clutter Stuffs[/url] by InsanitySorrow.\r<br />- Curio cabinet by Lilith and owl sculpture by Tamira at [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1330-the-tesa-skyrim-resource-kit-project/]The TESA Skyrim Resource Kit Project[/url].\r<br />- Banknote front courtesy of [url=http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-6598000/stock-photo-old-banknote-rouble-year-russia.html]ShutterStock[/url]; back courtesy of [url=http://www.123rf.com/photo_2087187_vintage-banknote-100-rouble-1919-year-russia.html]123RF[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/donate/?mode=straight&id=2543917][img]http://i.imgur.com/V6qmsU9.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
