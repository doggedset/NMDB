  "descriptionHtml": "Playing Tytanis\\'s mod, loving the new mounts? But how many time do you have to Alt-tab out of the window to type the complicated id to summon them near you. What if you get one letter, one number wrong? Wrote it down? Your handwriting is awful! This is a range of easy commands which you just have to copy into your data folder, all you have to remember is each different word is preceded by the word \\'bat,\\' then a space, then the mount you want.\r\n\r\nbat bear\r\nbat sabrecat\r\nbat mammoth\r\n\r\nNo more alt-tabs or looking at your smudgy writing!\r\n\r\nRequired... Nexus Mod Manager to put Tytanis on your second load order, and Tytanis mod itself, obviously.\r\n\r\nHere is a video on how to do it- 3 minutes in.\r\n",
