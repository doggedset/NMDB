These Spell Books can be crafted for any spell in the players inventory using a new crafting station called a Scribes Lectern. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/Daiyus37/Modding/Mod%20Page%20Description%20Banners/02.%20Description_zpsk0w9jguz.jpg[/img]\r<br />Library of the Arcane allows the prospective wizard to actually be a scholar and write down his accumulated knowledge, allowing it be stored in a library. These written books are referred to as Spell Books, not to be confused with Spell Tomes. In this mod Spell Tomes are completely untouched, you gain spells just like Vanilla (or any other mod) intended. This mod simply allows an extension of that. By using the custom crafting station called a Scribes Lectern you can use an inkwell, a roll of paper, and a piece of leather to write a Spell Book for any spell currently in your inventory. This includes spells that don&#39;t have Spell Tomes, or are learned via quests. When the crafted Spell Book is read either in your inventory or when on a bookshelf a script will activate and detect whether you have the spell in your inventory, and offer you a choice accordingly: Learn/Forget the spell, or read the book itself?\r<br />\r<br />And that&#39;s it. A simple, lore-friendly, immersive way of managing your spell inventory. I hope you enjoy it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />My current plans for this mod are to make the Scribes Lectern a unique station, complete with animation. I&#39;m also working with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/4174403/?]Hyacathusarullistad[/url] who is writing the Spell Book texts. These will be added to the mod as he completes them. I&#39;ve also gained permissions from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/6726521/?]Edwarr[/url] to use his textures for my Spell Books to differentiate them from Spell Tomes; I&#39;m hoping to get that working at some point as well (texturing is something new for me). Currently the only available Scribes Lectern is in Dragonsreach by Farengar&#39;s other crafting stations. I want to put one in every court wizard&#39;s area.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/Daiyus37/Modding/Mod%20Page%20Description%20Banners/04.%20Compatibility_zpshyyfubqq.jpg[/img]\r<br />While not incompatable with other spell mods, you won&#39;t be able to create Spell Books for spells added by other mods until a plugin is made for the recipes. I&#39;ll make one or two of these for major spell compilations, then write a guide to show others how make other mods work with LotA.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/Daiyus37/Modding/Mod%20Page%20Description%20Banners/05.%20Changelog_zpsetqqzt5k.jpg[/img]\r<br />1.0.0 – Initial release.\r<br />1.0.1 - Scribes Lecterns added to Jarls Palaces and Longhouses.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/Daiyus37/Modding/Mod%20Page%20Description%20Banners/07.%20Credits_zpsz3pv5juj.jpg[/img]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/4174403/?]Hyacathusarullistad[/url] for writing the Spell Books.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/6726521/?]Edwarr[/url] for allowing the use of his textures from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58187/?]Edwarrs Spell Tome Books[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1368.photobucket.com/albums/ag172/Daiyus37/Modding/Mod%20Page%20Description%20Banners/08.%20Permissions_zpsprqhohzd.jpg[/img]\r<br />I have a very simple permissions policy; if it’s my own work then it’s open source. You may do what you like with it. Any part of my work that belongs to somebody else, you must gain their permission to use that part (check the credits). I have two stipulations: Firstly, any work you release that incorporates any of my work must be released as open source as well (that means you MUST NOT charge money for it). Secondly, any credits given on my work must be given on yours as well. ",
