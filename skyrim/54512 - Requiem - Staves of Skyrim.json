  "descriptionHtml": "The purpose of this mod is to make Staves of Skyrim more compatible with Requiem and Hard Times.\r<br />\r<br />I found this mod today and loved the level of immersion the mod brings to the table plus it&#39;s practicality and coolness.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0\r<br />\r<br />If Staves of Skyrim was loaded after Requiem it would alter the Requiem modified staffs weight, names and monetary value to the Staves of Skyrim states, we do not want that. Also Staves of Skyrim changes the names of the Block perks.\r<br />\r<br />This mod fixes that and reverts them back identically to Requiem values.\r<br />\r<br />Staves of Skyrim itself adds in new perks to the Block tree for staff related perks so if you&#39;re not playing a mage type then you might want to uninstall the mod. This mod is mostly for mages anyway.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements and Load Order;\r<br />\r<br />- Requiem\r<br />- Requiem - Resources\r<br />- Requiem - Hard Times\r<br />- Staves of Skyrim \r<br />- Requiem - Staves of Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />If you have any issues then please let me know.\r<br />",
