  "descriptionHtml": "Project: Roadsigns Redone\r\nAuthor: Hanaisse\r\nVersion: 1.0 \r\nRelease Date: 3/19/2013\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.1 - 3/20/2013 - Fixed some minor mesh position issues. Apologies for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nDescription:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nA mesh and texture replacer for all of Skyrim\\'s roadsigns to enhance their look and make them easier to read. They still retain their aged and weathered look, just ... updated.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nDetails:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThis replacer uses my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33392]Blank Roadsigns Resource[/url] to replace all the roadsigns, including the sign post, with higher quality meshes and textures.\r\nEach mesh is re-uv mapped for better clarity and each texture is new in a 1024x512 size (same as the Hires texture pack).\r\n\r\nThis is a mesh and texture replacer only. No other changes have been made to placement or environmental enhancement.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended as a compliment; [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33393/]Point the Way[/url], which adds in some signs that Bethesda forgot and additional roadsign placements.\r\n\r\n\r\n==================\r\nInstallation:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nExtract the archive into your Data folder or drop into your BAIN folder to install with Wrye Bash.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nUn-Installation:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nDelete the folders;\r\nmeshes\\\\clutter\\\\signage\\\\roadsigns\r\ntextures\\\\clutter\\\\signage\\\\roadsigns\r\n\r\nor uninstall through Wrye Bash.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nIncompatible:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThis will overwrite any existing roadsign meshes \\\\ textures.\r\nOther roadsign textures will not be compatible with these new meshes unless they were created with my Blank Roadsign Resource.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nChangelog:\r\n==================\r\n\r\n3/20/2013 v1.1 - Fixed some minor mesh position issues.\r\n3/19/2013 - Initial Release\r\n\r\n==================\r\nContact Details:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nI can be contacted via PM or comments here.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nCredits:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\nThanks to InsanitySorrow for the ReadMe Generator this ReadMe is based on.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nLicensing/Legal:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nDo not upload this package to any other site and claim it as your own.
