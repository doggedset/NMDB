  "descriptionHtml": "First off, thank you for taking a look at my mod. It\\'s just one of many player home mod\\'s here on the nexus. \r\n\r\nWhen I started creating this home several months ago I wanted a change from some player homes on the nexus that are \\\"just to much\\\". I wanted something the fit the game but felt unique at the same time. For me this home contains everything I would need without over doing it. Hopefully you enjoy this mod as much as I do.\r\n\r\n(Update)\r\n\r\n [9/19/12]\r\n- Better Screen Shots are up\r\n- Working on first update\r\n\r\n(Features)\r\n\r\n- Full Crafting Setup\r\n- Beautiful Location\r\n- Fully Nav-Meshed and Companion Friendly\r\n- Garden\r\n- Smoke House\r\n- Indoor Archery Range\r\n- Secret Entrance\r\n- Study\r\n- Stable\r\n- Great Neighbor\r\n\r\n\r\n(Notes)\r\n\r\nI have uploaded two versions of this mod, one that requires Lanterns of Skyrim (LOS) and one that doesn\\'t. However I do not know if the non LOS works correctly, as I use LOS, so please let me know if it works for those of you that do not use LOS. Using LOS will allow you to chose the color  of the torches and lanters in this mod.\r\n\r\n(Future Plans)\r\n\r\n- Make Property Purchasable (started)\r\n- Add Ability to hire a guard i.e. (dog/housecarl/gounds keeper/etc)\r\n- Add backstory (started)\r\n- Add Spare Bedroom\r\n- Make a couple versions that change the basment to better fit different play styles (If there is enough interest)\r\n\r\n(To-Do List)\r\n\r\n- Add better Weapon Plaques (working on - has issues)\r\n- Make it so when fast traveling that horse appear in stable\r\n- Add salt barrel to smoke house (done)\r\n- Lock Basement Door (done)\r\n\r\n(Bugs)\r\n\r\n- I had issues when playing that my companion would sometimes not cross the bridge, if this happens to you please let me know.\r\n- If you find anymore bugs or exploding clutter please let me know.\r\n\r\n(Compatibility)\r\n\r\n- The house is right next door to Anise\\'s Cabin but it does not change anything about that cell.\r\n- Any mod that changes the area right next to Anise\\'s Cabin may not work with this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this mod feel free, just drop me a message so I know. I\\'ll be happy just to know you want to work on it.",
