  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />I havent updated the mod in forever which unfortunately causes CTDs but Varakz has created a patch which should help with that. The patch can be downloaded here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27276/?tab=2&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D27276&pUp=1\r<br />\r<br />Check out the video section for a mod review by ArsenalRobert and also an awesome video by Johanwh showing the difference with and without the mod.\r<br />\r<br />[color=&#34;#FFFF00&#34;]I disabled the cooking spit for the food merchant and inn for immersion, so you actually buy food from her.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds alot of objects and visuals to the outskirts of Whiterun, it is adviseable to have a mid-high range pc to run it without any lag. Optionally you can download and install one of the older versions which is more stable but has less content, version 0.3.7 and 0.4 seem to be good options. \r<br />\r<br />So if you have any lag or problems try one of those versions, I don&#39;t have any beta testers so I always ask for feedback from the community. Don&#39;t be afraid to report a bug you find, but also remember we do this voluntarily.\r<br />\r<br />[color=&#34;#9ACD32&#34;][size=&#34;4&#34;][b]Change log[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[u]0.4.7.5[/u]\r<br />[list]\r<br />Big kudos to Varakz for helping to edit and clean the mod&#33;&#33;\r<br />(this will be back up for download as soon as I include the facegen data in the edit as NPCs had neck seams)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[u]0.4.7[/u]\r<br />[list]\r<br />File is larger because I have included the faceGen data with the mod, so NPCs have proper face textures.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Warehouse redone to fit more with Whiterun architecture\r<br />[*]Fixed navmesh errors\r<br />[*]Fixed warehouse worker not doing his chores\r<br />[*]Added stable boy to inn and storage room for him to live in\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[u]0.4.5[/u]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]New Warehouse building\r<br />[*]3 new NPCs.

It contains a few well placed stalls with NPC merchants and an inn on the main road outside skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />For immersion the &#34;gate&#34; merchants only sell common things as they are just road side hawkers. It also allows the in-city sellers to continue being useful. \r<br />\r<br />The drinks merchant does not usually sell in the day time,this is on purpose as I thought it more realistic for him to sell late into the night(3am) rather than early in the day. The food seller also works till about 12 midnight as well. \r<br />\r<br />I also use [color=&#34;#00FFFF&#34;]Cozier Villages [/color]mod which adds lantern posts all around the cities in Skyrim although I have modified my copy of the mod for personal use. \r<br />\r<br />This mod does not interfere with the travelling Khajit  caravan outside Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=&#34;#9ACD32&#34;][size=&#34;4&#34;]Future Plans[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Rich group that visit the inn twice a week and use the high table\r<br />[*]Shoppers\r<br />[*]Late night drinkers\r<br />[*]Children beggars\r<br />[*]Few Hovels for shoppers/merchants\r<br />[*]Weekly Caravans\r<br />[*]Possibly more stalls\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[color=&#34;#9ACD32&#34;][b][size=&#34;4&#34;]Extra info[/size][/b][/color]\r<br />As it is my first mod pls be gentle and give constructive criticism and advice(advice will be awesome but not \r<br />ridiculous requests). Also if anyone (especially someone good with scripting npcs) wants to team up, I am more \r<br />than happy to share the burden.\r<br />\r<br />And a warning ahead of time, I have not reached the civil war which I read some people talking about which I guess\r<br /> happens in Whiterun. I can see the barricades and stuff in the CK so I built around them but I cannot vouch for how\r<br /> this mod will affect the game as I have not reached that part. \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=&#34;#9ACD32&#34;][size=&#34;4&#34;]Compatible mods[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />This mod should be compatible with [url=file.php?id=10206]Cozier Villages - Outdoor Lighting by Big Dan[/url]\r<br />Compatible and highly recommended to use [url=file.php?id=15776]7K Better Whiterun - City Under Construction - BETA by TheFPSmachine[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=&#34;#9ACD32&#34;][size=&#34;4&#34;]Translations[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />This mod is also available in Japanese the mod patches can be found here \r<br />[color=&#34;#F60&#34;]http://www.4shared.com/zip/LhtPCrXa/WhiterunOutskirtsMarket037_JPP.html[/color] by 2ch.net Japanese localization project team  Current version: 0.3.7\r<br />\r<br />& also \r<br />\r<br />[color=&#34;#F60&#34;]http://skup.dip.jp/up/up01894.zip[/color] by Hydragoon  Current version: 0.3.0.3\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=&#34;#9ACD32&#34;][b][size=&#34;4&#34;]Known Bugs[/size][/b][/color]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]When using a torch in the inn the lighting is glitched,if anyone knows how to fix it please let me know.
