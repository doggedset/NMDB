  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#3c78d8][size=5][b]Displays - Dragon Claw and others[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Displays to use in your mods for:\r<br />\r<br />Dragon Claws\r<br />Dragon Priest & DB Masks\r<br />Bug Jars\r<br />Black Books\r<br />Elder Scrolls\r<br />Daedric Artifacts\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s not a simple copy and paste, but I&#39;ve tried to make it as simple as possible.\r<br />All the triggers and scripts are already set up so it&#39;s just a case of copy and paste and [color=#ff0000]RENAME[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Put the Display.esp in the data folder and the scripts in the script folder.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s how you put them into your mod:\r<br />Open your mod and this one in the CK, with your mod as the active one.\r<br />Copy any of the displays from the 000Displays cell and paste them in your mod (Make sure you have selected both the static and activator)\r<br />Press the M key if you cant see the activators\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s where the fun starts, you need to rename most of activators and statics:\r<br />Double click one of the orange activator boxes or static objects to open the reference.\r<br />Then click the [color=#ff0000]&#34;Edit Base&#34;[/color] button. If the ID field starts with RENAME, rename it to something else\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/59596-5-1414922281.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Eg &#34;RENAME_ClawGlass&#34; becomes &#34;mymod_ClawGlass&#34; (This will create a new static or activator in your mod)\r<br />\r<br />Then click ok and yes to create a new form. Do this for each activator and static where the ID begins with &#34;RENAME&#34; (If the activator or static does not begin with RENAME, then it&#39;s a vanilla static and you don&#39;t need to create a new one)\r<br />\r<br />I find that the easiest way to do this is to first hide the activators (M key) and rename all the statics first, then select all the statics press &#39;1&#39; to hide them, press &#39;M&#39; to unhide the activators and rename them.\r<br />\r<br />Once that&#39;s done a you can arrange them any way you like, but the activator needs to stay with the static it refers to.\r<br />\r<br />You can check you&#39;ve renamed them all by checking the right cell view window and make sure no items have the word RENAME in them.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/59596-1-1414922289.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />One last thing, make sure that the Z-Rotation for each [color=#ff0000]Activator[/color] is [color=#ff0000]NOT zero[/color]. For some reason it wont work if it&#39;s zero.\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/59596-1-1417590944.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />You dont need to include this esp with your mod, but you do need to include the scripts.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]NOTE:[/color] Weapons and armor lose their smithing upgrades when put in a display as discovered byÂ  opusGlass. Possible solution in the comment section.\r<br />\r<br />Credit for the scripts go to Sjogga for his Dragon Claw Holder and Dragonborn masks script/tutorial and Grathagis for his variation of the Bust Mask script to work with the USKP update from the [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/754151-tutorials-without-youtoob/]Tutorials WITHOUT &#34;youtoob&#34; forum topic.[/url]",
