  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds an imperial Outpost/castle to the east of angas mill it has a castle interior and a village it is not complete yet. \r\n\r\nThe mod has alot off errors that need fixed but i just wanted to know what people thought of it, and if i should keep working on it or not. It needs more interiors, and people throughout the city but for now this will do and see what you think of it. On my computer half of the city dissapears and i cant figure out how to fix it. It works untill a certain time.\r\n\r\nBy all means muck about with it and see what you can edit or add. ",
