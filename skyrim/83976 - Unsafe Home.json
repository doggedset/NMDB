  "summary": "Nice view.  Risky location.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Whoever lives here risks the unstable foundation, the confined design, the inclement weather, the inadequate amenities, the deficient resources nearby, and of course, the perils of dragons roaming outside.  Teetering on the cliff between Whiterun and Riverwood, it probably violated too many Imperial construction regulations to receive a housing permit.  The deranged builder was probably sentenced to execution by unanimous vote.\r<br />\r<br />No DLCs or custom contents used on this illegal architecture, but passersby may feel free to endanger their own lives or modify as needed.",
