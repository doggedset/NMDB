  "summary": "Edited textures of the Green Lich from Undeath into White. (Red and Black options too)",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Intro:[/b] I love green, but the moldy puke green the Lich from Undeath has just wasn&#39;t my cup of tea, also i&#39;m roleplaying as a neutral/good utilitarian mage who uses Necromancy (and by extention Lichdom) as a means of immortality rather than the usual &#39;muwhaha i&#39;m so evil&#39; type of Necromancer. Red looks stylish and Black looks cool, White is simply an option for people who are roleplaying a good Lich like me or if people simply like the colour white. It also reminds me of the Dark Bishop from Dragon&#39;s Dogma...\r<br />\r<br />Please bear in mind this is my first attempt at editing Skyrim textures and it&#39;s very rough (as least when you open the files in GIMP or Photoshop) but it looks just fine in-game. If anyone wants to take this up an improve it and generally give it a tidy they&#39;re more then welcome just give me a mention if you do.\r<br />[b]\r<br />Installation:[/b] Since Undeath comes in BSA form you&#39;ll need to extract it, from there it should just be a matter of adding the files into the Skyrim/Data folder but I would always suggest backing up any files/folders you plan on chaning (I use Mod Organiser which makes it safer)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Update:[/b] I&#39;ve created an optional file which replaces the Red Lich with the White one too, why? Because when you use Black or Green when transforming back and fourth between Lich and Human forms the Lich defaults to Red for a momment, not terrible but just annoying. Use this if you also find this annoying or are currently using the Red Lich and want to replace that. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Update: [/b]Added Red and Black to White for people who have already done the ritural and picked those colours instead of Green\r<br />\r<br />Update: Added a pattern to the cape.\r<br />\r<br />Credits: Bethesda for creating Skyrim\r<br />             [b]Antioch08[/b] and their team for creating the wonderful Undeath mod to begin with",
