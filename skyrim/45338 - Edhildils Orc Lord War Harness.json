  "descriptionHtml": "Edhildils Orc Lord War Harness\r\nAuthor: Edhildil\r\n10,23,2013\r\nver1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/1236/descriptionn.png[/img]\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I made this armor the way I wanted to, to my specifications, That is why it has my name in the title. \r\nIt is MY mod. please respect that.\r\n\r\nIf it is to skimpy or not lore friendly, or not good enough for you, simply skip this mod. \r\n\r\nIf you are going to leave a comment please be intelligent about it. \r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble with this mod please leave enough details so I can understand what is going on. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a craftable armor set for both male and female characters under the Iron catagory. There are three pieces, Armor, \r\n\r\nboots, and gloves. The female version is weighted for BBP (sevenbase). I mainly focused on the male armor but decided to make \r\n\r\na female version. Right now sevenbase is the only body type I have made due to time. I may do other female bodies later. \r\n\r\nIf any modders out there want to convert to CBBE, UNP, UNPB, ADEC, or any other body type, go for it. If you do make a \r\n\r\nreplacer for the female armor please send me a link so I can post it here. Also make it dependant on this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4153/requir.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter males - Beautiful nudes and faces - New hairstyles by Chris57 and FavoredSoul\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488\r\n\r\nSeveNBase a custom FemaleBodyReplacer by Crosscrusade DeMoNhUnTeR1986 Sevennity\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36992\r\n\r\nCHSBHC - BBP - Nude and Jiggly Mod by CherryHotaling ( BBP animations and skeletons)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4888\r\n\r\nI had the best results by manually installing these animations and skeletons, NMM freaks out alot.\r\n\r\n \r\n[img]http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/2482/installa.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nUnzip Data file to a temporary location. \r\n\r\ncopy/paste into Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/9233/uninstall.png[/img]\r\n\r\nDelete the EdhildilsOrcLordWarHarness.esp file. \r\nDelete meshes/armor/edhildil/orclord folder \r\nDelete textures/armor/edhildil/orclord folder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/8579/creditslo.png[/img]\r\n\r\nChris57 and FavoredSoul (Better Males)\r\nCrosscrusade DeMoNhUnTeR1986 Sevennity (sevenbase) \r\nCherryHotaling (BBP)\r\nEdhildil (these new meshes and textures)\r\nBethesda (original meshes)\r\n\r\nTools used:\r\n=======\r\nBlender\r\nNifscope\r\nGIMP 2\r\n\r\nTes5edit\r\n\r\nThanks to all above and to Skyrim Nexus.\r\nSpecial thanks to my teachers, Apachii, A_TyPE 2 aka Speedbuster, Growlf, Robert, Coronerra, and others.\r\nA shout out to 2pac4eva7, Acdale, Midas, and to my friends on nexus, my fans, and everyone who loves modding.
