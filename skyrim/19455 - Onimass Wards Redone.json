  "descriptionHtml": "Ok so after making and posting a request mod:\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19326\r\n\r\nI was given a idea. \r\n\r\nRedo the wards. The wards are not as done as other spells. There are only actualy 3 ward spells.\r\nLesser Ward(Novice), Stead feast Ward(Apprentice), and Greater Ward(Adept).\r\n\r\nSo I started from there and redid the wards. There are know 5 wards in the game.\r\n\r\nNovice Ward, Apprentice Ward, Adept Ward, Expert Ward, Master\\'s Ward\r\n\r\nAs the wards use a constant drain of your magicka I went through and reduced the cost per second of each of the vanilla wards. To Make up for the reduced cost I added a .5 cast time to each of the wards. \r\n\r\nI also redid the Ward Absorb Perk....as in its know gone and replaced by...\r\n\r\nNovice Ward Absorb, Apprentice Ward Absorb, Adept Ward Absorb, Expert Ward Absorb, and Master Ward Absorb.\r\n\r\nyes i knew seems dumb to do it like that but I have a plan.\r\n\r\nYou see the original Ward Absorb perk wasn\\'t all that powerful. And while the the new perks are 6-23 times stronger(perk depending) it still doesn\\'t make you god like. That is to say its still balanced. When I tested this I had myself Against 15 casters and even with the Master Ward Absorb Perk. I wasn\\'t able to keep it up for ever.\r\n\r\nSo Balance is still there. I will admit its not the balance bethesda thought they had. But its still a balance that doesn\\'t equal god hood.  \r\n \r\n\r\nThe new wards can be obtained by the console or for anyone wanting more of a challenge they can be gained expert level from any vendor who sells restoration tomes.\r\n\r\nThe Master tome cannot be obtained unless you do 1 of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Cheat useing the console type in help \\\"Master Ward\\\" 4\r\n2. Become Arch-Mage and do the quest \\\"Restoration Ritual Spell\\\"\r\nGiven by Colette Marence In the college after you have become Arch-mage and Stoped Arcano.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\nWhen I used this mod I had Phendrix\\'s Magic Evolved active as well and as that was the only magic based mob besides my own Flesh Spells Mod. I noticed no compatibility issues with it or the altered perk tree\\'s in his mod.\r\n\r\nInstallation. \r\nIf your using the mod manager then you know what to do.\r\n\r\nIf your going the manual Route then download and extract to a different folder and copy and past into your C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data folder.\r\n\r\nRemember to make sure its enabled.",
