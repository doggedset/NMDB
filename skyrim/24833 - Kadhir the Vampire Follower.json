To recruit him, you\\'ll have to get his respect and finish the Touching the Sky quest - this is one of the main quest in the Dawnguard extension, I won\\'t spoil it.\r\nKadhir has some unique features: he can use his bat spell to teleport behind his enemy, then hit him; he can also use his Berserk ability.\r\nHOWEVER. He can do this only if he\\'s not starving. You\\'ll see that he\\'s starving if he has red eyes. Give him a Blood Potion and he will drink it. He will automatically use blood potions if they are in his inventory. If his eyes are blue, everything is alright. He will also put a hood during daytime, in exterior, to protect himself from the sun, like Serana. You can also marry him.\r\nEnjoy!\r\n[b]Install[/b]: put the files and the ESP files in your DATA folder and check this using your favorite Mod Manager.\r\n[b]Recommended mods[/b]:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24666]Hoth[/url] - A very well done follower.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url] - Enhance your follower experience!\r\n\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/24833-1-1349034404.jpg[/img]",
