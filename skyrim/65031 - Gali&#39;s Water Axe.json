  "descriptionHtml": "So i read on the stupid steamworkshop there&#39;s a thing where modders can upload their mod and tell users to pay.  WHAT IS THIS STUPIDITY&#33;?&#33;  I am so disappointed.  So i&#39;m deciding to not to upload stuff on the steamworkshop.  Hopefully nexus mod can save my ass.  \r<br />\r<br />Anyway i present to you gali&#39;s water axe from BIONICLE.  I&#39;m going to make more as well.  Once again i never made the model, Aresnir (the creator of the legend of the toa mod) gave me bionicle models, which means i will do more bionicle weapons and maybe masks in the future.\r<br />\r<br />Credits goes to: Aresnir for giving me the water axe model and me for modifying it and waste 30 minutes on the stupid normal texture.\r<br />\r<br />The axes can be found at the skyforge.\r<br />\r<br />Also if you want to you can check out the legend of the toa mod http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41838/?",
