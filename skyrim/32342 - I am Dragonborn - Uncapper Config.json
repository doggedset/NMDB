If you have (Skyrim -Community- Uncapper by Elys) already. Backup your \r\n/Data/SKSE/Plugins/SKSE_Elys_Uncapper.ini.\r\n\r\n1b. Install - (Skyrim -Community- Uncapper by Elys)\r\n\r\n2. Drop the Data Folder in the .rar into your Skyrim folder and click accept.\r\n\r\n3. Play Skyrim\r\n--------------------------------\r\nUninstall\r\nUninstall (Skyrim -Community- Uncapper by Elys) or replace SKSE_Elys_Uncapper.ini with backup.\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nAbout the config.\r\nI have created and recreated characters alot trying to work out a config that feels fair and mostly realistic to some degree. Keep in mind. I play on Master Difficulty.\r\n\r\n*All skills goto 1000 but when they stop gaining strength turn red (as if being debuffed) and stay the last number they geined strength in. This is due to going beyond the cap you wont improve in that field anymore but you will gain exp from it. \r\nCrafting for example will also go to 1000 but the effects of said crafting skills end at 150 for Smithing/Alchemy and 200 for Enchanting. Enchating charges will increse to 1000 but not magnitude. I figured this is fair because dont tell me that Dragonbone armor cant even slightly be improved when my Iron Armor can be 4x stronger than base.\r\n\r\n*All combat skills as you know give you Exp. I have increades the experience rate for leveling skills slightly every 5 levels (Per Skill - getting to 31 destruction wont increase exp gain for your 20 alchemy) \r\n\r\n*All combat skills increase in power even after Skill 100, all the way to 750. I wanted you to keep getting stronger slowly but surely. At 750+ most combat skills start feeling OP. I figure 750 + Potions will make you a god. I want there to be a reason you may want todo alchemy later.\r\n[color=yellow]*** I highly suggest the \\'Magic Skill Scaling\\' mod on steam as it scales power of magic spells in the same way melee/archery is already scaled ***[/color]\r\n\r\nskill leveling speed = (not all speed increases shown)\r\nAlso keep in mind the game makes the speeds slower and slower this only counters that alittle)\r\n\r\nCombat Skill Speed - \r\n20= 1.4x faster\r\n50= 2x faster\r\n100= 3x faster\r\n140= 4x faster\r\n200= 6.5x faster\r\n\r\nMagic Skills Speed\r\n20= 1.9x faster\r\n60= 3.1x faster\r\n90= 4x faster\r\n150= 6.6x faster\r\n200= 9.6x faster\r\n\r\nCrafting Skills Speed\r\n20=2.6x faster\r\n60=4.2x faster\r\n100=6x faster\r\n120=7x faster\r\n250=cap 15x faster\r\nCrafting Skills will only award 1.5x exp at 251+ but will retain the 15x speed.\r\nI wanted to not make crafting useless todo after 151 but I did want there to be some reward alittle extra exp never hurt.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]LEVELING SPEED IS CALCULATED[/color] \r\nEXP for LEVELING SKILLS (not every figure 0.1x awarded every 5levels) \r\nso assuming all skills are at 100 you should be leveling at 3x speed.\r\n15=   1.4x\r\n45=   2x\r\n100=  3x\r\n200=  4x\r\ncapped at 250= 5x\r\n300 = 4x \r\n500 = 2x\r\n800 = .1x\r\n\r\nAs you can see I made it so you become stronger for becomming stronger... untill you reach what I would consider peak.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nPerks\r\n\r\nI will have two available versions of this mod the first is meant for Vanilla Players. The second version is meant for use when playing with. Skyrim Perk Enhancements and Rebalanced Gameplay +  Deadly Dragons + SkyUI\r\n\r\nVanilla Version - 3 perks per 4 levels\r\n\r\nMod + Version - \r\n[color=yellow]Deadly Dragons - you can redeem dragon souls for perks if SkyUI is installed.\r\nPerk Enhancements - auto assign some perks for leveling in said perk.\r\nAlso with this mod you do level alittle faster.[/color]\r\n\r\nHere is the breakdown \r\n10=10\r\n30=21\r\n50=28\r\n100=40\r\n150=53\r\n200=66\r\n250=80 \r\n1 perk per 5 levels after 250. \r\n\r\nDont worry.. with Mods the perks will equal out.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nStats at Level Up\r\n\r\nHealth = 10pts HP, 5 carryweight      /LVL 150+  5HP, 2carryweight     /LVL200+  5HP\r\nMagica = 10pts MP, 2 carryweight     /LVL 150+  5MP, 1carryweight     /LVL200+ 5MP\r\nStamina = 10pts SP, 10 carryweight    /LVL 150+  5SP, 5carryweight     /LVL200+ 5SP 1carryweight",
