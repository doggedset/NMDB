  "summary": "Changes Fastred to have red hair, and puts her in the PotentialMarriage Faction.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Fastred should have red hair unless her name is Fastbrown, which its not, so I decided to change it.  I made her marriageable, but not a follower, there\\'s enough followers, including mine.  I also set her to Essential, the reason is further down.\r\n\r\nSPOILER IF YOU\\'VE NOT DONE THE BOOK OF LOVE QUEST:\r\n\r\nWhen I last did the book of love quest, I had her marry Klimmek, I went back afterward to check, and she was still working in the garden.  When I talked to her she commented on the Amulet of Mara, and I had the options to lead to marriage.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  Uploaded a different version, gave her darker red hair, I just didn\\'t like the orange looking hair, a different Apachii hairstyle, and added freckles.  Any freckles complexion should work, the one in the picture is Cute Freckles by Zhoken, here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/515\r\n\r\nAlso, I checked after talking to Bassianus instead of Klimmek, and she was in Riften with Bassianus.  When I talked to her I got the option to ask her to marry me with Bassianus sitting in the background, guess she\\'s still kind of fickle.\r\n\r\nNot sure how it would work with Bassianus, but I\\'ll test it when I get the chance.  I think you\\'d still get the option to marry her, but if you don\\'t like her spouse hanging around Riften, I read here http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Fastred that if you kill Bassianus in Riften, and the guards attack you, she will defend you and die, that\\'s why I made her essential.  If you sheath your weapon, and pay any bounty, that should be the end of it, but like I said I\\'ve not tested it.\r\n\r\nTo look like she does in the pictures:\r\nDIMONIZED UNP female body UNP Base Main body V1dot2 by dimon99 here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709\r\nBetter Females version 3 Makeup Version 3 and No Shine by BellaGail here \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\nNatural Eyes with Elves Alternative Eyes by nevenbridge here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589\r\nHer clothes are default, but if you want her look like the pictures use UNP - Ultra Skimpy Armor by \r\n\r\nNightasy here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9546\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t use any color extenders, I simply made a hair color in her esp.\r\n\r\nInstallation is easiest with NMM\r\nOr if you want to install manually extract someplace, click on CGTammy, copy the data folder, and paste it \r\n\r\nin your Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\nUninstall with NMM if you used NMM to install\r\nOr if installed manually:\r\nDelete:\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\CGFastred.esp\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Meshes\\\\Actor\\\\Character\\\\facegendata\\\\facegeom\\\\Skyrim.esm\\\\000136BF.NIF\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Actor\\\\Character\\\\facegendata\\\\facetint\\\\Skyrim.esm\\\\000136BF.dds and 000136BF.tga\r\n\r\nAny requests for changes I\\'ll try to accommodate, but changing faces\\\\editing NPCs in the CK is tricky, and \r\n\r\ncan corrupt the file to point its unusable.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\ndimon99 for the best body\r\nBellaGail for her face textures\r\nnevenbridge for the great eyes\r\nNightasy for the great meshes on gear and his tutorials for making gear.\r\nApachii for the awesome hairs.",
