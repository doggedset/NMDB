  "descriptionHtml": "This mod alters the titles of the vanilla books to allow for easier sorting. It pairs very nicely with my Breezehome Library mod (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9563) and will hopefully make book collecting a little easier for my fellow Tamrielic bibliosophs. \r\n\r\nThere are two esp files:\r\n\r\nBookSortingTitles.esp - This file will remove beginning definite and indefinite articles from the titles of all vanilla books. This means that \\\"A Game at Dinner\\\" becomes \\\"Game at Dinner\\\", and that \\\"The Lusty Argonian Maid\\\" becomes \\\"Lusty Argonian Maid\\\".\r\n\r\nBookSortingUnpubs.esp - This file will add a * character to the beginning of any vanilla book that is unpublished, generally defined as one that uses the handwritten font. This allows for easier sorting of unpublished books, such as journals and diaries.\r\n\r\nThe esp files may be used together or you may choose only one, your preference. If installed via Nexus Mod Manager it will ask you to choose one or both. \r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n----------\r\n1a - Added a few journals that I missed in the initial release",
