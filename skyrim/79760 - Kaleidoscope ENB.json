  "descriptionHtml": "[b]\r<br />OVERVIEW\r<br />\r<br />This is a tweaked version of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50065/?]NLA 1.4[/url] by Confidence Man, and all credit goes to that cool guy. \r<br />\r<br />Like many, I am a ride or die homie for Natural Lighting and Atmospherics. The only problem is I also enjoyed the glory of the cold and gritty vanilla lighting, as well as the effects that helped hide the ugly distant vanilla landscape. After hours of tweaking and testing I decided that this was a good balance of the two things I liked. Changes go as follows:\r<br />\r<br />-Heavier Distant Mist\r<br />-Slightly Brighter Nights & Dungeons\r<br />-Revamped Days & Nights\r<br />-Brighter Sun\r<br />-Bluer Clear Skies\r<br />-Darker Storms\r<br />-New Water & Underwater Effects ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1111/?]Pure Waters[/url] Recommended)\r<br />\r<br />Besides the noticeable changes, this also adds a slight letterbox effect as well as lens effects to help the ENB look a little bit more cinematic. These effects, however, can easily be disabled.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://enbseries.enbdev.com/]enbdev[/url]\r<br />[/b][url=http://www.dev-c.com/skyrim/enbhelper/]enbhelper[/url]\r<br />\r<br />(I am using WinRAR)\r<br />\r<br />1.Extract all of the files to your desktop\r<br />2.Take the d3d9.dll and enbhost from the Wrapper Version and place it in your Skyrim Directory Folder.\r<br />3.Right click the Data folder in the Kaleidoscope ENB folder, and select  &#34;Add to Archive&#34; and name it &#34;Kaleidoscope&#34;, then drag it to your desktop.\r<br />4.Using Nexus Mod Manager, manually install the filed you named &#34;Kaleidoscope&#34; and activate it.\r<br />5.Copy and paste all the files from the ENB folder into your Skyrim Directory.\r<br />6.Place enbhelper in the enbseries folder.\r<br />7.Enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />the README is a little bit more in depth if you are confused.
