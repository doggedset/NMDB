  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds over a dozen heroes and villains from the He-Man and She-Ra cartoons. These characters are integrated into the world, and found in a variety of locations listed below. These characters are all owned by the original creators and/or Mattel, my interpretations of them may be different than someone else\\\\\\'s. They are simply based on those characters, not necessarily them.\r\n\r\n*The style of characters/faces that I enjoy is certainly not the same preference as everyone, you must decide what types of face mods you want to use.\r\n\r\n*Any derogatory/abusive or \\\"out of line\\\" comments will be reported. Please be constructive in comments.\r\n\r\n*I am open to suggestions/requests for new characters to be added... ask and you shall receive as I am always open to new character ideas.\r\n\r\n*These characters are my interpretation of the originals... if you don\\'t like them then move on.\r\n\r\n*My Skeletor doesn\\'t look like him (He is a WIP right now)... there are other skeletor followers on the nexus which are better http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30324\r\n\r\n*I only made this mod as a request, it contains only named companions (no armors or weapons) do not ask for these as I do not make armors or weapons.
