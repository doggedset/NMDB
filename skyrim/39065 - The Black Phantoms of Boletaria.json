  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Impact][size=5][color=red]Announcement[/color][/size][/font]\r\n[font=Verdana][size=3][color=yellow]I\\'ve decided that, since this mod is based on the [i]Souls[/i] series, its effects ought to be noticeable and unforgiving, so further updates will continue on the \\\"higher spawn rate\\\" version.[/color][/size][/font]\r\n\r\n[font=Impact][size=5][color=red]Description[/color][/size][/font]\r\n[font=Verdana][size=3][color=yellow]The return of the dragons and the civil war has once again awoken the Old One. As chaos and hopelessness spreads, only a hero can control the ever-growing population of demons.\r\n\r\n[i]\\\"It is said that the dawn of dragons and war has re-awakened the Old One, a being far more dangerous than the pitiful Daedric Lords. Who knows what the Old One really is, but it is said that it devours souls during times of great strife and chaos, which augment the power of evil. As chaos and hopelessness increase, so does evil and, as a result, the presence of Demons. You can recognize them by the slight red aura they emit. Demons are beings of this realm that have realized the power of souls, and embrace it. Anything, from a Giant to a Skeever, can be seduced by souls. Thus, they seek souls and feed the Old One. I suppose that feeding on the souls of the lost is something shared between both the Old One and Alduin.\\\"[/i][/color][/font][/size]\r\n\r\n[font=Impact][size=5][color=red]Gameplay Effects[/color][/size][/font]\r\n[font=Verdana][size=3][color=yellow]Powerful Black Phantoms (Demons) will appear in your world randomly. They have increased Health, Stamina and Magicka, and have higher defense and damage output. They also have powerful loot left in their remains after death. They can also drop powerful items, namely Lesser Demon\\'s Soul Remains and Great Demon\\'s Soul Remains. They can be identified by a red aura and can be found in the form of any enemy in Skyrim. The higher the chaos and hopelessness in your world, measured by your bounty, the more likely you will encounter a black phantom and the more it they will be. You can also encounter a new mage in the Arcanaeum, Sage Freke, who can provide you with new spells if you have sufficient Demon\\'s Soul Remains for his research.[/color][/font][/size]\r\n\r\n[font=Impact][size=5][color=red]Incompatibilities[/color][/size][/font]\r\n[font=Verdana][size=3][color=yellow]I have not edited anything that is considered Vanilla, but have only added new items, spells, etc. Thus, there should be very few conflicts and incompatibilities.[/color][/font][/size]\r\n\r\n[font=Impact][size=5][color=red]Requirements[/color][/size][/font]\r\n[font=Verdana][size=3][color=yellow]This mod only requires the latest Skyrim Patch 1.9.32.0, as of July 29, 2013.[/color][/size][/font]\r\n\r\n[font=Impact][size=5][color=red]Installation[/color][/size][/font]\r\n[font=Verdana][size=3][color=yellow]This mod is NMM compatible.
