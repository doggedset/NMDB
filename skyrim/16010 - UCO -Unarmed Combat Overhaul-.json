  "descriptionHtml": "This mod aims to enhance Unarmed combat in Skyrim. As of yet, all it does is add a new perk tree in the One-handed category which pertains to unarmed fighting.\r\n\r\nREQUIRED as of v1.1: Scriptdragon\r\nLink: http://alexander.sannybuilder.com/?altname=skyrim_script_dragon\r\n\r\nChangelist:\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n*Makes Unarmed attacks increase One-handed skill.\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n*Added Brawler perk.\r\n*Added Intensive Training perk.\r\n*Added Flurry of Blows perk.\r\n*Added Varied Styles perk.\r\n*Added Fists of Power perk.\r\n*Added Stunning Blows perk.\r\n*Added Touch of Death perk.\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\nShould be compatible with everything, as it only adds new stuff, it doesn\\'t modify any Vanilla files. Unless a mod adds something with the exact same FormID as something from this mod, I see no issues here.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nJust extract the contents of the .rar into your Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Skyrim folder, then next time you launch the game, click \\\"data files\\\" and check UCO.esp. Then enjoy!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlthough this isn\\'t my first mod, I\\'m still a beginner, so help me out by telling me about any problems/bugs you experience, and feel free to suggest what you\\'d like in the next update. Also, as of now I know of no way to add an entirely new skill, so the perks are just added to One-handed right now. IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO ADD A NEW SKILL ENTIRELY, TELL ME PLEASE. I\\'D BE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL. Also, anyone can use this mod\\'s resources as long as they credit the author (me!) and link where they got it from. The script I am using is pretty much directly based from Eldiran\\'s Unarmed Combat mod script (although I changed a few things here and there), go check his mod out: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4822 ",
