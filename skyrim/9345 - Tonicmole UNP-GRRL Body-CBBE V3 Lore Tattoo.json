  "descriptionHtml": "TONICMOLE\\'S CBBE and UNP LORE TATTOO SET:\r\n\r\nCBBE and UNP Lore tattoo\\'s.  UPDATE: Now an alternate CBBE Tattoo set by request.\r\n\r\nWill work on GRRL Body, CBBE V3, CHSBHC, and UNP bodies.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  If you are using my \\\"GRRL Body\\\" you need only Download the CBBE Tattoo you want and install it.  GRRL Body comes preinstalled with Navetsea\\'s textures. \r\n\r\nGRRL Body is found here:  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12707\r\n\r\nTo use this bugger on other CBBE or UNP based bodies you\\'ll need to already have \\\"CBBE skin texture V2 V3 plus Thepal and UNP compatible\\\" by navetsea installed.  This is because all I did was add tattoo\\'s.  navetsea is and forever will be the king of texturing.  So if you don\\'t already have it trot your fancy ass over to navetsea\\'s page and DL the crap outta that thing!  It\\'s right cheer: \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6554\r\n\r\nUNP Tattoo detail:  The left arm on UNP is merely an image from one of my own paintings.....that\\'s that.  For CBBE I changed it to the words \\\"The Dragon Born, messiah voice\\\" The Right is a semi tribal design with an Alien face that says \\\"The Old Ones\\\" in Daedric script.  The back also has names written in Daedric script, that admittedly only makes since to me, but few people read Daedric just pretend it\\'s nothing but a design!  Or crack the code and say, Huh!?!    \r\n\r\nNow, if your kinda not wanting every dip shit and dandy in Skyrim to look like a bunch of ass twinky\\'s then you\\'ll probably wanna DL \\\"Custom Races - WIP\\\" by d_rail.  READ the instructions very carefully.  It\\'s not as scary as it seems and will open up a whole wonderful world of not looking like everyone else.  d_rails got it all laid out for ya over there, so don\\'t fear cause d_rail is here. \r\n\r\nINSTALL:  If you use d_rails Custom Race mod, you\\'ll wanna drop my femalebody_1 into Skyrim/Data/textures/CustomRaces/ and then the file of what ever race you is. BOO YA!  TATTOO\\'D IS YOU!  Other wise you drop it into Skyrim/data/textures/actors/character/female.  Though depending on your race and other mods, things could be different......thats for god to sort out.  \r\n\r\nWith the CBBE all you need to do is drop the \\\"mesh\\\" folder into the data folder and over write it, unless your using \\\"Custom Race\\\" then see above.  I should have done this in the first place.  \r\n\r\nThanks:  d_rail for rock\\'n and sock\\'n that Custom Race business, navetsea for staying in the lines and throw\\'n down those old school texture skills, Caliente for bust\\'n out the double D\\'s with her CBBE\\'s, and the man with the plan, the dude with the nack for make\\'n ladies with no lack of back, dimon99!",
