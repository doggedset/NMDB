It's my very first mod so... be gentle ^_^\r\n\r\n The mod he had released was to replace the running, but, in my opinion, I think it looks best instead of the walking. To be honest, the walking is very relaxing and smooth... but when you're in a game, it gets kinda boring having always to walk when you're going down hill! So... why not trotting? I made it to slightly increase the speed of the \"Walk\" and now he only trots.\r\n I have a horse in real life, I also want to thank him for the inspiration of this project! Because yesterday we were taking a ride and we were going down hill and he got startled by a fox so he started trotting instead of galloping (because it's very dangerous on going down hill to go gallop). \r\n\r\n So the real reason why I made this mod is for those rushy players, like myself, who ride horses not always to take a stroll, but to get somewhere! But unfortunately I couldn't speed up the pace a lot or else it would do the same as it does when you run: you fly away. This mod only speeds up the exact amount necessary so you can go faster but slow enough so you won't spring off away of that road/hill/whatsoever! My point is... you can't really ask me to speed up the pace, I know it's not the same as the trotting pace in the game, but it's the same as speeding up the horse, if you do it, even walking, you will run off that hill anyway and we don't want that! :)\r\n\r\n[color=\"#FF0000\"] **WARNING**[/color][color=\"#FFFF00\"] THIS IS A MOD REPLACER OF THE WALKING ANIMATION OF HORSES! \r\n [/color]\r\n[color=\"#FF0000\"] ** ATTENTION** [/color][color=\"#FFFF00\"]THIS ANIMATION WASN'T ENTIRELY MADE BY ME, THIS IS A SIMPLE VANILLA BETHESDA FILE TURNED INTO AN ANIMATION REPLACER.
