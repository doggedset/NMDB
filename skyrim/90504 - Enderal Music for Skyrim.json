  "descriptionHtml": "SSE Link: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16243]Enderal Music for Skyrim Special Edition[/url]\n<br />\n<br />(NOTE: Please read the entire description thoroughly) When I first played SureAI's amazing game/mod, Enderal, I automatically wanted to look for a mod that adds its beautiful soundtrack to the base game, but nobody had done it! Yesterday, I just taught myself how to make music mods with the help of another mod called \"Personalized Music\" (link will be included later in the description, under REQUIREMENTS), so I took it upon myself to ask SureAI themselves if I could make a mod that adds the Enderal soundtrack to Skyrim, and they responded with \"Sure, go for it :)\", so I made it in a few hours with a .bsa unpacking program and a .xwm file converter. (Links will be with the credits.)\n<br />\n<br />-Soundtrack Description-\n<br />Enderal has a BEAUTIFUL and emotional soundtrack. The songs cover a wide variety of moods and settings. Some songs are upbeat and cheery while others are downright depressing. Those of you who have played Enderal know some of the songs I refer to when I say \"depressing.\" \n<br />\n<br />-Disclaimers-\n<br />-Because of the differences between Skyrim and Enderal, some songs (like character songs) are incorporated in different scenarios that I thought were appropriate for the tone of the song (for example, Calia's song for her dialogue plays during nighttime exploration, the song at the end of the game before you make your final decision plays in the Soul Cairn, and the piano version of Fleshless that plays in the Aged Man's abode plays in Castle Volkihar.)\n<br />-Another disclaimer, I did not add EVERY song from the soundtrack. I have added approximately 85% of the songs because some are just sound effects for discovering places, death, etcetera.\n<br />-PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS YOU ENCOUNTER\n<br />\n<br />-REQUIREMENTS-\n<br />-(Soft requirement) You need the Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLCs (if you do not have them, DO NOT INSTALL THE FILES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM!!!)\n<br />-(Hard requirement) Personalized Music- [u]You NEED this mod for mine to work!!![/u] Without it, you'll not even have a place to install these files. It can be found here: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13286]Personalized Music[/url]\n<br />-You are NOT required to have downloaded Enderal to use this mod!!!\n<br />\n<br />-INSTALLATION-\n<br />VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ THIS!!\n<br />If you want this mod to work as a replacer for the vanilla music, download the replacer version of Personalized music. If you want it as an add-on, then download the version that lets you keep the vanilla music.\n<br />There is no option to download with NMM! Follow the instructions from the video below, or check the video tab on this mod page.\n<br />[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enqKQW4WXNk&amp;feature=youtu.be]Tutorial[/url]\n<br />\n<br />-Credits-\n<br />-The SureAi team for making Enderal and for letting me use their music- [url=https://sureai.net/]SureAI's Website[/url]\n<br />-Those who composed this lovely soundtrack- \"The Enderal's original soundtrack was mostlty composed by Marvin Kopp, Simon W.
