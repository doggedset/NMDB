  "descriptionHtml": "Mjoll changed to look like Hroki (Mjoll as Hroki\\'s Twin)\r\nBy: MrPingy\r\n\r\n(Mod no longer under development, I\\'ve moved on to other things and no longer monitor comments)\r\n\r\nLemme just start out by saying this is my first mod ever so go easy on me.  I made it for personal use and thought \\\"what the heck\\\" and uploaded it.\r\n\r\nThis mod blends Mjoll\\'s cool story and character depth with Hroki\\'s smoking hot looks for a good companion and/or wife.  I put Hroki\\'s head model on Mjoll\\'s body.  Then I darkened up the face and added some eye shadow and lip coloring to suit my personal tastes.  \r\n\r\nI didn\\'t want to buff the character, but having higher one handed skill than two handed matched Mjoll\\'s story of Grimsever better (I thought anyway) so I simply swapped the values.  No other stats changes were made to keep the character balanced with the world.  I made two versions, one with the scar retained since she did get messed up in the dwarven ruin and I thought it was more lore-friendly.  I also made a version without a scar if you\\'d rather have that as well.\r\n\r\n(I also released a mod since this one that stops Aerin from stalking. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11899)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nVersion Change Log\r\n\r\nv 0.8 Alpha (Prototype version)\r\n- Increases reset time for most Idle dialog from 0.5 to 10 hours.\r\n- Increases reset time for most used idle dialog from 0.5 to 15 hours.\r\n- Untested Alpha version, please provide bug reports if you use it.\r\n\r\nv 0.7 Beta (Current version)\r\n- Eye color adjusted from ice blue to light blue.\r\n\r\nv 0.6 Beta\r\n- Default Outfit Set to \\\"MerchantClothesOutfit02NoHat\\\" (Blue Merchant Clothes).\r\n- Iron Cuirass, Gauntless, and Boots added to inventory as removable items.\r\n- Enchanted Steel Dagger added.\r\n- Modified version of Hroki\\'s head utilized without warpaint or scar.\r\n- Random battleaxe and loot removed from inventory.\r\n- Two Handed changed from \\\"44\\\" to \\\"27\\\"\r\n- one handed changed from \\\"27\\\" to \\\"44\\\"\r\n- Mjoll\\'s stance changed to feminine.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\n- Unzip contents to your Skyrim directory. (exactly where your directory is may differ)\r\nD:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nEnable mjoll-hrokis-twin-(version)-pingy.esp in Skyrim launcher or mod manager or whatever.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUninstallation\r\n\r\n- delete these files. (exactly where your directory is may differ)\r\nD:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\facegendata\\\\facetint\\\\skyrim.esm\\\\0001336b.dds\r\nD:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\facegendata\\\\facegeom\\\\skyrim.esm\\\\0001336b.nif\r\nD:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\mjoll-hrokis-twin-(version)-pingy.esp\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n(semi)Important Information\r\n\r\n- Scar retained in this version to fit with her story of being found all messed up by some dwarven ruins.\r\n- Since Mjoll\\'s favorite weapon is one handed it would make sense she would be better with it.  Instead of buffing anything I simply swapped the stats for one and two handed weapons.\r\n- Since she lost her sword all she has still is her steel dagger and armor she was carrying.  That\\'s why battleaxe was removed.\r\n- Mjoll will now wear Blue Merchant Outfit as default when not following you, even if she has better armor in inventory.  \r\n- Her Iron armor is now removeable so you don\\'t have to worry about other armor you want to give her having to be an \\\"upgrade\\\".\r\n- When you \\\"recruit\\\" her you may need to access her inventory and \\\"adjust\\\" things to get her to wear a piece of armor.  Fast traveling or going into a new area should work too.\r\n- To get her to use new default clothing in saved games open the console by pressing tilde \\\"~\\\", left click on her with the mouse, type \\\"resurrect\\\" without quotes and hit enter.\r\n- In theory new games should work fine, but I haven\\'t tried them.\r\n- I made this for myself and decided to release it as an afterthought, so there may be problems.  It is \\\"Beta\\\" for a reason.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nConflicts\r\n\r\n- Will most likely conflict with any mods changing Mjoll\\'s looks or stats in any way.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n\r\n- Bethesda for the vanilla game content used.\r\n- foretrenty for \\\"Skyrim NPC Editor\\\" \\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4554\\\" which was used to create this mod.\r\n- dimon99 for \\\"DIMONIZED UNP female body\\\" \\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6709\\\" (adult file) whose body texture is featured in Screenshots.\r\n- exeter for \\\"UNP Female Armors WIP\\\" \\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7305\\\" whose banded iron armor is featured in Screenshots.\r\n- mrLenski for \\\"Coverwomen\\\" \\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3563\\\" whose \\\"Seamless UNP and Coverwomen Look_3\\\" textures are featured in Screenshots.\r\n- Xenius for \\\"XCE - Xenius Character Enhancement\\\" \\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356\\\" whose eye and scar textures are featured in Screenshots (I think).\r\n- P210 for the idea to reduce Mjoll\\'s idle dialog to make her less annoying.\r\n- Other mod makers whose content is included in screenshots that I may have overlooked.  (I have too many frigging mods installed)\r\n\r\nPlease note that only Bethesda created vanilla content is included in the files for my mod.  The files were created and edited with the Skyrim NPC Editor listed above.\r\n\r\nNo portion of the other mods are included with my mod. I only mention them because they are visible in screenshots in case you want to go get them yourself.  They require separate download and installation from their respective author\\'s web pages.  My mod should work perfectly fine with any combination of texture mods you wish to use.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEverything is free to modify on these conditions: upload at Nexus and give proper credits and link to original mod. No permission required.\r\n(Upload condition as thanks to Nexus for hosting and credit condition because this took WAY more time for me to complete than I would like to admit)",
