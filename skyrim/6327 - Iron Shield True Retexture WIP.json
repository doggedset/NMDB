  "modName": "Iron Shield True Retexture WIP",
  "summary": "I was tired of the low resolution crappy looking shields in the game, and so far all I\\'ve seen for \\\"retextures\\\" were in fact the original textures with details added or even worse, just sharpened and color adjusted and made to look even worse than the vanilla version. This uses new textures but adheres to the vanilla aesthetic.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is very much a work in progress, and I don\\'t even know how to make decent normal maps yet (never textured anything in my life), but it looks a damn sight better than the vanilla iron shield even with the old low resolution normal map over it, which thankfully actually looks just fine because I kept so close to the original design. There are still a few bits that use vanilla texture, but it looks great from the first person view. I plan to add some wear and tear on the inside especially along the edge of the wood to get it looking a little more organic, and will eventually get everything up at a higher resolution. This is a 1024 resolution texture.",
