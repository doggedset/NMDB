  "descriptionHtml": "Thanks for checking out my mod! if you like it please comment and endorse. Thanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n__What is The True Hard North all about? (Aka TTHN)__\r\n\r\n             The goal is to bring Lore-based textures to all armor, from adding more fur to less mythical looking metal to just good old better detail. Along  with other external armors and style recreated to fit into the amazing land of Skyrim.\r\n             Two amazing re-textures of the nightingale Armor is TTHN\\'s kick off armor. Two stand alone armors, one is Lore-friendly; and the other is based from Assassins Creed. Both unique.\r\n \r\n\r\n_Sanguine Armor:_\r\n            -An Ezio style retexure, Unique, is found in the Windhelm Barracks in the prison. \r\n(check Pictures)\r\n\r\n_Northern Sky Armor:_\r\n            -An nordic Nightingale... with the colors of Nocturnal\\'s robe it suits the part much better. it can be found in the Solitude Crypts. (any nightingale cape remover mod should remove the cape if you wish that so, I think it looks sweet myself)\r\n(check Pictures)\r\n\r\nIf you have any Idea\\'s on what Armor should Join TTHN let me know in the comments box!",
