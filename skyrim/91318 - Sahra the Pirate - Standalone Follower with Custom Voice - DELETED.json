  "modName": "Sahra the Pirate - Standalone Follower with Custom Voice - DELETED",
  "summary": "Sahra is a fully standalone custom follower using the SALTY open-source voice set by the awesome Kikiapplus. She comes with location-aware comments, her own follower system, a unique custom outfit, and (for reasons best known to herself) a strong dislike of Jarl Elisif.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[code][/code][code][/code]﻿﻿[b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4]Description[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Sahra is a young pirate lass who has recently had a bit of bad luck. She's got a journal in her inventory if you're curious, but let's just say it involved a one-eyed pirate captain, an iceberg, and lots of rum. After that little fiasco, she is currently chilling (...literally...) at the Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar, desperate to find someone who would help her brave the frozen wilds of Skyrim. If you recruit her, she'll follow you anywhere, probably making some rude comments along the way.\n<br />\n<br />Hey, they don't exactly teach you charm in pirate school.\n<br />[b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]Features[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[list][*]A custom voice set with well over a hundred location-aware comments. Talk to her while in town, out exploring, or relaxing at an inn - she might have something new to say!\n<br />[*]Her own follower system. She ignores your friendly fire and doesn't count against the follower limit, so you can have her tag along with any other followers you might be using. If you tell her to wait, she will stay put indefinitely.\n<br />[*]A custom outfit, based on meshes and textures by zzjay and BBDrac, recoloured by me. All pieces of the outfit can be tempered and enchanted. If you want to change her outfit, use a follower management mod like Amazing Follower Tweaks.\n<br />[*]A pair of scimitars, very slightly better than vanilla. You can temper and enchant them, too.\n<br />[*]A teleport spell to bring her back if she gets lost. To acquire the spell, look for the \"Call Sahra\" spell book in Sahra's inventory.\n<br />[/list][b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3][size=4]Location[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Dawnstar, Windpeak Inn\n<br />[b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]Other notes[/size][/color][/b][size=3]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />Sahra uses the CBBE Curvy body and Fair Skin Complexion textures. Her outfit is technically playable, but will use Sahra's body and textures, so your player character might get a neck seam and/or gap.\n<br />\n<br />Her fighting style is Forsworn Berserker, so she defaults to dual-wielding in combat.\n<br />\n<br />She has the Light Foot a﻿nd Dual Flurry (rank 1) perks.\n<br />\n<br />She levels with the player and has no min or max level limit.\n<br />﻿\n<br />At the moment, her voice set has no marriage-related lines, so she is not marriable. Kikiapplus mentioned possibly making a marriage add-on in the future, though, so hopefully I'll be able to make Sahra a marriage prospect one day!\n<br />[b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3][size=4]Install[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Install with a mod manager.\n<br />\n<br />If you want to install manually, unpack to Data folder as usual.\n<br />[b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]Uninstall[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Uninstall with a mod manager.\n<br />\n<br />If you want to uninstall manually, remove the following files and folders from your Skyrim Data folder:\n<br />\n<br />SahraPirateFollower.esp\n<br />textures&#92;SahraPirateFollower\n<br />meshes&#92;SahraPirateFollower\n<br />meshes&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;FaceGenData&#92;FaceGeom&#92;SahraPirateFollower.esp\n<br />textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;FaceGenData&#92;FaceTint&#92;SahraPirateFollower.esp\n<br />scripts&#92;SahraDialogueQuestScript.pex\n<br />scripts&#92;source&#92;SahraDialogueQuestScript.psc\n<br />scripts&#92;SahraCallScript.pex\n<br />scripts&#92;source&#92;SahraCallScript.psc\n<br />scripts&#92;SahraDialogueQuestAliasScript.pex\n<br />scripts&#92;source&#92;SahraDialogueQuestAliasScript.psc\n<br />Seq&#92;SahraPirateFollower.seq\n<br />[b]\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3][size=4]\n<br />Compatibility notes[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Compatible with Amazing Follower Tweaks and My Home is Your Home.\n<br />\n<br />If you find any incompatibilities, let me know!\n<br />[b]\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]\n<br />History[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />1.0, 2018-05-14 -
