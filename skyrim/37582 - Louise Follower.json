She asked if I knew about children born under omens of the sky to which I nodded as I sat by the fire. She said she was such a child, that when her first cries rose into the cold air of the night that the crimson moon hovered above, such was the omen of her birth. She told of her parents being wandering hunters, so from very young she learned of the hunt and survival in the wilds, she knew the forests well by the time they had taught her all they knew. \r\n\r\n She began to whisper, seeming nervous as she spoke of one night some years ago where something awoke in her, a blood that the omen had predicted. Bones and muscles shifted as she felt her teeth become fangs, watching as her fingers grew into claws sprouting thick fur, she felt wild instincts take hold as a great howl rang out from her mouth. She told me she had remembered little of what had happened, that she saw only a blur of shapes and a splash of crimson, thoughts jumbled, she could clearly remember what had happened when she awoke however. As her eyes fluttered open she saw a canopy of trees, she could smell the acrid smoke of a fire drifting past, eventually she heard steps, as she rolled to her side she saw bandits approaching, their eyes filled with malice as she tried to cover her naked form. Just as they were about to reach her, the one that seemed the leader fell, an arrow piercing his skull as the others scattered. A woman appeared her blades swirling as cries of pain rang out, the bandits quickly falling to her blade. \r\n\r\n That woman had been Aela, a great huntress of the companions, she had helped her up and tossed her some clothes. She offered to help her gain control of the beast within her, to take her in to the companions and train her in the ways of a huntress. Impressed as she had been with Aela\\'s prowess she accepted her offer. As she finished her tale she asked me if I still wanted her following me being a werewolf, I told her that I had seen the kindness in her eyes and actions, that I very much trusted her skill to which she smiled.\\\"\r\n\r\n - the tale of Louise\\'s past as heard by Naelwen, bosmer alchemist and friend.\r\n\r\nThanks to Kamikazekossori for writing such a beautiful backstory for Louise!\r\n\r\n\r\n---DESCRIPTION---\r\n\r\nLouise is my Skyrim character, wich me and M14aria have converted into a standalone follower.\r\nMe and M14aria have been working hard to bring you this cute tomboy girl as a standalone follower for a very long time so please be kind!
