  "summary": "Simplistic edit to give Breezehome an Arcane Enchanter.",
  "descriptionHtml": "As the title suggests, this mod simply edits Breezehome to a much needed extent in my opinion, bringing you an Arcane Enchanter.\r\n\r\n[center][size=3][color=blue]Now, you ask: [i]\\\"Why don\\'t you just sift through all the mods available on the nexus?\\\"[/i][/color][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=green][b][u]Two Reasons:[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n- I know there are a million and a half various Breezehome mods out there but the majority of these \\\"Breezehome\\\" mods which are available for download, edit the interior to such extent, that I quite frankly find it ridiculous. I like to take things into perspective, and know that when I see the house from outside, it\\'s shape will be similar inside. So This is why I am sharing mine.\r\n\r\n- I also did this to gain some experience in the Creation Kit, yes this is my very first mod. I thought that Breezehome lacked an Arcane Enchanter, so why don\\'t I just edit the most useless room in the house - yes, you are correct, Lydia\\'s Room. For those of you who haven\\'t noticed, she has a major obsession of watching the Dragonborn sleep, so I thought I might as well utilize her room because she seems to be enjoying mine... while eating her bread.\r\n\r\n[center][color=orange][size=3]In short, this mod adds:[/size][/color][/center]\r\n- an Arcane Enchanter [mini version]\r\n\r\n- 1 Weapon Plaque\r\n\r\n- 3 Weapon Racks\r\n\r\n- a Strongbox and the famous [i]Catalogue of Weapon Enchantments[/i] which can be found right next to it.\r\n\r\n[center][color=red][size=3][b][u]Note:[/u][/b][/size][/color][/center]\r\nThis will only look 100% fitting if you buy all Breezehome upgrades at once (that\\'s what I usually do). The installation readme is included in the download file. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nI\\'d also like to take some time and thanks [b]Jesus-Kun[/b](He has no relation to [i]Jesus[/i] himself.) for his assistance regarding my [b]first[/b] mod.\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][b]Steam Workshop Link -[/b][/color] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129596527]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129596527[/url]\r\n\r\nI hope you like this, and drop a comment if you have more suggestions. :D\r\nHappy Gaming!\r\n\r\nstiXz.",
