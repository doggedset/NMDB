  "summary": "A small plugin to add several diseases from Morrowind and a few new ones for added challenge.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is the first in a series of mods I plan on adding. This one adds several new diseases to enemies in the game for additional challenge and to put use to those dozens of potions you find lying around in dungeons to cure diseases. Endorse if you like, it helps (and inspires me to do more)! Thanks everyone.\r\n\r\n[b]Note: Sorry for the long delay, I\\'ve begun reworking this mod as of late! Thanks everyone for your patience![/b]\r\n[center]\r\n[img]http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s169/CeciltheKitsune/diseases.png[/img]\r\n[/center]\r\n[B][SIZE=3]Why?[/SIZE][/B]\r\nAll too often I contract a disease from a wolf or skeever and barely notice. It\\'s not much effort to simply ignore the disease until I\\'m back in a town to activate a Shrine. Any other method of curing diseases is nearly useless and the diseases themselves are nonthreatening and pose little to no danger if contracted mid-dungeon. I want to see diseases that actually scare the player enough to come prepared to a dungeon, ready for anything they may encounter.\r\n\r\n[B][SIZE=3]Diseases[/SIZE][/B]\r\nThese diseases can be contracted from a wide variety of in-game monsters: Draugr, Trolls, Giants, Wolves, and even Chaurus. (Many thanks to my girlfriend for all the art for the description).\r\n[IMG]http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s169/CeciltheKitsune/amnesia.png[/IMG]Amnesia - Damage Magicka 100%\r\n[IMG]http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s169/CeciltheKitsune/coldblood.png[/IMG]Cold-Blood Curse - Reduce all magicka levels to 1.\r\n[IMG]http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s169/CeciltheKitsune/corpserot.png[/IMG]Corpse Rot - Damage Health over time.\r\n[IMG]http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s169/CeciltheKitsune/brownrot.png[/IMG]Brown Rot - Reduce Speech and Carry Weight\r\n[IMG]http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s169/CeciltheKitsune/crimsonplague.png[/IMG]Crimson Plague - Damage Stamina 100%\r\n[IMG]http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s169/CeciltheKitsune/rustchance.png[/IMG]Rust Chancre - Reduces movement speed by 25%\r\n[IMG]http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s169/CeciltheKitsune/yellowtick.png[/IMG]Yellow Tick - Reduces Carry Weight, Reduces Speed by 25%\r\n\r\n[B][SIZE=3]To-Do[/SIZE][/B]\r\n[LIST]\r\n[*]Add more diseases\r\n[*]Fix any bugs that may occur, I guess\r\n[/LIST]\r\n\r\n[B][SIZE=3]Change log[/size][/B]\r\n- v 0.1.2\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Removed unused disease\r\n[/list]\r\n- v 0.1.1\r\n[list]\r\n[*]\\\"Ash Woe Blight\\\" to \\\"Cold-Blood Curse\\\"\r\n[*]Corpse Rot hotfix\r\n[/LIST]\r\n- v 0.1 - Initial Release\r\n\r\n",
