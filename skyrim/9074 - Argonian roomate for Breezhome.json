  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE 2/12/12\r\nI fucked with the stats in every possible way, I tried making the character essential, which didn\\'t work, no matter what I change the health to, he always dies in two hits (unless I check the invulnerable check box) in which case he won\\'t lose any health at all. If anyone could help me out it would be appreciated. For now I am releasing two versions the killable (dies in two hits) and non-killable (doesn\\'t die or lose health at all). I also added a few assorted items to his inventory if you feel like pickpocketing him or in the case of the killable version, take it off his dead body. If anyone knows what\\'s going wrong, please tell me. Thanks and have a splendid day!\r\n-Owen (Newoaf)\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************************\r\nThis was my first time using the creation kit and this mod was mainly just a test but I saw no reason not to share it with everyone else. It adds Raúl, an Argonian to Breezhome in Whiterun. He\\'s really strong and will most likely kick your ass in a fight, my intention is to have him be a follower, which hopefully I will be able to do sometime in the future when I am more learned in the ways of modding. Right now he just loafs around the house doing normal NPC stuff, if you attack him he\\'ll fight you, and it takes a lot to bring him down. Anyway, if you want to download it go ahead, or feel free to tell me it\\'s a useless piece of shit, either way, here it is.",
