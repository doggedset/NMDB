  "summary": "This adds a fomod descriptor to the original mod. No internet needed for info anymore.",
  "descriptionHtml": "See the image. DoH.  This just adds a description to the mod that does not use an internet connection. No HTML image links or resources. Just copy the FOMOD folder into the Interesting NPCs mod BEFORE you install it.  \r\n\r\nIf not then you have to uninstall but DONT delete it, move it BACK into the UNASSIGNED category.  Exit NMM and THEN copy over the FOMOD folder into the original mod.  You can TRY to just copy the information into the FOMOD folder but NMM will most likely tell you to uninstall and upgrade.\r\n\r\nI will NOT be updating this. You can easily do that yourself by extracting the INFO.XML file somewhere and editing it SAFELY with Notepad++.   I do NOT recommend using windows notepad.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re looking for other beautiful NPC packages check out NPCs of Dibella.  I have a unique fomod for that one as well.\r\n\r\nRestart NMM and it\\'ll show up.  There\\'s a new \\\"utility\\\" out here that\\'s supposed to be able to \\\"read\\\" the info\\'s from mods now but I\\'m using a windows2k machine now so I cannot test it.",
