  "descriptionHtml": "Significantly increases damage of many traps to make running into them more hazardous to your well-being.\r\n\r\nTraps improved include:\r\nBattering Ram, Bear Trap (includes 50% slow effect, hopefully), Falling Rocks, Mace Trap, Fire Plate, Spike Traps, Swinging Wall Traps, Poison Darts (hopefully), and Swinging Blades\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod and has not been tested as thoroughly as I would have liked, but hopefully works as intended.  Any feedback is appreciated in the comments.\r\nNOTE: I have not tested the results of these traps on various character levels, so please let me know if you feel that these traps deal too much damage at earlier levels (tested at LVL44).",
