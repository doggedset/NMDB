  "descriptionHtml": "I favor Drachis Argonians mod as a texture replacer. However, it doesn&#39;t really support Schlongs of Skyrim, so I wanted to fix that. I changed the schlong textures too, but only for the Average variant.\r<br />\r<br />Note that it doesn&#39;t support Raptor Feet like my other mod does. Because the feet that has toes included in SoS has a different UV-map while Raptor Feet uses vanilla UV&#39;s (I believe). But I might add a patch in the future.\r<br />\r<br />What differs this mod from the original &#34;Drachis Argonians&#34; is that those textures lacked mipmaps so I decided to generate mipmaps in Gimp, but the textures in my mod are also uncompressed.\r<br />\r<br />I disabled comments to be on the safe side. The last thing I want to hear is people complaining about seeing d*cks everywhere on the Nexus.\r<br />\r<br />I would like to thank Drachi for letting users edit his work for compatibility with other mods&#33;",
