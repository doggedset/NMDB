  "summary": "Adds Guan Yu from the Three Kingdoms as a follower at the Dragonbridge town inn.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Guan Yu (Styled Yunchang) has always been my favorite character from the Three Kingdoms novel and it\\'s many game and movie spin-offs. He was the \\\"Second Brother\\\" in a group of heroes that began the Kingdom of Shu in ancient China. He was known for his strength and intelligence, his strict loyalty, honor, and long flowing beard. I was inspired to make him a follower when I saw Bloodysunday\\'s rendition of Lord Guan\\'s legendary Green Dragon blade ( Mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19383 )\r\n\r\nGuan Yu can be recruited from the inn in Dragonbridge. He only carries a steel sword and no armor to start with. He is a 2-Handed fighter and likes heavy armor. He often uses a battle cry (shout) that varies with the version you download (V1.0 uses the \\\"Dismay\\\" shout, but after much playtesting I got tired of chasing down enemies and V1.1 replaces that with the \\\"Marked for Death\\\" shout). He will level with the player character. He does not require any special mods to use, so he should work with whatever mods you like best. He is BIG (Size slightly reduced in V1.1 to better balance things).\r\n\r\n=========\r\nChangelog:\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Take all of his items before changing versions, or you will lose those items!\r\n\r\nV1.1: NEW!!! Size reduced slightly due to height affecting damage output. Shout changed to \\\"Marked for Death\\\". Several 2H weapon perks added (2H axes/polearm axe mods are favored). Light Foot perk added. A few flavor items added to his starting inventory. Hunting bow respawn bug fixed.\r\n\r\nV1.0: VERY large character, uses \\\"Dismay\\\" shout.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\nMods I\\'ve used to achieve the look in the photos:\r\n(Individual mod sites may contain adult content)\r\n\r\nGreen Dragon Crescent Blade by Bloodysunday ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19383 )\r\n\r\nBetter males - Beautiful nudes and faces - New hairstyles by Chris57 and FavoredSoul w/ Gennox Faces: ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488 )\r\n\r\nImmersive Armors by hothtrooper44 ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19733 )\r\n\r\nWinter is Coming (cloaks) by Nivea ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13486 )\r\n\r\nThe Art of Magicka by Zonzai and Kalell  ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1040\r\n\r\nDark Dragon Armor by thewolfpacisback ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20101 )\r\n____________________________________\r\nGraphics (and other) Mods I use and enjoy:\r\nUltimate Follower Overhaul\r\nClimates of Tamriel\r\nSkyrim HD 2k Textures\r\nSkyrim Flora Overhaul\r\nLush Grass\r\nBetter Rocks and Mountains\r\nThe Official HD texture DLC\r\n\r\nAnd too many others to name...\r\n\r\n__________\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nUnzip and place all files inside your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n___________________\r\nOther Mods by Author:\r\n\r\nZhang Fei Follower - The Three Kingdoms ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20732 )\r\n\r\nLu Bu Follower - The Three Kingdoms ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21088 )\r\n___________\r\nFuture Plans:\r\nLu Bu has enough requests that I will probably create him next, and then Zhuge Liang.
