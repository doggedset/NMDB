  "descriptionHtml": "===DESCRIPTION===\r\n\r\nI\\'m rather surprised that no one has yet made a darker retexture of Dawnguard\\'s dragonbone weapons so far. There is a lovely complete retextured set [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25119]based on an ivory-and-copper colour scheme[/url], but I have a preference for darker schemes. I like the default dragonbone design well enough that I decided to not install one of the model replacers out there, and make my own retexture.\r\n\r\nI will eventually retexture the whole set, but given that I created this retexture with my thief character in mind, stealth-based weapons will take priority. Tentatively, the order of retexturing will be as follows:\r\n\r\nDagger -> Bow and Arrows -> One-handed Weapons -> Two-handed Weapons\r\n\r\nTextures are currently at 2048x2048 pixel resolution, and a default (1k) resolution pack will be released once the whole set has been completely retextured.\r\n\r\n\r\n===INSTALLATION===\r\n\r\nExtract the archive into your Skyrim directory. Use of Nexus Mod Manager recommended for easy installation.\r\n\r\n\r\n===UNINSTALLATION===\r\n\r\nDelete the \\\"dragpnbone\\\" folder within the following folder path:\r\n\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\dlc01\\\\weapons\\\\dragonbone\r\n\r\nAgain, I recommend players to use Nexus Mod Manager for easy install/uninstall of this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n===VERSION HISTORY===\r\n\r\n0.2 - Bow and quiver retextured, at high resolution. Slightly smoother normal map for arrowhead.\r\n\r\n0.1 - Dagger retextured, at high resolution.\r\n\r\n===ADDITIONAL NOTES===\r\nThe model player character is wearing the Ranger armor set from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19733]Immersive Armors[/url].\r\n",
