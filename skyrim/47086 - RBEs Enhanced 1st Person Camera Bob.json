  "descriptionHtml": "[heading]RBE's Enhanced 1st Person Camera Bob[/heading]\r\nversion 1.6\r\n[heading]UPDATE![/heading]\r\n[color=yellow]Updated \"Standard\" and \"Heavy\" running and more immersive sprinting\r\nNEW! Light Version: 50% less camera bob than \"Standard\" version (keeps vanilla sprinting)\r\nNEW! Heavy version without FOV change when going into sprinting\r\nFixed sprinting stutter issue[/color]\r\n\r\n[heading]CAUTION--[/heading]\r\nThe Light, Standard and Heavy versions of this mod add increased camera bob (also known as head bobbing) to certain aspects of the game, and may cause nausea or induce an epileptic seizure in certain individuals. Certain conditions may induce previously undetected epileptic symptoms even in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy.\r\n\r\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms while playing the game with this mod -- dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, any involuntary movement, or convulsions -- IMMEDIATELY discontinue use and consult your physician before resuming play.\r\n\r\n[heading]DESCRIPTION--[/heading]\r\nThis mod adds increased camera bob (also known as head bobbing) to the first person view for a more immersive gameplay. Camera bobbing is now visible when running, walking, and sneaking.\r\n\r\nCombat mode notes:\r\n- Unfortunately I haven't been able to figure out how to alter camera bobbing when running with a drawn weapon.\r\n- This also means that there is a slight vertical camera movement when running with a drawn weapon in the \"No Bob\" version. However, it is minor and there is no horizontal sway or rotation in this version, and should therefore be fairly safe to use.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n[heading]VIDEO--[/heading]\r\nVideo by El Sopa\r\n[youtube]ktwEiWAUmHc[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[heading]COMPATIBILITY--[/heading]\r\nThe mod only contains modified animations, there shouldn't be any compatibility issues. Please feed back if you come across any issues.\r\n\r\n[heading]INSTALLATION--[/heading]\r\nInstall with Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n\r\nFor manual installation merge the included Data folder with your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n\r\n[heading]UNINSTALLATION--[/heading]\r\nUninstall with Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n\r\nFor manual uninstallation delete the following files from your\r\nSkyrim | Data | meshes | actors | character | _1stperson | animations\r\nfolder:\r\n\r\nmt_runforwardcamerabob.hkx\r\nmt_sprintforward.hkx\r\nmt_walkforwardcamerabob.hkx\r\nsneakrun_backward.hkx\r\nsneakrun_bckwrdleft.hkx\r\nsneakrun_bckwrdright.hkx\r\nsneakrun_forward.hkx\r\nsneakrun_frwrdleft.hkx\r\nsneakrun_frwrdright.hkx\r\nsneakrun_left.hkx\r\nsneakrun_right.hkx\r\nsneakwalk_bckward.hkx\r\nsneakwalk_bckwrdleft.hkx\r\nsneakwalk_bckwrdright.hkx\r\nsneakwalk_forward.hkx\r\nsneakwalk_frwrdright.hkx\r\nsneakwalk_fwrwrdleft.hkx\r\nsneakwalk_left.hkx\r\nsneakwalk_right.hkx\r\n\r\n[heading]CHANGELOG--[/heading]\r\nv1.6:\r\nNew \"Light\" version with 50% less camera bob compared to \"Standard\" (with original vanilla sprint)\r\nNew \"Heavy\" version without FOV change when going into sprinting\r\nFixed \"Standard\" sprint stutter issue\r\nFixed \"Heavy\" sprint stutter issue\r\nUpdated \"Standard\" and \"Heavy\" sprint: more vertical camera shake for increased immersion\r\nUpdated \"Heavy\" running: less camera bob than previous version, but a lot more consistent with Heavy sprinting\r\n\r\nv1.5:\r\nNew \"Standard\" version with smoother running and increased sprinting bob\r\nNew \"Heavy\" version with serious head bobbing for both running and sprinting\r\nNew \"No Bob\" version with no camera bob in 1st person mode\r\nFixed no audible footstep sounds when sneaking\r\nAll animations synced with audio (running was slightly out of sync in the last version due to incorrect timing)\r\n\r\nv1.1:\r\nFixed no audible footstep sounds when sprinting\r\n\r\n-=RBE=-",
