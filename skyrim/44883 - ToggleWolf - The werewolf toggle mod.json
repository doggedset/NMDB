  "modName": "ToggleWolf - The werewolf toggle mod",
  "summary": "A simple mod that allows you to change between werewolf and human.",
  "descriptionHtml": "It is a simple mod with no requirements. The beast form can still expire over time but if you want it to end early all you have to do is  sheath your weapon, or in this case lower your arms ever so slightly. This is my first mod that I made that I am releasing to the public. This mod is mostly script based so other werewolf mods should work. (excluding other werewolf toggle mods) My only reason for this release is for players who want to have control over their \\\"Beast Form\\\" without having to do over complicated tasks to do it and to allow the Beast Form to stay useful threw out the full game.\r\n\r\nCurrent features:\r\n1. Made the \\\"Beast Form\\\" a lesser power so it can be used more then once a day.\r\n2. Made it so that if you sheath while you are a werewolf, it will trigger the revert process back into a human. (The process is not instant, you have to sheath and wait, the script will update and start the process automatically from there)\r\n3. Added a new script that makes the Beast Form dynamically stronger as you progress threw the game.\r\n\r\nFuture Ideas:\r\n1.You armor will automatically re-equip itself after reverting back.\r\n2.Might remove the time that triggers the revert process, so the werewolf will be permanent until you choose to revert.\r\n\r\nCurrent Dynamic Formulas:\r\nBeast Form Health = Player Health + 100 Base + ((Player Health + 100 Base) * 0.5)\r\nBeast Form Base Damage = Player Unarmed Damage + (Player Level * 2)\r\n\r\nFixed Glitches:\r\n1. You no longer loose hp after reverting back into human\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nNMM - Download the file threw NMM and activate the file\r\n\r\nManual - Download and unpack the file. Drop the contents from data into your \\\".../Skyrim/Data\\\" folder\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions to ask or bugs to report please leave a comment. If you have any ideas for improvements please leave a comment. The cover picture is not mine",
