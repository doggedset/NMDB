  "summary": "Fixes an issue with the music for Severin Manor.  If you haven\\'t yet completed the quest involving Severin Manor (in Raven Rock, on Solstheim) do not read the description for this mod as it contains what some may consider spoilers.  ",
  "descriptionHtml": "It irritated me that after Councilor Morvayn gave me the keys to Severin Manor, that it still had the dungeon music.  This simple, little mod simply changes the music for that cell to the normal Solstheim exploration music.  Note that if you install and activate this mod prior to completion of the quest, the Severin Manor music will still be changed to the normal Solstheim exploration music.  Frankly I don\\'t know why it ever had dungeon music in the first place because it is so quickly cleared that all you really hear in there is combat music anyway, but for those who want it to have dungeon music prior to gaining ownership of it, just be sure not to activate this mod until you have completed the quest.
