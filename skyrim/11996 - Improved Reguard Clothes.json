  "descriptionHtml": "I was disappointed that I could not upgrade the Hammerfall clothes found on Alik\\'r NPCs while playing my Redguard character, so I fixed that.\r\n\r\nIt is now craftable (under Misc) and improvable at a blacksmith. It is classified as Light Armor and benefits from perks. It is not pre-enchanted, so you can enchant it yourself to suit any type of character. The armor works for both male and female characters.\r\n\r\nThere are four versions. Two low level versions based on Leather Armor and two high level versions based on Dragonscale Armor (Smithing perk required). I did it this way because I wanted the look while leveling, without it being gamebreaking or overpowered. I also wanted to retain the look at higher levels without being gimp.\r\n\r\nLow Level:\r\n\r\nHammerfall Garb which uses the original model. Note: This does replace the original version.\r\nRedguard Assassin Garb which uses Nazir\\'s Dark Brotherhood color variant.\r\n\r\nHigh Level:\r\n\r\nRedguard Paragon which uses the original model.\r\nMaster Assassin Armor which uses Nazir\\'s DB color variant.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve also uploaded this mod on the Steam Workshop for user convenience.",
