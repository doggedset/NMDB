  "descriptionHtml": "This was a request by Gethesmain to recolor the Elven Armor.\r\n\r\nbefore ANYONE comments on the fact that women wear the same armor as men, this was requested as the default female Elven armor was not to Gethesmain\\'s liking. so the Female meshes are now exactly the same as the Male Meshes, i have tested this ingame and it actually looks awesome during the Thalmor parts of the Main Quest, finally, the elves are actually Uniformed and as un-varied as their attitude implies! \r\n\r\nanyway, check the screen-shots and download if you like.\r\n\r\nas always, to use my textures, PM me with what your using them for and i\\'ll give permission etc etc, and im always open for requests :)\r\n\r\nCallaghan04\r\n\r\n",
