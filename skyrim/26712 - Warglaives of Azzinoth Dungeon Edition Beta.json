  "summary": "Places the Warglaives of Azzinoth in a dungeon with a boss fight at the end.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I wanted to make the warglaives of Azzinoth obtainable through a different method rather than just making them so, I made a small dungeon which I intend to build on til it feels more like a quest. However, the boss is quite a challenge, so I wouldn\\'t go toe to toe with him until you are at least level 25. He wears ebony set except for the helmet and the warglavies of course.\r\n\r\nFeedback is very welcome, both critic and endorsing.\r\n\r\nThe cave is located south of Falkreath. I have included screenshots and spoilers for the dungeon.\r\n\r\nCredits to: faxivcm for making the warglaives of azzinoth and letting me use his mod in my mod! Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nInstallation: NMM Should be working fine. Otherwise just install it manually. You do not need the Warlgaives of Azzinoth file for this to work. They are included in my mod.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nDawnguard",
