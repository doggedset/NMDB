  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds four \"scrolls\" in the form of dwemer devices that mimic the effects of the following shouts:\n<br />\n<br />Atmospheric Agitator (Storm Call)\n<br />Cyclonic Blast Inducer (Cyclone)\n<br />Neurological Inhibitor (Bend Will -doesn't affect dragons)\n<br />Temporal Distortion Projector (Slow Time)\n<br />\n<br />To craft the devices you will need to obtain the research notes of a dwemer weapons researcher which can be found in a small dungeon just to the notheast of Mor Khazgur.  Originally I intended to create a quest initiated by receiving a letter from Calcelmo regarding a missing colleague but I get headaches just looking at the dialogue system in the creation kit  and gave up on that idea so you will just have to come up with a reason to seek out the site on your own.",
