  "descriptionHtml": "This is my female nord. I created her a few hours ago after i reinstalled skyrim due to random crashing with a mod. I\\'m still pissed off, Cause there was a patch for that mod that was making me crash and i didn\\'t even realize until after i saw the patch for that mod. Sigh sigh. \r\n\r\nHer name is J. Just like my dark elf, Which she is based off of a little bit. She is put at the part in the keep after you have your bonds cut. Hadvar is waiting to continue in the hall way leading to the open area where you have your first fight. \r\n\r\nThe mods i used are: \r\n\r\nBetter Females By Bella W/Lesser Makeup: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nApachiiSkyHair: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\n\r\nMissAniThropes Mystic Eyes: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12214\r\n\r\nThere are 3 Saves;\r\n\r\nThe first one is the original one.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd one is recreated to look exactly the same as the original except with siding with the stormcloak at the attack of helgen. \r\n\r\nThe third one was a Face transfer using \\\"nycz\\'s Skyrim Face Transfer program\\\" (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15307), from the original to keep the same original look.
