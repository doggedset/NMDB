  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod. It adds a follower named Ethan to the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. The funny thing about this mod is that I named the npc after myself.  Ethan is a one-handed swordsman with Blades Armor as a default along with the Blades Sword. He is pretty good at everything, but exceptional at none for balancing purposes. Please try out this mod and give feedback. This is the first in a series of follower mods that when finished will be best played with a mod that allows you to have multiple followers.",
