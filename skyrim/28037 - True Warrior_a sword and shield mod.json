  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i1161.photobucket.com/albums/q515/Dfac364/RRtwCoverPhoto.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1161.photobucket.com/albums/q515/Dfac364/RRtwTitle_01.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nA True Warrior valued his weapons not on how well they looked hung up on a wall but how well they could get the job done. They were tools, covered in dents and nicks, with a spattering of stained blood. A treasure hunter was a euphamism for a grave robber and a brigand, and a Hero was such only to the winning side, to the enemy he was a plague. If these warriors had stumbled upon a bit plummed armor or an ornate weapon they wouldnt have kept it, they would have sold it as fast as they could for whores and booze. It is with that in mind that I made this mod, to bring a little more reality into a game already so great.\r\n\r\n[color=red]*To get the sword and shield you must go towards Whiterun and than follow the whiteriver east until you come to a Stormcloak camp, to the right of the camp will be a statue of Talos guarding the entrance to a cave, enter the cave and kill the guardian inside to claim your prize[/color]\r\n[IMG]http://i1161.photobucket.com/albums/q515/Dfac364/RRtwPicture.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1161.photobucket.com/albums/q515/Dfac364/RRtwTitle_02.jpg[/IMG]\r\nV1.1\r\n-fixed missing temper recipes\r\n-altered sword damage to match Ebony sword\r\n\r\nV1.0\r\n-a fast a small questline\r\n-a fully unique one handed sword\r\n-a fully unique light shield\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1161.photobucket.com/albums/q515/Dfac364/RRtwTitle_03.jpg[/IMG]\r\nDownload using the nexus mod manager or download manually and unzip file, than merge the data folder with the data folder on your computer found in \\\"Steam/Steamapps/common/Skyrim\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n",
