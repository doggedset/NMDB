  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=4]Flik is [b][size=4]one of the 108 Stars of Destiny and wielder of the Lightning Rune\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b]This is my reproduction of one of my favorite characters from an RPG series from way back when. There's always a shortage of good male followers so thought I'd share this one. He isn't just easy on the eyes though. This spellsword warrior also has some pretty crazy abilities at his disposal as well!\n<br />\n<br />How to get him: You automatically get a spell that can call him. Just be outdoors and have no current main follower and you can get him whenever\n<br />\n<br />I pretty much made all these assets myself. The hair is from KS Hairdo's and I'm 90% sure the face is from Better Males but I would have to recheck. If I missed any permission info I will update\n<br />\n<br />Hope you like!\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b]",
