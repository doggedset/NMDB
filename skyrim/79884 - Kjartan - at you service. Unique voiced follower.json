  "descriptionHtml": "[right][i]&#34;Wow so many unique-voiced followers... female ones. I really feel like there should be at least one more. And a guy.&#34;[/i][/right][right][i]- Amczek, around December 2015\r<br />\r<br />[/i][/right]\r<br />[b][center]KJARTAN VARGEN[/center][/b][img]http://i192.photobucket.com/albums/z261/Wampirencja/Kjart1.png[/img]\r<br />   Fully voiced with over 1500 lines of commentary and dialogue follower. Quest, sex and race oriented male Breton follower. He has dialogue for specific locations and - huzzah - some stories and legends to tell. For sure it&#39;s for those who enjoy some talking and backstory more than do this-carry that guy. \r<br />\r<br />   Our friend (or not) is equipped with one-hand sword and some spells, but he will level with PC. He will heal himself if needed and have quite a few spells in his sleeves, as a proper Breton should. \r<br />\r<br />   Kjartan can be befriended after helping him find what he is looking for which comes with benefits like him talking waaay more, stories to share, tiny trinkets and - if you find yourself in need - he will romance you no matter race or sex (but it&#39;s not aimed at pure romance, so this branch can be cut off&#33;). \r<br />   Future plans include mods patches (so he won&#39;t get quiet while exploring Summerset Isles or other DLC-sized quest-mods&#33;).\r<br />\r<br />   You will find him rather bored somewhere in... you will find out. First head to Markarth. Get a drink perhaps?\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i192.photobucket.com/albums/z261/Wampirencja/Kjart3.png[/img]\r<br />   This mod will give you Kjartan. And that&#39;s most important here. But also you will receive...\r<br />[b]      [color=#f1c232]SMALL QUESTS [/color][/b]- because, why not? Small quests are fun. \r<br />[b]      [color=#f1c232]   PLAYER HOUSE[/color][/b]- Nothing too fancy, but a non-respawning house that you can use  for free. \r<br />[b]            [color=#f1c232]BONUS PET[/color][/b] inside the house. It&#39;s mostly for fun, it does tell jokes. (talk to Kjartan about it)\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#f1c232]How to recruit him? \r<br />[/color][/b]   Find a courier and listen to the cry of a lost his package. You will be able to recruit him as soon as you help courier... and maybe a little more. \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#f1c232]Is he marriable?\r<br />[/color][/b]   For the time being (as I am writing this text) - not really, no. But if there will be need I&#39;ll try to figure it out. \r<br />[b]\r<br />[color=#f1c232]Why he doesn&#39;t look like on screens?\r<br />[/color][/b]   Look for required files for him to look properly. There is also not so lore friendly eye candy version of him (or will be if I won&#39;t forget). \r<br />I also use [b]Photoreal ENB[/b] by RaiderXGame for screens along with light and texture mods. \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#f1c232]There are some grammar mistakes. Or spelling. Or something. [/color][/b]\r<br />   English is not my first language. Not even second. I did my best, as well as a friend who helped me record all voices. WE did our best for FREE \r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232] Bug, bug, bug, glitch....[/color]\r<br />   Report it. I tried to eliminate all of them but they still could happen. [b]Some quest markers not showing up is NOT A BUG [/b](sometimes you have to look for something yourself). \r<br />[img]http://i192.photobucket.com/albums/z261/Wampirencja/Kjart2.png[/img] \r<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]    DLCs needed[/size][/color]\r<br />    I used all of them, so have Dragonborn and Dawnguard at your side. Probably Hearthfire too. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]   Cosmetics[/size][/color]\r<br />   *you can skip them if you want but he won&#39;t look like on screens\r<br />      *I offer also Apachii-less version of Kjartan if you don&#39;t want &#34;a lot of hair in your Kjartan&#34; mod to skip those completely. \r<br />   \r<br />   [color=#ffffff]1.
