  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'m just getting in to using the creation kit, hoping to eventually have a crafting-related quest up and loaded. Right now, I thought I\\'d mess with effects, and this is the result: An amulet that gives the \\'ghost\\' effect.\r\n\r\nUsing 2 \\'philter of the phantom\\' potions, and the Skyforge, the amulet is craftable without any prior perks needed. On top of the ghost effect, it adds water breathing and 15% to all resistances.\r\n\r\nI wanted it to be something you could use if you enjoyed, along with it benefitting gameplay. \r\n\r\nTested on Master Difficulty... and still felt over-powered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know what would make this balanced (as it\\'s clearly not), and if there are any other \\'effects\\' (like ghost) you\\'d like to see, and I\\'ll see if I can get them to work in-game.\r\n\r\n!UPDATE! - BUG WARNING:\r\n\r\nScratch that earlier update.\r\n\r\nPermanently transparent effect, even with the amulet removed.\r\n\r\nConfirmed Fix: Try spawning a philter of the phantom and then drinking it.\r\n",
