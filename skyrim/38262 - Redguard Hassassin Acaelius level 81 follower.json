The hassassins were an order of Nizari Ismailis, particularly those of Persia (and Syria) that existed from around 1092 to 1265. Posing a strong military threat to Sunni Saljuq authority within the Persian territories, the Nizari Ismailis captured and inhabited many mountain fortresses under the leadership of Hassan-i Sabbah. The word hash means cannabis, which the assassins would take before sent out to murder their target.",
