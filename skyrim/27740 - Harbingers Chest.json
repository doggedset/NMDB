  "descriptionHtml": "Got frustrated with my tons of loot at lvl 10 and Harbinger title... thought why the heck I can\\'t have safe storage in Jorrvaskr?! So did it myself. There is a key to the chest - it lies on the end table which stands in front of bed in Harbinger\\'s room. The chest is non-respawning ofc ;) It\\'s available from the very beginning... when I find out how to do this, I\\'ll make this to available only after finishing companions questline... until then, you can either roleplay you can\\'t access it or don\\'t give a !!!! about it and just use the chest... ;)",
