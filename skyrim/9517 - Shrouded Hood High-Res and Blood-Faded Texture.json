However, I wasn\\'t going to let my character walk around with the original hood (as those of you who have DS Shrouded Armor would know) I used Bethesda\\'s hi-res Warlock Hood and retextured it to fit the red and black shrouded armor.[/center]\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\n[b]1.[/b] Place \\\"Data\\\" file in your Skyrim directory:\r\n\\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\"\r\n\r\n[b]2.[/b] Overwrite \\\"dbarmor_hood.dds\\\" and \\\"dbarmor_hood_n.dds\\\"\r\n\r\n[b]3.[/b] To revert to the hi-res vanilla Shrouded Armor you must delete all the files from the following path [u][b]EXCEPT[/b][/u] for the ones that have the \\\"word\\\" hood in them: \r\n\\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\dbarmor\\\"\r\n\r\nMY OTHER MODS:\r\n\r\n[url=file.php?id=9241]Build-A-Dwarven Army[/url]\r\nForge and heal Automatons to fight for you!\r\n\r\n[url=file.php?id=8915]Peryite\\'s Blessing - A Special Shout[/url]\r\nLots-a-puke for your enemies.",
