  "descriptionHtml": "Name: First Person Fix\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nDate: 1/18/2012\r\nCategory: Miscellaneous\r\nAuthor(s): SoberBarn\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nEver get sick of playing a Nord or Orc and looking at the middle of other races\\' chests? Me too, so I made this mod just for you. This was an easy fix and I was happy to do it for all of you who may not have known how to do this or even know it was possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nThis mod was calibrated using a Kajhiit set at a scale of 1.04, though I\\'m pretty sure that is the height of a standard Nord or Orc. That being said this perfect for playing a Cathay-raht Kajhiit. Enjoy.\r\n\r\nAlso, in order for third and first person views to line up, insert this line into the bottom of your Skyrim.ini\r\n\r\n[Camera]\r\nfOverShoulderCombatPosZ=7.5000\r\nfOverShoulderPosZ=7.5000\r\n\r\nIf this proves to be too difficult, I can add another file to do it for you.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\nJust unzip the \\\"meshes\\\" folder into your \\\"Skyrim/Data\\\" directory.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nWell if you insist just delete \\\"skeleton.nif\\\" from \\\"Meshes/Actors/Character/_1stPerson\\\"\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n=======\r\n1.0 - Initial release.\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nAnything that also alters \\\"skeleton.nif\\\"\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nNone yet, however let me know if you find something.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nSoberBarn, here on the Nexus\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to SaidenStorm who laid out how to do this on the forum.\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Oblivion.\r\nThanks to SkyrimNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\nThanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\r\nThanks to God for creating us all.\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\n7-Zip - http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=15579\r\nNIFSkope - http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope\r\nReadme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nYou can do whatever you want with this mod but don\\'t complain to me if it \r\ndoesn\\'t work or your PC blows up.",
