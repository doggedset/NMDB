  "descriptionHtml": "TruePC by Nekroze from EturnilNetwork.com \r\n========================================================================================\r\nA set of tweaks and changes, some gathered from around the active Skyrim descussion locations and some from my own testing.\r\n\r\nThese tweaks culminate in, what I hope, is a better graphics option for PC. Some setting like \r\nshadows may be questionable on their softness but many of these tweaks come from my disappointment \r\nin the \\\"Quality\\\" of many things like the shadows on PC and my attempt at compensating it until \r\nsomeone with real skills can fix it when the CS comes out. Also this includes more PC compatable\r\nchanges like removing mouse acceleration and increasing FOV and some other little fixes for PC like ENBseries and 4gb patch!\r\n\r\nFor those who want to test the latest bleeding edge version of TruePC you can choose either of the\r\n2.0 Pre-Beta options from the installer. Use the second (fix) 2.0 Pre-Beta option only if you the patching process\r\nor INSTALL-TruePC.exe script at the end of the installation fails.\r\n\r\nFor those who want to give it a try and are not sure about it:\r\n1 - it is SUPER easy to install and remove cleanly.\r\n2 - Pictures just cannot capture almost any of the modifications so you really have to see it in action.\r\n3 - nothing to loose from trying it!\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n========================================================================================\r\n1 - Download\r\n2 - Run the installer\r\n3 - Select ONE version to install (1.4 is a stable release OR Select 2.0 if you want to try out the pre-beta)\r\n4 - OPTIONAL: Select also ENBseries for added graphical perfomance and fixes\r\n5 - Keep the installer open and DONOT run TruePC at the end of installation yet!\r\n5 - Open Skyrim launcher and set graphics settings to HIGH (only the overall settings button leave everything else default (make sure your resolution is correct))\r\n6 - Now run TruePC from the last installation dialog and accept the patching proccess\r\n7 - TEMPORARY FIX: For now you will need to go to Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim and run INSTALL-TruePC.exe to fix an installer issue\r\n8 - Play Skyrim like its a drug!\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n========================================================================================\r\n1 - TEMPORARY FIX: For now you will need to go to Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim and run INSTALL-TruePC.exe to fix an installer issue\r\n2 - Run the uninstaller from your StartMenu->TruePC\r\n3 - Run the Installer for the new version!\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL:\r\n========================================================================================\r\n1 - TEMPORARY FIX: For now you will need to go to Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim and run INSTALL-TruePC.exe to fix an installer issue\r\n2 - Run the uninstaller from your StartMenu->TruePC\r\n3 - Continue playing as if you had never experienced TruePC Skyrim\r\n\r\nTo simplify installation i have included and used SwissFileKnife as found \r\nhere http://stahlworks.com/dev/swiss-file-knife.html and also have included the bsd-license it comes with.\r\nAlso TruePC has packaged in a 4gb patcher from http://www.ntcore.com/4gb_patch.php\r\nand the always awesome ENBseries modifications from http://enbdev.com/\r\n\r\nISSUES/TROUBLESHOOTING:\r\n========================================================================================\r\nPOST INSTALLATION SCRIPT FAILED!\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nTry deleting Skyrim.ini and SkyrimPrefs.ini and then going into the launcher and setting your graphics to HIGH, this will\r\ncreate perfectly clean ini\\'s to work with, always worth a try.\r\n\r\nIf you are still having Issues installing, you can either examine your ini files and the TruePC.ini and change your erronious\r\nvalues to the expected OR under when installing try use any FIX version of the version of TruePC you are trying to install instead.\r\n\r\nSTILL WANT MORE SKYRIM GRAPHICS?\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\ncheck out http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=21 or http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=31 \r\nfor a great and elegant modifications to Skyrim that work perfectly with TruePC! \r\nNOTE: I am in no way affiliated with the author of the above mods I am just a fan.\r\n\r\nFor now, if any other issues arise or if you have any feedback/suggestions please leave them in the \r\ndiscussion/comment section for this mod and I will get back to you as soon as a human with a fresh copy of skyrim can!\r\n\r\nSo please enjoy and keep in mind that this is my first public \\\"mod\\\" ever!\r\n   Nekroze\r\n   \r\nSPECIAL THANKS:\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nBig thanks to phantomgamerz for QA testing and general help!\r\n   \r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\n========================================================================================\r\nI am in no way responsible for anything mentioned here or included with this breaking your game and or computer in any way.",
