Because saving them as a complexion keeps\r<br />the detail i wanted,warpaints not.And again they may not look perfect i cant do anything about that either,\r<br />the way they look in Photoshop it&#39;s a dream,but in game renders differently.Same i cant play so much with\r<br />colors as well just cuz of this reason.I really hope i find a solution for it in the future,but for now\r<br />is like this.\r<br />\r<br />Henna Body Art is a set of tattoos made with Henna brushes in Photoshop,for now they are just parts of \r<br />the body,i&#39;m working and challenged myself to make the whole body,but for that i need to study this art\r<br />in more detail and basically know how to piece all together,otherwise makes no sense,maybe more like \r<br />this one i just made,but like i said i need to know more :P\r<br />\r<br />None of this have been possible without my recent passion for Photoshop,my Duc and Milla who&#39;s resources\r<br />i&#39;ve used with her permission.Both of them have an important role in my life and i wanna thank them\r<br />again and big hugs :D She is licensed and profesional,i higly respect and love her artwork.I hope one\r<br />day i can compare myself to her :)\r<br />\r<br />For those who use Extended Slider Colors&#33;In order to work u have to use the ExtendedColorsPatcher.exe\r<br />Just patch CuteDesigns.esp just like u did for the race.Instructions u find in the mod&#39;s page description.\r<br />\r<br />Oh and about requests i&#39;m not taking any,not because i don&#39;t want to,but because i need time and i want\r<br />to do it my way,learning process,fail process and so on.Hope u understand :)\r<br />\r<br />I hope u guys enjoy and be more unique a lil&#39; bit :)\r<br />[img]http://i46.tinypic.com/dqpuvr.png[/img]\r<br />Duc my lil&#39; squirrel for always being there for me in everything & making the esp :)\r<br />Milla for her kind words and amazing resources,i cant thank you enough :)\r<br />Danessa thank you,i wish i could have talked to you as well :)\r<br />Seren for taking the lil&#39; time he has and answering my pm&#39;s,making this as a face \r<br />complexion,he was the one who told me:)\r<br />Wast1980,thank you,cuz of you i&#39;ve got interested in Phoptoshop in the first place :)\r<br />And all the other authors who&#39;s work i&#39;ve used to take my screenshots \r<br />brokefoot(Dandelion armor),Apachii(SkyHair),Radioragae and DragonAge7 (Hair packs of\r<br />Fallout3 and the fixed version of them),zzjay & cazy (Cazy hairs),dimon99 & calyps\r<br />(unp and unpb body),Pinup Poser by Halofarm \r<br />Everyone else who liked my(still not entirely) own humble designs,Duc,trustinall,\r<br />schmoops9,kamikazekossori,BravoOscar,Wast1980,zzjay.If i forgot someone i&#39;m sry,\r<br />thank you anyway :D\r<br />Next one will be only my own and i hope to amaze :D\r<br />Bethesda Game Studios,thank you,Skyrim is definitely legendary :)\r<br />\r<br />P.S If anyone is interested into Milla&#39;s (Atenais) resources u can have a look [url=http://www.renderosity.com/homepage.php?page=1&userid=546257] Milla [/url]\r<br />\r<br />Update : Compatibility with Ashen Race 2.6DG .Two versions are included,one for Dawnguard edition of the mod and one standard&#33; As well fixed the issue where some users had they&#39;r character stuck in one position as a vampire&#33;Hope this got fixed,let me know if it&#39;s working or if u encounter any other problems with it&#33;Thank you :)",
