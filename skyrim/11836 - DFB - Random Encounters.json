  "descriptionHtml": "==================================================================\r\n= DFB - Random Encounters\r\n==================================================================\r\n\r\nAuthor: Darkfirebird\r\nPermissions: Scripts cannot be used ( In part or whole ), redone, and the likes without written permission from me.\r\nAside for personal use only.\r\n\r\nYou may not repost this anywhere without any permission by me. ( Darkfirebird )\r\n\r\n++Note: If any encounter locations are near Quest areas, also report them and I will remove them from that locations.\r\nI tried pretty hard to avoid getting it near all the areas I know of.\r\n\r\nNOTE: When updating to 0.6 ( or higher. ) from a lower version, Uninstall this mod, load save and save. Then install. ( `Clean` Save )\r\nNOTE2: When updating to version 1.1. You may or may not need to do a clean save. ( Old unused script vars or new do not get updated on old NPCs and such. )\r\n\r\n==========\r\n=Overview=\r\n==========\r\n-Adds random encounters all over Tamriel. Extremely customizable!\r\n-This is a remake of my mod Random Encounters from New Vegas except a lot more better in different ways.\r\n\r\n===============\r\n= Description =\r\n===============\r\n-This is a remake of my mod Random Encounters from New Vegas except a lot more better in different ways. Ever\r\nwanted to see a Dwarven Spider far away from the ruins? Or maybe some Dremoras? Well now you can. Want more then just\r\nthe default amount? Go ahead! Set it to 100! ( I don\\'t recommend it... It will really spawn 100. ) Want to disable\r\n1 or some of the encounters? You can! Even Werewolves and Vampires!\r\n\r\n-Customized functions for easier use and implementations of further encounters.\r\n-Currently over 200 Encounter locations!\r\n-Currently adds these encounters:\r\n++Assassins\r\n++Atronach\r\n++Bandits ( Simple enough for any game! )\r\n++Bears\r\n++Chaurus\\'\r\n++Dragons\r\n++Draugr\r\n++Dremor\r\n++Dwarven Spider, Sphere, Centurion\r\n++Falmer\r\n++Forsworn\r\n++Ghosts\r\n++Hagraven\r\n++Ice Wraith\r\n++Magic Anomalies\r\n++Nightingales\r\n++Orcs\r\n++Sabre Cats\r\n++Skeletons\r\n++Spiders\r\n++Spriggans\r\n++Thalmor\r\n++Trolls\r\n++Vampires\r\n++Warlocks\r\n++Werewolves\r\n++Witches\r\n++Wolves\r\n++Similiar to how my Random Encounters worked for New Vegas, but much better!\r\n\r\n===============\r\n= Performance =\r\n===============\r\nThis mod as VERY LITTLE impact on most computers. The only demanding parts are higher spawn rates. The mod itself does not cause\r\nlag spikes on its own. ( Example: 20+ NPCs spawning, Many Dragons spawning if enabled. Etc. )\r\nThe defaults are very light on many computers that meet the requirements for this game. :) So if you are looking for more spawns\r\nthat you can customize that is also lightweight. This mod is for you. :)\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n= Humanoid Vs Creatures =\r\n=========================\r\nFeature - Instead of spawning from a list, this setting focus\\' on spawning 1 Humanoid Faction against a Creature Faction.\r\n\r\nExample: Thalmor spawned; Bandits, Warlocks, Assassins and the likes won\\'t ever spawn against them. Only creatures such as:\r\nBears, Chaurus, Sabrecat, Hagraven ( Ugly things. ), and the likes will spawn with them.\r\nThese will usually fight each other.\r\n\r\nTo enable this spawn setup:\r\n1) Open Console ( Default is Tilde Key. ` / ~ )\r\n2) Type [ Set DFBEncCrH to 1 ] AND [ Set DFBEncDual to 1 ]\r\n++ NOTE: Dual Factions MUST BE ENABLED for this to work.\r\n3) Explore and find the fun. :)\r\n\r\n==============\r\n= Known Bugs =\r\n==============\r\n-Sometimes the cleanup does not run right away. Varies.\r\n-Sometimes Ghost NPCs \\'stretch\\' randomly. ( Rarely happens normally. )\r\n\r\n================\r\n= Installation =\r\n================\r\nCopy DFB - Random Encounters.esp and DFB - Random Encounters.bsa to your Data Folder.\r\n+Run launcher and enable. ( Recommend use with Nexus Mod Manager. )\r\n\r\nTo Uninstall, disable and delete. Has no bad side effects.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n= In-Game Settings =\r\n====================\r\n-As with my original mod, you can set up the encounters and amounts.\r\nNOTE: These are in the Console Commands txt file.\r\n\r\nAlternatively: You can place _dfbre.txt in your Skyrim Folder ( Where TESV.exe is. ) and in game type [ bat _dfbre.txt ]\r\n+This is a quick way to set up defaults across all your saves. Also contains default values next to it. This does NOT need to be redone each time you load your save. Once used, they stick to that save!\r\n++This file is located in [ Place.Me.In.Skyrim.Folder ] Folder when you unpack the mod.\r\n\r\n=========\r\n= Notes =\r\n=========\r\n-May cause CTDs with Occupy Skyrim and other spawn heavy mods. ( Some users have reported it works with them while others not. )\r\nThis may or may not be related to CPU Power, GFX Power, and the likes. I have not found the reasoning behind the crashes as I never\r\nhad these types of issues. ( I do not use a lot of external mods aside my own. So player experience may vary! )\r\n\r\n=================\r\n=Version History=\r\n=================\r\n== Version 1.1a ==\r\n-Updated Dual Encounter and Creature Vs Humanoid encounter scripts.\r\n-Some minor fixes.\r\n\r\n== Version 1.1 ==\r\n-NPC: Search: Lowered Searching radius to 4500.

( They attacked each other. )\r\n-Core: Difficulty Modifiers changed. ( They are Multipliers to their Health, Magicka, and Stamina )\r\n-Core: New Command: DFBEncSearchRadius: Radius for the NPC to search for players if they have them enabled to.\r\n-Core: New Command: DFBEncDiffSep - Enable or disable separate difficulties per encounter.

This applies when the NPC loads. ( Console Command File for more info. )\r\n-Core: New Command: DFBEncDiffHard - This command is a multiplier for their Health, Magicka, and Stamina.

( Caused issues. )\r\n-Core: Commands: Most Commands had their \\'names\\' changed. Was confusing that some were plural and some were not. They are now all singles. ( IE: Skeletons is Skeleton. etc )\r\n++Notes: New Bat txt file updated to reflect changes.\r\n-Encounters: Nightingale Encounters added.\r\n-Encounters: Ghost Encounters added.\r\n-Encounters: Dwarven Encounters adjusted. Now it has 6 spawns. ( 3 Spiders, 2 Spheres, and 1 Centurion. ) This should be better for balance purposes.\r\n-Encounters: Added 25 more locations.\r\n\r\n== Version 1.0 ==\r\n-No longer in BETA. :)\r\n-NPC: Dremora Missile: Voice fixed. It was unused by Vanilla.\r\n-NPC: All: New AI Packages set up.

Default off. Setting this on, the NPC will always be looking for you. ( If within distance. )\r\n-Locations: 33 Locations added.\r\n-Debug / Testing Area: Redone testing room for users wishing to test. The area is 8x bigger and outlines the encounter triggers.

( To better work with the NPC changes. )\r\n\r\n== Version 0.6c ==\r\n-Core: NPC Despawn Check: Updated Scripts to have 2 checks. ( So they won\\'t despawn in front of you outside in the world. )\r\n-Core: NPC Despawn Check: Moved up to 5s Single Updates instead of 1s Singles.

( IE: 1 to 1, 4 to 4 ). Shouldn\\'t happen, just a precaution.\r\n-Core: Auto-Fixes bad Spawn Amounts. ( Example: Having Zero or Negatives. )\r\n-Core: Auto-Fixes Min and Max multipliers so Min can never pass Max spawn settings. They can however be the same.\r\n-Extra: Added a bat txt file for those who wish to use the console bat command to quickly set up your encounters!\r\n--Located in Place.Me.In.Skyrim.Folder Folder ( If you used Nexus Mod Manager this is in your Data Folder. )\r\n\r\n== Version 0.6a ==\r\n-New Command: DFBEncMult - Multiply spawn amount by this amount.\r\n++Example: Mult is 2. A 4 would be 8 and then randomized between 2-8 instead of 1-4.\r\n-Core: Auto-Fixes bad settings for Difficulty and Multiplier.\r\n-Balancing: Dragon Additional HP increased to 500. ( Up from 400. )\r\n-Balancing: Assassins now have a better base HP and weapon skill scaling.\r\n-AI Packages: Removed and set up to a Default Wander.
