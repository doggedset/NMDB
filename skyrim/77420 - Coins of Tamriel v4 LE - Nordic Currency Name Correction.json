  "modName": "Coins of Tamriel v4 LE - Nordic Currency Name Correction",
  "summary": "Patch for Coins of Tamriel V4 by Force70. Renames Nordic currency from Alessia to Felldir. Alessia was a Cyrodilic Saint that had no dealings with Skyrim. Felldir the Old was one of the 3 heroes who freed the Nords from the Dragon Regime,  of the first Dragon War. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "I like Coins of Tamriel but the name Force70 gave the Nordic coins just rubbed my OCD-ness the wrong way. He named the Nordic coins Alessia. [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Alessia]Saint Alessia[/url] was a Cyrodilic historical figure that has nothing to with Skyrim or Nords. She was the founder of the first human Cyrodiil Empire after liberating Cyrodiil&#39;s humans from Ayeleid slavery. \r<br />\r<br />I chose to rename currency from Alessia to Felldir. [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Felldir_the_Old]Felldir the Old[/url], [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Gormlaith_Golden-Hilt]Gormlaith Golden-Hilt[/url] and [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Hakon_One-Eye]Hakon One-Eye[/url] overthrew the Dragons in the first Dragon War. \r<br />\r<br />[b]UPDATE[/b]: Some people in the comment section have pointed out some very interesting links between Alessia and the Ancient Nords that I have missed. I stand corrected. :) I guess at this point, it&#39;ll boil down to preference. My personal preference is still Felldir over Alessia and I&#39;ll be leaving this patch for whoever wants it. :D\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits and Requirement:[/b] Force70 for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51871/?]Coins of Tamriel V4 Legendary Edition[/url]. I don&#39;t take any credit for his mod, I simply did the name change for one of the currencies.\r<br />\r<br />Install Coins of Tamriel normally and put this patch after it&#39;s esp in your load order.",
