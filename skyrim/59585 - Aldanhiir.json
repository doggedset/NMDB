  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][size=4]\r<br />I am currently working on a revision of the mod. If anyone has suggestions, let me know.\r<br />The buildable player home will be gone, and there will be a practice area for the guards.[/size][/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a new village, near Markarth. The people from the village almost never leave, and the other people in Skyrim do not know of it&#39;s existence. \r<br />Not much is known about the origins of the village, but clues are there that the Dwemer had something to do with it. \r<br />\r<br />[b][i]I have tried a lot, but I can&#39;t get it to work without the Hearthfires-DLC... \r<br />Therefore, a new patch may not come very soon. (and because I will be focussing more on the Tolkien-Theme)[/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />The shops in the village have unusual opening-times if you got used to the every-day shops of Skyrim. Shop-owners almost never work every day of the week. The village is rich enough to afford it. \r<br />[img]https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t31.0-8/906413_1066058416822946_5867333514862226089_o.jpg[/img]\r<br />[b][size=4]Finding the village:[/size][/b]\r<br />As soon as you install the mod, you will get a map marker showing the - mostly unused - entrance to the village.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]The mod adds:[/b][/size]\r<br />A new village, with 5 vendors, a jail and a longhouse. \r<br />1 playerhome that is already there\r<br />1 playerhome you can built yourself\r<br />   I did not like the eventual design, and so stopped to put in a lot of effort. I even left the chest with building-materials, so you don&#39;t have to run all \r<br />   around Skyrim to gather the resources. I did however choose to not delete it (yet). In a new version, I will delete all the hearthfire-content and \r<br />   add some traininggrounds where the hearthfires house now is.\r<br />2 secret area&#39;s\r<br />1 complete set of armour and from every weapon one item. (all re-textured and available through quests)\r<br />1 new type of ore\r<br />8 quests\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Be sure to also check out the website I made for this mod&#33;[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=4][b][url=http://vdhorses.wix.com/aldanhiir]http://vdhorses.wix.com/aldanhiir[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Request:[/b][/size]\r<br />If someone wants to voice-act one of the characters, knows a new quest that would fit into the town or wants to have a go at furnishing the hearthfires house, feel free to let me know&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Skyrim mods top 5 of the week[/b][/size]:\r<br />For those that watch Skyrim Mods top 5 of the Week, one of the secret rooms is based on that show. I can give you one hint: Longhouse.\r<br />The rest may check it out too, of course. Search well for the entrance&#33; Once you see the room, you will know you are there. Undoubtedly.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first serious mod, so any hits, tips or help would be really appreciated.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]To Do list:[/b][/size]\r<br />Delete the hearthfires content and create a training-area.\r<br />Create a custom enchantment for the weapons and armour.\r<br />Add some more quests, and perhaps more dungeons.\r<br />Expand the lore of the mod quite significantly.\r<br />Give the player the choice of speaking Dovahzul with the dragons.\r<br />Some more things...\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]UPDATE 1.01:[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=2]-The entrance of Aldanhiir is now accessible by followers.\r<br />-[/size]Adds some extras to the Skryim Mods top 5 of the Week content.\r<br />-Adds the custom textured shield. It is not available through quest, but from a chest. \r<br />-Makes the spell you get from the main-quest useful during the rest of the game. ",
