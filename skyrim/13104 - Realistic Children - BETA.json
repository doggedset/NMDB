  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is an attempt to add more realistic children to Skyrim. Now children are mortal, and are capable of defending themselves if attacked. Furthermore they are also now likely to defend their family and friends if something happens to them. The idea though isn\\'t to make all children react like super heroes all of a sudden, and they won\\'t. Some children will be braver than others, whereas several will still flee at the smallest sign of danger.\r\n\r\nCurrent Features:\r\n- All Children are mortal now, with the exception of quest-essential children which are temporarily rendered immortal until completion of said quest.\r\n- Forsworn Children added to the leveled lists.\r\n\r\nPlanned Additions:\r\n- Adding variety to the clothing children wear. They shouldn\\'t all essentially wear the same exact thing world-wide.\r\n- Try to make children look different. Less clone-faces and what not. More hair options too.\r\n- Stat adjustments on certain stock-children so they\\'re not all quite so frail.\r\n- Implement Khajiit, Argonian, and Orc children to the game. Seriously, how were these forgotten?\r\n- Add generic bandit-type children to the field, living in dens with other thieves and such. \r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nThis mod is currently in BETA status. While I\\'m fairly confident in this initial release, I\\'m also pretty certain given the scope of this mod a few unforeseen oddities could have been overlooked on my part. As such I need eager players to test this mod and report all bugs they find.",
