In addition, some textures may not show up properly unless you have installed the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=786476615]Naruto Overhaul (Steam Workshop)[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[b]Tobi’s Pack[/b] (Contains updated version of gunbai.)\r<br />=====================================================================\r<br />[u]Authors[/u]: esuriddick and robert101410 \r<br />[u]Permissions[/u]: as long as you grant credit to where you picked up the files, you can do whatever you want with the files.

Required files/programs[/b]\r<br />=====================================================================\r<br />Skyrim Script Extender (version 1.6.15 or up): http://skse.silverlock.org/ \r<br />\r<br />Please be careful with mods altering the position of the markers, because, for the teleport spells, markers from the vanilla game were used. Any change to them will change the destination and may, eventually, cause bugs (I’m not sure which mods actually change markers. Most mods change just visuals and leave these intact).\r<br />=====================================================================\r<br />[b]3. Installation[/b]\r<br />=====================================================================\r<br />Just to be safe, always save the game before installing this mod.\r<br />[u]Way 1[/u]: Use the Nexus Mod Manager to download the mod and it will do it automatically.\r<br />[u]Way 2[/u]: Subscribe to the mod in the Steam Workshop (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=141966834) and launch the Game Launcher, so it downloads and installs the mod.\r<br />[u]Way 3[/u]: Manually download the mod and place the .esp and the .bsa inside the folder “Data” of the Skyrim game folder.\r<br />=====================================================================\r<br />[b]4. What does this mod add?[/b]\r<br />=====================================================================\r<br />All spells (Misc branch), the gloves and boots (Leather branch), the orange and white masks (Leather branch), and the Gunbai (Steel branch) can be forged. The War Outfit can be found in a secret room inside the Void. It will be on a chest, but won&#39;t be unprotected... To leave the secret area, [b]DON&#39;T[/b] use teleport to the Void, it will get you stuck in the other dimension for good. Instead, activate the stone near the place from where you arrived.\r<br />\r<br />- [b][i]Tobi’s jutsus[/i][/b]:\r<br />   - Become Ethereal: a spell to become ethereal for 2 minutes.\r<br />   - Tobi’s Teleport: allows you to teleport to any one of the major cities and a lot more other locations instantly - also teleports the followers with you.\r<br />   - Teleport to the Void: teleports you AND your follower to a special dimension that you can call home. \r<br />   - Teleport Target to the Void (Touch Spell&#33; It will automatically stop casting when you hit a target, so it doesn’t go into a loop): in the special dimension, there is a cage. This is where you can send people to with this spell (except Dragons, Giants, and anything dwarven). Any enemy in the Void can be teleported to the real world by using this spell on them. They will be teleported to the place where you were when you teleported yourself to the Void.\r<br />   - Void’s Chest: allows you to place and take items from the chest in the Void without having to go there. \r<br />\r<br />- [b][i]Gunbai (1H and 2H)[/i][/b]: this mod doesn’t place the 1H gunbai on the back. For that, use the mod “1HD Weapons on Back TS Edition”, found here on the section “6. Recommended mods to improve the experience”.\r<br />- [b][i]Tobi’s White Mask[/i][/b].\r<br />- [b][i]Tobi’s Orange Mask[/i][/b].\r<br />- [b][i]Tobi’s War Mask[/i][/b].\r<br />- [b][i]Tobi’s War Gloves[/i][/b].\r<br />- [b][i]Tobi’s War Boots[/i][/b].\r<br />- [b][i]Tobi’s War Outfit[/i][/b].\r<br />=====================================================================\r<br />[b]5. Bugs / Warnings[/b]\r<br />=====================================================================\r<br />- When you have someone in the jail, switching from one cell to another in the “real world” (for instance, get inside a new room in the “real world”) will sometimes make the person in the jail disappear from the Void. - No idea how to solve this issue. Think it might be associated with leveled creatures respawning, since for Phinis Gestor and the librarian of the Winterhold College, for example, they stayed in the jail. Also, tried with creatures that I placed that weren’t supposed to level with the player and they also stayed.\r<br />\r<br />- Sometimes, dead enemies that you try to teleport back to the real world will simply disappear. From what I figured out, they don’t disappear, but simply aren’t put directly on the place where they were supposed to be. They are placed somewhere around it. Anyway, loot them before sending them to the real world&#33; :)\r<br />\r<br />- Teleport scripts are always prone to bugs. I did my best to minimize all possible bugs, but they may occur. If they do, loading the game should fix it. If not, quit the game, start it, and load the game. If for some reason, when teleporting yourself to the Void, you are bugged, don’t worry, since you and your follower will be teleported to Whiterun (default position that Darkfirebird used and I decided to choose it as well).\r<br />\r<br />- Both Endon and Enthir are the reference for the teleport (that is, you teleport to the person itself, not a marker on the map), so weird stuff may happen when teleporting to them (with me, nothing actually happened, but just leaving you the warning :) ). What happened to me was getting teleported to Enthir room and he isn’t there, because he is on the bench near the stairs (this is the way of the teleport to protect you from getting into an awkward position ;) )\r<br />=====================================================================\r<br />[b]6.
