  "summary": "I made Braithwen for myself initially because I have always liked the look of LOTR Wood Elves and wanted a nice looking Wood Elf for a companion. She is sandboxed at the Nightgate Inn and is a Ranger type character with a few magic spells added. Calculated and Auto-level versions, Blonde/Grey or Auburn Hair.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Braithwen Fernleaf -Wood Elf Companion-\r\n\r\n05/18/12 Update: Added version that should default to bow and her primary attack/defense will be with a bow using csWEAssassinMissile/Combat Scout for her combat mechanics. \r\n\r\nUpdate!: Auto-Level File: While looking at the hair on my follower in-game I noticed that the adjustments I made to her hair in the Calculated Version 1.0 did not make it to the Auto-Level file causing her hair to clip through her ear. This should be fixed now. The newer Auto-Level File is 1.0c so make sure you delete the old one completely before you install the newer one. 04/27/12\r\n\r\nShe is located in the Winterhold Hold at the Nightgate Inn where she is sandboxed and will return when dismissed. She is available as a Calculated Level 35 or Auto-Leveled (your choice) Combat Ranger that should advance to level 100 with the player. Her perks are geared towards archery and hunting with a little bit of stealth thrown in. I also gave her just a couple spells like healing, oakflesh and raise corpse just to make her a little more fun. \r\n\r\nTribute: This is more a tribute to the Wood Elves from Lord of The Rings. I dislike the \\\"Roswell Alien\\\" look of Bethesda\\'s elves in general and am on a mission to change every elf in my game. \r\n\r\n*** Indicates a required mod \r\n\r\n***Make sure you have the NEWEST version of ApachiiSkyHair! ApachiiSkyHair_v_1_2!*** \r\n\r\nShe is equipped with two Iron Daggers and no clothes. \r\nShe is approximately 5\\'6\\\" and 120 pounds.\r\nShe is essential or non-essential and can be married\r\nCustom hair, skin and makeup \\\"coloring\\\" by me.***I had to adjust this particular Apachii Hairstyle many many times so that seams and hair clipping through her ears weren\\'t an issue. :-P\r\nVoice: Sultry \r\nFor Braithwen to appear as she does in my images use the following mods;\r\nBella\\'s Better Faces with Makeup version 1:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\nHuman eyes for Elves by Porcelyn\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/195\r\nCBBEv3 with Navetseas CBBEv3 body texture (feminine arms and toned abs).
