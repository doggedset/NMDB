  "descriptionHtml": "WHAT IT IS: \r\n\r\nThis mod adds a short nordic dungeon named Havalden\\'s Abode to Skyrim. This was made long before I made Gravkammir, I just recently decided to upload it:) This was my first mod and it was designed while following the Creation Kit Tutorial series by Bethesda on YouTube. Havalden\\'s Abode is much shorter and less complex than Gravkammir, but hopefully you\\'ll all still enjoy it:) \r\n\r\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND IT: \r\n\r\n-Havalden\\'s Abode is not far to the southwest of Falkreath, just up the mountain path. See the screenshot above for the exact location. \r\n\r\n\r\nAny feedback is welcome and would be much appreciated! Let me know if you find any issues and I\\'ll do my best to fix them. \r\n\r\nNO DLC REQUIRED \r\n\r\nPlease endorse if you enjoy! \r\n\r\nMY MODS: \r\n\r\n-Havalden\\'s Abode \r\n-Gravkammir",
