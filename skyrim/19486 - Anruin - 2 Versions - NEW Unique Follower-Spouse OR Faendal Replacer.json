  "summary": "Adds new, unique Wood Elf follower/spouse to Skyrim or replaces vanilla follower Faendal.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#00CC66]******[b][u]ATTENTION![/u][/b][/color] This mod has been updated! Please read update instructions carefully if you were using the first version!![color=#00CC66]******[/color]\r\n[IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p215/faeriexxdecay/header1standalone.png[/IMG][/center]\r\nAnruin, a handsome Bosmer male, has come to Skyrim looking to aid you, the Dragonborn, on your adventures through the cold and harshness of the land.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds Anruin, a formidable destruction mage that comes fully loaded with lightning and fire spells as well as many beneficial perks, eager to aid you in battle or become your loving spouse. There are [color=#00CC66]two versions[/color] of this unique follower.\r\n\r\n[center][color=#00CC66][b]ONLY CHOOSE ONE OF THESE.[/b][/color][/center]\r\n[b]In version 1[/b], Anruin will come set with a default mage outfit, meaning he will [color=#00CC66]never be naked[/color]. You can give him any armor you choose and he should switch to that armor, but if you remove all the armor from his inventory, he will default back to his mage outfit.\r\n\r\n[b]In version 2[/b], Anruin will [color=#00CC66]NOT[/color] have a default outfit and will thus probably be undressed the first time you see him. He comes with robes in his inventory, but you will need to access his inventory and remove/add from it to force him to equip something. This way, he will wear whatever you give him, but it is also possible to completely undress him for whatever reason. Unless you have body replacers installed, Anruin will just be in his underwear when you first meet. :)\r\n\r\nAnruin New Follower Features:\r\nAvailable as a follower AND can be married.\r\nEssential combat mage with extra health, magicka, and stamina.\r\nLightning and fire spells, self-healing and self-shielding abilities.\r\nWon\\'t mind if you commit crimes.\r\nDestruction and sneaking perks.\r\nHigh stealth - should not trigger pressure plates.\r\nFind him at [color=#00CC66]The Bannered Mare in Whiterun[/color].\r\nStarting level 10, max level possible 99 - should level with you.\r\n[color=#00CC66][b]NOTE:[/b][/color] This new follower is scripted to return to the inn if you dismiss him. I find this a convenient option that helps make it less likely to lose your follower. He does not have his own home (that\\'s the inn!), so it is recommended to tell him to move in with you when you marry!\r\n\r\n\r\n[center]---------------------------------[/center]\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p215/faeriexxdecay/header2replacer.png[/IMG][/center]\r\nThis option will change the vanilla follower Faendal\\'s physical features to match Anruin and also adds a few improvements without changing too much of how he works in vanilla. If you already use Faendal or would rather have an archer follower instead of a mage, this option is for you!\r\n\r\nChanges made to Faendal:\r\nSet to be essential.\r\nAdded Potential Marriage Faction.\r\nMax level raised to 99.\r\nMood changed to neutral.\r\nWill no longer care if you commit crimes.\r\nAdded Perks: Stealth, Silence, Ranger, Overdraw, Muffled Movement, Light Foot\r\nWon\\'t trigger pressure plates.\r\nHeight increased to 1.05.\r\nEntire appearance changed to resemble Anruin.\r\nFind Faendal in [color=#00CC66]Riverwood[/color] - you must complete his quest before he will join you.\r\n\r\n[color=#00CC66][b]NEW INSTALL[/b][/color]\r\nFor ease of use, download and install using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/modmanager]Nexus Mod Manager[/url].\r\nFor manual install, simply extract the contents of the archive into your Data folder.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6]BOSS[/url] is recommended for proper mod sorting!\r\n[color=#00CC66][b]This mod is FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH UFO![/b] Simply load my plugin AFTER UFO.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#00CC66][b]UPDATE[/b][/color]\r\n[b][u]ATTENTION![/b][/u] The old plugins for this mod were created in NPC Editor, which has since become outdated and is probably no longer safe to use. I have been advised to recreate my followers using the CK for better compatibility with Skyrim\\'s recent updates. Because of this, you will be required to make a clean save before upgrading to the new CK version. Please read these instructions carefully!\r\n1) Make sure to remove all important items from your follower - otherwise, the items will be deleted from the game. Dismiss your follower now - I recommend doing this close to where their \\\"home\\\" is - in this case it\\'s The Bannered Mare - just to make sure he gets home quickly. I also recommend going into a different interior somewhere where you follower is NOT and making a save there.\r\n2) Now you can safely exit the game and disable the old plugins.\r\n3) Reload the last save you just made and ignore the message about missing data - this is expected since you just uninstalled the old version of your follower. Now once you\\'re loaded back into Skyrim, you can make a new save in a new slot - this is your clean save.\r\n4) Now reinstall v2 of whichever plugin you use. You can then load up that clean save you just made and go back to and re-recruit your follower!\r\n\r\n[color=#00CC66]Anruin\\'s Look[/color]\r\nIf you want Anruin to look like the screenshots, please take a look at these wonderful mods!\r\nAlso keep in mind that Anruin should work with ANY texture replacers, these are just recommendations.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488]Better Males[/url] - Younger Geonox Faces Without Beard + FavoredSoul Meshes\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4141]High Res Face Maps for Men by Geonox[/url] - Original version of the amazing facial textures by Geonox, minus the other stuff from Better Males. I prefer the Younger Without Beard version from Better Males, but this is also fantastic and, of course, is the original!\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/498]High Quality Eyes Darker & Desaturated[/url] - I use the elf and orc eyes from this mod. Amazing detail that retains the feel of vanilla.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589]Natural Eyes[/url] - If you do not like the \\\"alien\\\" look of the vanilla elf eyes, this is another option. I personally use the human eyes only from this mod; they are wonderful too.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4307]AOF Believable Hair[/url] - Retexture of the vanilla Skyrim hairs.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11371]83Willow\\'s Whiter Teeth[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4489]Weathered Warpaint and Improved Dirt[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10277]Spellweaver Outfit[/url] - From the Omegared99 - Armor Compilation.\r\n\r\nPlease also take a look at [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15386]Fimbulvinter ENB[/url], which is the ENB setting used for the screenshots. Great balance of beauty and performance.\r\n\r\n[center][color=#00CC66][b]Your downloads, comments, endorsements, and screenshots mean so much! I welcome any constructive feedback you have as well.\r\nLet me know what I can improve or fix! Enjoy![/b][/color]\r\n[IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p215/faeriexxdecay/header0top.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n[center]---------------------------------[/center]\r\n[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20082][IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p215/faeriexxdecay/vahrenlink.png[/IMG][/url]\r\nPlease check out my other followers on [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1159455]my profile[/url]![/center]",
