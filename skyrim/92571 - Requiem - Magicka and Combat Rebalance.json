Some of the mechanics like [color=#ffe599]Alchemy[/color] (which I've attempted to remedy with[b] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86504]R-AR[/url][/b]), [color=#ffe599]Aedric Blessings[/color] (which I've attempted to remedy with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90691]R-IDB[/url]), and [size=3][color=#ffe599]Magic[/color][/size] got the broad strokes right, but weren't fine tuned before Xarrian moved on from [b]Requiem[/b] modding. Ogerboss and the [b]Requiem[/b] team have made great strides in fine tuning [color=#ffe599]Illusion Magic[/color][b], [/b]giving it a basis of progression and some difficulty to wield before a PC is significantly developed. [b]Requiem[/b] schools of magic in general though require a PC to self limit themselves to keep from making the game boringly easy by the time they develop mid-level skills. The power of most base [b][size=3]Requiem[/size][/b] magic makes it a bypass for most of the game content, as it removes a sense of need for most equipment or skill to roflstomp nearly any challenge, leaving little incentive to participate in most quests. \n<br />\n<br />[b]Requiem[/b] got the power of magic right though, and it's a significant improvement from vanilla Skyrim. In-game magic should be that powerful. That great power combined with its lack of barriers to wield [size=3]though[/size] leaves it broken. [color=#ea9999][size=3][size=3][b]R-MER[/b][/size][/size][/color] primarily attempts to fix this discrepancy in two ways (though there are a few other small changes to some spells).\n<br />[/size][/font][list]\n<br />[*][font=Georgia][size=3]First, [font=Georgia][size=3][color=#ea9999][size=3][size=3][b]R-MER[/b][/size][/size][/color][/size][/font] increases [color=#ffe599]Magicka[/color] costs for many spells to give more PC feedback that something powerful is actually occurring, to reduce the ease for a PC to spam higher level spells, and to create a barrier to access for PCs without much [color=#ffe599]Magicka[/color]. This gives more of a sense of progression and accomplishment in spell casting. [/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Georgia][size=3]Secondly, [font=Georgia][size=3][color=#ea9999][size=3][size=3][b]R-MER[/b][/size][/size][/color][/size][/font] increases the casting time for many spells, making it so that magic wielding PCs need to actually use strategy in their combat. For instance, destruction PCs can no longer roleplay as semi-automatic fireball launchers. Wielding magic of that magnitude should take a moment of concentration to accomplish.[/size][/font]\n<br />[/list][font=Georgia]\n<br />[size=3]These two simple changes integrate magic use back into the context of the greater game world. [color=#ffe599]Magicka[/color] potions and spell school cost reduction potions actually matter. Enchantments to reduce spell cost actually matter. Investing in other skills and equipment to help a magic wielding PC through their quests actually matters. Magic use is not longer a bypass from other skills and game content, and is now part of the incentive to participate in the greater game world.\n<br />\n<br />Below is a more in-depth look at changes to [font=Georgia][size=3][font=Georgia][size=3][color=#ea9999][size=3][size=3][b]R-MER[/b][/size][/size][/color][/size][/font][/size][/font]:\n<br />\n<br />Alteration\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/font][list]\n<br />[*][size=3][font=Georgia]Base [color=#ffe599]Mage Armor[/color] spells last for 240 seconds per cast (up from 60 seconds per cast in base [b]Requiem[/b]), which allows them to last over an hour per cast after the improved mage armor perk is acquired.[/font][/size]\n<br />[/list][font=Georgia][size=3]\n<br />Conjuration\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Destruction\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][size=3]Illusion[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Restoration\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/font]R[/b][b]equiem - Magic and Enchantment Rebalance (R-MER[/b]) modifies magic spell costs and casting durations -as wellas some enchantment strengths- [/size][/size][size=3]with a design focus of changing the least amount necessary from base [b]Requiem[/b] to achieve balance and improve immersion.[/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />When Xarrian created [size=3] [size=3][size=3][b][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19281]Requiem - The Oldschool Roleplaying Overhaul[/url][/b][/size][/size][/size], their creative genius fixed a lot of what [b]Skyrim[/b] needed to feel like a finished game world.
