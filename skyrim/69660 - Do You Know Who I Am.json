Assuming that you are, in fact, Dragonborn.[/size][/color]\n<br /> \n<br />[color=#3c78d8][size=4][u]DESCRIPTION:[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />   This mod alters several NPCs (More to come! Stay tuned!) who think they're somehow better or more important than the savior of the world.\n<br />It adds that six-word question to their dialogs, allowing you to bypass or complete their particular sections of those quests without violence. Other NPCs have unique dialog for noticing that you're Dragonborn.\n<br />   This does not add, nor do I plan to add, any ability for bandits or other always-hostile beings to recognize your greatness. That's something for another mod, if at all.\n<br />   I made this mostly because I got irritated playing the College of Winterhold quest \"The Staff of Magnus\" and running into Estormo, who somehow believes that he can kill you, even though you just plowed through a dungeon full of undead horrors and magical monstrosities that he couldn't have begun to scratch at. A friend then suggested the radiant thieves, and this mod was born.\n<br />   I'll add in some more NPCs as I find them, or as people suggest them.\n<br />   Don't expect anyone to recognize your awesome power if you haven't been formally recognized as Dragonborn, and don't expect anyone to stand in awe of your combat prowess if you haven't killed Alduin.\n<br />This mod is UNVOICED, using Fuz Ro D-oh.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]theDeModcracy made a video showing this mod off.

It currently affects the following NPCs:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />--Estormo (The Staff of Magnus)\n<br />--The Caller (Hitting the Books)\n<br />--Tolfdir (Rejoining the College)\n<br />--Calcelmo (Hard Answers) [thanks to mybrainhurts]\n<br />--Farengar (Salt for Arcadia)\n<br />--Nepos the Nose (The Forsworn Conspiracy) [thanks to The Matrix Prime]\n<br />--Degaine (Begging, and The Heart of Dibella) [thanks to BIZZY BONE]\n<br />--Aela (Take Up Arms) [thanks to thermius]\n<br />--Radiant thieves (Wilderness encounter) [thanks to jordisslave and thermius]\n<br />--Brawlers (Fight!

This mod alters a [i]lot[/i] of vanilla dialogue, so conflicts are almost certain to happen if anything else modifies those topics\n<br />   Things that alter the NPCs themselves (like their physical appearance) should be fine.\n<br />   Note that the entries for Nepos the Nose, Riften Gate Guards, Magrol, and the Valtheim Towers bandit edit vanilla scripts... hopefully I didn't break anything.\n<br />   NOTE: This will OVERWRITE those scripts! If other mods, the USKP for example, edit those (and IIRC it does), this will revert the fixes. Sorry, it was the only way I knew how at the time to do it!\n<br />   You can remove those scripts before you put the mod in your data directory, and it *should* work fine, it's just those three things that won't be updated.\n<br />   This mod is technically incompatible with Birds of Skyrim. That is, the mods will work together just fine, but after defeating Alduin, some birds may speak to the player from time to time. It's probably incompatible with any other mods that add in NPCs that are technically playable races.\n<br /> \n<br />[color=#3c78d8][size=4][u]UNINSTALLING:[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />   Remove \"Do You Know Who I Am.esp\" from your data directory, and all scripts starting with \"dyk_\" from your scripts folder. You'll also need to remove the following three scripts: \n<br />QF_dunValtheimKeepQST_000ADFE7.pex\n<br />QF_MS01_00018B4B.pex\n<br />QF_DialogueRiftenGateGuards_000E66FC.pex\n<br />DLC2_QF_DLC2TT1b_0201844E\n<br />\n<br />[color=#3c78d8][size=4][u]TO-DO LIST:[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />There's actually quite a sizeable list of NPCs to add. I'll get to it, I swear! As soon as I get some free time.\n<br />Mercer Frey, Arnbjorn, Irileth, Frodnar, Guards, Drunks, Graybeards, Master Neloth, Bendt, Yamarz, Froki Whetted-Blade, Skald, Siddgeir, Sibbi, Louis, pretty much the entire population of Riften, Endarie, Magrol, Delphine, Arvel, Deeja, Vantus Loreius, Miraak, Harkon, Lydia, Wuunfurth\n<br />Add in stuff for other factions too, not just if you're the Dragonborn - there's already some of that in the mod, but I do need to expand it. For example, Farengar should be impressed not just at the Dragonborn, but at the Archmage too.\n<br />Note that not all NPCs are going to be impressed... for example, I'll add Master Neloth to the mod eventually, but his personality is that of a man who just wouldn't care one whit about whether or not you're Dragonborn, or Harbinger, or Archmage, etcetera.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#3c78d8][size=4][u]FAQ:[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />Generally \"FAQ\" requires questions to be asked frequently. In this case, I'm trying to anticipate questions instead.\n<br /> \n<br />Q: I'm having a problem with this mod.\n<br />A: That's not only possible, it's likely. I'm a newb to modding. Leave a comment in the comments and I'll get back to you. I can't guarantee I can fix a problem, but I'll do my best. :)\n<br /> \n<br />Q: I have a question about this or any other mod. Should I PM you?\n<br />A: No, please. Use the comment thread. That's what it is there for.\n<br /> \n<br />Q: Your mod conflicts with &lt;other mod&gt;.\n<br />A: That's also highly likely. There's a good chance one of the NPC dialogue nodes I've edited is being referenced by any other dialogue-style mod. In general, for stuff like this, put whichever one you want more lower on the list.\n<br /> \n<br />Q: Can I suggest &lt;feature&gt; or &lt;NPC&gt;?\n<br />A: Yes please! I can't guarantee the request will get into the mod, because as I've said I'm not very good at modding, but I'll certainly consider it!\n<br /> \n<br />Q: Can I translate your mod?\n<br />A: Certainly! I didn't write it with any sort of translation in mind, though, and I do tend to use American English idioms and phrasing, so... good luck! Go ahead and post your translation in the support thread and I will link to it in the download page. If you do make a translation, be a lamb and either send me the file so I can upload it, or at least post a link so I can add it to the description.\n<br /> \n<br />Q: Can I or you upload this to another site?\n<br />A: I'd rather you didn't.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Can I make or upload patches?\n<br />A: I'd rather you didn't. If you find a bug, tell me about it!",
