  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION\r\nDo you want the most out of your jewelry in Skyrim, but don\\'t want to make it completely illogical to smith them? This mod will remedy your think-box by making jewelry smithing in skyrim actually make sense. \r\n\r\nThis mod: \r\n-Balances crafting weight issues to make sense. \r\n-Making jewelry is a little bit more complex for the sake of logic. Now you have to craft the base necklace or ring before using the gems to make the better jewelry. \r\n\r\n\r\n\\\"But Clark, the rings weigh 0.3 pounds, kilograms, squared elephants, or whatever Skyrim uses as a measurement of weight! How does it make sense that I make 4 rings from a 1 [insert weight measurement] gold or silver ingot?\\\" \r\n\r\n\r\nWell, Bethesda\\'s User Interface for Skyrim simplifies numbers so that you only see the tenth decimal place, and round up. Rings actually weigh .25 thingies. \r\n\r\n[INCOMING MATHS. AVOID IF YOU DON\\'T WANT TO KNOW THE MATH EXPLANATION] \r\n\r\nIn fact, you can even do the math in-game using twenty rings. Drop the rings, and record the difference in weight once you pick them up again. \r\n\r\nHere\\'s your formula to solve. [20rings*X=Y] X= The actual weight of the rings(what you\\'re finding!), Y= The total weight difference when you add 20 rings into your inventory. \r\n\r\nUse algebra to solve for X. \r\n\r\n(SPOILER: you\\'ll get a 5 weight difference, [20rings*Xweight=5total_weight]. 5total_weight/20rings= 0.25weight. \r\n\r\nIf rings actually weighed 0.3, the equation would be this: [20rings*0.3weight=6], and the total weight would be 6 instead of 5) \r\n\r\nGod I sound like a math teacher :/ \r\n\r\n[OUTCOMING MATHS.] \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any issues. \r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY: \r\n\r\nThis mod modifies the recipes for jewelry at forges, so anything that modifies those recipes would be considered \\\"incompatible\\\". \r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGE LOG: \r\n\r\n1.0: The base mod.",
