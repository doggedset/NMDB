  "descriptionHtml": "I love ice spells especially Icy Spear. Pelting people with it is fun. Bummer though when people who resist frost seems to brush off that large icicle in their face like it was nothing. Not anymore.\r<br />\r<br />Ice Spike\r<br />-Deal 12.5 of Physical damage.\r<br />\r<br />Ice Spear\r<br />-Deal 30 of Physical damage.\r<br />\r<br />Both\r<br />-Damage scales if you have mods that do that.\r<br />-Armor resists the damage. \r<br />-The damage values are actually half of the vanilla spell damage.\r<br />\r<br />Gameplay\r<br />-Enemy spells also have it. If you don&#39;t want enemies to have that, just delete the other three using Tes5Edit.\r<br />-Wards can still deflect against it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please use TES5Edit to check conflicts since it makes changes to 5 spells.\r<br />If you want to test it, just conjure a Frost Atronach and hit it with the spell. If the Atronach recieves damage then it works.\r<br />There is actually a magic effect that deals generic damage but nothing resists it.\r<br />\r<br />Just take note by the way.\r<br />[size=4]This makes Ice spells more powerful since it deals Magic Damage + Physical Damage.\r<br />But why not? Frost are the least damaging than the other two because tons of enemies resist it.\r<br />Fire deals damage over time with less people resist it and Shock deals a much better damage and *ZAP* hits instantly. \r<br />\r<br />[/size]And hey&#33; Wards aren&#39;t useless.",
