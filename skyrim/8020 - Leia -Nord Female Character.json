  "descriptionHtml": "So yeah...this is my first time releasing anything on Nexus. Yeah it\\'s only a save, I\\'m not that great of a modder or anything so don\\'t expect anything amazing ><.\r\n\r\nAnyways, this is a character I just made randomly out of boredom and such.\r\n\r\nThe character is going to start at the Sleeping Giant Inn. It has certain armor that it really shouldn\\'t have at this point but you can just get rid of it since I forgot to <_<.\r\n\r\nAlso, don\\'t question the name of my character. I suck at coming up with names so I just used the first name that came up to my head. If you want to change it feel free to change it >_>.\r\n\r\n==================================================================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nFirst thing: I did NOT make this character for realism. So leave behind your criticism of it being too \\\"fake\\\" or \\\"not real\\\" cause I could actually care less for I wasn\\'t even aiming for realism. This character was made to have that \\\"Cute\\\" or whatever you wanna call it, look.\r\n\r\nSecond thing: You will need to install a list of mods to actually achieve this look in the first place. The mods needed are:\r\n\r\nOriental beauty Women and Man mod by Radioragae:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6953 \r\n(Make sure you choose the right one for whatever body mod you may be using)\r\n\r\nThis hair pack: \r\nhttp://dynvar.com/skyrim/Beautiful_Hair_v.1.3.7z \r\n(Credits go to original author who I don\\'t know who they are.)\r\n\r\nExtended Slider Colors by Expired: \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6923\r\n(Just download whichever language you use or the FOMOD, either one works.)\r\n\r\n==================================================================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nFor the hair pack you will need to follow these instructions in order to install them, (It\\'s basically the same way you would install any mod in it\\'s rightful folder.)\r\n\r\nFirst you need to extract the file called, \\\"Beautiful_Hair_v.1.3.7z.\\\"\r\nThen navigate into the folders which should have a folder called \\\"Beautiful Hair (kanji characters) v.1.3\\\"\r\nYou should come across a \\\"Data\\\" folder which you would then proceed to drop at the root of the Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\nAs for the other mods, they\\'re basically the same process, even easier if you\\'re using NMM. \r\n\r\n==================================================================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nYou can have any additional mods to the save as long as they don\\'t include replacing any of the textures/meshes of the faces,hairs, or eyes.\r\n\r\n==================================================================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nCredits go to each of the mods I used rightful owner, and to Bethesda for the game.
