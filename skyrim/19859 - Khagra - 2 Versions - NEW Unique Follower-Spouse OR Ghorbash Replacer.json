  "summary": "Adds new, unique Orc follower/spouse to Skyrim or replaces vanilla follower Ghorbash the Iron Hand.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p215/faeriexxdecay/khagraheader1.png[/IMG][/center]\r\nKhagra gro-Urzog, an Orsimer male, has left his failing stronghold Narzulbur and traveled south to Riften, hoping to find adventure and challenge with you, the Dragonborn.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds Khagra, an orc who used to be a guard and brings those skills with him. He comes with a sword and shield, which he prefers, as well as iron arrows and an enchanted bow. What\\'s special about him is that his sword is made of enchanted ebony, pulled from the mines of Narzulbur; he is very proud of this. He also comes with appropriate perks, ready to aid you in battle or become your protective spouse. There are [color=#009900]two versions[/color] of this unique follower.\r\n\r\n[center][color=#009900][b]ONLY CHOOSE ONE OF THESE.[/b][/color][/center]\r\n[b]In version 1[/b], Khagra will come set with a default iron armor outfit, meaning he will [color=#009900]never be naked[/color]. You can give him any armor you choose and he should switch to that armor, but if you remove all the armor from his inventory, he will default back to the iron outfit.\r\n\r\n[b]In version 2[/b], Khagra will [color=#009900]NOT[/color] have a default outfit and will thus probably be undressed the first time you see him. He comes with a set of iron armor in his inventory, but you will need to access his inventory and remove/add from it to force him to equip something. This way, he will wear whatever you give him, but it is also possible to completely undress him for whatever reason. Unless you have body replacers installed, Khagra will just be in his underwear when you first meat. Er, I mean meet! :)\r\n\r\nKhagra New Follower Features:\r\nAvailable as a follower AND can be married.\r\nIncreased speed, set as essential, 1-handed guard warrior with extra health and stamina.\r\nAppropriate 1-handed and blocking perks.\r\nFind him at [color=#009900]The Bee & Barb in Riften[/color].\r\nStarting level 10, max level possible 99.\r\n[color=#009900][b]NOTE:[/b][/color] This new follower is scripted to return to the inn if you dismiss him. I find this a convenient option that helps make it less likely to lose your follower. He does not have his own home (that\\'s the inn!), so it is recommended to tell him to move in with you when you marry!\r\n\r\n[center]---------------------------------[/center]\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p215/faeriexxdecay/khagraheader2.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\nThis option will change the vanilla follower Ghorbash the Iron Hand\\'s physical features to match Khagra and also adds a few improvements without changing too much of how he works in vanilla. If you already use Ghorbash or prefer an orc ranger to a predominantly melee orc, this option is for you!\r\n\r\nChanges made to Ghorbash:\r\nSpeed increased to 125.\r\nSet to be essential.\r\nAdded Perks: Armsman, Hack & Slash, Savage Strike, Fighting Stance, Agile Defender, Overdraw, Critical Shot, Ranger, Quick Shot, Shield Wall, Block Runner, Shield Charge\r\nEntire appearance changed to resemble Khagra.\r\nFind Ghorbash at the [color=#009900]Dushnikh Yal stronghold southeast of Markarth[/color].\r\n[b]You must convince Ghorbash to follow you first before he can be married. This can be done by persuading, brawling, or giving him gold.[/b]\r\n[color=#009900]Note[/color]: Even though he wears steel armor and wields an axe, his best skills are actually archery and light armor; he is an archer! I have given him perks to reflect this as well as 1-handed and block. [color=#009900]Try giving him a bow![/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#009900][b]INSTALL[/b][/color]\r\nFor ease of use, download and install using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/modmanager]Nexus Mod Manager[/url].\r\nFor manual install, simply extract the contents of the archive into your Data folder.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6]BOSS[/url] is recommended for proper mod sorting!\r\n[color=#009900][b]This mod is FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH UFO![/b] Simply load my plugin AFTER UFO.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#009900]Khagra\\'s Look[/color]\r\nIf you want Khagra to look like the screenshots, please take a look at these wonderful mods!\r\nAlso keep in mind that Khagra should work with ANY texture replacers, these are just recommendations.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488]Better Males[/url] - Younger Geonox Faces Without Beard + FavoredSoul Meshes\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4141]High Res Face Maps for Men by Geonox[/url] - Original version of the amazing facial textures by Geonox, minus the other stuff from Better Males. I prefer the Younger Without Beard version from Better Males, but this is also fantastic and, of course, is the original!\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/498]High Quality Eyes Darker & Desaturated[/url] - I use the elf and orc eyes from this mod. Amazing detail that retains the feel of vanilla.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589]Natural Eyes[/url] - If you do not like the vanilla orc eyes, this is another option. I personally use the human eyes only from this mod; they are wonderful too.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4307]AOF Believable Hair[/url] - Retexture of the vanilla Skyrim hairs.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11371]83Willow\\'s Whiter Teeth[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4489]Weathered Warpaint and Improved Dirt[/url]\r\n\r\nPlease also take a look at [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19748]SYNERGY ENB[/url], which is the ENB setting used for the screenshots. Absolutely incredible!\r\n\r\n[color=#009900][b]SPECIAL THANKS[/b][/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/938388]83Willow[/url] for her kindness, advice, and inspirational/beautiful mods and screenshots.
