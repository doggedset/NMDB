  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af173/mod_Naturlich/Title.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSanctuary Base is the Dark Brotherhoods response to near annihilation by the Imperials, no longer can they afford to have a single Sanctuary and the risk that brings, it\\'s time to spread out, and re-arm!  Sanctuary Base is the first step on that path.  An almost completely self contained base of operations that can supply everything their assassins and The Listener needs.\r\n\r\nShould you not be in the Brotherhood, don\\'t worry, the main wing is set aside with a separate hidden entrance, and so long as you don\\'t go and bother them, they wont bother you (well, so far anyway lol)  There\\'s room for a sizable entourage with display cases mannequins chests and beds for around 17 followers, but the trainers, vendors and smithy are for the Brotherhood, so don\\'t go through the door at the end of the room, they don\\'t like that.\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n\r\nSanctury Base is located close to Hunters Rest.\r\nThe entrance to Dovahkiin\\'s area is close Moss Mother Cavern, both are well hidden.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nHearthfire DLC\r\nPatch 1.9.32\r\n\r\nI also used\r\nApachii Hair\r\nLovely Hairstyles\r\nMy Home is Your Home\r\nAmazing Follower Tweaks\r\n\r\n**I\\'m assuming that if you\\'re looking for a place to house a number of followers that you already have a mod that allows you to tell followers that this is their new home, if you don\\'t already have a mod to do this there are a number on Nexus like My Home is Your Home, which I use myself http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18045\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n1. Grey Face bug!  I\\'ve tried exporting the textures, but they get corrupted every time, if anyone would like to try and export them on their side for me, I\\'ve be grateful!\r\n\r\n2.  Duncan Idaho should be a trainer, he\\'s on the fix list still\r\n\r\nIf you find any other issues please let me know and I\\'ll do my best to fix it, likewise if you have any general comments feel free to pass them on in the comments :)\r\n\r\nThanks:\r\nzn00p for Lovely Hairstyles\r\napachii for Skyhair\r\nBoth are amazing :)\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\nVersion 1.5 - Large update, my recommended update procedure is below.\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Orientation of Smithing area and Dovahkiin area changed to remove long lines of site (optimisation)\r\n2. Lighting changed and further optimised\r\n3. Extra guards added\r\n4. Brotherhood Guard armor added (can only be purchased from Brotherhood Smithy, 1 set is loose within the Sanctuary)\r\n5. Sleeping quarters added for extra NPC\\'s\r\n6. 3 possible marriage/followers added\r\n7. NPC daily routines cleaned up some.\r\n8.  Training room has brotherhood members working out, Duncan still wont train you though! (aargh)\r\n\r\n***Update method from version 1 to 1.5***\r\nThis is the best method I\\'ve found to ensure there are no problems after the rooms have been moved from version 1:\r\n1. Gather the followers and equipment you have in the base and move to another location.\r\n2. Save the game at the new location and close Skyrim\r\n3. Disable Sanctuary Base mod\r\n4. Start Skyrim and Load the save game, it will inform you that content is missing\r\n5. Make a new save now without the mod loaded\r\n6. Close Skyrim, update Sanctuary Base, activate the mod and restart Skyrim, you\\'re done, move back in.\r\n\r\n\r\nImages:\r\n\r\nTopographical:\r\n[IMG]http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af173/mod_Naturlich/SanctuaryBaseLayout.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nMain wing for Dovahkiin/Listener\r\n[IMG]http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af173/mod_Naturlich/1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af173/mod_Naturlich/2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBrotherhood Dining Area\r\n[IMG]http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af173/mod_Naturlich/3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBrotherhood central chamber\r\n[IMG]http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af173/mod_Naturlich/4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBrotherhood Smithy\r\n[IMG]http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af173/mod_Naturlich/5.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n",
