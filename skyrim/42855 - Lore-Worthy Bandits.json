  "modName": "Lore-Worthy Bandits",
  "summary": "Makes low-level bandits wear clothing; increases armor randomization for all bandits; race-specific equipment for bandits.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I never liked the fact that all bandits looked pretty much the same--even the rank amateurs. This mod changes that by making the lowest level bandits wear normal clothing (generally with armored gloves, boots, etc.) to demonstrate that they haven&#39;t been in their outlaw lifestyle for very long (and aren&#39;t very good at it yet).\r<br />\r<br />Also, bandits of all levels can now get some race-specific gear, indicating that they are rejects or deserters from some more disciplined organization or lifestyle. The possible race-specific combinations are as follows:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][b]Bretons:[/b] Forsworn armor/Forsworn weapons\r<br />[*][b]Dark Elves:[/b] chitin armor/bonemold armor (bosses only)\r<br />[*][b]Imperials:[/b] medium Legion armor/heavy Legion armor (bosses only)/Legion swords/favor blunt weapons\r<br />[*][b]Nords:[/b] ancient Nordic armor (bosses only)/favor swords or axes\r<br />[*][b]Orcs:[/b] Orcish armor (bosses only)/favor axes and blunt weapons\r<br />[*][b]Redguard:[/b] Alik&#39;r hood/Hammerfell garb/scimitars\r<br />[*][b]Wood Elves:[/b] Elven armor\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Additionally, bandit armors are more randomized than before, so bandits will now wear more diverse armor sets to better demonstrate their rag-tag, &#34;wear what you steal&#34; lifestyle (in the vanilla game, bandit armors are randomized but are heavily weighted to higher level gear, so you end up with bandit bosses that always wear steel plate at mid-levels and carved Nordic armor at high levels). [b][i]As of version 1.1, this mod also adds an un-enchanted version of the Champion&#39;s Cudgel to bandit leveled lists.[/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Note that this mod makes extensive changes to bandit leveled lists, so any mod that modifies bandit equipment will likely be incompatible. This mod  [i]is[/i] compatible with mods that modify ranged weapon leveled lists (which this mod does not touch; the crossbows in the screenshots are from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21666/?]Crossbows Revamped[/url]). It is also compatible with mods that use scripting to add equipment to bandits such as [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27563/?]Wet and Cold[/url] (with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13486/?]Winter Is Coming - Cloaks[/url]), which is also pictured in the screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][b]This mod requires the Dragonborn DLC be installed.[/b][/color]\r<br />[i](the Dragonborn DLC is needed to incorporate carved Nordic armor and the Champion&#39;s cudgel; this mod does not affect Solstheim reavers).[/i]\r<br />\r<br />My other mods:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26450/?]Lore-Worthy Nettlebane[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27385/?]Lore-Worthy Hagravens[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30503/?]Lore-Worthy Movarths Boots[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36797/?]Lore-Worthy Quartermasters[/url]",
