I think it uses the generic flames as a texture, but if someone could confirm it, that would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrEaTeD.......

Seriously, ever wonder what REALLY happens to steel when constantly heated... IN THE BLIZZARD RIDDEN MOUNTAINS?\r\nSince the never-ending barrage of snow won\\'t put those damn flying fire thingies out, I decided to make a simple texture replacer to make the flaming fire thingy of flames at least LOOK the part of being in the frigid highlands.\r\nAnd I don\\'t care if this is already out. If it is, and if you\\'re gonna make a big deal about it, just shut (your fingers) up right now and go download the other one, since it\\'s SOOOOOOOOO much more badass than mine.\r\n-=-=-\r\n\r\n-=-=-\r\nI\\'M TOO LAZY TO MAKE A NEXUS MOD MANAGER THINGY THINGY APPLE THINGY SO YOU MUST DO THIS MANUALLY, MUWAHAHAHAHAHA!
