  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple game tweak that increases the duration of all vanilla Bound Weapon spells to 1 hour (2 hours if dual cast). There should be no other impact on the spells.\r\n\r\nI created this mod for myself because I play an Assassin who uses Bound Weapons. I was sick of being detected while having to re-summon my weapons, and from losing assassination opportunities because my weapons disappeared.\r\n\r\nThough the mod is simple, I felt the subtle improvement to gameplay for conjured weapon users was worth sharing.\r\n\r\nPlease rate if you enjoy!\r\nI appreciate any feedback.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Jul 14, 2012 @ 8:24pm\r\n- Fixed Bound Bow. It will now have the correct duration.",
