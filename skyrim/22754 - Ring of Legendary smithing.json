  "descriptionHtml": "Hey all, its my first mod, and it\\'s very basic. I was looking for a ring like this here but couldn\\'t find one.\r\n\r\nWell, all it is, is a single ring called \\\"Gods Gift of Power and Protection.\\\" Its a normal ring that when equipped, give a 5000% boost to your upgrading of weaps and arms. I now have a iron bow that does around 300k dmg, so yeah, not lore friendly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour free to do whatever you like with this mod, no need to include me as the creator, as all I did was edit the power of the smithing ech on CK.",
