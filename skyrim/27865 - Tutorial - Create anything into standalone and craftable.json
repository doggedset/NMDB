  "descriptionHtml": "Its just a guide for people who want to learn easy with exactly steps.\n<br />\n<br />***I deleted the first uploaded file because i forgot to remove some wrong steps in the first part which was saying something to do like in video. \n<br />When i decided not to make a video tutorial but only a writen, i forgot to correct those steps.\n<br />Now the corrected file is up, those who have the previous file, please delete it and download the new one, i'm really sorry for my mistake, happy moding.***\n<br />\n<br />Sorry no video tutorial, my antivirus thinks that the program Fraps has a virus and it blocked the exe file, which this program can record anything and make screenshots.\n<br />\n<br />About the retexturing part of the guide, in case you don't know how to use Photoshop or Gimp to retexture a texture \"dds file\", sorry but i can't explain the whole Photoshop or Gimp program, you have to find a fine tutorial about those programs, writen or recored.\n<br />\n<br />About the Photoshop dds Plugins, if you already have installed photoshop, download and install this:\n<br />https://developer.nv...adobe-photoshop\n<br />If you have 32bit pc/windows then download then click on 32-bit, if you have 64bit then click on 64-bit, this will add the dds plugins to photoshop and then can open the textures.\n<br />\n<br />Good luck and have fun! ^^\n<br />\n<br />Permmisions:\n<br />1) Users are not allowed to edit and upload my file to other sites since i spent hours to use the programs carefully and write the steps of the tutorial!\n<br />2) Translations are allowed, no need to ask me.Â \n<br />[b][i][u]3) Users/Modders are not allowed to upload my mods on Steam Workshop as their own to obtain money, my mods will always stay on nexus for free!\n<br />[/u][/i][/b]\n<br />Credits:\n<br />Made by haldir307",
