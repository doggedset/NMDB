  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=limegreen][i]Remember to Endorse if you like this mod[/i][/color][/b]\r\n\r\nThis is another one of my personal mods, that I never thought I\\'d actually release. Constructive criticism is both welcome and encouraged though, if you have any ideas on how to better improve this mod, leave a comment.\r\n\r\n[b][size=4]=Description=[/size][/b]\r\nThis mod makes adjustments to female NPCs that the player is able to marry. I\\'ve attempted to make the these NPCs more attractive, while maintaining their original and unique look. The amount of work done on each NPC varies, depending on how much \\'attention\\' that person needed. Every potential female spouse in skyrim has be covered(to my knowledge), with the exception of two NPCs added by DLC, and that one Argonian...\r\n\r\nOther modifications such as inventory and outfit changes have been made to some of the NPCs. I have removed head items, such as cowls and hoods from a few of the NPCs. The priestesses of Dibella will still have their hoods on.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Affected NPCs[/b]\r\nAela the Huntress\r\nAeri\r\nAnwen\r\nAvrusa Sarethi\r\nBorgakh\r\nBrelyna Maryon\r\nCamilla Valerius\r\nDravynea the Stoneweaver\r\nGhorza gra-Bagol\r\nGilfre\r\nIona\r\nJenassa\r\nJordis the Sword-Maiden\r\nLydia\r\nMjoll the Lioness\r\nMuiri\r\nNjada Stonearm\r\nOrla\r\nRia\r\nSenna\r\nSylgja\r\nTaarie\r\nTemba Wide-Arm\r\nUthgerd the Unbroken\r\nViola Giordano\r\nYsolda\r\n\r\nMy apologies for the lack of quality screenshots, I\\'m having computer issues atm. Results may vary depending on which, if any, cosmetic mods you have installed. Chances are, they\\'ll look better on your pc than mine.\r\n\r\n[b]=Installation=[/b]\r\nDownload and install with NMM, or navigate to your Skyrim dictionary and simply drop the included Mesh and Texture folders, and the Esp file into your Data folder.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'ve installed the batch file, open your console with the \\\"~\\\" key, and type \\\"BAT spouse\\\", then press enter. It may take a while for every NPC to spawn. The batch file is best used in a large and empty interior cell. DO NOT SAVE YOUR GAME AFTER USING THIS\r\n\r\n[b]=Compatibility=[/b]\r\nThis mod is \\'lightweight\\', and shouldn\\'t conflict with \\'most\\' mods. Mods that make similar changes to the NPCs covered by this mod will obviously conflict. If you prefer the changes of a particular NPC over this mod, install this mod first, and make sure it\\'s higher in the load order. Mods that make general cosmetic changes to females in skyrim are fully compatible.\r\n",
