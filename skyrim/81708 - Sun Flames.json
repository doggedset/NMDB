  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=4]What this mod does[/size][/center]\r<br />It adds a new novice level restoration spell that puts flames and sunfire together. This spell promises to burn the undead with the light of the sun. It is meant for vigilant type characters. A way for this class to level restoration through attacking. Ordinarily to raise restoration, you have to take damage and heal it. With this spell you can take restoration into a fight. And the best part, it doesn&#39;t hurt living beings. So if your follower is being attack by a vampire, you can toss this spell at it and not risk hurting them.\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=4]Installation[/size][/center]\r<br />Installation is the same as most all mods. If using a mod manager click the download with manager button. If installing manually, download the esp and place it in the data folder.",
