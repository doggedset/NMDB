  "descriptionHtml": "i have made a fair few \\'Crest Mods\\' now, and this has to be one of my favorite, this looks very Spanish in as much as color scheme and name, even the coat of arms for some reason makes me think of Spain... but this to me seems a very noble and knightly crest, and i have \\'Tried\\' to represent that as much as possible on the guards of Markarth. this scheme goes well with all the dwarven architecture too :)\r\n\r\nanyway same story, check out my other Crest Mods by simply searching Crest Mod :) and the one that started it all off, my own coat of arms, \\'Whiterun Callaghan\\'\r\n\r\nim always open to requests for more Crest Mods so feel free, just remember to send a link to your crest, your preferred colors and which city or armor you want replaced.\r\n\r\nCallaghan04",
