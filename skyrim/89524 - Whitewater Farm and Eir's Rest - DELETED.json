There is a simple fix to that glitch:\n<br />\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]    drop the objects you want to place in your house on the floor,\n<br />[*]    leave the house,\n<br />[*]    come back into the house and place them where you want them to be.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Fixed!\n<br />\n<br />[center]_____oOo_____[/center]\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=5][b]I - Whitewater Farm:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />As it's name says, Whitewater Farm is a farm. It's fully functional and tended by an old couple of Nords, Allia and Bjorn. The current owner fled the country just after Alduin flew over his head after destroying Helgen but Allia and Bjorn decided that they would stay.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4][b]Location:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Whitewater Farm is located in Whiterun hold, east of Whiterun city, near Battleborn Farm.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4][b]How to get it?[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Like all the other player houses, Whitewater Farm can be bought, the condition being that the Jarl permits that you buy property in their hold. As far as Whiterun is concerned, you will be allowed to buy the property after you have given the Dragonstone to Farengar.\n<br />\n<br />To do so:\n<br />\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]    go to Whitewater Farm and pick up the note that is pinned on the door,\n<br />[*]    gather 10,000 Septims,\n<br />[*]    go see the current Jarl's steward in Whiterun.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />In exchange for the money, the steward will give the player the key to the main house and take the note.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4][b]What does the player buy exactly?[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The player buys the entire farm and all it's dependencies: buildings and animals, except for the dog. Old Boy, the dog, belongs to Allia and Bjorn and is not for hire.\n<br />\n<br />Allia and Bjorn live in the basement of the farm; they don't own it, the player does, but, all its content belong to the couple. Taking anything there is stealing.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4][b]What about safe storage?[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]﻿    the main house is a safe storage in itself as it will never reset. Anything the player takes, whether it's displaying on furniture or stored in sacks, barrels, chests, cupboards, dressers, end tables, will never come back. Anything the player puts there will stay there.\n<br />[*]    the house contains three bookshelves set to contain up to 6 times 18 books.\n<br />[*]    the basement being Allia and Bjorn's home, it resets.\n<br />[*]    all the containers outside reset.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4][b]What else?[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]    Old Boy Allia and Bjorn will not respawn once they have died.\n<br />[*]    once a week, on Saturday morning, Allia will spend three hours cleaning the house.\n<br />[*]    Allia sells food and produce from the farm,\n<br />[*]    once a month, beginning one month after the player bought the farm, talk to Allia, ask her how the farm is doing  and she'll give the player their share of the profits the farm generated.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4][b]Can the player move with spouse and children in the houses?[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />No. I had this in mind but, as a player myself, I felt the need for a place that would be for my character only, a place to crash and rest and heal and think and feel safe. And maybe keep stuff away from children.\n<br />\n<br />[center]_____oOo_____[/center]\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=5][b]II - Eir's Rest:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4][b]Location:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Eir's Rest is a small house situated in Riverwood, behind the Sleeping Giant Inn.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4][b]How does the player buy Eir's Rest?[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]    go fetch the dragonstone for Farengar and deliver it to him,\n<br />[*]    go to Eir's Rest in Riverwood and pick up the note that is pinned next to the door,\n<br />[*]    gather 2,000 Septims,\n<br />[*]    go see the current Jarl's steward in Whiterun.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />In exchange for the money, the steward will give the player the key to the house and take the note.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4][b]What about safe storage?[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]    the main house is a safe storage in itself as it will never reset. Anything the player takes, whether it's displaying on furniture or stored in sacks, barrels, chests, cupboards, dressers, end tables, will never come back. Anything the player puts there will stay there,\n<br />[*]    all the containers outside reset.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4][b]Anything else?[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Yes! Eirs was a hunter, she died some time ago, probably killed by bandits. Her dog, Baldwin, survived and will greet the player when he comes close to the house, eager to follow the Dragonborn during his/her adventures.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4][b]Note:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]    the dog will force greet the player only one time,\n<br />[*]    the player will know the dog's name after reading Eir's journal that she left on the table outside the house,\n<br />[*]    hiring Baldwin will still allow the player to hire another dog or animal (tested with both Meeko and Vigilance, should work with the animals added by Dawnguard),\n<br />[*]    the player can ask the dog to do things for him but but he won't attack people he likes.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[center]_____oOo_____[/center]\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][b]Note:[/b][/color] there is another mod by the name Whitewater Farm; it's pure coincidence if my mod wears the same name.
