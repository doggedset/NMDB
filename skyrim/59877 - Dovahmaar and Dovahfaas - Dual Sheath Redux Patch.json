  "descriptionHtml": "[u][b]IMPORTANT NOTICE\r<br />[/b][/u]Ever since the whole Steam curated workshop fiasco, Dreogan has removed/hidden most of their mods from the Nexus, including the original mod for this patch. There&#39;s nothing I can do about it, but I&#39;ll leave this patch available should anyone want it, if they already have the original mod.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/8TSwUCW.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Dovahmaar and Dovahfaas are powerful swords released a while back by Dreogan, but it seems no DSR patch were ever made for the longsword variant (Dovahfaas). With the original author&#39;s permission, I decided to do it and share it here.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Requirements[/b][/u]\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51842/?]Dovahmaar and Dovahfaas - The Dragon Reavers[/url]. The patch only contains the added DSR meshes and nothing more.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34155/?]Dual Sheath Redux[/url] by Neovalen.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Installation[/u]\r<br />- Simply use your favorite mod organizer to install (MO or NMM).\r<br />- For manual installing, extract the content and drop it in your Skyrim &gt; Data folder\r<br />- Make sure to run the Dual Sheath Redux patcher after installing.
