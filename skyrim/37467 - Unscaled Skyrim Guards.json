  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=limegreen][i]Remember to Endorse if you like this mod[/i][/color][/b]\r\n\r\nAnother personal mod that has been sitting in my load order since the early release of the Creation Kit. Constructive criticism is both welcome and encouraged, if you have any ideas on how to better improve this mod, leave a comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]=Description=[/b]\r\n\r\nAll of the Town Guards, Imperial Soldiers, and Stormcloaks have been set to level 20. They begin the game at this level, and will remain at this level well after you\\'ve risen above it. This will not affect soldiers added by the siege events.\r\n\r\nBy default, Guards in Skyrim begin the game around level 10 or 15(I don\\'t remember), making them extremely difficult defeat for the player, and any other enemy for that matter. Once the player reaches this level, the scaling begins... Every town guard and soldier in skyrim would remain at an equal level to the player, up until level 50. You often find a small group of guards to be a much greater challenge than any dragon.\r\n\r\nI personally find this ridiculous, though I can understand why it\\'s like this. I guess Beth didn\\'t want it to be too easy to escape getting sent to jail, or slaughter an entire city. However, It seems equally ridiculous that guards are some of the strongest NPCs in the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]=Installation=[/b]\r\nInstall with NMM or extract the ESP file into your Skyrim/Data folder and activate with Skyrim Launcher.\r\n\r\n[b]=Compatibility=[/b]\r\nThis mod may conflict with mods that make similar changes.",
