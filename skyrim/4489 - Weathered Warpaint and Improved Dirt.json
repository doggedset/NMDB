  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][url=http://xeniusmods.tumblr.com/]Follow my blog on Tumblr for the latest news on upcoming releases, progress reports, beta releases, and more![/url][/b][/center]\r\n\r\n[center]\r\n[img]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/images/726673-1322939863.png[/img]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356][img]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/images/2356-1-1323432138.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n[/center][img]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/images/726673-1322753681.png[/img]\r\n\r\nMakes the warpaint look more weathered and replaces the dirt with more detailed textures.\r\nBefore I edited the warpaint to give it a weathered look I made them more detailed as well.\r\n\r\nCurrently the game does not support high resolution warpaint, using a high resolution will make\r\nthem look blocky, much worse than the originals which only have a resolution of 256x256.\r\n\r\nThese textures are 512x512 and uncompressed, originally they were made at 2048x2048, whenever it\\'s \r\npossible to use those high resolution textures this mod will get updated.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/images/726673-1322753729.png[/img]\r\n\r\nUse 7zip or WinRar to extract the files.\r\nMove the Data folder to your Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\nYou can find the Skyrim folder here: Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\n\r\nTo those who are new to using Elder Scrolls mods:\r\n\r\n- You do not have to extract the .bsa archives. The folder provided by\r\n this mod has the same structure as the inside of the .bsa archive, it will\r\n override the textures that are included in the .bsa file.\r\n- Do not worry about the Data folder that already exists, the folder provided\r\nby this mod will be merged with the existing folder, it will not be overwritten.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/images/726673-1322753784.png[/img]\r\n\r\nRemove the following files:\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\tintmasks\\\\*Any filename containing \\\"female\\\" and \\\"warpaint\\\"*.dds\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\tintmasks\\\\*Any filename containing \\\"female\\\" and \\\"dirt\\\"*.dds\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\tintmasks\\\\*Any filename containing \\\"male\\\" and \\\"warpaint\\\"*.dds\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\tintmasks\\\\*Any filename containing \\\"male\\\" and \\\"dirt\\\"*.dds\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/images/726673-1322753839.png[/img]\r\n\r\nCompatible with any mod that does not replace female warpaint and/or dirt.\r\nCompatible with XCE, install this after.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/images/726673-1322753874.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[24-12-11] 1.0 Release\r\n[25-12-11] 1.1 Update - Added male dirt & warpaint textures\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/images/726673-1322753911.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThanks to leboef for the brushes\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/images/726673-1322753946.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThe content of this mod is open source and can be used freely on the following conditions:\r\n\r\n- Credit me\r\n- Notify me\r\n- Skyrim only\r\n[center][img]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/images/726673-1322939888.png[/img]\r\n[/center]",
