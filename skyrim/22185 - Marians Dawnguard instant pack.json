  "descriptionHtml": "!!!  DLC1 (Dawnguard) contents required  !!!\r\n\r\nThis location MOD is as follows;\r\n\r\nIntention of my mod (You dont have to read my personal intention ^ ^):\r\n\r\nPrimary intention is just put all the weapons/armors/items of DLC contents.\r\nStill secondary, I wanted to adventure with NPCs of both sides even if they are enemies in the DG contents. ^ ^\r\n\r\nThis mod enables you to visit other faction\\'s catsles (I imitate each castle as possible as I can). So even if you become Vimpire lord, you can still visit the DG castle (my mod\\'s catsle, though).\r\n\r\nAlso, I wanted to know how much strong the Vimpire lord if they become your allies.\r\nMelee type of the Vimpire lord is fierce/vicious/beasty, they bites enemies as finish-move.\r\nMagic type of the Lord is relatively same as the Vimpire mage.\r\n \r\n=========================\r\n1. Dawnguard North Branch\r\n=========================\r\nThe catsle is connected to Skyrim world by a Loading-door.\r\nThe loading door is relatively near the \\\"IceWaterJetty\\\" the boat near Volkihar castle \r\n\r\n(Map marker added, can be fast-traveled)\r\nI show you the place in the pic.\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================\r\n2. Dawnguard North Branch includes the followings\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ Dawnguard hunter NPCs \r\nAll of Dawnguard hunters are extracted/duplicated from the original.\r\nThey are well skilled with various perks(almost all the combat perks which player can obtain).\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ Cheat treasure boxes \r\nIn the Storage room located in the right of the castle, you can get all of the weapons/armors of Dawnguard/Vampires/Falmers/Moth priest/Auriel reprica.\r\n\r\nIf you dont like just pick up cheat items, buy from the castle\\'s merchants or make in the forge.\r\nI stocked various forge materials in the smithing room. ^ ^\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n3. Volkihar South Branch\r\n=========================\r\nThe castle is connected to Skyrim world by a Loading-door.\r\nThe loading door is relatively near the \\\"ArcWind\\\" (Map marker added, can be fast-traveled)\r\nI show you the place in the pic.\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================\r\n4. Volkihar South Branch includes the followings\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ Volkihar vampire NPCs \r\nAll of Volkihar vampire are extracted/duplicated from the original.\r\nThey are well skilled with various perks mainly vimpire ones (almost all the combat perks which player can obtain).\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ Vampire Lord followers\r\nBeast form Vimpire lords are ready to follow you.\r\nThey are skilled with vimpire lord perks (in addition to almost all the combat perks which player can obtain).\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ Cheat treasure boxes \r\nIn the Storage room located in the left of the castle, you can get all of the weapons/armors of Dawnguard/Vampires/Falmers/Moth priest/Auriel reprica.\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================\r\n5. About NPCs\r\n=============================\r\n5.1 Stats of NPCs\r\nI set NPCs to be ready to fight by giving them many useful combat perks/skills/spells. So when they level according to your char level, they will be able to cast strong spells/ to manuver skills.\r\n\r\nI put major skills on their name, such as \\\"Astrid Fire DualWield\\\". So please refer to their name for their major skills. Basically I put all the perks into them which player can obtain.\r\n\r\nThey are not essential but respawn-type, so even if they die they will pop up again after a while (30 days of Skyrim time-zone,,, i suppose) \r\n\r\n5.2 How to have town NPCs follow you\r\nIf you want my town people follow you as a Follower;\r\n- Open the console\r\n- Click the char whom you wanat to follow you\r\n- Input \\\"bat friend\\\" or \\\"bat friend02\\\" \r\n(bat friend is normal)\r\n(bat friend02 enables the follower very faster)\r\n\r\n- Close the console\r\n- talk to him/her to follow\r\n\r\nOr make a BAT file by yourself by including the following sentences;\r\nsetrelationshiprank player 4\r\naddfac 19809 1\r\naddfac 5c84d 1\r\naddfac 5a1a4 1\r\n\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n6. About Gray-faced NPCs\r\n=========================\r\nFirst of all, several vampire NPCs seem to be gray. \r\nAlso, some female NPCs are originally relatively gray-ish white skin tone. \r\n(I realize this when I check the faces of some female NPCs, so I emphsized the skin tone, still some are gray-ish in the dark...)\r\n\r\nI put FaceGen file into main file, so you dont need to do the following, but in case of my bad uploading; \r\nput the optional \\\"FaceGen\\\" folder manually in your; Data\\\\\\\\textures\\\\\\\\actors\\\\\\\\character\\\\\\\\FaceGenData\\\\\\\\FaceTint> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n7. Known problems\r\n=========================\r\n- If you have many followers (such as 10 @o@), the loading to the bars may stop.\r\ni assume this is because the place is CPU-heavy. \r\n\r\n- When you use my BAT file to a follower in the mist-heavy place like in the bar,\r\nfirst \\\"disable\\\" the fog/mist, then use the \\\"bat friend\\\". \r\n\r\n- Some of the NPCs have a fire-tail (especially Ranger type NPCs), I put the Fire-Atronach ability for those NPCs. This is for the following reason; when they are in sneaking with you, they are transparent. so if they have the fire-tail, you can see where they are (without it, you may mistakenly shoot the arrow in their head. lol lol and they get aggroed with you...). \r\n\r\n=========================\r\n8. My other mod\r\n=========================\r\n\r\n- Marians usual tools\r\nWhen you feel dull on your follower/enemies/your char, try this ^ ^\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18854\r\n\r\n- Marians Splash Markarth\r\nAnother town mod\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18507\r\n\r\n- Marians Pirates-coast Solitude\r\nTown mod\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19313\r\n\r\n- Marians Spa Windhelm\r\nTown mod\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21281\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n9. Lastly\r\n=========================\r\nInitially this mod was for my own use, so i made this with my taste.\r\nBut as long as i upload the mod, i always listen to your advice/opinion. o/ o/\r\n\r\nAnyway sorry for the inconveniences in DLing or other things like gray-shi faces...\r\n\r\n\r\n<<<< Updates Planning >>>\r\n\r\nNone. ^ ^\r\n\r\n- And some suggestions from you ~~~~ o/ o/\r\n(Though i am humble modder, so Quests kinda are out of range T_T)\r\n(And Quests scripts always bugging lol)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
