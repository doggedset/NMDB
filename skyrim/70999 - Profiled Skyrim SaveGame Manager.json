([i]e.g. C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Skyrim SaveGame Manager&#92;AutoNMM.vbs[/i])\r<br />After hitting OK you can now select &#34;Launch Custom Skyrim&#34; at the main manager window.\r<br />(If you have troubles with this, there&#39;s a image tutorial in the archive)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#e69138][size=4] = Removing =[/size][/color]\r<br />Activate the Profile you want to keep and delete the SaveGame managers folder.\r<br />As there it currently no way to merge SaveGame profiles, you can only keep one&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#e06666][size=4] = Before relying on this =[/size][/color]\r<br />1. Make sure, Profiling works for you\r<br />2. Backup your SaveGames\r<br />3. Try this app\r<br />4a) If everything works: be happy\r<br />4b) If it doesn&#39;t work: roll back your backup and throw a rotten potato at me (or try to give some feedback)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4] = How are SaveGames stored =[/size][/color]\r<br />I zip up your savegames in the applications directory under &#92;Profiles&#92;[PROFILENAME].zip\r<br />Because zipping in Java removes the Timestamps (which are essential for sorting your savegames) the app automatically generates, un-/zips and applies a filemeta.csv that stores those Timestamps.\r<br />For this reason, it is not recommended to manually unpack your savegames, unless you got a file attribute manipulation software you may use to manually apply the timestamps back on.\r<br />There is also no way to automatically merge profiles, if you want to do so:\r<br /> - or every profile you want to merge:\r<br /> - - activate the profile\r<br /> - - copy the saves into an external folder\r<br /> - - delete the profile if you don’t need it anymore\r<br /> - activate or create the profile you want to merge the savegames into\r<br /> - move all savegames from the external folder back to the skyrim save folder\r<br />Similar steps are to be taken to split a profile.\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=5][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/15561039/?tb=mods&pUp=1]More mods I made[/url][/b][/size][/center]",
