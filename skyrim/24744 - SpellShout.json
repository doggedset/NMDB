  "summary": "Never have to pause your game again with SpellShout. Voice activated Powers Shouts, Spells, Weapon, Armor, Food, Potions and More!",
  "descriptionHtml": "---What is this?---\r\nSpellShout is a program that recognizes voice commands to equip spells, weapons, apparel, and use your Thum and powers. \r\n\r\n\r\n---Important Info---\r\nMake sure you have a microphone plugged in and set to default for SpellShout to find.\r\n\r\nTo ensure Skyrim does not constantly minimize you must remove the check for \\\"Always ask before opening this file\\\" checkbox in the \\\"Open File-Security Warning\\\" dialog box. \r\n\r\nThere are two additonal .exe required that are located in ssData: Shout.exe and SpellShout.exe.\r\n\r\nThese .exe files must also have the \\\"Always ask before opeing this file\\\" check removed OR SKYRIM WILL CONSTANTLY MINIMIZE FROM THE .EXE ASKING WITH EACH COMMAND.\r\n\r\nAs for now SpellShout works with Windows Vista/7. \r\n\r\n*2.0 might contain unforeseen bugs,  I haven\\'t had as many friends playing Skyrim to test it before upload this time around.  Any and all issues that arise I will remedy as fast as I can.  I apologize for the slow update process.  During the last few months of 2012 I was finishing my final semester of college and that took my attention away from SpellShout.  I have since finished my degree so my time can be more devoted to this.  Anyways, I hope that SpellShout can bring you a level of immersion you won\\'t find anywhere else.  If you enjoy using this mod please spread the word, and if you have a decent enough PC upload a few videos of it in action on Youtube.  I\\'d really appreciate it :)\r\n\r\n***Remove all pre 2.0 files (Shout.exe, SpellShout.exe, ssGrammar.ini, SpellShout.ini) when updating to the current version.***\r\n\r\n---Change Log---\r\nAlpha Version 2.1\r\n-Added Eat and Drink commands, such as \\\"Eat Sweet Roll\\\" or \\\"Drink Alto Wine\\\", for food and beverages.  Great for Needs Mods. \r\n-Added Drop and Use item AGH forms.  Great for camping mods.\r\n-Added Potions, Elixers, and Draughts.  Just say the full name to use the potion.  I have opted to not use Drink in the command to seperate beverages from potions.  I will add if requested.\r\n-Added Push to Talk.  Now have SpellShout switch only when pressing and holding a specified talk key of your choosing.  Not required for use.\r\n-Added a way to disable/enable specific Dragon Tongue shouts and dual wield spells that use no prefix.  Certain spells such as Calm and Call of Valor 1 (HOON) can be mistaken by a cough, sneeze, or loud exhale.  NOTE This only disables no prefix dual equips, You can still dual wield equip disabled spells by saying the \\\"Dual Wield\\\" commands.\r\n-Changed form from Official/Mod to Basic/Advanced.\r\n-Included a \\\"Convert to Advanced\\\" button.  Due to Skyrim having hundreds upon hundreds of items, I cannot check each and everyone to make sure the code being applied is accurate.  With the Convert to Advanced button you will be able to see and modify the Ref ID spell shout is applying from the chosen items.\r\n-Started the groundwork for Grammar Packs.  This will allow users to create and share grammar packs that contain commands for popular mods.  This will be in 2.2.\r\n-Timing delays should be fixed\r\n\r\nAlpha Version 2.0\r\n-Added support for infinite AGH.\r\n-AGH no longer limited by which weapon is being equipped.\r\n-Combined Command and Phrase textboxes into a single \\\"Trigger\\\" text box.  \r\n-Added a rudimentary sorting and tagging system.  (Barebones but works well for most instances)\r\n-Added support for Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and any other mods activated.\r\n-Added AGH commands for Hotkeys 1 through 8.\r\n-Added miscellaneous AGH commands such as the ability to open map, spellbook, and other menus.\r\n-Added support for Voice/Power AGH commands.\r\n-Removed requirement to say \\\"Enable Alternate Grammar\\\" each startup.  AGHs will be enumerated automatically each start-up.\r\n-Switching now requires only one key for all instances.\r\n-Spells can be dual equipped by saying just the spell\\'s name.  No longer is the prefix \\\"dual wield\\\" required, although it can still be used.\r\n\r\nAlpha Version 1.3\r\n-Added Alternate Grammar Hotkeys(AGH) for the following: Spells and Swords.\r\n-Use AGH to mix and match spells, as well as swords and shields\r\n-Changed file locations to one directory.  This should help anyone who\\'s SpellShout.asi could not load data from /ssData/.\r\n-Upcoming update I plan to add Apparel to AGH that will include Helms, Gloves, Body, and Boots.\r\n\r\nAlpha 1.2.2\r\nAdded remaining Sheilds, Maces, Axes, Magic Apparel, and Magic Weapons to the Equip Command.\r\nPlans for 1.3: Add a form for custom made user commands.  Many of the items in game have quite long and ridiculous names to say on the fly so I will be programming a way for the user to have 10 custom phrases and commands per item type.  10 for swords, 10 for daggars, 10 for boots, so on and so forth.\r\nPlans for 1.4: Dawnguard and mod support.  It\\'s proving itself to be a challenge but I hope to have Dawnguard and mod items ID enumeration solution by this release.\r\n\r\nAs always if you find a weapon or item doesn\\'t equip just message me or comment and I\\'ll address them in minor updates.\r\n\r\nAdded Items: Magic Apparel, Magic Weapons,Maces, Axes, and Shields                      \r\n\r\nAlpha 1.2\r\nAdded Equip command to help.  *NOTE* When equipping items say only the base name.  Do not include Legendary, Epic, ect.  Weapons that come with enchantments like \\\"Dwarven Warhammer of Absorption\\\" are separate items with their own ID and must be coded individually.  After adding all the base weapons I will move on to enchanted weapons.\r\n\r\nBegan steps for Dawnguard and addition mod item,spell,power, and shout IDs.\r\n\r\nAdded the following weapons to Equip Weapon command: Daggars, Remaining Bows, and Staves\r\n\r\nAlpha 1.1\r\nFixed Enable all command\r\nFixed tooltip text\r\nFixed Auto Powers checkbox\r\nChanged a few of the grammar phrases of shouts\r\n\r\nAdded Equip Weapon commands for the following weapons:Swords and Bows\r\n\r\n---Important Info---\r\nMake sure you have a microphone plugged in and set to default for SpellShout to find.\r\n\r\nTo ensure Skyrim does not constantly minimize you must remove the check for \\\"Always ask before opening this file\\\" checkbox in the \\\"Open File-Security Warning\\\" dialog box. \r\n\r\nThere are two additonal .exe required that are located in ssData: Shout.exe and SpellShout.exe.\r\n\r\nThese .exe files must also have the \\\"Always ask before opeing this file\\\" check removed OR SKYRIM WILL CONSTANTLY MINIMIZE FROM THE .EXE ASKING WITH EACH COMMAND.\r\n\r\nAs for now SpellShout works with Windows Vista/7. \r\n\r\n---What is this?---\r\nSpellShout is a program that recognizes voice commands to equip spells, equipment, and use your Thum and powers.
