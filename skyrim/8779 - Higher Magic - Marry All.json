  "descriptionHtml": "Higher Magic Marry All  by Pan Dragondagger\r\n\r\nThis file is only for distribution on Skyrim Nexus\r\nDo not re-distribute without my advance permission\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\nThis allows you to marry just about Anyone... even if you can\\'t marry them normally.\r\n\r\nYoung, old, middle aged, male, female, whatever...\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNOTE : This is not perfect, but it gets the job done.\r\n\r\nYou will have to input commands in the console line to do this\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nStep by step.\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Start off like normal. Talk to the priest, and get the necklace.\r\n\r\n2) Go to the person you want to marry\r\n\r\n3) wear the necklace (like normal)\r\n\r\n4) speak to them like normal (they may give you the comment to marry or not already)\r\n\r\n5) If you do not see the command to ask them to marry you, in the console, type :\r\n\r\n\tSetstage RelationshipMarriage 15\r\n\r\n\r\n6) Talk to them again. See if your reputation is high enough. If not, in console, type :\r\n\r\n\tSetRelationshipRank Player 4\r\n\r\n\r\n7) Talk to them again. You should get the prompt to arrange the marriage.\r\n\r\n8) Talk to the priest again, and arrange the marriage, like normal.\r\n\r\n9) Wait for your marriage, like normal\r\n\r\n10) He will start the ceremony, Like normal. \r\n    He will get to the part where he asks you for your vows, like normal.\r\n\r\n** NOTE ** He will possibly not be able to finish the vows, depending on who you try to marry. He \r\n\r\nwill hold his hands up, and keep waiting... \r\n\r\n\tIf this waiting happens, go to console, and type :\r\n\r\n\tsetstage relationshipMarriageWedding 100\r\n\r\n11) You will be married, Congrats. You can then watch your bride walk out, and you can hook up \r\n\r\nwith her outside, or at her place, and coordinate things to move in with you. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE : This is ugly, I know. This is crude, I know.  But... it has worked 8 times for me already, \r\n\r\nso I know it works.  \r\n\r\nNote : Depending on who you marry, you may not have voice files for some of the marriage stuff. \r\n\r\nThe menus will still work, as well as the perks of the marriage.\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nNEW UPDATE :\r\n\r\nI have added a stone to the Temple of Mara, which will allow you to perform the \\\"setrelationshiprank 4\\\" command,  so that will allow some additional marriages, without console commands at all. Tested on multiple kids, and the lady in the orphanage.  :)\r\n=====\r\n1.3 Update - Dawnguard & Hearthfire Version.\r\n\r\nI have added the NPC\\'s for Dawnguard  and Hearthfires for the marriage list. Yes, this means you can marry the Urchins you would normally adopt if you like.\r\n\r\nNOTE : Serana still does NOT give you the option to marry. I still need to work on that one.\r\n======\r\n1.4 Update : \r\n\r\nAdded Dragonborn NPC\\'s to the file. It covers DG, HF & DB right now.",
