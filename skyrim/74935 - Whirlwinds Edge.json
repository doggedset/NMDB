  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]cgClkkobch4[/youtube]\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Whirlwind sprint now does area of effect damage to enemies when shouted, Making it simulate them taking damage, A shadowstep if you will.\r<br />Enemies will also have a darkness effect, But by the time you dash through them you might not notice it.\r<br />Simulates when you pass through enemies, They take damage because of it. Making whirlwind sprint much more valuable.\r<br />There is however an exploit of coarse, Bethesda did not program a line based area attack, So I did my best by making the area line of sight only.\r<br />Even if you do choose to use this exploit, The cooldowns for whirlwind sprint remain 20,25, and 35.\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Shout 1\r<br />30 area 60 damage  A small line of fows, Lets say a small bridge.\r<br />\r<br />Shout 2\r<br />90 area 60 damage  An average line of fows, Medium sized bridge.\r<br />\r<br />Shout 3 110 area 60 damage  A very big line of enemies, Were talking yards.\r<br />\r<br />I left the damage 60 and upped the area each shout to compensate for how many enemies this would hit at once, Also i did testing on the mine before riverwood with the enemy on the opposit side of the bridge, This should be pretty accurate.",
