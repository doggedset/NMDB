  "descriptionHtml": "This is v2 of my little Modification that replaces some of the \\\"Ugly\\\" Human and now Elv hairstyles with \\\"Prettyer\\\" ones from Female Orcs. \r\n\r\nIts still work in Progress and will be Updated as soon as Creation kit is been released.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nthe crossing between hair and skin is visible. Due to the lack of hairstyles the model would have to be adjusted\r\n\r\nv2: Hair has been added to every elven race in the Game,\r\nalso i took other human hairstyles for replacing as some people seem to like the hair i       replaced in v1.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nJust add \\\"Meshes\\\" to \\\"Data\\\" folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
