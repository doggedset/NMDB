  "modName": "Masterspells destruction fiX",
  "summary": "This will buff up the masterspells, so they will be truly powerful.. I made the charge-time 5 sec though, just for balance.. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will enhance all the three master destruction spells, so that they would be a worthy reward for all the shit you needed to get through to get them. A true reward for becoming a frozen sorcerer, a fiery wizard, or a sparkling fairy.\r\n\r\nWhat I did:\r\n\r\nI made the blizzard make 20 pts for 30 sec, would be more realistic as it is a blizzard... \r\nI made the firestorm take about 300 pts, as it too needed to pack a punch...\r\nI made the thunderstorm take about .. a houndred? I don\\'t really remember.. :/\r\n\r\nALL OF THEM NOW NEEDS 5sec to CHARGE (FOR BALANCE) !\r\n\r\n\r\nAAAAAND I just made the wizard\\'s fire a little more powerful (from 60 to 75), cuz I found It little rewarding... BtW: I changed some of the names, mainly because they were not that well fitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO INSTALL:\r\n\r\n- go get yourself something to drink, IN A GLASS (hydration is important)\r\n\r\n- now that you have gotten the drink you may drink half of it\r\n\r\n- then you may overview the mod page\r\n\r\n- and now take just a little sip of your drink thereafter\r\n\r\n- it is important to read the description, remember to do that\r\n\r\n- take just a little sip more, leaving about 1/4 left in the glass\r\n\r\n- now you may click the download with manager button\r\n\r\n- while it dowloads you may finish your drink\r\n\r\n- And at last you may sit yourself comfertably back in a chair with a straight back\r\n\r\n- now you may double-tap the mod in the manager\r\n\r\n- adjust your back meanwhile, not to make long term injury\r\n\r\n- and then click the \\\"OK\\\" button.\r\n\r\n ..... Just to play skyrim now .....",
