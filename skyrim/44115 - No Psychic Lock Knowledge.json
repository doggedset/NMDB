  "descriptionHtml": "No Psychic Lock Knowledge v2\r<br />-------------------------------------------\r<br />By jackstarr\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/jUinUJU.gif[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This simple mod removes the visual tag that lets you know if a lock is apprentice, adept, master, etc. - now you need to try and pick the lock and judge the difficulty level yourself&#33;\r<br />\r<br />No difficulty settings are changed, it just removes the visual tag that gives you some sort of psychic prior knowledge before you even attempt to pick the lock.\r<br />\r<br />How can you know what level a lock is just by looking at it - when visually they all look identical?&#33; \r<br />\r<br />It removes the level of the lock from displaying both when you look at a locked door or chest, and in the lockpicking mini-game screen.  Use your skill and experience to judge how difficult a lock is&#33; \r<br />\r<br />This mod was made by request for gdsmth.\r<br />                  \r<br />\r<br />UPDATED 17 April 2014.  \r<br />What&#39;s new?  If you use SKSE, thanks to Quad2Core, this mod now also hides the text in the lockpicking menu referring to &#34;lock level&#34;, as it was odd to see text saying &#34;lock level:&#34; when the lock level itself was removed&#33;  If you don&#39;t use SKSE then this text will remain.  \r<br />This mod also now comes with an NMM installer - both versions of the mod (either completely empty or saying &#34;[locked]&#34;) are included.  YOU DO NOT NEED SKSE TO RUN THIS MOD, but if you use SKSE you get the extra feature.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />NMM is the supported method of installation.\r<br />\r<br />For the information of those installing manually:\r<br />File1 is the version without any text.\r<br />File2 is the version that says [locked].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Known (very minor) issue: \r<br />If you don&#39;t have SKSE then the visual tag when you hover over a lock will be removed, as will the details of the lock level itself in the lockpicking menu, but the text in the loackpicking menu that says &#34;lock level:&#34; will not be removed.  If you later install SKSE then the &#34;lock level:&#34; text will not be removed until you start a new game.  This may be fixed in a future version.\r<br />If you already have SKSE installed when you install this mod, or start a new game after installing this mod, then the issue won&#39;t arise.  \r<br />\r<br />[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/1wXSO.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />OTHER SIMILAR MODS BY THE SAME MOD AUTHOR:\r<br />\r<br />No Empty Tag on Empty Containers:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31463]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31463[/url]\r<br />This mod attempts to improve immersion by removing the tag that says &#34;empty&#34; on an empty container, letting you know it&#39;s empty (through some sort of hidden psychic power) before you even look inside&#33;  It also removes the triangle icon as well - so there&#39;s no clue as to whether the container is empty or not before activating it.",
