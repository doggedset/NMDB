  "summary": "Merchants never run out of gold even if they only have a maximum of 6500 gold (lower for most types of merchants). How is this possible? Simple, I reset the merchants&#39; gold whenever you ask them to barter with you. Now you can spend  your time killing dragons and bandits instead of traveling around Tamriel just to sell your loot...",

I&#39;m pretty sure it will run with the original Skyrim game so if you want to try a much better version of this mod, you can check [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1826]Master Trader SE - Merchants Never Run Out Of Gold[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ffcc33]True story...[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />One day, I came out from a bloody dungeon with barely any strength left. My bags were filled at capacity, I even had to drop some valuable loot to be able to travel safely to the nearest city. When I arrived in Whiterun, I visited Adrianne Avenicci to sell my treasures. After a couple items, she ran out of gold so I had to visit Ulfberth War-Bear next. Then, I went to Belethor, Arcadia, Elrindir, Eorlund Gray-Mane and finally Farengar Secret-Fire. The town&#39;s merchants litteraly ran out of gold. So I decided to visit Solitude&#39;s merchants then Riften&#39;s to sell what remained of my treasures. It took me over a week to sell everything.\r<br />\r<br />So what&#33; That&#39;s a common tale, I hear you say? What does it have to do with us?\r<br />\r<br />Let me enlighten you and let us rejoice in the glory of the Nines as our prayers have been heard&#33; As of this very moment, all merchants across Tamriel and beyond have been granted an infinite amount of gold&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Ahhhhh&#33; But there are other mods that give merchants a ton of gold you replied to me.\r<br />\r<br />Oh no&#33; Noooooooo young one&#33; No mod does what mine does... Simply adding gold to a merchant merely delays your misery, wouldn&#39;t it be much better if merchants never run out of gold instead? Let that sink in for a moment... [color=#fe2e2e]NEVER RUN OUT OF GOLD[/color]...\r<br />\r<br />I can hear you asking yourselves if your first born will be enough? Fret not brothers and sisters as this one is granted for free, we&#39;re of Dovahkin blood, we&#39;re family. Just help this humble prophet spread the word so all our brothers and sisters can see the light&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ffcc33]So what this mod does?[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Master Trader (perk) --[/color]\r<br />[color=#cb99c9]Every merchant in the world open up their trade route to you. This guarantee they&#39;ll have at least 5 times their basic gold on hand to barter with you and they&#39;ll never run out of gold.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- In simple words --[/color]\r<br />It modifies the barter dialogue so every time you select &#34;What have you got for sale?&#34;, it adds 5 times the basic amount of gold to the merchant if you have the Master Trader perk. That means that even [color=#cb99c9]when the merchant has 0 gold left, all you have to do is exit the barter menu and select the dialogue option again to get a fresh amount of gold[/color]. Thus, gold is unlimited.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Limitations --[/color]\r<br />[color=#fe2e2e]I use the Master Trader perk, you need to invest yourself to get some goodies[/color]. It&#39;s obvious you can&#39;t just give that awesome time saver to everyone that starts a game.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#fe2e2e]&#34;Unlimited gold&#34; doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll be able to sell a sword for 25K[/color]. To address the gold problem, all the mods I&#39;ve seen go in the same way: they add a lot of gold to merchants. The unfortunate effect is you can sell 1 item for a disproportionate amount of gold. My mod address this problem by limiting the total amount of gold available, but replenish the merchant&#39;s gold to avoid waiting the usual 2 days or the need to find another merchant. You thus get unlimited gold without getting an &#34;unlimited price&#34; for 1 item.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#fe2e2e]To be more realistic, the gold added is proportional to the merchant type[/color]. For example, a city blacksmith has 1000 gold, so with Master Trader he will have an extra 5000 to spare, which brings it to a total of 6000 gold. On the other hand, a street vendor has 50 gold, so he will have an extra 250 gold which brings it to a total of 300 gold.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#fe2e2e]To avoid messing with leveled list, I changed the gold from the vanilla Master Trader perk from 1000 to 50 instead of just removing it[/color]. An extra 1000 gold was balanced for a blacksmith, but it was out of proportion for a street vendor who had 50 gold to begin with. Since an extra 50 gold won&#39;t unbalance a street vendor, I think it&#39;s a good compromise to avoid compatibility problems.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#fe2e2e]This mod doesn&#39;t affect directly the merchant&#39;s &#34;barter&#34; gold, only the gold &#34;on&#34; the merchant[/color]. This one is a bit complicated. Merchant don&#39;t usually have gold &#34;on&#34; them, the gold you see when you barter with them is hidden in their trading chest just like a sword would. This &#34;barter&#34; gold is thus not &#34;on&#34; the merchant and is governed by the laws of leveled list by the game. This means that &#34;barter&#34; gold cannot be tempered with directly, at least not in a live fashion. To circumvent this problem, this mod adds gold directly &#34;on&#34; the merchant before the barter menu appears which has the effect of adding temporarily the gold &#34;on&#34; the merchant to the &#34;barter&#34; gold. To avoid exploits, the mod removes the gold &#34;on&#34; the merchant as soon as you quit the barter menu. So even if you kill the merchant, you won&#39;t find the gold on the corpse. You also can&#39;t exploit the &#34;replenished&#34; gold by selecting &#34;What have you got for sale?&#34; 5 times in a row and expect 5 times the extra gold.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#fe2e2e]Investments and the leveled gold from the vanilla Master Trader perk are part of the &#34;barter&#34; gold[/color]. Thus, they will have no effect on the gold added &#34;on&#34; the merchant. Including those would unbalance merchants&#39; gold unnecessarily and would require a much more complex solution.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#fe2e2e]The gold &#34;on&#34; a merchant will never be greater than 20k[/color]. Technically speaking, it&#39;s impossible for a vanilla merchant to have 20K &#34;on&#34; him/her/it. The only way this could ever happen is if a mod introduces a custom merchant with gold &#34;on&#34; himself. In that case, this mod caps the gold to 20K to avoid the &#34;merchant gold bug&#34; where the gold get &#34;stuck&#34; at 30k something and you receive nothing for things you sell. I chose the 20k value because I didn&#39;t want to get in the way of other mods too much. Normally, you&#39;ll never get near that amount of gold &#34;on&#34; a merchant.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#fe2e2e]A merchant that doesn&#39;t use the standard dialogue to barter with you will not benefit from this mod[/color]. You could ask the author to add the functionality to his mod or do it yourself. I include the sources for that reason. Normally, it should work out of the box as modders don&#39;t tend to stray too far when it comes to this aspect of the game.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Gold formula --[/color]\r<br />[color=#cb99c9]&#34;Barter&#34; gold = Basic gold + New Master Trader gold + Investment gold + Vanilla Modified Master Trader gold[/color]\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Basic gold&#34; depends on the type of merchants.\r<br />[code]1000 -&gt; City blacksmith or fence\r<br />750 --&gt; General goods or some of Riften&#39;s street vendors\r<br />500 --&gt; Apothecary, spell vendor or town blacksmith\r<br />400 --&gt; Orc blacksmith\r<br />100 --&gt; Innkeeper\r<br />50 ---&gt; Hunter, jeweler, peddler or street vendor[/code]\r<br />\r<br />&#34;New Master Trader gold&#34; is 5 times the &#34;basic gold&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Investment gold&#34; is 500 if you invested in the merchant or 0 if you didn&#39;t.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Vanilla Modified Master Trader gold&#34; is always 50.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ffcc33]Installation, requirements and compatibility[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Requirements --[/color]\r<br />Latest version of Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Install (auto) --[/color]\r<br />For an automatic install without risk of errors, I suggest you use the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager/][color=#7dc7ea]NexusModManager[/color][/url].\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Install (manual) --[/color]\r<br />For a manual install, extract the files from this mod and copy them to the appropriate folders.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Compatibility --[/color]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Compatible with everything that doesn&#39;t modify the &#34;barter&#34; dialogue branch. To my knowledge, only [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34224/][color=#7dc7ea]Vendor Sale Delay - GONE[/color][/url] does that.\r<br />[*]Compatible with mods that modifies the Master Trader perk as long as you load my mod first. The only downside to having such a mod is the Master Trader description in the perk screen won&#39;t be the one from my mod. It&#39;s only aesthetic, my mod will be perfectly fine.\r<br />[*]Compatible with mods that add gold to merchants, but the gold added/replenished by Master Trader won&#39;t change, nor does the 20k limit.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ffcc33]F.A.Q.[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Known issues --[/color]\r<br />It seems that all merchants enthralled by Miraak to build pillars in Solstheim simply don&#39;t work. The problem isn&#39;t easy to fix as they&#39;re not considered by the game as NPC, at least not by the console or the Papyrus engine. Since they&#39;re not NPCs, I can&#39;t resplenish their gold. Fixing this would mean changing a couple things in the Dragonborn&#39;s main quest... Let&#39;s just say I wouldn&#39;t dare try to touch this with a ten foot pole, so I don&#39;t plan on fixing this. In any case, you can still find merchants in Solstheim that weren&#39;t enthralled and work flawlessly, use those instead.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Do you use scripts? --[/color]\r<br />[color=#cb99c9]There seems to be a lot of FUD about scripts so let me explain a couple things. Scripts are part of the game, without them vanilla Skyrim wouldn&#39;t work at all[/color]. All vendors and trainers are purely scripted. Most of the quests wouldn&#39;t work without scripts and there must be countless other scripted things in that game I never thought about. [color=#cb99c9]Scripts aren&#39;t inherently bad, inexperienced mod authors are[/color]. Because mod authors used badly explained functions in the past, which is the Creation Kit wiki&#39;s fault, scripts have been pointed as the cause for all the problems in the world... [color=#cb99c9]Like most things in life, clueless people will mess things up, but those that do know how to work with them can do wonders[/color]. As a professional programmer myself, I make sure to the best of my knowledge that all my scripts won&#39;t cause you any trouble. I also make sure they are upgradable and can be stopped at anytime.\r<br />\r<br />With that said, [color=#cb99c9]yes there are scripts in my mod[/color]. In fact, the game is made in a way where the barter menu is always called by script so I kinda had no choice. [color=#cb99c9]Those scripts cannot mess your game and are extremely fast to execute[/color]. [color=#fe2e2e]I also packaged the sources[/color] in case you want to look at them and decide for yourself. Stop worrying your world&#39;s gonna implode and enjoy the mod.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Any future plans? --[/color]\r<br />I&#39;ll fix problems (if any), offer support and answer questions when needed.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ffcc33]Credits[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][color=#cb99c9]amgepo[/color] ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26393/][color=#7dc7ea]Vilja in Skyrim[/color][/url]) for giving me the right hints on giving infinite gold to a merchant\r<br />[*][color=#cb99c9]Emma[/color] ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26393/][color=#7dc7ea]Vilja in Skyrim[/color][/url]) for introducing me to amgepo which was invaluable in getting this done\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ffcc33]Complementary mods[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34612/][color=#7dc7ea]Trade and Barter[/color][/url]: I use it to introduce some variability in the merchants gold.
