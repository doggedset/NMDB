Some mods have lots of scripts, and the worse case is the Author didn&#39;t bother with script&#39;s name for easy sorting. This time, open your Mod package and extract the scripts to any NEW folder. \r<br />[img]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s392/StereoxII/1_zpsvpuhg2qs.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />2. It should looks like this\r<br />[img]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s392/StereoxII/2_zpsxphwhntb.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />3. Now we&#39;re creating the list of your extracted files name\r<br />a. Open Command Prompt by clicking it on your Start menu or by pressing Windows+R, then type CMD.\r<br />b. And then change directory to your recently extracted Scripts. For this case it&#39;s &#34;D:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim Mods&#92;Bash Installers&#92;Scripts&#34; by using command &#34;cd *file Directory&#34; (without quotation marks)\r<br />c. Then type &#34;dir /b&gt;List.txt&#34; (without quotation marks)\r<br />d. Done &#33; Now you have a &#34;List.txt&#34; text file with the scripts&#39; name on that Directory\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s392/StereoxII/3_zpsf4gb6z6r.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />4. Open with Microsoft Word (i&#39;m using this because it has special character treatment). It should looks like this:\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s392/StereoxII/4_zpskekeingt.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />5. Use the Replace feature at top right and type:\r<br />- &#34;^p&#34; (without the quotation marks) on Find box\r<br />- &#34;(space)/f^pdel(space)&#34; (without the quotation marks) on Replace box\r<br />- Click replace All. And it should be like this picture.\r<br />- Notice that the top line doesn&#39;t have &#34;del&#34; on the beginning, you can add it manually\r<br />- Save the file\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s392/StereoxII/5_zps8vrv1szu.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />6. Open the List.txt file with notepad and Save As it as a .BAT file by renaming it to List.bat. Don&#39;t forget to change the format to All Files.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1049.photobucket.com/albums/s392/StereoxII/6_zpsuqnhxl9i.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />7.
