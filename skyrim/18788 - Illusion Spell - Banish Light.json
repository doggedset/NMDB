  "modName": "Illusion Spell - Banish Light",
  "summary": "Banish Light is an Illusion Spell that will allow you to remotely extinguish light sources, lowering the level of illumination and making it a bit easier to sneak.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Update v1.2:  \r\n- Extinguished lights can be relit using any fire-based spell or shout. \r\n- Duration is now based on Illusion skill level, it starts at 5 seconds for 0 Illusion skill and increases to 65 seconds at 100 skill. This will still work with mods that increase the skill cap, it will just continue to increase as you increase Illusion skill above 100.\r\n[youtube]TRsPg70kQOI[/youtube]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\nDescription\r\n-------------------\r\nThis mod adds an Illusion spell called Banish Light, it is a targeted spell that will extinguish any light for a short time, lowering the light level and making it a bit easier to sneak past NPCs. Banish Light requires a minimum Illusion skill of 25, see below for details on how to acquire the spell tome in game. Spell tome price and mana consumption are comparable to other apprentice level Illusion spells.\r\n\r\nNexus Link: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18788/\r\n\r\nCheck out my Water Arrows mod if you\\'d like a non-magic alternative:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12555\r\n\r\nNOTE: Not all light emitters have corresponding unlit versions.  For those that do, this spell will replace the lit emitter with the unlit one (and vice versa when the effect wears off).  For those emitters without unlit versions, the lit emitter will still remain after using Banish Light (this is only cosmetic though, the spell will still disable nearby light effects, lowering the light level).  I\\'m currently working on adding unlit meshes to fix this.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatability\r\n==============\r\nI have not yet tested this mod with popular lighting mods to see if there are any conflicts.  This mod should not cause any problems with other mods, but it is likely that the Banish Light spell will not work on any new lights added by another mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Acquire In Game\r\n=======================\r\n- You can buy the Banish Light spell tome from the following merchants:\r\n\t- Enthir, Winterhold College\r\n\t- Farengar, Whiterun\r\n\t- Sybille Stentor, Solitude\r\n\t- Nelacar, Winterhold\r\n\t- Madenas, Dawnstar\r\n- To ensure the vendor carries the tome, visit one of the vendors above, leave the current area, wait 24 hours and return.\r\n- If you\\'d rather just use the console, use the following command:\r\nplayer.addspell XX0053eb\r\nWhere XX is the number this mod appears in your load order (you can also use the command \\'help \\\"Banish Light\\\"\\' to get the full id).\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n1. Extract the files to a temporary location.\r\n2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.\r\n3. Copy files to (install folder)\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n4. Start Skyrim Launcher, click \\'Data Files\\', place a checkmark beside the .esp file.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, use the Skyrim Nexus Mod Manager, or Steam workshop (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=76841221).\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file(s).\r\n2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.\r\nSkyrim/Data/BanishLight.esp\r\nSkyrim/Data/Scripts/BanishLightScript.pex\r\nSkyrim/Data/Scripts/AddToVendorAliasScript.pex\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.2 2012/6/28 - Lights can now be relit using any fire based ability (spells, shouts, etc.). \r\n              - The duration is now based on your Illusion skill level, the higher your skill the longer the light will   remain extinguished. (At 0 skill the duration is 5 seconds, this increases to a maximum of 60 seconds at 100 skill)\r\n1.1.2 2012/6/26 - New approach to adding to vendor lists, should work now, check above for new list of vendors.\r\n1.1.1, 2012/6/23 - Fixed bug preventing spell tome from being added to vendor lists.\r\n1.1, 2012/6/21 - Lowered mana consumption and fixed a minor issue with adding the spell tome to vendor lists. \r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\n- There are occasionally multiple light emitters right next to each other, at the moment the Banish Light spell will only replace one of them with the unlit version, leaving the others still lit.\r\n\r\n- Some candles will extinguish only once, once they return to normal, BanishLight will still disable the light effects, but the emitter will remain unchanged.  Exiting and re-entering the cell should return it to normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\nThanks to TESNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\nThanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nReadme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r\nSkyrim Creation Kit - http://www.creationkit.com",
