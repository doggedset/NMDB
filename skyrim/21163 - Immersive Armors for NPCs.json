The armors from his mod are already included in outfits, leveled lists, chests, quest rewards, and locations, but I felt that some of the major characters of the game would benefit from wearing them as well. I decided to expound upon the outfit changes this mod presented by adding the armors to tons more NPCs around the world. \r\n\r\nI tried to stay as lore-friendly as I could. By doing so I decided not to use every armor included in the original mod. Some didn\\'t fit well and others I had a hard time finding the right NPC to use it on. I am very open to suggestion as to what NPC should be wearing what armor so please let me know if you think that something should be changed and I will be happy to do so.\r\n\r\nI intend on expanding on this idea and including some of the other popular armor mods on the site and scattering them throughout Skyrim on other NPCs as well. Let me know what you guys think!\r\n\r\n[size=18][b]NPCs Altered[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Whiterun[/b][/size]\r\nAmren, Sinmir, Hrongar, Eorlund Gray-Mane, Idolaf Battle-Born, Jon Battle-Born, Torvar, and Avulstein Grey-Mane\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Dawnstar[/b][/size]\r\nCaptain Wayfinder, Irlof, Alding, Gjuk, and Guthrum\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Falkreath[/b][/size]\r\nHelvard, Valdr, and Thadgeir\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Markarth[/b][/size]\r\nVorstag, Ondolemar, Thongvor, Yngvar, Argis, Dryston, and Cosnach\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Morthal[/b][/size]\r\nGorm\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Riften[/b][/size]\r\nMaul, Harrald, and Dirge\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Solitude[/b][/size]\r\nDorian, Safia, Bolgeir Bearclaw, Irnskar Ironhand, Legate Rikke, Ahtar, Tullius, and Jaree-Ra\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Windhelm[/b][/size]\r\nGalmar Stone-Fist\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Winterhold[/b][/size]\r\nKai, Wet-Pommel, and Golldir\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Helgen[/b][/size]\r\nHadvar, Ralof, Torolf, and Vilod\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Misc[/b][/size]\r\nErlendr\r\n\r\n[size=18][b]Installation[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nDownload using NMM and make sure you load after hothtrooper44 ArmorCompilation.esp\r\n\r\n[size=18][b]Compatibility[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThis mod will most likely conflict with other mods that change the default outfits of the specific NPCs that I changed. Most armor mods replace the vanilla ones so there should be a very low chance of any type of conflict. I would just load ImmersiveArmorsforNPCs.esp last in order to avoid this. I am working on a version that will work with the Skyre patch for Immersive Armors.\r\n\r\n[size=18][b]Known Bugs[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThe armors added to the NPCs were done so by using duplicates of the originals. So if you were to loot one of these NPCs and you also had the same armor in your inventory they would not stack. You would just have 2 of them. Not that big of a deal. Please let me know if any of the armors don\\'t turn out right or if I messed any of them up and I will try to fix it. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[size=18][b]Change Log[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]V 2[/b][/size]\r\nHuge update! Made some changes for better immersion. I removed Amren\\'s Redguard coif but kept the the outfit. I don\\'t think it makes him look like an outsider. What\\'s wrong with the guy just liking Redguard clothing? I also removed Imperial hero armor from Commander Caius and used it for Idolaf Battle Born instead. The Gray Manes should be wearing Viking Armor. Various changes to a few others in Whiterun. Changed some of the pirate outfits. Falkreath housecarl now wears the Falkreath armor. Added armor to about 10 more NPCs in Dawnstar, Markarth, Solitude, Windhelm, and Winterhold. Fixed Galmar\\'s armor. More updates to come!\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]V 1.2[/b][/size]\r\nA couple small updates to include optional no helmets versions by request. One version removes all helmets while the main file only removes Hadvars. If you want to continue using all helmets download the earlier version. I also changed Amren\\'s outfit to Redguard clothes instead of heavy armor. \r\n\r\n[size=3][b]V 1.1[/b][/size]\r\nFixed an error that caused Ralof to change armors during intro sequence. Edited Kematu with some Redguard Knight armor.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1056.photobucket.com/albums/t361/dorbson/credits-1.png[/img]\r\n\r\nMy credits are similar to the original mod obviously with an extra emphasis on the creator of Immersive Armors hothtrooper44.
