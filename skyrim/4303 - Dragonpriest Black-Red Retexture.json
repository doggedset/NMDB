  "descriptionHtml": "So after ive seen my first dragon priest in skyrim, i was blown of my computer out of awesomeness, seconds later the same happened to my character, taking the blown off part a bit too serious.\r\n\r\nAnyway, i thought they don\\'t quite look how they should in my oppinion, so here is my definition of the \\\"right\\\" looking.\r\n\r\nInstallation: Extract the files into your Skyrim main directory.\r\nUn-installation: Delete the folder \\\"dragonpriest\\\" in your \\\"textures\\\" directory of skyrim.\r\nSince i prefer and freakin RECOMMEND the manual way of installing it\\'s non-NMM download.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your new dragonpriests, if you\\'re playing as one, or playing against one. :)",
