  "descriptionHtml": "Hello Again peeps!\r\n\r\nYou guys may have seen my Nocturnal Hood attempt with my last Mod, but i really loved the hood for THE nocturnal Robe. So i manage to figure out with abit of struggle, how to wear the Hood witth NO BALDNESS! but at a small price!\r\n\r\nI have done the best i can do, only downfall is, you will see a small bit of baldness right under the Hood above the hairline, but it is not REALLY noticeable unless you look up inside the hood!\r\n\r\n[b]Install Instructions:[/b]\r\nPlease download file and place in Data of Skyrim Directory.\r\n\r\nThis only works for [b]One Hair Style![/b]. Reasons being there is no CS and this is the only hair style which works without showing any skin over the head at all! If you look at the pictures it will show you which style you need i will tell you how to change your hair to the one in the picture.\r\n\r\n[b]How to change Hair:[/b]\r\n-Type in Console [b]showracemenu[/b] which will take you to the character select screen, just go across to hair (Most female races should have this hair style) and select the right hair, then accept and retype your name.\r\n\r\nIt is best to save before doing any showracemenu alterations.\r\n\r\nThen your ready to go! and all set!\r\n\r\n[b]How to Gain Hood:[/b]\r\nWhat i have done here is replace the female Jesters hat so you have it ingame to use! remember its just the hood. in order to obtain this ether grab from Cicero from the Darkbrotherhood Questline or [b]player.additem 6492e[/b] via console.\r\n\r\n[b]How to Gain Robes[/b]\r\nRecommended Mod for Robe: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=762\r\nThis will replace the Arch-mage female Robe to the Nocturnal One you can ether get this from the Arcane University Guild Questline or [b]player.additem 7C932[/b] with console.\r\n\r\nAnyways i hope it was understandable! its not as hard as it sounds, but its worth it thats for sure!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\nHinigashi\r\n\r\n[b]Recommanded:[/b]\r\nNocturnal HQ Textures - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2688",
