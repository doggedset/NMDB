  "descriptionHtml": "PLEASE CHECK OUT: Bright Eyes (Eye texture mod)\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2464\r\nPlease endorse if you like. These are my first Skyrim mods.\r\n\r\nAre you sick of old wrinkly looking default textures and gigantic caveman eyebrows on your Skyrim females? Not interested in making your females look all pixelly and over-sharpened like other face mods? Read on...\r\n\r\nFountain of Youth - Beauty Project\r\nversion 1.5\r\nby Skree000\r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTE: TO BEST USE THIS MOD. Open console, type /showracemenu\r\nThis will allow you to remake your characters race entirely.\r\n*** USE WITH CAUTION, RESULTS MAY BE UNPREDICTABLE, ie. Gender/Race changing, however I have been changing my face daily and my gameplay has not been adversely affected ***\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nOngoing mod package that will transform vanilla women from hags into supermodels, one version at a time.\r\n\r\nChangelog 1.5\r\nRedid entire face texture with new software, smoother, cleaner, better\r\nRedrew smoother eyeliner mask and lip masks for lipstick\r\nAll 11 brows now replaced, with 3 new ones added in.\r\nTweaked existing brows for positioning, sharpness, alignment\r\nLips now more of a realistic specularity.\r\n\r\nChangelog 1.4\r\nLips redone and stripped out baked in spec which looked noisy and strange in some light conditions\r\nSpecmap now more intense around lips but darker almost everwhere else, while retaining ideal T-region highlights\r\nUpper eyelids tucked into match normal map position to prevent strange \\'pokey lids\\'\r\nCorners of eyes lightened to ameliorate the dark shadows\r\nSoftened entire diffuse map, was a bit too detailed allowing users to make out spots/blotches. Results\r\nshould now be noticeably more soft.\r\nSK mask adjusted to reflect new diffuse map.\r\nTweaks to lip tintmask maps to accomodate rejigged lip size.\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog 1.3\r\nSpecmap tweaks, sparkles less prominent, lips, upper cheeks and T-region subdued. Undereyes less shiney,\r\nwas turning out super shiney on some eye/race combos.\r\nSpecmap to 1024 (was 2048 erroneously)\r\nDiffuse map tweaked in T-region to reduce shiney-face, baked in reflections tamed from lips.\r\nNormals tweaked to slightly reintroduce some slight crease at sides of mouth and nose, treading carefully, idea is to return a little\r\nexpression without the hag-face, still more to go here.\r\n\r\nChangelog 1.2\r\nFace texture boosted from 512x512 to 2048x2048, Specmap to 1024. Results are VERY dramatic boost\r\nin facial realism!\r\nLip tint masks also adjusted to conform to the new lip shape\r\nSmall amount of pixie dust sparkles added to the diffuse for a little bit of glitter.\r\n\r\nChangelog 1.1\r\nEyebrows 2-6, 8,9 and 11 re-sculpted and added, since 1, 7 and 10 werent too bushy\r\n\r\nPrevious release: Faces\r\nThis initial release contains replacements for almost all female faces (currently excluding cats/lizards and beasts for now). Normal, diffuse and spec maps altered.\r\n\r\nCrows feet, laugh lines, undereye bags, brow wrinkles and ridges as well as those \\'permanent angry scowls\\' have been softened if not removed. \r\nAdditionally all forms of blockyness have also been smoothened and painted over too.\r\n\r\nNOTE: \\\"Old/Wrinkly\\\" face texture overlays were not changed, (so old women walking around town will still have old faces), but the default faces are now youthful and\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nContains:\r\nTexture replacers for faces and eyebrows in DDS format\r\n\r\nThese files overwrite those located at \\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\\r\nusing the following filenames:\r\n\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\tintmasks\\\\femaleheadbreton_lips.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\tintmasks\\\\femaleheadhighelf_lips.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\tintmasks\\\\femaleheadimperial_lips.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\tintmasks\\\\femaleheadnord_lips.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\tintmasks\\\\femaleheadredguard_lips.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\tintmasks\\\\femalenordeyelinerstyle_01.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\femalebrows\\\\femalebrow_01.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\femalebrows\\\\femalebrow_02.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\femalebrows\\\\femalebrow_03.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\femalebrows\\\\femalebrow_04.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\femalebrows\\\\femalebrow_05.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\femalebrows\\\\femalebrow_06.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\femalebrows\\\\femalebrow_07.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\femalebrows\\\\femalebrow_08.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\femalebrows\\\\femalebrow_09.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\femalebrows\\\\femalebrow_10.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\femalebrows\\\\femalebrow_11.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\bretonfemale\\\\femalehead_msn.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\darkelffemale\\\\femalehead_msn.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female\\\\femalehead_msn.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female\\\\femalehead.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female\\\\femalehead_s.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female\\\\femalehead_sk.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\femaleorc\\\\femaleheadorc_msn.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\highelffemale\\\\femalehead_msn.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\imperialfemale\\\\femalehead_msn.dds\r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\redguardfemale\\\\femalehead_msn.dds\r\n\r\n\r\ninstructions:\r\nUnpack the included files to your \\\\skyrim folder and it should automatically do the rest.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBethesda for this awesome game!\r\n",
