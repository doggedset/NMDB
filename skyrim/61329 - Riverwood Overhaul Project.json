  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Edit[/b]: I had to restart this entirely because of some loading error&#39;s, Not sure if I&#39;m going to be able to add a new Guild, but I may be able to just expand the area. I&#39;ve been real busy helping my grandmother move in and i&#39;m looking for work at the moment so I&#39;m a bit busy. I&#39;ll expand and improve on this as soon as I have time. \r<br />\r<br />I only spent  a few minutes working on it as CK tends to crash on me a lot and I can&#39;t save without closing CK (because it says I have a dialoge box open, which I don&#39;t). Anyway, it&#39;s super beta, I probably shouldn&#39;t be releasing it yet. From my experience it has a horrible loading bug, but that&#39;s probably just because of the save I used to test it (that was saved in riverwood) it could also just be a general error or something, I&#39;m not sure. The ENB I used is GS Malacath Extreme Cinematic version.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Don&#39;t bother complaining about it, it&#39;s too alpha to expect anything good from it at this point. Additionally the empty lot next to the back entrence leading up the mountain is going to be left that way because I have another mod adding a small shack there (which is pictured so in the pictures it isn&#39;t blank). I&#39;ll be including the shack in optional files when I release the next version of this mod. \r<br />\r<br />[/i][u]In the next update[/u]\r<br />[list][*][size=2]2+ NPC&#39;s[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]1 Follower[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]New Guild & Guild Hall[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Slight Environmental Alterations[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list]",
