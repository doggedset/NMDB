  "descriptionHtml": "This is I&#39;Von Bur&#39;n Stabb, a joke character my cousin created to troll my brother. Don&#39;t be fooled by his appearance, he&#39;s not an orc. He specializes in fire spells, but he&#39;s only level 6.\r<br />\r<br />This is a Vanilla save file, no mods or DLC are needed.\r<br />\r<br />This save has a messed up in-game screenshot because it is actually a converted Xbox 360 savegame and the screenshot was corrupted in the conversion process, but don&#39;t worry, the save is completely functional on the PC.\r<br />\r<br />My cousin had given me full permissions to this file.",
