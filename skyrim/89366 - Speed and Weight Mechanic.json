  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]     Is there a difference between [color=#00ffff]10[/color]% inventory and [color=#ff7700]90[/color]%? Itis not!  % change in the weight of the inventory does not affect the character in any way.\n<br />This mod changes it. It introduces the mechanics of the dependence of speed of movement and restoration of stamina on the load of inventory. \n<br />Similar you could see in the game Dark Souls 2.\n<br />    Now the load of the character affects it: the morethings you carry, the slower you move. The rate of  stamina varies, too.\n<br />Every 25% of the inventory load will change your movement speed and stamina recovery rate.\n<br />    Mod was developed for Requiem (but doesn't depend on it), so it is fully compatible and complements its mechanics of penalties from the weight of the outfit.\n<br />[/size][size=4]\n<br />[/size][size=4][center]﻿﻿Install[/center][/size][size=2][center]([i]If you play the game with requiem[/i])[/center]\n<br />[/size][size=3]Connect the mod [u][color=#ff0000]strictly[/color][/u] [b]after[/b] Requiem initializes its scripts.[/size] \n<br />\n<br />[center][size=4]﻿You need to know:\n<br />[/size][/center][size=3]Mod applies itschanges not immediately, but after 10-12 seconds.
