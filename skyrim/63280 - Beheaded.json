  "descriptionHtml": "[center]FROM THE CREATOR OF\r<br />Toothless and Furry\r<br />*dafuq? never heard of it.*\r<br />xD\r<br />\r<br />PRESENTS\r<br />\r<br />Beheaded v1.0\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />DESCRIPTION\r<br />\r<br />Well... you become beheaded.\r<br />Why? I dont know. But i made it.\r<br />\r<br />This is a very old mod i made long time ago. Still funny as he*l tho. So, check it out.\r<br />Hope to see some screenshots. xD\r<br />Cant wait to see what different characters, races and outfits with a headless character screenshots i will get. (Hope i get some.)\r<br />\r<br />Adds a equipable decapitated, headless and hairless wears.\r<br />Decapitated only equips on decapitaion slot so your head will still be visible and its gonna look like a throaght slit wound. (also cool)\r<br />By equipping headless, you will remove the head and be trully headless.\r<br />And hairless.... well, think of it as getting a clean head shaved look within a second.\r<br />\r<br />Why i made Decapitation, Headless and Hairless into 3 different clothing pieces?\r<br />Because of Utility. What utility? I dont know yet, but when it comes, you will be glad its its own piece. xD\r<br />I can make Decapitaion remove head by default if needed. Will be optional download.\r<br />\r<br />Not really a mesh guru so it doesnt exactly come with a world mesh but it uses an existing world mesh that might surprise you.\r<br />Just took that item cuz it looks cool. But its in case you drop any of those items by mistake, so they dont disappear in the world.\r<br />Its not for world placements. Just dont drop it on a big hill, gonna have a hard time getting it back. &gt;:D\r<br />Yup, while testing, dropped it from the Throath of the World. D*mn, that thing can roll. xD\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO GET IT\r<br />enter help in the console with the following items (look for them separate)\r<br />Decapitated\r<br />Headless\r<br />Hairless (Optional, You dont need it for the beheaded look.)\r<br />\r<br />Use Player.AddItem\r<br />\r<br />Why i didnt really wanted to add this in world. (model reasons, youll see)\r<br />And.\r<br />Because i didnt want to add a add item script for such a mod.\r<br />Unnecessary in my opinion. Add item command is enough.\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />REQUIREMENTS\r<br />Skyrim v1.9+ (duh)\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />RECOMMENDED INSTALL\r<br />Install with Mod Organizer &lt;3\r<br />\r<br />MANUAL INSTALL&#92;UNINSTALL\r<br />Extract the content from the .rar archive and place the files in &#34;Skyrim&#92;Data&#34; where the game is installed.\r<br />Example of default Skyrim installed location:\r<br />Windows x32\r<br />(C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;data&#92;\r<br />Windows x64\r<br />(C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;data&#92;\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />FILES AND FOLDERS\r<br />\r<br />Decapitated v1.0 readme.txt\r<br />Decapitated.esp\r<br />\r<br />Meshes&#92;theimmersion&#92;SHARED&#92;\r<br />genericworldmodel\r<br />genericworldmodelf\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />DISCLAIMER\r<br />I am not responsible for any and all damages that arise from use of this mod.\r<br />Use at your own risk&#33;\r<br />\r<br />General Permission&#33;\r<br />You can do with the mod itself what ever you want (modify, improve or simplify) for personal use only.\r<br />However, You cant include or claim as Your own any modified or unmodified files and commertialize or reupload them outside &#34;Special Permisions&#33;&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Special Permissions&#33;\r<br />You may modify, include, reupload or otherwise use the following files and folders as You see fit.\r<br />(Do remember to rename them for your own mod to avoid conflicts.)\r<br />Plugin and Scripts.

So.\r<br />I will put it as adult only content and not safe for work,\r<br />unless someone can confirm to me that this mod does not fall under those categories so the mod gets a bit more exposure.\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />Original Author: theimmersion\r<br />Other Contributors: My coffee cup with a face and a big fat smile making my day, everyday.
