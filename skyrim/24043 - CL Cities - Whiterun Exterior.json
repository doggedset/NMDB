  "summary": "A complete redecoration of the area outside of Whiterun, aimed to make it a more detailed and interesting setting.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Intended as a companion piece to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23249]my Whiterun mod[/url], this mod redecorates the path leading up to Whiterun\\'s city proper, adding in new decorations to create a smoother transition from the city\\'s outskirts to within the walls.\r\n\r\n[b]A list of changes:[/b]\r\n* Placed trees around Whiterun\\'s walls and along the path up. The forestation was intended to get thicker the further up you go.\r\n* Added a few barrels, crates, and sacks to appropriate locations, as well as the occasional hay bale.\r\n* Added a row of archery targets in front of the gates.\r\n* Placed two banners on the drawbridge house.\r\n* Decorated the front gate with the Whiterun coat of arms.\r\n* Added a cauldron and a few pots of oil to the top of the drawbridge house (Whiterun\\'s fortifications already looked like a good siege defense system, so of course I had to add this classic element.)\r\n\r\nThis mod does NOT require the main mod - you can feel free to use it with any other Whiterun mods you see fit. However, it will best match the design of my version of the city. Additionally, per request, this mod was made to be fully compatible with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28960]A1anna\\'s house mod[/url], so fear not, users!\r\n\r\nI hope to give the same treatment to all of Skyrim\\'s cities, so feel free to suggest which city to do next, as well as any features you\\'d like to see! I\\'m also open to suggestions for future releases of the cities already covered as well.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\n[b]The CL Cities Project[/b]\r\n\r\n* [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23249]Whiterun[/url]",
