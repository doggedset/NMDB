  "descriptionHtml": "Outfits for the priest, priestesses and worshippers of the Daedric Princes. All 16 Princes are covered (not including Jygallag), including both the Manic and Demented sides of Sheogorath.\r\n\r\nAll items have a male and female equivalent and are for the vanilla body. This is a stand alone re-texture and does not replace any of the vanilla outfits.\r\n\r\nSelected NPCs wear the appropriate robes to reflect their patron Daedra.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nAll clothes can be found on the quest or near the quest location of your chosen Daedric Prince.\r\nAlternatively, you can find all the clothes in a \\'Confiscated Items\\' chest at Stendarr\\'s Beacon, south-east of Riften.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nMehrunes Dagon Worshipper Male: There\\'s something up with the male Mythic Dawn robe. If I retexture it, it causes instant CTD. So currently no male version of the darker Mythic Dawn robe and it just displays the default Mythic Dawn robe for males.\r\n\r\nNPCs without shoes: Sometimes, you may encounter an NPC in a new outfit but they are not wearing shoes. This seems to occur if you have met this NPC previously before loading the mod. NPCs you have not previously encountered should be wearing their shoes.",
