Orcs can also be cute, smart and skilled, and some are even beautiful! ;)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Make sure to take a look at my new mod &gt;&gt;&gt;[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11371]Willows Whiter Teeth[/url]\n<br />More beautiful, brighter TEETH and natural+healthy mouth-colors for all RACES (+VAMPIRES, +WEREWOLFS). For all NPCs and your player characters!  \n<br />[size=3]Especially ORCs look a lot better with their new whiter teeth and improved tongue-color! :)[/size]\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Teeth1.jpg[/img]\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Feedback_2yellow.jpg[/img]\n<br /> . . . (comments, uploaded images, constructive critizism, . . .)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Official HD DLC Pack Compatibility - Step by Step Guide\n<br />If you are using the official HD_Texture_Pack you have to follow this little guide to make it compatible with my Savegame \n<br />(because the used Texture-Mods would not show up otherwise)! Dont worry - it is really simple and safe - just follow the 4 steps: \n<br />\n<br />1. Go to your Skyrim.ini, usually located in Documents/My Games/Skyrim. Make a backup!\n<br />2. In the Skryim.ini find the section called [Archive], and add the information for the HiResTexturePack.bsa files so that it looks exactly like this:\n<br />\n<br />[Archive]\n<br />sResourceArchiveList=Skyrim - Misc.bsa, Skyrim - Shaders.bsa, Skyrim - Textures.bsa, HighResTexturePack01.bsa, HighResTexturePack02.bsa, Skyrim - Interface.bsa, Skyrim - Animations.bsa, Skyrim - Meshes.bsa, Skyrim - Sounds.bsa\n<br />sResourceArchiveList2=Skyrim - Voices.bsa, Skyrim - VoicesExtra.bsa\n<br />\n<br />3. Save the .ini with the new settings\n<br />4. Disable/Delete HiResTexturePack01.esp and HiResTexturePack02.esp\n<br />You don't need them anymore to run the dlc-textures because of the above .ini changes.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Kiruna2.jpg[/img]\n<br />Kiruna is the twin Sister of my main player-character \"Claymora\". She is a loveley orc-lady and I already enjoyed about 85 hours of playing with her.\n<br />I made lots of screenshots which I shared on this site - and because my female orc got many compliments I recreated her to get a level 1 savegame \n<br />which I could share with all of you!\n<br />\n<br />Kiruna already wears a forsworn armor - I have included it in her savegame because the headdress is the perfect \"hairstyle\" for her. \n<br />(If you don't want to \"cheat\" just drop the 4 forsworn items and play a totally regular game with her)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Kiruna1.jpg[/img]\n<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; REAL DREADLOCKS Headdress retexture (see IMAGES for color examples): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5865]sexy Real Dreadlocks[/url]\n<br />NONREPLACING - all-in-ONE-file AVAILABLE (all colors - craftable (3 versions) - for all races (+beastraces) male and female!)  \n<br />My own mod to improve the look of the female forsworn headdress - Kiruna was the reason I created this mod - to make her even more beautiful \n<br />and give her a perfectly matching new haircolor (blonde,... or whichever color you prefer!)\n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Face-Skintone: [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3563]Coverwomen[/url] choose a natural version (I recommend look 3 - but you can also download the old version nr.1)\n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Body-Skintone: [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=18]No Dirty Bodies[/url] for her skin - best matching skintone for the \"coverwomen\"-face retexture\n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Eyes: [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869]Covereyes[/url] (I really like them but you can also use another type of HD-eye textures...)  \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Terrun2.jpg[/img]\n<br />Terr'un is my try to make an impressive, powerful and brave orc who doesn't look too brutal or stupid. \n<br />It wasn't an easy task (one word TEETH!) - but I think he turned out quite well!\n<br />His white hair matches his war-paint and gives him the experienced look I wanted for him. \n<br />He wears his scars proudly and maybe some day he will even tell you how he got them!\n<br />\n<br />Terr'un can be everything you want - warrior surly comes to mind - but I think he could even be a powerfull battle mage \n<br />(imagine an orc as archmage!). He is very intelligent, otherwise he wouldn't have survived that long, \n<br />strength alone can't win every fight! \n<br />\n<br />Give him a chance to be your dragonborn and experience Skyrim through his eyes!  \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Terrun1.jpg[/img][url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=26]Detailed Faces[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=256]Detailed Bodies[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=30]No More Blocky Faces[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=498]High Quality Eyes[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=334]SEAMLESS cleaner Male Skin[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2207]Telthalions Finer Hair[/url](desaturated)\n<br />\n<br />If you want him to look exactly like the pictures - download them - otherwise they are not  necessary to play with Terr'un \n<br />- he is \"pretty\" enought without any mods!  ;)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Orc_ingame.jpg[/img]\n<br />If you want to change some details of Kirunas or Terr'uns look ingame (eyecolor, warpaint, haircolor, NAME) \n<br />you can use the game console (its really easy!):\n<br />\n<br />1. to open the console use the tilde-key (~) (left side - above TAB)\n<br />\n<br />2. type in:   showracemenu\n<br />\n<br />3. klick the tilde-key again to close the console\n<br />\n<br />4. now you can change her/him to you likings in the character menu \n<br />(just like you would with a normal new character at the beginning of the game)\n<br />\n<br />5. Press R when you are finished - (re)name your character and press enter!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Enjoy Skyrim with your new orcish dragonborn!\n<br />\n<br />Thanks for downloading! \n<br />Please leave a comment if you enjoy playing with Kiruna or Terr'un \n<br />(You can also upload an image of your adventures with her/him!)\n<br />\n<br />:)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Credits to all modders who created the wonderful mods I used for character creation and screenshots. \n<br />A special THANK YOU to [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=2788925]mrLenski[/url] - I'm a big fan of his mods - they totally agree with my understanding of \"beauty\" ;)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />For more infos, mods and images visit my profile: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/938388]83Willow[/url]\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Orcs2.jpg[/img]",
