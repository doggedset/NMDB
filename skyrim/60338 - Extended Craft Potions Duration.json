  "descriptionHtml": "There are plenty of mods replacing mechanics of craftable (alchemy) potions, this one addresses &#34;stock&#34; (vendor) potions - which can be bought/looted, including those already in your inventory and those yet to be found.\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]improve all of your weapons and armor with a single blacksmith&#39;s potion[/*]\r<br />[*]enchant tons of items figuring the unique name for each with just one enchanter&#39;s potion.[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=gray]Combine with time-stretching mods for best results.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]Enchanter&#39;s Potion&#92;Draught&#92;Philter&#92;Elixir: duration 5 minutes (60 sec in vanilla)\r<br />Blacksmith&#39;s Potion&#92;Draught&#92;Philter&#92;Elixir: duration 2,5 min (30 sec in vanilla)[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]INSTALLATION:[/b] drag and drop .esp file from downloaded archive into your /data folder. Adjust loading order of .esp&#39;s so &#34;Craft Potions Duration x5.esp&#34; would be the very last on the list\r<br />\r<br />[b]UNINSTALLATION:[/b] check downloaded archive again to verify .esp file&#39;s name (Craft Potions Duration x5.esp), delete that .esp from game&#39;s /data folder. [s]Ignore the message about probably missing content when loading saved games[/s]. If you are bothered/concerned about that error message just make a &#34;clean&#34; save on new slot and don&#39;t load (occasionally delete) elder saved games. \r<br />\r<br />Very small and straightforward fix, should be totally compatible with any mods/patches/dlc installed, except those replacing the same \r<br />items. In latter case the latest mod loaded will be in effect.",
