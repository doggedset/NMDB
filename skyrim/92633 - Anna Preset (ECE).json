  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][size=4]DISCLAIMER[/size][/b]\n<br /> This is a character preset for a fairly young character (Though, definitely 18) and I recommend quite a few high-pitched voice mods, so this may not be for everyone. [/center][size=2]\n<br />[center]So, I've been modding Skyrim for 6-7 years and I've spent a lot of time trying to make my characters as cute as possible. Here's what I have so far, folks. She's a [b]female Breton[/b]. This preset may or may not be compatible with other races.[/center]\n<br />[b][size=4]\n<br />Requirements: [/size][/b][/size]\n<br />Calient's Beautiful Bodies Edition (CBBE)\n<br />Fair Skin Complexion\n<br />Enhanced Character Edit\n<br />XP32 Maximum Skeleton (version 3.93)\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Present in preset, but probably not required, but still highly recommended:[/size][/b]\n<br />Eyes of Aber or Eyes of Beauty (I THINK Eyes of Beauty is the one I've mainly been using.)\n<br />SG Female Eyebrows\n<br />SG Hair Pack\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]I've tested a Skyrim with all of the above mentioned mods (and also 'alternate start' for quicker testing purposes) and there's no issues other than there being a big issue with the torso if you install XP32MS before ECE. So, under \"Requirements\", [b]download them in the order that I listed[/b], and you should have no issues. Also be sure to [b]install XP32MS version [u]3.93[/u][/b], I don't remember what it was, but when I updated I had issues with the preset and I didn't want to fix it. Sorry for the inconvenience.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Other recommended mods for your character: [/size][/b]\n<br />Ahri Voice Replacer or Young female voice replacer (I use my own custom voice mod that is a combination of these 2 (mostly AVR), I may link that instead later, once I get permission from the uploaders)\n<br />Lore Friendly Female Anime Voice Shout\n<br />Mofu animations (there's a link on the nexus, but it's not updated completely so much that it doesnt even half of of all the animations. I highly recommend searching google for the latest version)\n<br />Pretty Jump Animations\n<br />Realistic Animation Project - Movement\n<br />Feminine Hands CBBE UNP\n<br />Customizable Camera\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Clothing/Armor/Accessory mods used in screenshots: [/b][/size]\n<br />Project Sekirei\n<br />Zlushka Stockings for CBBE\n<br />Osare Gothic Lolita - UNP\n<br />Wa Ribbon\n<br />Chevalresse II HDT-SMP\n<br />Girls Heavy Armors - CBBE\n<br />Light Bow\n<br />Dovahbling Jewelry Replacer\n<br />Ultimate Assortment\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Permissions: \n<br />[/size][/b]You can use this preset for whatever. You don't really have to mention me for credit, but it would be appreciated.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Installation: [/size][/b]\n<br />Download Winrar to unzip the file, then move it \"_1_commonTriRaces.slot\" into your CME_save folder that comes with ECE. It's typically at C:&#92;Users&#92;[Name]&#92;Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim&#92;CME_save",
