  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/3763/headereh.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[i]\\\"Two eights of days had passed since me and my cohorts split. The hit had been a sound success, and then I found myself walking along the climbing path that branches from Falkreath\\'s west entrance. Until I came across a most singular door. T\\'was hidden from sight by some vegetation, and after removing most of it, I saw the sturdy desing of ancient nords.\r\nInside I found a small room.\r\n\r\nFour months had passed since I discovered my then confortable dwelling. I did not know it\\'s purpose and the walls leaked water and the mushrooms grew everywere, but it was home and a fine hideout. I stashed my share of the loot by the chimney and dedicated my time to live the life of those who do not have to work.\r\n\r\nBut little more than five months could I enjoy that life. The Guards of Falkreath patrolled ever closer to my door, and one day I recieved proof that this activity was no coincidence. Word got to me that my old mates were falling behind bars one after the other. The treasure\\'s previous owner probably missed it a lot.\r\nIt was hard leaving everything behind, along with the gold, but I had to travel light.\r\nHalf a day\\'s journey from Falkreath something stung me like a bee: I had left a lit torch by the cave\\'s entrance! But it didn\\'t matter, after all, I couldn\\'t go back.\\\"[/i]\r\n\r\n[size=4]DESCRIPTION[/size]\r\n\r\nHello! Here I\\'ve got the result of fiddling around with the creation kit and following the site\\'s tutorials for a couple of days. It\\'s not much but maybe someone will feel comfy in there.\r\nI tried to give it an interesting, dark, and fun light setup while keeping it coherent (with real lightsources, no magical ambient light stuff).\r\nThis by no means tries to be practical (there are a couple of useful things tho), just pretty.\r\n\r\nMaybe an associated quest will come in the future, just maybe.\r\n\r\n[size=4]INSTALLATION[/size]\r\n\r\nUse NMM or simply drop in data folder and check it in skyrim\\'s laucher data files.\r\n\r\n[size=4]NOTES[/size]\r\n\r\nI have uploaded two kinds of screenshots. One with vanilla shaders and the other with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4142]Cinematic Lighting ENB[/url] post processing (the first of the pair is ENB). If you want those glowing mushrooms to look as snazzy as mine (and everything else really) get it. I made me a new pallete and tweaked some settings but it should still make your game ultra nice.\r\n\r\n[img]http://img851.imageshack.us/img851/7391/enb2012219222642copy.jpg[/img]\r\nLydia approves!
