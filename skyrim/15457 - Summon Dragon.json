  "descriptionHtml": "Before you crossed the boarder there was a mage who did nothing by the rules and never obeyed any orders, her name was Misa.\r\n\r\nThe collage only kept her around because she was particularly adept at making summoning spells this time she went all out with study and made a dragon summon.\r\n\r\nAlthough she is gone, her magic is slowly been found throughout Tamriel and the provinces... All she ever wanted was to be a exceptional mage.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSummon a Dragon Version 1.0 \r\n\r\nSummon your dragon at 0.3000 the size!\r\nNo less powerful than a normal dragon ( Not Elder just normal )\r\nMaster spell! At most 300 Majika to summon him\r\nOnly lasts 30 seconds ( To balance the scales a bit )... Scales GET IT SCALES... I made a funny...\r\nComplete book on the creation of Misa\\'s spell\r\nNo dragon death soul absorption! That\\'s right you little cheaters... Don\\'t get any ideas!\r\nSummoning Nibbles requires both hands... Use it wisely \r\n\r\nUNTESTED AND UNCONFIRMED PLEASE CONFIRM!! - Spell tome will be available in some vendors that sell Master summoner spells\r\n\r\nKnown issues :\r\n\r\n- Nibbles can fly and if you run far enough away he seems to teleport rather than walk\r\n- Companions clash with Nibbles and fight for space\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 2.0\r\n\r\nYour Dragon will fight with your for 2 Minutes!\r\n\r\nYes, that\\'s right longer fighting more blasting mayhem from Nibbles your little summoned Dragon\r\n\r\nGiven the choice to have a 30 Second spell or a more Chaotic 2 Minute version\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis spell book and diary are located outside the collage of Winterhold sitting on a Window ledge\r\nLocated here : \r\n\r\n[b]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umocaz-5WR4&feature=youtu.be[/b]\r\n\r\nI am open to comments, suggestions and any request for spells you may have Comment or PM to me.",
