One of these locations is Seer&#39;s Retreat.\r<br />\r<br />the location of Seers Retreat is in the images section.\r<br />\r<br />Now for anyone out there who is new to this mod or doesn&#39;t use the Steam Workshop or both.\r<br />This Mod doesn&#39;t affect the artifacts in any way it just opens up new versions of it.\r<br />\r<br />A side note would be that the improved Auriel&#39;s bows can&#39;t do the effect with the arrows I&#39;;; upload that mod another time and be patient please.",
