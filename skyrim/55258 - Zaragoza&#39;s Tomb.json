  "descriptionHtml": "The mod is currently being fixed as I deleted a certain file in the CK by accident that affects many dungeons and caves in Skyrim. I urge you to deactivate this mod from your game if insta. TY and I&#39;ll do my best to fix.\r<br />\r<br />Welcome to the &#34;Zaragoza&#39;s Tomb&#34; mod&#33; This mod was made for those who have made a new save to play through(although you can still [url=#]download[img]http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png[/img][/url] it since it looks good next to Riverwood). The main reason I made this mod is because I feel that there should be a few more things to do near Riverwood before heading over to Whiterun. This tomb belongs to an ancient hero who once helped the ancient nords settle near Riverwood but the actual chamber in which he rests has been made inaccessible by nature. The tomb is to the west of Riverwood 3,-11 since I&#39;m a noob.\r<br />\r<br />I plan on expanding this mod once I learn a few more things about modding so until then I will be making mods that are small and simple.\r<br />\r<br />Report any bugs please&#33;\r<br />\r<br />ENJOY&#33;&#33;&#33;",
