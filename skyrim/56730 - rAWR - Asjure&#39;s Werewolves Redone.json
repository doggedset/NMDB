  "summary": "[Currently a WIP release&#33;]  This mod includes an edit to the werewolf mesh in order to make it look much more wolf-like.  **I only reshaped the model rather than recreating it, which means any custom werewolf texture compatible with the vanilla ww model will also be compatible with mine&#33;**",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=2][b][Currently a WIP release&#33;][/b]  I decided to go ahead and release what I have so far for the people who have been looking forward to my mod.  I do still hope to finish everything I have planned for this mod eventually, but unfortunately I don&#39;t know when that will be.  But in the meantime, hopefully some players can still enjoy the new altered model I&#39;ve made. (:  I also threw in optional rough WIP textures I started playing around with for anyone interested in going for the look of my werewolf in the screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />**When I do make more progress, I will post all the updates at its mod thread here: [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/1004494-wip-rawr-asjures-werewolves-redone/]http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/1004494-wip-rawr-asjures-werewolves-redone/[/url] **[/size]\r<br />\r<br />KaikoKasumi246 has also made an edited version with NSJones&#39; awesome glowing eyes, which you can find here: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56804]click&#33;[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]Summary.[/u][/size]\r<br />[size=2]This is an esp-less replacer that changes the werewolf mesh to look much more wolf-like.  **I only reshaped the model rather than recreating in order to preserve the UV mapping, which means any custom werewolf texture compatible with the vanilla model will also be compatible with mine&#33;**\r<br />\r<br />I have also included the textures I have done for it so far, but please note that they&#39;re rough WIPs.\r<br />\r<br />This mod only needs vanilla Skyrim to work.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4][u]Installation.\r<br />[/u][/size]Simply unzip the files into your Data folder and play&#33;  If you don&#39;t want to use any of the included WIP textures, ONLY place the &#34;meshes&#34; folder into your Data folder.  To uninstall, delete the files listed below and everything will revert to the vanilla version.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to manually pick and choose, below is a list of what files belong where:\r<br />[list][*][size=2]Place malebodywerewolf_1.nif in Data&#92;meshes&#92;actors&#92;werewolfbeast&#92;character assets for the new model.[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Place eyewerewolfbeastbrown.dds and eyewerewolfbeast_g.dds in Data&#92;textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;eyes for the new eye texture to show up in-game.[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Place mouthwerewolf.dds in Data&#92;textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;werewolf to use the recolored teeth textures.[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Place werewolfhead.dds and werewolfhead_n.dds in Data&#92;textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;werewolf together for the smoothest face.  You can place werewolfhead_n.dds in the folder by itself if you&#39;d still like to use the vanilla face textures (or if you have a custom texture installed and want a less wrinkled face).  (werewolfhead.dds is an edited version of the vanilla color, so if you have a white werewolf, placing werewolfhead.dds in your &#92;werewolf folder is going to give you a dark gray face on a white body.)[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[u][size=4]Future Features.[/size][/u]\r<br />Ideally, my ultimate goal will be to redo the following:\r<br />[list][*]Rework the overall form into something unmistakably wolflike and feral, rather similar to [url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uuWSOEAIs90/ScfZL-AMkOI/AAAAAAAAAZY/gcVXD1qus2c/s1600/SH+concept+post+werewolf+Greys.png]this[/url] or [url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uuWSOEAIs90/ScfYgdDC6NI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/VcH6L19Mfxs/s1600/round3+wrwolf+jv.png]this[/url].  (Images from [url=http://joevriens.blogspot.com/2009/03/werewolf-character-design-video-for.html]here[/url].)[/*]\r<br />[*]Create new textures, probably in a variety of fur and eye colors.[/*]\r<br />[*]Overhaul the animations.  I feel that there is a lot of room for it to move more bestially, and some animations, such as the jump, look kind of silly to me.[/*]\r<br />[*]Include a female version that is gender specific (so that every ww in the game will not suddenly grow boobs and hips, even if the NPCs are male).[/*]\r<br />[*]I will attempt to give it its own MCM config as too.[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[u][size=4]Preview.[/size][/u]\r<br />What you see below is my mod in the vanilla game - no ENB, lighting enhancement, texture mods, etc.\r<br />[url=http://i.imgur.com/5syucvV.jpg][img]http://i.imgur.com/5syucvVl.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://i.imgur.com/OI3GyFY.jpg][img]http://i.imgur.com/OI3GyFYl.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://i.imgur.com/UaOuf1X.jpg][img]http://i.imgur.com/UaOuf1Xl.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />And here&#39;s a comparison screenshot I found off of Flickr.\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/6gHxWc1l.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]Misc.\r<br />[/u][/size]And I think that about covers it.  Feel free to leave me a comment if anything&#39;s unclear, I forgot to include something, etc.  I hope you all enjoy&#33;",
