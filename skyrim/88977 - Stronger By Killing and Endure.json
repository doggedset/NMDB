  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Comic Sans MS][size=5]Stronger By Killing &amp; Endure[/size][/font][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿Stronger By Killing &amp; Endure, it's a second version of this mod. I released this mod as a separated one because it is a new mod, almost everything changed and the dlcs are now longer required to play this mod. Hope you guys like it.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#ffffff][size=4]Requirements[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]SKSE\n<br />[*]SKYUI\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿The base idea of the mod hasn't changed, which is, from every single npc you kill, you get one or more bonus. From the previous mod, in order to get the bonus you would have to cast a spell on the corpse that you killed. In this version there is no need to do so, instead you can choose from four options in the MCM menu, how do you want to get those bonus.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#ffffff]Npcs are categorized in 6 types[/color][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]﻿People - (khajiit and argonians are people too, don't be racist)\n<br />[*]﻿Animals\n<br />[*]Creatures\n<br />[*]Undead\n<br />[*]Daedra\n<br />[*]﻿Automaton\n<br />[/list]   \n<br />\n<br />   ﻿By default each one of these categories that you kill, you get one or two of these bonus (health, magicka, stamina, carryweight) and a certain amount of each, But now you can customize it as you want through the MCM.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#f4f4f4][size=4][b]Bonus Receive mode[/b][/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />You can Receive Bonus from these options   \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]From Sleeping\n<br />[*]Over Time\n<br />[*]By Relaxing (LP)\n<br />[*]Immersive\n<br />[/list]   \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][font=Comic Sans MS][color=#000000]   ﻿From Sleeping[/color][/font]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />      ﻿Its as simple as get in the bed and take nape, when you wake-up you get the bonus if there are any.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#000000][size=3]   ﻿Over Time\n<br />[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />      ﻿Receive bonus now takes time. Time is measured in inGameHours and how long do you want it to take is totally up to you, since you can customize it in the MCM menu.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][font=Comic Sans MS][color=#000000]   ﻿By Relaxing (LP)[/color][/font]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />      ﻿This let you get the available bonus by relaxing using a Lesser Power that is given to you once you choose this option, (the spell is removed if you choose one of the two options above).\n<br />      ﻿Relaxing has some rules like\n<br />         ﻿- You can't relax while in combat \n<br />         ﻿- nor while you are trespassing\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#ff0000][size=4][b]   ﻿Immersive \n<br />[/b][/size][/color][/font]\n<br />      ﻿OBS: penalties are only applied to the bonus you are about to receive on that precise moment, they don't apply to the ones you already got.\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿Now this is a more complex mode, since it uses the above mechanism and improves them in a more immersive way. With this mode On, you will have to pay attention\n<br />    ﻿to certain things in order to get the FULL  BONUS,... yah that's right, the game will show you a notification at the top left corner of the screen something like this  +(0.50000/1.00000)Health. \n<br />   ﻿witch means that you could have received +1 ﻿health,  but due to something you lost half of the bonus. Well this are the things that you will have to pay attention in order to avoid penalties.\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#ffffff][size=3]Sleeping[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />   ﻿\n<br />   ﻿[b][color=#000000]   ﻿   ﻿[/color][/b][b][color=#ffffff]Have a proper sleep [/color][/b] -&gt; witch means you will have to sleep at least 6 hours. The less hour you sleep, more is the penalty applied to the bonus that you are receiving when wake-up from that BAD sleep.\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿[color=#ffffff][b]Bed time -&gt;[/b][/color] ya that's it, bed time. So sleeping in an inappropriate time will reduce the receiving bonus by 50%\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿&gt;[color=#ffffff]   ﻿[i]Non Vampires[/i][/color] - the time to go to bed is from 8pm - 4am, yah so, remember to stop by an inn for that good timing sleep.\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿&gt;   ﻿[color=#ffffff][i]Vampires[/i] [/color]- Since they are creatures of the night they can sleep from 6am - 6pm without receiving penalties.\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿[b][color=#ffffff]   ﻿[/color][/b][b][color=#ffffff]Days without sleep -&gt;[/color][/b] you can stand at maximum of 48 inGameHours without receiving this king of penalty. Passing 48 hours, this penalty will start taking place,\n<br />    ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿and it  will increase even more by each day that you don't sleep, so go to bed daily.\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />      ﻿﻿[size=3][font=Comic Sans MS][color=#ffffff]Relaxing\n<br />[/color][/font]\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿[/size]The same rules applied to the Non Immersive Relax, is applied here too,  plus these ones:\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿Relaxing know will give you a maximum of 75% of the bonus.\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿Relaxing inside a house or a cave  is better in some cases\n<br />            [i]\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿&gt;   ﻿[color=#ffffff]Non Vampires[/color][/i] - Can relaxe outside during the day time (6am - 8pm) without receiving any penalties, but relaxing outside during night time will make you \n<br />   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿receive only 50% of the respectives bonus.\n<br />\n<br />[i]   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿&gt;   ﻿[color=#ffffff]Vampires[/color][/i] - Can relaxe outside during the night time (8pm - 6am) freely, but relaxing outside, during the day time will add 50% penalty\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿\n<br />   ﻿Well since now, we only talked about half of the name of the mod (Stronger by killing), now lets talk about the endure part.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#6aa84f][size=5]Endure[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />   Obs: The penalties are cumulative\n<br />\n<br />   [size=3]Now every time you get hit in a combat, one or more of these attributes will increase. If you don't want a attribute to be modified by this mod, simple change the \"Mult\" value of the respective attribute to zero in the MCM menu:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][font=Comic Sans MS]HealRate\n<br />[/font]\n<br />[*][font=Comic Sans MS]MagickaRate\n<br />[/font]\n<br />[*][font=Comic Sans MS]StaminaRate\n<br />[/font]\n<br />[*][font=Comic Sans MS]ShoutRecoverySpeed\n<br />[/font]\n<br />[*][font=Comic Sans MS]Fire resistance\n<br />[/font]\n<br />[*][font=Comic Sans MS]Frost resistance\n<br />[/font]\n<br />[*][font=Comic Sans MS]Electric resistance\n<br />[/font]\n<br />[*][font=Comic Sans MS]Magic resistance\n<br />[/font]\n<br />[*][font=Comic Sans MS]Poison resistance\n<br />[/font]\n<br />[*][font=Comic Sans MS]Disease resistance[/font]\n<br />\n<br />[/list]   \n<br />   ﻿\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />   [font=Comic Sans MS][color=#6aa84f]HealRate[/color][/font]\n<br />      - Get this bonus from enduring a weapon hit.\n<br />\n<br />   [font=Comic Sans MS][color=#6aa84f]MagickaRate[/color][/font]\n<br />      - Get this bonus  from enduring a spell hit\n<br />\n<br />   [font=Comic Sans MS][color=#6aa84f]StaminaRate[/color][/font]\n<br />      - Get this bonus  from enduring a hit from fist, claws, fangs...\n<br />\n<br />   [font=Comic Sans MS][color=#6aa84f]ShoutRecoverySpeed[/color][/font]\n<br />      - Get this bonus  from enduring a shout from a dragon, draugrs, humans or anything that can shout\n<br />         obs: the fireBreath or blizzardBreath that dragons uses are not technically shouts, skyrim engine consider then to be normal spells\n<br />\n<br />   [font=Comic Sans MS][color=#6aa84f]Fire resistance[/color][/font]\n<br />      - Get this bonus by enduring an attack from Flame Atronachs\n<br />\n<br />   [font=Comic Sans MS][color=#6aa84f]Frost resistance[/color][/font]\n<br />      - Get this bonus by enduring an attack from Frost Atronachs and Ice Wraith\n<br />\n<br />   [font=Comic Sans MS][color=#6aa84f]Electric resistance[/color][/font]\n<br />      - Get this bonus by enduring an attack from Storm Atronachs\n<br />\n<br />   [font=Comic Sans MS][color=#6aa84f]Magic resistance[/color][/font]\n<br />      - Get this bonus by enduring an attack from Magic Anomaly and witchlights(those things that usually follows wispMothers)\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#6aa84f]Poison resistance[/color][/font]\n<br />         - Get this bonus by enduring an attack from Spiders and Chaurus and their relatives\n<br />\n<br />   [font=Comic Sans MS][color=#6aa84f]Disease resistance[/color][/font]\n<br />      - Get this bonus by enduring an attack from skeevers\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#ffffff][size=4]Some Combat actions that can decrease or increase the bonus\n<br />[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]﻿Being hit by a power attack grants you 150% of that respective bonus\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]﻿Being hit by a bash attack grants you only 50% of that respective bonus\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]﻿If you block physical attacks, the amount of bonus will be reduced for \n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]﻿Blocking with a weapon, will make you lose 66% of the respective bonus\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]﻿Blocking with a shield, will make you lose 75% of that respective bonu\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />So it is your choice if your are brave enough to not block attacks in order to get more bonus and RISC your life, or play for safe.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />OBS: remember that the amount of bonus, can be decreased by others penalties like(block, notBadTime,...) since they are cumulatives.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Well that's it, hope you guys like it.",
