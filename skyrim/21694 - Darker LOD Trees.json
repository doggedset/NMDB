  "descriptionHtml": "Darkens the super bright trees off in the distance by 30%.\r\n\r\nI created this because I use Climates of Tamriel, which includes a lighting mod. The only defect of this is the ridiculously bright looking LOD trees seen off into the distance. I took it upon myself to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe trees in the distance are actually just 2d images, so all I did was add a black layer over them with 30% opacity. It\\'s a pretty simple mod. I hope you enjoy it.",
