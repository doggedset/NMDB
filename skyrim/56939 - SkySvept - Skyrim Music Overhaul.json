  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very early version of a mod I plan to work on in my spare time. I have played Skyrim for 1000+ hours and have slowly gotten tired with the &#34;vanilla&#34; music. \r<br />\r<br />The I discovered the very talented composer, Vindsvept. Using Vindsvept&#39;s music I plan to create a mod which replaces the original score with a appropriate song from Vindsvept. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Vindsvept Links:[/b]\r<br />www.vindsvept.com\r<br />https://www.youtube.com/user/Vindsvept/featured\r<br />\r<br />Go support him as he has done 99% of the work for this mod. I just fill in the gaps and package nicely.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Disclaimer:[/b]\r<br />This mod is extremely early in development and therefore I do not recommend using it yet. This page is currently for my friends to help me with the mod.\r<br />\r<br />I am a complete N00b at modding so this is also a learning experience for myself.",
