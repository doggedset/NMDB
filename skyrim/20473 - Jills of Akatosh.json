  "descriptionHtml": "[center][/center]Name: Jills of Akatosh\n<br />Version: 1.0b\n<br />Date: 15/7/2012\n<br />Category: Animals, Creatures, Mounts and Horses\n<br />Author(s): AurianaValoria1\n<br />Source: SkyrimNexus\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=3]Just putting this out there to make it clear:\n<br />\n<br />[b][i]I will not grant anyone else permission to port my Skyrim mods to SSE. I will do it myself when I have the inclination and the opportunity.[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />I'm sorry if this decision disappoints you, but I would like to be responsible for my own mod pages and how the mods behave in the game. \n<br />\n<br />I have no idea how my mods for Oldrim will work in SSE, even after conversion, and I want to have a proper handle on that [i]myself [/i]before I put them out there for other people to use in their games.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Thanks,[/size]\n<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#B45F06][size=3]Auri[/size][/color][/font][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />Location\n<br />========\n<br />The Jills may be found near the following locations. They will not appear unless the player is level 15 or above, and there is a small chance that there will not be a Jill, only a bunny. ;)\n<br />\n<br />1) Mara's Eye Pond\n<br />2) Shrouded Grove\n<br />3) Meeko's Shack\n<br />4) Dushnikh Yal\n<br />5) Sleeping Tree Camp\n<br />6) Autumnshade Clearing\n<br />7) Froki's Shack\n<br />\n<br />Details\n<br />=======\n<br />Legend tells of the Jills - the female, dragon-formed servants of Akatosh - who repair the broken threads of time. These \"Menders of Minutes\" re-weave the sundered fabric of the Tamrielic timeline, which is often broken by events such as the use of the Elder Scrolls and the Warp in the West.\n<br />\n<br />The Jills have come to Skyrim in the wake of Alduin's return to repair the damage caused by the ravaging World Eater.\n<br />\n<br />- Jills are classified as dragons, but they are immortal.\n<br />- Jills have a soft golden glow, visible at night.\n<br />- Jills are slightly smaller than your average dragon (0.8 on the weight scale as opposed to 1.0)\n<br />- There are three subspecies of Jill: Earth, Fire, and Frost, with abilities matching their type. \n<br />- Fire Jills will start appearing first, Frost Jills later, and Earth Jills at level 35 and up.\n<br />- The Jills have voices for their shouts, but these are in a beta stage.\n<br />- Jills will fight any hostiles that are nearby...this includes everything from bandits to sabrecats.\n<br />\n<br />Install\n<br />=======\n<br />1. Extract the files to a temporary location, such as the desktop.\n<br />2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.\n<br />3. Copy files to (install folder)SkyrimData\n<br />4. Start Skyrim Launcher, click 'Data Files', place a checkmark beside the .esp file(s) - or use another load order utility of your choosing (Wrye Bash or BOSS)\n<br />\n<br />Uninstall\n<br />=========\n<br />1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file(s).\n<br />2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.\n<br />\n<br />   MeshesAuriV1AV1Jills\n<br />   TexturesAuriV1Av1Jills\n<br />   SoundVoiceAV1Jills.esp\n<br />\n<br />Incompatibility\n<br />===============\n<br />None known at this time.\n<br />\n<br />This mod has been tested and known to work with:\n<br />\n<br />1) Deadly Dragons\n<br />2) Dovahkriid - The Dragon Lords\n<br />3) Bellyache's Dragons\n<br />\n<br />Known Issues or Bugs\n<br />====================\n<br />None known at this time.\n<br />\n<br />*The voices of the Jills are still in beta status.
