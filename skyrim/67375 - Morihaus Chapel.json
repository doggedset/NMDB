  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#00ff00][size=6]~Morihaus Chapel~[/size][/color][/center][center]\r<br />\r<br />For a town that has a graveyard, but no hall of the dead, Morthal was a bit of an oddity but still very attractive place in Skyrim&#33; I&#39;m still not off my want for a good chapel to call home, so I made one here with Dragonborn and Hearthfire resources. And it&#39;s Adoption Friendly&#33; \r<br />\r<br />A worn-down and unused Chapel of Talos sits on the riverbank next to the Morthal town bridge, partially redecorated to serve as a home. Its previous tenant was exiled during the first Thalmor inquisitions, and left abandoned in Morthal for fear of Aldmeri retribution. The chapel has many weapon racks and displays, 2 mannequins, an oven and alchemy/enchantment tables. No staff enchanter or smithing amenities; JK&#39;s Morthal is compatible.\r<br />It has Hearthfire assets that make it compatible with the Multiple Adoption mod (3 beds, and really only bedrolls), hopefully keeping the atmosphere that the building was not originally intended as a home. Ah, but there&#39;s plenty of wine&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/QHsTDXI.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Fully navmeshed and TES5Edit cleaned&#33; \r<br />\r<br />I was tempted to make a dungeon to go along with it, but that might come in a later version; It&#39;s a busy summer. \r<br />[color=#ff0000]\r<br />Requirements:[/color]\r<br />- Hearthfire\r<br />- Dragonborn\r<br />[color=#ff0000]\r<br />Installation: [/color]\r<br />- One .esp, no extra files to go along with this one. Painfully vanilla.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Incompatabilities:[/color]\r<br />- Town overhauls that edit the Morthal07 exterior cell; such as ones that give Morthal big town walls.[/center]",
