  "descriptionHtml": "This is a little armor mod I put together. It makes the Ebony Chainmail (Ebony Mail), light armor . It is better than glass, but a little worse than dragonscale. It thought it was kinda wierd it was heavy becuase it was more aimed at sneaky characters. This mod also adds a armor set that is Ebony Chainmail and Nightingale boots, gloves, and hood (thought it looked awesome). There is a unechanted version that is craftable(under ebony), and enchatable. Both are temperable Hope you enjoy it.\r\n How to get:\r\n-Craftable under ebony (unechanted)\r\n-Elicor\\'s Armor (enchanted) can be found in the DB Hideout near Falkreath. The chest in under water, but needs a key. Give you a hint it is in the first room. \r\nThis armor will only be available via the two ways listed above\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis is also available on Steam.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPlans for the future:\r\n- Custom perk for when wearing full set\r\n- Different way for getting it like a boss battle\r\n- Maybe a quest still a newbie in the creation kit, but ill try\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAnyway this is my first mod so go easy on me.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUpdate 1: Changed enchantments, name of enchanted version (Elicor\\'s Armor), and name of Ebony Mail (Ebony Chainmail).\r\n",
