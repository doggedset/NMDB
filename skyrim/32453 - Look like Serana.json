  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple mod that will allow you to create, \\\"or change with the \\'showracemenu\\' console command,\\\" a character that is identical to Serana, \\\"minus the hair and red eyes.\\\" Just select the LAST Breton female preset.\r\n\r\n I made this for myself because I couldn\\'t find a similar mod on the nexus. I have no experience making mods, but creating a copy of an NPC via the Creation Kit is pretty simple. \r\n\r\nIf your Serana looks different than the one in my game, it is because I am using additional mods that modify hair and face textures. These additional mods can be found here. \r\n\r\nBetter Females by Bella - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\nApachiiSky Hair - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\n\r\nThere shouldn\\'t be any compatibility issues and load order wont matter. I would recommend placing the .esp high in your load order though, just in case. Use NMM for instillation or just put the .esp in your data file.\r\n",
