  "descriptionHtml": "From the mod author who brought you &#34;No More Bee Sounds&#34;, I present, &#34;No More Bug in Jar Sounds&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />When I first made the No More Bee Sounds mod, I did it out of annoyance at the droning noise in my Hearthfire greenhouse, and assumed that others were annoyed too. However, I have come to understand that a lot of people who downloaded that mod did so not only out of annoyance, but out of a real life dislike of bugs and bees. That said, I hope this is another modification that will help some of you breathe easier while playing. If you have anything similar to this you&#39;d like to see, please feel free to contact me.\r<br />\r<br />If you play an alchemist, apothecary, nature-loving character, or just enjoy adding some entomologic decor to your home, but don&#39;t enjoy the constant buzzing noise that the bugs-in-jars make, this mod is for you. Like my previous mod, I&#39;ve simply gone into the Creation Kit and removed the actual sound that the bugs in jars make. If you want them back, just uninstall the mod. It&#39;s compatible with everything and shouldn&#39;t alter any gameplay.Â \r<br />\r<br />Note that this mod leaves in the regular bee sounds. (The ones that aren&#39;t in a jar.)\r<br />If you want those removed too, please see [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67215/?]No More Bee Sounds[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Thank you, and enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Note: I&#39;m the original author of this mod, but I&#39;ve switched to this account and reuploaded because there is no way to change usernames in Nexus.",
