  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=3]This video was made earlier, but since that not so much changed at YT for authors, and especially small channels like mine. Monetization income was severely cut and that raises a huge threat on my work as a part of modding community. But there's a way to help me keep running (which is completely up to you of course). Cheers![/size]\n<br />[youtube]hJ9vEi4IqFU[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[size=4][center][b]Two [/b][color=#ff7700]MILLIONS[/color][b] views! This is awesome!\n<br />Thank you so much for your support guys![/b]\n<br />Guide for[b] [/b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/82945]MAGES[/url][b] [/b]is here.\n<br />Check out [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77928]GAMEPLAY GUIDE[/url] here.\n<br />My [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/48448]OBLIVION GAMEPLAY GUIDE[/url]﻿ is here.\n<br />Please read \"FAQ\" and \"How to start &amp; stability\" before start modding!\n<br />Join our [url=https://discord.gg/XjyJvxP]Discord server[/url] to have modding chatting and advices.\n<br />[youtube]da3oVpuGWYM[/youtube][/center][/size]\n<br />[center][/center][b][color=#ff7700][size=3]About this guide:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[font=Tahoma][color=#9fc5e8][size=4]This is a result of monthes of modding Skyrim. Initially I wanted just to make my mod list as people asked for this at my YT channel, but then I decided to put some more efforts into this and make a complete guide to save other people time that they can have a complete base list of mods for ultrarealistic graphics, knowing how much these mods will affect on performance and in what order they should install the mods. Skyrim have thousand of mods here at Nexus and there's very hard to check them all, but I spent some time and did this - from the 1st till the last page (I'm not joking hehe) of all the graphic mods here and chosen almost everything you need to transform your game and also to have some variants of similar mods to choose from. List of 500+ mods (but at the same time \"quality about quantity\", including different variants to choose from) to install to make your Skyrim graphics look nextgen and to leave as few ugly vanilla objects as possible. Install order, performance influence and patches list included. \n<br />The mod list consists of two parts. Mods from the first part should be installed in strict install order. Mods from the second part can be actually installed in any isntall order, but to have the best result I kindly advise to install them in the same order as in the guide. Also you can check the videos at my [url=https://www.youtube.com/sinitargamingftw]YT channel[/url] to see how game can look when fully-modded. All the mods are marked with one of 3 colors. [/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#38761d][size=4][b]Green[/b][/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#9fc5e8][size=4] means this mod is pretty FPS-friendly, [/size][/color][/font][color=#f1c232][b][font=Tahoma][size=4]Y[/size][/font][font=Tahoma][size=4]ellow[/size][/font][/b][/color][font=Tahoma][size=4][color=#9fc5e8] - it can affect performance, but still not an FPS-killer, and [/color][b][color=#cc0000]Red[/color][/b][color=#9fc5e8] mods are really FPS-hungry. To make guide navigation easier, I placed guide sections into so called \"spoilers\" - when you see Spoiler button - just click on it to expand corresponding group of mods. Click again to close it :) Please also note that this guide is still designed for modern rigs. I have GTX 980 4GB and 16GB RAM and running all these mods with ENB having 60 fps indoors and 40-55 outdoors with ENB. If you like this guide, please download the .zip archive to be able to leave an endorsment :) This archive also contains all .ini files needed and already pre-tweaked if you don't want to insert values yourself. Depending on your PC, you will need to make just a few little adjustments to some of values - this is described in readme file. Also feel free to suggest any mod you want to see in this list or ask me any compatibility/stability questions I'm running Skyrim without any crashes with about 750 mods installed - and you can have even more and still have your game 100% stable. That's not some kind of exaggeration - everything you need is to follow the guide attentively :)[/color][/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Tahoma][size=3]Ever wanted [/size][/font][font=Tahoma][size=3]to support me?[/size][/font][font=Tahoma][size=3]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[url=https://www.patreon.com/SinitarGaming][img]https://i.imgur.com/1n5DoL7.png[/img][/url][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=5][b]Permissions:\n<br />[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=4]I don't give a permission to re-upload this to other sites by any other person, if you like this guide and want to share it please just add a link to this page instead or link the YT video.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][b][color=#ff7700][size=5]Guide features:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][font=Arial][size=3]Complete list of graphics, weather and accompanying mods, more than 500 in total.

This is a guide - it gives you an ability to compare and choose. Open mod pages, browse the images, read the description. Install what you like and don't install what you don't like :)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] I also want to install ENB, where's a tips for it?\n<br />[color=#1e84cc]A:[/color] Sure! Whatever you want - it is here ;) Just read a bit further.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] I got infinite loading screen/my game crashes/I have enourmous stutters and FPS drops.\n<br />[color=#1e84cc]A:[/color] Please read \"How to start &amp; stability\" section carefully. Read it and install all the things needed before starting to install mods themselves.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] That doesn't help!\n<br />[color=#1e84cc]A:[/color] Trust me, if you have read everything carefully and installed, it will solve all your problems in 99% of cases. If not, feel free to ask in comments, or better join our [url=https://discord.gg/PYNjv82]Discord server[/url] and community members or I will try our best to help you :)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] Where are you from? A few words about you?\n<br />[color=#1e84cc]A:[/color] Ukraine. 28 years old. Gamer, retarded slavic youtuber youtuber and gym addict. Web-developer in past, fitness trainer and nutritionist now (as hobby).\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] Would you expand this guide and add this/that?\n<br />[color=#1e84cc]A:[/color] Sure! That's why I made version 2.0. And for sure, I will update and improve it. Unstoppably. :)\n<br />\n<br />[/size][color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] Ok, guide just received massive update, but how can I see the little new additions?\n<br />[color=#1e84cc]A:[/color] I add mods and fix text errors few times per week. All the mods freshly added to the guide will be marked with red-colored \"[color=#ff0000]==[color=#ff0000]NEW==[/color][/color]\" sign.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] Can you just upload your Skyrim folder with all your mods somewhere so I can just download it and not to choose and install mods one by one?\n<br />[color=#3d85c6]A:[/color] Unfortunately, no. The reasons:\n<br />Firstly - I can't do this as many mods from the list are Nexus-exslusive and mod authors didn't give a permission to re-upload their works somewhere. I respect their work.\n<br />Secondly - everyone has absolutely different PC specs, and my setup can be absolutely unplayable for many people.\n<br />Trust me - when you're making your mod setup by yourself the result will be way better because most of mods are absolutely matter of taste.\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=3][b]Now, the first and most important rule. Keeping it will drive you to the peaks of glory with 700 mods and 100% stable game.\n<br />[/b][/size][/center][center][img]https://i.imgur.com/EdnaAuf.jpg[/img]﻿﻿[/center]\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=5][b][center][img]https://i.imgur.com/zMCHpRu.png[/img]﻿[/center][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][color=#ff7700][size=3]1) Download and install mod manager.[/size][/color][/font][size=3]\n<br />Choose between [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager]Nexus Mod Manager[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334]Mod Organizer[/url]. Both of them are awesome. I personally use NMM. Almost all mods can (and should) be installed via mod manager. Do not install mods manually. The guide contains notices regarding some exceptional cases when you'll need to install some mod/part of mod manually, but for the 99.9% of cases - always use mod manager.\n<br />[color=#e06666]IMPORTANT NOTE #1: [/color]Do not use MO2 (Mod Organizer version 2, the new one). Use the MO version linked above. MO2 is still WIP and it has plenty of bugs in it. I also won't be able to provide any troubleshooting support if you're using it.\n<br />[color=#e06666]IMPORTANT NOTE #2:[/color] Nexus Mods team is currently developing new mod manager called [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1]Vortex[/url]. It's already looking good and is very user-friendly, but it's still in alpha, which means it may have various bugs. It's working fine, but until it's not released oficially, I won't be able to provide any troubleshooting support if you're using it. My advice atm is to track it and test it by modding some other games.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]2) Download and install [/color][url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url][color=#ff7700]. If you allready have it - great, if no - install it. It's obligatory.\n<br />[/color]SKSE (Skyrim Script Extender) is must-have for playing modded Skyrim. Most of all popular gameplay mods need it to be installed. Also, almost all memory/stability tweaks and fixes require it. Install it to your Skyrim root directory (not the data folder), where your TESV.exe is. [color=#ff7700]Important![/color] From this time, you should launch and play your Skyrim only using SKSE.exe. Skyrim launcher will be used only for disabling/enabling mods (but this also can be done via mod manager).[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3]3) Go to /data/SKSE and open SKSE.ini. If there's no /skse folder and/or .ini file in it, create an empty SKSE.ini file OR go [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51038]here[/url]. Download and install the file, which is actually SKSE.ini one (this can be done by mod manager).[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3]Delete EVERYTHING in skse.ini you have now, then paste these lines in it and save (you do NOT need to insert SKSE memory patch value, look further):[/size]\n<br />[color=#00ffff][General]\n<br />ClearInvalidRegistrations=1\n<br />EnableDiagnostics=1\n<br />[Display]\n<br />iTintTextureResolution=2048\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[size=3][color=#ff7700]4) Download and install[/color] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863]SkyUI[/url]. Most of popular mods require SKSE and SkyUI. Also install [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3222][size=3]iHUD[/size]\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][color=#ff7700]5) Download and install [url=https://loot.github.io/]LOOT[/url].\n<br />[/color]LOOT is a must-have tool if you planning to have many mods. It's very easy to install and use.\n<br />His most basic and important function is mod sorting. Many mods should be loaded in strict load order. This mod should be loaded before that mod, but after that, and so on. LOOT makes miracles! You can automatically sort all your mods properly by just clicking button 2 times. Sometimes (it happens rare, so mostly you won't to think about it) some mods have direct instructions about how they should be loaded, in this case it's also easy to sort them manually using it. Also, LOOT shows you all you need to know about your mods instlalled - errors, missing records etc. In many cases, if something is not right - it will let you know and it will advise you. Actually, you'll not need to read and lean more than this to use it, but if something is unclear or you want to look at very in-depth guide, check this awesome [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzoyWugzZAw]Gopher's video[/url]. Use LOOT sorting each time after you've installed a few mods.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]6) Download [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859]TES5edit[/url].\n<br />[/color]It's an awesome tool for cleaning your mods. Mods may contain \"dirty\" records and some other issues. And when you will have hundreds of mods, that could be a problem and cause crashed. Clean all mods that have dirty records (until it's directly written by mod author to not do that for some reasons) and all Skyrim DLCs. This step and tools usage are not obligatory, but strongly recommended. Don't be afraid of it, it's not so hard to use as it may look. Check this one awesome [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw3g_N1jcZQ]video guide by Gopher[/url]. Also there are a lot of info and videos at it's Nexus page.[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3]7) Download and install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1840]Wrye Bash[/url].\n<br />[/size][/color][font=Arial]Amazing and essential tool to achieve maximum possible compatibility between all your mods and decrease amount of plugins in your order, giving you possibility to install much more mods.[/font]\n<br />[font=Arial]We will use it in the end of our journey, so just grab it and don't use it for now. I'll explain everything later in the guide :)[/font]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3]8) Install [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72725]Crash Fixes[/url].[/size]\n<br />[/color][font=Arial]The best and most up-to-date mod to prevent almost all of game engine crashes! It's light-weight, one-click to install (using mod manager) and...it just works. No-no, it works for real. You'll notice faster loading and zero or almost zero crashes. Also it replaces SSME/SKSE memory patch, Safety Load and work much better and more easy to configure. [/font][color=#e06666][b]YOU SHOULD NOT USE CRASH FIXES MEMORY ALLOCATION TOGETHER WITH SSME/SKSE/SAFETY LOAD MEMORY PATCHES AND/OR THEIR .INI SETTINGS. DELETE THEM. DON'T USE THEM. USE CRASH FIXES MEMORY ALLOCATION ONLY[/b].[/color][font=Arial] I'm not supporting those who will somehow have both installed. After you installed it via mod manager, do the next:[/font]\n<br />[font=Arial]1) [/font][color=#ff7700]Install[/color] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75795]THIS ONE[/url][color=#ff7700]. Download, unzip and place [/color][color=#00ffff]D3DX9_42[/color][color=#ff7700] file to your Skyrim folder (where your TESV.exe is, not in the /data folder).[/color]\n<br />[font=Arial]2)[/font][color=#ff7700] Go to [/color][font=Arial]/data/SKSE/plugins/CrashFixPlugin.ini[/font][color=#ff7700] and open it with any text redactor (notepad for example).[/color]\n<br />[font=Arial]3) [/font][color=#ff7700]Find and set UseOSAllocators to 1 ([/color][color=#00ffff]UseOSAllocators=1[/color][color=#ff7700])[/color]\n<br />[font=Arial]4) [/font][color=#ff7700]Find and set CustomMemoryBlock to 1 ([/color][color=#00ffff]CustomMemoryBlock=1[/color][color=#ff7700])[/color]\n<br />[font=Arial]5) [/font][color=#ff7700]Find and set MemoryInfoConsole to 1 ([/color][color=#00ffff]MemoryInfoConsole=1[/color][color=#ff7700])\n<br />[/color]The next two steps you will need to [b]repeat[/b] several times during the modding process. Please don't forget about this.\n<br />[font=Arial]6) [/font][color=#ff7700]Launch Skyrim, fast travel to some populated/fps heavy place and open console with \"~\" button.[/color]\n<br />[font=Arial]7) [/font][color=#ff7700]Look on maximum memory block load. There will be a lot of messages like \"blah-blah-blah maximum block load XX %\". If the maximum value is 90% or higher - exit game and find CustomMemoryBlockTotalSizeMb value in CrashFixPlugin.ini. Set it a bit higher (for example, if it was 110, set it to 120), save the .ini file changes, launch Skyrim and check memory block load again. Do this until maximum load won't be higher that 85-90% (check this in populated towns or combat).[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3]9) Install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76747]Bug Fixes[/url]﻿.\n<br />[/size][/color][font=Arial]This essential mod fixes several bugs (some of hwich are just annoying and one is pretty balance-breaking) that were not fixed by any other mods.[/font]\n<br />[font=Arial]One-click install-and-forget.[/font]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ff7700]10) Install[b] [/b][/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557]Alternate Start - Live Another Life[/url][b] or [/b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71465]Skyrim Unbound[/url][color=#ff7700].[/color][/size]\n<br />[font=Arial]Why you need this? These mods provide wide amount of alternative starts the game for those who do not wish to go through the lengthy intro sequence at Helgen. The thing is that vanilla start (scene in Helgen) is VERY heavy-scripted. And when you will install let's say, 200+mods and start a new game, your Skyrim will be very heavy overloaded. And there's very high chance that your came will crash, even if it's absolutely stable. And now these mods save the day! You can just skip this heavy-scripted scene and start anywhere you like. Besides, it has a really wide amount of alternative start, great for roleplay. I personally advise to use [/font][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71465]Skyrim Unbound[/url][font=Arial], but it's absolutely up to you.[/font]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e06666][size=3][b]NEXT 5 STEPS ARE OPTIONAL. PLEASE READ ATTENTIVELY.[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][b][size=3]11) Read this [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48387]article[/url]. This is not obligatory, but it works and it's very useful.[/size]\n<br />[/b][/color][color=#ff0000]IMPORTANT! [/color][font=Arial]Use its settings only if you're 100% understand what you're doing. If you're very new to .ini files tweaking, don't use it. It's absolutely optional. Messing with these values is not a joke. Once again, If you think something is unclear for you, don't use it. And if you'll use it, don't use the .dll files describied in it, only \"play\" with Skyrim.ini settings preferably with Ugrids=5 (original value). As an alternative, you cna just use my Skyrim .ini files where this step is already done, but depending on your PC specs you maybe will need to adjust one value, which is mentioned in readme file and described in the article itself. Alternatively, my Skyrim.ini file already has these tweaks - you will only need to change one value in it if you have different VRAM amount.[/font]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3][b]12) Download [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52363]Save game script clea[/url][/b][/size][/color][color=#ff7700][b][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52363]ner[/url]. YOU DON'T NEED TO USE IT UNTIL THE NEXT CONDITIONS:[/size]\n<br />[/b][/color][size=3]This is not obligatory. If you will not uninstall scripted mods in the middle of playthrough, you don't need it. If you uninstall mods that contain scripts in the middle of playthrough and then save game, so called \"orphan scripts\" will be still in your save file even mods with that scripts are already gone. This can cause crashes. It's just a save cleaner if your save is really near to dead cause of orphan scripts.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][font=Arial][size=3][b][color=#ff7700]13) Download [/color][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90987]Mator Smash[/url][color=#ff7700].[/color][/b][/size][/font]\n<br />A new and simply badass tool! It works similar to Wrye Bash in some meaning - helping to resolve various mod conflicts to make them more compatible. It's pretty easy in usage - just read the mod page and overall instruction attentively. It can (and I'd say should) be used together with Bashed Patch for the perfect results. Though, if you're planning (at least for now) to have only graphics mods - you don't need it so much. But if you're aimed on heavy mod list with both graphics and a lot of gameplay mods - this amazing tool will be your good friend. SMASH the conflicts! Read this quick [url=http://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/Mator_Smash_Quick_Start]beginner's guide[/url] about it as well.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#ff7700][size=3][b]14) Download [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69905]Merge Plugins[/url].\n<br />[/b][/size][/color][/font]You will need this if you'll make really heavy load order and reach the 255 plugins (.esp) limit. This amazing tool can technically allow you to have almost endless amounts of mods intalled, so you will be limited only by your PC specs and mods themselves (meaning no using broken/dangerous mods and not overloading your game with script-heavy mods). It easily merges plugins into one .esp file, drastically decreasing the total amount of plugins and allowing you to install more and more mods. For A to Z simple tutorial about using it, watch this amazing [url=https://youtu.be/0S6cpCwTezE]video[/url] and follow the steps.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][b][color=#ff7700]15) Download [/color][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12801]Ordenator[/url][color=#ff7700]. You will not need it in most of cases if you have decent PC.\n<br />[/color][/b][/size][/font]That's an amazing tool for compressing your textures to lower resolution, and also optimizing them (even without changing resolution) with zero quality loss in 99% of cases. Answering the possible question - no, Ordenator is NOT dangerous to your game or textures. If you heared such info somewhere - it's just a misleading gossips. If you will have FPS issues - Ordenator can help a lot by optimizing or compressing your textures. Refer to \"advices and tricks for low-end rigs\" in that case (but ofc you can use it to gain fps even if your rig is strong).\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3]16) The last, but important and mandatory step.[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3]Install all these amazing mods/patches/fixes which are oriented on fixing huge amount of various little bugs or irrational things in game or just to make you your game much more comfortable.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71214]Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch\n<br />[/url]This mod should be already considered as part of vanilla game. Result of years of hard work, it fixes litereally thousands glitches and bugs in Skyrim.\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57353]Optimized Vanilla Textures[/url]\n<br />Mod optimizes the vastly majority of original game textures, increasing performance without quality loss.\n<br />Use HD version and [color=#ff7700]disable/delete Hight Resolution Texture Pack and Unofficial High Resolution Patch[/color] (it's mostly just a terrible upscale and it just waste VRAM without any visual improvement)+ don't forget to run \"Textures install\" in your /data folder ([url=https://pp.vk.me/c626517/v626517395/16c55/bQEFnEBQQII.jpg]here it is[/url]).\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/91069]Skyrim Supplemental Patch[/url]\n<br />Astonishing and scrupulously made, must-have patch which corrects hundreds of errors and glitches in Skyrim worldspace.

There will be a few cases when you not need to overwrite some files or you need to install texture partially/manually, but I will notify about it. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][b]Important tip #2:[/b][/size][/color] To install 200 mods and then launch your game is not a best idea. I personally recommend to do in this way: install a few mods (let's say 2-4 if these mods are big, 5-10 if small), sort them with LOOT, launch your game, check it's stable. Install 5 more and so on.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][b]Important tip #3:[/b][/size][/color] Don't use 4k textures untill you have 4k monitor with Titan videocard and you're not aiming for screenarchery (like shoting a bugs or leaves). You won't see any difference between 4k and 2k textures until you come absolutely closely to them. 2k is perfect option for 1920 and even higher (2k) monitors. Using 4k you'll waste tonns of VRAM but won't notice this actually. Using 2k will save tonns of VRAM and you're still having beautiful textures. The only where you can install 4k textures are interior cells (caves/mines etc) as interior use much less VRAM and some underground creature retextures (Dwemer/Falmer) due to the same reasons. If your PC is not the strongest, or you just want to save some VRAM for something else - for example, super-fps-hungry ENB preset or 3D LODs from DyndoLOD, you can use even 1k textures for most of exteriors. Graphics quality will be just fine.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][b]Q:[/b][/color] But why \"waste\" of VRAM?\n<br />[color=#1e84cc][b]A:[/b][/color] It's pretty simple. Texture is basically a square img file. Most of people are used to think that 2k uses x2 more VRAM then 1k, and 4k uses x4 more VRAM then 1k, for example. But as texture img is a square, we will receive a bit different values. 1x1=1. 2x2=4. 4x4=16. So as you can see, 2k textures actually use x4 more VRAM compared to 1k, and 4k use x16 more VRAM, which is absolutely insane.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][b][size=5]Let's go!\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b][/color][center][img]https://i.imgur.com/pOLfYuk.png[/img]﻿[/center]\n<br />[size=2][color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] What is ENB? Why I ever need it?\n<br />[color=#3c78d8]A:[/color] *Lights up a smoking pipe*.\n<br />Ok, listen, young padavan. ENB is a graphical enhancement engine that adds visual affects that are not supported by the game initially, at all. Proper antialiasing, real HDR, qualitative bloom, godrays, ambient fog effects, dozens of shaders for water, skin, weapons, armors and other objects, parallax (3D-looking objects), ambient occlusion, depth of field and much-much more. ENB is also a PC-only engine - that's why modded Skyrim graphics are looking so superior compared with Skyrim graphics on consoles.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] But wait. Right now? In the first place? Why? You had this step in the very end of the guide before.\n<br />[color=#3c78d8]A:[/color] Yes, it was in the end, but I became more expirinced and wiser and I want to give you guys the really best possible modded game ever. The reason is pretty simple. ENB for Skyrim also has so-called \"enboost\", a pack of special settings in enblocal.ini file which allow Skyrim to use ALL your video memory. That's why, it directly affects stability of your game.\n<br />Secondly, as you may already read in previos paragraph, ENB has absolutely unique and superior visual effects. Long story short, Skyrim with decent ENB and with no graphics mods at all will always look much better than Skyrim with even 300 graphics mods, but without ENB. That's why ENB should be installed in the first place - to give you stability and to see how much it affects your FPS so you can understand how to build your graphics setup around it.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] Ok, but I was not planning to use an ENB, still. What now?\n<br />[color=#3c78d8]A:[/color] There are a lot of performance-friendly ENB presets. One guy from my Discord is running ENB on GXT 285. No kidding. It's just all about tweaks. But even for some strange reasons you won't use ENB, you still need to use ENB binaries (i.e. core) and ENBoost, to have your game 100% stable and running smooth. In other words, for Skyrim, ENB is a superior graphics enhancer and stability booster at the same time.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] How much FPS will ENB eat? How do I know that?\n<br />[color=#3c78d8]A:[/color] First of all, you need to understand that ENB is ofc FPS-hungry and as it interracts with objects in game and adds a lot of visual effects, ENB performance will depend on many factors - how much texture mods are installed, what our PC specs are etc. But ENB effects are totally and more than worth their price :)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] But what about weather/lighting mods? ENB preset I want to use requires that weather mod!\n<br />[color=#3c78d8]A:[/color] Don't worry. You can install weather/lighting mods required anytime. Weather/lighting \"incompatibility\" with ENB will not cause crashes, it's just about how the ENB colors and other effects are looking the best possible exactly with required weather/ligting mods.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Q:[/color]My PC/laptop is pretty weak and ENB gives me a lot of stutters!\n<br />[color=#3c78d8]A:[/color] Either use enb binaries only + enboost to have only the stability/VRAM improvements (explained below), or refer to the end of the guide where I prepared a section especially for low-end PCs - most likely it will allow you to use ENB even if your PC is pretty weak.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][color=#ff7700]Q:[/color] I saw your videos and I like that ENB, what's the name?\n<br />[color=#3c78d8]A:[/color] I'm using the amazing [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41482]Rudy ENB[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][b]Follow these steps to install ENB and make some tweaks'n'tricks for stable game and proper memory usage:\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size][/color][font=Arial][color=#ff7700][b]1) Turn off the effects that will be replaced by ENB. \n<br />[/b][/color][size=2]Open Skyrim launcher and turn off Antialiasing, Anisotropic Filtering, and FXAA.\n<br />In your videocard driver/control panel, set the features from previous step and Ambient Occlusion (SSAO) to \"Application-Controlled\" (Nvidia) or \"Use application settings\" (AMD). [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][b]2) Download ENB core files [url=http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.html]here[/url]:[/b][/color]\n<br />[size=2]Read your ENB preset description page and download the latest version if it supports it. If no, download the needed one. Place [u]d3d9.dll[/u] AND [u]enbhost.exe[/u] from the \"wrapper\" folder to your Skyrim root folder, where your TESV.exe is located (not the data folder!)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][b]3) Open your Skyrimprefs.ini (with notepad for example).[/b][/color]\n<br />[size=2]Make sure the following values at the [DISPLAY] section are exactly the same as below. If no - set them to this values, if they are not exist - just paste them there. Then save your Skyrimprefs.ini.[/size]\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=2]bFloatPointRenderTarget=1 \n<br />bTreesReceiveShadows=1\n<br />bDrawLandShadows=1\n<br />bShadowsOnGrass=1\n<br />iMultiSample=0 \n<br />iMaxAnisotropy=1 \n<br />bFXAAEnabled=0 [/size][/color]\n<br />Alternatively, you can just use my .ini files that you can find in the \"Files\" tab of the guide page.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]4) Choose an ENB preset you like (list below) and place its files to your Skyrim root folder (the same where your TESV.exe and ENB core files are). [/color][color=#e06666]Unlike regular mods, ENB should be unpacked and installed MANUALLY.[/color]\n<br />[/b][size=2]There are so many of them, beautiful and stunning! Yeah, if you're still not decied, it will be quite a dilemma ;) My advice is to click on \"last updated\" option to sort the preset pages, as many of \"most endorsed\" presets are outdated. Also, my favourite ENB presets are all placed in the beginning of the list, so if you trust my opinion - on these you should take a look for sure. But of course it's up to you.\n<br />Different ENB presets have different weahter/lighting mods requirments. Read the chosen ENB preset page attentively.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][b]5) Download and install [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38649]ENBoost[/url]. If you're using latest ENB, update it with the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73618]newest ENBoost fixes[/url].[/b][/color]\n<br />[size=2]In most of cases, you won't need to change many in enblocal.ini. You need to set the memory value in  of [u]VideoMemorySizeMb[/u] at the [MEMORY] tab according to your videocard strength. To make this task easier and know your total amount of video memory (it's not the videocard memory only actually), use this simple [url=http://enbdev.com/download_vramsizetest.htm]software[/url]. Download it, unpack and run the DX9 version (not the DX11). That's a value you need.\n<br />To calculate the [u]VideoMemorySizeMb[/u] value needed and for overall guide about enblocal settings look [url=http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:ENBlocal_INI/Memory]here[/url].\n<br />[/size]Alternatively, and if you don't want to learn about each value - just use my enblocal.ini that you can get from my ini pack at guide page \"Files\" section. There, you will only need to change memory value line up to your videocard.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700][size=3]6) This is very important! [/size][/color][color=#e06666][size=3]NEVER replace your enblocal.ini file.[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Most of ENB presets have their own enblocal.ini files, but you don't need them. Yes - just grab everything besides the enblocal.ini if you already have it tweaked. The thing is enblocal.ini, as you may already understood, contains mostly only technical/memory settings and moreover these memory settings are set up to YOUR videocard. If you will oeverwrite it with another enblocal, which obviously will have different settings, your ones will be screwed up and this will cause lags/crashes etc.\n<br />There are only two values that you need to check and copy only the values (lines from ENB preset enblocal to your enblocal).\n<br />- [color=#00ffff]ProxyLibrary=[/color]\n<br />- [color=#00ffff]LodBias=[/color]\n<br />The values may be different from preset to preset - if they will be, just copy and paste them to your enblocal.ini, replacing your current ones.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][b]7) If you're changing ENB presets often, download this [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7804]tool[/url] to avoid the errors and weird effects.[/b][/color][/font]\n<br />It automatically cleans your Skyrim folder from all ENB files (this is needed when you need to install other preset). But almost all modern ENb presets have only 2 .ini files and 1 folder. It's not that hard to place or remove them :)\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/0DGWs5A.png[/img]﻿[/center]\n<br />[size=3][spoiler]\n<br />To choose an ENB preset is absolutely matter of taste. However, in this list I've included the most fresh presets that work with latest ENB binaries. You can also take a look at my \"Best of All Times\" ENB [url=https://youtu.be/FYZagspW8UM]comparison video[/url].\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Remember[/color] that ENB itself will eat some FPS almost at any rig. Sometimes it can cost you 0-5 FPS (so we can say you have no performance loss) up to 20-30 FPS - it all depends on your PC power.\n<br />All presets are also markered with one of 3 colors: [color=#38761d][size=3][b]Green[/b][/size][/color], [b][color=#f1c232][size=3]Yellow[/size][/color][/b] or [color=#cc0000][size=3][b]Red[/b][/size] [/color][size=2]depending on their performance impact[/size], so you'll be aware if this or that preset is an FPS-killer. And of course short description and weather/lighting mods compatibility tips. \n<br />If you see that you have let's say stable 55-60 FPS with any of \"yellow\" ENB presets - you can run almost any ENB preset, even hungry one and be sure that your game will be stable and you will not face noticable stutters and FPS drops. But if you have like 30 FPS - you'll need to think about the ENB - to install performance-friendly one, or refer to \"low-end\" section (in the end of the guide), or not to install ENB at all and only use ENBoost (the very last option, if you're following the guide attentively and don't have a complete potato instead of PC, you won't need this option).\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Regarding the lighting mods compatibility:[/color] Many lighting mods also have their own weather modules. Don't use these modules even if ENB is compatible with this lighting mod. Don't. Use. Lighting mods weather modules. Also, combination of Relighting Skyrim + ELE Lite proved itself as having the best compatibility (more or less) with different ENB presets. So even it's not listed in lighting mods compatible at ENB preset page, you can try this. This doesn't mean it will be 100% compatible, but basicaly it will have better compatibility results.\n<br />Once again, \"imcompatibility\" between ENB and weather/lighhting mod will not crash your game. But it may end with weird visuals and unbalanced colors, so always follow the recommended weather/lighting mods for chosen preset.\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Regarding the DOF:[/color] most of ENBs has DOF (depth of field) enabled and tweaked for this preset. Some people like DOF, some don't like at all, but ENB DOF also can (sometimes, it depends on preset) eat decent amount of FPS. If you find your preset DOF not good for you or need to have a few more FPS, do the following: 1) disable ENB DOF. Open enbseries.ini filem look at [EFFECT] section and change EnableDepthOfField=true to EnableDepthOfField=false. Save the file. 2) Optional: install [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12525]Dynavision[/url]. It's great mod for DOF and it has MCM menu so you can change it's type (static or dynamic) and strength ingame.\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Abbreviations:[/color] COT - Climates of Tamriel. VW - Vivid Weathers. NLA - Natural Lighting and Atmospherics. NLVA - Natural Lighting Vivid Atmospherics. ELFX - Enhanced Lights and FX. RLO - Realistic Lighting Overhaul. ELE Lite - Enhanced Lightins for ENB (Lite).\n<br />So, here we go with ENB presets list. Visit the presets pages to read attentively about all the details and also see some screenshots and videos to how it looks like. And once - again - don't bother about weather/lighting mods compatibility now. Just install the ENB you like the most and keep following my guide. You will come to weather/lighting mods section eventually.\n<br />[color=#ff7700]The last thing: [/color]some ENB presets are updated for the latest ENB binaries, some are not. In most of cases, even a bit outdated ENB will work just fine with the latest binaries (unitl it's not from like 2013), or can be made to work fine with a few tweaks you can in most cases read in that ENB comments section. Or, you can simply use older binaries, but for the best possible visual result ofc it's always a good idea to use ENB preset that is up-to-date.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41482]Rudy ENB[/url] [color=#38761d]==FPS==[/color]\n<br />My personal favourite. One of most unique presets on Nexus and one of my favourite. A bit desaturated, an amazing and balanced combination of realistic, fantasy and cinematic visuals. It has some really unique weathers and effects. Also compatible with awesome DARKEND mod (gameplay guide).\n<br />It's another huge benefit is that while being 100% up-to-date and having amazing visuals, it has amazing performance, almost close to 0 fps loss at modern rigs.\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Weather mods compatibility:[/color] NLA, NLVA, Climates of Tamriel, URWL\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Lighting mods compatibility:[/color] ELFX.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30936]RealVision ENB[/url] [color=#f1c232]==FPS==\n<br />[/color]The most known and endorsed ENB preset on Nexus.

It also has 3 versions - original preset, version for Vivid Weathers and version for NLVA.

Also the last version of weather part of the mod exist only in complete \"Purity\" mod, so if you want it you need to download the full pack. Also this mod likely won't be updated anymore. And also a there are compatibility issues with other landscapes and water mods. My personal opinion - choose between COT, Vivid Weather or NLVA (see below). You can also try to use this, COT or Vivid Weathers with NLA weathers .esp, but I personally don't recommend to mix them. Also this mod big flaw is that almost no ENB presets are tweaked for it.\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73937]Vivid Weathers (VW)[/url]\n<br />Before NLVA was released (see below), it was my personal favorite. Brilliant weather mod!\n<br />Pros: Newest weather mod. Biggest amount of weathers comparing with COT and Purity. Constantly updated. Has an MCM menu to configure brightness and saturation ingame without tweaking any .ini files. Covers most of unofficial DLC-sized mods!\n<br />Cons: the most saturated weather mod, some weathers could look less lore-friendly than  in COT or Purity, but saturation can be configured via MCM menu. Also it has the less amount of ENB presets compatible as it's new, but this list grows almost each few days.\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50065]Natural Lighting and Atmospherics[/url]\n<br />Awesome mod, but it changes vanilla weathers only. Also it has some awesome lighting effects. As for me this mod gives the best armor shining (especially during the rain/night/torches lighting etc). If you like it, you should defenitely try NLVA (see below).\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75346]Natural Lighting Vivid Atmospherics (NLVA)[/url]\n<br />My personal favorite now. The newest one as well. This mod it's just a brilliant combination of two mods: NLA and VW. Mod authors spent hundreds of hours to take and mix the best weathers and other effects from Vivid Weathers and Natural Lighting and Atmospherics. Quality about quantity. The result is fantastic! Today it also has very big amount of ENB presets tweaked for it.\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][/spoiler][/size][/font]\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#ff7700][size=3]Accompanying mods.

Installer has patches for almost all weather mods, excluding Vivid Weathers. But mod author said that VW patch will be done soon.

It adds Rain splashes, rainbows after rainstorms and shooting stars at night.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][b]LIGHTING MODS. INSTALL ONLY ONE:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />Lighting mods are great addition to Skyrim beautification. The only one problem with them is that many ENB presets are incompatible with them. FYI: when we talk about weather/lighting mods compatibility with ENB presets, if such mod is \"incompatible\" this doesn't mean it will cause crashes. But you can encounter weird weather/lighting visuals as ENB presets have their own weather/lighting settings usually. So you can absolutely try to use them with any ENB, but will need to be ready to face the issues and and tweak your ENB presets.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][spoiler][/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27043]Enhanced Lights and FX (ELFX)[/url] [color=#38761d]==F[/color][color=#f1c232]PS==[/color]\n<br />My personal favorite.\n<br />Pros: awesome lighting mod with the widest amount of options so the most configurable.

Also, remember that even if you'll use a lot of mods that are compatible, but in same regions, your FPS can be hit by truck.

In overall, many of mods in this section can be made compatible, but in that case - read compatibility notes carefully at mod pages. Why \"Hold the City Overhaul\" isn't in this list? It's bugged af and mod author ignores most of bug reports for monthes.\n<br />[/size][/font][color=#ff7700]Big towns'n'cities overhauls:[/color]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13608]Expanded Towns and Cities (ETAC)[/url][color=#f1c232] ==FPS==[/color]\n<br />The biggest town overhaul mod. It has a great modular installer so you can choose whice part to install and which not to install. This feature allows you to install it with other similar mods with maximum compatibility. Also it's still updating. A great base town mods to use and my personal recommendation.\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61035]JK's Skyrim[/url][color=#cc0000] ==FPS==[/color]\n<br />Pros: most detailed from all similar mods. It adds really big amount of objects to towns, making them look very rich detailed.\n<br />Cons: It's a most performance-hit mod from all the similar mods. It WILL rape your FPS at almost any rig. And if you're also running alot of retexture mods, you can get ~15-20 fps in big towns sometimes. But it's quality worth it. It's all about your rig power.\n<br />If you like this mod and want to use it, but it's too much FPS-heavy, you can use this awesome light or superlight version:\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71018]JKs Cities - Lite and SuperLite[/url] [color=#38761d]==F[/color][color=#f1c232]PS==\n<br />[/color]This versions are also much better compatible with another towns'n'cities mods.\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58275]Dawn of Skyrim Collection[/url][color=#f1c232]==FPS==[/color]\n<br />Another great towns'n'cities mod.

Now a plenty of various smaller mods that changes single city/town/adds different things here and there.

It differs drastically from ANY texture mod listed here. [color=#e06666]Please do NOT install it until your read this paragraph[/color]. What ASO does? It retextures major part of Skyrim textures (not all, yes, you can still meet original textures) into something cartoonish/painting-like.With this mod installed, your Skyrim will look like a painting. That's definitely not for everyone and concept is very experimental, but it's very unique - that's for sure. I personally really bow before the creativity of the mod author. Maybe you wanted to try somehing like this for years? If yes, grab on of three version of this mod and install it :) Do NOT pick this mod if you want to keep your Skyrim looking as it should look. Another great benefit of this mod is that it can be used at low-end PCs to save tons of video memory. That's it :)\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/4w2aTAa.png[/img]﻿[/center][size=4][center][color=#ff7700][b]\n<br />I was mentioning this in the ENB section of the guide, but now the time has finally come.\n<br />Meet SKGE - Skyrim Reloaded mod![/b][/color][/center][/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75954]Skyrim Reloaded - SKGE[/url] [color=#f1c232]==FPS==\n<br />[/color]What SKGE actually does? It's pretty much similar to ENB and has many same effects (which ENB, mostly, implements better). But, SKGE also adds some absolutely unique things which even allmight ENB doesn't have! Such things as additional beautiful and shiny water shaders, motion blur and what if most important - much better shadows. You can literally see the shadows in game to become twice as more detailed when using SKGE. You can also combine (not all, but you can) some same effects added by both ENB and SKGE (like godrays, for example) to bring these effects to 200% level of power!\n<br />[color=#e06666]IMPORTANT!\n<br />[/color]1) Proceed to SKGE original page on TesReloaded website and read everything carefully before installing it. If you feel yourself unsure about its installation and tweaking - skip this now and try later. SKGE is not crucial for Skyrim. But it's a great addition.\n<br />2) SKGE is NOT compatible with ENB by default. Consider it as an polishing addition to ENB. To simplify everything, after installing SKGE itself, use [u]only\n<br />[/u][/font]shadows, water and motion blur features from it.\n<br />3) SKGE shadows feature is pretty fps-hungry. It can eat from 5 to 15 FPS depending on your mod setup and PC specs. Test this.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][color=#e06666]Additional note for strong PC owners:[/color] you can drastically increase shadows quality, making shadows looking LITERALLY nextgen by combining SKGE and tweaking shadow values in Skyrimprefs.ini (thanks to PirahnaBoi for suggestion).

Its a successor of Tes5LodGen, which is basically generating the LODs (optimized textures of distant objects far from you - trees, buildings, light sournces, glowing windows etc). Vanilla Skyrim LODs just sucks. For example, somewhere far infront of you (you know that let's say) there are 200 trees. But game engine will load 10 LODs as maximum - and so, distant view will look bald, and when you'll come closer - all the rest 190 trees will just instantly pop-up out of nowhere. Annoying, isn't it?\n<br />Secondly, neither Skyrim engine and Tes5LodGen were able to generate LODs for mods. DynDOLOD can! Yes, yes, yes - that's what you're thinking about. If let's say you installed a mod that adds new houses near village - you will see these houses LODs in distance. If mod places new trees - you will see them all. If you're playing some kind of new land mod - even here, LODs will be generated.\n<br />DynDOLOD even has 3D-LODs option! This literally means LODs can be generated in 3D-like look with greater quality so you won't actaully notice the transition between regular objects textures and LODs, making exploraton almost seamless.\n<br />That's what DynDOLOD about - it's absolutely essential mod that will drastically improve how your worldscape look.\n<br />[color=#e06666]Important moment! \n<br />[/color]As I just mentioned, DynDOLOD supports almost everything - so that means you need to install and run it the VERY LAST after you will install all possible mods (both graphics and gameplay) and say \"my mod list is complete\". So skip this step for now and return here when you'll completely finish your mod list - to make the last, but huge beautification addition.\n<br />Also, if you're still not ready to generate LODs by yourself using it, you can use pre-made showcase files from the Miscellaneous section. Download version for Skyrim, Dawnguard, Dragonborn and Hearthfires. A few clicks and you're redy to go! :) But ofc it's strongly recommended to use it at full power.\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#ff7700][size=3]Absolutely simplified installation of Dyndolod looks like this:[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][spoiler][/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />1) Installing DynDOLOD required mods\n<br />2) Installing DynDOLOD core files via mod manager\n<br />3) Installing billboards in the same order you installed trees/landscape mod (i.e. if you have tree mods A, B, C, you should install billboards for mod A, then for mod B, then for mod C, and overwrite).\n<br />4) Installing patches via mod manager.\n<br />5) Generating textures via texgen.exe, archiving them, dropping to your mod manager mods folder, installing via mod manager.\n<br />6) Generating dyndolod via dyndolod.exe, archiving the files, dropping to your mod manager mods folder, installing via mod manager.\n<br />7) Activating dyndoldod .esp.\n<br />8) Profit :3\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][/spoiler][/size][/font]\n<br />Watch [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_5MWqeHIzw]this[/url] awesome guide if installation still looks complicated for you.\n<br />To make some lods even more detailed, you can use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88073]this[/url] great mod alongside DynDOLOD.\n<br />Depending on your graphics mods setup and ENB preset, you may want to make landscape LODs [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58818]darker[/url] or more [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60215]green[/url] (if using some \"green\"/\"spring\" mods).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][center][img]https://i.imgur.com/fCmMLSV.png[/img]﻿[/center][/b]\n<br />First of all, install this one.

Current list contains standalone mods - these mods don't require other mods to work properly. I have not included mods that are absolutely not lore-friendly. Also I have not included mods that are really outdated (like last update in 2012). \n<br />[color=#ff0000]Important:[/color] such mods are mostly compatible, but as most of them change many NPCs, you can have situation when you want to install two mods, but they change some same NPCs. In this case, place the mod you like the most after.\n<br />For example, you want to use MOD1 and MOD2. Both of them change Lydia. You like Lydia from MOD2. Place MOD2 after MOD1 to give it bigger priority and you're fine :)\n<br />[color=#ff0000]Important:[/color] some of these mods may use USKP (previous unsupported version of Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition patch which is now deleted from NExus already) as master. These mods should be updated by their authors, but it can also be done by yourself - if you have USKP, of course.\n<br />Take a look at first sticky post at [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71214]USLEEP page[/url]. As always, read it carefully and start to modify files only if you're understand what you're doing completely. In other case, just try to use another mod - there are a lot of them :) If you don't have USKP now...well, just ignore this part and don't use mods that require USKP.\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][b]Female overhaul mods:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]\"Big\" mods that change pretty big amount of NPCs:[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=2]\"Bijin\" mods series.[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]You can install them all if you like.

Let's make a Bashed Patch![/center][/b][/size][/color][/font][font=Arial][size=3]What is that Bashed Patch and why do you need it? Let me expain. Many mods, especially big ones and especially gameplay mods (but many graphics mods as well, and that's why you need it even now), are modifying so called \"leveled lists\". What is leveled list? In simple language, that's everything you may find and meet in the game. Enemies spawns, items in chests and enemies as loot, NPC faces and bodies, spellbooks in traders inventory and so on. Many other things like changes/addition to Race/AI records and scripts may be added as well. The key moment here is game is not updating this automatically, litereally meaning that you may never see some of new creatures, items, spellbooks or new NPC faces from mod-added NPCs. But thanks the Divines modders, you can fix that by making a Bashed Patch. Simply find an plugin called \"Bashed Patch 0\" in your load order, right-click on it, choose \"Build/Rebuild\" patch, click on it, wait until importing is finished and...boom, magic! Everything is updated and imported, so you can be sure everything you want from your mods - you will see it ingame.\n<br />Just don't forget to activate it ;) It was simple, wasn't it? But if you want to read a really in-depth manual for it, take a look at this amazing [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/35230]pictorial guide[/url] for it. Don't worry about the fact it's on Oblivion nexus - bashed patch features for both games are 99% identical.[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/22gYQGD.png[/img]﻿[/center][font=Arial][size=3]You rig is pretty old, but you still want somehow to run ENB and some graphics mods? Don't worry, that's more then possible! Please take into account that \"low-end\" is pretty wide termin, so here I will just put all possible advices and tricks that may help you. You can also refer to this section even if your PC is strong - to get more FPS for different purposes.\n<br />[/size][/font]\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][spoiler]\n<br />[/size][/font]\n<br />[center][b]YES, YOU REALLY CAN RUN ENB AND SOME GRAPHICS MODS EVEN ON POTATO PC! ARE YOU FIRED UP??[/b][/center][center][img]https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb93vpqQ4s1rucc9wo6_r1_500.gif[/img]﻿[/center]\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#ff7700][size=3]1) Install VERY performance-friendly ENB:[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83091]Antique Dragon ENB[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90169]Caffeine ENB[/url] (from the same atuhor) are both fresh and up-to-date presets, but with AMAZING love to your FPS.\n<br />Still bad FPS?\n<br />Install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73834]Dark and Tender ENB[/url]﻿ or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65406]Darklight ENB[/url]﻿\n<br />Still bad FPS?\n<br />Install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15425]Stakado Cinemascope ENB[/url]﻿ - yes, it's an ENB from 2012 and it won't look even close to same good as modern presets, but it has all the main features like anitialiasing, bloom, has letterbox and pretty cool cinematic look in overall and it litereally eats ZERO FPS. One of my subcribers (also thanks to you for \"advanced\" usage tips Slamo) is using this ENB and he has GTX 285. No kidding! [color=#e06666]A note to advanced users[/color]: you actually CAN make it work with the latest ENB biaries for better effects quality and same 0 FPS hit - simply install the latest ENB binaries, but copy ONLY enbseries.ini from Stakado preset. This will allow you to use ENBoost powers with this preset as well (which was made before ENBoost appeared).\n<br />As an another option, you can install \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/78537]I Can't Believe It's Not An ENB[/url]\" sweetFX preset. Still, any ENB, even Stakado, will look better.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#ff7700]2) Open SkyrimPrefs.ini and find[/color][size=3] [/size][u][color=#00ffff]iShadowMapResolution=[/color][/u][size=3] [/size][color=#ff7700]value[/color]\n<br />[size=2]It's usually set to 4096. Change this value to 2048 or even to 1024. Save the changes, close the .ini file. Changing it to 2048 will make almost zero visual quality loss for shadows, but give you 5-10 FPS boost depending on your PC specs and mod list. Changing it to 1024 will ofc make shadows looks worse, but can sometimes give up to 15-20 FPS. One-click boost!\n<br />\n<br />[/size][color=#ff7700][size=3]3) Use Ordenator. Simple as that.[/size][/color]\n<br />[/font]Still bad FPS? Just use this amazing tool to optimize textures minmaps and compress all your textures to 1024 or even 512. Yes, 512 is default resolution of most of vanilla textures (some are even 256 and 128 though), but the thing is mod of good retexture mods will still look MUCH better than vanilla textures, even at 512 resolution, because of great detalization and overall quality. You can also read [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71294]this[/url] pretty detailed manual for Ordenator usage.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#ff7700][size=3]4) My PC can't afford DynDOLOD and ENB DOF, but I don't want to see these ugly LODs! What can I do?[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />You can! Either use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12525]DYNAVISION - Dynamic Depth of Field[/url]﻿ which gives nice DOF with literally 0 FPS hit OR/AND use so called \"Fogrim Skryim Mode\", which means installing both [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88676]Obsidian Mountain Fogs[/url]﻿ and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74406]Fogrim[/url]﻿ (thanks to Slamophiliac once again) while removing or greatly compressing most of your landscape textures. Fog will cover big part of worldscape, especially in distance - this will hide ugly lods and not-so-good textures in overall, so you will be able to not bother about installing high-res retexture mods for them.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#ff7700][size=3]5) Install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64611]Insignificant Object Remover[/url].[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />No hidden treats, no bugs or crashes, no problems - it just works! Removes thousands of objects (mostly across the landscapes) whic are no-so-important and you most likely won't even notice the difference, but your PC will definitely notice an FPS boost. Also, install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/87023]Snow Disabler[/url]. Don't worry it doesn't disable ALL the snow, just the ugly snowdrifts and give some FPS in snowy areas.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#ff7700][size=3]6) Use lighting shaders tweak (taken and tested from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59533]this[/url] article, big thanks to original author).[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />This tweak actually works and doesn't break anything in your game - you can always delete the values from .INI file without any consequences. It also decreases visual around you a bit, but the the loss is really minimal, while FPS gain can be from 5 to 15 sometimes, making it really worthy. So:\n<br />\n<br />1) Go to your Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim and backup your Skyrim.ini file (just copy it and place a copy somewhere just in case).\n<br />2) Open Skyrim.ini with any text editor.\n<br />3) Add the following lines to the end of the file, after all existing settings:\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#00ffff][size=2][LightingShader]\n<br />fDecalLODFadeEnd=0.0600\n<br />fDecalLODFadeStart=0.0500\n<br />fEnvmapLODFadeEnd=0.0\n<br />fEnvmapLODFadeStart=0.0\n<br />fEyeEnvmapLODEnd=0.0\n<br />fRefractionLODFadeEnd=0.0\n<br />fRefractionLODFadeStart=0.0\n<br />fSpecularLODFadeEnd=0.0\n<br />fSpecularLODFadeStart=0.0[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />4) Save changes by pressing CTRL+S and close the Skyrim.ini. Done :)\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#ff7700][size=3]7) Lower you ingame resolution.[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />For example, if you have FullHD monitor (1920x1080), set ingame resolution to 1280x720. While ofc playing on lwoer resolution is not what you may want, but it's not very noticable after you play a bit, but even downscale from 1080p to 720p can give you 10-20 FPS - which you can use to run ENB and/or run DynDOLOD on low settings, and this benefit definitely overlaps the resolution disadvantage.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][/spoiler][/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=5][b][center][b]WOW, WE FINISHED THIS! FOR SOME TIME :)[/b][/center][/b][/size][/color]Skyrim was released in 2011, but thanks to Bethesda open modding tools and amazing modding community we can have it more beautiul then most of the modern games. It's a legendary game and everyone who plays it deserve the best graphics and visuals. I want to say so much thanks to each modder who put their time and knowledge into Skyrim mods to make it look so awesome. And thank you guys for reading this! Wish you a stable and exciting gameplay in your modded Skyrim. In the videos below you can see how Skyrim can look like. I also want to say tonns of thanks once again to SkyrimTuner for his big modlist in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30936]Realvision installation guide[/url] that I used as a base for my.\n<br />[youtube]GjTVbZ5hXMg[/youtube][youtube]wmg90glmbvk[/youtube][youtube]ByBSUtPqSko[/youtube][youtube]jRSJ0NPdp84[/youtube]\n<br />Cheers! :)",
