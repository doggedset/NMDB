  "descriptionHtml": "Hybrid Argonian features an argonian race that has a new power called, Hybrid Form. If you have read about my previous file called Hybrid Race, files/categories/races........./Hybrid Race. This actually the same thing. So basically its the exact same thing as an argonian except that it has a new power. The changes are that all werewolves are twice in size so when you turn, you are twice in size. NOTICE: if you used the power but not turn, enable tgm (god mode) then try again.\r\n\r\nIn my next file I may make two new characters, and the ability to wear greybeard clothes!!!\r\nThis will make you have a legendary look. A real AWESOME Dragonborn look!",
