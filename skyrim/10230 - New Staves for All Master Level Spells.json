  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=red]MASTER LEVEL SPELL STAVES[/color][/b]\r\n\r\nAddition to my Master Destruction Staves, I decided to make staves of all other master spell.\r\n\r\nAdds 14 new Master staff:\r\n\r\n[b][color=red]Destruction Staves:[/color]\r\nStaff of Firestorm\r\nStaff of Blizzard (must hit an enemy to trigger the effect)\r\nStaff of Lightning Storm\r\n\r\n[color=red]Illusion Staves:[/color]\r\nStaff of Harmony\r\nStaff of Hysteria\r\nStaff of Mayhem\r\nStaff of Call to Arms\r\n\r\n[color=red]Restoration Staves:[/color]\r\nGrand Staff of Bane\r\nGrand Staff of Guardian Circle (must hit an enemy to trigger the effect)\r\n\r\n[color=red]Conjuration Staves:[/color]\r\nStaff of Flame Thrall\r\nStaff of Frost Thrall\r\nStaff of Storm Thrall\r\nStaff of Dead Thrall (changed vanilla magic effect: level limit increased from 40 to 80. And now works on everything except Dragons, Daedra and Dwemer machines)\r\n\r\n[color=red]Alteration Staff:[/color]\r\nStaff of Mass Paralysis[/b]\r\n\r\nDoesn\\'t need to charge time or both hands, just cast them as a normal spell. Works well with spell perks (like Intense Flames, Disintegrate, Kindred Mage, even spell scaling mods, tested).\r\n\r\n[b]Installation:[/b] Copy MasterSpellStaves.esp in the .rar, to your Skyrim/Data directory. Activate it in your Launcher menu.\r\n\r\n[b]To get them:[/b] I\\'ve added all of them to leveled item list, so when you reach level 50, you have a little chance to get them as random loot, by reaching level 52, 54 and 56, your chance of finding these staves will be greater. Alternatively; you can add to yourself by console command, see video to how to get their item codes.\r\n\r\nYou can watch how these new staves works in Video section of this mod.\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] If you don\\'t want to be overpowered, use this with difficulty mods (Deadly Dragons, Wars in Skyrim, Intense Difficulty etc., because I\\'ve tested this too, with hardcore Deadly Dragons, still underpowered :)",
