  "descriptionHtml": "I made this mod simply because I like the look of the Imperial bow but was disappointed that it was so weak. This mod adds three enhanced versions of the Imperial Bow on the levels of Elven, Ebony and Daedric. Each bow is forgeable with three steel ingots and a refined moonstone ingot, ebony ingot or daedric heart respectively. I have also made the original Imperial bow forgeable for three steel ingots. All of the bows can be improved either one refined moonstone, ebony ingot or daedric heart. I have placed an Elven Enhanced Imperial bow can be found on the chest in Breezehome, an Ebony Enhanced Imperial bow can be found on the chest in Honeyside, and a Daedric Enhanced Imperial Bow can be found on the chest next to the bed in Proudspire Manor. \r\n\r\nCompatibility: As far as I know it should be compatible with most any mod.\r\n\r\nSharing/Use: Share it or use it as you please I just made it for myself and any other weirdo out there who likes the Imperial Bow.\r\n\r\nChange Log:\r\nV. 1.1 Had to remove the function that required Arcaneblacksmith perk to improve an enchanted bow in order for them to be improved.\r\nV. 1.2 Readded the requirement of the Arcaneblacksmith perk but am leaving both versions for those wish for version 1.1.",
