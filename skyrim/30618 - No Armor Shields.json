  "descriptionHtml": "Recently, due to a joke i made on some forums, i decided to do a No armor play thru (also perma level 1 on master difficulty) but as i went along, i noticed that with no shield this could be pretty hard, but with the rules of the play thru.. there a no go. so this mod was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n--What it adds--\r\nMultiple shields with Zero armor rating. the retain their orginial values and are crafted using the same materials as normal. i did not personally add them to any loot list or place them anywhere in the world. i only made them craftable. they also are lacking the perk requirements, so you can have any one at any level.. as long as ya have the materials. for easy spotting, al shields have the letters \\\"NA\\\" after the names.\r\n\r\n--small note--\r\nYou can still block some damage, but it will be lower then normal, since part of the formula for the blocked damage came from the shields base armor. but you will still block some. in testing, i took hits both with and without blocking and there was a difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n--Shields added--\r\nIron Shield\r\nBanded Iron Shield\r\nSteel Shield\r\nImperial Shield\r\nHide Shield\r\nFalmer Shield <- under Misc\r\nBlades Shield <- under Misc\r\nDwarven Shield\r\nElven Shield\r\nOrcish Shield\r\nEbony SHield\r\nDeadric Shield\r\nDragonplate Shoeld\r\nDragonscale Shield\r\n\r\n(i think thats all of them atm)\r\n\r\n--Version 2 adds--\r\nAll 9 Holds shields -listed as \\\"Pale Guard Na\\\" or similar under Iron section\r\nShield of Ysgramor -under Misc\r\nTarge of the blood - under steel\r\nSpellbreaker - under Misc\r\n\r\nand the first set of armor\r\nSteel Plate - under steel\r\n\r\nthe 3 non- guard shields all have their regular enchants too boot, so added a Filled Grand soulgem to make them, first 2 are modified steel recipes, Spellbreaker is s modified ebony shield.\r\n\r\nthe armor is plainly for dress up, it\\'s materials are the same as regualr steel, but each peice has a weight of 1 and ofcourse No armor rating.\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n--Installation--\r\n\r\nDownload file, drop in data folder, enable in launcher/NMM.. play?\r\n\r\n--conflicts--\r\n\r\nshould be none, unless maybe playing with mods like SkyRe idk. (but there patcher should fix that i think)",
