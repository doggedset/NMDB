  "summary": "This mod adds a strong, unique and lore friendly weapon to the game that can only be found in the Stillborn Cave. UPDATE: It can be crafted into a two-handed sword and the other way around.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The sword is one handed (can be held in any hand) and its a unique weapon which can only be found in [u]Stillborn Cave[/u] north-east on the world map. Its placed [u]on a throne inside the cave[/u]. Getting there might proove a bit difficult but its worth it since the sword is strong. If you cannot find the sword on the throne [u]loot the Falmer around the throne[/u], sometimes one of them picks it up.\r\n\r\n[b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=68612429]Steam Workshop Version[/url][/b]\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1.1:\r\n> added the two-handed version\r\n> added recipes to \\\"convert\\\" the sword into two- and one-handed\r\n> stats balancing\r\n\r\nNote: The sheath of the two-handed version always stays on the back of the character. Due the bad positioning of the default back position the sheath also has some clipping errors sometimes, I cannot solve those.\r\n\r\nBasic values:\r\n\r\n[u]One-handed[/u]\r\n\r\nRaw damage: 15\r\nValue: 4500\r\nWeight: 14\r\n\r\n[u]Two-handed[/u]\r\n\r\nRaw damage: 25\r\nValue: 4500\r\nWeight: 14\r\n\r\nYou can craft the one-handed Sword into a two-handed sword at the forge, provided that you have the Ebody Smithing-Skill and you need the Loner\\'s Sword one-handed as an ingredient. You can craft it the other way around, too.\r\nThe swords are stronger than Daedric weapons, but cost a lot more to improve. Both recipes [u]can be found in the Steel category of the forge menu[/u].\r\nIf you want both swords at the same time simply add them over the console, they have the following FormID:\r\n\r\nOne-handed: XX01000D62\r\nTwo-handed: XX01001002\r\nWhere \\\"XX\\\" is the mod start number.\r\nIf you don\\'t know how to find out the mod start number type the following into the console:\r\n[i]help loner\\'s 4[/i]\r\nthen add the item to you inventory by writing\r\n[i]player.additem <Mod ID> 1[/i]\r\n\r\nGraphic features include a baked normals map which makes the shading look really good. Textures are high-resolution to add to you gaming experience. It also includes a custom sheath and realistic shaders.\r\n[b]If there are any bugs, post in the comments and it will be taken care of as soon as possible.[/b]\r\n\r\n[u]Video previews:[/u]\r\n\r\n[youtube]wWaG6z9AX6I[/youtube] \r\n\r\nThanks to Brodual for the video!\r\n\r\n[youtube]Hbqve-c98H4[/youtube]\r\n\r\nThanks to MxR for the review.\r\n\r\n[youtube]Lpm3wzVCVxc[/youtube]\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\n[u]Credits:[/u]\r\nSyncing - Model, Compile\r\nCrash - Textures",
