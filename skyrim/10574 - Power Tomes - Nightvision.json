  "summary": "Nightvision is a blur-free and colored variant of the Night Eye lesser power designed to be used with a realistic lighting mod. It is especially designed to make even the darkest parts of a dungeon or the night clearly visible.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Update[/b]\r\nTo make this mod usable with different realistic lighting settings I added three new versions. The original version has a brightness setting of 3, the new ones are 2, 1 and 0.5.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod adds the nightvision lesser power to the game, which can be learned from a power tome located in Farengar Secret-Fire\\'s quarters in Dragonsreach.\r\n\r\nNightvision is designed to work with realistic lighting mods, such as the excellent mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7654]Realistic Lighting With Customization by Pluto[/url]. It works as a toggle, dispels and is dispelled by Night Eye and Vampire\\'s Sight.\r\n\r\nUsing the nightvision power during the day is not advised as it will cause severe whiteout.\r\n\r\nPlease read the readme for installation instructions.\r\n\r\nThis mod may conflict with other mods that change Farengar Secret-Fire\\'s quarters in Dragonsreach.\r\n\r\n",
