  "modId": 31013.0,
  "modName": "Lectras Otherworldly Underground Watery Base With Arena-Beta version",
  "summary": "Adds an otherworldly unusual looking underground home with several blue fires, purple fires, waterfalls, a tiny island, several containers, a battle ring, and later on I\\'ll add actual NPCs to guard the player while inside the base. Warning- The mod is still in it\\'s beta stages as I\\'ve uploaded it here to ensure I don\\'t lose my hard earned work ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Yes the current mod name is awful, yes the current cell names are awful (I\\'ll change both to something better soon), yes the mod is incomplete, and I still need to correct some misplaced objects, double check the containers to ensure they don\\'t respawn, add in some more clutter, add in NPCs, and add in an actual entry point to the external world...\r\n\r\nI\\'m working on that. The reason I uploaded it in such an incomplete state is because I am having severe computer problems, and don\\'t want to lose all my hard earned work. I suspect the mod will be finished in at least a month if not a few weeks.\r\n\r\nOnce it is complete, the mod will have an indoor island here, along with a battle ring with respawning enemies in other cells... Also when it is complete the mod will have dwemer robots who act as guards to the player. This mod is also particularly intended to combine well with mods that make enemies who hunt the player down, as it is one of the only truly safer places to leave with such other mods active.\r\n\r\nAnd special thanks to the person who I got the ring meshes, and texture from, SS by DRAGONPORN. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30696  <- Link to credit. the original uploader of the battle rings meshes and textures",
