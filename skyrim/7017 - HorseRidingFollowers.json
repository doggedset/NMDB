  "descriptionHtml": "Version 2.2 is here.\r\n\r\n(Btw I like the pictures people sent in better than my own so I put a few on the front page here. I hope you all who made them don\\'t mind.)\r\n\r\n\r\n===============\r\nDescription\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis mod makes your follower ride a horse if (s)he has access to a horse he owns. There are some horses added to stables and also in a few other places that are meant for followers. You\\'ll recognize them when you look at them because instead of being labelled \\\"Horse\\\" they\\'re labelled \\\"A Horse\\\".\r\n\r\nVanilla style followers will have a dialogue option \\\"Get your horse.\\\" Followers made by mods might not have this depending on how they\\'re made. If you tell your follower to get his horse and he\\'s near one of the special \\\"A Horse\\\" horses he ought to pick one. After a moment of riding the horse the ownership of that horse will turn to the him, the riding follower.\r\n\r\nIf you want to choose particular horse for your follower, choose the dialogue option that tells him you\\'ll show him which one to use. Then use the power-type spell \\\"Choose your follower\\'s horse\\\" by casting it on any horse within 10 feet. That horse will become owned by the follower you did that dialogue option on, and the follower will also no longer be able to select the \\\"A Horse\\\" horses HRF provides. If all goes well he\\'ll choose the horse he owns as the one to mount once you mount yours. He won\\'t ride it until you ride yours. If there are any other steeds in the area that he owns, or that a faction that he\\'s in owns, there is still a chance he\\'ll choose a different one. If you want to disqualify a horse from being chosen by your follower, cast \\\"Disqualify horse for follower\\\" at it. That horse will then be owned by a faction your follower is not in and that ought to keep him from wanting to ride it.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve tested this mod with UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul, Better Followers, and Better Horses and all work for me, though the UFO followers don\\'t choose a horse by my method. They take theirs according to whatever logic UFO tells them to. Any mod that makes followers who use the game\\'s FollowerPackageTemplate ought to at least ride, but again they might not take adventage of HRF\\'s supplied horses. Followers who use the game\\'s built-in DialogueFollower quest Follower alias will work best, with little things like jogging to their horses instead of walking, and not bumping into you much.\r\n\r\nYou don\\'t need a special command to get your follower to mount his horse. He\\'ll ride when you do. If your follower doesn\\'t seem to want to get on his horse, or choose his horse, move away from him. He\\'ll wake up a little if he notices that you\\'re leaving. Just start walking (on your horse) and eventually he should get the idea.\r\n\r\nWhen you tell your follower to get his horse he will choose one if there is a horse he may use nearby (within about 250 ft I think it works out to). The best place to try is at a stable, naturally. If his horse dies he will choose a new one once one that\\'s available to him is near.\r\n\r\nHRF is compatible with mods that provide special mounts, like the awesome Like a Boss (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9464) by fLokii.\r\n\r\nFast Travel isn\\'t enabled for this yet. If you do it your follower\\'s horse won\\'t come with you. I\\'m working on it! It\\'s harder than I thought to make it happen properly. Horses don\\'t always cooperate.\r\nI\\'ll keep working on Fast Travel til I get it right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n===============\r\nInstallation\r\n===============\r\n\r\nImportant!\r\n----------\r\nBefore you install this version you MUST make a clean HorseRidingFollower-less save first. Remove EVERY trace of old versions. Remove old HorseRidingFollowers esp files and bsa files that you have. Also make sure to remove all scripts from previous versions. To help you recognize them, they all have either \\\"hrf\\\" or \\\"dap\\\" at the start of their names. Hopefully if you installed the old version with Nexus Mod Manager this removal will be done automatically, but double check. Afterwards start the game up loading your preferred save game and and re-save it. Then close Skyrim and install the new HorseRidingFollowers. Restart your game and load that HRF-clean save you made and you should be ready to go with HorseRidingFollowers.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve given up on trying to make it so you don\\'t have to install this on a clean save. Sorry. The game will do things with old leftover scripts even when the new esp file doesn\\'t use them anymore. Bad mod-breaking things, sometimes.\r\n\r\nThis is Nexus Mod Manager compatible. If you don\\'t want to use it then just merge the Data folder in the HRF archive you downloaded with your Skyrim\\'s Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
