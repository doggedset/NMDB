Most of these mods are highly personalized and loaded into a GameplayTweaks.ESM so I\\'m going to be basically recreating them all from scratch. Eventually I\\'ll have a single comprehensive thread for the whole project, so stay tuned for that. This is the Race & Skill module and changes how skills work and how they interact with the playable races. It will also eventually add new races and make further changes to the existing races to make them fit better canonically with past Elder Scrolls titles.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#a52a2a][b][size=5]Changelog[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[b]Version .1b[/b]\r\n\r\n- Racial skill bonuses are now in the form of Abilities. This means all racial skills now have a peak of 110 or 105 respectively instead of 100, adding new meaning to choosing your race for your desired character build.\r\n\r\n- All skills now have a default value of 1 (before bonuses). This gives the feeling that the player really is brand new at this whole adventuring thing, but does have some in-born talents, almost Bilbo Baggins-esque.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#a52a2a][b][size=5]Suggestions & Questions[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\nPost them here in the thread and I\\'ll do my best to respond in a timely manner. If there\\'s something that needs to be asked over PM then I\\'m open to it, but try to keep it in the thread if possible.\r\n\r\n[size=5][b][color=#a52a2a]Compatibility[/color][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThis mod will [b]NOT[/b] be compatible with any mod that changes the racial bonuses of the vanilla races\r\n\r\nThis mod [b]MAY[/b] be compatible with other mods that change the races but don\\'t affect the racial bonuses, I\\'m not really sure.",
