  "summary": "This mod adds an open worldspace cafe in Solitude that sells pastries, coffee, and tea&#33; Since this is also the successor to Kam&#39;s Kettles, this mod also adds kettles to locations around Skyrim for your use as well as a portable kettle that you can craft&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][/center][center][font=Times New Roman][img]http://i.imgur.com/pKc0GjL.png[/img]\r<br />[/font][/center][font=Times New Roman]\r<br />[/font][center][font=Times New Roman]Hello, Nexus&#33;\r<br />My name is Kam, and this is my SECOND published mod&#33; This mod is the successor to my first mod: Kam&#39;s Kettles. My first mod was a small project I took up to build upon Elianora&#39;s coffee mod. I loved that she added kettles around Skyrim for the player to use to brew coffee in, rather than just putting all of the ingredients in the same cooking pot where you just made a stew in...\r<br />\r<br />I was also using a mod called Drinks for the Thirsty which added tea and juices to Skyrim&#33; I loved it&#33; But I could only make the new drinks via a cooking pot. Yuck. So I made it so you can make the DftT drinks in Elianora&#39;s kettles. But why stop there&#33; I used the Campfire Dev Kit by Chesko to make a craftable, portable kettle so you can brew your favorite drinks even when you&#39;re out in the wilds&#33;\r<br />\r<br />...And yet, I still wasn&#39;t 100% satisfied. I wanted to go one step further.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/mmOPkj6.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[b]REQUIREMENTS:\r<br />1. Skyrim.esm\r<br />2. Hearthfire.esm\r<br />3. Campfire.esm\r<br />5. Real Shelter.esp[/b]\r<br />[color=#38761d]\r<br />[/color][b][color=#38761d]If you use iNeed, there&#39;s a second version uploaded. USE ONLY ONE ESP.[/color]\r<br />[/b][b][color=#ff0000]This mod is also incompatible with Kam&#39;s Kettles, as they both do the same thing - minus the cafe.\r<br />[/color][/b]Don&#39;t want all this flair but still want to craft coffee and tea? Try out [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/81047/?]Kam&#39;s Kettles[/url] instead&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a new exterior worldspace/no-load-doors cafe called Bareraud&#39;s Brews to Solitude. It sits in the empty lot between the Winking Skeever and Angeline&#39;s Aromatics&#33; The small cafe is owned by a Breton named Bareraud (Bah-reh-row). &#34;Barry&#34;--as he hates to be called--is from High Rock and ended up in Skyrim after many failed attempts to earn fame through various mediums. Some of his &#34;masterpiece&#34; paintings can be seen hung up inside of the cafe for your viewing pleasure&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Bareraud works all day and night to keep up with Skyrim&#39;s demands for his edible works of art. He will sell all sorts of pastries to you, along with a variety of drinks&#33; His cafe is decorated with knick-knacks that he&#39;s collected in his travels around Skyrim and literary works for his patrons to enjoy while they&#39;re there. He has also placed small sitting areas outside of the cafe with sunshades if the weather is nice enough to enjoy your drinks and cakes outdoors&#33; The cafe has large glass windows so you can watch the world go by from inside, or watch the master at work while walking by the cafe.\r<br />\r<br />All of the drinks from Kam&#39;s Kettles are included with 3 NEW drinks that are exclusive to this mod: \r<br />\r<br />BEVERAGES:\r<br />1. Coffee Beans + Water = Cup of Black Coffee\r<br />2. 1 Red Apple + 2 Green Apples = Apple Juice\r<br />3. Moon Sugar + Jug of Milk + Coffee Beans + Water = Elsweyr Coffee x2\r<br />4. 3 Carrots = Carrot Juice\r<br />5. 3 Green Apples = Apple Cider\r<br />6. 2 Snowberries + 2 Red Apples = Appleberry Punch\r<br />7. 3 Snowberries + 2 Juniper Berries + 1 Jazbay Grape = Mixberry Tea\r<br />8. 3 Canis Root + Water = Canis Root Tea\r<br />9. 1 Taproot + 1 Tundra Cotton + 1 Grass Pod + 1 Water = Medicinal Tea\r<br />10. 3 Elves Ear + Water = Elves Ear Tea\r<br />11. 3 Snowberries + Water = Red Berry Tea\r<br />12. 3 Thistle + Water = Thistle Tea\r<br />13. 3 Tomatoes = Tomato Juice\r<br />14. 3 Strawberries + Water = Strawberry Tea\r<br />15. 3 Mangoes + Water = Mango Punch\r<br />16. 3 Lemons + Water = Lemon Tea\r<br />\r<br />On top of new pastries, the mod adds 3 new fruits: lemons, strawberries, and mangoes. The pastries are ONLY sold by Bareraud, but the new fruits and all drinks are sold by innkeepers which can be eaten or made into a fancy drink&#33;\r<br />\r<br />If you have your kettle in your inventory, you can collect water while standing in a body of water or while standing in the rain by opening up the Campfire &#34;Create Item&#34; menu&#33;\r<br />iNeed users can collect snow and convert it into bottled water&#33;\r<br />All innkeepers now have the chance to sell Empty Wine Bottles&#33; And every location with a kettle has a water barrel for you to fill your own bottles with clean water&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/VnCnKUS.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT REUPLOAD MY MOD ELSEWHERE&#33;\r<br />I don&#39;t intend on removing this mod anytime soon, so why bother? \r<br />\r<br />You are free to make patches/compatibility mods for this as long as you DOOOOOO NOOOOOT\r<br />take credit for my original work&#33;\r<br />\r<br />But in reality, this mod never ever EVER would have been possible without these awesome people and their work&#33;\r<br />\r<br />AND A REALLY REALLY REALLY BIG thank you to everyone on Nexus who inspired me to do this project&#33; You guys are amazing&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64798/?]Chesko: for Campfire[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66417/?]Elianora: for Eli&#39;s Coffee Mod[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52612/?]Robinsage: for Real Shelter[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79058/?]trinityfang: for Cabin Player Home[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28091/?]bfadragon: for Resource extra food v2 (fruits)[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26132/?]Runspect: for Resources for modders (cakes, trinkets)[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53022/?]Jokerine: for Jokerine&#39;s Misc Resources (blank/generic signs)[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65303/?]ps46183 & Galadreal: for Goblets With Wine And Orange Juice Resources[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62733/?]lolikyonyu: for Lolicept Resources (oven plates)[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42690/?]Stroti and Tamira: for Stroti&#39;s Kitchen Tools[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24450/?]Stroti&#39;s Rustic Furniture 1_2[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62396/?]flintone and Garnet18: for Orient Set[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66282/?]Wicker Set[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1300-ready-clutter-and-furnishings/&]Lilith: for Ready Clutter and Furnishings[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/?]Oaristys: for Modder&#39;s Resource Pack\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65703/?]Artisanix, morganmarz, betterbecause, and jet4571: for HQ Real Paintings[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17423/?]Paintings and Frames[/url][/font][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/?]\r<br />[/url][/center]",
