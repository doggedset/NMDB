  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=#F535AA]Welcome to Simple Livin&#39;. :)[/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />This is an underground house mod with a nice few amenities outside.\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=cyan]Table of Contents[/color][/heading]\r<br />- Features inside the house\r<br />- Features outside the house\r<br />- Installation\r<br />- Updating\r<br />- Warnings\r<br />- And finally~\r<br />\r<br />[b]Features inside the house&#33;[/b]\r<br />- Bed\r<br />- A feast fit for a king, fitting of the aspiring Dragonborn.\r<br />- Alchemy table with strongbox for ingredients\r<br />- Enchanting table with strongbox for soul gems\r<br />- Two bookcases\r<br />- A nice stock of fine wines and meads\r<br />- A special mead called Blackout, made by me. [color=red]WARNING: Not for the faint of heart.[/color] [i]Note that the Blackout is pointless.[/i]\r<br />- Hanging ingredients\r<br />- A fancy chest for your doodads\r<br />- A small nightstand for whateveryouwannaputthere\r<br />- A cooking pot with a cosy little fire\r<br />- Places to put your bum\r<br />[b]Added in the 1.1 update&#33;[/b]\r<br />- A nice little table with a book and a candle between the chairs\r<br />- A nice little reading area near the book cases, complete with piled books so you can seem like you actually read them. :D\r<br />[b]Added in the 1.2 update&#33;[/b]\r<br />- A mannequin&#33; [color=red]PLEASE NOTE&#33;:[/color] [i]I&#39;m having a problem with the mannequin in which when you first enter Simple Livin&#39; (or the first time loading 1.2 for those updating), the mannequin may be moving around. Simply leaving the house and re-entering fixed this for me. I&#39;ll explain more below.)[/i]\r<br />- Weapon racks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Features outside the house&#33;[/b]\r<br />- Beautiful scenery, of course&#33;\r<br />- A small area to cut firewood, also containing an outside fire with cooking spit and more places to put your bum&#33;\r<br />- A nice little boat serving absolutely no purpose at all. :D\r<br />- A full smithy placed above ground\r<br />- A nice little windmill, because why not?\r<br />- A very, very tiny chest with 1000 of the house keys in case you happen to lose one. [i]It also insults you.[/i]\r<br />[b]Added in the 1.2 update&#33;[/b]\r<br />- I fixed the small immersion breaking problem of there not being a chimney stack outside when there is a fireplace inside. Not extremely important, but definitely something that really bugged me when I noticed I had forgotten it.\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=cyan]Installation&#33;[/color][/heading]\r<br />Download with the NMM, or simply place the yobedodo.esp file into your Data directory. \r<br />[i]Make sure if you&#39;re placing the file in your Data directory yourself that you have the yobedodo.esp file checked so that it will work in game.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=cyan]For those who are updating to a newer version&#33;&#33;[/color][/heading]\r<br />Please note that I&#39;m a very inexperienced modder, so I haven&#39;t fully grasped this updating business. So, if you&#39;re updating to a newer version, I would recommend completely uninstalling the mod and then installing the new version. You have the specs of the update, so if it&#39;s not important enough to go through that, it&#39;s your choice. [color=#5EFB6E][b]Note:[/color] Before uninstalling, make sure to remove all your items from the modgrounds so that you wont lose them. If you forget, I claim no responsibility.[/b] [color=red]&gt;:}[/color]\r<br />[b][i]Also, for those updating from v1 or v1.1 to v1.2 or higher, the map marker has now been changed to the marker for rocks instead of a settlement. This makes it much easier to see, since as far as I can tell, the rock marker wasn&#39;t even used on the vanilla map. :D[/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=red][b]Listen up, little ones&#33; This is the part where I give warnings and tell you things you should know.[/b][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />This mod uses only items and such from the vanilla game, so nothing else is required. The ability to sit cross-legged, lean on things, and eat/drink while sitting are all part of a mod called Dovahkiin Relaxes Too, which you can get [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13931/?]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]Note that this mod replaces what I believe is a random camp. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s unimportant, but if not, please alert me immediately and I will relocate the house.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Now for something not important, but I did type it so reading it would be appreciated.~ :D\r<br />\r<br />Things such as food on plates, plates on tables, forks on tables, things on other things, all of that, can generally be knocked around by bumping into it. You&#39;ve probably had this happen when walking too close to a table. Well guess what? [b]NOT IN THIS MOD&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />See, I may or may not have accidentally put way too many things, way too close together, upon the table of feasting. This caused some, well... unwanted consequences. And so, I went back in and set [i]everything[/i] to not havok settle, as well as loading the defaultDisableHavokOnLoad script into them so now they don&#39;t do shiz. You can still pick them up and everything like that, they just wont fly everywhere if you happen to bump them. :D\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]In regards to the mannequin.[/b][/color]\r<br />I&#39;m not sure about what causes it to be walking around when you first load the house with the 1.2 update. I know mannequins are actually NPCs (which is kinda creepy, btw Bethesda), which definitely has something to do with it. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m missing some sort of script or if there is a checkbox I&#39;m overlooking. If anyone knows the fix, please post and I&#39;ll get right on it. :D\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=cyan]And finally&#33;[/color][/heading]\r<br />If you&#39;re downloading then first of all, THANK YOU&#33;&#33;&#33;..unless you don&#39;t like it, in which case [color=red]I hope you get torn limb from limb by angry atronachs.[/color] [color=yellow]:)[/color] Second of all; if you have any recommendations for things which I can add to this, please don&#39;t hesitate to say it&#33; I will try my best to accommodate.
