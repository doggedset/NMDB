  "descriptionHtml": "April 2014 Update: Holy cow, almost 50k downloads? I think it was like 5k the last time I checked. Very nice to see that people have found the mod useful. I read some of the comments and I&#39;VE NOW CHANGED THE PERMISSIONS SO IF ANYONE WANTS TO UPDATE THE MOD OR USE IT IN THEIR OWN WORK, FEEL FREE TO DO SO. Skyrim has been patched over a dozen times and all the DLCs have been released since I made this mod, so an update is in order. I just installed Skyrim again with the intention of checking out the DLCs, so I may update the mod myself, but if someone else feels like doing so, go ahead.\r<br />\r<br />Changelog:\r<br />-v1.4: New [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7159]Witcher 2 Helmet Pack[/url] helmets for Whiterun, Markarth, Solitude, Riften and Falkreath. Check screenshot. Also tweaked the occurence of vanilla helmets: now Hide and Leather Helmets are mostly worn by guards in Stormcloak holds, whereas guards in Imperial holds wear Imperial and Imperial Light Helmets instead.\r<br /> \r<br />-v1.3 Update: Dawnstar Cuirass meshes now properly weighted + added 1st person view meshes.\r<br />-v1.3: New helmets for Markarth and Solitude, new cuirass for Dawnstar. Original meshes and textures by CD Projekt RED, cuirass ported by L0rd0fWar, helmets ported by redxavier. \r<br />\r<br />-v1.21: Quick bugfix.\r<br />-v1.2: Now includes [url=http://skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1938648]edwardvlad&#39;s[/url] excellent [url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6024]Skyrim Stormcloaks Enhanced[/url] mesh and textures, replacing the armor of male Stormcloak soldiers and male Windhelm guards. A huge thank you to him.\r<br />Guards now carry either Iron or Steel arrows (previously only Steel).\r<br />Guards now carry either a Long Bow, a Hunting Bow, or a new weapon called Guard&#39;s bow (Hunting Bow&#39;s stats with Imperial Bow&#39;s looks).\r<br />Removed Leather Helmet from Markarth and Solitude, replaced it with Imperial Light Helmet.\r<br />Removed Steel Helmet from Winterhold.\r<br />Added Imperial Light Helmet to Falkreath and Morthal.\r<br />Added Fur Helmet to Morthal, Dawnstar and Winterhold.\r<br />Replaced Winterhold guards&#39;  Fur Gauntlets with Fur Bracers.\r<br />Added a new weapon called Fancy Steel Greatsword to Stormcloak Soldiers&#39; Greatsword list. (Steel Greatsword&#39;s stats, Silver Greatsword&#39;s looks).\r<br />\r<br />-v1.1: Added Iron Shield and Banded Iron Shield to Stormcloak Soldiers&#39; shield list (previously only hide and steel).\r<br />Made a new item called Fancy Steel Sword and added it to guards&#39; sword list (the new sword looks like a one-handed Silver Sword but has the same stats as the normal Steel one).\r<br />Created a separate leveled list for each hold to allow for more customization in the future.\r<br />Tweaked a bunch of stuff I&#39;d previously overlooked.\r<br />Added an optional version that removes the fullface helmet from guards altogether.\r<br />Added an optional version that adds two-handed weapons to guards&#39; weapon list.\r<br />\r<br />-v1b: Changed the boots on Falkreath guards from Thieves Guild Boots to a new item called Falkreath Guard Boots\r<br />-v1: Initial release\r<br />\r<br />------\r<br />\r<br />The guards seemed a bit too much like faceless robots, so I decided to give them a little variety and personality.\r<br />\r<br />All guards now have a random helmet from the following list:\r<br />-Leather\r<br />-Hide\r<br />-Steel\r<br />-Stormcloak (regular guard helmet)\r<br />\r<br />Stormcloak soldiers have a random helmet from the following list:\r<br />-Leather\r<br />-Iron\r<br />-Stormcloak\r<br />-Hide\r<br />-Scaled\r<br />-Steel\r<br />-Bandages\r<br />\r<br />In addition I made the following changes:\r<br />-Falkreath guards wear gloves and Thieves Guild Boots (edit: no more, check changelog)\r<br />-Markarth guards wear Imperial Light Bracers and Imperial Light Boots\r<br />-Windhelm guards wear Fur Gauntlets and Iron Boots + added sleeves to cuirass\r<br />-Riften guards wear Leather Bracers and Leather Boots\r<br />-Whiterun guards wear gloves and Hide Boots\r<br />-Stormcloak soldiers wear Iron Gauntlets and Iron Boots + added sleeves to cuirass\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: The changes only affect newly spawned guards, so to get the full effect you should start a new game. \r<br />...or murder every guard in Skyrim and wait for them to respawn. &gt;;3\r<br />(Edit: Apparently the mod works just fine on existing saves for some people.)\r<br />\r<br />I might add or change stuff based on feedback. So suggestions are welcome.\r<br />\r<br />Other soups I&#39;ve stuck my spoon in:\r<br />[url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5237]dfacto&#39;s Ivory Weapons and Armor[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6524]Shodan44&#39;s Black and Gold Elven Equipment[/url]\r<br />\r<br />For a more diverse Skyrim, I suggest combining this mod with:\r<br />[url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2042]Imperial Legion Overhaul by TheCrustyDemon[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4084]Skyrims city guards overhaul by timonier[/url]",
