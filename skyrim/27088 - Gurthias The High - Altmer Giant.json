  "summary": "Gurthias puts the \\\"High\\\" in High Elf to a new extreme.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Gurthias was sent from the SummerSet Isle by the Thalmor to try and create ties with the Giants of Skyrim as even the simple passer-by of any Giant can tell that they are somekind of long-lost race of Mer.\r\n\r\nGiants have Elven like ears and to me, are some sort of primitive Elf race that got big somehow.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a retextured Giant with the appearance of an Altmer, basically all I did is make a Giant yellow and try to pass him off as a overgrown Altmer male in skimpy armor xD\r\n\r\nGurthias is skilled in one hand and two handed weapons and has a decent amount of HP but is not invincible and when not in combat is ridiculously slow and speeding him up a may work so i will look into that.\r\n\r\nCan be found outside the Thalmor Embassy near Solitude.\r\nhas the default vanilla Follower package.\r\nHe IS useful for carrying a ton of equipment as his encumbrance/weight limit is 9999+\r\n\r\nGiant Dunmer next",
