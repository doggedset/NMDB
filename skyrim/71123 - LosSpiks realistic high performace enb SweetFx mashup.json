  "descriptionHtml": "This Enb Preset is a mash up I made at home to achieve maximum realistic look with high performance. Im runnning a Core i3 4130 8gbs ram and an AMD 5770. With my graphics card looking rather sad I have pefected the mix of performace and realism into an ENB, I get 30fps with the ENB enabled. I use a sly mix sweetfx lighting and ENB Â after effects. \r<br />\r<br />I have enabled Ambient occlusion but dropped quality to maximum Beauty V Efficiently, DoF is disabled as its pretty in screenshots but unrealistic, Enhanced shadows, god rays survive though I recommend 4.3 ENB for performance and beauty and sweetfx 1.5 or newer. Shout outs go to all the great modders out there without whom my elder scrolls experience wouldnt be the same.\r<br />\r<br /> Im a Nexus devoty for years and decided after many years to share my settings with the community. Hope you guys enjoy it. Ill post my mod list for anyone wanting same the same outcome as my screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />Please post any screenshots as thanks Im a tamriel traveller and enjoy to see the beauty on display.",
