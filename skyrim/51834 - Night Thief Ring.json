  "descriptionHtml": "Legend says that this ring once belonged to an infamous Night Thief, he was long before the Gray Fox. Now it showed up right where you start your journey.........\r<br />\r<br />Found at the smithing area in Riverwood, on top/around the Iron Ingots on the floor next to the armor table is the ring.\r<br />\r<br />What it gives you:\r<br />\r<br />- Automatic 1 hit kill Unarmed&#33;\r<br />- The best Sneak Skill you can imagine\r<br />- Lock picking so high that it requires you to move the mouse a fraction of an inch to get the correct placement of your pick. (YES I plan on fixing this and adding maybe 1 or two more things to the ring in the very near future.)\r<br />\r<br />*** DO NOT disenchant at a table&#33;&#33;&#33; It will give you the FIRST enchantment and the base Vanilla stat***\r<br />\r<br />*If you can&#39;t locate the ring (maybe you got in a fight and it got kicked or something) just type in the console help night and scroll up via pg up button to look for the ring.",
