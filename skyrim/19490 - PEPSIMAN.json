  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE: 6/27/2012 - \r\nFixed the enchant. Nobody pointed it out, but the head was missing the enchant. That\\'s fixed now for a true 1000 extra stamina.\r\nNow adds run speed boot enchants. Four separate boots;\r\n- 25, for a quarter faster run speed. Use if you don\\'t wanna get to places quick.\r\n- 50 for two 25\\'s at once. That\\'s fast!\r\n- 100 for double run speed. Holy smokes!\r\n- GOTTA GO FAST speed. Trust me, you\\'ll wanna use TGM for that.\r\n\r\nOne day, in Riverwood;\r\n\r\nDorthe: \\\\\\\"Pepsi please!\\\\\\\"\r\nLucan Valerius: \\\\\\\"We\\\\\\'re out.\\\\\\\"\r\nDorthe: \\\\\\\"Aw..\\\\\\\"\r\n\r\nSomewhere down the south road, a figure approaches at breakneck speed. The door slams open to Riverwood Trader as Dorthe was about to leave. Pepsiman ran into the door as Dorthe slammed it open.\r\n\r\nLucan and Dorthe: *Gasp!*\r\nPepsiman: *FIZZ*\r\nLucan and Dorthe: \\\\\\\"Thanks Pepsiman!\\\\\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=======\r\nFound at Riverwood, just outside the blacksmith in a dresser. It\\\\\\'s clothing, each piece giving 250 extra stamina. There\\\\\\'s also a spellbook that teaches you how to do the fizz (Restoration spell, zero cost, restores 100 stamina to target on touch. Same as Healing Hands in every other aspect). No first person models, as it\\'s meant to be in third person. Might update the boots for run speed, but I didn\\'t know how to do that.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, look for the PEPSIMAN folders in Meshes and Data.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT1:\r\nThis is based off of a variant of his costume, as seen in a couple commercials. I couldn\\'t do the asymmetrical ones since the costumes didn\\'t quite allow me to do that. Trust me, I did want the one with the single silver arm, but it just didn\\'t work out. ",
