  "descriptionHtml": "[color=yellow][size=3][b]Description:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Easy food is an alternative vanilla-friendly solution to cooking and food. If you want to give a reason to cooking but don&#39;t like invasive &#34;needs&#34; solution, then this mod may be for you.\r<br />\r<br />Basically &#34;Restore Health&#34; effects has been removed from uncooked food, you can still eat a tomato or a potato, but you will gain no effects. You are now basically forced to cook ingredients if you want to have a &#34;Restore Health&#34; alternative to Alchemy.\r<br />Also Drinkables have now a &#34;Fortify Stamina&#34; effect, the reason of this is to force player to use Stamina potions which are a bit underrated in the game in my hopinion.\r<br />\r<br />This mod was made by me almost 2 years ago, but i have decided to refine it and upload it only after many community messages that encourage me to keep up the modding work. If you enjoy my mods, please consider to donate, even few cents will make me happy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][size=3][b]Main features in pills:\r<br />[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Only cooked food have &#34;Restore Health&#34; effect.\r<br />[*]Wine and Ale have now &#34;Fortify Stamina&#34; instead of &#34;Restore Stamina&#34;.
