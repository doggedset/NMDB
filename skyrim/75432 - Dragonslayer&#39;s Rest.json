As the name suggests, the dungeon is the final resting place of a long forgotten Nordic hero, but now it&#39;s been infested with bandits and criminals looking to make the ancient tomb a new hideout. Why not go inside and try and take them out?\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Compatibility andÂ Dependencies\r<br />[/b][/size]Dragonslayer&#39;s Rest is compatible with all mods that don&#39;t modify the same area as the dungeon&#39;s exterior.\r<br />\r<br />It only requires you have the base game, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. No DLCs or mods are required to play this dungeon.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]My First Mod\r<br />[/b][/size]Please bear in mind that this is my first ever mod before downloading- any constructive criticism or bug reports would be greatly appreciated&#33; I was just looking to get some practice with this dungeon, and any help/tips improving future mods would be great&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Other Info\r<br />[/b][/size]Thanks for taking a look at my mod; I hope you enjoy it, even though it&#39;s relatively small. [b]Any [/b]feedback would be fantastic, and maybe even endorse my mod if you want?",
