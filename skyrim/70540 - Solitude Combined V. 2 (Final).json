  "descriptionHtml": "NEEDS SKSE or the DYNDOLOD doesn&#39;t work. DYNDOLOD is script dependent.\r<br />\r<br />There is an optional patch for users of LEGACY OF THE DRAGONBORN. It&#39;s just a different version of my esp, so you can use it INSTEAD OF the esp in the main file. Simple place it below LOTD and you should be good to go.\r<br />\r<br />This Mod merges the following mods;\r<br />\r<br />JKs Solitude\r<br />Myownsolitudeimprovements\r<br />Solitude A City Of Trade LITE&#33;\r<br />Solitude ExpansionLIGHT\r<br />SolitudeCapitalEdition\r<br />TRUE CITY TGES\r<br />Solitude Reborn\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />All vanilla buildings are unaffected inside the city and outside.\r<br />It affects the docks from under the Arch up to the city gate. It also affects a small potion of land across from the docks. \r<br />\r<br />General;\r<br />\r<br />Not for POTATO PC&#39;s. There is a lot of clutter and it will kill framerate if your PC isn&#39;t fairly beefy.\r<br />\r<br />Does not conflict with &#34;NOTICE BOARD&#34;\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t know how many new interiors/Npcs there are. I used all of the interiors from the other mods, plus made some for my stuff. All the houses, shops and halls have interiors. It&#39;s big, really big. There are more than 100 new interior spaces, and more than half are custom. \r<br />\r<br />All non-vanilla interiors have been completely redone with hand made Navmesh and interior Data. Most lighting/sound has been re-balanced. Gaps in walls and floors have been fixed, or hidden. (If you have had problems using one of the mods above with followers it was probably because the Navmesh was CK generated.)\r<br />\r<br />No vanilla interiors were messed with. All the original buildings are still in there original 3d space.\r<br />\r<br />The Pitt isn&#39;t a full betting gladiatorial arena, and it won&#39;t be. That requires scripts and I&#39;m not interested. (If you stay until a champion emerges let me know who won.) If you want to make it functional I would love to see that&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The Sewers are NOT MINE&#33; I have no idea if the point of them works or not. It is massive and I spent an exhaustive amount of time cleaning the Navmesh and seams up, but kudo&#39;s to the author because it is beautiful.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />\r<br />V7 has 1 fix. Excess meshes in the character folder have been removed\r<br />\r<br />The BSA version has stutter, and LOD problems just outside the main gate. I&#39;m leaving it just in case you want to try the mod and would like an easy way to discard it.\r<br />\r<br />No LOD version was asked for. I have created a BSA version. Do not use unless you know how DYNDOLOD works and plan on using it. No support will be given for no LOD version except if errors are reported.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />If you want to patch something or mess with the file be my guest. If you want to do something extensive with it P.M. If I don&#39;t respond in 1 week consider full permission given\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I suggest using an alternate start mod like &#34;Alternate Start - Live Another Life&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to DR.
