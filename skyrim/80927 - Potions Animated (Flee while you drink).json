  "descriptionHtml": "(Hi guys, if you are having issues getting the mod to work, please install the 1.3 version. As the 1.0 version had a missing file which lead it to not work, sorry about that and thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1710464]rubenpaca[/url] for bringing it to my attention quickly. Be sure to let me know if there's other issues with getting it to work)\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=4]What is this?\n<br />[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />This is a small modification of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/856457/?]Manaflow[/url]s 'potions animated' mod (found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28114/?]here[/url]), which causes your character to play a drinking animation when you consume a potion. My modification of this mod allows you to still move whilst your character plays the drinking potion animation.\n<br />\n<br />I enjoyed the original mod but was frustrated that my character couldn't chug a potion and still move around, made drinking health potions in combat somewhat redundant as I'd lose the health I gained while I drank it.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][u]Installation\n<br />[/u][/b][/size]\n<br />Just drop the files in your data folder and enable the esp, this should be used to override [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/856457/?]Manaflow[/url]s mod if you're already using it, as the script names and esp are the same.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=4]Requirements[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />You will however need to download and run [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11811/?]FNIS[/url] in order for the modified animation to work.\n<br />[b][u][size=3]\n<br />Uninstall[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />It should be as safe as uninstalling any mod mid-playthrough (scripts will always bake into the save file, though you can try a save cleaner), just make sure you type \"Stopquest _InventoryCheckMQ\" in the console first.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Credits[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to:\n<br />Bethesda for making the game.\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/856457/?]Manaflow[/url] for the permission to upload this.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/29714795]migeandend[/url] for the faster animation file, go check out his [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86263]potion animation mod[/url] if you want what this mod does but for npcs too, as well as more functionality/MCM etc.",
