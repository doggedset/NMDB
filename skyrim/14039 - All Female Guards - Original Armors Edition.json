  "descriptionHtml": "[size=7][center][color=red]ALL FEMALE GUARDS[/size][/center][/color]\r\n[size=5][center][color=red]Original Armors Edition[/size][/center][/color]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs36/i/2008/282/2/6/Spartana___Female_Warrior_002_by_Selficide_Stock.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=5][center][color=red]This mod will change every Skyrim City Guard into a Female Guard[/center][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=6][color=yellow][center]Note about Dawnguard Questline[/size][/color][/center]\r\n[size=5]This mod was made before Dawnguard came out.  There is an easy fix for the Dragonbridge guards preventing the main Dawnguard quest from proceeding.  Travel to Dragonbridge, go inside a building, save and quit.  Deactivate the mod, go back outside, talk to one of the guards until you get the next quest objective, go back inside a building, save and quit. Activate the mod again...if you want.  Start game and continue playing.  I did this in my own game and it works fine.[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=yellow][center]The purpose of this mod is not to increase immersion, or provide a lore friendly environment...it\\'s purpose is to inject a certain amount of FANTASY into Skyrim...ENJOY![/size][/color][/center]  \r\n[size=3]\r\nAll guards will have the FEMALE NORD voice.  That is the only voice compatible with the male guards.  Otherwise they would not interact with you.  This does not change their behavior, or factions, or AI. They will still arrest you or kill you.\r\n\r\nA few guards that have UNIQUE Dialogue will now be silent.  For example, when you approach the Whiterun gate for the first time, the guard stops you and yells \\\"HALT...something something\\\".  The dialogue options will still be there for you to enter Whiterun, just the guard will be silent.  This also goes for the first time you enter the Riften gate.  This is not a bug, I could either keep the particular guards as dudes, give the female guard a male voice (which is weird), or change them to female and just leave them silent for these particular interactions...so I chose the latter.  They talk as normal afterwards.[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][color=red][size=5]Latest Version...ORIGINAL ARMORS EDITION - 5.0[/color][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][color=yellow]Description/Changes from previous Versions[/size][/u][/color]\r\n[size=3]\r\n- This version is Compatible with ALL Body Mods (CHSBHC, ADEC, UNP, CBBE)\r\n- It\\'s sets all Female Guard heights to .95 so they are slightly shorter than the men\r\n- It\\'s sets all Female Guard weights to 1-10, so they will have a C-D cup Breast when using Optional Skimpy Armors mod\r\n- All Guards will now wear the standard, vanilla guard uniforms (whatever is in your CK)[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][color=yellow]Required Mods...to get look like Guards in Screenshots[/size][/u][/color]\r\n[size=3]\r\n- Apachii SkyHair (I know they have helmets, but will have Apachii hair if you kill them, strip them, and reanimate them)\r\n- CHSBHC body mod and BBP - Breast and Butt Physics (CBBE works too)\r\n- CBBE Body Texture (to prevent seams at the hips)\r\n- Better Females by Bella\r\n- Optional Skimpy Guard Armor mod included in this file (CHSBHC, CBBE compatible only)\r\n- Friendly Guard Helmets by FurArmor[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=yellow][u]Special Notes[/size][/color][/u]\r\n[size=3]\r\n- There is NO Female Stormcloak boot in the CK.  Males and Females wear the same boot.  So in order to convert the female style of boot, I had to convert the male as well.  If you use the optional skimpy guard file, Stormcloak males will wear the \\\"legging\\\" style boot pictured above.  It\\'s not too distracting, and actually blends in pretty well with the default Stormcloak uniform, with a little clipping at the top.\r\n- If you remove the guard armor, the boots will clip into the body with the CHSBHC body mod.  The boots are CBBE compatible only, but will fit when wearing the included armor\r\n- Solitude female guards wear female imperial boots.  The skimpy armor guard file also includes a skimpy version of the imperial armor (heavy and light).  This was done to prevent female imperial soldiers with the CHSBHC body mod from clipping the new boots.  Don\\'t worry, if you like the skimpy armor style, you\\'ll like this too.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][color=yellow]Credits/Contributions to this Mod[/size][/u][/color]\r\n[size=3]\r\n- Imperial Boots original design (R18Pn04 Ritter Armor by NPR) retextured by me\r\n- Stormcloak Boots original design (Maxi Armor by MAK) retextured by me\r\n- Guard Helmets (Friendly Guard Helmets by FurArmor)[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][color=yellow]Recommended Mods...for Optimal Feminine Appearance[/size][/u][/color]\r\n[size=3]\r\n- Victorias High Heel Walk Animation (gives nice hip sway, feminine walk)\r\n- Pretty Female Idle (gives nice feminine stance)[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][size=5][color=red]********Must use with Apachii Hair...may cause CTDs without********[/center][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][size=3][u]INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS...If already using a previous version[/color][/size][/u]\r\n[size=3]\r\n- Deactivate AllFemaleGuards.esp in your Data folder (old version)\r\n- Start your game (you may see headless, naked male guards standing around like statues)\r\n- Fast travel somewhere, go into a few cell until the guards look normal again (they will be the vanilla male guards)\r\n- Save the game then exit to desktop\r\n- Install AllFemaleGuards.esp (new version)\r\n- Start your game\r\n- Enjoy![/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][size=5][color=red]DO NOT INSTALL THE NEW VERSION WITHOUT DELETING THE OLD VERSION FIRST[/center][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][size=3][u]CONFLICTING MODS/BUGS:[/color][/size][/u]\r\n[size=3]\r\n- If some of the Solitude guards don\\'t appear with boots, just go up to them and type resurrect \r\n- Will conflict with any mods that alter appearance or armor of guards\r\n- The guard outside of Falkreath will not convert to Female for some reason\r\n- I get a weird humming sound when I talk to the guards in Version 3.0 (not sure if it\\'s unique to my PC or not)\r\n[/size]\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4][center]If you like this mod, please endorse it...This will encourage me to keep updating it with new styles[/color][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][size=4]Use with my other mod...[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14626]SUPERMODEL SKYRIM[/url]...for the Ultimate Skyrim Beauty Experience[/center][/size]",
