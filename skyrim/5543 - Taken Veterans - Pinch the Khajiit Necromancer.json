  "descriptionHtml": "\r\nTaken Veterans - Balanced Character Builds\r\n\r\nPinch a Male Khajiit Necromancer\r\nor Cinch a Female Khajiit Necromancer\r\n\r\nPinch is a level 30 rapscallion of a necromancer. Sneaking into every situation, he approaches combat with a plan, stalks his prey while waiting for their moment of weakness, then pounces. Ambushes take out weaker opponents before their companions ever know what\\'s going on. Soon Pinch has a veritable army of zombies fighting for him, enabling him to find approaches to sneak attack distracted enemies.\r\n\r\nOne thing Pinch thinks you\\'ll agree on, it is too darn hard to do the right thing anymore. This Neutral Good scoundrel sees obstacles blocking people\\'s happines, and he simply clears them out of the way. In hindsight, he can always eagerly explain how his seemingly improper actions at the time were only for the greater good after all.\r\n\r\nPinch starts with 29 unallocated Perk Points, \r\n250 Magicka (+50 Highborn), \r\n190 Health, and \r\n150 Stamina\r\n\r\nPinch\\'s Initial Skills:\r\n\tConjuration 100\r\n\tIllusion, Sneak 75\r\n\tAlteration, One-Handed, Speech 50\r\n\tLight Armor, Restoration, Pickpocket, Lockpicking, Alchemy, Heavy Armor, Two-Handed, Destruction, Enchanting, Block, Smithing, Archery 15\r\n\r\n1*(100*101/2) + 2*(75*76/2) + 3*(50*51/2) + 12*(15*16/2)\r\n= 16,015 [url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Total Experience Spent In Skills[/url]\r\n\r\nPinch\\'s Starting Spells:\r\n\tBound Sword, Flaming Familiar, Soul Trap, Bound Bow, Dread Zombie, Dead Thrall\r\n\tMagelight, Detect Life, Telekinesis, Waterbreathing, Detect Dead, Ebonyflesh\r\n\tMuffle, Frenzy, Rally, Invisibility, Pacify, Rout\r\n\tFast Healing, Healing Hands, Steadfast Ward, Close Wounds, Heal Other, Circle of Protection\r\n\r\nPinch\\'s Known Shouts:\r\n\tThrow Voice (Zul Mey Gut)\r\n\tBecome Ethereal (Feim Zii Gron)\r\n\r\nPinch\\'s Additional Powers:\r\n\tHighborn (+50 Magicka)\r\n\tProwler\\'s Profit (Find more jewels)\r\n\t\r\nPinch\\'s Necro Gear:\r\n\tNecromancer Amulet\t(000c891d)\r\n\tVokun\t\t\t\t(00061cc9)\r\n\tJester\\'s Boots\t\t(000cee70)\r\n\tJester\\'s Clothes\t(000cee6e)\r\n\tJester\\'s Gloves\t\t(000cee74)\r\n\tJester\\'s Hat\t\t(000cee72)\r\n\t\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n3.0 Focused the build. Very fun double Dead Thralls\r\n2.0 All new, full-on necro \r\n1.0 Pinch 1.0\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\\\"Veterans\\\" are pre-built characters, skilled and equipped in tune with the limitations of their experience. The entire game is unexplored, and adapted to your new level--allowing you to try out advanced play-styles and quest-lines avoiding hours of required preliminaries.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhenever a character earns a rank, r, in a skill they gain r experience. When a character has 0 in all skills they have zero experience, and when they have 100 in all skills, at level 81.5, they have 90,900 experience. A character normally hits Level 30 at 15,865 Total Experience.\r\n\r\nTaken Veterans should look good with any texture or mesh mods you may use, if any. The mods used in the screenshots include:\r\nFace Textures (Female): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3563]Coverwomen[/url]\r\nFace Textures (Male): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=26]Detailed Faces[/url]\r\n\r\nLook in the discussions area for the batch commands allowing you to make a veteran out of a character you\\'ve created yourself!\r\n\r\nMore Info:\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Experience Table[/url]\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimCharBatch]Tips on making your own veterans[/url]\r\n\r\nDrop a Taken Veteran save game in your Saves folder and load it up.
