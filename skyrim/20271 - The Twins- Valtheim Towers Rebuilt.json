  "descriptionHtml": "Summary:\r\nSince no one has ever considered to rebuilt the Valtheim Towers, I\\'ve decided to do it myself. I based the idea of the design from \\\"The Twins\\\" which a bridge/fortress from the show \\\"Game Of Thrones\\\". I replaced the two shitty nord buildings with 4 bricked guard houses. The original bridge has been enlarged to allow horses to pass through the bridge. There are two gates on the bridge and two gates on the paths near the bridge for greater defense. There are four catapults on top of each tower.\r\n\r\nMinor Issues:\r\n\r\nIf you are far away from the towers, you\\'ll see the original vanilla towers for some reason. Once you get close enough, you\\'ll see the new design.\r\n\r\nThe two gates on the bridge are not solid. I have no idea why they are like that. I left them open and they can be made to open and close. If anyone knows how to fix the issue, please let me know.\r\n\r\nLet me know of any other issues. \r\n\r\nThanks",
