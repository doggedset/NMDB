Sets the Min/Max height for the world map to let you see the whole map at once or to zoom way in. Increased panning range. Two versions: One sets the pitch to 90° when the map is first opened, the other does not change it.[/color]\r<br /> \r<br />Please note that I do not have Dragonborn installed, so have not released a version for it. Using it should not cause any problems, it just won&#39;t work there. The &#34;No Fog&#34; optional addon may work there, but I have no way to verify it.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][b]NEW:[/b][/color]  \r<br /> \r<br />[LIST]\r<br />[*][color=#00BFFF][b] For those of you who have been eagerly awaiting a way to get rid of the fog at higher alitituds, you will find a new file (&#34;World_Map_No_Fog&#34;) in the optional files section which clears the fog. You should be able to use this whether or not you use the main part of my mod. Thank you to uncannychuckles for showing me how to do it.[/b][/color][/*]\r<br />[*][color=#ffffff]The list of files on the files tab was about to get rather lengthy, so you will now find two archive files, each of which contains all the files for a particular pitch[/color][/*]\r<br />[/LIST]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff][b][size=4]WARNING:[/size][/b]\r<br />While you can continue to use the old versions (they will still work), I recommend you update to the new version to prevent possible problems. If you do decide to continue with an older version, be very careful that you do NOT clean it with TES5Edit, as it will completely kill the mod (it will literally delete all the changes). This is not something wrong with either TES5Edit or with my mod, but is due to the changes introduced sometime after the initial 1.8 patch.[/color]\r<br />\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ffffff][b][i][size=4]If you want more details, continue reading below, otherwise you can skip to the [/size][/i][/b][/color][color=#ffff00][b][i][size=4]Recommended Mod[/size][/i][/b][/color][color=#ffffff][b][i][size=4]s section.[/size][/i][/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]Detailed Information:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />There are four settings that no longer work, and this mod addresses the first three:\r<br />\r<br />fMapWorldInitialPitch: The initial pitch angle of the Map camera view each time you run Skyrim\r<br />fMapWorldMaxHeight: Maximum height above Map for mouse wheel &#34;zoom&#34;\r<br />fMapWorldMinHeight: Minimum height above Map for mouse wheel &#34;zoom&#34;\r<br />sMapCloudNIF: NIF file path for the Map&#39;s animated cloud cover. Setting it to an empty (null) string used to remove the clouds so you could see the ground clearly [i](see recommended mods section for a fix)[/i]\r<br />\r<br />This mod also increases the pan distance to the north and west (up and left) so that you can zoom all the way down to the minimum height in those areas.\r<br />\r<br />This mod sets the Min Height, Max Height and Initial Pitch for the World Map as follows:\r<br />\r<br />World_Map_Height_Pitch_Tweak_130:\r<br />\r<br />    Min Height (5000)\r<br />    Max Height (130000)\r<br />    Initial Pitch (90)\r<br />\r<br />World_Map_Height_Pitch_Tweak_xxx:\r<br />\r<br />Same as above excpet that Max Height (xxx) is:\r<br />\r<br />    xxx=170 (170000)\r<br />    xxx=200 (200000)\r<br />    xxx=250 (250000)\r<br />    \r<br />The second group of files (World_Map_Height_Pitch_Tweak_xxx) settings change the max height as noted above, and allow you to see nearly all, or all, of the whole map at once when you zoom out all the way.\r<br />\r<br />The new 90-pitch file (&#34;World_Map_Height_Pitch_Tweak_Vanilla_pitch_90.esp&#34;) changes only the pitch to 90, and leaves the min/max height the same as in vanilla Skyrim (50000/80000). It is included in the &#34;_90_pitch&#34; archive.\r<br />\r<br />The first file (World_Map_Height_Pitch_Tweak_130) settings are what is recommended by IcePenguin for his &#34;A Quality World Map - With Roads&#34; mod.\r<br />\r<br />The &#34;_50_pitch&#34; version does exactly the same thing, except the pitch on all the files is set to 50 (same as vanilla Skyrim):\r<br />\r<br />    World_Map_Height_Pitch_Tweak_xxx_50\r<br />\r<br />I have removed the individual files for pitch=90 because of the change requiring that Update.esm be added as a master.\r<br />\r<br />Please note that I have been unable to remove the fog/opaqueness that occurs at the very high altitudes. If someone figures it out, please let me know, & I&#39;ll add it, and give you the credit for it.\r<br />\r<br />This mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you wish to increase the zoom speed with the mouse when you are viewing the map you need to add the following setting to the [MapMenu] section of your Skyrim.ini file.\r<br />\r<br />If you do not have that section, then add it. Skyrim.ini is found in the following folder:    My DocumentsMy GamesSkyirim\r<br />\r<br />    fMapWorldZoomSpeed=0.1500\r<br />\r<br />Note that I like it to zoom very fast. You can change the number to whatever works for you, or just leave it alone. IcePenguin&#39;s recommendation for this setting is:   0.0750\r<br />\r<br />======================================\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=5]Recommended Mods[/size][/color]\r<br />======================================\r<br />\r<br />All the picts are taken with the following installed and are highly recommended:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5739][color=#008000]World Map - Skyrim Hold Borders[/color][/url] by ChromeWarriorXIII and IcePenguin\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14976][color=#008000]Atlas Map Markers and Dawnguard Addon (formerly Secondary Map Markers)[/color][/url] by Kronixx\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4929][color=#008000]A Quality World Map - With Roads &#34;Clear Map Add-on&#34;[/color][/url] by IcePenguin\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26556][color=#008000]EzEs -Colored Map Markers&#34; by xEightballx (Colored Map Markers - 1 - White Outline version)[/color][/url] by xEightballx\r<br />\r<br />The following was not used for the picts, but is also highly recommended:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4817][color=#008000]High Quality 3D Map (High Res Meshes)[/color][/url] by Ethatron\r<br />\r<br />======================================\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=5]Installation Requirements[/size][/color]\r<br />======================================\r<br />\r<br />Official Skyrim patch 1.8.151 or greater.
