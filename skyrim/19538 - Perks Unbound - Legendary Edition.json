  "summary": "Perks Unbound allows you to skip past perks you don&#39;t want or need, so that way you are not wasting precious perk points. The only requirements that have been maintained, with some minor exceptions, are skill level requirements.\r<br />\r<br />E.g. If you are only interested in &#34;Dragon Smithing&#34; you don&#39;t need to take all of the perks",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://SkyrimGEMS.com/images/badge_featured.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />Perks Unbound - Legendary Edition\r<br />[left]=============================\r<br />Perks Unbound is a spiritual successor for ClassicNoodle&#39;s &#34;No Perk Prerequisites&#34;,\r<br />which is a Pre-CK mod, and pre-CK tools have been proven to corrupt\r<br />mods (TESVSnip specifically), so I decided to make the mod from the\r<br />ground up with the Creation Kit. \r<br />\r<br />The purpose of this mod is to remove all but the skill requirements for perks, so that way you\r<br />can skip the perks you don&#39;t want.\r<br />\r<br />There are some minor exceptions: \r<br />- Novice to Master perks are left untouched.\r<br />-Steady Hand: Requires “Eagle Eye” to function, and \r<br />\r<br />-Disarming Bash requires Power Bash for the same reason\r<br />- Impact:Is useless without Destruction Dual Casting. \r<br />\r<br />Installation Requirements\r<br />======================\r<br />Official Skyrim patch1.9.32.0.8 or greater.\r<br />\r<br />Perks Unbound - Merged.esp and Perks Unbound - Helmless Warrior - Merged.esp: Both require the Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch\r<br />\r<br />Perks Unbound.esp and Perks Unbound - Helmless Warrior.esp: Both require the Unofficial Skyrim Patch\r<br />\r<br />And of course: DLCs are required for the DLC-specific patch files\r<br />\r<br />Installation \r<br />=========\r<br />Install Perks Unbound with your favourite mod manager\r<br />\r<br />For a manual installation: Extract the archive to your data folder in your Skyrim\r<br />directory.\r<br />\r<br />Load Order\r<br />=========\r<br />I would recommend using LOOT for your load order needs: http://loot.github.io/\r<br />\r<br />The load order should be:Perks Unbound.esp --&gt; Perks Unbound – Dawnguard.esp --&gt; Perks\r<br />Unbound – Dragonborn.esp\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The Helmless Warrior optional download follows the same order\r<br />guidelines.\r<br />\r<br />Perks Unbound - Merged.esp – Use this if you have both Dawnguard and Dragonborn to save 2 ESP slots\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstalling Perks Unbound\r<br />=======================\r<br />Nothing special, so just remove as with your mod manager of choice, or remove the files\r<br />manually if installed manually.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Optional Download: Perks Unbound - Helmless Warrior\r<br />=============================================\r<br />This is a version of Perks Unbound where a Helmet is not required for Armor\r<br />perks to function, and that does not require you to download the main\r<br />file.\r<br />\r<br />1) Helmets are no longer required for armor perks to function.\r<br />2) The perks modified are: Cushioned, Well Fitted,Matching Set, Reflect Blows, Custom Fit, Matching Set, Wind Walker,\r<br />Deft Movement, DLC1DawnguardItemPerk, DLC2MatchingSet,\r<br />DLC2MatchingSetHeavy.\r<br />3) The Abilities &#34;PerkWindWalkerStamina&#34;and &#34;PerkAbReflectBlows&#34; also needed to be modified for\r<br />this mod to work as intended. \r<br />4) The Spells &#34;DBFullSet&#34;and &#34;TGFullSet&#34; have been modified (Shrouded Armor and\r<br />Nightingale Armor matching set bonuses).\r<br />5) Like &#34;No HelmetsRequired&#34; you won&#39;t be able to mix armor types. Wearing a light\r<br />armor helmet would negate all heavy armor perks above except for the\r<br />matching set perks.\r<br />6) I have modified the necessary &#34;SPEL&#34;entries in the creation kit, so that way all the armor set perks work\r<br />as expected.[/left]",
