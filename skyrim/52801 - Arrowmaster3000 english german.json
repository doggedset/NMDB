  "descriptionHtml": "there are some big changes to the archery perktree and a minor changes to the stealth tree.\r<br />If you have any mods that alter these two trees, there will be most probably some incompabilities.\r<br />\r<br />first of all the new skills in the archery perks are.\r<br />\r<br />-serrated arrowheads-2 stages,passive,requires 30(60)skill\r<br />causes bleedingdamage overtime.the damages stack which proves useful against enemies with lots of\r<br />health or fast regenerating opponents like trolls..\r<br />\r<br />-Trickshot-passive,requires skill 80 and the skill -hunters discipline-\r<br />the skill was already implemented in the CK,but never made to the game.\r<br />A succesful hit will make them drop their bow and draw melee weapon instead.\r<br />\r<br />-bullseye-2 stages,passive required skill is 100(110)\r<br />i never liked theoriginal bullseye skill,because first .the chance for hitting it\r<br />is just to high,secondly,there is some nuisance when shooting longrange you will notice the aim is getting paralyzed \r<br />even before the arrow actually hits it.\r<br />this problem is described in the UESPwiki in the archery description.\r<br />\r<br />so i changed the perk to what i think is really worthy to be called a mastershot or maybe more a lucky shot.\r<br />There is a 1% chance to kill every target onstrike careless how much health it actually has .\r<br />a wolf with a 100 hp will die,aslike as an dragon with 10000 hps.additionally damage is raised by 25%.\r<br />The chance is raised to 5% at second stage of Bullseye and additionally crit damage is increased by 25%.\r<br />\r<br />-overdraw-passive 5 instances.\r<br />so from historic knowledge the invention of longbows and crossbows caused the end of the \r<br />classic knights in full plate armor.Battle of Agincourt as example.\r<br />\r<br />So if an archer is capable of overdrawing his bow i thought it would be only reasonable to \r<br />not only increase the damage but alongside increase the armor negotiation.\r<br />This means every skill put into -Overdraw- will raise damage 20% and also ignore 20% armorrating of the target\r<br />up to 100% with all 5 instances of the perk.\r<br />it sounds overpowered but you will see on legendary difficulty that it will just help you to merely survive a battle or \r<br />do visible damage at all.\r<br />\r<br />i also altered the quickshot perk from 30% to 50% more drawspeed.\r<br />I left the critical perks and eagleye unchanged to make the bow not to powerful on lower levels.\r<br />all benefits come with bullseye perk which is for high level characters.\r<br />\r<br />the change to the stealth tree is ,that now you wont be forced to probably waste a point into backstab,\r<br />if you really want to play as an archer .\r<br />-deadly aim is already obtainable with one skill in stealth.\r<br />-The factor for sneak damage is raised from 2x to x5 \r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />1 using nMM\r<br />2 manual:unpack directory.place Arrowmaster3000ENG.esp in Data Folder.\r<br />  select in Launcher.done&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall:\r<br />unselect esp. in launcher and remove esp. from data folder.done.\r<br />\r<br />have fun,\r<br />Ladida",
