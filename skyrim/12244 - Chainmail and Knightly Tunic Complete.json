  "descriptionHtml": "For several months i have searched the nexus for a chainmail outfit that was knightish/crusader-like. However i didn\\'t find it. What i did find was a modder\\'s resource that had what i wanted, but the author had discontinued work on it, and the few replies of other members saying that their attempt to get it to work in the creation kit failed left me disillusioned at this mod coming to fruition. However, i decided to see for myself if these textures wouldn\\'t work in the creation kit so that way i could sleep at night since i would have a least tried. However i succeeded and this is the fruit of my labors.\r\n\r\nplease give Moveing credit for creating the textures. if you want the resource its here..... http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7267\r\n\r\nIncludes two armors for males ( when the textures where applied to the female counterpart of the base clothing, it got all weird.) and will work with whatever male body replacer you use.\r\n\r\n- craftable ( need the steel smithing perk), ( 2 steel ingots and a bear pelt each)\r\n- temperable ( i steel ingot each)\r\n- light armor ( tagged as such so it should be affected by the relevent perks)\r\n- standalone\r\n- under the mic tab at the forge\r\n\r\nto install copy the data file to your data file. if asked to merge, etc say yes.\r\n\r\nCredits;\r\nbethesda for skyrim\r\nMoveing for the textures\r\n\r\ncan improve upon this mod if wished, but please no uploading to 3rd party sites, especially Steam workshop.\r\n ",
