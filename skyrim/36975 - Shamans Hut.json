It\\'s dedicated to him, as I think he sadly\r\nquited modding. One of his last pictures was the [color=#dd8800]Shaman\\'s Home[/color]. Once I\\'ve seen it I thought damn I need this. Sadly he didn\\'t continue to work on it at the moment. So this house is inspired by the following picture. Sure it\\'s different and I created the inside and also changed the surrounding environment, tho it was not really my idea. I hope you understand that and enjoy my version of the mod. Please see it as honoration of a great modder !\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://www.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/318919213666434z31ek985y.jpg[/img]\r\nby [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3189192/?tb=feed&pUp=1]RatFinkk[/url]\r\n[i]Also you should visit his page and check out his great homes[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nWell now I would like you to tell a little bit about the home. This time it\\'s a smaller home which is cosy and themed around the life of a Shaman. The name of the house is [color=#dd8800]Shaman\\'s Hut[/color]. To get it you have to kill the previous owner which turned crazy, and awaits you outside the house. The house itself uses the giant mudcrab shell as base and is overgrown by a telvanni mushroom. Inside you will find a really cozy and fine atmsophere. The base structure is also a mushroom. Also each thing is sized appropriate to the outside. You\\'ll even see the smoke of the cooking place outside.\r\nYou can find the house directly outside morthal, which provides a nice and realistic location for a Shaman.\r\n\r\n[i][color=darkorange]Special feature:[/color][/i]\r\nA unique Voodoo doll created by a really great modder named [color=darkorange]Tamira[/color].\r\nThe doll will give you the \\\"Spirit of Voodoo\\\" once you activated it, which enhanced your potions by 10 percent for 30 minutes and your magicka by 80 for 8 hours. It also cures your diseases.\r\n\r\nNow to the features of the house !!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/features34sodb1l86.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[u][color=#cc5511]Outside:[/color][/u]\r\n- Unique really unique looking home\r\n- some flora aroudn the house\r\n- Nice lightning\r\n\r\n[u][color=#cc5511]Inside:[/color][/u]\r\n- cooking place\r\n- alchemy table and enchanting station\r\n- custom made sleeping map by [color=drakorange]Tamira[/color]\r\n- 3 weapon racks\r\n- unique design to look totally like a Shaman\\'s house, where he collects crazy various creatures\r\n\r\n[u][color=#cc5511]Small cave:[/color][/u]\r\n- 1 Mannequin to store your favorite Shaman\\'s outfit \r\n- unqiue structure and lot\\'s of flora and mushrooms\r\n- usable alchemy cauldron\r\n- the voodoo doll\r\n- sleeping place for a follower\r\n- small water palce, with 2 fishes\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/installationp6igv781c2.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nI would propose you to use the NMM manager to install this modification, because it\\'s the easiest way.\r\n\r\n[u][b]NMM:[/b][/u]\r\nKlick on the download with NMM manager button and install the mod.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Manual:[/b][/u]\r\nIf you want to install this mod manually, you have to download it and unpack the archive somewhere.
