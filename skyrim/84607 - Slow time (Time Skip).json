  "summary": "Have you ever seen time skip by hit in dragon ball? Or any show that has a person who can control time? This mod gives you that kind of power.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes slow time shout a lot more interesting by making it shorter, and use able more often. It makes time slow real, Time slow in vanilla was good but kind of overpowered and boring after some time. slowing time for 16seconds then waiting 45seconds until you can shout again was plain boring.\r<br />\r<br />As an Assassin player playing Skyrim for years, I found it quite useless after 10seconds. I most likely have killed every enemy by sneak attacks in less than 10seconds with shadow warrior or Shadow Cloak of Nocturnal. \r<br />\r<br />Now this mod makes the shout much more fun to have, It can be used in purpose of Teleportation or slow time, now it gives you the bad ass feeling of stopping time and when it returns, you&#39;re standing behind the enemy&#39;s back.\r<br />\r<br />I have edited the shouts to be\r<br />\r<br />Word 1 TIID : Slows timeÂ  by 80% for 2 seconds | 10 seconds cool down (Means you will have to wait 8 seconds after the shout ends.)\r<br />Word 2 KLO : Slows time by 90% for 3seconds | 10 seconds cool down (Means you will have to wait 7seconds after the shout ends.)\r<br />Word 3 UL : Slows time by 99% for 5seconds | 10 seconds cool down (Means you will have to wait 5seconds after the shout ends.) \r<br />\r<br />Hope you guys like it, report to me any bugs (Pretty sure there is none.) And I can adjust the mod on request.\r<br />\r<br />My mods : \r<br />\r<br />Artifacts : http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84235?\r<br />Slow time shout : http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84607/?\r<br />Balanced sneak damage (includes db gloves) : http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84654?",
