Unfortunately, he died of old age before he was ever able to collect any of them. His son, Bori, decided to fulfill his father&#39;s[url=#25902752] dream[img]http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png[/img][/url] , and so traveled to Skyrim after preparing himself for what he anticipated would be a long and difficult journey . Hoping that he would be able to collect the artifacts his father researched, Bori wishes to open a little museum after he collects them , so he can display them in memory of his father .\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Bori can be found at &#34;Ilinalta&#39;s Deep&#34; (see the screenshot for the location). He is a powerful wizard , He is an Imperial , with some opposite gender attitude ... you&#39;ll find on him his father&#39;s notebook with the clues to the artifacts he had researched and some other stuff (see Bori&#39;s gear bellow) .\r<br />\r<br />[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />[size=3][b][color=#9fc5e8][size=3][b][color=#9fc5e8][color=#ffffff]TWO VERSIONS ARE AVAILABLE :[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffffff]Aggressive version :[/color] you&#39;ll have to fight him to get the items you need (tough fight) .\r<br />[color=#ffffff]Follower version :[/color] he is a potential follower (no fight) (a powerful follower) , you don&#39;t need any other mod to recruit \r<br />                             him . he is essential , doesn&#39;t affect stealth meter , will level with you to level 100 , good in \r<br />                             destruction alteration conjuration and restoration , will get more perks as he levels with you , can\r<br />                             be married and moves like a woman &#33; .   \r<br />\r<br />[/color][/b][/size]This mod is standalone, but does not contain the artifacts, you will need the Artifacts of Ultima mod by DMagnus to get them: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42917/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42917/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />You will also find his notes on him, which detail his journey and the items in his possession.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffffff][size=4]Bori&#39;s items and gear :[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#6d9eeb]Enchanted light armor set :[/color]\r<br />\r<br />He is wearing a set of light armored clothes with special enchantments that you can take for your character.
