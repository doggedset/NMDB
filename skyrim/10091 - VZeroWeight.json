  "descriptionHtml": "I uploaded this to steam recently but decided to upload it here aswell since I hate steam and always have lol.\r\n\r\nI know there are already a few carry weight type mods but this is one I created more for smithing for personal use.\r\n\r\nIt is slightly differant from the steam version as I included my \\\"oring.txt\\\" file when adds 1000 or each ore type plus daedric hearts and 100 dragon souls which I created pre ck so I could just drop all resources off into a chest. Feel free to use the \\\"Oring.txt or modify it for your own use or simply not use it, the choice is thine.\r\n\r\nInstalation\r\n\r\nSimple drop the aaVZeroWeight.esp into data and activate with your chosen mod file manager.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Oring.txt place that into your main skyrim folder where Skyrim.exe is located then open console with tilde and type \\\"Bat Oring\\\" (without quotes) each item will then be added into your inventory and since there is no weight there will be no issue on becoming over encumbered (unless I missed something in which case let me know and I will edit accordingly).\r\n\r\n1.2 Now has the added resources for all three DLC, simply overwrite the previous version the file still has the same name.\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nVampessa\r\n\r\n",
