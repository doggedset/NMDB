Built around[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17802/?] Climates of Tamriel [/url] w/ [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39799/?]Climates of Tamriel Weather Patch (foggy or regular) [/url] and [url=http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1930]Enhanced Lighting for ENB[/url] plus [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17609/?]Relighting Skyrim[/url]. I don&#39;t go completely crazy with lighting or bloom though, so other lighting mods should also work well, or no lighting mod, if that&#39;s how you roll.\r<br />[line]\r<br />After some experimentation, I was able to get ENB stable with ENB Boost after Boris removed the ExpandSystemMemoryX64 option. I&#39;m running with ugrids at 7, and haven&#39;t had a single infinite loading screen or crash with the current settings. I would strongly recommend that if you run a lot of texture mods, you get [url=http://enbdev.com/ctdfix.html] the Skyrim Memory Patch 3.0[/url]. If you don&#39;t want to mess with compiling your own, I found a compiled version of the patch [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/1340369-skyrim-memory-patch-fixing-ils-ugrids-ctd-freezes-for-real/]here[/url]. Just replace your skse_steam_loader.dll in your skyrim directory with the one from that link. I run a metric butt-ton of texture mods, and I&#39;m finally completely stable.\r<br />\r<br />I was also, after more palette and curve tweaking than I want to think about, able to get something like a more desaturated look in low-light areas while maintaining a nice level of color saturation for more brightly lit objects, all in the same area. So I didn&#39;t have to go the all-desaturated route to get something I liked. Please check it out and leave some feedback in the forum thread, whether good or bad. The weathers though, are still very much a work in progress, as I&#39;ve started working on implementing multiple weather support with CoT. That&#39;s over 500 unique weathers to check out and tweak.\r<br />\r<br />In short, interiors are about 10-15% darker than vanilla with heavy shadows, and exteriors range in brightness a lot, depending on the weather and time of day. Blizzards at night will be much darker than vanilla (don&#39;t expect to see where you&#39;re going, even with a torch. It&#39;s a blizzard), and bright days are about 10%  brighter than vanilla, but have a very colorful, slightly overexposed look to better simulate bright sunlight. Clear nights are about the same as vanilla.\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s also a certain strategic element introduced by this ENB. I tried to come up with adaptation settings that don&#39;t ruin the game, but at the same time, if it&#39;s a dark night and you go hurling around spells that give off a lot of light, you might find yourself having to let your &#34;eyes&#34; readjust in order to reacquire your enemies. So it&#39;s got that going for it.\r<br />\r<br />The original YAENB will be maintained here for historical purposes and for those looking for a vanilla enhancer. I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s more fun to build an ENB if the only question I ask myself is &#34;does that look cool?&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Requires ENB .251 from [url=http://enbdev.com/index_en.html]Boris&#39; site[/url] under downloads.\r<br />Also requires the [url=http://www.dev-c.com/skyrim/]ENB helper library[/url].\r<br />and\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17802]Climates of Tamriel[/url]. Use whatever bit of this you want. I install as vanilla nights and do darkening based on the weather type.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39799/?]Climates of Tamriel Weather Patch (foggy or regular)[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17609/?]Relighting Skyrim[/url]. \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1930]Enhanced Lighting for ENB[/url].

If you have a problem, post in the discussion thread and I&#39;ll take a look. The only promise I can make is that the one answer you&#39;ll never get from me as a first answer is &#34;it&#39;s not my mod&#34;. I can&#39;t promise that won&#39;t be the final answer, but I&#39;ll at least look at whatever problem you&#39;re having to see if I can help, even if it&#39;s not specifically related to this configuration.\r<br />\r<br />Installing:\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll need to download ENB .251 from http://enbdev.com. \r<br />\r<br />1)Extract d3d9.dll and enbhost.exe from the &#34;wrapper&#34; section of the enb zip file.\r<br />2)Extract enbhelper.dll from the enbhelper.zip file into your main Skyrim directory.\r<br />3) Extract yaenb jj abrams - michael bay edition 2.5.251.7z into your main Skyrim directory, not your data directory. The one you want is usually something like C:Program Files (x86)SteamSteamAppscommonSkyrim, if you&#39;ve installed in the default location using Steam (hint: If you see a  bunch of esp files in the directory you&#39;re extracting to, you&#39;re in the wrong directory).\r<br />\r<br />[b]VERY IMPORTANT&#33;[/b] Make sure you&#39;ve turned off all anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering, etc., in both your drivers and in the skyrim launcher.\r<br />\r<br />4) Launch Skyrim and glory in the magnificence as JJ Abrams and Michael Bay law down the awesome on your game.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: I changed a few of the default ENB hotkeys. The changes are documented in the ini, but I&#39;m noting them here so you don&#39;t have to go poking around in the enbseries.ini if you don&#39;t want to. If you don&#39;t like them or you&#39;re using a hotkey mod and have one of these mapped to something already, they&#39;re just java key codes. 2 seconds of googling will get you a list, then you can change them to whatever you like by editing the enbseries.ini.\r<br />\r<br />del - re-read configuration (counter to the ENB documentation, this is not shift-&lt;key&gt;, but just &lt;key&gt;. Drove me nuts when I was trying to test stuff via the console until I figured this out. That&#39;s why I changed it to the del key instead of ENB&#39;s default of backspace.)\r<br />\r<br />shift - for shifted functions in enb, like disabling all the processing.\r<br />\r<br />shift-f12 - disables all enb pre- and post-processing.\r<br />\r<br />shift-home - Enables the FPS limiter.\r<br />\r<br />shift-numlock - enables a simple frame rate counter display.\r<br />\r<br />F1 - takes a screenshot. And F1 is a lot easier for me to reach while using the keyboard than reaching across to hit the default insert.\r<br />[line]\r<br />Oh, and please, no nekkid pics if you decide to upload screenshots. This mod isn&#39;t marked NSFW, so just don&#39;t. We all love looking at the incredible level of detail present on your body replacer&#39;s bits and sundry, but just don&#39;t. \r<br />[line]\r<br />I tested this on an Intel i7 960, 12 GB DDR3, GTX Titan w/ 6GB VRAM, all running at stock speeds. Runs fine, but at a cost of up to 50% of my frame rate. If you&#39;re using an ATI card, I believe some of the features I&#39;ve enabled will not work, and may even blow something up. Not really sure, and I don&#39;t have an ATI card to test with. In any case, I rarely go under 40 FPS, and am usually well above that. If hardware anti-aliasing is enabled, some features will be disabled by that as well, since Boris uses deferred rendering for some of his more advanced effects. This is simply a limitation of how this works, and neither he nor I can do anything about it. But I included KYO&#39;s UBER SMAA preset, and this is the SMAA profile, so you really shouldn&#39;t need hardware AA turned on. Same for anisotropic filtering via your drivers. It&#39;s forced on in the config, which, to me, looks better than driver-based AF. And, of course, SSAO, which doesn&#39;t seem to be terribly well supported by drivers, so SSAO is on in the config, and pretty well maxed for settings.\r<br />[line]\r<br />YAENB is now at 4.0.233. [b]This is likely to be the last release of &#34;vanilla&#34; YAENB.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Requires ENB .233 or higher.
