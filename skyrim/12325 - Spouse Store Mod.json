  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=&#34;6&#34;][color=#EE0000][u]This mod had been discontinued until I can issue a similar replacement mod.[/u][/color][/size]\r<br />The mod has suffered from the instabilities associated with tying into the marriage mechanics. I was unable to resolve the issues. I am going to work a stand-alone vendor version with similar functions. Add a comment if you have some skills to contribute to the new version.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=&#34;5&#34;]Bulk Item Merchant[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />So you want to play skyrim and focus on the quests, killing, and just plain fun to be had in the world? Does your immersion in the game lessen after dealing with a hard day&#39;s worth of killing only to have to travel from city to city just to sell a few things? Wish there were a way to sell in bulk? Well, keep an eye out for this mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=&#34;4&#34;]Features:[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod will add selling in bulk through extra dialogue at a new vendor&#33; Talking to the vendor will allow you to:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Drop off loot to sell\r<br />[*]Look at how much that loot is worth and what it will sell for\r<br />[*]And look at other stats on pay percent and vendor barter level\r<br />[*]Pick up your paycheck.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />In order to try and keep the game more balanced, you will receive a paycheck instead of everything sold up-front. The paycheck increases with the vendor&#39;s speechcraft level. The pay ranges from around 1,000 gold/week to 52,000 gold/week (level 1 barter through level 100). There is also a random chance to get up to 15% bonus gold per day because some days the vendor has a great sales day&#33; [i]Also, please be aware that, due to current scripting limitations, enchanted items are sold at their base (unenchanted) value[/i]; I am waiting for SKSE to see if it can be fixed.\r<br />\r<br />Your things are only sold after each day is up. This allows you to take things out if you accidentally placed them in there as long as the day hasn&#39;t passed. Your pay will keep adding up each day, so you can pick it up whenever you get around to it (also, there&#39;s nothing like questing for a few days and getting 3 days pay&#33;)",
