The Atmorian\\'s are the most common of races in Atmora, they have a large weakness to magicka (due to their lack of understanding and rarity of seeing it) but have a bonus to smithing, alchemy, one handed, two handed and archery.\r\n\r\nWood Elves (Elves - Good - Medium Difficulty): Allied with the Northern Atmorian\\'s, the Elves live in the Mysterious Elderwood Forest, keeping the forest animals and creatures at bay. They have the best archers in the land, and have a 100% resistance to disease and poison. \r\n\r\nDark Elves (Elves - Evil - Medium Difficulty): Allied with the Orcs, the Dark Elves live in the Mountains and Caves all around Altmora, Skilled with One handed and Magic, these Elves can pose a threat to Atmorians. \r\n\r\nOrcs (Corrupted Evil - Evil - Hard): Allied with the Dark Elves, the Orcs live close to the Dark Elves, more in the Mountains then Caves. Skilled with Two Handed weapons and Heavy armor, but are slow and bulky. They have a large weakness to Magic.\r\n",
