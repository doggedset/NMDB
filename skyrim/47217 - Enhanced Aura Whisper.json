  "summary": "Color codes the aura whisper effect to allow you to distinguish between allies, enemies, undeads, etc. Optional corpse detection as well.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]IMPORTANT! For those updating from 1.0 to 2.0, delete the old version from Skyrim/Data manually or via NMM first. Then install 2.0. Start game. When asked about missing content, select \"Yes\"[/b]\r\n\r\nChanges aura whisper effects depending on what life forms are present. Not only can you now distinguish between enemies and allies, now you can distinguish between types of life forms as well. To name a few: generic enemies are red, allies are blue, enemy undeads are orange, allied undeads are light blue, etc. In addition, corpses can now be detected as well. though this part is entirely optional.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Other changes to Aura Whisper[/u][/b]\r\nAdditionally, the range of the aura whisper shout has been changed. Vanilla had a range of 500 in exteriors and 300 in interiors; now, the range is constant at 400 regardless of where you are. The duration is the same as vanilla (10/20/30 seconds depending on words used).\r\n\r\n[b][u]Compatibility[/u][/b]\r\nThere are specific versions of this mod compatible with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14353]Improved Dragon Shouts[/url] check under the optional section. The duration of the effect is changed to 6/9/12 seconds. Also, load this [b]after[/b] Improved Dragon Shouts. BOSS's masterlist seems to have messed up the boot order, so you may have to manually position it yourself.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Credits[/u][/b]\r\nBrehanin2 for allowing me to \"borrow\" the new life detection effects from his  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9717//?]Better Vampires[/url] mod.\r\n\r\nIf you like this mod, please give an endorsement. It may not seem like much, but it shows that people like it, and that encourages me to continue developing mods.",
