  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a Mammoth Tusk Bow to the game. You can find it behind the sawmill, next to the table in Riverwood. It does a few points more damage than a hunting bow. I attribute this to the catgut(Khajiit) bow string donated by a rogue Khajiit near the Valenwood border.\r<br />\r<br />This is basically a retexture of the hunting bow, but is a standalone mod.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod, so be gentle..lol",
