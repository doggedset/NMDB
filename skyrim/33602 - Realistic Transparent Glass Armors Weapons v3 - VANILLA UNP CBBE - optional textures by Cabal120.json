Also they add variety in a game full of conventional armors and weapons.\n<br />\n<br />--- [color=#ff7700][b]NOW WHAT EXACTLY DOES THIS MOD DO?[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />° This mod simply replaces all the meshes and textures of Glass weapons and armors (male and female) included in the game with pieces that show transparent parts.\n<br />\n<br />° It does NOT add any new craftable armor or weapon, so there is NO .esp inside. This is a simple replacer and I tried to keep the vanilla style as much as possible.\n<br />\n<br />° I added male and female bodies inside all armor parts, so you will see the body through transparent parts of armor.\n<br />\n<br />° I tweaked literally HUNDREDS of vertices to remove all clipping issues i could find.\n<br />\n<br />° Initially intended for UNP users, now this mod includes versions for VANILLA and CBBE users too.\n<br />\n<br />--- There are already other mods that use transparency, how does this mod differ from them?\n<br />\n<br />Whether to apply a transparency effect to a mesh, in certain circumstances this mesh will appear completely transparent (for instance when you go inside water, like a river or a lake). \n<br />Well i just applied a trick to resolve this problem so the meshes included in this mod will NOT look completely invisible anymore (more info under 'DETAILED DESCRIPTION').\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />================= [color=#ff0000]INSTALLATION[/color] ==================\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />There are 4 Main files:\n<br />\n<br />1- If you want to install only weapons.\n<br />\n<br />2- The Main file for Vanilla users.\n<br />\n<br />3- The Main file for UNP users - obviously you NEED 'DIMONIZED UNP female body' by dimon99 with this one:  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709.\n<br />\n<br />4- The Main file for CBBE users - obviously you NEED 'Calientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE-' with this one:  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />================= [color=#ff0000]OPTIONAL FILES[/color] =================\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />---- Cabal120 was so gentle to grant me permission to use his awesome textures of glass armor from his popular mod 'aMidianBorn'.\n<br />Original mods: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36356 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24909\n<br />To make Cabal120 textures compatible with my mod i made 2 little modifications:\n<br />First: I added the alfa channel to make the transparency active.\n<br />Second: I tweaked the brightness and saturation of transparent parts to make transparency looks denser and colorfull.\n<br />(Weapons are not included because Cabal120 has not released them yet).\n<br />I uploaded 3 optional file with the 3 different styles that Cabal released (Golden, Morrowind and Thalmorized).\n<br />First install a Main file then choose your style, install the optional file and overwrite.\n<br />\n<br />- There are 3 Patches (Vanila, CBBE or UNP) for both aMidianBorn -Glass_Variants- and -Glass_Variants_LORE- by Cabal120 and Modd3r.\n<br />With the original mods you are able to use all the 3 glass styles at the same time so you dont have to choose only 1 of them. This patch just adds thansparency to all armors of the 3 styles.\n<br />This is a Patch so you NEED one the original mods by Cabal120 and Modd3r:\n<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36356 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24909\n<br />FIRST: install original mod. SECOND: install a Main file of this mod (Vanila, CBBE or UNP). THIRD: install the relative patch (Vanila, CBBE or UNP).\n<br />Always overwrite when asked. Remember to activate the ESP file of the original mod.\n<br />Done.\n<br />Let me thank also Modd3r for his contrbution to the original standalone plungin - aMidianBorn Glass_Variants- and -aMidianBorn Glass_Variants_LORE-\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />---- I added optional textures with different colors of hair you can see through the transparent helm.\n<br />The color included in the Main file is brown.\n<br />You can choose other optional colors: blonde, black and Grey-white.\n<br />There is an optional file if you want to see a bald head too.\n<br />First install Main file then choose your color, install the optional file and say 'yes' to overwrite.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />---- Main file for UNP users includes the standard UNP Underwear.\n<br />However under 'optional files' there are 3 alternative meshes for UNP female body that you can see through the transparent glass chest:\n<br />1 - an optional file with bandeau-bra for UNP female body. (screenshot n23).\n<br />2 - an optional file with skimpy UNP female body, i removed the bra but i left panties.\n<br />3 - an optional file with Naked UNP female body, bra and panties removed.\n<br />it's revealing through the transparent chest but not so much.\n<br />First install Main file for UNP users then install the optional file that you like and say 'yes' to overwrite.\n<br />(There are also optional addons for peoples who installed a Patch for aMidianBorn -Glass_Variants- and - Glass_Variants_LORE-)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />---- Main file for CBBE users includes the standard CBBE Underwear that uses vanilla texures.\n<br />Under 'optional files' there are 2 alternative meshes for female CBBE body that you can see through the transparent glass chest:\n<br />1 - an optional file with NUDE CBBE female body, bra and panties removed.\n<br />2 - an optional file with SKIMPY CBBE female body, i removed bra but i left panties.\n<br />It's revealing through the transparent chest but not so much.\n<br />First install Main file for CBBE users then install the optional file that you like and say 'yes' to overwrite.\n<br />(There are also optional addons for peoples who installed a Patch for aMidianBorn -Glass_Variants- and - Glass_Variants_LORE-)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />---- There are 2 small optional files if you want reduced transparency for shield and female chest (screenshot n38).\n<br />- Another optional texture if you want a skimpy female chest with legs exposed (screenshot n41).\n<br />You should NOT use this textures together with amidianborn textures by Cabal120.\n<br />---- There are also 4 optoinal files for amidianborn textures by cabal120 that include skimpy textures of the female glass chest with legs exposed for all 3 styles, also this chests will appear a bit more transparent in certain zones (boobs and back) (screenshot 58).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />================ [color=#ff0000]DETAILED DESCRIPTION[/color] =================\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />If you are curious of what exactly i did and how i developped this mod, you can read below here and the following CHANGE LOG:\n<br />\n<br />- I added all the right body parts inside Gauntlets and Boots, precisely:\n<br />UNP female forearms and hands inside Gauntlets_0 and Gauntlets_1\n<br />Standard male forearms and hands inside Gauntlets_0 and Gauntlets_1\n<br />UNP female calves and feet inside Boots_0 and Boots_1\n<br />Standard male calves and feet inside Boots_0 and Boots_1\n<br />You will not see missing body parts also when wearing pieces of other armor sets.\n<br />I made the new parts (calf and forearm) with Blender cutting them from the original UNP female and standard male meshes of the body.\n<br />\n<br />- I tweaked literally HUNDREDS of vertices manually with Nifskope to remove all clipping issues i could find.\n<br />I think i corrected at least 95% of the clipping with this method anyway it was really a pain because i had to check tousands of vertices... I think i spent 2/3 of the time only doing this.\n<br />\n<br />- About glass helms:\n<br />I added a short-hair model inside the glass helm so you will not see a complete bald head through the trasparent helm, the color of this model of hair is brown and it is not possible to change it in game.\n<br />I added other colors as optional files so you can choose your favorite.\n<br />Argonians and Khajiit use different helms and there is NO hair inside (helmetarg_0 helmetarg_1, helmetkha_0 helmetKha_1).\n<br />Also Orcs have their own models of helm (helmetorc_0 and helmetorc_1), however it seems that Orcs in game wear the same models as other human races (bug?).\n<br />Then meshes helmetorc_0 and helmetorc_1 seem to be useless anyway i still included them in this mod.\n<br />I adapted glass helms to fit orcs removing clippining and yes they will show hair inside helm.\n<br />I tweaked some vertices of the glass helm to correct the clipping of the races with long ears (elves and orcs) so you will not see anymore ears outside the glass helm (I suppose it was an issue already inside the game).\n<br />\n<br />- I added real arrows inside the quiver so you will see them through the transparent parts of the quiver.\n<br />There are seven arrows in the quiver and the number decreases gradually when you have less than 7 arrows:\n<br />when you wear 50 arrows you will see 7 arrows,\n<br />when you wear 10 arrows you will see 7 arrows,\n<br />when you wear 7 arrows you will see 7 arrows,\n<br />when you wear 6 arrows you will see 6 arrows,\n<br />when you wear 5 arrows you will see 5 arrows...\n<br />...when you wear 1 arrow you will see 1 arrow...\n<br />...when you have no arrow... buy some :D\n<br />\n<br />- I modded glossiness of armor and weapons to fit my tastes/judgment.\n<br />\n<br />- I did also many other minor tweaks.\n<br />\n<br />- There are already other mods that use transparency, how does this mod differ from them?\n<br />Well now i will describe what i consider the main feature of my mod:\n<br />if you want to add transparency to a mesh using Nifskope, you have to add the NiAlphaProperty and change the values: Flags 4845 and Threshold 0.\n<br />In this way that model gains a 'soft' transparency.\n<br />However there is an issue when two models with this settings overlap themselves or when for instance you go inside water (a river or a lake): the pieces of armor or weapon affected with this trasparency will simply look TOTALLY INVISIBLE! (to understand what i mean watch screenshot n.19)\n<br />This bugged me a lot because indeed it looked unrealistic swimming with a completely invisible armor :(\n<br />Well i used my brain and i came up with an idea.\n<br />I applied a trick to the meshes to make transparent models still visible in water too (at least partially visible)\n<br />Do you want to know the trick? ... ok I'll tell you :)\n<br />In Nifskope i doubled the Nitrishape with the NiAlphaProperty so basicaly i created 2 identical Nitrishape that overlap themselves.\n<br />Now the first Nitrishape uses values: Flags 4845 and Threshold 0.\n<br />and the second Nitrishape uses values: Flags 4844 and Threshold 254 (or also 230-240)\n<br />In this way outside water you will see the soft trasparency, when you go inside water the first Nitrishape will disappear but you still will see the second one, so that model now will NOT look completely invisible anymore! :D (screenshots 06 18 20).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />================= [color=#ff0000]CHANGE LOG[/color] =================\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--- V1.0 - 19 Mar 2013 ---\n<br />\n<br />- Initial release.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--- V1.1 - 26 Mar 2013 ---\n<br />\n<br />- I fixed some issues about arrows and quiver:\n<br />You will not see anymore arrows appearing and disappearing inside the quiver.\n<br />Now arrows are visible through water.\n<br />Also arrows INSIDE the quiver are visible through water.\n<br />I added longer arrows to fix a bug of the original game (see screenshots number 20 and 22).\n<br />I tweaked the position and dimension of the quiver to fit new longer arrows .\n<br />\n<br />- About Glass Helms:\n<br />Corrected some vertices of Glass Helms (male and female).\n<br />Now Glass helms should be compatible with the popular mod 'Ethereal Elven Overhaul' by nuska\n<br />( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24273 )\n<br />It seems that ears of elves in this mod are longer than vanillas so i tweaked Glass helms to remove clipping.\n<br />\n<br />- First person:\n<br />Corrected Meshes in first person (gauntlets and cuirass for male and female)\n<br />Now you will not see anymore transparency in parts of the armor that should not be transparent.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--- V1.2 - 28 Mar 2013 ---\n<br />\n<br />- I worked with the textures of the cuirass (male and female):\n<br />Colors are now more uniform and male shoulders look less transparent (see screenshoot number 21)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--- V1.2a - 1 May 2013 ---\n<br />\n<br />- Just added an optional file with female UNP body a bit more skimpy, i removed the bra but i left panties.\n<br />it's revealing through the transparent chest but not so much. Made by request.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--- V1.2b - 4 May 2013 ---\n<br />\n<br />- Just added an optional file with bandeau bra for female UNP body. Made by request. Watch screenshot n23.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--- V1.2c - 6 May 2013 ---\n<br />\n<br />- Just added an optional file with Naked skimpy female UNP body, bra and panties removed.\n<br />it's revealing through the transparent chest but not so much. Made by request.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--- V1.3 - 9 May 2013 ---\n<br />\n<br />- Added a new Main file with VANILLA female body, so you dont need anymore to be an UNP user to install this mod (screenshot n.24).\n<br />\n<br />- Reworked the female glass chest of UNP versions: size reduced a bit, tweaked several vertices to reduce clipping (screenshot n.25).\n<br />- Updated all UNP optional files with the new chest.\n<br />- Optional Bandeau bra now have less shining textures.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--- V1.3a - 10 May 2013 ---\n<br />\n<br />- Just uploaded a corrected optional file with bandeau bra for female UNP body.

Really pervert guys should use this combined with UNP or CBBE naked female body. :D\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--- V3.0 - 3 Aug 2013 ---\n<br />\n<br />- Cabal120 was so gentle to grant me permission to use his awesome textures of glass armor from his popular mod 'aMidianBorn'.\n<br />Original mods: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36356 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24909\n<br />To make this textures compatible with my mod i made 2 little modifications:\n<br />First: I added the alfa channel to make the transparency active.\n<br />Second: I tweaked the brightness and saturation of transparent parts to make transparency looks denser and colorfull.\n<br />(Weapons are not included because Cabal120 has not released them yet). \n<br />I uploaded 3 optional file with the 3 different styles that Cabal released (Golden, Morrowind and Thalmorized).\n<br />First install a Main file then choose your style, install the optional file and overwrite.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--- V3.1 - 12 Aug 2013 ---\n<br />\n<br />- I added 3 Patches (Vanila, CBBE or UNP) for both aMidianBorn -Glass_Variants- and -Glass_Variants_LORE- by Cabal120 and Modd3r.\n<br />With the original mods you are able to use all the 3 glass styles at the same time so you dont have to choose only 1 of them.
