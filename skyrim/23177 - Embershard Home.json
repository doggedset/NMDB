  "modName": "Embershard Home",
  "summary": "A home just outside of the Embershard Mine in Falkreath Hold that tells the story of the people that owned it and what happened when the Bandits took control of it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is, by my estimation, a rather small housing mod. It\\'s not quite a player home yet because there are some things that I still have to learn. There is a fairly basic quest (no quest markers yet) but the quest is there... it\\'s all explained through two journals (one in the mine and the other in the home). This is very lore friendly. I\\'ve taken great pains to make sure that it is placed well within the context of the world.\r\n\r\nI plan on expanding this to include:\r\n  - quest markers that link to the player journal.\r\n  - the ability to take full control of Embershard Home so that it is fully becomes a player home.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nDarkRider from TESAlliance for his amazing Modding Lessons found there. Check it out at: -http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/topic/4655-introduction-creation-kit-basics\r\n\r\nWillieSea from TESAlliance for helping me with a small script.",
