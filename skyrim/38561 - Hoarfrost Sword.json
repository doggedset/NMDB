  "descriptionHtml": "*Requires Dragonborn*\r\n\r\nHoarfrost sword, made with stalhrim that was mined from the coldest and rarest of sources, enchanted by the ancient Nords, this formidable weapon is truly one of a kind. It has been known to freeze enemies into solid ice blocks, it reduces movement speed as though the very blood of your enemy had frozen and deals frost and stamina damage like no other weapon. It\\'s white colouring sets it apart from all other blades and icy steam trails from it when it is drawn. A true relic of old with no more icy stalhrim no grindstone can improve it.\r\n\r\nHoarfrost sword is a stalhrim sword with a difference! It is enchanted with a modified hoarfrost pickaxe enchantment (higher probability to freeze solid) Frost damage and reduced movement speed for 15 seconds, the Frozen effect lasts for 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nI thought Hoarfrost was lame as it had a really low chance to Freeze solid and it\\'s a pickaxe! This is not currently a replacer but I will consider doing it in an update.\r\nHoarfrost sword has the same frosty FX as Chillrend and is fitting for any cryomancer or warrior of the North.\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any problems\r\n\r\nIf you like this and want something a little more powerful check out my other mod, ice blade http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38486//? a disenchantable version that has 100% chance freeze solid.",
