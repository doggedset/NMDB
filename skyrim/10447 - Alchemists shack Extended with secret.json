Near the shack is a secret door that also leads to a bonus cave house with a very good merchant! I will upload images soon.\r\n\r\nFeatures in version 1 are-\r\n\r\n-Smithy in the back\r\n-Weapon racks (Not working for some reason at the moment)\r\n-front garden with ingredients\r\n-Secret bonus house with secret bonus weapon and secret bonus merchant :D\r\n\r\nBugs- \r\n-To get out of the secret area, you must use the console command TCL and fly behind the door and then activate it. I will fix this soon.\r\n-The secret weapon can only be held in the right hand or it will glitch.\r\n",
