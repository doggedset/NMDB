  "descriptionHtml": "Introduction:\r\nAdds certain buffs for characters who only wish to use one hand and removes the first person idle fist.\r\n\r\nFinally true one handed characters should make a comeback! Remember the days in RPGs where using a single weapon was standard and dual weapons was the exception? Now it seems with every new rpg the thieves have to be as much like Drizzt as possible, well hopefully with this mod you\\'ll be able to play a single handed thief, mage, or soldier, losing your offhand and gaining a buff in return!\r\n\r\nWhen you\\'re only using one hand equip (sword, mace, spell, shield, etc) and have a free hand (or torch) you get the following buffs:\r\nMelee +10% Damage\r\nWeapon Speed + 15%\r\nPickpocket + 10%\r\nMovement Speed + 15%\r\n+5% Crit Chance\r\nIncreased Magic Power\r\n(can\\'t give a real number on the magic since it effects each school of magic differently)\r\n\r\nAdded perk to One Handed tree:\r\nSwift Strikes (Requires armsman and 30 one handed)\r\nAdditional +10% attack speed and +5% crit chance while using only one hand.\r\n\r\nWith the perk you have +25% attack speed and +10% crit in total\r\n\r\nIf this is too powerful or not powerful enough to make a single handed character viable, please let me know!\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus when you have nothing in your hands you will no longer see a fist, you can still punch and see your fist swing then, but otherwise the fists are gone, this is to let you really play one handed without feeling like you need to punch everything. See the video for more information on how the fist works.\r\n\r\nv1\r\nReleased\r\n\r\nv2\r\nRewrote the entire mod to use a script rather than magic spells, should work for all characters now\r\nChanged the buff effects (see below)\r\nIncluded Torch to count as \\'no offhand\\'\r\n\r\nv2.1\r\nReduced damage and pickpocket to +10% (down from 20)\r\nFixed a mistake with speed mult being 20% instead of 15%\r\n\r\nv2.2\r\nAdded 2 alternate versions: \r\n\r\nNoSpeedNoPickpocket\r\nThis version has the following effects\r\nMelee +20% Damage\r\nWeapon Speed + 20%\r\n+5% Crit Chance\r\nIncreased Magic Power\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nWeaponSpeedWeaponDamage\r\nThis version has the following effects\r\nMelee +10% Damage\r\nWeapon Speed + 10%\r\n\r\nv2.3\r\nAdded perk to One Handed tree:\r\nSwift Strikes (Requires armsman and 30 one handed)\r\nAdditional +10% attack speed and +5% crit chance while using only one hand.\r\n\r\nAdded optional version: NoPerk\r\n\r\n3/6/12: Added a test version, recoded mod, now has the following one handed buffs:\r\n+17% attack speed\r\n+17% move speed\r\n+5 pickpocket chance\r\n10% less self stagger\r\n+10% physical damage\r\n+5% crit chance",
