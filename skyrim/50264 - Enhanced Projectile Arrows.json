  "modName": "Enhanced Projectile Arrows",
  "summary": "This mod enhances arrows with new types and kinds. This mod is meant to change the graphical look of an arrow when it&#39;s shot. Of course, all arrows stay the same, I just added in new arrows. These arrows vary with their damage on their range. Long range isn&#39;t much damage, short range is alot.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Enhanced Projectile Arrows\r<br />------\r<br />This mod is designed to change the look and enhance archery by firing different kinds of arrows. There are currently thirteen arrows, more coming.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE: Hooray, Xanins made me some bows and arrows. Now we&#39;ve got custom textures going.\r<br />------\r<br />Arrows:\r<br />----\r<br />Flame Burst\r<br />Frost Spike\r<br />Slime\r<br />Illumination\r<br />Wabbajack&#33;\r<br />Shock Bolt\r<br />Spit\r<br />Transforming Arrow\r<br />Beamfire Arrow\r<br />Light Strike Arrow\r<br />Storm Fire Arrow\r<br />Rock Arrow: (More like Flame Bomb)\r<br />Bloodskal Arrow (DRAGONBORN ONLY)\r<br />Blue Hellfire Arrow\r<br />Shock Chain Arrow\r<br />Flame Spear Arrow\r<br />Force Ball Arrow\r<br />Paralyzation Arrow\r<br />\r<br />Sadly, the 4-5 new arrows I created that have awesome effects were created on my DLC .esp, not my original, so I cannot copy them over.  I will attempt to re-create on the regular .esp, but, it will take some time.  However, to those who have the Dragonborn DLC, you&#39;re good to go.\r<br />\r<br />Bow(s):\r<br />----\r<br />Wabbajack Bow: Turns your enemy into a bunny, or perhaps a spriggan? \r<br />Push Bow: Knocks enemies about&#33;\r<br />Incineration Bow: Set your enemies on fire, perhaps while blasting them with some ice arrows?\r<br />\r<br />NOTES FOR THE BOWS: These bows are designed to work together with arrows specifically for COSMETIC purposes, the REAL effects are applied on Vanilla arrows. I did it this way to prevent the arrows from becoming too powerful in the game, since most do 40 dmg. The bow description &#34;Use with Enhanced arrows for maximum effect&#34; means the bow&#39;s projectile launch, speed, and range. These are all heightened. It&#39;s speed is faster by 1.25x. It&#39;s launch is set to 2 projectiles. Range is set to that of 100 more than the average arrow, so the magical projectiles can travel further without bugging out. Please realize the true effects of the bows are meant for Vanilla arrows such as Iron, Steel, etc etc. It&#39;s basically enchantment bows that apply for certain items.\r<br />-----\r<br />3-4 more bows planned.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: I am taking requests&#33; If you would like to see something special come by, ask for it&#33; I will try to fulfill your request&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Style\r<br />----\r<br />Their damage will be edited into levels assuming what difficulty you play by.\r<br />Currently, this mod&#39;s damage is meant for Hard, Very Hard, or Legendary.\r<br />HOWEVER: If you like a good ol&#39; damage boost at a low difficulty, then go ahead and download this current version. If you don&#39;t just wait one day and it&#39;ll be up.\r<br />In a day or two I&#39;ll have Adept, Apprentice, and Novice ready to go.\r<br />\r<br />Plans for future:\r<br />----\r<br />I plan on making Dragonborn content and Dawnguard arrows.\r<br />I plan on having custom bows.\r<br />I plan on making another 10+ arrows in a few days.\r<br />Going to make new difficulty based arrows.\r<br />Going to make a vendor that sells improved arrows.\r<br />\r<br />Where to find the items?\r<br />----\r<br />The Skyforge. Once you&#39;re up on top of the steps, look to the wall facing left. There should be a small chest on the floor.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Hope you enjoy&#33; ",
