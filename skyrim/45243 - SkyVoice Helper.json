  "descriptionHtml": "This file will display a small icon on your screen to indicate Windows Speech Recognition\\'s current status.\r\n\r\nI love controlling Skyrim with my voice, and I\\'ve been doing so ever since Thu\\'uMic first appeared. That project is dead, but its successor, SkyVoice, is very much alive. Trouble is, SkyVoice uses Windows Speech Recognition to give feedback and Windows Speech Recognition, with all its glowing blue and chrome, is a horrible fit for the Skyrim interface. So I created this, a small overlay to show whether Windows is listening.\r\n\r\nYou could probably use this without SkyVoice, but that would be silly.\r\n\r\nSkyVoice: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28448/",
