Today we&#39;re going to be present my first custom follower, Bob Ross. Bob is fully voiced with soundclips from episodes of [i]The Joy of Painting[/i], and the number of custom comments will grow in each version. First off, though, I&#39;d like to introduce one of my little friends, Bob&#39;s custom summon, a lore-friendly creature not seen since [i]Oblivion[/i]:\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/60884-2-1418947027.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s a spell tome somewhere that will teach this spell to you, but it&#39;s location is just going to be our little secret.\r<br />\r<br />Bob has stats equivalent to [/url][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Dragonborn:Teldryn_Sero]Teldryn Sero[/url], except Bob focuses on ice magic rather than fire. Bob resides in the [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Eldergleam_Sanctuary]Eldergleam Sanctuary[/url], and this mod should be compatible with just about anything else you&#39;d like to use.\r<br />\r<br />Now, some folks like to use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12933]Extensible Follower Framework[/url], but in order to get Bob to work with it, you&#39;ll have to use the EFF Mind Control spell. To get this, just press the ~ key to bring up your little console, and type [font=Courier New][color=#00ff00]player.addspell [/color][color=#ff0000]xx[/color][/font][font=Courier New]01C81A[/font], where [font=Courier New][color=#ff0000]xx[/color][/font] is the load order of XFLMain.esm. Just use that spell on Bob, or any NPC you like, and you&#39;ll have them in the EFF Framework, just like that.\r<br />\r<br />Well, that&#39;s all the time we have today, and I&#39;d like to wish you happy modding, and God bless.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Trebuchet MS][color=#00ffff][size=4]~Author&#39;s Note & Permissions~\r<br />[/size][/color][/font][font=Times New Roman]   Dropping the Bob Ross-style of writing, a funny thing happened as I was working on this mod. The inspiration for this mod was seeing the Hepsy Hair Afro in the hot files. I immediately thought of Bob Ross. I had originally envisioned splicing together sound clips to portray him as a blood-gargling psychopath, because I thought that would be funny. However, as I was collecting voice clips from YouTube videos and MP3s, I had a change of heart. Bob Ross was a gentle soul who just wanted to tell everyone that not only is painting totally awesome, he wanted to tell everyone that [i]they could do it to[/i]. To portray him as a murderous monster would&#39;ve been disrespectful and in very poor taste. I deleted all the crazy Bob soundclips I had spliced together and started again. I&#39;ve tried to portray Bob as he was, to the best of my ability, to &#34;have fun with&#34; rather than to &#34;make fun of.&#34; This mod is a [b][i]tribute[/i][/b], not a parody. To anyone who would say that I should have gone with my original Psycho Bob idea, let me simply answer &#34;no&#34;, because a [i]proper[/i] response to that would violate the Nexus Terms of Service.\r<br />   Therefore, I give permission to use the assets [i]I[/i]Â created, namely the voice clips (for instance, to make a Fallout: New Vegas or Oblivion version of Bob), [u]only[/u] if whatever you use them for shows the same respect for Bob&#39;s memory as I have tried to show here.\r<br />[/font][right][font=Times New Roman]--EggOver1979[/font][/right]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod uses [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59661]Hepsy Hair[/url] in compliance with the permissions there.\r<br />\r<br />This mod uses a mesh from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12092]Cloaks of Skyrim[/url] in compliance with the permissions there.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#ff7700][size=5]Bob made it into a Brodual video \r<br />(in the credits, dancing, but still&#33;)\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[youtube]WHeG0wCkxE8[/youtube][/center]",
