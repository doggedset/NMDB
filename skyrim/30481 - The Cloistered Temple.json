  "descriptionHtml": "Updates:\r\n1/31: Fixed a navmesh issue & changed some actors and doors, so they will no longer reset/respawn.\r\n\r\n1/29: Small changes to avoid unnecessary confusion & the potions are now reproduceable inside the dungeon and their duration has been changed as well.\r\n\r\nI will be updating this mod as frequently as issues arise, so for those who do not wish to manually update as frequently as I do, there is a steam workshop version available.\r\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\r\n\r\nAside from the few screen shots I will not spoil much else.  The Dungeon spans 4 zones with 3 bosses.  They are fairly challenging, but nothing a level 40-50+ character can\\'t handle.\r\n\r\nThe Dungeon will reward you with some unique pieces of equipment, potions, and wealth ( Nothing too over the top, but nothing completely underwhelming either).\r\n\r\nThis may be my first and only dungeon mod unless people let me know they like it.\r\n\r\nThe dungeon will be visible on the map when you first get in game, but you will still have to discover it.  Your followers should be able to move fine throughout the dungeon; but if you have trouble getting them to enter the dungeon, try fast traveling to the location first then entering normally- shouldn\\'t have any trouble otherwise.\r\n\r\n",
