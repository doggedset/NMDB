  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][font=Times New Roman][size=6]Old Cabin[/size]\r<br />[size=3]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/size]\r<br />[/font][font=Tahoma]In the hills of eastern Solstheim lies an old abandoned shack. Who did it once belong to? Nobody knows, but nobody cares\r<br />enough to live there. Only the occasional weary traveler will stop in and relight the fires. Those who enter might be surprised to find \r<br />stores of sickly sweet candy and stale moon sugar lying about, not to mention what seems to be some sort of ceremonious tree \r<br />with boxes of woodentoys beneath it.Â \r<br />\r<br />Whatever the case may be, perhaps you might like to take over this shack? Tidy up the ash piles and the massive cobwebs, \r<br />and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a cozy place to take respite from the hostile fauna and landscapes of Solstheim.\r<br />\r<br />[/font]Author&#39;s Note: You can find the Cabin in roughly the same place you would have found it in Bloodmoon.\r<br />[/b][/center]",
