  "summary": "Adds a discreet mage laboratory, north of Riverwood. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "I took the advice of Enthir at the College of Winterhold and made a discreet off-site laboratory, north of Riverwood.  The place contains a couple of beds, non-respawning containers, cooking area, enchanting & alchemy workstations, an indoor mage garden, and a couple of special robes (found in a dresser in the main quarters).\r\n\r\nJust as a warning, the special robes are lower level robes that have the enchantments of some higher level robes.  If you don\\'t like the idea of having them in the game, you sell them or ignore them until you feel you\\'re ready to use them.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your stay, and try not to blow yourself up.  It took eight hours to scrape the remains of the last resident off the ceiling.\r\n\r\nInstalling:\r\n-Place the esp file into the following folder: Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data\r\n\r\nInstalling a Variant:\r\n-Rename the variant to what you already have in the Data folder.\r\n-Place the esp file into the following folder: Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data\r\n\r\nUnistalling:\r\n-Delete the esp file from the Data folder.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.04:\r\n-Cleaned up the navmesh.\r\n-Added a merchant.  However, there is a know bug.  If you enter the area, quickload to another area, and enter the area again; the merchant will disappear.\r\n-Added a variant without the merchant, as well as lock the dresser to the main quarters (the key that unlocks it is the same one that unlocks the safe).\r\n\r\n1.03 Notes:\r\n-Added wall mountings and books to several of the rooms.\r\n-Fixed the lighting to the indoor garden.\r\n-Changed some of the lighting props.\r\n-This was based off of the most recent stock version, which means mannequins don\\'t exist in this version.  You\\'ll need to remove whatever you have on them before installing this version.\r\n-Because this was based off of the stock version, I was not able to get the inhabited version to work without forcing the player to repeat that part again.\r\n\r\nOlder Variants:\r\n\r\nWhitefalls Burrow:\r\nIn this version, the burrow is yours upon entry.\r\n\r\nWhitefalls Burrow - Fancy:\r\nBased on the older version, this adds a weapons rack and two mannequins in the storage room.\r\n\r\nWhitefalls Burrow - Inhabited:\r\nIn this version, the burrow is infested by elder vampires and their atronachs. Once defeated, the enemies shouldn\\'t respwan anymore and the place is yours.\r\n",
