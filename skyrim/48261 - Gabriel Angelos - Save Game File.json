  "descriptionHtml": "[heading]Gabriel Angelos[/heading]\r\n\r\nThe current Chapter Master of the Blood Ravens Space Marine Chapter and former Captain of that Chapter's 3rd Company. Angelos was responsible for slaying the Chapter's former Chapter Master and Chief Librarian, Azariah Kyras, who had become a pawn of Chaos.\r\n\r\nHe now wields the Master Crafted Daemonhammer God-Splitter, slaying Mankind's enemies with this mighty Force Weapon.\r\n\r\nGabriel Angelos is a typical Astartes: proud, valiant, faithful, protective of his Battle-Brothers and trusted allies and the bane of any who dares stand against him or the Blood Ravens.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n\r\nCharacter modeled after the famed Chapter master as close as I could get him, hair and certain scars (and nodes) being the only exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Knowledge is power. Guard it well.\" - Blood Ravens warcry",
