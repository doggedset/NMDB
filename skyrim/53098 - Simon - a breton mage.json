  "descriptionHtml": "Hello,\r<br />this is my newest savegame where the mainstory and the college of winterhold quests are done. This savegame is completely done without cheats or mods. That means the only requirement is Skyrim.\r<br />I made this savegame for myself, because its annoying when a savegame is corrupt and you have to start from the bottom. This character is not very overpowered and only Lv 13. He is a mage with the archmage&#39;s robe and Morokai. No other quests are done expect the one where you bring the golden claw back to his owner; this means also that i finished no other dungeon/cave/fortress/whatsoever.\r<br />You can do with this savefile everything you want, if you link my name in it.\r<br />Greeting, Simon\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Sorry for my bad english, it is my third language, but i tried my best :)",
