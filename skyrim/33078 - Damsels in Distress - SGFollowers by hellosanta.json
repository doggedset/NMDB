  "descriptionHtml": "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFirst: Big and special thanks to hellosanta!!! amazing followers are my favorite ones!\r\n\r\nSecond: excuse my english\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhat this mod do?\r\n\r\nThis mod relocates the followers made by hellosanta to places where you will find bandits and vampires, gigants, some traps and Draughrs, so they are a plus now when you explore and accept quests, they are located near Whiterun, and Solitude, once you enter a bandit camp or a cave you will find a cage where they are, not all of them, one in each dungeon.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHow to free them?\r\n\r\nWell, is simple, defeat the bosses in each place and pick the lock of the cage, once you pick the lock mantain opened the door, sometimes the idle will still be in them, only await to it end, how you know it has ended? well, they stand up, once rescued they will find a way home (sometimes because a buggy creation kit and Skyrim they will stay there or in the exit of the dungeon, if this happens just dismiss your actual follower and escort her outside and dismiss her, now she will walk where she must); they will return to the The Drunken Hunt´s Man and The Winking Skeever.\r\nThis is not a quest, I want to make it as one but I lack of knowledge to do so, but i like this way.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhere they are?\r\n\r\nI´m adding a file with the locations of each one, you can consult it or simply walktrought and find them, I made this because I´m playing a new character from the beggining.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhy i did this?\r\n\r\nI like the new followers that everyone release, they are marriageble, but I would like a reason for they to follow you and want you as spouse/husband, so this is the reason, you rescued them from their evil fate, so you are they hero/heroine.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHow to install the main followers?\r\n-If you have them recruited dismiss them and await 24hr ingame time\r\n-Get out of any inn like Sleeping Gigant or Bannered Mare\r\n-Download the mod of hellosanta SGFollowers http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24061\r\n-Download my pluggins\r\n-Install the followers of hellosanta and all the addons from her followers\r\n-Copy my pluggins to the /Skyrim/Data folder and overwrite when asked\r\n-Enjoy\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBUGS!\r\n\r\nWell, thnx to Restutitor Orbis for the feed back in the previous release of Unique Female Followers, he say this:\r\n\r\n-I use AFT (=Amazing Follower Tweaks) instead of UFO, and it seems to work but only let\\'s you recruit 1 of these as active at one time. If you find one when adventuring with a previous one, the old one walks away when you recruit the new one. If told to wait at home, they are okay, but you can only have 1 at a time active. Lydia is not affected by any of this.\r\n\r\n-I found this too\r\n\r\nI see that maybe AFT is adding packages and it collides with my packages\r\n\r\n1. rescue and recruit one\r\n2. rescue and recruit the second\r\n3. i can have them both in my team with no problem \r\n4. i dismiss them, in any order\r\n5. they stay where we are and they doesn´t return to the nearest bar to them\r\n\r\n-If they don´t walk away from the cage, dismiss your actual follower, recruit the recently rescued one, escort her outside the dungeon, and dismiss her, sooner or later she will walk away to the inn\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSolutions\r\n\r\n-It dont haves trouble if you recruit the first one and leave all the others return to their home and then recruit them at the bar, or if you want to recruit another one diferent from the actuall one in your team, dismiss the actual one and then recruit the new. sorry about that.\r\n\r\n-If they don´t walk away from the cage, dismiss your actual follower, recruit the recently rescued one, escort her outside the dungeon, and dismiss her, sooner or later she will walk away to the inn\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod released, so It will be bugged in some point but i will fix it if you let me know, i have tested by one real day of play and dind´t found troubles, thnx in advance, hope it likes you.",
