  "descriptionHtml": "Off the pathway towards the Riverwood entrance is a campsite which is home to seven followers who have sworn to keep the Dragonborn protected. \r<br />\r<br />The followers are :\r<br />-Uleric\r<br />-Akar\r<br />-Eldrid\r<br />-Kjoric\r<br />-Alric\r<br />-Torbis\r<br />-Jykik\r<br />\r<br />They all are leveled followers and can take down a giant in seconds as a team  with their dual wielding skills. The campsite can be used as a player home but it does have limited storage, if you want more just take over the mine right behind the tent and use that as a place for storage.\r<br />\r<br />Follow me on Twitter @AidenGatani",
