  "summary": "You can improve and create some items you couldn\\'t. Plus playable Giant Clubs!",
  "descriptionHtml": "Its a minor mod that allows player to improve some items and create some of them too. It was annoying that I couldn\\'t improve my Clavicus Vile Mask for example.So I made some changes...\r\nHere is the list of what this mod does:\r\n\r\n- Fixing non improvable Nightingale Blade of 25p absorb life. Now it can improved like the Bow.\r\n- Keening improvable.\r\n- Wuuthrad improvable.\r\n- Ebony Blade improvable.\r\n- Dragon Priest Dagger improvable.\r\n- Drainblood Battleaxe,Drainheart Sword and Drainspell Bow improvable.\r\n- Honed Falmer Waraxe - Sword and Suple Falmer bow improvable.\r\n- Silver Sword and Greatsword improvable and craftable under misc category at forge.\r\n- Scimitar improvable and craftable under steel category (needs steel perk to craft and double\r\n  improve). Also its value increased to 50.\r\n- Pickaxe,Woodcutter Axe and Shiv improvable and craftable under iron category.\r\n- Shield of Ysgramor improvable.\r\n- Clavicus Vile Mask improvable.\r\n\r\n- There is a Plus file that makes all the other things AND also makes the Giant Clubs playable,improvable and craftable under Dragonplate category.That means you need the Dragon armor perk to create it or double impove it. I made it that way because I think that is too powerfull to have it at starting levels... or at least until you are cappable to kill a Giant...I made it a second file in case of someone thinks thats too overpower anyway....Its value is now 1000 gold.\r\n\r\nHow to install : Simply unrar the .esp file into your game Data directory and activate it in skyrimlauncher.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease,note that these are items that I have found playing the game and I haven\\'t even start \r\nCivil War, Dark Brothrhood and Main quest series. So, I bet there are more non improvable items in the game...maybe a lot of them...So, I NEED your suggestions about these and about changes in the things I have done allready. Just let me know anything you think that would fit...\r\n\r\nP.S.: I know some of that changes I made (or all of them? )  ,maybe exists in other modder\\'s files.\r\n       I just wanted to make it all in one file my own and I didn\\'t \\\"copy\\\" anything from anyone.\r\n       Its my very first time playing with modding and I dont even consider myself as modder. So,\r\n       I truly respect real modders and if I had something from someone I would surely give the \r\n       credits.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy other Mods :\r\n\r\n- Summon Werewolf Fixed\r\n  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11342\r\n\r\n- Skull Masks\r\n  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15769",
