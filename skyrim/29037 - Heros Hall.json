  "summary": "An adequate house near Windhelm. Contains an entrance hall, dining hall, blacksmithing room, alchemy room, enchanting room, and a bedroom.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I appreciate any feedback on this, as it is my first mod. The Hero\\'s Hall is located on the riverbank of the river that passes by Windhelm. You\\'ll be able to enjoy a line of mannequins when you enter your home, as well as a dining hall, bedroom, blacksmithing room, alchemy room, and enchanting room. Each room has plenty of storage available for whatever you create. Unzip the zip file and read the readme file for installation instructions.  My modpack also contains a Mannequin fix script made by Daemonjax & SLuckyD. It adds to the quality of the house and I recommend installing it too.",
