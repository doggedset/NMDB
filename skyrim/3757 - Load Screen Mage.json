Read The Classy Pythons tutorial on how to mix races and with this dont use the race menu unless you read it because she will reset. So if you wanna make your own changes, you will need his tutorial.\r\n\r\nShe is in the tavern in Riverwood having just arrived from Helgen. All her gear is from that escape. Have not even spoken with anyone yet!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nMods used (to get same look at screenshots)\r\n\r\nBetter Females by Bella (with make up version 1, the very subtle, natural look)\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nHow to make your own:\r\nFollow the tutorial in The Art of Race Mixing by The Classy Python\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2614",
