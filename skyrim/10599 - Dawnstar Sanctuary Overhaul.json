  "descriptionHtml": "Overview:\r\n\r\nA progressive overhaul of the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary in Dawnstar. The goal is to transform the location into a much more useful base of operations, and a more visually interesting space, as well as overhauling the Dark Brotherhood end-game so the user feels a bit more like the leader of a strong and growing Dark Brotherhood. \r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n\r\nNow at version 1.96!\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s New?\r\n\r\n-Re-upload to attempt to resolve issues reported by some users\r\n-Revised lighting in the dining room area.\r\n-Tweaked the lighting profile for the entire Sanctuary to try and draw more warmth into the scene\r\n-The Dark Brotherhood Crypts are now accessible.\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n\r\n1.96-Maintenance update to attempt to resolve bugs reports by some users.\r\n1.95-Lighting update to kitchen. Switched light profile for the cell. Re-opened Crypt area.\r\n1.8-Cosmetic lighting update. Fireplace swap. Vendor AI improvements\r\n1.75-Magic vendor moved downstairs. Crafting stations added. Junk clean-up and decoration started.\r\n1.5-Magic vendor added. 02/19/12\r\n1.25-Fletcher vendor added. 02/19/12\r\n1.0-Lighting overhauled. (First public release) 02/18/12\r\n\r\nThe Long Version History:\r\n\r\nInititial release focused on the lighting of the Dark Brotherhood Dawnstar Sanctuary. I have overhauled the lighting by hand, focusing on the elimination of the single omni-lights in every room. They have been replaced by subtle source lighting, and sparing use of dynamic lights for more dramatic shadow effects.\r\n\r\nThe second and third releases focus on implementing two vendors in the Sanctuary. A Dunmer fletcher has set-up shop downstairs next to the training room to satisfy your archery needs. An Imperial vampire has also moved into the downstairs to peddle spells and magic supplies.\r\n\r\nThe fourth release moved the magic vendor downstairs and added 3 crafting stations, and added an Apothecary Satchel to the Alchemy table. The fletcher\\'s room now includes a workbench and grinding wheel. The magic vendors room now includes an arcane echanter. I\\'ve also begun to clean up some of the junk lying around and worked to decorate the vendor areas.\r\n\r\nFifth release focused on a few more lighting tweaks, adding a light to the upstairs area where Babette likes to sit. The lighting of the magic vendors room was adjusted to appear more sourced and subtle.\r\n\r\nThe sixth release focused on swapping the lighting template to a warmer profile, several lights were added in the Kitchen area, various light intensities were tweaked for scene clarity. The Crypt area was also re-opened, although access to the snow caves remains blocked. \r\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated. :)\r\n\r\nFuture releases will focus on making the Sanctuary a better base of operations included:\r\n\r\n* Vendors (Implemented. Working on tweaking vendor stock and behaviours)\r\n* Better crafting stations (In progress. Apothecary Satchel, Workbench, and Enchanting Table in place)\r\n* General junk clean-up and visual appeal (In progress. Focusing on vendor areas to start)\r\n* Room space and portal optimization \r\n* More player customization options\r\n* Unique items, and crafting opportunities\r\n* Additional Dark Brother questlines",
