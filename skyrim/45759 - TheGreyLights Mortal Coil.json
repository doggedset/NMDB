There is no little ball of blue light that flies out and hits it, the corpse is reanimated immediately. \r\n\r\n- It has a huge range, as long as you can see the corpse it can be animated. \r\n\r\n- All perks which alter the vanilla necromancy spells \\'Necromancy\\', \\'Twin Souls\\' etc. will also affect this power. \r\n\r\n- Also when the reanimation wears off, the corpse will not disintegrate. This means you can get multiple uses out of the same corpse. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere can it be found? At Hamvir\\'s Rest, the last image shows you its exact location. You are looking for a conjuration tome. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf someone would like to make a video showcasing this mod in action I would greatly appreciate it! :D",
