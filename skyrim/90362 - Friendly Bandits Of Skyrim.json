  "modName": "Friendly Bandits Of Skyrim",
  "summary": "This mod makes all bandits not slit your throat the moment they see you. In fact, they don't really do anything to you now. Great for those who have evil characters or for people who just want to RP as a bandit.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod simply makes the bandits friendly to you. You can get as close as possible and take all their stuff and they won't bat an eye. I don't know if this counts for every bandit but most won't attack you on sight\n<br />\n<br />To download all you have to do is bring the bandit.txt in the main folder here:C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim\n<br />\n<br />Then you go into the game and load into your character then type bat bandit in the console. Hope you have a good time with this mod.",
