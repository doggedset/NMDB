  "descriptionHtml": "Not much to this one. Currently the mod only changes the light legion shield but fairly soon I think ill be done with the larger one. This mod aims to capture a more gaudy roman feel to these specific pieces of the imperial legion gear without making them overly gaudy. So while yes, you will see some brass, it should hopefully not be too overwhelming.\r\n\r\nTo install, drag the textures folder into your skyrim data folder. Overwrite if asked.\r\n\r\nUninstall: Delete the file in the textures folder. Should be under Textures/Armour/Imperial, or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nNow, the good meaty bits: The light shield is still being worked on, so some minor details are missing. You roman historians will note that this isnt a 100 percent recreation of the scutum. Its not meant to be, it just adds some roman flair to the piece.\r\n\r\nThe \\'golden\\' plate with the LEC IV inscription is something i incorporated from some legion shields from the Pax Romana, or around Hadrian\\'s time. LEC is short for LEGIO. For those who want to know, the 4th legion is significant to skyrim because General Tullius was once noted to be in command of the 4th (and presumably the other imperial troops in the province, but the 4th is *his* army. Thats why I chose to include that specific bit. ",
