What does The Great Equalizer accomplish?\r<br />Simply put, this patcher script, built using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68617/?][color=#ffffff]MXPF[/color][/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/?][color=#ffffff]xEdit[/color][/url] scripting, will look at any load order and determine which of your mod-added weapons, armors, arrows, and bolts are out of balance with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34093/?][color=#ffffff]Weapons And Armor Fixes Remade[/color][/url], \r<br />its True Orcish Weapons optional file, and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83898/?][color=#ffffff]Proper Crossbow Integration[/color][/url].\r<br />It does this in an intelligent manner: it will only change what needs to be changed, and only provide those records in its patch file.\r<br />\r<br />No more, no less.\r<br />No mass-copying.\r<br />No messy clean-up.\r<br />Just one patch file that&#39;s ready to go.\r<br />\r<br />Do bear in mind that if you have mods that are cheaty in nature, whose stats are intended to be higher than normal, \r<br />that The Great Equalizer will normalize its values and bring them down to a sane level.\r<br />\r<br />For instance, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59335/?][color=#ffffff]Dragonslayer Bows And Siege Arrows[/color][/url].\r<br />It&#39;s a great mod, intended to take down dragons easily when using dragon enhancing mods, such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3829/][color=#ffffff]Deadly Dragons[/color][/url].\r<br />The problem is that if you try to run this mod through the patcher, it will bring those bows down to something a lot more tame.\r<br />I&#39;ve included options (detailed in the readme) that will allow you to exclude entire mods such as this from TGE&#39;s patching process.\r<br />\r<br />Do keep in mind that this patcher will only take weapons, armors, and ammo into consideration for its process.\r<br />Everything else is considering fine as far as The Great Equalizer is concerned.\r<br />\r<br />Lastly, and excuse the caps, [b][u]PLEASE READ THE README[/u][/b].\r<br />There are a lot of things I simply will not go over on this page which I go into great detail with in the readme.\r<br />This includes, but is not limited to, a feature called &#34;modes&#34; that TGE, and the optional patchers, have.\r<br />Another example, record and file exclusions.\r<br />Again, all in the readme.\r<br />\r<br />[line][line][size=5][b][color=#ffffff]REQUIREMENTS[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />[line][line]\r<br />A legitimate copy of Skyrim.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68617/?][color=#ffffff]MXPF[/color][/url] \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/?][color=#ffffff]xEdit[/color][/url] \r<br />\r<br />That&#39;s it. It doesn&#39;t change any vanilla records, so having the DLCs are irrelevant.\r<br />Having them is fine, but the patcher just doesn&#39;t care about them.\r<br />Other than those three requirements, you should have an armor, weapon, arrow, or bolt mod you want to patch, or several.\r<br />[b]Or all of them[/b].\r<br />\r<br />Otherwise, The Great Equalizer will just kind of not do anything.\r<br />\r<br />[line][line][size=5][b][color=#ffffff]INSTALLATION AND USAGE[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />[line][line]\r<br />Drag and drop the files you extract from the download and drop it in your &#39;Edit Scripts&#39; folder inside your TES5Edit directory. \r<br />There should now be one file and one folder in the Edit Scripts directory.\r<br />Once that&#39;s done, all you have to do is fire up TES5Edit, right click anywhere on the left in the ESP view, and click &#34;apply script.&#34;\r<br />Find &#34;The Great Equalizer&#34; and run that bad boy.\r<br />\r<br />Of note is that I&#39;ve included multiple user toggles within the main script.\r<br />I&#39;ve made sure to go into a lot of detail for each patcher in the readme, so refer to that&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Once you&#39;ve named your fancy soon-to-be-made patch file, The Great Equalizer will do its magic \r<br />and equalize every weapon, armor, arrow, and bolt it can possibly account for.\r<br />Just sit tight, expect a patching time of under to at most 20 minutes.\r<br />That is, unless you run an obscene amount of mods through it.\r<br />On a test I did, I ran 28,000 records through it, and it only took around 15 minutes.\r<br />So there&#39;s that.\r<br />\r<br />[line][line][size=5][b][color=#ffffff]OTHER USEFUL INFORMATION[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />[line][line]\r<br />Once again, in the readme, you will find any and all information you need to know when running TGE or the optional patchers.\r<br />\r<br />Speaking of which, there are three optional patching scripts.\r<br />Alter Weapon Speeds -will change any modded weapon&#39;s speed to reflect vanilla values.\r<br />Change RNAM To Default - changes the race entry in worn items to be the default race.\r<br />Immersive Weapon Reaches - changes all weapon types from mods to reflectÂ Kelsenellenelvian&#39;s ideas on how far they should reach.\r<br />\r<br />Any and all of which can be run in tandem with TGE, either before or after.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to run them all. run TGE first, then go into each patcher&#39;s main script,\r<br />and set inclusion mode, including only the patch generated by TGE in their patching process.\r<br />This will reduce your ESP count, as you&#39;ll only have one after this instead of four,\r<br />plus you won&#39;t have to merge them into one yourself.\r<br />\r<br />For more information on inclusive mode, see the readme.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;re probably wondering when you should run this. Luckily, I have a simple answer for you.\r<br />Run it before any other patcher: Merged Patch, Bashed Patch, SkyProc Patcher, etc.\r<br />\r<br />Why?\r<br />Let&#39;s take a practical example.\r<br />\r<br />Say you&#39;re working with PerMa. \r<br />If you run PerMa and then The Great Equalizer, expect general imbalance with any weapon touched by PerMa.\r<br />This is because PerMa does, from my understanding, something similar to my script: it balances weapons and armors.\r<br />However it does this according to its own methodology to fit its own goals, as opposed to mine, which tries to stick to vanilla values.\r<br />On the other hand, if you run PerMa after The Great Equalizer, you&#39;ll get all buffs and debuffs expected from PerMa.\r<br />This is because PerMa will take what my script gives it and apply its own logic to them.\r<br />With all this being said, this is pure speculation from what I understand of PerMa.\r<br />All I can say is try either way and find what works best for you.\r<br />\r<br />Think of this script as literally making the stats even across the board. \r<br />If anything comes before it and gives a weapon a buff, that buff will be discarded when it&#39;s run through The Great Equalizer.\r<br />However if you run this script before that buff occurs, you get smooth balance with those added buffs.\r<br />\r<br />As with all patching processes, use a bit of common sense and always check the results after it&#39;s done.\r<br />If you don&#39;t like the results, change things up and see what happens.\r<br />Worst case is you lost time making your game better.\r<br />So kind of a win/win, if you ask me.\r<br />\r<br />[line][line][size=5][b][color=#ffffff]CLOSING THOUGHTS[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />[line][line]\r<br />I&#39;m not in a position where I can promise support.\r<br />Modding Skyrim (and consequently making mods) is a sort of on-off thing for me: I do it for a while, then lose interest for months, and in some instances, years.\r<br />\r<br />The making of TGE V2 has taken a great deal out of me, so expect V2 to be the final version.\r<br />As of its release, I consider TGE to be feature complete.\r<br />It meets and exceeds all of my expectations.\r<br />And that is something I&#39;m more than happy leaving things at.\r<br />\r<br />With that being said, I&#39;m totally cool with people doing bug-fix stuff if there are bugs you pick up on.\r<br />\r<br />Also, the big question: SSE.\r<br />The answer: [b][u]no[/u][/b].\r<br />\r<br />I have zero interest in playing SSE, much less making mods for it.\r<br />If someone wants to make this work for SSE though, go right ahead&#33;\r<br />I have no problem with that whatsoever.\r<br />\r<br />The only thing I ask is if you do convert it, or bug-fix, that you credit me as the original author.\r<br />Credit where credit is due, and all that. \r<br />\r<br />Lastly, DO NOT SELL ANY PART OF MY MOD, IN PART OR WHOLE. \r<br />This includes, but is not limited to, paid mod schemes, or sites such as Adfly.[/i][/size][/font][/color][/center]\r<br />[line][line][line][line][center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/86176-0-1503272102.png[/img][/center][line][line][line][line]",
