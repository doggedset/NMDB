  "descriptionHtml": "Hello.\r\n\r\nPLEASE READ THIS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING!\r\n\r\nThis mod modifies default dog texture \\\"dog.dds\\\" (1024*1024) to a more evil and bloody variation \r\n(eyes evil-orange, face covered in blood).\r\n\r\nHow to install.\r\n\r\nFirst extract the archive You downloaded, when if You don\\'t have any other texture mods installed\r\nsimply place \\\"textures\\\" folder You extracted from archive to \\\"Data\\\" folder wich is located in\r\n\\\"Skyrim\\\" folder, that should do it.\r\nIf You already have some texture mods installed (assuming none of them are dog textures) when place\r\n\\\"dog\\\" folder (the one containing \\\"dog.dds\\\") in \\\"actors\\\" folder (\\\"actors\\\" folder should be in \\\"textures\\\" folder \r\nbut if You don\\'t have it just create it in \\\"Data\\\" folder wich is located in \\\"Skyrim\\\" folder), the point is that\r\nin order for mod to work \\\"dog.dds\\\" must be placed under Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\dog    ,now it \r\nshould work.\r\n\r\nHow to uninstall.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall delete \\\"dog.dds\\\" or dog folder with it.\r\n\r\nThe original dog textures wich i modified is made by Bethesda.\r\n\r\nUPDATE.\r\n\r\nNow I also uploaded a mod for dog normals texture (archive with \\\"dog_n.dds\\\") so the blood on dogs\r\nface will look pretty much more realistic, at least it\\'s my personal opinion.\r\nSee images \\\"dog new normals\\\" and \\\"dog old normals\\\" to compare (\\\"dog new normals\\\" is the image\r\nthat shows the result of normals mod I added recently).\r\nIt can be installed and uninstalled the same way as the main mod (of course installing it without\r\nthe main mod would be pointless).\r\n\r\n\r\nGoodbye.",
