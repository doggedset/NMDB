  "summary": "This adds a simple fully-voiced Argonian follower to the Temple of Kynareth. He is also not lore-friendly.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is for an uncomplicated, non-lore friendly, comedic Argonian follower. He can be found in the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun. He is my first mod, so feel free to mention any issues regarding him. Because this is the first, I&#39;d also like to know if he was working properly. He should be free from all DLC, and uses no scripts (unconfirmed however, I may have accidentally changed something). He was completed a year ago, but I decided not to upload him. Recently, I thought might as well.\r<br />\r<br />Thank you for taking the time to look this mod over.\r<br />[color=#0000ff]\r<br />[color=#3c78d8][size=4]Key Features[/size][/color][/color]\r<br />200+ lines of dialogue, with area specific dialogue.[b]\r<br />[/b]His dialog often refers to the internet, games, and cartoons, sprinkled with other types.\r<br />Also contains some profanity and light racism (racism in terms of the references he makes, Ex. &#34;Redguard stole my bike&#33;&#34;). Doesn&#39;t go overboard, though.\r<br />Not lore-friendly\r<br />\r<br />[color=#3c78d8][size=4]Basic Stats[/size][/color]\r<br />Essential\r<br />Stats - Levels up with player\r<br />Confidence - Foolhardy\r<br />Helps - Friends and allies\r<br />Crime - Any\r<br />Inventory - Whiterun Guard Armor, Fur Boots, Iron Warhammer\r<br />Scale - .85\r<br />Not a marriage candidate\r<br />\r<br />- - Also, if you happen to know a good tutorial for making a custom singing bard that won&#39;t require this mod to use other mods, please notify me. - -\r<br />[b]\r<br />[youtube]3XVtL8QSjz0[/youtube][/b][center][/center]\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=4][b]- Spoilers -[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Full dialogue here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QruGEz4G0MA\r<br />Headphones not recommended for this particular video.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]Issues[/size][/color] (Unconfirmed, I have several mods that may be the problem, not the follower)\r<br />Removes some follower lines from Mjoll the Lioness, J&#39;zargo, and Onmund.\r<br />Mjoll may not be able to be dismissed if you have her follow you.\r<br />Inconsistent talking, although mostly chatty.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]Issues[/size][/color] (Confirmed)\r<br />None\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]Incompatibilities[/size][/color]\r<br />Anything that may drastically change the Temple of Kynareth cell. If you can&#39;t get to him because of this, open up the console commands,\r<br />type &#34;help rolaak,&#34; and then &#34;placeatme (his ID Code)&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]Unpolished issues[/size][/color]\r<br />Background noises may not have been properly removed from certain lines, although the majority is pretty clear.\r<br />May be louder than vanilla NPCs, not overbearing, though.\r<br />\r<br />Despite all of this, he seems pretty problem free. I&#39;ve used him without noticing anything too unusual.\r<br />\r<br />You may have to do this before using him, although he may just work automatically.\r<br />1. Go outside the Temple of Kynareth and save.\r<br />2.
