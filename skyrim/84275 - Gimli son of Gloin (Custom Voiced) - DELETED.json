  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#38761d][font=Trebuchet MS]Gimli son of Gloin can be found in the Sleeping Giant&#39;s Inn in Riverwood, mostly sitting at a table or mixing potions at the Alchemy Lab.\r<br />Have fun adventuring with him through Skyrim&#33;[/font]\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=931946440][color=#b45f06]Mod site of the Steam Workshop[/color][/url]\r<br />[color=#00ffff]\r<br />[u][size=3]How to install:[/size][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Simply copy the contents of the Data Folder into your Data folder (For Steam Users: C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data).\r<br />\r<br />If you already have one of the mods listed in the Credits, it may ask you if you want to replace the files with the same names. It shouldn&#39;t be a problem if you accept&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=3][u]Bugs:[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />- When you tell Gimli to follow you, wait till he stands up from his bench&#33; He will then get smaller to his Dwarf size, and he is then fully functional. If you leave the Inn before he stands up, he will likely be the same height as you, which makes him glitchy.\r<br />\r<br />- If Gimli does not appear with you after you fast travelled, try fast travelling back to Riverwood (or your last destination) and then try to fast travel again. If that doesn&#39;t work, I suggest restarting the game, it really does help&#33;\r<br />\r<br />- If Gimli disappears and isn&#39;t in the Sleeping Giant&#39;s Inn, you probably need to restart the game and he&#39;ll be there again.\r<br />\r<br />- If you sneak at an enemy camp, and they detect you, it may happen that Gimli stays crouched forever even if you stand up again. I sadly don&#39;t have a solution except to load your last saved game / restart the game :/\r<br />\r<br />- If you encounter any other bugs, or found a way to solve them, please share them in the Comments Section&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#bf9000][size=3][u]Credits:[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#bf9000]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12092/?]- The Green Burlap Cloak of Gimli is from the &#34;Cloaks of Skyrim&#34; Mod on Nexus&#33;[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57839/?]- Gimli&#39;s Axe has been made by InsanitySorrow from Nexus Mods&#33;[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=171805667&searchtext=The+Fellowship]- The Armor and Appearance has been made by JP Doctor from Steam Workshop&#33;[/url][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=3][u]Permissions:[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />- Feel free to use this mod as long as you don&#39;t earn any money with it, and please put me and the creators of the mods listed above (Credits) into your credits.\r<br />\r<br />- Do not download this mod and upload the exact same file on another website like Nexus Mods without contacting me.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[u]\r<br />[/u][color=#38761d][u]P.S.\r<br />\r<br />[/u][size=2]Gimli doesn&#39;t even count as a Follo[/size][/color][color=#38761d][size=2]wer, so you can have two&#33;[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#38761d]I am glad for every download / endorsement&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#bf9000]- Gimli son of Gloin\r<br />\r<br />[/color][color=#b45f06][url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198094583592/]My Steam Profile[/url][/color]",
