Here are the stuff that has changed.\n<br />\n<br />- You can activate this power whenever you want! (You have to wait 3 or 5 seconds after you activated it, don't get confused with after the effect is gone)\n<br />- Duration is prolonged (Default was 60 seconds, now it's 100 seconds)\n<br />- Particle effect (the one in the magic menu selection screen) is changed. (Because I didn't like the presentation of it)",
