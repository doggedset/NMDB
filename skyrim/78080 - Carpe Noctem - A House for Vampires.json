Off to the side of the living quarters, heading to the bedrooms, there is an alchemy station with storage for ingredients, and an enchanters station with storage, and respawnable gems on shelves. \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[/size][/color][/font][font=verdana][color=#cccccc][size=3]\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[/size][/color][/font][font=Verdana][color=#999999][size=4]Bedrooms: [/size][/color][/font][font=Verdana][color=#ffffff][size=3]The first bedroom to the left on the hall is designed to be a secondary bedroom for guests such as your housecarl or companions/spouse. It comes with two upright coffins and wardrobes inside a little cutout. Some vampire armour can be found inside the shelves. It is well lit with a fireplace and has plenty of room as it could act as a house all by itself. Plenty of weapon racks and mannequins line the room to add decoration, as well as a few potions of blood laying around. A bone hawk amulet and ring can be found on the cupboard across from the coffins. The second bedroom, or the last one at the end of the hall is more designed to be the players room. It also comes with two coffins, plenty of storage for the player, organized chests (or a bunch of random messy chests for non-organized folk), mannequins, weapon displays, shrine statues, potions of blood, Royal vampire armour, some gold, bookshelves, and much more decoration.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[/size][/color][/font][font=Verdana][color=#999999][size=4]Shrine of Molag Bal: [/size][/color][/font][font=Verdana][color=#ffffff][size=3]This one is very self explanatory, it adds a small shrine at the end of the hall that you can activate and you will perform a kneeling animation, then drink some of the blood coming from the fountain. A few things scatter the shrine, such as the Mace of Molag Bal, some deathbell, a human heart, a filled black soul gem, and a book called &#39;Book of Common Daedra&#39;.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[/size][/color][/font][font=Verdana][color=#999999][size=4]Kitchen: [/size][/color][/font][font=Verdana][color=#ffffff][size=3]A well lit area connected straight to the dining room, with access to the dungeon. It comes with a small bar and bartender for cheap drinks such as mead or ale. It also includes a few chairs and round tables, but not any large ones. Around the oven are a few sacks laying around and tables covered with delicious meals and food ingredients. Rabbits, quails, garlic, spice, all hang on racks. A butter churn is located nearby for butter to create things inside the oven.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[/size][/color][/font][font=Verdana][color=#999999][size=4] \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Dining Room: [/size][/color][/font][font=Verdana][color=#ffffff][size=3]The dining room is inbetween the kitchen and living quarters, and is very opened up to them. Large tables take up the middle space, with a feast laid out, both normal food, and vampire food, such as human flesh, blood, etc.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[/size][/color][/font][font=Verdana][color=#999999][size=4]Dungeon: [/size][/color][/font][/center]",
