  "summary": "",
  "descriptionHtml": "After installing Eze\\'s Artifact Disenchanting mod you\\'ll likely find all silver weapons are priced suddenly at 8k.\r\nNot sure why that is - probably a box he overlooked.\r\n\r\nThis fixes it reverting pricing back to vanilla, just put it below his mod in load order.\r\n\r\nPlease endorse if you find useful, always happy to get endorsements.\r\n--\r\nPlease Note I have just come back after 4 months away from Skyrim, and found Eze updated his mod, however didn\\'t fix the issue. (I have issued stern mails about this fact).\r\n\r\nAs a result and the fact that he\\'s never replied to me in the past, I\\'ve updated it for the new 5.5 version of his mod. Enjoy.\r\n",
