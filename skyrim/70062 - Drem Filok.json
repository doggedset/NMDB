  "descriptionHtml": "This is a player home mod complete with many useful utilities that any player might need upon returning to their safe house&#33; This mod was created to make trips back to your safe house easy, quick and convenient, allowing more time for quests and exploration in the wonderful world of Skyrim&#33; This home is one cell, one room, and one load screen&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Included: - All crafting stations - Every Standing Stone - Every Shrine of the Divines - Every Trainer (capable of training to level 100) - A personal merchant (with 20,000 gold, a large assortment of useful items, and the ability to purchase your stolen goods&#33;) - Several safe, non-respawning storage containers.\r<br />\r<br /> ***Known bugs/issues*** - Dialogue lines for some original trainers have been altered, resulting in unspoken lines. These original trainers are still capable of training skills, however. - Training costs for skills above level 90 are relatively cheap (around 900 gold). I intend to set these costs higher as soon as I figure out how. :/ \r<br />\r<br />Location: South/Southwest of Dushnikh Yal in the Reach. Feel free to reference screenshots provided.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you all enjoy&#33; This is my first mod so please feel free to leave comments, suggestions, bugs, etc. and I will do my best to address them.",
