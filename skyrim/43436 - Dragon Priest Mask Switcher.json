  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b]Description[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I was chatting with a friend on Steam when they said they wished to create a mage character. They said it was a shame that the Dragon Priest masks were all armored. I figured that I could make a mod that added Light, Heavy, and Clothing versions of all Dragon Priest masks (in both Vanilla Skyrim and Dragonborn) and a method of switching the masks between each type to suit different styles of characters.\r<br />\r<br />That&#39;s exactly what I did.\r<br />I took each Dragon Priest mask and created Light/Heavy/Clothing versions of them. \r<br />After that, I went and created many new smithing recipes (about 7 per mask). Each mask type can be swapped for each other. The option should be under the Daedric smithing menu (and only if you have the mask in your inventory)\r<br />\r<br />There is also an option to upgrade (at the armor table) the light/heavy masks that were added. \r<br />\r<br />For the Dragonborn version, I included all the Acolyte masks and Miraak.\r<br />The Miraak masks can only be swapped for heavy/light/clothing in their level range. You cannot swap a level 44 (or lower) mask for the level 60 mask. However, I did include the option to upgrade the mask when you reach the appropriate level. \r<br />\r<br />When you reach level 45, you will be able to upgrade the mask for the second most powerful version.\r<br />When you reach level 60, you will be able to upgrade the mask to the strongest version.\r<br />All it will cost is your mask (that gets changed, obviously), a Daedra Heart, and an Ebony Ingot.\r<br />\r<br />Also included are a Dragonborn/Vanilla version that change the weight and armor values of the masks to match their materials. Smithing recipes are also changed. It will cost more to switch your mask out for another type, preventing you from switching masks constantly. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\r<br />Drag and drop the .esp file of your choice into the data folder, then activate with your chosen mod manager.\r<br />To uninstall, delete the .esp file.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility:[/b]\r<br />This is not compatible with other mods that edit Dragon Priest masks.\r<br />If you have another mod that edits the masks, load it below this one so its changes overwrite the ones here. You should still get the crafting if you do that. \r<br />If not, pick and choose one mod only. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Changes:[/b]\r<br />October 3rd: Fixed the wrong armor types for a Volsung and Rahgot mask.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/xLdZTNC.png[/img][/url][/center]",
