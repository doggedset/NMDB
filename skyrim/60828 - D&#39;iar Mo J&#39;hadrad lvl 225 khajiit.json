  "descriptionHtml": "   If you have made your way to this page, then I thank you. I have poured over 20 days into this save. D&#39;iar is a female khajiit currently at level 225.\r<br />Almost all skills are maxed out with the exception of a few, all available perks have been bought for the level of the skill. Listed below is the skills that are currently not maxed out. Skills that are legendary have been indicated with an asterisk*.\r<br />\r<br />Pickpocket**-37\r<br />\r<br />Alchemy-38\r<br />\r<br />Destruction*-40\r<br />\r<br />Sneak*-76\r<br />\r<br />Heavy Armor*-84\r<br />\r<br />Speech-84\r<br />\r<br />Two handed*-99\r<br />\r<br />This was an Xbox 360 play-through, so no mods have ever been installed, nor has the console ever been used.\r<br />\r<br />**Important information** There is a cupboard in proudspire manor that contains dragon masks, you may notice that a few masks are missing. Rahgot is currently residing with Kharjo in the caravan, and Otar is on another follower though I am not sure which. Ahzidal is also missing, the mask rests with the body of Azhidal at the bottom of Kolbjorn barrow, you can retrieve it if you like. And finally, Miraak. Mirrak&#39;s body fell into the pool after he was killed, rendering me unable to retrieve any of his loot, the only way to get it is by console commands. The Quest &#34;blood on the ice&#34; is currently bugged. I Have not worked on hearthfire extensively. The main dawnguard and dragonbor questlines are both completed. Game is 95% complete including quests and mapmarkers (excluding solstiem)",
