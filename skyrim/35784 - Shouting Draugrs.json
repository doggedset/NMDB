  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nHave bored with monotonous dungeons? Draugr Deathlords are not challenging anymore? Each Draugr behave like the others? Enhance your crawling experience with the Shouting Draugrs mod! Now almost every Draugr is unique and dangerous!\r\n\r\nNow powerful Draugrs know few more shouts in addition to conventional Unrelenting Force and Disarm. Draugrs can use following  thu\\'ums and their combinations now:\r\n\r\nUnrelenting Force\r\nDisarm\r\nFire Breath\r\nFrost Breath\r\nMarked for Death\r\nIce Form (be careful, cause this shout is very dangerous).\r\n\r\nEach Draugr from Scourge to Death Overlord know one to four of the shouts depending on it\\'s range (Scourges - 1 shout, Overlords and Deathlords - 2 shouts, Wight Lords and Scourge Lords- 3 shouts, Death Overlords - 4 shouts).\r\n\r\nEnjoy your new experience and good luck!\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/size]\r\nThis mod requires only Skyrim.esm as a master file.\r\nThis mod is compatible with both Dawnguard and Dragonborn, but it doesn\\'t  endow Hulking Draugrs with shouts so far.\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]COMPATIBILITY[/b][/size]\r\nSince this mod changes Draugr\\'s level lists, most probably it won\\'t work with any essential Draugr\\'s replacers.\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]CHANGE LOG[/b][/size]\r\nV 1.0 - first out-of-beta version, try it!\r\nDragonborn update will be realised soon.\r\n\r\nSpanish translation may be found here:\r\nskyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36748\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=green]Please, feel free to comment the mod and make proposals regarding following development.[/color][/size]\r\n",
