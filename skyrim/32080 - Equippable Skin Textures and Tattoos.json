  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=20][b]Equippable Skin Textures[/b][/size]\r\nSwitch your skin anytime and anywhere you want!\r\nPowered by [i]Anti-Vanish[/i] and [i]Equip&Stick[/i]![/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#ff3333][size=16][b]This currently has an unfortunate BUG:[/size]\r\nAfter Saving and loading again your Armor will become invisible.\r\nSaving and loading once more fixes this.[/b]\r\nQuicksave and Quickload fixes it very fast, but my pride does not allow a solution THIS dirty.\r\n\r\nConcrete bug details, according to my research:[/color]\r\nIf you can equip your current armor on top of the tattoo, regardless how often you save, any save made will have your armor invisible when you load it.\r\nVice Versa, if it is not working, any save made will have it working when loaded.\r\nThis is for each Armor individually, so you can have a working and a non working armor at the same time.\r\nIf anyone does not have this bug and is willing to help out, please tell me. :)\r\n\r\nEstimate for fix: Unknown, since cause of bug unknown. Sad Quaggan is sad. Oh wait, that was a different game...\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Current Features:[/b]\r\n- Switch your Skin Textures by Equipping an item.\r\n- Works for both female and male.\r\n- *Should* support all bodymods.\r\n- Works for all vanilla races.\r\n- Stays visible beneath armor.\r\n- No actual textures included. Use textures found in tattoo mods here. How to explained further down.\r\n- An Example texture pack. Based on the 1.51 body textures of UNP and two .psd tattoo packs. Credits in the credit section.\r\n\r\n[b]Current Version Notes:[/b]\r\n- Only tested with UNP Body and Vanilla Male Body.\r\n- I have no idea if it works with custom races. To my knowledge it might do, but since I have no custom race installed, I can\\'t test it right now.\r\n- Skin only changes if you have no Body Armor on. Just unequip armor, change skin, equip armor.\r\n- Only dummy textures included, not replacing them will result in blue skin (which means this mod is working as intended, you just need the textures)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]That is totally awesome! How does it work?[/b]\r\nThis mod enables you to change your skin texture by equipping an item.\r\nAs of v0.3, there are 5 Items (Equippable Skin 1 ... 5) craftable in the Forge under Misc.\r\nEquipping these will switch your skin texture to tattoo1 ... 5.dds found in \\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\EquipSkins\\\\{racegender}\\\\. Obviously \\\"Equippable Skin 3\\\" will award you with tattoo3.dds as your new skin.\r\n\r\n[b]But I use my super hyper self crafted awesome Texture for my selfmade Bodymod! Will it still work?[/b]\r\nBodymod: I have only tested it with UNP. It worked just fine. It *should* work with any other Bodymod aswell, since I do not touch any meshes. (Could somebody confirm this please? :) )\r\nTextures: Not included, to use your own texture. As the tattoo will not be an overlay but a complete skin texture, it will overwrite your current skin texture. Tutorial on how to add tattoos to your own skintexture in the making.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]How to add textures:[/b]\r\nFirst off, you don\\'t need any programs like photoshop or gimp. You only need to know how to use the explorer to copy and rename files.\r\n#1 Download a tattoo texture for your bodymod from anywhere. It will contain a femalebody_1.dds or malebody_1.dds.\r\n#2 Extract it somewhere. Rename it to tattoo1.dds or what number you want to use.\r\n#3 Copy it.\r\n#4 Browse to \\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\EquipSkins\\\\. Open the subfolder for your race and gender. (Anything not mentioned goes in male / female).\r\n#5 Paste the renamed file there. Replace the dummy .dds file. (Just there so you know you are in the right folder.)\r\n#6 Repeat process for other files.\r\n#7 ???\r\n#8 Profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Plans:[/b]\r\n-Find an easy possibility to create tattooed version of the skin texture you are currently using. Currently playing around with texblend.\r\n-Actually had success with the above plan. But it\\'s rather complicated and I have no tatto or scar textures I could deliver with it.\r\n-Add texture packs already containing tattoos for easy installation.\r\n\r\n[b]Credits:[/b]\r\nObviously, Bethesda.\r\nTextures used in the example texture pack:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]UNP Body Texture 1.51[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7834/]candymanXXL\\'s .psd Tattoo ressource[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/371/]abb1\\'s Modders Ressource Tattoos[/url]\r\nSince both have been labeled as free for use I have taken the liberty and uploaded them. If you want me to remove them, just tell me.\r\n\r\nTextures used in screenshots:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/371/]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/371/[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7834/]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7834/[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19622/]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19622/[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19726/]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19726/[/url]\r\nAnd all the tattoo texture makers, that made me want to have a tattoo on my character.\r\n\r\n[b]Final Notes & Permissions:[/b]\r\nThis is my first self made mod, so I\\'m kinda like this cute guy:\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/kiwXUBl.jpg?1[/img]\r\n\r\nPlease do not upload this mod to any other site.\r\nIf you want to spread it, just link them here.\r\nIf you want to use my mod to create your own equippable skin, please credit me.\r\nIf you have created a texture pack for this mod, just message me and I link to it.",
