  "descriptionHtml": "[center][/center]Name: The World Eater - An Alduin Retexture\n<br />Version: 1.0\n<br />Date: 9/28/2013\n<br />Category: Models and Textures\n<br />Author(s): AurianaValoria1\n<br />Source: SkyrimNexus\n<br />\n<br />[center]\n<br />[size=3]Just putting this out there to make it clear:\n<br />\n<br />[b][i]I will not grant anyone else permission to port my Skyrim mods to SSE. I will do it myself when I have the inclination and the opportunity.[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />I'm sorry if this decision disappoints you, but I would like to be responsible for my own mod pages and how the mods behave in the game. \n<br />\n<br />I have no idea how my mods for Oldrim will work in SSE, even after conversion, and I want to have a proper handle on that [i]myself [/i]before I put them out there for other people to use in their games.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Thanks,[/size]\n<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#B45F06][size=3]Auri[/size][/color][/font][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />Details\n<br />=======\n<br />Simply alters Alduin's textures to a darker and less shiny version. I've also slightly adjusted his eyes to be a darker and more vibrant red.\n<br />\n<br />**Note: Any mod that references Alduin's textures will change with this mod. IE: If an armor mod uses Alduin's textures, the color of the armor will change to match the dragon.**\n<br />\n<br />Install\n<br />=======\n<br />1. Extract the files to a temporary location like the desktop.\n<br />2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.\n<br />3. Copy files to (install folder)SkyrimData\n<br />\n<br />Uninstall\n<br />=========\n<br />1. Delete the file folder called \"Alduin\" in SkryimDatatexturesactors.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Incompatibility\n<br />===============\n<br />Any other mod that retextures Alduin. This mod does have its own normalmap, so if you use a mod that alters Alduin's normal, this will overwrite that file as well.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />History\n<br />=======\n<br />1.0, 2013/09/28 - Initial release.\n<br />\n<br />Contact\n<br />=======\n<br />Comment or send me a PM.\n<br />\n<br />Credits\n<br />=======\n<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />Tools Used\n<br />==========\n<br />7-Zip\n<br />GIMP\n<br />Paint.NET\n<br />Readme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\n<br />\n<br />Licensing/Legal\n<br />===============\n<br />This mod is not to be distributed to any other site, regardless of whether or not you can contact me. Translations are welcome, but I would appreciate a PM.",
