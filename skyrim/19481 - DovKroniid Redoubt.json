So you are asking yourself, &#34;Why bother to become Thane of Hjallmarch?&#34; Tired of push-over quest lines, and player homes that are no challenge to obtain? If so, DovKroniid Redoubt may be a Mod for you&#33;\r<br />\r<br />DovKroniid Redoubt is a massive fortification on the border of Whiterun and Hjaalmarch holds. This former Imperial fortification guards the strategic caravan and trade route from Whiterun through the Labyrinthian Ruins complex and on to Morthal, Dawnstar and Solitude. The origins of the Redoubt are shrouded in the mysteries of the Dragon Wars of the Merethic Era. In the Dragon language, DovKroniid means “Conqueror of the Dragon Race,” And therefore may have been constructed on the site of an original residence of the great Nord heroes of that era, Hakon One-eye, Felldir the Old, or Gormlaith Golden-hilt. This fortification was abandoned, like many in Skyrim during the Great War, and subsequently has fallen into a state of disrepair and been taken over by a strong bandit faction led by a figure calling himself The Bandit King. Bandits and deserters from the civil war have flocked to the station, making it a formidable obstacle to regional stability and trade. The Bandit King faction has erected an additional watch camp locating it where the main road from Whiterun meets the trade road into the Labyrinthian pass. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Quest: [NOTE: Quest version not built as of current 0.3.2 release]\r<br />\r<br />The player must clear the caravan route to Morthal. This will involve clearing the bandits in the entire central Whiterun Hold region (Fort Greymoor, Redoran’s Retreat, Silent Moons Camp, Halted Stream Camp, and Dovkroniid Redoubt and its Advanced Camp). In addition, any threats in the exterior of the Labyrinthian must be dealt with so that merchant and Khajiit caravans may pass through the area unmolested.\r<br />\r<br />DovKroniid Redoubt will not be an easy nut to crack. It is heavily recommended that mercenaries or multiple followers be procured to deal with this major bandit infestation.\r<br />\r<br />Once the trade route is open and the redoubt has been conquered and held, the Manor House can be occupied by the player. After the player has become Thane of Hjaalmarch, it will be available for purchase as a player home and upgrades will be purchasable from a merchant agent in Morthal. A housecarl, Hildara, a powerful Altmer spell sword, will also be available.\r<br />\r<br />There will be plenty of additional upgrades and surprises associated with this complex and its quest lines. \r<br />\r<br />Full discussion is facilitated at the Bethesda Skyrim TESV Forum thread at: http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1390491-wipzrelzbeta-dovkroniid-redoubt/#entry21102141 \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />SCHEDULED RELEASE VERSIONS\r<br />\r<br />Pre Beta 0.0.0 [extremely limited release] [COMPLETE]\r<br />DovKroniidAdvanced Camp complete and populated.
