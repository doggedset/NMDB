  "descriptionHtml": "Short description:\r<br />------------------------------------\r<br />Makes arrows and/or magic projectiles slower in Requiem 1.7.3. The changes affect arrow velocity as well.\r<br />\r<br />Arrows are much slower and now it is much easier to outmaneuver a single archer. Fighting several archers is still deadly, though. Running in a straight line will still get you shot.\r<br />\r<br />Magic projectiles such as fireballs and ice spikes are also made slower and can be evaded with some effort.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you like the new arrow speed, but feel like it is a bit too easy to avoid getting shot, try decreasing the arrow spread degree in Requiem&#39;s MCM settings.",
