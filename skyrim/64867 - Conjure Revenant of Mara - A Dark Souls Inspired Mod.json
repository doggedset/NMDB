  "descriptionHtml": "[b][i][size=5]YOU CANNOT USE ANYTHING IF YOU UPLOAD TO STEAM WORKSHOP[/size][/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This is a lore friendly adaption of Executioner Smough and Siegmeyer of Catarina from Dark Souls. This mod allows you to summon a Revenant of Mara. The Revenant is a creature based off Executioner Smough from Dark Souls. \r<br />\r<br />It is the same cost as conjuring a Dremora. He&#39;s pretty powerful.\r<br />\r<br />To find this spell, travel to Deep Folk Crossing and kill the Imperial bandit named Siegmeyer of Bravil. He also carries a unique Zweihandler and a unique steel plate helm. They&#39;re both improvable. \r<br />\r<br />All the items in this mod use vanilla textures so any fancy texture mods you have will apply to this too.\r<br />\r<br />Lore:\r<br />\r<br />A Revenant of Mara is a unique monster associated with Mara. Long ago, Priests of the Great Chapel of Mara in Bravil would capture heretics and bind them in statues of their lady Mara. This resulting creature would then hunt heretics in the name of the temple.\r<br />\r<br />This mod should be compatible with anything. \r<br />\r<br />Credit:\r<br />-Vicn for his resources\r<br />-I rerigged the Smough armor to Draugr animations.",
