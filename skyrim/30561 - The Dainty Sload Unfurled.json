  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o22/98LS1TA/promshipadrt.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n==================\r\n[color=#00ff7f]Description:[/color]\r\n==================\r\n\r\nA simple mod that unfurls the Dainty Sload\\'s sails by using PROMETHEUS_ts\\'s sail mesh. It is a mesh replacer of the Dainty Sload so no esp is needed and it is safe to uninstall if you ever want to.\r\n\r\nThis mod does not allow you to actually sail the boat around Skyrim. Again, it is just a mesh replacer.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I know it doesn\\'t make sense for the sails to be unfurled for a ship that is at port. I just wanted some more variety in my game and figured maybe some other people would have a similar feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n==================\r\n[color=#00ff7f]Incompatible:[/color]\r\n==================\r\n\r\nIn my testing, it seems to be incompatible with Wyrmstooth.\r\n\r\nIncompatible with mods that replace the mesh of the Dainty Sload. Retexture mods are completely compatible.\r\n\r\n\r\n==================\r\n[color=#00ff7f]Changelog:[/color]\r\n==================\r\n\r\n1/27/2013 - Initial Release\r\n\r\n\r\n==================\r\n[color=#00ff7f]Contact Details:[/color]\r\n==================\r\n\r\nIf you run into any bugs or have any suggestions/comments, then either PM me here or leave them in the comments section.\r\n\r\n\r\n==================\r\n[color=#00ff7f]Credits:[/color]\r\n==================\r\n\r\nA big thanks to:\r\nPROMETHEUS_ts for creating the sail mesh, the base texture of the sail, and just about everything else: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30494\r\nAnd InsanitySorrow for the ReadMe Generator this ReadMe is based on.
