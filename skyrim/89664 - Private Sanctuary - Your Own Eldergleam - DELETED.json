  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][b]Visually, Eldergleam Sanctuary is one of my favorite locales in Skyrim. So much so, I decided to make a private worldspace out of it so I can add any content I like with no risk of conflicts. This was no easy task however, which many of you may already know. [/b][/size][size=4][b]Despite the way it appears, Skyrim treats Eldergleam Sanctuary as an entire worldspace, not simply an interior cell like many caves are. Worldspaces are particularly difficult to duplicate in this manner, so I figured I'd share this for those who may have always wanted it\n<br />\n<br />Included is a simple spell to send you there. Once there, feel free to just wander around and relax. If you have followers with you they will use idle markers and sandbox like they would anywhere else. They will probably have to be summoned though. This worldspace is intentionally isolated, so Ai packages probably won't get them there automatically\n<br />\n<br />A[size=4][b]ny texture packs that affect Eldergleam Sanctuary will also reflect here[/b][/size]. The original Eldergleam Sanctuary is untouched. This mod is clean with no record overwrites\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to use this as you like[/b][/size]",
