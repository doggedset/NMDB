First off this is a tweak of ENB Tatsudoshi by Boris Vorontsov and Skyrim Visual Immersion III by Matso mod settings. All credits go to them, and you have to download their mod, from their site. I will not provide their files directly, only links to their site. I only provide my customized settings (that they provided for us users) for their mod. If they don\\'t even like having my customizations up, I will respect that and take this off.\r\nInstallation Guide\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe can do this in EASY 3 STEPS!\r\n\r\n1.)
