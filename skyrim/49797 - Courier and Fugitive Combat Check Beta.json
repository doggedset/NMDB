  "descriptionHtml": "Note: The USKP http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19/? now includes a fix for this problem according to this thread: http://afkmods.iguanadons.net/index.php?/topic/3636-mods-made-obsolete-by-unofficial-patches/\r<br />This mod should no longer be necessary. Thanks to all who downloaded and endorsed and to Mookeylama for pointing it out to me.\r<br />\r<br />I can&#39;t use a Crafting Table if a Dragon spotted me on my way to Dawnstar, but some random fugitive can force me into conversation while same Dragon IS BREATHING FIRE AT ME.\r<br />Hopefully this will fix the problem.\r<br />I added a GetCombatState == 0 (player) test to the initial dialogue of Couriers and Fugitives (the guys that hand you stolen items) to prevent them from initiating their dialogue while the player is fighting.\r<br />I am relatively new to modding Skyrim, so I am not certain if this will work. Additionally, since it blocks behavior that is rare (but incredibly annoying- maybe lethal) and impossible to force, I can&#39;t really test this. Hence, the BETA designation.\r<br />I would appreciate anyone willing to try this out and troubleshoot it with me.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83395/?tab=4&&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fcomments%2F%3Fmod_id%3D83395%26page%3D1%26sort%3DDESC%26pid%3D0%26thread_id%3D5560107&pUp=1]This mod[/url] by delgathar appears to do the same thing by disabling [i]all [/i]forced greets.",
