  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=5][b]Important Notes...[/b][/size]\r\n-THIS MOD REQUIRES DAWNGUARD DLC-\r\n\r\n-A kind modder has agreed to retexture the armor, keep an eye out for future updates-\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1366.photobucket.com/albums/r777/SkyrimForDaWin/cb257f58-7e34-41a7-b392-5b83db0160b0_zps8ec2fd14.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Description[/b][/size]\r\nThis is a heavy armor set (currently male only).\r\nThe armor is made up of Skyrim assets and includes some 100% new meshes and textures.\r\nSorry but there is no weight slider for this armor, it will default to the 100% weight.\r\n\r\nAs of V1.1.0 this mod includes 2 weapons, a 2 handed \"Berserker's Cleaver\" (2H Sword) and a 1 handed \"Berserker's War-Axe\" (1H Axe)\r\nThe Armor and Weapons included in this mod should now work with the SkyRe Reproccer (if it doesn't, let me know and Ill take a look at it again)\r\n\r\nCurrent Version Details.. (V1.1.0)\r\nThe armor is in the crafting list under \"Orcish\" and has the same stats as the \"Dawnguard Heavy Armor\" set (without the enchantments).\r\nThe names are as follows..\r\n- Iron Wight, ArmWraps\r\n- Iron Wight, Armor\r\n- Iron Wight, Armor (Alternate version)\r\n- Iron Wight, Boots\r\n- Iron Wight, Helmet\r\n\r\nThe weapons are in the crafting list under \"Orcish\" and are based on the \"Orcish Greatsword\" and \"Dawnguard Axe\" (without the enchantments).\r\nThe names are as follows..\r\n- Berserker's Cleaver\r\n- Berserker's War-Axe\r\n\r\nMisc. Details...\r\nFor anyone interested, the name \"Isen Wiht\" I made up using a list of viking name components (found on Wikipedia) and comes from the \"Elder Futhark\" language used by Vikings... it translates to \"Iron Wight\", which I feel fits the Viking Berserker theme of the armor quite well..\r\nThe Berserker is generally described as... Strong (like iron), Reckless and Immune to physical attacks & pain (like a wight).. And that is my reasoning behind the name.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to upload any screen shots of the mod.\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Installation[/b][/size]\r\nInstall with NMM\r\n - or - \r\nextract the folders in the 7z archive to your skyrim directory\r\n\r\nActivate \"Armor Of The Iron Wight.ESP\" in your load-order.\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Uninstallation[/b][/size]\r\nuse NMM to uninstall\r\n - or - \r\nDelete the following file(s) & folder(s)...\r\n.../skyrim/data/Armor Of The Iron Wight.ESP\r\n.../skyrim/data/meshes/SkyMeshes/Berserker/\r\n.../skyrim/data/textures/SkyTextures/Berserker/\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Credits[/b][/size]\r\nSkyrimForDaWin - Meshes & Textures.\r\nmonstrbox - Original Armor Concept & Feedback.\r\n\r\nBethesda for the Skyrim assets used to make the mod.\r\n\r\nI would also like to thank...\r\nReaper9111 - for tips and tricks for textures.\r\nNightasy - for his awesome tutorials for making armor in skyrim..
