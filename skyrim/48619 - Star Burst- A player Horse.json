  "descriptionHtml": "Star Burst is just a player horse, that is black and white like the Markarth ones. I tend to stay around whiterun so I made this quick little mod, and thought I would share.\r<br />\r<br />2.0 Now has an Imperial female, with a journal, dead next to her, by the pool. Just for a little immersion.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />A simple free Horse the player can find and take. She is left of Silent Moon Camp, where the lunar forge is. If you are heading from there to Labyrinthian, she is left toward a puddle with mud crabs, as if your turned to go to Dustman&#39;s Cairn.\r<br />\r<br />Works just like original horses, but if you use Convieniant horses, which I recommend, she works with that too, and her name will show up.\r<br />\r<br />If you prefer to change her name, there is a console command but unsure of it, but in CK, if you type in enchhorsesaddledblackandwhite, there will be two. just click on the star one, and edit the name.\r<br />\r<br />Only uses Skyrim Vanilla, and is a copy so the normal horses in Markarth will not be disturbed. So it should work with anything.\r<br />\r<br />She is essential as well. Just to let you know.",
