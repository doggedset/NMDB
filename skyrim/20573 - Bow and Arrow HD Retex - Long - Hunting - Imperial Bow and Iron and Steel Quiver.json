  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE 7/26/12:\r\nGlass Bow and Quiver added! 2 varieties to choose from\r\n1) Default Vanilla Style\r\n2) Morrowind Style - this version will have less shine but a mild glow to the glass parts, as well as added transparency in appropriate places\r\n\r\nIf you want the Morrowind-style armor seen in the pics, then you can download it here:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4859/?tab=2&navtag=/ajax/modimages/?user=0|:|id=4859]More Morrowind Like Glass Armor Texture by JESSETIN3[/url]\r\n\r\nLOW LEVEL BOW AND ARROW HD RETEX\r\n\r\nSmall mod that I wanted to do because I do enjoy playing with the more organic weapons in the game, iron, steel, wood, leather, etc. , and the originals I thought could stand to be improved. \r\n\r\nThis mod gives you  an HD retex of the following items:\r\n\r\nIron Quiver and Arrows\r\nSteel Quiver and Arrows\r\nWooden Bow\r\nHunting Bow\r\nImperial Bow (2 options – vanilla style and imperial style)\r\n\r\nDefault mod has all this and the Imperial Bow in the “vanilla style” which is a more traditional wood color similar to the Hunting Bow.  The Imperial Style I did just because it is an “Imperial” Bow and I thought it went better with the Imperial armors and clothing.\r\n\r\nAll diffuse, normal, specular, and environment maps have been changed.  The resolution of the diffuse and normal maps was upped to 2k x 2k or 2k x 1k for all except the wooden bow which I did at 1k x 1k.  The environment maps (only for the Hunting Bow and Steel Quiver) were kept small.\r\n\r\nInstallation: \r\n1)\tUse NMM\r\nor\r\n2)\tDrop the “data” folder into your Skyrim folder\r\n\r\nIf you want the alternative “Imperial” style Imperial Bow, which is a bit more rich and red in color, then either drop the “data” folder for that in your Skyrim folder, or use the NMM install which will simply install that over the default Imperial Bow.\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\nUse NMM \r\nOr \r\nDelete the installed files from \r\nData/textures/weapons/wooden\r\nData/textures/weapons/steel\r\nData/textures/weapons/iron\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nThe Nexus Staff and Community\r\nBethesda\r\nPhotoshop\r\nShutterstock for images of wood, metal, leather, etc.\r\nNifskope\r\nBellyache for teaching me Photoshop ;)\r\nAnd Thanks to regaz for his tutorial video on youtube as about 6 months ago I had never made a mod and that tutorial showed me how to get started ;)\r\n",
