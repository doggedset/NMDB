  "descriptionHtml": "[banner]\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s so many of us playing elves, worshiping the nine divines against our own wishes. Just to get rid of a disease or attain a few buffs. It&#39;s bad enough with all this talk of &#34;Nord tradition&#34; that we can&#39;t even worship the Nordic gods.\r<br />\r<br />[description]\r<br />\r<br />This mod currently aims to fix that by adding new shrines for a variety of elven religions as a modder&#39;s resource. There is also a mod that distributes these shrines among the game, giving shrines to NPC homes, adding new locations and custom buffs to each shrine. It is completely modular and you can pick and choose which aspects of the mod you would like to see.
