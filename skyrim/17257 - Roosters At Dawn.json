  "descriptionHtml": "A mod that adds a little more life to the village, farm, and city life of Skyrim by having some of the roosters crow at dawn when in appropriate areas.\r\n\r\nI wanted this mod to be as organic and believable as possible. I chose several different rooster sounds to add a little variation to the rooster crow each morning. Additionally the roosters will not crow at exactly the same time. A rooster crow will occur randomly at a time between 5:45 and 6:45 each morning (on default time scale). I limited the rooster crow to about one rooster per farm, village, and city so as not to overdo the sound effect.\r\n\r\nFor a video of this mod in action, please check out the below video in which this mod is featured. The clip about Roosters At Dawn begins at 1:33.\r\n\r\n[youtube]af6NATVU8jA[/youtube]\r\n\r\nI am open to suggestions, feed back, and bug reports.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
