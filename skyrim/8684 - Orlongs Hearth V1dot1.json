I have changed a lot of containers and completely removed the trophy room. If you don\\'t collect your things out of the displays, mannequins and containers before updating YOU WILL LOSE YOUR ITEMS.[/color]\r\nIf upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1, you don\\'t need to remove your stuff.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n========\r\nOrlong\\'s Hearth is a medium sized player home located in a fort just outside Riverwood. The home is suitable for just about any character. It comes complete with all the necessary ammenities including:\r\n- A personal smithing area with a forge, workbench, tanning rack and smelter. Also includes a wood pile for chopping.\r\n- A study in the tower with alchemy and enchanting stations.\r\n- A roaring hearth with cooking pots for crafting.\r\n- Working bookshelves as well as bookcase containers.\r\n- A personal armory and training room in the basement complete with mannequins, display cases and weapon racks and plaques. \r\n- Companion accomodations, for what it\\'s worth. Reported navmesh issues in the CK would seem to render this feature moot.\r\n- Organized, safe and labeled storage throughout the home, appropriately placed for balanced convenience and aesthetics.\r\n- Inventory sorters in the study, at the forge, in the armory, at the hearth and in the bedroom loft makes depositing and organizing loot a much faster process.\r\n- An alchemy garden with most common plants.\r\n\r\n[Youtube]KfZxaqj5VFQ[/Youtube]\r\nSkyrim runthrough video by Jellicle Hidan\r\n\r\nNew in version 1.0\r\n\r\nInventory sorters in the Hearthroom, loft, study, armory and forge. The trophy room has been dropped, and the armory and training room added the basement. The space previously occupied by the trophy room is now companion quarters. All containers are now safe. The ruined path into the fort via the north wall has been patched up. The only way in or out now is the main gate. See changelog below for full list of changes.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n==========\r\nTested on Skyrim version 1.4\r\n\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n=================\r\nInstall with the Nexus mod manager. \r\n\r\nFor manual installation, simply extract the contents of the archive to your skyrim directory, overwrite when prompted and activate the plugin from the launcher.\r\n\r\nUninstallation Instructions\r\n===================\r\nDelete the following:\r\n\r\nData/Orlong\\'s Hearth v1.esp\r\nData/meshes/cire992\r\nData/textures/cire992\r\n\r\nIncompatability\r\n===========\r\nAny mod that modifies exterior cell 4, -13 will have compatability issues with Orlong\\'s Hearth, other than that this mod should be compatible with just about everything.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n===========\r\nCurrent Bugs:\r\n- Fake un-interactive water in tower.
