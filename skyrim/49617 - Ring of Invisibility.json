I&#39;m with some college stuff to see so IF ANYONE CAN TEST THIS and send me a log with the results I&#39;ll be very appreciated. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thanks. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Hey, if you still reading check out this: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49833/?; Kinda funny :3\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />~Ladies and gentlemen there&#39;s the lastest version of the Ring of Invisibility now named The One Ring (people asked for it). Now you&#39;re always (truly always this time) invisible and should have no problem using it. \r<br />CREDITS:\r<br />THESE MESHES ARE A AWESOME MadNuttah  WORK. I didn&#39;t make any of them, I found &#39;em here (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35920/?). As in MadNuttah post he said that anyone could se it, here I go.\r<br />\r<br />P.S I don&#39;t like infinite files for download so if you have the old one download this new one. \r<br />I&#39;ll keep this way;\r<br />P.SÂ²: You&#39;re damn hard to detect when sneaking (believe)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Version 0.3:\r<br />The Ring is now almost-fully functional with followers; \r<br />Invisibility visual cast effect (Like when you use the spell on yourself (the purple thing)) removed (it&#39;s just too annoying in battle and/or getting items);\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 0.2:\r<br />-Minor bug fixes; (Every fancy log has it so mine does as well) \r<br />-Player is able to craft the ring now; (2 luna moth wings, 1 golden ingot and 1 sapphire)\r<br />-Player is ALWAYS invisible and if the effect is broken it will auto-restore;\r<br />Ok, now the ring is actually cool, try it&#33; It won&#39;t harm (the complete opposite) :)\r<br />I&#39;ll try to let the player visible while in combat next version (game won&#39;t let me",
