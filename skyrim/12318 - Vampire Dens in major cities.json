I love getting feedback![/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4][b]I must deeply apologize, for I will no longer be working on this mod.  If you would like to continue work on it yourself, please give me credit for the original mod and you may do whatever you please with it.  This is my official permission.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][size=4][b]If you are having trouble finding a den, please make sure to read all of the info below.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe images above are only screenshots of the Markarth and Solitude dens, and the outside location of the entrance to a few dens.  I do not want to give away the surprise of walking into the rest of the dens for the first time.  See the DESCRIPTION below for locations.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://img339.imageshack.us/img339/7901/vamppreview.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4][b]NEWS & IMPORTANT NOTES[/b][/size][/color]\r\n**The next few updates will add secret tunnel entrances to the dens from outside the city gates!  This will allow you to bypass the guards if you have a high bounty or are a very dangerous vampire.  (thanks to gyogyurormoma for the idea!)\r\n**NPC Vampire in Windhelm Den is friendly and will not attack you even if you are not a vampire.  She does not say anything important or do anything important yet.  She IS NOT set as essential so she will die if she loses all her health.  I did not set her as essential so you have the choice of keeping her or killing her if you want to take the den for yourself.\r\n**Take note that images of this mod that have been uploaded by users may contain altered objects in the dens and do not accurately represent what you will have when you install this mod.\r\n**As with all other mods,  ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR SAVES!!!\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/size][/color]\r\nThis is a work in progress.  It currently adds a Vampire Den to Solitude, Markarth, Riften, Whiterun, and Windhelm for the player to use as hideouts. Solitude\\'s Den is located between Proudspire Manor and Bryling\\'s house.  Markarth\\'s Den is in the corner to the right when entering the city.  Riften\\'s Den is in the southeast corner of Riften next to the boarded up gate (thanks to LoniMartin for the location suggestion), and Whiterun\\'s Den is in the graveyard to the right of The Hall of the Dead.  Just walk into the middle of the 4 gravestones and you will enter the den.  Windhelm\\'s Den is located against the wall near a stack of barrels and the big city gate in the south end of the city. Dens will be added to more cities as fast as I can complete them.  Please give me comments with feedback.  This mod is also available on the Steam Workshop under the same name.\r\n\r\nThe Vampire Dens are not technically player houses. They are not owned by you or anyone else.  They are not public areas either. You should be able to safely store items anywhere in the Vampire Dens. You will not be able to move your spouse there unless you use this mod http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11370. The Vampire Dens are not intended to be a full-fledged house or a one-stop-spot for all of your crafting needs. They will not be of much use to a warrior or other combat related character except for use of the bed and maybe target practice on the Captive in the cell since they are set as essential.\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4][b]KNOWN ISSUES AND TROUBLESHOOTING[/b][/size][/color]\r\nNone that are my fault, just that the mannequins may appear in the wrong spot in the room, become animated, or appear in an awkward position.  This is a known issue with all mannequins.  If you encounter a problem with the mannequins, simply exit the Vampire Den and then re-enter it.  That should fix the issue.  Leaving the den should also fix problems with the shield/weapon racks if anything isn\\'t working correctly.\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4][b]FEATURES[/b][/size][/color]\r\nCaptive NPC for feeding (they are set as essential so you cannot kill them by accident)\r\nNPC Vampire currently in one of the dens (not set as essential)\r\nMap marker outside for fast travel\r\nEnchanting table\r\nAlchemy table\r\nMannequin\r\nShield/Weapon rack\r\nBed\r\nApothecary satchels on alchemy table\r\nA black soul gem\r\nA couple bottles of blood (these will not satisfy your bloodthirst, they only restore health)\r\nVampire decor\r\nBlood splatters\r\nFully navmeshed\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4][b]UPDATING THE THALMOR CAPTIVE VERSION[/b][/size][/color]\r\nThere is currently not an updated version for the Thalmor Captive optional file.  The Thalmor Captive optional file is not simply an add-on to install over the main file, it is a complete main file on its own.  As of now, if you update your Vampire Dens mod to versions 0.2 or 0.21, when you had been previously playing with the Thalmor Captive version, your save will most likely become corrupt or have other issues because the game remembers there was a Thalmor Captive in the Solitude den but now you have uploaded a version that has the beggar-style captive and the game gets confused.  You will have to wait until I create and upload a new file specifically made to update from the Thalmor Captive version.  This will probably not happen until I get the rest of the city dens complete and that main file uploaded so I do not have to keep making a new Thalmor Captive version every time I add a new den.  I apologize for any inconveniences this may cause.  Message me if you have further questions.\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4][b]CHANGE LOG[/b][/size][/color]\r\nMarch 6 2012 - Initial release, v0.1\r\nMarch 6 2012 - Markarth Den addition, v0.2\r\nMarch 6 2012 - Added map marker and open coffin to Markarth Den, v0.21\r\nMarch 8 2012 - Riften Den addition, v0.3\r\nMarch 11 2012 - Whiterun Den addition, v0.4\r\nMarch 15 2012 - Windhelm Den addition, v0.5\r\nMarch 27 2012 - NPCs should no longer run away or report you to guards, v.0.51\r\nApril 4 2012 - Markarth Den Secret Entrance addition, v0.6\r\nApril 5 2012 - Fixed messed up Whiterun Den from 0.6 file, v0.61\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4][b]UPDATE PLANS[/b][/size][/color]\r\nSecret tunnel entrances to the dens from outside the city gates.\r\nCaptives won\\'t talk to you in a friendly manner\r\nAny other suggestions you guys can think of\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4][b]CREDITS[/b][/size][/color]\r\nBethesda for developing Skyrim and the CK\r\nLoniMartin for Riften Den location\r\ngyogyurormoma for secret entrance idea",
