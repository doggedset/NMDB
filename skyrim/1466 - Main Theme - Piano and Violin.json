  "descriptionHtml": "These two amazing musicians have given us something we all can enjoy at our Title screen.\r\n\r\nTaylor: http://www.youtube.com/user/ViolinTay\r\nLara: http://www.youtube.com/user/lara6683\r\nThis song\\'s video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAnQQcIncq0\r\n\r\nI downloaded their mp3, have raised the volume, added some reverb, and cut the start of the track to give us a bit more of a hello when we get to our title screen.\r\n\r\nThis is as loud as I could get it. For some reason, even at full volume in the settings, Skyrim lowers the volume on the title track.\r\n\r\nENJOY!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Due to other engagements (and other games) I do not plan on updating this or any of my other mods, indefinitely. At a later date, my interest in Skyrim may come back but until then, please do not leave impatient comments about updates or fixes.",
