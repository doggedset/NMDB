  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][b]Skyrim Arrow Overhaul Resources[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[i]\"Hello Modding-fellows. Since I am quitting Skyrim-Modding I wanted to release everything I have started working on as moddingresource to the Community. If somebody wants to continue this project feel free to do so. All models are finished. There is only scripting and CK work to be done.\"[/i]\n<br />[b][size=4][size=3]\n<br />Warning this Mod isn´t finished, not for gameplay, just for testing[/size][/size][size=4]\n<br />\n<br />Crafting:[/size][/b]\n<br />Workbench\n<br />[img width=776,height=483]http://fs5.directupload.net/images/180722/a5wteb4i.jpg[/img]\n<br />Material\n<br />[img width=764,height=446]http://fs1.directupload.net/images/180722/w543j3d4.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Arrow-Guid Translation:[/b]\n<br />\"﻿If you want to be a good archer, you should know that even the most precisely aimed arrow\n<br />won't help you if it bounces off of your foe's armor or pierces the boar but doesn't cause the animal to\n<br />bleed out before it reaches you. In this book I will teach you how to use different\n<br />kinds of arrowheads in the field. May it guarantee you a long life as an archer in our\n<br />Imperial Army.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Bodkin[/b]\n<br />[img width=905,height=510]http://fs5.directupload.net/images/180722/tjatnt3d.jpg[/img]\n<br />The Bodkin is considered one of the best armor-piercing tips in the market. Many well-armed\n<br />knights have believed themselves invincible to arrows, until the day a bodkin pierced\n<br />through their shield and into their armored chest. Because of their small tip, bodkins also\n<br />have excellent flight characteristics.\n<br />If your opponent is without armor, however, the tip is uneffective, as it only makes\n<br />small wounds. Hunters are reported to have tried their luck with this arrowhead, only to\n<br />have the deer they shot continue grazing, oblivious.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Broadhead[/b]\n<br />[img width=905,height=510]http://fs5.directupload.net/images/180722/kwmac484.jpg[/img]\n<br />The broadhead, with its wider tip, causes severe wounds and bleeding. The barbs make\n<br />removal of this arrow a very unpleasant affair, so much so that it's often advisable to\n<br />push the arrowhead out of the other side of the body. The wide tip makes it hard for this\n<br />arrow to pierce armor, so it's advisable to only use it against lightly armored opponents or for\n<br />hunting. Due to the heavy weight of the tip, these arrows also have a slightly shorter range.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Fire Arrow[/b]\n<br />[img]http://fs1.directupload.net/images/180722/i5wb4kvr.jpg[/img]﻿[img width=165,height=235]http://fs5.directupload.net/images/180722/qsa5bgnd.jpg[/img]\n<br />The tip of the fire arrow won't deal great damage, nor is it armor-piercing. However, it's\n<br />excellent against enemies with a inherently weakness for fire, and can also be used to light\n<br />up dark areas. Due to the weight of the flammable load, the arrow only has a very short\n<br />range.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Hammerhead[/b]\n<br />[img]http://fs1.directupload.net/images/180722/pz5q4bmm.jpg[/img]\n<br />The Hammerhead is an excellent tool for providing fire support in battle. Hitting an enemy\n<br />with this tip often causes dizziness, which allows your allies to overrun them. \n<br />The blunt tip also preserves the skin of your prey when hunting, and is advantageous against \n<br />the metal shells of Dwemer automatons. If you remain undetected when hitting an enemy with \n<br />this arrow, there is a chance of causing complete unconsciousness.\n<br />This arrow has a short range due to the extra weight, and because it is neither sharp-edged\n<br />nor pointed, it will only cause minor damage to your opponents.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Whistlehead[/b]\n<br />[img]http://fs5.directupload.net/images/180722/ymnemck4.jpg[/img]\n<br />The whistlehead is not intended for direct attacks on enemies, but for commanding allies\n<br />from a distance. It can also be used to panic unwary opponents and is perfectly suited to\n<br />confuse animals.\n<br />The low weight of the tip gives the arrow a long range.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Sicklehead[/b]\n<br />[img width=908,height=510]http://fs1.directupload.net/images/180722/8glpx7h5.jpg[/img]\n<br />The tip of the sicklehead has been developed to cause as much pain as possible to its\n<br />target. The wide crescent-shaped arrow causes excessive bleeding, but is almost completely\n<br />useless against enemies who are even slightly armored.\"\n<br />\n<br />[b]Quivers\n<br />[/b][img width=435,height=488]http://fs1.directupload.net/images/180722/rhoah5by.jpg[/img]\n<br />- The player has to equip an quiver to be able to carry arrows.\n<br />- The quiver limits the ammount of arrows the player can carry.\n<br />- The player can choose from Iron-Quiver to Daedric-Quiver (Iron has lowest carry-capacity while Daedric the highest)\n<br />- When the player removes his quivers, all of his arrows will be dropped infront of him.\n<br />\n<br />[b]MCM-Menu[/b]\n<br />[img width=753,height=427]http://fs5.directupload.net/images/180722/n2ou5koa.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />[b]Ogerboss[/b] - Scripting\n<br />[b]CaBal120[/b] - used some of his textures as base for mine.\n<br />[b]Alana12[/b] - Arrowtexture\n<br />[b]AlbiTheReal[/b] -  Furniture",
