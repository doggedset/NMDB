  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][center][color=#93c47d]~Bellerophon Castle~[/color][/center][/size][center][size=2](SSE Version Here: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18671?]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18671?[/url]ï»¿ )[/size]\n<br />\n<br />I still don't have SSE myself, hence the Oldrim upload. But that's okay. Here I've brought you a new home, late to the party but hopefully worth a look! \n<br />\n<br />Bellerophon Castle is a minor outpost overlooking the Karth Canyon next to Karthwasten; a manor for a nobleman before the Karthwasten Massacre instigated by Ulfric Stormcloak (or the Empire?). Having no Lord to tend to it, the Steward left the burial casket and key to the manor under a blossom tree. \n<br />While there are extravagant castles out there in the Nexus, I specialize in small, cozy estates! Here you will find a good starter-home with lower-class furniture, well-stocked, and ready to be moved into. \n<br />\n<br />The 3-story manor comes with:\n<br />- Full outdoor smithing set\n<br />- Enchanting and Alchemy stations with a few extra bells and whistles\n<br />- Several weapon racks (but not many) and 1 mannequin\n<br />- 1 master and 2 single custom beds\n<br />(I DO NOT RECALL WHERE I GOT THESE MESHES FROM, PLEASE COMMENT IF YOU KNOW WHOM THESE BELONG TO)\n<br />Primarily this castle serves into my personal aesthetics, and is around the size of Breezehome as far as utilities - but it is fortified!\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc]-Requires Dawnguard and Dragonborn-\n<br />(No hearthfire added, as I tend to use MHIYH or similar mods)[/color]\n<br />\n<br />I hope you enjoy, and have a wonderful season unending![/center]",
