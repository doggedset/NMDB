  "summary": "Revised body of the vanilla dwarven cuirass for Favored Soul & Sundracon bodies. \r\n-Male Only-",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=28][color=orange]Exposed Dwarven Cuirass[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nContinuing the Exposed Armors style of flaunt it, tease it, not hide it... you will find the usual goodness with a modified dwarven armor set that retains the majority metal without that silly skirt making everything sweat inside........ well, you can see everything sweat now if you want ;)\r\n\r\n[color=brown]<><> Craftable under the \\'Dwarven\\' category <><>[/color]\r\n\r\nBoth FS & Sundracon versions are included in the single file; the Sundracon version as usual has a \\'S\\' denoted at the end of the name.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Be sure to verify the data files from your Skyrim Launcher & doublecheck that the mod is loaded. This is a stand-alone mod and will not replace the vanilla file. I advise setting the load order of my mods up with other armor mods, or at least not the very last ones on the list.\r\n\r\n**This mod is integrated with the Favored Soul and Sundracon bodies, if you have a different body installed the mesh will likely force your body into the mod\\'s mold, among any other potential issues.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use for other projects &/or improve upon this mesh.\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nChris57, Sundracon & Favored Soul\\'s male body meshes\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488\r\n\r\nMale char in screenshot is a variant of Urshi\\'s companion mod Hot Male Housecarls\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17163\r\n\r\nHair is from ApachiiSkyHair (also included in the Hot Male Housecarls mod)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168",
