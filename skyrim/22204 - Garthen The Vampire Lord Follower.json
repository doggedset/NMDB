  "descriptionHtml": "Garthen was not always a vampire he used to be an adventurer who traveled all over Tamriel until he stumbled upon a coven of vampires he fought them and unfortunately contracted Sanguinare Vampiris which later turn him into a Vampire. Due to the social exclusion of being a Vampire Garthen trekked allover skyrim trying to find more of his own when one day he stumbled upon Castle Volkihar. Lord Harkon saw great potential in him so he bestowed Garthen with the gift of the Vampire Lord. Unfortunately Garthen couldn\\'t control himself when in Lord form so he is unable to change back he also didn\\'t like Harkon\\'s ideas so he left but due to his permanent Form he cannot join the normal civilians of Skyrim but due to extensive research and practise he is able to appear normal to the denizens of Skyrim but not to vampires or people of great power. He has decided to mingle with the inhabitants of Whiterun where he awaits someone worthy of his company.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds Garthen The Vampire Lord To Whiterun near the shrine of Talos.\r\nDue to this being my 2nd mod Garthen now has the majority of the Vampire Lords spells the spells he has currently are:\r\nDrain Life\r\nSummon Gargoyle\r\n\r\nTo Do List\r\nMove him to the Ancestral Glade\r\nEnable Garthen to be a Nord Vampire out of combat and transform into the Vampire Lord when in combat (Awaiting a reply from Praveen)\r\n\r\n\r\nRequries Dawnguard\r\n",
