  "summary": "Redecorates the thieves guild to reflect the wealth they&#39;ve accumulated as you finish the reputation quests.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Why I made this mod:\r<br />I was annoyed with how little the thieves guild improves despite the other members claims. Before, a few beds and tables got switched out for nicer ones, and a few crappy cabinets were added. The overall result was kind of lame. Now the Ragged Flagon and Thieves Guild Headquarters lighting, furniture, containers, and loot will improve a bit more with each reputation question completed. All in a 100% lore friendly manner. Two new fences are also available, one will be available from the start, Ra&#39;skaar a Khajit skooma vendor, can be found in the ragged flagon. The other will eventually set up shop in a new area in the flagon.\r<br />\r<br />Not only did I improve the final result of the guild, but it also starts off poorer than before, littered with empty bottles, rats, and dirt. They will also be automatically cleaned up as you complete the quests. \r<br />\r<br />I grew tired of travelling through the cistern to turn in jobs to Delvin and Vex, so I made a shortcut at the back of the Flagon.\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s also a small room the player can claim in the cistern, this is the only room with safe storage, all the other containers respawn. The room will also improve as you complete the quests, adding display stuff and items for convenience.\r<br />\r<br />Important notes:\r<br />Since people seem to be worried about the shelves of lockboxes is too much, I should mention that it&#39;s the new training area, and each box has the same loot lists as a small urn. They are there for training lockpicking mainly.\r<br />None of the containers are for player use in either cell, excluding the ones in the player room.\r<br />The mod has already been cleaned with Tes5edit.\r<br />Works fine even if you&#39;ve already completed the TG quest line.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Regular method you use.\r<br />\r<br />Compatible with:\r<br />Localized thieves guild jobs\r<br />Riften thief edition\r<br />Thieves Guild Requirements - No Auto Quest Start Brynjolf\r<br />\r<br />Will conflict with mods that affect the Thieves Guild headquarters or the Ragged Flagon.\r<br />(I use 120+ mods and have had no conflicts when testing.)\r<br />\r<br />Endorse it if you like it&#33; It pleases me.\r<br />",
