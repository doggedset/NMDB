She never knew her father as she was growing up, and for the longest time, all she could remember about him is that he was big and strong. Her mother told her stories of her father. Stories about how great a warrior he was, tales of his battles, and how he saved her. She might not have known her father well, but he was her idol, and she wanted to grow up to be an adventurer like him. At the age of 6, Tiffany started to learn how to use a bow, and how to hunt. On her 15th birthday, a group of bandits raided the house Tiffany lived in, burning it to the ground. Tiffany managed to escape, but her mother did not. After this event, Tiffany was forced to move to Nightgate Inn, and stay there. After a few weeks, she met her father again, for the first time, in what seemed like ever. Her father taught her more of combat, gave her some new clothing, and her mother\\'s bow. Her father then disappeared again. Now Tiffany waits at Nightgate Inn, for someone to travel with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~ Updates ~~~\r\nVersion 1.00: Created, tested a bit, and uploaded.\r\nVersion 1.05: Added Face Gen Data, AI Package, Changed Perks.\r\n\r\n~~~ Credits ~~~\r\ndimon99 for UNP\r\nradioragae for Oblivion Hair Packs\r\nmrLenski for Coverwomen\r\nnatilde for making me try to make a female follower with custom hairs (Even though I didn\\'t follow their guide)\r\nMy Boyfriend",
