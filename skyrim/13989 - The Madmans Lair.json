  "descriptionHtml": "A bizarre, unorthodox dungeon unlike anything you\\'ve ever seen\r\n\r\nFormerly part of the Sheogorath Shout/Call of Madness mod, the dungeon has now been moved\r\n\r\nThe entrance can be found near Anise\\'s cabin, at the point on the map screenshot\r\n\r\nAlso available on the Steam Workshop - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=19436\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n- Enemies\\' hats stay hovering over where their heads used to be when they are decapitated\r\n- May run into compatibility problems if you have other dungeon mods loaded, or mods like Dovahkiin\\'s Hideout. This is a common problem with player-created dungeons, and it\\'s a good idea to only have a few running at any time",
