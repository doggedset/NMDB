  "descriptionHtml": "This increases the attack and warn range of mammoths, and makes them more aggressive. This mod does not change any other attributes, such as health or attack speed; it merely makes them appear slightly high. As with all my mods, there is a screenshot competition. Get five great screenshots of the mod in action, and you will be added to the credits. As ever, enjoy! -Previous mod: Greater Dragons of Skyrim - -Future mod: Crabby Skyrim-",
