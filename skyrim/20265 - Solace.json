  "descriptionHtml": "For Update 1.1 make sure you gather all your stuff from the home before you upgrade because I\\'ve gotten word that it will all disappear. In future updates I will handle the procedure differently.\r\n\r\nAfter making homes for New Vegas & Fallout 3 (Solace & Liberty Loft among others) I decided it was time to take a dive into the fantasy home-building world of Skyrim. Hope you guys enjoy the mod as much as I enjoyed making it.\r\n\r\nThis mod was developed for the Underground Homes Challenge over at SKYRE.\r\nhttp://www.skyrimrealestate.com/forum/index.php?board=18.0\r\n\r\n[youtube]cKO1SleYWPg[/youtube] [youtube]zd2_B2HZOLU[/youtube]\r\nThanks to Brodual & MachinimaRealm for the vids, I appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI was reading through some of the Elder Scrolls lore and this home was made as a result. The story of the place is centered around the Rourken Clan, their exile, and their descendants. (Some of which, from my fiction, settled in Skyrim). This lore will be added with future updates via books and etc.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n==========\r\n- It\\'s a large, very detailed home for the Dovahkiin.\r\n\r\n- The lift is located in the Reach near Old Hroldan. There is also an entrance to Blackreach.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n- Custom paintings (Thanks to DeviantArt)\r\n\r\n- A unique treasure room (the stairs to get there require an attunement sphere, which is on the night stand near the bed.) The gold ingot stacks respawn.\r\n\r\n- Large, open entrance with some unique features.\r\n\r\n- Big armory with a lot of detail. (The ingot stacks respawn).\r\n\r\n- Magical tower for enchanting/alchemy. (The ingredient box on the ground, potion crate on floor, enchanted dwemer chest, and enchanted satchel all respawn.)\r\n\r\n- Standing stones scattered throughout.\r\n\r\n- Unique library with Dragon Priest mask busts.\r\n\r\n- Kitchen (WIP) The mead cases, food crates/baskets, and wine case respawn.\r\n\r\n- Entrance (with mapmarker) to Blackreach.\r\n\r\nRecommended\r\n==============\r\n- SuperB ENB\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11318\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n======\r\n1. Use NMM to install.\r\nor\r\n2. Manually install contents of archive in Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\n- You will get some lag around the statues near the lift. I think it\\'s due to too many portals and I will address it in the future.\r\n\r\n- There might be some light flickering.\r\n\r\nThanks/Credits\r\n==============\r\n- Eldiabs for his resource.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11618\r\n\r\n- Oaristys for the awesome resource pack.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16525\r\n\r\n- Blary for potion,food,books, and other resources.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2250922\r\n\r\n- InsanitySorrow for soap.\r\nhttp://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1182-soap-resource/\r\n\r\n- badgremlin for the wonderful tanks and jars.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/609747\r\n\r\n- Tonynarko67 for the Dwemer statue.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16446\r\n\r\n- ArtsyCat for the pillow resource.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10766\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\nv1.1\r\nAdded Navmesh, added missing shelf, fixed ingot stacks that weren\\'t respawning.\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\nInitial Release\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nCreation Kit",
