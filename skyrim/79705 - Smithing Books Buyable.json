  "summary": "You need now a Book for each peace of Armor. Without Book, no smithing.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The orginal mod http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60214/? made by Diatla.\r<br />\r<br />You need for each Armor peace a book exept jewelry and the book [u]must be [/u]in your inventory to craft this Armor or weapon.\r<br />The books are nearly in each town and there will be no merchant with all books. Find the right merchant for the Armor you are looking.\r<br />Otherwise it would be to easy.:b\r<br />One more thing, when you have the books for hide and leather in your inventory, than you can craft the bandit armor. For each peace you need two books ( say crafting book hide helmet + crafting book leather helmet for bandit helmet ).\r<br />For one or an other could be the prices a little high. I made them for my own and it is ok for me. When the speakcraft is high enough they will be cheaper. When someone will make an mcm menu for this mod, go for it. I have no experince to create an mcm menu.\r<br />\r<br />You must have all the DLCs and USLEEP for the latest version to work.",
