I couldn\\'t resist replacing these voices since it was so easy! \r\n All Credit goes to Sounds Resource and Mushroom Kingdom for the voices.\r\n As I complete and test new voices, they will be added here.\r\n Sadly, my biggest regret is not being able to obtain the infamous \\\"Hi, I\\'m Daisy\\\" sound. I have scoured the 4 corners of the web too. If I ever find it, I will put it in ASAP.\r\n\r\nHOW TO INSTALL: stick the Sounds folder in your Data folder. Yes, its that easy\r\n\r\nDone so far:\r\nFlame Atronach- Princess Peach\r\nBears- Captain Falcon\r\nHagraven- Princess Daisy\r\nWispmother- Princess Rosalina\r\nTroll- Wario\r\nWolf- Wolf (Star Fox)",
