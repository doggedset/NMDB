  "descriptionHtml": "First run through I went Stormcloak. I took over cities and killed in the name of Ulfric. Well one thing that annoyed me was that the banners on cities didn\\'t change. This mod will change city banners to Stormcloak banners. Now most banners changed right over, but some had to be moved slightly to prevent major clipping, but they\\'re still in the general area of where they were.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\nWorks with mods that add trees to Whiterum.\r\nShould work with city lights, tho I have not tested it.\r\nNot sure if it works with Skyrim-Open Cities.\r\n\r\nIncompatibilities\r\nPossibly Whiterun Rebuild, But I was testing it before I took over Whiterun, so it could have been that fact)\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs/incompatibilities if/when you find them.\r\n\r\nThis should work with NMM, if there\\'s any problems, please explain them and how I can fix it.\r\n\r\nI plan on doing the cities for both Imperial and stormcloak as well, so keep a lookout for that.\r\n",
