  "summary": "Armor mod I made consisting of three parts, gauntlets, a martial arts looking outfit and footwraps.\r\nPeople looking to play as an unarmed character might get a bit more enjoyment out of this.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A little update: I just added a no symbol/multicolor version of the outfit.\r\n\r\nYou will need to go into the files and rename the color you want and make it the default .dds (dragonborngarb.dds)\r\n\r\nThis mod is based on three different items: \r\n\r\n\r\nThe kanji in the back is for \\\"dragon\\\" on top and \\\"born\\\" below that, I don\\'t know if that makes sense but it seemed like a good idea.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I added a version with the skyrim dragon symbol for those of you who are interested in the lore aspect of the game.\r\n\r\nthe garb is 20001000 (that\\'s the clothes)\r\nthe gauntlets are 20001005\r\nthe footwraps are 0003CA00\r\n\r\nNote that the first two numbers in the code might be different for you.\r\nA sure fire way of finding them is by typing \\\"help bushido 0\\\" for the gloves and \\\"help garb 0\\\" this should display the id code in your Skyrim install.\r\n\r\nThe Dragonborn Garb is a standalone retexture of the prisoner clothes,\r\nbut I adjusted a few things, now its considered light armor, it is upgradable\r\nand it is craftable, once at the forge it is under misc. It also has 53 armor \r\nrating, might seem like a lot but these are meant for unarmed combat.\r\n\r\nThe Bushido Gauntlets is also a standalone retexture.  They are also upgradable\r\nand craftable, they are at the forge under Daedric, I tried to change this but\r\nI sort of gave up on that.  They can be obtiained through the console. These\r\nhave an armor rating of 17.\r\n\r\nAnd the last is the footwraps, these are not standalone but I don\\'t imagine it\r\nmatters.  They are meant to be optional for the outfit and they don\\'t have any rating\r\nbut they can be enchanted.  These you can either get through console or find them\r\nin the world. \r\n\r\nAll these items can be found through the console command.\r\n\r\n",
