  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a small mod I made which adds two torches by the big table in the middle of the big room in Sky Haven Temple. It bothered me that it was so dark by the table, so I just made this little mod, briefly. \r\n\r\nI won\\'t update this mod since I don\\'t have the Creation Kit installed anymore and I\\'m also lazy. I hope somebody else will make an improved version of this mod with more lights. ",
