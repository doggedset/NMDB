  "modName": "Muddy Bloody and Retexture vanilla armors",
  "summary": " This mod is in some ways an extension of my racemenu plugin mud and blood . Many of the early armors in game were retextured with that in mind but became something more. Guard armors and steel are I would say the centerpiece . Both sexes were done as well as most of the shields .",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff7700][size=4]3/24/2017  Hot Fix added for male Riften armor 2k , still need other file  . Overwrite when asked fixes crash when in carriage to Riften .  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][color=#ff7700][size=4] 3/23/2017  Fixed possible ctd issues I apologize for any inconvenience . [/size][/color][color=#cc0000]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#900000][size=4]Lets just get installation out of the way . This is a simple texture replacer use NMM or Mod organizer overwrite if prompted.\r<br />Chapter 1 does not need dlc  future chapters will .[/size][/color] [color=#00ff00]Last four pictures are SSE more to come when I do SSE page .[/color]\r<br />[/color][color=#cc0000][size=5] \r<br />[/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4][size=3]  When I started this it was meant only to finish up forsworn armors for male in mud and blood mod I did . Well they are done and a can be gotten here . This thing started becoming a monster  because I saw the interaction with mods that use vanilla textures . [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75861][u][color=#0066cc]The Book of UUNP Bodyslide - UNP - Sevenbase[/color][/u][/url]  Some pictures show versions of these armors  but are representative of vanilla armors just the same also if any of the armors were in this mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68028][u][color=#0066cc]UNP Spice Gear Collection[/color][/u][/url] Female hold armor pics . \r<br />  The file naming was done with chapter tag because I plan on doing more armors in the future . Here is a list of ones that are done according to file name .\r<br />\r<br />   Forsworn\r<br />   Stormcloak ( Hold/Guard ) [color=#00ff00]s[/color]\r<br />   Imperial [color=#00ff00]s[/color]\r<br />   Steel [color=#00ff00]s[/color]\r<br />   Nordic Plate\r<br />   Iron [color=#00ff00]s[/color]\r<br />   Elven\r<br />   Studded \r<br />   [color=#00ff00][size=2]The little green &#34; s &#34;  is shields  .\r<br />  [/size][/color][color=#ffffff][size=2]Normals were done for some of the armors and shields to give wet look and texture . The package includes the normals of all armors listed because that is how it was tested and also to insure that there is no incompatability . Almost all body armors were resized to 2k on the diffuse side . Gloves, boots , and helmets were done in 1k .  This is representative of the vamilla build of 1k for body 512 for everything else.\r<br />\r<br /> Chapter2 will more than likely be the rest of hide type armors and any updates and changes and also dlc armors  ( reason for requirement ).\r<br />\r<br />  This works on sse and page will be made later .\r<br />\r<br /> Credits :\r<br /> Paintshop pro\r<br /> Bethesda\r<br /> daz3d brushes \r<br /> Deviant art : brushes and chainmail texture Imperial  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> [/size][/color][color=#00ff00][size=2]   [/size][/color][color=#00ff00][size=4]Permission : Open I only ask for credit . \r<br />\r<br />   Special Request anyone who want to put this up for ps4 contact me apparently I am very CK illiterate even with good instructions . This I only ask because my sons  18 and 20 respectively are jealous with what Skyrim looks like on my pc And I would like to give them this small taste .   \r<br />\r<br />  Thank you 0nelazybattlemaga ( SSE Pics ), Alpineyj , Sagittariusmoon  , and Mrtroublemaker  for testing and encouragement as I got deeper into this project .[/size][/color][/size][/color]",
