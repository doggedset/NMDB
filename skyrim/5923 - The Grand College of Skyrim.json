  "descriptionHtml": "This is a new mod i am currently working on, I think skyrim for mages gets boring as thier isnt enough to do so i plan to add a hell of alot of content. Main goal is a secret lost college of skyrim which will contain everything a mage needs along with all new npc\\'s and i will be adding quests all mage orientated as time goes on.\r\n\r\n-planned content-\r\n-Grand college of skyrim\r\n-npc\\'s and quests within the college\r\n-The great catacombs-Will be located inside the college itself and will be protected by a magical door, A quest will needed to be completed to access it. (will feature a variety of creatures and several chambers with dragons to test your skills in battle)\r\n-Secret Garden-You will find every kind of ingrediant you need here\r\n-The Hall of Arch-mages- (Dedicated the the 5 ancient arch-mages of the college) Each arch mage specialized in a different spell spec (destruction etc) A 6th spot will be left empty till you reach lvl 50 at which point a secret Quest will occur. \r\n\r\nWill update within a few weeks with my progress.
