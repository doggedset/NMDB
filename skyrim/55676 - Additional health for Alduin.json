  "descriptionHtml": "It&#39;s a really simple mod that adds 4000 health points to Alduin so you can fight with him longer. No additional overpowered spells and similar things included. Just more health. It should be compatibile with everything. I tested it with Deadly Dragons and Dragon Combat Overhaul at the same time, works perfectly. But if you have some problems with other mods, please leave a comment.\r<br />\r<br />Place it as low in your load order as you can, I don&#39;t think there will be a big difference, but just to be sure place it low.",
