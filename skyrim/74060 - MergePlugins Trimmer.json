Back this up before you try for the first time if you&#39;re unsure.\r<br />The only profile affected is the one currently selected in Mod Organizer.\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]I think this functionality will be added to Merge Plugins soon... until then, I hope this helps. Happy modding&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[b]REQUIREMENTS[/b]\r<br />- .NET Framework 3.5 or higher\r<br />- [b]Mod Organizer[/b]\r<br />- [b]Merge Plugins standalone[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]INSTALLATION[/size]\r<br />1. Activate this &#39;mod&#39; in Mod Organizer. [size=1](This will not effect your game in any way but if not activated MO will not execute the program correctly.)\r<br />[/size]\r<br />2. Click on the data tab on the right hand panel and scroll down the list to find &#39;trimmer.exe&#39;\r<br />\r<br />3. Right-click on &#39;trimmer.exe&#39; and select &#39;Add as Executable&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />4. You should now be able to run it as you would any other executable.\r<br />\r<br />[b]\r<br />NOTES\r<br />[/b][size=1]If you see the &#39;This application could not be started&#39; message it probably means you have not activated this mod.\r<br />The textures folder is there so Mod Organizer won&#39;t say it&#39;s not a mod, which technically it isn&#39;t but that&#39;s ok.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][u][b]This program is not an official tool of Mod Organizer or Merge Plugins. Please to not direct any support questions to them.[/b][/u]",
