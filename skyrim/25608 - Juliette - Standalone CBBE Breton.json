  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red]***********************************************************\r<br />I AM NOT ACTIVELY MODDING SKYRIM AT THE MOMENT.\r<br />\r<br />Anything I created is free for use and derivitive work. None of mods were complete and I apologize that some of them were never finished. If someone wants to pick up where I left off, they are welcome to use my work by either uploading their own mod or I can give them access to that mod&#39;s page. \r<br />\r<br />My custom work will continue as planned. \r<br />\r<br />Thanks everyone for your support and hopefully I will come back soon. But alas, I have a seasonal job and until April 15th, I don&#39;t know how much time I will have, or when I do have time, if I&#39;ll want to return to skyrim modding.\r<br />*********************************************************** [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/21AOk.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />She is located in the main part of Dragonsreach, normally stuffing her face&#33; She is marked essential and you can also marry her.\r<br />\r<br />Min Level: 10 Max Level: 90\r<br />Health: 240 Magicka: 150 Stamina: [/b]295\r<br />Class: Combat Ranger\r<br />Best Skills: One Handed, Two Handed, Block, Archery, Light Armor, Sneak\r<br />Inventory: Hide Shield, Steel Mace, Hunting Bow, 100 Steel Arrows\r<br />Spells: Healing, Fast Healing\r<br />Perks: Armsman (3), Overdraw (3), Lightfoot, Unhindered, Paralyzing Strike, Muffled Movement, Agile Defender (3), Custom Fit, Matching Set, Critical Shot, Hunters Discipline, Ranger\r<br />\r<br />Thank you Hodilton for the video&#33;&#33; (Juliette is featured around 1:11):\r<br />[youtube]qjGDmRp7-HY[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />And another big thank you to Insane0hFlex:\r<br />[youtube]xO96h_UE1A8[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Use NMM, or merge the Data folder included with the one located in your skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation: Deactivate and delete Juliette.esp and the following folders in skyrim/data/\r<br />meshes/actors/character/colette (I was going to name her Colette but then I rememebered there was one in the vanilla game, derp&#33;)\r<br />meshes/actors/character/facegendata/facegeom/juliette.esp\r<br />textures/actors/character/colette\r<br />meshes/actors/character/facegendata/facetint/juliette.esp\r<br />\r<br />Credits: \r<br />\r<br />NOTE: These mods are not required for Juliette to look like she does in the screenshots, but I do ask that if you really like me that you&#39;ll visit these mods pages and consider DLing and endorsing, or simply letting the author know you appreciate their work&#33; They are the magic behind Juliette, not me&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Coverwomen Brows - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563\r<br />Oblivion Hair - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22598\r<br />ZZjays AMAZING new &#34;Women of Skyrim&#34; face texture - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25588\r<br />Navetsea Skin textures - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6554\r<br />Better Freckles - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4502\r<br />Caliente for CBBE - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r<br />The Eyes of Beauty - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722 \r<br />\r<br />Notes: I made this girl for myself after trying out zzjay&#39;s face texture this morning. Juliette&#39;s not going to have all the body options/patches my other followers do unless I&#39;m asked specifically to release them, she was just for fun. Thus the lackluster description. Also, I use the UNP body, but after doing CBBE patches for my other followers, I decided I wanted a girl in my game to have CBBE, it really makes her stand out&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Every DL, Endorsement and Comment means the world to me&#33; Thank you&#33; ",
