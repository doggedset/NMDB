  "descriptionHtml": "Thank you all for taking time to download and endorsing this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=#00ffff]What is this mod[/color][/heading]\r<br />Ever wanted to sleep next to your housecarl follower?  When you tell her to sleep, they would get up when you try to sleep next to her?\r<br />\r<br />This mod will allow all housecarls from the game to use the bed you owned for their sleep cycle.  Once they are in sleep, you can select the sleep option.  \r<br />\r<br />At the moment, you&#39;ll need to wait until they do go sleep to join them.  If you tell them to sleep, you won&#39;t be able to select the sleep option since they&#39;ll just get up.\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=#00ffff]How[/color][/heading]\r<br />All player owned bed&#39;s ownership faction has been changed from PlayerBedOwership to PlayerFaction which all housecarls are member of.  Housecarls only used a bed with the PlayerHousecarlFaction ownership, so they would now use both with this mod.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s the list of beds this mod has changed:\r<br />[list][*][size=2]Whiterun Breezehome and Jorrvaskr basement[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Markarth Vlindrehall[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Windhelm Hjerim[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Winterhold Arch-mage&#39;s Quarters[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Solitude Proudspire Manor[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Riften Honeyside[/size]\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[heading][color=#00ffff]Sleep cycle[/color][/heading]\r<br />If you use UFO, just tell your housecarl followers to &#34;RELAX&#34;.  They&#39;ll go through the idle cycle for the current game time.  Wait until the Housecarl&#39;s sleep cycle that usually starts 8pm, or you can type &#34;set gamehour to 20&#34; from the game console.\r<br />If you don&#39;t use any follower mod, take your housecarl follower to their designated home.  Tell them depart, and they will start the idle cycle.\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=#00ffff]3rd pillow[/color][/heading]\r<br />If you have more than one housecarl with you, they sometimes use the bed simultaneously and you would be left out. I added a 3rd pillow to the beds this mod has changed to allow you to sleep in between 2 followers.  To use the 3rd pillow, move your view to the foot of the bed to find the &#34;Sleep Stone bed&#34; indicator.  Only the Whiterun Breezehome does not have this 3rd pillow option.",
