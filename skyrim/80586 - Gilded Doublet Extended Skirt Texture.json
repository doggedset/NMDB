  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][b]GILDED DOUBLET EXTENDED SKIRT\r<br />[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />A very simple texture change which extends the dress portion of the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44567/?]Gilded Doublet mod by Ellise[/url] to be longer and more dress-like. Just my first kick at doing a texture edit and also at uploading a (very minor) mod. \r<br />\r<br />THIS IS NOT A STANDALONE VERSION. This contains no .esp and only contains the replacement textures. Requires the original Gilded Doublet [u]six-colour colourpack[/u] version. \r<br />\r<br />[u][b]INSTALLATION[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Use a mod manager of your choice, or just copy the relevant files over the existing Gilded Doublet files in your data directory. This must be installed AFTER the original Gilded Doublet mod, obviously. \r<br />\r<br />[u][b]UNINSTALLATION\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u]If you used a mod manager, it should uninstall cleanly. If you copied the files over manually, you will need to manually copy the original Gilded Doublet colour pack textures files back into the same folder in order to restore them. \r<br />\r<br />[u][b]COMPATIBILITY[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />This is purely a texture replacer and should conflict with nothing. \r<br />\r<br />[u][b]MODS USED IN SCREENSHOT(S)[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />- Gilded Doublet (of course)\r<br />- Seranaholic v 1.5 \r<br />- Apachii Sky Hair Wigs\r<br />- Imaginator (No ENB)\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]PERMISSIONS\r<br />[/b][/u][b]\r<br />[/b]You are free to use this mod in any way in a mod of your own and do not need to ask my permission, but as the mod is purely an edit of Ellise&#39;s original please ask her permission for the use of the original Gilded Doublet. \r<br />\r<br />If you do use this mod, please do credit me. Thanks. [b]\r<br />[/b]\r<br />[u][b]CREDITS[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Many thanks to Ellise for the original Gilded Doublet set (and her kind permission to make this a standalone .esp if I choose to later) and to the various tutorial authors w/r/t texture editing and mod creation.
