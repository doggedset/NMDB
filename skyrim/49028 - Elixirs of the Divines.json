  "descriptionHtml": "This is the first mod I&#39;ve uploaded to Nexus, but not the first I&#39;ve made, I usually just make small tweaks and stuff :x\r<br />\r<br />Anyway, I thought this would be a cool idea to share with people, so here it is&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Elixirs of the Divines&#33;\r<br />\r<br />They&#39;re pretty much the effects of the shrines, just with a shorter duration and portable.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s the items needed to craft it, and there&#39;s a note underneath about how to get the energies.\r<br />\r<br />Akatosh – Magicka Regen +10% for 60 minutes (3600 seconds).
