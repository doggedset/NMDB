  "descriptionHtml": "Adds the missing bound weapon types and enhances the enchantment to make them a bit more useful at higher levels. \r\n\r\nWeapons are balanced at the same level as the current bound weapons. Adds Bound Dagger, Mace, War Axe, Claymore and Warhammer spells and tomes. Also adds a Bound Pick for miners (Note: the War Axe will also chop fire wood). \r\n\r\nTomes are added to the leveled lists so they will appear anywhere spell tomes of the appropriate level are available. One-handed weapons are Novice and Two-handed are Apprentice. \r\n\r\nIf you have Oblivion Binding, it will add a chance to cause undead to explode on 'death' in the same way as Dawnbreaker. \r\n\r\n3 Apprentice level spells (and tomes) now provide 1-handed weapons and a Bound Shield. The shield has the same stats as a Daedric Shield and provides a basic 15% fire resistance. With Augmented xxxx perks, the appropriate resistance is increased by 15% for each perk (so max 45% fire, 30% frost and 30% shock). The Soul Binding perk gives 15% poison and disease resistance and Oblivion Binding gives 15% magic resistance. \r\n\r\n(Note: to make the Bound Shield work, the spells will only equip in the right hand. The spell tomes for these will only be for sale when your Conjuration gets close to 25). \r\n\r\n**Updates** \r\nv2.2 - Fixed the issue with the weapon and shield spells leaving your left hand empty after the spell expires. I have also removed the fire / frost / shock damage from these bound weapons to balance them against my new fire / frost / shock bound weapons. \r\nv2.1 - Fixed the random disappearing Bound Shield bug \r\nv2.0 - After much messing about, I have finally(!) managed a functional work around for Bound Shields that I am happy with. 3 new spells added at Apprentice level to introduce bound shields \r\nv1.3 - Adjusted the flames mesh on the mace and warhammer to fit better \r\nv1.2 - Corrected a bug with the two-handed weapons and spell descriptions \r\nv1.1 - Added Bound Pickaxe and modified the one-handed axe to work on woodcutting blocks. Spell tome for Bound Pickaxe added to spell tome sellers",
