  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=6][b]Artillery - Death From Afar[/b][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][size=5]Rain death upon your enemies with unrelenting barrages of catapult fire, fireballs and arrow storms. Simply mark your target with your Marker Arrows, use the \\'Launch Barrage\\' power and watch the chaos begin.[/size][/center]\r\n\r\n[center]This mod aims to add numerous types of artillery to Skyrim whilst remaining as true to lore as possible. Current Artillery forms:[/center]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Fire Storm - A concentrated rain of fireballs\r\n[*]Ice Storm - A concentrated rain of ice shards\r\n[*]Arrow Storm - A concentrated hail of arrows\r\n[*]Catapult Strike - A barrage of explosives fired from a catapult\r\n[*]Rock Barrage - A barrage of large rocks\r\n[*]Marked For Death - Target an individual and an storm of arrows will be fired at the target, following them as they move.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nEquip them with your favorite bow, take aim at your target location and release. A smoke signal will appear where your arrow lands indicating to the waiting Catapult Engineers, Mages or Archers where to unleash hell, you will also be given the \\'Launch Barrage\\' power. Once you have set up some targets, use the \\'Launch Barrage power and the artillery will begin. You can even set up several markers at the same time to increase the destruction.\r\n\r\nYou can find my workshop in game (South West of Morthal) complete with a delivery crate outside full of marker arrows, catapult and ballista Take a look around the place and read the journals for background on the Artillery and clues about future updates.\r\n\r\nThe marker arrows can also be purchased/found in the following locations:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Arrow Storm: Imperial/Stormcloak Quartermasters, Blacksmiths in Solitude and Windhelm\r\n[*]Fire Storm: Faralda in Winterhold\r\n[*]Ice Storm: Faralda in Winterhold\r\n[*]Catapult Strike: Imperial/Stormcloak Quartermasters\r\n[*]Rock Barrage: Bandit Chiefs\r\n[*]Marked for Death: Babbette in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can find the codes for the weapons by typing the following into the console:\r\nhelp \\\"marker arrow\\\"\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions, questions or issues then please let me know.
