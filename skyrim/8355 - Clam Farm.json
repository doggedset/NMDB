  "descriptionHtml": "Clam Farm\r\n\r\nEver find it odd that you can just pick a farmers crops and sell them yourself without them caring? Neither have I, and now you can do it with Clams!\r\nA familly of Argonian Clam Ranchers have moved to skyrim, and built their home on the north shore of Lake Ilinalta at the mouth of the white river. \r\n\r\nThis mod adds a new location as well as three new NPC\\'s\r\nThere are no quests as of yet, and I have only implemented basic packaging. \r\n\r\nThe Clam Farm can be found just west of the three \\'sign stones\\' (before Riverwood)\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\nextract files to a temporary location then drag and drop the ClamFarm.esp into your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n\r\nDont forget to check out the Pearl Farm mod for Oblivion that started it all!",
