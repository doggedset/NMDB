  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red][b]Update 1.2[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n-Racial support for other races added for Dawnguard eye (except beast races).\r\n-Added new \\\"Terminator\\\" eye with racial support (again without beast races).\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]Foreword[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nHello everyone... Well, I\\'ve been around for some time, and I never had  the urge/time/will to publish anything until this day. I\\'m relatively inexperienced in modding so I excuse in advance for any unpleasantries both technically and idealogically.\r\n\r\nMy main reason for publishing this mod is making an act of defiance to Bethesda and their policies regarding PCs.. I mean I played Arena, Daggerfall and the rest of them, yelled Bugthesda on their failures and raged some more about other things, but  deep inside I\\'ve respected for this drive they have for creating worlds. I know a thing or two about video game market and I can understand delaying PC release date for a main product (which skyrim\\'s wasn\\'t), but making a DLC exclusive is just petty. Thanks to dark0ne and many others, we have nexus and we have enough content to make infinitely more of the so-called [b]downloadable contents[/b] that are [b]exclusive[/b] for PC.. I could have nerd-raged, waged flame wars about this situation,  but I\\'ve concluded that best answer to this pettiness, this failing is to be more creative/productive/innovative than those who bar our way. Again, I give my sincere excuses for my action, and thank you for reading this ranting. :)\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]Description[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nDawnguard Eyes - Glowing Eye Mod is a standalone glowing eye mod. As far as I know, this is the first of it\\'s kind, an eye mod using a glow map. Dawnguard eyes are currently supported for all races (both male & female) except beast races (khajiit & argonian) and placed just before \\\"Demon\\\" eye on eye color slider.\r\n \r\n[color=red][b]Installation[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nJust drop the meshes, textures and .esp file in your main Data folder. It should be NMM compatible but I haven\\'t tested it. I don\\'t use it.\r\n \r\n[color=red][b]Uninstallation[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nDelete what you installed.\r\n \r\n[color=red][b]Special Thanks[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nI\\'d like to thank [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1900560]EvilDeadAsh34[/url] for being so patient and meticulous while helping me make this mod, without his expertise, I\\'d just lose attention and wander off :) So thank you, my friend!",
