  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r<br />===========\r<br />This mod adds Morgana, a dunmer mage, who will level up with you infinitely, is marriageable, and tends to cross her arms a lot. She also wears the stupid wench outfit, because why the heck not? \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Mod Facts=======\r<br />-Morgana uses destruction mainly.\r<br />-She tends to wander off\r<br />-She really, really has an arm crossing problem\r<br />-She has the spells ebonyflesh, conjure daedric lord, fireball, firebolt, and the shouts marked for death and unrelenting force\r<br />-She has the perks light feet (she wont trigger traps), impact (with destruction magic she can stagger enemies)\r<br />-She is part of quite a few factions.\r<br />-She is marriageable.\r<br />-She has quite a few enchanted objects\r<br />-She is not too overpowered due to her lack of armor rating (which sometimes makes her too weak, I am trying to make her use flesh spells)\r<br />-This mod will be updated rather regularly.\r<br />-Morgana was inspired by my friends character whose name was (wait for it, wait for it,) Morgana (Oh my god&#33;, its so surprising) \r<br />-Morgana is found at the drunken huntsman\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall\r<br />=========\r<br />All you have to do is uncheck the mod. Simple as that. Nothing else to it. Depending on how I update the mod this may change, but for now, just uncheck the esp. (please follow steps one and two of upgrade, in case you didnt know that already.)\r<br />\r<br />Upgrade\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />1. dismiss her and then leave the area she is in (it shouldn&#39;t matter, but it could still have problems (though there are no scripted events), and it is better to be safe then sorry)\r<br />1.5 If you are married, use a divorce mod.\r<br />2. Uninstall the old mod.\r<br />3. Install the new mod.\r<br />4. Start Skyrim and play. There is no effect on saved games and cannot \r<br />corrupt any saves.\r<br />\r<br />Incompatibility\r<br />===============\r<br />There should be no incompatibility issues, and if there are, please contact me (I will eventually get to that section...) \r<br />\r<br />Known Issues or Bugs\r<br />====================\r<br />The dark face bug is possible, but I believe I have fixed it and it should work well. (should be fixed in 1.0.1 update, thanks for telling me about the dds files missing).\r<br />There also seems to be a glitch where if you dismiss her she will simply roam about which, I believe, is due to an AI package I gave her, and while it can be annoying (especially if you are married and waiting for her to come home) it is an interesting feature, and have no plans of changing it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />1.0.1- hopefully fixed dark face bug, including facetint files.\r<br />1.0- This was just released, and I honestly didn&#39;t update it before it was released after it was released, as that would be self-contradictory :)\r<br />\r<br />(Pie is fun, I am not) (sorry, i just wanted to put something random in this,) (ok maybe i went slightly overboard) (but i digress) (actually i dont :))\r<br />(I will get to making this a contact section one day)\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />=========\r<br />Bethesda (you can guess why..)\r<br />Creation Kit (once again, pretty self explanatory)\r<br />Hammonds Legacy readme generator, for the huge help in dealing with this readne\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Tools Used\r<br />==========\r<br />Readme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r<br />Creation Kit\r<br />Licensing/Legal\r<br />===============\r<br />You can do whatever you want with this mod but all I ask in return is that \r<br />you give me credit if you distribute any part of this mod. I would also like\r<br />to know what mods are including my work.\r<br />=========================================================================",
