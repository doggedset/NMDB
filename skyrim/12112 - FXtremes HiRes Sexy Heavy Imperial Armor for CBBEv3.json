  "descriptionHtml": "phantom vertices that were blowing up are fixed.  now works with weight slider.  This mod replaces the vanilla female heavy imperial armor.  All you need to do is extract and copy/paste into your skyrim folder or use the NMM(i think).  The only other mod you need is CBBEv3.  You can find the link in the permissions section.  Special thanks to the modders that make my character look good.  This is by far my favorite mod I\\'ve made so please endorse it if you like it.",
