  "descriptionHtml": "Included is the converted heightmap to playable landmass. It is using ONRA&#39;s Tamriel  BMP and some modification in GEOCONTROL 2. To play this you need to add a door to it in the Creation Kit. I created this after I was looking for a heightmap for Highrock but couldn&#39;t find one. As I am moving on with my project and making the region by hand, I really don&#39;t need this anymore. So I uploaded it as a resource for others.\r<br />\r<br />Work still required: Fix the water distance between highrock and Hammerfell, GEOCONTROL messed up the distance.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thank you Onra for your work with the oblivion series that gave me the resources I needed.",
