  "descriptionHtml": "A work-in-progress version of the Imperial helmets made out of dragonbone. It is temperable at the workbench and craftable at any forge under imperial (as long as you have the Dragon Smithing perk). There are currently 2 variants available on the forge; Regular (Black plume) and Legate (Red plume)\r\n\r\nI felt that there aren\\'t enough higher level armors that still let you fly your imperial colors, and the legion seems to be largely ignored by modders. I aim to fix that. \r\n\r\nFuture Plans: \r\nHigher Resolution Textures (Don\\'t hold your breath)\r\nBoth variants of Imperial Helmet\r\nDifferent colored Plume (The scrub brush on your head)\r\n\r\nPrograms Used:\r\nGIMP\r\nFOMOD\r\nNifSkope\r\nCreation  Kit\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n Bethesda for the original mesh and the world\\'s greatest RPG\\'s\r\n\r\n \r\n",
