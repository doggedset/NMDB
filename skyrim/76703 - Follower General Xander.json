  "descriptionHtml": "General Dalton Charles Xander is a personal project to me and will be fully voiced and have a unique and personal story line in the not too distant future. But for now he is just a simple follower that will aid you in your quests. He can be found in the &#34;Four Shields Tavern&#34; in Dragonbridge. \r<br />\r<br />Just a few things to keep in mind: \r<br />\r<br />1. This is my first time making and uploading a mod at all. I&#39;m not even sure if I will get past the &#34;uploading part&#34;. If there is no word from me, send help.\r<br />\r<br />2. As stated above, this is a first. If there are ANY questions, comments and/or concerns, PLEASE let me know and I will try to get back to you and fix the issue as soon as possible&#33;\r<br />\r<br />3. Any and all endorsements go directly to the equipment and team that I will obtain. I just ordered my new AT20 Microphone and expect to dabble into the first audio dialogue with Xander soon&#33;",
