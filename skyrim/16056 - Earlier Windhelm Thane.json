  "modName": "Earlier Windhelm Thane",
  "summary": "Allows you to become thane in Windhelm earlier.",
  "descriptionHtml": "You will be able to become Thane of Eastmarch and buy the House in Windhelm on Stormcloak side as soon as you made your oath.\r\nI made this small tweak for personal use and decided to share.\r\nThis is still before of the \\\"point of no return\\\" in the Civil War questline and I made it no earlier just because of that and because is about becoming friend with Ulfric. Don\\'t ask for even earlier.\r\nCompatibility: this may be incompatible with mods changing the vanilla Eastmarch Thane quest and the house purchasing/upgrade quest. Good thing is that you can enable this one, get the dialog, buy the house, get the housecarl then disable it.\r\nAlso available on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=36488139",
