  "descriptionHtml": "Edhildils Mithril Armors\r\nAuthor: Edhildil\r\n6,3,2013\r\nver 1.1\r\n \r\nIF THIS MOD IS NOT FOR YOU PLEASE SKIP IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease read all of the description before you post a comment.\r\n\r\n[img]http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/1236/descriptionn.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a female standalone Armor mod, I made it from scratch and Calientes CBBE body.\r\n\r\nThe lowerbody has been enhanced in the derrier region (buttock)\r\nfor a fuller, rounder profile. The waist is somewhat thinner.\r\n\r\nArmor, Boots, Gauntlets, and Helm in two styles: Mithril and Black Mithril.\r\n\r\nCraftable under Elvish catagory. \r\n\r\nI only made one size as the armor was made from my tailored body shape. \r\nIf someone wants to make it for another body type, Bodyslide or BBP, go for it.\r\nI\\'m not going to remake this.\r\n\r\nBodyslide and BBP conversion of this armor is now available as part of Bodyslide CB Plus Plus. Download the \\\"CB Plus Plus 6 - Various\\\" package. The main package is required as well.\r\nIt is here (version 1):     http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32731\r\n\r\n[img]http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/3664/updatesb.png[/img]\r\n\r\nversion 1.2\r\n\r\nI have now added: Blue, Grey(original black version), Green, Purple, Red, and Yellow Mithril craftable sets.\r\n\r\nLike previous versions, I also added tempering to the armors, but I haven\\'t tried to temper any of them, the effect as yet is \r\n\r\nunknown to me. \r\n\r\nbecause the Shader properties are different, and the textures are shared, the meshes need to be different = Bigger file size.\r\n\r\nSo.. that makes me think that if Caliente can make a mod that rewrites meshes there must be a way somehow to make a slider for \r\n\r\nspecular intensity and the actual color spectrum, in which case, the file would be much smaller. Until then or if then, this \r\n\r\nmod uses the Oblivion approach by using a separate file for each different color scheme. And yes, I just proposed an \r\n\r\ninteresting idea that is outside my modding ability: Sliders for color and intensity values for Specular,emissive,lighting \r\n\r\neffects,environment map scaling, etc. Or i\\'m a science fiction writer on glue. for now, separate meshes is how i\\'m going to do \r\n\r\nit. In other words, these aren\\'t texture swaps, they\\'re Shader Properties that are unique for each color and mesh. \r\n\r\nFOR MODDERS:   *(others please skip to \\\"other notes\\\" below, it\\'s a bunch of tech mumbo-jumbo and very caddywhompas)\r\n\r\nThat being said, just copy/paste the BSLightingShaderProperty of each color for BBP modders, don\\'t convert 8000 identical \r\n\r\nnifs.Nifskope users can customize the colors by altering the Specular Color property by clicking on the rainbow icon to the \r\n\r\nright of the Specular Color in the Block Details of the BSLightingShaderProperty. Emissive colors can be altered to, as well \r\n\r\nas the Specular Strenth (0=none, 999=maximum). Not to mention the Environment Map Scale, which does something, I think, to the \r\n\r\nEnvironment Map (I think this is the chrome reflection; in oblivion I always saw trees reflected in my chrome stuff).\r\n\r\nMake a back-up Nif in case you biff it/have a blow out/wreck your mesh; or simply memorize what you tweaked and set the value \r\n\r\nback to where it was at or lessen/ increase to taste. If you melt your monitor screen it\\'s not my fault or turn it back down.\r\n\r\n*Other notes:\r\n\r\nNot tested with ENB as far as how it looks, this may increase/decrease glare depending on your ENB preferences.\r\n\r\nThe color effect seems less while out in the daylight, while indoors and during night by light sources seems to increase the \r\n\r\neffect (Grey Mithril and Mithril armors not so much).\r\n\r\nThis means that the color of the screenshots are at full effect. Ever lose your companion in dim light?\r\n\r\nFirst I\\'d like to thank ChronoTrigger77, Xanshio, and madpaddy for their great observations and advice. After I \r\nthought about the Black Mithril texture it did look like PVC plastic. These are the type of comments/discussions\r\nthat help modders constructively. I forgot to update the Tangent Spaces so now the detail should be much better.\r\n\r\nI have changed the Black Mithril texture to something truly awesome in my opinion. I added a black specular property\r\nat a value of 500.00. Slightly darker than the Mithril Armor, but it now looks like metal and its shiny. This value can be reduced or increased in Nifskope (0=none, 999=total), its in the Shader block details. Check the screenies.\r\n\r\nThe textures are the same for both sets, but the Shader Properties are different.\r\n\r\nFor those who like the grey texture I will leave that up as an optional file.\r\n\r\nPlease post pictures! I like pictures.\r\n\r\n[img]http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4153/requir.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nLatest Skyrim 1.9\r\n\r\nCalientes Big Bottem Edition v 3.2 -You\\'ll need this for all the body textures and hand, feet, face/head meshes, etc.\r\n \r\n[img]http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/2482/installa.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n1)Unzip the file to a temporary folder and read the contents.\r\n\r\n\r\nunzip and copy/paste the data folder into your \\\"skyrim\\\" folder\r\n(without the quotes). Activate the .esp \r\n\r\n\r\nuninstall:\r\n\r\ndelete included files and esp\r\n\r\n[img]http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/9223/bugske.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though I thought I got the Skyrim supported version of NifSkope,\r\nit will not show me the dismemberment vertices,(AARGH!)so I may have the \r\ndismemberments off, I will fix this when I can figure out the dismemberment vertices.\r\nThis armor seems unaffected during testing so far. This means that some combinations of gloves and/or boots may behave weird.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/8579/creditslo.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nCaliente (CBBE body)\r\nEdhildil (Armor meshes and textures)  \r\n\r\nTools:\r\n========================\r\nBlender\r\nGimp 2\r\nNifskope\r\nmy brain, eyes, and hands\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/4562/usaget.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n-E\r\n\r\nIf you want to use my meshes in your mod please give the proper credits listed in your mod readme/description. It would also be nice if you sent me a link so I can check out your mod.\r\n",
