  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i1295.photobucket.com/albums/b630/Matthiaswagg/HornOfPlenty-Cornucopia_zps6445fac3.png[/img]\r<br />Horn Of Plenty - Cornucopia (AKA Endless Plenty) is a bit of a nonsense mod. It&#39;s completely balanced, but it is by no means a huge mod nor one that I will have an interest in adding to. It adds a Nordic Horn, called the Cornucopia, to Bloated Man&#39;s Grotto. You can find it right by Bolar&#39;s Oathblade. When activated in your inventory, it will bestow upon you a random piece of food from a 40 or so large randomized list of foods. Then, it will be inactive for 12 hours until it is &#34;replenished&#34; and you may use it again. Like said, it IS balanced in the sense that you can&#39;t spam food. Perhaps it will be useful to some of you, or not. It&#39;s just something I made that I figured perhaps one or two people would be interested in.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Requirements\r<br />\r<br />[/size]Skyrim\r<br />[color=#ff0000]No DLCs are required. Hearthfire foods are NOT included.\r<br />\r<br />[/color][size=4]Installation\r<br />\r<br />[/size]Like any other mod. I recommend you get a mod manager if you don&#39;t have one already.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]FAQ\r<br />\r<br />[/size][color=#f1c232]Q: Conflicts? Compatibility issues?[/color]\r<br />A: This mod has one small edit. It adds the Cornucopia to Bloated Man&#39;s Grotto, which DOES edit that cell. If something else edits it, just load it after this mod and add the Cornucopia by console. Just use help cornucopia to find it.[/center][center][color=#f1c232]Q: Why am I getting so many sweet rolls and cheese wheels? I thought this was supposed to be randomized?[/color]\r<br />A: It IS randomized. But the list has 52 entries, and only 40 foods in it. I may have weighted the randomization in favor of sweet rolls and cheese wheels [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8m6_dqvORY]EVER SO SLIGHTLY[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232]Q: I just got a bunch of cheese wheels from the Cornucopia. What is this&#33;&#33;?[/color]\r<br />A: Yeah. You must have used it at least 100 times then. Well done. *applause* I&#39;m surprised you&#39;ve gotten that much enjoyment out of the Cornucopia, honestly.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232]Q: Will you add a spell where you wield the Cornucopia and it shoots out food?[/color]\r<br />A: No. I&#39;ve got no spell skills. If you want to, feel free to use the assets to create it as long as you require this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232]Q: Will you add ______?[/color]\r<br />A: No.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4995004/?tb=mods&pUp=1]My Other Mods[/url]\r<br />[/size](No, they&#39;re not as silly/small as this one.)[/center]",
