  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/plV3Nwi.png[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\tLatest skyrim update (v1.9.32.0.8), SKSE, SkyUI 4.1\r<br />\r<br />This simple mod gives you a new menu-page in the Mod Configuration Menu. Go the MCM and select &#34;Experience Choice&#34;. From there you can use a slider to set what you would like your experience gain multiplier to be. Valid options are 1x (default) through to 5x. \r<br />\r<br />I created this mod because I was fed up doing so much work re-grinding character levels so I could adequately test mods. Especially the big perk overhauls&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t count this as a cheat mod - you still play the game as normal, its just extremely useful for quickly running through the first 10 or 20 levels.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: There is a weird glitch happening when using &#39;incpcs&#39; from the console or paying a trainer to increase a particular skill by 1. \r<br />*** It&#39;s nothing gamebreaking&#33; ***\r<br />For some reason, your first increase will work, the 2nd will not, the 3rd will, then 4th not, etc. As far as I can tell this only happens with the incpcs console command and using a trainer.\r<br />I&#39;ve so far not been able to figure out a decent fix for this. I expect the next version to contain some kind of workaround - potentially a hotkey to immediately disable the experience multiplier which could be pressed again to re-enable at previous level, or possible extra scripting to see if I can intercept when talking to a trainer.\r<br />While the hotkey before entering - or manually choosing default in the MCM - will work for the &#39;incpcs&#39; at console, there&#39;s no way I&#39;ll be able to do a shmancy interrupt there.\r<br />\r<br />Will post more info and update when I can&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thanks for checking out my mod :)\r<br />\r<br />===========================\r<br />UPDATE v1.2 - Switched from slider layout to an much more readable menu. Highlight the &#39;choice&#39; part, click, and there are all your options. Confirmation of choice becoming active is displayed at top left of scren when you exit the pause menu.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE v1.1 - Modified to allow 1/4 and 1/2 vanilla speed experience gains. NOTE: The slider no longer shows the multiplier itself. Please read the legend in the MCM to see which option gives which multiplier.\r<br />Sorry, this is a quick and ugly update to allow these options. I&#39;ll finesse this for the next release, promise&#33;\r<br />\r<br />===========================\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall: \r<br />\r<br />While not recommended mid-playthrough, ensure you reset the slider to 1x (default) in the menu, exit MCM, then as long as you enter the following on the console you should be fine to remove:\r<br />stopquest perrobECquest\r<br />\r<br />===========================\r<br />\r<br />Further info:\r<br />\r<br />Should you not use SKSE / SkyUI, but still wish to get the benefits of my little mod you can manually activate the multipliers by typing the following into the console:\r<br />\r<br />stopquest perrobECquest\r<br />help &#34;XP choice&#34;\r<br />You will see a list of 5 perks. Take note of the ID of the perk you want to activate. It&#39;ll be in the format XX00182x IIRC.\r<br />then, for example, type:\r<br />player.addperk 3500182b\r<br />\r<br />Assuming my mod is loaded in position 35, this should activate the 5x perk.\r<br />\r<br />When finished, to remove you could use:\r<br />player.removeperk 3500182b#\r<br />\r<br />Please use this information with caution. I am not responsible for how you use your computer and/or game.\r<br />\r<br />================\r<br />\r<br />Credits / Thanks:\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda for Skyrim and all of the TES games&#33;\r<br />The SKSE and SkyUI teams for their fantastic contributions to the skyrim modding scene.
