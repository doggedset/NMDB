  "summary": "Player house in Solstheim. Small, comfortable, should be lore-friendly.",
  "descriptionHtml": "When I recieved permission to live in the Severin manor, I was disappointed to have such a terrible place to call home. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve created  my own house, that completely satisfied me.\r<br />If you love small, lore-friendly houses, this mod is totaly for you.\r<br />\r<br />This mod requires all DLC&#39;s to be installed (Dawnguard. Hearthfire. Dragonborn) \r<br />\r<br />The house itself is located in Raven Rock, down by the road after Severin manor. You can&#39;t miss it.\r<br />\r<br />What can you find in there:\r<br />- Oven to cook sweet, tasty pies\r<br />- Cooking pot to make soups and stakes\r<br />- Lots of alcohol to make your travels happier\r<br />- Library to store knowledge for future generations\r<br />- Alchemy Lab to either create deadly poisons or helpful potions\r<br />- Arcane Enchanter to put spells on weapons and armor\r<br />- Staff Enchanter to create your very own magical staff\r<br />- Smithy and all that&#39;s related to it\r<br />- Storages for your precious loot\r<br />- Quick passage to Skyrim from your house and\r<br />- Quick passage to your house from Skyrim directly for impatient ones\r<br />\r<br />The key can be found on the barrel, beside the entrance.\r<br />\r<br />Since it&#39;s my first mod, there might be some bugs and/or glitches, so you are most welcome to report them.\r<br />\r<br />And I wouldn&#39;t recommend walking in there with companions - they might get stuck ",
