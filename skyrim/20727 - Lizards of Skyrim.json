  "descriptionHtml": "Hey, you! Do you like Argonians?\r\n\r\nThis mod changes the playable races\\' appearance into Argonians. This mod affects children as well. Dragons are NOT affected, despite being named Lizards of Skyrim. \r\n\r\nAll racials traits and skills remains but facial features including hair, beards and facemarks are NOT carried over from the previous looks, but skull form and other adjustments does. \r\n\r\nThis is Fluffy. This has been on the Steam Workshop for awhile, but I realized I never brought it over to the nexus since summer vacation began. Since I\\'m working to play Dawnguard, might as well upload it here now. Updates will go to the Steam Workshop version before it reaches the Nexus, but I\\'ll try to keep this updated. \r\n\r\nThis is a variation of my mod Cats of Skyrim, however there is a few differences. Children now kept their default citizen clothes since default children clothes works well enough on Argonians, unlike Khajiits. \r\n\r\nWhat has changed: \r\n-All playable races looks like argonians. \r\n-Hair and beard have been removed from new argonians. \r\n\r\nWhat hasn\\'t changed:\r\n-Existing argonians are unchanged.\r\n-Monsters, Animals, Dremoras and Undead are untouched. \r\n-Racial skills and traits remains unaltered. \r\n-Text and voice are the same. \r\n\r\nVersion 1.03\r\n\r\nThis mod uses default head meshes, so some conflicts may happens with mods that changes the default head meshes or body skeletons. Custom races that depends on default data will also be affected.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, you can\\'t use Cats of Skyrim at the same time! \r\n\r\nNote: You may notice that Argonians\\' eyes blinks bottom to top: That\\'s normal for Argonians. However, since head data morphs are carried over from the old races, eyes may look wonky for some heads. \r\n\r\nHave fun.",
