  "descriptionHtml": "A mummy-like draugr, the body is wrapped in linen sheets.\r\n\r\n  There are 8 new meshes with different combinations: female/male, with underwear/without underwear, with strypes/without strypes.They use vanilla linens textures (with modified UVmaps) so they are not included here: the game should recognize the paths to them automatically.\r\n There is an extra female model which I did not like the result, but I added it anyway. In case you like it... \r\n\r\n  This is a modders´ resource and they are not in-game yet, I included an .esp file for creature evaluation. If you want to check how they look: extract the content of this mod to your game´s \\\"data\\\" folder. Activate MummydraugrTEST and Launch Skyrim. Use the console and type \\\"coc AAAtestmummy\\\".\r\n\r\nYou may use and redistribute this as you wish since you don´t charge \r\nmoney for it, just give me the credits.\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\nWHAT´S NEW\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\n -Fixed normal maps for 2 meshes\r\n\r\n -Added 5 \\\"mummy corpse\\\" meshes to be used as containers.",
