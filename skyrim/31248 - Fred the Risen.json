  "descriptionHtml": "[center]Welcome to\r\n[img]http://s11.postimage.org/gzs2lavsj/2013_02_07_00008.jpg[/img]\r\n[/center]\r\n\r\n* OVERVIEW *\r\nThis mod gives to you a new spell tome: Conjure Fred the Risen.\r\nFred is a frantic and psychotic Necro-Skeleton and kills any enemy for you! He have a Barbarian class and he have a daedric battleaxe.\r\nThe spell costs is the same as the Conjure Dremora spell (expert conjuraction: 319 magicka points) and the effect duration is 60 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n* WHY \\\"FRED\\\"? *\r\nI\\'ve recently played Risen, a fantastic RPG made by Piranha Byte team (the same who made the Gothic series).\r\nIn that game there was a spell to conjure a skeleton named Fred and it was very useful during the gameplay. So I\\'ve made this mod to honour him :)\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://s4.postimage.org/qo1vv2hi5/2013_02_07_00007.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n* STATS *\r\nAs I said, Fred is a Barbarian Class and he is with lots of stamina points. He is a leveled NPC and range is from 30 to 81. So it\\'s a perfect conjuraction spell for who play Skyrim in Master difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n* WHERE IS THE SPELL TOME? *\r\nYou can find the spell tome at the shrine of Mehrunes Dagon. There is a magical brazier near the stairs and it contains the spell tome.\r\n\r\n\r\n* INSTALL *\r\nJust place the ESP file and activate it\r\n\r\n\r\n* UNINSTALL *\r\nRemove the ESP file\r\n\r\n\r\n* BUGS *\r\nNo bugs and known issues to report. If you find one, please report to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n* FACEBOOK *\r\nI\\'m on Facebook: I\\'m glad if you join in:\r\n[url=https://www.facebook.com/MannyGTSkyrimMods]https://www.facebook.com/MannyGTSkyrimMods[/url]\r\n\r\n* ENJOY *",
