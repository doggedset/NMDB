  "descriptionHtml": "I wanted Anska as a follower as I know many of you did but found it impossible to get her to join me so I took the time to recreate her as a Nord Race instead of where Bethesda had her as Fox Race. This is as close a reproduction as I could manage, Feel free to modify her as you see fit...Enjoy!\r\n\r\nShe can be found exactly where she lives in the High Gate Ruins. You will be able to have her join you as soon as you see her, just make sure you select the Quest choices of Dialogue so you get credit for the Quest.\r\n\r\nAnska is a carbon copy of the Original NPC, Crazy Powerful Magic...I saw fit however to make her essential and to make her level range go from 25 to 80, She will not affect your Stealth and she CAN be Married.",
