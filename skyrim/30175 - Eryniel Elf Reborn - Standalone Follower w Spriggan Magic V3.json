She is set to primarily depend on her magic and bow. She has nearly 35 customized offensive and defensive Spriggan magic spells designed specifically for her. Her combat strategy can be described as flank/stalk/magic attack.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#7CFC00]Eryniel&#39;s background:[/color][/b] Eryniel - the daughter of the woods. She is learned in the arts of Archery and Spriggan Magic.  Eryniel lost her family and was taken in and raised by a family of Spriggans. They gifted her with a lot of their magic and she made many allies in that forest.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#7CFC00]Eryniel&#39;s race:[/color][/b] Eryniel uses customized verison of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20172/?]Epic Elves race[/url]. Epic elves feel bond with nature and strive to live in harmony with the natural world. They are proficient with bows and swords as well as magic. \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#7CFC00]Location where you can find her:[/color][/b] Just on the other side of the bridge running out of Riverwood - usually hanging around the waterfall on the left.  (See screenshots)\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#7CFC00]Requirements:[/color][/b] Skyrim version 1.8 or higher. Other than that there is no requirements.The mod is absolutely standalone, meaning that all required mods are already included in the main file, so you don&#39;t need any additional mods to be installed. \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#7CFC00]Recommended but not required mods:[/color][/b] \r<br />[b][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29719]Eryniel Elf Reborn- NSFW Nude Patches[/url] - body options for Eryniel;[/b] UNP Skinny, UNP Curvy, CBBE Slim, CBBE Curvy, E55, ADEC, Pandora.\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12933]Extensible Follower Framework by Expired[/url] - multifollower mod, enhances your followers behavior, fixes a lot of follower related bugs and much more. This mod also works with AFT and UFO.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41304]Size does matter - NPCs don&#39;t rescale, shrink, resize by Mahlzeit88[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52019/?]Follower Commentary Overhaul - FCO by terzaerian[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-8.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/30175-2-1360392121.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#7CFC00][b]This Mod is cleaned with TES5Edit prior to any and every release[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#7CFC00]Customized build:[/color][/b]\r<br />- Autoleveled, marriageable and Essential\r<br />- Morality: Any crime\r<br />- Health/Stamina/Magicka Offsets:  None\r<br />- Race: Eryniel&#39;s Epic Elves Race is tweaked and set unplayable. The tweaks are +100 to burden, and Health/Stamina/Magicka start at 100. \r<br />If you wish you can still have [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20172/?]Epic Elves race by Zzjay[/url] installed, it will not conflict with this mod.\r<br />- Starting gear: Her inventory will contain everything she needs to initially get started. All, except for the bow and staff, will be randomly selected from the leveled lists for the level you initially find her.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#7CFC00]Spriggan magic Spells - All Customized:[/color][/b]\r<br />- Offensive:  A spriggan and a matron level of Insect Swarm, she gains access to the matron level as her destruction increases. Approximately 20 levels of Call Wilderness Animal ranging from Novice to Master level.  Eryniel will gain access to more animals as her Conjuration skill increases.\r<br />- Defensive: 5 levels of Spriggan defense spells starting at novice level she wraps herself in visible oak bark. She gains access to the higher defense spells as her alteration increases. \r<br />- Spriggan Healing: Eryniel has two levels of self healing Spriggan magic. Swirls of leaves at her feet also grant her magic resistance.\r<br />- Special Spell for the Player: Dispell Beasts Spell -allows you to dispell Eryniel&#39;s animals. You can get the spell tom from Eryniel&#39;s inventory.  The spell must be cast on Eryniel, just like Dispel from Oblivion, not on Eryniel&#39;s animals.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color= #7CFC00]Customized combat style:[/color][/b] Can be described as flank/stalk/magic attack.  As for weapons, she favors bows, staffs, one handed and shields. Her AI is tweaked to entirely prioritize weapon selection from longest range to shortest range - in that order.  She is trained in shield attacks and power attacks and can also dual wield.  But her priority is magic and the bow. To see the most spriggan magic, equip her with a bow and a shield and nothing else.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#7CFC00]Customized Class:[/color][/b]  as she levels up she favors magicka over stamina and health.  She will increase the following skills - One-Handed, Archery, Block, Light Armor, Sneak, Destruction, Alteration and Conjuration since she needs these to defend herself and also cast her Spriggan Magic.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#7CFC00]Customized Mage Staff:[/color][/b] Hircine&#39;s Splinter fires custom Spriggan magic \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#7CFC00]Map Marker:[/color][/b] If you lose her, you can find her by toggling on the &#34;Where is Eryniel?&#34; quest.  \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#7CFC00]Perks:[/color][/b] \r<br />- Complete perk set for Archery, Light Armor, Block, One-handed, and Sneak (no trap triggering)\r<br />- Partial perk set to support her spells and role for Conjuration, Restoration, Destruction and Alteration.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#7CFC00]Meshes and textures:[/color][/b]\r<br />- Head meshes: Eryniel uses custom head mesh, custom ears mesh  and a special set of tri files to give her unique appearance.\r<br />- Body: Eryniel has UNP slim Never Nude by default. \r<br />Additionally we have made a special patch  which allows you to give Eryniel CBBE Slim Never Nude body. (CBBE patch is avaliable in Optional downloads). \r<br />There are also Nude CBBE and UNP body patches available on the special download page: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29719]Eryniel Elf Reborn- NSFW Nude Patches[/url]. Note that nude patches require Eryniel Never Nude UNP or CBBE body to be installed first.\r<br />-Textures: Eryniel uses High Resolution uncompressed body and face textures and  High Res make-up tintmap. \r<br />Eryniel has unique high resolution body and face Spriggan art tattoos, created for her by Rip88 and TairenSoul.\r<br />Eryniel&#39;s default Nevernude bodies (UNP & CBBE) use special underwear textures, which were created exclusively for Eryniel by Rip88.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-8.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/30175-3-1360392121.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#7CFC00]How to Install:[/color]\r<br />Make your life easy and use NMM.
