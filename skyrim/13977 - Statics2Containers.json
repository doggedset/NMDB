  "summary": "This mod replaces various static containers with containerised versions that use the original models",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod consists of 3 .esp\\'s to replace Crates, Casks & Barrels, Woodpiles with containers that look identical to the originals.\r\nAll new containers are fully populated by levelled lists and are set to NOT respawn, rendering them safe for long-term storage.\r\n\r\nS2C-Crates\tReplaces 3040 crates in the game (all of them except the 100 snow covered ones)\r\n\r\nS2C-Casks\tReplaces the large casks (114), small mead barrels (914) and the dark wooden barrels (2748, again not the snow covered ones).\r\n\r\nS2C-Woodpiles\tReplaces all sizes of woodpiles (1139 of them) with containers containg random quantities of wood so you need never chop wood again :)\r\n\r\nNote: Where containers exist in owned areas e.g. Dragonsreach, the new containers inherit the ownership of the parent cell.\r\n\r\nImportant note - these mods are NOT compatible with existing game characters as any save game will contain references to the static objects that I have replaced.  So use with NEW CHARACTERS ONLY.  I have played a NEW character up to level 34 with no noticeable problems.\r\n\r\nI know of 2 mods that replace casks & barrels, this is why I created 3 separate files, so you can pick and choose.\r\n\r\nS2C-All\t\tThis file combines the above three mods into one.  Use this file OR the seperate versions if you want some flexability, NOT BOTH.\r\n\r\nNote: The combined version is a re-creation of the work I did for the 3 seperated versions rather than a merge so there may be some slight variation with the levelled lists.\r\n\r\nInstallation - Download with NMM.\r\nManual Installation - Put the files in your Skyrim\\\\Data directory\r\n\r\nUn-Installation - Delete all files prefixed with S2C (Up to 5 Files including this Readme, depending on version)\r\n\r\nRevisions\r\n1.0\tInitial Version.\r\n1.1\tAdded all in one version & Readme.",
