  "summary": "Removed the enemies and their items from Blackreach to clear the area up for civilization creator mods.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I cleared out Blackreach removing enemies and their items including the spiderwebs, chaurus eggs and falmer camps. I thought it would be interesting (though difficult) to rebuild the Silent City in Blackreach using a mod like the Pocket Empire Builder or Tundra Defense but that isnt very easy when the area is filled with all sorts of creatures. I think I got everything and have done a quick walk through to double check but I am not 100% sure so please let me know if anyone finds anything like an extra falmer or item etc. and I will update accordingly. This is meant for Dawnguard but \\'should\\'  work without it, this is my very first real mod if you can even call it that so any help or constructive criticism would be appreciated.",
