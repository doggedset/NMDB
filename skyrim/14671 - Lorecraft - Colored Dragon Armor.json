Seems just like yesterday when you have slain your first typical dragon. But today, they are stronger. Blood, Frost, Elder and Ancient dragons roam the skies, with their vibrant colored scales which are tougher than ever.\r\nBut your armor isn\\'t. For it was created with the weak scales of a typical brown dragon.\r\nBut it is about to change now.\r\nThe tougher dragons will now drop higher quality scales upon their death, which you can use to create tougher and prettier dragon armor.\r\n\r\nThis mod version is a plug-in for ArcaneSmith\\'s mod called Lorecraft, which improves the crafting system in Skyrim. Lorecraft 3.0 or higher IS REQUIRED if you want this mod to work. If you do not want to use Lorecraft version, you can use the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8038]regular one[/url]\r\n[center][img]http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/2016/lorewarning.png[/img][/center]\r\n[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9959]Lorecraft Core (required)[/url][/center]\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]What does this mod have to offer?[/b][/color]\r\nThis mod contains 5 sets of new variations for dragonscale armor: Blood, Frost, Elder, Ancient and Alduin\\'s.\r\nMod works with both male and female characters, and has shields.\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]How to install:[/b][/color]\r\nExtract the files from the archive into your Data folder.
