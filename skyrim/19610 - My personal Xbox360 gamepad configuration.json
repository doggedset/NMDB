  "descriptionHtml": "This is my own Xbox360 gamepad configuration, and it was made to suit my own play style.\r\nI don\\'t like too complicated settings, but I like more functionality when I play Skyrim.\r\nI\\'ve didn\\'t make any changes to default control scheme, just added more hotkeys.\r\n\r\nI know there\\'re many other configurations out there, still I\\'ve decided to share my config, maybe someone will prefer this one over the others. So, If you like what you see, grab it for youself!\r\n\r\n=============================================\r\nHOTKEYS ONLY version includes:\r\nHotkey 1: DPad left (default)\r\nHotkey 2: DPad right (default)\r\nHotkey 3: LB+DPad left\r\nHotkey 4: LB+DPad right\r\nHotkey 5: LB+X\r\nHotkey 6: LB+Y\r\nHotkey 7: LB+RB\r\nQuicksave: LB+Start\r\nQuickload: LB+Back\r\n\r\nMORE FUNCTIONALITY version includes:\r\nHotkey 1: DPad left (default)\r\nHotkey 2: DPad right (default)\r\nHotkey 3: LB+DPad left\r\nHotkey 4: LB+DPad right\r\nHotkey 5: LB+X\r\nHotkey 6: LB+Y\r\nHotkey 7: LB+RB\r\nQuicksave: LB+Start\r\nQuickload: LB+Back\r\nQuick Magic Menu:      A+DPad left\r\nQuick Inventory Menu:  A+DPad right\r\nQuick Map Menu:        A+DPad up\r\nScreenshot:            A+Back or A+Start\r\n\r\n=============================================\r\nInformation:\r\n*In Skyrim, you may notice that there\\'s a small delay between pressing LB and making your character sprint. You can easly use that delay by quick button presses, so you can manage your inventory by hotkeys, and not make your character sprint.\r\n\r\n*When you hold down LB, it will make your character sprint as intended. You of course can change weapons and spells, drink potions or change equipment that are hotkeyed while sprinting.\r\n\r\n*While using more functionality version, watch out for picking up objects accidentally.\r\n*Settings where made for default user interface and default control scheme.\r\n\r\n=============================================\r\nInstalation and deinstalation:\r\nJust extract this file into you Skyrim instalation directory (Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim)\r\n\r\nIf you use other configurations, you may want to make a backup of them, follow \\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Interface\\\\Controls\\\\PC\\\\and backup file named cotrolmap.txt\r\n\r\nIf you want to remove this configuration, follow \\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Interface\\\\Controls\\\\PC\\\\and remove file named cotrolmap.txt\r\n\r\n=============================================\r\nThat is all! I hope you like it!\r\n-defosh369",
