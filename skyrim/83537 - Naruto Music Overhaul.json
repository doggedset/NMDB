  "summary": "Finally Naruto Music ^^",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ok so I love Naruto and I have found many mods to change skyrim to Help give it a nice Naruto feel . I have found jutsu, armors, weapons, races and followers but were is the MUSIC&#33;? Naruto has great music its a key feature for me so here it is. This mod replaces all music in skyrim with Naruto original sound tracks . It changes all combat music files , town music, dungeons , caves, forts, taverns and just wandering around Skyrims massive map. Also adds some Naruto Anime Intro/outro music to level up, so when you level up and go to the screen to select magic health or stamina you will here one random track.(each one plays for 1 min 32 secs just like anime). I have added so much music I stopped counting after 70 Tracks. Give it a try took me awhile to gather all the files. Enjoy Skyrim Naruto Style&#33;",
