  "descriptionHtml": "1,000 Views&#33; Thank You&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Ruby is a follower that prefers ranged weapons, as I was unhappy with the Vanilla game; where Followers only use bows at certain times.\r<br />She is based around Sapphire and Ysolda, who was the base character used to model Ruby.\r<br />She is also inspired by Sapphire, and carries 2 rubies to represent her alias.\r<br />She is a Follower, and she is also a Marriage Candidate.\r<br />When I upload more mods to come, no doubt she will be Incompatible.\r<br />This is my First uploaded mod, and there are three files.\r<br />They are all the same - It does not matter which one you choose.\r<br />-- Known Issues --\r<br />Sometimes she will not have the appropriate disposition towards you.\r<br />If this is the case; click on her and type in the Console &#34;Setrelationshiprank player 4&#34; without the Quotation Marks and she will follow you.  This is being fixed.\r<br />\r<br />I can confirm in Windowed Mode Ruby will attack you. Revert to an earlier save, or kill somebody, go to Jail and wait out your sentence. This is also being fixed\r<br />Version 1.5.1 Planned to come out within the week.\r<br />-------------------------------\r<br />I AM TAKING REQUESTS&#33;\r<br />",
