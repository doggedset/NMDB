  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][size=3]I always felt that the two-handed weapons were a bit weak compared to a dual wield setup.\r<br />And i liked those simple mods, that gave the two-handers a boost by tweaking the Barbarian perks.[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3][color=red]This mod does this as well.[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />Instead of a [b][color=red]20/40/60/80/100%[/color][/b] damage bonus, the Barbarian perks now increase the damage by [b][color=red]33/66/100/150/200%[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Now available for the Special Edition:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1983/?]Simple Two-Handed Rebalance[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]This results in a net 50% damage increase compared to vanilla Skyrim (300% vs 200%).[/b]\r<br />I feel this is a justified value at higher levels and with high smithing.\r<br />two-handers are slow compared to one-handed weapons and therefor benefit much less than these from legendary smithing enhancements. And that is even before you add dual wielding to the equation.\r<br />\r<br />This Mod is a recreation/reinterpretation/rebalance/bugfix of other mods, that have done the same already.\r<br />There is a mod by BaconCat, that has slightly weaker damage boosts (125% and 150%, give it a look if you feel this one is too strong):\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10847]Barbarian Perk Tweak aka More Two Handed Damage[/url]\r<br />If you are looking for a stronger version, check out the new [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/45199]Two Handed Overhaul[/url].\r<br />Then there is the mod by j4r3ddd, that was done before the Creation Kit became available and is horribly bug ridden by todays standards:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5986]Two Handed Weapon Damage Boost[/url]. Word of advice: Don&#39;t use this any more.\r<br />\r<br />If you feel you don&#39;t want to clutter your load order with too many small mods, you might want to consider mod merging:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37981]Merge Plugins TES5Edit Script[/url][/center]",
