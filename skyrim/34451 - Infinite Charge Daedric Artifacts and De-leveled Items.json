  "summary": "Daedric lords are considered \\\"Gods\\\" but their artifacts require charging like mortal constructs, changed. No more delaying quest for the strongest version of a reward, now you have the same strength even early on. Requires Dawnguard.",
  "descriptionHtml": "2013/06/08\r\nUpdate V1.4:\r\nNow requires Dragonborn!\r\nIncluded Dragonborn and de-leveled the following items:\r\nMiraak\\'s Staff\r\nMiraak\\'s Sword\r\nMiraak (mask, both light and heavy versions)\r\n\r\nNote that although Miraak\\'s robe has a leveled list and points to different item ids, they are identical in stats.\r\n\r\n2013/04/13\r\nUpdate V1.3:\r\nChanged values so this mod is now [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19]Unofficial Skyrim Patch[/url] friendly!\r\nMainly just material keyword changes and some bug fixes that brings this mod in-line with USKP.\r\nThis does not mean you need USKP for this mod, it just means the values are changed to that of USKP\\'s values so no need to worry this mod bringing bugs back into the game. However, if you don\\'t use USKP, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND.\r\n\r\n2013/04/06\r\nUpdate V1.2:\r\nModified rewards lists so that it always gives out the strongest version.\r\n\r\n2013/04/06\r\nAs PieLighter has suggested, Staff of Magnus is a creation of god of sorcery and should be infinitely charged.\r\nUpdate V1.1:\r\nStaff of Magnus is now infinitely charged.\r\nAbsorb magicka increased to 25 pts from 20 and subsequent absorb health increased from 25 pts from 20 in the optional stronger version.\r\n\r\n2013/04/05\r\nRequires Dawnguard.\r\n\r\nDaedric lords are considered \\\"Gods\\\" of Nirn, yet their artifacts require charging from time to time like a mortal construct does. It felt degrading for me and I changed it so that all daedric artifacts have unlimited charges now.\r\n\r\nEffected items:\r\nAuriel\\'s Bow - While not from a daedric lord, it was created by an elven god Auri-El, so I feel it\\'s justified.\r\nDawnbreaker\r\nKeening - Similar to Auriel\\'s bow, this is made by a dwemer lord.\r\nMace of Molag Bal\r\nSanguine Rose\r\nSkull of Corruption\r\nVolendrung\r\nWabbajack\r\n\r\nNote: Ebony blade and Mehrune\\'s razor are both infinite charged arleady. Staff of Magnus is from a powerful wizard, and not from a daedric lord. *Changed in later version*\r\n\r\n Also I hated the fact that you get weaker version of certain items just because you finished the quest earlier on, thus rendering the item useless later on. I have changed this as well.\r\n\r\nNote: I changed all version of the item to be same stats as the strongest version, as well as quest rewards. So it will work for previously obtained weaker versions as well as newly obtained items.\r\n\r\nThe following are items which are de-leveled.\r\nChillrend\r\nDragonbane\r\nGauldur Blackblade\r\nGauldur Blackbow\r\nLunar Iron Mace\r\nLunar Iron Sword\r\nLunar Iron War Axe\r\nLunar Steel Mace\r\nLunar Steel Sword\r\nLunar Steel War Axe\r\nThe Pale Blade\r\nNightingale Blade\r\nNightingale Bow\r\nNightingale Amor\r\nNightingale Boots\r\nNightingale Gloves\r\nNightingale Hood\r\nShield of Solitude\r\nAmulet of Articulation\r\nMage\\'s Circlet\r\n\r\nI also include an optional version which also improves the stats of most daedric artifacts for people who think they are currently underpowered. The infinite charges still apply to this section, the following changes are on top.\r\n\r\nEffected Items:\r\nDawnbreaker - Doubled chance for Meridia\\'s Retribution, and doubled fire dmg, now 20 from 10.\r\nMace of Molag Bal - Instead of damaging stamina and magicka, you absorb them for your own.\r\nMehrune\\'s Razor - Increased weapon speed from 1.3 to 1.5.\r\nVolendrung - Increased stagger effect from 1.15 to 1.65, it\\'s now harder for enemies to prevent stagger.\r\nEbony mail - Doubled poison cloak dmg, now 10 pts of dmg per sec from 5.\r\nMasque of Clavicus Vile - Magicka Regeneration increased from 5% to 25%.\r\nSavior\\'s Hide - Magic resistance increased from 15% to 25%.\r\nSpellbreaker - Ward pts increased from 50 pts to 75 pts.\r\n\r\nNote: I believe ebony blade\\'s 10-30 pts of health absorb is quite strong already, so no changes. Same is true for skull of corruption. Sanguine rose is a summoning staff, infinite charges makes it infinitely stronger already. Wabbajack is similar to sanguine rose, but also because the effects are meant to be random. Ring of hircine is meant to give werewolves convenience, so no changes. Ring of namira with its 50 pts stamina boost feels quite strong already as well.\r\n\r\nThese stats are largely personal preference and is up for debate. If you feel like they should be different you can let me know, I will consider it if you have a good justification.",
