  "modName": "Cultist Armor - Light Armor - craftable - upgradeable",
  "summary": "Modifies the Cultist Armor in Dragonborn to be craftable and upgradeable, and for all pieces to be of Light Armor at roughly Leather quality",
  "descriptionHtml": "Quick and simple mod that requires the Dragonborn DLC. It\\'ll change the existing Cultist armor as per the following -\r\n\r\n--Cultist Boots and Robes have been modified from Clothing category to Light Armor\r\n\r\n--Cultist Robes have had the standard Magicka regen enchantment removed, allowing an enchantment of the player\\'s choice\r\n\r\n--Cultist Mask has been modified from Heavy Armor to Light Armor\r\n\r\n--Base values, armor ratings, and weights are equivalent to their Leather Armor counterparts\r\n\r\n--All can be crafted at a normal forge under the Leather armor category, and improved at a workbench\r\n\r\n--All crafting and upgrade material costs are reasonable, requiring only Leather Strips and Leather for most pieces. The Mask also requires a couple Iron Ingots to craft, and 1 Steel Ingot to upgrade.\r\n\r\n=== INSTALLATION ===\r\n\r\nDownload the file, unzip into main Skyrim\\\\Data folder.\r\n\r\nShould conflict only with mods that modify the Dragonborn Cultist Armor. Since this is such a simple mod, I doubt I\\'ll modify it in any way. I tested it quickly in-game and found no apparent bugs.",
