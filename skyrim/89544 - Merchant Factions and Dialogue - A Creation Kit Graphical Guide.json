  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]SORRY TO INFORM YOU, BUT THE FORM LISTS WITHIN THE CREATION KIT ARE INACCURATE OR DO NOT AIM TO THE SAME PURPOSE AS THIS GUIDE, HENCE THEY ARE BASICALLY USELESS FOR THIS PURPOSE\n<br />\n<br />[/size]In the two first pages of this guide you will find a chart in which a list of all the common voicetypes (not the unique ones) (neither the dlc-added ones, as they are irelevant) is presented, indicating which \"jobfactions\" they have the audio files of. (The only \"jobfactions\" considered in the guide are the ones that trigger the barter menu and the \"rentroom\" one.\n<br />\n<br />In the third page you will find another chart that indicates which faction indicates which dialogue.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The guide is presented in pdf format.\n<br />\n<br />Minimum knowledge of the creation kit required.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />There is not much else to say. Enjoy it. May this guide make your modding journey easier.\n<br />\n<br />Leave your thoughts in the comment section. Have a good day. Don't drink and drive.\n<br />\n<br />I love you and you should too.\n<br />\n<br />I'm starting to be excessive. It may be time to stop reading.\n<br />\n<br />Focault was not an structuralist.\n<br />\n<br />Why are you still reading this?",
