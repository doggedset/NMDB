  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes all skills start with a base attribute of 5, with their racial bonuses taken into consideration. I made this for myself, but decided to upload it to the Nexus. For example, an Altmer will have 15 Illusion, 10 Destruction, 10 Conjuration, 10 Alteration, 10 Restoration, 10 Enchanting and a skill level of 5 in every other skill.\r<br />\r<br />There should be no incompatibilities. I use Resplendent with no issues. \r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Extract the text document relevant to your character to Skyrim &gt; Data, where your .esps are located.\r<br />Start a new character. Once you get inside Helgen Keep or have chosen your starting location with Alternate Start - Live Another Life, open console.\r<br />Type bat, then a space and enter the name of the text document you extracted. I.e. bat Altmer\r<br />Enjoy&#33;",
