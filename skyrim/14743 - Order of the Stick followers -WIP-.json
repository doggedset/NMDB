  "descriptionHtml": "Currently bugged, I am doing everything to fix it.\r\n\r\nAdds characters of the Order of the Stick (Cartoon by Rich Burlew) to Skyrim\\'s major cities\\' inns. \r\n\r\nLocations:\r\nRoy: Markarth (Silver-Blood Inn) (Curently bugged)\r\nVaarsuvius: Solitude (Winking Skeever Inn) \r\nDurkon: Windhelm (Candlehearth Hall Inn)\r\nHaley and Elan: Whiterun (Bannered Mare Inn) (Haley bugged)\r\nBelkar: Riften (The Bee and Barb Inn)\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n- All characters are resistant to damage\r\n- This mod clashes with UFO (ultimate follower overhaul) - Roy won\\'t stop following you, \r\n- Haley is refusing to follow you, maybe because of her membership in Thieves Guild\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n- Adding a quest\r\n- Making the items unobtainable\r\n- Elan talking about the OOTS\\' adventures and being more dumbish\r\n- Adding Linear Guild followers, Xykon\\'s team followers and Sapphire Guard followers\r\n- More obvious relationship between Haley and Elan\r\n- Adding perks similar to these given by Paarthurnax\r\n- Adding training options \r\n- Creating halfling and dwarven race, so Belkar and Durkon won\\'t be Breton (or Imperials)\r\nInteresting things about the Order members:\r\n- Elan is a full member of Bards\\' College, so you can ask him to play and sing.\r\n- Durkon wields one-handed hammer. \r\n- Elan is intelligent\r\n- Vaarsuvius can conjure \r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nRich Burlew - Creating OOTS\r\nBethesda - Creating Creation Kit\r\n\r\n\r\nWrite your ideas in the discussion I created.",
