  "descriptionHtml": "This mod sets merchants from cities and villages to Protected, they will no longer die during vampire and dragon attacks, I always had Belethor and Adrianne dying from vampire attacks, Alvor dying from dragon attacks and sometimes other merchants died as well, so I decided to stop that. You can still kill them yourself if you need to, in order to get a high profile target for Volkihar quests, Â or for any other reason. Mod is simple and has no scripts whatsoever.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim 1.9\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Extract the archive and copy EssentialMerchants.esp to Skyrim/Data\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />\r<br />Delete EssentialMerchants.esp",
