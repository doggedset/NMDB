  "descriptionHtml": "This mod puts adds over twenty weapons to the game, mostly swords.  The weapons are historically accurate and properly proportioned - which means not really very big.  You acquire the weapons by crafting them.  The Steel crafting perk is required.  The weapons can be improved.  \r\n\r\nThe weapons do not all carry the same statistics.  Some are faster.  Others do more damage.  Some are higher quality and others are not.  The higher quality ones are probably good enough to use throughout the game.  There are level checks on the higher quality weapons, so you will not be able to craft every weapon at level 1.\r\n\r\nSee the attached XML (open in Excel or Open Office) for details.\r\n",
