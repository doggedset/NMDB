  "descriptionHtml": "Just a simple fix I made for myself. Anybody who wants to is free to use it as well.\n<br />\n<br />Better Dynamic Snow is, for some reason, applying the wrong material to the middle of the Nordic Temple Stairs, resulting in mismatching textures. It is not really noticeable, when you use the vanilla snow textures, but with a texture mod, like [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/670/]Nordic Snow[/url]ï»¿, it gets really noticeable and annoying.\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />Just download the mod and install it with your mod manager or simply copy the esp into your data folder.\n<br />\n<br />Uninstallation:\n<br />It's completely save to remove, just remove the mod from within your mod manager or delete the esp from your data folder.\n<br />\n<br />If you find any more areas, where this is also the case, let me know and I'll fix them.",
