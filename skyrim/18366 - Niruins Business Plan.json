  "descriptionHtml": "Add\\'s erm - \\\"Ladies of the Evening\\\" to the game. If that kind of thing might offend you then please don\\'t download. If you play a female character or have a female follower then try talking to a lonely fellow in a tavern after 8pm for extra options. Don\\'t really want to give away much more than that, where\\'s the fun of discovery if I tell you, check the spoilers if you want to spoil the fun.\r\n\r\n[b]Requirements:[/b]\r\nThis mod will not work at all without [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11811]Fores New Idles in Skyrim (Behavior Files 3.x)[/url].\r\n\r\n[b]Extras / Compatible:[/b]\r\nIf you have [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12793]Calyps\\' Adult Toys[/url] installed they will be used in female + female scenes.\r\nWill make use of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14294]Osare Underwear UNP[/url] if you have that installed.\r\n\r\nFor the best \\'alignment\\' use the male body from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6667]4uDIKs Real body -4RB-[/url]\r\nHopefully should be compatable with whichever female body you prefer, confirmed working with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6667]4uDIKs[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6709]DIMONIZED UNP female body[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Not Compatible:[/b]\r\nNot at all compatible with Amazing Follower Tweaks if you are a male PC.\r\nMajor alignment / clipping issues with Better males - Beautiful nudes and faces - New hairstyles, still works but the clipping is not pretty.\r\n\r\n[b]Install:[/b]\r\n1. Uninstall FNIS 2.1 & delete 0_master.hkx, defaultmale.hkx and defaultfemale.hkx\r\n2. Download [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11811]Fores New Idles in Skyrim (Behavior Files 3.x)[/url], I would strongly recommend a manual install\r\n3. Unzip the NBP zip file into your skyrim data directory.\r\n4. Activate the esp using the skyrim launcher.\r\n5. Run GenerateFNISforUsers.exe ( if you can\\'t find this then NMM probably broke your install, download FNIS again, manually this time)\r\n6. Play\r\n\r\n[b] Uninstall[/b]\r\n1. Save your game when none of your followers are occupied and not in a tavern.\r\n2. Delete NBP esp and bsa\r\n3. Run GenerateFNISforUsers.\r\n\r\n[b] Update / Save Game Issues:[/b]\r\nThis mod does use quests which can be problematic when updating but the quests used here are short running ones so as long as you only update while you and your followers are not occupied and you are not in a tavern then it should be just fine. I have been saving while the quests are running and haven\\'t had any issues for ages.\r\n\r\n[b]Bugs / Problems:[/b]\r\nSome people don\\'t seem to have a home to go to, so you may just end up loitering around, in that case talk to them and choose the opt out.\r\nA few clients will lock their door when they go home and you can\\'t get in, oops.\r\nSome animations are not available to the player due to collision problems.\r\nFour-poster beds can be problematic, try to avoid those or you will get stuck.\r\nIf you find anything else then add a comment.\r\n\r\n[b]Translations:[/b]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30198]German by TKone[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Credits:[/b]\r\nMany thanks to JoshNZ ([url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10748]JoshNZ\\'s AP[/url]) and theroll ([url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6786]Forbidden Romance[/url]) for allowing me to use their animations without which this mod would be completely pointless. \r\nAnd thanks to Gambit 77, Tr1dae, TheRu, DualSun, HothTrooper, Bingle, OmegaRed, RainofChaos for animations/resources.\r\nThanks to Fore for being the first to make new animations possible.\r\n\r\n[b]Spoilers:[/b]\r\n[color=#333333]\r\nThere are 4 animations, some need you to have a follower active before they work.\r\nThere are different sound files for different voice types so its worth pimping whoever you can.\r\nYou can pimp your followers outside in most towns.\r\nYour followers can tell you how many clients they have had.\r\nYour client needs more stamina than you before you will O.\r\nIf you O then you leave the client some souvenir panties.\r\nIf you have a follower while you are on the job then they may get a little excited too.\r\nWhen your follower has serviced 10 clients they will start to find clients for themselves ( in inns only ) and will try to recruit tavern wenches to the cause.\r\nIf your follower has a few more clients than you then you become her bitch until you settle the score.\r\nFathers are not impressed if you try to pimp their daughters.\r\nThe new girl in the Winking Skeever will betray male players at 20 clients then other girls may defect too.\r\n[/color]\r\n",
