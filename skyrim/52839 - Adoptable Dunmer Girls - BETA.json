  "descriptionHtml": "My first upload - requires Zazimel&#39;s Drow Race, Dragonborn, and Hearthfire to function properly. Xvision Children is currently a master file as well, but I have a feeling it does not need to be. Please let me know if there are any bugs, esp. regarding the custom race and the way it displays.\r<br />\r<br />Adoptable boys will be available soon - if there is any demand I will also make a Cyrillic transliteration for speakers of Russian/Bulgarian etc. Bonus if anyone understands the origin of the names.\r<br />\r<br />Nazeli lives in the New Gnisis Cornerclub, serving as a cleaner, and Sireli lives in the Raven Rock Abandoned House with Bralsa Drel.\r<br />\r<br />Known bugs:\r<br />- Nazeli has a bad habit of drinking, and grows two feet when she sits on the barstool at the cornerclub. Removing this feature would entail that I remove her &#34;ambient&#34; AI, and besides, it&#39;s amusing.\r<br />- Both children may not move to your home after you adopt them. If this is the case, prompt your spouse to move to another home, and then move back to your original house, and the children should be there. Not how to fix this, but it seems to be common among custom adoptables.",
