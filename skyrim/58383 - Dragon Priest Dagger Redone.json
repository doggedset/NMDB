  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wished that the Dragon Priest Dagger was just a little stealthier looking? I&#39;ve always liked it; it looks like an artifact ripped from the bones of the earth at the beginning of time in a shadowy hall with blood on the floor and walls, and yet I haven&#39;t seen any retextures of this cool dagger on the nexus or anywhere else. I&#39;ve simply retextured it to suit a stealthy character, given it an improvement recipe and changed its stats to match an ebony dagger. It&#39;s no longer that strange copper color; instead it&#39;s a darkish gray.Â You&#39;ll still need to find one however; smithing one yourself would make it a 4th era fake, not an ancient artifact with a bloody history of unspeakable deeds&#33; I hope you like it; my texturing skills are very limited however, and I likely won&#39;t be taking any requests to change it. Anyone with Fallout Mod Manager, Gimp 2.0 and the DDS plugin could make this in about 10 minutes; I did. Any rebalancing can also be done by you with the Creation Kit in about 5 minutes, so I won&#39;t be fiddling around with that either. Let me know in the comments if this fulfilled your wildest dreams or is the shabbiest excuse for a mod you&#39;ve ever seen; either way, at least you saw it&#33; ;)\r<br />\r<br />If you want to make a better version, go ahead, and send me the link&#33;",
