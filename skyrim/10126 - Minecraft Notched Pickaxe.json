  "descriptionHtml": "This adds an item to the game called Notch\\'s Pickaxe. Base damaage is buffed to 9, other stats are the same as the notched pickaxe. You can find it right where the notched pickaxe used to be. The original still exists - it is now moved to a less noticable cliff face to the right of where Notch\\'s Pickaxe can be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n0.03 - fixed issue for players who had already gotten the orignal notched pickaxe - if you return to the throat of the world Notch\\'s Pickaxe will still be there.\r\n0.02 - switched to discreet item, fixed other pickaxes looking like Notch\\'s Pickaxe in 1st person mode.\r\n0.01 - brand new pickaxe model and texture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned: Add craftable, fix mining animation to use Notch\\'s axe if you have it, fix blood texture model",
