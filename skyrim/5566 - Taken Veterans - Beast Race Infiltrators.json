  "summary": "The Infiltrator is an artist of the ambush.\r\nStart the game at level 30, knowing only a few select spells and skills & without any gold or equipment! Things will not be easy--Skyrim has leveled up too, & this will be a whole new adventure.\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "Taken Veterans - Balanced Character Builds\r\n\r\nShank the Male Argonian\r\nSnee the Female Argonian\r\nSpike the Male Kahjiit\r\nSliver the Female Kahjiit\r\n\r\nMeet the Beast-Race Infiltrators. Artists of the ambush, these shadow walkers use Illusion magic to remain unseen and unheard as they eliminate the opposition one sneak attack at a time.\r\n\r\nThe Infiltrator loves a challenge, and lives for the rush of the close up critical strike. Chaotic Neutral in outlook, they relish any opportunity to shake up the system, if only just a little bit. In fact they were on their way to Skyrim to do just that, when they were picked up and placed on this cart full of prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe Infiltrator has 29 unallocated Perk Points, 240 Magicka, 200 Health, and 150 Stamina\r\n\r\nBeast Infiltrator Initial Skill Ranks:\r\nSneak, Illusion, One-Handed 75\r\nAlchemy, Pickpocket, Lockpicking, Speech, Light Armor 50\r\nConjuration, Heavy Armor, Two-Handed, Destruction, Enchanting, Block, Smithing, Restoration, Alteration, Archery 15\r\n\r\n3*(75*76/2) + 5*(50*51/2) + 10*(15*16/2)\r\n= 16,125 [url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Total Experience Spent In Skills[/url]\r\n\r\nBeast Infiltrator Initial Spell Arsenal:\r\n\tMuffle, Frenzy, Rally, Invisibility, Pacify, Rout\r\n\r\nBeast Infiltrator Shouts:\r\n\tThrow Voice (Zul Mey Gut)\r\n\tMarked for Death (Krii Lun Aus)\r\n\r\nBeast Infiltrator Powers:\r\n\tProwler\\'s Profit (Hidden but active. Find many more jewels.)\r\n\t\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n2.0 Fixed egregious math error. Added Powers and Shouts\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhenever a character earns a rank, r, in a skill they gain r experience. So when a character has 0 in all skills they have zero experience, and when they have 100 in all skills, at level 81.5, they have 90,900 experience. A level 30 character should have about 15,865 total experience summed from their skills.\r\n\r\nTaken Veterans should look good with any texture or mesh mods you may use, if any. The mods used in the screenshots include:\r\nFace Textures (Female): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3563]Coverwomen[/url]\r\nFace Textures (Male): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=26]Detailed Faces[/url]\r\n\r\nLook in the discussions area for the batch commands allowing you to make a veteran out of a character you\\'ve created yourself!\r\n\r\nMore Info:\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Experience Table[/url]\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimCharBatch]Tips on making your own veterans[/url]\r\n\r\nDrop a Taken Veteran save game in your Saves folder and load it up.
