  "descriptionHtml": "(Note: I forgot to rename her into &#34;Fanabi.&#34; She is currently &#34;Prisoner.&#34; Please rename her using &#39;showracemenu&#39;&#33;)This mod adds a brand-new save game - a cute half-elf (original race Breton) girl&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This is my first-ever mod. Well, save game. I tried pretty hard to make her as cute as possible, with a very little mod list. It adds a female save game, breton with elf ears, to the game. Whomp. It&#39;s from the beginning. If you want, I can give a later save game (I&#39;m still playing it currently) but&#33; It will require more mods.\r<br />\r<br />Please add your own screenshots- mine always mess up due to terribad formatting, so I can&#39;t really upload any.

If anyone wants to help with it, please send me a message&#33;&#33; I&#39;d like her to have custom voice acting, and maybe a quest behind her.\r<br />\r<br />Please report any issues/bugs in the comments, and I hope you like her&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Thank you to:\r<br />dimon99 for their beautiful body mod,\r<br />Kalilies and Stealthic Chaos for the lovely hair,\r<br />Hello Santa for the normal maps,\r<br />nouserhere for the elven ears,\r<br />SkyUI Team for the amazing new UI system,\r<br />xp32 for the new skeleton,\r<br />HHaleyy for the textures,\r<br />nerune for the eyes,\r<br />and Arthmoor for the welcome new starting mod.\r<br />\r<br />Please contact me if you would like my full mod list&#33;&#33;",
