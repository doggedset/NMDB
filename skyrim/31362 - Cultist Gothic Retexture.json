  "descriptionHtml": "another simple retexture. To be honest I thought the cultists would have looked alot cooler then they did. I have no idea what Beth was thinking making them look like they rolled around in the Ash and dirt of the world. They should strike fear! Not show you how poor they are XD\r\n\r\nNow I just hope someone makes a mod that alows the weight slider to work on this armor\r\n\r\nUse the NMM\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nManual: Drop the meshes and textures into your data folder\r\n\r\n*Please don\\'t reupload\r\n\r\nMy Bloodskal Mod as see in the pictures: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31359/",
