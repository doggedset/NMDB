I\\\\\\'m obviously talking about their wings. People call me \\\\\\\"Luna the Raider\\\\\\\". Why you ask? Everybody, except the guards and the Jarls, knows that I always steal something precious at a Jarl\\\\\\'s Longhouse, as well as tons of other things around the cities, especially at rich people\\\\\\'s house, like the Black-Briar\\\\\\'s. But all I want is to share my adventures with somebody who\\\\\\'s like me. Not a thief, an adventurer. Oh but if this person is a thief as well, I\\\\\\'d be glad to share my knowledge with him/her.\\\\\\\"\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.flickr.com/photos/101839874@N05/9761062743/[/img]\r\nThe Frozen Hearth, Winterhold\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.flickr.com/photos/101839874@N05/9760783141/[/img]\r\n[color=grey][b] NONE!
