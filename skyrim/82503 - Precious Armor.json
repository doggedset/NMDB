Producing of heavy armor needs a lot of time, resources and skills, so it just can&#39;t be so cheap as it is in game&#33;  What is the point of crafting heavy armor if you get 50-100 septims of income at the end??\r<br />From now one heavy armor became  realy expensive&#33; If you got it as a reward, found it in your adventures or just crafted it, you can gain a lot of money selling it to a merchant&#33;\r<br />\r<br />As the armor became more expensive, regular bandits and other criminal scum can&#39;t no longer have a good quality armor. So after you defeat him you will probably find some kind of rusty old armor on his body. Now you will need your speechraft skills to get good money from trader for it.
