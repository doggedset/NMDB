  "descriptionHtml": "After spending a few hours trying to find a guide to what Battle Hardened Warpaints replaced which vanilla ones, I decided to just sit down and put one together myself. Each of these files has male and female reference shots of each warpaint, renamed to match that paint&#39;s file. Included are [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34539/?]Diethardt&#39;s Battle Hardened Warpaints[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21081/?]Xenius&#39; Morrowind Warpaints[/url], and [http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29977/?]Xenius&#39; hi-res Warpaint and Dirt[/url]. All credit goes to the mod authors; I just took the screenshots.",
