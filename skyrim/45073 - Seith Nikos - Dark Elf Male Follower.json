People have been having problems and I know what the reason for these problems is but I don&#39;t know how to fix it nor can I be bothered to do anything about it. Manually installing the mod should get it to work.)\r<br />\r<br />My first ever mod, couldn&#39;t find an attractive male dark elf for my character to marry so I made my own.\r<br />\r<br />You can find him at the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun walking around in his underpants after indulging a bit too much mead.\r<br />\r<br />I recommend you use:\r<br />Javett&#39;s Less Harsh Elves and mrLenski&#39;s Cover Eyes:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/369//?\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4869/?",
