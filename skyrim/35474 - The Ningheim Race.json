Ningheim usually grow up in secluded areas, with or without protectors. It is not known how a Ningheim Nede comes to existence or where they come from, but folk-lore tells each and every one of them is specially selected by The Nine. They share the same traits as regular Men, though they usually have a striking, almost other-wordly, beauty which is said to be caused by the good health they maintain through their powerful souls. From birth a Ningheim&#39;s soul will change into what eventually become a tool to wield great power, as they are gifted with many abilities that are unfathomable by regular men over the course of their life. With the ability to look into another&#39;s mind, and even their very souls, a Ningheim is always feared no matter if they are good, evil or anything in between. Their gaze alone can break the will of their foes, their magicka can command souls, and with their powerful will they can take on any obstacle.\r<br />\r<br />These are the Ningheim. Powerful warriors sent from the heavens above, sporting both heavenly beauty and terrifying power. There is no set path for a Ningheim. Become one yourself and make your mark on the province of Skyrim and beyond&#33;[/font][/color][/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=4][b][color=firebrick][font=georgia]Vampires[/font][/color][/b][/size]\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/nbEeX3Q.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=brown][font=Georgia]The eyes are of a Ningheim are very precious. A Ningheim relies on his/her sight to perceive the world of the soul. Without eyesight they would lose much of their power. When a Ningheim&#39;s eyesight is impaired, a strange process transforms the eyes to see directly with the soul. A Ningheim will thus never go truly blind, but they will lose their normal eyes if their eyes do get damaged. It has been said that when a Ningheim were to become a vampire their soul would reject the corporeal influence by transforming the eyes before they get tainted and they will retain their normal facial features.[/font][/color][/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=5][font=georgia][color=lavender][b]The race&#39;s features[/b][/color][/font][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][font=georgia][list][color=#669999]\r<br />[*] [b]Works with the new Dragonborn DLC and every other official Skyrim DLC&#33;[/b]\r<br />[*] Face and body textures by Hellosanta, Urshi with special updates and changes specially made for this race.\r<br />[*] Exclusive alternative female face textures by m0ckin9bird for more character creation options.\r<br />[*] Includes [b][u]56+[/u][/b] [b][i]new[/i][/b] eye types and [b][u]63[/u][/b] [b][i]new[/i][/b] highly-detailed eyebrows made by Hvergelmir from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30411/]Brows[/url] and Pikkatze from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1971]Smooth Faces for Ladies and Gents[/url].\r<br />[*] 24 New warpaint types made by TairenSoul from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25211]TairenSoul Face Tattoo Warpaint[/url], exclusively for this race.\r<br />[*] Custom complexions with 3 new HD Dirt options.\r<br />[*] Comes with built-in [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34346]Smile in HD[/url] by Zzjay.\r<br />[*] All new head meshes and head morphs for a totally new and refreshing look never found before in a custom race up till now.\r<br />[*] Fully stand-alone body meshes and skeletons for that extra bit of customization.\r<br />[*] Of course full support for DG and non-DG Vampires and Werewolves.

At an early age Jared was taken to Falkreath hold by the Jarl of Falkreath after they found out he was a Ningheim.\r<br />      The woods around Falkreath are dangerous, and one gifted with Ningheim power would do the city well. He was taken in by priest of Arkay, and trained by the guards to fight with large two-handed swords and heavy armor.[/font]      Prefers Heavy Armor and Two-handed weapons.      Located in [spoiler][size=1][s]Falkreath&#39;s House of Arkay.[/s][/size][/spoiler]         [*][b]Keniel[/b]\r<br />      [font=georgia]Raised an assassin to earn a living with his fast Ningheim senses. Keniel is a man who likes to deal with things discretely and doesn&#39;t care for much of the material world. All he sees are survival and people to count on or to kill. However, he would never kill just for the fun of it nor is he easily angered.\r<br />      He is lightning-fast, yet silent and prefers to use the bow before drawing his sword. Knowing he is a Ningheim he has always felt disconnected with the others around him, but another of his kind would surely fascinate him.[/font]      Prefers Light Armor, Bows and One-handed weapons.      Located in [spoiler][size=1][s]Windhelm&#39;s Candlehearth Hall.[/s][/size][/spoiler]         [*][b]Ezau[/b]\r<br />      [font=georgia]Ezau is a Ningheim who wanders the province doing quests along the way to earn a living. He has an indifferent personality, and doesn&#39;t care about the things that happen around him or to others. He only cares for himself.\r<br />      Though Ezau knows he is a Ningheim he usually doesn&#39;t make it obvious that he is and likes to use the power he has gained through this heritage to surprise his enemies and to manipulate the minds of others for his own good.[/font]      Uses whatever armor and weapon is available to him. Can also use a variety of spells.      Located in [spoiler][size=1][s]Solitude&#39;s Winking Skeever.[/s][/size][/spoiler]         [*][b]Teclis[/b]\r<br />      [font=georgia]With a Nord father and a Redguard mother, Teclis is one of the more unusual Ningheim around. His darker skin, heavy build and dark hair are an uncommon sight among Ningheim yet make him a very interesting figure.\r<br />      Teclis is a hunter by profession, and honors all living creatures. He will only kill if necessary to his survival and that of his friends. Loyality is one of his strong points, but he will always put justice infront of anything.\r<br />      He lives a peaceful life in the woods between Falkreath and Markarth.[/font]      Prefers Light Armor, and Bows.      Located in [spoiler][size=1][s]Hunter&#39;s Rest near Falkreath.[/s][/size][/spoiler]         [*][b]Emil[/b]\r<br />      A knight in a shining armor - that&#39;s what people see in him whenever he shows up. The spikey-haired young Ningheim is a sight for sore eyes to many, but those who saw him on the road knew better - a silent and burdened man.      Emil had a tough childhood with strict masters who taught him how to use his powers and to improve his skills. Although he admitted - only to himself - it was necessary and useful, he made off right after he reached adulthood. Emil now lives in a secluded shack on the mountain closing out his past and hiding from his future.      He is a skilled warrior with a kind heart who protects and helps those in need. However he is not overzealous - other&#39;s petty problems are not his to solve.      Prefers Heavy Armor and One-handed weapons.      Located in [spoiler][size=1][s]Cliffside Retreat between Markarth and Solitude.[/s][/size][/spoiler][/list]\r<br />         \r<br />[size=4][b]FEMALE[/b][/size][list]\r<br />   [*][b]Helena[/b]\r<br />      [font=georgia]Helena is a devoted student at the College of Winterhold who excells in the art of Magicka. She is a reliable fighter who uses fire magic to take down her opponents.\r<br />      Helena has a fiery temper just as her fire magic would suggest. She isn&#39;t afraid of a fight and doesn&#39;t like being looked down upon. This often makes her clash with her teachers at the College, but luckily they see she is worth keeping as student.[/font]      Prefers clothing or light armor and uses magic.      Located in [spoiler][size=1][s]The College of Winterhold&#39;s Arcanaeum.[/s][/size][/spoiler]         [*][b]Farah[/b]\r<br />      [font=georgia]A calm and collected girl, Farah is an exotic beauty to behold even though she is of Ningheim birth. She was raised a hunter, but when her parents became more sucessful in business her life became less exciting and she was eventually trained in the use of two-handers and heavy armor.\r<br />      Out in teh wild she still often reaches for her bow before taking the heavy two-handed sword she carries around with her. Bored with her posh new life, she decides to go out hunting near Whiterun again.[/font]      Prefers Heavy Armor, Two-Handed weapons and Bows.      Located in [spoiler][size=1][s]Whiterun&#39;s Drunken Huntsman Inn.[/s][/size][/spoiler]         [*][b]Alexia[/b]\r<br />      [font=georgia]Alexia was raised in good conditions by her parents, who are also Ningheim. They have chosen to not develop their Ningheim power, and left Alexia unaware of her heritage.\r<br />      By profession Alexia is a Ranger who hunts down criminals for a living. Alexia never cared much for the city life and Jarls pay good money for the bounties a ranger can collect.[/font]      Prefers Light Armor, and Bows.      Wanders between [spoiler][size=1][s]Ivarstead&#39;s Vilemyr Inn (night-time), Alchemist&#39;s Shack, Honeystrand Cave, and the Rift Imperial Camp. All in the vincinity of Ivarstead.[/s][/size][/spoiler]         [*][b]Rhavaniel[/b]\r<br />      [font=georgia]Rhavaniel got rescued out of the burning home of her parents by the great High Elven wizard Calcelmo who took her with him to Markath. There she grew up learning what ancient knowledge she could gather from him. \r<br />      In her early teen days Calcelmo - who often wondered about her rapidly growing beauty and intellectual abilities - found out that she was a Ningheim and from that day on he feared the hidden power which was still concealed behind her youthful appearance.\r<br />      As he began to hide magical knowledge from her a shadow grew between them and she started to practice her skills with all kinds of blades with the captain of Calcelmo&#39;s guard who admired her beauty. She quickly surpassed him by far in the handling of all kinds of weapons.\r<br />      Elven-wise, a mighty soul blessed by the divines, handsome and dangerous Rhavaniel is waiting for the day her true power and destiny might be reveiled by a wink of fate. \r<br />      Rumors say, a Dragonborn has arisen out of the mist of this dark and warwounded country. Maybe he will become the herald of her future...[/font]      Prefers Heavy Armor and One-Handed Blades.      Located in [spoiler][size=1][s]The Great Hall of Understone Keep in Markath.[/s][/size][/spoiler]         [*][b]Mandei[/b]\r<br />      [font=georgia]Mandei is the daughter of two traders who live in Riften. Even though she has everything she could wish for, she longs for adventure. Mandei has signed up as Riften Guard Volunteer to help keep watch near the border of the province of Riften.\r<br />      This way she can still experience a form of adventure. There are always enough criminals lurking near Riften, not to mention the creatures that roam in the forests.[/font]      Prefers Light Armor, and One-Handed weapons.      Located in [spoiler][size=1][s]Shor&#39;s Watchtower.[/s][/size][/spoiler][/list]\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/Bq6f5Jx.jpg[/img]\r<br />[color=lavender][center][font=georgia][b][size=5]Notes[/size][/b][/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT:    Upon switching to The Ningheim race make sure it has loaded correctly by seeing if you can select all vanilla Nord hairstyles, and hairstyles from hair mods. If this isn&#39;t the case, don&#39;t continue and reload the game to select the race again.\r<br />            This must work for the race to properly work well with vampire/werewolf transformations.\r<br />            \r<br />   If you&#39;re using RaceMenu by Expired then upon selecting a female preset it will always revert the Head Scale back to 1.0. This should be set to 1.1 so your characters don&#39;t have small heads. Vanilla females have a head scale of 1.1 too.\r<br />   \r<br />   The men have some &#34;empty&#34; nose/mouth morphs at the end of their slider. This is because the females have new nose and mouth morphs in those slots.\r<br />   \r<br />   You&#39;ll always have some odd scars/eyes/eyebrows on the females, because they are vanilla scars/eyes/eyebrows which have different meshes from The Ningheim&#39;s. These couldn&#39;t be removed from the race without breaking the mod.\r<br />   \r<br />   Switching an existing non-Ningheim character&#39;s race to that of The Ningheim is [u]NOT[/u] recommended and supported. Amongst the most important bugs it will break vampire and werewolf transformation, since those always revert your character back to its first set race (this also happens when switching between vanilla races).\r<br />   \r<br />   [u]Unless mentioned in the file download description[/u], you never have to clean save or create a new character to use a newer version of the race. A special script updating system has been made for this race to ensure every aspect of the scripts be updated at any given time without the need for clean saving or a new game.[/color]\r<br />   \r<br />   [center][img]http://www.dovahtracker.com/images/MODTRACKED.png[/img][/center]   \r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/PFRj0Pf.jpg[/img]\r<br />[color=lavender][center][font=georgia][b][size=5]Recommended mods[/size][/b][/font][/center][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=lavender][font=georgia][b][size=4]Menu mods[/size][/b][/font][/color]\r<br />[list][*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29624]RaceMenu by Expired[/url] [b][color=red]Absolute must&#33;[/color][/b] [color=lavender]Now comes with TWO new Ningheim morph sets for endless face editing possibilities.

This can cause a multitude of bugs such as:\r<br />      [list][*] Vampire and/or Werewolf transformation not functioning correctly\r<br />      [*] No additional hair showing up\r<br />      [*] Missing parts of the head or the head itself\r<br />      [*] The fixed DB quest not working\r<br />[/list]\r<br />      You can usually fix these problems by opening your console in-game (tilde-button: ` ) and typing these two separate commands:\r<br />      stopquest NingheimRaceController\r<br />      startquest NingheimRaceController\r<br />\r<br />      This is preferably done in an interior that has nothing to do with the DB quest that was fixed.\r<br />\r<br />   [b]Q:    Where can I find the mod&#39;s files (I want to change its files)?[/b]\r<br />   A:    The mod&#39;s files can be found in the following folders:\r<br />         - skyrim/data/meshes/actors/character/Ningheim\r<br />         - skyrim/data/textures/actors/character/Ningheim\r<br />         - skyrim/data/sound&#92;fx&#92;Ningheim\r<br />         - in skyrim/data/scripts all the scripts which names start with &#34;Ningheim&#34;.\r<br />      \r<br />   [b]Q:    I want more facial sliders, like ECE/CharGen Extension gives&#33;[/b]\r<br />   A:    Get [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36925]CharGen Extension[/url] + one of the two Ningheim Morphs for endless face editing options&#33;\r<br />      \r<br />   [b]Q:    What mods are used in some of the screenshots?[/b]\r<br />   A:    Some I don&#39;t know and others I can&#39;t share the link for. You&#39;ll have to search yourself.\r<br />\r<br />   [b]Q:    I used the &#34;showracemenu&#34; command in the console to change my character to your race and I&#39;m experiencing problems.[/b]\r<br />   A:    Don&#39;t use showracemenu and just make a new character. For example, it messes up your stats and it also makes the werewolf transition not work properly.\r<br />      There is also a good alternative mod for the showracemenu command: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20394 .\r<br />\r<br />   [b]Q:    I&#39;m using a mod that adds armor/clothing/necklaces/rings and some of them don&#39;t show up&#33;[/b]\r<br />   A:    That mod&#39;s author probably did not include the Default Race to the list of races that can use his/her mod. Contact the author for a fix or do it yourself in the CK by going to Items-&gt;ArmorAddons and look for pieces that belong to the mod. Open such an item and on the right-hand you&#39;ll have a list of valid races. Click the race called &#34;DefaultRace&#34;, press OK and save.\r<br />   \r<br />   [b]Q:    I can&#39;t load the followers in the CK. When I do it crashes or doesn&#39;t load properly. What now?[/b]\r<br />   A:    &#34;The Ningheim - Followers.esp&#34; uses &#34;The Ningheim.esp&#34; as master. You&#39;ll have to generate a &#34;The Ningheim[b].esm[/b]&#34; using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1840]Wrye Bash[/url], and then change the followers&#39; plugin&#39;s &#34;The Ningheim.esp&#34; to &#34;The Ningheim.esm&#34; using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25859//?]TES5Edit[/url].

Saved them again in the CK for correct ESP versioning. Wrye bash users won&#39;t get a warning anymore. Plugin stabilized as it prevents crashes due to version mismatches in CK and game.\r<br />V1.1 -    Last few forms corrected thanks to Uglykidcid.\r<br />      Changed all texture paths in every body mesh to an absolute path that points Ningheim textures. This is done to help prevent potential unneeded body seams.\r<br />      Revised installer. More body options for female, with choice in scars, pubic hair, body toning, and scar definition.
