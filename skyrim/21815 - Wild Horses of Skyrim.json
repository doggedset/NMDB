  "descriptionHtml": "The latest addition to my creature mods selection sees 100 new wild horses added into Skyrim. These are compressed into about thirty flocks spread around Skyrim. You will find them outside Ustengrad, in the swamp around the abandoned shack, in Bleakwind Basin, and in the forests around Riften. A small warning, these horses are very suspicious; its fine to observe from a distance , but get too close and they will attack.",
