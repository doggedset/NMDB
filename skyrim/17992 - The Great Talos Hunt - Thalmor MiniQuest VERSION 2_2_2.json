  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#DB7900][center][b][size=26]The Great Talos Hunt - Thalmor MiniQuest[/size][/b][/center][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1102.photobucket.com/albums/g449/Helix341/TESV2012-06-1311-44-09-56.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=10][b][color=blue] 1st Nov 2012 I don\\'t have the time to continue work on this mod at the moment. If you want to take it on, please pm me, and I\\'ll give you permissions and all that stuff. Just tell me what kind of direction you\\'ll take it in, will be on a first come, first served basis! Thanks, Helix341[/color][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[u]Description:[/u]\r\nI felt that the Thalmor weren\\'t expanded upon as much as they should have been in Skyrim. Therefore, I have created this mod to add a new side quest revolving around them. In this mod, the Thalmor have hidden bases in Skyrim, and are rooting out Talos worshippers. As Dragonborn, it is your task to find clues as to where they are located, and then remove them and their associates from their hidden bases. JUST TO CLEAR SOMETHING UP: This is a quest where the Thalmor are the enemies, and you are hunting them down. This is for Stormcloak characters primarily - in the future, I may make a reverse quest so to speak, where you help the Thalmor hunt down Talos worshippers.\r\n\r\n[b][u]TO START THE QUEST: Enter Whiterun, and, unless you are using Open Cities, there should be an NPC wearing a priest robe by the bridge. If you speak to him, he will initiate the quest (he is not voiced yet, but will be soon). He is also a follower, just for lore-friendliness (saving Talos worshippers, makes sense to have a priest of Talos with you. He uses shouts (as he is a Talos priest) and spells, and is a reasonable follower.[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[color=red][b][size=3] If you like the mod, please either comment or endorse the mod (or both!) - It lets me know how the mod is doing and what needs to be improved! Thanks! [/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[u]Installation:[/u]\r\n-Use [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/content/modmanager]Nexus Mod Manager[/url]\r\nor\r\n*Extract the contents of the .7z file into a temporary location\r\n*Place everyting except the readme into the Data folder in your Skyrim install (probably\r\nsomething like C:\\\\Username\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim). If you already have\r\nmeshes and textures folders, just merge the to together.\r\n*Make sure that GreatTalosHunt.esp is enabled in your Data Files section in the startup menu (should\r\nbe automatically, but its best to check ;)\r\n*Play!\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE: The BSA was not working properly, so if you downloaded it, please download the non BSA version, otherwise you will get grey faces and no quest scripting! :([/b]\r\n\r\n[u]Conflicts:[/u]\r\n-This mod will conflict with any mods that edit Dragonsreach (possibly), The New Gnisis Cornerclub or Beggar\\'s Row. I recommend temporarily disabling these mods (if they even exist!) until you have finished using them for this quest, and then enabling them again.\r\n-This mod requires Update.esm to be active a.k.a. the latest version of Skyrim\r\n-If you have any Breezehome mods, please place them lower down in the load order than this one. Unless you want my little Breezehome renovation. Which in all honesty is just a fix for something I broke earlier.\r\n-Not a conflict, but I don\\'t advise that you use Open Cities for the duration of playing this mod. It just makes things easier, as I have added things in the cities that open cities moves (they are still there though, so gameplay is possible)\r\n\r\n[u]Things you might miss![/u]\r\nAside from the main quest, there are a couple of Easter Egg stype things, just to add more Thalmor contents\r\n*Markarth: There is a new merchant there, who seems to be selling books...could any of them be \\\"interesting\\\" to read?\r\n*There are three Thalmor patrols, in Falkreath Hold, Whiterun Hold and The Rift. Killing them is fun!\r\n*Due to my breaking of Breezehome in the early stages of the mod, I have now given it a slight renovation - there is now an enchanting table!\r\n\r\n[u]:Changelog:[/u]\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n*The first one!\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n*Stopped Rulon killing everyone!\r\n*Added Eastmarch Camp\r\n*Moved Ulandil from Breezehome, so Breezehome mods will now work!\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2\r\n*Added Thalmor Blackreach Hideout, and necessary clues\r\n*Ulandil and Rulon should attack you, but no-one else (should - please let me know\r\nif they don\\'t behave properly)\r\n*Added Boss NPC - General Vanyar. He is very hard to kill, so be ready for a good\r\nfight!\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3\r\n*Made Vanyar wear his mask\r\n*Added extra \\\"Elite Thalmor\\\" to the dungeon\r\n*Edited Legate Dungun a bit\r\n*Found a temporary solution to the elevator problem\r\n*Improved Lieutenants Narfil\\'s armor\r\n*Fixed the floating bed problem\r\n*Some other minor fixes, mainly to NPC stats\r\n\r\nVersion 1.4\r\n*Major improvements to Eastmarch and The Rift Thalmor Camps\r\n*Slight Tweaking of Lietenant Narfil\\'s weapon set\r\n*A few slight fixes regarding the Blackreach Dungeon\r\n*More fixes to the elevator!\r\n\r\nVersion 1.5\r\n*Added a few Thalmor outside Raldbthar\r\n*Made Update.esm a master file\r\n\r\nVersion 2.1 (Major Update!)\r\n*Added Quest scripting - now you should get more detailed instructions\r\n*Updated Vanyar\\'s combat settings (made him harder!)\r\n*Added a new merchant in Markarth, who sells amusing Thalmor propoganda (worth a read, just to see how\r\nstupid they are!)\r\n*Sorted the Breezehome issue mentioned in the comments - the alchemy room has not been restored, but\r\n\\\"rennovated\\\", with an alchemy table, arcane enchanter, containers and a guard!\r\n*Fixed the grey face bug, because it was annoying me.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.2\r\n*Added Argnvund, a Talos priest who starts the quest when you enter Whiterun (not completely voiced yet,\r\nthat will come in a later update)\r\n*BSA version added!\r\n\r\n*End of Helix341 development*\r\n\r\n[u]Future Updates:[/u]\r\n*Temporarily suspended until new staff can be found (see above)\r\n\r\n[u]FAQ (WIP)[/u]\r\n[i]Does this quest mean I join the Thalmor?[/i]\r\n-No. This quest is against the Thalmor, merely adding more so that you can kill them. This is a mod for [color=red]Talos[/color] supporters!\r\n\r\n[i]I don\\'t know where to go![/i]\r\n-Download the latest version! There is now quest scripting with markers and stuff :D\r\n\r\n[i]I don\\'t know how to install the mod! [/i]\r\n-Read the installation section of this page. Or the readme.\r\n\r\n[i]The bones in Raldbthar are floating[/i]\r\n-That\\'s not my fault - thats an original game bug. I didn\\'t touch Raldbthar, I just advise you to use that route down to Blackreach, as the Thalmor base is right next to the Raldbthar Blackreach Entrance.\r\n\r\n[u]What To Do if you have Questions[/u]\r\n-Check the FAQ - however, it\\'s still a WIP, so it\\'s highly possible that you have questions\r\n-Check the comments section - It is likely that other people have been having the same problem, in which case it is something that I need to fix.\r\n-If no one else has your problem, then it is likely a problem on your computer - Unfortunately, I can\\'t do anything about that!\r\n\r\n[color=red]Great Turkish translation by ekonm - [/color]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18631\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1102.photobucket.com/albums/g449/Helix341/TESV2012-06-1311-49-26-25.jpg[/img]",
