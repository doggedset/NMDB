  "descriptionHtml": "[i]This mod adds the intrepid Sir Hach to Winterhold. Custom Voiced, Full Back-story, Spear.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]lwVudod3bwI[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[i]&#34;True honor is not about doing the right thing, but doing the right thing when no one is watching.&#34; - Sir Hach[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[b] Summary:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Sir Hach and his employer Trenton can both be found at the Jarls Longhouse in Winterhold.\r<br />Sir Hach is a 2-handed tank that has a unique tunic/gloves/spear/book that can easily take out a giant, and morality isn&#39;t a problem for him.\r<br />Currently, there are no new quests, but Hach has an interesting book you can read.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b] Compatibility:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />&bull; Confirmed to be Compatible With :\r<br />- Amazing Follower Tweaks\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b] F.A.Q:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />  Q: Sir Hach and/or Trenton&#39;s voice(s) are low quality/sound like a radio, can you fix this?\r<br />  A: Sir Hach&#39;s voice has been updated in version 1.02&#33;\r<br />      Since Trenton is a fairly minor character, I didn&#39;t update him, maybe later.\r<br />\r<br /> Q: Sir Hach&#39;s power level is not what I want it to be, how do I change this?\r<br /> A: He&#39;s meant to be tough seasoned warrior in the vanilla game, if you use SkyRe, the reproccer should adjust his tunic and spear. I have not looked into compatibility with other overhauls.\r<br />\r<br /> Q: Sir Hach does not utter a battle cry in combat, for shame&#33; Can this be changed?\r<br /> A:  Yes, bring up your console by pressing ~ (Key above Tab) and type:\r<br />    [i] set SAM_SirHachBattleCry to 1[/i]\r<br />      By default, it&#39;s at 0 to suit Hach&#39;s personality, but options are nice.\r<br />\r<br /> Q: Sir Hach is not at my side, he&#39;s either gotten stuck in an abyss or is off-duty, and I need his help. Is there a quick way I can get him back?\r<br /> A:  Yes, when you first unlock him as a companion, you gain a power called &#34;Summon Sir Hach&#34;.\r<br />\r<br /> Q: Will there be updates in the future? \r<br /> A: Most likely, perhaps a quest, and more added to &#39;Tales of Old&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />[b] Credits:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />&bull; Thynar for the boring parts.\r<br />\r<br />&bull; The Radiant Spear model was made by Solusphere, check out his work at: http://blackspherestudios.com/\r<br />\r<br />&bull; Sir Hach is voiced by DonutsStrongJaw.\r<br />\r<br />&bull; Trenton is voiced by Trenton.\r<br />\r<br />&bull; Inspired by Avernum, Eschalon, Lord of the Rings, League of Legends, Battle for Wesnoth and Game of Thrones&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Available on Steam:\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=198219402",
