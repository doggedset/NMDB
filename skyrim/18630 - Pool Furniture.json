  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/18630-1-1339480531.jpg[/img]This is a small stand alone mod that adds 4 pieces of New, &#34;Lore Unfriendly&#34;, Pool/Beach furniture into Skyrim. Just for fun.\r<br />   (It will Not overwrite anything vanilla)\r<br />\r<br />ESM contains; \r<br />1 pool raft (laydown) \r<br />4 colors included\r<br />1 beach towel (laydown)\r<br />1 beach towel w/rolled towel for pillow (laydown)\r<br />1 folded towel (sit ledge). \r<br />4 towel textures included (work with any of towels above)\r<br />\r<br />ESP includes;\r<br />Some of these items placed in and around the water outside DragonsReach in Whiterun. Chosen because it is an easy place to show them to you.\r<br />\r<br />Also included in file;\r<br />1 script to make Pool raft work for &#34;Players&#34; (script source also included)\r<br />PSDs for raft and towels are also included in the textures folder, for those who want to make additional textures.\r<br />\r<br />All are useable by both the player and/or NPCs\r<br />All are packaged as an ESM for easy use in other mods, and are drag and drop ready. \r<br />   (the pool raft does require 1 script, in order to be useable by the Player, but only has 1 property to be set), \r<br />   easy to follow instructions included, for new modders.\r<br />\r<br />This is primarily intended as a modders resource, the mod I made them for wont be ready for a while, so I thought I&#39;d release this now, for others to use. \r<br />The included ESP is really just a way for you to check them out.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Changelog:\r<br />v 1.0 Initial release.\r<br />\r<br />Required Files:\r<br />NONE\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Extract the Contents of the &#34;Data&#34; folder to, your skyrimData directory, (typically, C:ProgramfilesSteamSteamAppscommonskyrimData)\r<br />Insure RIP88_Pool_Furniture.ESM, Is turned on.\r<br />To preview the Items,\r<br />Insure RIP88_Pool_Furniture_Sample.ESP Is turned on.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />Remove;\r<br />RIP88_Pool_Furniture.ESM, & RIP88_Pool_Furniture_Sample.ESP from skyrim\r<br />Remove, RIP88  folders from;\r<br />Meshesclutter, Meshesfurniture, and Texturesclutter\r<br />and lastly remove, aaRIP88_MovePlayerOnActivateScript\r<br />from scripts\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues:\r<br />Correct placement of the pool raft is required for NPC&#39;s to use them, And a script must be used in order for &#34;players&#34; to use them.\r<br />   Both issues are due to the fact that the raft is near the surface of the water, and and the actors feet are not.\r<br />   Correct placement of the raft is &#34;6-8 ticks below water level&#34; (see included screenshots), if that&#39;s not clear enough.\r<br />If &#34;Player&#34; lays down in first person, then rotates the camera they turn on the furniture.\r<br />By design, not a bug, I turned off &#34;force 1st person&#34; for screenshot purposes. Just lay down in third person.\r<br />\r<br />Troubleshooting;\r<br />Assuming you have a &#34;package&#34; telling  &#34;NPC x&#34;  to use &#34;raft x&#34; at &#34;time x&#34;\r<br />   If at time x, NPC x just stands where they were, then raft x, is probably placed too high. (they cant reach it)\r<br />   If at time x, NPC x moves near raft x, but wont get on, then height of your raft is fine, (they could reach it so they headed toward it)\r<br />     Try moving your raft a few feet away, not sure why the rafts wont work in some spots, but that&#39;s the symptom.\r<br />\r<br />Incompatibilities:\r<br />RIP88_Pool_Furniture_Sample.ESP will be incompatible with any mod outside dragorsreach in whiterun.\r<br />But its just a sample anyway\r<br />RIP88_Pool_Furniture.ESM should not have any compatibility issues what so ever.\r<br />\r<br />Tools Used:\r<br />Photoshop\r<br />Nifscope\r<br />TESsnip\r<br />Notepad++\r<br />Creation Kit\r<br />\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />Anyone is free to use any part of this mod (that&#39;s what its here for) as long as it for a NON COMERCIAL mod. \r<br />  I would appreciate it if you would message me, with what mod you have used it in so I can check out your work.\r<br />  And a thank you would be nice ;-)\r<br />\r<br />Nobody may upload my mod to any other sites, Repackage and claim it as their work, Profit from the use of &#34;the mod in whole&#34; or any of its assets, or restrict others from using (&#34;their works&#34; &#34;based on my parts&#34;). its just a game folks, lets keep it fun.\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />Bethesda, for another fun game, and the meshes I reused.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks To:\r<br />The awesome modders ahead of me, without their work, I would not have had anything to disect in my quest to learn all this.\r<br />Everyone who answered my dumb questions, as I have not done any modding sense &#34;Tom Clancys Rainbow Six series&#34; some 8 years ago?\r<br />   Especially Fore, and WillieSea\r<br />Everyone who has taken the time to post tutorials on modding and scripting.\r<br />The Makers of NifScope (without whom this wouldn&#39;t be possible)\r<br />The Makers of TESsnip (without whom this wouldn&#39;t be possible)\r<br />\r<br />From the same Warped Mind that brought you;\r<br />A Classier BBLS [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19866]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19866[/url]\r<br />Summer Wear for BBLS  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25237]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25237[/url]\r<br />Bri&#39;s Home          [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37789]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37789[/url]\r<br />Bri - a sexy companion     [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31742]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31742[/url]\r<br />Teddy Bear Shield   [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18845]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18845[/url]",
