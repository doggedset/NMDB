  "summary": "Makes gloves invisible, useful for todays fashionable mages",
  "descriptionHtml": "Started playing a pure mage & really like HQ Nocturnal Robes by Zonzai, however i dislike wearing ugly gloves with it & also dislike not wearing enchanted gloves. What this mod does is it makes gloves invisible for both females & males, which means it is also useful for you fashionable male mages out there.\r\n\r\n---BUG---\r\nMesh for hands will change slightly when equipped, i do not know how to fix so dont ask\r\n\r\n---Extra---\r\nMy original idea was to make the glove model a ring  equipped on your left hand. I have tried for hours but with no success because i suck at meshing with nifscope. If anyone out can do this please share & thanks in advance for your work.",
