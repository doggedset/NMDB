  "descriptionHtml": "Adds two followers, Astraea and Sephiria to Candlehearth Hall. Both are proficient with light armor, archery, sneaking and one handed, and have associated perks. \r\n\r\nFormer mercenaries and political dissidents, they were exiled from the Aldmeri Dominion. Now they are staying at the Candlehearth Hall, trying to figure out their next move. They\\'d be more than willing to follow the Dragonborn if it means they could split open some Thalmor heads.\r\n\r\nREQUIRES SKYRIM 1.8.151.0.7 and APACHII SKYHAIR\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\nThey are pretty high level (around 40), so they are recommended for high-level or endgame characters. \r\n\r\nNo, they are not marriageable, I will try implementing that in possible updates \r\nYes, I know Astraea does not speak some lines of dialogue - Her voice type doesn\\'t have those lines. Otherwise, she is fully voiced.\r\n\r\nCREDITS/PREMISSIONS:\r\n\r\nApachii Skyhairs #29 and #33 used with permission from Apachii\r\n\r\nApachii Shyhair by Apachii (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168)\r\nFaces generated with Enganced Character Edit by tktk1 (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12951)\r\nBethesda for Skyrim and the CK",
