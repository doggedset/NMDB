  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red]Okains Summit[/color]\r\nOkains Summit adds a new Dwemer city in the mountains bordering Morrowind. At the urging of a Dwemer logic engine (computer), the player takes the initiative to organize excavation and rebuilding of the city. To stay lore/mod friendly, the quests attempt to use base games quests as lead-ins while minimize any permanent impact to the wider Skyrim. You\\'ll have a chance to hire crafters and shop keeps (assistants only) from other cities to work in Okains.\r\n\r\nFeedback, suggestions appreciated.
