  "descriptionHtml": "   [size=2]\r<br />I&#39;ve been modding for a while, but this is the first file I&#39;ve posted on the Nexus - please, be gentle, and if you find any bugs or other oopsies, please let me know and I&#39;ll fix them up for you.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4][u][b]The Description:[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />This armor was originally intended to be used in the upcoming &#34;Northguard: Blood of Ysmir&#34; mod. Unfortunately, some set-backs within the team have pushed the project waaaay back, so I figured I would share the armor with everyone since it will be a while before the whole mod is finished and it&#39;s just too fantastic not to let you guys have.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4][u][b]The Facts:[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />The armor can be crafted and tempered. You&#39;ll find it under the leather section at your local forge. It comes with gloves but no boots, since the new mesh has boots attached in it. (It was the only way to get them as cool as they are.) The armor&#39;s stats are fine without wearing any boot items with it, though, so you&#39;ll be good.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc]\r<br />[size=4][u][b]The REAL heroes here (AKA: Credits)[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />The original cuirass is from &#34;Monster Hunter Armor&#34; by Steelsnake12.\r<br />The mashing with the cool new legs/boots and the fixing of the shape was done by Davjes. Check out his other stuff&#33; http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/1735131/?\r<br />The retexture of the sleeves was done by an integral member of the Northguard team: Victor B. Hurt.\r<br />A thank-you to Raynel07 for all his hard work is in order, too.\r<br />Of course, CDProjektRED is to be applauded, for letting us use their models. (They&#39;re to thank for the pants.)\r<br />\r<br />I really only came up with the concept for the armor. These guys are the real champions here. Please go tell them so&#33;",
