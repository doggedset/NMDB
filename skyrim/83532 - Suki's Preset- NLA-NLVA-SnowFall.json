  "summary": "This preset will bring you the scariest of nights to the most loveliest, brightest, and natural of daylight. It will bring some of the best of sunsets and sunrises. The best interiors along with dense fog and heavy rain storms. I Hope you guys enjoy.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Arial][left][/left][center][color=#00ffff][size=4]This preset will change a bit for every update or so I do. Changes from weathers to brightness for certain times of the day and so on and fourth. But the quality will stay the same.\n<br />[/size][/color]Be sure to track this page if you are interested in this preset.[/center]\n<br />[center][/center]\n<br />[color=#f1c232][center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/83532/83532-1518165814-1868330013.jpeg[/img][/center][/color][/font][center](SnowFall)[/center]\n<br />[size=4][center]I would like you guys to know that this file is not just ENB it is also carefully mixed in with SKGE and that is what is gonna make this preset different from the rest. You will have the opportunity to have a few extra effects at a low FPS cost (System Dependent). \n<br />\n<br />I can't really say much about performance hit. It really depends on your system and how you set your ENB file\n<br />I tried my best to make a medium version without much sacrifice to the whole image of the preset. \n<br />I just don't know if it will help or not\n<br />(Somewhere between 14-27fps. Other systems WILL differ from FPS loss)\n<br />\n<br />SKGE is VERY light weight. The effects will be Motion Blur, Injury/Death lens, Underwater Effects, Blended and Saturated Bloom Effects, EXTRA Depth Of Field, and EXTRA Ambient Occlusion.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232]To use SKGE just download with your manager ([/color][color=#cc4125]ALLOW TO OVERWRITE IF IT ASKS[/color][color=#f1c232]) and when in game use the letter '[/color][color=#b45f06]O[/color][color=#f1c232]' on your keyboard to open up or close the GUI menu for SKGE. You must use your [/color][color=#b45f06]arrow keys to move up, down, and either left or right[/color][color=#f1c232] to go into or out of what effect you want to change or leave alone. Press \"[/color][color=#b45f06]Enter[/color][color=#f1c232]\" to save. To change values on something in SKGE you must use either the [/color][color=#b45f06]plus[/color][color=#f1c232] or [/color][color=#b45f06]minus[/color][color=#f1c232] key in your number pad on the right side. This should be on most of your keyboards. You can also highlight a settings value and press the \"[/color][color=#b45f06]Enter[/color][color=#f1c232]\" key that is related with your number pad. Both \"[/color][color=#b45f06]Enter[/color][color=#f1c232]\" keys have a different purpose. You will also have to adjust field of view from the SKGE menu as well. It will be set to 90 by default. If you have any camera enhancing mods like \"Face To Face\" turn the field of view to 0 and make sure the camera effect is set to 0 as well.\n<br />[/color]\n<br />\n<br />Thanks again sthaagg!\n<br />This [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74427/?]link[/url] will take you to Sthaagg's page that deeply explains the use and configuration of ENB.\n<br /> Here is the link just incase the blue shortcut I left doesnt work: \n<br />\n<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74427/? \n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/83532-2-1509128901.jpg[/img]\n<br />(NLA)\n<br />\n<br />Remember to show some love by posting some screenshots, endorsement, and maybe even a vote if you like it enough. Show some love to those who have made it possible for this preset to exist. Show the SKGE team some love for allowing me to publish their files with my own settings that work with my preset. \n<br />Thanks to Rudy102 for helping me when I needed to know more about ENB.\n<br />Enjoy you guys.\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]iTmP9TtPdXs[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]rKWunBBlNSc[/youtube][/center][/size]\n<br />[center]﻿[/center][center][youtube]SeG7eTcg0MQ[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center]﻿[/center][center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/83532-3-1509128901.jpg[/img][/center][center](NLA)﻿[/center][center]﻿[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=6][center]How To Install My Preset[/center][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=5]Very simple. It's a click and drag into your skyrim directory. More is explained as you read a little more.\n<br />\n<br />-Install weather and lighting. (I will probably be updated occasionally. So track my mod page)\n<br />\n<br />-Download latest enb files [url=http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.html]here[/url]..\n<br />Only put Host.exe and d3d9.dll file into your skyrim directory folder. \n<br />\n<br />-Then install [/size][size=6]MY[/size][size=5] enblocal.ini, enbseries.ini, and enbseries folder into your skyrim directory as well. [color=#ffff00]USE my ENBLOCAL.INI. I'm not kidding guys. Use my local file and just edit the part for your memory settings and possibly for parallax if you do or don't use it. It is on by default.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />-If you want to use some of the options I have available for you guys to use just follow the .txt files in that file after downloading. It is very easy and simple to do.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=6][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50065]NLA[/url]﻿[/size][size=5]- This was the first one I updated dramatically. It's nights and days should be balanced enough. the nights will be brighter than I want them though. I plan on overhauling this like I did for SnowFall. I can desribe this as being more cold than the others. Lots of blue tones for the skies.[/size]\n<br />[size=5]\n<br />[/size][size=6][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75346][color=#6fa8dc]NVLA[/color][/url][color=#6fa8dc]-[/color][/size][size=5][color=#cc4125] [/color][color=#ffffff]Finally Done with the weather preset adjustments. Just install NLVA As described on its mod page. You do NOT need the ENB files on that mod page just my ENB files.(Nights can be super bright in this one. I have plans to make all my nights super dark. Use a torch)\n<br />\n<br />[/color][/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79335][size=6]SnowFall[/size][/url][size=6][color=#6fa8dc]-[/color] [/size][size=5]Finished with this weather mod. I Think its a good weather mod but I find the Frost Weathers to be very VERY rare. Follow the installation for this mod on its mod page. You do NOT need the ENB files on that mod page just my ENB files. (Has really dark nights)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=6]For ELFX Users-[/size][/color][color=#00ffff] [/color][color=#cc4125][size=5]I may or may not include this anymore with my presets. There are just too many glitches with enb files .315 and up. I think that the newest .319 is suppose to fix these issues. But I have not tested it.[/size][/color][size=5] Use at your own risk.[/size]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17609/?]\n<br />[/url][color=#6fa8dc][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17609/?][size=6]Relighting Skyrim[/size][/url][/color][color=#6fa8dc][size=6] [/size][/color][color=#00ffff][size=6]&amp; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59733/?]Enhanced Lighting for ENB[/url]-[/size][/color][size=5] This is a lot more stable and a lot less glitchy without any random interior lighting issues. Makes interiors look really good too. [color=#f1c232]So this IS a required mod for my presets. Check sticky notes on load order. I would like to add that I DO infact use the JIT version. It isn't required but It's safe to use. It wont ruin the overall look of interiors for you guys.[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20100/?]Sunglare Disabler[/url][color=#00ffff]-[/color][/size][size=5]Please use this mod. It Will get rid of any of that annoying sunglare/sunband that over powers the sky from NLA and any other Weather mod. It is harmless and wont mess up your game in any way.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=6][color=#6fa8dc]Install[/color] [url=http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=1499]Mindflux's Partical Patch[/url] and the [url=http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=1499]Subsurface Scattering Patch[/url].\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][color=#6fa8dc][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80696]Torches Cast Shadows[/url][/b]-[/color][/size][size=5]  This mod is awesome. If you want to be able to have a brighter torch or candle spell lightsource use this mod. It even lets you choose the radius of your light source as well. Author has updated their mod. Apparently its shadow casting is compatible with ENB. I haven't tested it yet though. If anything I think there are options to turn off shadows from being casted. [/size]\n<br />[size=6][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48938/?]\n<br />Watercolor for ENB and Realistic Water Two[/url] [/size][size=5]is now compatible with update. It's almost essential to use it with my enb.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/83532-1-1509128901.jpg[/img][/center][center](NLA)[/center]\n<br />[center][color=#00ffff][size=6]Mod Of Interest[/size][/color][/center]\n<br />[size=5]\n<br />[/size][size=4]You guys might like my preset with [/size][size=5][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24810/?]Morning Fogs[/url].[/size][size=4] It makes the atmosphere look much more scenic. Give it a try.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]I would recommend using the mod[/size][size=5] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58424/?]Remove smoke[/url][/size][size=4]. I used it during the making of my preset. And it will also save a few frames. Worth using.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Do [/size][size=6][color=#ff0000]NOT[/color] [/size][size=4]use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65959/?]Little Things[/url] with this ENB preset. Thanks to CyborgArmGun..and us breaking our heads over why her skyrim was looking so yellow. She finally figured out that the 'Atmosphere' retexture turns my preset into a yellow toned mess. But the other texture mods like WEBS and DUST are perfectly fine. Just not ATMOSPHERE (as stated in that mods description to be weary of what ENB you are using because it may change the color and look of a preset)\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59721/?]DYNDOLOD[/url]. If using DYNDOLOD, when installing it make sure to set the landscape brightness to -10 or -13 so it doesn't look too bright on your LOD. IF you don't know how to install it check out Gamer Poets youtube tutorial on how to install DYNDOLOD [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_5MWqeHIzw&amp;t=2111s]here[/url]. I know it's a long video but if you go part by part with it you will install DYNDOLOD correctly!\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27563/?]Wet and Cold[/url] is also a great mod to have if you don't already. It fits really well with the way my rain and snow weathers look. Really makes you feel like its wet and freezing. I would not recommend using the frost effect though. It looks great in the day but as it gets darker it just looks like your covered in glitter lol.\n<br />\n<br />I use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80648/?]Skyrim Textures Redone - Enhanced Night Sky[/url] The no nebula version works wonderfully with minty's shooting stars mod. \n<br />\n<br />Minty's [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15506/?]Lightning During Thunder Storms[/url](it is compatible with Vivid weathers so far as I can tell. I have yet to run into anything weird or funky) and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25022/?]Shooting Stars[/url] Is a great compliment to my enb settings of the night sky.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62425/?]Embers HD[/url] is a great compliment to my Preset. There is a choice with more orange embers which I think is a nice touch.\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />[/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4910/?][size=5]Dramatic Clouds[/size][/url][size=4] or use [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83478/?][size=5]Northern Realistic Clouds[/size][/url][size=4]. I would recommend ONLY using the clear weather cloud .dds files from Northern Realistic Clouds with my preset.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4] Northern Realistic Clouds files:\n<br />[color=#f1c232]-skyrimcloudsupper01.dds\n<br />-skyrimcloudsupper02.dds\n<br />-[/color][color=#f1c232]skyrimcloudsupper03.dds\n<br />-skyrimcloudsupper04.dds[/color][color=#f1c232]\n<br />-skyrimcloudhorizon01.dds[/color][/size]\n<br />[size=5]So take these files and make a file path to the area they go in.(Or download Northern Realistic Clouds manually and delete everything EXCEPT the files I listed above)\n<br /> Then archive it. After archiving them move The archvied file into your NMM and install it so it's easy to remove later on.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52986/?][size=5]Snow[/size][/url][size=4] is a great mod. You guys need to try this.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=5][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59809]Vivid Clouds And Fogs[/url] [/size][size=4]I advise using just the textures from this mod and none of the patches for SnowFall or NLVA. I wouldn't suggest using this with NLA because I didn't adjust the weathers for these cloud textures. Just the ones it utilizes.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88042][size=5]Smooth Sky Mesh[/size][/url] [size=4]I advise people to use this mod. It wont ruin performance or anything. Jawz is all about keeping his mods stable for users.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/83532-5-1509128901.jpg[/img][/size][/center][size=4][center](NLA)[/center]\n<br />[/size][color=#00ffff][size=6]\n<br />[/size][/color][center][color=#00ffff][size=6]For SnowFall Weathers[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=4]THis Weather adaption is finally finished. I carefully blended the frost snow weathers to best fit my preset and to give it a very realistic/believable look to it. Nights are darker and scarier. Very little night light will guide you. Nighteye effect is adjusted and on by default for this preset. This utilizes the new ENB features such as Automatic Ambient Lighting, Character Glow, ENB Effect Prepass and ENB Depth Of Field are both usable. Not just one or the other anymore. Interiors are darker now as well. Torches and light sources work just fine for exteriors and interiors.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/83532/83532-1523780776-1202290574.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/83532/83532-1523780991-1355840341.jpeg[/img]﻿[color=#cc4125]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/83532/83532-1523780823-352368811.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/83532/83532-1523780721-2132928112.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/83532/83532-1523780966-1057459398.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/83532/83532-1523780744-143121059.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />[/color]﻿[/center][center][color=#cc4125]\n<br />[/color]\n<br />                          [/center]\n<br />[color=#6aa84f][size=6][center]SKGE ENB Installation[/center][/size][/color]                                                                                       [b][u][color=#6aa84f][center]SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR SKGE[/center]\n<br />[center]﻿(Pretty much basic requirements)[/center][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />[left]﻿[/left]\n<br />[left]- SKSE plugin\n<br />- Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library Redistributable Package 2015 x86\n<br />- Latest version of DirectX 9.0c (June 2010) - use a redistributable version (not the web installer).\n<br />- Latest Skyrim version 1.9.32.0.8[/left][right][font=Arial]\n<br />[/font][/right][font=Arial]\n<br />[/font][b][u]RECOMMENDED SKYRIMPREFS.INI SETTINGS[/u][/b]\n<br />fShadowDistance=7000.0000  (I have tested for 5000 and it works fine.
