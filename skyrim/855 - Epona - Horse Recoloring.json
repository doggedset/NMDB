  "descriptionHtml": ">> Epona: Horse Recoloring by cicatrice\r\n\r\n   This mod, by default, replaces the Windhelm/carriage horses (bay with white blaze and socks) with a The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess-colored Epona.\r\n\r\n>> Install\r\n\r\n   Use an unzipping program (e.g. 7zip, WinRar) to extract the files/folders into your Skyrim\\'s data folder (within your Skyrim install directory).\r\n\r\n   * For Steam users: C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\n>> Uninstall\r\n\r\n   Remove the following files:\r\n\r\n   * Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\horse\\\\horse01.dds\r\n   * Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\horse\\\\horsemanetail.dds\r\n\r\n>> Notes\r\n  \r\n   * Currently, without the Creation Kit, all horse manes and tails will be white if you use this mod as presented.\r\n   * Not compatible with other horse recolor/texture mods.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change a particular horse to use Epona: Horse Recoloring, then change the \\'horse01.dds\\' filename (included with this mod) to the target horse\\'s filename according to the list below:\r\n\r\nDEFAULT TEXTURE NAMES & HORSE TYPE (within the .bsa):\r\nhorse01.dds = [Windhelm] - Bay with white blaze and socks (carriage horse)\r\nhorse02.dds = [Solitude] - Palomino\r\nhorse03.dds = [Riften] - Dapple Grey\r\nhorse04.dds = [Whiterun] - Black\r\nhorse05.dds = [Markarth] - Pinto\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a Markarth horse already bought and want its colors to be Epona\\'s, then rename the \\'horse01.dds\\' file included with this mod to \\'horse05.dds\\'.\r\n\r\nDEFAULT TEXTURE & MANE/TAIL TYPE (within the .bsa):\r\nhorsemanetail.dds = black/dark brown\r\nhorsemanetail02.dds = white/cream\r\n\r\nEPONA - HORSE RECOLORING CHANGED THE FOLLOWING:\r\n* \\'horse01.dds\\' is a recolored version (Epona) of the Windhelm texture (Bay with white blaze and socks)\r\n* \\'horsemanetail.dds\\' (as it appears in this mod) is actually just \\'horsemanetail02.dds\\' (white/cream) -- if you want a dark mane/tail on your Epona-colored horse, just remove the \\'horsemanetail.dds\\' included with this mod (this would also make all horse types have their \\\"correct\\\" mane/tail colors).",
