  "descriptionHtml": "Hello all, \r\n     \r\n     While playing around one night with Exium\\'s recolor of the nightingale armor i got the inspiration to make my own version. I like most people love the look of the Nightingale armor because it\\'s a more supernatural armor and the look of it is absolutely beautiful and quite elegant if you look at some of the finer details. I honestly reminded me of something you would see in a batman comic/movie/cartoon. I usually like to play as a warrior running around in a full set of ebony or a custom armor mod/compilation, but i would always make that exception for the Nightingale armor. Even though i play as a warrior i do understand the merits and benefits of being a stealth character with the sneaking and lock picking. Now i can run around as a shadow warrior with a little more emphases on the warrior aspect because sometimes it\\'s just more fun to jump into (or start one ;) ) a melee and train wreck a group of enemies. This file will replace the default nightingale texture for you and anyone who wears the armor. \r\n\r\nThis is my first mod attempt and i think the textures came out rather well all things considered. i hope you all enjoy it :).\r\n\r\nupdate 10/20/2013 female version is now available :) \r\n\r\nAdd this file to your textures folder in the data folder of your Skyrim install or installing by using NMM.\r\n\r\nMods used in Images: \r\nHeavy Nightingale armor (best use is for this mod.)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28337//?\r\n\r\nBandolier - Bags and Pouches (i wonder if someone can make this in a nightingale style texture.)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16438//? \r\n\r\nSilver Crossbow\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29089//?\r\n\r\nLeather Backpack (i wonder if someone can make this in a nightingale style texture too)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13732//?",
