  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod and I think it turned out pretty well.\r\nIts a small den under the bridge in whiterun. It dosent contain enchanting table,work bench etc partly because I wanted it to be a sort of cheap slum tipe thing. It does contain a bed,map,chair and a book about the mark on the wall.\r\n\r\nI dont think I will update this mod because I have no reason to.\r\nI dont know of any issues so if you find some then message me and I\\'ll try my best to fix them.\r\nI was using the vibrant fantasy enb. (go check it out)\r\n\r\nPlease leave feedback and suggestions about where you want the next den to pop up.\r\n\r\nHOPE YOU ENJOY",
