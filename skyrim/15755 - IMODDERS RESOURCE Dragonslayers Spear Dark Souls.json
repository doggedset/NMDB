  "summary": "The spear that Dragonslayer Ornstein uses in Dark Souls! As a resource, I hope someone makes it into a usable weapon in Skyrim. All that is needed are the textures and a way to use it in the game, so it is a third done.",
  "descriptionHtml": "As a Mechanical Drafter that uses Autodesk Inventor, I am using these models I am making as resources to get me used to Autodesk 3DsMAX so I can start making more interesting things. I try to make weapons from other games I have played, and on the list so far is Dark Souls\\' weapons. I want these weapons to have abilities like their Dark Souls counterparts, and would hope whoever uses the Dragonslayer\\'s Spear makes it work similar to it.\r\n\r\nIn Dark Souls, it could be used as either a two handed spear or a one handed spear. Both ways it did a bit of physical damage and lightning damage. Its one handed version has a lightning spear attack (shooting lightning bolts kind of thing, like Thor) which could be made possible with the use of making a one-handed staff version.\r\n\r\nI might try and make other boss weapons from the game, maybe Moonlight Greatsword that acts like a staff to use its ability of sending a wave of magic in a cross cut fashion.
