Please feel free to share your own&#33; :D\r<br />[youtube]NjDzlBYVXoQ[/youtube]\r<br />[img]http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk173/huMAnity_dues/description_zpscffb8ff8.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Wield the hammer of a dead god and bring forth a furious storm against your foes with the Crusher of myth...MJOLNIR&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Unlike the other Mjolnirs on the Nexus (including the one I used to have uploaded here) this one is designed to resemble a more traditional incarnation of the hammer, rather than to resemble the Marvel Comics version.  While not strictly traditional, as a purely traditional Mjolnir would basically be an enchanted smiths hammer, I still consider this far closer to myth as I based my design on the ancient Mjolnir pendants of the viking age.  The influence can be seen in the slightly triangular shaped hammer head and the tapering handle. \r<br />\r<br />In order to find this hammer in the world of Nirn, one must understand these words:\r<br />\r<br />Above twin towers,\r<br />under winded stone,\r<br />stuck in Gulden rock,\r<br />there lay this thing \r<br />that fell from the sky,\r<br />and shook the world\r<br />\r<br />As of now, the hammer carries rather heftily sized 4k textures.  This is what I&#39;m going to leave it at for now.  Sometime later I&#39;ll release some lower resolution versions\r<br />\r<br />Stats wise, the craftable version is comparable to a daedric mace.  The enchanted version on the other hand, is considerably more powerful, being a gods weapon and all. \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk173/huMAnity_dues/installation-1_zps62621246.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Presumably Nexus Mod Manager shouldn&#39;t have any issues installing this.\r<br />\r<br />However, presuming the worst and/or the preference of manual installation,  to install:\r<br />\r<br />1. Download Mod\r<br />2. Extract Data folder in .rar to your Skyrim Directory\r<br />3. Check the mod in your favorite mod manager or with the Skyrim Launcher\r<br />4. Play&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk173/huMAnity_dues/credits-1_zpsac7a14e9.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />A HUGE and MASSIVE thanks to ttl269 from the niftools forum for helping get the model working in-game.  Without him, this mod would likely never have saw the light of day. If you should ever run across him in your internet travels, please, send him thanks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Great thanks to those on the NexusForums as well who also helped bring this mod to light with their advice.
