  "descriptionHtml": "After working with the bow to make a crossbow concept i felt in the mood for making a sword to go with it, so with out further a due this is my concept design of Auriels sword. It DOES NOT have any UV maps so it WILL require to be textured before use. Unfortunately i do not have any practical means of unwrapping and UV mapping this mesh so i release it to the modders community to finish the job :) the object is formated in .OBJ for easy importing. This design is 100% Custom based on the design of Auriels bow and Hadhafang, or Arwens sword from LOTR.\r\n\r\nCredit to Bethesda for the design of Auriels Bow.",
