  "descriptionHtml": "Skooma is a highly addictive narcotic in the world of Elder Scrolls, but, in my opinion, Skyrim doesn\\'t represent this very well. Skooma in this mod will provide better bonuses while high, a withdrawal effect, possibility of overdose, and a visual drugged effect. I have tried to stay as lore friendly, and balanced as possible.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n*a visual drugged effect [sleeping tree sap effect]\r\n*high level of stamina regeneration (allows virtually unlimited power attacks and sprinting) [+25 per second]\r\n*very modest boost to move speed (stackable) [+5 move speed per use]\r\n*small health and magicka damage to allow for overdose [-2health -5mana per use]\r\n*a long \\\"withdrawal\\\" period (very difficult to regenerate stamina). [-5 per second]\r\n*craftable at a cooking spit [3 Moonsugar + 1 Nightshade = 1 bottle]\r\n\r\nSteam Workshop: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=10718\r\n\r\nI plan on continuing work and adding more features to this mod as I learn more about the CKit. Comments are always welcome.\r\n\r\n==Future plans==\r\nconsidering adding a few alternatives to the standard Skooma (suggestions+wip)\r\nplans for adding Skooma Pipes to the game (wip)\r\nplans to add feature that will flag skooma as \\\"illegal\\\" (wip)\r\n==Completed==\r\nbalance stat gains, losses and vendor pricing\r\nintegrate minor move speed buff\r\ntested and balanced crafting skooma recipe.\r\n\r\n==Versions==\r\nUpdate v1.2.1\r\n-hotfix: overdose numbers were wrong, fixed.\r\nUpdate v1.2 \r\n-added a modest (stackable) move speed buff.\r\n-added a very small initial health and magicka damage (once per skooma) for a chance of overdose when drinking large amounts of skooma at once.\r\nUpdate v1.1\r\n-balanced cooking ingredients and skooma value with merchants.\r\n-removed the stacking portion of the withdrawal effect.\r\n-reduced stamina drain on withdrawal effects by a small amount.\r\nUpdate v1.0\r\n- added craftable skooma at cooking spits.\r\nUpdate v0.5\r\n-changed skooma stats, now restores stamina per second for 60 seconds.\r\n-added a stacking withdrawal effect that lasts 5 minutes after initial \\\"high\\\" wears off ",
