  "descriptionHtml": "[heading]DESCRIPTION:[/heading]\r\n\r\nAdds Poisons of Soul Trap to the game (with five different levels of power) enabling you to coat a weapon for a one-time use of Soul Trap, even on a weapon that is already enchanted.\r\n\r\nThe poisons have also been added to random loot and Vendor lists, and can be crafted at a Cooking Pot.\r\n\r\nMods that affect vanilla Soul Trap, such as Acquisitive Soul Gems, should not cause conflicts, since this mod will use whatever script you have installed for the Soul Trap effect.\r\n\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136690234]Also available on the Steam Workshop[/url]\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n[heading]KNOWN ISSUES:[/heading]\r\n\r\nThe soul trap effect will not activate on an enchanted weapon if the poisoned blow kills the victim.  \r\nThe thing is, this seems to be an engine limitation, common to all poisons.  \r\nFor example (according to my tests), if you were to kill an actor using an enchanted weapon that is poisoned with a Paralysis poison, the paralysis would not occur, and their corpse would ragdoll normally.  However, if the weapon had a paralysis [i]enchantment[/i], the actor might become paralyzed immediately upon death, and their corpse would become rigid.  Evidently, enchantments and poisons of the same type, with the same scripts and conditionals, do not behave in the same way, even in the vanilla, so this issue is beyond my (or anyone\\'s) ability to fix.",
