  "descriptionHtml": "Since I have been unable to get a response on getting this patch hosted on the Dual Sheath Redux page, I&#39;m going to temporarily put it up myself. Why? because sharing is caring.\r<br />\r<br />Required Mods:\r<br />Andragorn&#39;s Imperial Sword Replacer - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28106/?\r<br />Dual Sheath Redux - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34155/?\r<br />\r<br />All Credit goes to Neovalen for his Dual Sheath Redux and Andragorn for the new Imperial Swords.\r<br />\r<br />Permissions to alter this are not given, obviously you would need to contact either original author of these mods. Permission was given to me to create the Dual Sheath Patch. Enjoy&#33; ",
