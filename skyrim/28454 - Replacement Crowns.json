  "descriptionHtml": "I took pnkrd\\'s mod here, [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5803]Crown Helmets[/url] , and simply changed it to be a stock helmet replacer!\r\n\r\nThis mod replaces the daedric, dragonplate, dragonscale, ebony, elven and glass helmets with circlets that are based on the vanilla models. All other helmets are completely unaffected. I only did this because several people had asked on pnkrd\\'s mod\\'s comments to have a replacer only version, so I got pnkrd\\'s permission and put this together. There are two versions, the Daedric Circlet version and the Daedric Mask version, the only difference is the Daedric Mask covers the mouth like a full mask. You can see it on pnkrd\\'s mod page [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5803]Crown Helmets[/url]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is clipping! Hairs of all kinds will clip, you\\'ll just have to kinda deal with it, sorry. Also, male orcs have some gnarly clipping at the mouth because of their underbites.\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT* - This will NOT work for beast races. In fact, beast races will no longer display daedric, dragonbone, dragonscale, ebony, elven or glass helmets at all. They still equip and function normally, but they will not appear on your Khajiit or Argonian.\r\n\r\nSorry about the bad screenshots, I spent so much time getting everything ready, I couldn\\'t make myself go back and fix the closed eyes *sigh* \r\n\r\nAnyways, enjoy and make sure you go over to pnkrd\\'s mod if you\\'d rather have unique crowns!",
