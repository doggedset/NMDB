  "descriptionHtml": "[center][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This mod replaces many of the textures that are used in villages and towns, such as Riverwood and Morthal. Apart from that, they also seem to affect a number of other objects such as the tanning rack, fish rack, various benches and tables, etc. \r<br />\r<br />As usual, I&#39;ve tried keeping true to their original look. \r<br />\r<br />All textures are double the original resolution, making them 2048^2 max. Any constructive criticism is welcome&#33; :) \r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=5ea2e5][b]Installation[/b][/color]\r<br />[center][/center]\r<br />\r<br />As any texture file, simply unpack the .rar file and merge the data folder with the one in your Skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />To uninstall, remove these files from the farmhouse folder in [u]Data/textures/architecture/farmhouse:[/u]\r<br />\r<br />farmhouse01.dds\r<br />farmhouse01_n.dds\r<br />farmwindowinterior01.dds\r<br />farmwindowinterior01_n.dds\r<br />roof01.dds\r<br />roof01_n.dds\r<br />rope01.dds\r<br />rope01_n.dds\r<br />ropealpha01.dds\r<br />ropealpha01_n.dds\r<br />stonewall01.dds\r<br />stonewall02.dds\r<br />stonewall02_n.dds\r<br />thatch02.dds\r<br />thatch02_n.dds\r<br />thatch03.dds\r<br />thatch03_n.dds\r<br />woodpost02.dds\r<br />woodpost02_n.dds\r<br />woodwalkway01.dds\r<br />woodwalkway01_n.dds\r<br />woodwall01.dds\r<br />woodwall01_n.dds\r<br />wovenfence01.dds\r<br />wovenfence01_n.dds\r<br />\r<br />You could of course also use the Nexus mod manager. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=5ea2e5][b]Changelog[/b][/color]\r<br />[center][/center]\r<br />\r<br />V1.0\r<br />-Release.\r<br />\r<br />V1.1\r<br />-Changed the thatch roof textures. It&#39;s now more detailed and it blends better with the ridges on the roofs. (I love how it looks from up close, but I am aware that it looks less detailed from a distance compared to the original. Fair trade-off if you ask me.)\r<br />-Made some minor adjustments to various textures. This includes, among other things, a change to the wood posts. They now make the incessant repeating of textures less apparent than they did before (in an inn, for example). \r<br />-Woven fences now look slightly different. I overlooked the horizontal seamlessness that the original texture had. That&#39;s now fixed. \r<br />\r<br />V1.2\r<br />-Another small edit to the woven fence. Altered the alpha map to make the ends of the fence less square. \r<br />-New texture for the wooden floors. I didn&#39;t like the previous one enough, it was still a bit too blurry. Now nice and sharp :)\r<br />-Added a new texture replacement for the remaining stone walls (though it&#39;s just really some stone details used on steps and inside the inns). \r<br />-Minor edits here and there. (I&#39;m still working on the stone floor. I&#39;ll also edit the stonewall01 further in the future. These take a lot of time because I&#39;m a noob and need to learn more :p).\r<br />\r<br />[center]\r<br />[/center]",
