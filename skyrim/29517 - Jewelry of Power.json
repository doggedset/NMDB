  "descriptionHtml": "You can craft a Necklace and Ring which provide a whole bunch of enchantments of the magnitude you can get at 100 Enchantment skill level and by wearing four armour pieces with that enchantment. Saves the trouble of running around with several armor sets for specific tasks.\r\n\r\nI made this mod primarily for my own use. As a consequence the set of enchantments are aimed at my own character, which is a Forsworn sneaky archer / fire-destruction mage hybrid. My character hasn\\'t focused on alchemy at all, so the magnitude of the enchantments does not take into account possible improvements from potions. I may update the mod if I ever get better at alchemy. ;-)\r\n\r\nThe Forsworn Amulet of Power has the following requirements to be crafted at the forge:\r\n\r\n1) The Extra Effect perk from the Enchantment perk tree.\r\n2) A Markarth guard helmet. Go kill the oppressive invader!\r\n\r\nIt offers the following enchantments:\r\n+100% alchemy & smithing\r\n-100% magicka costs for the destruction & restoration spells\r\n+160% archery, lockpicking, pickpocket & sneak\r\n+30% barter\r\n+10% speech\r\nwaterbreathing\r\n+62 health & magicka\r\n\r\nThe Forsworn Ring of Power has the following requirements to be crafted at the forge:\r\n\r\n1) The Extra Effect perk from the Enchantment perk tree.\r\n2) A Markarth guard shield.\r\n3) A Silver Ingot.\r\n\r\nIt offers the following enchantments:\r\n\r\n+62 stamina\r\n+24 unarmed damage\r\n+37% shock & frost resistance\r\n+46% fire resistance\r\n\r\nAs long as you do not wear any other enchanted apparel in addition to these jewelry, I do not consider this mod \\\"cheating\\\". It just saves you the immersion breaking trouble of constantly switching between different armor sets, when you want to perform a specific task.",
