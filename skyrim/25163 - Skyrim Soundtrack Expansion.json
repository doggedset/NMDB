  "descriptionHtml": "What It Does:\r\n\r\nThe Skyrim Soundtrack Expansion adds nearly 30 minutes of original orchestral music by Robert Scott to the game. Currently, only the world exploration playlists are expanded, but there may be new tracks in the future to expand dungeon and town playlists.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho It\\'s For:\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants additional music that fits within the existing soundtrack to enhance the Skyrim experience.\r\n\r\nThis is not a soundtrack replacement. None of the default tracks are removed by this mod, and the new tracks are composed and orchestrated to continue the existing mood and feel of the game, not to alter it or re-imagine it. \r\n\r\nHear the soundtrack at:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSajPn_ZdLo&list=PLDN9U5SYkhkA_FBqzLzz3u2uoxX0e6gFw&feature=mh_lolz\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Details:\r\n\r\nThis mod may not be compatible with other mods that modify Skyrim\\'s music system. \r\n\r\nThis mod is compatible with Dawnguard, and Hearthfire.\r\n\r\nMusic and sound in Skyrim may occasionally skip, but this is not an issue caused or resolved by this mod.\r\n\r\nRequires 40 MB hard disk space for new music.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n\r\nThis soundtrack is entirely legal to download, and is published by the copyright owner (Robert Scott) specifically for use in Skyrim.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is intended for use only in Skyrim and may not be used in any other way without prior written permission.\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.rscomposer.com",
