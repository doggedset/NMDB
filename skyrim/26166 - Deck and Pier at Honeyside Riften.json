  "descriptionHtml": "Don\\'t let Riften\\'s rare sunny days pass you by!\r\n\r\nBefore Honeyside was up for sale, it was home to the wharf\\'s stevedore foreman.  But now that crime in Riften has driven the merchant marine to safer harbors, the old pier goes unused.  And unless you go and do something foolish, like clean up the town, no ship should need berthing on the port side of the port anytime soon.  (Besides, you\\'re a thane after all; surely you can dislodge any presumptuous longshoremen.)\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n- diving board\r\n- model building station\r\n- picnic table\r\n- secluded fishing spot\r\n- stumps on shore for sitting\r\n- dark barrels for sitting\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\nplace everything in /Skyrim/Data/\r\n(contains 1 ESP + 1 non-replacing NIF)\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nIt\\'s always nice to see screenshots posted of your characters lounging around out back.\r\n\r\nIf you like this, then you might like [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23121]Terrace Porch for Breezehome[/url], [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24320]Terrace Patio at Proudspire[/url], [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24857]Courtyard for Windhelm Hjerim[/url] or [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26856]Stoop Over Markarth[/url]",
