  "summary": "Adds a full set of Heavy gilded elven armor with brighter textures. fully craftable and upgradeble.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will add a full set of Heavy Gilded Elven Armor (including the shield) to the crafting list under Elven (obviously). The armor uses gold and corundum in place of quicksilver and iron, and can be tempered with gold and quicksilver. The Vanilla gilded armor was 20% stronger then the regular so I mostly stuck with that formula. I also increased the weight to match its heavier materials.\r<br />\r<br />The idea behind this mod is that the elven armor you see thalmor justicars wearing is their light field armor. the Heavy Gilded Elven Armor is what the City Guards in Alinor/Summerset Isles would wear. its cleaner, shinier, and though its made with the same design as regular elven armor, the materials are much heavier and stronger. \r<br />\r<br />Installation: Activate via NMM\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation: Deactivate Via NMM\r<br />\r<br />If anybody wishes to include this mod in another, like a random encounter mod or a thalmor overhaul or faction quest, go ahead, dont wait for permissions. just post a link here in the comments so i can check the mod out too.\r<br />\r<br />1.0 initial release\r<br />1.1 added forgotten shield texture.\r<br />1.2 added forgot item associations for tempering to work.",
