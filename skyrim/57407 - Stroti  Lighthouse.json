  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff0000][size=3][b]None of these resources or parts of them may be used in paid mods[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Stroti Lighthouse\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />by Stroti\r<br />\r<br />converted by Tamira\r<br />\r<br />This is the conversion of Stroti&#39;s modder&#39;s resource for Oblivion. You can find the original file here:\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/35994/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />You can not only use it as lighthouse but as watchtower or for a personal player home.\r<br />And you can add fires to the braziers on top or flowers like I did for my personal use. \r<br />\r<br />The second nif that is included (LighthouseB) was an idea of Stroti to help modders to have a better look at the inside in the CS/CK while working on it. It is the same mesh with the outer walls removed. So if you wish to add furniture or decoration to the inner lighthouse, just replace it for that time with that alternate nif. After you have finished decorating, replace it again with the original nif. \r<br />\r<br />The ladder to the top was a pain for me, I tried my best but my character keeps falling through, though it works in the original Oblivion mod. Maybe it is too steep for the use in Skyrim. If you walk up quite slowly, it works. And maybe adding a collision plane there may help too. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />===============\r<br />Basement Addon:\r<br />===============\r<br />\r<br />I decided to publish my basement kit too for those who want to make the lighthouse habitable.\r<br />\r<br />Basement for the Lighthouse that you may enter through a trapdoor, with floor and ceiling.\r<br />Wall dividers converted from Stroti&#39;s resource: http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/41718/?\r<br />Wall dividers that are retextured vanilla farm dividers \r<br />Small window for the interior and exterior use\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />========\r<br />Credits:\r<br />========\r<br />\r<br />Stroti for his resources and for everything he has given to the TES community\r<br />The Niftools team for giving us Nifskope.\r<br />Skyfox from the Niftools team for his great tool NifUtils\r<br />CG Textures\r<br />Bethesda for the TES games \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />This is a modder&#39;s resource.You may use the meshes and textures for your own mods as long as you give credit and you do not charge money for it.\r<br />\r<br />You may use this resource in Skyrim Special Edition too. All files should work without problems. \r<br />\r<br />Do not upload to other sites.\r<br />\r<br />Stroti has quit modding and will no longer be active on the forums.\r<br />I have his personal permission to convert his Oblivion resources and to upload them.",
