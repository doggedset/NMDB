  "descriptionHtml": "Skyrim Skills Difficulty Overhaul\r\n_________________\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n____________\r\n\r\nFeel like you\\'re going too fast in Skyrim? Read on!\r\n\r\nThis mod aims to increase difficulty and make the game more enjoyable, longer.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this is my first mod ever released so bugs are expected, if any.\r\n\r\nEndorsements welcome! (If liked)\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n___________\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Default Starting health modified from 100 to 50.\r\n\r\n2. Default Starting Magicka modified from 100 to 50.\r\n\r\n3. To balance the Magicka modifcation mentioned in 2, the in-combat default magicka regen has been modified from 33% to 40%.\r\n\r\n4. All \\\"Skill\\\" Experience gained via Professions, i.e Blacksmithing / Enchanting is reduced by 50% (75% if ur using v1.1)\r\n\r\n5. All \\\"Skill\\\" Experience gained via Skills, i.e One Handed Weapons, Bows, Conjuration.. etc is 10 times harder.\r\n\r\n5.1 This means you\\'ll have to do 10x of the skill (for example bows, If you struck a target 50 times, you\\'ll have to shoot them 500 times now!) and the experience gainage after you\\'ve leveled your bows from, say 15 Bows to 16 Bows Skill, is 10 times harder aswell. This doubles the difficulty, making it a challenge to level up in Skyrim.\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n___________\r\n\r\nV1.1\r\n\r\n~ Smithing and Enchanting has been furtherly nerfed. (From 50% nerf to 75% nerf)\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n____________\r\n\r\nJust copy the .esp file into your Skyrim Data folder. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease Note\r\n___________\r\n\r\nThis mod is only recommended if you\\'re playing on hardcore and an advanced player. (Basicly, not an beginner)\r\n\r\nUsers are allowed to change/modify/use this file as they see fit without permission.\r\n\r\nTry to load this mod at the bottom of the load order, if possible.\r\n\r\nRecommended Mods\r\n________________\r\n\r\n1. Starting Spell Choice - If you\\'re an warrior, rogue and you don\\'t want magic.\r\n2. Deadly Combat.\r\n3. Realistic Running Speed.",
