I have an under-powered computer and ENB presets give me a far greater framerate hit than they will other users.  Here are my specs:\r<br />\r<br />Core2Duo E8500 @3.16ghz\r<br />4gb 1600mhz RAM\r<br />1GB ATI HD 6850\r<br />\r<br />After posting my other comparison: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54971/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54971/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />People wanted to know the framerate impact of each preset.  This should help :)\r<br />\r<br />With my mediocre computer, I have a difficult time running any but the most optimized of ENB presets.  If you&#39;re like me and want the benefits of ENB, but need help choosing one that doesn&#39;t kill your framerate, perhaps this will help. \r<br />\r<br />I took my favorite presets and some performance presets and with those, I snapped 900+ screenshots, using FRAPS, with the framerate showing in each screenshot, so you can see the exact impact it has on my setup.\r<br />\r<br />24 ENB presets\r<br />900+ Screenshots\r<br />\r<br />skyrimprefs.ini set to High\r<br />2x AA\r<br />16x AF\r<br />\r<br />Presets used:\r<br />Aeon Fantasy ENB\r<br />BLEAK ENB 119\r<br />Evok ENB 119\r<br />Gameplay Performance ENB\r<br />joeytrackRC1\r<br />K ENB 168\r<br />K ENB Pure Light\r<br />Kinematic ENB 168\r<br />Kinematic ENB Southern Lights\r<br />Kountervibe ENB Reborn 168\r<br />Kountervibe ENB Northern Lights\r<br />Minimal ENB\r<br />Natural Lighting and Atmospheric ENB\r<br />Poupouri Cinematic ENB First Seed 168\r<br />Project ENB Climates of Tamriel 119_Realistic Preset\r<br />RealVision ENB Option B\r<br />Saraan Suum ENB\r<br />Seasons of Skyrim ENB HD6 Tribute Version 119\r<br />Snapdragon ENB\r<br />Somber 3 ENB_Beren&#39;s Edit\r<br />Tundra ENB_Vibrant Edition\r<br />UNBLEAK ENB 119\r<br />Z ENB\r<br />Zoners High Performance ENB\r<br />\r<br />I hope this helps.
