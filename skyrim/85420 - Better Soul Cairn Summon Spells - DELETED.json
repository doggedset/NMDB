  "summary": "Tweaks the Soul Cairn summon spells to level with the player, and makes them more effective overall.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve always really liked the Conjure Wrathman, Conjure Boneman and Conjure Mistman spells. The problem, however, was Conjure Wrathman seemed to be the only useful one at higher levels. That&#39;s why I made this mod. All of these spells now level with the player, and the changes to each specific summons are as follows:\r<br />\r<br />Boneman\r<br />=========\r<br />\r<br />*Uses Ebony Bow and Ebony Arrows\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Mistman\r<br />========\r<br />*No longer casts Frostbite or Ice Spike\r<br />*Now casts Ice Storm\r<br />*Now casts Conjure Frost Atronach\r<br />*Increased Magicka pool\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Wrathman\r<br />==========\r<br />*No changes deemed necessary\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I also tweaked the Health and Stamina of all of the summons to be more appropriately aligned with the new levels. This is my first mod, and I tried to make things as balanced as possible. I would really appreciate feedback. If something seems too underpowered or too overpowered, please let me know. I&#39;m certainly open to tweaking things. Enjoy&#33;",
