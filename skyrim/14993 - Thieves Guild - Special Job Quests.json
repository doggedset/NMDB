When you get to talk to Devin, he just talks to you endlessly about talking to Brynyolf, in an endless loop. That\\'s where it ends. I did that by accident, and that\\'s what happened to me. lol\\\"\\\"\r\n\r\nAll you get is the special jobs completed. You get the reward and the benefit in each major city as you normally would - the option to pay the guards off by paying half the bounty becomes available.\r\nYou Do Not do the small jobs first, so you dont get rewards for them. You get all the special jobs completed in a second by using this bat file.\r\n\r\n---\r\nFor me it was a hassle to fast travel back and forth to get new jobs for each city to be able to get the special jobs offered by Vex and Delvin in order to restore the guild\\'s status and get the services it provides in each city. Doing this for every new character or thief/assassin characters took too long, so I made this text file where you use the command \\\"setstage\\\" to complete all the special jobs.\r\n---\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nPut the text file named ThiefJobs in the Skyrim folder. NOT DATA Folder.\r\n\r\nIn game: \r\nOpen console and type \\\"bat thiefjobs\\\"\r\n\r\nNOTE: After typing  \\\"bat thiefjobs\\\" in the console you need to speak to Delvin.\r\nYou need to click on the \\\"I have completed the special job in X city.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMy other mods:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8987]Everlasting Weapon Enchantment[/url] - Enchantments on weapons last forever / is infinite.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21198]Almost Unlimited Weapon Enchantments[/url] - Almost the same as Everlasting weapon enchantments, except that all enchantments cost 1 charge per use, thus last almost forever.",
