  "modName": "Solar Flame - A new spell and tome for Dawnguard",
  "summary": "Adds a stronger Sun damage spell to the game. And spelltome for sale by Florentius Banius.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was really excited for the new Restoration Sun damage spells when Dawnguard came out. Although, I was dissapointed by how weak they were. So, I added Solar Flame. A spell that does 90 points of Sun damage to the undead at the cost of 100 magicka. The spell tome can be bought from Florentius Banius in Fort Dawnguard. If enough people want, I could add it to the restoration trainer in Winterhold. Hope you like it. This is my first mod by the way, so please be easy. It is fairly simple so I don\\'t expect problems. I may make more mods in the future, maybe not though.",
