  "descriptionHtml": "TL;DR: Increases and equals the duration of a few buff spells so you no longer have to cast them so often and at irregular intervals.\r<br />\r<br />Previously, after maxing up your stats, Blessing of Life and Divine Shield and Resist Magic all lasted very different duration, with Blessing of Life and Resit Magic in particular requiring recast a bit too often for my liking. I&#39;ve increased their duration so that after maxing everything, Blessing of Life and Resist Magic will remain active for 15 minutes, Divine Shield for up to 30 minutes and Silence for God knows how much, probably completely overkill, but it&#39;s a misc spell anyway. Due to some technical difficulties, silence will also be super cheap to cast.",
