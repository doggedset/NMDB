  "descriptionHtml": "NOTE: This only works on the new ranged/magic killcam.  Better modders than me are making mods to disable the melee killcam.\r\n\r\nThe recent patch added kill cams to ranged and magic combat.  Since I attack almost exclusively at range, the lack of a \\\"disable kill cam\\\" option in the game settings never bothered me before.\r\n\r\nI found another mod to disable the kill cam (\\\"No Kill Moves\\\"), but at that time it didn\\'t work with the ranged/magic killcams in this version of the game.  This is important enough to me that I fired up the Creation Kit and made my first mod.\r\n\r\nTo install, put the NoKillCam.esp file in your skyrim/Data/ directory.",
