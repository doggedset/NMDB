  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod just seeing what i could do with the creation kit. I\\'ve added to the game a new companion named J\\'zoori Halloon. He can be located in Falkreath\\'s \\'Dead Man\\'s Drink\\'. It is recommended that users of the mod play in a difficulty of Adept or above, this is due to the fact that J\\'zoori is quite overpowered on the lower difficulties and has no problem dispatching enemies in one hit. On master difficulty, J\\'zoori is a great companion to have making the game more enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\\\"J\\'zoori is a Kahjit warrior escaping a life of gladiatorial battles. He was transferred from Cyrodil\\'s arena to Elswyr\\'s, a bandit raid on his caravan saw a chance for him to make his escape. Taking one of the few remaining horses he fled undetected as the battle ensued. He made his way to Skyrim\\'s Falkreath where the Kahjit can now be drinking in the \\'Dead Man\\'s Drink\\' inn\\\"\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n*High warrior class skills (60-100)\r\n*Flagged as Essential\r\n*Very powerful with the bow\r\n*Just as powerful with sword and shields\r\n*No conflict with other mods - face and hair mods etc.\r\n\r\nRecommended Mods\r\n* UFO-Ultimate Follower Overhaul\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n1) Download with NMM and activate.\r\n1)Deactivate in NMM.\r\n\r\nHOPE YOU ENJOYED THE MOD!
