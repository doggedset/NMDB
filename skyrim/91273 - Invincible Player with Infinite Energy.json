  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Comic Sans MS][b]Tips for this game.[/b][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial]This gives your player character infinite energy and invincibility. Also, it makes him/her essential and invulnerable all at the same time. The perk also gives player invincibility and infinite energy. No need for console commands! I changed the GMST for this, enemies deal no damage to the player. No jail and no bounty too! Ghost mode also makes a player invincible too!\n<br />\n<br />[/font]There is also non-ghost version too!",
