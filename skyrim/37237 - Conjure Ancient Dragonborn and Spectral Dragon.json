  "summary": "This mods adds the spells to summon an ancient dragonborn and a spectral dragon that bethesda forgot to add.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r\nAdds two new spells. \r\nThe first will add the ability to summon an ancient dragonborn, similarly to the one from dragon aspect. For every five dragon souls you have, an additional dragonborn is summoned.\r\nThe second spell adds the ability to summon a spectral dragon, although it looks more like one from Lion dances than a skyrim dragon.\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nThey are learned from spell tomes that can be found on the floor in Warmaidens (whiterun)\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nI did not make these spells. I just activated them. All credit goes to the Bethesda team, not me. Feel free to use this mod in any way you choose, just PM me to let me know what\\'s going on.",
