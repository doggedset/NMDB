  "descriptionHtml": "This plugin creates a craftable \\\"Viking Helmet\\\" that can be made at any forge. It uses the 3d model of the Helm of Yngol which I really liked and felt like something straight outta Viking lore, but I didn\\'t like how weak the armor is or how there\\'s only 1 helmet like that throughout the game (There may be more but none that I had seen) so I wanted to make the style of helmet a little more common is all.\r\n\r\nHere\\'s what you need to make it...\r\n-Steel Smithing perk\r\n-3 Steel Ingots\r\n-2 Iron Ingots\r\n-4 Leather strips",
