  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small basement addition to Breezehome in Whiterun, located in a basement via a trap door at the back of the house.\r<br />\r<br />The basement contains: \r<br />- 8 Mannequins\r<br />- 16 weapon racks\r<br />- 2 Large display cases\r<br />- 2 Dagger display cases\r<br />- A fancy table full of sh*t\r<br />- Anvil\r<br />- Workbench\r<br />- Sharpening wheel\r<br />- Enchanting table\r<br />- 2 chests\r<br />- 2 bookshelves that may or may not be functional\r<br />\r<br />Known Bugs:\r<br />- weapons falling out of racks when placed\r<br />- mannequins think they can fly\r<br />These bugs are not of my doing, it&#39;s just a bug in the creation kit from what the internet tells me, to fix the weapons just pick them up and leave then come back and place them again. For the mannequins just equip something on them to weigh them back down to earth ;)\r<br />\r<br />Have fun and enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />ps. probably, like 99% sure, that it will be incompatible with other Breezehome-editing mods",
