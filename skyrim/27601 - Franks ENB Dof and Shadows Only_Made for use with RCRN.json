  "summary": "ENB preset with only DoF and Shadow Improvements meant to be run alongside RCRN\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "I recently fell in love with the ever popular RCRN (Realistic Colors, Realistic Nights) mod. However, I was disappointed that it didn\\'t include Depth of field effects. I also was wary of using the recommended Dynavision mod as it\\'s been said to cause save game bloat. So, I went with ENB. \r\n\r\nMy preset disables pretty much all of ENB\\'s functionality except for Depth of Field (set to my own preference) and Shadow enhancements. \r\n\r\nThere are NO bloom, color correct, sharpness, or any other tweaks applied. Only DoF and Shadow Enhancements as I feel RCRN does the rest well enough.\r\n\r\nNote about framerate: You should only experience a very small drop in FPS with this enabled. I only lose about 1-3 FPS when it\\'s on.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend using this with RCRN: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1875\r\n\r\nHowever, this will also work well with Vanilla Skyrim and alongside FXAA. \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nStep 1: Install RCRN. If you already have it installed, just go to step 2.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Find \\\"d3d9.dll\\\" in your \\\"Skyrim\\\" directory and rename it to \\\"RCRN_d3d9.dll\\\"\r\n\r\nStep 3: Download ENB from http://www.enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0119.htm and extract it to your Skyrim directory\r\n\r\nStep 4: Download my setting and extract it to your Skyrim Directory. Overwrite all files. \r\n\r\nIf you choose to use my ENBsettings without RCRN, just skip to step 3.",
