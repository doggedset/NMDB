  "modName": "Female bard for you house",
  "summary": "Adds a female bard with femaleventoned voice to each of player\\'s houses aviable to purchase in skyrim. Optional files: \\\"not follower bards sing everywhere\\\" and \\\"special follow mode for bards\\\" (in early stage).",
  "descriptionHtml": "Reuploaded v2 with housecarl possibly missing fix (thanks shittakaburi for explaining what was causing it).\r\nAnd yet another small update: \r\nAdded a bard to archmage quarters.\r\nChanged the faces to look more appropriate to the race. Changed some hair styles and colors. (Screenshots were made with some face, eyes and hair texture mods so they will look differently in vanilla game). karen is now a breton.\r\nMoved the ref positions slightly to avoid possible bugs with housecarls.\r\nRemoved the inn marker location from vlindrel hall, hjerim, proudspire manor and breezehome. \\\"bards for all houses.esp\\\" now has \\\"bards sing everywhere.esp\\\" incorporated. All files except that one and honeyside one will require \\\"bards sing everywhere.esp\\\" for the bar to be able to sing inside the home (honeyside is marked as inn by default).\r\n\r\nAnother small update:\r\n\r\nAdded two new .esp files: \\\"not follower bards sing everywhere\\\" and \\\"special follow mdoe for bards\\\", independant from the main file.\r\nThe first removes the restriction to request a song only inside a location marked as an inn. Being a follower still disables this option though (this is not as easy to fix, the game goes far to prevent you from having a singing companion). Doesn\\'t work on Sven since he is in the currentfollowerfaction by default.\r\nInstallation: extract into your skyrim data foulder. make sure the .esp is checked when launching.\r\n\r\nThe second adds a third follower slot, aviable only by using the console. (Unfortunatly I have no idea on how to make it so it\\'s aviable through regular dialogue. Suggestions would be very appretiated.)\r\nHaving a bard in the third slot will not disable the option to request to perform (you will need the not follower bard sing everywhere.esp as well though) but they will not be able to carry your items or execute specific commands. You can recruit/dismiss/order to wait or follow only from the console (exact command list can be read below and is also found inside the readmefirst.txt of that archive file).\r\nA companion recruited this way will go with you even when and where others followers aren\\'t allowed. Pay attention to them and in case you think it might be required order them manually to wait for you outside.\r\nYou can have one more human companion and an animal recruited the standard way but not more.\r\nAlways dismiss him/her if the NPC is going to be involved into a quest you are about to do.\r\nIf you encounter some weird behavior by bard NPCs please let me know.\r\nCommand list:\r\nTo recruit:\r\nopen console\r\ntype \\\"ssq 750ba\\\" or \\\"ssq DialogueFollower\\\" (without quotes of course)\r\ntarget the NPC by clicking on it or using the prid command\r\ntype ForceRefIntoAlias Follower2\r\nclose console\r\n\r\nTo order them to wait:\r\nopen console\r\ntarget the NPC by clicking on it or using the prid command\r\ntype \\\"bat wait\\\"\r\nclose console\r\n\r\nTo order them to follow:\r\nopen console\r\ntarget the NPC by clicking on it or using the prid command\r\ntype \\\"bat follow\\\"\r\nclose console\r\n(it is not needed to return to where you left them if you don\\'t need to click them to target them) \r\n\r\nTo dismiss:\r\nopen console\r\ntype \\\"ssq 750ba\\\" or \\\"ssq DialogueFollow\\\"\r\ntype EmptyRefAlias Follower2\r\nclose console\r\n(consider undoing all the changes you might have done to the npc)\r\n\r\nOther useful but not necessary commands for followers:\r\nsetessential <NPCformID> 1 (makes them unkillable)\r\nsetplayerteammate 1 (useful if you want them to sneak when you are) \r\nsifh 1 (makes them ignore friendly hits)\r\nsetav confidence # - where # varies between 0 (cowardly) and 4 (foolhardy), the value depends on your personal preference.\r\n\r\nTo install: extract the archive into your skyrim foulder. Make sure the .esp is checked when launching the game. If you are using other bat commands you might have to rename those inside the archive. Check [URL=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Console]here[/URL] for more details on bat files.\r\n\r\nNext to do: change heads to standard ones in case their current custom ones cause bugs, change the refid positions slightly in case they conflict with housecarls, remove the locatypeinn mark from all houses cept honeyside (honeyside is marked as inn by default).\r\n\r\nSmall update: since some confusion arised with some files being v1.2 and some v1.1 I simply reuploaded all the latest version ones under one archive. There were no changes to anybody cept Dora till v 1.1. This is just an adjustement to avoid people not being sure on what they should download. Also renamed the .esp files for more clarity. Nothing new has been added till last update.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.2: edited Dora\\'s position (Breezehome, Whiterun) to - hopefully -make her stay downstairs and don\\'t bother the player while he/she sleeps. Uploaded the new allbards.esp and dora.esp versions. If Dora was already installed her marker won\\'t reset by itself, so it\\'s necessary to open the console, target her and type in \\\"disable\\\" and then \\\"enable\\\" commands. This will make her respawn in the right place. Made a similar mod for Lydia here: [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3255]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3255[/url] since she was bothering me too :p\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.1: edited the skin tone to try to match their face color (unfortunatly it has a to be quite dark). Changed the default outfit to tavern clothes and boots (I\\'m using a retexture of it so it\\'ll look slightly different in my screenshots, but it\\'s the standard one, same as used by Karita). Added all the .esp files to the same archive since else it\\'s becoming too messy. Inside there are, as before, a file with all bards and a file for each of the bards.\r\n\r\nBard names and locations:\r\nLoren - Hjerim in Windhelm\r\nKaren - Proudspire Manorin Solitude\r\nDora - Breezehome in Whiterun\r\nJora - Vlindrel Hall in Markarth\r\nAjen - Honeyside in Riften\r\n\r\nUpdate 1: uploaded files for the rest of the houses (Karen for Proudspire Manor in Solitude, Dora for Breezehome in Whiterun, Jora for Vlindrel Hall in Markarth, Ajen for Honeyside in Riften). They have the same voice and same songs. \r\n\r\nBUGS:\r\nUnfortunatly my custom NPCs suffer from body/head discoloration. If anybody can help me fix it i would be really grateful. :(\r\n\r\nI would also not recommend using this mod for the house(s) you don\\'t yet own.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nThis mod was made for personal use but I decided after all it wouldn\\'t hurt to share it, in case somebody like me would have enjoyed the idea to have a bard in his/her house. \r\nAdds female bards with femaleeventoned type of voice (same as Lisette, Luaffyn and Pantea Ateia) to player\\'s houses (Hjerim, Vlindrel Hall, Honeyside, Proudspire Manor and Breezehome).\r\n\r\nEach abrd can be added separatly or you can add them all together with \\\"bards for all houses.esp\\\" \r\n\r\nThey will sing Age of Agression/Opression, Dragonborn or Tale of The Tongues (once unlocked) upon request. They will also play/sing when it suits them. \r\n\r\nIf you have a bard as follower (for example if using a mod which enables that option) they will also be able to perform when inside your houses (though you\\'ll have to dismiss them first if you want to request something of course) if you have added a bard for that house.  \r\n\r\nThis mod should NOT be used if you haven\\'t yet completed the approriate quests and bought the house.\r\n\r\nThe mod might conflict with others using the same IDs.\r\n\r\nInstallation: \r\nSimply extract the file you wish to use in your skyrim data foulder. Make sure the approriate .esp is checked when launching the game.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I do not take responsability in case, when coming back home, you find your bard sleeping in bed with your spouse/all your weapon display cases are empty and she is gone/last piece of your favourite cake vanished/etc...",
