My horse took an arrow so I was on foot slugging through the mud. He came running at me... this dumb high-born lad thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer - gods I was strong then - caved in his breastplate... probably shattered every rib he had, then stood over him hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted &#34;wait, WAIT&#34;. [chuckles to himself] They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don&#39;t put that part in the songs... stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend their knees like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he&#39;d be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl.

This is the set of armor donned by Robert Baratheon when he takes the field of battle. If you enjoy the &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; TV series or books and wish to take your passions into the world of Skyrim, this set is for you.\r<br />\r<br />After watching the first episode of season two of &#34;The Game of Thrones&#34; I simply had to vent my love for that series into some vessel or another. I chose Skyrim. The result was the epic armor set worn by Robert in his heyday when he slew Rhaegar Targaryen and was considered the second strongest man in all the land - only second to &#34;The Mountain&#34; Gregor Clegane.\r<br />\r<br />This set is largely made from the &#34;Knights of the Nine&#34; armor set made by maty743. When I saw his set, it immediately reminded me of Robert&#39;s armor and I had to make the two meet.\r<br />\r<br />The set is individually made for both genders and all races. As one would expect it is heavy armor only. It has the same stats and crafting requirements as Steel Plate armor.\r<br />\r<br />This set comes with two helmet options - a full plate helm with large antlers, or an antlered crown. I highly suggest using Nivea&#39;s &#34;Winter is Coming&#34; cloaks with this. How appropriate.\r<br />\r<br />Feedback on the armor should be left in the comments section. I will read all the comments made and consider requests for alterations and potential fixes.\r<br />\r<br />** If you like it, endorse it&#33; **\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/r4Lb0.png[/img]\r<br />I would like to take this small space to thank the users of my mods, and the Nexus community at large.
