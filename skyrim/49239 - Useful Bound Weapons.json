  "summary": "Adds four levels to the Mystic Binding perk which greatly increase the usefulness of bound weapons at higher levels.",
  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE: I have added a second version of each file with a different leveling scheme for each perk.  See below for details.\r<br />\r<br />In the vanilla game, Mystic Binding increased the quality of your bound weapons to untempered Daedric.  But with tempered weapons, bound ones become almost completely useless, being outpaced by weapons well below Daedric tier.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds four new levels to the Mystic Binding perk to try to rectify this, making the stats of bound weapons roughly on par with various levels of tempered Daedric.  Note that this only affects the player; no NPCs have had perk levels added, and so will use bound weapons like the vanilla game, though I may change this in the future so that NPCs use the proper level of bound weapons.\r<br />\r<br />The Conjuration levels required for the new Mystic Binding perk levels are as follows:\r<br />Mystic Binding 1 - Level 20 (unchanged from vanilla)\r<br />Mystic Binding 2 - Level 60\r<br />Mystic Binding 3 - Level 70\r<br />Mystic Binding 4 - Level 80\r<br />Mystic Binding 5 - Level 90\r<br />\r<br />For the Alt. Level Reqs versions, the level requirements are slightly different.  There is no change in the strength of the weapons at each level, though:\r<br />\r<br />Mystic Binding 1 - Level 20 (unchanged from vanilla)\r<br />Mystic Binding 2 - Level 40\r<br />Mystic Binding 3 - Level 60\r<br />Mystic Binding 4 - Level 80\r<br />Mystic Binding 5 - Level 100\r<br />\r<br />The new base damages go as follows for each of the bound weapons (these will be modified by your skill levels and perks):\r<br />\r<br />Bound Battleaxe:\r<br />Mystic Binding 1 - 22 (unchanged from vanilla)\r<br />Mystic Binding 2 - 28\r<br />Mystic Binding 3 - 34\r<br />Mystic Binding 4 - 40\r<br />Mystic Binding 5 - 46\r<br />\r<br />Bound Bow:\r<br />Mystic Binding 1 - 24 (unchanged from vanilla)\r<br />Mystic Binding 2 - 28\r<br />Mystic Binding 3 - 32\r<br />Mystic Binding 4 - 36\r<br />Mystic Binding 5 - 40\r<br />\r<br />Bound Dagger (Dragonborn DLC Only):\r<br />Mystic Binding 1 - 10 (unchanged from vanilla)\r<br />Mystic Binding 2 - 17\r<br />Mystic Binding 3 - 21\r<br />Mystic Binding 4 - 27\r<br />Mystic Binding 5 - 32\r<br />\r<br />Bound Sword:\r<br />Mystic Binding 1 - 14 (unchanged from vanilla)\r<br />Mystic Binding 2 - 19\r<br />Mystic Binding 3 - 25\r<br />Mystic Binding 4 - 30\r<br />Mystic Binding 5 - 35\r<br />\r<br />The Mystic Binding 5 weapons are almost identical in strength to Daedric weapons tempered with 100 smithing, Daedric Smithing perk, and +100% Fortify Smithing effects active.\r<br />\r<br />OTHER INFO\r<br />If you want to tweak the weapons, open the mod in the Construction Kit.  In the Object window, go to Items -&gt; Weapons, and find the items &#34;Bound[WEAP]Mystic[LVL],&#34; where &#34;[WEAP]&#34; is &#34;Sword,&#34; &#34;Battleaxe,&#34; or &#34;Bow&#34; and &#34;[LVL]&#34; is 2, 3, 4, or 5 (this tells you what level of Mystic Binding is required to summon the weapons).  For the dagger, look for &#34;DLC2BoundDaggerMystic[LVL].&#34;  Tweak away.  I take no responsibility for anything that breaks as a result of your tweaking.\r<br />\r<br />CONFLICTS\r<br />I have not tested this mod for conflicts, so as usual, make a clean save, backup your save folder, etc etc before running.  This mod will definitely conflict with anything modifying the Mystic Binding perk and vanilla Bound Weapon spells.  It might conflict with anything altering the Conjuration perks in general.  Use at your own risk.\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE\r<br />I have not done extensive testing on this mod yet.  All the damage values seem to work as intended, the bound weapons behave like normal bound weapons, etc etc. and it seems stable.  However, there may be some snag I have yet to encounter, so please let me know if you run into something.\r<br />\r<br />Any input is welcome, whether it&#39;s that something is broken or there&#39;s a balancing issue or whatever.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />Choose which version you want.  If you have the Dragonborn DLC (which adds a bound dagger spell), download &#34;Useful Bound Weapons for Dragonborn&#34;.  If you don&#39;t have Dragonborn, download &#34;Useful Bound Weapons&#34;.  Either install using the Nexus Mod Manager, or download the .rar and extract the .esp within to your SkyrimData folder.\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALLATION\r<br />Deactivate and delete the .esp file.",
