  "descriptionHtml": "This mod removes the essential status from any NPC that has it.  That includes quest NPCs, misc NPCs, and anything else you can think of.  It can easily ruin a quest line, so use it sparringly!\r\n\r\nA feature I want in the future is for a message to pop up upon killing an NPC that will affect a quest line, similar to Morrowind, saying \\\"The Thread of Prophecy is Severed.\\\"  If anyone knows how to script this in, PM me here or on reddit (WaterChestnut3).\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n",
