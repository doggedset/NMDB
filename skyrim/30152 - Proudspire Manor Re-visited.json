Do you think to yourself, \\'Considering this is the most expensive in-game Player House, where is the Smithing area?\\' Annoyed by some of the bugs you encounter? Then this mod is for you![/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#00FF00]The lighting within Proudspire Manor has been re-worked. The really unnaturally bright areas upstairs have been toned down. Lights that were missing have been added, others moved or removed and overall the whole thing is now a much better balanced and pleasing place to be in. \r\nThere were also a few bugs in the game, for instance had you noticed the chest in the bedroom opened the wrong way?! The cooking pot in the kitchen area was bugged too this is now fixed. \r\nThere were many (30 or so) errors in the properties of some of the components making up the house in the CK. Most of these are now fixed. \r\nLastly, what used to be Jordis the Sword Maiden\\'s bedroom is now a fully functional Smithing area. Jordis has been downgraded to a bedroll in the weapon rack area! (I\\'m sure she doesn\\'t mind?!)[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00]Installation:\r\nIMPORTANT Before installing this mod ensure you have removed any items you have stored in Proudspire Manor to avoid them being overwritten and lost!\r\nFor easy installation just use the Nexus Mod Manager.\r\nTo install manually copy the downloaded .esp into your Skyrim\\\\Data folder[/color]\r\n\r\nI hope you find this mod useful? If this mod is not to your taste, then feel free to move along to the next mod.\r\n\r\n[color=#00FFFF]Please take note: If you are using a pirated (ie non Steam enabled) version of the game, please do not leave comments about how this part of my mod or that is not working on your game! I am not prepared to waste my time trying to help you out with your illegal software! I\\'m unemployed, but still manage to pay for my games (they are what keep me sane) so if I can, you should be able to as well![/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000]Version history:\r\nV1.0 Initial release[/color]\r\n\r\nSoulMasterII\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/sm0g9rv24znf_zps9d795d9a.gif[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00]Please DO NOT upload any part of my mod any where else![/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/proudspirelogo_zps0f682792.jpg[/IMG]",
