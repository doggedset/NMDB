  "descriptionHtml": "Jimsin is quite the fighter. His standard is a steel mace, his skills vary from bow and arrow to illusion spells, and any enemy to the stormcloaks best not get in sight.\r<br />\r<br />This is a simple follower mod. He can be found in dragonsreach doing various activities (sitting, eating, ect). It may be odd if you have not taken over whiterun as a stormcloak yet, so he will stand out. If you have taken Whiterun for the Stormcloaks, he is most likely the only one bare-headed.\r<br />\r<br />",
