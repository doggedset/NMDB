  "descriptionHtml": "Thank you, over 500 downloads of, Bardot Preset mod, [never expected that&#33; ] the endorsements are much appreciated, too.  :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Update: Please, be sure you&#39;re running the latest version of the game, 1.9.32.0.8\r<br />\r<br />Bardot 1 & 2 are now presets under Nord female in the character creation--it&#39;s the last preset. Scroll through the presets until the very end and that is Bardot. .::USE ONLY one .esp::. because they both use the same preset slot&#33;::. \r<br />\r<br />Make changes to Bardot anyway you wish, change eye color, hairstyle/color, add warpaint/scars just make her your own (and share a screenie, would love to see your work&#33;). After you have made your character and saved your game, you can remove the .esp file. if you wish. When you first see the preset Bardot will have vanilla hair that you can keep or installed Apachii Hair (link below) for more choices. ~sunsi~\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is a preset of my character named, Bardot, a level 1 Nord. I&#39;ve included screenies that show different hairstyles and colors of hair. If you see a hairstyle and color you like it&#39;s easy enough to make the changes through the *console (*see below). Please, if you have a question post it and I will help to the best of my ability, thank you. \r<br />\r<br />Bardot 1 & 2 differ only in the shape of lips, please, look at the screenies to see the difference and pick the one that appeals to you. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />~Installation~\r<br />Drop in your: C:/Program Files/Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*You can use the console ingame entering &#34;Showracemenu&#34; (without quotation marks) to make changes to Bardot&#39;s face. Be warned though that using &#34;Showracemenu&#34; in the console will reset your stats to default so I would recommend checking out this mod which should prevent this. And don&#39;t forget to change Bardot&#39;s name to your own personal choice&#33; :) \r<br />\r<br />ShowRaceMenu Alternative by Seb263\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20394/? \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />~Required Mods to Obtain the look seen in my images:\r<br />You must have AppachiiSkyHair installed or Bardot will be either bald or have vanilla hair:\r<br />\r<br />ApachiiSkyHair by Apachii\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/?\r<br />\r<br />Other highly recommended mods for the face:\r<br />\r<br />Women of Skyrim female face texture and COMPANIONS by zzjay\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25588/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Women of Skyrim-Enhanced female normalmaps by zzjay (this is the normalmap I use--install AFTER, &#34;Women of Skyrim female face texture and COMPANIONS by zzjay&#34;, and agree to overwrite when asked)\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20483/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The Eyes Of Beauty by Gabriel Mailhot\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Any other mods are a matter of personal taste such as body mods.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />~Uninstall~\r<br />Remove file from: C:/Program Files/Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thank you, for your interesting in my mod, please endorse if you like it, much appreciated.\r<br />If anyone would like to make Bardot into a follower/companion mod you have my permission but please tell me so that I can download her too--I would love to have her as a follower/companion. :)\r<br />\r<br />Contact by PM:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/13927//?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thanks, to zzjay and her fanatstic work that has allowed me to make such a gorgeous character.
