  "summary": "Live inside of a tree! This tree is taller than most mountains, it can be seen from anywhere in Skyrim almost!",
  "descriptionHtml": "               My next mod is in the works, Masser Temple it is called. Masser is the name of Nirn\\'s biggest moon. Nirn is the planet in which all Elder Scrolls take place. First you will be able to travel to a floating island, north of Winterhold and HIGH HIGH up in the sky, were talking many times the height of this tree! I encourage you all to keep an eye open, I am gonna be putting alot of wild ideas into this, including one hell of a dragon boss on the moon, and a giant temple for players to enjoy as their own private abode on the moon(after beating the dragon of course).\r\n\r\n              In the meantime please check out this mod, which adds 10 unique, killable only once, dragons to the game. It is called Dragon Lords. A very imaginative project that works quite flawlessly, and gives a few really tough creatures to avoid for your life at lower levels! And hunt for great loots and spoils at higher levels. I recently helped the author figure out a fix on the LoD textures of his dragons. \r\nCheck the mod out here!: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11206\r\n\r\n                                      ~Endorse if you like please!~\r\n                       ~Heavily inspired by Druid Treehome from Oblivion~\r\n                 ~Lore-Friendly?: Mostly! Elder Scrolls has magic... so why the \r\n                     hell can\\'t it have something akin to a world/mana tree?~\r\n\r\n[youtube]EW_1zC-Gkdw[/youtube]\r\n[youtube]rCwQaTNNgLM[/youtube]\r\n[youtube]GR8no7Z7uR8[/youtube]\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n****NEW VERSION 1.2 IS NOW RELEASED! Here is a list of changes!*****\r\n\r\n-MASSIVE Exterior overhaul! No more FPS lagging, unless you just plain got a crap machine... I can\\'t help you there! \r\n\r\n-Added kitchen! Complete with Dwemer water heater, tap with on off switch, hanging rabbits drip blood, so much detail in such a small kitchen! Great food storage!\r\n\r\n-Revamped and fixed every single light in every Tree cell.\r\n\r\n-TROPICAL FISHIES! They are located in the subterranean, in the only 2 spots with water!\r\n\r\n-Tried to make dragons go around the tree, mostly works, still buggy though, but unless you kite a dragon to the tree... you probably won\\'t ever notice this issue! I just plain recommend not fighting dragons at the tree, why would you bring something that breathes fire willingly to your house made entirely of wood? Derp derp...\r\n\r\n-MANY other minor bug fixes/clipping issues.\r\n\r\n*****IMPORTANT!! - DELETE THE OLD ESP! And PLEASE do a cleansave before updating!(Uninstall my mod, make a clean save, install 1.2... VOILA!)*****\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n*About my Tree of Ages*\r\n\r\n     This is my very first completed player house. I have learned a lot while doing it, and intend to release many more! Inside the house/tree there is a main floor which serves as a place for butterflies to freely come and go from the tree, on this floor you will find a lot of named storage containers for ease of sorting! A bedroom right above the main floor, complete with a balcony about 15% of the way up the tree! A trap door from the main floor will lead to the subterranean beneath the tree, where you will find a portal leading to the sky platform((That\\'s right folks! A overlook of Skyrim from the Treetop, which will serve as a great landing pad for future Dragon mount mods!!!) A crafting area is also located underground(No kitchen or cooking pot, assume the previous owner lived off of the many many mushrooms growing around).\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n*Conflicts* ~~~None so far! Read below...\r\n\r\nShouldn\\'t be any! I made duplicates of any vanilla files I used too so... basically nothing is edited except for the moth script... but so far I don\\'t know any mods that also change their behaviour so.... I have some major mods installed on my machine - Warzones, WiS, Skymomod, and some of the real biggies. I have placed the tree in a spot where it does not conflict with any of them. \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n*Changelog*\r\n\r\n    -Version 1.1\r\n* Added Navmesh! Companions can enter!\r\n* Fixed weird \\\"blue wall glitch\\\" upon entering home.\r\n* Made the bedroom brighter, gave it a chandlier.\r\n* Small lighting fixes and other small bugs! \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n*Credits*\r\n\r\nThank you Nexus for a wonderful opportunity!\r\nThank you Bethesda for a wonderful game!\r\nThank you AtomicDryad of Oblivion, your Enchanted Druid Treehome is what made me want to make this in the first place... I absolutely COULD NOT live in Skyrim without a tree in my name! =D ",
