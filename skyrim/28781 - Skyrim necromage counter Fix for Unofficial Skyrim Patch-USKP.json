  "summary": "",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a mod for anyone who wants to negate the effects of Unoffical Skyrim Patch on Necromage not enhancing your magic by 25% if you\\'re a vampire. Note: If you have already a perk that is not being affected by necromage but is supposed to (like dual flurry), all you have to do is remove the perk through console (player.removeperk X, where X is the ID of the perk). For the enchantments, it DOES NOT show on the armor piece, to see if its working go to Active effects and check the enchantment, if it has been increased ( just times the original enchantment by 1.25). Just make sure it is below all other mods in the load order\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19. i highly recommend it as it fixes alot of Skyrim\\'s bugs. ",
