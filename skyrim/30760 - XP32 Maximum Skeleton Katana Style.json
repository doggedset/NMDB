  "descriptionHtml": "First thing is, this is not my creation. It belongs to XP32 = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800 v1.4\r\n\r\nSecond thing is, because of the nature of this mod, any swords with scabbards and have an lanyard will cause the lanyard to face away from the body. As such, this is only intended for use with swords with scabbards without lanyards. It is also not recommended to use this without a custom race for the same reason. \r\n\r\nAt a request of a friend I flipped the right hand sword and dagger sheath nodes upside down to give the \\\"Katana Style\\\" appearance. The 2h weapon, Quiver, and Bow nodes have also been adjusted to allow for minimum clipping. I reduced clipping as much as I could, while remaining close enough to make things appear not to float. In some cases small clipping was chosen in order to reduce more noticeable acts. Clipping worsens with movement, but reduced as much as possible.\r\n\r\nRequired;\r\nXP32 Maximum Skeleton -XPMS = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800 These files only contain a single edited version of male or female skeletons. \r\nFNIS = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mo1ds/1181 or XP32\\'s arm patch = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800 is also required. And everything else XP32\\'s skeletons require (realistic rag dolls)\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommended;\r\nCustom race that uses a custom skeleton location\r\nMale Nodes were set using 50% weight slider Sundracon\\'s meshes = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488\r\nFemale Nodes were set using 100% weight slider and UNPB body meshes in UNP female armors http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14899 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7305\r\nInsanity\\'s Celtic Katanas = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15389\r\nInsanity\\'s Steel Bow = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29647\r\nBlades Samurai Armour and Kimonos = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24704\r\nArrows (Caspian or Hero) = Ariyan Weapon Pack = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13218\r\n9601 Armed to the Teeth - easy version = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26486\r\nOther results will vary.\r\n\r\nRequired Installation; Manual Installation only.
