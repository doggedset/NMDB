  "descriptionHtml": "This mod overwrites or adds new music to most of the game. I added new music to the exploration and cities of the game and I wrote over the normal combat music and dungeon music. There are three esp\\'s and a music file. Just simply extract them to your \\\"Data\\\" directory. esp1 is new dungeon and combat music, esp2 is new exploration music and esp3 adds new music to the towns. If you like the music from the vanilla game just simply turn off the esp file that you don\\'t like. The music is not mine. You can add it to your own mods or do what ever you like with it. Unless smoking hot chicks are going to fall out of the sky and have intercourse with me for making this mod then I don\\'t care about getting credit for this mod either. If you like it you can have it. If you hate it don\\'t bother telling me about it becuase I don\\'t care.",
