  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]Mod requested by LordAvernus on the nexus forums.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232]Version 1.0.2 and up have a different .ESP file name than earlier versions (just added spacing). This will keep for all future versions (if there are any).[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]What was done:\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[list][*][size=2]Created a separate two-handed version.[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Sounds and animations are Two-handed replicating a Daedric Warhammer.[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Allowed improving, and improvement to benefit from the Daedric Smithing perk (if it does not for some reason let me know; did not change the Original Mace).[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Created a recipe that requires you to use the Original Mace, 1 Daedra Heart, 2 Ebony Ingots, and 2 Leather Strips (the difference of items in crafting a Daedric Warhammer minus the materials of a Daedric Mace. With the addition of a Daedra Heart being used to reforge the artifact)[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Created a recipe to allow you to convert it back into the one-handed at the cost of a Daedra heart. (Couldn&#39;t think of a suitable replacement for reforging an artifact.)[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Guards will comment just as they would for the Original Mace of Molag Bal. (will interfere with anything editing that guard comment.)[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list][size=3]\r<br />Recipes are found under the Daedric category, but do not require the Daedric Smithing perk (this can be changed if preferred, might make a second version with the requirement). They are revealed when the quest is successfully completed and the corresponding Weapon is in your inventory.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]Tempering requires Arcane Blacksmith perk (same as Original).[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#e06666][size=3]Current Issues:[/size]\r<br />[/color][list][*][color=#e06666][size=2]NONE, other than the need of a larger model. Let me know if you find something wrong, or can provide a larger model.[/size][/color][/*]\r<br />[/list][size=3]\r<br />I am a horrible artist. So I&#39;ve just used the original model and modified a setting in nifskope.\r<br />\r<br />If anyone is able to create a larger/better model you are free to improve it yourself. Or you can PM me and I&#39;ll put the model into this one (crediting you of course, unless you don&#39;t want me to for some reason).\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/190804]x_kain_x[/url]Â for pointing me in the right direction about the invisible weapon issue.\r<br />\r<br />PERMISSIONS:\r<br />Anyone is free to take and use this without asking. I own nothing other than the time used to make it.[/size]",
