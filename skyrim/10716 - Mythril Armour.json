  "descriptionHtml": "I always liked the look of Steel Plate armor, I think it looks pretty bad ass, Anyway, As I always play a magical, or mage role in skyrim, Or most of the TES games, I couldn\\'t use the awesome armor, as It was heavy, I\\'ve created this file to fix this, and for all other mages, So that you can look awesome, AND be a good spell caster, I\\'ve set the enchants similiar to the best mage gear you can get, (Arch-Mage robes enchant on the Steel Plate Breastplate, Ect.)\r\n\r\nI called it \\'Mythril Armor\\' as I think the name fits, As Mythril in many games is considered a magical metal.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod :p - I might consider re-texturing it later, and when I find out how to.\r\n\r\nThis armour in-game is located in the \\'Hall of the Elements\\' In the collage of winterhold, On the floor.",
