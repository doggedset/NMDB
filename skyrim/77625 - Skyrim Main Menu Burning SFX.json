  "descriptionHtml": "Hello&#33; I have been using a mod called Smoking Hot Main Menu for the longest time, and although I may not know how to make real mods, I found out long ago how to replace the main theme with a custom song or sound. Since I found the vanilla main theme to be annoying and the beautiful flames from SHMM to be somewhat lacking, I decided to replace the main theme with a simple SFX of a fire burning, to compliment SHMM.\r<br />\r<br />It has been several years since I did this, but for some reason I never thought to upload it until now. So here you are&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Also for your customization convenience, I have included a lite version and a heavy version along with the preview/source files. The lite version is the original that I personally use, consisting of quiet, fireplace type sound with lots of crackling wood pops. The heavy version, which I included just for you all, has less crackling and more rumbling, bass-ey sounds you might expect from a large and powerful fire. (Sadly the heavy version is a shorter loop, however, as that is how the source file is.)\r<br />\r<br />It is intended to be used alongside the Smoking Hot Main Menu mod By SparrowPrince, which is included in his bundle, The Ruffled Feather, found under the Misc. category on the S.T.E.P. Project.

It should now sound almost infinite in time even though it&#39;s so short.\r<br />\r<br />Ive kept the original Heavy version intact and added the new, better version alongside it as Heavy V2. This way you can hear the difference for yourself.\r<br />Simply extract the desired Data folder into Skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />For installation, simply download the .zip file and extract the desired Data folder into Skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE CHOOSE ONLY ONE FILE.\r<br />\r<br />Preview/source files included.\r<br />\r<br />If you like it please vote and endorse, and let me know if you have any problems or ideas.\r<br />\r<br />~xtreemgamer129 (Vampire Woona on Steam)",
