  "summary": "A subtle remodel of Breezehome with a few Thieves Guild easter egg items througout the rooms.",
  "descriptionHtml": "  I had been searching for a remodel of Breezehome that added enough extras to be functional but not lore breaking. I found a Breezehome Crafting mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8278\r\n(credit to the mod author for these areas) BUT it still didn\\'t feel right. Borrowing the model from the crafting mod I remodeled it and all the rooms.\r\n\r\nCrafting area will be unlocked when you purchase the Lab area to upgrade your home.\r\n \r\nCHANGES:\r\n\r\nver. 1.1a\r\n-Finally found a fix for the mannequin issue. They will not ghost in the livingroom before taking their place.\r\n \r\nver. 1.1\r\n-WARNING! Removed chest in far room of crafting area near the ore shelf. Replaced it with a different chest. Remove items from old chest before updating!\r\n-Added display cases to crafting area and livingroom.\r\n-Adjusted lighting with new knowledge to enhance affects.\r\n\r\nver. 1.0\r\n-Removed, changed and readjusted lighting in all rooms to flow and light rooms better.\r\n-Added Thieves Guild easter egg items throughout the house.\r\n-Major remodel to livingroom setup.... feels more lived in.\r\n-Added more maniquins, weapon display, and bookshelves to rooms.\r\n-Removed the old Lab walls near kitchen to create an open friendly reading/sitting room.\r\n-Replaced all funiture where needed with Noble furniture.\r\n\r\n  With all changes made I stayed true to Lore and made sure to not break an immersive atmosphere.",
