Its desgined for &#39;alternative start&#39; chars and has everything you need in the beginning of a new game. It also adds a small hunting ground around the cottage. \r<br />A friend of mine asked me if I could create a little house for his char somewhere in the wildness and this is the result. Its my first mod that is worth to be uploaded, I know this player home is not that awesome. I hope you will enjoy it. Fell free to comment and leave some screens :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/17244-1-1337544355.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[list] [*] Small Player Home in the boondocks of Rift.

The animation suddenly aborts when my char takes a piece wood from the pile. I couldnt figure out why this happens :/ I gave the mod to my friend and he had no problems at all. \r<br />At the moment the cottage is not companion friendly. Maybe i will change this in the next days...\r<br />\r<br />[u]Change Log[/u]\r<br />Removed a very bad spelling mistake that completely changed the meaning of the mod -.- however you dont have to download the file again since I didnt spell anything wrong in the mod...\r<br />\r<br />[u]Credits[/u]\r<br />Bethesda for the great game and for the awesome Creation Kit&#33;",
