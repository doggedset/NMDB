  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Verdana][size=3][b][u][color=#f4f4f4]Introduction:[/color][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod overhauls your gameplay as a destruction mage by allowing you to completely freeze your foes before striking them down with any aimed fire spell for 3x damage.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=#f4f4f4]How to use the mod:[/color]\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />You freeze your enemies by consentrating at them with the vanilla [i]frostbite[/i] spell for six seconds. The freeze effect lasts for six seconds, and while the target is frozen, all aimed fire damage destruction spells ([i]firebolt[/i], [i]fireball[/i], [i]incinerate[/i]) will deal three times the normal damage and their freeze effect will also get dispelled.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=#f4f4f4]FYI:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b]FYI means for your information FYI. Please note that this is the first ever mod that I have ever made ever, and I started working on it mainly for the practise. This probably means that it will have a lot of nasty bugs, and that I will most likely abandon this mod unless it somehow gets a lot of attention all of a sudden, which I highly doubt (as you could probably tell from my creative mod title btw). Sorry to all the people who approved of the idea and wanted me to keep working on it, but you know what they say: [i][color=#ffffff]One shitty door closes, another mod comes out.[/color]\r<br />[/i][/size][/font]",
