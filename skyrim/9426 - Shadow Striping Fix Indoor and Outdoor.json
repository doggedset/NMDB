  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small and simple mod that will fix those annoying and disgusting shadows in houses and other areas.\r\n\r\nBasically the main cause of these radial shadow defects is a low shadow depth bias, which ironically, states in the Creation Kit Wiki that a low (or to quote \\\"A poor Shadow Depth Bias\\\") can cause these defects.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this mod may cause an FPS drop on certain machines, and this mod should be compatible with most if not all mods which may exclude ones that change the lighting conditions in the affected areas.\r\n\r\nBy request, this has been uploaded because some steam users cannot download due to regional problems.\r\n\r\nPlease also remember to notify me if you find any more shadow problems, and I will try to fix it as quickly as possible :D\r\n\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=7945]Original Steam Mod Page[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpanish Version: [URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11095]Here[/URL] Translated by Frodo45127",
