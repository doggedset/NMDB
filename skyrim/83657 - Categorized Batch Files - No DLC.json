  "descriptionHtml": "[center]Today, I&#39;ve made a large collection of batch files for base Skyrim without DLC for those times when I do not want to go farm for items. Rather than just lumping every item into one file, I&#39;ve separated them into multiple themed files. Even though I only added base game items, these files should work with DLC. DLC only items just won&#39;t be added. I&#39;ve limited most items to ten per console use so that inventories are not completely weighed down.\r<br />\r<br />For those of you who do not know what a batch file is, it is a simple text document containing multiple console commands, with one on each line. By running the bat command in Skyrim&#39;s console, you can execute multiple commands at once.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]A brief overview of the files (You can view the files once you&#39;ve downloaded them with a text editor to see exactly what is given):[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]AllAlchemyIngredients-[/color] This file gives you ten of every alchemy ingredient each time run it.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]AllAnimalParts-[/color] This file gives you ten of every hide, pelt, leather, chitin, dragon bone/scale and troll skull.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]AllAtronachForgeItems-[/color] This file gives you ten charcoal, brooms, centurion cores,empty wine bottles, rolls of paper and ruined books.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]AllDivineAmulets-[/color] Give one of each Amulet of (Divine Name).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]AllEnchantments-[/color] Gives you a bunch of enchanted items that can be used at an enchanting table to disenchant so that you learn it.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]AllGems-[/color] Gives ten of each common and flawless gem.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]AllIngots-[/color] Gives ten of each ingot crafted at a smelter.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]AllSmeltingIngredients-[/color] Gives ten of each ore as well as ten of each Dwemer metal type.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]AllSoulGemsEmpty-[/color] Gives ten empty soul gems of each tier, including Black, plus one each of Azura&#39;s Star and The Black Star.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]AllSoulGemsFull-[/color] Gives ten full soul gems of each tier, including Black.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]AllSpellTomes-[/color] This gives one of every spell tome that can be acquired in game.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]AllTools-[/color] Gives one thousand septims, ten lockpicks, ten torches, one pickaxe and one woodcutter&#39;s axe.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]ActualLevelUp-[/color] This file repeats the level up of every skill 81 times. It does not add perks or health/magicka/stamina. After running it, you&#39;ll have to manually apply points. I did it this way to avoid issues and bugs in regards to improper leveling.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]AmazingStats-[/color] This is a very small and simple file that uses the player.forceav command to permanently set health, magicka, stamina and carry capacity to a high number. 1000 for Health, Magicka and Stamina. 100,000 for Carry Capacity. These can be changed to your preference easily.\r<br /> \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]-Installation-[/color]\r<br />Download InventoryBatch.rar\r<br />Unzip with WinZip, SevenZip, WinRar or whichever unzipping utility you use.\r<br />Place all or your choice of ,txt files into Skyrim&#39;s base installation directory, NOT the Data folder.\r<br />For 64 bit users, it should look something like Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim.\r<br />Once in game, open the console with the tilde key (~) if you&#39;re using an American keyboard. I don&#39;t know what key it is for foreign keyboards.\r<br />Depending on which file you want to use, type the following- &#34;bat filename&#34;Â  without the quotation marks.\r<br />Press Enter then press the tilde key again to close the console.\r<br />\r<br />Check out my other mods:[/center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38216/?][center]Thieves Guild Rebuilder[/center][/url]",
