Why I&#39;ve been doing that is some kind of a mind puzzle: since they&#39;re mostly tagging along behind me, I hardly get a chance to enjoy the view at all anyway...\r<br />\r<br />Whether they resented me for not paying attention enough to their lovely UNP curves and clean skins or for selfishly freezing their butts in High Hrothgar, I&#39;m not sure, but they nevertheless set their minds on inflicting the same revigorating icy-butt experience on my poor male character whenever they could lay their hands on a forge or a tanning rack.\r<br />\r<br />This time I thought I was safe though, fighting Molag Bal and some confusing civil war in a parallel place and time strangely called &#34;ESO&#34; (no follower nor housecarls there my friends, can you imagine a post-Skyrim Tamriel where your actually HAVE to carry your own burden?&#33;.. a Nirn gone wrong, I tell you). Anyway, yeah, I thought my lovely housecarls were fast asleep in a warm and cozy place called &#34;Save 1277&#34; but no - the minute I pushed that save 1277 door, they were there, eagerly waiting for me to try this new armor on&#33;..\r<br />\r<br />And I tell you: that cod piece is the worst revenge they could possibly think of, it&#39;s cold, it&#39;s damn uncomfortable, it&#39;s... well, why don&#39;t you try it on and tell me?\r<br />[line]\r<br />Â \r<br />[color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=4][b]MOD DESCRIPTION:[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This standalone, modular armor is made of broken pieces of the Vanilla Iron Armor which can now be crafted and worn separately from each other to create a different kind of equipment to your liking. Most pieces can be mixed and matched with my other armors too.\r<br />\r<br />Under the Iron section at the forge, you&#39;ll find 10 new items:\r<br />- Iron Cod Piece (underwear): using the body slot (32)\r<br />- Bare-chested Pauldron (modeled close to the body so there&#39;s no awkward gap): slot 58\r<br />- Cuirass Pauldron (modeled to be worn on top of the cuirass): slot 58\r<br />- Light cuirass (no pauldron): slot 56\r<br />- Heavy Cuirass (with right pauldron): slot 56\r<br />- Fur Belt (identical to the Vanilla one): slot 55\r<br />- Plated Belt (no fur, only one plated thigh): slot 55\r<br />- High Boots (never understood why Vanilla boots don&#39;t protect the knees): feet slot (37)\r<br />- Wristguard (gloveless): hands slot (33)\r<br />- Wolf Fur Cloak (from the bandit armor): slot 46\r<br />\r<br />This should give you 25 different possible combinations. When all worn together, this&#39;ll give you a base armor rating of 31 - slightly higher than Vanilla.\r<br />\r<br />Do note that this first upload is skinned for Sundracon&#39;s male Body mesh.\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=4][b]REQUIREMENTS:[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Chris57&#39;s Better Males body mesh - Sundracon&#39;s version: [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2488]Better Males[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Yeah, yeah, I know... I&#39;ll probably have to convert it all to Favored Soul&#39;s body mesh too (sorry guys, I don&#39;t use it so I&#39;m really doing this only for you).\r<br />\r<br />I may do a Vanilla version if I find time too (without the Cod Piece of course) (you won&#39;t miss much...).\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=4][b]INSTALLATION:[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Just use NMM - you won&#39;t have to overwrite anything at all.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation is just as easy and perfectly safe. Nothing in these files can harm your game in any way.\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=4][b]HOW TO GET IT IN GAME:[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />It all can be crafted any forge, under the Iron section - no perks required. All items can of course be tempered at the workbench and enchanted at any enchanting table.\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=4][b]TEXTURES:[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This upload does not contain any other textures than the ones I did for the Cod Piece leather parts. The Nifs will use whichever texture you have installed for the Vanilla Iron Armor - Vanilla if you have not installed any, or much much better: aMidianBorn&#39;s beautiful textures for his &#34;Book of Silence&#34;, these are the ones I&#39;m using in my screenshots: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24909][b][color=#548dd4]aMidianBorn Book of Silence[/color][/b][/url]\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=4][b]COMPATIBILITY AND ISSUES:[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s only a standalone armor so it should not conflict with anything at all, provided you&#39;re using the right body mod.\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s only one minor thing I&#39;m not entirely satisfied with right now: both belts use exactly the same vertices skin settings as the Vanilla armor at the moment, which means they also have exactly the same issues, like the tip of the belt floatting awkwardly in mid air half the time - I&#39;ll reskin them at some point, but I just did not feel like coping with skirtbones again right now.\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=4][b]SCREENSHOTS:[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />The beautiful shield I&#39;m using is from FavoredSoul&#39;s Ultimate Assortment: [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39959]Ultimate Assortment by FavoredSoul[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />The Bandana is from Volvaga0&#39;s Bandanas of Skyrim:  [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20900]Bandanas of Skyrim[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=4][b]ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND THANKS:[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Nightasy, as always, for teaching me 3D modeling and texturing.\r<br />- Sundracon for his great body mod.\r<br />- the Nexus for creating such a nice place for us to share our fantasies.\r<br />- and of course Bethesda, for great and inspiring games as well as for giving us the Creation Kit.\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=4][b]MY OTHER MODS:[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Revenge of the Sexified Housecarls - Hoamaii Mashup for Male (a modular Falmer armor for guys): [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35333]Revenge of the Sexified Housecarls[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Revenge of the Sexified Housecarls II - Hoamaii Inner Wear for male: [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35940]Hoamaii Inner Wear for Male[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Revenge of the Sexified Housecarls III - Hoamaii Gannicus armor: [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39730]Gannicus Modular Armor[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Have Pita On Lydia - Hoamaii Meat Sandwich: [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57435]Hoamaii Meat Sandwich[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Wine and Beer in Tankards - animobjects and static objets replacers: [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59260]Wine and Beer In Tankards[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- or my animated house mod: [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62903]Clearsky Hideout - Fully Animated Playerhouse[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]CAk4FO8YtrU[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />TOOLS USED:\r<br />- Autodesk 3DS Max\r<br />- NifSkope\r<br />- PhotoShop\r<br />- Gimp\r<br />- Bethesda&#39;s Creation Kit.\r<br />\r<br />And, yep, nothing has changed, I&#39;m still French, so please keep forgiving my French...
