Animals inflict diseases occationally. Poisons you buy/make yourself work as they worked before, this mod doesn&#39;t boost poisons generally. \r<br />\r<br />Trying to keep balance in the game. \r<br />\r<br />=== About the mod \r<br />\r<br />Tuned Skyrim a little bit harder for those, who have leveled enough to notice nature isn&#39;t so tough anymore... Starting game (from level 1) with this mod enabled may turn wild nature into place you least wanna go wandering. \r<br />\r<br />=== Main reasons for this mod \r<br />\r<br />I didn&#39;t like the fact that items (such as gold or gems) can be found when looting dead animals corpses. Also, poisons didn&#39;t affect me much in the vanilla game, nor the diseases. They were all too weak, so had to improve them. Made poison effects last longer (just to make them annoying) and diseases really show now in stats. \r<br />\r<br />=== Tips \r<br />\r<br />New spells can be learned from the books that are placed in the Arcanaeum, in College of Winterhold. \r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s a new book called &#34;Cooking with Balbus&#34; which can be bought from merchants. Somebody from Rorikstead owns a copy of that book also. \r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s also a new book called &#34;Animal kingdom&#34; which can be found from a cave located next to alchemist&#39;s shack, southwest from Ivarstead. This book reveals facts about animals and creatures, levels etc. in which they are. \r<br />\r<br />Never go wandering into the (harsh) nature without cure/heal potions, or you might end up dead. Casting a cure spell consumes lots of mana. \r<br />\r<br />=== Big changes \r<br />\r<br />This mod edits ingredients effects so that it&#39;s not possible anymore for player to make Cure disease -potions. \r<br />\r<br />Cure poison- and Cure disease -potions are quite rare and valuable, only way to get them is buy them. Or have good luck when looting chests. When you have luck to find them, better get and stock &#39;em.",
