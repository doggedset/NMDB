Maybe he&#39;s not even a horse, but instead the amalgamated essence of awesome. He has existed since before the beginning of time - some Wobumsologists even believe he created time.  Wobums is a shape shifting fiend who knows neither fear nor pain. His stamina and speed are unending, and his acute awareness of just how awesome he is makes him truly dangerous.  Let&#39;s face it, you&#39;re not really worthy of his company, but Wobums gets bored from time to time and is willing to share his companionship with you (you lucky dog).  Besides, he&#39;s actually very nice -- just don&#39;t call him a pony, he doesn&#39;t like that.\r<br />\r<br />[color=mediumpurple][size=5pt]Requirements[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />In order for the hotkeys to function you&#39;ll need to have the latest version of [url=http://skse.silverlock.org]SKSE[/url] installed correctly (refer to the documentation provided with it for instructions). You&#39;ll also need [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/?]SkyUI[/url] installed to use the mod configuration menu.  Neither SkyUI nor SKSE is actually required to use this mod, only if you want hotkeys and the MCM.  You will also not be able to change Wobums&#39; speed in-game without SkyUI, everything else will function though.  For more info on the hotkeys, just scroll on down the page.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://55540b455f5888f5aa0276ef81d8c2bbb108e5c2.googledrive.com/host/0B7_kzmK2bG9dYWY3UnRIRWYwSXM/DweWobums.jpg[/img][img]https://55540b455f5888f5aa0276ef81d8c2bbb108e5c2.googledrive.com/host/0B7_kzmK2bG9dYWY3UnRIRWYwSXM/ShadowWobums.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=mediumpurple][size=5pt]Attributes[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[ul]\r<br />[*]Invulnerable to all damage including fall damage\r<br />[*]Variable speed\r<br />[*]Can sprint forever\r<br />[*]Will follow and wait on command\r<br />[*]Can shape shift at will\r<br />[*]Can carry your items for you\r<br />[*]Won&#39;t get in your way during a fight\r<br />[*]Fuzzy luvy duvy cuteness\r<br />[*]Will warm the cockles of your heart\r<br />[*]And of course, an awesome name\r<br />[/ul]\r<br />[color=mediumpurple][size=5pt]Call Wobums[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />There is a call Wobums spell. It, obviously, calls Wobums to you.  &#34;How do I get it?&#34;, you ask.  &#34;Well, you don&#39;t have to do sh*t, actually&#34;, I respond.  As soon as you start the game with the mod loaded, the spell will be added to your spell list if you don&#39;t already have it.  If you do already have it because you used a previous version of this mod, then, well, you don&#39;t need it because you already have it, so why are you even reading this?  Anyway, you can find the spell listed under &#34;powers&#34;, and you use it like you would a shout.  Cast once to call Wobums to your side, and cast again to tell him to wait -- simple eh?  It&#39;s important to note (and so I am) that whenever Wobums is currently following you, you should notice another spell in your list called &#34;Wobums is Following&#34;.  This is important because using this spell will allow you to access Wobums&#39; Preferences.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://55540b455f5888f5aa0276ef81d8c2bbb108e5c2.googledrive.com/host/0B7_kzmK2bG9dYWY3UnRIRWYwSXM/JumpWhite.jpg[/img][img]https://55540b455f5888f5aa0276ef81d8c2bbb108e5c2.googledrive.com/host/0B7_kzmK2bG9dYWY3UnRIRWYwSXM/JumpBlack.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />[color=mediumpurple][size=5pt]Preferences[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=silver][center][size=4pt][u]Appearance[/u][/size][/center][/color]\r<br />So, you don&#39;t like the boring regular black horse look, do you?  &#34;No&#34;, you respond.  &#34;Well STFU I don&#39;t have to take crap from you&#33;  Haha jk, jk.&#34; I reply.  To change Wobums&#39; appearance all you need to do is: Step 1 - Open the preferences menu.  &#34;How do I do that?&#34;, you ask because you obviously haven&#39;t been paying attention.  All you need to do is use the &#34;Wobums is Following&#34; spell, which will be in your powers list [color=mediumpurple]whenever Wobums is following you[/color].  The menu will then pop up, and you will then: Step 2 - Select &#34;Appearance&#34;, RIGHT? OK.  There are a total of fourteen different skins to choose from, nine different armors, and three different saddles.  Feel free to mix and match as you please.  Or you could just remove all of Wobums&#39; garments and go skinny dipping together.  Pleasant.\r<br />\r<br />[color=silver][center][size=4pt][u]Hotkeys[/u][/size][/center][/color]\r<br />It&#39;s annoying to have to select and activate the &#34;Call Wobums&#34; or &#34;Wobums is Following&#34; spell every time you want to use them, right?  Well then don&#39;t. Set up some hotkeys, darn you.  The easiest way to set up the hotkeys if you have SkyUI installed is to just use the mod config menu.  Otherwise, you can set them up using the preferences menu.  &#34;How do I do tha--&#34;, you attempt to say before I sucker punch you in the...knee (ha).  Read above if you STILL can&#39;t open the preferences menu.  Select &#34;Settings&#34;, and then &#34;Hotkeys&#34;.  In order to avoid conflicts with other mods, the hotkeys are initially disabled.  So now select &#34;Enable Hotkeys&#34; and follow the on screen instructions to your heart&#39;s content.  Don&#39;t worry, you can disable them if you hate it.  [color=mediumpurple]Again, the hotkey functionality requires the latest version of SKSE to be installed in order for it to work.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=silver][center][size=4pt][u]Wobums Tracker[/u][/size][/center][/color]\r<br />Even though you have a call Wobums spell that will get Wobums to you within a minute and thirty seconds, do you still HAVE to know where Wobums is at all times?  Do you wake up in the middle of the night frightened and worried that Wobums might leave you forever?  Do you feel the need to hunt him down if he doesn&#39;t show up fast enough?  Is your love of Wobums borderline unethical? First of all: WHOA THERE BUDDY, calm down.  Second of all: You can enable or disable a map marker for Wobums whenever you want, so that should satiate your...needs.  To activate it either check it as enabled in the MCM or open the preferences menu and select &#34;Settings&#34;, and then &#34;Enable/Disable Wobums Tracker&#34;. You can also set up a convenient hotkey for the tracker.  By default the tracker is disabled.\r<br />\r<br />[color=silver][center][size=4pt][u]Saddlebag[/u][/size][/center][/color]\r<br />Do you carry a lot of shenanigans?  Do those damn dragons keep dying and pilling their shenanigans all over the place forcing you to pick up their shenanigans?  Do you find yourself so over-encumbered by so many shenanigans all the time that you end up installing mods just to lighten the weight of said shenanigans?  Do you see where I&#39;m going? Are you getting really tired of endless questions and the word shenanigans?  &#34;Yes&#34;, you reply.  Awesome.  Yeah, Wobums will carry your shenanigans for you in his saddlebag.  To access it either 1. Enter sneak mode and then activate Wobums.  Or 2. Open the preferences menu and select &#34;Inventory&#34;.  There.  Your shenanigans are stored and you&#39;re ready to carry on with more shenanigans.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://55540b455f5888f5aa0276ef81d8c2bbb108e5c2.googledrive.com/host/0B7_kzmK2bG9dYWY3UnRIRWYwSXM/FrosWobums.jpg[/img][img]https://55540b455f5888f5aa0276ef81d8c2bbb108e5c2.googledrive.com/host/0B7_kzmK2bG9dYWY3UnRIRWYwSXM/BoneWobums.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=mediumpurple][size=5pt]Chillax[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s true that Wobums could probably destroy the world with one kick of his hoof, but that&#39;s just not how he rolls.  He&#39;d much rather just hang out, relax and have a good time. One of his favorite pass times? Boating.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://55540b455f5888f5aa0276ef81d8c2bbb108e5c2.googledrive.com/host/0B7_kzmK2bG9dYWY3UnRIRWYwSXM/BoatHalfSize.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=mediumpurple][size=5pt]Changes[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[u]Version2.4: MCM&#33;[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[ul]\r<br />[*]Support for the SkyUI Mod Configuration Menu has been implemented.

The script for hotkeys has been re-written to be less intensive, as such you&#39;ll have to re-enable hotkeys if you were previously using them.\r<br />[*]Wobums Tracker: You can toggle the Wobums Tracker on and off in the MCM.  Optionally, you can also set it to a hotkey.\r<br />[*]Uninstall: There is an uninstall button for Wobums in the MCM that prepares the mod to be uninstalled.\r<br />[/ul]\r<br />    [color=orange]WHAT NOT TO DO AFTER UPDATING TO VERSION 2.4:[/color]\r<br />[ul]\r<br />[*]Do not load a save game where you are currently riding Wobums.  The original Wobums ref was removed and no longer exists, so if you were riding Wobums and loaded that save, he&#39;ll be gone but you&#39;ll still riding him.  That&#39;s just a weird situation.\r<br />[*]Do not panic when Wobums is suddenly not located where you left him, just call him normally and he&#39;ll show up.\r<br />[*]Do not pat Wobums on the head and call him adorable, because he is, and he already knows that.\r<br />[/ul]\r<br />    Other improvements:\r<br />[ul]\r<br />[*]The Wobums follow script has been improved so that Wobums finds you and follows you better than he did previously.\r<br />[*]Support for non SkyUI users is still implemented and has been updated, except for changing Wobums&#39; speed.
