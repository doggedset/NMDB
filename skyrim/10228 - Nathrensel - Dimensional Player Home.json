  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red][size=5][b]IMPORTANT: IF UPGRADING FROM NATHRENSEL 0.1b, REMOVE ALL ITEMS FROM SATCHELS AND STORAGE.[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i295.photobucket.com/albums/mm126/tylerapt/logo.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\nHome is only a spell away with Nathrensel, the Lair of the Stars, a simple player home that combines dwemer and crystaline architecture into a beautiful, ethereal zone both comfortable and wondrously alien all at the same time. \r\n\r\nNathrensel contains a home, a forgehall, a laboratory, and a small vendor\\'s shack, containing all that your transdimensional Dovahkiin needs to function. Whether out around town or deep within the darkest dungeon, Nathrensel is at your fingertips.\r\n\r\nThis mod is a must-have for mages, those hungering for convenience, and fans of the color blue. Tomes that teach the spell \\\"Transpose Self\\\" needed to access Nathrensel can be found at Belethor\\'s shop in Whiterun, and sold by Farengar Secret-Fire.\r\n\r\nThis is a beta mod, but is definitely up and running. However much will be added to Nathrensel in the very near future, and your input is essential to help me decide the future of this mod, and the structure it will take.\r\n\r\nA VERY SPECIAL THANKS TO: DarkenDE, for their Dimensional Rift mod, the inspiration for this one. I also have incorporated their Papyrus script into this mod, with permission, because Papyrus refuses to be vulnerable to any form of my understanding. You can find the Dimensional Rift mod below, at this link:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8261\r\n\r\n[b]CURRENTLY HAS:[/b]\r\n - Easy access\r\n - Skyforge, smelter, crafting table, grindstone, and leather rack\r\n - Alchemy lab, Enchanting table\r\n - Shrines to the Nine Divines and Nocturnal\r\n - Lore-friendly books explaining a smattering of backstory\r\n - Bedchamber with cooking pot\r\n - Vendor services\r\n - Storage\r\n - Large Bookshelf\r\n - Archery/Target Range\r\n\r\n[b]UPCOMING CHANGES:[/b]\r\n - MORE Bookshelves\r\n - Mannequins\r\n - Museum\r\n - Library\r\n - Anything else you\\'d like to see, so let me know!\r\n\r\n[b]CHANGELOG:[/b]\r\n\r\n0.1b: Initial Release\r\n - Includes bedchamber, vendor, alchemy/enchanting lab, shrines, and blacksmithing area.\r\n\r\n0.2b:\r\n - Added extra lighting\r\n - Added target practice range.
