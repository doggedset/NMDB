  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very simple texture mod to restore the original textures in the BSA that for some reason Beth decided not to use. It makes no sense to me, not only do the original textures exist in the texture BSA but the in game dialog supports that Frost spiders are supposed to be colored white.\r\n\r\nIn Riverwood Frodnar speaking to Dorthe about his dog Stump says we wants to attach branches to stump, paint them white and \\\"instant Frostbite Spider.\\\"\r\n\r\nAlso all Frost Prefix monsters are white. Frost Trolls, Frost Dragons, etc.\r\n\r\nI also added another 4 small eyes to give the spider 8 total eyes. If you even see them I\\'ll be surprised.",
