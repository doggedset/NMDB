  "descriptionHtml": "Partial retexture of the Stormcloak closed helmet.\r\nAdded floral pattern to the beige area on the top of the helmet. \r\nThis will replace the vanilla texture.\r\n\r\nI intend to create a proper version of  this mod that will allow you to select and delete it via the mod manager.\r\nI also intend to retexture the cloth as well for the helmet and cuirass. \r\n\r\nINSTALLATION \r\nExtract the \\'textures\\' folder into the Skyrim Data folder.\r\nThe original file will not be affected by this and will be there for when you want to uninstall the mod.\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION\r\nSimply delete the files copied to the Data folder. You may have other mods in the texture folder, so take care only to remove the file(s) relevant to this mod. \r\n\r\nThis mod was made using the High Res Texture Pack update. This may be required for the mod to work.\r\n\r\nCredit to Baraban for his amazing mod which you can see me using in one of the pictures.\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=90442981",
