  "descriptionHtml": "[Description]\r<br />This is just a small HTA file of the Creation kit papyrus reference page [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Category:Papyrus]This one[/url]. cleaned up a lot of the junk not needed in the file.Â \r<br />This mod comes in two different versions one thats packed into a SFX Archive and one that&#39;s just the bare bone hta file with the appropriate files folder (DO NOT DELETE THE FILES FOLDER THAT COMES WITH IT)\r<br />\r<br />The links open up in a new browser window.\r<br />\r<br />This is a completely safe mod as its just a html file but it has an extension of hta which converts the html into a application.\r<br />\r<br />[Version]\r<br />1.0\r<br />\r<br />[Q&A]\r<br />Q: What is a hta file?\r<br />A: hta files are not well known but it stands for HTML Application. [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application]Read more on the hta files here[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Q: Whats a SFX Archive?\r<br />A: SFX Archives are Self Extracting Archives (with a .exe extention) I have set up the SFX Archive to unpack the files to a temporary directory and run the hta file after extraction (it does this but you cant tell because I hid the extraction window)(This basically makes it function like any other .exe program you have)\r<br />\r<br />Q: How do I find a specific function in the long list?\r<br />A: HTA files themselves have a find function built in. To initialize the find window just press Ctrl+F (Note you have to close the find window before clicking on one of the links)\r<br />\r<br />[Installation]\r<br />   [SFX Archive Version]\r<br />      -Extract and put anywhere you want on your computer\r<br />\r<br />   [HTA Version]\r<br />      -Extract both the HTA and the folder that contains this string &#34;_files&#34; to the same directory (if you dont extract the folder the HTA file won&#39;t have any pics or css styles.)\r<br />\r<br />[Credits]\r<br />   -Bethesda Game studios \r<br />All credit goes to Bethesda Game studios for making their papyrus API available to the community. (This mod is just a cleaned up version of that API page. I thought it would be nice to have the complete API functions in one page)",
