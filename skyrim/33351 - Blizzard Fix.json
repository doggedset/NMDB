The damage it deals should also be a bit more consistent.\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\n\r\nQ: Blizzard still isn't working! This mod sucks!\r\nA: That's not a question - but Blizzard only affects NPCs which are hostile to the player. This mod doesn't change that.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nPlace the contents of the archive in your Skyrim/Data directory. Works with Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n\r\n1.0 - Initial release.",
