  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds the (Soul) Reaver to Skyrim!\r\n\r\nYou may notice that I made a similar mod last April. Since then, I\\'ve attended several months of a Digital Art program and realized that my last Soul Reaver mod (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14985/) looks like a plastic toy more-so than an actual sword. I figured I could put in the effort and make a far less embarrassing model. Nonetheless I\\'ve decided to keep it up on the nexus since it\\'s a much lower poly sword. (2K instead of 5.7K polygons.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe Soul Reaver is available in both 1 Hand and 2 Hand versions, with 2 versions of each depending on which way you want the skull to face (towards yourself for the firstperson view, or away from yourself for the thirdperson crowd or people that like to stare at the back of a skull)\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nYou can install with the Nexus Mod Manager or just drop the contents of the .zip file into your Skyrim/Data folder and activating the SoulReaverSwordOnly.esp in your launcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO GET IT\r\n\r\nAlso different in this version is that I decided not to be lazy and make it possible to smith/refine the Reaver yourself. All you need to make any 4 of the Reaver iterations is:\r\n\r\nEbony Ingot\r\nQuicksilver Ingot\r\nHuman Skull\r\n\r\nAfter that, it just takes an Ebony ingot to refine the Reaver at a grinding stone.\r\n\r\nFor any lore-heavy fans of the Legacy of Kain series, I suppose you\\'re gonna have to imagine that the Dragonborn is born with the same smithing knowledge as Vorador.\r\n\r\n\r\nETC ETC\r\n\r\nI have about a week left before my program picks up again and my time to play video games drops to about 2 hours below 0. Until then I\\'ll be paying attention to the comments and doing my best to fix any bugs that people report.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG\r\n\r\n1.1 (Dec 31, 2012)\r\n- Made the 2H versions of the Soul Reaver 25% smaller. Looking less gargantuan now.",
