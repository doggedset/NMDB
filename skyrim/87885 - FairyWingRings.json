  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is a patch for Anton and Sunspot2&#39;s Animated Fairy Wings. Its based off my original work on [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/87884/?]DragonWingRings [/url]but adapted to work with the Fairy Wing mod instead. I know there is already a way to enchant a ring with the magic effect via console, but I wanted something a little more immersive and permanent. I created this patch which allows the player to make a ring with an enchantment version of Anton&#39;s fairy wings spell effect. The ring can be crafted at the Tanning Rack and the effect can be used simply by equipping/unequippng the ring. This also works on followers and the effect can be dis-enchanted and put on any other piece of armor/jewelry. Furthermore, if the wings ever disappear off of a follower, you can simple take and give back the object to get the wings to reappear.\r<br />\r<br />----Requirements----\r<br />Anton and Sunspot2&#39;s Animated Fairy Wings foundÂ [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62612/?]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />----Reccomendations----\r<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/85366/?]Alternate Colors for Animated Fairy Wings[/url] by halanich.\r<br />\r<br />----Installation----\r<br />Simply copy the FairyWingRings.esp to your Data directory and enable it in your favorite Mod Manager (I use WryeBash);\r<br />\r<br />----Load Order----\r<br />Make sure this mod is loaded AFTER Animated Fairy Wings.\r<br />\r<br />----Uninstall----\r<br />This *Should* uninstall cleanly by simply deleting the esp.

If that is not good enough please let me know immediately and I will remove the mod until more explicit permission is attained. I have uploaded a screenshot of the permissions tab to which I refer in the images section of this mod page.",
