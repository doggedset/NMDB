Stroti sent them to me some time ago and allowed me to add them to this package. \r<br />\r<br />===============================================================\r<br />\r<br />Notes:\r<br />======\r<br />\r<br />Important: \r<br />\r<br />If you want to use the washbarrel and the washboardbarrel in your mod, they MUST be added as activator and a water type MUST be selected, else the CK and the game will crash. I recommend to copy the horsetrough01 for this. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The dreamcatcher and the &#34;wind thingys&#34; are animated, the windchimes are not. Add all these as statics to your game (NOT as movable statics&#33;)\r<br />The Skoomapipe has clutter collision, add it as misc item to your game. \r<br />Chess, scales, market shelves and nestbox are statics, the weight for the scales is clutter. \r<br />Washing: the washbarrels, the mangle, the washboard and the flatiron-holder are statics, the scrubber, soap and flatiron have clutter collision.\r<br />Dice: The game-set is static, the dice-cup and single dice have clutter collision.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I had to retexture some objects, either because they used vanilla Oblivion textures or because the textures that were added by Stroti did not render quite well in Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />=================================================================\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Tools used:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Nifskope\r<br />NifUtils by Skyfox\r<br />Gimp\r<br />Blender\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />This is a modders resource.You may use the meshes and textures for your own mods as long as you give credit and you do not charge money for it.\r<br />\r<br />Do not upload to other sites.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Credits:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Stroti for his resources and for everything he has given to the TES community\r<br />The Niftools team for giving us Nifskope; special thanks to jonwd7 for his great new developments on this tool\r<br />Skyfox from the Niftools team for his great tool NifUtils\r<br />jbvw/rileymarks for a texture (scales)\r<br />CG Textures",
