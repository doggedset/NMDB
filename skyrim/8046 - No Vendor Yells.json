Now that the Creation Kit is available, I\\'ve done just that. With this mod, vendors will no longer yell or speak idly about their wares or services.\r\n\r\n\r\n========================================\r\nINSTALL\r\n========================================\r\nDownload No Vendor Yells.esp\r\n\r\nPlace the plugin file in your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\nEnable the plugin file with the mod manager of your choice, such as the Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall this mod, just disable the plugin file in the mod manager of your choice. You may also remove it from your Skyrim/Data directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n========================================\r\nTECHNICAL\r\n========================================\r\nThis plugin deletes the \\\"INFO\\\" dialogue groups related to these \\\"vendor yells\\\" from the idle topics of various dialogue quests. The quest forms themselves are untouched, so No Vendor Yells should only have any compatibility issues with another mod if that mod directly alters the dialogue that No Vendor Yells removed, in which case only the pieces of dialogue altered by both mods will conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n========================================\r\nVERSION HISTORY\r\n========================================\r\nv1.0\t8th February 2012\r\n\tInitial release\r\n\r\n========================================\r\nPERMISSIONS\r\n========================================\r\nThe changes made by this mod are so tiny and inconsequential that I really don\\'t mind what you do with it, but if you make it available after making changes please provide a link to my version of the file on the Nexus and make it clear that the file you\\'re offering isn\\'t all my work.\r\n\r\n\r\n========================================\r\nCREDITS\r\n========================================\r\nThanks to Bethesda Games Studios for Skyrim and the Creation Kit\r\nNo Vendor Yells was made by Mark Hanna, a.k.a Cipscis",
