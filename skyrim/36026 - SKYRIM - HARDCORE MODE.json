  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Firstly a big thank you to all the creators of the mods I used for this idea.[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[youtube]Cx-JUJtsgBg[/youtube]\r\nIntroduction and Set up video.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]Description[/u]\r\nThis is not a mod, rather a collection of mods and self imposed/player imposed rules. The idea is to create a truly hardcore/difficult experience in Skyrim.\r\n\r\n[u]Core Mods[/u] \r\nDownload and install the following mods, they are the core of Skyrim: Hardcore Mode\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19281/?]Requiem[/url] = This mod is a complete overhaul and increases the difficulty of Skyrim greatly via various changes to different aspects of the game.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10639//?]Imp\\'s more complex needs[/url] = This mod adds a complex hunger thirst and sleep system. (Another Needs system will suffice but I enjoy this one and the complexity of it)\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31269//?]Requiem and IMCN Compatibility Patch[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163//?]Frostfall[/url] = This mod adds cold weather survival gameplay elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]Self Imposed Rules/Difficulty[/u]\r\n\r\n[b]True Hardcore:[/b] You have 1 life and never get any extra lives, once you die you delete the character.\r\n\r\nVariable on the rule if you feel like a less daunting concept.\r\n>You start with 1/3/5 lives. \r\n>Including level 1 in the count, every 3/5/10 level ups you gain 1 life. \r\n\r\nAn example of the concept would be you start with 1 life, and at level 10 you gain an extra life and then another at level 20.\r\n\r\nThe numbers are not important, you can decide how many lives you start with and at what intervals of level ups you gain a life. When you have lost all your lives, you are dead and must delete the character.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]Suggested Mods[/u]\r\n\r\nThe following are just a few suggestions that complement S: HC Mode.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9557//?]Alternate Start [/url] = Various options for starting up a new character.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3222//?]Immersive Hud[/url] = Hides many of the HUD elements and only shows them when they are needed.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16311//?]SM Essential Player[/url] = If playing with more than one life then the \\'Hardcore\\' option in this mod sounds like it would be awesome, every time you die, you lose all of your gear.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Tweaks to Requiem.[/b] The following are a couple of tweaks I chose to use from the optional files\r\n\r\nVanilla sleeping - \r\nThe following console command returns the sleeping settings back to vanilla\r\n\r\nConsole Command: Set AA000XarrianVanillaSleepingControl to 1 (0 disables it again)\r\n\r\nI have a self imposed rule for this part, I can only sleep in towns/Inns or other safe settlements, no sleeping in dungeons,caves etc. There may be exceptions to the rule occasionally.\r\n\r\nNo Spider Poison Image Space Modifier - \r\nI used this because I found the image space modifier was not to my liking and over the top it made the game unplayable but that\\'s just my opinion.\r\n\r\nConsole Command: Set AA000XarrianPoisonISMControl to 1 (0 enables it again)\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\r\nIf anyone has any other ideas to make the game harder, whether it is self imposed rules or mods, let me know. Also if anyone does a Playthrough/Let\\'s play or just makes a video of S:HC Mode, I\\'d love to check it out.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nFatal\r\n\r\n",
