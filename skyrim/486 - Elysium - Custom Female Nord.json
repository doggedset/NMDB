  "descriptionHtml": "I love the female Nord face structure, but I hated how they looked so tall. I wanted a tinier looking character that would play a good thief, and I came up with this. \r\n\r\nI also recommend using the console command \\\"player.setscale .9\\\" (without quotes). This shrinks the height/size of the character down slightly. If she\\'s too short, go with \\\".95\\\". \r\n\r\nAlso, you can use the command \\\"showracemenu\\\" to bring up the character customization screen. Doing this will automatically remove any makeup/lipstick/warpaint as soon as you do it, so you\\'ll have to re-add those to your liking before you\\'re finished. \r\n\r\n***WARNING** When using showracemenu command, if you choose ANY other race besides what is it set at (nord) your stats will go haywire, either resetting back to 15 or changing to something random. Even SELECTING another race then switching back to the character\\'s nord race will cause this. DO NOT CHANGE THE RACE WHEN MODIFYING USING THIS METHOD. As long as you keep the race nord however, everything else goes. Have fun!\r\n\r\nplayer.setscale 1 is the normal size.\r\n\r\nCharacter is level 1 with just over an hour playtime, saved along the path leading to Riverwood.\r\n\r\nENDORSE IF YOU LIKE IT!\r\n\r\n",
