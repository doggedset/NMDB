  "descriptionHtml": "The Citadel is a large fortress just beyond High Hrothgar.  As such you will not be able to access it until gaining the Clear Skies shout.\r<br />\r<br />The Citadel consists of 4 floors with full crafting facilities lots of storage and displays as well as lots of living space for followers.  There is also a hidden vault that requires 3 hidden keys to find (No I am not going to tell you where they are).\r<br />\r<br />The Citadel requires all 3 dlc&#39;s (Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn).  Also if you don&#39;t have a mod that replaces the Markarth banner then you will Just have weird brown banner with Markarth written on it in dayglow lettering.  \r<br />\r<br />To add it just unzip and drop in your Skyrim data folder\r<br />\r<br />I hope you like it, be nice as this is my first mod.  Constructive criticism  is welcome.\r<br />\r<br />If somebody wants to build a quest around it send me a message and we&#39;ll talk.  Please don&#39;t do anything to this without checking with me first.",
