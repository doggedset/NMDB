My first mod.\r\n\r\nLocation : Near Talking stone camp ; north-east from Rorikburg.\r\n\r\nRequired mods : none.\r\n\r\nIssues :\r\n\r\nIf mannequins in the armory room are invisible, or if they have \\\"ghost duplicates\\\", activate them and give them an object like ring or amulet. If they move or show a strange pose, quit the place and come back.\r\n\r\nI was not able to manage navmeshes correctly, therefore your companions will not follow you into some parts of the house.\r\n\r\nPlease notice me if you have other bugs (invisible building etc), crashes... \r\n\r\nFeel free to use and change any parts of my mod. You have not to obtain my allowance.  \r\n\r\n",
