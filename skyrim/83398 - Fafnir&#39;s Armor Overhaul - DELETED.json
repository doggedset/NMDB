  "descriptionHtml": "Some fixes and changes because they made no sense.\r<br />\r<br />What&#39;s different:\r<br />\r<br />-Guard shields are now light armor (Because it matches the rest of the set)\r<br />\r<br />-Studded imperial armor is:Â \r<br />   Renamed &#34;Imperial Studded Armor&#34; so it&#39;s grouped with the rest of the sets\r<br />   The armor raiting has been fixed to make it a true medium armor (Light is 23, studded is 24, heavy is 25)\r<br />   Now temperable and craftable. It takes a light armor and a steel ingot (I personally think this is pretty lore friendly)\r<br />\r<br />-The Jester&#39;s outfit (not Cicero&#39;s) is now an armor instead of clothes. It&#39;s temperable and has stats equal to leather armor.\r<br />\r<br />",
