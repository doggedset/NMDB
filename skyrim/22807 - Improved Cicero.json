If you don\\'t like Cicero at all, please direct your cursor to your browser\\'s Back option, and apply pressure with your index finger to your mouse. Problem solved.\r\n\r\nThis Cicero is based off of my artwork, and sports [b]minor[/b] alterations:\r\n\r\nReduced cheekbones, width and height. He doesn\\'t need to be opening canned goods with his face, or slicing envelopes with the bottom ridge of his sockets. :)\r\nAmber colored eyes.\r\nReduced tinting in some lights.\r\n\r\nThere shouldn\\'t be any gray face bugs, since I used Wryebash to make it an ESM. And it shouldn\\'t conflict with any mods, because... it\\'s just tweaks in the CK of things already available. \r\n\r\nI am using a few extra things to make his face look a wee bit better in the screenshots, but they\\'re not included:\r\n\r\nSuperB ENB RL\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11318\r\n\r\nGeonox High Res Face maps for men (modified)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4141\r\n\r\nXCE - Character Enhancement (modified textures)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2356",
