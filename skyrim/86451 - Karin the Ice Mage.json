Savos Aren, however, seemed to know something about her, and despite objections from others in authority, agreed to allow her access to classes and the resources in the Arcanaeum.\r<br />\r<br />   Rumors had first begun to spread that she was possibly a spy sent by one of the mage guilds, possibly the College of Whispers or The Synod, but given her clumsy nature of knocking over books everywhere in the Arcanaeum and her insistence on only studying Frost spells (which most of Skyrim&#39;s creatures and bandits were resistant to), these rumors slowly subsided over time.\r<br />\r<br />   What the College residents didn&#39;t know, was that they were half right. She was sent, albeit indirectly, by a mage order far more powerful than both the Synod and the College of Whispers. Karin herself was unaware that she was being used by this order as a sleeper agent; and with the emergence of the Dragonborn, plans were about to be set in motion...\r<br />[/color][/i][/size][/font]\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/CkVJpcL.png[/img]\r<br />[center]\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/oKvD4tj.jpg[/img]\r<br />[color=#cfe2f3][size=4]6 Sept 2017: Karin made Hot Files&#33; Thanks for the support&#33;[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />maxiteo:[list]\r<br />[*][size=3]darrenstone PMed me to ask if I was interested in making his preset into a follower, and I was happy to do it =)[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]For all permissions and requests, I would prefer you to contact darrenstone directly, as Karin is his creation *fires arrow*[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]As the body textures are a customized blend of Adorable Face and PureSkinTexture (with permission from both authors) and created for UNP, a CBBE version is not possible at this point in time.
