  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod for skyrim and is a re-tex of the Blades Sword to give it a Snow Leopard look. I do plan to create a non-replacer version once I get my head around it, though may have to wait until the CK comes out as I don\\'t quite (yet) know how to do this using TESSnip.\r\n\r\nThe sword and scabbard is now re-textured in snow leopard print. The yelowish colour of the Blades Sword has been changed to white metal/steel look and I have brightened up the blade somewhat.\r\n\r\nPlease note that installing this mod will also change the Dragonbane sword to look like this also.\r\n\r\nTo install just drop the textures folder into your skyrim\\\\data folder.\r\n\r\nInspired from the Snow Leopard Forsworn Armour Redux by getcape\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1867\r\nand with permission from Rekicker to use his Leopard print texture from his Snow Leopard Forsworn - Non-Replacer Versions\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=886",
