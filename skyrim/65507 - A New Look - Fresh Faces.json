  "summary": "A small mod that changes the looks of many of the NPCs in Skyrim, just to make playing it for the thousandth time feel more &#34;New&#34;.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]A New Look - Fresh Faces\r<br />[/size][size=3]What does it do?\r<br />[/size]It simply changes the looks of the most common/most visited NPCs. So far I have focused on Whiterun, as the place every character will visit a fair bit.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Bugs?\r<br />[/size]All this mod changes is the looks and outfits, so there shouldn&#39;t be any bugs except for some NPCs looking a little ill, but this is rare and being fixed. If there is a NPC you don&#39;t like from this mod, tell me why in the comments and I&#39;ll try to change them or if there is a NPC you want changing in the base game, again, tell me and I&#39;ll see what I can do.",
