  "descriptionHtml": "Tired of Stormcloak Generals and Imperial Legates being essential after the Civil War?\r\nWell, no more!\r\n\r\nThis simple fix removes their essential status allowing them to be killed.\r\nGalmar and Rikke doesn\\'t count, as they\\'re required in quests. \r\n\r\nVersion 1.2 now up. \r\nI\\'m sorry to say that the game-breaking effect of Legate Quentin Cipius\\'s death forced me to make him Essential. His death will ruin the Imperial Legion questline, something I\\'ve gotten multiple reports on. \r\nIf there are anyone that really wants to kill him, use the console to remove his status. Open the console with the tilde button (to the very left, left of 1), and type \\\"setessential 000844D1 0\\\" without the quote marks. \r\nI\\'m sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, but I felt the need to update this. I also did this to update the mod to the current version of Skyrim, to make sure it runs optimally. \r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 is up! \r\nNow, killing the General/Legate will set the camp to cleared in the map.\r\nVersion 1.0 is still available, for making a way to fall back if something is wrong with 1.1.\r\n\r\nNote: Just to assure you all, none of these Generals or Legates are part of any quests in Vanilla Skyrim.\r\nIf a Dragon swoops by, your quests and gameplay will be perfectly safe. \r\nI can not guarantee how this will work if a DLC or another mod need these. (I really doubt they will be vital for a DLC, they always make brand new NPCs and the fact they they were essential is probably an oversight)\r\n\r\nIf anyone finds a General or Legate which is unkillable, just notify me in a comment and I\\'ll look to it. \r\n\r\nRussian version here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23294\r\n\r\nOn request from an user, here\\'s a link to the Workshop version of this file. \r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=7464",
