  "summary": "Scale Armor variant that you can craft and find on NPCs. Both genders supported. Weight slider compatible. Exists alongside the vanilla scaled armor. Two slightly differing designs and replacer options available.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The concept of scaled armor is utterly luvly and while the vanilla one looks very nice (used it with an orc character) I wanted a slightly less barbaric look for my Breton playthrough especially.\r<br />\r<br />Both genders and weight slider supported as usual.\r<br />\r<br />You can craft this Light Armor with or without chainmail. \r<br />\r<br />Basic version is designed for early gameplay and can be found in the Leather crafting section.\r<br />[b]The armor benefits from [color=#ff7700]Matching Set[/color] perks with gear that has the &#39;[color=#ff7700]Leather[/color]&#39; material keyword.\r<br />[/b]My Scaled Armor is 1 unit stronger than the vanilla Leather Cuirass, but weighs more and requires more materials.\r<br />This version is also better suited for sneaking because of the lesser weight compared to the chainmail version.\r<br />\r<br />Scale+Chainmail version can be found in the Steel crafting section (same as the vanilla Scaled Armor), and is visible in the crafting menu with the [b][color=#ff0000]Advanced Armors[/color][/b] perk.\r<br />[b]The armor benefits from [color=#ff7700]Matching Set[/color] perks with gear that has the &#39;[color=#ff7700]Scaled[/color]&#39; material keyword.\r<br />[/b]Chainmail version is 5 units stronger than the vanilla Scaled Cuirass but again weighs more and requires more materials. It is still 1 unit weaker compared to Glass Armor.\r<br />\r<br />Credit & thanks to Bethesda for Skyrim and its assets.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />---------------\r<br />Installation\r<br />---------------\r<br />Place the &#39;Meshes&#39; and &#39;Textures&#39; folders inside the game&#39;s DATA directory.\r<br />Also, if using a version with an .ESP file, place it inside the DATA folder and then enable the mod in the launcher or use a mod manager.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------\r<br />Techy info and excuses\r<br />----------------------------\r<br />The Leveled list version only edits the &#34;SublistScaledCuirassVariants&#34; form. By editing this single form the armor will appear on enemies like bandits and can be seen in stores occasionally alongside the vanilla scale armor.\r<br />As a reminder, scaled armor starts appearing on bandits at level 19.\r<br />\r<br />One reason for the texture being kinda stretchy, in addition to my amateur skills, is that it is standard res. I had already done most of the texture editing work before I got the HD texture pack to use a resource. Majority of progress on the mod was made in 2012. I only recently did the female mesh morph and other misc adjustments.\r<br />\r<br />It uses the male bandit armor mesh as a base which I then also adapted for the female body. Male meshes also included in the pack as a bit of vertex repositioning had to be done to eliminate some sharp cloth-like spots on the armor that the scales now occupy.\r<br />\r<br />The chain texture option is implemented as a texture set via the Creation Kit to eliminate the need for a second set of mesh files. Although a second set of female 1st person meshes had to be included because of a bug with the CK not accepting texture sets for the female 1st person meshes only. ",
