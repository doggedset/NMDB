  "descriptionHtml": "Balanced Skill Gains is available on the Steam Workshop: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=18269\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought that some of the skills in Skyrim levelled up too slowly, or too quickly? This simple mod attempts to balance skill gains and reduce grinding in all skills.\r\n\r\nThere isn\\'t much to say for a mod like this, so I\\'ve listed the exact changes to each skill below. \r\n\r\n\\\"SkillUseMult\\\" is a multiplier that determines how many times a skill must be used for that skill to increase. Higher SkillUseMult means faster skill gain.\r\n\r\n\\\"SkillImproveMult\\\" is a multiplier that determines how much more difficult increasing a skill becomes as that skill is levelled higher, also known as the \\\"experience curve.\\\" Higher SkillImproveMult means slower skill gain at higher levels.\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nAlteration \r\nSkillUseMult - Increased from 3 to 4.\r\n(33% faster skillgain)\r\n\r\nArchery:\r\nSkillUseMult - Increased from 9.3 to 11.\r\n(18% faster skillgain)\r\n\r\nAlchemy:\r\nSkillUseMult - Increased from 0.75 to 2.\r\n(166% faster skillgain)\r\n\r\nBlock:\r\nSkillUseMult - Increased from 8.1 to 9.1.\r\n(12% faster skillgain)\r\n\r\nConjuration:\r\nSkillUseMult - Increased from 2.1 to 2.4.\r\n(14% faster skillgain)\r\n\r\nDestruction:\r\nSkillUseMult - Decreased from 1.35 to 1.25.\r\n(8% slower skillgain)\r\n\r\nEnchanting:\r\nSkillUseMult - Decreased from 900 to 675.\r\nSkillIImproveMult - Decreased from 1 to 0.5.\r\n(25% slower skillgain, 50% less curve)\r\n\r\nHeavy Armor:\r\nSkillUseMult - Increased from 3.8 to 4.2.\r\n(10% faster skillgain)\r\n\r\nIllusion:\r\nSkillUseMult - Increased from 4.6 to 5.\r\n(9% faster skillgain)\r\n\r\nLight Armor:\r\nSkillUseMult - Increasd fron 4 to 4.6.\r\n(15% faster skillgain.
