  "descriptionHtml": "IMPORTANT&#33; PLEASE NOTE: THIS MOD DON&#39;T INCLUDE THE MUSIC OF MORROWIND OR OBLIVION ITSELF&#33;&#33;&#33; THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL&#33; YOU HAVE TO OWN THE MUSIC FROM OBLIVION OR MORROWIND FROM THE GAME&#39;S AND PUT IT TO YOUR SKYRIM FOLDER&#33; READ THE WHOLE DESCRIPTION TO FIND OUT HOW TO DO&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod ADDS the music of Morrowind and Oblivion to Skyrim (it don&#39;t replace any vanilla \r<br />music&#33;) The files are dynamically aranged: e.g. Oblivions Music most will be played in \r<br />forests and morrowind&#39;s music will be heared more in swamp&#39;s or at the coast&#39;s. In the \r<br />dungeons and cities you will hear only Oblivions music (Morrowind haven&#39;t any dungeon \r<br />music and the soundtrack of morrowind fit&#39;s in my opinion more to exploration). The battle music will only play at lower level enemies, the bosses of skyrim still will have the standart-skyrim-soundtrack&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Activate the .esp file in the Data-folder of skyrim (steamSteamAppscommonskyrimData) \r<br />or activate it in the Nexus mod manager).\r<br />But then the work isn&#39;t done&#33; You have to go to the music folders of Oblivion and Morrowind (Oblivion: Bethesda SoftworksOblivionDataMusic)  ;  (Morrowind: Bethesda SoftworksMorrowindData FilesMusic) and copy and paste them to your skyrim Music folder (SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimDataMusic). If the music folder don&#39;t exists simply create it.\r<br />Don&#39;t use the subfolders of the original games&#33; Only copy the files in them so that the skyrim Music folder will have no subfolders&#33;\r<br />Then you have to convert the original .mp3 music files to .wav - I prefer this program for that if you don&#39;t already know how to do that: http://format-factory.en.softonic.com/\r<br />It&#39;s very important that the music will have the same names as in the folders (e.g. &#34;atmosphere_09&#34; , &#34;Dungeon_01_v2&#34; , &#34;mx_explore_1&#34; , &#34;MW battle5&#34;), otherwise the .esp won&#39;t recognize the files&#33;\r<br />If you got the music from the offical soundtrack CD or, lets say, YouTube (you know what I mean ;) ), you can find a list how to rename the music tracks under this links:\r<br />\r<br />Morrowind: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Music\r<br />Oblivion: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Music\r<br />\r<br />The converted .wav files can get very large, one can get the size of 20-50 MB. Don&#39;t wonder, that&#39;s normal with .wav files&#33; \r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t own one of the games or don&#39;t want to hear one specific game soundtrack or song in the game, simply don&#39;t put it into the music folder, the mod will work nevertheless.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Check out my other mod: Unique Villages&#33; It gives an unique look to every village in Skyrim&#33; http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29365\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I hope I made a part of making your skyrim better&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />adidertulpendieb",
