  "descriptionHtml": "NOTE! First of all, this is NOT any executable file that will autofix your Skyrim, it´s just a damn easy way for YOU to fix it Yourself! (dunno and dont care if I\\'m not allowed to post this ^^ Just want to help!)\r\n\r\nNOTE! You will also have to be rockin it on Steam, if you´re not just register it with steam... How to do that? Well google fu***ng Magic my Friend.\r\n\r\nNOTE! I had this problem myself = I was mega pissed for 3 hours found a way to fix it BUT I am making this guide for ONE reason, cause it doesn\\'t seem to be any other decent guide out there (actually everyone says reinstall, DONT REINSTALL, wont fix sh*t, at least in most cases...)\r\n\r\n\r\nSKYRIM Y U NO START!?\r\n\r\nMost likely cause youcompletely over-modded your Skyrim and/or managed to delete binkw32 or any other wierd inportant \\\"not even activated file in Nexus Mod manager file\\\". Or there is just any other wierd problem that has to be solved.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Open your Steam Library.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Right click on Skyrim and choose \\\"Properties\\\", yes that one, at the bottom.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Choose \\\"Local Files\\\" then VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE...\r\n\r\nStep 4: Play another 100 hours! But Seriously tho, do your homework...\r\neuhm.. http://9gag.com/gag/2202042\r\n\r\nStep 5: (Optional) Fell free to donate a small donation if you found this helpful too hugo.mortsell@gmail.com on paypal ^^\r\n\r\nHave a good f****ing day!\r\n\r\n",
