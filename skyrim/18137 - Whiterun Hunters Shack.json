  "descriptionHtml": "Whiterun Hunter\\'s Shack\r\n\r\n=====================\r\n=====================\r\nSimply a player shack in the midst of the Whiterun hold, near the western watchtower. It is way to escape the crowded city and take in the wonderful scenery. \r\n\r\nIncludes:\r\nAll crafting areas (forge smelter enchaning table ect.)\r\nArchery targets  \r\nWeapon Racks\r\nMannequin\r\nSmall Garden\r\nAnd the wonderful scenery!\r\n\r\nNothing special really, just a way for me to get firmilliar with the Skyrim Nexus. The shack is an interior (which was probably bad judgement on my part). Just dont look between the ceiling shingles. \r\n\r\n=====================\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nIf you like the file endorse ect ect ect. An endorsement would make my day. \r\n\r\nBe nice people, first mod on skyrim nexus <Remember when criticizing",
