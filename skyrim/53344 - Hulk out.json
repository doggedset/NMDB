  "summary": "Greater Power allowing the player to transform. To a large Orc, [b]not[/b] a comic book character.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A Power that lets the character transform into a giant Orc once per day for 150 seconds. You do [b]not[/b] become a comic-book character who is also large and green, so your added capabilities are appropriate to an Orc, not to &#34;The Incredible Hulk&#34; or &#34;She-Hulk&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />In Hulk form, the player&#39;s Magicka is set to zero, and those points split equally between Health and Stamina. Two-handed is fortified, and the Hulk form gets &#34;mage armor&#34; equivalent to the player&#39;s Alteration level, including any mage armor perks. Scale is set to 1.2. It is not clear if this is a multiplier for the original size, or an absolute value. Extra size confers extra speed.\r<br />\r<br />Any equipment the player is wearing/wielding is unequipped, and a set of Hulk clothing is added (if the player doesn&#39;t already have it.) The body &#34;armor&#34; includes the extra muscles, which is why you can&#39;t replace it. Spells and shouts are also &#34;un-readied&#34;. Since Maximum Magicka has been reduced to zero, you can&#39;t cast any spells anyway. Drinking magicka potions also is futile, as they only restore up to the current cap. You&#39;d better have a weapon (preferably two-handed) in your inventory before casting the power&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Although the Hulk outfit is actually light armor, the magical armor effects ignore this, and the mage armor perk still applies.\r<br />\r<br />After the power expires, the original scale is reset, and Magicka restored. Health and Stamina are reduced, but the Health loses only its maximum value. Current health only drops if exceeds the restored maximum. The player remains dressed in the hulk outfit, but the body part is now a different one with the original wimpier body. The Mage Armor perk is now negated by the Light Armor, so change clothing before using the xxxflesh spells&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The Power is acquired from the &#34;Old Orc&#34; who will have a spell tome as a death item.",
