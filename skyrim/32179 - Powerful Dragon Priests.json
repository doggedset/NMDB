  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=6pt][b]Powerful Dragon Priests[/b][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=6pt]Description[/size]\r\n[size=3pt]This mod increases the health, magicka and speed of Dragon Priests to make them more challenging. Six out of the eight Dragon Priests also received a staff upgrade with the exception of Morokei and Nahkriin, who I gave a higher level. The reason for this is that their staffs are quest related and I did not want anything to conflict with them or other mods that alter them.\r\n\r\nThe staffs that have been altered are:[/size]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Staff of Krosis - now has a shout-like spell that does 70 damage and staggers. Similar to the first word of Unrelenting Force (Fus), though it takes 3 seconds to cast. This was to avoid stagger-locking.\r\n[*]Staff of Hevnoraak - Deals 50 points of magickal damage and inflicts enemies with fear in a 25 ft. radius.\r\n[*]Staff of Rahgot - Wall of Fire that does 15 points of fire damage and absorbs 15 points of Health per second.\r\n[*]Staff of Volsung - Wall of Frost that deals 15 points of shock damage per second and absorbs 15 points of Magicka per second.\r\n[*]Staff of Vokun - Casts the Fireball of a dragon that deals 70 points fire damage and explodes in a 15ft radius.\r\n[*]Staff of Otar - Casts the Ice Ball of a dragon that deals 70 points frost damage in a 15ft radius.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=6pt]Installation & Requirements[/size]\r\n[size=3pt]To install, simply drop the .esp in the Data folder (/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/Data/).\r\nThis mod requires the latest version of Skyrim.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=6pt]Updates[/size]\r\n[size=3pt]February 23, 2013:\r\n1.1 release. Changes with Hevnoraak\\'s staff. Removed all Priest\\'s wards and gave them a constant 20% Spell Absorption ability. Fixed a minor conflict with Staves of Skyrim ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22691 ) where Hevnoraak\\'s staff would get overwritten. \r\nReleased an Optional file without increased to Health on the Priests.\r\n\r\nFebruary 22, 2013:\r\n1.0 Initial release.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=6pt]Plans[/size]\r\n[size=3pt]I\\'m planning on making a plugin for the new Priests introduced in Dragonborn.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=6pt]Troubleshooting[/size]\r\n[size=3pt]Please comment or PM me any bug reports, suggestions or questions you have![/size]",
