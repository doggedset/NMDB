I haven&#39;t used the CK in a long time so I made her as a test to see how much I could remember.  Then I decided to refine her abilities and release her to whoever wants to use her&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Meet Naraya, a Khajiit that was based on one of my Elder Scrolls Online characters.  I created her during the Beta sessions, but since I have no intention of actually playing the MMO, I thought I would make her in Skyrim instead so I could still have her around.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]She was Templar class in TESO, so I tried to mimic that with her traits and perks:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][size=2]She is a Spellsword class\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]When you first meet her, she is equipped with Steel Plate armour and uses a Silver 1h sword (although you can equip her with whatever you wish)\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]She does not condone evil acts (sorry Daedra worshippers&#33;) so she won&#39;t tolerate you attacking civilians and stealing, etc\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]She is pretty much vanilla in her appearance, except with tweaks that will affect her in your game such as skin textures and body meshes.\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]She levels with you\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]She is marriageable[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]She will not affect your stealth meter[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]She will not activate traps[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b][size=3][u]Voice:[/u]\r<br />[/size][/b][size=2]For vanilla purposes, she has the voice of a Female Dark Elf because there is no female Khajiit dialogue to allow her to be a follower.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]UPDATE: As of V2, there is now a file that has a more suitable Khajiit voice for people who want it, remember to use MFVM though, otherwise she won&#39;t work&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Spells\r<br />[/u][/b][/size][size=2]Note: Because Naraya is designed to level with the player, her spells reflect this.  If you meet her at a low level, then she will know basic spells, however if you meet her later on then she will be stronger.  She has been given the levelling perks in certain schools of magic, which will unlock her potential over time and allow her to use higher level spells.[/size]\r<br />[size=2]Originating as a Templar, Naraya uses a lot of support magic, such as healing and wards.  I also tried to add Skyrim&#39;s version of &#34;holy magic&#34; which involves the DLC spells to weaken Vampires and Daedra.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]The full list is as follows (obviously higher levelled spells will not be present depending on player&#39;s level):[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][size=2]Flames[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Frostbite[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Banish Daedra[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Expel Daedra[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Fast Healing[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Healing[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Healing Hands[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Ironflesh[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Oakflesh[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Stoneflesh[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Ward Lesser[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Ward Steadfast[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Close Wounds[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Greater Ward[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Heal Other[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Grand Healing[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Bane of the Undead[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Guardian Circle[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b][size=3][u]DLC Spells (May require Dawnguard):[/u]\r<br />[/size][/b][list][*][size=2]Stendarr&#39;s Aura\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Sun Fire\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Vampire&#39;s Bane[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b][size=3][u]Perks:[/u]\r<br />[/size][/b][size=2]Lightfoot[/size]\r<br />[size=2]Destruction Novice[/size]\r<br />[size=2]Restoration Novice - Master[/size]\r<br />[size=2]Conjuration Novice - Expert[/size]\r<br />[size=2]Alteration Novice - Adept[/size]\r<br />[size=2]Armsman[/size]\r<br />[size=2]Fighting Stance[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]I tested her as a vanilla follower and she seems fine, I am not sure about follower mods like AFT, EFF or UFO.  I use EFF personally and haven&#39;t encountered any problems so far, she seems to work fine with group commands and multiple followers.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]She may not tolerate crimes, but she does tolerate factions.  I thought that would be easier instead of having her instantly become hostile to a werewolf or vampire follower, so she shouldn&#39;t attack them.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Mini-Troubleshoot[/u]\r<br />[/b][/size][size=2]If she disappears (a common bug with custom followers) then follow these steps:[/size]\r<br />[size=2]1. Open up the Console by pressing the tilde key (~) [/size]\r<br />[size=2]2. Enter the following: 26005ab5.moveto player[/size]\r<br />[size=2]3. Press enter. Close the Console.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b]DO NOT[/b][size=2] type in placeatme as it will spawn a new copy of her instead of moving her to your location.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]If you encounter any problems, please let me know in the comments and I will try my best to try and fix it.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Credits[/u][/b]\r<br />[/size][size=2]Bethesda[/size]\r<br />[size=2]mysticentity for the MFVM mod[/size]\r<br />[size=2]The many people who make Follower tutorials, without them I would have no idea what to do&#33;[/size]\r<br />[size=2]NanaBeats for the NuHairstyles mod[/size]",
