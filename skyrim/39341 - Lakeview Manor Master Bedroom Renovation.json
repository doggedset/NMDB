  "modName": "Lakeview Manor Master Bedroom Renovation",
  "summary": "This changes the west wing bedroom addition of Lakeview Manor to a master bedroom suite.",
  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />This mod removes the additional beds, and basically everything else, from the original bedroom.  The only bed is a double bed for the dragonborn & his/her spouse.  There is a small table, a fireplace, and a bathing area.  I used the Dwemer trough as a &#39;bathtub.&#39;  Other than jumping up & down in it there isn&#39;t any type of interaction (your spouse may sit on the side of the tub though).  \r<br />\r<br />I tried to make the lighting as natural as possible.  The only light sources are the candles, chandelier and fireplace.  The screenshots show the lighting WITHOUT interior lighting mods and WITH interior lighting mods (RLO).  \r<br />\r<br />This mod was cleaned with TES5Edit 3.0.30\r<br />________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY:\r<br />Since this ONLY alters the west wing, there shouldn&#39;t be any issues with other mods unless they alter the west wing of Lakeview Manor.  \r<br />\r<br />I use this in conjunction with: \r<br />Shezries Hearthfire Kitchens (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26016/?)\r<br />Armory redone by jecoil (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36427/?)\r<br />Lakeview with Main Hall Library by jecoil (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36191//?)\r<br />\r<br />_________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />0)  Install the mod using NMM or manually (put the .esp in the data folder).  DO NOT ACTIVATE IT\r<br />1)  BUILD THE BEDROOM on the west wing of Lakeview.  Do NOT furnish it in any way.  \r<br />2)  Remove the workbench (you can build the EXTERIOR furnishings if you want them).  \r<br />3)  Exit game & activate the mod.  \r<br />4)  Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />______________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS:\r<br />\r<br />- This does require a legitimate copy of the game as &#34;Update.esm&#34; is a master file AND \r<br />- Update to the latest patch if you have any issues with the walls, floors and ceiling disappearing after you BUILT THE BEDROOM WING  :)\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t know how it will work if you&#39;ve already furnished the bedroom so you&#39;ll just have to give it a shot.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALL:\r<br />\r<br />Remove the .esp from you data folder or use NMM  :)\r<br />\r<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />OTHER STUFF:\r<br />\r<br />Please don&#39;t upload this elsewhere.  Past that, if you want to use this in your mod (as a Lakeview Manor bundle or whatever), feel free.  Just give credit  :)  \r<br />\r<br />This is the first Skyrim mod I&#39;ve uploaded so there may be a few bugs (hopefully not&#33;).  I&#39;ve made several but thought others might like to have this one\r<br />\r<br />_____________\r<br />\r<br />The original description of this mod gave nod to a mod that *inspired* this one.  I was a BROKEN Lakeview manor mod and was the impetus that caused me \r<br /> To be EXTRA CLEAR:  NO PART of anyone else&#39;s mod was used in the creation of this one.  I had to start from scratch since the only other Lakeview Manor mod (at the time) was done incorrectly.  I have removed all reference to that mod&#39;s author as she is not claiming that I&#39;m using &#34;her&#34; mod which I am NOT.  ",
