  "descriptionHtml": "[b]AL&#39;S [i]-GET 80 PERK POINTS AND ALL SKILLS 100-[/i] CHEAT RING[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod does exactly what it says on the tin.\r<br />\r<br />When the Jewel of Julianos ring is equipped, you will jump to level 81, gain 80 perk points to spend as you choose, and max out all your skills. It will then disappear.\r<br />\r<br />The next time you enter your skills menu, you will be prompted to choose magicka, health, or stamina to level up, just as if you were levelling up normally. This will happen *80* times in a row.\r<br />\r<br />[i][b]Caveats:[/b][/i]\r<br />\r<br />1. This is if you are at level 1. If you are higher than level one, you will gain fewer perk points. The amount of perk points you receive is based on your current level.\r<br />          81 - [Your level] = # of new perk points to spend\r<br />You will still have your skills maxed out and jump to level 81.\r<br />\r<br />2. If  you are using an uncapper (to raise your skill level cap past 100), then 100 points will be *added* to each skill on top of what you already have, up to your modded skill cap. Thus you may receive more or less perk points, and there&#39;s no telling what your character level will be.\r<br />\r<br />3. The mod is scripted to automatically add the Jewel of Julianos to your inventory as soon as you load up a saved game (or start a new game) with the mod enabled. If for some reason that doesn&#39;t work, you can give yourself the ring via console commands. Press the tilde key ( ~ ) to bring up the console; this key is typically on the far left of the row of number keys near the top of the keyboard. Then type\r<br />\r<br />help &#34;Jewel of Julianos&#34; 0\r<br />\r<br />and press Enter. A string of numbers and letters should come up next to the name &#39;Jewel of Julianos&#39;. This is the FormID. Now type\r<br />\r<br />player.additem [whatever that string of numbers and letters is] 1\r<br />\r<br />and press Enter again. Press tilde ( ~ ) to exit the console. You should now have the Jewel of Julianos ring in your inventory. Equip it and go&#33;\r<br />\r<br />(If you need a little help, check out the image.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]OTHER MODS BY ME[/u]:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Al&#39;s Completionist Series:\r<br />    1.
