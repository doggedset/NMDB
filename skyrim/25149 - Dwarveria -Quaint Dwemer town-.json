  "modId": 25149.0,
  "modName": "Dwarveria -Quaint Dwemer town-",
  "summary": "A medium sized settlement which includes almost everything the Dovahkiin needs, 8-10 Npcs, 3 which are followers. All based on Dwemer architecture.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was playing Skyrim one day and thought, hey, why not have a Dwemer city, which has been lost for centuries, ruined and covered in moss, but thriving with city life? So i did exactly that. Each Npc is invincible, and are all over the level of 50. You\\'ll find that the doors are not linked to anything, so i DO give permission for you to tweak it and make it better. as long as you can take screenshots for me to see what you\\'ve done to change it. There are 3 followers, and this mod doesn\\'t require any other mods, although, if you do have the \\\"forrested skyrim\\\" mod, you may want to turn it off, or make sure that they do not clash. i\\'m not the best at making mods, but i tried my best and would like some honest feedback. Thanks, and ENJOY! \r\n\r\nAs requested by a few of you, i\\'ll put a little more detail, and i will be putting in a version where it is not already marked on your map. :)",
