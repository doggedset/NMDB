  "descriptionHtml": "This small mod changes the Soul Siphon perk in the Enchanting tree to work on any enemies and not just what the game classifies as \\'animals\\'.\r\n\r\nFurthermore it has been expanded to three ranks.\r\n\r\nRank 1 - trap 5% of the victim\\'s soul\r\nRank 2 - trap 10% of the victim\\'s soul\r\nRank 3 - trap 20% of the victim\\'s soul\r\n\r\nI know there are already a few mods that do something similar but nothing on nexus really fit what I wanted so I made this for my own game. Might be of use to someone out there so here it is.\r\n\r\nRank 3 at 20% may look a bit high but on master difficulty where you can be chopping away for a while at something it ain\\'t too bad and you can always just stay at rank 1 anyway if you think it\\'s overpowered.\r\n\r\n",
