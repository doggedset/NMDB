  "modName": "Witcher 2 Intro music",
  "summary": "Replaces the Skyrim main menu music with that of the intro of Witcher 2",
  "descriptionHtml": "I thought the intro music to the Witcher2 was incredible - a powerful vocal, with a real fantasy feel - and wanted it in Skyrim. I use it with Brumbek\\'s spinning logo animation, which is cool.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7801 \r\n\r\nNOTE ** - to all who downloaded the file I uploaded previously - i\\'m sorry about that! \r\nI zipped up the original wav instead of the converted xwm. I was tired, with a few beers in me. What can I say??\r\n\r\nAnyway this is the CORRECT file. \r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n1. In your Skyrim/Data folder, make a new folder \\\"Music.\\\" \r\n2. inside music, another new folder \\\"special.\\\"\r\n3. Extract the contents of this zip, then cut/paste \\'mus_maintheme.xwm\\' into the \\\"special\\\" folder.\r\n4. Turn speakers up loud and enjoy!\r\n\r\nTo uninstall:\r\ndelete mus_maintheme.xwm\r\n\r\nI have no way to test this on anyone else\\'s setup - but I can\\'t really foresee any problems. If you have a mod that affects menu music in some way you might have some grief - but you\\'re on your own there. \r\n\r\ncredits:\r\nNone to me, the conversion took 5 seconds.\r\n- the band, who can be found at \r\nhttp://www.zywiolak.pl/en/\r\n- vikichan as I used MultiXwm to convert\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3159\r\nBethesda for another righteous game.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n",
