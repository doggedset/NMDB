  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://img849.imageshack.us/img849/4135/freyatitleb.png[/img]\r\n\r\n  Since I started playing Skyrim, I\\'ve been searching for armor for a female character that made sense, defensively and structurally, looked decent, and actually looked kind of feminine. I\\'m too tired of all the skimpy armor, battle bikinis (or even less!) that you\\'d freeze to death in, if you weren\\'t stabbed in one of your many unprotected vital areas first. Hopefully, with this mod I have achieved that.\r\n\r\nIf you use and enjoy the armor, or want to see more, please comment or endorse! I love hearing feedback on what you like or what I can improve.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------o-0-O-0-o----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n  Introducing Freya\\'s Raiment, a new armored battle dress to meet the needs of discerning female characters. \r\nFreya is the Norse goddess of beauty, war and death, so I found it only fitting to name the armor after her. \r\n\r\nThis mod adds a new, standalone armor to the game. \r\nIt\\'s a set of female light armor, Which can be crafted at any forge. (Ebony perk required.)\r\nFully upgradable and enchantable, it requires ebony and silver ingots to create.\r\nCurrently there is only the body armor, gauntlets and boots. No helmet.\r\n\r\nYou can also find it using the console commands for \\\"Freya\\\"\r\nStat-wise, the set is fairly close to the Dragon sets. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you prefer, you can find and download this from the Steam Workshop, here:\r\n\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=138394532]Freya\\'s Raiment on the Skyrim Steam Workshop[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------o-0-O-0-o----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis armor is currently a work in progress, and I will be updating it when I find the time to make improvements. \r\nSteam Workshop files will most likely be updated with improved versions, but expect to find all updates and alternate versions on the Nexus.\r\n\r\nPlanned updates:\r\n -Improved and higher resolution textures\r\n -Make adjustments to normal and specular maps.\r\n -Add a heavy armor version\r\n -Create color variants\r\n -Design a helm/circlet?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal credit to A TYPE2, for his Oblivion mod mesh which I\\'ve altered and fixed.\r\nThank you!",
