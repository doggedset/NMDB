  "modName": "Skeleton Key - Nightingale Potential Unlocked",
  "summary": "Never wanted to be an \\\"honorable\\\" Nightingale? Wanted to unlock your potential like Mercer, only to find that the Skeleton Key doesn\\'t work like that? Well, look no further.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Mercer may have been a dick and left you to die, but his ideas weren\\'t stupid.\r\n\r\nI can\\'t be the only one who saw Mercer use all of the Nightingale abilities without limitations and wanted to be able to use them myself. I wanted to betray the Nightingales for my own gain just like Mercer. But what happens when you get the Skeleton Key? Nothing. You need to return it to the Ebonmere because of all of this talk of \\\"thieves with honor.\\\" \r\n\r\nAnd that\\'s what this mod is for. With a simple tweak in the CK to the SkeletonKey perk, I\\'ve made it so that when the Skeleton Key is obtained during the correct quest (Not simply by using Console Commands), you gain all three Nightingale powers.\r\n\r\nDescription of this mod changes:\r\nFebruary 17, 2012: I finally decided it was time for me to remove a misleading part of this description. No, no changes to the file. I doubt it will ever really need to be changed.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nSeptember 11, 2012: I was being stupid and added the effect of Shadowcloak rather than the power. Version 2 should have all three powers now.\r\n",
