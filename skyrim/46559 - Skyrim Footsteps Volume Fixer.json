  "descriptionHtml": "SKYRIM - Footsteps Volume Fixer\r\n\r\nThis increases the volume of footsteps from the player's perspective. Sneaking sounds are also altered slightly. This mod does not affect the NPCs footsteps.\r\n\r\nI know, there is already a mod like this but I wasn't completely satisfied with it, since (as far as I could tell) it didn't affect all footsteps. My mod does. Even the volume of sneaking sounds are increased a bit, so now you can hear every single footsteps you make. :)\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you don't want to alter your sneaking footstep sounds, simply delete the corresponding directories from my mod.\r\n\r\nHave fun!",
