  "descriptionHtml": "You can consider this an alpha version. I\\'m just posting it to 1) get initial feedback, and 2) finally get something up on the Nexus. :) \r\n\r\nThe hat has a three fold enchantment: it fortifies alchemy, destruction, and (of course) enchanting. \r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n1) Currently male only.\r\n2) There is no weight slider support. Not sure why you would need it since its just a hat, but the underlying beggar hat asset has a _0 version and a _1 version, so IDK. We\\'ll see. I may switch it out and use a different hat, the one without any holes in it.\r\n3) No support for Argonians or Khajiit yet. You might not ever see this actually. I don\\'t think it would look right.\r\n4) The ground model is the college hood. I\\'ll be fixing that once I\\'m 100% happy with the basic biped models\r\n5) Can only be obtained through the console. Type help \\\"enchanter\\'s hat\\\" to find the ID.\r\n\r\nFuture plans: I\\'m working on making Tim, an NPC follower/enchanting trainer, but before I release him, I\\'ve got to make a custom beard, custom robes and necklaces, and write an appropriate quest and AI package.
