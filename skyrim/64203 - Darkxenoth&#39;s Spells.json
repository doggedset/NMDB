  "descriptionHtml": "This will be where I upload any Spells I end up making, though at present I&#39;ve only made two spell mods, both of which are quite small and simplistic - being only 1 spell in one, and 3 spells in the other. I make mods for personal use, so these likely won&#39;t be for everyone because everyone wants something different when it comes to playing Skyrim. I&#39;m only uploading them so that others who might want something similar but not know how/want to make them themselves will have access to them. So without further ado, the descriptions and such for the offered spells can be found below.\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll likely need to use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1840/?]Wrye Bash[/url] if you use any other mod that adds to/edits level lists.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r<br />|                                                       Darkxenoth&#39;s Arcane Intellect                                                             |\r<br />|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r<br />---------------|\r<br />Description|\r<br />---------------\r<br />Do you get tired of having little to no mana regen during combat when playing a caster? Well, so did I&#33;That&#39;s\r<br />why I made this little mod. I&#39;ve created a spell, called Arcane Intellect, that does the following:\r<br />Fortify Magicka 100 pts. for 30 mins. Restore 15 Magicka per second for the duration.\r<br />I have made a spell book to learn the spell, which I&#39;ve added to the level lists so that you should be able to\r<br />find it while wandering (I think...) or you should be able to buy it from Farengar right away, which is how\r<br />I tested it. I also made a scroll version of the spell for those who might want to use it, but not have it\r<br />available all the time in their spellbook; you should occasionally run across the scroll either from vendors or\r<br />as loot. If you can&#39;t be bothered to get the spell tome or scroll(s), feel free touse the console with\r<br />&#34;help &#34;Arcane Intellect&#34; 0&#34; to find it. I openly admit that this can be considered a bit of a cheat, because\r<br />the 15 pts/sec Magicka regen continues not only during combat, but also while you have a spell charged\r<br />in-hand.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you find the mana regen to be too low for your tastes, or otherwise want to change something about this\r<br />mod then feel free to open up DarkxArcaneIntellect.esp in the Creation Kit and search for Darkx in the Object\r<br />Window. \r<br />If you want to upload a modified version, or otherwise use this in a mod of your own go for it - just give me\r<br />a bit of credit when you publish it.I built this mod using the Creation Kit, so I&#39;d like to give some love to Bethesda\r<br />for not only this excellent game but also for the tool(s) to modify it.\r<br />----------------\r<br />|Installation|\r<br />-------------------\r<br />|Requirements|\r<br />-------------------\r<br />Up-to-Date Skyrim\r<br />-------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Installation should be a fairly painless task, whether you prefer to install using a Mod Manager utility such\r<br />as Nexus Mod Manager or if you manually install.

Do\r<br />you dislike having to carry bunches of healing potions, or needing to cast healing spells repeatedly? Well\r<br />that&#39;s what led me to make this mod. I&#39;ve created a new spell, or 3 technically, called Rejuvenation that\r<br />will heal you over time (similar to healing potions with popular overhauls such as SkyRe or PerMa) without\r<br />the constant drain on magicka that one usually has with vanilla heal-over-time (concentration) spells. This\r<br />spell, as mentioned previously, comes in three forms: Minor Rejuvenation, Rejuvenation, and Grand\r<br />Rejuvenation. Each is there own separate spell, and has their own spell tome, so you could, and likely will,\r<br />end up with all three of them in your spellbook at once after awhile. Minor Rejuvenation is the weakest,\r<br />cheapest, and earliest form of this spell that you&#39;ll find (should be available immediately from Farengar),\r<br />while Rejuvenation is slightly better, and Grand Rejuvenation being the best of the bunch. I&#39;ve added each to\r<br />the appropriate leveled list (as far as I know) so you should be able to find them at the appropriate levels.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you find the health regen to be too low for your tastes, or otherwise want to change something about this\r<br />mod then feel free to open up DarkxHealsOverTime.esp in the Creation Kit and search for Darkx in the Object\r<br />Window.\r<br />If you want to upload a modified version, or otherwise use this in a mod of your own go for it - just give me\r<br />a bit of credit when you publish it.\r<br />\r<br />I built this mod using the Creation Kit, so I&#39;d like to give some love to Bethesda\r<br />for not only this excellent game but also for the tool(s) to modify it.\r<br />----------------\r<br />|Installation|\r<br />-------------------\r<br />|Requirements|\r<br />-------------------\r<br />Up-to-Date Skyrim\r<br />-------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Installation should be a fairly painless task, whether you prefer to install using a Mod Manager utility such\r<br />as Nexus Mod Manager or if you manually install.

This Feedback spell causes the target it hits to\r<br />take damage when they cast spells, with a 10 second duration. It is not affected by dual-casting or perks.\r<br />The damage done each time affected targets cast a spell is equal to the amount of magicka they&#39;ve used since\r<br />the effect was applied to them. This should ensure any caster affected by this will quickly kill themselves\r<br />if they continue to cast. It should be noted that this will likely also increase the damage of lightning\r<br />spells/enchantments (or anything else that damages magicka really) used against those affected as well since\r<br />lightning damage causes both health and magicka damage.\r<br />I have added the spell tome for the spell to a couple leveled lists that should allow it to either be bought\r<br />from merchants that use these lists, or found as loot out in the world. Farengar should have a copy\r<br />available for purchase, if I&#39;m not mistaken.\r<br />\r<br />It might be good to keep in mind that the spells in this mod (technically there are two, though only one of\r<br />them is readily accessible and meant to be used; if you&#39;re really curious, use the console to search for\r<br />&#39;mana burn&#39;) are scripted spells, which means they fire a script when cast, and it is the scripts fired by\r<br />the spells that actually do anything. The scripts are extremely light-weight (15 lines max), and shouldn&#39;t\r<br />cause any unforeseen troubles.\r<br />I have also included a &#39;Source Txt Files&#39; folder in the download, for those who are curious or intend to\r<br />modify the mod/spell in any way. It just contains a copy of my scripts&#39; source code in .txt format, as well\r<br />as a .txt copy of this ReadMe.\r<br />Oh... and the spell is under the Illusion school of magic, if you were wondering. No real reason why, I just\r<br />randomly decided to put it under Illusion. Feel free to edit the magic effects in the CK (or whatever\r<br />editing tool you&#39;re comfortable with and can do it) to change which school of magic it belongs to; though if\r<br />you do, you might want to remember to change the spell tome as well since it uses the illusion spell tome\r<br />assets. To find anything added by me in the CK filter/search &#39;Darkx&#39; - I use that as a prefix for all my IDs.\r<br />I just wanted to be upfront and all that jazz.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to upload a modified version, or otherwise use this in a mod of your own go for it - just give me\r<br />a bit of credit when you publish it.\r<br />\r<br />I built this mod completely from scratch using the Creation Kit, so I&#39;d like to give some love to Bethesda\r<br />for not only this excellent game but also for the tool(s) to modify it.\r<br />--------------\r<br />|Installation|\r<br />--------------\r<br />|Requirements|\r<br />--------------\r<br />Up-to-Date Skyrim\r<br />-------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Installation should be a fairly painless task, whether you prefer to install using a Mod Manager utility such\r<br />as Nexus Mod Manager or if you manually install.
