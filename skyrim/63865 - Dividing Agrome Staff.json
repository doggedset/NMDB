  "descriptionHtml": "[b][i][u]~FOR WHATEVER REASON, I CANNOT TAKE PICS OF IT INGAME, SORRY~[/u][/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />But anyways, the Dividing Agrome is an OP staff I decided to make, or.. OP in a lot of cases, but not in all. It is just a simple staff that fires a hyper lethal ray of the sun&#39;s infernic rays.\r<br />\r<br />--------&gt; Basically it fires a small, precise, ray of doom. It does a lotta damage, catches the enemy on fire, and blows them back like a shield bash or an unrelenting burst.Â \r<br />\r<br />   To make it somewhat lore friendly I placed it deeeeep in Bleak Falls Barrow, on a deceased dragon priest. You either have to fight your way to it, or get it via console commands. It does not use ANY energy or magicka and goes beautifully with an enchanted shield, or a defensive spell, since it can be used in one hand.\r<br />\r<br />Just install it like any simple mod. -&gt; Extract -&gt; Put in Data folder -&gt; Activate.",
