  "descriptionHtml": "=============================\r\nNo Health Regen by StannieDum\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nIf you disliked Bethesda\\'s decision to go the way of all modern\r\nshooters and include automatic health regeneration in the game, \r\nthis mod is probably for you. It\\'s ideal if you prefered the old \r\n\\'Oblivion\\' style of play where you had to actively heal yourself, \r\nrather than the game automatically doing it for you.\r\n\r\nIt is a very simple modification that completely removes the\r\nautomatic health regeneration from all the game\\'s playable races. \r\n\r\nSpells, potions and foods that restore health are unaffected and\r\nwill continue to work as normal.\r\n\r\nTo install, simply place the plug-in in the game\\'s Data folder and\r\nensure that it is activated in the launcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nStannieDum\r\n16 February 2012\r\n",
