  "descriptionHtml": "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI\\'ve already noticed a mod on here by MonochromeWench that adds craftable circlets to the game, under the jewelry section. In my mod, I have not only added the forging aspect, but I have also adjusted the prices to a more realistic number (Emerald is worth 600 gold, but a Gold and Emerald circlet is only worth 500). It makes crafting these circlets a bit more rewarding. \r\n\r\nAnother thing I added was the ability to go to the armor improvement bench, to improve your circlets to make them more valuable. Other than increasing value, they do not improve anything. I hope to improve on this idea in the future. So, if you\\'re willing to put a bit more into your newly created circlet, you shall be rewarded more money when selling it!\r\n\r\nSo, this is my first mod, please tell me what you think guys!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALL;\r\n\r\nIn order to install this mod, just drag the .esp file into your /Data folder in the main Skyrim directory. Then go to Data Files in the Skyrim Launcher and double click the file. ",
