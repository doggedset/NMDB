  "summary": "Unlocks Brynjolf\\'s real dialogue tree after the Thieves Guild questline.  No more being too busy to talk to the Guild Master.",
  "descriptionHtml": "--=xx=--\r\n\r\nA small mod that prevents Brynjolf\\'s irritating \\\"I\\'ve got important things to do/I\\'m busy\\\" dialogue from blocking conversation after the questline is completed.  Instead, his real post-quest dialogue is unlocked, including Guild Master-appropriate dialogue options and greetings that would be otherwise inaccessible.  Finally, he\\'ll give you the respect you deserve!  Or something like that...\r\n\r\nOnly takes effect after the entire Thieves Guild questline is complete, and the player is Guild Master.  You\\'re stuck with hearing it occasionally until then, I\\'m afraid.\r\n\r\nInstall:  \r\nJust stick the .esp file in your skyrim/Data folder, and you\\'re good to go.\r\n\r\n--=xx=--",
