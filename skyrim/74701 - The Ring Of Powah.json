  "descriptionHtml": "I made this a while back, and I&#39;m finally gonna upload it.Â \r<br />\r<br />This adds a note on Farengar (Whiterun Court Wizard)&#39;s desk that starts a simple quest to retrieve a ring. This ring is basically the &#34;One Ring&#34; from LoTR, or at least what I know about it from the Hobbit movies.\r<br />\r<br />The ring:\r<br />-Makes you invisible\r<br />-Greatly Improves Sneak\r<br />-Adds a cool visual effect, similar to the movie.\r<br />\r<br />if you aren&#39;t invisible, try sneaking or unequipping the ring. I honestly don&#39;t remember if the invis effect is sneak only or not (I made this mod a year ago).\r<br />\r<br />Please use the Nexus Mod Manager to install, &#39;cuz I forgot the normal way and don&#39;t feel like looking it up.",
