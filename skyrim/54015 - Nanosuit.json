  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple Mod that adds the Functionality of the Nanosuit to Skyrim. \r<br />Since this is obviously a cheatmod, i decided to make it noncraftable and put it into Sovngarde, where you can get it after dealing with Alduin. \r<br />Currently, the Armor looks like the Blades Armor, which was unique to have in the Game, that means, it doesn&#39;t interfere with other Armor. \r<br />The&#39;re 4 Armorparts, each with a custom Enchantment. \r<br />These mostly boost the Attributes of your Character, but also may make you invisible(by using the Boots, only for 20 seconds). \r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;ve already finished the Dragonslayerquest and still want the Armor, you can type &#39;help Nano&#39; in the Commandbox, where it will show you the IDs for the Armorparts. \r<br />The Armor may break your game, not by crashing it but by actually making it to easy...\r<br />\r<br />Boots: \r<br />-invisibility for 20 seconds \r<br />-Sneakability + 9001% probability of not getting caught \r<br />-Stamina + 1000 Points \r<br />-20 seconds after invisibility of 10001% probability not getting caught \r<br />Chestpiece: \r<br />- +100% Resist against Fire, Lightning, Ice, Arrows, Deseases and Magic \r<br />- + 100.000 Carryweight \r<br />- + 1000 Health \r<br />- + 2000% of Armor for Light and Heavy Armor. \r<br />Gauntlets: \r<br />- Stamina + 9000 Points \r<br />- Fortify Archery + 1000 Points \r<br />- Fortify One- / Twohanded + 200 Points \r<br />- Fortify Lockpicking + 9001 Points \r<br />- Fortify Pickpocket + 1000 Points \r<br />Helmet: \r<br />- Speechcraft + 11000 Points \r<br />- + 1000 ingameminutes of waterbreathing \r<br />- Shoutrecovery/ Health/Archery + 1000 Points \r<br />- Persuasion + 100 Points \r<br />[Disclaimer] \r<br />This does not add the actual Nanosuit, which is protected for use by Crytek only - It only adds an Armor with the nearly same functionality as in Cryteks games. \r<br />",
