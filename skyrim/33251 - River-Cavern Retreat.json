  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will add a medium sized home just West of Riverwood, virtually within the city walls. The home includes: \r\n\r\n-furnace\r\n-smelter\r\n-grindstone\r\n-tanning rack\r\n-smithing storage\r\n-alchemy table\r\n-enchanting table \r\n- Talos shrine\r\n- weapon racks\r\n- mannequins \r\n\r\nThis unique home is built using Noridic style architecture, but fully furnished with high quality wooden furniture. It has two bedrooms (both with double beds. One includes an on suit sauna), a large open-planned living area and kitchen, and a separate room for smiting, enchanting and alchemy. Throughout the house there are  weapon racks and mannequins to display all your trophy items and a shrine to Talos if you\\'re the religious type.\r\n\r\nAs you leave your bedroom you walk straight onto the balcony. From here you can sit and relax as you enjoy the unusual, but equally stunning view. This house is built into the side of a small underground cavern housing a little river and plenty of animals. Because the kitchen and living room are open planned you can sit and relax in front of the fire while this amazing environment is just a turn of the head away. \r\n\r\nThe outside of the house is a relatively plain Nordic-looking entrance. It is just over the river from Riverwood, but close enough so that all you need to do is walk across a small bridge to be at the mill. \r\n \r\nI can\\'t really say much more about this house and please excuse my poor writing. I hope you\\'ll enjoy living here!",
