This will allow you and your followers to ride it(them).\r<br />\r<br />TOOLS:\r<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/13530-1-1332530294.jpg[/img]\r<br />There are two Branders. One with your mark and one with followers mark.\r<br />Using it does the following:\r<br />Removes STOLEN status (Your Mark)\r<br />Prevents horse from wandering off when dismounted (Both Marks)\r<br />Allows follower to ride the marked horse (Both Marks)\r<br />Allows MULTIPLE followers to ride the marked horses (Follower Mark)\r<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/13530-2-1332530294.jpg[/img]\r<br />Unbrander removes any mark given to a horse, in essence setting it free to roam and be jolly on its own. Maybe find a mare.. who knows&#33;\r<br />\r<br />ADD-ON:\r<br />With horse branding you will also get Basic Riding AI.\r<br />This will allow your follower to mount a horse when you do and follow you.\r<br />It can be disabled if you are using other horse riding mods.\r<br />\r<br />WHAT DOES IT WORK WITH??:\r<br />[url=file.php?id=8530][img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/8530-1-1329937270.png[/img][/url]\r<br />Horse Branding has been tested with TCG Extended Version and  TCG + Multifollowers combo.
