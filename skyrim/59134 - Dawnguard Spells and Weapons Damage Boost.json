  "descriptionHtml": "**I&#39;ve forgotten to change a few attributes (minor), such as Stendarr&#39;s Aura description, etc, which I will fix. Let me know of anything you have a problem with.**\r<br />\r<br />[b]~REQUIRES DAWNGUARD\r<br />~Compatible with all mods that do not edit these spells&#39; and weapons&#39; statistics.\r<br />[/b]\r<br />I&#39;ve honestly felt that the damage dealt by the vanilla versions of Dawnguard were pathetic. Here I was, eager to dabble in a completely new area of magic, and they give you a meager 10 points of dps on Stendarr&#39;s Aura and &#34;Vampire&#39;s Bane&#34; did 60 points. By the time you even rescue Florentius from the damnable vamps, they are child&#39;s play, especially if you&#39;re playing on master or legendary level difficulty. So, here&#39;s a mod that boosts the spell power of the three Restoration spells and the damage of the weapons wielded by the Dawnguard, finally worthy as end-DLC rewards.\r<br />\r<br />As for the weapons, if I was going hand to hand with a horde of nightmaster vampires, I&#39;d rather have something that&#39;d do a decent amount of damage rather than get my arse handed to me as I watch myself get consumed.\r<br />\r<br />**This is my first mod, the spells may be a bit unbalanced, so please bear with me.**\r<br />\r<br />============================\r<br />\r<br />VAMPIRE&#39;S BANE\r<br />=====\r<br />-Damage was increased to about 450.\r<br />-AoE remains the same.\r<br />\r<br />STENDARR&#39;S AURA\r<br />=====\r<br />-Damage increased to 200.\r<br />-Cast effect lasts for 3 minutes instead of one.\r<br />\r<br />SUN FIRE\r<br />=====\r<br />-Damage increased to 150.\r<br />\r<br />DAWNGUARD WAR AXE\r<br />=====\r<br />-Damage increased to 15.\r<br />\r<br />DAWNGUARD WARHAMMER\r<br />=====\r<br />-Damage increased to 27.\r<br />\r<br />DAWNGUARD RUNE AXE\r<br />=====\r<br />-Damage increased to 21.\r<br />-Swing speed increased from .9 to .99.\r<br />\r<br />DAWNGUARD RUNE HAMMER\r<br />=====\r<br />-Damage increased to 42.\r<br />-Swing speed increased from .6 to .75.\r<br />-Rune damage increased to 130.\r<br />\r<br />Any feedback is appreciated :) Again, some of the stats may seem unbalanced, but truly, you&#39;ll be able to land a few good blows with these before having to resort to healing spells.",
