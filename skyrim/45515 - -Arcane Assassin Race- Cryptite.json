  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=peru][size=48][Short Description][/color][/size]\r\nThis is a race that I made for assassins. The race is called \"Cryptite(s)\", and they look like Dunmer (Dark Elves). They are a balanced race, and they don't break immersion.\r\n\r\n[size=48][color=pink][Remember To Endorse!!] [/color][/size]\r\n[color=deeppink][Please notify me about any errors. Please feedback and endorse if you like the mod.][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=48][color=palegreen][Back Story][/size][/color]\r\nDuring the Merethic Era, a rare creature called Cryptites were discovered. Cryptites became so rare that their presence was questioned. By the end of the 2nd Era, people marked them as extinct. During the Merethic Era ,  Cryptites were afraid a war was going to break out. This would cause their extinction, so they went into hiding. They decided to hide in caves and breed. Near the Fourth Era, the Cryptites finally decided to come out of hiding. They came out to see that Elves and Nords were in a battle, and that other wars were taking place. No one wanted to hide from their fears anymore, so they decided to learn about the world. While they were hiding, they gained a weakness to elements.\r\n\r\n[size=48][color=orangered][Overview][/size][/color]\r\nIllusion +10\r\nDestruction +5\r\nAlteration +5\r\nSneak +5\r\nPick pocketing +5\r\nEnchanting +5\r\nGreater Power: Chameleon- Invisibility for 45 seconds once a day.\r\nAbility: While sneaking, you are cloaked in a dark shroud (Ebony Mail Dark Smoke), making you muffled and making sneaking 10% easier.\r\nDisease/Ability: 35% weaker to fire, frost and shock.\r\n\r\n[size=48][color=chocolate][Compatibility][/size][/color]\r\nShould be compatible with everything. \r\nI use Skyre, so that's why Cryptites have +5 in Pickpocketing (Fingersmith) not Lockpicking (Wayfarer)\r\n\r\n[size=48][color=khaki][Bugs/Issues][/size][/color]\r\nDark Shroud doesn't make your hair completely black [Can't be fixed]\r\nInvisibility spell might be slightly messed up ( I think I messed up the description a little bit, but tell me if their is any other problems with the invisibility spell)\r\nEbony-mail dark shroud might have a slightly messed up description. ( The actual armor)\r\n\r\n[size=48][color=slateblue][About This Mod][/size][/color]\r\nThis race is based off of a story I wrote. This mod was initially going to be a private mod, but near the end, I decided I'll let the public try it out. THIS IS MY FIRST MOD!!! So I'm sure I will improve in the future. I learned a lot about the creation kit, and how to make mods.  I watched a few videos, but they didn't really help, so I had to learn by experimenting. I hope you will enjoy this mod and leave feedback in the comment section. \r\n[color=forestgreen][size=48][Change-log] [/color][/size]\r\n[color=crimson]Version 2\r\nFixed some grammar issues \r\nFixed the download error for NMM\r\nFixed \"Dark Step\"\r\nAdded Pictures  [/color]\r\n[color=dodgerblue]Version 1.B\r\nMade Cryptites 35% weaker (instead of 20%)  \r\nFixed muffle effect  \r\nFixed inaccurate backstory  [/color]\r\n[color=cyan]Version 1.A\r\nInitial release[/color]\r\n\r\n[size=48][color=darkorange] [Credits][/color][/size]\r\nginga_ninja (for helping me with some bugs and other stuff)\r\nBethesda\r\nCreativity ( For being there for me)\r\n\r\n[size=24][color=darkseagreen][Other][/size][/color]\r\nUse at your own risk!!!
