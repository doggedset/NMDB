  "descriptionHtml": "though this mod may be used anywhere you can insert new models, i am putting it here as this was intended with several existing mods in mind which, for whatever reason, used the vanilla wolf mesh for their hyenas. such as moonpath to elsweyr. or if you wanna go through the trouble of texturing this lil buddy up to replace the raptors in tropical skyrim with hyenas (i know i would, just cause they seem a little out of place). i may or may not make a striped and brown hyena model for those who also want or would prefer (a) &#34;true hyena(s)&#34;.\r<br />other tips i can give to any one who textures this, as i had to leave out quite alot to maintain a reasonable model size:\r<br />-spotted hyenas have very diverse genetics in that they come in all sorts of spot-opacity, many variations of tan/beige and orangey-red, and fur length varying from &#34;skin-tight&#34; to pretty dang fluffy. so theres alot of freedom there.\r<br />-the &#34;mane&#34; of spotted hyenas flow towards the head, not the shoulders, interestingly\r<br />-the tail fur is loose, and &#34;feathery&#34;, not at all dog-like or cat-like.\r<br />-hyenas do not have a &#34;lip seam&#34; like many animals do\r<br />\r<br />I offer both the scuptris file, and .obj file. i used several references and if you are interested, heres the links to them ([url=https://wildfieldphotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/image0026.jpg]1[/url]) ([url=https://40.media.tumblr.com/18a071b1e07774656ce750f251aef65d/tumblr_mewl554nDI1ql1p9ao1_400.jpg]2[/url]) ([url=https://boneclones.com/images/store-product/product-317-main-main-big-1415039576.jpg]3[/url]) ([url=http://www.iliatorlin.com//wp-content/gallery/harar/HARAR-ETHIOPIA-DECEMBER-23-2013-An-unidentified-man-feeds-a-spotted-hyena-crocuta-crocuta-in-ancient-city-of-Jugol-Tradition-that-started-some-year-ago-still-maintained-today-20131223_184223_I_IMG_0263.jpg]4[/url]). there were more but i cant find the others oh well.\r<br />\r<br />if there are any issues with the model, please tell me. please be specific in your report so i can try to fix it. i am currently attempting to refine the face, and may upload when contented. you can use this one as is though\r<br />\r<br />future plans: none really but if anyone wants to provide a texture, or general skeleton, or whatever to add to this file, go ahead n ill credit you, or link to your file(s) if you dont want them here.",
