Extract file to your Skyrim data files or use a mod manager to install.\r\n Mod managers like Nexus are highly recommended because it allows you to un-install, bringing your game back to vanilla.\r\n\r\n2. To use this, you need to aquire the Dark Brotherhood armor or use this mod to be able to craft the items.\r\nhttp://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=799 Crafted will not have enchantments.\r\n\r\n3. If you want a set with enchantments, you can allways console command \\\"coc qasmoke\\\" and find them in the normal armor container, then \\\"coc riverwood\\\" to bring you back to the game.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================\r\n\r\nPermission of author of these mod.\r\n===================================\r\nNo permission needed.
