  "summary": "This mod simply adds a small shack outside of the first dark brotherhood sanctuary. I&#39;m gonna warn you, it&#39;s nicht so gern.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a small shack outside of the dark brother hood sanctuary, it&#39;s made in Skyrim Creation Kit, and requires absolutely no dlc, so you modders who ripped the game don&#39;t need to worry about editing it. I am leaving this mod open for remodling and whatnot, as long as you giveatleast some mention to my name in the mod, [u]MadBruh[/u], like I would like someone to add some Mannequins and weapon racks/plaques, and possibly a flat floor, because it is still the natural dirt and grass. \r<br />\r<br />The shack is open world, so it has no loading screens because I find them so annoying, so be aware that I have not added any chests to it, for they might be looted by random NPC&#39;s. AGAIN, any modders, please look into this, because I am only a freshman in highschool and have only made 2 mods. so, help me out by PMing me directions on how to make it to where unfriendly NPC&#39;s can&#39;t loot your chests and get into the house. It has a fully functioning forge, complete with a workbench and grind wheel thinga majigger. \r<br />\r<br />Hope you enjoy the shack, it is a work in progress, so please be aware that it is not perfect in any way at all. ENJOY&#33;&#33;",
