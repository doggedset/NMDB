  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][color=darkorange]\\\"Better Enchantments for Stealth Players\\\" by UluEgo[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[color=darkorange]A: Description[/color]\r\nI\\'ve changed the default enchantments on the gears I use for my stealth character. The new stats are as follows:\r\n\r\n> Nightingale Armor: Increases your health, magic and stamina by 20 points.\r\n> Nightingale Hood: Prices are 20% better. / Can swim underwater without drowning.\r\n> Nightingale Gloves: Double sneak attack damage with one-handed. / Bows do 20% more damage.\r\n> Nightingale Boots: Wearer is muffled and moves silently. / Carrying capacity increased by 20 points.\r\n> Nightingale Blade: Absorb health and stamina 20 points (Its damage is increased slightly and its charge is equalized to Blade of Woe\\'s one).\r\n> Nightingale Bow: Absorb health 20 points and Paralyze 3 seconds.\r\n> DB Shrouded Armor: Increases your health, magic and stamina by 20 points.\r\n> Blade of Woe: Absorb health 20 points and soul trap for 3 seconds (Its charge is increased).\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t use \\\"Fortify Sneak\\\" enchantment on armors due to the bugs I\\'ve experienced about sneak skill in the vanilla game. None of the gears\\' enchantments depend on the player level, i.e., they are same for all levels. The other parts of DB armor are untouched.\r\n\r\n[color=darkorange]B: Version History[/color]\r\n> ver 1.5: WaterBreathing bug is fixed.\r\n> ver 1.4: Nightingale Bow charge usage is reduced (It is CK version now).\r\n> ver 1.3: Nightingale Blade\\'s charge is equalized to the Blade of Woe\\'s one.\r\n> ver 1.2: Blade of Woe\\'s charge is increased from 500 to 3000 (like the other good weapons in the vanilla game).\r\n> ver 1.1: Nightingale Blade\\'s damage is increased and equalized to Chillrend\\'s one.\r\n> ver 1.0: Initial Release\r\n\r\n[color=darkorange]C: My Mods[/color]\r\n> [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15634]Soul of Skyforge[/url]\r\n> [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13274]Stones of Barenziah Locations[/url]\r\n> [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10374]Vampire Blood[/url]\r\n> [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9793]Prettier Aela[/url]\r\n> [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9597]Prettier Ysolda[/url]\r\n> [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8969]Infinite Night Eye for Khajiits and Dark Elves[/url]\r\n> [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8911]Rich Belethor[/url]\r\n> [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7680]Deadric Blade of Woe[/url]\r\n> [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6967]Better Enchantments for Stealth Players[/url]\r\n> [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6898]Nightingale Enchantment[/url]\r\n\r\n[color=darkorange]D: Additional Information[/color]\r\n> To install the mod, extract the \\\"zip\\\" file and place it in your \\\"...\\\\Data\\\\\\\" folder.
