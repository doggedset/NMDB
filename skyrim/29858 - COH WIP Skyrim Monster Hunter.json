  "descriptionHtml": "The idea for this mod is to take monster hunter like designs and implement the gameplay into skyrim, now that i am getting interested in a monster hunter skyrim id like to create such a world but seeming how i didnt buy skyrim through steam it wont let me installl the creation kit, so atm i have no way of making it yet but i can start on the characters and textures asap. \r\nyes some mods offer new creatures and what not but what about the gameplay? and new weapons and quests? well this modder will focus my time when i have the chance on this mod so i can create a better and more interesting skyrim.",
