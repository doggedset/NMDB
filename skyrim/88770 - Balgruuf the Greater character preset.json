  "summary": "A \"mod\" that allows you to make your character look exactly like Balgruuf the Greater! Feel free to suggest any other npc in vanilla Skyrim. Enjoy!",
  "descriptionHtml": "To install, extract the esp. file into your Data folder in your game's directory. Once installed, load Skyrim and open the character creation. Select the race \"Nord\" and select the last preset. And obviously make sure the sex is male. Feel free to suggest any other vanilla npc for me to upload :) (I didn't create any mods I simply made a preset.) After you select the preset and it works, feel free to delete the mod as it will not change your character, your choice though! (Make sure to save before hand.)",
