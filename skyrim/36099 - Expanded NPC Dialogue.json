  "summary": "A dialogue mod that expands roleplay and conversation options with NPCs.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=green]\r\n[i]Are you bored of how little conversations there are?[/i]\r\n[i]Do NPCs taste too \\\"bland\\\"?[/i]\r\n[i]Do you want a deeper RP experience to reflect your character\\'s personality?[/i]\r\n[/color] \r\n\r\nWell, you\\'ve come to the right place!\r\nThis is the beginning of a mod that I plan on extending to almost every Skyrim NPC. I always felt disappointed by the lack of conversation and RP choices, hence this mod was born. Now you can have a friendship that\\'s more than just \\\"carry my things, slave\\\". They\\'ll actually have something to say.\r\n\r\n[b]UPDATE 2.0[/b]\r\nNow featuring followers: Belrand, Faendal, Jenassa, J\\'zargo, Lydia, Marcurio, Sven, and Uthgerd.\r\n\r\n[b]FUTURE PLANS[/b]\r\nFuture plans are to eventually extend to all followers, and then regular npcs. Currently, each follower has about 100+ lines of unique dialogue so please be patient!\r\n[color=green] [b]\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\n     ***Complex dialogue trees with multiple choices.\r\n     ***Location specific comments.\r\n     ***Player Race/Gender awareness (yes, including vampires)\r\n     ***A \\\"chat\\\" option with randomized comments (depending on location, race, the time of day,        and what weapon you\\'ve equipped)\r\n     ***Go to the inn or player house for general \\\"socializing\\\" dialogue. (You can even roleplay buying your follower a drink!)\r\n     ***Romance options (kiss, sex, give your honey a gift)\r\n\r\n[/b] [/color] \r\nEach of them have unique personalities and you even have the option to romance them.\r\nBy \\\"romance\\\" I mean you can roleplay kissing and sexy times. Sex is displayed as several seconds of black screen. To unlock romance options, go to the inn or player home and discover it for yourself! \r\n\r\nYou can have either a casual or serious relationship with the npc (or multiple npcs). Only marriageable npcs get to have the serious relationship options. There\\'s an option to \\\"break up\\\" with the npc, but you won\\'t be allowed to romance them again.\r\n\r\nI highly suggest that you go through the romance dialogue options BEFORE marrying the npc just for continuity\\'s sake.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, [u]THIS IS ALL TEXT DIALOGUE[/u].\r\nI was aiming for a more Morrowind-style conversation system.  \r\nNot to worry - all the usual, spoken comments from the vanilla game have been left alone.\r\n\r\nIF you don\\'t like the text dialogue, and absolutely can\\'t live without voice acting... \r\nhere\\'s a little tip for you:\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/HtHiwuE.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAnyways, I hope you enjoy my creation. Please let me know about your experience in the comments. If you have any suggestions or would even like to try your hand at writing, send me a pm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]INSTALLATION[/b]\r\nJust use NMM or drop the .esp file into Skyrim\\\\Data folder.\r\n\r\n[b]REQUIREMENTS[/b] [i](YOU NEED THESE FOR THE MOD TO WORK PROPERLY)[/i]\r\nFuz Ro D\\'oh      http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14884//?\r\nSKSE               http://skse.silverlock.org/\r\n\r\n[b]COMPATIBILITIES[/b]\r\nI simply added a new \\\"dialogue quest\\\" on top of the vanilla game, so it should be compatible with most all mods.\r\n\r\n[b]TROUBLESHOOTING[/b]\r\nIf the new dialogue options aren\\'t showing, simply save and reload.",
