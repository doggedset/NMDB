  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=3]This small and simple mod is a custom editedretexture and mesh replacer for Unique Grasses And Ground Covers I created for\r<br />myself some time ago and wanted to share it with others. I made this small mod\r<br />in an effort to improve my performance as well as preserving  the overall\r<br />quality and aesthetic of my Skyrim by by offering more variety on the types of\r<br />grasses you see in Skyrim&#39;s rich forests. In a real thriving forest environment\r<br />with populated species of different kinds of grass in which the wilderness area\r<br />has been undeveloped and unfounded you would find grasses that some would\r<br />call weeds and would grow unusually high. Skyrim landscapes were meant to\r<br />appear more harsh and forbidding imo. Although I&#39;m not a botanist I&#39;d like\r<br />to offer grasses with a little hint of realism\r<br />\r<br />[img width=370,height=180]file:///C:/Users/unknown/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />However I  believe there&#39;s a limit on the types ofgrass Skyrim is able to only use, and so I combined various grasses into one\r<br />texture loading them with a larger mesh. It replaces most meshes with two\r<br />&#34;lusher&#34; mesh models I found in Skyrim&#39;s meshes folder. These meshes\r<br />also increase the amount of grass and ground cover you see per mesh. The mesh\r<br />models that Unique Grasses uses for it&#39;s grass and groundcover are small. \r<br />\r<br />Side by side comparison between the two [b]ground cover[/b] meshes  \r<br />                     \r<br />aspen leaf pile model               \r<br />                     \r<br />                     \r<br />    clover patch model\r<br />\r<br />[img width=350,height=190]file:///C:/Users/unknown/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png[/img]                  [img width=350,height=190]file:///C:/Users/unknown/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Side by side comparison between the two [b]grass [/b]meshes\r<br />\r<br />   grass model               \r<br />                     \r<br />                     \r<br />               reach bush model\r<br />\r<br />[img width=340,height=180]file:///C:/Users/unknown/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.png[/img]                  [img width=340,height=180]file:///C:/Users/unknown/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image005.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The models I use are more larger or &#34;lush&#34;. Theyboth replace the grasses and groundcover found in the Pine Forest and The Rift.\r<br />The result is more grass covering more areas. This actually reduces the need to\r<br />increase the grass size in your Skyrim.ini leaving more space for more\r<br />performance. This mod is in efforts and aims to make grasses appear more dense,\r<br />diverse and performance friendly\r<br />\r<br />Details\r<br />\r<br /> When asked to overwrite UGG (NMM users: select&#34;Yes to Mod&#34;) and do not use the plugin provided with UGG, use\r<br />Tamu75&#39;s Unique Grasses And Ground Cover Plugin and untick  &#34;Unique\r<br />Grasses.esp&#34; and keep &#34;UGCustum.esp&#34; plugin ticked in your load\r<br />order\r<br />\r<br />Set * iMinGrassSize=100 in your Skyrim.ini, the higherthis value is the less grass you will see. \r<br />\r<br /> *This value is appropriate due to having a densemesh model loaded for every grass type, if this value is set way too low\r<br />  it can cause you to see much more grass andgrass clipping would be much more noticeable, and may cause performance \r<br />  issues which goes against what I originallyintended for this mod to achieve which is the purpose of achieving better \r<br />  performance, tweak this setting as youplease according to your needs\r<br />\r<br />Regions Covered In My Mod\r<br />\r<br />Pine Forest (Falkreath) and The Rift (Riften). I&#39;ve made nochanges to the Tundra Marsh (Solitude) or the Reach (Markarth) and I will try\r<br />to cover these area soon when I have more time to work on them\r<br />\r<br />Models Replaced from UGG\r<br />\r<br />EGrass14 - This model is actually the main model for thegrass you would commonly find in the Pine Forest area\r<br />\r<br />Credits & Special Thanks\r<br />\r<br />Josh Ezzell for the Creator of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42370/?]Unique Grasses andGroundcovers[/url]\r<br />Preeum - ESpBlueberry01, ESpBlueberryBush02from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60220/?]Verdant[/url]\r<br />Renthal311 for his clover plant and forestgrass textures\r<br />Pfuscher - aspenleafpile01.dds and forestclover_plant.dds from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49661/]4K Parallax Skyrim[/url]\r<br />snfkin - angelica06 and willowherb10 textures from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71240/?]Grim Grass[/url]\r<br />32cm - trebolgrass,19grassobj, 5grassobj, 47grassobj, 45grassobj and helegrass\r<br />textures from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61995/?]Tamriel Reloaded HD[/url]\r<br />Bethesda for the Clover model I used for the aspenleafpileand the Reach Bush Model I used for the grasses\r<br />\r<br />Recommended Mods\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9005/?]Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods (32bit versionunder Miscellaneous) by code1k[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Permission\r<br />\r<br />Anyone is freely welcome to improve upon my existing workand you are free to make translations, upload this to other sites, or share\r<br />this with anyone you like so long you credit and acquire permission from\r<br />each of the original Mod Authors to feature any part this mod in your own mod.[/size][/center]",
