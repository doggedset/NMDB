  "summary": "Ever wanted to shoot arrows from your hands? Well this mod conjures an arcane arrow which is sent flying toward its target.",
  "descriptionHtml": "\r\n\r\nThis spell summons an arrow that goes flying towards its target upon release. The arrow does 26 points of damage, and the spell is available to low level characters. No quest, you just have to go into the Riverwood Trader and learn the spell from the tome on the counter. It\\'s called \\'Mage\\'s Arrow\\' in game. (I\\'ll fix it later) \r\n\r\nI\\'ll balance it more thoroughly later, but it has had the rare issue of causing me CTD\\'s. This is my second iteration, built from scratch, so I have now idea why this happens ( Likely its just that I have too many mods, or things going on in the background of my computer while I run the game ). That being said, I would very much appreciate anyone willing to help me address the bugs that might pop up. Also, if anyone wants to make a special animation for the spell, or an inventory icon or anything like that, just let me know. I have no idea how to do that sort of thing and I\\'d love ot implement that into the mod.\r\n\r\n-To Do-\r\n1. Fix Bugs\r\n2. Tweak Balance\r\n3. Add special \\'rapid fire\\' effect for the dual casting\r\n4. Fix Any New Bugs\r\n5. Balance again\r\n6. Animations/Quest?\r\n\r\n",
