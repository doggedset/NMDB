  "descriptionHtml": "[b][b][b]Update July 31th, 2017[/b]\r<br />[/b][/b]Anyone who wishes to port this mod to Skyrim Special Edition has my blessing to do so.[b][b][b]\r<br />[/b][/b]\r<br />Description[/b]\r<br />This mod is designed to enhance the Stormcloak experience by turning the housecarl of Lakeview Manor into an authentic-looking Nord. The main motivation for this is that when the Dragonborn is a Stormcloak loyalist and Falkreath is under Stormcloak leadership, it doesn&#39;t make sense for the Jarl to assign him/her a Redguard housecarl. The mod is by no means exclusive to Stormcloak characters however; it&#39;s a modest adjustment that may be applied to anyone&#39;s game, provided they&#39;ve installed the official Hearthfire DLC.\r<br />\r<br />The Falkreath housecarl is originally named &#39;Rayya&#39;, but will be renamed to the Scandinavian &#39;Ulvhild&#39; if you apply this mod. She&#39;ll naturally remain female, and she&#39;ll still use the same voice set (by Claudia Christian in the English version). Her skills will also remain the same. Aside from her new name, the following changes will take place:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Her race will be adjusted from &#39;Redguard&#39; to &#39;Nord&#39;\r<br />[*]Her physical appearance will be adjusted to reflect her race\r<br />[*]She&#39;ll wield war axes instead of scimitars\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\r<br />The official Hearthfire DLC is required. There are no known compatibility issues with other mods, and given the very limited scope of this mod I don&#39;t expect there to be any. The mod should be entirely lore-friendly as well, as the original housecarl is never referred to by name or race (to the best of my knowledge).\r<br />\r<br />[b]My other mods[/b][list]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47272/?]Consistent Vignar Gray-Mane[/url]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48626/?]Realistic Animal Loot[/url]\r<br />[/list]",
