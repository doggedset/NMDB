  "descriptionHtml": "Inquisitor Armor Pack v1\r<br />\r<br />Yet another small preview of my upcoming Hammerfell mod, this mod adds several new armor pieces that are fully modular. \r<br />\r<br />-The new Greave pieces\r<br />  *Iron\r<br />  *Steel\r<br />  *Inquisitor\r<br />\r<br />As well as a new Inquisitor Cuirass, Boots, Gloves, and Hood.\r<br />\r<br />There should be no compatibility issues, and the armors have been thoroughly tested.\r<br />\r<br />There are male and female versions but the female may be a bit buggy. Weight slider supported&#33;\r<br />\r<br />**Clipping issues have been noted, and may be resolved in a future update.**\r<br />\r<br />Also included is an old school style quest to retrieve the new items. By old school I mean, no hints, no markers, no quest info in your journal. You must read the clues, and deduce where to go. If you&#39;re absolutely stuck, or super lazy, you can find the locations in the ReadMe file (click the gear icon above).\r<br />\r<br />The quest can be started by finding the note on the bar in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />Installation-\r<br />\r<br />Download with manager&#33;\r<br />\r<br />     or\r<br />\r<br />Download manually\r<br />Extract the the contents of the file to your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />All work done in Nifskope, GIMP, and CK.\r<br />\r<br />And of course, please check out our Dev Diary series for more info on Hammerfell.",
