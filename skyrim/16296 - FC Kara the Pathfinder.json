  "descriptionHtml": "============================================================================\r\nFC Kara the Pathfinder\r\n============================================================================\r\na Flatline Construct\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI\\'m new to modding, and my first project was an attempt at understanding the\r\nCreation Kit. Finally finished and thought I\\'d share.\r\n\r\nI hope I\\'ve done a decent job.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I\\'ve added a stand alone version of Kara, for those who don\\'t want the\r\nhouse or the dog. She can be found in The Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun.\r\nPlease remember that her default home location will be the exact place you\r\ndismiss her. This is based on version 1.0 only.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMOD REQUIREMENTS?\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis mod was created using a vanilla version of Skyrim.\r\n\r\nIt does not require any other mods to function.\r\nI\\'ve also tried to make it as mod friendly as possible by not editing any\r\ncore game packages or scripts.\r\n\r\nThe screen caps use mrLenski Coverwoman Look #4 and Caliente\\'s CBBE Body and\r\nArmor mods. (Not required for my mod to work)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nVERSION CHANGES\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you are upgrading from an earlier version you will\r\nneed a clean save. Dismiss Kara, divorce with the console if\r\nyou need to, go to a safe cell (eg. Whiterun), save. Then\r\nremove the mod. Load up your game and save again. Then\r\ninstall the new version.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n- Cleaned up pathfinding scripts.\r\n- Added animation to War Horn. \r\n- War Horn now calls her dog too, if set to following.\r\n- Added options to keep Nomad (the dog) as Kara\\'s follower.\r\n  (NOTE: Nomad does get in the way alot, and tends to\r\n  wander. But I\\'ve not lost him yet, and the wandering is\r\n  actually quite an entertaining, and unintentional, bonus.)\r\n- Fixed glitch when you fast travel to Snowberry End which\r\n  caused your horse to materialise in the air (and fall to it\\'s\r\n  death).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAdds a new NPC follower to the game called Kara the Pathfinder.\r\n\r\nShe can be found with her dog Nomad in Snowberry End, a small house just \r\nEast of Windhelm. Up the road from Hollyfrost Farm.\r\n\r\nHer stats are set to level scale with the PC.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'d like to discover what she does while playing the game, skip the\r\nspoilers below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**** SPOILERS BELOW ****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the name suggests, Kara is a Pathfinder. When asked, she\\'ll escort you to\r\nany of the main inns in Skyrim, fifteen in total. She\\'ll automatically reset\r\nher state to follower when reaching her destination, or you can just talk to\r\nher and cancel out at any time on the way.\r\n\r\nShe\\'ll supply you with a War Horn when you first recruit her as a follower, \r\njust in case you lose her. This War Horn is used from your inventory to call\r\nher. It works anywhere but I suggest leaving a bit of space for it to work \r\ncorrectly. If it fails you can always move to a more open area and try again.\r\n(Also, using the War Horn will disable and enable her, if she\\'s not in follower\r\nmode at the time it should refresh her stats for you.)\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 Nomad only followers Kara when she\\'s not your current follower.\r\nVersion 1.1 now has a conversation option to dismiss Nomad or get him \r\nfollowing Kara again so you can take him adventuring with you.\r\n\r\nIncluded is the option to change her default outfit. She has two main \r\nvariations: Normal Armor and Tavern Wench. There\\'s a third option that\\'s\r\ndisabled until you marry her.\r\n\r\nAll dialogue is voiced with lip sync. (Female Sultry)\r\n\r\nShe is set to Potential Follower Faction. I\\'ve not edited the follower \r\nscripts or packages as I\\'m hoping Kara will work with any of the great \r\nfollower mods out there. This causes the dialogue to be a little off\r\nbecause there\\'s no Female Sultry voice type for followers, but it isn\\'t too\r\nbad. (UFO and AFT confirmed working)\r\n\r\nShe is set to Potential Marriage Faction. Again, I\\'ve not edited anything, \r\nso any marriage enhancement mods should work fine.\r\n(Spouses Can Live Everywhere confirmed)\r\n* Marry her to get more conversation options.\r\n\r\nNone of Snowberry End\\'s containers are set to respawn.\r\n\r\nKara and Nomad are set to essential by default. If you really want either of\r\nthem to die just use the console.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**** SPOILERS END ****\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHOW TO INSTALL\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInstall with NMM or just copy FCKaraThePathfinder.esp and \r\nFCKaraThePathfinder.bsa directly into your Skyrim DATA folder.\r\n\r\nI have no plans to upload to Steam Workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHOW TO REMOVE THE MOD\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRemove with NMM or delete these 2 files in your Skyrim DATA folder:\r\n\r\nFCKaraThePathfinder.esp\r\nFCKaraThePathfinder.bsa\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBUGS\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSometimes she can get \\\"lost\\\" if you fast travel while she\\'s in escort mode.\r\nUse the War Horn provided to call her to you.\r\n\r\nShe can sometimes get stuck on objects while escorting. This is a game\r\nissue, objects blocking her path, a dodgy nav mesh, etc. Just talk to her to\r\ncancel the escort.\r\n\r\nThe pathfinding can get confused if the area is inaccessible. An example is\r\nHelgen, where the two sides of the town are cut off by rubble. Kara will \r\nwalk back on herself. Just cancel out of escort mode, and use the War Horn \r\nwhen you\\'re past the obstruction.\r\n\r\nFound another area where the pathfinding get\\'s confused. She has a problem\r\ngetting from the east side of the Reach to Markarth. She gets confused near\r\nRorikstead and keeps walking back on herself. I did the trip from Markarth to\r\nFalkreath just fine, so it does seem to work the other way around. And it \r\nseems to work fine from places west of the Reach. It\\'s just getting over that\r\nmountain range she\\'s got a problem with.\r\n\r\nAnother area where the pathfinding glitches is the path from Windhelm to Riften.\r\nOnce you get past Mzulft on the road she should no longer double back on \r\nherself, and she\\'ll lead you to Riften.\r\n\r\nTry to keep the distances smaller if possible (ie. travel to the nearest inn) if you\r\nwant to minimise the glitching.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you find other bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOTHER USAGE\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFeel free to use any part of this mod, however I would appreciate a mention\r\nas the original source.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCREDITS\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r\nThe Nexus for giving me a place to showcase the work.\r\nmrLenski for his Coverwoman mod.
