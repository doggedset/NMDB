  "descriptionHtml": "Basically, I was really annoyed with the Thieves Guild Bouncer \\\"Dirge\\\", who always greeted me with \\\"Even if you\\'re one of us, you better not make trouble.\\\", or \\\"I don\\'t care if you\\'re best buddies with the guild master, I\\'ll still smash in your skull if you try anything\\\", even if I, myself, WAS the guild master, so I put my big boy pants on, went into the creation kit and made it to where he should only say that the first time you talk to him. This being my first mod, I\\'m glad to say it works well for me, and if there is anyone else who is tired of this man, please, give it a try.\r\n\r\nJust take the esp and put in the data folder. Same as any other basic mod.",
