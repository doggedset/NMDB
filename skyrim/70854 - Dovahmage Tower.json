There are no pics of the hidden rooms on Nexus. \r<br />\r<br />Here is a list of some of the things you can find within:\r<br />Alchemy lab on the balconey.\r<br />Experiment room with Staff Making fasilities.\r<br />Central tower with Enchanting altar, storage, and Library.\r<br />Kitchen with lots of storage. \r<br />Fully equiped Blacksmith room, able to make skyforge equiptment.\r<br />Church of the gods room.\r<br />Bed Room with many many mannequins and storage.\r<br />Basement with even more storage and a wine cellar&#33;\r<br />Several special hidden rooms.\r<br />Map marker on the balcony for easy access (you have to activate it ingame).\r<br />And more.\r<br />\r<br />YOU NEED:All DLC.\r<br />\r<br />[b]You must download http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11682/?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Installation: \r<br />Extract to a safe place like desktop and open the folders till you get to the Data folder, put all the files in the Data folder into your games Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Bugs:It&#39;s only happened once but the soul gem container lost gravity and began to float around (Don&#39;t hold the use button too long).\r<br />The other bug I can&#39;t fix so you might be able to help me. The mannequins have both a talk and use function. TALK is in their centre and USE is a bit to the right.\r<br />And oddly everytime I try to load this in the Creation Kit it crashes. Need help on this one too.
