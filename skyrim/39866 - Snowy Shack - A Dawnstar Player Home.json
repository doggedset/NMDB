  "descriptionHtml": "I made this for a friend who is an avid user of Frostfall . He was looking for a very basic player home that was completely barebones and asked me to make something for his playthrough on YouTube. 4 hours later, and it\\\\\\'s done. I hope he\\\\\\'s happy with it.\r\n\r\nThe house can be fast traveled to. For those who don\\\\\\'t like to fast travel, you can go to the lighthouse above Dawnstar and you should be able to see the house from there. When you first approach the house, you will see a table with a lantern on next to the stable. Go there and then read the note before picking up the key next to the note on the table. \r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nUse NMM or another mod manager of your choice. Or extract SnowyShack.esp to your Skyrim\\\\\\'s data directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
