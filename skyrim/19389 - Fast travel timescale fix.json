  "summary": "Adjusts fast travel speed to a realistic timing (for the game timescale). Fast-travels will take the same realistic time you would take traveling &#34;for real&#34; without fast-travel.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Nobody noticed your player (especially with a horse) takes 1 hour or 2 to move with fast-travel to a near location you can reach in almost 10 (in-game) minutes running to that place?\r<br />\r<br />Looks like the global setting fFastTravelSpeedMult set to 1 was the cause: changing it to 4 makes fast-travelling timings much more on par with a &#34;real run&#34; to that location. I&#39;ve been using this very basic mod-fix for 2 weeks and I can&#39;t see any bug or problem yet. It makes fast-travelling useful and with &#34;realistic&#34; timings, finally...\r<br />[B]Now all journeys should take (almost) the same time they would take if you run/ride for real to that location without fast-travel.[/B]\r<br />\r<br />Advantages of fast-travels: less boring if you have to go back and forth the same locations, respawns your lost horse+follower at the arrival.\r<br />\r<br />N.B.\r<br />Please, don&#39;t start totally useless &#34;I&#39;m against fast-travelling&#33;&#34; flames in the comments. Won&#39;t be tolerated and immediately reported to the admins.",
