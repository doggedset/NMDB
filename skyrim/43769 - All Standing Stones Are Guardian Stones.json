  "modName": "All Standing Stones Are Guardian Stones",
  "summary": "This mod adds miniature versions of every standing stone to the Guardian Stones area.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is designed to help people when they make a new character. Instead of having to settle for the mage, warrior, or thief stone, you can choose any stone you want from the very beginning of the game. \r\nI made this mod so it would also be easier for you to change your standing stone at any point in the game, and to give you easier access to some of the more remote stones, such as the serpent stone.\r\nNow all thirteen stones are easily available from the beginning! \r\n\r\nThis does not require any other mods or DLC, just skyrim.esm and AllStonesAreGuardianStones.esp\r\n\r\nThere should be no compatibility issues at all, and load order will not matter unless you have a mod that changes the guardian stones area.\r\n\r\nIf you find an error/bug, please report it so I can look into it!\r\nThanks!",
