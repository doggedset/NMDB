  "descriptionHtml": "I was appalled by the quality of the textures of the Clavicus Vile Shrine, so I decided to give them a makeover. These are the vanilla textures, but they have been enhanced significantly. If you want true retextures, make them yourself, but this is all I wanted for the time being. I hope you can enjoy them, but if not, just delete them. \r\n\r\nCurrently, it\\'s a 4096x4096 texture, but if I get enough requests, I\\'ll put up a 2048x2048 version. \r\n\r\nNo framerate impact on my system.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nDrop the texture folder into Skyrim\\'s Data folder.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nDelete the statues folder from the Data/texture/clutter folder\r\n\r\n\r\n",
