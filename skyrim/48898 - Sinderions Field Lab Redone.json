  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][b][color=red]Sinderion&#39;s Field Laboratory Redone[/color][/b][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Sinderion&#39;s Lab is a great home for Dwemer explorer characters or scholars but it has a few problems. One, there is no safe storage and features minimal crafting stations. Two, it is quite the mess and doesn&#39;t fit the look of what a grand researcher Sinderion was (hey, it may have been a few years since he died, but that was no excuse&#33;) So, after a fellow Nexus user, Daventry, messaged me a request to clean it up, I did just that.\r<br />\r<br />The Laboratory now features the following:\r<br />* Almost all crafting supplies - Alchemy, enchanting, cooking and smithing\r<br />* Unique storage containers and several safe chests\r<br />* Cluttery goodness&#33; New models courtesy of Insanity, Blary and Oarisstys.\r<br />* Double-bed with well-rested bonus\r<br />* Nav-Meshed (BUT I wouldn&#39;t recommend taking a follower in there still)\r<br />* Fus-Ro-Dah proof&#33;\r<br />* A bookcase\r<br />* Several weapon plaques for all your display needs\r<br />* Unique containers&#33; A scroll collection, food basket and alchemy container\r<br />~~ And more&#33; ~~\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Installation[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Download and drop the file into your data folder. Place meshes and textures into the appropiatly named folders. \r<br />Or just use the NMM. \r<br />To uninstall, just remove the file. Make sure to get your belongings out first though&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]====[b]Compatibility[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Compatible:[/i]\r<br />Should be fine to use with the Necromancer start in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/?] Alternate Start - Live Another Life[/url] or any other mods similar to this. \r<br />\r<br />[i]Incompatible:[/i]\r<br />Any other mods that edit Sinderion&#39;s Lab.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Permissions and Credits[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />This mod is not to be uploaded anywhere but the Skyrim Nexus.
