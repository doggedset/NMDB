Description\r\n\r\nEver wanted a fight? a real fight? \r\nAs there are only 8 dragon priests i always saw them as the special enemy monster #1 in skyrim and i wanted them more \\\"special\\\". So here we go.\r\n\r\n2. What this mod does\r\n\r\nThis plugin will turn dragonpriests into the pinnacle of all enemies in skyrim. They will use masterlevel destruction spells, are two times faster and got their hp raised through the roof (yea no more \\\"i oneshotted him with a x30 sneak attack\\\" cheesyness).\r\n\r\nThey have now 9000 HP up from 1490 and use (for some unknown reason to me) 90% of all times lightning storm instead of fire storm or blizzard, they still use their normal attacks like staffs incinerate and so on . A word of warning though, lightning storm ignores resistance with this plugin. \r\nIf you see the dragonpriest doing nothing for around 2-3 seconds, i recommend to seek cover.\r\n\r\n3. Installation\r\nPaste the Godlike Dragonpriests.esp into your Data folder and activate it in the skyrim launcher.\r\n\r\n4. Compatibility\r\n\r\nI\\'ve only tweaked vanilla settings here, but i dare to say this will conflict with anything that modifies Dragonpriests (except textures of course).\r\n\r\n5. Credits\r\nKudos to Bethesda for making another awesome game in the TES series. - Skyrim.\r\n",
