  "descriptionHtml": "According to the book, Immortal Blood, the breath of a Volkihar vampire can freeze a victim\\'s blood in their veins. This is a relatively simple mod, that gives vampire characters a power that does just that. If the player is already a vampire, the power should appear the next time that character feeds. This is sort of a first draft, so please tell me if the power seems like it\\'s balanced or not.",
