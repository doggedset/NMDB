The end result looks somewhat antique if you ask me.\r\n\r\nThe blade is named \\\"Negotiator of Talos\\\" and can be found at the shrine of Talos in the White River Valley (the same shrine that is involved in one of Elisif\\'s quests)\r\n\r\n\r\n+++++++\r\nCredits\r\n+++++++\r\nI created the texture from an artwork of the negotiator I found on several places on the web; Unfortunately the real author of the artwork is unknown to me :/",
