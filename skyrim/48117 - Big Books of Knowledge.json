A user requested a remake of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2770/?]this[/url] heavily outdated mod, and I have always hated how the [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Catalogue_of_Weapon_Enchantments]Catalogue of Weapon Enchantments[/url] did not really list the enchantments available and what you could apply them to, as you would kind of expect. And I also like to collect cookbooks. So, here we are.\r<br />\r<br />The books are in a knapsack near [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Steamcrag_Camp]Steamcrag Camp[/url]. What happened to the author? It may or may not matter to you - the important part is the books, isn&#39;t it? \r<br />\r<br />As in the original mod, I added four separate books with all alchemy effects from the base game, and the ingredients that you can use for them, and a compilation of the four books in one. The enchantment book is just one, and it indicates the enchantments from the base game you can apply to all apparel pieces and weapons. And, last but not least, the cooking book adds the, you guessed it, cooking recipes. There are four revisions included; one for the base game alone, base game and Hearthfire, base game and Dragonborn, and base game plus Hearthfire and Dragonborn.\r<br />\r<br />Since these are just books, although it contains info about them, the mod itself requires no DLC. \r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
