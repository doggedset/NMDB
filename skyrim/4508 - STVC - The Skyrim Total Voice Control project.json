May be delayed if the CK is actually released on time, coz then this place will be empty!\r\n................................\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n...it\\'s just something I did for myself that I thought might be worth sharing ;)\r\n\r\nI\\'m not a coder or an artist or any other kind of genius, I\\'m just an \\'umble industrial engineer, I suppose that maybe qualifies me to work out how to get things to do things that their creators didn\\'t actually envision them doing when they created them ;)\r\n\r\n(I\\'ve been doing THAT for decades ITRW, btw)\r\n\r\nThe ONLY credit I deserve is in bringing other peoples\\' work together in one place, with a novel slant. I URGE you to endorse their work long before you praise my meagre contribution.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDOWNLOAD STVC_1.3.0.266_FULL CONTAINS:\r\n\r\n- Detailed, player-friendly step-by-step configuration instructions including links to \\'YouTube\\' demos & how-to clips.\r\n\r\n- Authorised 30-day full-feature trial version of VAC 2.6.6\r\n\r\n- 3 Pre-configured .xml VAC profiles.\r\n\r\n- Printer-friendly key/command crib sheets.\r\n\r\nDOWNLOAD STVC_1.3.1.266a_QuickInstal CONTAINS:\r\n\r\n- minimal documentation\r\n\r\n- Script Dragon, SuitSwitch & ShoutHotKeys files (with permission of authors)\r\n\r\n- VAC .xml profile & cribsheet for the \\'alt1\\' shouting method\r\n\r\n- custom .ini for shouthotkeys\r\n\r\n- VAC 2.6.6 instalation file in case you haven\\'t upgraded yet!\r\n\r\n- Special half-price offer details for VAC Registration.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWARNINGS: (VERY IMPORTANT!)\r\n\r\n1) Everything included & written about this project is geared towards a LEGAL & ENGLISH \\\"PC/Windows version\\\" of the Skyrim program, updated to the current limit (1.3.10 at present) - DO NOT EVEN ASK about any version of Skyrim which doesn\\'t conform to this standard. (I can cast \\'very-painful-lingering-horrible-death-WITHOUT-ANY-HOPE-OF-RESISTANCE\\' on ANYONE who even tries to \\\"pake the tiss\\\" over this -  NO SH!T.) Also, it is written for people using the game with a keyboard & mouse. I\\'ve never used a \\'360 controller\\' so I can\\'t advise on one, can I?\r\n\r\n-Let\\'s just say that this project is written for \\'grown-ups\\' ;)\r\n\r\n2) This project is dependent upon, and committed to, an application called VAC - Voice Activated Commands - by Shift_E.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that there are a lot of you out there who want \\'everything for nothing\\' or you\\'re not interested. Fair enough, it\\'s your money.\r\n\r\nBut I ask you all to consider this-\r\n\r\nVAC is not Skyrim-specific, it can control ANY keyboard-driven game or application on your PC. It was written in 2008 by a fellow-gamer who is still devoted to it\\'s development & support. There are 20 pre-made profiles available for modern classics like CoD, ArmA & Wolfenstein. It is powerful, flexible & easy to use once you\\'ll spent a little time with it.\r\n\r\n\\'Lifetime support\\' is just USD 18/Euros 13.48/GBP 11.54 by PayPal \r\n(Exchange rates may change!)\r\n\r\nI happily bought it after just 6 days of my 30-day full-feature trial. I\\'m looking forward to using it with \\\"FarCry3\\\", when it\\'s finally released, too.\r\n\r\nAt the invitation of the author, I\\'ve also just accepted the offer to \\'help out\\' on the VAC support forum. \r\n\r\nNO, I\\'m not getting any \\'kickbacks\\'!\r\n\r\nAFAIK there are currently NO freeware apps available with the features of VAC. There are a few which cost 4, 6, 8 times what VAC does though.\r\n\r\n \r\n3) This ain\\'t no \\'ego thang\\', I\\'d just like to share what I\\'ve done FOR MYSELF with everyone else who\\'d like to try do the same for themselves. I\\'m no \\'expert\\' (- definition of an expert - an \\'ex\\' is a has-been & a \\'spurt\\' is a drip under pressure!) but I\\'m willing to spend SOME valuable playing-time with those people who need a little help in understanding \\'what needs to be done\\' in order to get this thing 100% working on their rig.\r\n\r\n4) - READ THE F*****G MANUALS GUYS, FFS!",
