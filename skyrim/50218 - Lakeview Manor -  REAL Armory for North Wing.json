  "modName": "Lakeview Manor -  REAL Armory for North Wing",
  "summary": "Adds a Armory to the North Wing of Lakeview Manor that is a REAL armory and not a joke like the original one.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Because the Armorys at Hearthfire Houses were such a great disappointement, I decided to make a completely new Armory for in my opinion the worst Wing at the Hearthfire Manor, the North Wing.\r<br />This ONLY works for Lakeview Manor, the other two houses stay untouched.\r<br />If you wanna have my armory just Install it with NMM or drag the File into your Data folder.\r<br />You have to do that best before building your North Wing.\r<br />The other option is to Build your Trophy room but dont fill it with furniture. \r<br />Keep it completely empty because my Mod will add all weapon Racks and Mannequins into it.\r<br />If you have already build furniture in the Trophy room it will collide with my furniture and thats something you don&#39;t want to ;D\r<br />All weapon racks and mannequins will come without weapons and armor.\r<br />In my screens I just filled them up to show you how it can maybe look like and that it works ;D\r<br />So what you wanna do to use this mod:\r<br />\r<br />1. Install the Mod\r<br />2. Build your Lakeview Manor NORTH WING TROPHY ROOM (storage and alchemy room wont work)\r<br />3. Remove the Workbench from NORTH WING\r<br />4. Enjoy ;D\r<br />\r<br />(Step 1 and 2  can like I said be swapped but your Trophy room has to be EMPTY)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALL:\r<br />\r<br />Simply remove all items you got in there and remove the Mod with NMM or delete the Folder\r<br />\r<br />but \r<br />\r<br />you will have a empty Trophy room so you cant change the North Wing to another wing type.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Misc:\r<br />\r<br />I am actually using RealVision ENB and I made the screens with that ENB so if you are using any ENB take the Main Version of my Mod.\r<br />For all Non-ENB Users you should try out the Vanilla_Lights Version.\r<br />That should better match to Vanilla Skyrim Light Levels.",
