  "summary": "Simply adds a few vanilla ice floes and rock piles to the shores and into the water in the northern region of Winterhold, so that you can travel to places like the Serpent Stone dry-shod.

  "descriptionHtml": "[color=orange][b]Mod Name:[/b] Ice Floes - Travel the Polar Sea Dry-Shod\r\n[b]Version:[/b] 1.0\r\n[b]Author:[/b] TheWinterhawk\r\n[b]Function:[/b] Simply adds a few vanilla ice floes and rock piles to the shores and into the water in the northern region of Winterhold.\r\n[b]Extra:[/b] Lore-friendly, suitable for role playing[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Description:[/b][/color]\r\nThis is a very simple little mod, useful for those who think it\\'s ridiculous to swim in half frozen water, while wearing a full armor set. Even if you only wore robes... honestly... how long would it take to paralyze you and freeze you to death? @_@\r\n\r\nWere you ever bothered about the fact that you had to SWIM to certain areas (like Serpent Stone, etc.) and found it immersion breaking to have to jump into the ice cold water? Have you maybe (like me -.-) spent hours to find a way around it, but with no success?\r\n\r\nWell, if any of the previous mentioned used to be your little Dovahkiin problems, then this mod may be for you. ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Important:[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nThis mod was created and tested with \\\"SLIGHTLY higher jump\\\" mod activated. It MIGHT happen, that some distances are a bit too long for vanilla jump (however, might be a bit harder to travel dry-shod without such a mod)!!!\r\n\r\nAnd you WILL get slightly wet feet here and there, even with a decently higher jump, but it definitely should be ok. You won\\'t die of severe pleuropneumonia. Make a nice little fire when you reach mainland to dry your shoes and you should be fine. ;)\r\n\r\n[b]Warning:[/b] Never try to make a fire on ice floes though! :p\r\n\r\n\r\n#########################################\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Areas, that have been tested include:[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n- Tel Vos Wreckage\r\n- Serpent Stone\r\n- Yngvild\r\n- Septimus Outpost\r\n- Winter War Wreckage\r\n- Yngol Barrow\r\n\r\nYou still may need to spend some time to find your way through the ice, but I made it quite easy for you to get to all the places mentioned above. Once you found the right passage you will definitely see, that it\\'s safe to travel there. To get dry-shod to the Serpent Stone travel via the Wreckage of Tel Vos.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]In-/Deinstallation:[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nTo install download, extract and put the icefloes.esp into your skyrim Data folder. That\\'s it, plain and simple.\r\n\r\nTo deinstall, simply remove the icefloes.esp from your skyrim Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Compatibility:[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nIt\\'s quite unlikely that this mod gives you trouble, because this is only a very small and simple mod, that adds a dozen of vanilla ice floes and rock piles into the areas around the above mentioned locations. If you use mods, that change these areas, you MIGHT get a conflict. The last mod in the load order wins, however. So place your icefloes.esp where it has a chance to support you. ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]No vanilla objects were deleted or moved![/b][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n#########################################\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy my mod, maybe Chesko\\'s Frostfall Mod is something for you, too?\r\n[url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163\\\"]Frostfall - Hypothermia Camping Survival[/url]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163\r\n\r\n#########################################\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading my mod.
