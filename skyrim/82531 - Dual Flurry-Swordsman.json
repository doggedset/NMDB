  "summary": "Very simple.  Dual flurry (rank 1) now increases one handed speed by 20% when not using a spell or shield in left hand.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve been looking everywhere for a mod that simply allows dual flurry to apply when not utilizing your left hand.  Couldn&#39;t find it, SO I MADE IT MYSELF.  Now, with the first rank of dual flurry, when wielding a one handed weapon by itself, you gain a 20% swing speed boost.  Sword and shield combo and spell and sword combos do not benefit, Because i figured there needs to be some sort of balance, and should be some advantage to using a sword by itself.  Now you can be like Brad Pitt in the opening scene of Troy and totally PWN big slow swole dudes with your lightning speed one-handedness.  YOU&#39;RE WELCOME.",
