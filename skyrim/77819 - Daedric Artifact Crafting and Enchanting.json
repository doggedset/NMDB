  "descriptionHtml": "So I&#39;m sure someone has already done this out there somewhere, but on the odd chance that they haven&#39;t, this mod will let you disenchant Daedric artifacts (after earning them in the appropriate quests) and craft unenchanted versions of them once you learn Daedric smithing. I didn&#39;t bother adding in Hircine&#39;s ring or any of the staves to the list, because an unenchanted version of those doesn&#39;t really buy you anything and, really, if you want the enchantment just use the one you earn from the quest. The main purpose of this was to be able to craft daedric artifacts that can use the cool enchantments you&#39;ve earned from the quest without being totally useless once you learn how to craft more powerful weapons/enchantments (also gives you the opportunity to mix enchantments with double enchanting). Let me know if you have any issues, as this is the first mod I&#39;ve uploaded, and half the reason I made it was to test out the uploading system. Feel free to download this, edit it, and use it for your own mods if you want.",
