  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Description[/b]\r\n\r\nThis is a rather simple fix to a longknown bug.\r\nThanks to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=98083]Wubbledee[/url] for pointing me in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThere is an event, where some reamins of a dragon attack are meant to spawn. Including a carriage, a surviving dog and a dead dragon.\r\nHowever in vanilla, this dragon spawns sometimes alive and somehow seeming disoriented. I think this is casued by the fact, that the quests uses\r\na normal dragon, which has his scripts which prevent him from spawning dead. This results in a dragon who flies around and attacks stuff and then\r\nhe suddenly dies as soon as he touches the ground.\r\n\r\nAll i did was making a copy of one of the existing vanilla NoScript-dragons, removed the actorbase, removed the AI-Packages and assignet him to the quest.\r\nThis should make him spawn dead as he should.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this is a very rare event to happen at all, and possibly the dragon sometimes spawns dead as it should, it\\'ll be pretty hard to tell if this fix actualy works.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, i decided to give him a name to make him unique and recognizeable. In the current beta-version he\\'ll be called \\\"Crashtest-Dummy\\\".\r\n\r\nAt this point, i have severall request:\r\n\r\n1. Please report every \\\"Crashtest-Dummy\\\" you spot flying around in the air.\r\n2. Please report every dragon who dies on touchdown and is not called \\\"Crashtest-Dummy\\\".\r\n3. Please report if you find dead Crashtest-Dummys lying around dead as they should be.\r\n4. If anyone knows a way how to force an event to happen via the console, this would be most welcome!\r\n\r\n5. Please tell me how to translate \\\"Dragon\\\" to your native language.\r\nFor now i got:\r\nDragon - English\r\nDragon - FranÃ§ais\r\nDrachen - Deutsch\r\nDrago - Italian\r\n\r\n\r\n-> When i get enough of this informations, i\\'ll upload a final version of this mod, hopefully providing esp\\'s for\r\na lot of localisations, where \\\"Crashtest-Dummy\\\" is called \\\"Dragon\\\" again.\r\n\r\n\r\nShouldn\\'t interfere with anything.",
