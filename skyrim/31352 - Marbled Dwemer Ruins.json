  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/7149/dwemer.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=7][b]Marbled Dwemer Ruins[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a complete Dwemer texture overhaul that I made just to suit my own tastes in Skyrim. I made this as a companion mod for my other main mod, [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31237/]\\\"Marbled Markarth\\\"[/url]  If you haven\\'t downloaded that one yet, you absolutely MUST!\r\n\r\nNow, before you ask any questions, let me answer a few:\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]This isn\\'t lore friendly.  Everything looks shiny and new.  Where did all the marble come from?[/size][/b]\r\nI did not intend to make this lore friendly, nor do I care where the marbled rocks came from.  Perhaps it was imported from Cyrodil?  Either way, this is made for aesthetic reasons only.  No lore was considered, nor shall be considered.\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]Does this affect all Dwemer ruins?[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nYes, this does have an affect on all Dwemer Ruins(Interior and exterior) as well as all Markarth interiors.  To change Markarth\\'s exterior textures, make sure to download, [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31237/]\\\"Marbled Markarth\\\"[/url]\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]Will this affect my performance?[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nI have tried to make this as performance friendly as possible, by making the textures a generic, standard size.  However, it is possible that you will have slightly lower FPS.  Depends on your machine, and what colors it can process well.  \r\n\r\n[b][size=5]Why is this so sloppy??[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nBecause this entire project started out as an experiment, and ended the same way...as an experiment.  Sure, it\\'s not the fanciest texture mod out there, but it accomplishes a basic task, and I personally like it.\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]My ENB makes this too bright!![/size][/b]\r\nLike many of my texture overhauls, I try to make it look good for vanilla Skyrim.  If you are using a bright ENB, some of the brighter textures are not going to look right.  Also, there are some ENBs that make some textures look purple\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]What are the rock textures used behind the structures?[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nYou can find them in my other mod, [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29745]Natural Fantasy Textures\\\"[/url]  ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to ask.  Just bear in mind that I made these for my own personal tastes, and I don\\'t plan on changing them.  You are free to modify them or change up the colors however you like, if you so choose.  Just make sure to credit me for the original.  :)\r\n\r\nAlso, feel free to try out my other texture mods.  I really appreciate it!!!\r\n\r\n[b][size=7]Companion Mod For:[/size][/b]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31237/][img]http://img577.imageshack.us/img577/9227/whitemarbletexture01byg.jpg[/img][/url]",
