  "descriptionHtml": "OK, I completely forgot I actually uploaded this preset here and never actually published it. Like... Nine months ago. My screenshooting skills have improved a bit, but whatever. Preset is the same, I guess.\r<br />\r<br />Connor is a preset tweaked from my old [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69777/?]Gwilym preset[/url].\r<br />Some similarities, but lots of differences. Think of him as a younger brother or cousin, perhaps&#33; \r<br />I have used him for months and made several variants and taken lots of pics with various ENBs, so I include two presets to represent the pics I&#39;ve taken. \r<br />The hair/beards/eyes on pics might be somewhat different than the presets, but I&#39;m sure you can manage to find the one you prefer. Note that expressions and ENBs also change the appearence. \r<br />\r<br />You will need:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]Racemenu[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27815/?]Fine Face Textures for Men by Urshi[/url] (Seriously. He will look like a potato without it&#33;)\r<br />Or I guess you could just use his face as a base and make him to your own liking... Yeah, you could try that&#33; Go for it&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Recommended:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?]KS Hairdos[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28363/?]Beards[/url]\r<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50307/?]True Brows[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?]The Eyes of Beauty[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31665/?]Better Makeup for SKSE[/url] (male version)  You CAN skip if you plan on removing it or you somehow enjoy ultra pixlated vanilla textures.\r<br />SAM body (Google for it)\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t want to use the Fine Face textures for ALL your Skyrim males, you can use this preset for the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35474/?]Ningheim Race[/url].\r<br />I have used all my male Nord presets for male Ningheims and have never noticed any major problems. ",
