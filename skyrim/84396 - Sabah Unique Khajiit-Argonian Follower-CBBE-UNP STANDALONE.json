  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#6d9eeb][size=4]Hence...after making oddball Skyrim characters and half breeds I get a PM with a request for a Khajiit / Argonian character. So...She was born....\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]Vasha a known thief and murderer quotes “&#34;Ahhh... Vasha, at your service. Obtainer of goods, taker of lives, and defiler of daughters” (Skyrim) before his death by the Dragonborn sought out by Astrid. Before the Dragonborn arrives at the Abandoned Shack he pleads with Astrid to spare his wife Shahvee (a known local from the docks of Windhelm) and his daughter Sabah’s lives. Astrid hesitates but agrees and keeps her word. Years prior when Shahvee was five months pregnant she was caught in the crossfire in a tavern fight at the Bee & Barb between two local bandits using spells. Luckily she lived and was able to carry Sabah in her womb until born. That is when she and Vasha knew they had a child of a different race and as the child grew in age her height didn’t. Sabah’s childhood wasn’t a pleasant one as she was sheltered from the world until her father was murdered, she ran away from her mother and vowed to kill whoever was responsible. Fending off the land and doing whatever to survive Sabah became addicted to Skooma and resides at Dead Man’s Drink in Falkreath still asking the locals for information about her father’s murder and fate will only tell if she is ever face to face with her father’s killer. Questions are many, will the Dragonborn tell her the truth, or keep it hidden?\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: A first test run video is available on the VIDEO tab.\r<br />\r<br />STATS &gt;NON-Essential, Marriageable \r<br />Height: .080, Weight: .050\r<br />Health Magicka and Stamina: 500\r<br />Skill Bonus’s: Sneak, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Alchemy, One-handed, and Archery: 100\r<br />Specials: Power Khajiit Night Eye\r<br />Speed: 160\r<br />INSTALLATION: Install using NMM or manual to your preferences.\r<br />INVENTORY: Enchanted steel dagger (2), Scaled Simple Outfit.\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS & COOKIES:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#d5a6bd][size=4]Feminine Argonian Textures-UNP-CBBE\r<br />Fair Skin Complexion\r<br />Eyes Of Beauty\r<br />XP32 Maximum Skeleton Extended\r<br />HDT Physics Extensions \r<br />Creation Kit (Despite crashing numerous times)\r<br />Skyrim\r<br />NMM\r<br />And all the crap I use in making these oddball characters\r<br />   [/size][/color]",
