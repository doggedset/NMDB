  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is a remake/overhaul of the Lakeview Manor Road - Hearthfire mod (nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27377/) originally created by themadpickler (aka tkm_madness) in 2012. Assets incorporated and edited from the original mod, as well as the upload of this overhaul mod, were done with the expressed permission of themadpickler.\r<br />\r<br />Three separate versions are provided:\r<br />\r<br /> 1) ver1.01 adds a road from Lakeview Manor down to the lake\r<br /> 2) ver1.02 adds the road as in ver1.01 and removes the nearby altar and WarlockConjurer, replacing them with a campfire and seating area\r<br />3) ver1.03 adds the road as in ver1.01 and removes the nearby altar and WarlockConjurer (no campfire site)\r<br />     Please note that only one of the three versions can be activated and used at any one time.\r<br />\r<br />My goal was to improve upon the original roadway and to remove the deleted navmesh, the itm&#39;s, and udr&#39;s that were problematic in the original mod. I loved many aspects of the original mod, especially the gateway down by the lake; however, I never used it in my game due to the problems in the mod others reported upon its inspection. The desire to have a road as initially conceived in the original Lakeview Manor Road mod motivated me to undertake this remake.\r<br />\r<br /> The road was nearly totally redone (only three of the original roadchunks remain, and these were all repositioned to remove clipping issues). Care was taken to have uniform alignment of the cobble stones and for the roadchunks to blend in better with the surrounding landscape. Some additional plants were added along the road. The stone walls were realigned to better match the overall direction of the road. The logs to one side of the road have been repositioned to more closely resemble the vanilla game (and the clipping into the rock by the middle log fixed).\r<br />\r<br />The versions that remove the altar were totally remade. Nothing was deleted as in the original mod and objects that no longer appear have been initially disabled and moved. In ver1.02, a path was navmeshed between the seating area and campfire so your follower will navigate this part of the campfire site with ease. Some of the object near the altar were retained in ver1.02 but you may have to hunt around for them a bit. And ver1.03 was provided for those who want the altar removed but don&#39;t want the campfire and seating area. In ver1.03 some new landscape texture was added at the area where the altar once stood to make it look a bit overgrown but natural. \r<br />\r<br />All three version were cleaned with TES5Edit.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Strongly recommend you load this mod after you have made a full save somewhere far away from Lakeview Manor. Loading ver1.02 or ver1.03 using a save near Lakeview Manor may result in a savegame memory issue that can result in the WarlockConjurer reappearing (and possible the leveled sword produced from a &#34;dummy sword&#34; to appear next to the campfire in ver1.02).\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />\r<br />Requires the HearthFires DLC\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />\r<br />themadpickler - who graciously allowed me to &#34;use it (i.e., his mod) however you want&#34; and for producing such a creative concept provided in the original Lakeview Manor Road - Hearthfire mod. \r<br />\r<br />Kinaga - for some great help with TES5Edit",
