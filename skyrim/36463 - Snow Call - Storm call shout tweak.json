  "summary": "Simple tweak of the Storm Call-shout. Summons snowstorm instead of a rainstorm.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I always thought it was a break of immersion when using the Storm Call-shout in the snowy areas of Skyrim. The heavy rainfall just made it seem a little off, so I sought to change that by making it a heavy snowstorm instead. After installing this mod, when using Storm Call, it will start snowing heavily instead of the rain.\r\n\r\n[b]What this mod does [i]not[/i] do, but maybe should do:[/b]\r\nIdeally, snow or rain would depend on where in Skyrim you are when shouting. So when using Storm Call at the Throat of the World, it would summon a heavy snowstorm, but when in Falkreath, it would summon rain as the vanilla version. Alas, I do not know how to do this, or if it is possible at all (new to modding). If you want to help me out, please feel free to shoot me a message. I would love to see it happen.",
