I have also omitted the unnecessary repetition of the statement “You may only have one sign at a time” from all stones, for two reasons. The first reason is that the statement is so obvious, that it goes without saying. The second reason is because of the Aetherial Crown, (a Dawnguard addition) which you can create at the Aetherium Forge as one of three possible rewards for completing the &#39;Lost to the Ages&#39; Quest. It retains the power of your previous Standing Stone power, when you choose one, meaning that while you wear it you can have two Standing Stone powers active at the same time. With this mod, when view a Standing Stone, you will see the specific level of change to your stants, rather than the simple messages such as &#34;You heal faster.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]Qc3MLRQ4eH4[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://interrogisticmethodologies.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/quote-divider1.png?w=917[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://interrogisticmethodologies.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/drail3-banner-smaller.jpg?w=920[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[center][b]~The &#39;Informative Series&#39; thus far~[/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39326/?]Informative Alchemy[/url][/b][/center]\r<br />[center][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52464/?]Informative Blacksmith[/url][/b][/center]\r<br />[center][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52465/?]Informative Disease[/url][/b][/center]\r<br />[center][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39397/?]Informative Training[/url][/b][/center]\r<br />[center][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52544/?]Informative Enchanter[/url][/b][/center]\r<br />[center][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39069/?]Informative Shrines[/url][/b][/center]\r<br />[center][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39093/?]Informative Standing Stones[/url][/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://interrogisticmethodologies.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/test.png?w=920[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Drail3 mods are light weight by design.
