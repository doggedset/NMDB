  "modName": "Necromancer Amulet Correctly Renamed",
  "summary": "It renames it. Correctly. Really. I swear.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Got irritated that the amulet is not only named differently than in other Elder Scrolls games, but even NPCs involved in the actual quest to obtain it (Wuunferth), and some of the attributes of the object in the creation kit, call it by it&#39;s proper title. So I went in the creation kit and renamed it from &#34;Necromancer&#34; to &#34;Necromancer[b][i][u]&#39;s[/u][/i][/b]&#34; amulet. Then I loaded an old save and re-did the quest to make sure it didn&#39;t break anything, and it didn&#39;t. I&#39;m surprised nobody ( That I could find) did this before, because it&#39;s so simple. And because of this, I am striving for no endorsements. Please do not endorse this. A monkey could have made it. That is all.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m going to go drink some rum now.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Drop the .esp file in yo&#39; Data folder. Or use the Mod Manager. Or don&#39;t. Your call.\r<br />\r<br />Edit: It has come to my attention that the Unofficial Skyrim Patch (USKP) already does this, but I&#39;m one of those particular people who doesn&#39;t use it for...reasons I&#39;m not spending the time to explain. So this little mod is here for others like me who want this fix without USKP.",
