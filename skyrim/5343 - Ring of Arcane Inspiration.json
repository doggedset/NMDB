  "descriptionHtml": "-----------\r\nUpdate\r\n-----------\r\nThe rings are all craftable at a blacksmith\\'s forge with the proper materials and perks for each.\r\n\r\nThe Ring of Arcane Focus:\r\n40 Enchanting (with 2/5 Enchanter Perk)\r\n1 gold ingot\r\n1 silver ingot\r\n1 common soul gem filled\r\n\r\nThe Ring of Arcane Force:\r\n60 Enchanting (with 3/5 Enchanter Perk)\r\n1 gold ingot\r\n1 silver ingot\r\n1 quicksilver ingot\r\n1 greater soul gem filled\r\n\r\nThe Ring of Arcane Inspiration:\r\n80 Enchanting (with 4/5 Enchanter Perk)\r\nArcane Blacksmith\r\n1 gold ingot\r\n1 silver ingot\r\n1 quicksilver ingot\r\n1 grand soul gem filled\r\n\r\nIf you do not want to get the requirements or materials to craft these rings, you may use the console and type:\r\nhelp \\\"ring of arcane\\\" then hit enter.\r\nThis will bring up the item IDs for all three rings. Decide which ring you want then use the following console command to add it to your game.\r\nplayer.additem xxxxxxx y, where xxxxxxx is the ID code you chose and y is the amount of the item you want. If you want one of the ring you would type: player.additem xxxxxxx 1\r\n----------------------\r\nOld Information\r\n----------------------\r\nThis file has been updated to version 1.1. For anyone experiencing the feed bug on the original file. Please download the newest version. The new version also comes with lesser versions of the same original enchantment. Thank you for downloading!\r\n\r\nI made this ring for people who are tired of always carrying around restore magic potions and who like to play with magic. It allows all spells to be free of charge. In the future I am planning on making it available via quest or vendor but I am limited by my knowledge of modding at the moment. Players can add three different versions of the ring with three different console commands. Each rings is all in the same .esp so you don\\'t have to download multiple files for convenience. \r\n---------------\r\nInstallation\r\n---------------\r\nJust extract the .esp file into your Skyrim Data folder. \r\n\r\nWhen in game, to add the rings in game simply open the console with the ~ button and type:\r\n\r\n\\\"player.additem 000ca1da 1\\\" for The Ring of Arcane Focus (25% spell cost reduction)\r\n\\\"player.additem 000ca1db 1\\\" for The Ring of Arcane Force (50% spell cost reduction)\r\n\\\"player.additem 000ca1dc 1\\\" for The Ring of Arcane Inspiration (100% spell cost reduction)\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\nUninstallation\r\n-------------------\r\nUnequip the rings in game and then remove the .esp file from your Skyrim Data folder. \r\nIf the file is removed without unequipping the rings, the character will permanently have 0/50/75 reduction in all spell costs respectively.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the rings and the power they offer. Feel free to post and suggestions, concerns, or comments.",
