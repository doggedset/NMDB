The more important question is: who wants to go around collecting goat horns or quarried stone & who wants to go crafting annoyances like hinges & locks?\r<br />\r<br />Those of you that do enjoy doing so may jog on.\r<br />\r<br />Quite simply put: all furnitures/furnishings (aside from trophies) have no requirements. Now you may completely build your house without worrying about quarried stones... and goat horns.",
