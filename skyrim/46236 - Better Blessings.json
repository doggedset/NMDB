  "summary": "Significantly buffs the effects of all the in-game blessings, and adds a custom blessing made my me, called \"Puff's Blessing\".",
  "descriptionHtml": "In this mod, I aimed to make the blessing system much more useful and rewarding. For the most part, I've tripled the effectiveness of all the blessings, making them much more useful, except for the Fortify Health/Magicka/Stamina ones, which now give you a 100 point boost instead of the crappy 10 point boost. In addition, I added a \"Shrine of Puff\" so that you can get \"Puff's Blessing\". The only thing I'll say about that one is that I hid it somewhere in Dragonsreach. Have fun looking for it!",
