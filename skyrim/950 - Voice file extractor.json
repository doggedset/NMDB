  "descriptionHtml": "The Fuz-Extractor is a little tool to extract the audio-part (xWMA) and the lipsynch-part (LIP) of a .FUZ file (in \\\"Skyrim - Voices.bsa\\\").\r\n\r\nIt can be used to extract the audio file:\r\ne.g.:\r\nfuz_extractor -e <fuz-file>\r\nfuz_extractor -e mqsovngardeconv2__000f1c7b_1.fuz\r\n\r\nFuz-Exctractor is also capable of creating a completly new FUZ-File out of a given lip- and xwm-file.\r\nfuz_extractor -c <fuz-file> <xwm-file> <lip-file>\r\n\r\nFuz-Extractor can be used to insert a audio-file (xwm) in the given fuz-file. The orignal audio-part is overwritten.\r\ne.g.:\r\nfuz_extractor -c <fuz-file> <xwm-file>\r\nfuz_extractor -c mqsovngardeconv2__000f1c7b_1.fuz mqsovngardeconv2__000f1c7b_1_new.xwm\r\n\r\nThe other case is also possible: You can insert a new lip-file in the given fuz-file. The orignal lipsync-part is overwritten.\r\ne.g.:\r\nfuz_extractor -c <fuz-file> <lip-file>\r\nfuz_extractor -c mqsovngardeconv2__000f1c7b_1.fuz mqsovngardeconv2__000f1c7b_1_new.lip\r\n\r\nIn this case, both files have to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extracted audio-file (xwm) is in xWMA-format and you may use the command-line tool \\\"xWMAEncode\\\" to decode it to WAVE. (and then use the file as you please). That tool may be used to covert a WAVE (with some restrictions) to xWMA.\r\n\t- xWMAEncode is part of the DirectX SDK: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=3035\r\n\t- Usage of xWMAEncode http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee415930.aspx\r\n\t- More Info on xWMA: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee415832.aspx\r\n\r\nThe extracted lip-file has the same format as in oblivion (maybe other bethesda games too). So you could possibly generate a lip file using the construction set of oblivion and pack it and the audio-file (after conversion) to a new fuz-file.\r\n\r\nI tested the insertion with audio-files that were longer and shorter than the original audio-part. Both cases worked for me, the text of the dialog was shown as long as the audio-file played. If you insert a audio-file that doesn\\'t match the original text (and speech tempo) the lip-movments and shown text won\\'t match yput file. You are just replacing what sound is played. \r\n\r\nIf you find a bug please tell me. \r\nagnahim12345 hates-spam @ yahoo.de\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to TillEulenspiegel for the Hint (http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forums/showthread.php?1876-Shall-we-talk-about-Skyrim&p=57691&viewfull=1#post57691)\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0\r\nCreated by Agnahim (2011)",
