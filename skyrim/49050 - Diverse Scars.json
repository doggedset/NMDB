  "descriptionHtml": "I have made in Photoshop an extra 40+ set of new scar shapes that you all may like. \r<br />\r<br />You don&#39;t have to have the Race Menu mod for this. I already have that mod when I made screenshots so don&#39;t worry about that. \r<br /> \r<br />I even included the left side and right side of the face. There are up to 115 combination of new scars at the Character Creation menu for male and females. I have included a Skyrim symbol that is made like someone had taken a branding iron with the symbol to burn into the face. \r<br />\r<br />These scars are for humans and elves. Here soon I will upload some more for the beasts. \r<br />\r<br />Right now I&#39;m brainstorming on more scar art. \r<br />\r<br />UPDATE: 12/23/2013 - New optional file has been uploaded. No more shiny textures. Textures match skin now. \r<br />\r<br />UPDATE: 12/31/2013- I have now included ritual scars, joker smile, and cracked scars the ones you see from Darth Scion Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic Sith Lords.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE: 12/31/2013- I also changed the name to Diverse Scars for the new scars to be different from each other.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to make these into high definition go ahead. \r<br />\r<br />If you have any suggestions for new scars let me know. \r<br />\r<br />Coming soon: Blood scars and more stitches. \r<br />\r<br />To install just use the Nexus Mod Manager. \r<br />\r<br />Credits: Bethesda Softworks \r<br />\r<br />Thank you Bethesda for creating an awesome game and providing the beautiful ability to allow us to mod your games.
