  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#6d9eeb]This patch Reqtifies the 'Skykids' mod, from our favourite adult modding site. Although Skykids is not adult in nature, it is a child overhaul that is not available on the nexus, you'll have to go to said site to get the mod. This mod Rebalances the Playable Children and vampire Variants, as the rest of the mod is mostly just a visual replacer for NPCs that can be visual merged in the Reqtificator.ini.\n<br />\n<br />Requirements:\n<br />Skykids\n<br />Requiem\n<br />\n<br />This patch was designed in mind for Requiem 2.0, but it should be fine for 1.9.4, since 2.0 didn't really adjust races. Put this somewhere below the Requiem.esp, and you should add the NPC replacers to Reqtificator.ini if you use them. \n<br />\n<br />Edit: you do not need the SK Playable Kids.esp since I copied race records, so this will enable them as playable. Just take it as i'm still a TES5EDIT noob. \n<br />\n<br />I will only accept constructive feedback, and will only answer comments pertaining to bugs or issues. \n<br />\n<br />[/color]",
