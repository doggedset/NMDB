  "descriptionHtml": "None of the Conan swords I\\'ve seen looked anything like the one in the movie!\r\nSo this is my take on them.\r\n\r\nTHIS FIRST MOD IS NOT COKLA\\\"S CONAN SWORD!\r\nATLANTEAN SWORD NOTES AND REQUIREMENTS!\r\n\r\nIn order for this mod to work you must have utilizer\\'s Atlantean mod! If you want the mod just head to Bethesda\\'s forum and search for \\\"Atlantean\\\" you will find it in the skyrim mods subforum.\r\n\r\nAfter you get the mod you will need to have all of the things below!\r\n\r\n1. Smithing 100 \r\n2. All smithing perks! \r\n3. Do the intro quest to join the Companions! You must test your arm and take a sword to have it sharpened. \r\n4. It can only be made at the skyforge after all the above requirements are done. \r\n5. Get the materials required to forge the Atlantean sword! \r\n6. Get the materials required to sharpen your new blade because if it\\'s not Legendary it\\'s not Finished! Well at least I think so :P\r\n\r\nINSTALL:\r\n Just replace the two files in your data/textures/atlantean folder!\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to utilizer for making this mod available.\r\nThanks to Waalx.\r\n\r\n=============================================================================\r\nCOKLA\\\"S CONANSWORDS\r\nFATHER SWORD AND ATLANTEAN SWORD NOTES AND REQUIREMENTS!\r\n\r\nFathers Sword\r\nv1.1 Fixed the eyes on the handle so they are blacked out completely.\r\nAtlantean Sword\r\nv1.1 I wish I could get it to look more like the original sword but this is what I put together with what I had to work with.\r\n\r\nYou must have Cokla\\'s Conan swords mod found here http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4217\r\n\r\nYou must then install the above mod. Once that is done you can replace the FatherSword.dds and FatherSword_n.dds files that are located in your data/textures/weapons/ConanSwords folder!\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to Cokla and Mr. Dave\\'s hard work in providing us with some good stuff!\r\n\r\nPlease note I will not be doing the 1h version of the Atlantean sword from Mr. Dave\\'s Meshes as the Mesh doesn\\'t look close enough to the original blade. But if some one want\\'s to take Utlizers mod and create a 1h version it should work just fine as long as you are using the same mesh and textures.",
