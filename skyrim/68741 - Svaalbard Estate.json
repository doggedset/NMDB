  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][b]Svaalbard Estate[/b][/size]\r<br />[b]A modest playerhome fit for one proud of Whiterun Hold.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/eixNjSW.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />[u][b]Description[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />Svaalbard Estate is a modest, medium sized player home located in the town of Rorikstead. No cheat items or fancy noble furniture. I focused a lot on detail and design, spending over 30 hours on just this house mod&#33; Most of that time was relearning/learning how to use the CreationKit again, thanks to Darkfox127, Wheeze, and folks at TESAlliance.\r<br />\r<br />The estate features a smithy (forge, grinding stone, and workbench), enchanting desk, alchemy lab, cooking pot, wood chopping block and tanning rack. There are a few custom storage containers, but most of the items/containers you see are static (meaning that you can&#39;t pick them up). A few of the items are nonstatic - but they aren&#39;t havok enabled, so they shouldn&#39;t move around. Mainly I wanted to learn the Creation Kit again after not using it for a few years, and also to build a home I wanted to use for a long playthrough.\r<br />\r<br />I built this player home for my character who I&#39;m playing as a lord/noble of Whiterun Hold, with an estate in Rorikstead. My character is also playing as battle mage (hence the lots of books around the home) and he is dedicated to the Stormcloak rebellion. Usually I&#39;m an imperial loyalist throughout all the elder scrolls games, but after 500 hours of Skyrim I have yet to do the Stormcloak questline&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Cleaned with TES5Edit. Edits the worldspace a bit north/northeast of Rorikstead.\r<br />\r<br />You can watch the following Skyrim Real Estate video to get a tour of the mod. The first few minutes is a tour, the other last 3 minutes is just some commentary and stuff.\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]aNU0iZXHi6U[/youtube][/center] \r<br />[center][youtube]U0HBhgAl5lc[/youtube][/center]\r<br />[center]Thanks [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/hodilton]Hodilton[/url] for the video&#33;[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=4]\r<br />[b]Features:[/b][/size][/u]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]highly detailed interior\r<br />[*]proud home of the Whiterun Hold, also Stormcloak-ish themed\r<br />[*]all essential crafting stations (enchanting desk, alchemy lab, smithy, workbench, grindstone, tanning rack, cooking pot, woodchopping block)\r<br />[*]navmeshed interior\r<br />[*]all 10 shrines\r<br />[*]two weapon racks\r<br />[*]several named, safe, non-respawning custom containers\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Library\r<br />[*]Main &#34;Loot&#34; Chest, by the front door\r<br />[*]Enchanting Storage\r<br />[*]Alchemy Storage\r<br />[*]Blacksmithing Items Chest\r<br />[*]Wardrobe\r<br />[/list][/list]\r<br />\r<br />Please report any bugs you see&#33; I&#39;ll try to fix them ASAP. Best way to contact me is via Nexus Messager after a few months of this release.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Requirements:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />Have Skyrim updated to the latest version. Svaalbard Estate doesn&#39;t require Hearthfire, Dawnguard, Dragonborn or any other 3rd party mod.\r<br />[u][size=4]\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b][/size][/u]\r<br />Mod Manager (NMM or MO)\r<br />Use your favorite mod manager to make installation easy and quick. Use the install by mod manager option.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Manually:[/b]\r<br />Download and un-archive into /Skyrim/data/\r<br />The SvaalbardEstate.esp and SvaalbardEstate.bsa should be in the /data/ folder (alongside all other .esp and .esm files, such as Skyrim.esm), and you should be able to tick it in the Mod Manager program you are using, or in the Skyrim Launcher.\r<br />\r<br />Like most mods/modders/mod authors, I recommend installing with a Mod Manager program. NMM is easy to use.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Uninstallation:[/b]\r<br />Should be pretty straightforward. Make sure you got all your items out of the home and you are not near the home (or inside it) when you uninstall. Uninstall via your mod manager, or if you installed manually, delete SvaalbardEstate.esp and SvaalbardEstate.bsa.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\r<br />Not tested with any Rorikstead altering mods, like any mods that add more to Rorikstead&#39;s town area. Please give me feedback so I can maybe develop a patch for those town/village enhancing mods.\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=4][b]Credits[/b][/size][/u]\r<br />Thanks to:\r<br />- darkfox127 and his tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/user/DARKF0X127\r<br />- Wheeze and his tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/user/Mehrunes201/videos\r<br />- TESAlliance: awesome tutorial on building a home - http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/topic/6842-ck-basics-lesson-3/\r<br />- insanitySorrow: tutorial on how to use modder resources - http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/tutorials/article/99-using-modders-resources/\r<br />Â \r<br />Modder Resources used:\r<br />- Blary&#39;s Modder Resources: Open Books, Alchemy Clutter, and more - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14134/?\r<br />- Modder&#39;s Resource Pack: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/?\r<br />- Paintings and Frames Resource: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17423/?\r<br />- Lolicept Resources: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62733/?\r<br />- InsanitySorrow armour stands: http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1480-static-armour-stands/\r<br />If I forgot anyone&#39;s resources, please let me know&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=4][b]License[/b][/size][/u]\r<br />This mod is to remain Skyrim Nexus exclusive release only.
