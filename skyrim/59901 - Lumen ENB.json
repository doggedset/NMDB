However, one that stuck with me all along as a favorite was Opethfeldt ENB. It has a realism and polish that few presets have. While this had originally intended to simply be a modernization project of Opethfeldt&#39;s preset, Lumen ENB began to take on a life of its own and, while staying true to the original feel Opethfeldt&#39;s ENB has, the style had changed sufficiently that it couldn&#39;t be called just an update anymore. I consider this a sort of spiritual successor to Opethfeldt&#39;s preset and, while his initial footprint is still there, it&#39;s definitely a creature of its own.\r<br />\r<br />[center][/center][center][color=#ffff00]Nice Story, but really, why do I care?[/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=3]Features:[/size][/u]\r<br />[list][*][size=2]Full ENB Weather Support for nearly all vanilla weathers with a custom weather mod made by Opethfeldt and modified by me which allow for a very unique, bright appearance during clear days, and beautiful sunrises and sunsets that you have never before seen in Skyrim.[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]High Quality SSAO and SSIL[u][/u] with easily customizable quality options.[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Realistically dark nights and dungeons.

It&#39;s currently configured to my taste but full customization options are available via the in-game ENB GUI.[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Day and night settings for interiors make dungeons and shops look quite different from each other. Dungeons are still dark, but you can still see quite clearly in your own house&#33;[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]A visually immersive game experience. When there&#39;s a blizzard, it makes you feel cold. The sun is bright and refreshing.

ELFX, RLO or other interior lighting mods are not supported. I&#39;m sorry if you like these mods, but the preset was not built with those in mind. They should technically work, as they won&#39;t crash your game, but will not produce the same visuals and in most cases will look worse if not outright wrong.\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/oVRXPY][img]https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3940/15049371474_5a3afbf631_c.jpg[/img]\r<br />[/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/p1G4eV][img]https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7514/15104021043_09902b3058_c.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/p1G4eV][/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=3]Recommended Mods:\r<br />[/size][/color]These mods come highly recommended.

ELFX Core + ELE Interior Modules may work but this is untested and not recommended or supported.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]Support and Feedback:[/color]\r<br />[size=2]I will do my best to answer any questions you have to the best of my ability. However, before asking for help, make sure you have followed my installation instructions to the letter, you have installed the required mods, and have done your best to research the problem yourself before posting here. I truly do enjoy helping others get the most out of their gaming experience and I hope this ENB enhances that. However, I do have a life outside of this, so I can&#39;t be here 100% of the time. I also can&#39;t be expected to answer the same questions over and over so do your best to check to see if your question has been answered in the description or the comments previously. I will gladly accept constructive feedback and actually encourage it. My abilities creative energies only go so far and I can&#39;t build on that without feedback from you, the user. So, thank you in advance&#33;\r<br />\r<br />If you have more general questions regarding ENB in the broader sense, I would recommend heading over to [url=http://enbdev.com]enbdev.com[/url] where the real gurus and Boris himself lurk. For questions specific to the preset, obviously, ask me here. If you notice a bug or odd color during a particular weather or time of day (like a pure yellow sky... yeah, found that in testing once), please let me know. I will need the specific WeatherID (found at the top of the weather window in the ENB GUI) and Time it occurred in order to reproduce and fix it.\r<br />\r<br />Also, an explanation of the version number scheme. \r<br />As of writing we are at 1.0.264. The first number (1) signifies what major version of the preset we&#39;re at. This won&#39;t change much. The second number (0) signifies minor changes, such as when DLC weathers are added or values adjusted. The final number (264) indicates what ENB binary is currently being used and officially supported by me for this preset.\r<br />\r<br />And please, add your screenshots&#33; :)\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=3][color=#ffff00]Future Plans:[/color]\r<br />[/size][size=2]Going forward I have a lot of ideas. In the short term, I&#39;ll be adding weather support for the DLC&#39;s for certain. After that I&#39;m likely to move away from using a palette for a more true HDR experience. Further in the future it&#39;s hard to say exactly what I will do and how far I&#39;ll go, but I hope to add some more advanced features to the shaders. I&#39;d like to add GUI support for the Depth of Field, more dynamic lens effects... a lot of ideas. We&#39;ll see how far I get.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/center][color=#ffff00][size=3]\r<br />[/size][/color][size=3]Credits:\r<br />[/size]These guys really made the content.
