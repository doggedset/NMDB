  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=4]A tiny, somewhat silly mod I made for myself and decided to share.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]My Dragonborn is a kleptomaniac, but she&#39;s not very good at stealth. Her heavy armor and clunky greatsword don&#39;t really help with that. All her connections and friends in high places could only get her out of trouble a limited number of times, so now she&#39;s a regular in Whiterun&#39;s dungeon. In my humble opinion the mighty Dragonborn certainly deserves better than a dark, smelly, filthy cell... shared with a corpse, at that. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]This mod completely overhauls the player-assigned prison cell in Dragonsreach dungeon, and turns it into a comfortable, warm and bright room. Since an average player spends whole 30 seconds in the prison, just enough to click on the bed and let the time pass, there aren&#39;t any extra features included. The point was to make the place look worthy of an accomplished, world-famous Dragonborn. Nothing more.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/SXFnH1H.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Quite obviously, the refurbished cell is not very immersive or realistic, probably not too lore friendly, either, but... it&#39;s fun and it&#39;s easy on the eyes, too. Plus, it gives your Dragonborn plenty to read while imprisoned. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/0w7wsFW.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]For technicalities: all markers within the cell are left intact, of course. There are no scripts attached. The blood spatter from the floor has been removed, and the bandit&#39;s corpse has been dropped into the corridor below. All added containers are marked as belonging to player, the bed will also give a well rested bonus if you decide to have your character drop by and have a nap there as a free person. Basic Skyrim is the only requirement, and the mod has been cleaned in TES5Edit. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/F7IwJOX.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Mods in the screenshots: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57350/?]e enb[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29608/?]detailed rugs and pelts[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7059/?]sexy whiterun[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8655/?]SMIM[/url].[/center]",
