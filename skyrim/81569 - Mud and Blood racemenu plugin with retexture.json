  "descriptionHtml": " \r<br />[color=#9900ff][size=5]1/18/2017 [/size][/color][color=#00ff00][size=5]Added Optional File : [/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4][size=4]This is the vanilla files in the main that are not overwriting vanilla assets for the  Forsworn armor . This will overwrite the textures that are used by  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75861/?]The Book of UUNP Iron and Steel Vol 1 and 2 Bodyslide - UNP - Sevenbase                    by [b]Gamefever[/b][/url]  and  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69562/?]Remodeled Armor for UUNP BodySlide HDT                    by [b]Gamefever - ousnius - ChronoTrigger77[/b][/url]  as an example . Panties were not textured still looks good .\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />  [color=#00ff00][size=5]Mud and Blood : [/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4][size=3]This was an idea I came up with a couple of years ago after many fails I put it on the  back burner.\r<br />I wanted to bring the dirt back to Skyrim . With all the new body textures it was lacking the dirt of vanilla . The opacity was set intentionally high in screens to show possibilities .  This took many hours to build there are seams when you go to the extremes . It was intentional with the splotchy look in areas  when opacity is set to what my intention was it looks like dirty sweat especially with a good wet look . The other part was to make it a total look and I chose the Forsworn armor by Troublemaker to complete it . So this is a new one for me this mod comes in two parts .\r<br />\r<br /> [color=rgb(0,255,0)][size=5]Part One : [/size][/color][/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4][size=3]The racemenu plugin . The face makeup five of them are done twice equaling ten  . This was intentional one is the less opaque version of the other so it looks more like a stain without being too faded in the skin . The other is the opaque version and there is a O1,2,or 3 up to 5 beside the name . Like I pointed out the less opaque version can go on full strength with out compromising the appearance of being on the skin . There are two others for the face on top of that .\r<br />                        The body come with dirt layer and three types of the blood layer Blood all ,Blood smudges , and Blood splatters . Starting with the blood it starts out bright it is up to you to fit it to your desired intensity . There are bright spots in it that was intentional pushing your color closer to blue will cut it done some changing the color changes the intensity of the bright spots . The mud it is meant to be a light layer hands feet and body match up well this way . There is some color change ability and that is what you can play with to kill the appearance of the seams on the wrist  and this helps make it so you can go more opaque . My recommendation is to put the mud layer on first then the blood .\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=5]Part Two : [/size][/color][/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4][size=3]The texture replacer . First you need [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20966/?]TroubleMakers Forsworn Armor[/url] by MrTroubleMaker . As with all texture replacers install with NMM of MO overwrite when asked  The file name will be short and sweet FSMB . The underwear wasn&#39;t recolored  personal preference  . All texture files will be included  the normal for the body part of the armor were redone . The textures were upsized to 2k in some cases it was a huge jump from 512 .\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=5]Resources : [/size][/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57329/?][u][color=#efefef]WetBumps 1 2  3  and gp[/color][/u][/url][color=#efefef]  [/color][color=#efefef]converted it to png and used parts to erase mud textures . Daz 3d brushes as well as brushes from deviant art ( anarasha ). PSPX9 and Gimp . [color=rgb(0,255,0)][size=2]Tip buy the brushes and resources  if you have to . The stuff I bought from Daz 3d had many pieces out there in the internet that are rips from their packs . Usage and distribution of their 2d assets is liberal as far as a completed project goes but releases of assets is a no no when comes to distributing them as resources .\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][/color][color=#efefef][color=rgb(0,255,0)][size=4]Credits :\r<br /> [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20966/?][u][color=#0066cc][size=4]TroubleMakers Forsworn Armor[/size][/color][/u][/url][color=#f4f4f4][size=4] by MrTroubleMaker \r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][/color][/color][/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4][size=3]                \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/263][color=#0066cc][u]Snow Leopard Forsworn Armor[/u][/color][/url]  by Rekickers  \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/932971][u][color=#0066cc]zacki[/color][/u][/url]  his is the other leopard .\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> [color=#00ff00][size=5]Special Thanks goes to OnelazyBattlemaga for testing and MrTroubllemaker  for being there when I was beating my head against the wall when the normal building wasn&#39;t going so well .
