  "descriptionHtml": "This is a bit more advanced tutorial...\r\n\r\nIt describes how to use a model of created bow (either created from scratch in 3DS or imported from elsewhere e.g. from the mods made for Oblivion), and skin it to the armature imported from original bow files. Then export the skinned mesh, and finalize it in NifSkope. And add to the game with the help of Creation Kit.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is related to all versions of 3DS, though the process which it describes has been tested on 2010 version of MAX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#ff0000][b]UPDATE:\r\nAt picture with 3DS MAX export settings in this tutorial there\\'s one option checked when it should not be - Generate Partition Strips in Skin Modifier section - it\\'s better to turn it OFF.[/b][/color]",
