  "descriptionHtml": "Tiny mod that allows 2/4/8/16/32 maximum player runes (previously 1).\r\n\r\nHad this in my other mod as a side effect but moved it out here as its own thing.  This is actually iMaxPlayerRunes which is a game setting - you might be able to just set it in the .ini file and skip the plugin.\r\n\r\nI have not tested beyond 8 and that is my recommendation, so I am not sure what the performance impact is.  Still thought some people might want to go nuts with it so included 16/32.",
