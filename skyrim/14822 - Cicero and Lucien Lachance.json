  "descriptionHtml": "Cicero and Lucien Lachance\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nBy c_striker\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#00FF00] UPDATE:[/color] I have now released a new mod, \\\"ESP - Expanded Skyrim Presets\\\", which makes these characters (along with 300+ other NPCs) available to play as presets in the character creation menu. If you\\'d prefer the preset version, which allows you to customize the character or to convert your existing character via the showracemenu console command, you can find the new mod [color=yellow] [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15963&tab=3&navtag=/modules/comments/comments_ajax.php?tid=658266|:|fid=15963] here[/color][/url].\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis file includes level one save games of precise clones of the male Imperial NPCs Cicero (of the Dark Brotherhood) and Lucien Lachance (Spectral Assassin), for those who wish to play as one of them or as a character who looks like one of them.\r\n\r\nThese player characters are exact replicas of the NPCs upon which they are based, with the exception that Lucien has been converted from spectral to human form. This conversion consisted of giving him human eyes and minor makeup. I have given him brown eyes and face tinting based on the chargen settings he had back in Oblivion. It appears Bethesda maintained as much consistency as possible regarding his face geometry. Other than those minor changes, chargen settings for both characters are the same as the vanilla NPC settings. So, particularly for Cicero, your save game player character should look exactly like your in-game NPC regardless of any mods used (unless you previously used an NPC editor to change the NPC, in which case all bets are off).\r\n\r\nEach character is saved just outside the cave after escaping Helgen Keep.\r\n\r\nIf you like my work, please feel free to check out my other mods:\r\n* \\\"Astrid and Karliah\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=50370\r\n* \\\"Diverse Female Housecarls\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=49520\r\n* \\\"Dromarash and Veezara\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=51546\r\n* \\\"Hroki and Jordis\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=50842\r\n* \\\"Lisette and Muiri\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=51033 \r\n* \\\"Val - Twin Sister of Vex\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=39781\r\n\r\n\r\nMods used in the screenshots\r\n============================\r\nEyes:\r\n* \\\"Natural Eyes\\\" by nevenbridge: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=11110 (human eyes only)\r\nHair:\r\n* \\\"Straight hair retexture\\\" by navetsea: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=13007\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation (manual)\r\n=====================\r\n1.
