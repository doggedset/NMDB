  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]Requirements: Skyrim, DawnGuard, Dragonborn, Heartfire, and the Unofficial Updates[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Frustrated trying to maintain game balance through your play through?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]This mod attempts to balance combat in a less conventional way. By changing all the statistics of the vanilla[/size]\r<br />[size=2]armor, weapons, and ammo. A simplified explanation of what this mod does is give everyone deadric armor and weapons. This mod was developed and balanced employing [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56147/?]combat evolved[/url][size=2]. If you choose to use this without [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56147/?]combat evolved[/url][size=2] or using other combat mods, your experience may be different from mine.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Credits to Bethedesa for Skyrim, and CrushBoss for [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56147/?]Combat Evolved[/url][size=2].[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]This mod is intended to increase difficulty while staying extremely light on your system. It is intended to only employ [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56147/?]Combat Evolved[/url] and\r<br />LEVELPLAYINGFIELD in terms of combat mods.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]The first LEVELPLAYINGFIELD mod affects the vanilla armors, weapons, ammo and ability to temper. The 2.0 version goes a step further and removes perks that allowed players to become too strong. I have checked and everything should be balanced using that version. If you want to decide how to balance your game then get the first. If you want me to decide how to balance your game get the second.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]If you have an armor mod you want me to make compatible with this mod, just ask via comments or message.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Now for tools to help you adjust and balance your game.\r<br />\r<br />1. Avoid Facing More than 2 enemies at once. If you must,then utilize your shouts, spells, maneuvering to ensure you maintain a\r<br />survivable footing in the fight. Also, make sure you block as many hits as you possibly can (which includes magic).\r<br />\r<br />2. Use followers and allies to protect yourself. Be aware though, your followers and allies will go down quickly if you don&#39;t help them.\r<br />\r<br />3. Max your character (OPTIONAL&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; I checked and the game still works well at low levels because NPCs level with the player). I have provided a BAT file to max your toon, (also to reset your toon and reset cells)\r<br />\r<br />use the console command and type    bat bam\r<br />then press enter, this will max your toon (be sure to go into your perks tree and choose your health, magic, stamia, and perks&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />to reset your toon  open the console and type      bat resetme\r<br />to reset all cells and reduce save file size open console and type       bat clearcells\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />4. Set difficulty to Adept which is enemy dmg multiplier=1,player dmg multiplier=1(if you up the difficulty more that means you will be weaker than EVERYONE ELSE)\r<br />\r<br />5. If magic is way too strong, go into Alteration Perks and add Magic Resistance Perks…. Still too much for you to handle? Then go to the Lord Stone and give yourself another dose of damage resistance. If you need more, then go home….. just go home.\r<br />\r<br />6. Be a badass and get ready for “heart stopping” epic fights&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-DreezNation",
