  "descriptionHtml": "Please note: This is only a retex, you will need the original mod first.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51175/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D51175%26preview%3D&pUp=1]Stormcloak Mage Robe\r<br />[/url]\r<br />I really like this robe, but on my system it came out looking black in most lighting instead of stormcloak blue. So this is a paler retexture. If you have a darker ENB or just darker screen resolution, this is the retexture for you. You may notice some swirly designs on the arms and chest; that&#39;s because I used the Vaermina robes recolored to blue, and as much as I tried to get the swirls to blend in, they still show a little. \r<br />This should work for both male and female characters. These robes do look different in direct sunlight compared to indoors, which is why the second picture looks quite a bit darker.\r<br />\r<br />Have fun blasting those faithless imperial dogs&#33; ",
