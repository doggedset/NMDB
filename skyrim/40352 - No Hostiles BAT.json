  "modName": "No Hostiles BAT",
  "summary": "This is a bat file that makes npcs/creatures that would normally be hostile to you non-hostile.\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "For those people that would rather play Skyrim as a non-combatant character, explore without having to fight, or are bad at the game\\\\\\'s combat for any reason.\r\n\r\nTo use:\r\n1) Save the bat file as a .txt file, works best with a one word file name, eg. nohostiles\r\n2) Move it to your skyrim directory:\r\nSteam - C:\\\\\\\\Program Files\\\\\\\\Steam\\\\\\\\steamapps\\\\\\\\common\\\\\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\r\nNon-steam - C:\\\\\\\\Program Files\\\\\\\\Bethesda Softworks\\\\\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim OR C:\\\\\\\\Program Files\\\\\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\r\n3) Launch the game and load a save\r\n4) Open the console (tilde key)\r\n5) Type \\\\\\\"bat <name of the .txt file>\\\\\\\" , eg. bat nohostiles, and press enter\r\n\r\nThis works by adding your character to many (142) factions so that members of those factions will not be hostile to you. Also removes your character from the PlayerFaction - not sure whether that will have any negative effects.\r\n\r\nThis is the first version and not thoroughly tested so if you experience issues or still get attacked, tell me by whom, where and any factions your character is in and I\\\\\\'ll try to fix it! As always use console codes at your own responsibility as they can cause various unfixable issues/",
