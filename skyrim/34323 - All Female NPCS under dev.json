  "summary": "A mod I am working on that basically changes every male NPC in Skyrim to a Female one.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hello all, and welcome to my mod page.  In short, the purpose of this mod is to make Skyrim a little better to look at, and one of the things I did was change all of the males into females.  Installation is pretty easy, and all and all, the mod itself is pretty simple.  Everything you need to know is below. \r<br />\r<br />WHAT THE MOD DOES:\r<br />\r<br />Well, to be frank, it makes all of the characters pretty young women.  Pretty cut and dry.  Additionally, I&#39;ve added tktk&#39;s tint mask off his prettyface mod.  They&#39;re much better than the vanilla ones, and are wrapped into my install to make things easier.  If you don&#39;t want to use them, then just install another mod over it, shouldn&#39;t do any harm unless you get rid of my esp.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:  \r<br />\r<br />Ok, so I originally thought that there wasn&#39;t really an order to this, but there is.  If there are other mods that tweak characters, this mod should go on top of it.  If not, the minor tweaks will actually override the way the characters look, which will cause incurable grey face.  The fix, make sure that this mod is lower in your install order.  Beyond that, if you&#39;re still getting grey face issues, I suggest you use my grey face guide (in the optional files on the download page), and if THAT doesn&#39;t fix it, then throw me a comment and I&#39;ll see what we can do to fix it.  Also, just a note, but LOOT tends to put this mod pretty high on the mod order, so you may have to tweak LOOT to make Allfem lower in the order.  You may also have to run a few patchers, like for instance patchus maximus exports my mod, so if you don&#39;t rerun the patcher than you won&#39;t see any changes if you update.\r<br />\r<br />WARNING: \r<br />\r<br />This mod is in no way suitable for players who want their Skyrim experience to be &#39;real.&#39; That isn&#39;t the intention of this mod, nor will it ever be...or could I guess.\r<br />\r<br />The voices are staying male for a long time, if not forever unless someone else wants to tackle that. There are a couple reasons for this.  One, I don&#39;t have a female voice (being a male) and involving more people delays things further. So on that end, it&#39;s something I might do later, but don&#39;t count on it unless people volunteer.  Secondary to that issue, is that I would want to make sure that the work is quality, and even if I did pull someone I know that without quality recording equipment I wouldn&#39;t want to tackle it.  The main reason I don&#39;t do this however, is while I know how to substitute voice files, messing with them can WRECK quest lines unless you are extremely careful.  If this ever becomes a thing, it&#39;ll be supplemental to the completed mod and will have a LONG processing time.\r<br />\r<br />While my mod contains no nudity, if you are running a body mod that makes females naked you will see a lot more of it.  The reason for this is that a lot of dead npcs (and some prisoners and beggars) don&#39;t have anything equipped.  In the vanilla game, this just equates to the individual wearing underwear but if you have a body mod with no underwear on, they will be naked.  You have been warned, but at the same time if you have such a body mod I can&#39;t imagine it bothers you much.\r<br />\r<br />You might come across the GRAY FACE, which is basically unavoidable unless you&#39;re running a pretty much vanilla game.  Also, until the Dawnguard update is done those with Dawnguard WILL have grey face on their vampires unless they also load Dawnguard as a master my esp during the grey face work.  I haven&#39;t updated my guide yet for the expacs (that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to work on next) so you&#39;ll just have to hold tight on that.  I&#39;d also suggest not messing with it unless you know what you&#39;re doing (it involves changing ini variables in the ck, which can break it) cause I&#39;ve seen a couple of people giving &#39;advice&#39; on how to do it that will just break the ck.\r<br />\r<br />Lastly, to all of those who wish to flame this mod, or do something similar to press your superior masculinity upon us, or whatever, I&#39;m just going to type this as a catch all for those comments. I personally, am straight, as I assume would be evident by the fact I&#39;m repopulating the entirety of Skyrim with females, but just in case you needed a push in the right direction there it is. Further more, there isn&#39;t anything wrong with people who aren&#39;t, cause they&#39;re just people, and typing hateful things to the internet isn&#39;t going to make your views on the matter anymore right. All it will do is make you look stupid and ignorant. Lastly, and most importantly, nobody cares. Trust me, you aren&#39;t going to change the world by flaming the comment section with your idiotic ideas, since a majority of the time, I&#39;m rather sure I&#39;m the only one who reads them, and anyone with a brain would just ignore them.\r<br />\r<br />REQUESTS\r<br />\r<br />So, request is a bad word to put up there, cause I&#39;m not really requesting it, it&#39;s just more, if someone has/wants to do it.  It&#39;d be charity, and I by no means expect anyone to do it for me. \r<br />\r<br />Briarhearts-mesh/texture for females.  I&#39;ve seen a couple bouncing around but they&#39;re all tied to outfits as opposed to characters (which I would prefer).  Only issue there-in being that you&#39;d have to make versions for multiple body mods and vanilla to really work it.  On the bright side, only bretons can be briarhearts.  I&#39;d try to tackle this, but I lack the artistic ability to mess with textures and at least with my few attempts I made, I&#39;m pretty garbage at meshing too, sorry.\r<br />\r<br />Female anything but player race - I can do the ck work for it, but again meshes/textures.  I&#39;d probably have to introduce scripting to if the changes were TOO severe (like making an ice atronach a small petite girly whatever) which I could probably hash out on my own, though preferably with someone to bounce ideas with. On another note, I chose not to make the draugr all female originally cause when I started I couldn&#39;t think of a way to get rid of their beards when I converted them (it was a weird problem, but the ck doesn&#39;t really have a lot of leniency with facial hair on them) and when I figured it out, I decided against it.  Mostly cause I&#39;m trying to make skyrim attractive and a bunch of dried corpses isn&#39;t terribly...attractive to me.  If someone finds a way to make them &#39;cute&#39; (I&#39;ve seen stranger things on the internet) then I&#39;d be more than willing to incorporate that too. \r<br />\r<br />Khajit/Argonian Humanoid replacement - I&#39;m kinda putting this here as a buffer.  I&#39;ve seen a couple of mods I like (especially for khajit) but I&#39;ve only ever seen two humanizations for Argonians.  One of them is incredibly out of date, and the other is over a year old with a dead link (in the lovers lab).  If I&#39;m going to do one race, I&#39;m going to do two, so this is kinda a &#39;when I find ones that work, I&#39;ll do it&#39; kinda thing.\r<br />\r<br />Greybeard Robes- So, there is a in-game nif for females wearing the greybeard robes (weird right? They programmed the game so you can&#39;t equip it) but there&#39;s a lack of mods that alter their female nif, cause the likelihood of wearing it requires a mod.  If someone has/wants to make a mod that covers this, I&#39;d love to know.\r<br />\r<br />Female Voices - A biggie since I started the mod is that the converted males sound like drag queens with a lot of very convincing surgery.  It stopped bothering me a while ago, but as I put somewhere above, I lack the female voice and proper recording equipment to actually fix this.  I also lack the funds to throw at someone for this as well.  My biggest thing on this is that if I do it, I want it done right and it&#39;ll take a while.  I&#39;d probably work a voice at a time (like, generic voice, as opposed to npc cause a bunch share lines) and the ck work would be horrendous.  A large amount of quests are tied to dialogue and if the dialogue isn&#39;t linked right, quests will fail to advance or start, etc.  As well, I&#39;d want the voices to be of a similar quality to the female voices already there, not too much better, and definitely not worse, to keep an even flow.  As cheap an answer it may be, there&#39;s a couple mods that silence voices you can use and insert female voice dialogue with your imagination in the mean time.  Sorry about that if you don&#39;t like my answer.  (In case it wasn&#39;t clear, I&#39;m willing to do all the ck work, and etc, I just need voice cuts really)\r<br />\r<br />And uh, I don&#39;t have anything else.  If you guys have recommendations for what I should add, feel free to hit me up in the comment box if it doesn&#39;t cover anything I&#39;ve mentioned.  You can ask about these too of course, but my answer will likely be the same as what I&#39;ve already said.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />BUGS:\r<br />\r<br />So, firstly I&#39;m going to list a couple of things that I might have missed (I&#39;ve fixed a few hear or there already).  The biggest one is floating scars.  For obvious reasons, males and females have different models for their scars.  Sometimes, I forget to swap them out properly, and essentially, have a male scar on a female face.  That may not sound bad, but it manifests by having parts of it sucked into their face, other parts floating, and the scar pivoting weirdly when the character turns their head.  Other things might just be ass ugly NPCs that I should fix (I can think of a couple that I&#39;ll hit later).  To put it bluntly, I didn&#39;t used to be that good at this, and then I got better.  If you see a butt ugly NPC let me know (and tell me who it is of course).\r<br />\r<br />THINGS MY MOD WON&#39;T MESS UP:\r<br />\r<br />Ok, I figure that this is necessary, cause I&#39;ve had odd comments.  My mod only touches two things, a character&#39;s face values, and a character&#39;s gender.  And...that&#39;s it.  I don&#39;t do anything to what a character wears, carries, or does.  Like at all.  If you&#39;re character is suddenly missing a head, a body, or whatever, you have a messed up texture somewhere, or your game is breaking. The ONLY exception is briarhearts, if you are having issues with them, let me know (to be precise, I changed out the briarheart base mesh with a normal breton).  I don&#39;t mind helping you through these issues, just be wary that my mod probably didn&#39;t cause it.  To go further, I haven&#39;t touched spawn rates, spells, or equipment.\r<br />\r<br />*****USERS WITH DAWNGUARD******\r<br />\r<br />I already mentioned this, but I&#39;m restating it, ALL VAMPIRES WILL HAVE GRAY FACE IF YOU HAVE DAWNGUARD.  This is because Dawnguard gives the vampires a huge face lift (for the most part) and I&#39;m working on the vanilla vampires*.  Because I don&#39;t have dawnguard loaded while I work on the mod (for now) even if you export the facegen data, the conflicting data between the vanilla edits and Dawnguard will cause a bunch of the vamps to have gray face issues.  If you don&#39;t have Dawnguard this shouldn&#39;t be an issue beyond having to do your own exports, but Dawnguard users will have this issue until I get to the DLC (or you get proactive and load the dlc and patch for yourself, but that&#39;s a pain [I&#39;ll be amending the gray face guide for it when I get there])\r<br />\r<br />* The more technical answer has to do with the way the files load, and Dawnguard being earlier in the load order than my mod that affects something it edits as well in the Skyrim esp.  The two edits put together cause an inconsistency since Dawnguard adds a few values that my mod doesn&#39;t cover, or incorrectly covers, kinda like a round hole/square peg scenario which causes the game to default to a blank face and gray shade\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS:\r<br />\r<br />Inherently, this mod requires no actual other mods.  The only thing you really need for this to run smoothly is the export data.  I&#39;m working on uploading those as I go but it&#39;ll only work perfectly if you only have my mod installed.  Anything else that edits NPCs could cause another problem, which will require the use of the guide.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />LINKS FOR YOUR ENJOYMENT:\r<br />Calientes body mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666/?\r<br />\r<br />tktks Pretty Face: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7887/?\r<br />\r<br />ratraces Orc Enhancer: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32534/? \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />FUTURE PLANS/POSSIBILITIES:\r<br />Alright, there are a couple things that are possible beyond what I&#39;m doing, and when I&#39;m done with this, some of what I&#39;m about to say will definitely be done by me.  Others...well, ya.  I&#39;ll just say what I will and won&#39;t be doing here.\r<br />\r<br />Finishing Vanilla Skyrim-Vanilla is Done, wooooo&#33;\r<br />\r<br />DLC: In progress&#33; Currently on Dawnguard\r<br />\r<br />Replacing Argonians and Khajit with more physically appealing races: Back burnered.  Found a couple of good mods, and one for khajit that is exactly what I&#39;m looking for (though I&#39;ve only found the body part for the Argonians).  That said, I haven&#39;t bothered to ask for permissions yet as if I do this it&#39;ll be after I&#39;m done with DLC.  And the fact that I haven&#39;t found a facepack replacer for Argonians yet so meh.\r<br />\r<br />Work on a majority of the non (vanilla) playable races (i.e. giants, etc.): Likely never.  I did rework the Dremora, only though because they&#39;re easy to manipulate in the creation kit.  Probably why you see so many different race mods for them.  If someone is willing to make a mesh for me then I&#39;d gladly do it, but I&#39;m garbage at working meshes and textures.\r<br />\r<br />Voice work: Uh...ya.  I&#39;m not tackling this by myself. Sorry for beating a dead horse, but it&#39;s worth restating.  I&#39;m willing to help out, and integrate it with my mod, but a large chunk of the work will have to be tackled by someone else.  Sorry, but the voices don&#39;t really bother me all too much, and I have a big enough job just changing the faces as it is.  If your interested, send me a PM about it so we can talk it out, but be warned.  It&#39;ll be a lot of work.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />And now, for CREDITS&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Tktk, for his awesome tintmask that I totally stole, but it&#39;s alright since his permissions allow it.\r<br />Caliente, for the awesome face model, that I use while playing with the many, many faces of skyrim.\r<br />Apachii, for the hair mod that&#39;s in the previous wonky version I took down \r<br />Ratrace, for the orc race enhancer.  I&#39;ve stopped using it lately and the mod has been taken down, but if you happen to have it then I&#39;d recommend it.\r<br />Humplus, for making the original mod and pushing me into creating my own.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />And, to finish it up, PERMISSIONS:\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t care what you use my mod for, or if you alter it, or whatever else, as long as I get a mention for laying the ground work, and you throw a mention to tktk for making the tintmask if you decide to use that.",
