Unfortunately, my scripting skill was not enough to manage a decent and stable script, so I was forced to use CM Companion Mod to have custom NPC  by my side, helping me in fighting Daedra. I was not too happy, but this was enough for me. Today, I am in condition to do my followers for Skyrim.  I like to share them with community. \r\nThis is one of them. \r\nI hope you can enjoy travelling Skyrim in good company. \r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis mod adds to the Skyrim Gameworld a female Woodelf Archer named Glaween that can be found in Whiterun. She is can be married.\r\nThere are 2 versions: Not essential and essential.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nYou can find her in Whiterun. \r\nIn early morning, more or less until 12.00 AM, she will be at the market; after this, she will walk in all City until 8.00 PM; then she will dinner to the Bannered Mare, and after this, she will pass the night in The Drunken Huntsman.\r\nShe have this A.I. to try to  gige a little more life to Whiterun.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nShe have her own Class, as well her own combat style; 2 enchanted bows and a knife in her inventory, and also some money and arrows . All these items will be useful to her and player, if liked. If anyone can remember my Oblivion\\'s Glaween Companion, will be happy to have her again.\r\n\r\nIn my system are installed these mods.\r\n\r\nCBBE V3 (standard body) and the hip texture compatability pack:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nBella\\'s Better Females version 3:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nCover Eyes (eyes 1 file):\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869\r\n\r\nJoseph Anthonys Lip Gloss for Better Females by Joseph Anthony\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13860\r\n\r\nNo More Blocky Faces by Xenius\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=30\r\n\r\nWithout these mods the look will be different from the look of the screenshots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n\r\nI like very much Nexus Mod Manager, it is perfect for me. I suggest to use it, but....your choice.\r\n\r\nPick which method you are going to use for installation:\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Installation\r\n- = or = -\r\nManual installation \r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager installation:\r\nDownload the file with Nexus Mod Manager. Activate it. Done.\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\nPlace the zip file\\'s contents into your Skyrim/data folder to install and be sure to activate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\nPick which method you are going to use for uninstall based on how you installed it:\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Uninstall\r\n- = or = -\r\nManual Uninstall\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Uninstall\r\nOpen Nexus mod Manager and deactivate the file EAGlaween. Done.\r\n\r\n\r\nManual Uninstall\r\n\r\nRemove the zip file\\'s contents from your Skyrim/data folder to uninstall and be sure to deactivate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing.\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n=======\r\n18/Mar/2012 Version 1.0 is the initial version of this file.\r\n\r\nUpgrading from version 1: \r\nIt is necessary to remove all items from inventory of Glaween 1 before upgrading to version 1, then deactivate version 1 and activate version 1.1. If you do not follow the instructions, all itms in your inventory will be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nNone known.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nIf you decide to marry her, it is better to tell her where she can live with you BEFORE she leaves the temple in Riften.\r\nThis follower was developed to work with Multi followers, CM Companion Level mod and Ask Follower Skills. Running it with these mods means keeping it clear and bug free.\r\nThis do not means that it can\\'t be used under UFO;  I haven\\'t UFO, so I cannot say what can happen if you use it under UFO itself.\r\nTalking of load order, it is fundamental to run this file AFTER UFO itself, this can avoid best part of eventual problems.\r\nI can\\'t see any reason to develop a version specifically to run with UFO. If my files are clear without it, eventual problems are to be considered of UFO itself, not mine. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also download my other mods:\r\n\r\nA Breton Witchunter follower Samhair\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14686\r\n\r\nA Cute Redguard Follower Calypso\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13744\r\n\r\nA Nord Warrior Follower Shanya\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12893\r\n\r\nA Wood Elf Ranger follower Sharwyn\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15940\r\n\r\nA Woodelf Archer follower Cinthowen\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15198\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0, 2012/03/18 - Initial release.\r\n26/Apr/2012     -  Released Glaween 1.1. in 2 Versions, GlaweenNE_1_1 not essential, and GlaweenE_1_1 essential.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nYou can find me on TESNexus as eamico\r\nYou can send me an email here: eamico@tiscali.it\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\nThanks to TESNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\nThanks to Apachii for ApachiiSkyHair.\r\nSpecial thanks to Blackie for his CM New Companions mod that includes a top-notch detailed tutorial on how to create Skyrim companions without the face discoloration bug.
