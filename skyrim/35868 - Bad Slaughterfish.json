  "descriptionHtml": "Ever thought that those pesky slaughterfish were uber annoying as there is no combat in water. I do... So I made this mod that pretty much makes the slaughterfish not attack in water as well as having no damage. Ive added the fact that Slaughterfish are now non-hostile. So that should be right now! \r\n\r\nHowever I am unsure if it has any major bugs I cant find any.",
