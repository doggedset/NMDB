  "summary": "Brows is a Skyrim texture mod that replace the existing eyebrows with high resolution hand painted eyebrows that are true to the vanilla style, but look so much more photo realistic. Brows also feature added brow styles that will be added along the way as the mod develops and brow style requests are given.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[font=copperplate]\r<br />[img]http://lthot.dk/har/header_brows.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://lthot.dk/har/introduction.png[/img]\r<br />[font=Verdana]Brows is a Hvergelmir&#39;s Aesthetics mod that replace all Skyrim vanilla brow textures with completely new high resolution hand painted  - from scratch - eyebrows. The aim is to be as photo realistic as possible, without actually literally copying eyebrows from photos. All eyebrows have been hand painted to imitate existing brows from Skyrim. Brows also come with an .esp file that adds additional NEW eyebrows to the game, based on requests from fans and my own ideas. Some of these eyebrows are based on my own eyebrows as well as friends and family around me. All brows, including vanilla replacers also come in lighter and darker variants, so you have a huge selection of eyebrows, that should hopefully suit everyones personal preferences.\r<br />\r<br />Brows is first and foremost a vanilla texture replacer and you&#39;re not obligated to use the included .esp file, but I do highly recommend it, if not for the sake of getting additional eyebrow styles, but for the sake of having the new dark and light variants of all eyebrows as well.\r<br />\r<br />[list][color=#e69138]\r<br />[*]Vanilla eyebrow textures are 128x64 px.[/*]\r<br />[*]Brows high-res pack are 1024x512 px - these should not affect most people performance wise.[/*]\r<br />[*]Brows also comes in 512x256 px for those with really old computers. Only recommended for weaker computers and laptops.[/*]\r<br />[*]There&#39;s also a 1024x512 uncompressed version available. These are uncompressed and NOT optimized - only the strongest rigs should use these for general play, otherwise only recommended for screenshots and/or videos for the best realism.[/*]\r<br />[/color][/list]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Verdana]All textures have already been optimized, so please don&#39;t attempt to run these through DDSOpt (or similar). Do NOT delete alpha channel of the eyebrows, or you&#39;ll have unwanted results in game. The alpha channel is needed not only for specular properties, but also to let Skyrim engine know what is eyebrow and what is not. Removing it completely will have Skyrim think the whole texture is one big eyebrow.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;[/font]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://lthot.dk/har/addimage.png[/img][/center][b][color=#ff9900][url=http://facebook.com/HvergelmirsArmorRetexture][center][/center][/url][/color][/b][center][b][color=#ff9900][url=https://www.facebook.com/HvergelmirsMods][img]http://lthot.dk/har/facebook.png[/img][/url][/color][/b][/center]\r<br />[img]http://lthot.dk/har/videos.png[/img]\r<br />[center] \r<br />[youtube]dOCB79Ge7tk[/youtube]\r<br />[font=Verdana]Find more videos in the video section\r<br />[/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://lthot.dk/har/installation_and_uninstallation.png[/img]\r<br />[font=Verdana]It is recommended to install Brows with Nexus Mod Manager, it simplifies the process greatly and also makes it simple to uninstall again if needed.\r<br />\r<br />To manually install Brows, use either WinRar or 7-Zip to extract the files to[color=#708090][b] Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim[/b][/color]\r<br />If asked to override, click yes.
