I am so sorry. But get a life, its just fun and games\r\n\r\n.\\\"I\\'m being crapped on by cattle from the devil\\'s own satanic herd!\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLevel 10 Lord Blackadder resides in Whiterun in Dragonreach.He will level with you, is a vampire for the fun of it, and is marriageable. He can use just about anything you give him, because...well he\\'s blackadder.  Mainly Two handed to start off with, and again the voice is not right, but its the voice i like.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEEDS DAWNGUARD TO RUN\r\n\r\nI gave him vanilla hair so there are no issues or crashes.
