I need to stop doing that. Let&#39;s try again, I&#39;m sorry for making it brief. [/center][center]Er-hem. Hello friends&#33; Welcome to another ClefJ town overhaul, where I am nothing if not consistent in that I make performance-friendly and visually appealing mods. Indeed, as much as I love JK&#39;s and Hold&#39;s work on these towns, I felt the need again to make something in my own fashion. You should feel cozy in this snowier, busier port that shows its history. \r<br />[i]\r<br />[color=#00ff00]What the town offers: [/color][/i]\r<br />- A visual overhaul that suggests Dawnstar was indeed a [i]garrison [/i]town, held a number of fishermen and stood against a siege of &#39;ice tribes&#39;.\r<br />- The new gates show ancient walls overcome by snow and time.\r<br />- A new bunkhouse for miners, and a new General Goods store&#33;\r<br />- A second ship and loading crane at the expanded docks. Better NPC&#39;s maybe in the future.\r<br />- Quicksilver Mine and its mountain have been moved back a few meters to offer more workroom away from the tide.\r<br />- Minor landscape changes, including a little creek in town.\r<br />- The White Hall has been turned into an actual [i]longhouse[/i], built over the ruins of the Snow Elves, to make it seem apparent that the ice tribes were invading over the issue of settling over their land. \r<br />- All cabins now have chimneys&#33; That bugged the heck out of me for some reason in vanilla skyrim. \r<br />- A new player home&#33; And minor detailwork to the rest of town. \r<br />All made using vanilla assets&#33; Should make it easier for this to be ported over to SSE Console mods. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][i]What the player home offers:[/i][/color]\r<br />- A lovely layout heavily inspired by FlahoShi&#39;s Eagle&#39;s Nest.\r<br />- Multiple Adoption friendly.\r<br />- A fancy throne why not.\r<br />The key to the home lies in the lover&#39;s tent on the coastline&#33; Otherwise, just an adept lock to claim the home.\r<br />\r<br />Requires:\r<br />- Dragonborn, Dawnguard and Hearthfire\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Compatibility issues: [/color]\r<br />- There are navmesh edits. I know, I&#39;m sorry. Gotta be honest. \r<br />- Any changes to Dawnstar. Obviously. \r<br />- It&#39;s been brought to my attention that there are a few navmesh finalization issues here. Unfortunately I&#39;m bogged down with other projects, so I certainly give permission to anyone who think they can fix the issue.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]Good News&#33;[/color]\r<br />- Compatible with a great deal of Dawnstar player homes, including Morskom Estate.\r<br />- Friendly to Interesting NPC&#39;s. \r<br />NOW COMPATIBLE with Fast Travel Overhaul&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Thank you for taking a look, I hope you enjoy&#33; Updates, fixes and such may come more promptly than in my other works.
