Thanks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />==============================\r<br />Description\r<br />==============================\r<br />Adds the Chakra Disruption Blade from the Naruto anime. There are two ways to obtain the weapon:\r<br />1 - Craft it (it will be under the ebony branch).\r<br />2 - Write in console &#92;&#34;player.additem 35000d62 1&#92;&#34;, without the &#92;&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />It was created as a one-handed sword.\r<br />As a final remark, this weapon is also possible to temper with.\r<br />\r<br />If you find any bugs or something you wanted to see in this mod, just post on the comments or message me.\r<br />\r<br />==============================\r<br />Installation\r<br />==============================\r<br />Just extract the folders and .esp to Skyrim&#92;&#39;s Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />==============================\r<br />Optional files currently available\r<br />==============================\r<br />- None.\r<br />\r<br />==============================\r<br />Extra notes\r<br />==============================\r<br />Right now, I&#39;m not going to focus on improving this weapon. Clearly, the texture isn&#39;t the best one. However, you can improve it yourself, as long as you credit the source of the original files. If you make a good texture and don&#39;t want to create a new mod so we don&#39;t end up having a lot of equal items in the Nexus, you can send it to me and I&#39;ll upload it here and give it credit to you.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy.",
