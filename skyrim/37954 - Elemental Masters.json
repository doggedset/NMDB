  "descriptionHtml": "this is a small and quick mod that adds destruction perks that adds new lesser powers, that turns you into your favorite element and potenciate the spells of that element.\r\n\r\nok the idea is that the enemy keeps leveling up with you and your spells don\\'t seem to make so much damage, so now you can especialize in your favorite element an turns your very nature in that element, so your nature changes and you\\'re a mix of flesh and thunder or ice or fire... so weapons don\\'t do so much damage to you anymore (the oposite element do more damage to you) so if you\\'re electricity, ice element do more damage to you because of the water of the ice or some other lame pretext, also you don\\'t have stamina anymore because you\\'re no longer fully human... all this bulls..t it\\'s just for balancing gameplay, because now, a thunderbolt do 4 times more damage and your nature harms enemies with lightning or whatever just by standing near to you!!\r\n\r\nso now you can scream... POWERRR UNLIMITED POWAAAAAAAA!!! and kill sonsofabit..es with sparks or flames or just a thunderbolt etc.\r\n\r\nalso if you\\'re lightning, shock spells don\\'t do damage to you no more... obvious! duh!\r\nENDORSE! and positive criticism...  -_-\r\n\r\n(installation, drop the .esp in the data folder and activate, if it doesn\\'t work for you, if the perks aren\\'t there, is because you have another mod that edits the destruction perk tree, just load this esp last)\r\n\r\nlatest version are called pyromancer cryomancer etc... and also there is an optional with no perks, the tomes are sold by faralda after the destruction ritual and adds also a spell that its so much overpowered in wich you have the 3 elements.",
