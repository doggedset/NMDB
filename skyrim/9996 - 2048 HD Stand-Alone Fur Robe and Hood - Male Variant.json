I had to address some issues that were missed ... Fixed glow map issues on n file, Fixed leg & feet not showing, Adjusted color of top layer and I added some \\\"brighter\\\" Screens of the new model [/center][/b]\r\n\r\nFinally got my brain around CK so that I can present to you a hi-rez male variant of the fur robes. It took me a little while to figure out the pathing, but in the end I was able to get it done. So we have a stand-alone light armor using the mantled apprentice robes, which I feel looks masculine if done correctly. This is still a W.I.P. so report bugs if you have them, it should be beast race compatible, and I placed them for sale at Lucan\\'s Trading post in Riverwood. It is craft-able at the tanning rack & upgrade-able at the workbench. I haven\\'t tried to enchant them yet but it shouldn\\'t be an issue.\r\n\r\nI think that\\'s it ... oh you can also wear a circlet under the hood & if there was just a way to get rid of that man-purse I\\'ll be a happy camper... \r\n\r\nEnjoy, I hope you like it!\r\n\r\nInstallation is drop the whole data folder into your main game directory then use NM to activate the esp.\r\n=====================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nfor the savvy ... you may want to unpack the archive onto your desktop to check the structure then copy the contents over to your data folder... it\\'s up to you.\r\n",
