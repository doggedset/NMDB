  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is an improved version of my [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51679/?]Summonable Ethereal Chest[/url], with new sound effects and visuals.\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=244321934]Steam version[/url].\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/uKeDmE3.png[/img]\r<br />[img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/972816-1393781189.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]tNAMcRh95jQ[/youtube]\r<br />You are one of the most powerful mages of Skyrim, but you didn&#39;t invest too much in Stamina, which means you can&#39;t take a lot of items during your adventures?\r<br />\r<br />You are moving from your home to another one, but Lydia is not strong enough to carry all of your burdens?\r<br />\r<br />Well, look no more, adventurer. This mod is for you. When killing a dremora, bandit mage, forsworn wizard or Thalmor wizard, you will notice they sometimes have a curious spell tome that you never saw before. Upon reading this book, it&#39;s suddenly clear: you are now able to summon a chest from one of the multiples planes of Oblivion. This is just what you needed.\r<br />\r<br />But, upon using this spell, and thus summoning the chest, you hear a voice. You&#39;re not becoming insane; this chest is talking&#33; Is it self-conscious? Did the Ideal Masters tie someone&#39;s soul to it? You don&#39;t know, and probably never will, but you feel your Magicka being drained when the chest is not empty.\r<br />\r<br />Is this balanced? In my opinion, yes. First, the spell will consume half of your magicka +30 (doesn&#39;t matter how of a skilled mage you are). Second, the spell can only be used once per day, and the chest will vanish upon closing it, so think twice before summoning and using it&#33; Also, while the chest is not empty, you will suffer from a Magicka debuff.\r<br />\r<br />The book can also be found in some spell tomes vendors, for a kind of heavy price.\r<br />\r<br />Compatiblity-wise, this mod is totally clean (no dirty edits) and is compatible with every mod you could imagine (even SkyRe and other overhauls). If you are using my old mod from the Nexus, just overwrite it. If you were subscribed to the old mod on Steam, for the love of god, unsubsribe before installing this one.\r<br />\r<br />To summarize things:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Spell tomes can be found on dremora, bandit mages, forsworn wizards or Thalmor wizards. Not really often though, to keep things balanced (10% probability).\r<br />[*]The spell can only be used once a (game) day. Scrolls versions of the spell can be crafted at the forge. The crafting option will appear only if you have the spell tome OR the spell.\r<br />[*]While the chest is not empty, you will suffer of a Magicka debuff.\r<br />[*]The chest is voiced by the Dremora voice. Skulls and bones will be thrown all over the place, and will disappear a few seconds later (no issue with your savegames).[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/972816-1393781279.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Use Nexus Mod Manager, or unzip the files contained in this download, and put the BSA and ESP files in your DATA folder, then activate it using your favourite mod manager.\r<br />\r<br />If you ever wish to uninstall it, make sure you summoned the chest and got your belongings back. Delete all files associated with the mod (SummonableChest.esp and SummonableChest.bsa).\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/972816-1393781343.jpg[/img]\r<br />[youtube]JK5KcauNdbo[/youtube][youtube]PA3kvN05SRE[/youtube][youtube]jkjyYUEmwKU[/youtube][insert Brodual/Gopher/someone else&#39;s video here *wishes for a review*]",
