That blade looks sharp enough to cut through a god&#33;&#34;[/size][/i]\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[color=#00ff00]Ever felt that an axe that looks so awesome deserves a more awesome enchantment? Well that is what this mod aims to do&#33;Â \r<br />[/color]\r<br />[color=#00ff00]Remember that Axe that is sat in your weapon rack? You know, the one you killed that talking dog for? Yes that one. Well now there is reason to pick up that dust gatherer and start kicking ass&#33; Curse of the Rueful replaces that generic &#34;Does 20 points of Stamina Damage&#34; Enchantment with a more &#34;useful&#34; one called &#34;Curse of the Rueful&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Its description is short and simple &#34;Clavicus Vile&#39;s power imbues the Axe&#34;. The actual enchantment, however, is very different. It has an &#34;Absorb Health&#34; effect, an &#34;Absorb Stamina&#34; effect and a &#34;Soul Trap&#34; effect.\r<br />\r<br />I bet that weapon rack will be empty from now on...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/color][color=#38761d][size=6]This is my first mod, so any constructive criticism is welcome.[/size][/color]",
