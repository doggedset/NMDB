  "descriptionHtml": "Changes enchantment on Thieves Guild Boots, Improved Thieves Guild Boots and Guild Master\\'s Boots. Enchantments on all other Thieves Guild Armor parts, as well as the item stats are [i]unchanged[/i].\r\n\r\n• Thieves Guild Boots (Normal ones you get after joining the Thieves Guild):\r\n   From Fortify Pickpocket by 15% to Fortify Sneak by 15%\r\n• Thieves Guild Boots (Improved ones, you can possibly get them after you complete the Scoundrel\\'s Folly quest in the Thieves Guild Storyline):\r\n   From Fortify Pickpocket by 25% to Fortify Sneak by 25%\r\n• Guild Master\\'s Boots (You get them after completing the Under New Management Quest and becoming the Thieves Guild Master):\r\n   From Fortify Pickpocket by 35% to Fortify Sneak by 35%\r\n\r\nThe reason I created this mod is a bug in the game; basically it makes all Fortify Pickpocket Enchantments in the game [i]lower[/i] your chances of succeeding instead of increasing them. \r\nHere\\'s how Skyrim Wiki describes it:\r\n[i]\r\nAny form of Fortify Pickpocket actually subtracts x% from the success rate when it should be adding that same x% to the success rate.\r\nE.g., Thieves Guild boots subtract 15% chance of success instead of adding 15%.\r\n[/i]\r\n\r\nThis bug is well-known and present on all platforms. It still is present in the version 1.9.32.0.8 of the game.\r\n______________________________________\r\nSteam Workshop Version: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=144547060",
