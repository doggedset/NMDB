  "descriptionHtml": "[Update: Added color variants of the &#34;muffle&#34; effect&#33;]\r<br />\r<br />This mod provides a ton of alteration armor effects to pick between. Currently, I have implemented:\r<br />\r<br />- A multitude of colors.\r<br />Current colors: Red, white, yellow, yellow-orange, red-orange, blue, aqua (similar to default color), fuchsia, and green.\r<br />\r<br />- Strong, light, and muffled (three versions) of every color variant. \r<br />&#34;Strong&#34; variants are very opaque and bright, &#34;light&#34; variants are much more subtle, and &#34;muffled&#34; variants are softer and look better on skin.\r<br />\r<br />- Misc variants\r<br />These include alterations to the effect such as a replacement made with the &#34;muffle&#34; effect, a variant with no visible effect, and now elemental effects&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Let me know if there are any variants you would like added&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[&#33;]I STRONGLY recommend you download this mod with the Nexus Mod Manager[&#33;]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Notes:\r<br />-This only changes the color of the body glow, all of the casting effects (such as the spell in your hand) remain the same at the moment.\r<br />-This also changes the alteration armor visual effect on NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Known bugs:\r<br />- None.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />- NMM Variants Module\r<br />Modified the module from &#34;Bellyache&#39;s Animal and Creature Pack&#34;( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3621 )\r<br />Credit goes to Bellyache and Isoku.",
