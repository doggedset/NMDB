  "descriptionHtml": "I was encountering trouble when I used this mod with the german version of the game.\r\nWhen I did change the WeapMaterialDaedric of the weapon to WeapMaterialSteel, or tried to adress the item with a \\\"getequiped\\\" command the inventoryicon of the weapon did disappear.\r\nIn the original file are two \\\"stat\\\" files 1stpersonAlexBlackDragon and 1stpersonAlexBlueDragon, but they do not appear in the creation kit. I tried to mail the creator on the nexus, but was not succesful.\r\nSo I made this fix.\r\nI hope it helps.\r\nThis is my first upload.\r\n\r\nFeedback would be nice, if it did help.\r\n\r\nAll credits go to AlexScorpion\r\n",
