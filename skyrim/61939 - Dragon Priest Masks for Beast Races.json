  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/0aet9ki.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Well that was easy.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds additional meshes so that Argonian and Khajiit&#39;s snouts are not broken when wearing the base game Dragon Priest Masks.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Compatibility[/size]\r<br />\r<br />This mod will work with all standard retextures, and I&#39;ve included a patch for Apophysis Dragon Priest Masks.\r<br />\r<br />Unique Dragon Priests Masks might need a patch, but I don&#39;t know as I don&#39;t use it and don&#39;t plan to.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is NOT compatible with mods that change the stats/enchantments of the masks. You WILL need to create a merged patch in TES5Edit. \r<br />It&#39;s also not compatible with Improved Closefaced Helmets, whom as I&#39;ve just found out looking at their page, have already kind of done the same thing I&#39;ve done here, but open faced. Huh. Oh well, different design philosophies, more choices never hurt nobody, etc.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]To Do[/size]\r<br />\r<br />1. Do the Dragonborn Dragon Priests Masks. Yeah I still need to do them, and I&#39;ll get to them eventually. Probably when I get to the Dragoborn content in my playthrough, as I am actually trying to play the game here.\r<br />2. Make a merged esp with my Clavicus Vile mod.",
