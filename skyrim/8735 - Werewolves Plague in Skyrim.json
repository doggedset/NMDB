  "descriptionHtml": "This mod replace simple wolves by Savage Werewolves. In random encounters you will find Werewolves instead of wolves a lot of times. Also added minor changes in Riverwood (now people have silver weapons and vendors sells silver weapons too). I have added too Werewolves heads in spikes across the village. Its more like a village of Werewolves Hunters. I hope you will enjoy with this. And excuse me for my bad english ;)",
