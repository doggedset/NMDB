  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]NOTE:[/b][/u] The latest version changes the acquisition of the various spells, instead of a vendor NPC in Solitude spells are now acquired by activating a shrine in the location noted in the pictures, the easiest path to the location if by heading to Silent Moons Camp and heading North from there, there\\'s a pathway up a hill that leads up to a Shrine to Mara.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Latest Change:[/b][/u]\r\n[b]05/23/2013[/b]\r\n- Overhauled new version made by fellow Nexus user White Shadow uploaded changes as described follow:\r\n- All unnecessary effects and scripts removed\r\n- NPC and all packages,quests and cell-edits removed\r\n- Spells can now be obtained at a shrine next to your Imbued Weapons shrine (fitting design and placement). \r\n- All spells have the same visual effect when casting (as the lesser had in the original version)\r\n- All spells have proper and consistent descriptions\r\n- Info effect added which displays while not blocking.\r\n- Magicka-use overhauled. The mechanic is the same, while fixing the stack-bug, added 6 steps instead of 5.\r\n- Magicka-use now is balanced taking normal wards into account\r\n- The half-magicka-effect of perks is taken into account now. The magicka use generally drops with higher perks while halving it on their specific perks (Novice, Adept, Expert, Master)\r\n- Consistent naming of the effects and Spells\r\n\r\n[b][u]Description:[/u][/b]\r\nThis is a small spell mod, it adds 4 tiers of toggle powers that allow the user to cast 4 different levels of ward spell by just blocking with their equipped weapon/shield. Each spell costs varying amounts of magicka based on the restoration perks the user has obtained.\r\n\r\nThe spells are available from a new vendor NPC in Solitude, generally, he\\'ll hang around the marketplace, probably going through inappropriate idles that show just how bad I am at making packages right now, the tiers that are available will depend upon the users Restoration skill level.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Installation:[/b][/u]\r\nDownload with NMM and activate!\r\n\r\nOR!\r\n\r\nDownload, extract, throw .esp and .bsa in data, then activate!\r\n\r\n[b][u]Uninstall:[/b][/u]\r\nDeactivate in NMM!\r\n\r\nOR!\r\n\r\nDelete the .esp & .bsa!\r\n\r\n[b][u]Credits:[/b][/u]\r\nWhite Shadow - Overhauled the plugin fixing all of the many things I had missed.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Changelog:[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[b]03/20/2013[/b] - Mod Uploaded!",
