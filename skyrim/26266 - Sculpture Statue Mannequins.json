  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]Sculpture Statue Mannequins[/size]\r<br />by XunAmarox\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Description:[/size]\r<br />This replaces the default wooden male mannequin with a female stone sculpture/statue mannequin.\r<br />\r<br />I never particularly cared for the wooden mannequins, though I suppose a female one would have been nicer. And well, the &#34;real&#34; ones just weird me right out. Like a bunch of brainwashed models standing around or something. *shivers*\r<br />\r<br />So anyways, I thought having them like Greek Sculptures would be nice. Both realistic and yet fake. Best of both worlds.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]What it does:[/size]\r<br />Replaces Skyrim mannequins. If you have HearthFires DLC and want your HearthFires mannequins to look like this as well there&#39;s a separate main download for that which includes both the Vanilla and the Hearthfires mannequins. The HearthFires version includes [u]both[/u] HearthFires and Vanilla mannequins in one convenient download - choose one or the other: Either Vanilla Only or Vanilla+Hearthfires.\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t have or don&#39;t want the Hearthfires ones, the Vanilla one should be fine. HearthFires isn&#39;t required for the Vanilla one so anyone that doesn&#39;t have it shouldn&#39;t have to worry about that. [color=#ff0000]BUT THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[u]No Scripts are modified in this mod. Only the Mannequin Actors and Mannequin Race are changed.[/u]\r<br />\r<br />By default, the mannequins use the default CBBEv3 models, and some modified textures. You can use any CBBE texture compatible mesh you&#39;d like however. Just drop the meshes in: &#34;Data/Meshes/Galatea/&#34; and it should be how you want it.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to use it with another body mod... it may be more complex of a process. Textures go in: &#34;Data/Textures/Galatea&#34; but you&#39;d have to edit them yourself to make them look like a sculpture.\r<br />\r<br />[b]If you have Photoshop, here&#39;s how you do that really easily:[/b]\r<br />Desaturate\r<br />Brightness/contrast: 44 59\r<br />Filters &gt; Noise &gt; 6\r<br />Save as DDS as either 8.8.8 (no alpha) or 8.8.8.8 (alpha)\r<br />You&#39;ll need the appropriate NVIDIA plugin to open and save DDS files.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Installation:[/size]\r<br />Pretty straight forward. As the files are just an esp and a bsa, just drop them in your data folder and activate. NMM should take care of everything for you.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Uninstallation:[/size]\r<br />Just delete the esp and bsa. Should be fine.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Credits:[/size]\r<br />Caliente for CBBEv3\r<br />If I missed anyone, let me know&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Permission:[/size]\r<br />-You can INCLUDE assets from this mod in your mods as long as credit is given.\r<br />-You can not MODIFY assets of this mod and re-release them without first obtaining permission.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Known Issues:[/size]\r<br />-Brows may look outlined a bit darkly in some lighting. I&#39;ll likely release a patch to fix this in the near future.\r<br />-Small seam at the neck (likely existed in original, only more noticeable with noise). May 3D paint in Blender to see if I can fix it at some point. If it proves too difficult I may just make it a seam in the statue itself like it belongs there to mask it.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Incompatible Mods:[/size]\r<br />-Any mod that changes the mannequin races (manakin race) or overwrites files in the galatea directory (meshes/galatea or textures/galatea).\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26766/]DartHairColors[/url] - dirty edit to mannequin race, clean with TES5Edit\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25389]Sweet and Sexy Lingerie shop CBBE[/url] - remove any esp entries relating to mannequins (open in CK, Details, hit Delete key next to entries, load esp in CK & save - done), remove galatea loose files.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Changelog:[/size]\r<br />11/11/12 - Version 1.1: Hair Fix. Hair now properly replaced by Hair Biped object.\r<br />10/30/12 - Version 1.0: Vanilla+Hearthfires Initial Release",
