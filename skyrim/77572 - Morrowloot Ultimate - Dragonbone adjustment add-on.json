  "descriptionHtml": "While checking the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3203047/?]ChocolateNoodle[/url]&#39;s awesome &#34;[size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66105/?]MorrowLoot Ultimate[/url][/size]&#34; ovehaul mod (best Skyrim overhaul mod for me definitely) I found it almost perfect except in 2 small issues. I sent the message to Chocolatenoodle but I got no response, so I&#39;m posting my fix to those issues. If he wants to integrate them or post them as optional downloads I will remove them when it&#39;s done. Otherwise here they are currently.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />1) True Dragonbone Cuirass:\r<br />\r<br /> Since &#34;Morrowloot Ultimate&#34; is based on Trainwiz&#39;s &#34;Morrowloot&#34; mod it brings his Morrowind artifacts to the game, but it appears that chocolatenoodle forgot to adjust some of the artifacts to his new statistic system. This component fixes &#34;The Dragonbone Cuirass&#34; artifact from ES3 : Morrowind, which still has the vanilla Skyrim Dragonplate armor stats in MLU , which makes it weaker than ordinary crafted Dragonplate armor. \r<br />\r<br />I have adjusted it&#39;s armor rating in accord with ES3:Morrowind where it had 25% better AR than Daedric armor, so I have set it to 25% higher value than MLU Deadric armor (and also made it a bit heavier because it is made of pure dragon bone in lore, not from dragonbone plates). Now it has stats truely befitting such a legendary item.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />2) Stronger Dragonbone Weapons:\r<br />\r<br />In MLU Dragonbone weapons are set to be of same strength as Daedric ones, this bothered me because dragon bone is superior material than deadric one in lore: again, Dragonbone Cuirass in ES3, which is only armor made of PURE dragon bone in whole Tamriel, is better than Deadric cuirass, and in vanilla Skyrim Dragonbone weapons are stronger than Deadric.\r<br />\r<br /> Why is then Dragonplate armor weaker than Daedic one, you may ask? My reasoning is that dragon bone as strongest material is incredibly hard to shape and work with, and while it is possible to do something with smaller pieces, like the ones used for weapons, it is almost impossible to make a full suit of armor only out of dragon bone, therefore only ONE such artifact exists, above mentioned Dragonbone Cuirass, created by unknown smith and later enchanted by Zurin Arctus, imperial  Imperial Battlemage. \r<br /> Dragonbone plate instead, as its name suggests, is made of plates made of dragon bone which are more loosely connected by dragon scales and leather, making that armor, while still formidable, offer less protection than Deadric, which is made from one full part of deadric-infused ebony.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> \r<br /> Files are separated, so you can use only one that you want. \r<br />This is made as add-on to ether [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3203047/?]ChocolateNoodle[/url]&#39;s [size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66105/?]MorrowLoot Ultimate[/url][/size] or with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/13301210]AsatorThundrGod[/url]&#39;s  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76753/?]MUS - Morrowloot Ultimate Simplified,[/url]\r<br />Therefore, you got to one of those activated in your load order for this to work.\r<br />Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3203047/?]ChocolateNoodle[/url] fro the incredible mod he gave us and made this game a lot of times better...",
