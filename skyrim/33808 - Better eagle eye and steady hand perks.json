  "descriptionHtml": "[color=greenyellow]Update to version 1.1[/color] - Added a bunch of code changes to make everything a lot nicer and remove one particularly ugly hack. Removed options that aren\\'t needed anymore.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds the ability for the player to tweak the zoom value associated with the eagle eye perk from the in-game menu, using MCM and SkyUI. It also allows the player to tweak the stamina drain amount when zoomed in. It is also possible to adjust the time slow-down amount that comes with the steady hand perk.\r\n\r\nI made this mod because I thought it was a little strange that as a master archer I was stuck using a certain zoom level and a certain timescale. I thought it was especially odd that I had somehow lost the ability to use the faster time setting when I learned the slower one. This mod is for the times when you need a little bit more help making a snipe, or when you feel the slow down is just a little too much or too little, the values are now under your complete control. Customize to your liking!\r\n\r\n[youtube]DChfYZC__Zk[/youtube]\r\n\r\nYour character needs the eagle eye perk to adjust the settings. If you want to play with the steady hand settings you also need the steady hand perk at the second rank (2/2).\r\n\r\nFor this mod to work you need to have SkyUI installed (And therefore SKSE).\r\n\r\nThis mod does not require and DLC.\r\n\r\nThere could be some compatibility issues with other mods that alter these two perks. If you have any specific concerns please tell me and I will investigate.\r\n\r\nTo install this mod, download the .rar and use the nexus mod manager. Or you can drop the .esp and .bsa files into your Data directory if you don\\'t use the mod manager.\r\n\r\nCreated by mackam08 aka IrksomeBadger.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to the SkyUI developers for providing the MCM interface.
