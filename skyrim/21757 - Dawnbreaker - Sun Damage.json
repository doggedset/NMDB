  "descriptionHtml": "When I first heard that Dawnguard would be adding Sun Damage as a magical effect, my immediate thought was \\\"Wouldn\\'t it be awesome if Dawnbreaker did Sun Damage instead of Fire Damage?\\\" Well, I got tired of waiting for someone else to feel the same way. Dawnbreaker now deals Sun Damage instead of Fire Damage. The anti-undead explosion effect hasn\\'t been touched.\r\n\r\nBecause Sun Damage is a Dawnguard-added effect, this should require Dawnguard. This conflicts with any other mod that alters Dawnbreaker.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.",
