  "descriptionHtml": "This mod allows you to customize the music you hear from bards with your own. Also, the music won&#39;t pause whenever you&#39;re in a menu, reading a book, or talking to an NPC.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation Requirements[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim version 1.9.32.0.8 or greater.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation[/b] \r<br />\r<br />Extract the folder to your main Skyrim folder: jac_customizebardmusic.esp should be in the main data folder and Sound&#92;fx should have a folder named jac.\r<br />\r<br />In the Sound&#92;Fx&#92;jac folder, you&#39;ll find 16 Windows wav files. All of these files are 1 second silent files. To add your own music, you&#39;ll need to create/convert .wav files using the following format: 11025 Hz (352kbps) bit rate and stereo output (can also use mono, but the files are set up as stereo in the CK. Each music file needs to be 3:30 in length, otherwise you&#39;ll have silence if it&#39;s shorter or it&#39;ll be cut off if it&#39;s longer.\r<br />\r<br />After you&#39;ve converted your music files, activate the mod with whatever manager you like or the Skyrim launcher and request a bard to play a specific instrument.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Uninstallation[/b] \r<br />\r<br />Uncheck jac_customizebardmusic.esp. This mod uses no scripts, so deactivating in the middle of a game shouldn&#39;t cause any issues.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Known Issues[/b] \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve tried different bit rates and the 352kbps seems to be the one that Skyrim will play properly. If somebody finds a higher bitrate that works, please let me know.\r<br />\r<br />I couldn&#39;t find a volume control in the CK; so if your music is too loud, you&#39;ll need to use an audio program to lower the volume.\r<br />\r<br />I haven&#39;t tried other file formats because the original songs were wav files. MP3s might work, but they&#39;re untested.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Thanks To[/b] \r<br />\r<br />Bethesda for making the game.\r<br />Elaura for helping me test it.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Change Log[/b]\r<br />\r<br />1.0 Initial release.",
