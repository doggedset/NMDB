  "summary": "Ever thought that some of animals should frenzy and attack anything they see? Then this mod is for you.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod enables many generic animals (Fox, Hare, Cow, Horse (unsaddled), Chicken, Deer, Elk) to all out Frenzy. They will engage and attack any creature near them, including their own kind. This is not a realistic mod, it\\'s just for fun and to switch up your gameplay.\r\n\r\nThis is the first mod I\\'ve released, I plan on making many more. Please provide feedback and ideas. Thank you.",
