  "descriptionHtml": "I liked the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66391/?]Original mod[/url], but there was a concern about deleted dialog topics in that mod's post pages.\n<br />I un-deleted them and set a condition so that they never play (Checks if the player character exists).\n<br />Also updated for SSE (Form 44), since that's what I use.",
