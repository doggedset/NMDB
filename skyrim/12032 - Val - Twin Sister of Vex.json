  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Val - Twin Sister of Vex\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nDate: 03-03-2012\r\nCategory: Saved games\r\nRequirements: None\r\nAuthor(s): c_striker\r\nSource: \r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#00FF00] UPDATE:[/color] I have now released a new mod, \\\"ESP - Expanded Skyrim Presets\\\", which makes Vex (along with 300+ other NPCs) available to play as a preset in the character creation menu. If you\\'d prefer the preset version, which allows you to customize the character or to convert your existing character via the showracemenu console command, you can find the new mod [color=yellow] [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15963&tab=3&navtag=/modules/comments/comments_ajax.php?tid=658266|:|fid=15963] here[/color][/url].\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis is a savegame of my female imperial character Val, who is an identical twin of the NPC Vex.\r\nI thought Vex was the hottest looking NPC in the game and decided to replicate her as a player character. I am making her available in case anyone else feels likewise but doesn\\'t want to go through the tedious process of duplicating her chargen settings.\r\n\r\nThe NPC Vex is a member of the Thieves Guild and can be found hanging out in the Ragged Flagon in Riften. If you haven\\'t already done so I suggest you go check her out. If you find your current Vex attractive then you will find Val attractive (after all, they are identical twins).\r\n \r\nIf you want her to look exactly like the screenshots then you will need to use the same mods I do. But before you go to that trouble, make sure you take a look at your in-game Vex. You might like her looks better, in which case you won\\'t need any other mods.\r\n\r\nRegardless of mod choice, Val and Vex should look identical (unless you previously used an NPC editor to change Vex, in which case all bets are off).\r\n\r\nI have included two save files. One is inside Helgen Keep (just before drawbridge - too late to kill some folks but not too late to track back in case you think I missed some loot). The second is just outside the cave after escaping Helgen Keep.\r\n\r\nIf you like my work, please feel free to check out my other mods:\r\n* \\\"Astrid and Karliah\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=50370\r\n* \\\"Diverse Female Housecarls\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=49520\r\n* \\\"Hroki and Jordis\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=50842\r\n* \\\"Lisette and Muiri\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=51033\r\n\r\n\r\nMods used in the screenshots\r\n============================\r\nFace:\r\n* \\\"Better Females by Bella\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=9747 (\\\"No make up just improved textures\\\" version)\r\n* \\\"Beauty Faces by NecKros\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=6226 (specular map only)\r\n* \\\"No More Blocky Faces\\\" by Xenius: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=13714 (I use version 1.3)\r\nI use a blend of these three mods. Install No More Blocky Faces first, then Bella\\'s mod, then take only the specular map (femalehead_s.dds) from the NecKros mod and use it to replace the one from Bella.\r\nThe specular map is located in the following folder: textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female\r\nEyes:\r\n* \\\"Natural Eyes\\\" by nevenbridge: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=11110\r\nHair:\r\n* \\\"Straight hair retexture\\\" by navetsea: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=13007\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\nManual install\r\n--------------\r\n1.
