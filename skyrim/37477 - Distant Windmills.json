  "descriptionHtml": "One thing that always bugged me was how I can clearly see the windmill a few hundred meters away, but it had no fan rotating. I tried fixing this by raising my uGrids, but that made my game freeze up or crash constantly, even on a New Game. So, I went into the construction kit and checked a few boxes, BAM, I could see windmills off in the distance clear as day. And even at night with my brightness turned up.\r\n\r\nNow, I warn you I have about 15 million mods installed, and I would in no way describe myself as a modder, so I have no idea how well this will work for everyone else. I did only load the skyrim.esm when making it though, so I imagine compatibility is fairly high. Worst case scenario, it wont work and you have to disable it. Don\\'t worry about any new meshes or textures or scripts, I added nothing. All I am is a man who ticked a box, then presented the results for those who were unable to find said box.\r\n\r\n\r\nShare and Enjoy!\r\n~MCJesus",
