They love to collect things and treasures and make the best of it.\r<br />Each has its own range of items, so you should have a look at both of them.\r<br />I didn&#39;t create a new race, they are &#34;pixiefied&#34; Bosmer, who don&#39;t use idle markers and furniture because this would alter their height with odd results.\r<br />Services: 24 hours\r<br />(I wanted Pokk to sell at daytime and Moxx during the night but Moxx lost her merchant dialogue then. Oh wonderful and mysterious world of factions and AI packages ;-))\r<br />\r<br />You can find a more detailed list with the changes and additions in the readme.\r<br />\r<br />------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Issues:\r<br />\r<br />I deleted the backmost chest in the smithy area that was so close to the cavern wall I couldn&#39;t access it anyway (some collision conflict I guess).\r<br />In case you have managed to place something in there, please take it out before installing this mod.\r<br />\r<br />The cavern is sometimes a bit laggy on my newer system now (especially after entering), so it could cause problems on lower end computers.\r<br />It is a new world space containing a big cavern hall full of flora and fauna plus my additions. \r<br />In the end I deleted some insect spawn points and minor details (the vase of flowers for example) to improve performance.\r<br />\r<br />Apart from that there are no other problems or conflicts I am aware of.\r<br />\r<br />Maybe something you should be aware of - there is a dragon mound around the corner, not really far from the cavern entrance.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: None (only pure vanilla Skyrim ;-))\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Recommended Mods \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10652/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D10652] Vanilla Mannequin Script Fix [/url]  by SLuckyD\r<br />(make those creepy manequins stay put&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11370/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D11370] Spouses Can Live Everywhere [/url]  by Amgepo and Emma\r<br />(but I don&#39;t know if it works in a new world space cavern, I hope so)\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4955/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D4955] 83Willows 101BugsHD Butterfly Dragonfly Luna-Moth Torchbug [/url]  by 83Willow\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7315/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D7315] Golden Vendors [/url]  by RivvqPL\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23812/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D23812] ENB: Seasons of Skyrim [/url]  by Bronze316\r<br />But of course there are other beautiful ENB-mods&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Facial and body texture mods which I use and which effects you can see in the screenshots:\r<br />(I am using the following - especially Moxx will look different without them - for the better, the worse, or just different, who knows.)\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D2666] Female body: CBBE [/url]  by Caliente\r<br />(I am still using CBBE V3.1 slim)\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D3563] Female face: Coverwomen [/url]  by mrLenski\r<br />(I am using look #3)\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2464/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D2464] Bright Eyes [/url]  by Skree000\r<br />(I am using the latest version v1-3 for my NPCs)\r<br />\r<br />------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Installation: \r<br />\r<br />NMM or manually:\r<br />Download the file, unpack, and drop the Data folder into your Skyrim folder (which already contains a &#34;Data&#34; folder).\r<br />Overwrite, if asked.
