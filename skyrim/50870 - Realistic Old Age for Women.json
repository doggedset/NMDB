  "descriptionHtml": "This improves the look of the 40 and 50 year old wrinkles for women. Yeah it is a simple mod. I find it surprising that there were no mod that improves the look of wrinkled women in Skyrim. The vanilla textures were not that well defined as they were in low resolution. In doing so I expanded the resolution as well as make the wrinkles as realistic as possible. For I know that 40 to 50 year old women do age with heavy wrinkles but the textures that were used for vanilla were drawn rather than using real life reference. I looked into a lot of 40 and 50 year old women with these wrinkled characteristics. Please endorse and also upload some images. My images are not that good. ",
