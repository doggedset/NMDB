  "summary": "Roast your food over the fire without needing a cooking pot.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][b]What is Roasted Meat?[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Roasted Meat aims at giving Skyrim a little more realism through adding the ability to roast meat over the fire whenever you are near one – without needing a cooking pot.\r<br />It also adds a few recipes without the need of salt, so you won&#39;t have to starve anymore if you have no salt in your backpack.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]How is that done?[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Once you activate the mod, you will get a power that you can use whenever you stand near an open fire. If you use it, a menu, similar to the cooking menu, will open, but it only contains recipes for food that can be roasted, like meat, leek or potatoes. (and maybe some more in the future)\r<br />\r<br />To keep the menu small, every recipe that only contains meat or meat and salt will only appear if you have all the needed ingredients.\r<br />\r<br />For those who only search for no salt recipes, the old versions are still downloadable under old files. (You will however still need a cooking pot for those)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Compatibility:[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />None of the existing Skyrim recipes are changed, so this mod is compatible with everything that adds or changes them.\r<br />It does however only add recipes for the vanilla Skyrim foods.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26228]Realistic Needs And Diseases:[/url]\r<br />This mod was made with Realistic Needs and Diseases in mind so it is fully compatible. Food Spoilage will work with the meat from my mod.\r<br />Make sure to load it after Realistic Needs and Diseases&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/8222270/?][b]animegirl12249[/b] [/url]there is now a Combination Pack for compatibility with more mods&#33;\r<br />The pack currently contains:\r<br />- Roasted Meat for Realistic Needs and Diseases and Frostfall\r<br />- Roasted Meat for Realistic Needs and Diseases, Frostfall and Hunterborn\r<br />\r<br />Please feel free to suggest more combinations if there is something the mod should be made compatible with&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Install:[/b][/size]\r<br />Simply merge the data folder with the data folder in your Skyrim directory.",
