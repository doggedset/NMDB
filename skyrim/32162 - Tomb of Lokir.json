  "descriptionHtml": "I recently decided to begin contributing to the Nexus community, and this is my first piece.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s a simple dungeon created using the Creation Kit wiki tutorial on level design. I am going to tie in a quest soon, and expand the dungeon.\r\n\r\nYou\\'ll find the unique weapon in the back of the dungeon, protected by a mage. (Expert Lockpicking Required)\r\nThere is a cave area with no enemies, however, you\\'ll notice a doorway blocked by stones.\r\n\r\nYou\\'ll have to wait and see what the rest of the dungeon holds :)\r\n\r\nPlease comment with bugs + glitches + suggestions, and I will do my best to get out version 1.0!\r\n\r\nThanks for any support you guys might give me to create the next part of the dungeon (quest included)\r\n\r\n~ halex1316",
