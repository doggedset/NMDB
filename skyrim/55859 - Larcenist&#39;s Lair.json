Its very existence is still disputed to this very day, however, it is said that the lair resides in the city of Riften, and the owner changes hands regularly, due to the theft of the key. Rumors state that, no matter how well you hide or even protect the key, it will be stolen from you.\r<br />\r<br />The lair is said to contain around 60% of all the stolen goods in Riften, Whiterun, Falkreath and Windhelm. It is because of this, that the lair is believed to have secret passages to all of these hold-capitals. Tunnels have been spotted in Windhelm and Whiterun already, however the Jarls have denied all rumors pointing towards the lair, claiming they are old maintenance tunnels, and should not be explored in case of a cave-in. Are the authorities in on it too? \r<br />\r<br />[b][i]- Marcus Hassildor, The Larcenist&#39;s Lair[/i][/b][/quote]\r<br />\r<br />[heading][u] Features [/u][/heading]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Store all of your loot in a quick-to-access space (Doesn&#39;t de-spawn)\r<br />[*] Quickly travel around the nearby holds (Great if you have fast-travel disabled)\r<br />[*] New set of armor to enhance thieving skills\r<br />[*] New player home (Technically speaking)\r<br />[*] Convenient crafting area accessible in 4 holds\r<br />[*] New book (Everyone loves books)\r<br />[*] Lots of loot\r<br />[*] Quickly escape the guards (They will still attempt arrest on your return)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[heading][u] Where to begin[/u][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Start by heading to Riften, if you take a right down the stairs as soon as you enter the city (from the front gate), then you will be taken down to water-level. In the water is the entrance to the lair. It is locked however, and to get the key you will need to use your skills.\r<br />\r<br />Head over to the market in Riften, and look for the stall which contains the book &#34;The Larcenist&#39;s Lair&#34;, in that stall, there is a strongbox which contains the key to the lair, and you will have to pick two locks to get inside, while remaining unseen by the guards and passers-by. Once you have the key, the lair is yours permanently.\r<br />\r<br />[img=center]http://i.imgur.com/mVhXGCo.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />All this mod requires in an up-to-date version of Skyrim.
