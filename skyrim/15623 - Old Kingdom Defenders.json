  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r\n===========\r\n\r\nAdds two companions, one Imperial female and one Redguard female from my new faction, the Old Kingdom Defenders in \r\n\r\nfront of Breezhome in Whiterun. Of course, Old Kingdom refers to Skyrim.  They will come to your aid and follow you \r\n\r\nwhen needed.  You only need but to wear the ring of the Old Kingdom Faction and they will find you.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n==========\r\n\r\n- Once you have purchased Breezhome in Whiterun, you will find \\\"Old Kingdom Defender Ring\\\" on the table to your \r\n\r\nleft as soon as you enter the house.\r\n\r\n- Add the ring to your favorites menu(optional)\r\n\r\n- Whenever you equip the ring, the defenders will follow you, acting as personal guards to the Dovahkiin.(Allow a \r\n\r\nfew seconds or more for the AI to actually recognize and run the process).\r\n\r\n- Get the defenders to go back to Whiterun by unequiping the Old Kingdom Defender Ring. (Again, allow a few \r\n\r\nseconds).\r\n\r\n\r\nBonus!!!\r\n========\r\n\r\nI have also made both of the companions into actual companions, so you don\\'t actually have to use the ring.  You \r\n\r\ncan walk up and talk to one of them and have them follow you \\\"for real\\\" just like any other companion.  Of course, \r\n\r\nthis only works on one companion at a time.  I have not tested my mod with any multiple-companion mods.  Anyway, \r\n\r\nthis can be useful if you\\'d like to only take one of the defenders with you or if you\\'d like to send one home and \r\n\r\nkeep the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation/Uninstallation\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nCopy the contents of this mod\\'s DATA folder into your Skyrim/Data folder, activate the included \\\"Old Kingdom \r\n\r\nDefenders.esp\\\" file.  To uninstall, remove the files.\r\n\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n====\r\n\r\nI have not run into any as of yet, but please let me know if you do.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Info\r\n==========\r\n\r\nI will of course, try to correct any bugs anyone finds, but I may also make updates to this mod in the future that \r\n\r\nmay include new features, more companions, quests, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nSPACEWALK",
