  "descriptionHtml": "The smurfs came to Skyrim and build a small village here.\r\n\r\nAll houses are visitable and you can hire 2 smurfs as follower.\r\n\r\nYou\\'ll find the village when you travel between Helgen and Riverwood.\r\n\r\nOr just leave Riverwood southwards and turn to the left side.\r\n\r\nThis mod is ALPHA, so nothing is finished, polished or perhaps fully playable.\r\n\r\n[b]Requirements[/b]\r\nYou need the Dragonborn DLC!\r\nI used vanilla meshes everywhere and retextured them.\r\n\r\nFAQs:\r\n\r\n- [b]Is it lore-friendly?[/b]\r\n  [i]depends on what you find lore friendly. If fantasy figures are lore-friendly for you, then also this mod is.[/i]\r\n- [b]Do I really shrink, when I enter a smurfhouse?[/b]\r\n  [i]No, some smurfs grow up to your size, that\\'s all.[/i]\r\n\r\n- [b]Some smurfs walk along very slow, when they are inside their houses[/b]\r\n  [i]Nothing here, I can fix, that\\'s the game engine.[/i]\r\n\r\n- [b]What is about Gargamel and Azrael?[/b]\r\n  [i]Not much. I already placed them, but they are no useful NPCs yet.[/i]\r\n\r\n- [b]The houses and the smurfs appear too large for me, could you make them smaller?[/b]\r\n  [i]No, that will not be possible, as I already shrinked them to a size so that they are barely useful. Making them more small would cause more game glitches.[/i]\r\n\r\n",
