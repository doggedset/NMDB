  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6]\r<br />[center][b]Bethany&#39;s Argonian Followers\r<br />[/b][/center]\r<br />[/size][size=3]As a huge fan of the argonian race, I was disappointed with the lack of lovable lizard followers in Skyrim. While I understand this from a lore standpoint, I just want my argonians, dammit&#33; This mod adds several argonian followers and spouses to the game without feeling intrusive, and makes changes to some vanilla npcs.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=3]There are three versions available:\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*][size=3]The [color=#f6b26b][b]Full Version[/b][/color] is standalone and includes vanilla and new NPCs. [/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]The [color=#f6b26b][b]Compatibility Version[/b][/color] is also standalone and only includes new NPCs to maximize compatibility with other mods. [/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]The [color=#f6b26b][b]Dawnguard Followers[/b][/color] version requires the Dawnguard DLC and the Full Version file. [/size]\r<br />[/list][/size][center][b][size=4]\r<br />Version 2.0 is here&#33;[/size][/b][/center]Thanks to Ethrobya100 and Noctum28 for bringing bugs and suggestions to my attention. See changelog for more info.\r<br />[list]\r<br />[/list][center][/center][center][b][size=4]Vanilla NPCs[/size]\r<br />[/b][/center][list]\r<br />[*][size=3]Fans of the Dark Brotherhood might know [b][color=#93c47d]Deekus[/color] [/b]better as &#34;the guy I talked to for a few seconds before murdering.&#34; He specializes in light armor and one handed weapons, and can be found near Hela&#39;s Folly.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][b][color=#93c47d]Wujeeta [/color][/b]can be found near the Riften Fishery, begging for help with her skooma addiction. You help the lady out, save her from losing her job... and then what? Nothing? Unacceptable&#33; Now the lovely lizard lass can be married.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Behold, [b][color=#93c47d]Derkeethus[/color][/b]: the only vanilla argonian follower&#33; Before, he looked... rather [s]insane[/s] unpleasant. I&#39;ve changed his expression from afraid to happy, given him a much needed nose job, and made other minor changes. He now wears fur armor like a proper adventurer and is best suited for ranged weapons.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]As a light armor trainer, a quest-giver, and a spouse, I&#39;ve wanted [b][color=#93c47d]Scouts-Many-Marshes[/color][/b] as a follower for awhile. Well, now he can scout some actual marshes with you&#33; He is most effective with ranged weapons and will not alert enemies or trigger traps.[/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[center][size=4][b]New NPCs\r<br />[/b][/size][/center][list]\r<br />[*][size=3][b][color=#93c47d]Indazara [/color][/b]is a young destruction mage who can be found inside the argonian assemblage in Windhelm. He is marriageable as well as being a follower. [/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][b][color=#93c47d]Reei-Ja[/color][/b] is a spellsword who can be found by the Windhelm docks. She is best with one-handed weapons and heavy armor, and knows some spells. Because there&#39;s no follower dialogue for the female argonian voicetype, I chose the even-toned voice for her. That&#39;s okay; the lady lizards in this game sound like chainsmokers.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][b][color=#93c47d]Picks-Many-Pockets[/color][/b] is a sneaky follower and spouse. She is equipped with standard thief gear and a dagger, and can be found hanging out in the Bee and Barb.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][b][color=#93c47d]Uta-Ra[/color][/b] (DG) can be found in Fort Dawnguard. He wears light armor and uses an axe and shield.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][b][color=#93c47d]Neetra [/color][/b](DG) is a vampire who specializes in destruction and conjuration magic. You can find her at Castle Volkihar.[/size]\r<br />[/list][size=3]\r<br />Because the Dawnguard quest is set to start when the player reaches level 10, the DG followers will begin at this level. If you use an alternate start mod to join the Volkihar or Dawnguard factions early, they might be overpowered. You&#39;ve been warned&#33;\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[center][size=4]\r<br />[b]Credits[/b][/size][b]\r<br />[/b][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55707]Argonian Fins by Chilean Wolf[/url]\r<br />[/size][size=4]\r<br />[b]My Other Mods\r<br />[/b][/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84998?]Argonian Racemenu Preset[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84999/?]Nord Racemenu Preset[/url][/center][center][/center][center][size=4]\r<br />[b]Recommended mods[/b][/size][/center][list]\r<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17339]BAT - Bigger Argonian Tails[/url] - Pretty self explanatory, now your tail won&#39;t look like it&#39;s coming out of the wrong place. If you have [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]Racemenu[/url], you can do this on your own when you create your character.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70164]Masculine[/url]/[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62574]Feminine [/url]Argonian Textures. The male version is for vanilla and SOS bodies, while the female works with vanilla, CBBE, or UNP. [/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58745/?]Better Argonian 4K[/url]. These are the textures I used in the screenshots.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55707]Argonian Fins[/url] - Do you miss Morrowind&#39;s customization options for argonians? Now your scaly hero can finally have those sweet fins and ridges. [/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54586]Dread Tentacles - HDT Enabled Hair for Argonians[/url] - This is one of my favourite argonian mods. Requires [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53996]HDT Physics Extensions[/url].  [/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27676]AMA - Argonian Mercenary Armor[/url] - An armor mod made specifically for argonians? What?&#33; This armor comes in light and heavy versions and is visually similar to the daedric armor. Look, dude, it has an armored tail. All you need to know. :) [/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26671]My little hatchling Ram-Ku[/url] - An adorable, adoptable hatchling located in Dawnstar. What I love about him is that he&#39;s not just a downscaled adult argonian -- he has his own skeleton, meshes, and textures to make him really look like a child. Definitely a must-have if you want to adopt.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/?]Alternate Start[/url] - I suspect most Skyrim players are already using this mod. One of the alternate starts lets you start as a member of the argonian assemblage in Windhelm, which will allow you earlier access to some of the followers.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52871/?]Socko&#39;s Guild Starter[/url] - Rescue the argonians from the assemblage by sending them to a guild location of your choice. Build a faction entirely made of argonians. The world is your oyster.[/size]\r<br />[/list]",
