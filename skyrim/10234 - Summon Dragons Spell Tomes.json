IT\\'S NOT!!!!\r\nthe buying of the spell tomes isn\\'t simple...\r\n(load the esp-s 1 by 1) .....first load alduin and then buy the tome ingame and ,,read\\'\\' it......then do the same for paarthurnax but keep alduin on......and for the other dragons it\\'s the same thing....but do not turn off the other esp-s the spells will disapear form your inventory....i am now doing 1 esp for all the tomes......i will upload it when i finish and test it\r\n\r\nThis Mod Will Have Updates.........Comment me if you have any requests   :D",
