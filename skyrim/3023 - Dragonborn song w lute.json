  "descriptionHtml": "SONG CREDIT:  Malufenix (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z9TdDCWN7g)\r\n\r\nWhen I first heard this cover, tears began to well in my eyes...I knew then that I must hear it while playing Skyrim. Replacement of a bard song was the perfect place to start, and after some searching, I found a mod here (http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2539). \r\nThat basically did what I want, however, the lip sync was totally off for me (I found that each sentence of the song is its own .fuz file). So, I cut the cover song into 8 sentences and added a tiny fade out to the end of each bit. Then put it all together with doubled up vocals at the end for added epicness ;)\r\n\r\nAfter a handy comment from elite403, I was able to merge it with another mod from STSG (http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2842). This adds the lute actions into the mix :O\r\n\r\nHope you all enjoy :)\r\nEndorse and comment!\r\nCarpe Diem",
