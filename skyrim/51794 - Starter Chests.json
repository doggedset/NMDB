  "summary": "A mod that adds two chests to Helgen Keep and another behind the Guardian Stones. The Helgen chests contain enough items to make the first quest easier and faster, while the chest behind the Guardian Stones contains a selection of gems, ingots, soul gems, spell tomes, enchantments and gold to give you a headstart on your new game.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a chest two chests in Helgen Keep (one in each entrance so it doesn&#39;t matter if you start a game as an Imperial or Stormcloak) and a chest hidden behind the Guardian stones. \r<br />The Helgen chests both contain armor, weapons and robes to make your start to the game easier and faster, something which appealed to me having started so many new games. \r<br />The dwarven chest behind the Guardian Stones contains a variety of ingots, gems, enchantments, soul gems and spell tomes that could be very useful to somebody starting a new game. \r<br />\r<br />I haven&#39;t added anything that is majorly overpowered, just enough to allow you to begin a new game with a little bit of a head start.",
