  "summary": "Adds the ability to forge your own Lunar weapons at the Silent Moons Forge like the diary in the original game suggests.",
  "descriptionHtml": "=================================================\r\nDetails:\r\nThis mod that fixes what Bethesda appears to have left out of the original game. A diary at The Silent Moons Camp gives the impression that it is supposed to have a unique forge that gives a special \\\"vampire-like\\\" enchantment to weapons when they are forged there. The game has 4 \\\"Lunar\\\" weapons that have that enchantment, but lacks a way to create these weapons yourself (short of disenchanting them). \r\n\r\nWhat this mod does is make it so when you craft a weapon at the forge in Silent Moons Camp, the weapon will have this Enchantment; say you wanted a Lunar Daedric Sword, you\\'d gather the appropriate components to create a Daedric sword, but instead of crafting it where you normally would, fast-travel to Silent Moons camp and forge it there, no additional components required.\r\n\r\nEach enchantment is varied based on the type of weapon. Higher leveled types (Such as Daedric and Glass) have a stronger enchantment damage and additional enchantment points, while heavier and stronger weapons, such as Battleaxes and Greatswords, have even more additional enchantment points. I included an Excel sheet in the downloads/files that shows how I calculated values for each weapon. \r\n\r\nLunar forging only works at night (to stay true to what the original game suggests), and it is impossible to forge regular weapons at that forge at night. I figured that since it\\'s due to an \\\"unknown cause,\\\" how would the adventurer be able to toggle the enchantment?\r\n==================================================\r\nUpdate log \r\nFebruary 12, 2012 - Version 1.0 - Initial release\r\nFebruary 14, 2012 - Version 1.1 - Made it so that the forge only makes Lunar weapons at night, while only making regular weapons during the day. \r\nFebruary 14, 2012 - Version 1.2 - Bug Fixes\r\n==================================================\r\nPossible plans for future versions:\r\n1) Adding a special component to be required to forge this weapon, like a new ore or something.\r\n2) Require a perk that you get through a short quest to make you \\\"learn\\\" how to make these weapons\r\n==================================================\r\nDownloads - Mediafire via Adf.ly:\r\nVersion 1.0 - http://adf.ly/5RRWb\r\nVersion 1.1 - http://adf.ly/5Tula\r\nVersion 1.2 - http://adf.ly/5UYlB\r\n==================================================\r\nLinks:\r\nWebsite: http://penguinchao.tripod.com\r\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/penguinchao\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/#!/Penguinchao\r\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Penguinchao/221954228531\r\n==================================================\r\n\r\nCheck back on my Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Website, or the Nexus for any updates or New Mods that I release! (I plan to have a Youtube video up asap)\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to leave feeback to let me know if there\\'s anything you think I should change/add to this mod and if you think the possible future plans are good or bad.",
