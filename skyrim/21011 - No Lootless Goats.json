  "summary": "Fixes the death item leveled list for goats so they no longer will have nothing on them a large percentage of the time.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I made this mod several weeks ago for myself, but I figured I would share it.\r\n\r\nIt fixes the death item leveled list for goats so that it is inline with other death item leveled lists like those for wolves and deer.  This way you will frequently get a hide and/or leg when looting goats, rather than nothing.\r\n\r\nWARNING: Do not use this with Hearthfire, it fixes this bug and adds additional loot to goats that you can never get if you have this mod enabled.",
