  "descriptionHtml": "If you&#39;re like me, you&#39;ve been playing Skyrim for a while. After my 800th or so playthrough, I kinda got sick of the grind, and just wanted a super character\r<br />from the get go. This problem was slightly fixed when I found Adrianus92&#39;s mod Max Skills and All Perks - FOMod Install (found here http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48858/?) my problem was almost resolved. However, I still had to manually balance out my health, \r<br />magicka, stamina, carry weight, and shout cool down stats. So, I created these 2 little files to do it for me.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\r<br />1. Manually install the two files, and drop them into your Skyrim Data folder.\r<br />That&#39;s it.\r<br />\r<br />USAGE IN GAME\r<br />1. Open the console (~)\r<br />2. If using Adrianus92&#39;s mod in conjunction with this mod, use his command first. If not, go to step 3.\r<br />3. Type in &#34;bat setskill&#34; without the quotation marks.\r<br />4. Follow up on that command with &#34;bat forceskill&#34; this will lock the stats in place. (They won&#39;t revert when loading a save)\r<br />\r<br />And that should be it. I&#39;m new to the Nexus, at least on the uploader side of things, but I hope you enjoy the little cheat.\r<br />Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year&#33;",
