  "descriptionHtml": "This is probably the millionth mod like this, it just puts a chest with equipment to help get a new game started in Riverwood. You&#39;ll find it on the arch thing you go under with the Imperial/Stormcloak solder when you start the game. The chest itself contains several weapons, potions, some soul gems, 250 Gold, armor both heavy and light, basic material to upgrade low-level weapons and armor, and spell tomes for each magic school. Due to the way I put in the items I can&#39;t be more specific then that (with the exception of the tomes for destruction and restoration magic, you&#39;ll get frostbite and lesser ward... I didn&#39;t want to run the risk of you getting some BS like a flames tome.). And I don&#39;t think this chest will respawn so it [i]should [/i]be a safe place to horde items until you can get a house for a proper intervention like a civilized person. See screenshots if you&#39;re having trouble finding the chest. \r<br />\r<br />Download and installation:\r<br />   download the mod with the manual download button; you should get a .zip, take that .zip and open NMM, when that opens drag and drop the .zip into the mod manager with the rest of your mods and it should install, after which it should work like any other mod. \r<br />\r<br />Change: \r<br />   Added a strongbox in the Riverwood Trader with basic weapon, armor, and jewelry enchantments in the &#34;Mage Starting Gear&#34; file. Both are standalone. You won&#39;t need to worry about taking anything out of the strongbox; you can get into it without it being considered theft. ",
