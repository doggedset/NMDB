  "descriptionHtml": "The Emperor&#39;s Will and Stormlord Armors... works of art&#33;  My only complaint was that they were replacers, so I made them standalone... mainly due to the fact that I like their vanilla armors, too.  So I wanted to keep them.\r<br />\r<br />Both armors are worn by only one man, the respective generals of each side of the civil war, General Tullius and Galmar Stone-Fist.  I didn&#39;t put the Stormlord on Ulfric because I like his vanilla outfit.  (Hey, I don&#39;t like the guy, personally... but I gotta admit, he&#39;s a snazzy dresser.)\r<br />\r<br />Now I know what you&#39;re probably going to ask: &#34;If General Tullius&#39; vanilla armor was only worn by him, then why make the Emperor&#39;s Will Armor standalone anyway?&#34;  Good point&#33;\r<br />\r<br />So how did I keep the vanilla armor in the game?  I gave it to the Legates&#33;  Now Legate Rikke and her equals in rank wear General Tullius&#39; vanilla armor, which I renamed the Imperial Legate&#39;s Armor.  Now they can distinguish themselves from the lower officers in the Legion.\r<br />\r<br />And if you want these armors for yourself, you can buy them from Beirand, along with the General&#39;s weapons Emperor&#39;s Wrath and Emperor&#39;s Great Wrath.\r<br />\r<br />As for the Stormlord Armor... it, too, no longer replaces the Stormcloak Officer&#39;s Armor, so all the Stormblades will still be wearing the vanilla armor.  You can also buy these armors from Oengul War-Anvil.\r<br />\r<br />I also took the liberty of adding the regular armors and weapons to the sales inventories of their respective blacksmiths.  I never really understood why Beirand would tell you that if you got your armor destroyed, that you have to buy a new one like everyone else since their wasn&#39;t any Imperial armors in his inventory.  So, I fixed that.\r<br />\r<br />BTW, if you want the Legate&#39;s Armor to look like it does in the pics, you&#39;ll have to download the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34321/?]Virtus Imperii - Imperial Gear Re-mastered[/url].  The Stormcloak Officer&#39;s, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45692/?]aMidianBorn stormcloak officer armour[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Also, the two armors are in separate mods.  So if you want them both, you have to download them separately.\r<br />\r<br />Many thanks to gechbal for making these awesome armors and letting me release these mods.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />Get gechbal&#39;s original mods [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/46672/?]here[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40216/?]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE:  People kept asking for them, so I made craftable versions.  The requirements for them are the same as the original mods.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE AGAIN:  I fixed the smithing lists.  Certain parts were appearing in different lists at the forge.  So now, all the Emperor&#39;s Will parts are under Imperial, and all the Stormlord parts are under Miscellaneous.\r<br />\r<br />YET ANOTHER UPDATE:  Had to fix the stats of the armors.  Now they&#39;re equivalent to gechbal&#39;s original stats.\r<br />\r<br />ONCE AGAIN:  Made Emperor&#39;s Wrath and Emperor&#39;s Great Wrath temperable.",
