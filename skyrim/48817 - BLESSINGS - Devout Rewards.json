  "descriptionHtml": "BLESSINGS - Devout Rewards\r<br />\r<br />A Blessing overhaul.\r<br />\r<br />This mod enhances the Divines Blessing system by increasing the strength and duration of bonuses, and adding new bonuses if you continue to use the same Divine for your blessings.\r<br />\r<br />Example:\r<br />Talos&#39;s blessing will give a bonus of -10% shout recovery time, lasting for 12 hours, when the blessing expires return to a Shrine of Talos and still only receive a bonus of -10% shout recovery time. But then&#33; ..return a third time and his blessing will have increased to -12%, then -14%, and so on. After a few more bonus increases, the blessing will become -20% shout recovery AND +10% one-handed damage lasting for a day, then -22% shout recovery AND +12% one-handed damage, and so on. His &#39;ultimate&#39; blessing for the truly devout follower will bestow -30% shout recovery time, +20% one-handed damage AND +15% critical hit chance lasting for 7 WHOLE DAYS&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Affected blessings are: Akatosh, Arkay, Dibella, Julianos, Kynareth, Mara, Nocturnal, Stendarr, Talos and Zenithar.\r<br />\r<br />For you to prove your faith, the blessings must be allowed to run their course. Spamming the shrines will result in your &#39;faith&#39; decreasing. I have allowed a small grace period allowing you to renew the blessings if around an hour or so is left before the last blessing expires. ALSO&#33; using the shrine of another Divine will reset your faith with the previous one&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Disclaimer:\r<br />I have tested this mod to the best of my (patience) abilities and everything looks perfect, but I am releasing it as a BETA version just in case anybody finds flaws in the mod - FEEDBACK WOULD BE GREAT&#33;&#33; (please)\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts:\r<br />Anything that modifies the Divine Blessings&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Extract, place in data folder, blah blah.\r<br />Or use Nexus Mod Manager&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />Not recommended, papyrus might cry :(\r<br />Or use Nexus Mod Manager&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; (papyrus may still cry)\r<br />\r<br />A detailed spreadsheet with all the blessings and bonus %&#39;s is included in the 7z file.\r<br />\r<br />Changelog v1.1\r<br />\r<br />- Shuffled a few blessing effects around to be a little more lore friendly (Thanx to Cliven for some good thinking).\r<br />\r<br />- Kynareth&#39;s final blessing now grants a spell that gives a short burst of speed and allows the player to walk on water.\r<br />\r<br />- Players will now be given a message when their blessing is due to expire in one hour (at this point players can have their blessings renewed without the &#39;reduced faith spam effect&#39;)\r<br />",
