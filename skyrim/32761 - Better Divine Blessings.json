  "descriptionHtml": "[heading]This mod is intended for Skyrim version 1.9.32.0.8 or higher. Older versions of Skyrim might not work with this mod.[/heading]\n<br />The Better Divine Blessings mod was created to address a glaring flaw in Skyrim; the blessings of the divines, and their associated amulets, are lackluster at best - utterly laughable at worst. Even if their blessings and amulets were made intentionally weak as a matter of keeping with the Elder Scrolls lore, I feel as though it's taken too far in Skyrim. Players have precious little reason to ever get divine blessings, let alone use their amulets, and when they do it's often only one or two of them. Off the top of my head, the only blessings and amulets I ever really used in vanilla Skyrim are the Talos and Zenithar blessings and that's pretty much it; the others aren't even worth bothering with.\n<br />\n<br />While I've taken considerable time during the development of this mod to consider the various effects I've now assigned to the blessings and their amulets as well as reading up on the Elder Scrolls lore so that they would fit in line with what could be expected of each particular divine, the effects are not necessarily final; I'm open to suggestions for improvements to these effects and other suggestions for improving this mod, and I implore anyone who reads this and has some thoughts or ideas on the matter to let me know in the comments section. If some effect is too strong, too weak, doesn't make sense for that divine, would make sense on a different divine's blessing, or you have ideas for other effects that should be on a divine, or ones that should be removed, etc etc, please let me know. It's my hope that I've already come up with a good setup, but I feel that there is always room for improvement.\n<br />\n<br />This mod was also created with compatibility in mind; no new scripts are added to the game by this mod, as those create considerable save file and compatibility problems - particularly if or when you decide to stop using a mod. To the best of my knowledge, the design of this mod is such that it can be easily installed and uninstalled with no ill effects on one's save files.\n<br />\n<br />The changes to the nine divine blessings and amulets of Skyrim as implemented by this mod are described below:\n<br />[heading]Akatosh[/heading]\n<br />Blessing of Akatosh:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Magicka regenerates 20% faster.\n<br />[*] Shout cooldowns are reduced by 20%.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Amulet of Akatosh:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Magicka regenerates 20% faster.\n<br />[*] Shout cooldowns are reduced by 20%.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Set bonus effect: \"Follower of Akatosh\"\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] You move 10% faster.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[heading]Arkay[/heading]\n<br />Blessing of Arkay:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Health +25.\n<br />[*] Your attacks and spells are 10% stronger against the undead.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Amulet of Arkay:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Health +25.\n<br />[*] Your attacks and spells are 10% stronger against the undead.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Set bonus effect: \"Follower of Arkay\"\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Your attacks and spells are 20% stronger against the undead.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[heading]Dibella[/heading]\n<br />Blessing of Dibella:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Persuasion +15.\n<br />[*] Illusion spells cost 15% less to cast.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Amulet of Dibella:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Persuasion +15.\n<br />[*] Illusion spells cost 15% less to cast.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Set bonus effect: \"Follower of Dibella\"\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Illusion spells are 30% stronger.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[heading]Julianos[/heading]\n<br />Blessing of Julianos:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Magicka +25.\n<br />[*] All spells cost 10% less to cast.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Amulet of Julianos:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Magicka +25.\n<br />[*] All spells cost 10% less to cast.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Set bonus effect: \"Follower of Julianos\"\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] +10% chance of absorbing incoming spells.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[heading]Kynareth[/heading]\n<br />Blessing of Kynareth:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Stamina +25.\n<br />[*] Shout cooldowns are reduced by 20%.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Amulet of Kynareth:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Stamina +25.\n<br />[*] Shout cooldowns are reduced by 20%.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Set bonus effect: \"Follower of Kynareth\"\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Shouts are 50% stronger.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[heading]Mara[/heading]\n<br />Blessing of Mara:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Restoration spells cost 15% less to cast.\n<br />[*] All skills improve 5% faster.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Amulet of Mara:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Restoration spells cost 15% less to cast.\n<br />[*] All skills improve 5% faster.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Set bonus effect: \"Follower of Mara\"\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Restoration spells are 30% stronger.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[heading]Stendarr[/heading]\n<br />Blessing of Stendarr:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Blocking absorbs 10% more damage.\n<br />[*] Disease Resistance +25%.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Amulet of Stendarr:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Blocking absorbs 10% more damage.\n<br />[*] Disease Resistance +25%.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Set bonus effect: \"Follower of Stendarr\"\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Restoration spells are 20% stronger.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[heading]Talos[/heading]\n<br />Blessing of Talos:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Shout cooldowns are reduced by 20%.\n<br />[*] All combat skills improve 5% faster.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Amulet of Talos:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Shout cooldowns are reduced by 20%.\n<br />[*] All combat skills improve 5% faster.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Set bonus effect: \"Follower of Talos\"\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Your physical attacks are 10% stronger.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[heading]Zenithar[/heading]\n<br />Blessing of Zenithar:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Prices are 10% better.\n<br />[*] Weapons and armor can be improved 10% better.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Amulet of Zenithar:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Prices are 10% better.\n<br />[*] Weapons and armor can be improved 10% better.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Set bonus effect: \"Follower of Zenithar\"\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Maces and warhammers are 20% stronger.\n<br />[/list][line]\n<br />Additionally, all of the amulets of the divines now have the same base value of 200 gold (20 from the amulet, 180 from the enchantment); base value being the item's value [i]before[/i] merchant speech penalties and other modifiers take effect. This was done to fix multiple bugs as well as make all of the amulets of the divines equally as accessible to new(er) characters.\n<br />\n<br />The descriptions attached to the various shrines themselves have also been changed to include an informative summary of the blessing's effects. This should be particularly helpful to anyone that has difficulty remembering the effects of each shrine's blessing.\n<br />[heading]Save-file Preparation Instructions[/heading]\n<br />While this is a highly compatible mod, there are still explicit steps that should be followed whenever you install, uninstall, or update this mod to a newer version. This is because the overall internal arrangement of the effects of each blessing and amulet is different from the vanilla defaults, and also because those internal arrangements might change between different versions of this mod. Following these steps will help you avoid corrupting your save files:\n<br />\n<br />1) Remove any divine amulet you are wearing.\n<br />2) Use the console to clear all active effects on the player with the command \"player.dispelallspells\".\n<br />3) Save your prepared save file, then continue your installation, uninstallation, or updating of the mod as usual.\n<br />[heading]Installation:[/heading]\n<br />Either use a mod manager (such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/]Mod Organizer[/url]), or copy Better_Divine_Blessings.esp into the Data subfolder of your Skyrim installation directory and then enable it in the launcher.\n<br />[heading]Uninstallation:[/heading]\n<br />Either remove/disable it in your mod manager, or delete Better_Divine_Blessings.esp from the Data subfolder of your Skyrim installation directory.\n<br />[heading]Divine blessing (Auriel's blessing) added by the Dawnguard DLC[/heading]\n<br />I am aware of the divine blessing that was added by the Dawnguard DLC and will eventually release a version of this mod containing changes for that blessing.\n<br />[heading]Permissions[/heading]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]You may not upload this mod to other sites without my permission.\n<br />[*]You may not distribute this mod without my permission.\n<br />[*]You may not include this mod, in whole or in part, inside or alongside other mods without my permission.\n<br />[*]You may not release altered versions of this mod without my permission.\n<br />[*]You may not release translated versions of this mod without my permission.\n<br />[*]If I have not noted something here regarding my mod as needing my permission that does [b][u]not[/u][/b] mean you don't need my permission for it. When in doubt, ask me directly via Personal Message.\n<br />[/list][line]\n<br />Well, that's about all there is to say about this mod for now. If you have other thoughts or suggestions or happen to find any bugs that I missed, please let me know in the comments section.\n<br />\n<br />My other mods:\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32284]Hoodswap[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32422]College of Winterhold Shop Fixes - Mage Hoods - Robes - Gloves - Boots - Psiijic - Etc[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32817]Silda the Unseen Master[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33016]Better Daedric Blessings[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33062]Unleveled Skyrim Items[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33069]Unleveled Dragonborn Items[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33135]Gemstone Recovery[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33326]Better Imperial Luck[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33614]Better Standing Stones[/url]",
