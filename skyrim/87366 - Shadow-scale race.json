  "descriptionHtml": "[b][i]This [/i]is a new race and does not replace or modify Argonians in any way. \r<br />\r<br />Shadowscales are Argonians born under the sign of The Shadow in Black Marsh. They are trained from childhood in the art of stealth and combat. &gt;Shadowscales serve their province as assassins. They have historically been used by the King of Argonia as a means to end conflicts and wars without major bloodshed, and to gather information on potential foes. \r<br />\r<br />I have just improved that vanilla Argonian skills to make him a great assassin while trying to keep the race balanced \r<br />and I have given him two new spells I hope you guys enjoy the mod hopefully I will make more in the future.[/b]",
