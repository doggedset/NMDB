  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=orange][b]New version 2 relased!!![/b][/color][/heading]\r\n[color=red]Permission notes have changed![/color]\r\n[line]\r\n\r\nThis is a simple mod which replace septims found in dungeons and dwemer ruins by ancient nord coins dwemer coin, respectively.\r\n\r\nI just created two new coin items using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/258945]InsanitySorrow[/url] meshes and textures. I had to edit meshes to make them standalone. \r\nI also included a optional alternative texture for dwemer coin - a simple bronze recolor. \r\n\r\nIt\\'s highly advisable to download mods of the original author and endorse his works.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15513]Insanitys Celtic Coin[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33812]Insanitys Dwemer Coin[/url]\r\n\r\nFor septims i suggest using this retexture: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1299]Gold Coin Replacer[/url]\r\n[line]\r\n[b][color=teal]With this mod you will find:[/color][/b]\r\nAncient Nord Coins and Ancient Nord Coin Purses lying in Nord dungeons and barrows, in draug corpses, draug chests and in burial urns.\r\nDwemer Coins and Dwemer Coin Purses lying in dwemer ruins, insidide dwemer chest, in falmer corpses and falmer chests.\r\n\r\n[b][color=yellow]Replacer version[/color][/b]\r\nThis version is for people who don\\'t want to mess up too  much in vanilla game.\r\nIt replaces the coins, which can be found in the Nord dungeons and dwarven ruins. Including coin purses.\r\nIn other words, \\\"new\\\" coins can be found at the same amount and in the same locations like septims before. They also have the same value of 1. So you can earn the same amount of money that you could earn before installing this mod.\r\nThus you will find:\r\n- Ancient Nord Coins and Ancient Nord Coin Purses lying in Nord dungeons and barrows, in draug corpses, draug chests and in burial urns.\r\n- Dwemer Coins and Dwemer Coin Purses lying in dwemer ruins, insidide dwemer chest, in falmer corpses and falmer chests.\r\nAll what have to be done is to exchange them for septims in merchants.\r\n\r\n[b][color=yellow]Immersive version[/color][/b]\r\nThis version is for people who want a better immersion in the game.\r\nIt is similar to replacer version but.\r\n[b]Changes made:[/b]\r\n**[b]For Ancient Nord Coins.[/b]\r\n[i](These coins should be quite common and not too valuable because there is a lot of abandoned draug dungeons that are mainly burial sites where are also precious belongings of buried Nords)[/i]\r\n- Increased value from 1 to 4.\r\n- Reduced amount of coins found in draug corpses.\r\n- Reduced amount of coins found in draug chests.\r\n- Reduced amount of coins found inside urns.\r\n- Slightly reduced amount of coins added by ancient Nord coin purses.\r\n[i]None of coins and purses lying on the ground were removed, because they rarely can be found there anyway.\r\nI found only two locations where is a lot of coins in one place, but let it be a reward for finding the treasure.[/i]\r\n\r\n**[b]For Dwemer Coins.[/b]\r\n[i](these coins should be very rare, and they actually are, at least those what can be found on ground. Therefore they should be much more valuable.)[/i]\r\n- Increased value from 1 to 12.\r\n- Now there is only small chance to find only few dwemer coins in falmer corpses and chests. Septims are more common. [i](maybe I will reduce their amount too)[/i]\r\n- In falmer boss chests septims can be found again with small chance to find a few dwemer coins too.\r\n- Reduced amount of coins found in dwemer chests and furniture.\r\n- Slightly reduced amount of coins added by dwemer coin purses. [i](In all ruins only few can be found)[/i]\r\n\r\n_________________________________\r\n[i]The changes also apply to the chance of finding coins with active abilities like \\\"golden touch\\\" and \\\"imperial luck\\\".[/i]\r\n[line]\r\n[b]To do list:[/b]\r\n* Make Dawnguard patch (if needed).\r\n* Add merchants who will buy these coins at a better prices.\r\n\r\n* Maybe new mod which will remove fresh food from ruins and dungeons.\r\n[line]\r\n[color=green]Instalation:[/color]\r\nSimply unzip and copy to your Skyrim installation folder and allow to merge data folder. Make save outside any Nord dungeon or Dwemer ruin. Activate coins.esp in your favorite mod manager. Enjoy. Endorse, if you like it.\r\n\r\n[color=green]Requirements:[/color]\r\nNone, this mod only uses skyrim.esm at this stage of work. Dawnguard seems to use the same leveled lists, so the mod is compatible with this DLC.\r\n[line]\r\nIs this mod balanced?\r\nI don\\'t know, I hope that someone can check it out. I had no time and I won\\'t have it to test in coming days.\r\nThat is why I tried to relase it as soon as possible. So this mod requires some testing.\r\nIf someone find place where coins should be but they don\\'t. Please let me know.\r\nAlso if someone find these coins where they shouldn\\'t be. Or if found other bugs.\r\n[line]\r\n[b][color=orange]Permission note:[/color][/b]\r\nSince this time I did a lot of work I would like that someone who will edit my mod will also credit me. But still I don\\'t require to ask me for permission.\r\nOld version can be freely used without permission nor credits given.\r\nYou still have to credit InsanitySorrow if you decide to use his meshes and textures for coins.",
