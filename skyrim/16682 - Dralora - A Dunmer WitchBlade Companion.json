  "summary": "Dralora is a level 35 WitchBlade located in Kynesgrove near the campsite or inside the Inn.

  "descriptionHtml": "Dralora - A Dunmer WitchBlade Companion\r\n\r\nUpdate: My apologies, I forgot to include a key link to making your Dralora look the same in my screenies. You must used the Realistic Eyes mod for her white eye balls and red pupils. The link is below.  \r\n\r\nI have worked on her for nearly 40 hours over the last several days. It was my hope to make a unique looking attractive dark elf and removing the default Vanilla alien look (like she might try and probe your poop shoot the minute you fall asleep ala Roswell abduction look). I started with Karliah as a base figure and worked from there. \r\n\r\nShe uses conjuring familiar, flame cloak , incinerate, healing and Iron flesh. Her flame cloak will take your health down if you stand too close to her or let her run up on you. I wanted a companion that was a bit more of a challenge. You definitely will have to stay on your toes when she lights up on the attack. Dralora is a level 35 WitchBlade located in Kynesgrove near the campsite or inside the Inn. Should all else fail she will dual wield blades and has excellent archery skills. She also uses a couple stealth perks like Light Foot and will not trip pressure plates.\r\n\r\n***Make sure you have the NEWEST version of ApachiiSkyHair! ApachiiSkyHair_v_1_2!*** \r\n\r\nShe is equipped with two Iron Daggers and no clothes \\\"Nude\\\"! Note: Using the console command equipitem (item number) 1 will permanently add armor unless you use removeitem to reverse it.\r\nShe is approximately 5\\'6\\\" and 110 to 120 pounds.\r\nShe is non-essential and can be married\r\nCustom hair, skin and makeup \\\"coloring\\\" by me.***I had to adjust this particular Apachii Hairstyle Several times so that seams and hair clipping through her ears weren\\'t an issue.\r\nVoice: Female Sultry \r\n\r\nFor Dralora to appear as she does in my images use the following mods;\r\n\r\nRealistic Eyes: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3566\r\nBella\\'s Better Faces with Makeup version 1:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\nCBBEv3 with Navetseas CBBEv3 body texture (feminine arms and toned abs). (Will work with all bodies!) http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6554\r\nEyebrows: Calientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- Darker Feminine Brows D/L\r\n***Required***Human eyes for Elves by Porcelyn: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=195\r\nPretty Lips by Danariel: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1167\r\n***Required***ApachiiSkyHair: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\n\r\nI have her wearing \r\n\r\nRemodeled Armor CBBEv3M by MAK: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13004\r\nBandolier - Bags and Pouches by Dragten\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16438\r\nWeapons from Bobs Armory: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12060\r\n\r\nTo Sandbox at her current location: \r\n\r\nFirst make her your follower and do a new save game!!! \r\nNext DL the NPC EDITOR http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4554 select load from file and click on Dralora\\'s esp file. Once it is open then go to AI packages and remove her Kynesgrove Sandbox If visible, if not continue on to the next step... Select from the drop-down in AI and add (DefaultStayAtCurrentLocation) and (DefaultSandboxCurrentLocation256) then click save as. You will have to go to the Skyrim data folder and then save over the existing file. Now she will stay where ever you leave her. This whole process takes all of about 2 minutes if that!\r\n\r\n(I am unsure what she will do if you marry her and unfortunately I don\\'t want to give up my game wife to find out :D) \r\n\r\n\r\nHelpful Console Commands: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Console \r\n\r\nAs always endorsements are much appreciated. I also love seeing pics and hearing feedback on my mods.\r\n\r\nEnjoy! :) \r\n\r\nFB",
