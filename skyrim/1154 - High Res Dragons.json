  "descriptionHtml": "I was pretty disappointed with the resolution of the dragon textures in the game, considering just how large the models are. I decided to double the resolution of all dragon textures in the game. They were not just rescaled and resaved. I spent a lot of time making sure that additional detail was added instead of just blowing them up and making them blurry. I also decided to punch up the color contrast so that all of the dragons really pop against the background environments. The color changes seem somewhat drastic in the preview images but I assure you they look excellent in-game. This is an attempt to improve the existing dragon textures in the game, not to complete change them.\r\n\r\nSimply place the texture files in the Data>textures>actors>dragon folder.\r\n\r\nUse the following console commands to test out the new textures if you want:\r\nPlayer.placeatme F811D (to spawn Ancient Dragon)\r\nPlayer.placeatme F8117 (to spawn Blood Dragon)\r\nPlayer.placeatme F8102 (to spawn Elder Dragon)\r\nPlayer.placeatme F8119 (to spawn Frost Dragon)\r\nPlayer.placeatme EAFB4 (to spawn regular Dragon)",
