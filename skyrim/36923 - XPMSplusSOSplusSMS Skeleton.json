  "descriptionHtml": "Background:\r<br />\r<br />Sooooo Schlongs of Skyrim came out and that was kinda cool no more abnormal weird ass always erect penises on the dead corpses of male npc&#39;s, hooray&#33; The catch?? To use it you have to give up a large portion of your badass mods which usually rely on the XPMS skeleton.... yeah fuck that so i went online and looked up merging skeletons which led me to NifSkope and low and behold three hours later after slight frustration and the sad realization i have too much time on my hands i managed to merge the XPMS and SOS skeletons&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; Hurrah&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; Hurrah&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; Three cheers for me&#33;&#33;&#33; ( Not bad for my first time modding a skeleton right? RIGHT&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;?)\r<br />\r<br />THIS SKELETON CAN BE USED WITH OUT SCHLONGS OF SKYRIM:\r<br />If you want to just use this skeleton for XPMS plus SMS it should work just fine as the schlongs simply wont appear as u have no file using those assets \r<br />\r<br />Acronyms I use ALOT\r<br />\r<br />DOBH = Dagger on Back (of) Hip\r<br />BQLH = Belt Quiver Left Hip\r<br />SMS = Sublte Male Skeleton (kill yourself if u needed this one)\r<br />1HB = One handed weapons on back\r<br />SOS = Schlongs of Skyrim (kill yourself if u needed this one)\r<br />OFBQ = Original Frostfall Belt Quiver \r<br />\r<br />XP32 rolled out SOS compatibility so there&#39;s no reason to post new xpms files and i will limit this project to my custom skeletons aka XPMS plus SMS\r<br />\r<br />Install: \r<br />\r<br />Any who to install simply drop the meshes folder within the RAR into your Skyrim Data folder after you&#39;ve installed any mods that modify your skeleton and TAAAADAAAAHHHH&#33; You have a combined skeleton&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; YAY YOU&#33;&#33;&#33;  \r<br />\r<br />Anyways after performing this miraculous feat of mental dexterity Schlongs of Skyrim should be compatible with what ever you throw at it but wait there&#39;s a catch&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />THIS IS NOT AN ANIMATION REPLACER\r<br />so you will have to get certain animation files from immersive animation mod or whatever you fancy  if you are going to use DSR and so on and so forth ths why u need FNIS\r<br />\r<br />A Better STEP BY STEP:\r<br />First: install FNIS as it really doesn&#39;t do much \r<br />Second: Dual Sheath Redux, again like FNIS it currently wont affect anything \r<br />Third: SOS schlong of skyrim should always be installed prior to any mods modifying the skeleton \r<br />Fourth: This step step should actually be repeated depending on your mods for example at this point you should install deadly mutilation, realistic rag dolls, BBP, TBBP so on so forth \r<br />Fifth: XPMS the reason for this is that my skeletons only modify males at the moment so set up the rig your going to use in my files with out the equip animation so females wont look off more importantly xpms 1.8.1 has compatibility to the previously mentioned mods (DSR,RR,BBP, etc.)\r<br />Sixth: Immersive animations for any of you using DSR the animation included in this replacer work great and look fantastic just remember to NOT overwrite the female skeleton \r<br />Seventh: Install my skeleton file and overwrite everything \r<br />Last step: Run FNIS for Users and Dual Sheath Redux patch after you&#39;ve installed all your other mods, if for any reason your mods need to overwrite these at this point simply perform these steps after you&#39;ve installed all your other mods \r<br />THEN BOOM your Schlong and sword quivers and so on are all working \r<br />\r<br />*Note for those of you using the SMS (subtle male skeleton) there&#39;s ZERO reason for you to install it at any point as my skeleton will simply overwrite it\r<br />\r<br />If there&#39;s a problem for any of you let me know and I&#39;ll look into accommodating your needs , and yes I&#39;m looking into futanari skeleton rigs for female Schlongs for all you kinky people out there, personally not my cup of tea but one look at the SOS forums and i know that question&#39;s gonna cum up. ( haha see what i did there??)\r<br />\r<br />MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL REMEMBER TO ENDORSE THESE MODS \r<br />SOS - Schlongs of Skyrim (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35463//?)\r<br />XPMS (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800//?)\r<br />SMS (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34438//?)\r<br />\r<br />I am Konetsu aka Krazyguy126... because 125 was already taken... and I approve this message, thank you for your time and a happy Schlong to you, have a good day.\r<br />\r<br />Updates:\r<br />\r<br />6/6/13 So far this rig gives people compatibility to Dual Sheath Redux, Deadly Mutilation, all animations that rely on XPMS and trickiest of all Bandoliers&#33;&#33;&#33; Granted if your naked and leave your bandolier bags on it will look fairly dumb but that&#39;s nothing new and I&#39;m fairly certain bandoliers provides a fix to that minor inconvenience\r<br />\r<br />6/6/13 I&#39;ve also added a few new rigs that were requested mind you it sucks i cant magically make them instantly for all of you and i apologize for the wait but here you go, happy Schlong.\r<br />\r<br />6/6/13 Keep the requests and feedback coming people remember  i play the game too and most likely my games a hundred times different then yours (well a little over 200 actually as that&#39;s the amount of mods i use lol) and as such i have little possibility of running into your issues if you don&#39;t identify them for me \r<br />\r<br />6/7/13 So sorry for the confusion but when i write DOH i mean daggers on back hip not actually just on hip as per the XPMS default rig and have changed it to DOBH to avoid any confusion again so sorry\r<br />\r<br />6/7/13 ITS HERE XPMS+SOS+SMS yup all three of them combined into one, is it an exact copy??? no no its not but it looks like it and gives you the aesthetic of the subtle male skeleton the functionality of Xp&#39;s maximum skeleton and most importantly a Schlong it gives you a Schlong ladies and gentlemen is your mind not blown right now&#33;&#33;&#33;?? BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE \r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t trust my word as far you can throw a Mammoth?? check out the user images section and then worship me&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; just kidding don&#39;t that would be awwwkkkkwwwaarrrdd, but definitely check out the images.\r<br />\r<br />Recommendation:\r<br />\r<br />USE RACE MENU, if for some reason you&#39;re not already using race menu then you&#39;re missing out because due to the XPMS skeleton a lot of values are changeable in RaceMenu most notably biceps and so you could make your arms and height the size of a Giant, you shouldn&#39;t because I&#39;m sure you enjoy the ability to get down halls and fit through doors but it never hurts knowing that if you want, you can.",
