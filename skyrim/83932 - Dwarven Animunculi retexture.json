  "descriptionHtml": "I use a couple of mods that change the look of dwarven metal in-game, namely aMidianBorn Dwarven Armor and Dwemer Metal Retexture by Langley. Neither of them included textures for the spiders, spheres, and centurions that wander around in dwarven ruins, and their default coloration is jarringly pale. I got tired of looking at them so I went in and tweaked the vanilla textures to make them stand out less next to modded dwarven ruins. Compared to the default textures, these are a little darker with a bit more of an orange-ish tint to them. It&#39;s a very subtle difference, nothing spectacular.",
