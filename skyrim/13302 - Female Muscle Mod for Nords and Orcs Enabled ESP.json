  "summary": "This makes it so that the female muscle texture mods only work on Nords and Orc females. Other races use the default skin. This mod relies on but includes no one else\\'s resources.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]I am no longer updating this, I highly recommend Elmanouche\\'s Muscular Women instead of this:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8873 and/or Naveatsea\\'s Skin Retexture with Basvanbeu muscle texture changer at http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6554/ [/b]\r\n\r\nFYI: I have commenting enabled on this mod, I don\\'t know why it blocks comments.\r\n\r\nThis mod makes it so that the Nord and Orc races can use a texture replacer that changes how both of their races look for females. It was originally designed for use with Tigersan\\'s Female Muscle Mod as I liked that but didn\\'t like how it changed all races. It can work with anyone\\'s skin mods and contains NO ONE ELSE\\'S RESOURCES, this simply enables those two races to work with a custom skin mod. Granted the folder structure shows why it was originally meant for Tigersan\\'s mod.\r\n\r\nThis mod will conflict with any other mod that changes the orc, nord, and their respective vampire races.\r\n\r\nPlease note this may cause CTDs on uninstalling.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nTo use, place the texture files you want to use for females in:\r\n<steamapps and other mumbo jumbo where skyrim is>Data\\\\Textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female\\\\tigersan\\\\diesel\r\n\r\nIn the root of the diesel folder include:\r\nfemalebody.dds\r\nfemalebody_1.dds\r\nfemalebody_1_msn.dds\r\nfemalehands_1.dds\r\nfemalehands_1_msn.dds\r\n\r\nThere should be no other folders in diesel, put all files in that folder.\r\n\r\nPlease support Tigersan for making the textures that inspired me to make this.\r\n\r\nTigersan\\'s mod that you can get textures for this is at: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=44&navtag=file/images.php?id=44&tab=3\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nDelete the esp.\r\nDelete the folder and all files in <steamapps and other mumbo jumbo where skyrim is>Data\\\\Textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female\\\\tigersan\r\n\r\nWhile I have done my best to make sure this is a clean mod and not breaking other parts of the game, I have been made aware that trying to disable this after using for your main character has issues on uninstalling as the game looks for the files from this on reloading a save game. It may be best to backup your character before using this. I apologize for any trouble this may cause but it was unintended and seems to be the nature of the game save mechanic. You can always drag the default game or alternate textures you want to use to the tigersan folder which will allow you to revert back as a work around.",
