  "summary": "The legendary sword of Martin the Warrior, wielded by he and the defenders of Redwall Abbey that followed, is now yours to draw against your enemies.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][i]Look for the sword\r<br />In moonlight streaming forth,\r<br />At night, when day&#39;s first hour\r<br />Reflects the North.\r<br />From o&#39;er the threshold\r<br />Seek and you will see;\r<br />I -- am that is,\r<br />My sword shall wield for me.[/i][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Yep, after lots of hard work, it&#39;s done. Ratdeath, the sword of Martin the Warrior and many others from the Redwall book series by the late, great Brian Jacques is complete and ready to be used in battle with your enemies.\r<br />\r<br />The sword is slightly better damage-wise than an elven sword and can be tempered with an ingot of steel and quicksilver. On top of that, it has a script-added perk (much like the silver sword) that makes it particularly damaging to skeevers. Thanks to this, it&#39;s also fully enchantable so you can put whatever milks your Guernsey on it.\r<br />\r<br />The sword can be found southeast of Sleeping Tree Camp, in a little Nordic ruin with a cage trap door that&#39;s opened by solving the pillar puzzle there. It shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find in there, just be sure to look around. This little Nordic ruin is a vanilla location, not added by me, so the mod should be right compatible with just about anything.\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s an optional file with the mod that replaces the sword&#39;s mesh with one that has a faceted pommel-stone instead of a smooth one. If you prefer the faceted one, just drop the meshes folder you&#39;ll find in the &#34;Optional/data&#34; folder into your Data folder. Otherwise just install the mod normally.\r<br />\r<br />[u]The sword&#39;s not complete without the shield&#33; Go and feast your peepers on [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/46230/?]The Shield of Martin[/url]&#33;[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Pictures that Move[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]8NGlHvdvO5E[/youtube] [youtube]C_jIv9xHz6Q[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Known Issues[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />None\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Check out my other mods&#33; Don&#39;t worry, they don&#39;t bite.
