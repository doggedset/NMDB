Fight them one on one or all at the same time, \r\nor watch them fight against each other.\r\n\r\nThis area also contains:\r\n\r\nliving quarters (including crafting room) \r\n\r\nfish ponds\r\n\r\ntunnel to Whiterun\r\n\r\nThere is also an outside area with all necessary crafting equipment within easy reach. You don't\r\nhave to go inside att all if you prefer (maybe you don't like load doors). \r\n\r\nThis mod is also available at Steam:\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=116588721\r\n\r\n[heading][color=orange]\r\nRecommended complementary mods\r\n[/color][/heading]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/42484]Whiterun Kjeller - A Whiterun & Breezehome expansion[/url] \r\n\r\nmore Whiterun underground, including more merchants [i]and[/i]\r\na Breezehome expansion with the missing pieces from Breezehome\r\n- making your first home in Skyrim fully equipped. \r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1111]Pure Waters[/url]  \r\n\r\nmakes the fish ponds and swimming pool look better\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11370]Spouses Can Live Everywhere[/url]  \r\n\r\n[heading][color=orange]\r\nInstructions\r\n[/color][/heading]\r\nIMPORTANT: this mod is incompatible with the Heimdall player house mod. If you are currently\r\nusing the Heimdall mod you can move to New Heimdall by taking all your stuff to a temporary\r\nlocation (like Breezehome) and then disable the Heimdall mod. (If you want detailed instructions\r\nmail me at etrennert@yahoo.com) \r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to leave comments on this page, I welcome feedback. \r\n\r\nNote that the underground area of this mod, \"The Kjeller\", is like a mixture of a player house and an outside area and a dungeon. All containers are safe for storage but The Kjeller gets reset like a dungeon/outside area.\r\n \r\n[heading][color=orange]\r\nFAQ \r\n[/color][/heading]\r\nWhere is the house located? \r\n[i]\r\njust outside whiterun. look at the map among the pictures at the top of this page.\r\nthere are also images at the end of the slide show showing new heimdall and whiterun\r\nin the same picture. TODO: (maybe someone can help me with this?): put a video on youtube showing new heimdalls close proximity to Whiterun, and also showing the house and the kjeller (including the prison)\r\n [/i]\r\nWhere can I find the key to the prison? \r\n[i]\r\nit's not hard to find. where would you store an important key? \r\n\r\n[spoiler][color=#313131]In the safe in the bedroom and in the safe in the crafting room[/color][/spoiler]\r\n[/i]\r\n\r\nVersion history \r\n------------------ \r\n\r\n1.0\r\n\r\n1.1\r\n\r\nLarger Dungeon\r\n\r\n\r\nContact \r\n---------- \r\n\r\nContact me at etrennert@yahoo.com",
