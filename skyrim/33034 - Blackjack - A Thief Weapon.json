  "summary": "This new weapon can be used against enemies to incapacitate them for a short while. The victim will be unconscious allowing you to continue your mission.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=22]Description[/size]\r\n\r\nThe weapon will only work properly when you are attacking someone who has not detected you. If they have seen you the weapon will nearly no damage. Once you\\'ve struck the enemy they will crumple to the ground unconscious. The amount of time they are unconscious varies but will be less than half a game day.\r\n\r\n[size=5]Wake Up![/size]\r\n\r\nOnce someone has been knocked out you may want to awaken them before they wake up naturally. You can do this by just hitting them again with any weapon (blackjack included) but you run the risk of the person realizing you just hit them and attacking back. The chance of this happening depends on your faction and relationship rating with that person.\r\n\r\nIf you want a safer way to wake them up then you can use Smelling Salts. You can grab some salt piles, and then turn them into Smelling Salts at any cooking pot. You use one smelling salt to awaken one person.\r\n\r\nYou should definitely put your blackjack away before the victim wakes up. If they see you standing over them with a blackjack in hand they will realize it was you who knocked them out and raise the alarm.\r\n\r\n[size=5]But wait there\\'s more[/size]\r\n\r\nYou can get your own blackjack rather easily. You can create the weapon at any forge with just simple ingredients: firewood, iron ingot, and some leather strips. \r\n\r\n[size=5]Check this out[/size]\r\n\r\nFor another useful stealth mod check out Mark Targets: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32811\r\n\r\n[Line]\r\n\r\n[size=20]Changes[/size]\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[*] 1.3 - [b]Completely rewritten from the ground up[/b]\r\n[*] 1.2 - Fixed interactions with knocked out enemies\r\n[*] 1.1 - Added some missing scripts\r\n[*] 1.0 - Initial release\r\n[/ul]",
