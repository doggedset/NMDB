  "descriptionHtml": " This is a very small &#34;house&#34; just outside of riverwood ,there is a map marker too. It contains a chest that doesnt respawn and all the basic crafting stuff you need. There is also a bed too. I might expand on this in the future but not sure at the moment. I was tired of having all kinds of stuff collected but no where to put anything safe with out loosing it, which is why i made this. \r<br />Enjoy",
