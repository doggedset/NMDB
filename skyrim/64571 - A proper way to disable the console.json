  "descriptionHtml": "Using a BSA unpacker, open Skyrim&#92;data&#92;Skyrim - Interface.bsa and find interface&#92;controls&#92;pc&#92;controlmap.txt. This file dictates what key is used for each function in the game. All you have to do is unpack this into Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Interface&#92;Controls&#92;PC, then open the new controlmap.txt and find the line for Console under the // Main Gameplay section and change its first value to &#34;0xff,0xff&#34;, then find the line for Console under the // Menu Mode section and change its first value to &#34;0xff&#34; . This will completely null the function for opening the console. When you next start up the game, the key which normally opens the console will now do nothing. Woo&#33; No more superpowers&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Or if you&#39;re lazy and/or can&#39;t get it to work, and as long as you&#39;re not already using a modified controlmap.txt, you can just use the included controlmap.txt and place it intoÂ Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Interface&#92;Controls&#92;PC. You may have to make these folders yourself if they don&#39;t exist already.\r<br />\r<br />A plus side to this method is that you can still use an Xbox 360 controller without issues&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I just decided to share this because it always bugged me that there&#39;s ways to disable the console easily in Morrowind and Oblivion, but not in Skyrim.",
