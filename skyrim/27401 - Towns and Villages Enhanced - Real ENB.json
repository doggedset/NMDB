  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/PM7Ro.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[color=#0080FF]What is Towns and Villages Enhanced - Real ENB?[/color]\r\nTAVERL ENB, is an ENB focusing heavily on performance, and compatibility with my mods. It stays true to the lighting and atmosphere of Skyrim, providing a more subtle enhancement. The ENB has little extra effects, meaning you get the best frame rates while using it. Processes like DoF and SSAO have been turned off, to conserve performance. \r\nExposure and Ambient lighting have been altered to mimic that of real life, and the colour tones included in the ENB boost saturation and vibrance, making it perfect in combination with Towns and Villages Enhanced.\r\n\r\nRecommended use with Nvidia SSAO, 2K textures and Towns and Villages Enhanced. \r\n\r\n[color=#0080FF]Videos:[/color]\r\n[youtube]buyj1Ri8V3k[/youtube]\r\nThanks to Hodilton!\r\n\r\n[color=#0080FF]Screenshots:[/color]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/VcnvA.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/1HkgQ.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/2kTCn.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/S7KJG.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/5OLod.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/BFWj0.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/eI18Y.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/1SIr8.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/KbLTl.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/ozFTe.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/c8Kvb.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/MQJJH.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[color=#0080FF]Installation:[/color]\r\nTo install, simply drag the contents of TAVEENBRL into your Skyrim main directory.\r\nYou also need to download the  d3d9.dll from \r\n\\\"http://www.enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.htm\\\"\r\n(v 0.119) and put it in the same location.\r\n\r\n[color=#0080FF]Features:[/color]\r\n.
