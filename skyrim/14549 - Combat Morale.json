  "descriptionHtml": "=======================\r\nCombat Morale\r\n=======================\r\nThe bandits, vampires, etc of Skyrim have a strange inconsistency in their behavior.  They know when they can\\'t win a fight and will talk about surrendering or fleeing, even begging for mercy, but if given a chance to get up they\\'ll simply start hitting you again.  This plugin makes all the world\\'s living creatures weigh their odds in fights, and run for it if given reason to.\r\n\r\n=======================\r\nInstallation\r\n=======================\r\nRequirements: A program capable of unpacking .rar files.\r\n\r\nExtract CombatMorale.rar to your Skyrim/Data folder, and select Data Files from the Skyrim Launcher.  Activate CombatMorale.esp if you want the standard version, or CombatMoraleNoLootBag.esp if you don\\'t want a bag full of of random junk to appear every time you let an enemy get away.\r\n\r\n=======================\r\nDetails\r\n=======================\r\nNote: This plugin *does* make the game slightly easier by decreasing the number of enemies you will need to work through.  It\\'s not the intended effect, but it\\'s an effect nonetheless.\r\n\r\nEnemies will make a break for it under one of three circumstances: They\\'re knocked into a bleedout state, they\\'re hit with a Fear effect, or the battle is going unfavourably.  To elaborate on that last one, the plugin keeps track of everyone currently fighting the player, and their experience level.  Once over 50% of the enemies\\' levels have died or were forced away, the rest will also retreat.   For example, if you\\'re fighting three Level 5 Bandit Outlaws being led by a Level 16 Bandit Highwayman, beating the Highwayman to his knees will make the Outlaws (and, if he survives, the Highwayman) flee.  If there are four Outlaws, the Highwayman would flee if you killed all his minions, and the Outlaws would flee if the Highwayman and at least one Outlaw were slain.  Enemies who flee due to the tide of battle will be removed from the level count entirely so new enemies won\\'t flee instantly due to the chain reaction.\r\n\r\nThe actual fleeing is governed by a Demoralize effect (not visible, of course), so expect a lot of cowering and running into walls.  After a fleeing enemy has been out of the player\\'s sight for five seconds, unique actors will end combat and non-unique actors will disappear.  To prevent quest breakage disappeared actors will be killed, and their items moved to a \\'loot bag\\' placed at the player\\'s feet at the end of combat (or, if you\\'re using the No Loot Bag version, any Quest Items will be added directly to your inventory).  The loot bag will empty itself of any non-quest items after it\\'s accessed.  Dragons, non-vampire undead, Daedra and Dwarven automata are exempt from morale effects, as are Commanded, Essential or Frenzied enemies.\r\n\r\n=======================\r\nCompatibility\r\n=======================\r\nThis mod disables itself when the player is unarmed to stop it breaking brawls (yes, it\\'s sloppy, but checking if the enemy is unarmed somehow messes up their AI and I can\\'t find any global variables associated with brawls), so it will be incompatible with any unarmed combat overhauls.\r\n\r\n=======================\r\nThanks To\r\n=======================\r\nBethesda Softworks for actually making me feel bad for a faceless bandit mook.\r\n\r\n=======================\r\nChangelog\r\n=======================\r\nv1.0c: April 19, 2012\r\n-Added an *actually working* exception for brawls.  Alas, this mod is no longer compatible with unarmed combat overhauls.\r\n-Improved the ally detection, so enemies should hopefully be running away more in group fights.\r\n\r\nv1.0b: April 8, 2012\r\n-Added a kludgy exception for brawls, so being punched out won\\'t fill people with terror.\r\n\r\nv1.0a: April 7, 2012\r\n-Added a No Loot Bag version\r\n\r\nv1.0: April 6, 2012\r\n-Initial release\r\n\r\n=======================\r\nDisclaimer\r\n=======================\r\nAnyone may use anything in this plugin for any non-commercial purpose, provided they give credit.\r\n",
