  "descriptionHtml": "[i][size=4][u][b]UPDATE:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />[size=2]Fixed the blocked bedroom window above the fireplace in version 1.1.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][u]INTRODUCTION:[/u][/b][/size][/i]\r<br />\r<br />[i]This is my version of the classic [/i][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31222/?][i]Breezehome TNF - Hearthfire[/i][/url][i] by goatk containing psychoslaphead&#39;s [/i][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67323/?][i]TNF Modified Player Homes Bath Area Undressing[/i][/url][i] mod. Credit to both these mod authors for their awesome work.[/i]\r<br />[b][color=#ff7700][size=3][i]NOTE[/i]:[/size][/color][/b][i] As long as you&#39;re using vanilla body textures or non-nude replacers, there&#39;s no nudity caused by this mod. Whether followers sit in the bath in their underwear or birthday suit is completely in your hands. \r<br />\r<br />Breezehome TNF&#39;s a great mod - it&#39;s simple, looks good, provides the necessary extras to prevent constant trips to Dragonsreach or Adrianne&#39;s whilst still retaining the vanilla feel. But I didn&#39;t much care for that eyesore of a fire pit (imo) smack in the middle of my living room and wanted a fireplace instead. So I fired up the CK and made the necessary changes...and then proceeded to make a whole lot of unnecessary ones.\r<br />\r<br />And as I was applying the finishing touches to the mod, I realized how often I visited the shops and other areas in Whiterun so I made a version which added a bunch of trapdoors with direct access to places like Belethor&#39;s, Arcadia&#39;s, Warmaidens, Skyforge, Dragonsreach, The Companions, Bannered Mare, etc. Why? Well, because I am can and because one loading screen is more bearable than two. Yes, its nonsensical and [i]unrealistic [/i]but in a world full of giant flying lizards and gravity defying horses, anything goes. [u]But worry not, there&#39;s a no trapdoors version for anyone who doesn&#39;t want them.[/u]\r<br />\r<br />My ENB presets used in the screenshots - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84169/?]Surreal ENB v2[/url]/[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/78562/?]Surreal ENB[/url].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/i][size=4][i][u][b]CHANGES:[/b][/u][/i][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[i][size=3]More roomy, less obstructed living room.[/size][/i]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/O79bC46.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/GGZf5fr.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/E8TetLS.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[i][size=3]Fireplace instead of the fire pit.[/size][/i]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/lAG6Drp.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/l0a60yR.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/y2xR8TT.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[i][size=3]Oven & cooking pot near the dining area.[/size][/i]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/zfM2WAQ.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/GKUf8m6.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[i][size=3]Extra room with 2 beds for followers instead when purchasing the alchemy lab upgrade. Since the new alchemy table&#39;s down in the smithing room, I didn&#39;t see the point in having a dedicated alchemy lab. You&#39;ll get the alchemy table along with the smithing stuff and enchanting table when you buy the loft upgrades. Left the children&#39;s room as it was.[/size][/i] \r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/31RF1j7.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/YKpj4os.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[i][size=3]Extended Lydia&#39;s room with an extra bed for another follower to rest his/her weary head.[/size][/i]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/fJYUgDW.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[i][size=3]Alchemy & enchanting table down in the smithing room because climbing up and down the narrow stairs to enchant every shiny new weapon I crafted or to brew some smithing/enchantment enhancing potions only to find Lydia blocking my path was rather annoying. Now I can test the weapons on her straight away. [/size][/i]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/ArPxd4o.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/B7zAAqd.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[i][size=3]Extra weapon racks for displaying a few more of your WMD&#39;s.[/size][/i]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/t5s2epH.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[i][size=3]Added a door to the amazing TNF bathroom for some privacy and changed the water color from aqua green to something I thought looked better (imo). And of course, no followers sitting in the bath wearing full armor/clothing ruining immersion thanks to psychoslaphead&#39;s undressing script. Like sensible people, they&#39;ll now strip down to their underwear (or birthday suit depending on your other mods) before entering the water. [/size][/i]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/03Znken.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/0A1MEEH.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/zDW0xts.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[i][size=3]The trapdoors. Crafting or brewing something and need supplies? Now go straight to Belethor&#39;s or Arcadia&#39;s. Want to buy some spell books or soul gems for Farengar? Direct access to Dragonsreach. Tired after a hard day&#39;s work and need a drink? Pop up right behind Hulda in The Bannered Mare. Even Skyrim is just one loading screen away.[/size][/i]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/0WsBVx0.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/88Sizal.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/de7RliE.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[i][size=3]I have made a few other changes but they are mostly insignificant cosmetic changes not worth mentioning. [/size][/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][i][u][b]INSTALLATION:[/b][/u][/i][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Requires Hearthfire. [/i][i]Always make a save backup before installing any mod. [/i]\r<br />\r<br />[i]MO/NMM - Download and install.[/i]\r<br />[i]Manual - Download and extra files to your Data folder. Seriously though, use a mod manager. [/i]\r<br />\r<br />[i]HAVEN&#39;T PURCHASED BREEZEHOME YET?[/i]\r<br />[i]Just activate the mod and you&#39;re good to go. [/i]\r<br />\r<br />[i]PURCHASED BREEZEHOME, UPGRADED IT, GOT STUFF/PEOPLE IN THERE? EVACUATION IS NECESSARY. [/i]\r<br />[i]1 - Pick up all the items you want to keep and get every NPC out of Breezehome.\r<br />2 - Go to any other interior cell such as Warmaiden&#39;s or The Drunken Huntsman.\r<br />3 - Make a manual save and then quit the game.\r<br />4 - Install the mod.\r<br />5 - Load up the manual save you made, enter Breezehome and the mod should be working fine.  \r<br />6 - If not, reload the manual save you made in step 3, bring up the console, type &#34;pcb&#34;, then &#34;resetinterior whiterunbreezehome&#34; and save the game.\r<br />7 - Enter Breezehome and check if everything&#39;s in order. [/i]\r<br />\r<br />[i]For more instructions or info regarding installing/upgrading/issues, just check the original mod&#39;s page (first link in my intro). Everything mentioned there applies here as well. Plus I have used this mod only on clean saves and haven&#39;t faced any issues with it so never needed to do anything extra to get it working besides installing it.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][i][b]COMPATIBILITY:[/b][/i][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[i]ELFX - Use the no Breezehome or no player homes esp.\r<br />\r<br />RLO - Unfortunately, the new RLO doesn&#39;t have a player homes patch. It has just the one main interior module so some TES5Edit tweaking is required but its rather straight forward. Load RLO interiors esp in TES5Edit, find WhiterunBreezehome in Cell/Block0/Sub-Block6, right click on Breezehome and click &#34;Remove&#34;. This should remove RLO&#39;s edits for Breezehome but keep the rest of the mod intact. \r<br />\r<br />Incompatible with generally any mod that alters Breezehome interiors. \r<br />\r<br />Compatible with the brilliant [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59721/?]DynDOLOD[/url].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/i][size=4][u][i][b]PERFORMANCE:[/b][/i][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[i]I have an oc&#39;ed 2500K/RX 470 and with a whole bunch of mods and an ENB preset, I drop under 50fps in the living room with the original mod whereas with my version, its a constant 60fps.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][i][b][size=4]CONCLUSION:[/size][/b][/i][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[i]I originally made this mod just for personal use and didn&#39;t really plan on uploading it. There are about half a dozen great TNF versions already on the Nexus not to mention a million other cool house mods to choose from so doubt very many people are going to d/l this. But I decided to upload it anyway just in case someone was looking for a different take on the original mod or just a simple, lightweight, performance friendly Breezehome mod. If anyone finds this mod to his/her liking, that&#39;s good enough for me. And if you do like it, then kindly consider endorsing it. [i]Also, if you come across any issues, do let me know. [/i]Thank you for looking at my mod. Peace.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/r2kZHu2.jpg[/img][/center]",
