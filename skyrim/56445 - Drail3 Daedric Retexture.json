  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://interrogisticmethodologies.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/test.png?w=920[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[center]This is a retexture of Daedric Armor and Weapons, which intendes to darken them, and give them a more sinister vibe. They are weapons and armor from another realm, used by the dark lords in the plane of Oblivion right? Shouldn&#39;t they look like it? The red glow of the Daedric objects is untouched, yet stands out a bit more as the items are darker, thus giving the glow more attention.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center]Comments are more than welcome, and I&#39;d also be interested in seeing my Daedric retexture when using different ENBs. Feel free to share any pics, and list your ENB, and any mods you think suit my retexture. [/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center]Thanks in advance.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center]I used [i][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/9479363/?tb=mods&pUp=1]772135193[/url][/i] retexture of Daedric items as a base for my retexture because his&#92;her work is simply awesome. It just didn&#39;t seem right creating a Daedric retexture of my own, using an inferior starting point. [i][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/9479363/?tb=mods&pUp=1]772135193[/url][/i] set a new standard, and so, that is where I started. I have included all of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/9479363/?tb=mods&pUp=1]772135193&#39;s[/url] original files, and so if you get tired of my retextures, you can revert to 772135193&#39;s. Please show your respects by checking out [i][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/9479363/?tb=mods&pUp=1]772135193[/url][/i] work.[/center]",
