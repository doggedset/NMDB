  "summary": "Hey, its my first mod that adds a location, it adds a ruin right next to riverwood that adds some things to help.",
  "descriptionHtml": "in the ruin you will find 50 elven arrows, 4 random spell books based on level, behind a door u will find a bow *also dependent on level* a bound bow book and bound sword book, other side of the hall you will see a chest with 4 random pieces of armor, yes again its random loot, and a random enchanted sword.\r<br />potions and random ingredients, NOT by level, i placed them.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />overall i think it just helps early game, me for one i find it annoying to get a few starter spells&#33; \r<br />also as a side note, if i make more smaller mods that are NOT op then i will simply add them to this.",
