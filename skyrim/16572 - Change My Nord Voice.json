  "descriptionHtml": "Change My Nord Voice by hardermob\r\n\r\nThis mod is primarily intended to be used with \\'Dovahkiin Relaxes Too\\' by wgstein; make sure ChangeMyNordVoice.esp is loaded after this other mod.  \r\n\r\nThis mod does three things:\r\n\r\n1) It changes NordRace -> Body Data -> Default voice type from \\'MaleEvenToned\\' to \\'MaleNord\\'.  \r\n\r\n2) It adds in the missing voice powers sounds for MaleNord, as this voice type is not a default\r\n   player voice type (even though the Nord race itself is playable, MaleEvenToned is the default\r\n   voice type for the Nord race.)\r\n\r\n3) It also adds back in many other potentially missing sounds for the Nord voice, most notably\r\n   out of breath running sounds.\r\n\r\nNow, instead of hearing your burly Nord warrior asking your wife \\\", What do you need?\\\" in a soprano-like elven-sounding voice, you\\'ll hear him more often than not simply grunt like a true Nord!\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\nChange log:\r\n\r\nv1.1: Fixed so that shouts are no longer silent after the change to NordMale\r\nv1.3: Added many other missing sounds for Nord voice, including out of stamina breathing\r\nv2.0: Dawnguard and Dragonborn shouts added\r\nv2.1: Mounted combat fixed (I\\'ve removed all versions prior to 2.1 because mounted melee combat did not work correctly) \r\n\r\nNote: If you do not have Dawnguard and/or Dragonborn DLC, 2.1 should still work fine for you.",
