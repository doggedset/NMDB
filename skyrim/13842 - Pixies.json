  "descriptionHtml": "They can be found at Bleakwind Basin, Blizzard\\'s rest, Kjenstag Ruins, Roadside ruins, and just north of Broken Fang Cave.\r\n\r\nCatch and kill the leprechaun for your boots of speed, Spell tome: Polymorph Pixie and Spell tome: Polymorph Nord. Credit to ResDog for teaching me how to do it.\r\n\r\nTinkerbell is a pixie companion you can rescue from Fellglow keep, in the cage next to Orthorn.\r\n\r\nPixies are a playable Race. They have high destruction, sneak and conjuration skills, and they move faster than the other races, but take much more physical damage.\r\n\r\nA quest chain will be following in a few weeks. Let me know what you think. I am especially interested in combat balancing.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
