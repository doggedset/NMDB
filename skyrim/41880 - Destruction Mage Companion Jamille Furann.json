But as time went by, he got older and passed away, at his deathbed, he told Jamille -Follow, your dreams.-\r\nJamille then decided to take the step in her life, and make her father proud. \r\nshe traveled to Winterhold, and decided that she would become one of the most powerful mages Skyrim would have ever had.\r\nFive years have passed since she arrived at the college of Winterhold. Jamille now is twenty five years old, and keeps eager on improving her powers. \r\nNow she awaits to join a great warrior, and travel all around Tamriel, putting her skills into practice.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/mQeRimb.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSe looks fantastic with these mods!\r\n\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/39959]Ultimate Assortment by Favoredsoul[/url]\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27064]KDCirclets Redone by zzjay[/url]\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20077]Tribunal Robes and Masks by Zairaam and Natterforme[/url]\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5696]Arise - Chapter 1 - The Black Sacrament by AmethystDeceiver[/url]\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19377]Imperial Investigator Armor UNP - UNPB by Calyps[/url]\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22607]Imperial Investigator Retexture by DreamBurrow[/url]\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19733]Immersive Armors by hothtrooper44[/url]\r\n-[url=http://rim-rim-fox.tumblr.com/post/42497197744/2-2]Kankaraya by Kanra[/url]\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37012]Witcher 2 - Nilfgaardian Mage Outfit by WesleyWalesAnderson[/url]\r\nalso...\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul by fLokii[/url]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/UXm77OC.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThanks to each one that made these amazing mods, without your amazing work, Jamille would not be possible.

For the beautiful featured video!\r\n\r\n[youtube]OmdP7-hhwns[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[b]===Requirements===[/b]\r\nRecommended Skyrim version 1.9.32.0.8 or later. May also work with earlier versions.\r\n-------\r\n-How to make the BBP body types work?\r\n\r\nFirst, Download and install a skeleton mod: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4888]CHSBHC - BBP - Nude and Jiggly Mod by CherryHotaling[/url] OR [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800]XP32 Maximum Skeleton -XPMS by xp32[/url].\r\nSecond, Download and install an animation mod: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35035]Natural Breast Animation by DarkAngel1265[/url] OR [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29408]Female Animation Pack by NonokuraSan[/url].\r\nAfter these mods are installed, the bodies should work properly.\r\n\r\n[b]===Installation===[/b]\r\nI recommend to use NMM, download with manager and activate. Or if you want to manually install, extract all the files into your Data folder.\r\n\r\n[b]===Uninstallation===[/b]\r\n-First, dismiss Jamille as your followers. Save your game and Quit to desktop.\r\n-Second, if you are using NMM, just remove it from the manager.\r\nFor a manual uninstallation, delete these files and folders:\r\nData\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\JamilleFurann\r\nData\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\FaceGenData\\\\FaceGeom\\\\JamilleFurann.esp\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\JamilleFurann\r\nData\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\FaceGenData\\\\FaceTint\\\\JamilleFurann.esp\r\nData\\\\JamilleFurann.esp\r\n\r\n[b]===About Permissions===[/b]\r\nPlease, do not upload this mod anywhere without giving the proper credits.\r\nIf you want to use Jamille in your mod, please notify me first, and don\\'t forget to include me in the credits.\r\n\r\n[b]===Known Issues===[/b]\r\n-The previous issues were all fixed.\r\nIf anyone find any problem in the latest version, please let me know!\r\n\r\nThank you, everyone! For the great support and appreciation!!\r\nKeep suggestions and issue reports coming!\r\n\r\n[b]===Change Log===[/b]\r\n(09/16/2013)- [b]v1.3[/b] - Fixed purple hair texture; fixed toothless mouth; Fixed face skin; Added CBBE-BBP and UNPB-BBP body types\r\n(09/13/2013)- [b]v1.2[/b] - Better battlestyle; unused bow removed.\r\n(09/13/2013)- [b]v1.1[/b] - Fixed neck seam; fixed UNP and derivated version\\'s hands collor unneveness; marriage now should work fine.\r\n(09/09/2013)- [b]v1.0[/b] - Initial release.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n-I am using a personal made ENB on the screenshots, maybe I will put it on Nexus sometime.\r\n\r\n-My intention is to make Jamille unique. I want to make her voice acted, add a questline and a lot more good things to her, so I will try to improve much more at skyrim modding and be accepting as much help I can.\r\nAt the moment, I will be working on bugfixes and some tweaks only. Although, I will do requested changes if really needed, so feel free to give me suggestions and report issues.\r\nThis is my first mod, so I\\'m still learning a lot!\r\n\r\nI really appreciate your appreciation! :)\r\n-------\r\n\r\n-Special thanks to all my friends and colleagues from Facebook, home and work that encouraged me while doing this mod. Doing it by myself, only with internet tutorials and videos, was not easy...\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI hope you all like her!\r\nPlease, enjoy!!\r\n\r\n...e Vai, Corinthians!\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/JBK2tm3.gif[/IMG] Chaquinho89",
