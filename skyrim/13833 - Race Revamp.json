Illusion was boosted in both games previously so  They were +10 Illusion which complements stealth.[/*]\r\n[*]Dunmer had not previously received a bonus to stealth until vanilla Skyrim. I left the Stealth bonus in place as the description had been changed to explicitly say they are noted for stealth and because they are typically regarded as an assassin archetype.[/*]\r\n[*]Imperials had several skills boosted in prior games that were consolidated. Their speech bonus was restored and the vanilla bonuses to Restoration and Enchant were left in place.[/*]\r\n[*]Redguards also had many of their previously boosted skills consolidated and after matching them up with previous games there was still room so the vanilla bonus to destruction was left in place in keeping with an offensive orientation.[/*]\r\n[*]All resistances and innate characteristics were made idential to Oblivion because genetic changes seem highly unlikely in the small span of time between Oblivion and Skyrim.[/*]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][u]My Other Mod....[/u][/size]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14457]Open and Lock Spells[/url]\r\n\r\nThis was my first mod.
