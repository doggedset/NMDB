  "descriptionHtml": "11/12/2012 - Updated to fix a bug I had mistakenly created with the world geometry in Whiterun. This bug fix is courtesy of Nexus user Jman1992, who both caught and corrected this issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThis sword blasts targets far away from their impact point. It can also be disenchanted and the Force Blast enchantment can be learned. For now, it has been moved to the street outside Breezehome in Whiterun due to a glitch that was deleting the forge the sword should spawn at.\r\n\r\nBE VERY CAREFUL using this weapon. NPC\\'s, even quest essential NPC\\'s, can be blasted halfway across Skyrim in a single hit and may be \\'lost\\' even if they survive.\r\n\r\nAlways save before using.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re interested, the script is available for viewing/editing if you load the esp file in the Creation Kit.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nCheck out my other mods:\r\nForce Bow: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15153\r\nH.P.
