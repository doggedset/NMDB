  "summary": "Adds a single new spell to Skyrim: Soul Trap Rune. This spell works just like any basic destruction rune, but with the exception that it does not do damage and is not considered a \\\"hostile\\\" spell if a neutral NPC triggers it. It is mainly geared toward \\\"clever\\\" encounters and non-mages, so its mana cost is low while lowering the effect duration",
