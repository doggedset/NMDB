  "summary": "Removes beheading of the player or of all NPCs. (Wyre Bash merging not suggested)",
  "descriptionHtml": "&#34;&#39;I see&#33;&#39; said the Queen, who has meanwhile been examining the roses. &#39;Off with their heads&#33;&#39; and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection. \r<br />&#39;You sha&#39;n&#39;t be beheaded&#33;&#39; said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near.&#34; \r<br />...\r<br />&#34;As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company, generally, &#39;You are all pardoned.&#39; &#39;Come, that&#39;s a good thing&#33;&#39; she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />One of the most frustrating and frankly disturbing things to me in games is when the player character is dismembered in a death scene. In Skyrim, where the character you play is one you spent half an hour creating and days adventuring with, the sight of their head getting effortlessly lopped off by a bandit wielding an iron claymore...well...it angers me. \r<br />\r<br />One version of this mod removes the Savage Strike and Devastating Blow perks from every NPC I could find, so we don&#39;t have to see what would have happened if Alduin didn&#39;t attack Helgen. \r<br />Ideally, it removes the rare but frustrating occurrence of the player dying from getting their head cut off. \r<br />\r<br />The other version changes the global chance of decapitation to zero, ideally removing it from the game altogether, except the scripted execution scenes.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE&#33; I would suggest NOT merging the &#34;You are All Pardoned&#34; version with Wyre Bash. The mod changes a global variable, and has to be loaded at the very end of the load order, just before any Bashed Patches. In my experience merging it with Wyre Bash made the mod unfunctional.\r<br />\r<br />F.A.Q.\r<br />Q. What do you have against decapitation? I don&#39;t see why this &#34;problem&#34; needed solving.\r<br />A. I&#39;m not telling you to download it, and I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re evil for liking dismemberment.\r<br />I have NOTHING against decapitation and I&#39;m not trying to &#34;fix&#34; it. \r<br />Skyrim is very tame compared to some video games, and I actually enjoy killing vampires by decapitation. I just don&#39;t like when a character you&#39;re supposed care about is killed in a grisly way, emotionally punishing you for losing. If you don&#39;t think the same way, that&#39;s perfectly fine.\r<br />\r<br />I made this mod to give people options. Some people (myself included) don&#39;t like watching a character they care about get tortured or torn apart. Some people want to play characters who don&#39;t dismember others. I know for a fact that some people play Skyrim with their kids, and want the ability to turn decapitation off.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Short version:\r<br />It&#39;s not a bug-fix, it&#39;s an [i]option.[/i]",
