He sells different daggers (iron, steel, glass, elven and ebony) and also some light armor (Leather gear and Scaled gear, no helmets)\r\nHe is in the basement of the Inn (Bee and Barb in Riften as I said)\r\nI hope you will find this usefull, I might add some other items, you can leave suggestions in the comment section.\r\n\r\nIf you find a bug, inform me.\r\nMod made by me, khzuOVG.\r\n\r\nScreenshots coming soon, not much to show though.",
