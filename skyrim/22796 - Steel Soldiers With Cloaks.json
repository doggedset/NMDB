  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes all soldier and guard armor, gear, and weapons, so that they all get steel and match their civil war faction. It changes the stats of the armor on both sides so that they equal steel. It changes the steel set to steel plate so anyone who had basic steel, such as housecarls, will now have steel plate for a neutral appearance. And it adds two custom chests by Ulfric Stormcloak and General Tullius\\' beds with all the armor and weapons. Here\\'s a brief list of what they receive:\r\n\r\nStormcloak soldier and guards from Stormcloak holds:\r\n1 Cuirass (from their hold)\r\n1 Cloak (from their hold)\r\n1 Steel Horned Helmet\r\n1 Steel Gauntlets Set\r\n1 Steel Boots Set\r\n1 Shield (from their hold)\r\n1 Random Steel Weapon\r\n1 Steel Crossbow (Dawnguard only, stats changed to use ammo)\r\n8 Steel Bolts (Dawnguard only)\r\n1 Hunting Bow (stats changed to match Imperial and use ammo)\r\n16 Steel Arrows\r\n1 Steel Dagger\r\n\r\nImperial soldier and guards from Imperial holds:\r\n1 Cuirass (from their hold)\r\n1 Cloak (from their hold)\r\n1 Imperial Heavy Helmet\r\n1 Imperial Heavy Bracers Set\r\n1 Imperial Heavy Boots Set\r\n1 Shield (from their hold)\r\n1 Imperial Sword Only\r\n1 Steel Crossbow (Dawnguard only, stats changed to use ammo)\r\n8 Steel Bolts (Dawnguard only)\r\n1 Imperial Bow (stats changed to use ammo)\r\n16 Steel Arrows\r\n1 Steel Dagger\r\n\r\nUnderstand that all NPC\\'s get their items when they spawn, so the best way to start using this mod is in a new game, but you don\\'t have to. Selecting an NPC and typing Resurrect in the console will give anyone their changes instantly.",
