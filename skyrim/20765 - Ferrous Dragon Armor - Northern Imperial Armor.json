  "descriptionHtml": "Ferrous Dragon Armor - Northern Imperial Armor\r\nThank you insaneOhflex for making a video showcasing the mod!\r\n[youtube]FvDZXMCwyB0[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1162.photobucket.com/albums/q524/exraycatt/2012-07-19_00066.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThis is a retexture of the iron armor set converted into a standalone armor set.  Meshes are included because I added environment maps to the armor to enhance the metallic properties.  The armor can be created at the forge but you must have the \\\"Advanced Armors\\\" perk, and some extra ingredients above what you would need to just forge regular iron armor.  \r\n\r\nTo forge the armor you will need:\r\nIron\r\nSteel\r\nCorundum\r\nSilver\r\nLeather\r\n\r\nThis armor gives stats just a tad below Orcish in terms of protection\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nIf you want some weapons that go nicely with the armor you can find a full set of retextured iron weapons here:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17411]HD IRON WEAPONS[/url]\r\n\r\nIf you want a few bows, arrows, and quivers that go with it you can find them here:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20573]HD Bow and Arrow Retex[/url]\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n1) Use NMM\r\nor\r\n2) Drop the \\\"data\\\" folder into your \\\"Skyrim\\\" root folder and choose to merge folders if asked\r\n3) Make sure the \\\"Ferrous Dragon Iron Armor Standalone.esp\\\" is activated in NMM or your Data Files\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\n1) Use NMM\r\nor\r\n2) delete the .esp from your data folder and the \\\"ferrousdragon\\\" folders from:\r\n\r\nSkyrim/data/textures/armors and\r\nSkyrim/data/meshes/armors folders",
