  "descriptionHtml": "Modder&#39;s background:\r<br />I&#39;ve been working on this mod off-and on for months (several versions have been scrapped) as I&#39;ve taught myself how to work with the creation kit.  This is still a work-in-progress.\r<br />I&#39;m seeing similar mods being released.  There were none with the same name last I checked, but I thought it might be a good idea to release this pre-alpha preview so there aren&#39;t requests to name-change later.\r<br />\r<br />My goal has been to create a base tropical world using the standard assets and modder resources found on nexus.  Later, I plan to add monsters and other features from the skyrim expansions as an optional download, but that may be several months away.\r<br />\r<br />This project came from my desire for 3 things:\r<br />1. tropical climate\r<br />2. some no-load houses\r<br />3. villages to watch (possibly from no-load houses)\r<br />\r<br />My current to-do list:\r<br />[list][*][size=1]finish second village[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=1]navmesh[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=1]npc AI[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=1]lod[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=1]cave[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=1]underground village[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=1]sea creatures and coral[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=1]shipwreck and treasure[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=1]rock and landscape texture blending[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=1]monster island[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=1]basement for the inn?[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=1]grass?[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=1]recipes and collectable flora[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list][size=1]\r<br />[/size]",
