This is the best and easiest way to play Skyrim (not that you haven&#39;t a million times) now I will be adding things and tweaking this file over time. I wish I was able to find the original creator and give credit but in this case I will continue his legacy (or her). Anyway this will be provided with a .txt file with instructions on how to use and install it is very simple I will also make a video. Thanks :) ENJOY",
