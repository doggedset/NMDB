  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][i][size=4]&#34;In the grim cold of Winterhold, there is only snow.&#34;[/size][/i][/b][size=3]\r<br /> - somebody famous[/size][/center]\r<br />   Talk about season unending&#33;  The blizzard never stops in Winterhold, it&#39;s denizens doomed to take shelter in the wreckage of a dead city from a permanent storm, forever.  Even the Dovakiin is powerless to save these wretched souls, for even the formidable Clear Skies shout must bend the knee before the curse of Winterhold, the shouts effects delayed until the Dragonborn leaves town, it&#39;s legacy banished should the shouter return to the city limits.   \r<br />Powerless... unless... [size=6][size=5]Blizzard,[/size] BEGONE&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />   This is a small mod to get rid of the unending blizzard in Winterhold.  After installing this mod Winterhold should use the same weather as the surrounding area.  I got fed up of going out to the courtyard of the College of Winterhold to be greeted by a nice pleasant clear day, only for it to invariably be ruined by a snow storm as soon as I approached the town proper.  Every. Single. Time.  So after a quick bit of looking around the CK and the web, I made this mod.  It edits exactly one entry, the WeatherWinterhold region (Form ID 0010FDC6), by lowering it&#39;s priority and preventing it from overriding other regions. After all, the citizens of Winterhold have enough to worry about.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />Legal copy of Skyrim\r<br />No DLC needed\r<br />\r<br />Screenshot Credits:\r<br />My screen shots were taken with the following mods installed.  They are in no way required for this mod to operate:\r<br /> No snow under the roof by PROMETHEUS_ts\r<br />Wet and Cold by isoku\r<br />Realistic Lighting Overhaul by Sydney666 and the RLO team",
