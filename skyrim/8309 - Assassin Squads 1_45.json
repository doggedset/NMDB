  "summary": "Assassinate the Dragonborn!Squads of assassins will TRACK you down to try to KILL you. Every day of the week face exciting attempts on your life!\r\nNew Version - Balanced attacks throughout days, Levels more balanced now.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds dark brotherhood style assassins that will track you down and attempt to murder you. Can you keep your life?\r\n\r\nSquads of bounty hunters can also attack you usually near thursday.\r\n\r\nEvery day of the week you will face a variety of attempts on your life. They can range from assassin groups, Squads of Elite Assassins, bounty hunters, or an optional Deathdealer if you fall asleep on a (Loredas)Saturday(needs little more testing)\r\n\r\nThe assassins have nice gems as well usually.\r\n\r\nSuggestions and comments welcome\r\n\r\nRead latest change below.\r\n\r\n I will soon release a seperate very hard version for high level character if ppl want.\r\n\r\nFeedback appreciated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERSION 1.45\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNEW VERSION= Changed some spawns so not too many swamp you on one day sometimes. Changed around some of the assassins to be more leveled so that low level characts and high level may have a fight, changed the races of some of the squads to give them more variety.\r\n\r\nThe Deathdealer should now only attack on SATURDAY if you are SLEEPING. I have not tested to see how the sleeping works. (having some other problems.)\r\n\r\nagain I have cut down spawns. changed some levels, and variety, Deathdealer comes if you sleep on Saturday.\r\n\r\nI will soon release a seperate very hard version for high level character if ppl want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERSION 1.25\r\nFixed schedules, added more encounters with weak assassins. Added stronger elite assassins on wednsdays and fridays. \r\n\r\nWatch out on Saturday, I added Deathdealer, he very strong vampiric assassin that will love to kill you.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a group that could attack you at anyday, so that might be why some are reporting massive amounts. When you first put in mod, you will be attacked by this group, along with the scheduled enemies from that day.\r\n\r\nSo with bad luck you could run into alot. But once eliminated they should come back seperate days.\r\n\r\nPS groups take some time to respawn so after a week of various attacks, assassins should come to attack more sparsely, till more are sent after you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'\r\n\r\nthe range of battles varies. In this new version attacks are in various flavors.\r\n\r\n\r\nquestions\r\nhow do you like the encounters, is it hard enough, are you getting owned, is it too easy? Do you like the weak assassins, elite assassins, or mix of both. How did you deal with the Deathdealer?\r\n\r\nComments and feedback welcome, enjoy. =]\r\n\r\n",
