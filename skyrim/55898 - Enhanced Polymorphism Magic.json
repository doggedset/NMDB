Then use a polymorph spell to transform one of your followers into a horse. If you prefer simple inventory management then why not transform your follower (or anyone, if you need some stuff) into a chest for a moment and conveniently manage his inventory?\r<br />Do you need an anvil or an alchemy table or simply a chair? Be evil and transform someone into it.\r<br />All of this is possible with this mod and even much more as you can configure every spell so that it suits your needs.\r<br />Be an evil magician, kill your enemies with style or randomly transform anyone that annoys you. The choice is yours.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1252.photobucket.com/albums/hh565/FinalGroove/features_zps2531d9a1.png?t=1405270192[/img]\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds 20+ new spells to the game. It also comes with a small background story in form of a book which can be found in the tower south of Rorikstead. The spells themselves are also found in the tower in a chest called &#34;Polymorph Spells&#34;. You can&#39;t miss it, as it is the only chest in the tower.\r<br />\r<br />List of spells:\r<br />[list][*]Polymorph Hare\r<br />[*]Polymorph Dog\r<br />[*]Polymorph Deer\r<br />[*]Polymorph Chicken\r<br />[*]Polymorph Mudcrab\r<br />[*]Polymorph Horse\r<br />[*]Polymorph Goat\r<br />[*]Polymorph Mannequin (Work in Progress)\r<br />[*]Polymorph Chest\r<br />[*]Polymorph Fox\r<br />[*]Polymorph Sword\r<br />[*]Polymorph Sweet roll *\r<br />[*]Polymorph Furniture *\r<br />[*]Polymorph Shrink\r<br />[*]Polymorph Frostbite Spider\r<br />[*]Polymorph Hare Master (basically the same as Polymorph Hare but works within a 50m radius - overpowered)\r<br />[*]Polymorph Bedroll[/list]\r<br />\r<br />* If you have transformed someone into an animal and unchecked &#34;Only transform humans&#34; in the config menu, you are able to transform your target again and again into something else. When you hit it with something other than a polymorph spell, he/she/it will transform back to normal. Sadly, due to limitations of the game engine this &#34;again and again&#34; part does not work for the spells marked with a &#34; * &#34;.\r<br />\r<br />There are in fact four more spells, but they are WIP at the moment. So use &#34;Polymorph Choose&#34;, &#34;Polymorph Cast&#34;, &#34;Polymorph Select Race&#34; and &#34;Polymorph Set Race&#34; at your own risk.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1252.photobucket.com/albums/hh565/FinalGroove/installationv2_zpsda07c4bd.png[/img]\r<br />[line]\r<br />WIth Nexus Mod Manager [NMM]\r<br />1.
