  "descriptionHtml": "Yeah, so I modeled a dragon, but now I have no idea what to do with the nifs to get them to load in game. But I did make progress - at first, the nifs loaded in the creation kit as an exclamation point, now it&#39;s invisible. I think this has something to do with the texture paths (or something), as opposed to the settings in nifskope being wrong. \r<br />\r<br />If somebody can fix these so they load, I would appreciate it, because I don&#39;t know what do change. \r<br />\r<br />I need help, people&#33; ",
