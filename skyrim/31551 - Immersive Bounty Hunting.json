It features tough custom bandits for you to kill/capture. Once killed, take their skulls as proof to the Sigil of Justice(Bounty Hunters Guild) to claim your reward. If you want to make things more challenging try to capture the bandit alive! Once captured, you\\'ll have to escort your prisoner to the Sigil, while the harsh lands of Skyrim will make your job a lot tougher! Be prepared to protect your prisoner at all costs from rival bandits, draugrs, dragons and bunnies!\r\n  \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img543/1020/photo4s.png[/img][/center]\r\n \r\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img23/958/nbspcopie.png[/IMG]Bandits have pillaged and marauded their way across the lands of Skyrim for centuries. The Sigil of Justice has come into being, a fully independent organization bound to hunt down every last scum off the face of Nirn! In this mod, the player has been given a chance to take part in the purging of the land of the first men from vile bandits that have caused nothing but misery, death and deceit. \r\n \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img651/769/photo1t.png[/img][/center]\r\n \r\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img23/958/nbspcopie.png[/IMG]As of now, 10 highly customized bandits have been scattered across Skyrim for you to kill or capture. These bandits are known throughout the nine holds of Skyrim, and their faces have been etched on posters scattered all across the land. These bandits have varying bounties on their name and the able bodied men and women of Skyrim have been beckoned to act and bring these brigands to justice, dead or alive! Capturing the bandit alive shall give the player a much higher reward.\r\n \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img10/3724/photo1re.png[/img][/center][LIST]\r\n\r\n[*]10 highly customized bandits. Can be killed or captured! The capture system relies upon tactics. Plan your hits cautiously. When the bandit\\'s health is low enough, a pop up shall appear with two options. One will allow you to accept the bandit\\'s yield while the other allows you to continue combat and kill the bandit.\r\n[*]Once the yield is accepted, the bandit shall be equipped with prisoner clothes and his hands shall be bound.\r\n[*]At this point, the player has to safely escort the bandit across the wilderness to the Sigil of Justice (in Whiterun) alive.\r\n[*]Escorting the prisoner safely can be quite a task. Be prepared to protect them at any cost, if you want to bring them alive. If the prisoner dies along the way, then the quest changes and the only thing left to do is to take the prisoner\\'s head as proof.\r\n[*]Getting the prisoner alive can be a challenging task, therefore a much higher bounty reward is given to the player, if successful.\r\n[*]The prisoner shall follow you wherever you go, don\\'t exploit this as it can make their chances of surviving bleak.\r\n[*]Keep an eye out for your followers, as sometimes the followers will take matters into their own hands and finish the bandits off themselves.\r\n[/LIST]\r\n \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img40/1276/locats.png[/img][/center]\r\n  \r\n[center][color=#ff8c00]The Bounty Hunters Guild (Sigil of Justice) is located just outside Whiterun.[/color][/center]\r\n\r\nThe bandits are located as follows :\r\n\r\n>1 [color=#008080]Derek Tallowhand[/color]\r\nclass : 2h warrior\r\nlocation : Hjaalmarch\r\n\r\n>2 [color=#008080]Rigmor Green Hand[/color]\r\nclass : 2h warrior\r\nlocation : Eastmarch\r\n\r\n>3 [color=#008080]Hurolf Flat Foot[/color]\r\nclass : 2h barbarian\r\nlocation : The Reach\r\n\r\n>4 [color=#008080]Ruki Red Tooth[/color]\r\nclass : 2h barbarian\r\nlocation : The Rift\r\n\r\n>5 [color=#b22222]Eduard Valodius[/color]\r\nclass : 1h warrior\r\nlocation : Eastmarch\r\n\r\n>6[color=#a52a2a] Miles Mercius[/color]\r\nclass : Ih knight\r\nlocation : Eastmarch\r\n\r\n>7 [color=#800080]Vannona Moorsmith[/color]\r\nclass : elemental sorcerer\r\nlocation : Falkreath Wilderness\r\n\r\n>8 [color=#008000]Ma\\'Jidarr[/color]\r\nclass : rogue\r\nlocation : Winterhold\r\n\r\n>9 [color=#008000]Ja\\'Fizar[/color]\r\nclass : rogue\r\nlocation : The Rift\r\n\r\n>10 [color=#ffa07a]Faulgor[/color]\r\nclass : Ranger\r\nlocation : The Pale\r\n \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img856/1941/photo5y.png[/img][/center]\r\n  \r\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img23/958/nbspcopie.png[/IMG]> A LOT of features are planned and in-development.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img23/958/nbspcopie.png[/IMG]> The Guild shall be seeing new followers.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img23/958/nbspcopie.png[/IMG]> A storyline shall be incorporated with the Guild and its members.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img23/958/nbspcopie.png[/IMG]> Custom bandit bosses will also be incorporated.

Default behavior, Combat AI etc etc. Not to mention the usage of follower mods that change the way they behave. UFO followers should give you best results, this has been tested extensively, but to be completely safe, tell your follower to wait at a certain location before engaging a bandit[/color]\r\n\r\n[LIST][*]The bandits breaks \\'\\'bound hands\\'\\' animation when sprinting[/LIST]\r\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img23/958/nbspcopie.png[/IMG][color=#ff8c00]> Sadly, its the vanilla animation that had to be used for this mod. The vanilla animation tends to not function correctly when the prisoner sprints. This has been minimized as much as possible, as it cannot be completely fixed.[/color]\r\n\r\n[LIST][*]The bandits follows too close to me[/LIST]\r\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img23/958/nbspcopie.png[/IMG][color=#ff8c00]> He/she has been scripted to do that, otherwise they\\'ll keep getting lost or left behind.[/color]\r\n\r\n[LIST][*]The bandits keep dying.
