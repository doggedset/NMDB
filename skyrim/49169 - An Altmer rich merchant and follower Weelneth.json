She is Not essential and can be married.\r<br />\r<br />Location\r<br />========\r<br />You can find her in central place of Whiterun. Normally she will sell her items there, but she will dinner in Dragonsreach.\r<br />She have this A.I. to try to  give a little more life to Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />Details\r<br />=======\r<br />She mainly is a very rich merchant, selling unique enchanted jewels, unique potions and vanilla soulgems, having a lot of money, more or less 12000 gold pieces, but can also follow the player fighting side by side as powerful mage. Some items can be considered cheat item; if you don&#39;t like them, the solution is simple: don&#39;t buy them. Anyhow she is an efficient merchant that can come along with player, ever having a lot of money. \r<br />As any other follower of mine, she is not essential and can die. You can change this setting with Amazing Follower Tweaks by Dheuster.\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?\r<br />I haven&#39;t tested her under UFO, I do not particularly liked it. \r<br />I am not telling that she will not work under UFO, only that I haven&#39;t tested it.\r<br />If anyone can remember my Oblivion&#39;s Weelneth Companion, can consider Weelneth her sister.\r<br />\r<br />In my system are installed these mods.\r<br />\r<br />ApachiiSkyHair by Apachii (REQUIRED&#33;) : \r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/? \r<br />\r<br />Calientes Beautiful Bodies Edition -CBBE- by Caliente :\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?\r<br /> \r<br />Better Females by Bella by BellaGail :\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2812/? \r<br />\r<br />Natural Eyes by nevenbridge :\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3589/?\r<br />\r<br />Human eyes for Elves by Porcelyn :\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/195/?\r<br />\r<br />Seductive Lips HD by EcthelionOtW :\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22701/?\r<br />\r<br />No More Blocky Faces by Xenius :\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30/? \r<br />\r<br />Apachii Skyhair is necessary to run this file; without it the game will CTD; other listed files are optional, but changing them, the look of the NPC will be different from the look of the screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />Amazing Follower Tweaks by Dheuste(http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?) is very useful to make her a fully functional follower.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Install\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />I like very much Nexus Mod Manager, it is perfect for me. I suggest to use it, but....your choice.\r<br />\r<br />Pick which method you are going to use for installation:\r<br />\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager Installation\r<br />- = or = -\r<br />Manual installation \r<br />\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager installation:\r<br />Download the file with Nexus Mod Manager. Activate it. Done.\r<br />\r<br />Manual Installation:\r<br />Place the zip file&#39;s contents into your Skyrim/data folder to install and be sure to activate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing.\r<br />\r<br />NMM downloading problem.\r<br />I have seen that in early hours after uploading a file, NMM can not give the possibility to download new files using the button &#34;download with manager&#34;. An error message says that file do not exist. After one or two hours, the problem is automatically solved. I don&#39;t know why this happens, maybe it is related to high traffic that Nexus server is forced to tolerate. \r<br />\r<br />In this case, you can follow these instructions:  \r<br />1) Download the file manually.\r<br />2) Open NMM.\r<br />3) Hit the black arrow located in the left high button and choose &#34; Add Mod from file&#34;.\r<br />4) Locate and select the file that you have downloaded manually. \r<br />5) Hit &#34;open&#34; button.\r<br />6) From Mod&#39;s  list, select the created file and activate it. Done.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall\r<br />=========\r<br />Pick which method you are going to use for uninstall based on how you installed it:\r<br />\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager Uninstall\r<br />- = or = -\r<br />Manual Uninstall\r<br />\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager Uninstall\r<br />Open Nexus mod Manager and deactivate the file EAWeelnetMerFolNE. Done.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Manual Uninstall\r<br />\r<br />Remove the zip file&#39;s contents from your Skyrim/data folder to uninstall and be sure to deactivate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing.\r<br />----------------\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Upgrade\r<br />=======\r<br />25/Dic/2013 Version 1.0 is the initial version of this file.\r<br />\r<br />Incompatibility\r<br />===============\r<br />None known.\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues or Bugs\r<br />====================\r<br />If you decide to marry her, it is better to tell her where she can live with you BEFORE she leaves the temple in Riften.\r<br />It is possible that, if you marry her, she will use the spouse merchant container, loosing her rich merchant characteristics. \r<br />Sometimes, she seems to loose her merchant money. Loading a new cell will solve the problem.\r<br />\r<br />History\r<br />=======\r<br />1.0, 2013/Dic/25 - Initial release.\r<br />\r<br />Contact\r<br />=======\r<br />You can find me on TESNexus as eamico\r<br />You can send me an email here: eamico@tiscali.it\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r<br />Thanks to TESNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r<br />Thanks to Apachii for ApachiiSkyHair.\r<br />Special thanks to Blackie for his CM New Companions mod that includes a top-notch detailed tutorial on how to create Skyrim companions without the face discoloration bug.
