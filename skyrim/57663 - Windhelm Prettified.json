  "summary": "Spruces up Windhelm with flora and some dunmer influences.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was always so disappointed with how plain and ugly Windhelm was, so I&#39;ve made this to give it some more life. It is not lore-friendly since I have added plants and insects that would not exist in such a cold climate or grow. It also adds quite a few dunmer lanterns which I don&#39;t know the nords would like. But too bad, it looks nicer :) maybe they have grown more tolerant through the Dragonborn&#39;s influence. Also the dunmer have quite the green thumb apparently... \r<br />\r<br />I may add some more to this later or tweak, but for now I&#39;m happy with it. It was made for my personal use, but I uploaded to share. Please don&#39;t complain it&#39;s not to your exacting specifications because it was just what I thought was &#39;pretty&#39; and not meant to be perfect or to anyone else&#39;s taste except mine. I am very happy if you like it too, though&#33; \r<br />\r<br />I [i]strongly [/i]recommend the latest version of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/141/?]SFO[/url]. Without it, you may have floating lanterns, since the vanilla trees will look different/be diferent sizes. \r<br />\r<br />Please note that in the screenshots I am also using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55063/?]Trees in Cities[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27845/?]Christmas Lanterns[/url]. It just means the fancy Christmas tree in front of the palace and a few extra trees. Not a major difference. I rec those mods if you want it exactly the same&#33; ENB used was [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42957/?]Mistveil ENB Shades of Autumn[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Cleaned with TESVEDIT. \r<br />\r<br />For this mod you will need:\r<br />[list][*][size=2]Skyrim.esm[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Update.esm[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Dragonborn.esm[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />There will be no version without Dragonborn because the mod uses so many assets from it.",
