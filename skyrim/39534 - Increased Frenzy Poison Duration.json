  "modName": "Increased Frenzy Poison Duration",
  "summary": "Increases the duration on alchemy-created Frenzy potions to 30 seconds.  Why should Illusion mages get to have all the fun?\r\n\r\nRequires Dragonborn DLC",
  "descriptionHtml": "The 10 second duration on Frenzy poisons makes them not very useful, wearing off before enemies even have a chance to engage one another. This makes a poisoner feel quite gimped in comparison to a mage with minimal perk points invested into the illusion tree.\r\n\r\nThis mod seeks to balance that by giving an alchemists\\' Frenzy potions the same 30 second duration as Frenzy-based spells, while leaving the non-alchemy poisons at their default of 10 seconds. Magnitude is unchanged.\r\n\r\nParticularly brave adventurers may find that a certain ingredient has the potential to create Frenzy poisons with an even longer duration, in a lore-friendly way.",
