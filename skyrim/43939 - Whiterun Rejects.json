  "summary": "A small encampment of the lowest of the low class white run citizen",
  "descriptionHtml": "A run down slum full of homeless whiterun citizens.  It\\'s navmeshed, they walk around or sleep, they don\\'t have much to say, as with most hobo\\\\\\'s they\\\\\\'re content enough to wander around.  Their stench says more then words could anyway.\r\n\r\nThis mod doesn\\'t serve a purpose other than to add a slum.  I may, perhaps, turn this into a quest one day.  But for now it\\'s just something to look at while adding more of a 3rd dimension to the world.  Everyone\\'s a warrior, or priestess, or bandit, or cutthroat/cut-purse with very few actually beggers to be found.\r\n\r\nI don\\\\\\'t like that, so here\\'s some static depression to add a layer of immersion to the outskirts of whiterun.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS IS \\\"COMPATABLE* WITH EXPANDED WHITERUN BUT THE BOARDERS DO HAVE A TENDENCY TO HEDGE IN ON THE HOMES, AND SCREW UP A FEW OF THE NPCS PATHS.  \r\n\r\nOtherwise there are zero mod conflicts.\r\n\r\nI am thinking up a quest involving these people, some scripting and some actual dialogue but for now take a deep breath of that sweet hobo air, tom-cat.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit**\r\nI have started working on a quest line for this mod,  As far as it goes I have 12 quests written down on paper, unfortunately I have suffered a loss in the family and will be taking a break from developing anything.  Track this mod if you\\'re interested in the coming quest, but don\\'t hold your breath too long",
