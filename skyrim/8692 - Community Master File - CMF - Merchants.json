  "descriptionHtml": "The Community Master Files are mods that are used to create compatibility between mods.\r\n\r\nThis file creates merchant factions that can be utilised by any mods that:\r\n\r\na) Add merchants to the game\r\nb) Add new items to the game\r\n\r\nBy connecting them together, a merchant created by one modder could sell items created by another.\r\n\r\nFor example, you might install a well-made furniture store mod. This mod would normally only contain the furniture included by that modder. If it utilises the CMF system however, *any* furniture added by a modder that is also utilising the CMF will be sold in that store. The same would work for a weapon merchant, armour merchant, or any other merchant.\r\n\r\nAs more mods come to use this system, you will be able to go to one shop where you can buy all the items you have added from all your mods.\r\n\r\nThis also lets modders focus on what they are good at. The store modder can focus on creating an amazing location and NPCs. Modellers can create items for the game, without having to worry about creating a merchant to sell them. By working together we can improve the game, create compatibility between mods, and save everyone a lot of time.",
