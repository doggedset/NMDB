  "summary": "A mod that makes guards much more dynamic, shattering their monotony and freeing them of their clone-like upbringing.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=orange]\r\nThanks to [b]reco22[/b] identifying the issue, the texture problem should be fixed as of 2.4b. My sincerest apologies go out to the community for taking so long to get this simple fix to you guys. \r\n\r\nFinals are almost over, and though it has been said before, I will be continuing work on this mod.\r\n[/color]\r\n[color=gold]\r\nWARNING: This mod is a work in progress right now, and should be treated as such. Due to a heavy work load and full school schedule, support may be scarce. Though not ideal, the community can provide support for most (if not all) issues that may arise. Please bear with me during this busy time.\r\n\r\nChanges can take up to one in-game week to take full effect. Alternatively, you can use the console command \\\"resurrect\\\" to manually force a reroll on the selected guard. Please make sure you have tried both before posting an error.\r\n\r\nDo not expect this mod to be compatable with other mods that affect guards in any way shape or form (though in some cases, it may be). Before making a post concerning a bug, please disable all other mods and try the steps above. 90% of the time, a bug is caused by an incompatability and not a problem with the mod itself.\r\n\r\nTo \\\"resurrect\\\":\r\n1) Approach guard you would like to change.\r\n2) Open your console command field (usually the ` key or ~ key).\r\n3) Click on the guard you would like to change.\r\n4) type \\\"resurrect\\\" (without quotes) and hit Enter.\r\n5) Close console command field (usually the ` key or ~ key).\r\n\r\nAlso, due to a typo on my part, some of the earlier versions were incorrectly name \\\"Lawren RNG Guards\\\" rather than \\\"Lawrens RNG Guards\\\" as they are now. If you are having issues, please check your Skyrim/Data folder and check for this error. If it exists, delete the ESP file and re-install the newest version.\r\n[/color]\r\n\r\nThis is a mod that provides hold guards with all new custom-skinned, lore and climate themed hold-specific outfits, along with randomized helm variants. No more full-helmed identical guards at every hold, and no more short sleeves in the blizzards of Winterhold.\r\n\r\nThis mod is an improved standalone version of RNG (Dynamic) Guard Helmets, going beyond just helmets and into the entirety of the Guard NPCs. It is thus incompatabile with RNG Helmets as it already includes it. If you have already installed/subscribed to RNG (Dynamic) Guard Helmets, please uninstall/unsubscribe before adding this one.\r\n\r\nAs of v2.0, I have begun work on making all guards look and behave more appropriately to their region. This includes new custom, yet balanced weapons and armor, behavioural changes, and other various tweaks to improve the immersion. You can view the changelog below for more detailed information.\r\n\r\nChanges can take up to one in-game week to take full effect. Alternatively, you can use the console command \\\"resurrect\\\" to manually force a reroll on the selected guard. \r\n\r\nAny and all questions/suggestions/comments are welcome! Just leave \\'em below and remember to rate!\r\n\r\n===Changelog===\r\nv2.4b\r\n-fixed texture packaging issue (discovered by reco22)\r\n-ensured compatability with Skyrim v1.5\r\n\r\nv2.4\r\n-added custom skin to Whiterun guards (let me know what you guys think!)\r\n-fixed some general bugs (possible reason for naked guards some are reporting?)\r\n\r\nv2.0 - v2.3c\r\n-fixed texture problem with female Winterhold guards.\r\n-added a more appropriate custom skin to WInterhold guards.\r\n-removed Winterhold skin (will revisit this tomorrow)\r\n-added new, custom-skinned armor to Winterhold guards.\r\n-added new, custom-skinned armor to Falkreath guards.\r\n-fixed excessive nudity in Falkreath.\r\n-added new, custom-skinned armor to Riften guards.
