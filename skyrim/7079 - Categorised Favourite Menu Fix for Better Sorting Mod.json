  "descriptionHtml": "This is a configuration file for favmenumodder\\'s Categorized Favorites Menu v0.1.11.2 that makes it more compatible with Headbomb\\'s Better Sorting Mod v2.04.\r\n\r\nLinks to both the AMAZING mods are :\r\n- Categorized Favorites Menu v0.1.11.2 by favmenumodder\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4862\r\n- Better Sorting v2.04 by Headbomb\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2730\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\nTo Install, just unpack the contents into the skyrim main folder or use the Nexus Mod Manager and overwrite when asked. You need to have both the above listed mods installed first. Also, if you are updating to this latest version after having already installed a prior version, click yes when Nexus Manager asks you to upgrade !!\r\n\r\nIf there is anything that I have missed, kindly let me know and I shall correct it :)\r\n\r\nNOTE :\r\n1. I do not own the config file. I have just made changes to the config file created by favmenumodder in his Categorized Favorites Menu mod. Both these mods are awesome and made game playing really easier for me. I just created this for me but thought it better to share. If this helps anyone, I\\'ll be glad.\r\n\r\n2. I might have missed some items since I could not have tested this file for all the items that exist in the game. Forgive me for that :) This has been tested for CFM v1.11.2 and BSM v2.04.\r\n\r\nThat\\'s it. Enjoy the game :)",
