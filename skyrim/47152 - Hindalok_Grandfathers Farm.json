Thank you all for your support.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]From Dovahkiin&#39;s journal:[/b]\r<br />[center][img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/47152-1-1392502041.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Hindalok (def:hope will rise;hope arise/origin: The Dragon Wars) - the name given by Yorik to his Riverwood farm.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/47152-1-1392361916.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This house reflects a medieval Skyrim and as such will not bestow untoward wealth or treasures upon its inhabitant.  Expressed by many as it being their preferred starter home - I beg to differ only in that I use it throughout the game just because I like it so much (even if I do say so myself).  \r<br />\r<br /> -----------------\r<br />Mod details (Updated to V6):\r<br />-----------------\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]All candles, lanterns, and the fireplace fires are individually controlled at the source. (Look at them and light &#39;em up or put &#39;em out.)\r<br />[*]There are four ambient light changes within the house: dark, sunrise, mid-day; sunset. (May take a game day and an entrance and exit from the house to coordinate the effects with the game&#39;s clock.)\r<br />[*]A &#39;managable&#39; amount of safe containers with just a few marked for specific items. A few are &#34;respawning&#34; as well and marked as such. (ie.- a couple of garbage barrels for emptying and the venison stew pot by the fire for restocking when empty.) Takes three days I think to respawn.\r<br />[*]A couple of notes you should probably read: both for the backstory they provide; one for an activator you might otherwise miss. (Okay. There&#39;s one secret spot.)\r<br />[*]Display for your main blade above the fireplace along with two other weapon racks on the wall beside the double bed, one on the porch table, and one in the shed. (No mannequins thank you very much.)\r<br />[*]A table setting for meals that can be set, cleared away and put back on the shelf. (No flying stuff in this house by the way. All have been collision bound that need to be.)\r<br />[*]An extra sleep spot by the fire that you can move out from under the bed. (You can conceivably have two followers in this home as it has sleep space available for three with this feature.)\r<br />[*]When the sleep mat for &#39;sleeping&#39; has NOT been put in place near the fire, the player or companion can access the marker there to lay down in front of it all cozy-like on the wolf skin rug.\r<br />[*]Several special furniture markers were also placed: one at the table for facing the fire, one on the porch in front of the chair for cuddling or backrubs,  one out at the fishing spot, one in the outhouse, and a couple by the water retrieval and waste dump area below the outhouse at the river&#39;s edge.\r<br />[*]You can bar-lock the door from inside. (The first time you enter the bar will already be down and you must lift it to exit. From that point on it will work as you direct.\r<br />[*]A number of idle markers to make companions more lifelike.\r<br />[*]It does have a place for concocting potions in the loft, an enchanting station and workbench in the shed; a tanning rack and woodchopping station outside. All other workstations are found on a short trip to town and provide a good excuse to visit.\r<br />[*]An open area for stabling your trusty horse. (The Dovahkiin&#39;s steed knows it&#39;s his home and doesn&#39;t require being fenced in like common horses.)\r<br />[*]A fishing spot as previously mentioned with lantern (supplied for night fishing) down by the river bridge.\r<br />[*]Outhouse with lantern located down wind.\r<br />[*]Target practice range behind the house. (It&#39;s also fun to shoot at the bandits up in the tower on the mountain out back .. pisses &#39;em off.)\r<br />[*]Bookshelf loader set up for at least nine of your books.\r<br />[*]A bridge spanning the river for easy access from just south of Riverwood.\r<br />[*]No dependencies on any other mods or expansion packs - just the game itself.\r<br />[*]Experienced zero drop in frame-rate on my clunker with all lights on.\r<br />[*]Naved inside and out for companion use\r<br />[*]Cleaned with TES5edit\r<br />[*]Map marked just west-southwest of Riverwood across the river.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />I created the lighting scheme in this house without ENBs, CoT&#39;s level 3 (or was it 6) darker nights, Enhanced Lighting with default settings and with Interior and Exterior effects checkmarked.  Your own settings may yield results that were not intended and might require tweaking on your end.\r<br />\r<br />-----------------\r<br />Update V6 5/13/14 \r<br />-----------------\r<br />V6 merely corrects the 7 deleted navmesh that could not be undeleted that TES5edit reported.  That utility now shows a completely clean slate for Hindalok.  Sorry this wasn&#39;t done before for those of you it may have affected.  I simply didn&#39;t know how or even if I could do it until just a day or so ago.  But now it&#39;s done.\r<br />\r<br />V6, as are each of the updates, is the complete mod. So if using it to update from a previous version I recommend getting everything out of the house, going indoors somewhere else, and do the following: Save game. Remove previous version. Start game. Save again. Install V6.\r<br />\r<br />-----------------\r<br />Update V5 2/13/14 (Pictures #7 and 7b in Image Section)\r<br />-----------------\r<br />V5 adds an outbuilding which contains an enchanting staion, a workbench, but beyond that - the perfect spot to find some privacy to relax, read a book by the potbellied stove, or simply commune with nature.  \r<br />Wooden shutters open up to a beautiful vista of the river and Riverwood with the Throat of the World loaming far above.\r<br />You can activate a tea pot once the stove is lit and it will provide you with warm mead from its respawning contents. \r<br />As with the house you activate the fire and candles.\r<br />Also brightened up the porch lantern back up at the house.\r<br />  \r<br />Relandscaped, renavmeshed, recleaned, and retested with companion in tow.\r<br />\r<br />Though each consecutive update has added yet something else to this mod, I think you&#39;ll agree that it completely adheres to and maintains its poor country origins.  It was of utmost importance that at each phase the integrity of the original mod be upheld.\r<br />And though adding an enchanting station pushed that boundary for me I did it in such a way as to make it discrete and still convenient for those who need one.  I hope you&#39;ll enjoy this new update .. and NOW I think it&#39;s finished.\r<br />\r<br />-----------------\r<br />Update V4 1/13/14 (Picture #6 in Image Section) Thanks to Zahirah for the suggestion.\r<br />-----------------\r<br />Hindalok now has a bridge so residents and their dogs won&#39;t be swept away in the river making the trip to town and back.  There&#39;s still enough room beside it to ford the river if you need to hitch your wagon for larger loads.  Will these updates continue?  I think this is the last.  (Clearly I thought wrong.)\r<br />\r<br />-----------------\r<br />Update V3 1/11/14 (Picture #5 in Image Section) Thanks to Mookeylama for the suggestion.\r<br />-----------------\r<br />By request Hindalok now has an outhouse of my own design down by the river. Lift the lid first.\r<br />There&#39;s also a new area below that with a couple of places to sit that was likely used to get water from the river and probably to dump refuse from the aforementioned privy. To hell with &#39;em downstream&#33; But that&#39;s kind of the way things were done in medieval times.\r<br />I also prioritized some of the navmesh and reworked it for the new areas.\r<br />\r<br />-----------------\r<br />Update V2  12/7/13\r<br />-----------------\r<br />Changes ambient sound levels and adds day/night differences.\r<br />Moves one candle stand by the chair to the corner by the map and chest.  Improves overall lighting.\r<br />Fixes collision on hidden stash so it can be accessed without accidentally moving it.\r<br />\r<br />Thank you so much for any feedback you might offer.  I love this game and tried my utmost with this mod to do right by it.\r<br />Take care,\r<br />gary \r<br />\r<br />-----------------\r<br />Credits:\r<br />-----------------\r<br />[url=http://www.creationkit.com/Light_Switch]Light Switch Scripts[/url] resource on the Construction Kit wiki.\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25859/?]TES5edit[/url] by ElminsterAU.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34969/?]Strotis Ovens Resource[/url] by Stroti and Tamira\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14134/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D14134&pUp=1]OpenBooks Resource[/url] by Blary\r<br />All those who make tutorials (good ones) but to [url=http://www.youtube.com/user/GophersVids?feature=watch]Gopher[/url] in particular whose contributions have been of invaluable help.\r<br />Bethesda - Skyrim and its assets.\r<br />The Dark One, his moderators and staff for keeping the Skyrim Nexus up and running for all to enjoy.\r<br />All are much appreciated.\r<br />\r<br />Mods visible in images that are not included in this mod:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25493/?]Dragonkiller Cart Reloaded[/url] by Xgrufijury\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27955/?]Lovely Jessica - Standalone[/url] by Omega99jp\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19733/?]Immersive Armors[/url] by hothtrooper44\r<br />\r<br />-----------------\r<br />Recommended immersion mods to go along with Hindalok (Not required).\r<br />-----------------\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=190651656&searchtext=]Another Sleep Mod[/url] is the best sleep mod I&#39;ve found - terrific, bug-free immersion.\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15506/?]Lightning during Thunder Storms[/url] along with COT patched - thunder can now be heard indoors.\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15524/?]Amazing Follower Tweaks[/url].
