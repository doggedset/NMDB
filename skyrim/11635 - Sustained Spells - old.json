  "descriptionHtml": "[size=1]Many thanks to those who have endorsed my work, I appreciate the recognition.[/size]\r\n\r\nI have just released version 2 of this mod, which acts and runs in a very different manner to version 1. Because of this I\\'ll be making a new nexus page so that anyone who prefers this version can easily find it should they need to, but I\\'ve updated the version number which should I think tell any of you using NMM that a new version is out, bringing you here to read this, and thus sending you here (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13450) to try the new version, I personally feel that it\\'s better, but I suppose you may not.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING: Sustained spells don\\'t increase your skills at all, so you should only use the parts of this mod to do with skills that you don\\'t mind not advancing, or that are already maxed. If any mod authors out there know how to add skill xp the same way that casting spells does then I\\'d be very grateful if you told me.\r\n\r\n===What this Mod Does===\r\n\r\nThis mod gives you a new alteration spell called Sustained Spells Menu (shown above), casting it will open a menu (also shown above) with some options for your sustained spells. Only armor, detect life, detect dead, muffle and invisibility are implemented, I may implement some conjuration spells later too. When you choose an option, it either increases your armor by 25 (plus mage perk bonus if you have it and aren\\'t wearing armor) and decreases your magicka regen by 25%, or toggles one of the other abilities and decreases your magicka regen accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf your magicka regen is too low for an option, it wont appear on the menu. If you lower your magicka regen (say, by taking off some mage robes) and it goes below 0, shortly afterwards all sustained spells will be removed. If you turn into a werewolf... they stay on, even if the transformation takes your magicka regen below 0 (although when you turn back you should re-equip your items asap so that the sustained spells aren\\'t removed).\r\n\r\n===My Other Mods===\r\n\r\nBecome a Vampire at the start: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11965\r\nBecome a Werewolf at the start: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11674\r\nEveryone Get Inside!
