All my previous known work is added to this mod, such as added details to landscape that werent there when i made the place i built and custom sounds and landscape scenery. \r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a shack/villa off the coast of riftens huge forest. I aimed to make it as lore friendly as possible to not disturb the games looks or scenery in any way while keeping detail to maximum.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s1321.photobucket.com/user/bradley_kefford1/media/BANNER3_zps3cb9c48f.jpg.html][img]http://i1321.photobucket.com/albums/u556/bradley_kefford1/BANNER3_zps3cb9c48f.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />Current list - May change in future patches\r<br />\r<br />-Lore friendly, no loading shack/villa complete with landscape overhaul around area built in while keeping navmesh intact. \r<br />-Blacksmith complex \r<br />-Leatherworking complex\r<br />-Tanning Rack\r<br />-Forge\r<br />-Sharpening Wheel\r<br />-Chopping block\r<br />-Campsite near lake\r<br />-Alchemy and Enchanting areas included as a bonus for fans of my work\r<br />-Workbench\r<br />-Duluxe bed with cabinet\r<br />-Chests/Barrels and satchels galore, all non respawnable, so enjoy putting your stuff in them :).\r<br />-Sound effects such as wind and fire crackles added by me.\r<br />-Mist effects\r<br />-Real pathway to destination \r<br />-Complete rework of surrounding forest and lake\r<br />-Archery range\r<br />-Sleep under the stars&#33;\r<br />-Your very own fisherman&#33;\r<br />-Cooking area at coast, complete with kitchen area in the shack\r<br />-Dynamic lighting effects at night pulsing through the shack walls&#33; &lt;--- ENB users only\r<br />\r<br />And as much detail you would expect from my mods. \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s1321.photobucket.com/user/bradley_kefford1/media/BANNER4_zps1572196f.jpg.html][img]http://i1321.photobucket.com/albums/u556/bradley_kefford1/BANNER4_zps1572196f.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />V.1 Release. \r<br />-Published.",
