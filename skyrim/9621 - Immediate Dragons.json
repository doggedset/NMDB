  "descriptionHtml": "News and Update 3.0\r\nMod has been redone from scratch to remove all the junk associated with it and redone with updated CK. Hopefully this solves any issues. This would not of been done if not for user [b]Iriodus[/b]. He messaged me about it and informed me of various issues. Big thanks to him! \r\nTo everyone else its not like I have been ignoring you intentionally. PMing me is the best way to get to me as it goes to my e-mail which i check every once in a while. Life has me busy\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkshop Link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=10820\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nThis works great with alternate starts and existing characters. It does not increase dragon spawn count, just enables dragons before main quest. \r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nYou no longer need to see the good old Greybeards for dragons to spawn officially.  This mod sets the variables necessarily to trigger them. Keep in mind, this does not affect spawning rate, only that they are allowed to spawn now whenever. Also remember that the game does do level checking. So you may or may not see dragons in the beginning. But you will most certainly encounter dragons without having to start the main quest.\r\n\r\nLet me know if any problems occur. It all helps. \r\n\r\nIt is worth nothing that [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3829]Deadly Dragons[/url] Provides dragons at level 1 as well as giving an increased  dragon difficulty. HIGHLY recommended if you truly want dragons from the start as well as challenging game play :)\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued support and downloads!\r\n----\r\nRecommended Mods\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3829]Deadly Dragons by 3JIou[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13423]Mighty Dragons 2 by Erkeil[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9557]Alternate Start - Live Another Life by Arthmoor[/url]",
