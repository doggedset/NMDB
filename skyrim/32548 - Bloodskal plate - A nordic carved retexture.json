  "summary": "A standalone retexture of nordic carved armor, featuring a gold surface with blood-soaked fur and markings, as well as spatters of blood on various places.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a standalone retexture of nordic carved armor. It is craftable and temperable, it requires a piece of nordic carved plus some gold bars and a few heartstones. This is because it is about 20% higher than nordic carved stats wise. Tempering it also requires a heartstone. \r\n\r\n(((REQIURES DRAGONBORN))) \r\n\r\nIt features a gold colored surface with blood-soaked fur and various markings in blood, as well as blood spatters on the armor/leather pieces. This is my second mod, so please leave some feedback, and i hope you enjoy it. \r\n\r\nIf there is a demand for a matching bloodskal blade, i can make one. \r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to lateraliss for his wonderful tutorial on how to make things standalone located here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6677\r\n\r\nI\\'m quite sure his is the only tutorial on the subject out there atm.",
