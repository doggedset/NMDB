  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=red]Features[/color][/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Vibrance Filter - (de)Saturates based on current saturation\r\n[*]fFXAA - fast FXAA\r\n[*]Luma Sharpen\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nA reasonable person would be wondering why use this instead of SweetFX?\r\n\r\nThe reason for me was somewhat obvious. SweetFX provides effects that are redundant with what ENB already does. It also seemed that the main reason packs would add the SweetFX injector was because of SMAA. The problem is that on my computer, which isn't a shabby rig, SMAA from SweetFX would consume around 6fps. So I came with a better alternative, my fFXAA uses 0.8fps on my computer, regardless of what's in the scene. I also don't see the need for contrast or tonemapping as an external shader, since that's what the palette is for. Overall, I have similar qualities for lower processing cost.\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[b][color=red]AA Comparison[/color][/b]\r\n[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/46481-2-1383691713.gif[/img]\r\n(Animated)\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[b][color=red]Future plans[/color][/b]\r\n-Maybe give Vibrance 3 settings for interior, day and night, if people deem it necessary.\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[b][color=red]Things that will not be added[/color][/b]\r\n-Tone mapping and Contrast\r\nThat is what enbpalette.bmp is for.
