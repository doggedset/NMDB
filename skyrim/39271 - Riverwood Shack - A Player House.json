  "descriptionHtml": "Riverwood is the first place that offers hospitality to the Dragonborn in Skyrim. It\\'s a place we\\'ve all been to and have connected with, but you\\'ve never been able to live there in the vanilla game before. \r\n\r\n\r\nA small shack located right across the road from The Sleeping Giant and Riverwood Trader is now open to you, as a gift from an anonymous person who has placed their trust in your hands. \r\n\r\n\r\n*** THE BARRELS AND SACKS OUTSIDE WILL RESET, DO NOT PLACE YOUR ITEMS IN THEM*** \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures \r\n--------------------- \r\n- A nice, quaint house in Riverwood that fits with the theme of the village. \r\n- Safe storage for all your valuables. \r\n- A private training room. \r\n- Weapon racks. \r\n- Archery targets. \r\n- Full Nav-Meshing. \r\n- Alchemy Table. \r\n- Enchanting Table. \r\n\r\nChangelog \r\n---------------------- \r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 - Release. \r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 - Minor Navmesh Fix. \r\n\r\nVersion 1.2 - Added Wall Fixings. \r\n\r\nVersion 2.0 - Completely redone Cellar/Upstairs. \r\n\r\nVersion 2.1 - Navmesh Fix. \r\n\r\nVersion 2.2 - Shelf Clutter, Ingredients and Hanging Ingredients. Fixed Hay Scatters. \r\n\r\nVersion 3.0 - Navmesh Fix, Added Ivy, Rugs, Map. \r\n\r\nVersion 3.1 - Picture Fix.\r\n\r\nVersion 4.0 - Fixed Note. \r\n\r\nThe main goal of this house is to make a player home that does not compromise the feel of the village it is in. I made it in best mind to keep as many amenities as possible available to the player, but keep a nice feel going on throughout the entire house, while being functional all the way throughout. Riverwood isn\\'t a rich village, it is small, quiet, and quaint, and I made the house to reflect that. Enjoy. \r\n\r\nSTEAM VERSION: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=152886047",
