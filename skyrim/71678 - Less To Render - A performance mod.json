  "summary": "A simple mod for weaker PC:s to increase frame rate. \r<br />\r<br /> ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Okay, this is a fair simple mod. For now, removes pretty much all plants from Skyrim, giving you a boost for your frames. It is script free, and does not edit any locations, so it should not affect your saved games in any way. I used blank meshes for certain objects to make them disappear.  \r<br />\r<br />I have planned to remove more insignificant stuff for game-play too. \r<br />Also FOMOD installer to pick  and a full list of removed objects is on their way. Please be patient. \r<br />\r<br />(obviously) INCOMPATIBLE WITH MODS THAT EDIT PLANT MESHES&#92;TEXTURES. \r<br />\r<br />I really appreciate feedback, since this is my first mod. : ) \r<br />",
