There\\'s an optional bat file (manual install) that teaches all the words of power from the main quest, as that quest will be broken in most cases. There is also a bat file that advances the main quest so that Dragons are enabled. These have only been tested with a new character, although you are welcome to try with any character. Results may vary depending on what quests/factions you have done.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#cc6699] [b]CHAPTER ONE[/b] [/color]\r\n[size=4] [color=#66ccff] [b] KoS: Outcast[/b] [/color] [/size] \r\n[list] [*] Player is KoS (kill on sight) to most all of skyrim.

You can enable multiple chapters at a time, although the reuslts may be unpredictable. To uninstall just remove the esp files.\r\nIf you are using one of the optional bat files, place these in the Skyrim root directory (where TESV.exe is). Then, depending upon which one you are installing, in game console type \\\"bat woop\\\" or \\\"bat MQ\\\" without the quotes.\r\n\r\nOptional files:\r\nwoop.txt - teaches  the words of power learned during the main quest\r\nMQ.txt - advances the main quest a couple of steps so that dragons are enabled (untested). Alternatively, a player could do the first few stages of the main quest beofe installing the mod.\r\n",
