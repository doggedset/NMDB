An outlaw who must live away from the imperial grasp. For whatever reason you packed your belongings in your cart and turned to the cold mountains of skyrim.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mode adds a compact camp to the mountains near falkreath close to Angi\\'s Cabin.In the cold mountains but not too far away from the forest. It is purely a roleplaying mode that i made for myself and i decided to share it. \r\nThe campsite contains a tanning rack, campfire with cooking, alchemy bench, bedroll, some storage, bear traps, lots of mead.\r\n\r\nEnjoy",
