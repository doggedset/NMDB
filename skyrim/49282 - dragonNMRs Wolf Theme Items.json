  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/fQnekwc.png[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />[color=FF0000]Retextured wolf themed items found in vanilla Skyrim and Dragonborn. Including retextures for the Ruelful Axe, Ring of Bloodlust, Ring of Instinct, Ring of Hunt, and Ring of Moon. Revamp for Rueful Axe and Ring of Hircine. More modifications and items coming soon&#33;[/color] This is my first mod and I thought I&#39;d share it since I wasn&#39;t very happy with the in-game textures of most of these items.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Rueful Axe:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[quote][i]One of Clavicus&#39;s little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshiped Hircine. When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn&#39;t stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form. The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter&#39;s curse. Clavicus gave him an axe.&#34; - Barbas[/i][/quote]\r<br />\r<br />Arguably one of the most beautiful and well designed weapons in vanilla Skyrim, it simply lacks lore friendly common sense. It weighs significantly less than common battleaxes yet is slower than most weapons. It was forged to kill werewolves yet it is not enchanted to do so. It can kill a draedra dog in one sweep but doesn&#39;t do more damage to animals or draedra...not anymore&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]New Specs:[/b]\r<br />Base Damage: 25\r<br />Speed: 0.9\r<br />[b]Enchantments:[/b]\r<br />Stamina Damage: 25\r<br />Soul Trap 5s\r<br />Animal Damage: 20\r<br />Silvered: Extra damage to Undead and Werewolves\r<br />Banished Summoned Daedra\r<br />\r<br />(A Texture was added to make the eyes glow, currently not functioning properly and will be fixed promptly)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Ring of Hircine:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />The Daedra Prince of the Hunt has given you a ring that is...pretty useless with other werewolf mods and pretty blank on its own without other mods anyways. What&#39;s the point of extra transformations if nothing else is improved to actually help &#39;control&#39; the transformations? No more&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]New Specs:[/b]\r<br />Regenerate Stamina 25% faster\r<br />Regenerate Health 25% faster\r<br />Muffled, now you can sneakily transform\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please leave any comments or suggestions or requests concerning meshes and textures. :)\r<br />Thank You&#33;\r<br />\r<br />",
