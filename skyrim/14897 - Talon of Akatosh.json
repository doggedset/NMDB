A sword with sheath, and a great sword.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Where are they???\r<br />__________________\r<br />\r<br />They are located in Korvanjund Temple.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />How strong are they???\r<br />_______________________\r<br />\r<br />They are the same strength as ebony weapons of the same type. They are unenchanted.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />How do I install this mod???\r<br />_____________________________\r<br />\r<br />I have created the file paths for you to (hopefully) make it easy.\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re reading this I can assume you&#39;ve unpacked the 7zip archive.\r<br />\r<br />Find the folder (that is right next to this Readthis file) called &#39;Data&#39;, and either copy it or drag, and drop it into your Skyrim folder (normally located at C:Steamsteamappscommon)\r<br />\r<br />Answer &#34;Yes to All&#34; when prompted by windows.\r<br />\r<br />Start Skyrim, and go to Data. Checkmark &#39;Talon of Akatosh&#39; and enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version history:\r<br />_________________\r<br />\r<br />1.0 Inital release\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />_________\r<br />\r<br />To ThorTheViking from Bethesda&#39;s forum for requesting this sword be made, and finding the image of it for me.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />_____________\r<br />\r<br />It is alright to convert this mod into other languages but the model, and texture are to remain specific to &#39;Talon of Akatosh&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />It is NOT alright to re-upload this mod anywhere.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Author&#39;s Note:\r<br />_______________\r<br />\r<br />I am unsure what my schedule will allow in the upcoming months for modding Skyrim due to my wife&#39;s breast cancer (which we also found out today is in her bones too [no cure]).\r<br />\r<br />It does keep me sane though, and help me to focus my thoughts on the battle that lies ahead for us.\r<br />\r<br />My hope is these works that help me clear my head will bring enjoyment to those that play the elderscrolls games that I have been a fan of since Morrowind.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
