The Stern will be able to take you there.\r<br />The town is lightly based on the writings of Tolkien and the town as we have seen it in The Hobbit 2.\r<br />It has (and will have more) houses with canals and small boats. \r<br />Almost every person in this town will be willing to trade with you, since Laketown is a village built by merchants. \r<br />\r<br />[center][b][color=#ffe599][size=5]AB[/size][/color][/b][b][color=#ffe599][size=5]OUT:[/size][/color][/b][/center][center][b]\r<br />[/b][img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/60236-3-1417633751.png[/img][/center]Laketown&#39;s Master owns most of the wealth of the town, and those daring enough may try to lay their hand on his treasures. In his collection he has one very special item: the Black Arrow Bow. Combined with the Black Arrows, this bow does more damage to dragons than regular bows. It is made for hunting dragons. \r<br />Apart from the master&#39;s enormous library and treasury, there are tons and tons of fish you can find outside in the town. Bard&#39;s boat contains 13 barrels of fish, and one of the houses has many more.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][center][color=#ffe599][b]PLAYER HOME:[/b][/color][/center][/size]The home is located in the cave at the end of the underwater tunnel. The diver will give you directions.\r<br /> It has five buttons which will activate parts of the furniture. The buttons are spread throughout the cave, and you have to search for them.The setup for the upper level has a magical feel to it. The lower level has been used by some stranded Nords as a refuge. They left their own furniture there.\r<br />Because of this double usage of the cave, you will find a lot of different crafting stations. \r<br />\r<br />The first time you go to the cave, you will not be able to take any followers with you. Once you have explored the cave and activated the buttons, you will find that a ghosty stag has appeared at the lower levels. He is willing to take you out of the cave to five different locations spread around Skyrim. He doesn&#39;t like busy roads or manmade structures, so the locations are not the stables or big cities. In stead, they are five natural locations. \r<br />This stag can also be summoned anywhere in Skyrim by using the spell you can learn from the spell tome. You will find the spell tome if you activated the right furniture on the upper level.\r<br />[center]\r<br />[img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/60236-1-1417634091.png[/img][/center][b]UPDATES:[/b]\r<br />[u]1.00.08[/u]\r<br />[i]There is a short questline given to you by Bard. It involves the Master, Bard and a dragon. (no, not Smaug) \r<br />This quest contains no spoilers for the third movie. I can&#39;t, since I haven&#39;t seen it yet, and didn&#39;t read the full book yet. \r<br />The questline is based on some information we already had in The Hobbit 2 (no real spoilers there too), some made-up information and an old Nordic story. [/i]\r<br />[u]1.00.07[/u]\r<br />[i]The functionality of the cave is now ready. \r<br />The added things after the lates update are: \r<br />a working teleport for you and your follower from anywhere in Skyrim. (the spell that was added in the last one)\r<br />Some more furniture that the stranded Nords took with them.\r<br />A stag inside the cave that can take you to 5 locations in Skyrim. Not to the big cities, but to some nature locations.[/i]\r<br />[u][b]1.00.06[/b][/u]\r<br />[i]Followers can now follow you to Laketown. They will have a harder time manouvering through the town, because they can not jump over fences and water. \r<br />The cave&#39;s furniture now comes with a spell tome that teaches you a spell that summons a stag. If you touch the stag, it will take you back to the cave. I have not tested this with followers yet. \r<br />The two merchants that work at home and the diver will go to sleep and into their houses at night. \r<br />All of the buildings now have an interior. Three of them are being lived in now, the others will follow.[/i]\r<br />[u][b]1.00.05[/b]\r<br />[/u][i]The cave now has some player-home furniture (a bed, an alchemy table, an enchanter, a bookshelf and a potion rack)\r<br />[/i][i]It also has two leveled predators.\r<br />[/i][i]In order to reach the cave, you can talk to the diver. He will tell you where to find the entrance. He also sells a waterbreathing-spell that anyone can cast, regardess of your skills in alteration.[/i]\r<br />[u][b]1.00.04[/b]\r<br />[/u][i]This update adds a cave that is only available under water. There is a warning for this cave above.[/i]\r<br />[u][b]1.00.03[/b]\r<br />[/u][i]Laketown now has a working jail and a few guards.\r<br />[/i][i]There is one new merchant and the other merchants have been fixed so they sell and buy more.[/i]\r<br />[u][b]1.00.02\r<br />[/b][/u][i]Laketown has changed it&#39;s location. It can now be found north of Dawnstar.\r<br />There is a ship in Dawnstar that will take you to Laketown if you open the door.\r<br />There is a new, small area where merchants will sell their goods. [/i]\r<br />[u][b]1.00.01\r<br />[/b][/u][i]Adds two merchants, \r<br />Enables you to go into the Master&#39;s House (the door is fixed)\r<br />Adds ice to the water, just like the movie.\r<br />Some houses changed position to make for better routing. [/i]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]To do list:[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />Expand the town with more houses and canals\r<br />Create the background story for the town in Skyrim\r<br />Create some custom spells and enchantments designed to fit in with Tolkien&#39;s lore and Nordic Mythology.\r<br />Add a chance of dragon attacks and a balista to shoot at them.",
