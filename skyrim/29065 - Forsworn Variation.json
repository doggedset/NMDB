  "summary": "Adds new random outfits to the forsworn - to make them seem less organized and more barbaric.",
  "descriptionHtml": "UNP and CBBE available! Working on new versions.\r\nBody required for UNP, get it here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709\r\nBody required for CBBE, get it here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod is intended to make your battles with forsworn more interesting and immersive by adding new armors (randomly) to any forsworn NPC that wears standard forsworn armor. \r\n\r\n\r\nNo expansions required! For safe use, I recommend the latest patch, compatible with dawngaurd/hearthfire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is currently two different versions (and one beta). The UNP version includes nudity, while the CBBE version currently does not. As more resources become available, I will continue adding versions for different bodies and tastes. (This includes modesty versions.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails: I have currently added several variations to female forsworn. Males do not have new gear yet, but I hope to update with new armors at a later date.\r\nNote: All gear is lootable and wearable as far as I am aware (it should be, I was very careful.) The stats do not differ at all from vanilla sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nUnzip the 7zip file and move the content of the data folder into your skyrim root folder. (Pretty standard stuff.) Activate the esp and it should be good to go.\r\n\r\nUpdating:\r\nIt should be a simple copy/paste/overwrite all existing files, as it is unlikely I will be changing archive structures in the forseeable future.\r\n\r\nUninstalling: \r\nFor a fast un-install, just deactivate and then remove the esp (note any armor you own added by this mod will vanish, user beware.) To completely uninstall you will need to remove the forsowrnarmor1 and forswornarmor2 folders from Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Meshes\\\\Clothes\\\\ and the forsworn1 and forsworn2 folders from Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Armor\\\\ and also remove the esp.\r\nEDIT: The above is still true, but new folders have been added. To completely clean it you will need to also delete the forswornarmor3 folder from Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Meshes\\\\Clothes\\\\.\r\nThere are lots of new textures in Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Armor\\\\ - Cow, Wolf, Snow leopard, Snow Tigress, Tigress, forsworn3 and forsworn4. If you want a clean untinstall make sure to remove all of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to abb1 for the Topless UNP armor, without thier permission I might never have started this mod at all. Note this is standalone, you do not have to download the original mod to benifit from my own work, but remember abb1 did all the textures and meshes for the topless armor - I cannot create meshes or textures to save my life. Find thier original mod here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7332\r\n\r\nThanks to Rekicker for the snow leopard textures! http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/886\r\n\r\nThanks to Tier1Dusty for the Forsworn Retex Compilation http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15596 which added a lot of new animal prints!\r\n\r\nThanks to Caliente and other modders involved for the CBBE meshes http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12273 and for CBBE body http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r\n\r\nThanks to dimon99 for UNP body http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709\r\n\r\nTentative thanks to MrTroubleMaker for http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20966 - as my adaption is in beta for now it might not make it to a full release any time soon, however this modder should get full credit for the work they put in.",
