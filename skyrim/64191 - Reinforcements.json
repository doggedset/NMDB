  "descriptionHtml": "[i]As usual, all the presented features don&#39;t require [b]SKSE\r<br />[/b]Should be compatible with everything\r<br />[/i]\r<br />Call reinforcements (guards and soldiers) to secure the location. \r<br />Rent catapults for a siege. \r<br />\r<br />Video Guide:\r<br />[youtube]nLgrxM80ekY[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Pre-alpha trailer:\r<br />[youtube]DKDFap_m7hU[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />You need to find a [b]War Horn[/b] or talk with Jarls about catapults.\r<br />\r<br />Note: The Jarl dialogue will appear ONLY if one of these requirements is met:\r<br />1) Complete the main questline\r<br />2) Complete the Civil War questline\r<br />3) Become a Thane\r<br />\r<br />After you find the horn  (Nord or Imperial) you will recieve a power. You can use the spell only if you have a War Horn in the inventory and only in exterior. \r<br />\r<br />The power[b] &#34;Blow War Horn&#34; [/b]have multiple puposes:\r<br />1) Call infantry to secure current location.\r<br />2) Place catapult at current location\r<br />3) Order to shoot\r<br />\r<br />[b]Call infantry:[/b]\r<br />Guards and soldiers will travel to your location. No money is required. No new NPCs are generated, guards are taken from the nearby cities and forts. They will hold the location for 36 hours.\r<br />\r<br />The party size depends on\r<br />- Quests completed\r<br />- Dungeons / forts cleared\r<br />- The Thane states\r<br />\r<br />The max size is 25 soldiers. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Place catapults [/b]\r<br />You need to rent catapults first by talking with a Jarl (the cost of the catapult depends on a Jarl and your speechcraft). \r<br />You will recieve the Military Equipment Documents. If you want to place catapults while blowing the horn, you need to have these documents in your inventory, otherwise only infantry will arrive.\r<br />\r<br />After you called the reinforcements, you have 3 game hours to place the war machines. Just blow you horn and the catapult will arrive at the selected location soon.\r<br />\r<br />After 3 hours passed you cannot summon any new catapuls, but you can move the existing ones (use the power &#34;Move Catapult&#34;).\r<br />\r<br />[u]Known issues: [/u]Move Catapult sometimes doesn&#39;t work. You need to save, quit the game completely and reload. This is an engine problem and I&#39;m not able to resolve it\r<br />\r<br />The vanilla Civil War catapults are purely cosmetic weapons, they can&#39;t seriously damage anyone. Catapults in this mod are like suppressing tools, they stagger the enemy but don&#39;t give too much damage (for balancing purposes). However, they can be very effective against regular infantry.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Order to shoot[/b]\r<br />You can shoot catapults yourself by activating them. Or you can order shooters to activate catapuls by blowing your horn.\r<br />Place catapuls near the infantry and/or place your followers near the catapult. They will serve as shooters. \r<br />\r<br />Blow your horn to shoot. Don&#39;t go too far away or no one will hear your horn (the catapult and the shooter must be loaded into memory, so the maximum distance depends on uGridToLoad).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Important[/b]: [i]THE CATAPULTS WON&#39;T SHOOT WITHOUT SHOOTERS.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />If they got distracted by the enemy or if the enemy gets too close to the catapult, the machine won&#39;t respond to your horn anymore. Defeat the enemy, adjust shooters and use &#34;Move Catapult&#34; to restore the shooting ability.\r<br />\r<br />[i]If you like it, check my other tactics-related mods:\r<br />[/i][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57589/?]Mixed Unit Tactics[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62184/?]Hold and Defend[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37277/?]Stealth Kills for Followers[/url]",
