  "summary": "Adds a craftable, temperable, and enchantable dragonscale shield with the dawnguard shield model; thats it. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "I really liked the dawnguard shield model, but didnt like that there wasnt an enchantable version that had the stats of the best light shield in the game, so i made this. This mod adds a craftable, temperable, and enchantable dragonscale shield which uses the dawnguard shield model.  This does not replace the dragonscale shield. The shield has the same armor rating and weight of the dragonscale shield. \r\n\r\nI\\'d load this mod after your Dawnguard.esm or high texture pack esms if you have them. This mod uses the default dawnguard shield model and texture, so if you replace them, they will be used by this mod. You need the Dragon smithing perk to craft and improve it.* DAWNGUARD REQUIRED *",
