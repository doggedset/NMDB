  "descriptionHtml": "[b]WARNING: IF YOU HAVE BEEN USING THE OLD VERSION, PLEASE UPDATE. \r<br />\r<br />[/b]With one of the newest patches of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64798/?]Campfire[/url], Chesko has added two new ways of lighting campfires, with Flames spell or with a torch. However, neither of these give Camping experience, which I find very irritating. Arguments can be made both for and against, but I think that camping is a skill of utilising all of your available assets to survive, and sure enough for a mage being able to conjure flames is one of them. \r<br />\r<br />The most disappointing fact was that there was no option to toggle that on or off. Which is a shame, because I love when mod authors give the players options to tailor the mod to their needs. So, if you are like me, and think that the new Campfire system is way too robust and complicated when compared to old Frostfall, install it, and presto&#33; You can now both have the cake and eat the cake. \r<br />\r<br />This mod doesn&#39;t modify any of Chesko&#39;s scripts. Instead it adds its own, which advances the Camping skill in a parallel way, when you use the torch or flames options in the Campfire menu. \r<br />\r<br />Obviously, to install it, you must have newest Campfire (1.6+)\r<br />\r<br />(Update 25-02-2016)\r<br />\r<br />Well, isn&#39;t this ironic. A day after first release, Chesko updates Campfire to 1.7. The NEW system is more intelligent, but it still won&#39;t advance the camping progress with Flames. Thus, a new version, which again, advances both the Destruction (new feature in 1.7) and camping. Have a cake, and eat a cake. \r<br />\r<br />Credits: \r<br />Chesko, for making Campfire, with amazing modders&#39; resources. \r<br />Aetherius, for supplying raw Magicka to our characters. ",
