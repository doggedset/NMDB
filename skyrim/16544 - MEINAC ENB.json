  "descriptionHtml": "GUYS I\\'ve played like 1% of the game so I\\'d really appreciate your screenshots outside of the locations where every single one of mine are shot PLS. Thanks\r\n\r\nI\\'m turning this into an ENB mod. I\\'ve managed to use enbseries\\' CAMERAFX to help further simulate dynamic glare so I might as well include everything. My enb was a frankenstein tweak of of an amalgamation of mostly sung9533\\'s work on shaders and depth of field bokeh, and trillville\\'s colours/tone mapping.\r\n\r\nSo to reiterate, some of the features are:\r\nglare based on human eyes\r\nhigh resolution sun and sun glare texture that does not go through objects\r\ngrain free sky and glare\r\ndynamic sun glare\r\nseparate interior day/night lighting\r\nsung9533\\'s famous bokeh(based on the classic early versions)\r\nssao with low performance hit\r\nno overly dark shadows\r\nas well as all the bells and whistles featured in enb 0.157 including volumetric sun rays and translucent rain.\r\n\r\ndark nights are optional in a Realistic Lighting plugin but recommended\r\nother recommended mods:\r\nENB Weather by JawZ: no link, nexus page down (makes shadows really pretty)\r\nRelighting Skyrim: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17609 (self-explanatory)\r\nTorches for realistic lighting: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8741 (if using the dark nights pulgin)\r\nCinematic fire: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2692 (I would just use the legacy version. Dragon falmes and fireballs are jaw-dropping when used with this) \r\n\r\nGet the enb 0.157 dll here: http://www.enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0157.htm and overwrite everything.\r\n\r\n \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                       \r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                  \r\nLegacy readme below:\r\n                                                                                                                                       \r\nMY EYE IS NOT A CAMERA, now with high-resolution sun texture\r\nI did lie before, but it really was supposed to be the final version! Here\\'s the story:\r\n\r\nI discovered the Sun texture was actually responsible for a lot of the graininess in its gradient sections (not as noticeable without ENB). I was surprised to find no one had made a sun texture, so I did my own. Now it\\'s completely grain free! Ugh and to think I spent all that time trying and trying to fix the wrong texture. While I was there I integrated the glare into the sun to make it seamless- it was the best way to stop the sun from shining through even when it\\'s completely blocked yet still allowing glare to be imposed over objects while partially exposed. This really should be final, I\\'m pretty proud of it and don\\'t see how it can be improved any further given the limitations of the system without a dynamic glare.\r\n\r\ntldr;\r\nHigh resolution sun\r\nTailored for ENB\r\n100% grain free\r\nSeamless\r\nSun does not go through things (think the horrible mass effect flares of penetration)\r\n\r\nLatest 3.1 update: There really was nothing more I could do to the sun or glare itself, but I found a way to tweak the ENB to make the glare a lot more intense without grain over objects:\r\n\r\nNEW SETTINGS:\r\nSunIntensity=6.0\r\nSunDesaturation=0.0\r\nSunCoronaIntensity=3.5\r\nSunCoronaCurve=3\r\nSunCoronaDesaturation=0.2\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \r\n                                                                                                                                     Old description:\r\nAttempts to simulate how the eye perceives glare rather than camera lens flares or fake god rays.\r\nMade to be ENB compatible. Additionally the sun no longer shines through objects.\r\n\r\nTo install, replace sunglare.dds within the sky folder within textures, or create the folders within the data folder if they don\\'t exist.\r\n\r\nUse these settings if you have trouble making it look right with ENB:\r\nSunIntensity=6\r\nSunDesaturation=0.0\r\nSunCoronaIntensity=1.2\r\nSunCoronaCurve=0.8\r\nSunCoronaDesaturation=0.2\r\n\r\nfor a Grain free experience\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n(1.5)\r\n(1.4)\r\n(1.3)\r\n(1.2) ENB settings and mini me version uploaded.\r\n(1.1) Tweaked to look better with ENB\r\n(1.0) Internal",
