  "descriptionHtml": "[size=+1]\r<br />A very simple mod that changes the merchants restocking time to 0 so that merchants restock every time you buy/sell something from/to them.\r<br />\r<br />Effects:\r<br />1. Merchants never run out of gold. You can dump everything you looted from an adventure to a merchant without worrying he doesn&#39;t have enough gold.\r<br />2. You can buy unlimited potions/ingots/soul gems/you name it from merchants so your gold is now more useful.\r<br />\r<br />My other mods:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54415]Soul Trap Redone[/url]\r<br />[/size]",
