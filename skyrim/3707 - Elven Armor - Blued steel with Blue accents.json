  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE:\r\nThe Blued steel elven armor and weapon set is now complete. I uploaded one file for ease of use, no need to have to download the female texture separately any longer. \r\n\r\nI\\'m currently working on making this set craft-able, but am getting errors still. I can make an item already in game that isn\\'t normally able to be crafted craft-able. When I try to then my the blued steel elven set separate from the original I run into problems. This is all new and foreign to me so if anyone has suggestions for future updates or tips on the craft-able items let me know. I\\'d like to get this part over and done with so I can get back to the artsy stuff.\r\n \r\nThis upcoming update will be for the people like me who enjoy the armor on their character but not on every npc that uses the elven set. \r\n\r\nI\\'ve also started working on re-texturing(in hi-res) the elven set pretty much from scratch. The resolution on these will be on most textures at least double their originals. This of course is much more of an undertaking than the recolor was and will likely take a little while given the holidays and how busy I am already.\r\n\r\nGlad to see people enjoying the recolor as much as I do. \r\n\r\nSplincir\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI did this for myself but figured i would upload it. If interest is expressed I will definitely work on others. Mostly though I just wanted to share so enjoy. \r\n\r\nComplete recolor for the Elven armor and weapons is now done.\r\n\r\nHope you like it and enjoy,\r\nSplincir\r\n\r\nInstall instructions:\r\n\r\nOpen file via winzip or winrar,\r\ndrop the \\\"data\\\" file located within in your skyrim main folder.\r\nconfirm the merge of data file as the file hierarchy is as it should be.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n\r\nopen your skyrim main folder navigate to data/textures - then go into armor and weapon folders and delete the elven folders and or files.\r\n\r\nIf someone out there likes the recolor enough and wants to use it in a compilation of some sort please just pm me for permission. Thanks.",
