  "descriptionHtml": "I was disappointed with how low the damages were for the crossbow bolts in dawnguard, so I raised the steel bolts to 23, and the dwarven to 25. I also only recently figured out how to use the creation kit, so I&#39;m sorry if it doesn&#39;t work, or has issues. I don&#39;t know how to fix them. So far I&#39;ve had no conflicts.Â ",
