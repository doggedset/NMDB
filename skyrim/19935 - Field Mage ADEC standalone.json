ALL THIS CONTAINS IS NEW ADEC MESHES.\r\n\r\nAll credit goes to Echo for making these to begin with, all I did was refit them. As well as Acdale, for his amazing ADEC body. You will need a physics skeleton, since it has bouncies.\r\n\r\nNo I won\\'t fit to any other bodies. No I won\\'t do anything with it. If you think you can improve it you\\'re welcome to it.\r\n\r\nLong live ADEC! ",
