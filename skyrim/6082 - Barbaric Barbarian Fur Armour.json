  "descriptionHtml": "[color=lime]WezEllison\\'s Barbaric Fur Armour[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][size=2]Modders make these to make the game more enjoyable for you, I don\\'t ask for money but if you like what you see please Endorse to show your appreciation, thankyou.[/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=lime]Why have you done this?[/color]\r\nI was playing around in nifskope \\'cause I wanted a break from college work. I then came up with this design & I was just going to delete it but then I thought someone on nexus might actually want it. It is very basic and only took about 5 minutes (if that) to put it together.\r\n\r\nAt the moment it replaces the fur armour (the one with the fur skirt only) so you\\'ll see bandits wearing it.\r\n\r\nYou can change it to replace any armour you wish, so let\\'s say you want to replace the steel plate cuirass you would do this:-\r\n\r\nbody1m_0 ---Rename to---> nordplatem_0\r\nbody1m_1 ---Rename to---> nordplatem_1\r\n\r\n[color=lime][size=2]INSTALLATION[/size][/color]\r\nExtract the contents into your Skyrim Directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=Red][size=2]INCOMPATABILITIES[/size][/color]\r\nIf you\\'ve got anything that changes or replaces the same armour I have.",
