If you want to load all soul gems all you do is type \\\"bat allsoulgems\\\" without the quotes and hit enter. Your game may stall for a moment (I know mine does) but soon it should add all items in that file. You can add your own items to them as well by adding the player.additem code to a new line with the amount specified. Default amount is 1 for each item.",
