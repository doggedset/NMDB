  "descriptionHtml": "Ahoy,\r\n\r\nMy goal here was to make a mod that successfully removes health regeneration while still allowing you to regenerate via Potion/Ability/Enchantment.\r\n\r\nThe mod should work with any mod with enchanted items/potions that affect regen, however if you use an ability that affects your regen (besides ones in vanilla skyrim) it will not be able to recognize them. So Histskin will still work, but if you have a new effect that causes healing not in base game, won\\'t work.\r\n\r\n",
