  "descriptionHtml": "Somehow replacing the ugly texture of eyevampire_02 (PC vampire eyes) with that of 01 caused CTD to me, and the 02 eyes is a disgrace to my character. \r<br />I fixed that by doing a simple tweak in CK, which makes PC vampire eyes use eyevampire_01 texture, now my character looks better.\r<br />\r<br />The eye texture used in &#34;After&#34; pic is from Seranaholic, but I don&#39;t know its origin, and neither do I care. \r<br />This mod will only make your PC vampire use eyevampire_01 texture, but doesn&#39;t provide one for its user. \r<br />You&#39;ll have to get yourÂ eyevampire_01 texture from The Eyes of Beauty, or whatever mod you favor.\r<br />\r<br />And no, my mod doesn&#39;t change your characters&#39; hair color.",
