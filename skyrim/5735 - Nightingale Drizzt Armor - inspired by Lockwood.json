  "descriptionHtml": "Another retexture of the Nightingale armor, this time I was trying to make it look similar to Lockwood\\'s design for Drizzt Do\\'Urden\\'s armor. I\\'d recommend you use a faceless Nightingale mod if using the hood. \r\n\r\nP.S. - I don\\'t know how, but would love to see a mod that gives more skin color options. The darkest skin tone on the Dark elves just doesn\\'t seem black enough for a Drow!? AND purple eyes for the dark elves :)\r\n\r\nI\\'ve yet to try any 3d modeling, so this is as close as I can get with retexturing only... couldn\\'t do the white fur scarf/cloak. I\\'m new at this! \r\nStarted with the Nightingale Prime texture but changed it drastically. Added a leather texture to overall armor and smoothed out texture on cape. Colored as I saw fit.\r\n\r\nAs always, I welcome any suggestions for changes/improvements.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n-> Tod Lockwood \\\"inspired\\\" design. ...not really close enough to actually need permissions...\r\n\r\n-> Nightingale Prime HD Armor - author?? (has been taken off the Nexus I think?)\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nSimply extract the Data folder in the Skyrim folder.\r\nTypically:\r\nC:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim\r\nor\r\nC:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim",
