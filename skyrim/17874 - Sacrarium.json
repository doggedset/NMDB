  "descriptionHtml": "Sacrarium is a Player House based off Dovahkiin Hideout by Shawk. \r\n\r\nI made this for other liked minded players who wanted a place to show case everything they\\'ve collected in the game from the unique to the mundane. Although Dovahkiin Hideout was a great place for it being a hideout it stayed trued to its roots. I found it lacked the upscale grandoise feeling  that I wanted even though that might not be typical of a hideout. Hence, Enter Sacrarium.\r\n\r\nSacrarium is just the start of something much bigger as this is my first hand at modding anything, however I will be updating it weekly as I have a a lot of plans for it.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nExtract to Data folder or use nexus mod manager\r\n\r\nHow to find:\r\nLook for the trap door in BreezeHome Whiterun or any of the Vanilla Player Houses\r\n\r\nAll comments, criticisms and questions are welcome. I\\'m new to this but I try to learn fast.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n - All Followers Can Enter\r\n - No In-compatabilites Yet\r\n - Weekly Updates\r\n***Grand Trophy Hall***\r\n -16 Mannequins\r\n -9 Dragon Priest Mask Display (Courtesy of Shawk)\r\n -8 Display Stands \r\n -24 Weapon Racks\r\n -2 Extra Long Tables w/ seating\r\n -A Throne (Just for you)\r\n -Some Furnishings without Clutter (Carpets + Flora) More to come\r\n***Crafting Hall***\r\n -Many Customized Chests for most different Item Categories (Will take requests)\r\n -Full Crafting Station (Alchemy, Cooking, Enchanting, Smelter, Smithy, Tannery, Work Bench, Wood Chopping Block)\r\n***Main Hall***\r\n -Doors to Vanilla Player Homes + Winterhold & Ragged Flagon (Courtesy of Shawk) Can only be unlocked once you have bought said homes.\r\n -1st of a Number of NPCs (Sells Wares that are level specific and limited in stock but open 24 hours)\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\nVersion 0.1.2\r\n - Added Key For RaggedFlagon Teleport/Trapdoor in Honeyside Home; look for a chest (Solves issue of some NPCs unlocking master skill door)\r\n - Added Key For Winterhold Teleport/Trapdoor in Master Quarters; look for a chest (Just a security measure for compatibility) \r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious:\r\nVersion 0.1.1\r\n - 8 Display Stands *Updated Missing Stand*\r\n - NavMesh in BreezeHome *Updated*\r\n\r\nVersion 0.1\r\n - Oldest Version\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting:\r\n1.
