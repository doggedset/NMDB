  "descriptionHtml": "Each command will max out the respective skill and add all perks in the corresponding tree.\r\n\r\nJust type \\\"bat ------\\\" in the console (press ~ key) and replace ------ with the command you want to execute.\r\n\r\nFull list:\r\n\r\nmax_allskills\r\nPretty self-explanatory, will take you to level 81 with all perks and all skills at 100\r\n\r\nmax_combat\r\nWill give all perks and max all skill levels in the Combat skill class (Archery, Block, Heavy Armor, One-danded, Smithing, Two-handed)\r\n\r\nmax_magic\r\nWill give all perks and max all skill levels in the Magic skill class (Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Enchanting, Illusion, Restoration)\r\n\r\nmax_stealth\r\nWill give all perks and max all skill levels in the Stealth skill class (Alchemy, Light Armor, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Sneak, Speech)\r\n\r\nindividual skills:\r\n\r\nmax_alchemy\r\nmax_alteration\r\nmax_archery \r\nmax_block\r\nmax_conjuration\r\nmax_destruction\r\nmax_enchanting\r\nmax_heavyarmor\r\nmax_illusion\r\nmax_lightarmor\r\nmax_lockpicking\r\nmax_onehanded\r\nmax_pickpocket\r\nmax_restoration\r\nmax_smithing\r\nmax_sneak\r\nmax_speech\r\nmax_stealth\r\nmax_twohanded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n****NOTE**** \r\nSome of the console commands are not the same as you would think by looking at the skill tree, ie the Archery skill is actually called \\\"Marksman\\\" in the console. The commands above ARE the same as the skill tree, so what you see is what you get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nExtract the .txt files to your Skyrim directory, probably looks like C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nMake sure the FILES are in the \\\\Data folder, not just the \\\"maxmod\\\" or \\\"Skyrim maxmod\\\" folder.\r\n",
