  "summary": "Breakdown convert and craft SoulGems from fragments and normal gems.\r\nBuilt based on the info I obtained from the site below:\r\nhttp://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1286593-tutorial-making-new-smithing-recipes-pre-ck/",
  "descriptionHtml": "Originally designed for use with my Orcish Artificer (Kraarg), gifted with the ancient art of Rune Wizardry passed down to him by his orcish forefathers - (he refused to trade with humans and elven wizards for soulgems, never used magic directly, only through crafting). Praise Malacath!\r\n\r\nAt the forge:\r\n\r\n1) Smash and breakdown empty or filled SoulGems into SoulGem fragments. With larger soulgems providing more fragments. (Fragments cost 5 gold in skyrim and you get the full value of each empty soulgem in fragments from each one broken down). \r\nI included breaking down filled gems incase you filled a large soulgem with a petty soul inside, but the soul is lost in the process and doesnt contribute to the number of fragments gained.\r\n\r\nInfo - The only way to distinguish empty and filled soulgems is by having a different number of each in your inventory (as recipes dont show a soul gems current state i.e empty or filled) \r\n\r\nAt the smelter:\r\n1) Reforge SoulGem fragments (from the ones randomly scattered in dungeons or from the process above - interchangeably) and recombine into empty Petty SoulGems.\r\n2) Combine 3 empty petty soulgems to make a empty lesser soulgem, x2 lesser=common, x2 common=greater, x2 greater=grand, either x3greater=black or x2grand=black\r\n(These values are purely based on the cost of the resulting object)\r\n3) You can transform and enchant normal gems through sacred spiritual practices, transforming them into one or more soulgems of equal value.\r\n\r\nAdditional: Two optional replacement esps\r\n1) Reality: With perk requirements to make the soul gems: \r\nPetty needs Enchanter 1 perk, lesser=enchanter2, common=enchanter3, greater=enchanter4, grand and black enchanter5.\r\nAll gems to soul gem conversions require the insightful enchanter perk.\r\n2) Gritty Reality: As 1 but also reduced the amount of soulgem fragments produced by breaking soul gems. This is to emulate the fact that you only get around a 1/4 of the base value from items when you sell them and then buy another item in skyrim i.e sell an item for half its base value and buy items for double their base value. This should more closely resemble selling gems for money at vendors and buying soulgems from vendors with that money\r\n\r\n",
