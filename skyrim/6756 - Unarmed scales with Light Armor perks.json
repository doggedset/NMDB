  "summary": "Adds Unarmed perks to the light armor tree.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds Extra effects to the Light Armor tree perks that improve your Unarmed combat. They\\'re added to light armor because Unarmed doesn\\'t improve a weapon skill, but your armor goes up while fighting, and Heavy Armor seemed too bulky to fight with your hands in.\r\n\r\nThe added effects are:\r\n\r\nEach point into Agile Defender increases Unarmed damage by 20.\r\nCustom Fit adds 10 points of stamina damage to Unarmed attacks.\r\nMatching Set has a small chance to disarm opponents with power attacks.\r\nUnhindered and Wind Walker each add 20 points of Unarmed damage.\r\nDeft Movement gives power attacks a chance to paralyze enemies for a second.\r\n\r\nThere is a version of the file that require light armor equipped to gain the effects of the damage perks, and one without armor limitations.\r\n\r\nAdded a version that only adds effects to Custom Fit, Matching Set, and Deft Movements. This is so you can use a different Unarmed Scaling mod and still get my perk benefits.\r\n\r\nIn the curved scale version, the damage perks are:\r\nAgile Defender: +10, +10, +10, +20, +30\r\nUnhindered and Wind Walker have been increased to 30 each to keep the same max damage.\r\n\r\nWith all of the perks, this adds 140 damage, 10 stamina damage, and power attacks a chance to disarm or paralyze, making Unarmed just as viable as one or two handed.\r\n\r\nI also added a \\\"Fists\\\" weapon that you can hotkey or add to favorites that shows your current Unarmed damage, accounting for perks, enchantments, and racial claw abilities. You MUST have the fists equipped to use the stamina damage, disarm, and paralyze perks, but the raw damage effects work for your normal fists too.\r\n\r\nTo get the fists, type \\\"help Fists 0\\\" into the console, and look for \\\"(WEAP)Fists 0x########\\\"\r\nthen type \\\"player.additem [##########] 1\\\". the fists are quest items, so you cant drop them. If you want to get rid of them, use \\\"player.removeitem [########]\\\".\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\nSpecial effect perks (Stamina Damage, Disarm, and Paralyze) won\\'t work with your actual fists, you have to have the Fists item equipped.\r\nSpecial effect perks also only work when punching with your right fist, the damage perks affect both.\r\nThe disarm perk has a very low chance of triggering, despite setting it to go off 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows how to fix any of these, leave a comment. Everyone else, have fun with your usable fists!",
