  "summary": "Adds new metal and gem combos to craft.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod started simply as proof of an explanation in the mod request forum. In making the 1st \r\nring I realized most of what I was explaining while usually true, was wrong since gems are \r\ncolored by the mesh not the texture. So since I had started I figured I might as well finish it \r\nand share what I had. \r\n\r\n\tHaving used the unlimited rings and amulets mod and knowing it\\'s limitation for user \r\nchanted jewelry, I know there is a least a small group of people who will appreciate this mod. \r\nThat being said, some of the pieces I want to transform will take a bit of work more than the \r\nrest. So I will start simple and go from there. The better the mod does the more I will try to \r\nget the harder pieces out there.\r\n\r\n\tSo here is the list of what is added in this mod\r\n\r\nGold Sapphire Necklace\r\n\r\nSilver Emerald Ring\r\nSilver Sapphire Ring\r\nSilver Topaz Ring\r\nGold Amethyst Ring\r\nGold Garnet Ring\r\nGold Ruby Ring\r\n\r\nTopaz gemstone\r\nFlawless Topaz gemstone\r\n\r\nrecipes for rings in forge under jewelry.\r\nrecipes for gemstones in smelter under Misc.\r\nHopefully both stones are in the lists correctly for mining and loot.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nAll screenshots are with Jewels of the Nord active. Without that mod your rings won\\'t look like \r\nthat. This mod only changes the Gem/metal combos it doesn\\'t do anything to the textures.\r\n\r\n    The rings still swap out places with others of player chanted type if used with Unlimited \r\nRings and Amulets. I looked all through the toolset and couldn\\'t find where to change this. \r\nThere is at least one mod here on the nexus I found that says it will let you equip more than \r\none player chanted ring. Will have to try that one, and hopefully it will work or maybe they \r\nwill know how to make both mods compatible. For now this one will just have to offer extra \r\nchoices.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n\tMade using 1.8 CK but only main skyrim esm used so should be ok for anyone version wise \r\nand doesn\\'t require any DLC yet. Meshes are standalone not replacer so only way for a conflict \r\nis if the other mod also edits the 5 gem lvl lists. Load order should fix any conflict and the \r\nrecipes can be used as a backup or main path to get it.\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\n\tThis is a Nexus exclusive mod. It may NOT be uploaded anywhere else, especially not \r\nSteam Workshop. I\\'d rather choke and die than see my work there. Anything else just ask 1st. As long as it gets posted on the Nexus I\\'ll prolly be thrilled. Also conversions to Oblivion or \r\nFallout are ok, again as long as they stay on the Nexus.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n\tI edited the meshes for the rings myself, so obviously they are original game meshes \r\nthat belong to Bethesda. All other work done by me.\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n\r\n0.1 - Added Silver Emerald ring, recipe for ring\r\n\r\n0.3 - Added 5 more rings and recipes, 2 new gems and recipes, and added gem to leveled lists\r\n\r\n0.4 - Added Gold Sapphire Necklace",
