  "descriptionHtml": "I have been noticing a popular trend regarding alot of player made RaceMenu presets, and that is really UGLY and really UNREALISTIC characters. For what ever reason that may be, it doesn&#39;t seem to be getting any better. But fear not, I am here.\r<br />\r<br />As for what makes me more qualified to make super mega rad characters, not much to be honest. But with that being said, I have been a CG modeler and artist for about 10 years, and have studied the human face for a very very long time. I also believe that is why i sometimes see things in peoples characters that most do not. That is also why I am starting this whole series of RaceMenu presets:) This is the first of many characters to come that I have made to make all of your characters super beautiful/badass. Be ready for more&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Eldran Requirements: THIS IS A NORD-ONLY PRESET\r<br />RaceMenu\r<br />Brows\r<br />Apachi Hair\r<br />\r<br />Highly recommend you use Mod Organizer, but you should be able to install manually as well with no problem.\r<br />\r<br />For the screenshots, I am using RealVision ENB.\r<br />\r<br />ALSO, I am open in helping make NPCs. But i have no idea how to, and am not savvy with the creation kit at all. If anybody needs help modeling a custom character for there mods, don&#39;t be afraid to contact me&#33;",
