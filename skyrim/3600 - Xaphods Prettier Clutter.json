  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Xaphod\\'s Prettier Clutter\r\nAlpha 0.1.1\r\nBy Rob \\\"Xaphod\\\" Goforth[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]What does this mod do?[/i]\r\nImproves the look of most random interior and exterior objects by increasing texture resolution (in most cases by a factor of 2, in some cases by more) and in most cases rebuilding the normal maps.\r\n\r\nThe increase of resolution was obtained using filters and image texture overlays; for the most part the textures look very similar to the original; throughout creation of this mod all effort was made to ensure that items continued to fit with the Skyrim world.\r\n\r\n[i]Installation instructions[/i]\r\nUnzip the textures folder and place it into your skyrim/data folder.\r\nTo uninstall, simply delete those files.\r\n\r\n[i]Compatibility[/i]\r\nXaphod\\'s Prettier Clutter is compatible with most mods, however only one alternate texture can be in use at any time so other mods that modify the clutter textures may be overwritten, in this case I would suggest looking at each file and deciding yourself which you\\'d prefer to keep.\r\n\r\n[i]Performance issues[/i]\r\nAll this mod does is increase texture resolution for a variety of items; those with lower specced computers or lots of other mods involved may experience slowdowns or increased crashes, in this case I\\'d recommend ensuring you are using the Skyrim 2GB loader.\r\n\r\n[i]Notes[/i]\r\nThis file package also includes the improved pelt textures from my Hi-res Pelts mod.\r\n\r\n[b]Update 0.1.1[/b]\r\nThe update package is available as a patch from 0.1 to 0.1.1 or a new standalone download.\r\n\r\nChange Log:\r\nIncreased resolution of barrel textures and furniture wood/dresser.\r\nAdded subtle black lines back onto alchemy workbench.\r\nImproved small sack texture, making it look like the same burlap material as the large sack.\r\nTiling of crate textures fixed.\r\nBarset tiling revisited and additional texture overlays added to barset.\r\n\r\n[i]To do[/i]\r\nSome items may need to be increased in resolution further and more items may be included in future versions. As always, feedback and endorsements welcome.\r\n\r\nIf you like this file you might also like my High (Res) Hrothgar texture pack. \r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3182",
