  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE: The new file now includes a scabbard! Menu error is still present, can\\'t figure out 1st person models still.\r\n\r\nFirst mod, made this to try to get myself used to working in Nifscope and the construction kit to mostly working results.\r\n\r\nThis mod places a one-handed version of the Ebony Blade in Dragon\\'s Reach (same location as the Ebony Blade is vanillia). The mesh has been altered to make it shorter; it\\'s about the same size of an Akaviri Katana. It uses the vanilla textures still for now, everything looks fine except for the bottom of the handle. So don\\'t look there.\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\n-The Katana seems to find its way under the table quite often\r\n-The inventory model does not show up (Screenshot showing this)\r\n-Hopefully nothing else\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nFile paths should be correct, simply drop it in you Skyrim folder\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nMaking me cry. Delete EbonyBlade1H.esp in Data and Ebony1h in Meshes/Weapons.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nAny textures that alter the Ebony Blade will most likely change this as well.\r\nThe sword also fits in my characters hand oddly in the screenshots, that\\'s because of a Character Creation Editor I used to modify his proportions. \r\n\r\nFor the curious, the armor is Saskia\\'s armor from the Witcher 2 Models here on the nexus.\r\n",
