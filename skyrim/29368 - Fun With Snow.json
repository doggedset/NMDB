  "descriptionHtml": "This is a Very Unstable and dangerous spell. banned by the Wizards College. The Individual hit by the projectile will Die because A huge snowpile will grow from Inside and the damage it does to the body is horrible. do not use on living things.\r\nThere is one spellbook in every house in Riverwood and one behind the lumbermill on the table where you find the Woodcutter axe. The Spells name is SnowDrift.\r\n\r\nThis spell is powerfull, it cost 100mana pr projectile. and you shot one and one projectile.\r\nthe snowpiles are big and last for 80 sec, or you can pick them up (wierd i know)\r\nThe piles apears only when use of the snowdriftspell. so you don`t have to be scared of other magican out there. \r\n\r\nI Made this Mod to use as a fun factor in game, no other purposes. not aiming for realism here :) have fun, Winter is coming to Skyrim :p This mod have some Clips in Graphics on snow, but the fun and things you can do make you forget that. :)",
