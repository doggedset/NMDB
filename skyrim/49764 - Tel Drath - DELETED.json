  "summary": "A Telvanni tower in Solstheim",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a player Telvanni mushroom tower in Solstheim, i originally made this for myself for a character that i carried over from Morrowind. but thought id upload it. its near Bloodskal Barrow, where the reavers usually are. it got 3 other houses other than the main tower. most of the area and interiors are navmeshed but there are some errors sometimes, and followers may sometime be unable to enter the main tower with you. but i didnt fix that since it fits for a Telvanni to be isolated anyways. the other three houses though work fine for followers. \r<br />\r<br />What it contains:\r<br />A fully furnished tower along with the Imbuing chamber (used to make spider scrolls), staff enchanter, and all other crafting gear a wizard needs.\r<br />3 additional house pods that your followers can live in.\r<br />New spells, includes Waterwalking and Summon Dwemer sphere.\r<br />A small garden outside with ingredients that will be useful for mixing potions.\r<br />\r<br />There is no Readme file, but its pretty basic. if you have any questions or bugs to report leave it in the comments. Happy experiments&#33;",
