  "summary": "Stops NPCs from being interrupted just because you get up in their faces. Alternate version decreases reaction time so they move out of your way faster.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever get too close to a talking NPC and accidentally interrupt something important because they get creeped out by you and suddenly back away, stopping everything they&#39;ve said and going, &#34;Uh, wha?&#34; instead? Worst game behavior ever, especially since scripted conversations between multiple NPCs will continue despite it. Worry no more - now you can get as close as you like without worrying about invading their personal space.\r<br />\r<br />You can still get them to move out of your way by sprinting into them, and the cooldown timer between bumps has been reduced for that very purpose.\r<br />\r<br />Alternatively, there is another version of the mod which decreases the reaction time so that NPCs will shut up and get out of your way as soon as you get too close.",
