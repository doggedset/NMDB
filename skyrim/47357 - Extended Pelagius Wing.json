  "descriptionHtml": "As the title says, this mod extends the pelagius wing, if you have ever tried to 'coc' there before, you may have noticed an 'OLDbluepalacewing01' which many people think is better than the one included in the game, this area was left with no doors to enter with so i have connected it to the pelagius wing, the door is right next to the main door.",
