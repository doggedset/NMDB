  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/d01C8VN.png[/IMG]\r<br />[size=2]By Aiyen  [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Description:  [/size]\r<br />A set of models and textures with the aim to provide yet another alternative for people when it come to ice related stuff. \r<br />I have tried to make sure it looks decent both with ENB presets on, as well as without. \r<br />So far I only cover the large icicles, and the small ones. I also cover the frost atronach. \r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Technical Info: [/size]\r<br />Textures are 2k normal and 1k diffuse DXT5 compressed. Except a reflect map which is 512 DXT5 compressed. \r<br />This mod should not cause any issues unless you have  &lt;768mb VRAM and your kitchen utensils have more processing power then your computer.  Even then it will most likely run fine. \r<br />If you require lower resolution versions there are many free types of software that can help you out, even quite a few here on nexus. If you would like a higher resolution version I have to disappoint. I simply do not see a reason to on these models. \r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Installation:  [/size]\r<br />It is simple textures and meshes use your mod manager to install and remove like any other. Folder structure should be correct&#33; \r<br />Keep in mind that all models link to my textures and not the default vanilla ones&#33; So you cant just download another ice texture mod and use it along with these models without some copy pasting&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Compatibility:  [/size]\r<br />As long as you do not use another mod that overwrites the same meshes and textures (A bit unlikely though&#33;) everything will be good. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Known Issues:  [/size]\r<br />Q: The Icicles vanish during snow storms&#33; Help&#33; \r<br />A: Due to the way ENB handles transparency then when you view the icicles from certain angles then they will look almost like the vanish entirely. Other then making a completely nontransparent model there is nothing I can do about this. If there is enough request for it then I will upload such a version later. \r<br />\r<br />Q: The icicles flicker sometimes&#33; What am I doing wrong?\r<br />A: Again transparent objects and skyrim... it is just not always pretty&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Q: Will you make a refracting version?\r<br />A: Most likely not since I think that shader cause too many issues. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits: \r<br />Bethesda for the game and all the goodies to play with&#33;\r<br />Sparrowprince for lots of help and perhaps also a mesh or two.. I kinda forgot&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Permissions: \r<br />If you want to use these assets in your own mod, please ask me first&#33; I will most likely agree it is the best idea since icecream&#33; \r<br />I do not give permission for these assets to be redistributed to other sites then the Nexus. \r<br />",
