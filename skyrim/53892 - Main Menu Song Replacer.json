  "descriptionHtml": "=INTRODUCTION=\r<br />\r<br />Have you ever felt like &#34;Ok, this is good but I think we can make it better&#34; looking to some particulare aspect of a game? Have you even thought about having this or that particular thing (music or other) added to your game, thinking it would&#39;ve been glorious to have that instead of the original one? I&#39;ll let you know one secret: I constantly think about that. I always look for customization, in every aspect of things I do, the things as they are are never enough for me. So that&#39;s where my mod come out, ready to be enjoyed (hopefully XD).\r<br />\r<br />=MOD DESCRIPTION=\r<br />\r<br />To put it in a simple way, this mod replaces the main menu music theme with a brand new one. The nice thing is that I don&#39;t just come here with one theme to install. No: you have three songs to chosse between&#33; That&#39;s right, my friends, you can chose the one you like better and have it in your game as the main menu theme&#33; For this mod I chosed three song I really enjoy listening to. One is from the lovely Malukah, wich is the author of the famous &#34;The Dragonborn Comes&#34; cover, so often used as a replacement for the main menu music theme. The second one is from a very talented girl called Kate Covington, wich made a lot of vocal covers from various videogames (Final Fantasy, Silent Hill and many, many others). She has a beautiful, mesmerizing voice, as you will see. Last, but not the least, we have a cover of the Sovengarde main theme, performed by a girl with a lovely angelic voice, called  Stephanie Young. Just listen to her version to see yourself how hypnotic her voice is&#33;\r<br />\r<br />~UPDATE: 11/05/2014~\r<br />\r<br />I just added three more songs to the list. Two of the three tunes I added are from the original game OST and are the Dragon Fight Theme songs. I added them both because I guessed it would&#39;ve be nice to have them play in the background while you&#39;re in the main menu, instead of the vanilla song. The third one I added is not actually from Skyrim, as you can guess from the title. Originally it was the Morrowind Main Theme and this guy, KawlunPlaysGuitar, recorded a guitar metal version of this tune, making it far more epic and inspiring, at least in my humble opinion. Check this out, because it does really worths a shot.\r<br />\r<br />=INSTALLATION=\r<br />\r<br />[With Nexus Mod Manager]\r<br />\r<br />1 - Click on &#34;Download with manager&#34; button\r<br />2 - When finished downloading, just double click on the mod to activate it\r<br />3 - Overwrite everything if prompted\r<br />4 - Enjoy your listening&#33; :D\r<br />\r<br />[Manual Installation]\r<br />\r<br />1 - Download any version you like to have\r<br />2 - Unzip the archive&#39;s content to your desktop or wherever you want\r<br />3 - Copy the extracted Data folder to your Skyrim folder\r<br />4 - Overwrite everything if prompted\r<br />5 - Enjoy your listening&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[With Mod Organizer]\r<br />\r<br />1 - Download the file in any way you like (manual or downloading with manager)\r<br />2 - During the installation, make sure to click on &#34;Manual&#34;, then right click on the &#34;Data&#34; folder and, then, on &#34;set data directory&#34;\r<br />3 - Click ok and and then activate the mod\r<br />4 - Enjoy your listening&#33;\r<br />\r<br />=CREDITS=\r<br />\r<br />I would like to say a big THANKS YOU to these three girls:\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://www.youtube.com/user/malufenix]Malukah[/url]\r<br />[url=https://www.youtube.com/user/katethegreat19]Kate Covington[/url]\r<br />[url=https://www.youtube.com/user/Jessismith2000]Stephanie Young[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Wich composed and recorded the songs I used for my mod.
