May re-add those in the future.\r\n- Removed Blood Magic perk, as Unearthly Will overlaps its function.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nKNOWN ISSUES\r\n\r\n- Death Shroud: not working as intended at the moment (only applying VFX)\r\n\r\n- If by any reason you need to add/remove perks, use the console to do so. Here\\'s a quick tutorial: http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Console_Perk_Codes_(Skyrim)\r\n\r\n- Wanna know the perk\\'s IDs? Follow these intructions:\r\n1. Lets say you wanna add the Immortal Blood perk.\r\n2. Open the console window and type \\\"help immortal\\\" or \\\"help blood\\\" and hit enter.\r\n3. Use Page Up / Page Down to scroll the text until you find the PERK entry number (or ID).\r\n4. Now type \\\"player.addperk perkID\\\" and hit enter, and there you go.\r\n5. You can do the same to remove perks with \\\"player.removeperk perkID\\\" should you wish to respec.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS\r\n\r\n- As this is a BETA / Work In Progress (WIP), I recommend you BACKUP YOUR CHARACTER FILES, and do so periodicaly.\r\n- If any ability is no longer working or not displaying correclty after an update, or if by any reason an update removes or adds a new perk, it is recommended you reload your backup or remove/add back those through console.\r\n- Perks might have their functionality changed/adapted since this is a BETA.\r\n- If you use another vampire mod (I strongly recommend using Better Vampires by Brehanin), its usually better if you move it DOWN in the load order (to make it load after my mod). There might be exceptions though.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCOMPATIBILITY\r\n\r\n- Should be compatible with most vampire mods, including reverse vampirism ones, but some might cause unexpected results that I cannot predict.\r\n- Incompatible with mods that remove vampirism.\r\n- Incompatible with non-vanilla vampire races.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFAQ\r\n\r\nQ: How do I download and install the mod?\r\nA: Download the file, extract it, then put the files in your skyrim/data folder.\r\n\r\nQ: Why aren\\'t the new perks showing up for me?\r\nA: This may be caused by conflict with another mod that alters the Vampire Lord \r\nperk tree, in which case you will have to choose the mod you want and move it DOWN in the load order in the Data Files window.\r\n\r\nQ: Do I actually NEED the Dawnguard DLC to use this mod?:\r\nA: The latest version requires Dawnguard. I did, however, upload the original (discontinued) version which does not requires DG.\r\n\r\nQ: Do I have to be a Vampire to buy the perks?\r\nA: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ: Will you nerf perks that are too powerful and buff the ones that are too weak?\r\nA: i will do so regularly, and when I have the time, based on feedback. If you think a perk is too powerful, you should first try increasing the difficulty in the options menu, and please keep in mind that Skyrim is *not* an MMO or a online game.\r\n\r\n\r\n+++++ PLEASE READ THE MOD DESCRIPTION BEFORE MAKING COMMENTS +++++\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
