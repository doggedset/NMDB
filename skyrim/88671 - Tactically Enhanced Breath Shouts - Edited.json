  "summary": "DragonFire - Tactically Enhanced Breath Shouts made by NRVNQZR<br />I liked this mod but I think it's too overpowered and I don't like his new one because Fire Breath makes an ugly fire when it hits the ground or anything that can block the fire and I'm just not feeling the Frost Breath in the new one.<br /><br />That's why I edited his mod.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I didn't change the cooldown or anything else.\n<br />All I did is change the attack power of the shouts into a less ridiculous one.Â \n<br />Although the first and second words may be too weak to some... oh well just in case someone like this one I'll put it anyway.\n<br />Credits to NRVNQZR, the one who made the mod.",
