  "descriptionHtml": "I always wanted a nice beautiful cosy place to call home, Ive tryed alot of other peoples mods but they just didnt satisfy me after a while so I have attempted to create my own home all with no load doors so you can hear all the outside world from inside the house, bit more immersive I think, there is a map marker right next to riverwood you cant miss it, install manually and make sure you have activated the file in \\\"data files\\\" \r\n\r\n(WORKING PROGRESS)\r\n\r\nUPDATED TO 1.0: Added lots of objects outside and changed the outside around a bit, now with lighting inside and more things inside, Added a little chicken area, fishing spot has been moved to just a little one out the front of the house, bridge complete to house, Also has an easter egg :) nothing to exciting but just a little bit of fun for you to find and be rewarded for your efforts, still not follower friendly yet sorry, as i said before I never use creation kit and have no idea how to do somethings but that will be in the next update along with more added things to the inside and outside, hope you enjoy and feel free to leave me feedback on any ideas to make it better.\r\n\r\nRiverwood Home Beta Trailer-\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKsqrExHSt8&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nRiverwood Home 1.0 trailer-\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RZ6iWCog8Q&feature=youtu.be",
