  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve seen a lot of mods flying around the Nexus giving Lydia different armor, overhauling her appearance, etc.- with this mod, Lydia&#39;s steel armor is not intrinsically tied to her very soul.\r<br />\r<br />When you first meet her, she will [i]probably [/i]be naked- not sure, haven&#39;t tested it. However, this means she will wear any clothing/armor you give her, as well as use any weapons. She&#39;s happiest in heavy armor with a sword and shield, but she&#39;s your follower; go nuts.\r<br />\r<br />Happy yelling at her for getting you stuck in a door way&#33; Good luck, please endorse it if you like it. This&#39;ll be my first mod, I&#39;m hoping to maybe make a few more.",
