  "descriptionHtml": "This mod balances the Candlelight and Magelight spells&#39; emitted light. Every tweak was carefully tweaked and tested many times to achieve optimum immersion and balance.\r<br />\r<br />There are similar spell light mods like this already available, but more discerning users like myself found them too unbalanced, unimmersive, and/or overcomplicated. This mod simply and elegantly fixes the light spells, adjusting them to how they should have always been.\r<br />This does NOT edit the duration, magicka cost, or textures of the Candlelight and Magelight spells.\r<br />\r<br />FEATURES\r<br />-Less blue color. The light is desaturated, so everything it illuminates isn&#39;t tinted so strongly. Now illuminated objects will be closer to their true colors.\r<br />-Slightly less intense illumination. Now the light won&#39;t ramp gamma and contrast levels to such ridiculous levels, so it won&#39;t be so blindingly bright if you look at anything very bright/close. This also has the added benefit of reducing the contrast between darkness and the spells&#39; light, meaning that it&#39;s easier to see outside the circle of illumination.\r<br />-Slightly increased radius. It&#39;s a balanced and logical distance, yet the area is wide enough that the light doesn&#39;t feel restrictive and nearly useless.\r<br />-Equipped light spells in the hand emit more light, illuminating the character.\r<br />-Magelight can now be cast with a limit of 3 NPC-unbound light sources.\r<br />\r<br />ISSUES\r<br />This mod is probably bug-free, since it&#39;s very small and only edits vanilla values.\r<br />\r<br />However, mods that edit the Candlelight and Magelight spell data will probably conflict.\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALLATION\r<br />Delete &#34;ImprovedLightSpells.esp&#34; in &#34;&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;&#34;. There are no scripts or non-vanilla additions/changes, so it won&#39;t cause any problems if you remove it mid-save.",
