  "summary": "Food in general is weak, but Vegan food in particular was useless. This simple mod changes that.",
  "descriptionHtml": "SSE Version, improved version, includes more Veganized foods and recipe tweaks including baked goods from Hearthfire:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10613]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10613\n<br />[/url]\n<br />&gt;&gt;What does this mod do?\n<br />A simple food mod that buffs the benefits of 17 food ingredients (all the Vegan ones), nothing else.\n<br />This mod does NOT remove any non-vegan ingredients or armor. \n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;Who is this mod for?\n<br />Vegans &amp; Vegetarians &amp; people that like healthy food.\n<br />People who want to be Veg, but cannot in real life. \n<br />People that find food in Skyrim to be weak. \n<br />People who want a new experience.\n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;Why did I make this mod?\n<br />Close to 10% of the population is Veg, but there isn't a mod for us. I was frustrated with useless Vegan food. Also I am an ex-Runescape player and miss the glory days of food that is the primary source of healing.\n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;Is it lore friendly?\n<br />Yes. Vegetarians/herbivores exist in all  parts of nature &amp; animals including humanoids. \n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;Is this mod balanced?\n<br />It isn't balanced compared to non-vegan food. None of the foods are overpowered though. Most are scaled for early to mid game progression. Some will be useful all game like Sweet Roll (renamed Vegan Sweet Roll) heals 30 health &amp; boost magicka regen by 50% for 10 sec. The 3 complex Vegan Soups give a tiny 30 minute buff, similar to \"well fed\" from World of Warcraft.\n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;Is this mod compatible with iNeed or Realistic Needs?\n<br />Haven't tested it. The food benefits would conflict of course. Not sure how the need requirement would trigger though.\n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;Is this mod a series?\n<br />I plan to add more Vegan foods &amp; clothes in the future.\n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;Here is what the mod changes:\n<br />1. Apples now heal 12 up from 2.\n<br />2. Apple Cabbage Soup now heals 50 hp &amp; 1 magic every second for 30 mins.\n<br />3. Apple Pie renamed Vegan Apple Pie. Now heal 30 hp &amp; boost magicka regen rate by 50% for 10 sec. \n<br />4. Bread now heal 8 up from 2.\n<br />5. Cabbage now heal 12 up from 2.\n<br />6. Cabbage Potato Soup now heal 30 hp &amp; 1 hp for 30 mins.\n<br />7. Cabbage Soup now heal 30 hp.\n<br />8. Carrot now heal 12 up from 1.\n<br />9. Gourds now restore 15 stamina.\n<br />10. Leeks now heal 12 up from 1.\n<br />11. Leeks (grilled) now heals 15 up from 6.\n<br />12. Potato now heal 12 up from 1.\n<br />13. Potato (baked) now heals 15 up from 5.\n<br />14. Sweet Roll renamed Vegan Sweet Roll. Restores 30 hp &amp; boost magicka regen rate by 50% for 10 sec.\n<br />15. Tomato now heal 12 up from 1.\n<br />16. Tomato Soup now heal 25.\n<br />17. Vegetable Soup now heal 50 &amp; 1 stamina for 30 min.",
