HUGE BUG FIXES! SPECIAL THANKS TO MY FAITHFUL TESTERS: Nightskia, spintochick, badgremlin, and avpke for all their hard work, thorough bug finds and modding guidance! [/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=skyblue][b]Story[/b][/color][color=white]\r\n\r\nThe Pit goes on for miles, some say. Throat of the World? Meet the Mouth of Hell.\r\n\r\nMany avoid it out of fear. What\\'s inside it? Was it put there by some great evil? Does it lead to Oblivion itself? None that have gone in have ever come back. According to myth, even the great Springheel Jack III jumped into the Pit to discover its secrets, but he hasn\\'t been seen in ages.\r\n\r\nThey say that all who are unlucky enough to stumble upon it are doomed to cast themselves inside.\r\n\r\n[/color][color=skyblue][b]Info[/b][/color][color=white]\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Pit. Skyrim didn\\'t have a bottomless pit, and I thought it needed one. It\\'s a bit of a mini game that makes you think and react vertically instead of horizontally. To find it, there are two treasure maps in Skyrim. One is in the corner of the desk in the Thieves Guild HQ. The other is on the corner of the desk in the College of Winterhold\\'s Arcaneum. For those who make it to the “bottom”, there is a bit of a prize waiting so good luck!\r\n\r\n[/color][color=skyblue][b]Installation[/b][/color][color=white]\r\n\r\n[/color][color=red]No DLC\\'s required![/color][color=white]\r\nIf you don\\'t already use the Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) download it and use it to start Skyrim.\r\nUnzip the contents of the .rar into your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\nClick merge, copy and replace when prompted.\r\nAny old files will be overwritten in the process.\r\nMake sure The Pit.esp is checked on in the Data section of your Skyrim loader, then Exit out and start with SKSE.\r\n\r\n[/color][color=skyblue][b]UnInstall[/b][/color][color=white]\r\n\r\nUnnecessary for updating to a new version. Make sure you want to do this before moving forward.\r\nDelete The Pit.esp from your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\nDelete botpitmap.png from your Skyrim/Data/textures/clutter/books/images folder.\r\nDelete botpitteleport.pex, ninjajump.pex, and nofall.pex from your Skyrim/Data/Scripts folder.\r\nDelete botpitteleport.psc, ninjajump.psc, and nofall.psc from your Skyrim/Data/Scripts/Source folder.\r\n\r\n[/color][color=skyblue][b]Notes[/b][/color][color=white]\r\n\r\n[/color][color=red][b]Fun Fact![/b][/color][color=white] The Pit is deeper than all of Skyrim is long.\r\n\r\nThe Pit mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit. There are no dirty edits as of v2.5.\r\n\r\nThe only existing cells that has been modified are Wilderness 38,-18 and 38,-17 in the Tamriel Worldspace.\r\n\r\nTwo of the scripts included are very simple and only affect two Game Settings: fJumpHeightMin and fJumpFallHeightMult. They will not work without SKSE. The third script is a fix for Bethesda\\'s faulty autoload doors. This one does not rely on SKSE, but is absolutely essential to play this mod.\r\n\r\nThe texture file is for the treasure map.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=skyblue][b]Version History[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=white][b]v2.5\r\nGeneral:\r\n- added new form list to enchantment properties so it can be unenchanted and added to any clothing/armor\r\nPit: Tamriel: Wilderness 38,-18\r\n- added new scripted trigger to autoload into the Caverns at 100% success rate with no gaps\r\n- removed dirty edits for three aspen trees, moved the statics to a new location\r\n- repositioned map marker, unchecked \\\"can fast travel\\\" so it will work right with the map\r\n- fixed overlapping black planes jitter\r\nPit: Interior: Thieves Guild HQ\r\n- moved Note from disabled safe to corner of desk\r\nPit: Interior: Caverns\r\n- applied new imagespace lighting and fx template\r\nPit: Interior: Nordic Tomb\r\n- added stairs to both sides of stone pools\r\n- reduced fog for better distant visibility when falling\r\n- adjusted imagespace lighting for better contrast and saturation on ring lights\r\n- deleted two instances of the waterfall from the first pool that were colliding with the ring and obscuring it\r\nPit: Interior: Deep Freeze\r\n- rotated water plane on left side of second pool to fix falling underwater glitch\r\n- applied new imagespace lighting and fx template\r\n- added collision planes on the sides of all ice pillars that lack collisions to avoid \\\"falling through the level\\\" glitch\r\nPit: Interior: Depths\r\n- split cell into 2 cells: Depths and Sunken City with new load doors between\r\n- replaced all critter spawners with fish-only versions (no more dragonflies underwater)\r\n- fixed the \\\"black screen error\\\" caused by bad imagespace settings\r\n- created a new transition effect between cells\r\n- rotated blue moving crystals on left side of Snow Elf statue to look more rooted in the rock crevaces\r\nPit: Interior: Falls\r\n- replaced autoload door to link from sunken city\r\n- added new imagespace\r\n- spaced out spikes near first drop so that it is possible to avoid them\r\n- fixed autoload door gaps with triggered script\r\nPit: Interior: Dwemer Vent\r\n- added new imagespace\r\n- fixed autoload door gaps with triggered script\r\nPit: Interior: Molten Core\r\n- replaced missing lava texture with fire wall\r\n- flipped upside down spiderweb that was causing odd collision with bones\r\n- added more pitfalls and traps\r\n\r\nv2.12, v2.13, v2.14, v2.15, v2.2, v2.2.1, v2.3.1\r\nunreleased versions, only used for testing\r\nall fixes listed above in v2.5\r\n\r\nv2.1\r\nAdded steps to all the ponds so they are easier to get out of.\r\nAdded new mineral-based lighting to Depthscell.\r\nIncreased ambient lighting in all interior cells.\r\nFixed smoke clipping with black planes in Tamriel.\r\nSpaced out some pitfalls for better flow.\r\nFixed hundreds of clipping issues with rocks and other static meshes.\r\nReduced current speeds in Falls.\r\nFixed falling through pond issues where depth settings were too shallow.\r\nMade chest in Depths cell easier to reach.\r\nAdded docks to Depths cell for easier navigation.\r\nFixed shadow-casting light errors in Depths.\r\nAdded new underwater visuals.\r\nFixed spider webbing on cave shaft pieces that weren\\'t matching.\r\nMoved spawn points on loading to reduce falling damage.\r\nReplaced glowing blue ball FX as activators with static version.\r\n\r\nv2.0\r\nRemoved all DLC requirements.\r\nReplaced Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLC attributes with vanilla ones.\r\nAdded two new dungeons: the Depths and the Falls.\r\nFixed trigger inconsistencies in Tomb cell.\r\n\r\nv1.2\r\nRemoved Hearthfire DLC dependency.\r\nAdded map marker.\r\nFixed some clipping issues in Tamriel and Pit cells.\r\nFixed some lighting issues on smoke FX and spiderwebs.\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\nInitial release.\r\nAll 3 DLC\\'s required.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=skyblue][b]Future Plans[/b][/color]\r\n[color=white]Create a corridor and balance maze.
