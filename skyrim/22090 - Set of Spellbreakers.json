  "summary": "The Daedric artifact \\\"Spellbreaker\\\" is a very powerful artifact. But sadly it does not fit to any other equipment you can get within the game. This mod puts an end to this parlous situation. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "The mod adds a perk to the smithing skill tree, with which it becomes possible to craft Dragonplate, Dragonscale, Daedric, Orcish, Dwarven, Ebony, Glass and Blade\\'s Shields with the Spellbreaker Enchanting. A skill of 85 in smithing and either Ebony or Glass Smithing is needed to skill this perk. The Shields themselves have the same stats as their original counterparts.The materials needed to craft the shields are the same as for the regular shields, with the addition of one filled black soul gem.\r\nShould not interfere with any other mod.\r\n\r\n[b]Lore friendly version is out[/b]\r\nThe Dovahkiin will be able to reforge the Daedric Artifact \\\"Spellbreaker\\\" to fit his equipment.\r\nChanges compared to the original Version:\r\n-The original spellbreaker is needed as crafting material for the new one and thus destroyed during the reforging process. Mind that you can reforge your spellbreaker only once!\r\n-The newly created item will have the name \\\"Reforged Spellbreaker\\\", no matter which set it is from\r\n-As it lies in the nature of Daedric Artifacts that they can\\'t be disentchanted, the whole enchanting thing has been removed\r\n\r\nMake sure to have only one of those two mods loaded at the same time, as they will most certainly interfere with or overwrite each other\r\n\r\n\r\n---Changelog 0.9.2---\r\nworkaround for the \\\"Ward permanently shows when an enchanted shield is equipped\\\"-Bug:\r\n-removed visual effects from the enchanting. The original shield and those ones crafted by smithing will show the ward effect as usual, only custom enchanted ones will miss it (but will work anyway).\r\n\r\n---Changelog 0.9.1---\r\nAdded the possibility to disentchant the Spellbreaker itself as well as any other shield from this mod to get the Spellbreaker Enchantment. This can from now be applied to all shields.\r\n\r\nView my other mods:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31173]Extended Carryweight[/url]",
