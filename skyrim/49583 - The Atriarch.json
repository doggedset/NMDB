You can use any forge in the game to make the staves.\r<br />\r<br />To find the location of the Atriarch&#39;s you will need to go behind the Guardian Stones near Riverwood, and read the book called &#34;The Atriarch&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />There are now two versions a &#34;Overpowered&#34; version which is the original, and a new &#34;Nerfed&#34; version where the staves and spells do 20% the original amount.\r<br />[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]qtYAd4-Z63c[/youtube]",
