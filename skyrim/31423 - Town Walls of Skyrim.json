  "descriptionHtml": "I was a bit disgruntled by the idea that some of the Hold capitals had no city walls. I mean this is a mideaval style world, in an area where few people actually use magic. \r\nThere would be walls to keep the animals out if nothing else, I mean come on a troll could romp into town from any direction. \r\n\r\nTowns changed: \r\nMorthal & Dawnstar. \r\n\r\nI didn\\'t change Winterhold, as the city was heavily affected by the events that destroyed most of it.\r\nWhich would include the subjective depression of the people living there....\r\n\r\nUpdate 2.0\r\nFalkreath now has a wall, this is the last wall I will be adding to this version of Town Walls,\r\nAs Riverwood don\\'t in my mind rate a town wall, i won\\'t be making one.
