  "descriptionHtml": "[u][b]Description :[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Simple hairline textures, work like warpaints, makeup or tattoos.\n<br />\n<br />The concept is already exist but my mod give a easy way to put the desired color. \n<br />\n<br />There aren't plugin because I don't known how to create ^^'. Replace dirt face texture. But you could use my textures to replace all of you want for your personal \n<br />\n<br />use of course.\n<br />\n<br />Now when your character wear a helmet or hat, he/she will not be bald anymore because hairline stay. Like you could see in screenshots.\n<br />\n<br />It's just necessary to use character creation mod like Racemenu or Enhanced Character Edit to change color as you wish.\n<br />\n<br />My mods is free to use. I just ask do not publish my work on another site.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Recommendations :[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />If you want same quality of hairline in screenshots, it's recommanded to use HighResTexturesPack or you could use my texture to replace warpaints, tattoos or \n<br />\n<br />makeup addons mods for your personal use of course. In fact the high quality in warpaint, makeup or tattoos mods it's just works ! But not with vanilla game \n<br />\n<br />witheout HighResTexturesPack. Anyway you could use hairline texture with medium texture quality but the first hairline \"short hair\" will be ugly and the other \n<br />\n<br />less hairy detail.\n<br />\n<br />P.S.: Sorry for my English. Risk of French synthaxe.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Compatibility :\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/u]Indeed my mods is compatible with all hair mods, KS Hairdos, Apachii Sky Hair, Ninirim Hair style, TD18 Lore-Friendly Hair, Ponytails... etc... etc...\n<br />\n<br />Maybe if people can say me where to find Horizon Zero Dawn Aloy Hair for Skyrim, I would be really grateful.
