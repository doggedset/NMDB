  "modName": "Snowy section of Dawnstar Sanctuary",
  "summary": "a simple mod that allows you to reenter the snowy section of the Dawnstar Sanctuary after purchasing a secret exit/entrance from Mallory",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod takes away one of the walls from the Dawnstar Sanctuary, allowing you to reenter the snowy section of the sanctuary from The Cure for Madness. There is also a door near the end of the snowy section that will teleport you back to the main area of the sanctuary (where Nazir usually sits). This is my first mod, so there are a few glitches here and there. I\\'ll try and fix them as soon as possible",
