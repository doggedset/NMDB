  "modName": "Glowing Flamberge Sword of Saint Ruth (final)",
  "summary": "Modifies the Billyro Flamberge into a flaming sword, with a hot glow. <br />Includes ax and sword versions. No scabbards.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A lot of people liked Billyros' new Flamberge. If you wield with the default axe animations (and other animations, more on that later) you can wield it up at the Ricasso. it makes it feel like the blows from this beast are very weighty, which some people like. Inculded also is the glow for the sword version.\n<br />\n<br />This version adds flame detail, unique on both sides of the blade, as well as a red hot glow.\n<br />\n<br />The next step for me I think is to finally build my own sword.  Look out for that. In the meantime I would like to add some charred parts to the overall texture.\n<br />\n<br />You will still need Billyros' original mod\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/91168\n<br />\n<br />Now then I would like to open up and say that I know a way to make a better combat system for Skyrim. Simply by cherry picking certain animations from various mods, I have effectively made a \"light\" and \"heavy\" combat style. The light style is visually more in line with swords/katanas and light polearms such as bamboo staff. The ax/hammer side is visually tuned for spears halberds and great weapons, but can easily perform with greatswords.  \n<br />\n<br />If anyone would like to know the combinations I am referring to,  please await my very first tutorial video. From a long time practitioner in bladed combat, I will show you how to fight elves in a fantasy game. \n<br />\n<br />Very special thanks to Billyro. Excellent mods man...\n<br />Also a thank you to Xerperious for helping me through my first Glow mod. After learning the 1st time, its as easy as pie.",
