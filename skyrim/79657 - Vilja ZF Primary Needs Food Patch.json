  "summary": "Allows food items from the hit mod Vilja to work with ZF Primary Needs",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod lets food items from Vilja work with ZF Primary Needs.  This is my first mod and I apologize if it subpar :P\r<br />\r<br />I copied some food items effects From ZF and put them into 4 food items from Vilja.  Since I am such a noob at modding, I was very limited in what I can do.  Let me explain.  When I copied them they will have the same effects as the items I copied them from but as a side effect, they will have the same animations as the items I copied them from...eh it works lol.  For example: when you eat a strawberry, the &#34;eating an apple&#34; animation will play.\r<br />\r<br />The left are the Vilja added foods, the right are the foods I copied from. \r<br />Strawberry-Apple\r<br />Strawberry Pie-Apple Pie\r<br />Strawberry Cake-Spiced Cake\r<br />Chocolate Cake-Spiced Cake\r<br />\r<br />Please feel free to ask any questions although I can&#39;t guarantee that I can answer them :P",
