The door to the room is placed outside white run, it has an automatic fast travel symbol meaning you do not have to discover it first. The door then teleports you to a hub of worlds (UNFINISHED requires some refurbishment). All of the doors in the hub work as I have checked. The worlds respawn after 10 days allowing fresh loot to spawn this however will delete anything you drop and forget to collect. I will soon be making a mod for a player home in sovengarde. This mod is both non lore friendly and lore friendly in the fact that the room allows you to travel back and forth from places you aren&#39;t meant to which could be classed as cheating however these worlds are from quests ect. you can decide? This mod is just for fun&#33;",
