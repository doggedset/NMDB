  "descriptionHtml": "I never felt Shadowmere was quite special enough, so i decided to magicka-fy him up a bit with water walking capabilities. Nothing too special, just something i threw together in an afternoon, thought others might enjoy it also. \r\n\r\nGiven Shadowmere the vanilla water-walking ability from the flame atronach, so now you run across lakes and seas with your improved steed! I also took the liberty of increasing shadowmere\\'s speed ever so slightly and ticked the invulnerablity box so no more dead steed after jumping off a waterfall... \r\n\r\nSame file can also be found the steam workshop under \\\"Shadowmere Tweaks\\\" for those who prefer to use that method.\r\n\r\nEnjoy :) \r\n\r\nP.S. Due to the way the water-walking ability works it is also capable to swim with Shadowmere. It depends on the angle of the camera, so if you wish to walk on the water - angle the camera so you are looking up, if you want Shadowmere to swim angle it so you are looking down. It\\'s just how the vanilla ability works.",
