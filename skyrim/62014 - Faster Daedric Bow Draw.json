  "descriptionHtml": "I thought that the draw speed for a Daedric bows was horrifically slow compared to bound bows. This is an incredibly simple mod that increases the draw speed of Daedric bows from 0.5 to 1 so that players who&#39;ve leveled smithing/enchanting don&#39;t have to feel like their efforts were wasted. \r<br />\r<br />Should be compatible with all other mods except those that modify draw speeds or the functionality of the Daedric bow. ",
