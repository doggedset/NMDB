  "summary": "A visual improvement of the housecarl Lydia. Improves her facial features, sets her proper feminine stance, and fixes her height.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I wasn&#39;t really happy with any of the Lydia mods currently available. Most make her way over the top or too lore unfriendly. So I decided to fix her myself using the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4554/?]NPC Editor[/url].\r<br />\r<br />-Fixes her stance so she walks, runs, and stands feminine. Removes her manly stance.\r<br />-She is approximately 5% shorter (1.01 scale) so that her shoulders are a couple inches lower than a Nord male. Default Lydia as well as those found in most mods leave her as being too burly and large.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Required Mods[/b]\r<br />*In order for this mod to function properly without Skyrim crashing, Apachii Hair is [b]required[/b]. In order for her to look like my screenshots you will need Dimonzed UNP and Coverwomen.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?]Apachii Hair[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?]Dimonzed UNP[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3563/?]Coverwomen 3 with UNP support[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Load Order and Incompatibilities[/b]\r<br />Make sure you have HousecarlWhiterun.esp installed by this mod last after any other mod that changes the way Followers and world NPCs appear. That includes:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23755/?]Inhabitants of Skyrim[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36286/?]Feminine Females[/url]\r<br />...any mod that modifies Lydia in any way including scale changes.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installing into a Saved Game[/b]\r<br />You [I]may[/I] need to start a new game to see the changes or be at a point in the game before you met her. Otherwise you can try this solution:\r<br />-Dismiss Lydia if she was already a follower. She should return to Dragonsreach at Whiterun.\r<br />-Return to Dragonsreach and walk up to her. Use the tilde ~ to bring down the console. Select Lydia.\r<br />-Type Disable and press enter and then type Enable and press enter. The first command will despawn her from the world, the second should reset her back into the world and hopefully with the new height and feminine animation changes.",
