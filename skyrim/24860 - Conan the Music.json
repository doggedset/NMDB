  "descriptionHtml": "First off, this was my first mod.  For much of the last couple of days, I reminded myself of my grandmother trying to program her VCR.  So what did I do.\r\n\r\nI have replaced all of the combat music with the two Conan movie soundtracks composed by Basil Poledouris, an awesome guy who also wrote the music for movies like The Hunt for the Red October, Starship Troopers, and Robocop.  \r\n\r\nI added tracks from those two scores to every exploration mix as well, so they weren\\'t replaced, just added to.  \r\n\r\nI was inspired to make this mod by others before me like PROMETHEUS who made Conan\\'s outfits at\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4793\r\nCokla who made his iconic swords\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4217\r\nAnd Lobotomia2040 , who made his made a really good rendition of his body and face (looks to be from Destroyer)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5137\r\nHe has an easy to follow readme text showing how to get Conan\\'s face right.\r\n\r\nNothing is needed for this mod, but if you wanted the full Conan experience, I suggest the people I mentioned because they did and excellent job.\r\n\r\nAfter this, I plan on first making a Cimmerian custom race and I also plan to eventually do some world building.  If anyone has in suggestions, critiques, and such, feel free to put them out there.  ",
