  "summary": "Pick starts at the exact lock opening position, every time.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod alters the locksmith perk in the lockpicking tree. It makes it so when you have the perk, the lockpick starting position is at the exact opening position of the lock. So when you go to pick a lock, you do not have to move the pick, just turn the lock and it will open. You will never break a lockpick because the lock will always open on the first try (unless you move the lockpick from it\\'s starting position) regardless of your lockpicking skill level or what other lockpicking perks you have. I have also changed the perk so that it has no prerequisite perk or skill level requirement. You can learn it at base lockpicking skill level with none of the other lockpicking skills learned. All you need is the 1 perk point to learn the perk.\r\n\r\nAdd the .esp file to your data folder, enable it, and you\\'re good to go. Have fun stealin\\' stuff!",
