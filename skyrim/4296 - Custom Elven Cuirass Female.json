  "descriptionHtml": "A not too revealing and more golden custom version of the Gilded Elven Cuirass light armour for Female Human adventurers.\r\n\r\nThere is some slight clipping around the bum and breast, but none too distracting or noticeable during play. You may reduce texture clipping - skin showing through armour - by adjusting your character\\'s weight in the racemenu.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nCopy the Data folder to your installed Skyrim folder, confirm merging of folders.\r\n\r\nRemove: \r\nGoto  Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\elven\\\\f\\\\ and delete or rename Cuirass.dds.\r\nGoto  Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\armor\\\\elven\\\\f\\\\ and delete or rename Cuirass_0.nif and Cuirass_1.nif\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy using my armour and will endorse if you like it. Please feel free to upload screenshots if you want to, and helpful advice from fellow modders is always welcome. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks Bethesda for the original textures, maps and meshes.\r\nThanks to Nexus admins and members for being here and sharing.\r\n",
