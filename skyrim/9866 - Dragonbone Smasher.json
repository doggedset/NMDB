  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds the Dragonbone Smasher from Demon Souls to Skyrim. This is as much as I could get done considering how broken most of the tools feel this time around compared to previous Bethesda games. \r\n\r\nRelease Version: 0.90\r\nCurrent Version: 0.95\r\n\r\nFixes in Version: 0.95\r\n-Fixed texture path error which seemed to affect some users. Should errors persist let me know.\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Yoshh for helping get the mod this far.\r\n\r\nCurrent Issues: \r\nIssue 1: The weapon lacks blood decals do to issues i was having with the mesh, I couldnt get it to function properly. If there is anyone out there that can lend assistance on getting blood to apply to the weapon during combat feel free to PM me.\r\nIssue 2: The weapon doesnt have its own mesh in the Inventory, not sure how to solve that again anyone has a fix PM me.\r\n\r\nHow To Obtain: \r\nThe weapon currently MUST be crafted, and requires 30 Iron Ingots and 5 Dragon Bones. Its a hefty two handed weapon so the materials reflect that.\r\n\r\nWeapon Stats:\r\nDragonbone Smasher vs Deadric Greatsword\r\nAtk Speed:____ 0.5500 vs 0.7000\r\nBase Atk :_________50 vs 24\r\nWeapon Reach:___1.5 vs 1.3\r\n\r\nAsk Permission before using these files in your own mods, please and thankyou\r\n\r\n- Crazyeyesreaper\r\n",
