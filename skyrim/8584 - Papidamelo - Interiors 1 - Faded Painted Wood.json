  "summary": "Adds faded paint effect to wood and furniture in Player House Hjerim in Windhelm",
  "descriptionHtml": "Just a retexture for those that want something a bit different - tired of the old wood in Windhelm ? This brightens things up a bit with a faded paint effect in mellow colours for floors, furniture, ceilings, etc. May also affect some furniture in other locations and best viewed with a soft interior lighting enhancement. In the screenshots I have used the Celtic and Braided rugs by Decembria - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7274 - but have faded them a little also to fit in.\r\n\r\nJust install into your textues folder in Data (back up your old files first !).",
