That means if you drop one of the items it will look like a book and it will look like a book in your inventory. Why? Because it is funny.\r<br />\r<br />Pieces include:\r<br />\r<br />Top (Main piece, wear as a base)\r<br />Thong\r<br />Shorts \r<br />Jacket\r<br />Boots\r<br />Leggings\r<br />Belt\r<br />\r<br />Some of these pieces are compatible with these other armor mods I recently made:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60857/?]Edhildils Helgenrogue Armor[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60162/?]Edhildils Mermer Armor[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61054/?]Edhildils Mrs Claus[/url]\r<br />\r<br />mods in screenshots include:\r<br />\r<br />Hair: Apachii SkyHair female pack\r<br />Skin: Sporty Sexy Sweat, SG Textures Renewal CBBE\r<br />Eyes: The Eyes of Beauty\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]OyIf7_ZO0sY[/youtube]\r<br />[img]http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/3664/updatesb.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />If someone wants to convert this to Bodyslide 2 or another body type go for it. It would be nice to make it mod dependant though so please keep that in mind.
