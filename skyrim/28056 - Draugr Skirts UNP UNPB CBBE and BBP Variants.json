If I\\'ve missed yet another one PLEASE let me know so I can get that fixed too.  I moved the esp only file in the optional files now just in case I missed one\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n------------\r\nWARNING: Contains see through outfits so adults only. I formed the rags that the female Draugrs have on in the dungeons to fit UNP, UNPB, CBBE & each of the BBP variants for people that use BBP. I also added a few different textures to it as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetail:\r\n-------\r\n\r\nVERY IMPORTANT SO PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE DOWNLOADING:\r\n\r\nIf you choose to use the BBP versions of either UNP, UNPB or CBBE you will need the proper skeleton and animations for these to work. If you DON\\'T have them it MAY CAUSE CRASHING. You can grab the original BBP skeleton and animations from Cherryhotaling\\'s mod CHSBHC-BBP-Nude and Jiggly Mod (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4888). If you want to view the jiggle from the front view of your character as you walk you will need an additional animation replacer such as Victoria\\'s High Heel Walk Animation by xp32 (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13272). I personally use the Less Exaggerated version. Another skeleton that is compatible is xp32\\'s Maximum Skeleton-XPMS (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800/). Read his description page for more info because you will need FNIS more than likely.\r\n\r\nAlso, I got this a few times with the original Litheria version \\\"that\\'s not a skirt it\\'s a dress\\\". Technically the vanilla version are rags but I didn\\'t want to name it rags because the other textures don\\'t remind me of rags and this \\\"dress\\\" is barely there so I called it a skirt. \r\n\r\nOk now on to what this is. For one this is my second Skyrim mod. It is somewhat of an expansion on my first mod for Humannature66 & GinnyFizz\\'s the Litheria Race, Body & Armor mod. That mod can be found here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26614. That mod is just the outfit with no body included so you will need HN66\\'s mod found here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25461 in order for it to work. Needless to say I need to find a \\\"Texturing for Dummies\\\" book soon so please go easy on my  lack of talent. If you find that you like it, awesome and thank you. If you think it sucks, you\\'re not alone but don\\'t rub my face in it and just look for something you do like please.\r\n\r\nWhat I did was I took the dirty, silky-ish skirt/rags that the female Draugrs wear in their dungeons and formed it to the UNP, UNPB & CBBE bodies along with each one\\'s BBP Variant. The CBBE version is a custom bodyslide preset of the new 3.2 version that I made to be very similar to a preset that Ginnyfizz sent me. Another note on the CBBE version is that the outfits themselves ARE NOT bodyslide compatible meaning if you have you\\'re own personal preset it will not be the same size. I may look into this in the future but for right now it is what it is. If someone that knows how to do this feel free to do so and teach me in the process lol. All I ask is if you do make it compatible just let me know so I can check it out and include myself and the other great modders in my credits list. There is the original texture, 3 leather textures, 4 lace textures and a chainmail texture right now. With better knowledge of what I\\'m doing I would like to do more at a later time but right now this is what I\\'ve got. So you start a new game and decide you don\\'t want those prison outfits much longer and want something that\\'s barely there. It\\'s not much but when you enter Helgen Keep after you decide which faction to go with there will be a barrel in the room that both sides first encounter each other. If you side with the Stormcloaks I believe it is the very first room you enter.  If you side with the Imperials it should be the 2nd. In that barrel you can slip into something a bit more comfortable by grabbing an original texture Draugr skirt. The other textures are in 2 different dungeon areas. Probably your first (chainmail & leathers) will be deep in Bleak Falls Barrow when you retrieve the Dragonstone. It\\'s in a chest in the same area as where you learn your first Shout right against the Shout Wall to the right. The other (lace) is in Potema\\'s Sanctum a little before you enter the room full of her minions. You will enter a room that has a table on the left with a draugr body laying on it with some other things. When you enter that room immediately look to the right inside the doorway for the chest. Check the pictures for locations. Hopefully more to come later.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy and if you like it please endorse, leave a comment or submit a picture (I have it set so I have to verify just so I know when someone does decide to send one) or if you\\'re feeling really generous all 3 would be awesome ha ha. And PLEASE don\\'t forget to do the same for Dimon99\\'s UNP body, AjuntaPall316\\'s BBP version of UNP, Calyps for the UNPB body, Caliente for the CBBE body and bodyslide and Cherry for the basis for BBP with the skeleton and animations. They are the one\\'s that really deserve it.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nTI\r\n\r\nFollowers used in photos:\r\n\r\nMy own tweaked version of Aela the Huntress\r\n\r\nFalmerBane\\'s version of Camilla Valerius\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14368\r\n\r\nNatilde\\'s standalone CBBE companion Juliette\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25608\r\n\r\ngilgoon\\'s standalone CBBE companion Ria\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17354\r\n\r\n\r\n---Installation:---\r\n-------------------\r\nManual Installation:\r\n--------------------\r\nIMPORTANT PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING\r\nIn order for the outfits to work as intended, you MUST:\r\n\r\n(THIS STEP IS ONLY NECESSARY IF YOU ARE USING A BBP VARIANT. IF NOT THEN SKIP TO THE NEXT STEP)\r\n\r\nFIRST download and install Cherry\\'s skeleton & animations.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4888\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nxp32\\'s Maximum skeleton along with his requirement (FNIS) (Note you will still need Cherry\\'s animations too.)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800/\r\n\r\n(MAIN STEP)\r\n\r\nSECOND download and install the body replacer of your choice if you haven\\'t already and make sure you have the correct body textures for that body.\r\n\r\nDimon99\\'s UNP Body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709\r\n\r\nAjuntaPall316\\'s BBP version of Dimon\\'s UNP body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10470\r\n\r\nCalyps\\' UNPB body (MY PERSONAL FAVORITE)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14899\r\n\r\nCaliente\\'s CBBE body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r\n\r\nTHIRD extract the file you just downloaded from here to anywhere you want to on your computer.\r\n\r\nFOURTH copy the data folder in the file you just downloaded to your Skyrim game directory which should be C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim.\r\n\r\nFOURTH make sure the DraugrSkirt.esp is ticked in either your mod manager or your launcher and enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n---Uninstallation:---\r\n---------------------\r\nManual Uninstallation:\r\n----------------------\r\nUntick the .esp file in the mod manager or launcher and delete it and the files that came with this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown issues and bugs:\r\n----------------------\r\nMaybe a little clipping. Especially with the UNPB BBP version around the breasts at idle. I will try to fix this eventually but I\\'ve been working on this for along time and just want to get it out. Also, on the right hip you will notice some triangles. That is how the original Beth mesh was and my noobness has no idea to fix it. Another thing I have no idea how to fix is you\\'ll notice that when inside somewhere some of the outfits (lighter ones especially) will look darker when the light hits it. I have no idea if this is a nif setting I have to change or if it\\'s just Skyrim\\'s lighting. Any advice would be great on that matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatabilities:\r\n------------------\r\nNone that I know of just make sure you have the right body textures installed for the body you are using.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact:\r\n--------\r\nFeel free to send me a message here at the Nexus if you run into any issues or just to say Hey.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT - Requirements:\r\n-------------------------\r\nSkyrim of course\r\n\r\nA body replacer from one of the above links\r\n\r\n(Only necessary if you are using BBP)\r\nCherryHotaling\\'s BBP skeleton and animations or your game will crash\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n--------\r\nDimon99 for the UNP body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709\r\n\r\nAjuntaPall316 for the BBP version of the UNP body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10470\r\n\r\nCalyps for the UNPB & BBP body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14899\r\n\r\nCaliente for the CBBE body and Bodyslide\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r\n\r\nCherryHotaling for bringing the bounce to Skyrim in the first place\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4888\r\n\r\nxp32 for the XPMS Maximum Skeleton\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800\r\n\r\nand for the Victoria\\'s High Heeled Walk animations\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13272\r\n\r\nHumannature66 for his great input and thoughts on the Litheria Draugr Skirts.
