  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a small Cabin to Skyrim which I based around the Idea of a lone ranger type guarding something from the rest of the world. The player house can be seen on the map and fast traveled to right away and is found build into cliffs just above a waterfall east of the Throat of the World and just North of Ivarstead. \r\n\r\nThe Cabin has the following:\r\n\r\nA Bed\r\nA Forge\r\nA Smelter\r\nA Tanning Rack\r\nA Workbench\r\nA Grindstone\r\nAn Alchemy Table\r\nAn Enchanting Table\r\nMannequins\r\nWeapon Plaques\r\nWeapon Racks\r\n\r\nChanges in version two:\r\n\r\n Rooms have been made smaller\r\n Lighting has been made darker (maybe to dark but I like it let me know what you guys think)\r\n Containers have been put in the office for Potions, Alchemy and Enchanting Supplies.\r\n Three mannequins have been removed I felt six was too many.\r\n And a few small things here and there\r\n\r\nI do plan to add to the house but only as far as adding a bit of story to it maybe a quest.",
