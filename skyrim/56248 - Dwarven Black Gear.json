  "summary": "Adds more equipment similar to the Dwarven Black Crossbow of Fate.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I thought Kagrumez felt a bit unfinished so I added a bit more gear to the last room. Of course ideally a 5th stage should be added to the gauntlet, as well as a new room. Right now I don&#39;t know how to script that. So you&#39;ll find it in a chest in the last room of [b]Kagrumez[/b], in [b]Solstheim[/b].\r<br />\r<br />Keep in mind this is the same tier as the Dwarven Black Bow of Fate. So pretty much end game gear by vanilla standards.\r<br />\r<br />Stuff added:\r<br />Dwarven Black Crossbow of Fate\r<br />Dwarven Black Cuirass of Fate*\r<br />Dwarven Black Robes of Fate\r<br />Dwarven Black Hood of Fate\r<br />\r<br />*If you need a helmet to go with the cuirass, use the [b]Visage of Mzund[/b]. If you don&#39;t have it, you can get it from [b]Fahlbtharz[/b], in [b]Solstheim[/b]. Or if you don&#39;t want to do that, open the console, type [i]help visage[/i], find a code that looks like xx038ADD, and type player.additem xx038ADD 1. Of course, replace the xx with whatever you get.\r<br />\r<br />Enchantments:\r<br />Crossbow: Same as the Dwarven Black Bow of Fate (50% chance to absorb Health, Magicka or Stamina)\r<br />Cuirass: Increased health regen (5x) and Shock cloak\r<br />Robes: Increased health regen (2.5x) and mana regen (2.5x) and Shock Cloak\r<br />Hood: Reduced shout cooldowns.",
