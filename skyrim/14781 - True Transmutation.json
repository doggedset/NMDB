  "summary": "A total rebalancing and reimagining of the transmutation spell found in game.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r\nThis mod is basically a rebalancing and reimagining of the transmutation spell found in game, changing the original spell and adding several new ones. I found the original spell too gimmicky and too much like a cheat, while at the same time I wanted a different way to acquire the more uncommon materials while using up materials that became obsolete after awhile. (You have no idea how much iron and silver I had rotting away in Breezehome... Then again if you\\'ve been playing for a while you probably know exactly what I mean)\r\n\r\nNew Spells are as follows:\r\nTransmute Corundum Ore (replaces original spell); Novice Alteration Spell; Converts four Iron Ore into one Corundum Ore\r\nTransmute Silver Ore; Apprentice Alteration Spell; Converts one Corundum Ore into one Silver Ore\r\nTransmute Orichalcum Ore; Apprentice Alteration Spell; Converts one Corundum Ore into one Orichalcum Ore\r\nTransmute Gold Ore; Adept Alteration Spell; Converts two Silver Ore into one Gold Ore\r\nTransmute Moonstone Ore; Adept Alteration Spell; Converts one Orichalcum Ore into one Moonstone Ore\r\nTransmute Malachite Ore; Adept Alteration Spell; Converts one Orichalcum Ore into one Malachite Ore\r\nTransmute Gemstone; Adept Alteration Spell; Converts one Corundum Ore into a random gemstone. (likeliness of specific gems is dependent upon rarity: Garnets most common, diamonds least common)\r\nTransmute Ebony Ore; Expert Alteration Spell; Converts two Gold Ore into one Ebony Ore\r\n\r\n\r\nAll books have been added to the appropriate leveled lists and are purchasable from Tolfdir at the College of Winterhold, as long as their Alteration skill requirements are met.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the future I intend to add spells for transmuting Moonstone and Malachite ores as well as converting Dragon Bones to Dragon Scales (as well as Dragon Scales back to Dragon Bones), multiple regular gems into their flawless varieties, and a spell to create Soul Gems (Although I\\'m not certain what they\\'ll be made from yet, perhaps a half-dozen petty gems from one malachite or some such)\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nDrag Scripts folder and TrueTransmutation.esp into your DATA folder.\r\nThere should be no overwriting unless updating from an older version.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibilities: Due to replacing the original Transmute Mineral spell, this mod will be incompatible with any other that changes that spell. The original Transmute Mineral script is untouched but the spell itself has been reassigned to my modified version.\r\nAs far as I know it should be compatible with all other mods, as that original spell is the only thing that was overwritten.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATES\r\n1.0.2\r\nAdded two new spells: Transmute Moonstone Ore and Transmute Malachite Ore\r\nUpdated leveled lists and updated magicka costs and vendor costs. \r\nReduced number of scripts used.\r\n\r\n1.0.0\r\nInitial upload\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\nBethesda for a great game!\r\nSkyrim Nexus for hosting the best collection of mods for a great game! :)\r\n\r\nAny constructive feedback is welcome.\r\nEnjoy!",
