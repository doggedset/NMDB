  "modName": "Keys Revalued",
  "summary": "A small mod that adds value and weight to every key in Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "As a preface to the rest of the description, THIS MOD IS DEAD. I was able to add weight to the keys, and if that suits your immersion requirements, awesome. However, after much effort, I have concluded that there is no way to make keys sellable to ANY sort of vendor. I have not tried scripting these transactions, and honestly don&#39;t have the time or the effort to. If anyone else wishes to pick up where I left off, you have my blessing (just credit me for the work you build upon). \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Anyways:\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I was tired of having an inventory full of worthless, weightless keys. It didn&#39;t make sense to me that keys that could allow you access to jails/evidence chests/shops would be considered worthless, and their weighing nothing really disrupted immersion for me. This mod changes the weight of each key to 0.1 and adds gold value. \r<br />\r<br />Unzip this into your Skyrim Data directory, make sure it&#39;s active and start playing&#33; No DLC is required.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Update 2.5\r<br />[/b][/u]\r<br />Thanks to TalEmper for feedback in reporting the unsellable key issue. I&#39;ve been trying to add keys to the vendor&#39;s items list, but it appears that the game doesn&#39;t treat keys the same way as other item types...no matter what I try keys seem to be unrecognized as a vendor item. Been searching the forums but my GoogleFu hasn&#39;t turned up any leads. I&#39;m not giving up yet, gonna keep slogging through to try to make keys buyable/sellable without resorting to using scripts. \r<br />\r<br />For now, a new merchant, Mekral, has been added to the Ragged Flagon. He is located on the platform over the cistern in the Flagon, and as of now functions as a TG fence who sells lockpicks and buys all items, similar to Tonilia. Obviously, he&#39;ll only do business with you once you&#39;re a member of the Guild. \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Update 2.0\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve changed the values of every key in vanilla Skyrim. All keys now weigh 0.1 excepting Player Home keys, which remain weightless/valueless. Wouldn&#39;t want to hawk your own housekey, would you? As a general rule, the changes follow these values:\r<br />\r<br />Jails/Castles/Keep keys: 1000\r<br />House/Inn/Stable Keys: 50\r<br />Apothecary Shop Keys: 250\r<br />Blacksmith/General Goods Shop Keys: 200\r<br />Jewelry Shop Keys: 500\r<br />Ruin/Mine Keys: 100\r<br />\r<br />Unique Instances:\r<br />\r<br />Goldenglow Safe Key: 150\r<br />Honningbrew Brewhouse Key: 150\r<br />Sabjorn&#39;s Dresser Key: 100\r<br />East Empire Warehouse Key:500\r<br />East Empire Office Key: 150\r<br />Archmage&#39;s Key: 500\r<br />Mercer&#39;s House Key: 150\r<br />Calixto&#39;s Key: 150\r<br />Clan Shatter-Shield Office Key: 150\r<br />Bard&#39;s College Key: 250\r<br />Katariah Master Key: 1000\r<br />Pinewatch Treasury Key: 150\r<br />Sibbi&#39;s Chest/Stash Key: 100\r<br />Ingun&#39;s Supply Chest Key: 100\r<br />Markarth Hall of the Dead Key: 150\r<br />Kerah&#39;s Key: 100\r<br />Calcelmo&#39;s Laboratory Key: 500\r<br />Dwemer Museum Key: 250\r<br />Temple of Dibella Key: 100\r<br />Markarth Treasury House Key: 250\r<br />Blackbriar Manor Key: 100\r<br />Maven&#39;s Personal Key: 250\r<br />Madanach&#39;s Key: 1000\r<br />\r<br />A few chest/cage keys in various dungeons I&#39;ve set to lower values, as I don&#39;t consider them that important/useful from an economical standpoint. Who&#39;d pay 100 gold for a chest key in a moldering, forgotten dungeon? Anyways, this will allow clever thieves to make some decent money with the &#39;Wax Key&#39; Lockpicking perk.\r<br />\r<br />Post and let me know what you think. I&#39;m happy to get feedback about the gold and weight values, as well as ideas for expanding this mod as I learn more about how the Creation Kit works&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Cheers\r<br />\r<br />Seadrick.",
