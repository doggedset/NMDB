  "summary": "This mod adds a small cave that acts like a Necromancer lair. It has everything needed for a player home.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod simply adds a cave that is a necromancer lair. It becomes a player house after you find the key to the house. The key is located within a strongbox in Rannveig&#39;s Fast ( on the table next to Sild). The lair has everything a player home needs - storage chest (which won&#39;t respawn), arcane enchanter, alchemy station, cooking spit and some additions like cages and altars. There are also two skill books laying around the lair. When you open the strongbox you will discover a note and a key. The key is for the lair and the note describes where to find the lair and also reveals a small backstory.\r<br />\r<br />Please tell me if there are any bugs and I will try to fix them. Also if you want me to add something else to the lair just ask and I will try to do it.\r<br />",
