  "summary": "Adds a healing shout to Skyrim inside Dragonreach",
  "descriptionHtml": "A simple mod that allows player to recover oneself and ally. It can be found in Dragonreach. First word recovers 100 health/magicka/stamina. Second word recovers 200 heatlh/magicka/stamina. Third word recovers 99999 health/magicka/stamina. Whenever you use a cheating cooldown or not I don&#39;t care, just have fun with this. The only reason I add this is because sometimes in a specific circumstance you need something quick and you forgot to buy a potion so this is an ability for you to be added to on your side protection. Think of it as an emergency plan. Again, thank you Bifteki for a small lecture on Papyrus Script...also those who gave me an advice on this mod to keep it balanced. The first shout is 1 minute, second shout is 2 minutes then third shout is 3 minutes. The video is just for display only, it shows you how the shout works. You will need a Dragon&#39;s Soul to be able to use it. You can always give me an idea of what to work on next owo. (Just don&#39;t say models or races ;; I can&#39;t work on those kind of stuff I don&#39;t use Blender/3DSMax)",

      "changelogHtml": " In 0.1b it was a terrible part where you can heal everyone then 0.2b you can only heal yourself and sometimes the game crash at random moment from a third shout due to maximum power latency so I fixed it to 99999 instead of #INF. In this version you can finally heal yourself and your allies instead of yourself only or ally only. AoE&#39;s set to 100 so you can heal slightly far away when needed, especially when your ally doesn&#39;t have the &#34;essential&#34; in a few quest circumstance like Deerkethus you don&#39;t want them to die just because they got in the way, etc. Enjoy the update&#33; <br/> \n",
