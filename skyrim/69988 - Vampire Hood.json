  "descriptionHtml": "I have made available head armor to complete the Vampire Armor set from Dawnguard.  At first just a copy of Serana&#39;s Hood, fit to be used by the player or another NPC if you choose to give it to them, I decided to also make a Circlet for those that may wish to not conceal their faces while retaining the benefits of defense and a full matching set.\r<br />\r<br />They both have a Base Armor of 11 and are found on top of a shelf case in Valerica&#39;s Study, which means it also requires the Dawnguard DLC.\r<br />\r<br />Aware that similar such Mods exist, I decided I&#39;d make my own for personal use not only to make sure it was how it fit in with my own ideas but for practice towards future Mods as well.  I hope you enjoy and it can be of some use.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Update[/b]\r<br />[u]Version 1.1[/u]: Fixed an error and set the items with Vampire Material (Boots, Gloves, the varied Body, as well as the Hood/Circlet) to gain double improvement from Advanced Armors.",
