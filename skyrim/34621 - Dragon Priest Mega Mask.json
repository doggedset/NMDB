His mask is essentially the others&#39; masks combined. It has all the effects of all the others. It&#39;s not easy to get, though. It&#39;s definitely overpowered and no amount of difficulty in obtaining it will negate that. But it&#39;s a fun idea I had and wanted to see done, so I did it.\r<br />\r<br />To see how to get there and how to get the mask, see the ReadMe.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3][b]3: Installation:\r<br />[/b][/size][/color]Plug&#39;n&#39;play\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3][b]4: Uninstallation:\r<br />[/b][/size][/color]No updating scripts, so uninstallation should be safe (as safe as any other, at least). Just don&#39;t uninstall while you&#39;re in Apocrypha or the arena.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3][b]5: Compatibility:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Should be compatible with just about anything as long as they don&#39;t completely overhaul Apocrypha or Miraak. With that said, one thing it doesn&#39;t appear to be compatible with is Kace Auto Loot. Everything will work fine, but his script is faster and will give you copies of Zeldranos (mask). Other than that, there aren&#39;t any compatibility issues that I know of.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#00ff00][size=3]6: Bugs:[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />The magic effect on the mask doesn&#39;t display correctly. It&#39;s due to the mask having so many effects and I don&#39;t think it can be fixed. If you want to see what it does, look at the other masks. It does no more or less than combining all of the others. So this isn&#39;t so much a bug as a limitation of the game.\r<br />\r<br />That said, currently, I don&#39;t know of any bugs. There were a couple, but I either fixed them, they were compatibility issues (KAL, like I mentioned), or were from testing. Let me know if you find any.",
