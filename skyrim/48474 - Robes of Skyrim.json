  "summary": "Have you ever wanted armor stats on the robes of Skyrim? I always hated starting a new mage character because even low level bandits can kick your butt when you wear just robes.Well, now all that can change with Robes of Skyrim&#33; A complete overhaul of the robes of Skyrim. Plus Dragonborn and Overpowered Options&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\r<br />[size=7][B][U]Robes of Skyrim[/U][/B][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][u][B]Description[/B][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Before anyone complains, yes I am fully aware that the robes in Skyrim are mostly all simply made from thin, clothy material that realistically does not provide much protection at all. So, why bother bring that to my attention when I already am fully aware? Mmkay, thanks.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]With this mod installed, Mage Armor spells and perks will not play friendly. In order for the robes to have a rating they had to be marked as Light Armor. And because of this change, the spells and mage armor perks will have no affect.\r<br />This mod is not for those players who depend on those spells and perks and prefer it that way. But as for me, I hated switching between spells and using needed magicka and perks in order to increase my protection during combat. With this mod you will receive constant protection. It is obviously your choice.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]What this mod is...[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mods adds stats and a higher value to all robes in Skyrim. Mage Robes, Monk Robes, Greybeard Robes, even Nocturnal&#39;s Robes. Not to mention all unplayable robes have been made wearable as well.\r<br />\r<br />It also adds stats to college boots, mage boots, ect&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[B][U]Normal Version[/B][/U]\r<br />\r<br />The normal version provides lowish armor ratings to the robes.\r<br />\r<br />From 18-45 for the armor stats. Rarer type robes provide more protection. (Thalmor, Archmage, Nocturnal, ect)\r<br />\r<br />[B][U]Overpowered Version[/B][/U]\r<br />\r<br />This version has overpowered versions of the robes. \r<br />\r<br />From 57-87 armor stats. The rarer robes rated higher like the normal version.\r<br />\r<br />[U]Both versions have Archmage Robes with better enchantments&#33;[/U]\r<br />\r<br />[U][B]Dragonborn Add-On[/B][/U]\r<br />\r<br />With the Dragonborn Add-On, you can have all the robes that came with that expansion with stats. Comes in both Overpowered and Normal Versions.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[U][B]Installation[/B][/U]\r<br />\r<br />Download your preferred way.\r<br />\r<br />Choose either the Normal or the Overpowered version. Not both. It is possible to mix them up though by downloading the Normal version of the Robes and the DB addon Overpowered version and vice versa&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[U][B]Questions and Answers[/B][/U]\r<br />\r<br />[I]This is stupid&#33; Clothing can&#39;t have ratings&#33; Blah, blah&#33;[/I]\r<br />Skip this mod. Move on.\r<br />\r<br />[I]All the stats are too high. can you lower them?[/I]\r<br />If enough people ask for a lower stat level version, I could possibly make one.\r<br />\r<br />[I]Will you? Can you?[/I]\r<br />Same as above. If I get above requests for something specific, I may possibly make more versions. Keep in mind though that changing the stats and values of every robe in game takes some time&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[B]Future Plans[/B]\r<br />\r<br />Dawnguard Add-On (Currently do not have)\r<br />Add another optional download for &#34;Special&#34; robes to have better enchantments\r<br />\r<br />[B]If you encounter any problems, let me know.[/B]\r<br />[/center]",
