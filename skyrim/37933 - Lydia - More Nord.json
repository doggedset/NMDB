  "modName": "Lydia - More Nord",
  "summary": "This little \\\\\\\"mod\\\\\\\" of mine makes Lydia look more like Nord plus few more features to make her more Nordic. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "[u]Instalation:[/u]\r\n\r\nPut the .esp and .bsa in [u][i]\\\\\\\\Skyrim\\\\\\\\Data[/u][/i] folder and enable it in Launcher (Data Files - tick the .esp file) or in NMM. \r\n[i]- I would love to create NMM instalation file but my time is sparce lately :([/i]\r\n\r\n[u]About[/u]\r\n\r\nI never really liked Lydia\\\\\\'s vanilla appearance but after 30+ hours of playing with her I got quite used to her as my companion. I\\\\\\'ve tried other mods but they didn\\\\\\'t suit my requirements (I am quite a \\\\\\\"lore-nazi\\\\\\\"). I was delighted with Vilja in Skyrim BUT I quite missed Lydia and Vilja felt like stranger to me for the whole 10 hours I\\\\\\'ve spent with her. So I did this \\\\\\\"mod\\\\\\\".\r\n\r\nThis isn\\\\\\'t really a mod but a replacer. I used [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4554]Skyrim NPC Editor[/url] to change appearance of Lydia but after I did it I\\\\\\'ve looked into the editor what else it can do.\r\n\r\nNow what I found was pretty strange. [b]Lydia has in default Male fighting stance. I changed it to Female[/b] - now she looks less manly when fighting. Also I made [b]another version with Lydia\\\\\\'s leveling algorhytm set to two-handed weapons[/b]. I would love to change her to mage but I didn\\\\\\'t have time to test how it works. And it quite breaks her character for she is a warrior and a Nord.\r\n\r\nSo Lydia now looks more like a Nord. She can be forced to level up 2H weapons. I also [b]set her to be essential[/b] (I mean - do you really want her to die in the middle of some dungeon? If you do then open console and type [i]\\\\\\\"setessential 000A2C8E 0\\\\\\\"[/i]) AND [b]added 2 spells to her character sheet - Battle Cry (Nord Power) and Healing.[/b] Now, with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18436]ASIS[/url] she is able to use them. Without it she doesn\\\\\\'t. [b]Note that all NPCs are able to use potions and spells after installing ASIS![/b]\r\n\r\nYou are more than welcomed to edit this replacer. I didn\\\\\\'t use anything else than Skyrim NPC Editor and Vanilla Game to create this.\r\n",
