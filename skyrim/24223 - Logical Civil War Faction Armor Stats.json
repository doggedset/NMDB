  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever tried to use the armor of the Civil War factions - only to realizie it&#39;s crap? When i first got the Imperial Studded Armor as a reward from Balgruuf and compared it too my tattered Fur Armor I decided to create this simple modification. How can a faction rule Tamriel or even Skyrim while having equipment worse than simple bandits&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Note: Be aware, that few starting armors (such as Fur, Hide) get less usefull (That&#39;s the object in fact). I started a new game and didn&#39;t notice a big difference, even on Expert difficulty, so i don&#39;t see any balancing problems.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Changes:\r<br />\r<br />Stormcloak Light Armor:\r<br />\r<br />- Cuirass and helm have slightly better stats than Leather Armor (Looks like wadded chain armor), but have increased weight (6 -&gt; 8) \r<br />- Boots and gauntlets have stats equal to Leather\r<br />- Same stats for all hold guards\r<br />\r<br />Stormcloak Bear Armor:\r<br />\r<br />- Cuirass and helm stats equal to Leather\r<br />- Gauntlets and boots slightly better than Leather (7 -&gt; 8) due to their studded appearance\r<br />\r<br />Imperial Light Armor:\r<br />\r<br />- Cuirass and helm and boots equal to Leather\r<br />- Bracer slightly weaker\r<br />\r<br />Imperial Studded Cuirass:\r<br />\r<br />- Stats slightly better than Leather (Chain Armor) and weight increased\r<br />\r<br />Imperial Heavy Armor:\r<br />\r<br />- Stats equal to Steel Armor (It is steel in fact&#33;), but heavier\r<br />\r<br />NPC Changes:\r<br />\r<br />- Ulfric now has the perk, which allows him to use Shouts (I didn&#39;t get why he was not allowed to use them)",
