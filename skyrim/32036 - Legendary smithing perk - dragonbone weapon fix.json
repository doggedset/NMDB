  "descriptionHtml": "REQUIRES DAWNGUARD - Although there\\\\\\'d be no reason to use this mod if you don\\\\\\'t have Dawnguard...\r\n\r\nIn the legendary smithing perk mod here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1690 dragonbone weapons do not benefit from the dragon smithing perk when you play Dawnguard. Although you can fix this by disabling the mod, loading, tempering the weapon and enabling mod again, I believe this to be a far simpler solution.\r\n\r\nThis will change the description of dragon smithing to include weapons, and of course allow dragonbone weapons to benefit from the dragon smithing perk.\r\n\r\nThere should be no problems, just make sure to have this load AFTER legendary smithing perks. Shouldn\\\\\\'t conflict with other smithing mods unless they change dragon smithing in some way.\r\n\r\nIf there is a problem, please let me know.",
