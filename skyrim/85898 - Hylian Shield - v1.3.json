  "descriptionHtml": "[img]https://i.imgur.com/M4K8RVc.png[/img]\r<br />The Hylian Shield and Dark Shield meshes and textures have been made to look like the version from Breath of the Wild/Skyward Sword (they&#39;re the same design).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I also have plans to eventually make some other shields from Breath of the Wild once I have more free time, oh college...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/lG9iCB2.png[/img]\r<br />Version 1.3\r<br />   &bull; Optimized textures, 80.6% file size reduction.\r<br />   &bull; Improved Loftwing crest color.                  \r<br />\r<br />Version 1.2\r<br />   &bull; Added the large Heavy variant of the shield.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1\r<br />   &bull; The original version caused a crash (for me anyway, no idea if it was just my game or not actually) when the shield was equipped when either trying to mount a horse or dying (those are the two CTD situations that I know of anyway).  That has been fixed.\r<br />   &bull; Adjusted Clk variant of OnBack shields.",
