Others are nice enough, but I get sick of hearing the same lines from them over and over and over. Whiterun, in particular, seems to be full of annoying NPCs. I&#39;d often end up opening the console and just deleting them whenever I started a new game.\r<br />\r<br />Rather than doing that every time, I decided to track down the specific lines of dialogue from these particular NPCs and simply deleted them. So far, the following lines have been removed (Note: These are just the lines the NPC speaks automatically when you are near them. Other dialogue hasn&#39;t been touched):\r<br />\r<br />Whiterun:\r<br />Every line by Njada Stonearm\r<br />Every line by Tilma\r<br />Every line by Sigurd\r<br />Skjor: &#34;You still need to prove yourself, whelp.&#34;\r<br />Braith: &#34;What are you looking at?&#34;\r<br />Olfina Graymane: &#34;What&#39;s the matter? Can&#39;t stand the sight...&#34;\r<br />Lilith Maidenloom: &#34;Come to chat with an old woman?&#34; &#34;My friend Maven and I...&#34;\r<br />Birgritte Battleborn: &#34;There&#39;s a rift here in Skyrim...&#34;\r<br />Nelkir: &#34;Another wanderer, here to lick my father&#39;s boots...&#34; &#34;The only adults who talk to me...&#34;\r<br />Gerda: &#34;I might just be a servant among lords...&#34;\r<br />Fianna: &#34;Ain&#39;t nobody high and mighty in these halls...&#34;\r<br />Nazeem: &#34;Do you get to the cloud district very often?&#34;\r<br />Severio Pelagio: &#34;There&#39;s a chill in the air.&#34;\r<br />1.01\r<br />Eorlund Graymane: &#34;I ain&#39;t much for talking.&#34; &#34;Why you still staring at me?&#34;\r<br />Adrianne Avenicci: All lines, except &#34;Got some good pieces out here...&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Riften:\r<br />Hemming Black-Briar: &#34;Fancy yourself the adventuring type, eh?&#34;\r<br />Keerava: &#34;...otherwise, hit the road.&#34;\r<br />Indaryn: &#34;Yeah? What did you want?&#34;\r<br />Grelka: &#34;You going to buy something...&#34; &#34;Can&#39;t you bother me at my stand...&#34; &#34;You gonna stare all day...&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Markarth:\r<br />Ondolemar: &#34;The Dominion is here and we&#39;re watching you.&#34; &#34;The Thalmor know how to deal with Talos worshippers.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Winterhold:\r<br />Ranmir: &#34;Unless you&#39;re bringing me another round...&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Things I&#39;m not touching. Don&#39;t ask:\r<br />Heimskar&#39;s Talos spiel\r<br />&#34;...then I took an arrow in the knee.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ll probably be adding far more. Suggestions are welcome, but I may not add them.\r<br />\r<br />This is a personal mod that I made for my own use and decided to share. If you don&#39;t like what it does, stay out of the comments.",
