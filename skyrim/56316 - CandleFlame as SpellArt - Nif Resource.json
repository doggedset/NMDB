I added a Alpha nif for anyone who is intrested to download. Its meant to be used as an &#34;art object&#34; for a &#34;Hit Effect Art&#34; (constant Effect). The praticle systems can be found under the last NiNode (69) and there is a mover NiNode (70) (transform the 69 or 70 NiNodes to move the flame+glow around) witch is currently moved along the z axis. Its attacht to the targets MagicEffectsNode (where all normal spells will hit a target). You should leave the NiControllerManager node (4) and LagBone node (65) alone if u use it as a hit effect.\r<br />\r<br />Dont mind the Naming of all the nodes... they are messed up and ill fix them someday maybe.\r<br />\r<br />The scaling is identical to the CandleFlame01.nif mps but factored by 10 via the BSPSysScaleModifier. Use these modifiersfor scaling.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />the rest is up to you.\r<br />\r<br />Thx to Chesko for permission\r<br />--------------------------------------------------",
