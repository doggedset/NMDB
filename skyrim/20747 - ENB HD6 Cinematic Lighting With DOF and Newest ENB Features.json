  "modName": "ENB HD6 Cinematic Lighting With DOF and Newest ENB Features",
  "summary": "An updated version of the HD6 config for ENB .114. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This updated version has the beautiful color scheme and lighting of the original release with the extra features of the newest ENB. Requires ENB .113 or .114 from ENBDev.com. \r\n\r\nNote: The settings are designed for a fairly high level PC. If your performance suffers, turn off or turn down DoF and SSAO in enbseries.ini. Also, if your shadow settings are low then be sure to turn off skylighting or else you will see a sort of noise effect on your shadows.\r\n\r\nThis setup also darkens nights considerably. If you don\\'t like this effect, take a look at the Environment section in the ini.  \r\n\r\nThis setup was not meant to be used with Realistic Lighting, RCRN, or any color or lighting mods. Feel free to experiment with these combinations but try it without them first.\r\n\r\nTHIS MOD IS NOT MY ORIGINAL WORK. I SIMPLY UPDATED A PREEXISTING CONFIG. ALL CREDIT GOES TO HELIOSDOUBLESIX.\r\n\r\nORIGINAl - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4142/",
