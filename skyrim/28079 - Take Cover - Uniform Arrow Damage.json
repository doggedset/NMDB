  "modName": "Take Cover - Uniform Arrow Damage",
  "summary": "All arrows (with a few exceptions) do the same amount of damage, making combat against enemy archers more difficult and so the only thing you need to take into consideration when choosing which arrow to use is appearance. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"And you should know that there was at least an acre of land behind the Templars, which was so covered with arrows fired by the Saracens, that none of the ground could be seen.\\\"\r\n\r\n    - John of Joinville 11th February 1250 \r\n\r\nMOD DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nHello everyone!\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this mod is to make combat a bit more interesting (as even the iron arrows so favored by bandits now do significant damage) and so you can use whichever arrow you think looks the best without worrying about how much damage (or lack thereof) they do.\r\n\r\nThere are two options for this mod that you can download: the first (Uniform Arrow Damage) gives all arrow types (except Daedric, Dragonbone, Nord Hero and Bound) 20 base damage, the same as ebony arrows. The three exceptions, being mystical and/or special in nature, still do 24 damage. The second (Terrifying Uniform Arrow Damage) gives all the arrow types 50 damage, except the three special arrow types, which do 60 damage. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and endorse! If people show interest (e.g. if they endorse this mod) I will create an .esp where crossbow bolts also do uniform damage, and maybe even one where swords, maces, and all other weapons also do uniform damage....\r\n",
