  "summary": "Rael is a bored Argonian mage, who can be your follower. She is essential, and can make snarky comments about your location. She will also be able to comment on quests in later versions. Rael does not care much about Skyrim, but she cares enough about you to tag along your adventures.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Rael&#39;koush&#39;nala Follower\r<br />\r<br />~~~This is in alpha stage, it could have bugs/incompatibility problems~~~\r<br />\r<br />Who is Rael&#39;koush&#39;nala?\r<br />Rael is an Argonian Mage that came to Skyrim to learn about the Dwemer. Noticing how hard it is to actually get into the ruin, she really has not been doing much of that. She doesn&#39;t care much for Skyrim or the people, or any people or place for that matter. She makes snide comments on various things. You can ask her about her origin and some of her quirks.\r<br />\r<br />Where is she?\r<br />She is in Nightgate Inn, chilling out, just waiting for you to come and drag her along on some adventure.\r<br />\r<br />Follower mod compatibility?\r<br />She uses the vanilla follower system, nothing fancy.\r<br />EFF - I am using the beta version, and she follows, but the wheel does not show up.\r<br />AFT/UFO - I have no idea.\r<br />\r<br />Please comment if you are using the other mods and if you have problems or not...if I will be able to make a fix, I do not know, but it would at least be helpful to know.\r<br />\r<br />Features:\r<br />\r<br />- Location commentary: At the moment she comments on the major cities, ruins, caves, Inns, certain palaces, the College of Winterhold, Jorvaskr, and your houses.\r<br /> Note: She does not comment while idling, like most other follower mods do. I don&#39;t like hearing my followers say cool things while simply idling, because most times I can&#39;t hear them over each other, so if you want to hear what she has to say, you have to ask her.\r<br />\r<br />- Quest Commentary (Alpha-stage): She comments on the first few main quests, nothing much. I have not tested this fully, so please post problems.\r<br />\r<br />- Dialogue fully-voiced, in its terrible glory by the author (me).\r<br />\r<br />Plans:\r<br />- Add more location dialogue\r<br />- More quest awareness\r<br />- Maybe a crafting system, like you give her Dwemer ingots and she makes the Dwemer misc. items such as the Dynamo core.\r<br />\r<br />If you find any bugs, problems, or criticism please post it. This is my first real ambitious mod, so any help is very much welcome&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Credits/Thank you:\r<br />Tes General for providing the how-to-make a follower tutorials\r<br />Creationkit wiki for clearing some things up\r<br />Bethesda for making a great game\r<br />",
