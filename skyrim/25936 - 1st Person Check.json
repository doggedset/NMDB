  "descriptionHtml": "1st Person Check is my offering to the mod community for mod authors to either use as a master, a base to build on or to recreate by following the tutorial.  The purpose is to provide a global variable which can be used in Papyrus scripts so that authors may script different actions depending upon whether the player is in 1st person view or 3rd person view.\r<br />\r<br />This is not a new idea.  A tutorial, which for the uninitiated can be confusing, is located at [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Passing_Conditions_to_Papyrus]http://www.creationkit.com/Passing_Conditions_to_Papyrus[/url]. There may even already be mods out that use this process. \r<br />\r<br />I have expanded upon this method and outlined the steps to be a bit more clear and precise so that even new mod authors should be able to replicate. Please locate the tutorial in the Articles section [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/814571-tutorial-to-recreate-1st-person-check]http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/814571-tutorial-to-recreate-1st-person-check[/url].  It is recommended that you read both the original and my tutorial. The original explains that the idea is possible on other conditions. Whereas my tutorial is a specific walk through for setting up to check the status of 1st person view\r<br />\r<br />There is also available an ESM as the main download which could be used as a required master file. In the optional downloads is an ESP file (identical to the ESM) which could be used to build a new mod upon.\r<br />\r<br />To test either the ESM or ESP install one (not both) to your Skyrim &gt; Data directory. Start a game (new or old). Bring up the console and type [color=orange]help abim[/color] You should get as a result a global variable called abIM_1stPersonView.  When the value is at 1 you should be in 1st person view. When the value is at 0 you should be in 3rd person view.\r<br />",
