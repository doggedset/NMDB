  "descriptionHtml": "German Translation of original three adventures: by Stefanu\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38315//?\r\n\r\nThe Scholarly Adventures have been expanded. Newest version for download, which updates the original that we have come to enjoy by including another three unique adventures.\r\n\r\nFollowing the writings of a lonely scholar the dragonborn must dive into a library of books and pits his/her wits against forgotten legends and lore to assemble the clues that will lead to great wealth, relics, and knowledge.\r\n\r\nIsolated to the far northeast along the coast of Skyrim a scholar by the name of Alaves Ravel has begun collecting and cataloging old myths and stories. These books only appear to contain lore, but after closer inspection and a clever mind one can begin to put the clues together that can lead to great treasures.\r\nEmbark on an adventure that works on researching dusty tombs. Resolving hidden clues buried within the pages, and putting your hypothesis to the test out in the open expanse of Skyrim. Unlocking mystery\\'s and recovering lost treasures. See if the dragonborn has what it takes to be a Scholarly Adventurer.  \r\n\r\n1: This mod only requires Skyrim, no DLC required.\r\n2: UPDATED: Currently 6 unique adventures.\r\n3: Does not use the quest system, no way points or hand holding. get the feeling of real accomplishment when figuring out the clues.\r\n4: Alaves Ravel\\'s Home, Where all the adventures starts, is northeast of windhelm along the coast. See images for a screen shot.\r\n5: UPDATED: New location to brave, biased on historical data from the Elder Scrolls Shadowkey game. http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Shadowkey:Shadowkey\r\n6: UPDATED: This last version was pushed through TES5EDIT to clean up some dirty edits. Thank you Karios525.\r\n7: Scholar notes: Using other mods that increase the difficulty such as weather survival types or hunger and sleep requirements will make this mod more \\\"intense\\\" . I personally recommend trying some while being a scholarly adventure. \r\n\r\nTROUBLESHOOTING\r\n1: If something does not appear right, such as gates or doors not opening, Items say activate but nothing happens: The mod is likely missing scripts.\r\n- v0.3 had this issue, a update was pushed out that includes the script directory and custom scripts that did to upload with the original v0.3\r\n- This can be tested in Alaves Ravel\\'s Home. A model ship has an activation script that should give simple dialog, if this does not happen please get the update.\r\n\r\n- Sometimes because i include the original versions with the update when installing the new version it will try to have two copies of this mod running. ensure only the latest version is active. disable any other versions of this mod.\r\n- Best troubleshooting advice. This will erase all progress and items picked up from the mod. but great to reset objects and locations that appear damaged.\r\n1: Disable the mod \r\n2: load the save game\r\n3: Save the game without mod running. \r\n4: Quit game and reload the Mod\r\n5: Load the same saved game (mod should now be basically \\\"reinstalled\\\") ",
