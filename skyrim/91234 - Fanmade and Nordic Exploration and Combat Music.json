  "descriptionHtml": "[u][size=4]Fanmade &amp; Nordic Exploration and Combat Music [/size]\n<br />\n<br />Who wants to read long descriptions? Here you can listen to all new tracks added by this mod:\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]icTUFke-5t8[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]tmkD3VgLhe4[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />Description:\n<br />[/u]\n<br />I've been a fan of the show Vikings for a long time. I've been a fan of Skyrim and it's beautiful soundtrack for a long time. However, I always felt the lack of real badass Nordic-style battle themes and exploration tracks. So I decided to compose my own. They have been composed to seemlessly fit into the game.\n<br />\n<br />Before you ask, no, this mod doesn't feature any kind of Celtic music, becouse contrary to popular belief, Celtic and Nordic are not the same thing. And Skyrim is based on Nordic.\n<br />\n<br />This mod also features numerous other battle and exploration tracks not composed by me that also fit really well into the game with the works of Trevor Morris, Wardruna and some other artists. \n<br />\n<br />They have all been handpicked one by one to fit every setting and mood, while still keeping the 'nordic' flavour in them. Nearly 2 hours of epicness.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The usage of custom music in Skyrim is all made possible by modder No_Aardvarks_Allowed:\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/680166\n<br />\n<br />[u]I don't like a particular track! I want it removed right now![/u]\n<br />Simply go to your Skyrim&gt;Data&gt;Music folder. If you dislike a particular track, e.g. 'MMExploreMountain04' simply search it in the search bar and delete it. Done!\n<br />If you want to listen to what the XWM music files sound like, watch the video. \n<br />\n<br />I hope you enjoy,\n<br />DreymaMusic - Fantasy Composer",
