  "descriptionHtml": "This Description box is undergoing a lot of work, please bear with it and any outdated information it may contain. I will release the next version of the mod with a new, nicer looking description.\r\n[img]http://i1057.photobucket.com/albums/t390/sambeevors/itsyourrmod.jpg[/img]\r\n[color=red][b]This mod was a request.

[/color]\r\n\r\n[b] I would personally like to thank the following people:\r\n\r\n[color=red]loismustdie555[/color]\r\nThirif\r\netherealblade\r\nodst013\r\nkorgthil\r\nc00ky\r\natomicliquorice\r\nmuffinman593\r\nDanielLiswinski\r\n[/b]\r\n\r\nA mod which changes the armour of Orcs, Wood Elves, Deadra, Dark Elves, High Elves and more so that they wear their native armour and weapons in battle!\r\n\r\n[color=blue][b]There is now a video for this Mod, check out the videos tab[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[b] CHANGE LOG [/b]\r\nVersion 0.3A\r\nAdded \\'Rusty\\' armour to the game for the poorer orcs  \r\nAdded \\'Rusty\\' weapons to the game for the much poorer orcs  \r\nFixed a few bugs  \r\nMade Chiefs of strongholds / bandit camps more noticeable with a randomly generated circlet  \r\n\r\nCURRENT FEATURES\r\nAll Orcs in the game have been equipped with Orcish weapons, and any iron or steel armour has been replaced with Orcish armour.\r\nCustom Outfits added for Orc hunters so they will wear hunter armour with addition pieces of Orcish armour in some instances.\r\nNot all Orcs have Orcish armour, as it is not realistic for them to afford it, so some have a few parts or hide/leather armour instead. It\\\\\\'s just more common than iron / steel on an Orc.\r\nAll High elves in game to have Glass/Elven Armour and weapons more commonly.\r\nAll the Armours that the races commonly use now have a Rusty varient, will stats similar to iron and sometimes steel.\r\n\r\nFEATURES IN PROGRESS\r\nAll Wood elves in game to have Fur Armour and weapons more commonly.\r\nAll Dark elves in game to have Ebony Armour and weapons more commonly.\r\nAll Deadra in game to have Deadric Armour and weapons more commonly.\r\nMake it so there are 3 tiers below regular armour (e.g. Rusty, Tattered, Dinted) just like how there are tiers above regular armour (e.g. Fine, Superior, Epic)\r\n\r\nI DO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WILL MAKE ARMOURS EASY TO OBTAIN, TO RESOLVE THIS I HAVE ADDED \\'RUSTY\\' VARIANTS OF THE WEAPONS AND ARMOURS\r\n\r\nThis mod was created for 3 main reasons:\r\nFirstly to make fighting enemies more challenging,\r\nSecondly to make make obtaining rare armours easier,\r\nand Finally, to make more races unique from one another.\r\n\r\nKNOWN BUGS\r\nIf you load the mod last, it will conflict with all mods which affect anyone\\'s armour in the game, please load this mod first (After Skyrim and any other DLC\\'s you have installed and it will be fine)\r\n\r\nPLEASE ENDORSE AS THIS MOD TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO COMPLETE DUE TO THE FACT EVERY NONE-HUMAN NPC HAS TO BE EDITED ONE AT A TIME",
