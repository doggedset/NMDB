  "summary": "The dead do not need rest nor shelter",
  "descriptionHtml": "Arvak is dead. This is a fact, given to us by Bethesda.\r\nThe undead do not need to rest. This is known to anybody who\\'s ever seen zombie media.\r\nSo why in the name of the Nine does Arvak get tired?\r\n\r\nAs you might guess this bothered me. So I looked here to see if someone hadn\\'t done something about this grievous mistake.\r\nReduced casting cost, faster, better looking, but a horse that still gets tired.\r\nSo, it fell to me.\r\n\r\nWhat this mod actually does:\r\nAs you might\\'ve guessed from the semi-rant above, Arvak now has what I call \\'conceptually infinite stamina\\'.\r\nIt\\'s actually 32867 units of stamina (the max the game engine processes). So, you could, in theory, run him out of stamina. In theory.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nDownload and drop into your Data folder. Simple as that.\r\n\r\nIf you find any problems, let me know.\r\nArvak running out of stamina in a short time would be a big one.",
