  "descriptionHtml": "Latest Version 1.2, see the change log session :-).\r\n\r\nIf you like this mod, please endorse it. \r\nThis motivates us to continue the work :-)\r\n\r\n====================\r\n Description\r\n====================\r\n \r\nDragons? They are not dragons, they are just lizards with wings.\r\n \r\nThat was the impression I had of dragons in the game.\r\n \r\nI came to this conclusion when I saw a small group of soldiers easy killing Mirmulnir in Western Watchtower without any difficulty (and basically no losses).\r\n \r\nI saw a Frost Troll killing a Frost Dragon in Eldersblood Peak (simply because the Frost Troll is immune to the breath of the Frost Dragon and dragon bite did not cause enough damage due to Troll regeneration)\r\n and a farmer fighting a dragon with only their fists (and surviving two puffs of fire of the dragon).\r\n \r\nI thought, are just lizards with wings.\r\n \r\nI was not afraid to see a dragon ... Instead, I thought, another flying lizard.\r\n \r\nActually, I thought the dragon priests were a much bigger challenge than a dragon rs.\r\n \r\nI decided to change that.\r\n \r\nNow the Dragons are fearsome creatures that destroy and kill everything in their way.\r\n \r\nYou have to hide of his breath, and see how a Dovah can be deadly.\r\n \r\n====================\r\nChange log\r\n====================\r\n\r\nVERSION 1.2\r\n- Added Balanced Version\r\n\r\nVERSION 1.1\r\n- Increases resistance to magic and damage (50% of resistance)\r\n- Unleveled the leveled list(Optional). So, sometimes, due to their level, you need to flee instead of fight (Sometimes we are simply not prepared to kill certain dragon).\r\n- Increased the area of the fireball, frostball and icestorm to dragons. (Not the magic of the player)\r\n- Fixed problem where some dragons were not changed by the mod. Now, all dragons are more powerful.\r\n\r\nVERSION 1.0\r\n  Old Version\r\n-Damage from melee attacks, such as biting among others, have been increased.\r\n-Damage to the breath of dragons have been increased.\r\n-Added more resistant to damage and magic to the dragons (25% of Resistence).\r\n-Increasing Difficulty of dragons\r\n\r\n\r\n====================\r\n Technical Data\r\n====================\r\n \r\nDamage from melee attacks, such as biting among others, have been increased.\r\n \r\nDamage to the breath of dragons have been increased.\r\n \r\nAdded more resistant to damage and magic to the dragons (50% of Resistence).\r\n \r\nIncreasing life of dragons\r\n\r\nIncreasing Difficulty of dragons\r\n \r\n====================\r\n compatibility\r\n====================\r\n \r\nThis mod is not compatible with mods That alter Dragons.\r\n \r\n====================\r\n bugs\r\n====================\r\n \r\nNone that I know of.\r\n\r\nIf you find any bugs, please let me know ;-).\r\n \r\n====================\r\n Installation\r\n====================\r\n \r\nExtract the contents of .zip file in Skyrim/Data and check the plugin in game launcher.\r\n \r\n====================\r\n uninstall\r\n====================\r\n \r\nSimply uncheck the plugin in the game launcher. \r\n\r\n====================\r\nMy Other Mods\r\n====================\r\n\r\nBetter Werewolf by RPM\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4102 ",
