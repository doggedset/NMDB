A mesh folder for the, uh, armor&#39;s meshes.  \r<br />2.) A textures folder for the, uhm, what was it?  Oh, oh yeah, it&#39;s for the armor&#39;s textures. \r<br />3.) A CalienteTools folder for the bodyslide files for, you know, to properly conform the armor to the body.\r<br />4.) An esp file (also known as .esp file extension) to be added to your Skyrim Data folder so you can activate it with your favorite mod manager thereby allowing the armor to show up in game.\r<br />Why this tip helpful:  Sometimes these miscellaneous folders from these miscellaneous armor mods made by miscellaneous people don&#39;t go into the correct places in your Skyrim directory, so ensure that they do by manually dragging and dropping them to where they need to be if necessary.  \r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />Be sure to endorse those other mod authors because without them this most amazin of Amazon mods would not be possible.  I didn&#39;t do hardly any work except be a huge perv as any indication of this mod might point to.\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />Skin textures used are from Demoniac:  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70834/?]Found here[/url]\r<br />ENB is Tetrachromatic ENB:  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73848/?]Found here[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />Don&#39;t forget to listen to Death Metal and eat meat.  Also, don&#39;t play scary games at night by yourself, that&#39;s just a bad idea no matter how you look at it.  And follow your heart and your dreams&#33;  Definitely use this mod as inspiration and guidance&#33;\r<br />\r<br /> ",
