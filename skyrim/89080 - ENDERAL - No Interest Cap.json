Interest is now properly counted every day. Used to be if you waited more than 24 hours, that counted only as 1 24/hour cycle for the bank. With this mod, you get paid for every day.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f6b26b][size=5][u]INCLUDES\n<br />[/u][/size][/color][/b]\n<br />A script that replaces a script already in the game. Shouldn't make a significant difference.\n<br />\n<br />An ESP that changes the bank message reminding you that the limit is 250. It's not essential.",
