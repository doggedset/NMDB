  "summary": "Pelagius Wing needed a remake.  I always wanted to put a player home in Solitude, preferably in the Blue Palace!  Enjoy!",
  "descriptionHtml": "Update 1.3: Finally finished updating and double checking that everything works good.  The main purpose of this update was to include all the changes from all the player homes.  I found it was better to have all my player home mods inter connected.  I do hope you like the changes and since my incorporation of Hearthfire all player homes now hove ovens as well as food storage bins close by.  Enjoy the update!\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.2: I don\\'t think I will ever quit working on this thing!  Did a few more tweeks here and there and added a large update that took me a while too complete.  This update will REQUIRE you to have Dawnguard and Hearthfire installed as well (If you want me to do a version without it let me know).  I decided the biggest problem with the Pelagius Wing is there is only one door to get in and one door to get out.  I remedied this by adding a teleport room off of the master bedroom.  The teleport locations include all purchasable homes from Whiterun, Riften, Windhelm, Solitude, & Markath.  I also added teleports to the Thieves Guild & Archmages Tower.  Each location will require a key which is located in the house.  I did not mod too much to the player houses except Breezehome, I added a crafting room and the trapdoor is in the middle of it.  I then added a teleporter to both Dawnguard locations, Dawnguard Fort and Volkihar Keep.  The keys are located at each respective location.  Lastly, all the player created homes from Hearthfire have been added.  The mod requires you to build at least the Small Layout for each player home and upon entering, you will see a trapdoor with a key on it to your immediate left.  Hope you all enjoy this update as it took me awhile to do!\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1.1: Decided that the final basement needed a revamp.  Did not like the layout and the lack of mannequins/weapon storage.  So I enlarged the basement and separated the Companion room and kitchen.  I also put the keys to the Blue Palace - Pelagius Wing in the Jarl\\'s Room in a strongbox.  I will test if this will mess up the quest or not at a future date.  Still endorse me if you like it.   If it does work without the quest I will add a transport beacon door that will take you directly to the Pelagius Wing in Breezehome or maybe even in Riverwood no matter which person you escape Helgen with.  Still a work in progress!\r\n\r\nThis mod makes some pretty heavy modifications to the Pelagius Wing.  I never really liked it as once you finished that quest, the wing was still a dump and was utilized for nothing.  I thought a nice cool player home would be perfect for that area.  You still need to do the Pelagius quest to get the key and I moved the quest starter/marker to underneath one of the staircases.  I did not test it, so hopefully it still works.  Hopefully you will all like the layout as it is one of my largest modifications to date!  If you want me to put a key to access it without the quest I can do that, but I figured a tiny bit of legwork is not a big deal.  No DLC is required for this, but it will work with all DLCs!\r\n\r\n",
