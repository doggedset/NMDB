It is situated near Boulderfall Cave, in the\r\nmiddle of the nature but not far from civilization.\r\nThis house has been intended for a ranger type \r\ncharacter...\r\n\r\nThe house itself has some very original features:\r\n\r\n-Most exterior houses have been built with the shack \r\nkit, while my house has been built with a modified \r\nversion of an already existing Riften Farmhouse.\r\nSo, it is not a shack, but a real house!\r\n\r\n-There are real windows, so you can literally see \r\nthrough the windows. There are also balconies, but\r\nthey are static.\r\n\r\n-Thanks to a script made by Xilante, inside the house\r\nand the other minor buildings it will never rain.\r\nOf course, where there is no roof, you will see the\r\nrain that continues to fall down. Like in real life.\r\nYou are under a cover and you are watching the rain.\r\nAwesome!\r\n\r\n-You can create your wooden arrows!\r\n\r\n-Items around the house will be an unmovable version\r\nof the original ones.\r\n\r\n-You will be able to lit the fireplace. After 3 hours\r\nit will die, and you will have to lit it up again.\r\nThis burning cycle has its own lightning-smoking-\r\nsound system.\r\nThere are three different fireplace stages meshes.\r\n\r\n-The cooking pot will initially start disabled. When\r\nyou will use it, fire will light up and a light will\r\nbegin to work. Also, it will appear some smoke.\r\nWhen you will leave the cooking pot, everything will\r\nreturn as the start.\r\n\r\n-The dining table\\'s items are not static: when you\r\nwill sit down, they will appear. When you will stand\r\nup, they will disappear. The only static thing is the\r\ntable\\'s cloth.\r\n\r\n-You can use rail lean markers (not only in the\r\nhouse rail, but everywhere in Skyrim!)\r\n\r\n-You can see yourself laying down in the bed. Of\r\ncourse, the sleeping menu is still available!\r\n\r\n-The house itself is extremely interactive: when you\r\nwill have to store your items, you will have to find\r\nwhere to store them. A part from that, furniture will\r\nbe fully animated and you will be able to have a look\r\ninside it.\r\nIn poor words...I created a new-completely interactive\r\nstorage system.\r\nHere\\'s an example: do you want to store some clothes?\r\nFine! You have to go inside the house, then to the \r\nwardrobe. Interact with the wardrobe: it will fully \r\nopen. As you can see, the wardrobe is pretty much\r\ndetailed: inside it you will find a shirt, some shoes\r\nand some boots, some gloves, some hats, a knife, a\r\nbag and two pairs of trousers. Now you will say: \r\n\\\"Where can I store my clothes? There are no\r\ncontainers inside the wardrobe!\\\" \r\nInside the wardrobe there are six invisible chests.\r\nIf you want to store your boots, look at the boots in\r\nthe wardrobe, then press space (I use original\r\nkeyboard settings).\r\nIf you want to store your hats, look at the hats, then\r\npress space...\r\nThat\\'s how you have to interact with the house objects.\r\nPS: in the invisible chests you may store whatever you\r\nwish...for example, in the \\\"books\\\" chest you may store\r\nitems that aren\\'t books (like swords, food, etc...)\r\nI created a lot of chests in order to improve \r\nroleplaying...\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n2) HOW TO INSTALL/UNINSTALL THIS MOD\r\n\r\nInstallation: extract all files (but NOT the \r\nreadmes!) in your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\nRemember to have a look to the Skyrim Launcher: my\r\n.esp must be set as active file.\r\nUninstallation: simply delete the same files you \r\ninstalled.\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n3) SOME WARNINGS BEFORE STARTING TO USE THIS MOD\r\n\r\n- The house itself is completely exterior and there is\r\na large number of objects. This may cause some lag on\r\nlower end computers. \r\nIf you experience a lot of lag, just try to close your\r\nantivirus and some other applications (like your \r\ninternet browser, some useless background programs).\r\nOtherwise, try to start the game with applications like\r\n\\\"Gamebooster\\\" by Iobit.\r\nOtherwise, open the Skyrim launcher and try to lower the\r\ndetails.\r\nIf it continues to lag, I\\'m sorry, you can\\'t use this\r\nmod with your pc.\r\nHowever, I have a medium end computer...it lags only \r\nwhen approaching the house. After max 5 seconds, the lag\r\ndisappears and the game becomes pretty much stable.\r\n\r\n- All the chests don\\'t respawn and are safe-storage.\r\nThe only exceptions are the basket (\\\"Really??\\\" xD) and\r\nthe backup chest.\r\nIf you want to know more about the chests, just have a\r\nlook to the other readme in the downloaded archive.\r\n\r\n-In the internet, I read about people complaying about\r\ndisappearing things from safe-storage chests. An user\r\nexplained this happens when in a chest you store all \r\nof the USA population. However, they don\\'t disappear, \r\nthey are still in there, but you have to remove all \r\nthe visible things in order to see them again. It is \r\na visual bug. In order to bypass this bug, just try to \r\ndon\\'t store 100000 items in a chest ;)\r\n\r\n-The arrows you will create will be not powerful.\r\nThat\\'s because they are made by pure wood.\r\nI did not allowed to craft other type of arrows because\r\nit was a nonsense. For example, in order to create the\r\nhead of an iron arrow, you must work the iron in the \r\nforge. But I think putting a forge near the house was\r\na bad idea...it doesn\\'t syncronize with the landscape,\r\nit is too big and it is too much for a ranger house...\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n4) CREDITS\r\n\r\nThanks to BETHESDA SOFTWORKS TEAM for creating this \r\nwounderful game and for releasing the Creation Kit.\r\n\r\nThanks to RIP88: if you can enter into the house without\r\na loading door, it happens thanks to him! In fact, he \r\nhelped me deleting the drawed door (and its collision \r\ntoo) from the original house model.\r\nHe also helped me with some retexturing and with some\r\nmesh editing (for example, the treasury chest door).\r\nHe also gave me the permissions in order to use some\r\ncool scripts of him.\r\nSince v1.1, he has been a constant help and, without\r\nhim, the mod wouldn\\'t be what it has become!!\r\nLet\\'s say most updates\\'work has been done by him, or\r\nsometimes has been done by me, but he teached me how to\r\ndo it correctly.\r\n\r\nThanks to ISHARAMERADIN, wich tried to help me with\r\na script. He also helped me to fix a problem with\r\nwooden arrows and he is the owner of the fireplace\r\nstages script (lighting, sounds and smoke features have\r\nbeen added by me, with the help of RIP88)\r\nWant to download Isharameradin fireplace stages script?\r\nHere\\'s the download link to this amazing feature!\r\n\\\"Campfire Stages\\\"\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26799/?\r\n\r\nThanks to IZON87604 for his wounderful video review.\r\n\r\nThanks to XILANTE for creating the rain clipping method\r\nand for sharing his tutorial!\r\nI consider him a great modder, because he did an\r\nextremely important work Bethesda Team may have forgot \r\nto do.\r\nHere\\'s the download link to his tutorial:\r\n\\\"Rain and Snow clipping\\\"\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18651\r\n\r\nThanks to ARTISANIX for creating a wounderful painting\r\ncollection for this game.\r\nHere\\'s the download link to his modder resource.\r\n\\\"Paintings and Frames\\\"\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17423\r\n\r\nThanks to STROTI for creating the outdoor toilet for\r\nOblivion.\r\nThanks to TAMIRA for converting it for Skyrim.\r\nHere\\'s the download link to the Skyrim version of the\r\ntoilette:\r\n\\\"Strotis Outdoor Toilet Resource\\\"\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32056/?\r\n\r\nThanks to INSANITY SORROW for creating his sofas and\r\nchairs collection. And for creating his curtains \r\ncollection.\r\nIf you want to download those modder\\'s resources, just\r\nopen you search engine and search for\r\n\\\"Insanity\\'s Curtains\\\"\r\nand\r\n\\\"Insanity\\'s Sofas & Chairs\\\"\r\nPS: I don\\'t put a download link because those mods\r\naren\\'t hosted in the nexus site.\r\n\r\nThanks to MY GIRLFRIEND, wich helped me with some ideas\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n5) NEXT RELEASES\r\n\r\nSince this is an experimental version of the final\r\nrelease, I think there will be only one other release.\r\nIf you like exterior houses, I\\'m building a completely\r\ncustom house in the mountains ;)\r\n\r\nHere\\'s what should happen in the next release:\r\n-Fix the double fence gate (sometimes it is glitched)\r\n-Fix the dining table feature (glitched)\r\n-Add an horse marker to the stables\r\n-Do some changes to the stables mesh\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n6) VERSION HISTORY\r\n\r\nv1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nv1.1: Here\\'s what happened...\r\n- The user RIP88 removed the exterior house model drawed\r\ndoor and its collision. \r\n-The drawed door has been deleted, so, from now on,\r\nyou will be able to enter/exit the house without loading \r\nscreens and the weather will reset anymore! (From now\r\non, you will be able to watch the rain from inside the\r\nhouse)\r\n-Since it was not possible to remove only the drawed\r\ndoor collision, I had to put some collision barriers\r\nin the exterior house model. (Don\\'t worry, thanks to \r\nthose barriers, the house has full collision).\r\n-I modified the entrance: Since the old door served for\r\nteleport purposes only, I changed it and I replaced it\r\nwith the other Riften double door. The new door is\r\nfully animated, so, you will be able to enter/exit the\r\nhouse like in real life.\r\n-Now you can craft wooden arrows, just use the\r\nanvil near the sharpening wheel!\r\n20arrows=4firewood\r\nThe arrows are pratically identical to the forsworn\r\nones, but they do 6 base damage.\r\n-I added a pickaxe in the tools shed.\r\n-I created two new chests.\r\n-In the english version, I translated two words I \r\nforgot to translate in v1.0 (armchair and home)\r\n-In the download archive, I added another readme: in\r\nthat readme you will find a list of all the containers,\r\nthe crafting stations and the harvestable things.\r\nOf course, this is not a pure list, there is also some\r\nexplaination!\r\n\r\nv1.2: Here\\'s what happened...\r\n-RIP88 did some nice retextures (like the toilette one\r\nor the entrance wall one)\r\n-RIP88 modified the model of the exterior ladder,\r\nremoving the trapdoor that was going inside the house,\r\nnear the bed.\r\n-RIP88 created the treasury chest\\'s door: from now on,\r\nyou will be able to open/close the treasury chest and\r\nto interact with its content!!\r\n-RIP88 generated accurate navmeshes.\r\n-RIP88 created a script that will insert in your \r\ninventory the keys you will need.\r\n-Changed the kitchen chair with a new one (thanks to\r\nRIP88 for sitting position editing)\r\n-I changed the entrance door\\'s textures: now the\r\nentrance door looks identical to the door from v1.0\r\n-I edited the bench\\'s position: since v1.1, the \r\ncharacter didn\\'t sit correctly. That happened because \r\nof the collision barriers I inserted.\r\n-Fixed lighting: now inside the house lights will never\r\nstop lighting. Reduced the number of lights\r\n-Two beams of the interior roof were not alligned...now\r\nthey are.\r\n-Resized the burning wood (it was going outside the\r\nfireplace)\r\n-Now the ladder stands up\r\n-Some other minor fixes I don\\'t remember.\r\n\r\nv1.3: Here\\'s what happened...\r\n-Thanks to RIP88, a door lock script has been added.\r\nNow bad guys will not be able to enter the property..\r\nif you will close the gates in time!\r\n-RIP88 did some changes to the fence gate door model:\r\nnow both gates open at the same time!\r\n-Added the fireplace feature: now you will need to\r\nlit the fireplace, and, after 3 hours, it will die\r\nand you will have to lit it again. The fireplace works\r\nwith its own lighting-sound-smoke system. It is\r\nabsolutely realistic!!! (Thanks to ISHARAMERADIN and\r\nto RIP88)\r\n-Added the cooking pot feature: now the cooking pot\r\nwill initially start without embers. When you will\r\nuse it, embers will turn on. Embers have their own\r\nlighting and smoking system! Another absolutely\r\nrealistic feature!\r\n-Added the dining table feature: when you will sit\r\ndown, things placed over the table will appear. When\r\nyou will stand up, they will disappear.\r\n-Added the possibility to lay down in the bed. Of\r\ncourse, you are still able to use the sleeping menu.\r\n-Moved some feets away the wheel and placed a stable\r\nnear of it.\r\n-Reduced the scale of the two jugs that were located\r\nover the fireplace. Now they look nicer.\r\n-The table cloth has been edited with Nifskope. Thanks\r\nto RIP88, now it is an unique piece! (Before there\r\nwere two table clothes, and they were ugly!)\r\n-Some other minor things I don\\'t remember.\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n7) PERMISSIONS\r\n\r\nYou can edit this mod, but ONLY FOR PERSONAL USE.\r\nYOU CAN\\'T SHARE this mod in the internet.
