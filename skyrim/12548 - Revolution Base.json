  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds not only a home with tons of mannequins, weapon racks, and weapon racks, but also adds around 24 new epic followers who will fight by your side no matter what. the followers are in groups of races and guilds. each character in each guild has a special talent in a skill. There is a mage, warrior, archer, and healer in each group of characters.plus, a practice room with dummies and archery targets in the east side of the building. This area can be found by walking into the new door in the Vlinderal hall in Markarth. It is called the Lothian at the moment, becuase i thought it sounded cool. It will be updated often, if, people like it.",
