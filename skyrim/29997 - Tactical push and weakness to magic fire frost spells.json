  "summary": "adds tactical push and weakness to magic, frost, shock and fire  (and 3 bonus spells)",
  "descriptionHtml": "adds three spells that allows you to push your enemy to avoid him to get near your mage character and makes him weak to fire frost etc... while you attack him with your other hand\r\n\r\nexample, it happened to me that a lot of times i was a very fair mage, and suddenly some forsworm, and amidst them a dual wield one... ok killed some of them with my spells, send flying some with shout, but the dual wield get near very quick and done, killed... no ward can protect me, shout recharging, and its very difficult to fight with spells at close range right?...\r\n\r\nwell now you can equip thunderbolt or whatever in one hand and in the other tactical weakness to shock... so you push him and make him weak with one hand as you put some distance, and you fry his sorry arshe with the other... i don\\'t think its a cheat, only a resort for mages to keep them away...\r\n\r\nalso it gets more stronger with the master alteration perk, and send your enemy away not only stagger them...\r\n\r\ninstall: drop the .esp to the data directory and activate it\r\n\r\npd: it uses the default unrelenting force projectile and sounds and casting arts etc, so if you have a mod that changes those things the mod will change too...\r\n\r\nthe spells books are in some dungeons... one has to do with crystals in a cave, the other has to do with nirnroots and a old friend, and the last has to do with the cabin of a relative of your bride... i\\'ve also put three bonus spells in abandoned cabin(astrid), angarvunde and ansilvund (if you wants them so bad in console put: \\\"help tactical 4\\\" and then player.addspell \\\"and the id number of the spells\\\")\r\n\r\nIF YOU LIKE IT, ENDORSE IT! so it gets to more people that can have this advantage in combat.",
