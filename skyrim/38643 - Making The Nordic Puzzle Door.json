  "descriptionHtml": "Quite sometime ago I posted a video on YouTube which explains how to make a working Nordic Puzzle Door. Since then I have been getting several replies and questions.\r\nWith this file I have included an .esm which you can place into your DATA folder. You can then open your CK and inspect the cell I created with all the pieces laid out and correctly linked and ready to go. \r\nI have also included a READ ME file which lists all the pieces you will need as well as a link to my tutorial on YouTube. Or you can just watch it here.\r\nSince I made the video I have learned a lot more about these doors, so some of the stuff I say may seem a bit obsolete. \r\nI do not explain how all this is done in writing on the READ ME. Sorry, but there is just too much to write out.",
