  "descriptionHtml": "This was just a little thing I did to teach myself how to make spells in Skyrim, and I figured I might as well upload it here. \r<br />\r<br />The mod adds a spell that gives the caster the nightvision effect that the Kahjiit and vampires have. It is an alteration spell with similar levels and value to magelight, and can be bought in Whiterun from Farengar. If it&#39;s not there then try waiting until his shop restocks.\r<br />\r<br />There shouldn&#39;t be any compatibility issues with anything, if you find one or a bug report it in the comments and I&#39;ll see what I can do. As far as permissions go you can do whatever with this as long as you give credit.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy~",
