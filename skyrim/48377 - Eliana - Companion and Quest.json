  "descriptionHtml": "[size=15][b][center]Meet Eliana[/b][/size]\r<br />Using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35267/?]SG Female Textures Renewal[/url] with ENB.\r<br />[img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/48377-1-1397224854.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[u]ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:[/u][/center] \r<br /> - Eliana would like to personally thank apachii hair styles for her hairdo. Apachii has given permission for Eliana to use it. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/?]ApachiiSkyHair[/url]\r<br /> - Eliana also would like to thank Bjorn for providing the special music for a couple of the quest and dialogues. [url=http://www.shockwave-sound.com]Shockwave Sound[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[center][u]DESCRIPTION:[/u][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Please check the change log for recent changes. Still lots to do.\r<br />\r<br />Now over [b]500[/b] lines of dialogue and counting&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Eliana is a young, quirky and silly, though a very opinionated idealist woman, with maybe a small streak of practicality. Say things she doesn&#39;t like, and eventually she will leave you. Show yourself to be a kindred spirit, and she&#39;ll follow you forever (and tell you how much she likes you.)\r<br />\r<br />As of version 0.1.2, I have removed Eliana&#39;s voice since it was generated and poor quality. I&#39;ll be getting a more professional voice actor once the mod is more complete. [b]Until then, I [size=14]HIGHLY[/size] suggest getting [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14884/?]Fuz Ro D-oh[/url].[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Eliana has a specific philosophy and personality, and her opinions and ideas all tie to it. \r<br />\r<br />The screen shots show an example of parts of one of the dialogues. There are over 500 lines of dialogue so far in this mod.\r<br />\r<br />If what you want is a companion that carries your stuff and maybe presents some unique battle skills, this companion is NOT FOR YOU. But if you are tired of the &#34;thane complex&#34; and want a rich personality, lots of serious, moral, and silly banter, and some serious personal quest, as well as some thinking, then this character is JUST RIGHT for you.\r<br />\r<br />If you want a spoiler, probably the only spoiler I will give, here is where you begin:\r<br />[spoiler]You can start off this companion mod by talking to the wounded guard in the temple of Kynareth in Whiterun.[/spoiler]\r<br />\r<br />I labeled this mod as adult since some of the plots in the quest are dark, as it was the best way to present the themes. There is no nudity as far as this mod is concerned.\r<br />\r<br />[center][u]FUTURE PLANS:[/u][/center]\r<br />Eliana is not complete and still has some major work to be done. \r<br />\r<br />Completed:\r<br /> - 2 quest that tie somewhat into the overall plot.\r<br /> - Basic follower functionality with dialogue that changes with the relationship.\r<br /> - Multiple chatting opportunities to improve or degrade your relationship.\r<br /> - A slew of idle chats, hums, jokes, etc.\r<br />\r<br />To do:\r<br /> - Some of the speech needs to be cleaned up, as the wording can be awkward.\r<br /> - Officiating dialogue for entering into a relationship with Eliana (right now it&#39;s all passive.)\r<br /> - More quest and story specific banter.\r<br /> - More dialogue, and then more dialogue.\r<br /> - Different reactions to different genders near the beginning (obviously she wouldn&#39;t be as suspicious towards another woman.)\r<br />\r<br />[center][u]PERMISSIONS:[/u][/center]\r<br />ASK ME BEFORE YOU MODIFY OR REDISTRIBUTE THIS MOD. Always ask. I WILL find you if you modify my mod without my permission, and I will take you down with THE VOICE.\r<br />\r<br />[center][u]CREDIT:[/u][/center]\r<br />ApachiiSkyHair for Eliana&#39;s hair\r<br />Special music by Bjorn - http://www.shockwave-sound.com",
