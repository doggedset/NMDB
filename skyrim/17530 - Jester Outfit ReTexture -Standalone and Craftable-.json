  "descriptionHtml": "EDIT: Fixed the placement issues with the alternate hat, now it should be in the same position as the normal hat. \r\n- Fixed the issue with enchanting :)\r\n\r\nINFO ON THE MAKE-UPS AND HAIR: The front picture is heavily edited to fit the jester theme better (used to look like this http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/imageshare/image.php?id=87611) I use Yinsiyue hairs, which are not on this site, but the retexture mod has a link to the original http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5521 I also use that mod. For the face in the rest of the pics I use \\'Dark Races by Bella\\' which has been either removed or hidden. And then a vanilla warpaint.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because the original one looks like someone threw up their dinner (and mead) on an old table cloth and then stiched it together, no offense. So I wanted to make it more my style.\r\nThis has both cloth and light armor version of the outfit and can be crafted in the \\'Misc\\' section. And it can be improved on a workbench, both cloth and light armor versions are unenchanted. There\\'s two versions of the hat, the original one is the one that will most likely make your character bald unless you\\'re using the vanilla hairs, and then the alternate version that works with custom hair. When using the alternate one your hair will most likely clip through it, I\\'m personally not bothered by it, but just so you know. The light armor version has the same armor rating as the Ancient Shrouded Armor. \r\n\r\nThere is a replacer available if you want to replace the vanilla textures with these.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n-The screens may look a little low-res because Steam always screws up the screenshots :/\r\n-The replacer version only replaces the textures and does not make the outfit craftable\r\n-You can use both versions (replacer and standalone) at the same time, if you want to replace the vanilla textures AND be able to craft this. OR you can download another mod that makes the Jester outfit craftable, your choice.\r\n-The lack of male pictures is because I only play as a female, \\'cause I\\'m not a dude.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not sure if anyone noticed the \\'hidden WIP\\' picture I uploaded earlier. I hid a \\'message\\' implying that this was still WIP back then, but that it was going to be released. No one pointed it out so I guess no one even noticed :/ or they just didn\\'t bother to comment on it x)\r\n\r\nThanks for the videos! ^^\r\n[youtube]nJ97KhS_TPg[/youtube]\r\n[youtube]4kue4B3Xx5k[/youtube]\r\n[youtube]SrasXaxxh94[/youtube]\r\n\r\nI don\\'t think there\\'s any problems (hopefully), but if there is let me know.\r\n\r\nAs usual tell me what you think and feel free to add your own images (as I don\\'t really have any male pictures). Hope you like it! Thank You :)\r\n\r\nSorry for my terrible English.",
