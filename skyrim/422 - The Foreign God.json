Around the second era (2E), Blodey turned his gaze from his realms to the known realms, but had not dared to make an appearance or disturb any of the mortals or Gods of the known realms. The demigod has long since admired and became learned of the inhabitants of Nirn and their cultures.\r\n\r\nIn 3E 153, Blodey attempted to create his own set of life forms on Nirn\\'s moon Secunda, which he proclaimed Juria. He first attempted the smallest of the flora, which failed quickly. After many years of trial and error, Blodey finally perfected lifeforms to his standards. In 4E 200, Khajiit astronomers turned their attention to Secunda and theories and rumors of strange life had started around Morrowind, and by 4E 201, small shrines throughout Tamriel to the foreign god had been produced.\r\n\r\n[i]Presented by the 1337 Brigade (www.1337.jp)[/i]",
