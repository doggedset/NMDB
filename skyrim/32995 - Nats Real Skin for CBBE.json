  "summary": "My first skin for Skyrim designed for the CBBE body, comes in 4 flavors, Shaved, Strip, Brasil and Unshaven.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first texture set for Skyrim.  It\\'s for CBBE bodies and is a combination of my original work using some high resolution textures for skin pores, nipples and er.. other parts as well as using other textures to work from as a starting point.  \r\n\r\nFor this release I\\'ve gone for the toned clean look, but I do have thoughts to make a flat stomach version, and then dirtied up skins rather than the \\\"show room\\\" model look later.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve done my best to try and ensure that the skin is seamless and it\\'s pretty darn close, I don\\'t use ENB so I haven\\'t got those dreamy awesome images to show, but I think the images I made give an idea of how it looks, but of course it looks much better in game I think :)\r\n\r\nFile sizes:\r\nbody files are 2048x2048\r\nhands are 1024x1024\r\n\r\nUse NMM to install,or manually place all files in Data/textures/actor/character/female \r\n\r\nNO HEAD TEXTURES INCLUDED, so your face wont be changed by installing this.\r\n\r\nBig shout out go to::\r\n\r\nApachii for the amazing hair styles\r\nCaliente for CBBE, love it\r\nSvarogNL for his great work on abs and body muscle styles\r\nXS2REALITY amazing skin work\r\nNavetsea for more amazing skin textures\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSince my skin doesn\\'t contain a head texture, it can happen that there will be a visible join line between the body and neck (neck seam), I advise installing Calientes CBBE from here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666 and running the enclosed Texture Blender to remove any neck seam.\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n\r\n**Version 1.2 installer fixed to correct file structure. 07/04/13\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2\r\nOverhaul of body normal map and texture, both improved over the whole body as well as pubic region, normal map for hands improved to give more detailed looking fingers.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\nSorry for the rapid update to 1.1, but it did fix something that really didn\\'t look right with the texture.\r\n\r\n**************************************\r\nI\\'d just like to add (after missing a credit above)  that the work of other texture artists is not just very good, but I found it essential, without these great texture artists I would not have known where to start, and I\\'m sure the same could be said by many others trying to learn texturing in Skyrim and you all have my appreciation for the work you have done.
