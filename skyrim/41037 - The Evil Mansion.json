  "descriptionHtml": "-----------------------\r<br />[b]NEW VERSION 3.0 AVAILABLE HERE:[/b]\r<br />[url]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47795/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />This file won&#39;t be updated because v3.0 requires a new installation/playthrough.\r<br />-----------------------\r<br />\r<br />A reconstruction of Resident Evil 1 as Questlocation and Playerhouse.\r<br />\r<br />Contains the entire Spencer Mansion, Dormitory, Laboratorium, parts of the Caves and an improvised exterior area.\r<br />\r<br />The whole architecture and atmosphere is close as possible to the original Resident Evil game, but everything else is slightly redesigned to fit in the world and timeline of Skyrim.\r<br />The connections between all the locations are newly created to match the outer area good as possible and to promote the playability.\r<br />\r<br />There is no listed questline, but close to Resident Evil you have to face the evil inside and solve some secrets to push through.\r<br />\r<br />After clearing the whole location is fully usable as Playerhouse, probably the biggest you can get. :)\r<br />(But it&#39;s not designed to be practically&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />NOTES\r<br />==================\r<br />- 95% of the enemys are leveled so it should be playable for all characters. 5% are not leveled.\r<br />- No other Mods or Add-Ons are required.\r<br />- There should be no compatibility problem with other mods, as long the exterior location arround Morthal is not influenced.\r<br />- The Mansion is located in the northern swamps of Morthal, there are no important objects deleted or moved to get space for the Mansion, just 3 fishspawns, some Deathbells and Swamp Fungal Pods which are basically all replaced.\r<br />- Some interior-cells are huge, specially the upper Mansion. Loading time might be long and performance bad. For high grafic settings a good pc is required.\r<br />- It&#39;s my first work with CK. If there are big mistakes, bugs or whatever, please let me know.\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />HOW TO INSTALL (MANUAL)\r<br />==================\r<br />Before updating from an old version, create a savepoint with the old version deactivated and remove the old .esp- and bsa-file in the data folder.\r<br />---------------------------\r<br />- Extract the &#34;Data&#34; folder into your Skyrim directory.\r<br />(...Steamsteamappscommonskyrim)\r<br />\r<br />- &#34;Yes&#34; to replace.\r<br />\r<br />- Open the Skyrim launcher\r<br />- Click on data files\r<br />- Check &#34;TheEvilMansion.esp&#34;\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />HOW TO REMOVE (MANUAL)\r<br />==================\r<br />- Remove &#34;TheEvilMansion.esp&#34; from the &#34;Data&#34; folder.\r<br />- Remove &#34;TheEvilMansion.bsa&#34; from the &#34;Data&#34; folder.\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />RECOMMENDED MODS\r<br />==================\r<br />-Tougher Traps \r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/952//?\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />TROUBLESHOOTING\r<br />==================\r<br />- Doors won&#39;t open, even if i have the key. \r<br />=That&#39;s a rare but randomly appearing bug, an activation command on taking the key was missed then. Only way to fix this is load a save before you took the key and pick it up again. \r<br />\r<br />- On entering the Mansion NPCs are not loaded, if for example the Dinning Hall (first room left) is empty. \r<br />=Also randomly appearing, possibly caused by the filesize. To fix this you have to load a savepoint before you entered the concerning location and try it again. \r<br />\r<br />- The gas in the armor-room is already triggered\r<br />=That&#39;s not a mistake. Unlike to the game i had to change this a bit, don&#39;t try to disable the gas inside this room, that&#39;s deadly.\r<br />\r<br />- I&#39;m stuck. \r<br />=The most hidden buttons/keys are placed similar to Resident Evil. Without knowing the game it might not be easy to push through, just leave me msg then or write in the comments to get help. \r<br />I recommend not to use &#34;tcl&#34; to move through locked doors/areas, this can destroy important triggers.\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />HINTS\r<br />==================\r<br />- Poison Gas is deadly. Don&#39;t walk in, it&#39;s possible to disable it somewhere else.\r<br />- Companions could get lost in the location called &#34;Underground&#34;, let them wait before you enter, you&#39;ll come back.\r<br />- Some puzzles are not solvable from the beginning, keep them for later.\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />KNOWN BUGS\r<br />==================\r<br />- rare and randomly things like objects, markers or enemys just not get loaded correctly. \r<br />- There is no Distance-LOD, the Mansion is not visible from very large distances, same for the changed landscape.\r<br />- small clipping errors.\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />==================\r<br />For the very detailed maps of Resident Evil:\r<br /> - Stebloke (stebloke.co.uk) \r<br />\r<br />For all the Resident Evil playthroughs on Youtube:\r<br />- Mike Bettencourt \r<br />- ThePsOne\r<br />- Smallvillecs\r<br />- CobRikHC\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />JP&#39;TR\r<br />",
