  "descriptionHtml": "Enhanced Dawnguard faction armor. All textures 2x vanilla. \r\nI was playing Dawnguard when I realized the armors, while awesome, were rather low res, so I quick hopped in photoshop and after a few hours this is what I designed. Note: I have no experience with normal maps so I did my best to enhance the armors with what I had and the result is decent if I do say so myself. \r\nI hope you enjoy and endorse. A big thanks to Bethesda for making one awesome expansion, can\\'t wait for the next! As always: keep playing Skyrim!\r\nDon\\'t forget to post screenshots!\r\nMy page and other mods: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/931897\r\n",
