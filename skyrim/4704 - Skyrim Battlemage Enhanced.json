  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i1229.photobucket.com/albums/ee471/edwardvlad/b_enhanced.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nv 0.3 = Added Necromancer Robes\r\nv 0.2 = Fixed folder problem.\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n(This is my first mod ever and [b]I\\'M STILL WORKING ON IT[/b])\r\n\r\nFirst of all sorry for my english.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this mod is to add a more rugged and protective look to the mage robes of Skyrim. I loved since the first time the appereance of the mage robes, but I also love to play as a battlemage, so I edited the textures of the robes, adding chainmail parts, studded leather parts and a lot of minors details for a complessive badass look. \r\nFor now the textures replace the old robes, but when the CK will come out I\\'ll add them separately.\r\n\r\nFor now I\\'ve finished:\r\nBeginner Mage Robes\r\nApprentice Mage Robes\r\nSpecialist Mage Robes\r\nJourneyman Mage Robes\r\nExpert Mage Robes\r\nArchamage Robe\r\n\r\nMy aim is to edit and enhance pretty much all the mage robes of the game (Like the necromancer ones etc).\r\nI will also make mods of this type for other things (For example, I\\'ll surely make an overhaul for the Stormcloaks armors, probably for the Imperials too, the Guards armors etc.)\r\n\r\n[b]Important[/b]: I\\'m also looking for someone good in editing meshes for when the CK will come out. So please, if you are good in modelling/editing meshes and if you are interested in collaborate to my project, please contact me!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\nCopy the Data folder to your \\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\" folder.\r\n\r\n[b]Uninstallation[/b]\r\nDelete the folders \\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\clothes\\\\archmage\\\", \\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\clothes\\\\mageapprentice\\\" and \\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\clothes\\\\magejourneyman\\\"\r\n\r\n",
