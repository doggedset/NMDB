  "modName": "Gyldenhul Dragonborn Mining Fix",
  "summary": "This mod restores the default mining script to a particular vein of Stalhrim in Gyldenhul Barrow in eastern Solstheim.  ",
  "descriptionHtml": "I like mining and crafting.  I personally hated it that NPC\\'s could bang away at the same ore vein every day all day long but when I stepped in I would exhaust the vein.  So I got a mod that edits the mining script to allow me to mine all day if I wanted to.  I loved it.  However, when I began playing Dragonborn, I discovered that my favorite mining mod was keeping me from completing a cool quest!  This small mod fixes the Deathbrand Quest breaking bug created by mods that adjust the global mining script.  \r\n\r\nYou still need the required Unique Pickaxe to mine Stahlrim, I have not edited that.\r\n\r\nIf you are using: \r\nIndefinite Mining\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9215\r\nMore and Indefinite Mining\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14267\r\nNon Stop Mining and Choping\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23770\r\nUnlimited Woodwork and Mining\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9486\r\nRP Chopping and Mining\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18336\r\n\r\nOr any other mod that prevents Ore veins from being exhausted you will be unable to complete the Deathbrand quest as a vein of Stalhrim is blocking your path and must be mined out.  This mod restores the vanilla mining script to that one vein of Stalhrim in the game and should be compatible with most other mods.  If for some reason you aren\\'t using a mod that modifies the global mining script... Move along, nothing to see here... ;)\r\n",
