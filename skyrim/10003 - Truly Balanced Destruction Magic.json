  "descriptionHtml": "This mod balances the Destruction magic system.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever played as a mage you will find that your spells quickly become underpowered. While on the other hand the \\\"Impact\\\" perk is overpowered and lets you juggle your enemies to death without the need for real skill. (I won\\'t be changing dual casting, people complain it doesn\\'t improve the damage of spells, but it allows you to use the \\\"Impact\\\" perk which is more than enough. Increasing the damage to cost ratio would be overpowered.)\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nImpact stagger chance poll! Even though update 4 is out, I will still take poll results for future updates: http://www.yourfreepoll.com/uwtjmmdjsp.html (It says 66% is the current value, but it\\'s not, it\\'s 60% now)\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUPDATE4: Most importantly first, I fixed this mod from affecting enchantments! No longer will enchanted weapons be rape-overpowered. Upgraded the impact chance to 60% from 50%, because poll is between 50% and 66%. Removed the damage addition of [Destruction level] * 0.1 to make up for up\\'d impact chance (also the spells don\\'t need to be any more powerful than what the original multiplyer does).\r\n\r\nUPDATE3: Minor fixes\r\n\r\nUPDATE2: Changed impact chance from 66% to 50%, due to poll results. \\\"[Level] Destruction\\\" perk % increases only affect the level of skill (Novice Destruction only affects only Novice spells, not all spells). Changed \\\"[Level] Destruction\\\" perk multipliers.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n- Spell damage is now multiplied by your Destruction level divided by 100, plus 1. (ex. Level 69 = 1.69)\r\n\r\n- Stagger chance of the \\\"Impact\\\" perk is decreased from 100% to 50% to prevent juggling.\r\n\r\n- All the \\\"[Level] Destruction\\\" perks now multiply damage. (In addition to their existing effect of decreasing magicka cost by 1/2 for each level.):\r\n\r\n\tNovice Destruction - Changes 1 and 2 come into effect (Above ^) Novice Spell damage increased by 5%\r\n\tApprentice Destruction - Apprentice Spell damage increased by 4%\r\n\tAdept Destruction - Adept Spell damage increased by 3%\r\n\tExpert Destruction - Expert Spell damage increased by 2%\r\n\tMaster Destruction - Master Spell damage increased by 1%\r\n\r\nFor example, say you are level 69, with the \\\"Apprentice Destruction\\\" perk casting Firebolt. (Firebolt\\'s base damage is 25). Here is the formula:\r\n\r\n25*1.69*1.04 = 43 (Skyrim will always round downwards)\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFor those who believe this mod is overpowered or underpowered, just change your game difficulty. For a reference, I play on expert.\r\n\r\nIf you unsubscribe, please tell me why so I can continue to improve this mod.\r\nPlease rate, comment and leave suggestions.",
