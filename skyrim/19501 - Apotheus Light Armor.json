  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=yellow]I have decided to retire from creating armors for now. As sad as it is for me, since I pretty much went to a lot of trouble trying to learn 3D modeling, nifskope, diffuse/UV texturing, exporting, importing and compressing stuff in the right format as well as a little bit of CK and everything else to make this and Heavy Blooded Armor possible..... I have gone through a huge obstacle in my career recently that has left me with a bruised morale and a bleak view of my future.\r<br />\r<br />For now I have to focus on real life and getting myself back on my feet leaving this behind, with version 1.5 of Heavy Blooded Armor as my parting gift. Who knows, maybe when TES6 comes out I might give it another whirl if I make it out of my current rut. \r<br />\r<br />ANYWAY, HENCEFORTH I AM NO LONGER SUPPORTING THIS MOD AND I AM GIVING MY PERMISSION TO ANYONE WHO WISHES TO USE MY RESOURCES FOR ANY MOD OR PURPOSE, PROVIDED YOU GIVE ME PROPER CREDIT AND LINK THEM HERE. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE SUPPORT AND FAREWELL.\r<br />[/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />[b]========================================================================[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Most of the details of the recent and final changes can be seen on the CHANGE LOG. But the MOST IMPORTANT change I need to single out is the SEPARATION OF FILES. The reason for the ESP, MESHES, and TEXTURES being separate now is for the convenience of those who are using hothtrooper44&#39;s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19733]Immersive Armors[/url] which includes my armor. The separation of the Textures is also for those who&#39;d like to choose a color scheme of their preference. I&#39;ll be uploading the new layered PSD files as well for those with a proficiency in Photoshop and wish to make their own color scheme of my armor.\r<br />\r<br />IF YOU ARE USING IMMERSIVE ARMORS, you don&#39;t have to download my ESP file to get my update. Simply download my meshes and textures, being loose files, mine will load in game instead of the ones in his BSA, thus updating my armor in his mod. Although my recent download of IA shows that he wasn&#39;t able to make any collisions for the boots nor has he set it to have a different item with collisions in his ESP, so dropping the Apotheus Boots item in the game world would mean losing it. Might be too minor for him to make an update. But I&#39;ll try talking to him about it, or I could make an esp that fixes that in his esp, but that just adds to the load list.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]rIYex4INId0[/youtube][youtube]sf3BINEv0Ds[/youtube][youtube]aWMEgtFJ8wI[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1074.photobucket.com/albums/w414/GuitunScarfin/FRVN_logo_32x32.gif[/IMG][b]DESCRIPTION[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Most will probably know Ulag as just another Skooma sipping Orc, But Eorland once knew him  as one of the finest although dissapointing blacksmiths he ever knew. An Orc, who through his Skooma induced epiphanies, was able to create a light armor made from the finest Sleeping Tree Sap processed leather and a helm of the lightest steel achieved by repeatedly heating and cooling with fire and frost salts. This is an armor created during an Orc&#39;s raised mental state (He was High). \r<br />\r<br />Cuirass armor textures are divided into 3\r<br />&gt; Armor - 2048x2048\r<br />&gt; Gambeson - 2048x2048\r<br />&gt; Scarf - 1024x1024\r<br />\r<br />Helm - 1024x1024\r<br />Gloves - 1024x1024\r<br />Boots - 1024x1024\r<br />\r<br />Base Armor Rating Details as of v1.2 :\r<br />\r<br />Helm - 17\r<br />Hood - 1\r<br />Scarf - 1\r<br />Cuirass - 38\r<br />Gloves - 10\r<br />Boots - 10\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Armor]Check UESP for comparison[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1074.photobucket.com/albums/w414/GuitunScarfin/FRVN_logo_32x32.gif[/IMG][b]HOW TO OBTAIN[/b]\r<br />\r<br />It can be found in a knapsack next to Ulag&#39;s dead body in the SLeeping Tree Cave, along with his Journal that I made with my own story for the poor fellow.\r<br />\r<br />It can be forged at the Skyforge, and tempered as long as you have [b]Ulag&#39;s Journal[/b] in your inventory (Dragon smithing perk not necessary for crafting anymore, but Arcane smithing perk needed for tempering).\r<br />\r<br />Helmet, Cuirass, Gloves and Boots can be found in the Dragon category, Hood and Scarf can be found in the Miscellaneous category.\r<br />\r<br />Items needed for Crafting and Tempering are leathers, leather strips, steel ingot, and the most important of all Sleeping Tree Sap. (linen wraps for the scarf and hood) \r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1074.photobucket.com/albums/w414/GuitunScarfin/FRVN_logo_32x32.gif[/IMG][b]INSTALLATION[/b]\r<br />\r<br />- ESP, MESHES, and TEXTURES download files are now separate from each other. Makes it more efficient for me. And convenient for those prefering to choose a different color scheme and users of hothtrooper44&#39;s Immersive Armors\r<br />\r<br />- Just download the ESP, then the MESHES and choose one of the TEXTURES of your choice.\r<br />\r<br />- Using the Nexus Mod Manager. After downloading the ESP and activating it, downloading and activating the MESHES and one of the TEXTURES will prompt you on whether to update the mod. Choose &#34;No&#34; on both instances to Install normally. Otherwise you&#39;d end up deactivating one or more of the three. \r<br />\r<br />- or Simply extract the Data folder from each of the 3 into the Skyrim folder, so the .esp, textures folder, and meshes folder all land into your skyrim/data directory.\r<br />\r<br />Typically:\r<br />\r<br />C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim\r<br />or\r<br />C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1074.photobucket.com/albums/w414/GuitunScarfin/FRVN_logo_32x32.gif[/IMG][b]CREDITS[/b]\r<br />\r<br />YmntleStock: for the leather texture\r<br />http://ymntlestock.deviantart.com/art/Leather-Texture-177630392\r<br />\r<br />This forum for the Gambeson Texture\r<br />http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?topic=20178.26385\r<br />\r<br />Earth Song Ceramic Tiles: for Celtic Engravings on the belt buckles, and brooch\r<br />http://earthsongtiles.com/celtic_tiles.html\r<br />\r<br />[b]Ujdnes: for the name[/b]\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/4217075\r<br />\r<br />AND BETHESDA FOR THE AWESOME GAME&#33;&#33;&#33; (even though its riddled with bugs)\r<br />\r<br />==============================================================================\r<br />==============================================================================\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1074.photobucket.com/albums/w414/GuitunScarfin/FRVN_logo_32x32.gif[/IMG][b]PERSONAL THOUGHTS ON PROGRESS[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]27 JUN 2012[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Hi,\r<br />\r<br />This is so far my 2nd attempt at creating an armor mod. My 1st one was just a retexture and recycled meshes from other modders, via learning to use nifskope. \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16862]Dragonborn Light Armor[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Im basically a comic book illustrator in real life, and ever since my hobby became my profession, I needed a new hobby, yet still in the creative field. This game just opens up so many possibilities, I&#39;m really fond of designing armors, and really want true customization when it comes to RPG&#39;s, I decided to teach myself Blender. Its a bumpy and frustrating ride specially with getting the weights right.\r<br />\r<br />This is mostly made from scratch, except for the scarf, which is a tweaked version of the Warlock hood, and the gloves also tweaked and improved the Nightingale gauntles.\r<br />\r<br />Its currently for males only, I&#39;ve adjusted the helm to fit Khajiits and orcs and redid the mesh for the argonian head. Had to Cut the nosegaurd part for the argonian helm, cause the snout clips with the nosegaurd when its height is set high, and it looks ugly when the snout/nose is set low, so just avoid getting your snout cut off.\r<br />\r<br />The textures were really fun, and normals are a real boon, best way to cheat adding details to the mesh. Details like side stitchng and even a fly if your willing to look under the flap ;D I&#39;ve uploaded my layered PSD files for those customization freaks like me (e.g. changing color schemes, adding war paints, emblems, etc.) just don&#39;t forget to credit me if you decide to upload complete overhaul retextures.\r<br />\r<br />This has been a learning experience, both draining and fun.",
