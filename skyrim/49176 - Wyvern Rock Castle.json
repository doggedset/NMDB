  "descriptionHtml": "Wyvern Rock is a large castle located on the mountain between Whiterun and Windhelm. \n<br />Many rumours claim the first owner had built secret rooms to hide treasure, can you find them all? \n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19168/]The Skyrim Special Edition version of Wyvern Rock is here![/url] It also has some nice improvements to bugs, adds a quest and also a treasury.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This castle is more like a town than an actual house, so it will likely take some time before you can find everything. \n<br />All the different passages will keep you exploring for quite a long time, but the layout is also optimized for quick navigation once you get to know it. \n<br />\n<br />[youtube]lelzlxlkUwE[/youtube]\n<br />=================\n<br />\n<br />Features\n<br />\n<br />- Large fully detailed and navmeshed player home. \n<br />\n<br />- Quest to find all secret passages in the castle, when you find one, look for similar switches if you struggle to find them.\n<br />\n<br />- Optional Hearthfire plugin that adds a childrens room for up to 6 adopted children.\n<br />\n<br />- Guards, 7 unique NPCs, several of which are merchants and one a follower.\n<br />\n<br />- Entrance hall, throneroom, armory, enchanting office, alchemy dungeon, multiple bedrooms, library, servants quarters, kitchen, dining rooms, chapel, treasury and stables.\n<br />\n<br />- Room with beds for 6 followers\n<br />\n<br />- Secret passages, hidden doors and treasure chests which can be used as player storage.\n<br />\n<br />- 26 mannequins, 18 weapon plaques, 21 weapon racks and bookshelves spread throughout the castle \n<br />\n<br />- 3 alchemy workbenches, 2 enchanting workbenches \n<br />\n<br />- 1 forge, 2 armorers workbenches, 1 ore smelter and 3 tanning racks \n<br />\n<br />- Christmas decoration that can be turned on or off by talking to Anselt\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=================\n<br />\n<br />-- Traveling to Wyvern Rock -- \n<br />\n<br />There should already be an undiscovered map marker, which is located close to the dwemer ruin of Raldbthar, The dragon wall called Shearpoint and north of the bridge at Valtheim Towers. \n<br />The easiest route is to fast travel to Raldbthar and follow the path on your righthand (west) side.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=================\n<br />\n<br />-- How to get access to the castle -- \n<br />\n<br />When starting the game you should receive and read a letter from Anselt. \n<br />\n<br />Then talk to Anselt, in the Entrance hall of wyvern rock. The doors to most of the castle will be locked before completing the quest\n<br />\n<br />-IMPORTANT- IF Anselt does not say anything, make a quicksave and reload that save by pressing F5 and then F9.\n<br />\n<br />If you are Arch Mage of the College of Winterhold the castle will be free of charge. \n<br />If you are not the Arch mage you can buy the castle for 30000 gold or wait until you do become Arch Mage. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=================\n<br />\n<br />--Story-- \n<br />\n<br />The mountain ridge currently named Wyvern Rock used to be the primary hunting ground for several large packs of Wyverns throughout the 3rd era. The mountain provided them with height and additionally featured a series of large caves suitable for nesting and shelter. \n<br />The Wyverns in their turn attracted the interest of a wise and competent sorcerer known as Rhes The Exalted. Highly skilled in enchanting and conjuration, he is considered to be an expert on rare and magical animals and was former Arch Mage at the College of Winterhold. He has also written several bestiaries on all sorts of animals and monsters residing in Tamriel. \n<br />Rhes became so fascinated by the wyverns that he decided studying them would be his lifework. He required a location close by to study from and decided to build it on top of the Wyvern Rock. A castle was constructed partly above a collapsed wyvern nesting cave and partly upon the ruined foundation of the old fortress. \n<br />For a long time it remained a custom to welcome qualified Arch Mages to Wyvern Rock Castle. There have been some periods without an Arch Mage residing there, and now is one of them. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=================\n<br />\n<br />--Requirements and Recommendations-- \n<br />\n<br />The main Wyvern Rock castle requires NO dlc content, just the latest version of Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />The Wyvern Rock Hearthfire plugin requires the Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions mod  which can be found here:\n<br />To have your spouse move into this home use the same mod.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249[/url]﻿ by TMPhoenix\n<br />\n<br />If you want multiple followers to stay here you can download this mod. \n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045/][color=#57a5cc]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045/[/color][/url] by Volek\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=================\n<br />\n<br />--Load Order--\n<br />\n<br />When using WyvernRockHearthfire.esp, make sure the esp files are in this dependency order for everything to work correctly.\n<br />Higher: HearthfireMultiKid.esp\n<br />Lower: Wyvernrock.esp\n<br />Lower: WyvernrockHearthfire.esp\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=================\n<br />\n<br />--Troubleshooting-- \n<br />\n<br />If Anselt does not say anything, reload the autosave from entering the castle or save your game and reload it. \n<br />\n<br />If Meshes on the exterior are missing, try fast traveling somewhere else and come back\n<br />\n<br />The Armory can be entered from the Throneroom by two different doors. (use your local map to find the door markers)\n<br />\n<br />Secret passages are well hidden but you can try looking for activators such as handles.\n<br />\n<br />All but one secret passages have switches on both sides of the door. There is one exception in the throneroom.\n<br />\n<br />--Troubleshooting and Installing Hearthfire --\n<br />\n<br />The Hearthfire plugin for Wyvern Rock requires the ''Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions'' mod by TMPhoenix before it can be recognized as a family home.\n<br />A link to this mod is above in the 'Requirements' section.\n<br />\n<br />Q: My adopted children won't give the option of moving to Wyvern Rock!\n<br />A: If you have not adopted any children in Skyrim before, I highly recommend installing the Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions mod BEFORE adopting any children.\n<br />\n<br />If you already had a savegame with adopted children prior to installing Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions I advise you to read the troubleshooting section of the Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions mod here; http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=================\n<br />\n<br />--Version history-- \n<br />\n<br />Hearthfire V1.00: Added Hearthfire compatability by building a childrens room.\n<br />\n<br />V1.10 Added Skyrim Special Edition support.\n<br />   ﻿Added quest to find all secret passages\n<br />   ﻿Added Treasury\n<br />   ﻿Added Jail functionality\n<br />   ﻿Fixed opening quest not starting when talking to Anselt\n<br />   ﻿Fixed deleted exterior navmesh\n<br />   ﻿Fixed followers getting stuck behind one-way door\n<br />   ﻿Fixed various other bugs\n<br />\n<br />V1.05: Added bookshelves\n<br />   Added two servant NPCs and one priest NPC   \n<br />   Added many more activity markers for NPCs\n<br />   Added more chairs around dinner table for adopted children/followers\n<br />   Added time dependant lighting for interiors\n<br />   Added more handles for some secret passages\n<br />   Added atmospheric sounds\n<br />   Added other small improvements\n<br />   Fixed guard patrolling through bedroom\n<br />   Fixed spouse compatability and bed\n<br />   Fixed numerous other bugs\n<br />\n<br />V1.03: Fixed door issue when players already completed the quest\n<br />\n<br />V1.02:  Added NPCs and guards plus custom shields.\n<br />   Made Switch for christmas decoration.\n<br />   Added bedroom for followers.\n<br />   Made Main bedroom and armory easier to find.\n<br />   Fixed intro quest.\n<br />   Fixed issue where followers didn't follow you into the castle.\n<br />   Fixed various other bugs and activators.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />V1.01: Fixed the introduction quest.\n<br />\n<br />V1.0:  Initial release.\n<br />\n<br />=================\n<br />\n<br />--Credits-- \n<br />\n<br />Mod created by Lucas Bolt \n<br />\n<br />Thanks to my very patient girlfriend! \n<br />Thanks to Bethesda Softworks for creating Skyrim and releasing the tools to create our own worlds!",
