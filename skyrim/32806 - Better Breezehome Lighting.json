  "summary": "Makes Breezehome feel warmer by adding lights of an orange color rather than white lights.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Makes Breezehome feel like it\\'s being lit by actual flames rather than fluorescent lights. All the white lights are removed and replaced with orange ones. Added enchanting table as well because it needed one. Enjoy! \r\n\r\nA few of the pictures I took were over the MAX size limit so I\\'ll have to retake them when I get a chance. The ones I uploaded weren\\'t. If you enjoy this mod please give me feedback on what I could change and what-not. Thanks!\r\n\r\n(No lighting mods such as ENB were used in any of the pictures)",
