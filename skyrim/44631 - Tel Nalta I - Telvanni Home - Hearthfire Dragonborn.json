They also keep themselves busy with chores during the day and sleep at night.\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/44631-1-1430401851.png[/img]\n<br

/>[color=ORANGE][b]~~~~~~Features:~~~~~~~~~~~[/b][/color]\n<br />* [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44631/?tab=forum&amp;topic_id=2073134]HD Telvanni Robes[/url][/b] -- six different colors for these robes, buy enchanted ones from the wizard and unenchanted ones from the servant.\n<br />* [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44631/?tab=forum&amp;topic_id=2243894]New Conjuration Creatures[/url][/b] -- 8 new conjuration spells that you buy from the wizard.\n<br />* [b]Grow and Build[/b] -- it is up to the player to construct everything and hire the NPCs, the first thing you need to do is [b]grow[/b] certain buildings and then use the work bench to [b]build[/b] the interiors, take a look at the video tutorial or the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44631/?tab=forum&amp;topic_id=2148199]forum tutorial[/url].\n<br />There is a cheat version where all materials are included in a chest which is located on top of the construction bench on the island, use this version if you don't feel like gathering all the resources required to build the town.\n<br />* [b]Player Tower[/b] -- your personal home where you can store all your items.\n<br />* [b]Household[/b] -- home for your spouse and children, also safe to store items.\n<br />* [b]Aquifer[/b] -- an underground exotic hot springs lake for NPCs to relax, NPCs will take off/on clothing when entering/exiting.\n<br />* [b]Consilium Tower[/b] -- big secondary tower for the NPCs that includes an Apothecary Shop, a Garden where you can grow plants, a Kitchen area, Library area and a Temple area where you and NPCs can pray to all the Divines.\n<br />* [b]General Stores[/b] -- shop dealing in general goods.\n<br />* [b]Blacksmith[/b] -- shop dealing in weapons and armor.\n<br />* [b]NPCs[/b] -- a merchant, blacksmith, alchemist, farmer, chef, wizard, servant and 3 guards.\n<br />* [b]Improved Navmesh[/b] -- all added content has been provided with new navmeshes, NPCs follow wherever you go.\n<br />\n<br />[color=ORANGE][b]~~~~~~Installation:~~~~~~~~~~[/b][/color]\n<br />* Always make back-up saves before trying new mods.\n<br />* Make sure you are far away from Lake Ilinalta before installing.\n<br />* Nexus Mod Manager: download the .ESP and .BSA files and activate it to install.\n<br />* Manual: open the 7zip file, then drag and drop the .ESP and .BSA files into Skyrim's Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[color=ORANGE][b]~~~~~~Uninstallation:~~~~~~~~[/b][/color]\n<br />* Dismiss all potential followers from my mod, make sure none of them are actively following you.\n<br />* Make sure you are far away from Lake Ilinalta before uninstalling, wait 40+ days.\n<br />* You can deactivate and uninstall from Nexus Mod Manager, or manually delete the mod.\n<br />\n<br />[color=ORANGE][b]~~~~~~Glitches:~~~~~~~~~~~~[/b][/color]\n<br />* There are several small glitches that can be remedied by waiting 40+ days far away from the Tel Nalta location so that the exterior can reset itself, it is recommended to do this once every building has been grown, every interior has been build and all npcs are activated.\n<br />* [url=https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Floating_Grass_Fix]Floating Grass Fix[/url] -- also try waiting a few days far away from the town so it can reset and the grass doesn't float anymore.\n<br />\n<br />[color=ORANGE][b]~~~~~~Issues:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/b][/color]\n<br />Some people may experience lag and drop in FPS, so I suggest you make the following changes to your .ini files:\n<br />Add/change this to your Skyrim.ini\n<br />\n<br />[MapMenu]\n<br />sMapCloudNIF=0\n<br />bWorldMapNoSkyDepthBlur=1\n<br />fWorldMapNearDepthBlurScale=0\n<br />fWorldMapDepthBlurScale=0\n<br />fWorldMapMaximumDepthBlur=0\n<br />fMapWorldYawRange=3600.0000\n<br />fMapWorldMaxHeight=130000.0000\n<br />fMapWorldMinHeight=5000.0000\n<br />\n<br />(these changes will alter how you view the map in-game)\n<br />\n<br />Also add/change this to your SkyrimPrefs.ini\n<br />\n<br />[Display]\n<br />fMeshLODFadePercentDefault=1.2000\n<br />fMeshLODFadeBoundDefault=256.0000\n<br />fMeshLODLevel2FadeTreeDistance=2048.0000\n<br />fMeshLODLevel1FadeTreeDistance=2844.0000\n<br />fMeshLODLevel2FadeDist=3072.0000\n<br />fMeshLODLevel1FadeDist=4096.0000\n<br />\n<br />(these changes will alter how soon certain objects like plants will show up in front of you in-game, normally everything loads with the standard settings but this causes a lot of lag, with these changes most things too far away from your character will stop rendering and fade out, I highly suggest you use these settings!)\n<br />\n<br

again.\n<br />* [size=2]If you need to wait 40+ days then I suggest you open the console and type \"set timescale to 300000\", close the console and then do nothing for like 30 seconds, when done type \"set timescale to 20\".[/size][size=2][size=2](its preferred you do this in an interior with no npcs, like Breezehome.)[/size][/size]\n<br />* To [b]decorate your home[/b], dump items on the ground, exit home, re-enter home, place them where you like.\n<br />* If you don't like certain items/plants/trees, you can always open the console in game, select the item, type \"disable\" or \"markfordelete\" to remove it.\n<br />When using markfordelete you need to save and load again, but beware that the item will be gone forever, and make sure you have a backup save ready in case you deleted the wrong item.\n<br />You can also use these commands to make your manor interior better by removing clutter items you otherwise cannot pick up.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br
