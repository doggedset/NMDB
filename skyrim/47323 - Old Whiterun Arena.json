  "descriptionHtml": "The Old Whiterun Arena is a fully functional roman style arena. I really wanted a place where i could do gladiatorial kind of fights and spawn ennemies to fight at will so thats what I did and I created this mod. It's main purpose is to be fun, there is no quest associated to the arena and the details could be more developped but a lot of time as been put into this (I had to learn how to use the creation kit decently) so I really hope you enjoy. Have fun! \r\n\r\nFeatures: \r\n\r\n- Ennemies that you can spawn at will with the pull chains \r\n- Map Marker \r\n- Violence \r\n\r\nAt the right of the door (when facing it) the chains spawn wolfs, giants, smilodons and bears, At the left of the door, you can spawn three different gladiators, prisoners and bandits. \r\n\r\nWill be added soon: \r\n\r\n- Gladiator follower in the cage \r\n- More details \r\n- A crowd in the stands \r\n- Tents and merchants outside \r\n\r\nFeel free to leave comments if you have ideas to improve the arena or report bugs, conflicts with other mods, etc. \r\n\r\nKnown bug: \r\n\r\n- Sometimes when you spawn a few opponents one of them spawns in the wall. \r\n\r\nMods in the screenshots: \r\n\r\n- Spartacus gladiator armor \r\n- Gannicus armor \r\n- Bandanas of skyrim \r\n- Enhanced blood texture \r\n- Duel combat realism 7 \r\n- Better combat AI \r\n- Spartan scimitar and Spartan aspis \r\n- Roman Era (armor and weapons replacer) \r\n\r\nThis mod aims to recreate the feelings of gladiator fights in an arena and is made for fun. Please be constructive in your comments and i will read them \r\n\r\n**The number of opponents you spawn equals the number of times you activate the chain, not the number of times it moves.",
