  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Tel Mithryn Player Home\r<br />Version: 1.1\r<br />Date: 10/02/2013\r<br />Category: Buildings\r<br />Author: Princess Stomper\r<br />Source: Nexus/Steam\r<br />Requires: Skyrim, Dragonborn\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Description:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Adds a player house to Tel Mithryn in the Telvanni style of the main tower, called Ruhn Mithryn (&#34;Ruhn&#34; is Dunmeri for &#34;home&#34;). Access is via a new entrance attached to the main tower itself, to the rear (overlooking the sea).\r<br />\r<br />**IF USING A COMPANION, PLEASE USE THE MAGIC-BOTTLE-DOOR OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE. Companions won&#39;t use the regular door and levitation lift**\r<br />\r<br />Accommodation comprises:\r<br />- Two bedrooms (one double, one single)\r<br />- Extra sleeping area \r<br />- Bathroom\r<br />- Kitchen/dining area\r<br />- Study-lounge\r<br />- Alchemy/enchanting area\r<br />- Combat/crafting area \r<br />\r<br />Points to note:\r<br />\r<br />1: what looks like a staff enchanter is actually a forge, disguised for aesthetic reasons. I didn&#39;t include a staff enchanter because there&#39;s one next door\r<br />\r<br />2: The pre-filled shelves are set up as containers for extra storage\r<br />\r<br />3: One of the mannequins doesn&#39;t always work. I have no idea why, so best to regard the one on the left as decoration and use the one on the right for storing armor. \r<br />\r<br />4: Occasionally players report not being able to use levitation. Apparently uninstalling/reinstalling the mod will fix it, or unchecking FNIS.\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Installation\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />1) Extract the contents of the ZIP folder into your Data folder\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Un-Installation:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />1) De-activate the .esp file\r<br />2) Delete the files/folders associated with the mod\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Contact:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />[see readme]\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Credits:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r<br />InsanitySorrow - Pillows, bath, towel\r<br />Lilith - filled cupboards, shelves, basin (using resources by InsanitySorrow)\r<br />Runspect - toilet\r<br />Korana - inspiration\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Licensing/Legal:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />You may use this as you wish as long as you don&#39;t charge money for it and you credit me for any work used.
