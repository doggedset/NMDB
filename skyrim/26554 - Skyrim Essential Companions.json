SEC or Skyrim Essential Companions, is a constant WIP compilation of all of the best and most immersive companion mods available on either Steam and the Nexus.  Some time ago we noticed that while there are truly fantastic compilations out there already, there were none to be found that dealt specifically with companions, which is a field of Skyrim we believe important enough to rate its own space.  Seeing this as a problem we at the SEC team immediately set out to rectify it and attacked the lists of companion mods as if they were..well something which should be attacked.  It is with great pride that we now present to you our first list of carefully selected \\\"game play essential\\\" companion mods.  Finally as was mentioned above this is a WIP so if anyone knows of any notable companion mods which we have missed than please do not hesitate to leave a comment or message our board master directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o718/agonydrum/RRCohenLetterFixed.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1339.photobucket.com/albums/o718/agonydrum/SECtitle2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nA big thanks to not only the modders on this list but to all modders everywhere, your work is always appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20787]Cerwiden-SMART Healer[/url]\r\n-A fully voiced, fully AI configurable companion designed to fit any play style!
