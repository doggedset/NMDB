This mod completely doubles the amount of unique skill books in the game from 90 to 180. These new books have been distributed around the skyrim universe. Some books you can get from the library in the College of Winterhold. These skill books are more rare and more valuable than the original skill books but they are tons of fun to collect if your a hoarder of everything like me :P All books in this mod are LORE FRIENDLY AND HAVE TEXT! This mod shouldn\\'t conflict with any other mods.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 5/8/13: The update to add 18 more skill books to the total list has been tough and it came with a lot of setbacks. In an attempt to make to link all the 18 books together in a questline, I realized that I didn\\'t have the scripting knowledge necessary to make a questline. I\\'ve never messed with skyrim\\'s scripting language before )or their quest system for that matter). After a couple days of trying to learn how to even make the stupid quest start by reading a note, I decided to scrap the whole quest idea entirely. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that the quest  system would just get rid of the fun of exploring to try to find all the books in the series. I should have V2 of my mod by the end if this week or the beginning of the next week. I\\'ve also talked to the author of Book Covers Skyrim (great retexture mod by the way!) and asked him if he was interested in making a retexture patch for my mod. He said that he might later on in time. For anyone who hasn\\'t noticed, V1.1 is out for my mod and I also released a text document containing a list of all books and their locations. I hope you all are enjoying my mod (: -link to Book Covers Skyrim (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35399/?)\r\n\r\nUPDATE 4/22/13: As summer break comes closer and closer, I will have a lot more time to dedicate to this mod. I almost have 100 endorsements (99 as of now) I feel like a mini celebration is in order. I know 100 endorsements isn\\'t a lot at all but it\\'s enough to think about working on more skill books. I am also working on a text file that lists every book my mod adds, how many copies exist in the game, and where these copies can be found. I shall have the database done in 1 to 2 days and a series of 18 new skill books sometime next week. Il also be fixing existing books with punctuation errors because it breaks immersion immensely. Il should have this all done by next week. Thank you so much for all the good feedback and I hope you enjoy finding my books. (:",
