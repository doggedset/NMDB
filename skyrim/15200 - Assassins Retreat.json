  "descriptionHtml": "=====ASSASSIN\\'S RETREAT=====\r\n\r\n-Description-\r\n        I made this mod so I can have my cosy, compact, but useful little cave for my early-game characters. I then decided to share this to the world. It\\'s my third project I\\'ve done with the Creation Kit, however the first one I posted to the Nexus.\r\n\r\n-Location-\r\n       It is located close to Riverwood, blended into a mountain. If you look right on the road from Helgen to Riverwood you should see a small wooden door with a litlle roof and a torch nearby. It has a map marker, so it shouldn\\'t be too hard to find.\r\n\r\n-Content-\r\n       While I wanted to make it efficient, but primitive, I did not add any bookshelves, weapon racks or manequins, however there are alot of things available.\r\n\r\n-Bed\r\n-Alchemy Table\r\n-Enchanting Table\r\n-Cooking Spot\r\n-Smithing Area (all exept Smelter)\r\n-World Map\r\n-Ingredient Farm\r\n-Lots of Storage (1 End Table, 1 Dresser, 2 Strongboxes, 2 Chests, 1 Sathcel, 1 Urn)\r\n\r\n-Instalation-\r\n      Place the file in Skyrim/Data folder, and enable it in the Launchers Data Files or just use the NMM (Nexus Mod Manager). To uninstall simply delete the file.\r\n",
