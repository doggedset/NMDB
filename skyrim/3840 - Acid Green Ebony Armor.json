  "summary": "An update from my Red Ebony mod - created on request.[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2593]Red Ebony[/url]",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=deeppink]=====DESCRIPTION=====\r\n\r\nThis mod is a texture replacer for the trim on Ebony Armor; originally a dull grey I have changed it to an acid green - see pictures. As with most of my mods, I acknowledge the simplicity of this retexture, however, I made such a mod for Oblivion and wanted to re-create it for this most epic and hallowed of games.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=Chartreuse]=====INSTALLING=====\r\n\r\nNOTE: You can download it with the Nexus Mod Manager if you so choose, and there will be no need for installation.\r\n\r\nI have chosen not to include a ReadMe with this mod, as it is a very simple texture replacement. Please take a few seconds here to read up on the process. Once you have downloaded and extracted the mod, simply place the folder named \\\"textures\\\" into your Skyrim \\\"Data\\\" folder. For most of you, this will be: \r\n\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=DeepSkyBlue]=====UNINSTALLING=====\r\n\r\nTo uninstall this texture replacer, simply enter the \\\"Data\\\" folder in your Skyrim directory, then enter \\\"textures\\\" and \\\"armor\\\" then delete the folder named \\\"ebony\\\". Please remember to leave constructive feedback on un-installation.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]=====PLEASE NOTE=====\r\n\r\nThis mod [i]replaces[/i] the texture of male Ebony Armor so - as long as this mod is installed - you will not encounter an original version.\r\n\r\nPlease remember to comment with ideas and criticisms! \r\nNow, download, install, and enjoy!
