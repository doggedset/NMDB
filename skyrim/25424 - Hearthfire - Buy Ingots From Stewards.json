  "descriptionHtml": "The Hearthfire DLC depleted my huge stock of Iron and Corundum Ingots pretty fast, forcing me to embark on an adventure across Skyrim to find all the Iron Ore Veins and buy up the Iron and Corundum ingots and ore of every blacksmith in the province.\r\n\r\nFor those with less patience, there\\'s this mod, which allows you to have Iron and Corundum ingots delivered to your chest in batches of 20 and 10 respectively, by talking to your steward. It works exactly the same as buying stone or clay from them, and is designed to work with any Steward in the game.\r\n\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102357939]Also available on the Steam Workshop[/url]",
