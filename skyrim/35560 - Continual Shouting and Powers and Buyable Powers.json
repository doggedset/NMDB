There\\'s no cooldown on any shouts, or on any powers.\r\nBefore you could only use a power once a day. Not anymore!\r\nThere is a 2-3 seconds cooldown on the powers and the shouts.\r\nI know that this has already been done, and i\\'m not trying to steal anyones ideea. But I have a few more things included in this mod..\r\n[Line]\r\nWhen I became a Nightingale in skyrim by doing the Thievs Guild questline, I became disapointed. \r\nI could only have on power at a time? When all of them where so cool? \r\nI had to change this.\r\n[Line]\r\nSo in Whiteruns Dragonreach there is a wommen wandring around under the name of [i]Liz[/i].\r\nOf her, you can [b]buy[/b] all of the powers in game. All the racial powers aswell. You can even [b]buy[/b] the argonien lungs, so you can breath underwater. And the most expenive on must be the [b]Werewolf[/b] power, for they who are to lazy to do the companiens quest. All for a decent price of course. \r\nAnd in Tel Mithryn there is a wommen who is named [i]Susan[/i], she can sell you all the powers in solsteim! \r\nIf you think some of them are highly overprised, or the opposite. Please message me and I will look into it.\r\n\r\n[heading]All DLC supported![/heading]\r\nThis mod works for Skyrim, dawnguard and dragonborn. \r\nThey are standalone! So you will need all three files if you want all shouts and powers in all dlc\\'s to be without cooldown.\r\nIf you only want the Dawnguard shouts to be without cooldown, then only download that one.\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Skyrim - Contains the skyrim powers and shouts. With merchant.\r\n[*]Dawnguard - Contains all shouts of dawnguard. No merchant, cuz there\\'s no powers to be purchased.\r\n[*]Dragonborn - Contains all shouts of dragonborn.

But Nocturnal betrayed them all, even her parents. And became the Lady of Darknes. Liz & Susan is the only one who survived. The order and the family is no more. The Jarl of Whiterun took Liz and kept her safe. And she has been there ever since. Used here intence magcial properties to master the art of powers.\r\nBut they were splitted from eachother. So Susan went up getting to Tel Mithryn, with master Neloth. She has been with Neloth ever since, used her magical properties to examin the wierd powers comming from the Stones in Solsteim.\r\nWill they ever be reunited?..  \r\n[heading]Short info[/heading]\r\nOnly Liz can be your follower for now.
