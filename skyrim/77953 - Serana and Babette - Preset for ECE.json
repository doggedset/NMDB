  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\r<br />[color=#8e7cc3][size=4]BIOGRAPHY\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]Serana is an ancient pure-blood vampire and the daughter of Lord Harkon and Valerica. She is known as one of the &#34;Daughters of Coldharbour,&#34; and because of this she is central to the main questline in Dawnguard. After being encountered, she can be recruited as a follower, unlocking a multitude of interactions.  She is enterprising and friendly, but also lonely due to her troubled childhood and her mother&#39;s self-exile, which is why she confides in the Dragonborn. She harbors a degree of resentment towards her mother, Valerica for locking her away for centuries and is angry that her feelings weren&#39;t taken into consideration. As a child she was close with her mother, but once her parents began to fight, she felt trapped between both. Her mother would often feed her negative opinions of her father and after a time Serana began to believe them. She was never very close with her father Harkon before her family were vampires, but once they became followers of Molag Bal, it only worsened as her parents became drunk with power and were always in conflict. Her father started to see her as a means to an end and would often state &#34;Power takes precedence&#34;. Despite this she still admits to loving him as he is still her father. She feels trapped between the conflict that consumes her parents and sees herself as a pawn that they are using against each other. Deep down she wishes they were able to reconcile and become a family again, but realizes that it&#39;s not possible. When questioned about her vampirism, she can be defensive. She doesn&#39;t like to talk about the actual ceremony as it was degrading, but she doesn&#39;t seem to regret the power it has granted her, and rather sees it as a gift that she earned. The only regret she does seem to have is how it tore her family apart.\r<br />On the other hand, Babette is a Breton vampire and, as a member of the Dark Brotherhood, she also functions as a merchant of potions and ingredients, as well as being a master trainer of Alchemy. At the age of ten, Babette was bitten by a vampire, becoming one herself. She&#39;s lived over three hundred years as one, and boasts about how her innocent appearance makes killing easier. Due to her age, it can be inferred that she was alive during the Oblivion Crisis of 3E 433.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://s18.postimg.io/s46wuje89/image.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#d9d2e9][size=3]\r<br />Serana and Babette Slot 1 and 16[/size]\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6][size=3]For Racemenu users you can try to import the FaceGen\r<br />[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#b4a7d6][size=4][b]Requirements:\r<br />[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]SKSE[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://skse.silverlock.org/[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Enhanced Character Edit by ECE team [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12951/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]The Eyes Of Beauty by Gabriel Mailhot as LogRaam [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]ApachiiSkyHair by Apachii [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]SG Female Textures Renewal by Hello Santa [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35267/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]ECEE - RANs Enhanced Character Edit Enhancer by RAN46  [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35713/?\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#8e7cc3][size=4][b]Recommended (Optional):[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Amiella Outfit - UNP and UNPB by anano [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16424/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Amiella Outfit CBBEv3M by MAK [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16592/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Amiella - A 4K Retexture by betterbecause [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58211/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Caliente&#39;s Beautiful Bodies Edition -CBBE- by Ousnius and Caliente [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Real Girls Realistic Body Texture for UNP UNPB and SeveNBase - WIP by Zonzai and Seren4XX [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36425/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]SG Female Textures Renewal by Hello Santa [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35267/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]XP32 Maximum Skeleton - XPMS by xp32 [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26800/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b4a7d6][size=3]Download manually and extract the slot file to your Documents/My Games/Skyrim/CME_save[/size]\r<br />[size=3]Start Skyrim and go into the character creation menu. [/size]\r<br />[size=3]Load slot number, Slot 15. [/size]\r<br />[/color][/center]",
