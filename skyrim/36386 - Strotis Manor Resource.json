You can find the original resource files here:\r<br />http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/42793\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />A demo esp is included for a quick overview. I placed the manor near Heartwood Mill, the mapmarker is visible from start. Note that this is only a demo, the house has no navmesh and is not decorated.\r<br />\r<br />I tried to port all animated objects over to Skyrim but I only was successful with the animated single doors and the secret doors. The divided doors, the secret levers and the rotating spit of the original are not included. As a replacement for the rotating spit I added a grill and a special fire for the hearth.\r<br />\r<br />You will notice that there are no stairways between the floors. Stroti called this &#34;barrier-free&#34; ^^. You can connect the floor simply with doors or invent something else like the &#34;lifts&#34; that I made up in the demo esp. \r<br />\r<br />It took me a rather long time to accomplish this as Stroti used many original Oblivion textures that I had to replace. I hope you like how it came out at last. \r<br />\r<br />=============================\r<br />Changes in Version 1.1:\r<br />=============================\r<br />\r<br />Added alternate meshes with lightened /unlightened windows for the manor, first floor, ground floor and attic. For those who want the exterior windows lighted too and for those who want to change the lighting of the windows per script according to the daytime\r<br />Added a modified Stroti well for use in the basement, for those who fear to fall down the black hole \r<br />Added missing footstep sound to the basement\r<br />Corrected wrong footstep sound for the outside stairs\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Tools used:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Blender\r<br />Nifskope\r<br />NifUtils by Skyfox\r<br />Creation Kit\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />This is a modders resource.You may use the meshes and textures for your own mods as long as you give credit and you do not charge money for it.\r<br />\r<br />You may use this resource in Skyrim Special Edition too. All files should work without problems. \r<br />\r<br />Do not upload to other sites.\r<br />\r<br />Stroti has quit modding and will no longer be active on the forums.\r<br />I have his personal permission to convert his Oblivion resources and to upload them.\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Credits:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Stroti for his resources and for everything he has given to the TES community&#33;\r<br />The Niftools team for giving us Nifskope.\r<br />Skyfox from the Niftools team for his great tool NifUtils\r<br />Bethesda for the TES games.",
