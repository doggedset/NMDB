  "summary": "I like this mod but I have some beef with it.<br />It's either you have to find the Cube in a place that's ridiculously hard to find (I seriously can't find that place)<br />or I have it right away but I have a ridiculous amount of items... there is no middle ground.<br /><br />That's why I edited it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I edited the version where you have the cube right away but now the only items in there are 500 gold and 100 lockpicks.\n<br />\n<br />I'm just a kid who wants to change the mod a little bit to his tastes and figured someone else may like it this way.\n<br />\n<br />Credits to YsCordelan, the one who made the mod.",
