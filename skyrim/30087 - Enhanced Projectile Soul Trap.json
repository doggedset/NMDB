  "summary": "Changes the Soul Trap spell to have a visible projectile and impact. This makes it much easier to aim and fire the spell.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][center][b]Important note: The Unofficial Skyrim Patch as of v2 fixes this issue completely. Acquistive Soul Gems now carries over the fix by default, so there's no reason to use this mod (and I will probably remove it)[/center][/size]\r\n\r\n[b]--Description--[/b]\r\n\r\nThis simple mod changes the Soul Trap spell to have a visible projectile and impact, so you can actually tell where you aiming the darn spell, and where its going (see the images for what I am talking about). \r\nThis mod is the same as Projectile Soul Trap with Visible Impact by SteepledHat, but unlike said mod, this one was made entiely using TES5Edit and not using TESVSnip, as the latter is known to cause save game corruption. \r\nThis mod was also made with compatibility in mind for the excellent [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5312]Acquisitive Soul Gems[/url] by bluedanieru. In fact, the reason why this particular mod exists at all was because of a compatibility issue between Projectile Soul Trap and Acquisitive Soul Gems, forcing the latter out of the also excellent [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11]STEP Project[/url]. Until now.\r\n\r\n[b]-- Installation --[/b]\r\n\r\nUse a mod manager, such as Wyre Bash or Mod Organizer to install the mod. Simply select which version you want to install, depending on if you got Acquisitive Soul Gems installed or not.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to install with a mod manager for some reason, just extract the desired version over from the version folder of your choice to your Skyrim data folder (usually under Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim), and enable using the launcher.\r\n\r\n[b]-- Uninstallation --[/b]\r\n\r\nUse your mod manager to uninstall, or just remove Enhanced Soul Trap.esp from your Skyrim data folder.\r\n\r\n[b]-- Compatibility --[/b]\r\n\r\nVery compatible with Acquistive Soul Gems. Just install the proper version.\r\n[i]Not[/i] compatible with Enchanting Awakened. Does the same thing as this mod and more - if you are looking for a REALLY complete overhaul of the enchanting system, look there.\r\nWill be incompatible with anything that modifies the Soul Trap spell (FormID 0004DBA4) or the Soul Trap effect (FormID 0004DBA3), that isn't already listed in the compatible mods section. If your mod modifies any of those records, please PM me and I can work out a compatible version for your mod.\r\n\r\n[b]-- Credits --[/b]\r\n\r\nSteepledHat, for creating the original Projectile Soul Trap, which formed the basis of this mod.\r\nbluedanieru, for creating Acquisitive Soul Gems and letting me extend his mod.\r\nFarlo, for suggesting that I make this mod in the first place.\r\nElminsterAU, Sharlikran, and Zilav for creating TES5Edit, a great modding tool, and the only one that I used to create this mod.\r\nrpgsc, for providing the screenshots for this mod.\r\nblacksupernova for providing a fix to the \"soul trap inanimate objects\" bug, as well as fixing the impact effect to be more visible.\r\nThe entire STEP team, for being awesome, and crafting a very detailed noob-friendly guide to enhancing Skyrim. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11]Go check it out![/url]\r\n\r\nAnd finally, Bethesda Softworks for creating such a modular and quality game. Thank you all!",
