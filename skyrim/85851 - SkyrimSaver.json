  "descriptionHtml": "[color=Blue][size=5]INTRO[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />   I got inspired to make this program when I couldn&#39;t start a quest since a mod (I&#39;m using approx 150 mods) corrupted my save file. All my save files    were corrupted too (automatic ones and quick). The last working save (before the mod broke the save) that I found, was made 4 hrs ago. After losing    4hrs of progress, I decided to code this lil helper.\r<br />\r<br />[color=Blue][size=5]BASICS[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />   SkyrimSaver is a program that makes backups from save files automatically and archives(ZIP) them. So when you find out that your game save is    broken, you can get that progress back&#33; It is universal, you can basically use it on any files that you want to back up when changes are made to them    (it only makes a backup if the file has been modified). SkyrimSaver lets you to decide when the files are getting archived and intervals. After setting    up your settings, just click &#34;Start Saving&#34; -button, minimize it and start your game&#33;. Skyrim Saver will work in the background.\r<br />\r<br />    It&#39;s coded in Java, so you need Java :) I made this program to myself, but decided to release it, maybe someone needs it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=Blue][size=5]About SkyrimSaver, READ[/size][/color][size=5]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />   YOU NEED JAVA&#33;\r<br />   The auto downloader is kind of buggy, so download it manually: [url=https://www.java.com/en/download/]HERE&#33;[/url]\r<br />   When using to backup skyrim saves, remember to backup both files .ess and skse&#33;\r<br />   \r<br />   If you find any bugs, please inform me&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />[color=Blue]About Me[/color]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />   I&#39;m fairly new in modding and this community.\r<br />   My mother language isn&#39;t English, so bare with me :)\r<br />   \r<br />[color=Blue][size=5]For the people who are concerned\r<br />[color=#ffffff][size=3][size=2]   [/size][/size][/color][/size][/color][url=https://virustotal.com/file/8e033deb6479371032defadee7c8a8414b36994f48117d118b1d7dd338b93f9a/analysis/1502049225/]For the exe: Virustotal    [/url]      \r<br />   [url=https://www.virustotal.com/file/9b34777dfafadeef86268fad677ac094240d9265162131d3dda84fc1921f1ab5/analysis/1502051426/]For the jar: Virustotal\r<br />[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[center][/center][img]https://image.prntscr.com/image/SrJFKGUETVKFtHsmcFgwtA.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://image.prntscr.com/image/qBUsQ-WAQbqRRm7hjxDuuA.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />   [size=1]road to 3 endorsements[/size]",
