  "descriptionHtml": "In the &#34;Skyrim Soundtrack Expansion&#34; thread some people were asking for a compatability patch with Fantasy Music Overhaul. I used TES5Edit to add the tracks from SSE to the &#34;Fantasy Music Overhaul&#34;, preserving all of Fantasy Music Overhaul&#39;s additions. Only 4 music lists were affected. I also removed the dirty edits that were in Skyrim Soundtrack Expansion.\r<br />\r<br />This is just a plugin, so you need to download both:\r<br />\r<br />Fantasy Music Overhaul:   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28583/\r<br />Skyrim Soundtrack Expansion:    http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25163\r<br />\r<br />Simply overwrite the Skyrim Soundtrack Expansion&#39;s esp and deactivate Fantasy Music Overhaul plugin.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first ever mod and Nexus post, so contact me if I have done anything wrong or if there are any problems with the plugin. It should be easy to add your own music. You simply define a track in the Track branch of TES5Edit, and then add a reference to that track in the appropriate playlist.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to AceeQ for Fantasy Music Overhaul and   Robert Scott for  Skyrim Soundtrack Expansion.",
