  "summary": "Makes magic more powerful",
  "descriptionHtml": "--------------\r\nFunction\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThis mod changes novice, apprentice, adept, expert and master perks for some magic skills to make magic more powerful.\r\nDestruction - Your familiarity with the forces of magic increases all spell damage by 15 percent per perk.\r\nRestoration - your experience with casting magic on yourself through healing and protection allows you to absorb ten percent more of the magic effects cast upon you.\r\nAlteration - Through years of applying defense to yourself, your body has absorbed some of the magic, permanently hardening your skin.\r\nConjuration - Wrangling souls and objects from other planes of oblivion has taught you to hold on to magic effects twenty percent longer than usual.\r\nIllusion - Your experience with Illusion allows your magic to burrow deeper into your target\\'s mind and affect higher level targets.\r\n\r\nFor balancing purposes, these perks no longer halve magicka cost of the spells. They\\'ll still be worth casting.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\nCompatibility\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThis mod changes novice, apprentice, adept, expert and master perks of Destruction, Restoration, Conjuration and Alteration.\r\nShould be compatible with anything which doesn\\'t chance the aforementioned perks.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\nNotes\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nI know there\\'s plenty of other mods out there to increase magic power. I merely made this one because it feels more balanced, instead of just being a percentage bonus tacked onto all skills.\r\nI haven\\'t tested conjuration properly yet, so if you encounter any problems with the expanded time, let me know and I\\'ll try to fix it.\r\nIf anybody have any suggestions for what to do with the other magic classes (or any other perks) please let me know and I\\'ll see if I can/want to include it in my mod.",
