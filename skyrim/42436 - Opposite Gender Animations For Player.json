  "summary": "Makes the player character use the animations for the opposite gender.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Makes the player character use the opposite gender's animations. Works with custom animations.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because not every female character has to be a delicate little flower with a swishy walk, and not every male character has to stomp around like a cave man.\r\n\r\nDoes not effect NPCs. I promise you that Farkas won't start daintily strolling around, funny though that would be. If he does then someone else broke him, it's not this mod. XD\r\n\r\nCompatible with anything that doesn't edit the Player NPC. Enable and play!\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nIt has been brought to my attention that some people have been getting issues with this not working properly if enabled during the intro sequence at Helgen. Simply wait until you're out of the cave, save your game, and then enable it afterwards and that should take care of the problem.",
