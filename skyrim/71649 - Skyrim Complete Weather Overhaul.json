  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/71649-2-1448792598.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />I’m of the opinion that in the right situation less is always more. The vanilla Skyrim weather leaves a LOT to be desired. Yet, if you look ‘under the hood’ the vanilla Skyrim weather system can be fantastically improved WITHOUT doing major surgery to the game. You don’t need a weather mod that ‘reinvents the wheel’ and then require a ton of patches to get it to work with other mods. That’s what I did with Skyrim Complete Weather Overhaul: I tweaked and tuned what was already there, and now the very same Skyrim weather system that everyone likes to knock is brimming with top-shelf goodness&#33;\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#f1c232][size=3][b]Features[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Skyrim Complete Weather Overhaul changes NOTHING in the game. It only enhances what is already there. Now you don’t need any other weather mod to get some serious weather action going for Skyrim. I designed this mod with the intent to radically enhance the default weather system, and to compliment my Eidolon ENB and Skyrim Enhanced Night Sky mod. I also wanted to make it accessible and desirable as a resource for ENB authors and enthusiasts. The key features of Skyrim Complete Weather Overhaul are:\r<br />\r<br />[color=#6fa8dc]\r<br />[/color][list]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Vastly improved rain density (the number of falling raindrops) and appearance, with varying wind speed and precipitation velocity according to the type of storm you are in (a drizzle will drizzle, and a thunderstorm will drench you with hard and fast rain).[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Monster thunderclaps for storms&#33; There are now thunderclaps and rolling thunder in snowstorms as well&#33; And spells and shouts that elicit thunder are also vastly improved. Be warned&#33; The thunder is loud and realistic&#33; And when combined with what you’ll see in Skyrim, it might melt your face and ears&#33;[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Fog is actually foggy. I mean really foggy. As in, “Wow&#33; I’m literally surrounded by fog&#33;” The fog is turbulent as well - meaning, it will move and surround you, thin and thicken as moments go by. In vanilla Skyrim you can easily get fog-bound. And in ENBs you WILL see fog. The better ENBs will see fog comparable to vanilla Skyrim with Skyrim Complete Weather Overhaul installed.[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]I fixed a number of issues with snow type during certain storms, including density, volume, and velocity. This has never really been addressed by Bethesda or by other modders. The result is several types of more realistic snowy weathers. Also, thunder is now a part of heavy snow storms&#33;[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Many of the areas in Skyrim should have fog, but don’t. For instance, Bloated Man Grotto. And the fogs have DEFINITELY been ramped up in Sovengarde and areas of the Blue Palace&#33;[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]The Helgen Dragon attack and the Civil War battlefields have had their weather effects tweaked&#33;[/color]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff][size=4]In the videos section of this page I will upload samples of the various weathers during the day and night, and transitions. They are recorded in 720p HD, so you can expand it to full screen to get a really good look at it. But there will be a little loss in fidelity at full screen, with some &#39;bubbling&#39; in the view.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/color]\r<br />I created the core files of this mod in the Skyrim Creation Kit using Bethesda assets, and verified it clean and error-free in TES5Edit. So you can rest assured that Skyrim Complete Weather Overhaul is compatible with practically everything. \r<br />\r<br />Here are some mods that are verified as perfectly compatible:\r<br />[color=#6fa8dc]\r<br />[/color][list]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]All Unofficial Skyrim Patches[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Sounds of Skyrim[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Immersive Sound Compendium[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Audio Overhaul for Skyrim[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Alternate Start – Live Another Life[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Morning Fog by MannyGT[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Lanterns of Skyrim[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Claralux[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]RLO[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]ELFX[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Relighting Skyrim[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Ultra Realistic World Lighting[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]The Ruffled Feather[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]The Ruffled Feather – Enhanced Distant Terrain[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Get Snowy[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]No Snow Under The Roof[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Expanded Snow Systems[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Minty Lightning[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Civil War Overhaul[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Real Shelter[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Frostfall[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Campfire[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Hypothermia[/color]\r<br />[*][color=#6fa8dc]Camping Kit of the Northern Ranger[/color]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Skyrim Complete Weather Overhaul does NOT need to be patched to use any of the above mods. More, it is also compatible with ANY ENB Preset (especially [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71287/?]Eidolon ENB[/url], which was used to take the screenshots), and any world or city texture pack. However, Skyrim Complete Weather Overhaul is not compatible with other weather mods such as Climates of Tamriel or Pure Weather. For more information about mod compatibility, please read the README.txt file included in the download.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232][size=3]Optimized For System Performance[/size][/color]\r<br />Skyrim Complete Weather Overhaul will not hit your system performance like some other weather mods do. In fact, the impact is so low you can consider it negligible.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232][size=3]Installation[/size][/color]\r<br />You should use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/?]Mod Organizer[/url] to install Skyrim Complete Weather Overhaul.\r<br />\r<br />You can also install manually install Skyrim Complete Weather Overhaul by copying the contents of the archive and then pasting it INTO your Skyrim DATA folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232][size=3]My Other Mods[/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71638/?]Skyrim Enhanced Night Sky[/url] - It does for the Skyrim&#39;s stars and galaxy what this mod does for Skyrim&#39;s weather&#33;\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71287/?]Eidolon ENB[/url] - This is my personal ENB Preset. Feature-rich, I tune and update it regularly&#33; It supports Night Eye&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232][size=3]Credits[/size][/color]\r<br />The only things that I did NOT create in this mod are the textures and sound effects. My sincerest thanks go out to:\r<br />\r<br />[color=#cc0000]EverCharmer[/color], for use of those awesome snowflake textures&#33;\r<br />[color=#cc0000]Wordeee[/color], for the use of the sound assets from Immersive Skyrim Thunder.\r<br />[color=#cc0000]Yuril[/color], for the road textures.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][color=#f1c232][size=3]A note on using this mod as a resource[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r<br />[b]The assets from EverCharmer and Yuril are generally free to use without permission as long as you credit them. However, you MUST ask Wordeee for permission to use IST in your own mod if you are going to redistribute it, or me and Wordeee if you want to use this mod in your own with the intent to redistribute it. The basis of my weather overhaul is modular, so if you want to use (for example) fog and nothing else, or rain and fog, and so on, then send me a message and we&#39;ll work something out. Note that I expressly forbid the re-packing and/or re-naming of this mod and then re-uploading it here or anywhere outside of the Nexus for either fun or profit.[/b]",
