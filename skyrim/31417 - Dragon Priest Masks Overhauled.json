  "summary": "Adds crafting recipes to convert Dragon Priest masks between Heavy and Light versions for both Vanilla Skyrim and Dragonborn. **Note: Does not include Miraak**",
  "descriptionHtml": "This was created out of a part of Dragonborn that irked me. \r\n\r\nFirst, all the new Dragon Priest masks are Heavy Armor. Why? I have no idea. Seeing as they\\'re generally geared to mages, this seems silly.  I know some play mages with Heavy armor, though, so I added new crafting recipes to the game as well. \r\n\r\nI then realized there was nothing that did this out there on the Nexus for vanilla Skyrim. So I went ahead and did that too. There is now a Light Armor and a Heavy Armor version of each of the following masks, and they can be converted into the other version in a blacksmith\\'s forge: \r\n\r\nKrosis\r\nOtar\r\nKonahrik\r\nHevnoraak\r\nMorokei\r\nNahkriin\r\nRahgot\r\nVokun\r\nVolsung\r\nAhzidal\r\nDukaan\r\nZahkriisos\r\n\r\nI also added a mask for Vahlok The Jailer, the only named Dragon Priest in Skyrim (be it vanilla or expansions) lacking a mask. \r\n\r\nThe mask (eponymously named Vahlok) is temperable with 1 ebony ingot, same as the other Dragon Priest masks. The stats on it are:\r\n\r\nWhen health is below 50%, Restoration is increased by 50%\r\n\r\nThe reason that I did not include Miraak is that his mask is obtainable in either form in-game. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\n1. Download (NMM is recommended, use either \\\"Download with Manager\\\" button or download manually)\r\n2. Place the .esp in data folder (If using NMM, either add to manager or simply activate it in the manager. \r\n3. Place the .esp after Dragonborn.\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nUninstallation\r\n\r\n1. Uncheck from load order\r\n2. Delete .esp\r\n3. If using NMM, delete from NMM\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n\r\nThis mod will not be compatible with other mods that tweak the masks. \r\n\r\nThis mod is compatible with T3nd0\\'s Skyrim Redone, provided you use his ReProccer utility.\r\nCurrently you will need Balbor and Steelsouls SkyRe ReProccer Project in order to get Dragonborn working properly with SkyRe and the ReProccer.\r\n\r\nT3nd0\\'s Skyrim Redone: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286\r\nReProccer: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28467\r\nBalbor and Steelsouls SkyRe ReProccer Project: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27092\r\n",
