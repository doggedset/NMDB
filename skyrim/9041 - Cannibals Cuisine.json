  "summary": "Adds a pie and stew that require human flesh and hearts to make.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds two delicious meals for the dovahkiin who has a taste for the taboo. Human stew and pie require one piece of human flesh to make, and the stew also requires a human heart. They both require other food ingredients as well, for taste. See the pictures for the recipes.\r\n\r\n\\\"But Cheez,\\\" you say. \\\"Hearts and flesh are so rare! How will I find enough to make such exquisite meals on a daily basis?\\\" I am glad you asked, because I made a mod that takes care of that which inspired this one! More Hearts And Flesh and Maybe Hearts And Flesh can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8609\r\n\r\n Note that NEITHER ARE REQUIRED, but this mod is meant to work in conjunction with the other. \r\n\r\nAlso, since there is apparently a cannibal quest in the game, it\\'s worth mentioning that completing that quest is not needed to use this mod. Anyone can make the recipes from day one. Eating the stew and pie is also not a crime, since for all anyone knows it\\'s a beef heart and leg you\\'re cooking. ",
