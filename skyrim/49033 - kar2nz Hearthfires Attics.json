  "descriptionHtml": "This idea was blatantly stolen from Jokerine, who graciously gave permission for me to proceed with the project.  You can view the original attic set here  \r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32557/?\r<br />\r<br />Being a long time fan of Hearthfires Multiple Adoptions, i found it irritating that my housecarl was taking up one of my kid&#39;s beds, while the poor child stood next to the bed looking confused.  \r<br />\r<br />Then, a friend pointed out Jokerine&#39;s attic mods, and i just couldn&#39;t resist putting my own flavor on the idea.\r<br />\r<br />This is more of a follower headquarters type of attic.  There is ample room for up to ten companions to sleep comfortably.  I tried to follow the original style of the hearthfires home in my choice of tilesets, but i did add a few little goodies from Insanity, lazyskeever, and XunAmarox.  Thanks to them all.\r<br />\r<br />If you use Hearthfires Multiple Adoptions, you have the option of adopting up to six children.  Originally i think that this mod only worked on vanilla homes, leaving four children up all night in all the vanilla city homes.  Thankfully, some mod authors have made really nice versions of these vanilla homes with extra beds for the children to sleep in.  PCGirl is one good example. She has some really nice homes set up to house six children, and i do recommend them.  Be sure to read the instructions before you install these homes.  \r<br />\r<br />Now, TMPhoenix has added custom home support, so if you can follow the instructions, you can make your own HMA compatible homes.  The problem with HMA in the Hearthfires homes has always been that there were exactly six extra beds, and the housecarl needed a place to sleep too, but there is a solution.  If you install &#34;My Home Is Your Home&#34; you can assign the housecarl to live in the attic.  Not to worry, your housecarl has been well cared for.  In fact, there is now room for nine other companions to live up there as well.\r<br />\r<br />The Hearthfires homes just got a lot bigger. I hope you enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />For now, Windstad and Lakeview are available.  Lakeview requires the Windstad plugin to work.\r<br />\r<br />Known Problems and Incompatibilities.\r<br />\r<br />Unfortunately, these are going to conflict with Jokerine&#39;s original attic mods. They might also conflict with other mods that modify the interior of any of these hearthfires homes.  The only way to find out is to try, but be sure you make a hard save first, and be ready to go back to that save if it doesn&#39;t work out.  Please report it to me if there is a conflict so i can add it to this list.\r<br />\r<br />So far i have not noticed any other problems.  Again, please don&#39;t hesitate to report any problems to me.\r<br />\r<br />Credits \r<br />\r<br />Jokerine - for the original attics - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32557/?\r<br />lazyskeever - for the windows\r<br />insanity - for the chairs and rugs\r<br />XunAmarox - for the Bedspreads\r<br />\r<br />Permissions\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t mind at all if you want to improve on these attics without permission as long as you credit me, and everyone i credited. I do want to be nice about this. However, if you fail to credit everyone involved, including myself, i will give one warning, and then seek the removal of your mod permanently if you do not respond. i can accept that people make mistakes, and overlook stuff, but if it is pointed out to you and you do nothing, i will respond accordingly.
