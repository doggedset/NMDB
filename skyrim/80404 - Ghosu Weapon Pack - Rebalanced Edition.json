  "summary": "A rebalancement of the original mod, with leveled lists adding",
  "descriptionHtml": "I always loved Ghosu&#39;s Weapon Pack, but I always felt like it was a tad too immersion breaking, as it was originally. All the weapons of the mod were craftable with steel smithing perk, while having stats equal to ebony or daedric weapons (sometimes even higher than daedric) so kinda early in the game, and due to their high attack rate they made the difficulty of the first part of the game pretty trivial. Plus, you could obtain them only by crafting. So I decided to change that.\r<br /> \r<br />List of changes:\r<br /> \r<br />-All the weapon are nowflagged as ebony weapon, except for Strider Sword, Strider Claymore, Sedethul,\r<br />Sedethul Greatsword and Sedethul Dagger, which are flagged as silver weapon and have the proper &#34;silver sword script&#34; applied on them\r<br /> \r<br />-You can now craft the weapons only if you have the ebony smithing perk, and the material needed to craft the weapons have been altered. As it is now, you need ebony ingots instead of steel ingots, and the iron ingots needed to craft Thor&#39;s hammers have been changed to steel ingots\r<br /> \r<br />-Damage output has been rebalanced fot all weapons, making them slightly stronger than ebony weapons but slightly weaker than daedric ones.\r<br /> \r<br />-All the weapon are now distributed in leveled lists, so they will be purchasable by blacksmiths and vendors, as soon as you have a high character level. Since they&#39;re flagged as ebony weapons, they show up in leveled lists at the same level as ebony weapons, which means that unless you rise your smithing skills to get the ebony smithing perk, you won&#39;t see any of them until you reach Lv36 (Lv32 for the Aegis of Champions shield)\r<br /> \r<br />-Made a version compatible with Nock2Tip Archery Overhaul. In this version, Green Arrow Bow has the same tempering requirements as the ebony bow, so you will need to have at least Lv60 in Archery to temper your bow with the 80lb Draw String, and Lv75 Archery with the 120lb Draw String\r<br /> \r<br />-The price of all weapons has been rised, to make them more valuable than ebony weapons, in terms of money\r<br />\r<br />-Tempering recipes have been altered as well. Instead of steel ingots you now need ebony ingots to temper weapons. Plus, if a weapon did require other kind of materials to be tempered (Mammoth Tusk, Gold Ingots and such) you will now need those materials AND ebony ingots to temper the weapons\r<br />\r<br />You can choose two versionof the main file, depending on wether you using Nock2Tip Archery Overhaul or not. If you don&#39;t want the weapons to be distributed in leveled lists, thenchose the related optional file. Only chose one, though.\r<br />\r<br />AUTHOR NOTE, READ CAREFULLY: Since I want to show my respect to the original author of the mod, you still need his version to have mine to work properly. You will need to download the main version, as well as the optional files Sedethul Dagger AND Scabbard Addon.\r<br /> \r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br /> \r<br />MANUAL (Not Recommended)\r<br /> \r<br />-Download your version ofchoice\r<br />-Open the rar file and copyall of its content in Skyrim Data folder\r<br />-Overwrite everythingif/when prompted\r<br /> \r<br />MOD ORGANIZER (Highly Recommended)\r<br /> \r<br />-Download the files byclicking either &#34;download with manager&#34; or &#34;download\r<br />manualy&#34;\r<br />-If you downloaded withmanager, simply double click on downloaded file, then install\r<br />-If you downloaded manualy,click on &#34;install mod from archive&#34; button (the very first one on the\r<br />top left corner of the program window) and select the archive of this mod\r<br />-Click ok and you&#39;re up to go\r<br /> \r<br />RECOMMENDED MODS\r<br /> \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65317/?]Nock2Tip – ArcheryOverhaul[/url]: If you feel like Archery in Skyrim is broken and want something more satisfying and worthwhile playing\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28545/?]Ghosus Weapon Pack[/url]:The original mod, which made my work possible by all means\r<br />\r<br />MY OTHER MODS\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53511/?]Cursom Main Menu Wallpaper Replacer[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53892/?]Main Menu Song Replacer[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68516/?]Sofia - The Funny Fully Voiced Follower (Traduzione Italiana)[/url] V2.03\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56536/?]The Bane Of Kings - Alduin Retexture[/url]\r<br /> \r<br />CREDITS\r<br /> \r<br />Ghosu for creating cheoriginal mod and for allowing the modding community to use his assets for our modding.
