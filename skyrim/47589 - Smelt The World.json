  "summary": "Mod that allows players to smelt many normal objects from Skyrim back into their base metals, including additional Dwemer clutter that was previously not smeltable, silver clutter such as plates, platters and goblets, every form of standard craftable armor and weapon save dradonbone and dragonscale varieties, all forms of jewelry, etc. The catch is",
  "descriptionHtml": "As the Thieves Guild's Guildmaster and leader of the last remaining chapter of the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim, and also being quite fond of smithing, I have found that there were hundreds, if not thousands of opportunities for me to lighten some poor fool's home of loads of uncommon items only to find that they are virtually worthless to me in-game. 5 septims for a silver goblet. Ha. Often not even worth the bother of carrying to a fence. This mod aims to correct that by allowing one to smelt any and all semi-valuable items down into their base metals, Cash4Gold-style...\r\n\r\nSilver platters, jugs and goblets stolen during your short but memorable stay on The Katariah may have seemed worthless, non-magical looted armor and weapons that was previously just considered trash, even gem-laiden jewlery can now be smelted down into it's base metals. Why waste time storming back into Halted Stream Camp yet again when every Iron Dagger in the game can be smelted back into an Iron Ingot whenever you like? With the proper perks, the Dragonborn can even reverse-smelt ingots back into ore if they need to for transmutation or crafting purposes.\r\n\r\nBend the metals of Skyrim to your will and do with them as you please. Smelt The World of Skyrim for all it's worth.",
