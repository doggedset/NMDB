  "summary": "Limits the ability to exploit certain skills by tying them to your character level.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is beta. If you install it, watch out for it to mess up. It shouldn&#39;t, but if it does, let me know. \r<br />\r<br />This is a simple mod to make it so the four skills Alchemy, Enchanting, Pickpocket, and Smithing can&#39;t be trained above twice your character&#39;s level. It&#39;s a quick and simple way to attempt to deal with these skills being exploitable.\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s an optional file which will limit the above four skills as well as Sneak and Conjuration. Finally, a third version will eventually be available which will have the ability to limit all skills and you can choose which ones to limit.\r<br />\r<br />Notes: There is a small issue with this. While you are in a menu, the script can&#39;t run. That means it can&#39;t activate while you are in a menu. So, if you level up to the limit of alchemy, then you can continue to level as long as you like. It&#39;ll activate as soon as you exit the menu. It&#39;s up to you not to abuse that small loophole. I&#39;ll look into fixing that, but I don&#39;t know that it can be done.\r<br />\r<br />How: Creates a quest to start the script. The script checks the character&#39;s level against the four skills. Any skill higher than your level triggers the adding of a perk to negate that skill&#39;s advancement. They should still be able to be trained and books and the like should still work, but I&#39;m not sure. I might change it a bit so they can be trained to a higher level than the character&#39;s, but that will have to wait a bit.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s simple enough that I can&#39;t imagine it would cause any problems and it should have zero compatibility issues. Hope you like it.",
