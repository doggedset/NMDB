  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a small shack not far from Falkreath.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod. My intention was to add an unmarked quest (I still need to figure out how to add quests) and I do have the cell for part of it put together, I just have to finish populating it and that will come in an update. For now though, the shack is constructed and contains a fire pit, cooking area, alchemy, enchanting, and smithing area.\r<br />\r<br />One known bug is concerned with dynamic things. If you make the chests a dynamic safe chest, it will copy the chest and anything you&#39;ve put it will disappear, hidden beneath the new chest. The chests should already be safe. If they aren&#39;t, please let me know.",
