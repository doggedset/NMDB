  "descriptionHtml": "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~What this mod does~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \r<br />If you´re looking for things that make sense,you should leave and never come back. \r<br />I also just put it on Nexus due to popular demand,so there´s a slight chance this mod will receive updates later than the Workshop one.\r<br />\r<br />This mod includes a lot of things that aren´t included in vanilla Skyrim,which is the point of mods: \r<br />- A knife in that kitchen where you cook the soup for the emperor in Solitude \r<br />-A crafting recipe for baskets(for all your thieve-ish needs) \r<br />\r<br />Update (I´m gonna call it) 1.1: \r<br />-added 50% more content \r<br />-A fork that hurts people on the inside \r<br />-I´m going to place it somewhere later.For now,type &#34;help fork 4&#34; in the console \r<br />-A changelog \r<br />\r<br />Update 1.2 (of awesomeness): \r<br />-I actually did work on more content during vacation,because I like dis \r<br />-Meat from dead chicken actually now actually is useful&#33; If you don´t get killed gathering chicken,you can now cook \r<br />Chicken Overload Stew. It will make you fart out a magic teleportation chicken, which you will teleport back to when \r<br />doing things other than walking \r<br />-I also added craftable giant dwarven &#34;arrows&#34; that do kind of a lot of damage and explode on impact. \r<br />-And giants now drop their club as weapon \r<br />\r<br />Update 1.3 (of idealessness) \r<br />-Oh my gourd,I got double the subscribers over last night than I had before,thanks \r<br />-I added the &#34;Fork of Harassment&#34; to a table at Peryite´s shrine (I felt like he´s a ♥♥♥♥,too) \r<br />-Steam is censoring words like ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ \r<br />\r<br />Update 1.4 (of &#34;nope,that´s too next level&#34;) \r<br />-I added a bucket that will turn you invisible if you put it on your head,it´s in the four-shields-tavern in dragonbridge. \r<br />-Sadly it has the same restrictions a normal invisibility and since I´m not familiar with scripting,I can´t do anything about it \r<br />-And since I´m not familiar with making armor from non-armor meshes either,the bucket will make your head invisible \r<br />-Also, I added a potato-related spell,the spelltome is on a haybale next to the potato farm infront of Markarth. \r<br />\r<br />Update 1.5 (of your suggestions): \r<br />-Some of your suggestions(like doomster202retsmood´s &#34;It needs an staff which lets you fly&#34;) occur impossible for \r<br />me to do until I maybe get a bit more into scripting(or unlock that perk,I guess) \r<br />-But the ones I did work on today are: \r<br />-Sakaki:&#34;You should make a daedric sword... that does 1 damage.&#34; \r<br />It´s craftable like a normal daedric sword,but doesn´t require a daedra heart \r<br />-starfire_403:&#34;How about a wooden plate that improves magic resistance? Or maybe even tongs that improve alchemy&#33; &#34; \r<br />-The magic wooden plate is located in the longhouse of the jarl of Winterhold.(because Winterhold and magic) \r<br />-The alchemy tongs are at the Falkreath blacksmith.(because there are trees around) \r<br />-Both use the same unused armor slot,so although not being visible,you don´t need to choose between one of them \r<br />or actual armor. \r<br />-Weinachtsheld:&#34;something that summons Nazeem or turns people into Him.&#34; \r<br />-You need to pickpocket the spell tome from him \r<br />-I only got this far today but about your suggestion #2: I think I already have an idea for that,but I don´t know if \r<br />Skyrim allows that. \r<br />-About #3:could take a bit of time,but I already made potatoes,so that´s not impossible \r<br />-Und WeiHnachten schreibt man mit h, du Held&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Update 1.6 (of intensifying randomness) \r<br />-How do you guys get these ideas? \r<br />-First,this oddly-named dagger you can find at the bed of the conjuration master of the winterhold college,that \r<br />spawns rabbits when you hit someone with it \r<br />-Then a basket that fortifies your lifting powers \r<br />-Even craftable and shootable cabbage ammunition + RPMs (Rocket powered mudcrabs) \r<br />-Christ,even a mudcrab overlord boss near &#34;Camp Broken Limb&#34; \r<br />-The bludgeonspoon theoretically exists,too,but for now, you will have to cheat it in,because I seriously need to get \r<br />into NIFSkope to make it look like something that doesn´t hover under your feet \r<br />\r<br />Update 1.7(of a thing you should try and a thing you shouldn´t try) \r<br />-added a test chamber with everything in it that works \r<br />-There´s a trapdoor on one of the islands in the lake around the guardian stones,you can´t miss it once you see the \r<br />red lights around it. \r<br />-I also add3d a rinG cAlled &#34;Logic&#34;,d0n´t trY g1ving it to your§elf,logic isn´t compatible with this mod \r<br />\r<br />Update 1.8 (of accidentally-but-was-going-to-happen-anyway-iness) \r<br />-So,whoever had this idea to place a cabbage farm inside of Dragonsreach,good idea,it looks fabulous&#33; \r<br />-And if you´re there,consider visiting the mage to &#34;borrow&#34; the 2 staffs that chill out on a wall there. \r<br />-I´m working on a sequel to this mod(it will be stand-alone,but won´t have the testing chamber(which won´t have the new items)) \r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~But wait,there´s more~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \r<br />I will constantly try to think of new content and furthermore,I will even try to add that content \r<br />\r<br />Comment your own suggestions,I really do look at it every day \r<br />Or twice a day... \r<br />Or every hour... \r<br />\r<br />Make sure you look at the Workshop version of this,too because I will comment status updates and\r<br />possible announcements there.\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Compatibility issues~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Uhm,I don´t think there are any... \r<br />(since I´m only working with duplicates) \r<br />And if you find one,tell me ",
