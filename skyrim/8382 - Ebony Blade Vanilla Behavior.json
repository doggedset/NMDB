  "descriptionHtml": "excuse my bad english...\r\ni made this for myself, and thought maybe someone else could use it\r\n\r\nthis mod restores the vanilla ebony blade bug. i know, it sounds strange...\r\ni\\'m using weapon and armor fixes for a while now, and i like this mod. but sadly it also fixes the \\\"bugged\\\" ebony blade. if your asking yourself, what bug i\\'m talking about.. vanilla ebony blade is using the 2hand skill as damage multiplier and the perks from the onehanded skill tree. \r\nhttp://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Ebony_Blade_%28Skyrim%29\r\nso it\\'s some kind of hybrid weapon. as i\\'m playing characters skilled in onehanded, dual wield, shield and so on, and i  had no perk points left for 2handed skills, i was quite happy about this \\\"bug\\\", because this was the only effective 2handed weapon in skyrim for me. and even a very cool one ^^\r\ni did nothing special. just made a new mod with the ck containing the vanilla entries for the ebony blade. took less than two minutes. nothing compared to the time writing this text^^\r\n\r\nso, if you\\'re using weapon and armor fixes or something similar, but want to keep the ebony blade as it is, for whatever reason, maybe this file will help\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n-Put EbonyBladeFixFix.esp into your skyrim/data folder\r\n-activate esp through... well, if you need this file you already know how to use plugins\r\n-make sure EbonyBladeFixFix.esp is loaded after any plugin suspected to change ebony blade behavior. otherwise it won\\'t work\r\n\r\n\r\nu can use this file freely. no need to ask for permission",
