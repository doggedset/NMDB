  "summary": "A modified orcish plate for an exposed and \\\"airy\\\" look. Sometimes the full garb amour can get a little stuffy *cough* For Favored Soul body.\r\n-Male Only-",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple modification of the vanilla male Orcish Plate mesh, there has been no tinkering with the texture. I created this to be a revealing version of the original armor, however this is my first go at modding and is as a result a pretty simple redesign using the Favored Soul body.\r\n\r\nAm looking into fine-tuning the mesh and possibly adding alternate versions sometime.\r\n\r\nThe craftable armor uses the same recipe as vanilla armor minus one orichalcum ingot.\r\n\r\nNOTE: There is a standalone version now, the files will not override the vanilla male orcish plate mesh when installed.\r\n\r\nThis mod is integrated with the Favored Soul body mesh, well, I think, so I\\'m assuming there could be a lack of body experience if you use it with another body type. \r\n\r\nThere are a few pointed bits that move...oddly...but that\\'s more due to my newb skill level at this point, thankfully the issues aren\\'t major standouts.\r\n\r\nThe upper arms are fully covered per the vanilla mesh at a weight of 0 but with larger bodies they will be half covered or so. Mostly due to laziness and uh... who needs that fabric anyways rubbing against the metal side plates and all <_<\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nChar in screenshot & the mesh was modified around Chris57 & Favored Soul\\'s male body mesh\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488\r\n\r\nChar in screenshot is a variant of Urshi\\'s companion mod Hot Male Housecarls\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17163\r\n\r\nHair is from ApachiiSkyHair (also included in the Hot Male Housecarls mod)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\n",
