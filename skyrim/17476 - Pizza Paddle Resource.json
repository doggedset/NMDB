I\\'ll try to fix this. Also When it drops the wood noise does not happen. I have added the noise but it will not register. I will try to fix these things soon!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Not sure when I can attempt to fix them, I\\'m just covered with homework and I\\'m a bit busy trying to push out some other mods.",
