  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#00ff00][b][size=5]What is this Mod?[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Just in time for The Shire's latest version 3.0 update, this mod adds 4 Alternate Start options; Ranger, Shire Resident, Ruffian, and Adventurer. Each begin their versions of The Shire's Main Quest. More details on each later on.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]\n<br />[color=#00ff00]Requirements?[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod requires TheBawb's Shire and Arthmoor's Alternate Start. (Which in itself requires all three official DLCs)\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84460?tab=description]The Shire\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52296?tab=description]\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/?]Alternate Start[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][size=5]Installation:[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />1) Install both The Shire and Alternate Start\n<br />   ﻿         ﻿\n<br />2) Install this mod last. Ensure that it is below the other two in your load order. \n<br />This patch is comprised of an ESP and BSA. To uninstall, simply delete them from your data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]\n<br />[b][size=5][color=#00ff00]Incompatibilities:[/color]\n<br />[/size][/b][/size][/b][b][size=5]\n<br />[/size][/b][size=3]This mod was very carefully designed to avoid conflicting with other Alternate Start Options. No Alternate Start scripts were edited, and the majority of edits made were made in a separate quest. To my knowledge there are no incompatibilities.[/size][b][size=5]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00]Features:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i66.tinypic.com/p6o1t.jpg[/img][img]http://i65.tinypic.com/11rcdx1.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00]The Ranger:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b][size=3]This option skips the first 4 Shire main quests (which are focused mainly on merging The Shire with Skyrim) and equips the player with the necessary Ranger equipment.[/size][b][size=5]\n<br />[img]http://i64.tinypic.com/28qw7i8.jpg[/img][img]http://i65.tinypic.com/2v30dqv.jpg[/img][img]http://i63.tinypic.com/2ziodbp.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00]The Ruffian[size=4]:[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b][size=3]This option places the player on a set track to The Shire's lesser-known Evil Main Quest.

I use several of his mods personally [size=3](including Alternate Start)[/size] and have never been disappointed in the professional quality of his work.[/size][b][size=5]\n<br />[img width=315,height=291]http://i64.tinypic.com/s2dyyv.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00]Do you take patch requests?[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Depends. As I recently re-picked up support for The Shire I tend to take reasonable requests for that project. As for others; probably not. Between military life, Unreal engine projects, and upkeeping The Shire I tend to be booked most days. But what the hell, drop the idea in the comments and see what happens.",
