  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod, so go easy on me. Umdumph Stump is a small orc house wedged inside a cave, deep in the woods, and hand built from crap by Umdumph himself. The house is for any lonely orc player or anyone who likes the look of orc, to claim. I notice there isn't much orc themed player houses; so, I built one... \r\n\r\nIt features: \r\none bedroom for two to sleep\r\na living room\r\na kitchen\r\na basement with alchemy and enchanting table\r\na backyard cave area with a forge, tanning area, workbench etc\r\na front yard gazebo area for another to sleep like a guard or something\r\nemote marker friendly for companions for immersion.\r\n\r\n..To be honest, I hate orcs and don't play one. I would suggest you and 2 other companions occupy the place since it is cramped inside. The house is located south of Dawnstar near Fort Fellhammer-find Umdumph and you'll find the key.",
