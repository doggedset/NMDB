Put simply, it is a balanced body texture mod somewhere between the stark photorealism of T.D.o.S or &#34;Mature Body Textures&#34; and the more minimal, un-blemished aesthetic of Caliente or Dimon&#39;s body textures.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />In the end the goal of this mod is not to provide ultra realistic or or uber gritty face and body textures (I already did that) but rather to provide a detailed, high quality middle ground somewhere between princess and the pauper. That having been said, If you are looking for something with a bit more grit check out the &#34;Custom Character Presets&#34;. (Below)\r<br />[size=2]Barbarous Beauty currently supports only the human races, but further race support is on the way.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]In addition to the mods base texture sets, I&#39;ve also included a series of custom character presets accessible via the &#34;Racemenu&#34; mod. Each with a set of custom face and body textures, back story and unique outfit. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]The goal of the Character Presets (aside from creating killer outfits) is to offer new and unique textures that may not All character presets, current and future will share the same basic mod requirements and folder structure. Hopefully this will help eliminate a lot of confusion concerning installation and management.  Unfortunately since all charcter presets share the same assets and file locations, you can only have one installed at a time. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]The outfits however are a different story, since they are standalone mods you can have as many installed as you want. fall in line with the main mods aesthetics and don&#39;t offer enough assets to turn into another mod, in other words, it&#39;s an orginizational thing and makes it easier for me to keep track of everything I develop. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]All character presets, current and future will share the same basic mod requirements and folder structure.

According to the Priesthood, the Timerigan is a being as old as Akotosh himself and predates the creation of man, elf and orc alike. \r<br />\r<br />Discerning the true nature of the Timerigan is difficult, a mystery that even the priests that claim fealty to it, have yet to solve. The timerigan is not a Deadric prince or a true divine, the only thing that is known is that it has some connection to the &#34;Ideal Masters&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Neith is from the Ehrishod Isles, a large grouping of islands in the heart of what used to be &#34;Yakuda&#34; the ancestral home of the redguard.\r<br />\r<br />While preforming the &#34;Ahgram&#39; Colahl&#34;, a right of passage wherein an acolyte of the Timerigan Priesthood is elevated to the status of Priest or Priestess, Neith was abducted by slave traders from Cyrodiil. \r<br />\r<br />She only barely survived the sea voyage back to Tamriel and was eventually taken by land through Cyrodiil and into Skyrim to be sold at auction to the Thalmor.\r<br />\r<br />While traveling through the Reach near Markarth, her caravan was attacked by storm cloaks.Amidst  the confusion, Neith was able to escape and tried making her towards Hammerfell and her distant cousins the Redgaurd, but was apprehended at the border and sentenced to exacution by the Empire.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4]Outfit: [/size][/color][color=#ff0000][size=4](CBBE only, UNP support is coming soon)[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Currently, the &#34;Timerigan Ritual Outfit&#34; is only accessible through the console type &#34;Help timerigan&#34; for the codes.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />xx000D66   Timerigan Ritual Bracers\r<br />xx000D67   Timerigan Ritual Chest Piece\r<br />xx000D68   Timerigan Ritual Collar\r<br />[size=2]xx000D69[/size]   [size=2]Timerigan Ritual Leggings[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]There are four pieces in the set non of which have a an armor rating, I have however assigned high tier enchantments to each article.

Click yes when asked to overwrite.The preset itself can be accessed via the &#34;Racemenu&#34;. To open the race menu open the dev console with the &#34;tilde&#34; key (~) and type &#34;showracemenu&#34;.  \r<br />In the &#34;Race&#34; section, select &#34;Temptress Race&#34; then in the &#34;Presets&#34; section open the presets menu and select &#34;Neith&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Inside the dowload I&#39;ve included a pictorial install guide for those unfamiliar with with &#34;Racemenu&#34;, look at this if your having problems.\r<br />\r<br />If you have a pre-existing character you can still use these presets, racemenu will keep track of all your stats, achievments and abilities and transfer them over if you change your race, look etc.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]FAQ&#39;s:===============================================[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Q: Why not just include the tattoos and whatnot as racemenu overlays instead of creating an entirely new texture set?\r<br />\r<br />A: First, because the overlay blending mechanic is extremely basic and ultimately too limited. Creating an entirely new set allows me a greater degree of control and besides, those details are also worked into the normal maps and specular maps. Second, simple things like tattoos and scars are not the only difference between the custom presets and the &#34;Main&#34; textures. subtle and major differences in the overall tone, musculature and composition may be present. Essentially, every custom preset is an opportunity to create a new and unique texture set without the hassle of creating an entirely new mod.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Why don&#39;t you create your own custom race instead of piggy backing someone else&#39;s?\r<br />\r<br />A: Time, experience (or lack thereof) and personal preference. I&#39;ve used a lot of custom race mods and the Temptress Race is the most stable one I&#39;ve found. Beyond that I genuinely like the mod, the stats are descent, the abilities are useful but not overpowered and the native presets are diverse and good looking. Bottom line, I like the Temptress Race mod.Q: Do you plan on providing further support for more bodies?A: No, what you see is what you get.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Do you plan on providing Elf and Orc support?\r<br />\r<br />A: Yes, the third and fourth character presets are Elven and Orcish respectively. Seeing as I&#39;ll have to develop the assets eventually anyways, expect to see them in the main texture set sooner than later.A: Your Character outfits aren&#39;t lore friendly.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Yeah, at this point I&#39;ve put so many hours into skyrim over the last three years I&#39;m about two achievments away from an existential crisis and I don&#39;t even play that much anymore. between school, work and life, when I actually have the chance to play skyrim (or any game for that matter) &#34;lore&#34; is the last thing on my mind. I just wanna have fun.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Your installation directions suck, can you change them?\r<br />\r<br />A: Yes. This has been a problem with a few of my mods, I&#39;m not a good technical writer and I&#39;ve been doing this long enough that don&#39;t think about it anymore. If the directions are confusing let me know and I&#39;ll try to amend them accordingly.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Do you plan on adding NMM support?\r<br />\r<br />A: No. Stop asking.\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]\r<br />Permissions:==========================================[/size]\r<br />\r<br />All assets of &#34;Barbarous Beauty&#34; are public domain and are free to use as you see fit, the only thing I ask is that you message me and secure my permission before incorporating said assets into any other mods.\r<br />\r<br />This is more of a formality than anything, I consider it a point of pride that my previous assets have been worked into so many other mods and I like to keep track of where and how my work is being employed.\r<br />\r<br />If for any reason I fail to get back to you after two or three days don&#39;t hesitate to message me again, I get a lot of mail traffic and occasionally forget to respond.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]Credits:==============================================[/size]\r<br />\r<br />First off, A special thanks to &#34;Maevan2&#34; for letting me use her &#34;Mature&#34; face textures as a base for Barbarous Beauty and also to &#34;VRDaphni&#34; for doing the mojority of the beta testing for the CBBE texture sets.\r<br />\r<br />Maevan2\r<br />\r<br />VRDaphni\r<br />\r<br />Caliente\r<br />\r<br />SvarogNL\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda",
