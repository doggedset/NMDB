From all across Tamriel, traders bring their wares; happily exchanged for coin. Not all bring weapons or treasures, many bring simple items – foodstuffs and other harvested goods. For those who practice alchemy, there may be rare treasures to be found amongst the simplest of herbs.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]The Ingredients of Tamriel Project[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Contents[/b]\r<br />1.

Features[/b]\r<br />In the Ingredients of Tamriel Project, you will find 217 lore-friendly alchemical ingredients, and 8 new alchemical properties. The ingredients have been created to represent those found in the games Daggerfall, Morrowind (Inc Bloodmoon & Tribunal), The Elder Scrolls Travels series and Oblivion (inc Oblivion Mobile). Also included are some ingredients mentioned in Redguard. \r<br />Most ingredients come with new textures. At the moment, there are no new meshes. The textures have been gathered from open source images, many of them photos of real life equivalents; the ginkgo leaves texture have real ginkgo leaf photos, the chokeweed was made from photos of ‘eastern hemlock’. \r<br />\r<br />New meshes have now been added&#33; Thanks go to ChickenDownUnder&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]2.

STILL NEEDED:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Here is where YOU can be involved in the Ingredients of Tamriel Project&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I still need several ingredients from previous games for which there are no obvious meshes in game to retexture.  If you can make one, I’d love to add it to the project&#33;\r<br />See a texture in the mod you don’t like? Could you do a better job? Then please do so&#33; Make a new/better version, send it to me, and I’ll add it to the mod and give you all the credit&#33;\r<br />\r<br />So, I offer an open invite for anyone to contribute to this project&#33; Even a single new/improved texture will make this a better mod / resource&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Ingredients needed:[/b]\r<br />Daggerfall\r<br />•   Ghoul’s tongue\r<br />•   Gorgon Snake\r<br />Morrowind:\r<br />•   Coda flower\r<br />•   Cork[i]b[/i]ulb Root\r<br />Tribunal\r<br />•   Lloramor spines \r<br />•   Scrib Cabbage \r<br />Bloodmoon\r<br />•   Bristleback Leather\r<br />Oblivion\r<br />•   Aloe Vera leaves\r<br />•   Unicorn Horn\r<br />\r<br />[b]Alchemical Effects Needed:[/b]\r<br />•   Water Walking\r<br />•   Detect Life\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]5.
