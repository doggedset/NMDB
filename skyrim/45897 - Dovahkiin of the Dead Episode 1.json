You get \"Dovahkiin of the Dead.\"\r\n\r\nDovahkiin of the Dead (DoD) takes place in Skyrim where a psychotic yet loveable mage named Gary has decided to shanghai the deadliest adventurers into clearing a dungeon full of zombies. All the while, this mage enjoys sitting back and watching these unfortunate people getting mauled and eaten as he viciously mocks their efforts to survive. This he does while enjoying the sounds of bootlegged music being streamed through a rip in the space time continuum. \r\n\r\n",
