  "descriptionHtml": "This armor is for the stealth, werewolf player.\r\nIt has the textures of the fur armor and the hide boots, but it has plenty of more protection and suitable enchantments. The Armor can only be created at the Skyforge in Whiterun, but can be tempered anywhere.\r\n\r\nTo create the armor you need all of the companions armor pieces, wolf pelts and leatherstrips.\r\nTo temper the armor is a bit more expansive, you\\'ll need dragonscales and werewolf pelts.\r\n\r\nThis mod is just a test for now, but I plan to make weapons suitable to the armor if anyone is interested;)",
