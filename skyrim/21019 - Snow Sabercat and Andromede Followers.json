  "summary": "Two new companions.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod so let me know any critics and suggestion or if you have some requests.\r\n\r\nIt comes with:\r\n*A female General of the Legion like General Tulius. She works like any other companion and was based on a housecarl AI data. She can be located at  Jorrvaskr  (compatible with UFO or Extended Follower Framework or both)\r\n*A Snow sabercat.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThe Snow sabercat acts like a trained dog would, however she can talk like Barbas too. The problem is that she cannot have a follower or a pet dialogue, therefore she cannot be told to go home. If you find a way to actually give a sabercat a dialogue it would be nice to let me know.\r\nGood news is that she will act like any other follower either way. She will follow you and fight your enemies with you. (although I have noticed that she sometimes hesitate to attack Imperials or Stormcloaks until they attack you or her.)\r\nThe sabercat should follow you right away when you activate the mod but if she doesn\\'t then it means that she is at the Archmage\\'quarters in the College of Winterhold\r\n\r\nif you want the general to look like the picture does: make sure you have \r\nBetter female mod by Bella http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812and\r\nthis Hair pack mod by Newermind 43 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3809\r\n\r\nManual install if preferred. I\\'m not sure it will work normally with NMM.\r\nMake sure you have 1.6.89 patch.\r\n\r\nIt comes in two different files:\r\n*Lea.esp for the snowsaber\r\n*AndromedeLea.esp and AndromedeLea.bsa for the follower.\r\n\r\nJust delete the files to uninstall.\r\n\r\nEndorsement and feedbacks are welcome. Let me know if there is anything I can try to do to improve it.",
