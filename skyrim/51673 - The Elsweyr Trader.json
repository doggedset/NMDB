  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to the Elsweyr Trader &#33; \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/51673-1-1393755635.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />My name is Azi’Fanita, the shopkeeper of this establishment.\r<br />Inside you’ll find unique goods native from Elsweyr, or its surround provinces.   You’ll find a wide assortment of fruits, sweets, tropical weapons, tropical equipment, and much more&#33;  We are open daily from 8am to 6pm; but special clientele can receive special “after-hours” treatment.\r<br />If there is anything me [Azi’Fanita] or my husband [Ri’Nakir] can do for you, please feel free to let us know.  Here at the “Elsweyr Trader”, customer satisfaction is our top priority.\r<br />\r<br />=================================================================================\r<br />[color=red]Requirements:[/color]\r<br />This mod requires [color=yellow]HEARTHFIRE & DRAGONBORN DLCs.[/color]\r<br />--Sorry, I will NOT make a NON-DLC version.  People by now should have the DLCs, no excuses.\r<br />\r<br />=================================================================================\r<br />[color=red]Mod Description:[/color]\r<br />-This is a merchant mod that adds a handful of new merchants in a new world space\r<br />\t-Main Trader, Bakers, Butcher, Chocolatier, Cheese Chef, Delicatessen, General Goods, Skooma Addicts\r<br />-This mod only has 1 edit to existing Vanilla resources [the Worldmap location near Markarth]; so it should be compatible with just about everything out there.  The implementation to the world map was in such a way that I did not need to edit navmesh, nor disable any items [so no Deleted Navmeshes, nor UDR problems].  Mod cleaned with Tes5Edit, free of ITMs and UDRs.\r<br />-Inside you’ll find new foods, crafting stations [which give skill experience], new animals, new plant harvestables [fruit trees, plants], a close knit community made up of Khajiits and Argonians.\r<br />-2 player homes [1 free, 1 purchasable].  Also contains player teleport spell available once purchased (find inside home).  Purchased player home also contains 2 secret rooms [so go out and find them]\r<br />\t-If you want a standalone version of the purchased home: see credits for “Ancient Fortress”\r<br />-2 new blessing altars [Dwemer Warrior and Elder Mage], along with 2 new blessings.\r<br />-1 new Standing Stone [Lunar Stone; native to Elsweyr (not found in lore, but is lore friendly)].\r<br />-New farming of fruit trees/plants and moon sugar.  Can only be farmed using “Dirt Mounds” found in this mod [this was done to maintain mod compatibility].\r<br />-New Skill Books [thanks to Tamriel Rebuilt mod and XuiBooks]\r<br />-New “Trader Khajiit” Ales, new Wines.  Select wines can be aged for extra potent abilities.\r<br />-New Cheese Aging system [for cheeses added by this mod].  See “Cheese Factory”.\r<br />-Milkable “Cows” and “Goats”; milk used for drinking, cooking, cheese crafting.\r<br />-Unique Dwemer Artifacts – “Dwemer Vending Artifacts” [automated vending machines], “Dwemer Compiler Artifact” [allows player to combine lower powered potions to create higher power potions].\r<br />-Multi-use Mills that creates Bonemeal, crushed gems [new ingredients].\r<br />-Dynamic Lights - sunlight turns off during the evening; lanterns switch on at night\r<br />-Plus more&#33;\r<br />======================================================================================\r<br />[color=red]Location[/color]\r<br />Just outside of the Markarth farm area\r<br />--See map location in the &#34;Image&#34; section\r<br />\r<br />======================================================================================\r<br />[color=red] Player Home - Locations[/color]\r<br />There are 2 player homes; 1 free; the other can be purchased for 25,000 gold.\r<br />--The free home is the Windmill located in the &#34;Elsweyr Working Sector&#34;\r<br />--The purchasable home is the &#34;Ancient Dwemer Fortress&#34;; interact with the &#34;For Sale&#34; sign which is located on a column near the front door fo the home.  Once purcahsed, you can find a &#34;Teleport Spell&#34; in the library which allows you to teleport directly to your home.\r<br />\r<br />======================================================================================\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Tips/Hints[/color]\r<br />\r<br />-Cheese aging times: 2 days, 4 days, 8 days\r<br />-Wine aging times: 3 days, 9 days, 27 days\r<br />-Farming: plants take 3 days to grow; 3 days to replenish\r<br />-Check with the main trader [Azi’Fanita] for purchasable items; she will sell items not craftable nor sold by other merchants; this includes special items: Sultan Dagger, Mane Mead, Beast Pellets, etc…\r<br />======================================================================================\r<br />[color=red]Compatibility[/color]\r<br />This mod should be compatible with everything.\r<br />This is because almost everything in my mod is added as a &#34;new item&#34;; I did not edit existing resources.  The downside to this is that if you want to farm/craft materials in my mod, then it has to be done in the Elsweyr Trading hub.\r<br />--Note:  This is not the case with recipes added to Hearthfire Ovens, Bamboo Arrows at the Forge, and the few foods added to Cooking Pots; because new constructables objects don&#39;t interfere with other mods.\r<br />=======================================================================================\r<br />[color=red]Uninstallation[/color]\r<br />--Do NOT uninstall if you are not starting a new game; this mod contains scripts.\r<br />\r<br />--If you are upgrading, just uninstall the old and install the new version.\r<br />--If you are switching between the Full and 512 version, follow the same proceedure as if upgrading.\r<br />\r<br />=======================================================================================\r<br />[color=red]Uses and Permissions:[/color]\r<br />-Anything credited that I used with permission cannot be used by others, without the original authors permission.\r<br />-Anything from a modders resource can be used by others; as long as you credit the author of the resource.\r<br />-Anything created by me can be used freely; just credit me (you do not need to ask, just credit in your mod).\r<br />-Needs patches can be created without seeking my permission.  I will create an IMCN Needs patch [since I use IMCN], but other needs mods will have to be created by other modders or mod users.\r<br />======================================================================================\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Updating/Mod Usage:[/color]\r<br />-I will update this mod when I can.  Updates will come in the form of an updated ESP; thus you will not need to download my entire mod again; however I cannot make nor hold any promises to this.\r<br />-There is one exception to my updates.  After the date of July 2014, I will be PERMANENTLY and INDEFINITELY absent from modding/gaming.  Thus, after July 2014, support will have to come from other fellow modders.  This is why the below is relevant.\r<br />-Since this mod contains resources used with permission, I CANNOT make this a “Free-to-Use” mod. \r<br />-However, I give permission for anyone to release “ESP Replacers” of my mod.  This is so you can create your own version of my mod to share, or you can fix bugs/glitches you found in my mod.  “ESP Replacers” can be hosted on your own mod page:  Nexus, STEAM, etc..\r<br />-You may include your own resources with your edit:  custom textures/meshes/sounds/scripts/etc.  You may NOT EDIT NOR UPLOAD custom edits of my BSA file.  You may add text/mesh that alter my files, but they must overwrite my BSA.\r<br />-In other words, you can add any files you want to my mod; as long as any edits/additions require my mod as a base.\r<br />\tExample:\r<br />\t\t-Download my mod and install\r<br />\t\t-Download custom “ESP Replacer”, install, say yes to overwrite my files.\r<br />-You may NOT create an “ESP Replacer” that removes the DLC requirements; no bypassing of the Dragonborn/Hearthfire requirements.  You may create an “ESP Replacer” that further requires Dawnguard [or any other masters].  Again, you can add anything you want; you just can’t remove stuff.\r<br />=====================================================================================\r<br />[color=red]Closing Notes[/color]:\r<br />-Lastly, if you are a mod creator, I urge you to please include instructions on what should happen with your mod IF you are not available.  \r<br />It is irritating to me that mod creators [not all] are more interested in creating permissions that exclude people from using their mods; rather than thinking ahead in the future when an event will arise where that author is no longer around.  Thus, when an author disappears, their mod eventually dies [as it cannot be updated nor fixed, since permissions exclude it].\r<br />This is why I applaud mod creators like InsanitySorrow and Arthmoor; since their mods contain clauses that ensure they will stay active even in their absence.\r<br />======================================================================================\r<br />[color=red]FAQ[/color]\r<br />Q:  I don&#39;t like Azi&#39;Fanita&#39;s accent.\r<br />--Answer:  did you read her diary located in the &#34;Trader Residence&#34; ?\r<br />\r<br />Q:  When I walk into the basement, I hear werewolves howling.\r<br />--Answer:  That&#39;s from the raptor, which is a modified werewolf.  I tried my best, but could not figure out how to disable the howl.  If anyone knows please share.\r<br />\r<br />Q:  But RND is better and more popular than IMCN, you should make a RND patch.\r<br />--Answer: No, actually you can.  I don&#39;t use RND, so go ahead and make a patch for it [anyone has my permission to make needs patches].\r<br />\r<br />Q:  Pretty please&#33;  Can you make a non-DLC version?\r<br />--Answer: Nope; only true children of Skyrim have all the DLCs.\r<br />\r<br />Q:  Why is the file download so large?  Can you reduce the size?\r<br />--Answer: Be aware this mod is mainly composed of new content added by modder&#39;s resources and other mods.  Thus, such content must be downloaded as it does not exist in the vanilla game.\r<br />With that being said, I can say the original &#34;uncompressed&#34; BSA size was 700+MB.  However, I ran the BSA thru &#34;BSAOpt&#34; and was able to compress the BSA to around 370MB.  \r<br />--Thus, what you download here is basically the size it will be on your harddrive.  Sorry, 7zip could not further compress the file-size; yes I tried many times.\r<br />--Be happy, any updates I release will be of the ESP only.  Thus, updates will be around 2 MB.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />======================================================================================\r<br />[color=red]Special Thanks[/color]\r<br />Thanks to [color=yellow]Tonycubed2[/color], and [color=yellow]Sjogga[/color] for scripting help; couldn&#39;t have done it without your help.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to all the mod authors who have created modder&#39;s resources for the community to use, and thanks to those who have given me permission to use their mod.\r<br />\r<br />======================================================================================\r<br />[color=red]Credits:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]Modder’s Resources:[/color]\r<br />--Ancient Fortress -- Ultimate Player Home by Lynkx: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41620]skyrim/mods/41620[/url]\r<br />--URW -
