Feel free to upload any screenshot you want. :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7401/14122791144_f51db31428_o.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />“Arelyl was born in the ashlands of Solstheim in the shelter of the great Bulwark of Ravenrock. Her parents were of a humble Dunmer \r<br />family that once lived on the island of Vvanderfell before they were driven out by the fires of Red Mountain. She was of the rare children \r<br />to face the harsh life of the island, surviving on ash yams and what meat and fish her family could get, but she was hardy enough to grow \r<br />strong in such a place. From a young age her parents knew she was strong and determined, rarely complaining about the tasks she had to do and \r<br />rarely seeming to tire. Even though life was tough, Arelyl never lost her friendly spirit to the gloom of the ash.\r<br />\r<br />Her parents saw the spirit of a warrior in her, though they feared her becoming a guard of the city, facing the denizens of the ash, so they \r<br />made sure she had someone to train her in the ways of battle so she would be safe. It was no surprise to them that she excelled in her training, \r<br />learning to wield a one handed blade with grace and skill, she had fire to her like that of the distant mountain that rose above the shores of \r<br />the sea. Eventually she became a bodyguard to one of those of house Redoran, the bandits among the ashes learning a harsh lesson at the tip of her blade.\r<br />\r<br />Some years later a shadows darken than even the ashen clouds above the city drifted to the island, a presence that unsettled the people of the city. \r<br />Arelyl wished she could fight that feeling but it was no foe of flesh and blood easily dispatched by her blade. She watched as other Dunmer fell under \r<br />the spell of a voice that whispered among the ash storms, her fiery side woke when she saw this. Hearing the tales of the Dragonborn wandering the lands \r<br />of Skyrim she thought this hero might be able to help her fight the hidden foe of the island. She made the long journey across the cold sea to the shores \r<br />near Windhelm with what coin she had made as a bodyguard. She found a cold welcome in the city though those who spoke hateful words learned how unwise that was. \r<br />Now she awaits word in Candlehearth hall of a mighty adventurer, perhaps one will find her in that hall, one she will find worthy to stand with.”\r<br />by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/209736/]Kamikazekossori[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Videos/Features:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]WGOFDedC-JE[/youtube]    [youtube]-LF1EGaVFXA[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />thanks a lot\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7343/13935801619_94cecb0b17_o.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />This mod add a standalone follower to the game, based on my main character Arelyl. \r<br />She&#39;s a Dark Elf female, vanilla voice, 1 Handed warrior with her own perks (she also have light foot) and her own body shape: \r<br />she is available for UNPB, CBBE and SevenBase\r<br />\r<br />What &#34;standalone&#34; mean?\r<br />You don&#39;t need any additional mod to run this one.\r<br />Everything you need is already there.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7380/14122789614_687743a62b_o.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Arelyl is located in Windhelm, at the Candlehearth Hall.\r<br />She should be there around the bard enjoying the music.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7314/14122790034_343260cb79_o.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />NMM highly raccomanded, just click on the big green button (download with manager) to install the mod.\r<br />If you like to do it manually, Un-zip and copy/paste the contents of the &#34;data&#34; folder in your skyrim Data directory.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Warning:[/b]\r<br />i won&#39;t add any BBP, TBBP or anything.
