  "summary": "Edits the weight of a few items to free up more carry weight",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod edits the weights of basic health, stamina, and magicka potions; dragon bones and scales; firewood; pickaxes; and woodcutter\\'s axe.\r\n\r\nI made this to complement Frostfall since I would normally carry about 12 to 18 firewood with me at all times, and in normal vanilla weights, that is 60 to 90 lbs of inventory weight, which limits how long you can adventure without going back to sell stuff, and at low levels, that is about 1/4 to 1/3 your inventory space.\r\n\r\nWeights:\r\nPotions: .1 - .6 depending on strength (originally .5 for all)\r\nDragon Bones: 10 (originally 15)\r\nDragon Scales: 5 (originally 10)\r\nFirewood: 1 (originally 5)\r\nPickaxe: 5 (originally 10)\r\nWoodcutter\\'s Axe: 5 (originally 10)\r\n\r\n\r\n*I\\'m also uploading this since I made it on my laptop and have recently upgraded to a desktop. I may release a greater weight overhaul that looks to complement Frostfall more if I get around to it.\r\n",
