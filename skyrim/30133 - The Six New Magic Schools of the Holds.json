  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/nN9PANg.jpg?2[/img]\r<br />\r<br />***Don&#39;t forget to rate and comment&#33;*** \r<br />\r<br />Are you a mage? Would you like more mage-oriented content? If so, here&#39;s more&#33; \r<br />\r<br />The College of Winterhold offers a somewhat short, easily resolved quest which offers little in magic gameplay. With this MOD, joining the College grants you access to their newly opened schools in the Holds, more trainers, merchants and training facilities. \r<br />\r<br />Included: \r<br />\r<br />- 6 new schools, with a design different from the vanilla game, following their Holds lore. Each is completely navmeshed and totally follower-friendly. \r<br />- A complete history of the schools&#39; creations, detailing the beginings of a conflict with the Sons of the North (separate addon). \r<br />\r<br />Update Dec. 13th:\r<br />\r<br />Voice-Over Work for Fast-White-Clouds, his quest is still incomplete however.\r<br />Voice-Over work  for Aranthil.\r<br />Clutter and Navmesh improvements.\r<br />\r<br />***Also added again as an optional plug-in the Sons and Daughters of the North, an enemy faction of the College of Winterhold. They will no longer attack the College itself, but instead have been placed around the towns as random encounters, but also added to enemy lists.\r<br />\r<br />Update Feb. 8 2015: \r<br />\r<br />- Modifications in the schools of Falkreath, Whiterun and Markarth. More design and more clutter. \r<br />- Fixed some navmesh issues \r<br />- AI packages will now work properly in Riften, and NPCs will use their beds and sleep like they&#39;re supposed to. \r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Simply download the plugin and activate it in your launcher.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />\r<br />Compatible with all mods, unless they specifically modify the land where I built the schools. Compatible with any mods affecting Spells or the College itself.\r<br />\r<br />To uninstall:\r<br />\r<br />Make sure you are not in one of the schools (or have a school in your line of sight) and deactivate then delete the plugin.\r<br />\r<br />************************************************************************************************************************************************** \r<br />\r<br />TO BE NOTED \r<br />\r<br />To everyone who downloaded this mod, only to be grieved by the attacks of the barbarian faction on the College, I apologize. My intentions were to make the game more challenging, not to kill quest givers. Also, after a few hours of testing and only mild difficulties to defeat the warring bands, I clearly underestimated their impact on the world. Thus, I removed them completely from this mod. At the moment, the mod is comprised solely of the added schools. I will try and implement different minor quests in each schools, but the Sons of the North will not re-appear in this Addon. I will create a new mod to polish them and upload that once finished.\r<br />\r<br />Known-issue: The quest in the Whiterun faction is not completed. Simply put: don&#39;t do it, as I&#39;m trying to find someone to help complete the quest line, someone with more experience.\r<br />\r<br />3. There should be no conflict with others MODS, even those improving the College itself like &#39;&#39;TEG the Wizards of Winterhold&#39;&#39;. The only conflicts could happen with MODS related to the specific areas in the Holds where I built the schools... \r<br />\r<br />4. The locations of the schools are usually close to the major towns... Keep looking&#33; =)",
