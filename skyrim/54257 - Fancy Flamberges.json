  "descriptionHtml": "It hit me a couple of hours ago ( 9:14 am, May 22, 2014, mark this please) that there aren&#39;t any Flamberges in Skyrim. I know that there is a Dark Souls Flamberge mod out there, but I wanted something a bit more practical.\r<br />\r<br />I took the mesh of the Iron Claymore, because I love it so much, and I modified it.\r<br />I adjusted the blade by adding a few *cough* extra polies and moved them to add a jagged effect.\r<br />I adjusted the cross guard, made it look a bit more useful and added some of those guard rings.\r<br />I altered the pommel by making it round, to further balance the sword.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve made 2 different meshes, one for the 2 handed version, and the other for the 1-handed version.\r<br />They do a tad more damage than the normal iron weapons and swing ever so slightly faster. (Claymore and Sword)\r<br />\r<br />The swords currently use the Iron Claymore&#39;s textures, so any texture packs altering those with alter these. I plan in the future that I will do something and make a unique texture.\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to give feedback, I&#39;ve used the best of my knowledge of swords when making these, and kept the fantasy aspect there somewhere.\r<br />\r<br />Everyone is welcome to post their own screenies.\r<br />\r<br />Side Note: I know my Claymore of Heroes wasn&#39;t my best example of a sword, but here&#39;s the link if you want to check that out too: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37571\r<br />Also, with some editing of .nif files, you can give the Flamberges the texture of the Claymore of Heroes. I&#39;d like to see what that looks like.\r<br />\r<br />Tools used:\r<br />NifSkope\r<br />Milkshape3d\r<br />Of course, The Creation Kit",
