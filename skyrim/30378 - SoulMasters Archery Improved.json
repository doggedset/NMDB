  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/Logo5a_zpsb8d0980d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/Title1_zps2f3d7124.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nA few of the Archery Perks have been enhanced to improve your game experience!\r\nEnhanced Eagle Eye - Now has much greater zoom and uses 75% less Stamina\r\nI always thought it was odd that you didn\\'t get back all the arrows you had fired into a body?\r\nNow with Enhanced Hunter\\'s Discipline that problem is solved! You always get back 100% of your arrows.\r\nAlso I have increased the movement speed for when you have your bow drawn with Enhanced Ranger!\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/EagleEyea_zpsdf71c36c.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/EagleEye1_zps00ab385d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/EagleEye2_zps438b9698.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/Perk1_zpsdc609ac0.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/HunterDisca_zpsb7f0717a.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/Perk2_zpscac9ecf3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/Rangera_zps3d647bc5.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00]Installation:\r\nFor easy installation download and install with Nexus Mod Manager.\r\nTo install manually copy the downloaded .esm file into your Skyrim\\\\data folder.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=red]Version History:\r\nV1.0 Initial release\r\nV1.1 Removed additional text added in perks (Enhanced by SoulMaster)[/color]\r\n\r\nI hope you find this mod useful?
