  "descriptionHtml": "----------Features-------------------------------\r\n       This mod spawns an essential Ebony Warrior who is a potential follower in Whiterun. He carries an additional set of ebony weapon, armor, ring, amulet and spell books for those who want to role play as him. \r\n\r\n        There is also a Shine of Legendary Warrior near Arcadia\\'s Cauldron which will grant you the blessing of Legendary Warrior. This blessing will increase your health by 1371 points,  increase your stamina by 114 points,  increase your magica by 100 points so that you can achieve the same stats as Ebony Warrior (2071/364/250) at level 81. \r\n\r\n-------------Motivation----------------------\r\nTo beat ebony warrior in a fair fight, one has to become ebony warrior himself. This can be achieved by wearing the same equipment as ebony warrior, using the same spell as ebony warrior, taking the same perks as ebony warrior and having the same stats as ebony warrior. \r\n\r\nHowever, Extra Damage 3 perk is not available to player and with Armsman perk and one-handed 100, players can only achieve 3x one-handed weapon damage (9x for ebony warrior). Therefore, it is recommended to improve your weapon damage to 3x.\r\n\r\nor you can use my extradamage perk mod:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/44224/?] Extra Damage Perk for Player[/url]\r\n\r\n-------------Compatibility------------\r\nnone for now.\r\n\r\n--------------Requirement-----------------\r\nDragonborn DLC is required.\r\n Skyrim update 1.9 is recommended.\r\n\r\n--------------Changelog---------------------------\r\nv2: fix the issue that the blessing of Legendary Warrior can coexist with other blessings.",
