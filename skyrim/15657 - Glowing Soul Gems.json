If anyone knows how to please let me know.)\r\n\r\n- Conflicts with mods that change filled soul gems in any way (even if it changes its name, such as Headbombs Better Sorting. To fix this, just go into CK and change name and weight in Glowing Soul Gems.esp to match that of Headbomb\\'s, or any other mod.)[/b]",
