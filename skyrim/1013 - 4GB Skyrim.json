  "descriptionHtml": "[color=FF8C00]I have tested this file using Virus total - It tests using over 40 different virus detectors. It has come up clean. Many Antivirus programs will automatically flag a file with an unknown .exe as a possible virus. That does not mean there is a virus, just that that particular .exe is not known to that particular AV program. \r\nBben46, Moderator[/color]\r\n\r\nREAD THIS FIRST\r\n--------------\r\nThis mod contains an executable which is designed to make changes to other programs. That\\'s exactly what it is supposed to do, make changes in \\\"TESV.exe\\\". But it may well get flagged by your anti-virus program as potentially dangerous. While it will be a false positive, If you are not comfortable using such a mod, please don\\'t.\r\n\r\nSkyrim 4GB\r\n==========\r\nby MonochromeWench (the.wench@wenchy.net)\r\n\r\nSkyrim4GB is a tool to load Skyrim with the Large Address Aware \r\nexecutable flag set so the entire 4GB Virtual Memory Address Space can be used\r\nby the game.\r\n\r\nThis is my \\'official\\' port of my tool that did the same to Fallout NV.\r\n\r\nSkyrim4GB is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License \r\nversion 2.1. Read the included lgpl-2.1.txt for the terms. Source code is included\r\nwith the package. Original binaries compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTE: Make sure you do not have a modified TESV.exe file. If your file is modified you will not be able to run the game. If yours is modified right click on Skyrim and get properies. On the Local Files tab click Verify Integrity of Game Cache. Steam will then check for modified files and redownload them as necessary.\r\n\r\nIf you get an Access Denied error make sure your TESV.exe isn\\'t \\\"read only\\\". If the \\\"read only\\\" attribute is  set on TESV.exe then it gets copied onto LAA exe that Skyrim4GB creates. When Skyrim4GB attempts to set the LAA flag on the copied exe file an Access Denied error occurs when opening the file. I\\'ll fix this in the next version.\r\n\r\nUpdate Details\r\n--------------\r\n1.5 \r\n\r\nFixed at least one case that was causing people to get Access Denied error \r\nmessages.\r\n\r\nChanged the default laaexe to be \\'.\\\\exes\\\\TESV.exe\\' instead of \\'TESV.exe.4gb\\'.\r\nThis is so people don\\'t have issues with other programs detecting when Skyrim \r\nruns.\r\n\r\nUpdated the code so it wont fail if the original exe already had the LAA flag \r\nset as will apparently happen in the next Skyrim patch. If the LAA flag is \r\nalready set, the loader will NOT create a modified executable. It will directly\r\nrun the original exe without modifications while still injecting skse and extra\r\ndlls specified with -extradll.\r\n\r\nAdded -nolaa command line options. If the original exe didn\\'t have the LAA flag\r\nthe loader will directly load the original exe without modifications while \r\nstill injecting other dlls. If the original exe had the LAA flag set, then a \r\nmodified exe will be generated with the LAA flag unset and that will then be \r\nrun by the loader.\r\n\r\n1.4\r\n\r\nGenerally cleaned up the code. \r\n\r\nRewrote how the helper dll is injected into the child process. Moved helper dll\r\ncode out of DLLMain into its own function that gets called after the DLL has \r\nfinished being loaded. I want to avoid the possibility of issues with the \r\nWindows DLL Loader Lock.\r\n\r\nSkyrim4GB now accepts a variety of command line parameters to control what it \r\ndoes. See the Command Line Reference below for details.\r\n\r\n1.3\r\n\r\nThe loader now prints out details of what it is doing.\r\n\r\nIt also now attempts to check if TESV.exe has been modified. If the exe is \r\ndetected as modified it will tell you, instructing you to get Steam to validate\r\nthe cache.\r\n\r\nThe loader will no longer wait for TESV.exe.4gb to exit before it exits itself.\r\n\r\nThe helper dll will now attempt to hook GetModuleFileNameA, if possible, to \r\ndisguise what exe is actually loaded. If that hook fails it will fallback to\r\nthe older CreateFileA hook.\r\n\r\n1.2\r\n\r\nSkyrim4GB will attempt to load the SKSE loader (skse_steam_loader.dll).\r\n\r\nSkyrim4GB no longer hooks GetTickCount(). \r\n\r\n1.1\r\n\r\nMade some code changes that \\'may\\' improve things for some people. Now checks \r\nthe Bethesda Softworks\\\\Skyrim and Valve\\\\Steam paths for the installation \r\ndirectory.\r\n\r\nAlso will now write out a log file to ~\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Skyrim4GB.log\r\nthat outputs some debugging information that may help track down why it doesn\\'t\r\nwork for some people.\r\n\r\nIf you are getting Steam Application load error 3:0000065432 messages then \r\nplease post the log contents to the discussion thread so I can see whats going\r\non.\r\n\r\nAlso compiled the new version with Visual Studio 2010. This may or may not make\r\nany difference.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nExtract the archive to anywhere you want. You don\\'t need to do anything in paricular.\r\n\r\nRunning\r\n-------\r\nFirst, make sure Steam is running. Then run Skyrim4GB.exe to launch the game! \r\nYou don\\'t even need it in the games directory, just make sure skyrim4gb.exe and\r\nskyrim4gb_helper.dll are together.\r\n\r\nIf your version of Skyrim is not the standard version with the\r\nSteamAppID of 72850 you need to run Skyrim4gb.exe and specify the actual \r\nSteamAppID on the command line. Example: Skyrim4gb.exe 72850\r\n\r\n\r\nCommand Line Reference\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nSkyrim4GB.exe [-exe string] [-laaexe string] [-SteamAppID number] [-noskse]\r\n              [-extradll string [-extradll string [...]]] [-- game parameters]\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n-exe        The games original executable. If not an absolute path Skyrim4GB\r\n            will look for the executable in the Skyrim directory using paths\r\n\t\t\tthat should be in the registry. \r\n\t\t\tDefault is TESV.exe.\r\n\r\n-laaexe     The executable created by the loader that has the LAA flag set. \r\n            This must not be the same file as the original executable. \r\n\t\t\t* If this is an absolute path the file will be created using that \r\n\t\t\t  exact path.\r\n\t\t\t* If the path starts with .\\\\ the exe will be created relative to \r\n\t\t\t  the directory containg Skyrim4GB.\r\n\t\t\t* Otherwise it will be created relative to the original executable.\r\n\t\t\tDefault is the original exe with .4gb appended to the end\r\n\r\n-SteamAppID The SteamAppID id to use. Default is 72850\r\n\r\n-nolaa      Don\\'t set the LAA flag or unset it if it was already set in the \r\n            original executable. \r\n\r\n-noskse     Disable attempting to load SKSE (Skyrim Script Extender)\r\n\r\n-extradll   An extra dll to load into the laaexe process after its been \r\n            created. This can be specified multiple times to load more than one\r\n\t\t\tdll.\r\n\r\n--          Anything after this will be passed as is to the game when the \r\n            loader creates the process.\r\n[/code]\r\nExamples\r\n\r\nSkyrim4GB.exe -laaexe .\\\\TESV.exe\r\n    Create a LAA Exe called TESV.exe in the directory containing Skyrim4GB. \r\n\tThis is probably what you\\'d want to do if you need some other application\r\n\tto detect TESV.exe loading, not TESV.exe.4gb\r\n\r\nSkyrim4GB.exe -exe \\\"C:\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\fallout new vegas\\\\FalloutNV.exe\\\" -laaexe .\\\\FalloutNV.exe -SteamAppID 22380 -noskse\r\n    Run a completely different game using the loader. In this case Fallout NV \r\n\twith SKSE disabled because thats just not going to work with FalloutNV.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
