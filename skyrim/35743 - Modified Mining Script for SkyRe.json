  "descriptionHtml": "I hate mining.  It\\'s slow.  It\\'s tedious.  And it never gives you enough ore to do anything with, especially in SkyRe, where you need 3 pieces of ore to make an ingot instead of 2.  Add to that the fact that I like to play with all my starting skills at zero using Epic Glory (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12140), and it becomes even more tedious just to get smithing to 15 so I can temper an iron dagger :p\r\n\r\nSo I made this script to change that.\r\n\r\nThis script is just the SkyRe mining script with two small changes:\r\n\r\n1) The amount of ore that you normally receive per ore vein is 3, spaced out over 9 whacks with your pickaxe.  Every three whacks, you\\'d get one ore.  This script changes it so that every three whacks, you get 10% of your Smithing skill in ore, rounded down, with a minimum of one piece.  \r\n\r\nEx:  1 Smithing = 1 ore, 10 Smithing = 1 ore, 25 Smithing = 2 ore, 58 Smithing = 5 ore, 100 Smithing = 10 ore, etc.\r\n\r\n2) In the SkyRe mining script, you gain 2 smithing xp each time you get a piece of ore (4 xp for a gem).  In this version, you get slightly more xp at the beginning, and less over time as your skill increases.  The formula is now:  10 / [# pieces of ore gained] (x2 for gems).  \r\n\r\nSo, 0 Smithing = 10 xp, 15 Smithing = 10 xp, 28 Smithing = 5 xp, 55 Smithing = 2 xp, 100 Smithing = 1 xp, etc.  \r\n\r\nHaving over 100 in Smithing means you will no longer get experience from mining ore.  Experience from mining gems caps at 200.\r\n",
