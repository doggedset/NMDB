  "descriptionHtml": "[left][b][u]The LARP group from Elsie, Michigan together in Skyrim&#33; (With LARP style equipment).[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This is the LARP (live action role play) group that I am apart of. I figure &#39;hey, why not add our role playing group to a role playing game&#39; and this mod was born. I&#39;m still a noob modder, so be gentle ;)\r<br />\r<br />The group (all five followers) can be found in Frostfruit Inn in Rorikstead. They are wearing prisoner rags as default clothing, but they should equip their LARPing gear after you recruit them. They will also use any armor or weapons you give them as their larp gear does no damage and has no armor rating.\r<br />\r<br />For best experience I recommend a multiple follower mod (I use UFO), but it is not necessary. Also, in order for them to actually LARP (which, if they use their larp gear will result in no deaths) you need to hit some or all w/a Fury spell, and use a Calm spell to make them stop.\r<br />\r<br />They are completely vanilla and thus super compatible. \r<br />\r<br />Feel free to criticize, comment, question, and troll me as I can handle all of it. If you do the latter I will ignore you. -_-\r<br />\r<br />Also, feel free to donate... PSYCHE&#33; This should always and forever be frreeee.&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]JZpjqvtj5ss[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ll upload some screenshots in a bit but right now rest i must....\r<br />\r<br />https://www.facebook.com/groups/932315783485560/ Our LARP Facebook page...[/left]",
