  "descriptionHtml": "GHOSU - Zahkrii Do Dovahkiin\r\n\r\nThis is an UNFINISHED MOD, free to use modders resource - based on this thread:\r\n[url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/937167-zahkrii-do-dovahkiin-hidden-dlc-dragonborn-sword]http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/937167-zahkrii-do-dovahkiin-hidden-dlc-dragonborn-sword[/url]\r\n\r\n[youtube]vDBnT_zx_CM[/youtube]\r\n\r\nThe normal sword models without shout effect might work for regular users as well, see below!\r\n\r\nI had to quit modding half a year ago, though i\\'m releasing my WIP files of this mod - NOTHING IS FINISHED, i guess the current state is around 70% done but maybe someone wants to continue my work OR use some files.\r\n\r\nThe data and CK form structure is quite chaotic, i have my own way of modding and it would take hours to sort it out for the public - time i can\\'t spend.\r\nI just had a few minutes to upload the whole stuff, some CK forms and files are just placeholders and/or not finished, texture/3D topology needs some tuning, the 1h glow effect is not implented yet and so on. PLEASE don\\'t download if you have no clue \\'bout modding, i can\\'t fix/finish is or explain details since i\\'m quite busy.\r\n\r\nIf you are just a regular user you might (!) install it like a common mod - and MAYBE (!) the sword models work. Afaik it should work without any DLC/Addons. Open console and enter HELP ZAHKRII as shown in the screenshot, afterwards enter PLAYER.ADDITEM CODE 1   . The code is listed next to each item\\'s name and 1 = amount\r\n\r\nI guess the models work BUT you should avoid using the shout/glow effect since it\\'s not finished. The mod was created 6 months ago with an old version of CK/game, so i\\'m not even sure if it works. No time to try it so i would recommend only to download if you are an experienced modder and know how to handle it, i don\\'t guarantee anything!\r\n\r\nSorry that i couldn\\'t finish it but real life first...maybe someone can use my files, won\\'t harm anyone and it\\'s better than nothing so please don\\'t complain if you can\\'t use it - this is no final mod.\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nGhosu",
