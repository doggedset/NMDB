  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/61999-1-1422204259.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]First, take a [b]deep breath and calm yourself down[/b] (it&#39;s important). Try to take your time and do not rush for a while.[/color] Do you feel the harmony inside? Now you have the Great Power of reading the description and not asking obvious questions in the Comments page.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=red][u]Note:[/u] [/color][/b]This mod requires a lot of patience. You have been warned.\r<br />\r<br />In the vanilla game most shouts are weaker than the master spells, so there is no point of using the Voice most of the times. Shouts are also ineffective against high-level enemies.  This mod aims to temporary make most of the shouts devastating with respect to balance.\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=red]Note:[/color] [/u]Some users claim that the concept will conflict with the lore, but I still can&#39;t understand why? There are ways in the vanilla game to modify the magnitute and duration of the effects provided by Thu&#39;um. If you have something to say, don&#39;t forget to provide the prooflink to the material.\r<br />[url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Meditations_on_the_Words_of_Power]Meditations on the Words of Power[/url]\r<br />[url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Book:_Epistolary_Acumen]Hidden Knowledge of Epistolary Acumen will alter your shouts[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4][color=yellow]How to use?[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />A complete video guide ([u]turn the volume down[/u] before watching, enable the annotations):\r<br />[youtube]w7b8DXaOI0s[/youtube]\r<br /> \r<br />Meditate and master your voice in some lonely place to gain Focus\r<br />\r<br />1) Stand in some open space with [u]no living creatures nearby[/u] (mountains are the best candidates)\r<br />2) Make a Shout\r<br />3) Stay in place, [i]do not move or change the direction[/i] (better not to touch mouse or controller)\r<br />4) Make a Shout again, you should recieve Focus\r<br />\r<br />[i]No Focus?

It also will monitor your actions in game.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Avoid [color=yellow][u]damage[/u][/color][/b][color=yellow].[/color] A single hit will remove focus. Self-harming (Falling damage) will force you to lose focus only if health is below 70%\r<br />[b]Be [color=yellow][u]deliberate[/u].[/color][/b] Avoid panic in combat. Avoid rough movements. Keep your direction or turn your camera smoothly.\r<br />[b]Don&#39;t [color=yellow][u]rush[/u][/color][/b][color=yellow].[/color] Take your time to walk or stay in place to keep focus.\r<br />[b]Equip items with a [color=yellow][u]reason[/u][/color][/b][color=yellow],[/color] do not equip / unequip too many items at once.\r<br />[b]Keep your [color=yellow][u]stamina [/u][/color]high[/b]. The lower your stamina the easier for you to lose focus.\r<br />[b]Avoid drinking [color=yellow][u]potions [/u]or eating [u]food [/u][/color][/b](70% chance of losing the focus completely)\r<br />[b]Avoid [color=yellow][u]sleep[/u][/color][/b]\r<br />  \r<br />As you can see, there is no time limit, but it&#39;s actually very hard to keep focus. All the souls will be lost when you lose Focus, so you won&#39;t be able to use this ability often.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4][size=4]Compatibility and Requirements[/size][/size]\r<br />[/b]\r<br />SKSE is [u]NOT [/u]required\r<br />This mod doesn&#39;t alter anything in the vanilla game\r<br />Yes, it&#39;s compatible with [i]PerMa[/i], [i]SkyRe[/i], you name it\r<br />Yes, it&#39;s compatible with mods that[i] modify the vanilla shouts[/i]\r<br />All the shouts that have magnitude or duration can become stronger (even the shouts provided by other mods)\r<br />\r<br />Should be safe to uninstall after you lose Focus",
