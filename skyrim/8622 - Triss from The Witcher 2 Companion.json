  "descriptionHtml": "I Will NOT respond to you anymore if your problem is that Triss doesn\\'t have a head. Get the right file from the Ultimate Witcher mod. That is your fix. You don\\'t need the main file, there is an optional support file for this mod specifically. Get that one.\r\n\r\nPlease endorse if you like this mod!! Please leave feedback and/or suggestions in the comments.\r\n\r\n1.2 Update (You should remove things you care about from her inventory and then tell her to \\\"part ways\\\" with you before upgrading)\r\n> New face mesh and textures. It should no longer be shiny in bright areas anymore. \r\n\r\n1.1 Update (before updating you should take everything out of her inventory)\r\n>Moved her to the INN in Riverwood to try and fix a recruitment bug.\r\n>Gave her flames and a healing spell\r\n\r\n[b]Intro:[/b]\r\nThis mod adds Triss to the INN in Riverwood.\r\nIt\\'s my first release, though it should be fairly bug free as it uses the already in place bethesda companion system - for now.I have plans to greatly expand her, but I just wanted to get this uploaded and she seems to be fully functioning companion similar to all the other bethesda ones. An important note: She currently doesn\\'t have lip syncing.\r\n\r\n[b]Installation:[/b]\r\nInstalling with NMM should be easiest. For manual users just take the contents (the .esp and the texture and meshes folder) and drop them into skyrim\\'s data folder. Then enable the .esp in either the manager or under data files. She will greet you when you enter the INN in riverwood. \r\n\r\n[b]Required Files: (You\\'ll get a floating head or no head at all or completely invisible if you don\\'t get these!!)[/b]\r\nthe main texture and meshes from Fraper and the ALTERNATE FILE from AlphaWolf.\r\nFraper: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5135]Triss Outfit[/url] \r\nAlphaWolf:[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9198]Ultimate Witcher Mod[/url]\r\n(the .esp\\'s aren\\'t necessary if you don\\'t want them)\r\n\r\nI recommend you play with the Ultimate Witcher Mod linked above. Nothing like playing as Geralt and having triss following you around through skyrim. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Permissions:[/b]\r\nThis is mostly a collection of works from other people (all used with permission) so if you want to use some part of this mod, you need to seek out the people in the credits and ask for their permission before releasing anything.\r\n\r\n[b]Thanks:[/b]\r\nCDProjekt Red for TW2 and giving everyone permission to use their assets in mods. \r\nBethesda\r\nFraper for porting over Triss\\'s outfit.\r\nAlphaWolF for porting Triss\\'s head.\r\n",
