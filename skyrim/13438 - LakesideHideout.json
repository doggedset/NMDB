  "descriptionHtml": "My first attempt at a small house that has all you need. It was a good learning experience working with the creation kit, and I may or may not update this house as I realize it\\'s not perfect, nor is it the most aesthetically pleasing house to choose from.\r\n\r\nThe house entrance can be found on an island in the middle of a lake slightly north of Falkreath. The door is in the side of a rock-face and is stone, so it doesn\\'t stick out like a sore thumb.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions of things that I could work on in the house, feel free to leave a comment! \r\n\r\nP.S.    I do realaize that the ebony rocks in the mine do not currently function as they should, but I may look into that in the near future.",
