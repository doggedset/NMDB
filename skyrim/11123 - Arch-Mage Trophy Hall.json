  "descriptionHtml": "I adore the Winterhold tower-theme, but the Arch-Mage\\'s Quarter didn\\'t really feel like a home. This mod adds a second floor (the Trophy Hall), as well as a small cooking area to the original Arch-Mage\\'s Quarter.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n[b]Features:[/b]\r\n- 6 Mannequins\r\n- 6 Dagger Racks\r\n- 6 Shield Racks\r\n- 6 Weapon Plaques\r\n- 5 Weapon Display Cases\r\n- 15 Weapon Racks\r\n- 12 Bookshelves (For a total of 528 books)\r\n- Dragon Priest Mask Busts\r\n- Blacksmith area with a Forge, Smelter, Grindstone, Tanning Rack, Workbench and Enchanting Table\r\n- 4 containers\r\n- Soul Gem Reactor (details below)\r\n- Working NavMesh, so your followers can come with you (except to the smithing area)\r\n- A Dremora Guard to watch over your items when you\\'re gone.\r\n- 1 Sweetroll (in case someone stole yours)\r\n- Entering the Trophy Hall places you directly in the hallway. You still have to run up/down the stairs to leave the area.\r\n\r\nChanges made to the Arch-Mages Quarter:\r\n- Cooking area added.\r\n- Enchanted Chest from Oblivion added.\r\n- Some furniture rearangment and deletion. No container has been deleted.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\nAccessing the Smithing area:\r\nActivating the glowing orb in the Statue\\'s left hand will teleport you to a small crafting area. You leave the area the same way. Any follower you have should wait in the main hall untill you return.\r\n\r\nThe Dremora Guard:\r\nMostly added to bring some life to the area (trust me, it made a huge difference). If you attack him he will permanently be hostile towards you and you need to kill him before the area is safe. He doesn\\'t respawn.\r\n\r\n[b]The Soul Gem Reactor:[/b]\r\nThe Soul Gem Reactors main function is to merge existing soulgems into one-tier higher soul gems. In addition, it can create Black Soul Gems, Supreme Grand Soulgems and Supreme Black Soul Gems.\r\n\r\nMerging: Place your soulgems in the soul gem casket and activate. The reactor will first empty all filled gems then merge three gems of the same tier to create a gem one tier higher (3 petty = 1 lesser). Adding Azuras Star or the Black Star allows you to merge filled gems (3 filled common = 1 filled greater).\r\n\r\n- To create a Black Soul Gem, place one empty Grand Soul Gem and a Daedra Heart in the Soul Gem Casket.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Soul Gems are unbreakable gems. To create them, you need to place either Azura\\'s Star or The Black Star in the Casket. The Star will not be destroyed.\r\n- To create a Supreme Grand Soul Gem, place 8 Filled Grand Soul Gems, 8 Moonstone Ingots, 1 Daedra Heart and the Star in the Casket. Placing Azura\\'s Star will generate an additional Supreme Gem.\r\n- To create a Supreme Black Soul Gem, place 8 Filled Black Soul Gems, 8 Ebony Ingots, 4 Daedra Hearts and the Star in the Casket. Placing The Black Star will generate an additional Supreme Gem.\r\n\r\n[b]The Enchanted Chest:[/b]\r\nAdds a slightly modified version of the alchemy chest from Oblivion. It dublicates ingredients placed within.\r\n- Place an ingredient to the Enchanted Chest\r\n- Cast Hands of Alchemy on the chest (spell tome found in the chest). This is a power and can only be used once a day.\r\n- Placed ingredient is now duplicated\r\n- Does not duplicate food. Note that Salt Piles are classified as an Ingredient.\r\n\r\nThe amount of copies varies:\r\n- Ingredients marked as common, including Glowing Mushrooms, are duplicated 10-15 times.\r\n- Ingredients marked as uncommon are duplicated 8-12 times\r\n- Ingredients marked as rare (exception are Daedra Hearts) are duplicated 6-9 times.\r\n- Human hearts, Human Flesh and Daedra Hearts are duplicated 1-3 times.\r\nRead [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ingredients]this article[/url] for the rarity of the items.\r\n\r\n====================\r\n\r\n[b]Installation:[/b]\r\nUpgrading to 1.3?
