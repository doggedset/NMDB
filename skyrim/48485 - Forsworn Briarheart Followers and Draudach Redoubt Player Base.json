  "modName": "Forsworn Briarheart Followers and Draudach Redoubt Player Base",
  "summary": "Adds in two Briarheart Followers (a mane and a melee) to fight for you, as well as transforming Druadach Redoubt into a player base for Forsworn supporters.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a rerelease of my previous mod featuring the Briarhearts and I must say, it has been improved greatly. There aren&#39;t many Forsworn followers on the Nexus and the only Briarheart one wasn&#39;t very lore-friendly. I also wanted to have a Forsworn base for my Bosmer. So, mostly for personal use, that I thought it was fair to share it on the Nexus&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=red][b][u]Briarheart Follower and Druadach Redoubt Player Base[/u][/b][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />The mod has the following features:\r<br />\r<br />* Multiple storage facilities\r<br />* All crafting stations - Forge, smelter, grindstone, tanning rack, alchemy, enhanting and cooking\r<br />* Skeleton &#39;pet&#39;\r<br />* New clutter and decorations\r<br />* Shrine to the Old Gods and Dibella\r<br />* Two Briarheart followers - A mage and melee fighter\r<br />* Unique dagger rack\r<br />\r<br />If you wants more storage or weapons holders, let me know&#33; I&#39;ll be more then happy to do another version, I just left this one alone because I felt like one was enough for a simple base, but I&#39;m happy to change that for anyone.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Whose Here?[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Alix and Peyrn were twins born to a simple Breton family. However, their mother was a skooma addict and abandoned the twins with their father, a Forsworn agent. Though he raised them well, he was eventually sentenced to death for his involvement in aiding the Reachmen during the Siege of Markarth. He left them in the are of Madanch, but they were tossed in jail with him, for the Silver-Bloods intended to use them as slave labor. Madanach managed to smuggle them out and they were taken in by more Forsworn and were raised as such. They were both transformed into Briarhearts at sixteen, the youngest to do so.\r<br />\r<br />Alix is the melee fighter of the duo and a bit more kind-hearted then his brother. He secretly wishes for a peaceful end to the war of the Reach, but knows it&#39;ll never be that way. He worships Dibella and can be very vain of his appearance. He&#39;s very cautious and prefers to use careful planning the accomplish his goals, rather then just running in. He .can be found near the forge or cooking pot\r<br />\r<br />Peyrn, on the other hand, is very violent and hot-tempered. He is an accomplished mage and will not hesitate to lob fireballs at anyone in his way. He has a permanent skeleton thrall named Creaky, who often wanders the cave, and is said to be the only one who Peyrn doesn&#39;t growl at. He is known to worship Methrunes Dagon and sees chaotic slaughtering of the Nords in battle as the only way of winning. He can be found near the enchanting table or farm.\r<br />\r<br />Despite their solid differences, the brothers love each other and are formidable in combat and work together as one, often causing heavy damage for the opposing side.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]===[b]Installation:[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Just drop the file into your data folder. Or use the NMM. \r<br />To uninstall, just remove the file. \r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Permissions and Credits[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod is not to be uploaded anywhere but the Skyrim Nexus. Please report to me if you see this anywhere else.\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating a great game and letting us fiddle with it. \r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Thanks for reading and check my page for more mods&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7065334/?tb=mods&pUp=1 ] [IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/2dryws3.png[/IMG][/url]",
