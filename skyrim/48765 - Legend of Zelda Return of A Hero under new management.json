  "descriptionHtml": "I have taken over this mod now, along with PayneXIII  (and be sure to check out the beta of his own Zelda mod here http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42624/? I highly recommend it). Without a bigger team though, it could die. I don&#39;t want that to happen, and I&#39;m sure many of you would like to see this completed, so please, if you can contribute, no matter how small, it would mean a ton. For the Master Sword and Hylian Shield in the screenshots, go to my other mod here (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49511/) Be sure to download both files in the downloads section, and remember to report any bugs in the comment section, or you can PM me as well. \r<br />Make sure you make a copy of &#39;&#34;The Zelda Projekt.bsa&#34; and rename it to &#34;Hylian.bsa&#34; DO NOT RENAME ORIGINAL .BSA MAKE SURE YOU RENAME THE COPY. I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s like that, if someone knows how to fix this please let me know I can do so. That&#39;s all I have to say, below is the original description.\r<br />\r<br />This mod aims to rebuild the World from The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
