  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes the following:\n<br />\n<br />1. Thalmor vs Player (Three Thalmor  with an [url=http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Justiciar_Execution_Order]execution order[/url] hunt you down and attempt to kill you.) \n<br />-&gt; Changed condition from \"Player level 8\" to \"having completed Diplomatic Immunity\". \n<br />This is done for Thalmor/non-Dragonborn playthroughs.\n<br />v1.1 -&gt; added new condition: having completed \"Missing in Action\".\n<br />\n<br />2. Farmer refugees after Dragon attack (A farmer and his wife either walking along the road, or resting in an inn, after their farm was destroyed by a dragon) \n<br />-&gt; Changed condition from \"Player level 4\" to \"having completed Dragon Rising\". \n<br />This is done for non-Dragonborn playthroughs.\n<br />\n<br />3. Thief lock picking (A thief attempting to pick a locked door is discovered by guards. The guards will attack him and try to kill him. Sometimes he may escape into a house/shop.)\n<br />-&gt; Removed condition \"having completed a Chance Arrangement\".\n<br />This is done to see thieves even without doing the Thieves' Guild quests.\n<br />\n<br />4. Skooma dealer (A skooma dealer (named for their race) attempts to sell you skooma)\n<br />-&gt; Give him/her a chance to spawn with 1 or 2 shivs.\n<br />This is done to make it a bit more challenging.\n<br />\n<br />5. (v1.1) Dark Brotherhood Assassin Sent to Kill the Player\n<br />-&gt; Raised minimum required player level from 5 to 25. Gave it 50% less chance of happening.\n<br />\n<br />For a list of all random encounters, see [url=http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Random_Encounters]here[/url].",
