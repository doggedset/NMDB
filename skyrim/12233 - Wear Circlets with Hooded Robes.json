  "descriptionHtml": "(This is my first Mod)\r\n\r\nThis is just a simple mod that allows you to wear circlets (also dragon priest masks) with robes that have a built in hood. It does NOT allow you to wear them with the separate hoods/hats.\r\n\r\nFor a mod that allows circlets with anything hooded, please visit my other page: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12235\r\n\r\nThe changes apply to:\r\n\r\nClothes (Green clothes with built-in hood) - 00017695\r\nHooded Black Mage Robes - 0010710C\r\nHooded Black Robes - 00107108\r\nHooded Brown Robes - 0010CFE4\r\nHooded Green Robes - 0010CFEC\r\nHooded Grey Robes - 0010CFEA\r\nHooded Mage Robes - 0010710B\r\nHooded Mage Robes - 00107109\r\nHooded Monk Robes - 00107106\r\nHooded Necromancer Robes - 0010710D\r\nHooded Red Robes - 0010CFEB\r\nHooded Thalmor Robes - 0010C698\r\n\r\nNote: The hooded Archmage Robes already has this ability, so there was no need to add it. If, for some reason, Beth changes that, let me know and I will add it to this list.\r\nAlso, you can wear Dragon-priest masks with these robes since they are considered circlets.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you find that I missed any, and I will update it ASAP.\r\n\r\nMy file on Steam:\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=10217",
