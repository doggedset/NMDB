  "summary": "Simple esp patch to bring weapon damage in line with vanilla damage ranges.",
  "descriptionHtml": "JRC's weapon pack is wonderful, but the damage assigned to the weapons is extremely high on 1H and sometimes lower on 2H.  This is a patch to bring weapon damage in line with vanilla values for swords and great swords, ranging from steel to dragon, following the damage progression from the original mod.  I made this for myself, but I felt it may be useful to share for others to use.\n<br />\n<br />Tempering has also been added for weapons that did not have it before.\n<br />\n<br />Requires the original mod:  https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71912\n<br />\n<br />Place directly after original mod in load order.",
