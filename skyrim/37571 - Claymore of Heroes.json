  "descriptionHtml": "Claymore of Heroes\r\n===================\r\n\r\nBy: TheNerevar\r\n++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nI enjoy the criticism, and I just attempted to fix a bad example of my knowledge while keeping much of the original design. I hope you like it.\r\n\r\nWell, my first Skyrim mod EVAR! YAY!\r\n\r\nJust extract the .esp into your data folder. the meshes and texture also need to go to the\r\nright meshes and texture folders.\r\n\r\nI\\\\\\'m sure most of you understand.\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis mod:\r\n\r\nEDIT: Re-tweeked enchantment. it now acts as a silver and causes bleeding.\r\n\r\nIt is a modified Iron Greatsword with a modified texture.\r\nIt has the stats of an elven greatsword, but it is only 12 pounds (or what ever the weight unit is for on Tamriel)\r\nAnd it swings nearly as fast as a sword. It shouldn\\'t be too powerful, but if it is, I made is a pain to forge. ;)\r\nRequires Advances Armors perk for smithing, or find it in the temporary location (may change in the future,if people provide ideas) \r\nTemper-able.\r\n======================\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\n\r\nShould be compatible with anything, tried it out on my heavily modded (mainly gameplay) Skyrim; no issues.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to use this in their mods, I believe a creditwould be appreciated, not required.\r\nI\\'ve went through much pain and struggling I\\'ve went through trying out nifskope for the first time!\r\n\r\nIf anyone has ideas on how to immersively put it into the game by quest item lists, secret treasure in a tomb, etc, fire away!\r\n\r\nIf you want to improve the textures, go ahead! Publish that mod! Show the original creator\\'s glory!\r\n\r\nUpload sceenshots if you wish!\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nTHANKS:\r\n\r\nI thanketh thee for all your support and awesomeness.\r\n\r\nI thanketh Bethesda, mostly for their Elderscrolls games! Epecially III.\r\n\r\nGod bless\r\n\r\nGo forth and be a hero!",
