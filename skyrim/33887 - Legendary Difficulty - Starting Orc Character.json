  "summary": "My final starting character, a level 49 Orc ready to level to 83. 100% Legit",
  "descriptionHtml": "Requires Skyrim version 1.9.32.0.8 or higher.\r\n\r\nNOT SUPPORTED ON OLDER VERSIONS!!!\r\n\r\nThis will be my final starting character. Since 1.9 beta and the legendary difficulty setting i was inspired to start an all new character. Since i prefer to level my character before beginning the game all i did was to make sure no DLC\\'s were used and no ESP\\'s were loaded, so this is a clean no mod loaded save game. As you can see it is a very small save game size only 4.28 MB\r\n\r\nThis is a template character intended to be a \\\"good\\\" character. All skills have been raised to 100 except Pickpocket which is 90. No items stolen, no items pickpocketed, no murders and no bounties.\r\n\r\nYou start right outside of Whiterun, i haven\\'t even entered the city.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve chosen skills to level 49 and have one Legendary Rank in One Handed Swords. You have 35 unused Skill points and will be able to choose from 49 to 83 what attributes you wish to increase, up to 49 only health was raised.\r\n\r\nTook about a full month to complete, but i did have a few days down time due to a crashed SSD.\r\n\r\nAnyways, the intention was to create clean start game on Legendary Difficulty setting with a character from the beginning ready to go explore the world. Enjoy!\r\n",
