  "summary": "A small player home in Rorikstead.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever since i walked into Rorikstead for the first time i wanted to know how i could buy a house there. Sadly, as i played more, i found out you couldn\\'t buy one... So i decided to build one myself.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve never been really happy with the houses you actually could buy in the vanilla game. Aside from Breezehome, none of them felt like one i\\'d actually want to live in, neither would my characters. Solitude is a nice town but a villa? Even Rosethorn Hall felt more cozy than most of the vanilla houses!\r\n\r\nAnother thing was the lack of bookshelves, though i kinda liked collecting books now that bookshelves were actually in the game. Slowly seeing them fill up is a joy to watch, just so sad that there were so few bookshelves in any of the homes aside from Solitude, where they were so far apart. That was another reason to make this house.\r\n\r\nThere\\'s nothing unbalancing in the house, aside from not having to buy it to get there. It\\'s small, has no loot (aside from minor clutter) and does not have any crafting stations (aside from a cooking pot).\r\n\r\nAt some point there will be a quest to obtain the house. It will be short and involve some dialogue and 3 npc\\'s (i already have the story worked out to a degree), you may have to fight someone depending on the outcome. I don\\'t know when this will happen, that will depend on my time and persistence to learn the rest of the CK :)\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know via feedback if there\\'s something i can add or fix! I\\'m not that good with interior design, i copied one table from another house in Rorikstead entirely ;p\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously, this mod isn\\'t compatible with other mods that change Rorikstead - At least, to my knowledge. I\\'m not going to fix any incompatabilities unless i use the incompatible mod myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n\r\n0.9.0: Original version.\r\n0.9.1: Added navmesh, fixed ownership.\r\n0.9.5: Added more shelves, added more clutter (looks more lived in), fixed light bug (shadowcaster causing massive fps drop).\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n\r\nSomehow books have a massive area around them to interact with, i can\\'t figure out how to make the shelf container better accessible without shoving it into the player\\'s face at the detriment of book access. Tips are welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\nI took the screenshots with a certain ENB mod and Imaginator, if anyone is wondering :)",
