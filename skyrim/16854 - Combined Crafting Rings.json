  "descriptionHtml": "Version History:\r\nv1.0 - Original file - see description\r\n\r\nv1.1 - It was brought up in the comments that the rings in v1.0 are being spawned in multiple chests that are similar to the chest I originally put them in, so I added a strong box and placed it on a shelf (see screenshot).  \r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nMy first Skyrim mod.\r\nI was tired of trying to find a lot of different Alchemy and Smithing gear in a chest full of  other gear and didn\\'t want to go through the Enchanting process get them.\r\nSo I created three rings with combined Alchemy and Smithing enchantments.\r\n\r\nThey are:\r\nRing of Journeyman Crafting - Fortify Smithing and Alchemy 50%\r\nRing of Expert Crafting - Fortify Smithing and Alchemy 75%\r\nRing of Master Crafting - Fortify Smithing and Alchemy 100%\r\n\r\nThey are located in a chest in Dragonsreach in front of Farengar Secret-Fire\\'s desk (see screenshot).\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n-The rings are marked as stolen in the chest but not in your inventory and you can take them without anyone caring.\r\n\r\n-If you are using the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6703]Skyrim Unlimited Rings And Amulets[/url] mod by glock9mm you can only equip one of the rings but any other rings you\\'re wearing will not be unequipped.\r\n\r\nInstall/Uninstall:\r\nDownload using the Download with Manager button and activate it in the NMM \r\nor\r\nManually download the .esp file, place it in the ...\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data directory and activate the mod in the Skyrim launcher.\r\nUninstall - delete the .esp from the Data directory.",
