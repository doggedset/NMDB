  "modName": "Ilatria - Nord Female Standalone Follower",
  "summary": "Ilatria is a marriable Nord female rogue standalone follower, which means that she&#39;ll look just like in the screenshots, no matter what mods you have installed or even if you don&#39;t have any. She&#39;s based on my current player character and has some tricks up her sleeves that you don&#39;t always see on normal followers.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/FZ4eDCb.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]--- The House & Dungeon mod ---[/color][/heading]\r<br />The mod is finished as far as I&#39;m concerned but do let me know if you run into any problems. I&#39;ve also got a house / dungeon mod&#33; Go check it out by clicking [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31124/]here&#33;[/url]\r<br />Includes a dungeon that you need to complete in order to gain access to Ilatrias (and your) new home (more info below)&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]--- Updates&#33; ---[/color][/heading]\r<br />-- Warpaint free version of Ilatria available in the files section&#33; --\r<br />\r<br />Added a patch version for those who also have my &#34;Ilatria and the Tomb of the Old&#34; mod.\r<br />This patch moves Ilatria to her home in the Groizen&#39;Zor palace and gives her something to wear by default.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.5 is out. Ilatria should now be fully Standalone, thanks to my IRL friend who I used as a guinea pig to test the mod out without having any other texture changing mods installed.\r<br />In addition, the mod is now loose file free. All the resources are now packed conveniently in one .bsa file&#33;\r<br />\r<br />She&#39;s a little more powerful (a bit more health, magica and stamina, but not too much).\r<br />Did fixes to health, stamina and magica weights (she will choose to increase her stats a bit more logically on level up)\r<br />She will level with you to the maximum player character level of 81 (Still has the min. level of 10).\r<br />Added more perks that will benefit her style of combat.\r<br />\r<br />To update Ilatria&#39;s stats, do the following:\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*]Go in game, take out all items from Ilatria that you wish to keep.\r<br />[*]Send her back home (Dismiss).\r<br />[*]Save your game.\r<br />[*]Close the game and boot back up again with ilatria.esp [b][u]deactivated[/u][/b].\r<br />[*]Load the last save and save in a new slot.\r<br />[*]Close the game.\r<br />[*]Activate Ilatria.esp, go to Whiterun and take your &#34;upgraded&#34; Ilatria with you&#33; :)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]Introducing: Ilatria[/heading][/color]\r<br />\r<br />She&#39;s a young Nord girl looking for adventure at the Whiterun Temple of Kynareth&#33; And if you choose to take her with you, you&#39;ll notice that \r<br />she&#39;s more than capable of taking care of herself.\r<br />For maximum efficiency, give her a pair of good daggers, some sweet armor and she&#39;ll surely take care of \r<br />those bad guys for you, because Ilatria is well trained in the arts of assassination and subtlety.\r<br />And if you happen to talk to her with an Amulet of Mara equipped, she&#39;ll consider giving her hand in marriage ;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />She&#39;s well trained&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Ilatria has the skills to walk on traps without activating them. \r<br />[*]She&#39;s well equipped for stealth missions (3/5 sneak perks and silent footsteps)\r<br />[*]Can heal herself (increased magica regeneration, novice and apprentice restoration perks) \r<br />[*]Quiet casting \r<br />[*]Extra pockets to carry your burdens&#33;\r<br />[*]And much more&#33;\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]Background of the mod:[/heading][/color]\r<br />\r<br />She was originally designed to be the exact copy of my current player character so that I could take my \r<br />sweet Ilatria with me on my journeys on my other characters as well, but after receiving positive feedback \r<br />from my friends, I decided to go the extra mile and make her into a standalone format and ask for the \r<br />permissions from the original creators of all the resources that I used to create her so that anyone \r<br />could enjoy the company of Ilatria without having to worry about which mods to install to make her look \r<br />the way she should.\r<br />\r<br />Keep in mind that I had absolutely zero experience on Skyrim modding before this mod, so if you find \r<br />anything wrong, let me know and I&#39;ll see if I can fix it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]Installing:[/heading][/color]\r<br />Download the .rar file. Unpack the contents (Two folders, named Meshes and Textures and Ilatria.esp) and \r<br />place them in your Skyrim&#39;s Data folder (commonly located in Program FilesSteamSteamAppscommonskyrim)\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]Uninstalling:[/heading][/color]\r<br />Remove all items that you&#39;d wish to keep from Ilatria&#39;s inventory, give her a hug for goodbye and delete the files that you installed:\r<br />Open up SkyrimData folder, use windows explorer to search for &#34;Ilatria&#34;.\r<br />Remove all folders and files that contain the word &#34;Ilatria&#34; (there shouldn&#39;t be that many)\r<br />Done&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]FAQ:[/heading][/color]\r<br />Q: Why is she naked when I met her the first time?\r<br />A: When creating the follower, I could choose to equip her with a standard set of items in the same fashion as the normal\r<br />followers, like housecarls. There&#39;s one problem with that though. The equipment set is not shown in the followers\r<br />inventory and in addition, equipping your own armor or clothes on her is annoying, so I decided to just add the monk robes\r<br />and pair of boots in her inventory as normal items. She should equip them once you ask her to follow you and exit the Temple,\r<br />but I&#39;d recommend giving her some better items if you&#39;re planning on using her in demanding missions.\r<br />\r<br />Q: What class is she?\r<br />A: She&#39;s Combat Assassin by definition. If you want to get the best of her, give her two good daggers and she&#39;ll put them\r<br />to good use.\r<br />\r<br />Q: What level is she?\r<br />A: I&#39;ve set Ilatria to scale with your level. Her minimum level is 10 and her maximum level is 81. In Skyrim, the time you enter \r<br />the same area as the follower the first time defines the level of that follower, though the level and skill levels can be refreshed\r<br />to reflect your current ones using some mods (UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul for example).\r<br />\r<br />Q: Where can I find her once I&#39;ve installed me mod?\r<br />A: At the Temple of Kynareth, Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]-------- Credits & Thanks--------[/heading][/color]\r<br />Psychos1s - for his awesome work on the Temptress Race and the source of most of Ilatria&#39;s face textures.\r<br />Click the image below to visit the mod page of the Temptress Race:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18717][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8434/7722550578_0ed2414e53.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />apachii - for the best Skyrim Haircuts and the source of Ilatria&#39;s hair as well:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/]Link to ApachiiSkyHair[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />dimon99 - for the best looking female body seen in gaming and the source of Ilatria&#39;s body meshes and textures:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709/]Link to DIMONIZED UNP female body[/url]\r<br />\r<br />nevenbridge81 - for all of those pretty eyes and Ilatria&#39;s too:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589/]Natural Eyes[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda - for creating such an epic gaming experience and for all the rest of the body pieces that I&#39;ve used.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4825044/?]mysticentity[/url] and The Creation Kids for the beautiful &#39;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?]Forever Free[/url]&#39; logo",
