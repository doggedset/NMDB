  "descriptionHtml": "DISCLAIMER: I did get permission to upload this mod from Trainwiz himself because we&#39;re butt buddies. And now it seems i&#39;m his new errand boy.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]Uy3-hN3Bd50[/youtube]    \r<br />\r<br />People have often asked me &#34;Trainwiz, if you are a wizard, and a train wizard, what train spells do you know?&#34; \r<br />So, to show those people, I created this mod. It adds a shout that, when used, will create an effect similar to Alduin&#39;s meteor shower spell. Except instead of meteors, they&#39;re trains. \r<br />It will rain trains. You have read this correctly, and you have been warned. I take no responsibility for any damages sustained while it&#39;s raining [censored] trains. \r<br />The shout is not included anywhere. To unlock it, enter the console commands \r<br />&#39;player.teachword xx001d8e&#39; \r<br />&#39;player.teachword xx001d8f&#39; \r<br />&#39;player.teachword xx001d90&#39; \r<br />Where xx is the number of this mod in your load order. Alternative, enter the console comand &#39;help choo&#39; and find that ID. \r<br />And use the console or some of your own dragon shouts to unlock the spell. ",
