  "descriptionHtml": "Name: NPCOverhaul\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nDate: 11/8/2013\r\nCategory: NPCs\r\nRequirements: Player-Created MOD(s): Falskaar, Official Bethesda MOD(s): Dawnguard DLC, \r\nHearthFires DLC, Dragonborn DLC\r\n\r\nAuthor(s): Drax8\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nChanges the appearance of many NPC's in Skyrim, mostly female and a few select male. *Note* No \r\nOrcs, Argonians, or Khajit were harmed in the making of this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nI originally made this mod for myself, and decided to upload it for anyone who may want to use \r\nit. I know it isn't for everyone, but if you like it, feel free to use it. I know there are \r\nother mods like this, this is just my own personal version. I hope you like it!\r\n\r\nI changed all female named NPC's and a few select male NPC's giving them new hair, and in some \r\ncases, changing facial features. All of the females were given ApachiiSkyHair, as were some of \r\nthe males, however some males just have a different vanilla hair style.\r\n\r\nThis mod includes all generated facegen data for the changed NPC's, so they will not have \r\nmismatched heads/bodies. Please let me know if there are any issues with this.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I changed all Dunmer to have either white or black hair. Just my personal \r\npreference.\r\n\r\n*Please Note* No Orcs, Argonians, or Khajit were harmed in the making of this mod!\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nDawnguard\r\nHearthFires\r\nDragonborn\r\nFalskaar\r\nApachiiSkyHair_v_1_5_Full\r\nApachiiSkyHairFemale_v_1_3\r\nApachiiSkyHairMale_v_1_1\r\n**While not required, I highly recommend ApachiiSkyHair Natural Retexture by Aron - \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35092/? **\r\n\r\nIf there is any interest, I will upload version that don't require Falskaar, etc. I use it and \r\nall DLC's, which is why this mod requires them.\r\n\r\nAppearance mods used in screenshots:\r\nFEMALE-CBBE v3.2.3 Curvy, body and face textures by Caliente\r\nSporty Sexy Map - Athletic Muscle mod by Xs2reality\r\nXCE - warpaint and dirt by Xenius\r\nMALE-Better Males-Faces - YoungerFacesMergedWithMenByGeonox by Chris57\r\nBetter Males-Underwear - Default by Chris57\r\nXCE - warpaint and dirt by Xenius\r\n\r\nENB - Sharpshooters Original Extreme Graphics, patched for ENBoost, with DOF from RealVision ENB \r\nand Extensive Shaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n1. Download with NMM and activate, enjoy!\r\n\r\n-OR-\r\n\r\n2. Manually download and drop contents into your Skyrim/Data folder. Be sure to activate the \r\n.esp.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n1. Uninstall with NMM.\r\n\r\n-OR-\r\n\r\n2. Delete the NPCOverhaul.esp from your Data folder.

The very bottom of my load order for example:\r\n\r\nNPCOverhaul.esp\r\nBashedPatch, 0.esp\r\nAutomatic Variants.esp\r\nDual Sheath Redux Patch.esp\r\nReProccer.esp\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nIncompatible with mods that alter any of the same NPC's. However can be used with such mods. For \r\nexample, if you use a mod that alters Aela and want to use that, just make sure it loads after \r\nthis mod, and it will still work.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nNo known issues or bugs.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0, 11/8/2013 Initial Release\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\nThanks to TESNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\nThanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\r\nThanks to apachii for the amazing ApachiiSkyHair mod.\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nReadme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nYou can do whatever you want with this mod but don't complain to me if it \r\ndoesn't work or your PC blows up.\r\n ",
