  "descriptionHtml": "Hellow people here is my More Realistic Lighting Config, please give it a try as you may really like the results.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the pictures below to see what this lighting config is about.\r\n\r\nThe original mod can be found here [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7654]Realistic Lighting[/url]\r\n\r\nFeel free to comment and don\\'t forget to [color=ff7400][u]ENDORSE[/u][/color] if you like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=7373d9][size=20]VERSION 1.8[/size][/color]\r\n1.8) Updated 7/20/2012 with Realistic Lighting With Customization 3.4a\r\n1.7) Made the interiors brighter.\r\n1.6) Updated 3/30/12  with Realistic Lighting With Customization 3.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea was to try and get the lighting how it would be in real life, it may not be perfect but I honestly think it\\'s pretty close.\r\n\r\n[color=grey][size=20]Dungeons [/size][/color] They are very dark as it would be in real life, if you have ever been in a cave you know what I mean. It\\'s not pitch black but it\\'s pretty dark, it would be hard to go without a torch but it is possible.\r\n[img]http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg14/scaled.php?server=14&filename=rszrsztesv2012031604564.png&res=medium[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=ff7400][size=20]Inside [/size][/color] I made it just a bit darker and that is pretty much it for indoors.\r\n[img]http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg822/scaled.php?server=822&filename=rsz1rsztesv201203160501.png&res=medium[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][size=20]Day [/size][/color] The snow will be fairly bright like it would i real life but not to much, I have the re textured snow from Skyrim HD and this will make it correct not so bright that it has no texture. The water should also be better if you have realistic water mod.\r\n[img]http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg804/scaled.php?server=804&filename=rsztesv2012031604483308.png&res=medium[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=black][size=20]Night [/size][/color] It will be dark at night to especially when it is cloudy out so a torch may be necessary. It looks really dark in the pic because of where I was looking, it\\'s not as dark when looking closer to the ground.\r\n[img]http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg826/scaled.php?server=826&filename=rsz11rsztesv20120316052.png&res=medium[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=87c1ce][size=20]Dawn [/size][/color] The sunrise is a bit darker than normal and so is the sky but just slightly.\r\n[img]http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg208/scaled.php?server=208&filename=rsz1rsztesv201203160523.png&res=medium[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=8e41d5][size=20]Dusk [/size][/color] Not much change here, just slightly darker just like dawn.\r\n[img]http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg849/scaled.php?server=849&filename=rsz1tesv201203160534228.png&res=medium[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=green][size=20]Overall [/size][/color] I have made the colors pop out a bit more and increased the contrast slightly. I have tried to eliminate the eye adaption as much as possible, like when you look at something bright and look away it gets darker for a second. The transition from night to dawn and from day to dusk will seem slightly longer to. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=7373d9][size=20]INSTALL[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nExtract and put all 4 files in your Skyrim/Data and make sure the patcher esp is loaded after the realistic lighting esp or it will not work.\r\n\r\n[color=7373d9][size=20]UNINSTALL[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nJust delete those 4 files in Skyrim/Data it\\'s that easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=7373d9][size=20]INSTRUCTIONS[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nMake sure all 4 files the .ini the two esp\\'s and the java patcher are in your Skyrim/Data. Change the numbers in the .ini file that\\'s in the download, here is a link to the guide on what they do, [url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/56852942/Realistic%20Lighting%20Editing%20Guide.html]Instructions[/url]. Save the .ini file. Run the java patcher after you are done making changes.  The patcher will make a new patcher .esp file that will replace the old one. Play the game. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is something you want changed and don\\'t know how to change it using the .ini file let me know in the comments and I will do it for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=ff7400][size=20]Enjoy[/size][/color]",
