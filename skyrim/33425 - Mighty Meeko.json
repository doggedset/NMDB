Ready for use.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.image-share.com/upload/2211/280.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nMeeko\\'s found south of Solitude, just go to the little mill down the hill, cross the lake down south and his shack (Litteraly \\\"Meeko\\'s Shack\\\") is found near a keep with some mages and skeletons. If you find the shack before seeing the dog, he\\'s waiting for someone to come by on the main road that would lead to the house, and then starts walking towards his shack.
