  "descriptionHtml": "[color=yellow][b]Description:[/b][/color]\r<br />If you don&#39;t like mods that drastically change vanilla, but also think that vanilla speech tree is useless and unattractive then this mod it&#39;s definitely for you.\r<br />I have just invert some perk orders, slighty buffed haggling and allure, and added 1 perk that reduce shouts cooldown.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Reasons to install this mod:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />-Speech levelling a bit faster then vanilla.\r<br />-No reason to install a mod that enrich vendors. Now Master trader and investor are way more accessible to player with low speech level. \r<br />-Allure is now a little more effective, also haggling is. \r<br />-The new perk &#34;Way of the voice&#34; offer both a fair and attractive reason to invest in speech.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Major changes:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />-Haggling:\r<br />   -Level 1 – This perk has no prerequisites and makes buying and selling prices 10% better.\r<br />   -Level 2 – This perk requires that you have at least 40 in the Speech skilltree and makes buying and selling prices 20% better.\r<br />   -Level 3 – This perk requires that you have at least 80 in the Speech skilltree and makes buying and selling prices 40% better.\r<br />   -Level 4 and Level 5: removed. \r<br />\r<br />-Allure:\r<br />   -20% (up from 10%) better prices with the opposite sex.\r<br />\r<br />-Way of the voice (NEW&#33;):\r<br />   -Time between shouts is reduced by 10%.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Minor changes:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />-fbarter max value is increased from 3.3 to 4.5. This means that buy and sell cost are increased and decreased respectively at low speech levels. \r<br />-Speech skill now gains more faster then before (Skill Use Mult 0.36 up from 0.72).\r<br />-All moved perks have their require skill points adjusted to match the new perk position. \r<br />-Allure in now in old Fence position.\r<br />-Fence is now in old Master trader position.\r<br />-Master trader is now in old Allure position.\r<br />-Investor is now in old Merchant position.\r<br />-Merchant is now in old Investor position.\r<br />-Persiasion and intimidation now requires only 50 in speech and they are both prerequisites for Way of the voice new perk.\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]My other mods:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3271584/?tb=mods&pUp=1]Check all of them here[/url]",
