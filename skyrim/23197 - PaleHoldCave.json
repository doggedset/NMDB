  "descriptionHtml": "Updates: \r\n9/17/2012\r\nV1.3\r\n-Really Fixed the lighting this time.\r\n-Navmeshed, followers can now enter.\r\n-Added a forge room, including a smelter, grinder, armor table, and forge.\r\n-Added some more flora and random clutter.\r\n-Added a shrine of talos to his statue.\r\n-Fixed some spots in the floor were you could see through to the void.\r\n[url=http://s157.photobucket.com/albums/t58/Gotti__01/?action=viewÂ¤t=ScreenShot24.jpg]Preveiw Shot[/url]\r\n\r\nV1.1\r\n-Fixed lighting, excessive shadow lighting was causing the lights to fade in and out.\r\n-Fixed some clipping with rocks in the bedroom.\r\n-Repositioned some chest.\r\n-Added a mannequin in the bedroom area.\r\n-Added a tanning rack.\r\n-Added various clutter.\r\n\r\nAll updates are safe to install for players using a previous version, as they dont edit any containers.\r\n\r\nIn Progress:\r\n9/17/2012 5:26pm\r\nStill working on a companions quarters, but i wanted to release this before i start tearing apart the cave. Next update will include a armor rack in the cage room, companions quarters, and most likely touch up the forge area, it kinda removes from the coziness of the cave. Ill most likely take a short break before starting again, navmeshs kinda burnt me out on the creation kit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture plans:\r\n-Working on making the bookshelf working\r\n-A maid/butler of some sort\r\n-A quest to obtain the home\r\n\r\n\r\nPALEHOLD CAVE:\r\nA smallish two story cave home that i build for my character. located next to the hunters camp under the warrior,mage, and thief stones. Very floral and includes cooking, Alchemy stations, and as of 1.3 a forge, smelter, armor table, and grinder, added in a new addition. Its more tuned towards a hunter or ranger player. \r\n\r\nI Strongly recommend [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7654]Realistic Lighting With Customization[/url] with vanilla setting and darker dungeons, the other options seem to make the cave extremely bright. As the interior lighting was made and tested with these settings.\r\n\r\nStill need to get more screenshots, most came out alot darker than they looked in-game, and i had to re-size all the exterior shots since they were to big,  now they look like poo.",
