  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is incompatible with my \\'alchemy levels faster\\' mod. If you use both at once, load order will determine which is used. The other will do nothing.\r\n\r\nThis mod may make NPC training break for the affected skills. There is no known full fix, however, changing stone bonus to one unaffected by the mod should enable training (you can change back afterwards). The game is fundamentally broken in that training gives a set amount of xp, so increasing xp gain on skills will break training. There\\'s not a lot I can do about it.\r\n\r\nThis mod makes enchanting (and / or alchemy) level faster. It does so by modifying the mage, thief, warrior and lover stone bonuses. When you have one of these stones active, there is an additional bonus that increases how fast the specific skill or skills levels. There are a number of esms here with varying rates of increase. The \\'ench + alch\\' folder increases the rate of leveling of both skills equally to 1.5, 2, 3, or 4x. The \\'ench only\\' folder increases only enchanting. The \\'both at diff\\' folder contains a single esm that increases alchemy by 4x and enchanting by 2x. This is the default ESM contained in the data folder.\r\n\r\nDrop whichever esm you like the most into your /skyrim/data folder. \r\n\r\nCheck out my skyrimnexus profile for my other mods here:\r\nhttp://skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3056619\r\n",
