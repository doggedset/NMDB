  "summary": "There are spells to slow time and even stop it, but what about moving THROUGH it? This spell allows you to fast forward time by 2 hours in real time for total immersion.",
  "descriptionHtml": "-READ ME-\r\nDue to the scripting of actors (they have their own schedule and AI) I do not recommend using MTT in towns or cities due to some lag issues. The spell is more for areas less populated. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\r\n\r\n-DESCRIPTION-\r\nUPDATE: After a lengthy hiatus, I am back and hard at work on all of my mods. Updates will be coming shortly for all four of my releases. Thank you for your continued support and patience!\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of spells that allow you to control time and slow it down or even stop it, but I have not seen any to move through time. This mod does such a thing.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re like me and love immersion, then you might hate having to bring up a menu to fast forward through your days. It\\'s really immersion-breaking. This mod adds a spell to the Solitude docks (see screenshots) that allows you to fast forward through time by 2 hours in real time. You\\'ll see the skies change, water flow faster, all that good stuff without a menu to break your immersion. \r\n\r\nWhile this spell is especially geared toward mages, anyone can use it as it costs nothing to use or acquire. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy the mod don\\'t forget to endorse!\r\n\r\n-OTHER MODS-\r\n\r\nLeaps Of Skyrim\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32589\r\n\r\nThe Hole In The Wall- Thief Hideout\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31024\r\n\r\nThe Mage\\'s Gorge\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32897\r\n\r\nHunter\\'s Abode- The Lodge\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35030\r\n\r\nDragonborn Hall\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35306\r\n",
