  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=4]Your Market Awning: An Addon for Your Market Stall[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />I love wgstein&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35305/]&#34;Your Market Stall&#34;[/url] mod, but I&#39;ve often wanted a bit more shelter while I&#39;m tending my shop -- especially for playthroughs with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163/]Frostfall[/url] installed. This is my solution.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]What It Does:[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />The original mod uses commonchair01 as the base mesh for the market stall. My edit changes that reference to a custom mesh, combining the chair nif with a modified version of whmarketstall02, so that both you and your wares will be covered by an awning. I have also created a number of texture options for the canvas covering, including five basic tones and eighteen faction-inspired patterns (half solid, half striped). The texture can be chosen using the FOMOD installer with either NMM or MO.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve also included a custom inventory model for the market stall, because why not.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Installation:[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />First, install the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35305/]original mod[/url] if you haven&#39;t already. I shouldn&#39;t even need to say that. \r<br />Second, install my file using the mod manager of your choice. Choose the texture you want using the installer.\r<br />Allow my esp to overwrite the one from Your Market Stall&#33; (If you are using NMM I recommend making a backup of the original file first. If you are using MO, just set my mod lower in the left panel.)\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Uninstallation:[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />If you need to manually uninstall for some reason, delete meshes&#92;tpishek&#92; and textures&#92;tpishek&#92;, and restore the esp file from the original mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Known Issues:[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />The collision on the awning is a little wonky. This should not affect play, but may be a minor annoyance. In particular, NPCs will probably get stuck on your stall more often than before, subjecting you to a stream of &#34;Yes?&#34; &#34;Yes?&#34; &#34;What is it?&#34; before teleporting away.\r<br />If I can figure out ChunkMerge I might try to fix this, or if anyone else wants to try they are more than welcome. \r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Credits:[/size][size=2]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2761530]wgstein[/url] for Your M[/size]arket Stall\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/848320]XunAmarox[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/1316898]nyrb[/url] for their FOMOD tutorials\r<br />The creators of Nifskope and GIMP\r<br />\r<br />Please feel free to use/modify my assets for any other Skyrim mod, but do respect the permissions laid out by wgstein for the esp.",
