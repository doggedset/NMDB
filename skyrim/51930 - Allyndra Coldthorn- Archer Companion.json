  "descriptionHtml": "A wood elf companion with an icy disposition and a few magical tricks up her sleeve. \r<br />She&#39;s found in the Dawnstar Barracks, top floor. \r<br />\r<br />Admittedly, that first bit isn&#39;t true- yet. the closest I could get in vanilla was the condescending female voice, which honestly just made me want to kill her. So for now, she&#39;s just even-toned. If any girls feel like volunteering their vocal talents, send me a PM and I&#39;ll give you some lines to try out. \r<br />\r<br />Anyway, she&#39;s primarily an archer, with some Frost magic fallback. I&#39;d recommend her for warrior or spell-sword type PC&#39;s, anyone who likes to get up close. Again, she&#39;s going to hopefully have a quest behind her, but Tina Snowfall (Found here- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51786/?) is first on the list. \r<br />\r<br />As usual, please playtest vigorously, review, and endorse if you like her.",
