  "descriptionHtml": "This was actually the 1st mod I made for skyrim, but it\\'s the second one I\\'ve uploaded here.\r\nI made this because I never understood why \\\"Lesser Powers\\\" could be cast as much as wanted and \\\"Powers\\\" can only be cast once a day. With Powers like \\\"Nigtingale Strife\\\" you could totally miss your mark and be stuck without it for a whole day. To me that makes them pretty useless.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nSkyrim\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nUnrar and place the Better Nightingale Powers.esp file in your skyrim data folder. Place optional bat file, 1ALLNGPOWERS, into your skyrim.exe directory. The folder right before data.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nWhat this mod does is it tweaks each of the Nightingale Powers in the game to be more powerful and turns them to Lesser Powers, which can be cast as much as wanted.\r\n\r\nNightingale Strife = Amped up to take 250 pts of Health from the target. with just a short cool down of 1 or 2 sec, you can spam this all day long.\r\n\r\nNightingale Subterfuge = Much larger radius of effect with higher level NPC limit. Short cool down and spam away.\r\n\r\nShadowcloak of Nocturnal = I liked this one the best for my stealth char. I changed it to last for a whole day, afterwhich you must recast the lesser power. Still have to sneak undetected to go invisible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to have all three powers at once, open you console and type: bat 1allngpowers. This will add all three powers to you character.",
