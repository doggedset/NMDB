  "descriptionHtml": "Have Osama himself herding mammoths around Skyrim! -- a mod to replace the face of a giant with the face of Osama bin Laden.  \r\nThis is an entertaining and funny mod that pretty much does what it says on the tin...\r\n\r\nPlease download, endorse, comment and suggest improvements. This was my first texture changing mod I\\'ve uploaded so give it a try; I know it doesn\\'t really fit with the skyrim theme but i thought it might lighten up the game :)\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALL instructions:\r\n1. download .rar file \r\n2. unpack with 7zip/WinRar etc.. to your skyrim/data/textures/actors/giant folder\r\n3. play the game and enjoy :D  (to ensure mod installed correctly: save game, open console and type exactly as shown\r\nplayer.placeatme 000936D3\r\n\r\nHAPPY SKYRIMMING !!",
