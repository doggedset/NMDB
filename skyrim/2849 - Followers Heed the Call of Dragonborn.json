  "descriptionHtml": "Followers Heed the Call of Dragonborn version 1.2\r\n\r\nBy Acleacius\r\n\r\n\r\nTired of losing your Follower...waiting while they find you when you took a shortcut...don\\'t want to travel all the way back to your Follower\\'s home base to re-recruit them after they were forced out of group for a quest Follower? Just maybe this can help, at least until the CK is released or someone comes up with a better solution. If it helps, consider Endorsing.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned below I\\'m not experienced enough to make this into a Shout until the Creation Kit is released in January, so hopefully not long after release.\r\n\r\nV 1.2\r\nAdded Shadowmere and removed the Relationshiprank adjustment, which fixed a problem with Followers losing their ranking. It could cause a problem divorcing married couples to Allies, doh! I left the relationshipranking for Shadowmere, Frost, Meeko and Vigilance since you better not be marrying your damn animals!  \r\n\r\nStill no RefID for Stray Dog, yet.\r\n\r\nIf your Not married and do lose your ranking (i.e. you can\\'t rehire your follower in dialog) then open the console, click on the face (makes sure you get their RefID) then type\r\nsetrelationshiprank 3  <-- 3 sets them to Ally and 4 is married.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING, DO NOT TRY TO USE A FILE ON A FOLLOWER YOU DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALREADY, I COULD BREAK YOUR FUTURE QUEST!\r\n\r\n\r\nI a built a bat file for each possible Follower, which calls them to you. There are a few minor exceptions Stray Dog has no RefID afaik (also Dark Brotherhood Initiate). It also marks them as Ally, this is becasue there is a bug that seems to reset the Relationshiprank which can prevent them from offering you the dialog to, Join Group. \r\n\r\nInstructions: Pick your Follower\\'s file move it to your main install directory, most likely \\'The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\\' and where the TESV.exe is located. Once in game you can test it by opening the console, typing bat \\\"Follower Name\\\", without quotes and then Enter, i.e. bat Illia. \r\n\r\nYou will probably have to do it twice, at least first time. This is due to the Engine, not me or these bat files. Once you type the bat file for your follower, if they don\\'t show up then just hit the Up Arrow key while console is up and Enter. Afaik there isn\\'t an easier way, yet.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nPlease just use one at a time, don\\'t flood your Main directory with 40+ unused text files. ;)\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nIf you don\\'t like it or it blows up your computer? Once you repair the computer, remove the file.  :p\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture:Once the CK is out, if there is no better solution to the AI issues, I\\'ll make this into a Shout. Atm I\\'m leaning towards; Gron Ov Mir\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport & Bugs: None I know of but I didn\\'t try it on every potential Follower. Each file is just three command lines, name, rank and location. I could have gotten a Prid (name) wrong, don\\'t freak out. If you don\\'t want to wait for me to fix it, then google Skyrim (name of follower) and get their RefID number, yourself.  :)\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Permission needed, acknowledgement would be nice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Nexus for all the years of being here for us nerds!\r\nThanks to Bethesda for Skyrim!\r\nThanks to Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages\r\nThanks to Malukah for singing Dragonborn while I made this mod!",
