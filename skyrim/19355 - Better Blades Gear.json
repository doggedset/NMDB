  "summary": "Improves armour rating of the Blades armour set to be equivalent to Ebony armour. Improves damage of the Blades Sword and Dragonbane to be around that of Ebony Swords.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was surprised that nobody else had done a plugin to improve the protection of the Blades armour, after reaching the part of the game where you obtain it (didn\\'t want to spoil anything) and finding it to be not good for my level or able to be tempered. The swords gave me the same feeling, though could at least be tempered.\r\n\r\nThis plugin changes that, the Blades Armour now provides protection equal to Ebony armour, and can now be tempered with the Adv. Armours perk (it\\'s recognised as the same class as Steel Plate) and steel ingots. The Blades Swords now do more damage (about that of an Ebony Sword), and Dragonbane does +2 base damage on all versions of the sword.\r\n\r\nI also reccommend Shank\\'s [u]Blades Sword Sheath fix for NPCs[/u] mod, found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7600",
