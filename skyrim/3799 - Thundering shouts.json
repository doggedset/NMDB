  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ffaf37][size=4][u][b]9 Jan 2017 Update - SkyrimSE Version[/b][/u][/size][/color]\n<br />As I've stated in the comments section, I no longer play Skyrim and I have not purchased Skyrim Special Edition, having lost interest in anything related to Skyrim. If you're looking for a SE version of this mod, you can find it on Bethesda.net, thanks to user \"straykat\" who has uploaded both a [url=https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3416812]PC version[/url] and an [url=https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3416837]XB1 version[/url].\n<br />[line]\n<br />[color=#ffaf37][size=4][b][u]Description[/u][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This mod changes the shout audio (both male and female) in the following ways:\n<br />\n<br />[list][*]all shouts have the pitch lowered by 10%, with a few exceptions for orcs and female argonians\n<br />[*]level 2 and level 3 shouts have echo, and most of them have thunder in the background (somewhat like the draugr shouts)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />I tried to make the effect subtle enough that it's not obtrusive, but pronounced enough that it's noticeable. See the video below for an example.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][youtube]_Fkdb9DayrI[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[line]\n<br />[color=#ffaf37][size=4][b][u]Installation[/u][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />To install, copy the files \"Thundering Shouts.esp\" and \"Thundering Shouts.bsa\" to your data folder, and enable the .esp from the Skyrim Launcher.\n<br />[line][size=4]\n<br />[color=#ffaf37][b][u]Compatibility[/u][/b][/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />This mod replaces the audio data associated with all shouts, including those added by the Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLCs. It should not conflict with any other mods, unless they also replace the same audio. If you do have another mod that does that, then one of two things will happen when using both mods:\n<br />\n<br />[list][*]If the other mod consists of loose files (located in data&#92;sound&#92;voice&#92;...), then it will take precedence over Thundering Shouts. Both mods will work, but the game will only use the parts from Thundering Shouts that are not overridden by the other mod.\n<br />[*]If the other mod consists of an esp/bsa pair, then whichever mod comes after the other in the loading order, will override the other.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Also note that while this mod includes audio replacements for the shouts introduced by the Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLCs, you can still use it without the DLCs.\n<br />\n<br />[i][color=#ffff00][b]The mod works with Skyrim Special Edition, but only when using the loose files version[/b][/color], found in the \"optional files\" category of the files tab.[/i] Apparently, SkyrimSE can't read BSA archives, so neither of the main versions work with it.",
