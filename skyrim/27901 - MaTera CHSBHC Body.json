  "descriptionHtml": "The point of this mod is to use Cherryhotaling&#39;s  CHSBHC and combine it with Charismoon&#39;s MeTera custom race.\r<br />WARNING: In order for this you must Install Charismoon&#39;s mod first [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23170]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23170[/url]\r<br />I Suggest the NMM Easy Install.\r<br />\r<br />This Mod only works for one style of the MaTera race and if you would like to change to another style refer to Haker342&#39;s comment which is the 11th post in the comments section.\r<br />\r<br />Haker342 - &#34;This is a guide for people that want to use the other styles of Ma Tera. \r<br />Basically just go into your data folder and copy the body files from your meshes and textures, and put them into the corresponding Ma Tera folders. \r<br />For the meshes go to Data/Meshes/actor/characters/character assets\r<br />for the textures go to Data/texture/actor/character/female\r<br />Then copy paste the corresponding files into the Ma Tera folder. Move the files out of the Ma Tera folder if you&#39;re worried and want a back up. \r<br />There is an issue if you used the furred hands that the line where they go from fur to skin is very sharp, I havent use anything but this for awhile so I cant remember if the actual race does this. \r<br />This is just a harder way of doing what this mod does for some extra compatibility. If you like this race, this mod, or this guide give endorsements to mrknight and the original mod. They worked hard on these and deserve the credit. A great mod for a great race. Thanks.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Just install the Meshes and Textures in your Skyrim Data Directory and it should work out fine.\r<br />YOU MUST HAVE CHARISMOON&#39;S MaTera MOD BEFORE INSTALLING THIS OTHERWISE THE FILES WILL NOT BE THERE.\r<br />MaTera Location\r<br />Meshes: &#34;C:&#92;(Where ever your Skyrim is installed at)&#92;The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Meshes&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;MaTera&#92;female&#34;\r<br />Without the quotes\r<br />Textures: &#34;C:&#92;(Where ever your Skyrim is installed at)&#92;The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;MaTera&#92;female&#34;\r<br />\r<br />IF ANYONE CAN HELP WITH THE NECK SEAMS PLEASE DO. Just make sure to credit the proper mod Owners and ask for their approval\r<br />\r<br />Sorry about the random crow, it is just in the screenshots so don&#39;t worry it won&#39;t show up on your character. I got a modded spell that put him there and he is still there even after I uninstalled the mod, it&#39;s really starting to piss me off.... -_-\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />I would like to thank \r<br />- Bethesda - For a Wonderful game known as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\r<br />Charismoon for the wonderful MeTera Custom Race Mod.\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23170]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23170[/url]\r<br />Cherryhotaling For a Stunning CHSBHC Body Mod.\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4888]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4888[/url]\r<br />Added this file later so now I will thank Nalimxxx For creating a magnificent Body mod.\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5661]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5661[/url]",
