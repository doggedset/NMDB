  "summary": "A small underground storage.",
  "descriptionHtml": "An underground storage space aimed to have enough room to store almost all armors visually.\r<br />\r<br />It contains 46 mannequins and weapon racks to go with them. Also includes all Skyrim crafting tables, mask busts, and all blessing statues.\r<br />\r<br />All rooms are fully done with NavMesh and should allow followers in.\r<br />\r<br />The travel room is connected to all original Skyrim homes.\r<br />The main door is a well, located on the right outside of Breezehome.\r<br />The door to the travel room inside of the house is on the table by the main entry door. It looks like the Night Mother&#39;s coffin.\r<br />There are trap doors in every player house that lead to the travel room, they are on the bottom floor of each house. Each house key is needed to unlock its corresponding door.\r<br />\r<br />The key for the Dawnstar Sanctuary door is located within the Dawnstar Sanctuary on a table next to the trap door that leads to the travel room.\r<br />The keys for the Hearthfire version, are in each Hearthfire house right in front of the trapdoors to the Travel Room.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to travel directly to it just type &#34;coc us&#34; (without quotations).\r<br />\r<br />I noticed that the mannequins are moving around the room when its first loaded.\r<br />To fix this just put armor on the mannequin and it will move back to where it should be.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I would recommend getting a Markarth banner re-texture mod if you do not like the original banner.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]When updating or changing versions, make sure to take all items out of all rooms of the mod as you may lose items&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please let me know if you find any problems with anything in the mod.",
