  "summary": "This is a mod to replace the female Expert Robes. It is a phoenix-like design on black robes with gold trim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "******\r\nUpdates\r\n> Added an alternate color scheme - black trim instead of gold.\r\n> Fixed a problem with folder arrangement in the original.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n- I am new to modding and decided to make my own design for some female college robes. It\\'s a simple retexture of the Expert Robes, with the robe colors changed to black and gold with a white phoenix design on the front and back. This is my first version.\r\n\r\n- To be clear, *this replaces all female Expert Robes in the game*.\r\n\r\n- To install just place in your Skyrim Data folder. There are two .dds files included (texture and normalmap) and a .nif (mesh). Make sure you put everything in the indicated folders.\r\n\r\n- If you are wondering why I included a .nif file:\r\nTwo sets of robes, Expert and Master Robes, share the same normalmap. I made my own normalmap for my Expert Robes and don\\'t want it to apply on the Master Robes, so I had to modify the mesh file so it points to the correct file. Just include all the files in the folder I provided and everything should work fine.\r\n\r\n- Here\\'s the console command to add a set of Expert Robes to your inventory:\r\n\r\nplayer.additem 0010D662 1\r\n\r\n- This is my first mod so feel free to comment/provide feedback. There shouldn\\'t be any bugs or issues, but please comment if you have questions. If there is any interest I might make more designs. I am open to suggestions. Thanks for checking it out!\r\n",
