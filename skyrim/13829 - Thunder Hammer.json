  "summary": "A massive two-handed smiting hammer, based on Ghosu\\'s Mjolnir.",
  "descriptionHtml": "After hearing from several people that they might be interested in a two-handed version of Ghosu\\'s Mjolnir v2, I decided to give it a shot.\r\nSo here we go. It\\'s basically Mjolnir on a long handle, which works just fine as a two-handed thunder hammer.\r\n\r\nThere are three versions, all with the same basic stats:\r\nMighty - Same as the regular Mjolnir. Will create a shockwave on impact, which sends everything in its radius flying. Also has a moderately powered shock damage enchantment. I slightly reduced the shockwave radius from ghosu\\'s original (from 25 to 10), since it seemed a little overkill.\r\nCalm - No shockwave effect, just the shock enchantment and a good chance to knockback your target.\r\nBasic - An unenchanted version for those who want to slap their own magic on the hammer.\r\n\r\nYou can obtain all three versions through forging, they\\'re under the Daedric category, and require the Daedric Smithing perk. Or use the console, type in >help \\\"thunder hammer\\\"< and then >player.additem (the code it displays) (quantity)<. \r\n\r\nIt might be slightly overpowered. I don\\'t really have a feeling if something\\'s over- or underpowered or not, but I\\'m more than willing to listen to feedback.\r\n\r\nThe hammer, featured in Brodual\\'s Weekly Mod Spotlight (at 0:47):\r\n[youtube]dD_2VlT8Hic[/youtube]\r\n\r\nFull credit for the enchantment code and Mjolnir itself goes to Ghosu, of course.\r\nHis original file can be found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9196\r\nGo give it a look if you\\'re more into one-handed weapons.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this mod in a mod/project of yours, I\\'d appreciate to be asked first. You probably also need permission from Ghosu.\r\nPlease don\\'t upload this to Steam Workshop without asking me first.",
