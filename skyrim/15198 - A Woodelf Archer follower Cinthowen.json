  "descriptionHtml": "Name: A Woodelf Archer follower Cinthowen\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nDate: 10/Apr/2012\r\nCategory: Companions\r\nRequired : Skyrim for Vanilla version;\r\n       \r\n       or: Apachii SkyHair for Apachii version;\r\n       http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\n       \r\nRecommended: Nexus  Mod Manager\r\nAuthor: eamico\r\nSource: http://www.tesnexus.com\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I apologize for my bad English.\r\n\r\nIntroduction.\r\nSince Oblivion, I always desired to have mu custom companions. Unfortunately, my scripting skill was not enough to manage a decent and stable script, so I was forced to use CM Companion Mod to have custom NPC  by my side, helping me in fighting Daedra. I was not too happy, but this was enough for me. Today, I am in condition to do my followers for Skyrim.  I like to share them with community. \r\nThis is one of them. \r\nI hope you can enjoy travelling Skyrim in good company. \r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis mod adds to the Skyrim Gameworld a female Woodelf Archer named Cinthowen that can be found in Jorrvaskr in Whirerun.\r\nIf you like it, please endorse the file.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nJorrvaskr in Whirerun. \r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nShe have a complete set of light armor in her inventory, and also some money, an elven bow and a dagger. For an archer this is enough. These items will be useful to her and player, if liked.\r\nWe can discuss until tomorrow about the look of this NPC. I don\\'t think that it is important. This is a follower mod, so it is important, in my opinion, to focus efforts on functions of the NPC, not on the look. If possible, it is right  to give a good appearance to new followers, but it is a secondary thing.\r\nThe appearance of this NPC remember the face of my Glaween follower, this is an evidence, but I started a new face from scratch; my goal was to have a decent looking female woodelf. Unfortunately, my efforts don\\'t gived hoped result. She is not ugly, but I failed in my goal to make her beautiful. Maybe that is impossible to build a decent-looking female woodelf using vanilla appearance of this race. I apologize. But in any case she is one of the best follower I never had in my game, probably the best archer I have seen in action until now in Skyrim; She will help you in your travels. This is the goal. \r\nPlease, avoid useless comments on the look of this NPC!\r\nShe live in Jorrvaskr, and is one of Companions. She Sleeps, eats, discuss there, and there she will come back when dismissed. I like this function, I will not change it. You must search for her there when help is needed, as you search Farkas or others companions. \r\nThere are several version of this file;\r\nin some version she have warpaint and in some not, in some she have vanilla hairs and in some others not; the name of file can make you understand what kind of NPC you\\'re downloading. For example, CinthowenVanillaHairNWNE means that Cinthowen will have vanilla hair, no warpaint and will be not essential, and so on for others versions. Best part are unessential. I don\\'t love immortality. When she is unessential, she is protected (it is not too easy to kill her, but can die), and in any case she can be married. You must choose ONLY ONE version, according to your preferences.\r\n\r\nIn my system are installed these mods.\r\n\r\nCBBE V3 (standard body) and the hip texture compatability pack:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nBella\\'s Better Females version 3:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nCover Eyes (eyes 1 file):\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869\r\n\r\nNo more blocky faces:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=30\r\n\r\nJoseph Antonys Lip Gloss for Better Females:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13860\r\n\r\nVanilla versions should also work with a vanilla install of Skyrim, but the look will be different from screenshots.\r\n\r\nIt is very important, in my opinion, to install CM Companion Level Mod by Cutthroat Mods;\r\nHere is the link:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13790\r\nThis mod will update the companion\\'s skills to their current level to keep pace with the player, so they will ever be good fighters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n\r\nI like very much Nexus Mod Manager, it is perfect for me. I suggest to use it, but....your choice.\r\n\r\nPick which method you are going to use for installation:\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Installation\r\n- = or = -\r\nManual installation \r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager installation:\r\nDownload the file with Nexus Mod Manager. Activate it. Done.\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\nPlace the zip file\\'s contents into your Skyrim/data folder to install and be sure to activate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\nPick which method you are going to use for uninstall based on how you installed it:\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Uninstall\r\n- = or = -\r\nManual Uninstall\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Uninstall\r\nOpen Nexus mod Manager and deactivate the file EACinthowen. Done.\r\n\r\n\r\nManual Uninstall\r\n\r\nRemove the zip file\\'s contents from your Skyrim/data folder to uninstall and be sure to deactivate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing.\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n=======\r\nVersion 1.0 is the initial version of this file.\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nNone known.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nIf you will try to use the SkyHair version and you have not installed it, your game will CTD. \r\nTo avoid problems, I suggest to use vanilla version.\r\nIf you decide to marry her, it is better to tell her where she can live with you BEFORE she leaves the temple in Riften.\r\nThis follower was developed to work with Multi followers, CM Companion Level mod and Ask Follower Skills. Running it with these mods means keeping it clear and bug free.\r\nThis do not means that it can\\'t be used under UFO;  I haven\\'t UFO, so I cannot say what can happen if you use it under UFO itself.\r\nTalking of load order, it is fundamental to run this file AFTER UFO itself, this can avoid best part of eventual problems.\r\nI can\\'t see any reason to develop a version specifically to run with UFO. If my files are clear without it, eventual problems are to be considered of UFO itself, not mine. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also download my other mods:\r\n\r\nA Breton Witchunter follower Samhair\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14686\r\n\r\nA Cute Redguard Follower Calypso\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13744\r\n\r\nA Nord Warrior Follower Shanya\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12893\r\n\r\nA Wood Elf Archer follower Glaween\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13258\r\n\r\nA Wood Elf Ranger follower Sharwyn\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15940\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0, 2012/04/10 - Initial release.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nYou can find me on TESNexus as eamico\r\nYou can send me an email here: eamico@tiscali.it\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\nThanks to TESNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\nSpecial thanks to Blackie for his CM New Companions mod that includes a top-notch detailed tutorial on how to create Skyrim companions without the face discoloration bug.
