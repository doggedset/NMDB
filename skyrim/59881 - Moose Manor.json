  "descriptionHtml": "Simple player home, but large enough for your followers to stay at&#33; \r<br />Current Version: 1.0 \r<br />\r<br />This simple player home is on a currently un-used space, only a few trees and rocks were removed for this house. The house exterior is similar to that of Riverwood. Yet this is no inn, but a full player home. It is remote but still you could get attacked by npc&#39;s and dragons&#33; Dragons can also land on the roof, so you really need to kill that dragon fast. The house will however respawn if it happens to be destroyed, interior will not be affected (default rules). \r<br />\r<br />The interior is a cloned Riverwood inn and changed, this means you still have the hidden room and it serves as storage. The bar has been removed and it is now a open floor, also on that same side is now a new staircase that leads down to another room. \r<br />\r<br />I did not add too much storage to prefend the god-like storage abilities a lot of player homes do have. Each tab of your inventory has it&#39;s own storage chest (except for &#39;all&#39; -tab of course&#33;). There is a extra chest for your mod armor and a chest for mod weapons. \r<br />\r<br />There is outside a few things that I added, such as a woodchopping block, some usable plants, misc objects and lantarns. It&#39;s only the first version and I intend to add more in the future. \r<br />\r<br />* NOTE: You could also install the Steam version&#33; http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=340519809 *\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />======= \r<br />Location \r<br />======= \r<br />\r<br />See the pictures for hints of the location, no key or quest needed. you can enter when ever you want. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />========== \r<br />Future Ideas \r<br />========== \r<br />\r<br />Some of the future ideas are listed here, although that does not mean it will actually make the next version or even be added at all. Ideas are just ideas&#33; \r<br />\r<br />- Cave/mine (seperate cell and nearby) \r<br />- Interior changes \r<br />- Forge \r<br />- Smelter \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />================== \r<br />Suggestions - Requests \r<br />================== \r<br />\r<br />If you have any suggestions or requests, please do post it&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />==== \r<br />Bugs \r<br />==== \r<br />\r<br />None known at this time.",
