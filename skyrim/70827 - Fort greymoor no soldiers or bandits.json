  "descriptionHtml": "Some wish to mod this fort, but didn&#39;t know how to remove bandits and the soldiers. Now the bandits spawn, but don&#39;t reset and the troops won&#39;t take over the fort.\r<br />\r<br />However, In the ck one will find stuff toggled off until the soldiers take over the fort, beds and chests with some items. They will never be used now. I would have cleared them, but some house modders want to enable a new door to a new edited cell to not break anything so I just left them.\r<br />\r<br />If you wish, you can already use it as player home. The containers already don&#39;t respawn expect for the boss chest. This is a highly requested fort after all. But no crafting or anything extra is added to it, as it meant as modder resource and wanted it as unedited as possible.Â ",
