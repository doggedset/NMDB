  "descriptionHtml": "**Update 2:\r\nAdded the helmet retexture I forgot to add as an update file so you don\\'t have to download the whole pack again if you already did. Helmet now matches the rest of the armor.\r\n\r\n**Update:\r\nUpdated downloads with a new version 2.1\r\n\r\n2.1 includes an esp that makes the gloves and boots standalone now, leaving the fur gauntlets and boots alone. \r\nYou can also forge a full set of Stormcloak armor (regular armor, sleeved armor, gauntlets, boots, and helmet) at any forge under the Leather category.\r\n\r\nMaking the esp was easier than I expected using Sky Edit and TES V Snip. There\\'s also ground models included so they show up properly in the forge and inventory. Enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince I prefer to play as a Nord and prefer the Stormcloak side as opposed to the Imperials, I wanted to atleast look decent in my infantry armor. This retextures both the male and female stormcloak armors (regular infantry only) to have black chainmail instead of scale armor, as well as a darker blue sash. This works on the sleeved and sleeveless versions of the armor. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nDrop the textures folder into Data as per usual",
