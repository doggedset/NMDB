  "summary": "An overhaul of the default eyes. This is a replacer.",
  "descriptionHtml": "EYES: SKYRIM\n<br />\n<br />Originally posted March 4, 2012\n<br />\"due to the conflict of interest created by the Steam Workshop attempting to claim ownership of modders' IP, I must insist that nothing I create ever has the potential of being uploaded there.\"\n<br />\n<br />DO NOT UPLOAD MY ASSETS TO THE STEAM WORKSHOP.\n<br />You will be hit with a DMCA take down.\n<br />\n<br />I decided to finally get around to making new eyes for the game, since I had today off... Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! :)\n<br />\n<br />This is a complete overhaul of the default eyes. Every eye in game has been replaced, along with eyelashes, where applicable, with my own custom made textures.\n<br />Even the werewolf and vampire eyes have gotten a make over.\n<br />\n<br />OPTIONAL FILES\n<br />\n<br />Vampire Variations is a pack of 8 eyes with subtle differences for those would like something more for their vampire. Please check the index image to see which eye texture you would like to use, and follow the directions included in the archived pack.\n<br />\n<br />Werewolf Variations is a pack of 8 eyes with striking differences for those who want something a little different. Please check the index image to see which eye texture you would like to use, and follow the directions included in the archived pack.\n<br />\n<br />Red Orc Variations is a pack of 9 eyes with varying differences, some quite subtle, for those who want something a little different. Please check the included index image to see which eye texture you would like to use, and follow the directions included in the archived pack.\n<br />\n<br />Blue Orc Variations is a pack of 6 eyes with varying differences for those who want something a little different. Please check the included index image to see which eye texture you would like to use, and place the corresponding eye texture into skyrim&#92;data&#92;textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;eyes, allowing it to overwrite.\n<br />\n<br />The green Orc eye, which is a single eye texture instead of several variations, replaces the blind eye texture.\n<br />\n<br />Vampire as Werewolf was supposed to replace the human werewolf eye with the vampire eye, as requested. It does not replace the human variant, since there is no human version. I still have no idea which eye it replaces, since I have not seen it in game anywhere.\n<br />\n<br />NEW EYES FOR DAWNGUARD\n<br />Vampire Eyes Update for Dawnguard Users:\n<br />-----------------------------------------------------------\n<br />There are two sets which will overwrite the vanilla eyes in separate folders.\n<br />1 and 2. You can only use one set at a time, but they can be mixed from each folder.\n<br />See screenshots for files.\n<br />\n<br />The glowing cat eyes mesh will make all Khajiit have glowing eyes. It actually looks pretty cool, but if you have a mod that already does this, or an .esp file that changes only the vampire Khajiit to have glowing eyes, then do not use these.\n<br />\n<br />The No Yellow Glow Human simply changes the bright yellow self illumination (emissive) to be gray, so the color of the eye textures can come through without looking like slices of lemons.\n<br />This will not change all NPC vampires, since their facegen geometry is stored in hex named files, and all of those have the yellow glow eye mesh included in them.\n<br />No, I am not going through hundreds of numerically named files just to change a few dozen NPC vampires.\n<br />\n<br />AS OF 07-14-2018 NONE OF MY ASSETS ARE TO BE USED BY ANYONE FOR ANY PURPOSE.\n<br />If you don't like this change, thank the moderators for siding with plagiarizers and lying thieves on this site.",
