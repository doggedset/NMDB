  "descriptionHtml": "[center][/center][center][font=Comic Sans MS][size=4]\"That which doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger\"[/size][/font][/center]\n<br />   ﻿check the new version of the mod here [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88977]Stronger by Killing and Endure[/url]\n<br />\n<br />   This mod is about a gameplay from years ago, like 4 years ago. What I wanted was, for every npc i killed, i would receive bonus from those kills like, health stamina magicka and carryWeight, so since i had no idea about modding, I was oppening console commande and typing codes to give me those boost for every single npcs i killed, lol, yah I know it wasn't a nice or immersive way to do it so, know that i know a little bit of how to mod skyrim, I brought this idea to live. I presente you STRONGER BY KILLING.\n<br />\n<br />[b]HOW IT WORK[/b]\n<br />\n<br />For every NPC you kill you get bonus from the. The mod is disabled by default from the beggining. By activating it through MCM you a get a lesserPower (Absorve from the dead) use that power on any npc you kill to get the respective bonus.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Mostly npc will give you one bonus only (health, magicka, stamina or carryWeight), but others two or three bonus, the mod lets you see what bonus did you get by displaying a message at top left corner, this feacture can be toogle On and Off.\n<br />\n<br />The amount of bonus you get is customizable throught the MCM sliders, and each bonus can be disabled by turning the value to zero. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]REQUIREMENTS[list]\n<br />[*]Dawnguard\n<br />[*]Dragonborn\n<br />[*]SKSE\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]SkyUI\n<br />[/list][/b]\n<br />OBS: when you use the lesserPower on the npc, the npc will be teleported to oblivion, so a good tip is, loot the body before absorve it.",
