  "descriptionHtml": "Im going to start off by saying this is my first mod so there may be incomplete things and/or many bugs. If you find any PLEASE PM ME THEM&#33; Im also open to ANY suggestions, or questions, so please ask away. For example if somone has bad fps because of the grass just ask and i will make a grass free version. I will gladly do any requests.\r<br />\r<br />IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS STARTING THE QUEST, GO TO THE ARGONIAN, TRY TO TALK TO HIM, SAVE, LOAD, AND TRY AGAIN&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b] [color=blue]Redview House Mod[/color] [/b]\r<br />\r<br />Add&#39;s a small worldspace accessed from a statue outside Whiterun, or by using a spell book found by the statue. The house itself is rather small and simple. It however includes everything you could ever need, and best of all its uses the General Storage mod&#33; Im going to keep this short and sweet, so to get to the house you need to go to the Whiterun Stables and just a few feet away you should see a large statue, just go up to it and activate it. Than go to house across the river and talk to the argonian inside and do the simple quest.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This next bit has little to do with playing with the mod, but more with what I have planned with it in the future. So some of you may be wondering, what can you possibly have planned for a house mod? Well, I dont want it to be just a House mod, soon I want it to be a mod that includes several new quests, locations, and items. All of which will be located in the world of Redview, which is only the landscape you see in the mod now, but soon it will be much larger with many new things. I would gladly take volunteers if anyone wants to help, but no matter what I will countinue to work on this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b] [color=yellow]IM LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO HELP, IF INTERESTED PM ME&#33;&#33;[/color] [/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b] [color=red] Version 1.0 (Released 4/26/14): [/color]  [/b]\r<br />\r<br />-Fully Nav-meshed landscape and interior cells, bring you&#39;re friends&#33;\r<br />-First basic version of the house, very simple and small.\r<br />-Small Landscape for house\r<br />\r<br />[b] [color=red] Version 1.1 (Released 4/27/14): [/color] [/b]\r<br />-Added a Teleport Spell to Redview, you can find the book on a bench just by the portal or another one inside the house.
