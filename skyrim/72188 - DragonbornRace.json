  "summary": "The night was quiet, not a peak throughout the forest. It was a bit creepy but I tried not to think about it, as I listened to my grandfather’s story. The campfire was bright but kept us warm through the winter night. \r<br />“He was fast, yes he was. I never saw someone so ",
  "descriptionHtml": "It is a balanced race that you can build in any direction or combination of.\r<br />You can start as a Dragonborn of any race. All skill start at 15, and the spell and abilities are in the images above.\r<br />If you do not see them on your character do not worry just play you will find out later.\r<br />what these spell and ability can do fully is for you to find out, because no one knows the true strength of the Dragonborn.\r<br />\r<br />Install using MO or unzip and Skyrim Data folder.\r<br />Need nothing to install.\r<br />1 bug I could not figure out in race menu.  If hair and thing stop working just change the preset character slide and try again.  This fixed it for myself and beta tester everytime.  I do not know why it does it but if there is some one who does and knows how to fix it tell me. Would love to understand why and fix it.",
