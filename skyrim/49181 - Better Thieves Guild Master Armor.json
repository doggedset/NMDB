  "descriptionHtml": "Now once upon a time, in an imaginary world called Skyrim there was a guild called (funnily enough) the Thieves Guild. Now in said guild you had to go through an incredibly long process in order to actually get hold of the appropriately named &#34;Guild Master&#39;s Armor&#34; but boy when you got it was it worth it, boasting a huge improvement over the regular counterpart.....\r<br />\r<br />And then dear Bethesda came along and buggered it all up, now you can get a set of armor at the very start of the game that is better than all the other Thieves Guild armor and only requires a 2 second snatch and grab quest on Solstheim.\r<br />\r<br />Enter my incredibly basic mod&#33; \r<br />\r<br />What the mod does is increase the enchantments on the Guild Masters armor to actually make it worth having, since if you have Dragonborn, then it really isn&#39;t worth the effort any more.\r<br />\r<br />The actual enchantments haven&#39;t been changed, they are the same as they are in the vanilla version, however the potency has been increased to 45% for each of the skills and 60 for the carry weight. the armor value has been increased to slightly over that of the Blackguard armor as well. after all the aim wasn&#39;t to turn you into a God, but make a point to the Guildmasters armor.\r<br />\r<br />Finally after all my ramblings (apologies for that) this is my first mod, but it shouldnt conflict with anything since its a direct change to the armor itself, and as far as I am aware I no one else has posted something like this.\r<br />\r<br />Happy Skyriming&#33;",
