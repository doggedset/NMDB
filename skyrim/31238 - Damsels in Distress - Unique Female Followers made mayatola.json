If you find one when adventuring with a previous one, the old one walks away when you recruit the new one. If told to wait at home, they are okay, but you can only have 1 at a time active. Lydia is not affected by any of this.\r\n\r\n-I found this too\r\n\r\nI see that maybe AFT is adding packages and it collides with my packages\r\n\r\n1. rescue and recruit one\r\n2. rescue and recruit the second\r\n3. i can have them both in my team with no problem \r\n4. i dismiss them, in any order\r\n5. they stay where we are and they doesn´t return to the nearest bar to them\r\n\r\n-If they don´t walk away from the cage, dismiss your actual follower, recruit the recently rescued one, escort her outside the dungeon, and dismiss her, sooner or later she will walk away to the inn\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSolutions\r\n\r\n-It dont haves trouble if you recruit the first one and leave all the others return to their home and then recruit them at the bar, or if you want to recruit another one diferent from the actuall one in your team, dismiss the actual one and then recruit the new. sorry about that.\r\n\r\n-If they don´t walk away from the cage, dismiss your actual follower, recruit the recently rescued one, escort her outside the dungeon, and dismiss her, sooner or later she will walk away to the inn\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod released, so It will be bugged in some point but i will fix it if you let me know, i have tested by one real day of play and dind´t found troubles, thnx in advance, hope it likes you.",
