  "summary": "This mod allows you to turn back to your previous human race appearance after feeding for 1day,instead of a bony skeleton face. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "  According to lore,Cyrodiil vampires are experts of concealment,who can\\'t be distinguished after feeding\r\n  \r\n  Assume that now you are the one who has this ability,after feeding you will be able to maintian your human appearance for 1/2/3day, and you can also feed again under your human appearance, if not get feed over 1/2/3day,your appearance will be changed to the bony vampire againso to keep beauty, remind to feed often,my dear Lestat~\r\n   \r\n  Attention:\r\n   the newest file is version 1.5,whether you had used older version or not, you still need to feed once to activate it.\r\n   you will be given a less power named vampire\\'s disguise after you get feed,the power let you toggle on/off your human form at anytime,in order to be compatible with those mods that truely demanding you to be in vampire form to get some power/spell/ability to work.\r\n   if you are using older version 1.0/1.1, you must delete PlayerVampireQuestScript.pex under your data/scripts folder, it\\'s no longer in use since the new version 1.2.\r\n   for the script file PlayerVampireQuestScript.pex under data/scripts/, if there has been one and it\\'s not mine old version of 1.1/1.0, just leave it alone, if it is mine, delete it\r\n   for those who used 1.2/1.3/1.3fix which is the version without Source,I recommand you to use the newest one with Source files, and strongly recommand you to use the mod on a really clean save that no older version of this mod has involved.\r\n  \r\n \r\n  Install & Usage:\r\n  zip out and put them under your data folder include the scripts\r\n  I know a lot of mods will enable you to have some other feed methods,however in order to have this mod work, you should always use mine option,even if had there been one that you have to use it\\'s feed functions,you can just do the \\\"feed\\\" 2 times\r\n  I\\'ve write a new button named \\\"feed to maintain human-form\\\",which has no confliction with the feed button in vanilla game, and to make the mod work you should always use the button to feed, the new feed button calls the vanilla feed process, so it makes the same effect as the vanilla and in addition it will count your feeding status separately for my new script.\r\n  I replaced your vanilla double blind eyes to the vampire\\'s eyes, so if anyone want to have the vampire eyes in human form,just showracemenu and switch your color to it.\r\n  *Compability:\r\n   I did some extra work in order to make it compatible with some popular known vampire mods on nexus.\r\n  Since the new version has it\\'s own feed button and it\\'s own script, it should be compatible,or at least work with any other mods(except one possiblity: the modder changes the function name \\\"vampirefeed()\\\", but definately no one would be willing to do this ),but still you will lose some ability that are added based on race ablilities,such as vampire night vision(the only vanilla one,to which I fixed it),this will makes you lose such vampire race abilities in other mods, in this case, after version 1.5 you can use your vampire\\'s disguise power to toggle off you human form, and these lost vampire abilities will work again.  \r\n  Feeding on newly-dead NPCs has also been implemented\r\n  This should be compatible with: \r\n   Vampirism Dawn of Blood\r\n   Advanced Legendary Werewolves and Vampires\r\n   Better Werewolves and Vampires\r\n   ECotN - Enhancements for Vampires and Werewolves \r\n   Vampire Upgrade \r\n  Known issues:\r\n   I can\\'t guarantee that it is 100% compatible with those mods above,some thing small may still conflicts, cuz this is not tested out fully.\r\n   If you had any other mod that enable you to feed under human form,you may see the 2 feed button,one is original, the other named feed to maintain human-form is mine\r\n   If you are in human form as a vampire,completing the werewolf quest will not remove your vampire state,cuz you are considered as real human,and you can be the both.\r\n   you may need to sneak down to get the feed activated\r\n  PS&#65306;it takes me really a bit hard work to get it done,if you like it,endorsement will be appreciated/",
