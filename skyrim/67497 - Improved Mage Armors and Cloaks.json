  "descriptionHtml": "Improved Mage Armors and Cloaks:\r<br />\r<br />All spells are at the college. The spells are copies so NPcs won&#39;t be able to use these spells... I did not touch the original spells.  This also saved me a few perk points... All stats to the spells are the same and the price as well, they just last much longer... \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Flame Cloak: (Lasts 1hr)\r<br />Frost Cloak: (Lasts 1hr)\r<br />Lightning Cloak: (Lasts 1hr)\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------------------\r<br />Oakflesh - Novice (Lasts 1hr)\r<br />Stoneflesh - Apprentice (Lasts 1hr)\r<br />Ironflesh - Adept (Lasts 1hr)\r<br />Ebonyflesh - Expert (Lasts 1hr)\r<br />Dragonhide - Master (Lasts 2hr)\r<br />----------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Note: if you want to turn off the spells then just wait a few hours...\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------------------------Note:-------------------\r<br />\r<br />Version.2 Coming up soon:\r<br />\r<br />Upcoming spells and fixes: Dragonhide nerf to the casting time to the same as the other armors.\r<br />Adding 1 more cloak Whirlwind Cloak...\r<br />Nerfing the time of the cloaks to 5 mins I think 1hr is a little too long for the cloak spells...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Mage armor is complete BS. Why I made this mod:\r<br />\r<br />got sick of casting the same damn spells over and over again, no point of it being off in the first place needs to be a passive to be honest. This mod makes my life a hell of a lot easier, lol...\r<br />\r<br />A &#34;proper&#34; mage doesn&#39;t wear armor. But they do have various mage armor spells, which can raise their armor value to something reasonable (although still below what armored characters enjoy) for a short time. So you have to keep re-casting the spell every few minutes. Fighters don&#39;t have to worry about all their armor vanishing in mid-fight and leaving them vulnerable to an instant kill, but mages do. Imagine if fighters had their armor fall off every couple of minutes, it took them several seconds and a good chunk of their main combat resource to re-equip it, and doing so made sounds that alerted all nearby enemies.\r<br />______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",
