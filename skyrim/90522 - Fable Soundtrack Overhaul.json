Like The Elder Scrolls, it has a huge and beautiful soundtrack throughout the franchise. This mod will bring the nostalgic music of Fable into Skyrim, completely replacing it and changing the feel of your game.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][color=#f1c232][size=4]What has been replaced?\n<br />[/size][/color]Everything. From the main theme, to dungeons and combat. Walk the great Halls of Skyrim to the theme of Castle Fairfax, or drink at the inn to the music of Reaver's Mansion. All of the music in this mod has been carefully selected to match it's Skyrim counterpart so that it is as fitting as possible. You'll find music from every game in the franchise (excluding Fable: Legends) in this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#f1c232]Permissions and credits[/color]\n<br />[/size][size=2]I do not own any of the audio in this mod, so I don't have authority over its distribution.[/size]\n<br />All credit for the composition of this music belongs to Microsoft.\n<br />An official account on Microsoft game content usage can be found [url=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/developers/rules]here[/url]﻿.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]Music Used\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />[/font][/center]",
