  "summary": "The Haunting of Breezehome is a Necromancy-centered plugin, that adds a new basement/dungeon area to Breezehome, adds new conjuration spells, along with a small quest for obtaining these spells. This is a lore-friendly quest with a TES history.\r\n\r\nThe quest is initiated by entering the new basement of Breezehome.",
  "descriptionHtml": "REQUIREMENTS:\r\nFuz Ro D-oh (allows dialogue to run at a readable rate)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14884//?\r\n\r\nThe depths of Breezehome are walked by the undead and haunted by spirits. In order to cleanse Breezehome, you must delve into the dark past of the previous owner, and his family\\'s legacy.\r\n\r\nAdds 7 new conjuration spells, including:\r\n\r\n4 summonable undead creatures (Apprentice, Adept, and 2 Expert)\r\n3 new direct-damage conjuration spells\r\n\r\nAlso adds a new staff with unique spell visuals, as well as expanding the home of Breezehome.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nSometimes, the NPC in the basement needed to start the quest does not appear. A reload usually fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nDuring the final fight, your character may attempt finishing moves on the boss that don\\'t kill him. In this case, summon a non-humanoid (atronach, for example) or use destruction/conjuration magic to kill him. I\\'m currently trying to find out why this happens.",
