  "modName": "Ingun the Vampire companion",
  "summary": "Ingun search for a cure leads her to alchemy. The player can marry her, and she\\'s a follower.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Backstory: Ingun Black-Briar has refused to follow in her family\\'s unscrupulous business in Riften... but has a dark side of her own. Infected with Sanguinare Vampiris and ultimately becoming a vampire, she vowed to find a cure, leading her to the path of alchemy. \r\n\r\nThis mod makes Ingun marriageable and enables her to be a follower. Having become a vampire, she has vampire AI, their strengths (and weaknesses), and also won\\'t be attacked by other vampires by default. She does level with the PC, but seems to get overwhelmed quickly when mobbed by melee. All of the dialog for companion/marriage is included, which makes her feel like a very complete NPC to have around.\r\n\r\nNote that to marry her and/or to make her follow you, you have to gain her trust (she has a task she wants you to do). So start collecting those nirnroots =)\r\n\r\nINSTALL: Drop the files in your \\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\data folder. Make sure the data file is checked in your launcher. You need to drop the meshes folder in there too, or else it\\'ll bug out the face tint.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1.2: Just for some lore/backstory, I whipped up a quick journal that goes into how she became a vamp.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I changed her stance with version 1.1. You can see before/after photos, but basically before she had her arms arched like a warrior, which didn\\'t seem to match. I changed it so her arms go straight down, which looks less butch.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Equip her like a Nightblade/spellsword. She does have the ability to cast destruction spells, though I never see her do it. Light armor and 1-handed weapons are her forte.\r\n- Vampires and werewolves don\\'t mix. When strong enough she\\'s imnmune to the howl, but turns on you if you swing and hit her. Run like mad, when you turn back human you can talk to her again. \r\n- She also doesn\\'t seem to like rank 4 vampires. I\\'ve tried everything I could to change her AI behavior, it may be something that can\\'t be fixed until the CK comes out. If you find solutions I\\'m all ears though.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
