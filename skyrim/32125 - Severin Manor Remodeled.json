  "descriptionHtml": "Current Version: v3\r\nRequires Dawnguard, Hearthfire, & Dragonborn.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod is still a work in progress! V3 brings some small changes to the upstairs including a formal dining table, and a Hearthfire oven, and additional mannequins and display cases to the library. Otherwise is the same. I haven\\'t forgotten about this mod, I\\'m just sad to say I\\'m really struggling with the scripting aspect to bring spouses and children to Severin Manor. I haven\\'t given up on it though, and will keep trying my best to bring this functionality to my mod as soon as possible. \r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nI enjoy spending a lot of time on Solstheim, and I love Severin Manor. Trouble is, I felt it was missing something...so I took matters into my own hands and remodeled it into something I like. I can\\'t vouch for how lore friendly structurally it is, but I tried my best to stick to the atmosphere inside to keep it the way it was as much as possible. Every single bookshelf in the house now functions as a bookshelf as well instead of just being a shelf (and I never want to see another bookshelf again).\r\n\r\n\r\nNew additions:\r\n\r\nUpstairs Entryway:\r\n- Hearthfire Oven\r\n- Formal dinning setup\r\n\r\nLibrary Wing includes\r\n- 7 bookcases\r\n- 8 standing large display cases\r\n- 10 mannequins\r\n\r\nStorage Wing Includes\r\n- 1 storage chest\r\n- 7 storage barrels (4 default)\r\n- 6 large storage sacks (2 default)\r\n- 3 small storage sacks (3 default)\r\n- 1 bookcase \r\n\r\nHousecarl\\'s Quarters Includes (No Housecarl compatibility yet)\r\n- 1 bookcase\r\n- 1 storage chest\r\n- 1 mannequin\r\n\r\nExpanded Smithy\\'s Wing Includes\r\n- 4 small display cases\r\n- 14 weapon racks\r\n- 3 storage chests\r\n- 2 bookcases\r\n- 2 storage barrels (2 default)\r\n\r\nChildren\\'s Wing (Under construction, no child compatibility yet)\r\n\r\nAlchemy room + Enchanting room includes\r\n- no new additions (barrels moved to storage area).\r\n\r\nMaster Bedroom Includes\r\n- 3 standing large display cases (default)\r\n- 8 weapon racks (8 default)\r\n- 2 small display cases\r\n- 3 storage chests (2 default)\r\n- 4 mannequins (4 default)\r\n\r\nSpecial secret room, for Vampire Coffins\r\n- 2 Vampire Coffins\r\n- 2 potions of blood\r\n\r\n...and more stuff I\\'ve forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe master bedroom, enchanting room, and alchemy room for the most part are the same as before as I liked them as they were. Some things have been shifted to other locations in the house. I may make changes in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibility: Will most likely not be compatible with other mods that alter Severin Manor.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation/Upgrading: REMOVE ALL ITEMS FROM SEVERIN MANOR BEFORE USING/UPGRADING. I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. I will not be held responsible if you leave them inside and items are lost as a consequence. You\\'ve been warned!\r\n\r\nThis mod works best if you have not yet entered Severin Manor for the first time. If you have, it may not properly update the interior. If this happens, walk outside, open the console and type \\\"pcb\\\" followed by \\\"resetinterior dlc2rrseverinhouse\\\". It should get things as they should be, though sometimes the changes don\\'t update properly still.\r\n\r\nNote: The small secret room is not accessible until you own the house. It just didn\\'t make sense, so once you own the house, you can open it and use the (now existent!) coffins.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Improvements:\r\n\r\nFinish the remodel (a lot still needs to be done).\r\nAdd and adjust lighting.\r\nAdd Housecarl compatibility (if its even possible, might take a long time for me to do as I\\'ve never scripted before and this is my first mod).\r\nAdd spouse compatibility (see above)\r\nAdd adopted children compatibility (see above the above!)\r\n...and probably more stuff I forgot.\r\n\r\nRecommended Mods: \r\nUnlimited Bookshelves by da5id2701 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10891\r\n\r\nAs I\\'ve added a lot of fully functional bookshelves, and this mod is great for putting more than just books on them in a neat and tidy fashion.\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n\r\nv2\r\n\r\n- Finished Housecarl\\'s rooms + storage quarters remodel + lighting. (No Housecarl compatibility yet)\r\n- Finished Library remodel + lighting.\r\n- Finished Master bedroom + secret room remodel + lighting.  (No Spouse compatibility yet)\r\n- Finished forge remodel + lighting.\r\n- Finished Upstairs, Main Hall, enchanting room, and Alchemy lab remodel + lighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.BETA\r\n\r\n-Initial Release.",
