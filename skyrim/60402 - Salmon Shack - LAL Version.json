It&#39;s near the cart of Solitude,\r<br />so no matter for who don&#39;t use fast travel, and of course is near Solitude to buy foods and other things.\r<br />Since there are some NPCs near the shack, the foods inside it will respawns as usual in exterior places (call this as &#34;lore&#34;).\r<br />However there is a safe chest (the only one&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />* HOW TO SELECT THIS ADDON FROM DIALOGUE LIST *\r<br />When you start a new game with LAL, after character creation, activate the statue of Mara and choos &#34;I&#39;ve a shack near Solitude&#34;\r<br />\r<br />* LOADING ORDER *\r<br />First LAL, then this mod.\r<br />\r<br />* INSTALLATION *\r<br />Just unpack the rar and put the ESP into data folder.
