  "descriptionHtml": "This mod was made as I felt Ivarstead was quite...... bland. No blacksmith, no general store, no gate and no home, Ivarstead has nothing useful. Well we can change that has to had people&#33;  My Ivarstead Revamp Mod will add full blacksmithing facilities, a blacksmith merchant, a general store and your very own player home&#33; There also has been a gate and guard walkway added, along with a small dock and foot bridge. \r<br />\r<br />I have put a lot of time into this mod and it is my very first one. I plan on adding new features (e.g. guards on bridge, cart, stables) but all suggestions are welcome and I will try and cater to them as best I can&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Please notify me if you find any bugs, problems or anything that needs to be corrected and I will try to fix them all.\r<br />\r<br />This mod can also be located on Steam: \r<br />\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=229948562\r<br />\r<br />Update Log:\r<br />1.1 - Initial Nexus release\r<br />\r<br />1.2 - Update adding a Jarl (Jarl Orkul), his Steward (Valmir) and his son and Housecarl (Grul), who can be a follower and partner, and of course a Longhouse where they all can be found. Stables added just outside the new entrance, with 4 horses and the Stable Buck, Wilbur. Finally, a New Guard Tower has been added just down the hill from Ivarstead, which can be used as a player home (Bed, Cooking Pot, Arcane Enchanter, Personal Storage, Supplies etc.) and a new unmarked quest has been added, just read the note beside the door. Hat tip to LABTECH for the ideas and requests&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Made By Eddie Mallon",
