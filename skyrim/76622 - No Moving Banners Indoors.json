If the wind is this strong, why is that candle still lit?\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][size=3][b]The Fix:[/b]\n<br />[img]https://media.giphy.com/media/HdJsEsa4VqEHS/giphy.gif[/img][/size][/u]\n<br />A perfectly calm banner because there isn't wind indoors. \n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[u]Description:[/u]\n<br />This mod is really simple.\n<br />I walked into Dragon's Reach and noticed that the banners were waving around for some reason. Now I guess it could be a draft or something, But let's be honest, it's not. \n<br />\n<br />Enter this mod: A mod that makes all banners interiors static. A mod I whipped up in around 2 hours to fix to fix this annoyance.\n<br />\n<br />This mod removes animations from the banners that in interiors. It doesn't overwrite any vanilla meshes and all the new static meshes have been manually replaced by hand.\n<br />\n<br />Note: I didn't edit Sovngarde's banners because It seems logical that those should still be waving. \n<br />\n<br />[u]Compatibility:[/u]\n<br />This mod has been cleaned with Tes5Edit and checked for errors. It is not likely to conflict with much except for mods that modify the banners (If any do that for some reason). Compatible with any re-textures that uses the default texture paths for banners. I recommend using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13429/?]Design of the Nords[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Here is a [url=http://pastebin.com/yMpEeDzy]full list[/url] of interior cells that now have static banners. \n<br />\n<br />It seems that ELFX Enhancers causes some of the banners to disappear from certain angles. Not sure why this is, but i'm looking into it. Normal ELFX works fine however. \n<br />\n<br />[u]Install:[/u]\n<br />Install with mod manager. Activate in load order. Position in load order does not matter.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Permissions:[/u]\n<br />You may use this mod for absolutely anything you want as long as you don't make money off of it. This includes the static meshes. \n<br />\n<br />[url=http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Open_Modding][img width=748,height=92]http://i.imgur.com/dhy1tdz.png[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[u]Bugs/Issues:[/u]\n<br />I really only replaced banners in locations where i've noticed the effect and it's bothered me. But if i've missed somewhere let me know. \n<br />\n<br />[u]Credits:[/u]\n<br />Besthesda for the meshes\n<br />Niftools for Nifskope\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size]",
