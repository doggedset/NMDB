  "summary": "The Chiss Race is from KOTOR (Knight of the old Republic) and this mod exists purely because somebody suggested it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />    &#34;The Chiss do not simply accept alien concepts without careful consideration. We certainly do not submit to domination. By anyone.&#34; \r<br />    â€•Mitth&#39;raw&#39;nuruodo[src]\r<br />\r<br />The Chiss were a tall, blue-skinned Near-Human civilization from the planet Csilla in the Unknown Regions, best known to most Humans as the people to which Grand Admiral Thrawn belonged. Due to the remote position of their home territory in the Chiss Ascendancy they remained largely an enigma to the rest of the galaxy, and contact with outsiders was limited even in the days of the Galactic Alliance. \r<br />\r<br />---Wookipedia\r<br />\r<br />The mod adds the race mentioned within the game.  It includes a few Eye textures as required for the race to seem propper but the race is identical to the Nord race minus height.",
