  "descriptionHtml": "*I AM CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR HELP FROM SOMEONE WITH BETTER SCRIPTING ABILITIES THAN MYSELF TO ADD IN NPCS (SUCH AS GUARDS, MAGE, SMITH ETC) AND HELP FINISH THIS MOD. I ALSO APOLOGISE FOR MY SLOW SPEED IN UPDATING THIS MOD AS I AM CURRENTLY WINDING DOWN MY STUDIES FOR MY PRACTICAL PHASE AT SEA (WHERE I WILL BE UNABLE TO WORK ON MODS DUE TO WORKLOAD AND A LACK OF INTERNET CONNECTION).*\r<br />\r<br /> This is my first mod and overhauls the Volkihar castle to being a worthy home for the Dragonborn&#33;Â \r<br />\r<br />In its current state you should only install this AFTER COMPLETING DAWNGUARD. Because reasons.\r<br />\r<br />Fleshes out and redecorates the interior of the Volkihar Castle, and turns the cathedral into a vault for all your display and storage needs&#33; Adds various displays and mannequins throughout the castle and Npcs such as maids and a bard. Plenty of room for followers and fully navmeshed. Requires Dawnguard, Hearthfires and Dragonborn.\r<br />\r<br />As it stands currently this mod consists of:\r<br />\r<br />-Renovated and re-imagined Great Hall\r<br />-Renovated Smithy with smelter, forge, leatherworking stand, workbench and grinding wheel\r<br />-Renovated and re-imagined Wizarding Quarter with alchemy, enchanting and staff enchanting stations\r<br />-Cleaned and redesigned kitchens with two maids\r<br />-Cleaned and chilled Castles Stores\r<br />-Tranquil Private Quaters, complete with its own interior garden, Lab and four poster bed\r<br />-Follower/guard quarters with 6 beds\r<br />-a new secret area/bolt hole with displays and a mannequin (check the wardrobes&#33;)\r<br />-A re-imagined cathedral, now as a museum/vault with extensive displays and mannequins\r<br />\r<br />there are currently 24 mannequins and many more weapon displays throughout.\r<br />\r<br />In the future I hope to add a castle blacksmith, court wizard and guards, aswell as makin the changes only occur when Harkon is defeated.",
