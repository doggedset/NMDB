  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple mod that turns Lydia from a big beefy warrior into a adept destruction mage. I changed her combat behavior, so this hopefully means she will no longer tear off mindlessly into battle. She still is the Houscarl of Whiterun thus acts like one. As the title states this is version one, so if you find a bug just comment of PM me. This is also my first mod, but I am hopefully going to make some more character changes to other followers. If you have a follower in mind simply comment who, and what you want me to change about her/he.\r<br />\r<br />-IMPORTANT\r<br />If you load Skyrim and she does not have the armor I gave her it is because the armor Bethesda chose to give her is better then the robes I gave her. Simply take he current armor and she will equip the robes.\r<br />\r<br />-Changlog\r<br />Added v1.1 which no longer need ApachiiSkyHair\r<br />\r<br />-Spells\r<br />-Armor and Weapons\r<br />-Requirements\r<br />-Mods I use\r<br />-Incompatibility&#39;s\r<br />-Instructions\r<br />\r<br />-Spells She Has:\r<br />FrostBite (this is her favorite)\r<br />ConjureFlameArkatronach\r<br />Healing\r<br />HealingHands\r<br />\r<br />If you have a spell you would like me to make her use, once again, comment or PM me.\r<br />\r<br />-Armor and Weapons:\r<br />WallofFlamesStaff\r<br />AdeptMageRobes\r<br />\r<br />-Requirements:\r<br />v1 requires AppachiSkyHair, whereas v1.1 does not.\r<br />\r<br />-Mods I used in the screenshots:\r<br />CBBE\r<br />TrueVisionENB\r<br />Skyrim2KTextures\r<br />\r<br />I did not make any of these mods so all credit goes to the makers of them.\r<br />\r<br />If you would like to use this mod in a pack or change it and then make it public, simply PM me and ask for my permission.\r<br />\r<br />-Incompatibility&#39;s:\r<br />Any mod that changes Lydia in any way.\r<br />If you find a mod that doesn&#39;t work with this comment or PM me and I will add it to this list.\r<br />\r<br />-Instructions:\r<br />\r<br />Unrar the .rar and then follow the read me.\r<br />\r<br />Contents of .rar\r<br />LydiaMageModV1\r<br />LydiaMageModV1ReadMe\r<br />\r<br />If you would like to use this mod in a pack or change it and then make it public,\r<br />simply PM me and ask for my permission.\r<br />\r<br />This IS my first mod so an endorse would be nice...\r<br />\r<br />-Field\r<br />",
