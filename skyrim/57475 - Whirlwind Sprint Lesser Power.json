  "summary": "Makes Whirlwind Sprint a Lesser Power",
  "descriptionHtml": "Title says it all. Just adds whirlwind sprint as a lesser power.\r<br />\r<br />Adds a spell that calls whirlwind sprint&#39;s animation on the caster. Spell must be added with console commands.\r<br />help &#34;whirlwind sprint lp&#34; 4\r<br />\r<br />For whatever reason, Whirlwind Sprint is not set up like you&#39;d expect. I wanted to have NPC&#39;s use the shout, but couldn&#39;t seem to get it to work. I noticed several other people on forums trying to accomplish the same thing, so I decided to post my solution. About as simple of a script as you can get, but man did it take awhile to figure out that&#39;s all you had to do. This calls ShoutSprintMediumStart, I didn&#39;t feel like making separate powers for Short,Long, and Longest.\r<br />\r<br />This is the first mod I&#39;ve uploaded, apologies if its not packaged correctly.\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to use in any way.",
