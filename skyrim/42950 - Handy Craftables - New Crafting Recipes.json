  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r\nThis is a nifty little mod that adds a few new crafting recipes and options into the game that should\\'ve been there from the start. It adds bolt, pickaxe, practice arrow, and many other things to the forge for crafting.\r\n\r\nAs well as this, it also gives you the ability to temper pickaxes, giving them damage boosts. For those who wish to smash someone\\'s skull in with a pickaxe. Not to mention two new ways of making steel ingots with coal and charcoal. You also have two ways of crafting bolts. You can either craft them from scratch using a few more materials, or you can take your already existing arrows and morph them with a few less materials than normally required to make new ammunition for your crossbow.\r\nI tried to always make it balanced, making crafting powerful items have high material costs. I have also worked in bolt crafting to work like the arrow crafting that Dawnguard, where you require the skill and level in order to make the bolts.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this will be an on and off project for me, meaning that it will not be on my list of high priorities for the moment. That being said, if you have any ideas of what I should add to this mod, I don\\'t mind suggestions in the comments. Obviously I will not add anything stupid like \\\"god sword crafting\\\" but I don\\'t mind any sensible ideas that seem out of place not to be able to craft.\r\n\t\r\n\tInformation and Requirements:\r\n\r\nThis mod requires:\r\n - The latest version of Skyrim for PC\r\n - The Dawnguard DLC\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod is compatible with:\r\n - Frostfall - Hypothermia Camping Survival\r\n - Athyraâ€™s Comprehensive Enhancements (ACE)\r\n - SkyRe (From what I am aware of)\r\n - Most mods on the nexus\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod is not compatible with:\r\n - Any mod that does the same thing as this.\r\n - Any mod that adds craftable bolts.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds these new crafting recipes into the game.
