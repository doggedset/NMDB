  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod. I used the appearance of Nords. Removed the smithing bonus adds it to one handed weapons. Removed all Nord abilities. Added 100% poison and disease resistance. Added 30% magic and damage resistance. May add 100% magic and damage resistance in the future to represent Immortality...but well...you know how some people are.\r<br />The Armor is called Thunderbird it normally comes in black by ken1945.\r<br />The Golden Armor is a retex by Pablo11\r<br />The Hair is by um....I don&#39;t remember...sorry.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you like it. I take no credit at all. So many Master modders are involved I couldn&#39;t name them all. Please feel free to enhance change or recreate in any way you wish and forgive me for not giving credit to more people or the right people.\r<br />\r<br />Contains Race only armor and hair not included.",
