  "summary": "This mod includes a new perk that is added to the One Handed tree aimed towards the &#39;fencer&#39; or &#39;duelist&#39; type of characters who have a one-handed weapon equipped in their right hand and nothing (or a torch) in their left.",
  "descriptionHtml": "========================================================\r<br />Updates/changes (in order from most recent to oldest):\r<br />========================================================\r<br />-Added two new optional Spellsword Editions of the mod, allowing spells to be used as well.\r<br />-Fixed the issue with the optional version causing the game to CTD at the start menu.\r<br />-Slight editing to the conclusion section in the description to elaborate more clearly\r<br /> the results of the changes.\r<br />-Fixed a mathematical error in the description concerning block values with a weapon.\r<br /> The new values for with and without the Duelist perk are now accurate.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />========================================================\r<br />What it does:\r<br />========================================================\r<br />This mod includes a new perk that is added to the One Handed tree aimed towards the &#39;fencer&#39; or &#39;duelist&#39; type of character. When you have a one-handed weapon equipped in your right hand and nothing (or a torch) in your left, you gain the following bonuses:\r<br />\r<br />Duelist (1/2)   (25 One Handed skill level required):\r<br />Your block effectiveness is increased by 25%.\r<br />Your attack damage is increased by 15%.\r<br />\r<br />Duelist (2/2)   (50 One Handed skill level required):\r<br />Your block effectiveness is increased by 50%.\r<br />Your attack damage is increased by 30%.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />========================================================\r<br />Why make this mod?\r<br />========================================================\r<br />When I started playing vanilla the night it was released, I instantly went for a character using a one-handed weapon and having nothing in the off-hand, like a two-handed user but with less range and faster attacks. Unfortunately, this wasn&#39;t a viable option, as you were much better off grabbing a shield to accompany your weapon, or another weapon and going berserk on enemies. However, I wasn&#39;t fond of shields, and I disliked that you couldn&#39;t block when you had a weapon (or spell) equipped in your left hand. Sooner or later I got tired of trying to make it work and went on to make different characters. But the call to playing a duelist eventually came back, and when I didn&#39;t see any mods that improved this, I decided to make my own.\r<br />\r<br />With weapon-and-shield being one side of the spectrum (focused on defense), and dual wielding being the other side (focused on offense), I decided that this play style should go in the middle; decent at both, but best at neither. The goal was to make a fighting style that could stand on its own without taking the spotlight from the other two already established styles. Despite the bonuses possibly looking overpowered/under-powered, I did some calculations and I think that these were good values to go with. If you feel something should be increased/decreased/changed, let me know.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />========================================================\r<br />Statistics:\r<br />========================================================\r<br />Block formula (taken from UESP):\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />With a weapon:  Blocked Damage = (0.30 + (.02 * (1 + Skill/100)/100)) * (1 + 0.1 for each Shield Wall perk)\r<br />With a shield:  Blocked Damage = (0.45 + (0.27 * ((shield base armor rating * (1 + Skill/100))/100))) * (1 + 0.1 for each Shield Wall perk)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />With a block level of 100 and 5 ranks in Shield Wall, the percentage of damage reduction you get from blocking (85% is the cap):\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />With a weapon:  0.4506  (45% damage reduction)\r<br />With a shield (Daedric Shield (base armor rating 36)):  0.9666  (97% damage reduction, reduced to 85% due to cap)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Weapon block with a block level of 100 and 5 ranks in Shield Wall, and two ranks in Duelist perk (+50% block effectiveness):\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />0.4506 * 1.5 = 0.6759  (68% damage reduction)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />========================================================\r<br />Conclusion:\r<br />========================================================\r<br />While 68% is much higher than the original 48%, it is still 17% under the block cap. I feel this will retain the usefulness of shields while still making one-handed weapon fighting an attractive option, since while one-handed weapon blocking will be more effective, shields can easily reach the block cap (making them better at blocking than without a shield) and have perks that allow you to deflect arrows and reduce incoming magical damage. The damage increase of 15%/30% is there to keep up offensively with dual wielding, where with two perks in Dual Flurry, you get a 35% attack speed boost to your attacks, and with Dual Savagery, your power attack damage is increased by 50%, which results in your DPS improving significantly. While your attack speed with a single one-handed weapon will still be normal, your damage will be boosted, making those hits that you land more of a threat. This also makes up for the lack of enchantments you get for having a weapon/shield in your left hand.",
