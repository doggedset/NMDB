  "descriptionHtml": "As always, my Screenshots are worthless.  Please feel free to take your own screenshots and post them here. Thanks!!\r\n\r\nHere is my take on the Nordic Carved weapons set from the Dragonborn DLC. Basically the idea was to bring out the detail present in the original textures and actually utilize the texture size.  \r\n\r\nI am aware that not every weapon is exactly matching to the next, but this is because of how the textures themselves were in the first place.  It appears to me that multiple people must have worked on these textures, as not every vanilla texture was consistent with the rest of the set.  Notably, the long sword and the War Axe in particular will stand out when put next to the other weapons.   I will try to work on them more later on. \r\n\r\nTexture Size: 2048x2048\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nPresuming NMM isn\\'t able to automatically install the textures for whatever reason, simply extract the textures folder and copy it to your Skyrim Data directory, and overwrite as needed.
