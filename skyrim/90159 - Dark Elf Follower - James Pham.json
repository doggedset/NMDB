  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][color=#e69138][b]Edit 2: It seems something was really wrong with Four Shields Tavern, but I think it's fixed now in v1.02.\n<br />Edit 1: Hotfixed the folder structure of the mod. If you're one of the 3(lol) people who downloaded it and it doesn't work, please download again.[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />I saw [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/84lqcz/request_in_memory_of_my_friend_mod/]this[/url]﻿ mod request and decided to fulfil it.\n<br />\n<br />You can find James at the Four Shields Tavern in Dragonbridge. As requested, he wears Blades Armor and wields an Ebony warhammer, bow and arrows. His specific class in the CK is 'CombatWarrior2H\" which makes him best at Heavy Armor, Two-Handed, Block, Archery and One Handed. He does not have spells, but more Health and Stamina as well as some perks in Heavy Armor to be a better damage sponge. This follower levels with the player up to any level.\n<br />\n<br />When you first find him, he won't be wearing his helmet. Ask him to follow you and he'll equip it as soon as you get outside (this was done in case you want to see his face).\n<br />\n<br />He does use vanilla assets by default, so if you use texture mods or anything that affect the vanilla Dark Elf race, they should change him too.[/size]",
