  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"Veterans\\\" are pre-built characters, skilled and equipped in tune with the limitations of their experience. The entire game is unexplored, and adapted to your new level allowing you to try out advanced play-styles and quest-lines without the hours of involved preliminaries.\r\n\r\nGnarla - Female Orc Havoc Barbarian\r\nor Gnarls - Male Orc Havoc Barbarian\r\n\r\nGnarla is a level 30 Two-Handed berserking master of Illusion. In combat she wields her battleaxe with devastating prowess, cutting through enemies in fell swoops. When facing multiple opponents she sends them into a Frenzy to draw attention away while her skilled Blocking and Heavy Armor provide admirable protection even through extended battles. When things get too hairy, she\\'ll cast Muffle and Invisibility to Sneak out for a rethink, or buy a few more seconds of swing time with a healing Restoration spell.\r\n\r\nGnarla\\'s pampered upbringing resulted in her Lawful Evil alignment, and only a grudging respect of authority or for law & order. She understands you must keep the rabble in line, but rules only apply to those who don\\'t know better, and she knows better. When she sees equipment or resources she could put to better use than the current owner, she takes them, because she deserves them. Disrespect or stepping out of line by others than herself, however, is not to be tolerated. Those types will be taught a lesson their survivors will not forget.\r\n\r\nLevel 30 Orc with\r\n29 Unallocated Perk Points\r\n210 Magicka (+50 Highborn Power)\r\n170 Health\r\n210 Stamina\r\n\r\nGnarla\\'s Initial Skill Set:\r\n\tIllusion 100\r\n\tHeavy Armor, Two-Handed 75\r\n\tRestoration, Speech, Block 50\r\n\tEnchanting, Archery, Smithing, Conjuration, Light Armor, One-Handed, Sneak, Pickpocket, Alchemy, Lockpicking, Alteration, Destruction 15\r\n\r\n1*(99*100/2) + 2*(74*75/2) + 3*(49*50/2) + 12*(14*15/2)\r\n= 15,435 Experience\r\n\r\nGnarla Starts Knowing These Spells:\r\n\tMuffle, Frenzy, Rally, Invisibility, Pacify, Rout, Hysteria, Call to Arms, Harmony, Mayhem\r\n\tBound Sword, Bound Battleaxe, Bound Bow\r\n\tClose Wounds, Greater Ward, Heal Other, Repel Lesser Undead, Turn Undead\r\n\r\nGnarla Has Learned These Shouts:\r\n\tDisarm\t(Zun Haal Viik)\r\n\tSlow Time (Tiid Klo Ul)\r\n\t\r\nGnarla\\'s Heritage Provides These Additional Powers:\r\n\tImperial Luck (Find more gold)\r\n\tHighborn (+50 Magicka & Regen Daily)\r\n\t\r\nGnarla\\'s Starting Gear:\r\n\tRing of Recovery 00100e5c\r\n\tNecklace of Renewal 0010df5e\r\n\tOrcish Helmet of Major Restoration\t000cf814\r\n\tOrcish Armor of Major Illusion\t0010dedd\r\n\tOrcish Gauntlets of Eminent Sure Grip\t000cf7fa\r\n\tOrcish Boots of Brawn\t000cf7b0\r\n\t\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n2.0 Added equipment, powers, & shouts, and refined the stats.\r\n1.2 Overhauled stats. Added Gnarls the Male Havoc Barbarian\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhenever a character earns a rank in a skill they gain that much experience. So when a character has 0 in all skills they have zero experience, and when they have 100 in all skills, at around level 81, they have 89,100 experience. A level 30 character should have 15,560 total experience summed from their skills.\r\n\r\nTaken Veterans should look good with any texture or mesh mods you may use, if any.
