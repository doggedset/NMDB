  "descriptionHtml": "I decided to upscale the texture of the Imperial Sword, from 512x512 to 1024x1024. It looks great, not too blurry, since I sharpened it in GIMP. Also, this is my first retexture that I\\'ve uploaded to the Nexus, although I\\'ve been lurking and downloading for a good few months, maybe a year. \r\n\r\nTo install, just unpack the .rar and place the \\\"textures\\\" folder in your data folder. If you\\'ve already got a textures folder in your data folder, just tell it to replace it. ",
