  "descriptionHtml": "===Lisette=== A Hotter Version \r<br />\r<br />Updated 05/23/12 Calculated Level 40 and Auto Level options with new combat mechanics, skills and perks&#33; Brunette and Blonde options. \r<br />\r<br />Inventory: No clothes, SHE&#39;S NUDE&#33;&#33;&#33; I will let you decide what you want her to wear. \r<br />loose pocket items and an iron dagger. \r<br />Ranking: (csHumanBoss1H) Combat Assassin Level 70\r<br />Voice: Same as in-game \r<br />Body: *dimon99&#39;s UNP Dimonized Body Nude with *Navetsea&#39;s Skin, Muscle and Thin Landing Strip, *Glosstech No Shine. \r<br />Apachii Hair #6\r<br />\r<br />I have always felt like the original Lisette looked like Cyndi Lauper and since I cant stand her I dreamed this lady up. I found a few articles about batch files and created a simple bat file that is included within the mod folder. She is not NMM compatible, you will need to manually install the files. She was a real PITA to make a follower or specifically trying to get her to do what I wanted like using spells and perks. This mod was by request.\r<br />\r<br />Easy Install: Just install the BSA, ESP and BAT Files in your Skyrim Data Folder. \r<br />\r<br />***Using the Bat File is simple. place the &#34;Follower&#34; file in your Skyrim Data file and then in-game hit ~ for the console and simply click on Lisette&#39;s character so her number appears and then type in console &#34;bat follower&#34; (without quotation marks) and you are done. She will follow you all over and then return to The Winking Skeever when you dismiss her. If you take her camping and are using a companion mod that lets her relax she may even play music. She did for me.***\r<br />\r<br />If there is an (*) Asterisk by the named items above you will &#34;need&#34; these files to make her look like my mod of Lisette in the images I uploaded. Theoretically any body mod should work with it although I have not tried it.\r<br />\r<br />*One Important Note* To get the hands to match in Navetsea&#39;s mod you need to copy the meshes from the Dimonized UNP MAIN folder to your Data Meshes Folder then overwrite with Navetsea&#39;s file. If you think this is a pain in the ass, just use the Dimon mod without Navetsea&#39;s mod. If you want a better looking body, female nether region and like your ladies fit, Navetsea has an excellent mod and is recommended&#33; \r<br />\r<br />***Important: If you save a new game after installation of this mod and then load the new save game you should see the mod I have created. Starting with an old save may cause her to look off or dark faced. \r<br />\r<br />My take on Makeup on Female and Male NPC&#39;s not being &#34;Lore Friendly&#34;\r<br />\r<br />There are a lot of people playing this game that think the use of make-up is not lore friendly and so they are hesitant about using character mods like mine that use makeup or beautification mods. I would ask you to consider these following historical tidbits in relation to being lore friendly. Makeup is documented to have been used by the Ancient Egyptians over 10,000 years ago by paleontologists. Makeup was also documented to be in use by the Greeks, Romans and other ancient societies, including tribal body and face painting by Ancient Briton and Germanic tribes. To me it is completely plausible for makeup to be used in Skyrim given Bethesda supplied it and used it in the game on its own NPC&#39;s. Inescapably Skyrim&#39;s lore is tied to our history in some way shape or form, the latest &#34;trend&#34; of having NPC&#39;s look more natural is more likely a current trend in modern use of makeup and not a direct reflection on the lore of this game or any game that that bases its lore partially on human medieval and ancient history. It is inarguable that Skyrim spans the times from early man to the late 16th century with the various in-game elements it provides us. Note the use of mammoths and saber tooth cats and then fast forward to some of the more modern items in the game such as steel bear traps (which were recorded to be first in use in the late 16th century). It is perfectly fine and period to this game to have your characters kicking ass in black eyeliner, eye shadow and red lipstick. Don&#39;t let someone tell you it isn&#39;t lore friendly because it really is. Given the choices of races we have in Skyrim it may not only be lore friendly but very plausible on some characters depending on their status and rank within their society. In the end it is completely your choice on how you want your NPC&#39;s and PC&#39;s to look. I personally am not interested in having androgyny rule my game so I opted to creating and sharing my own female characters that cannot be mistaken for anything else. \r<br />\r<br />Thanks for reading,\r<br />\r<br />FalmerBane",
