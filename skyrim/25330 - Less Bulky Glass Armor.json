  "summary": "This is a modified vanilla model for the female glass armor to make it look less bulky.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\n<br />I never liked the body shape of the female vanilla glass armor.  I love the design but it looks too thick and bulky for a light flexible armor.  I've slightly modified the vanilla female glass armor meshes to fit my taste and my version of the CBBE v3 body modified with BodySlide.  You can use this mod with any body.\n<br />\n<br />I have made the large armor on the shoulders and upper arms slightly smaller and brought in the armor around the body, waist, and hips to fit the small end of the weight slider and brought out the chest and hips as well as the waist to fit the heavy end of the slider while maintaining a slimmer look throughout.\n<br />\n<br />This is a female-only modification.  Male armor will remain unchanged.  \n<br />\n<br />UPDATE:\n<br />I added a male version as an optional file.  I am not satisfied with the result because of some choices I made with the mesh but I will not be working with it further.  You are free to use it or modify it.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Installation: \n<br />Use NMM installer or drag the Meshes folder from the archive into your Skyrim&#92;Data folder and consent to folder merges/overwrites as necessary\n<br />\n<br />Requirements:\n<br />Skyrim or Skyrim SE\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Recommended: \n<br />a CBBE body is recommended but not required",
