  "modName": "Better Critical Hits",
  "summary": "Improves critical damage table for all standard skyrim weapons, making perks that grant a chance to critically hit worthwhile (Bladesman, Critical Shot, etc).",
  "descriptionHtml": "(NOTE: I have a better version that only modifies the perks instead, not the weapons. Located here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49848/? )\r<br />\r<br />I made this little mod for myself, but thought I&#39;d put it here too incase anyone wants it. I was tired of how useless perks like Bladesman and Critical shot are in the game (weapons have a base critical damage listing, it is not increased by weapon skill or improving the weapon via blacksmithing. I.e. a longbow has a critical damage listing of 3. So with a critical hit with 1 perk in critical shot, you will do 3 extra damage (or about 5 damage with 3 perks in critical shot).  \r<br />\r<br />A Daedric bow does 9 points of extra damage with 1 perk in critical shot (or about 14 damage with 3 perks in critical shot). This bonus damage is useless vs enemies that have hundreds of points of health and where weapon damage after skill level + blacksmithing, jumps into 100+ easily by level 30 or so. \r<br />\r<br />As you can imagine, it makes all the perks that grant a chance for critical hits a waste. I wanted to make the perks useful, without being too powerful.. It seems fairly good to me, not extremely powerful, but useful now and worth the perk points.\r<br />\r<br />What this mod does:\r<br />\r<br />- Raises the bonus critical hit damage for all bows in Skyrim by a multiple of 6 (i.e. longbow goes from doing 3 bonus damage, to 18 bonus damage. Daedric bow goes from 9 bonus damage, to 54 bonus damage).\r<br />\r<br />- Raises the bonus critical hit damage for all 1 handed swords & 2 handed swords by a multiple of 4.\r<br />\r<br />That&#39;s it. I also modded the new weapons from Dawnguard & Dragonborn DLC as well in separate files you can include as well if you like.\r<br />\r<br />Some important things to know:\r<br />\r<br />- This mod modified the critical damage values of weapons in Skyrim, Dawnguard & Dragonborn. It will NOT work with any mods that also modify these weapons stats.\r<br />- It will not work on new weapons added by other mods (though I believe it works fine with mods that only modify appearance / textures of the game&#39;s current weapons and not their stats)\r<br />- It works fine with mods that alter gameplay / damage without modifying weapon stats directly (mods like Duel Combat mod, Deadly Combat, etc).\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve tested a lot of the weapons myself and played several hours with it and it works fine for me. This is the first mod I ever tried to make, and it&#39;s very basic, but seems to work fine. Feel free to mess around with it in the creation kit if you think my changes are too big or small.",
