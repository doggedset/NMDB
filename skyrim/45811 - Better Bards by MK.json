All of the tavern dwelling bards in the main cities as well as several from the bards college can now be recruited, have a much wider array of skills and classes than before, and more importantly... they look better&#33; Custom hairs are now included in this standalone version. To get the most out of your companions pay attention to their class and skills. \r<br />\r<br />This mod changes the following NPC&#39;s.\r<br />\r<br />Pantea Ateia (Bards college in Solitude) - Priest\r<br />Illdi (Bards college in Solitude) - Priest\r<br />Aia Arria (Bards college in Solitude) - Necro\r<br />Karita (Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar) - Spellsword\r<br />Lauffyn (Candlehearth Hall in Windhelm) - Necro\r<br />Lisette (WInking Skeever in Solitude) - Spellsword\r<br />Delacourt (Dead Man&#39;s Drink in Falkreath) - Rogue\r<br />Mikael (Bannered Mare in Whiterun) - Priest\r<br />Ogmund (Silver-Blood Inn in Markarth) - Fighter\r<br />Ataf (Bards college in Solitude) - Spellsword\r<br />Sven (Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood) - Rogue\r<br />Lurbuk (Moorside Inn in Morthal) - Rogue[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][u]Recommended mods[/u][/b][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168//?/]ApachiiSkyHair by Apachii[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037/?/]UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18045//?/]My Home Is Your Home[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666//?/]Caliente Female Body Mod BBE[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812/?/]Better Females by Bella[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13641//?/]The Asteria by Mattcm919[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3100/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D3100&pUp=1/]Now follower bards sing everywhere[/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][u]Armor mods used in screenshots[/u][/b][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15156//?/]Succubus By Hentai -CBBE3 Gift By Nausicaa[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28887//?/]Vampire leather armor set by RavenDier[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13067/?/]Dark Lilith Sexy Armor for CBBE by Nikitaa and Hentai[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25852/?/]Lustmord Vampire Armor by AmethystDeceiver\r<br />[/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][u]My other mods[/u][/b][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/46972/?/]GMO - Guild Members Overhaul[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/46027/?/]MKs Muiri Follower[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/46030//?//]MKs Aela Redone[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62060/?/]Disgaea - Etna Follower[/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=red][b]- PLEASE NOTE -[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />With both [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18045//?/]My Home Is Your Home[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3100/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D3100&pUp=1/]Now follower bards sing everywhere[/url] installed you can leave your bards in your home and have them play requested songs for you. &#34;Now follower bards sing everywhere&#34; can be found under [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3100//?/]Female bard for your house by stsg[/url] in the files section.\r<br />\r<br />Sven and Lurbuk are not marriage material for lore related reasons so you cannot wed them. Each have a quest that raises your relationship with them and you must complete their vanilla quests in order to recruit them (or target them in the console and type &#34;setrelationshiprank player 4&#34; to speed things up). \r<br />\r<br />Lurbuk is NOT set to essential for quest related purposes but you can use UFO to set him to essential if you like. I have set Lurbuk to &#34;protected&#34; meaning that he cannot be killed by NPC&#39;s, monsters, or environmental damage but the player can still kill him so be careful with friendly fire&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I have removed Aia&#39;s hood but it will most likely require a new game to take effect.\r<br />\r<br />A few of the NPC&#39;s are included in &#34;side&#34; quests and should you need to access their normal dialogue just return them to their original homes and dismiss them, then speak to them again.\r<br />\r<br />Also... I have included a standalone Hroki (destruction mage) follower as a bonus. it somewhat breaks away from the storyline but I think this is a much more suitable career than sweeping up her parents tavern while dirty old men hit on her. =P\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]If you want your NPC&#39;s to appear as they do in the screenshots install these mods:[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666//?/]Caliente Female Body Mod BBE[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12273/?/]Caliente&#39;s Vanilla Outfits for CBBE[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812/?/]Better Females by Bella\r<br />[/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][heading]Technical[/heading][/center]\r<br />[u][b]Requirements[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />No requirements but UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul comes highly recommended.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Installation[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />I recommend using Nexus Mod manager for installation, easy peasy, no fuss. Feel free, however, to manually install by unzipping the downloaded file(s) to your data directory, merging the textures and meshes folders, then activate the .esp file(s) in your Skyrim launcher.\r<br />\r<br />Place the .esp file(s) at the bottom of your load order with the rest of your companion mods in the order shown below. If you do not use UFO just ignore it and keep everything else the same. \r<br />\r<br />-------------------------------\r<br />-------------------------------\r<br />MksHrokiFollowerSA.esp=1\r<br />UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul.esp=1\r<br />UFO - Dawnguard AddOn.esp=1\r<br />UFO - Heartfire AddOn.esp=1\r<br />UFO - Dragonborn AddOn - Unofficial.esp=1\r<br />MKsBetterBardsSA.esp=1\r<br />-------------------------------\r<br />-------------------------------\r<br />Bashed Patch, 0.esp=1\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Uninstallation[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Make a clean save without any followers then simply remove the files or deactivate the mod using NMM.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Known Issues[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />- When using the &#34;you could dress better&#34; command in Ultimate Follower Overhaul the NPC will reappear as just a naked (unarmored) body with no head. This is a bug I have seen in other companion mods and I am actively seeking a solution. There is an easy fix however, simply open the console and target the headless NPC then type &#34;resurrect&#34; and hit enter.\r<br />\r<br />- I have altered the NPC&#39;s base attributes some (raising health, magicka, and stamina but in order to get the changes it seems you must start a new game with the mod installed or at least have it installed the first time you enter the room with one of them. \r<br />\r<br />- Dark face textures appear on some NPC&#39;s from time to time depending on what mods you have installed and your load order. For some reason it seems centered around UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul. If you experience any issues try moving the bugged mod down in your load order so that it is below any UFO esp&#39;s. Problems should be few and far between.",
