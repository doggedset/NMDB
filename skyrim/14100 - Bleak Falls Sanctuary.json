Located just southwest of Riverwood, this structure is easily accessible for new and veteran players alike.\r\n\r\nThis mod introduces a new structure to the Bleak Falls barrow area, and also introduces a creative back-story which ties directly into the existing Skyrim history of the Ancient Nords, Dragon Priests, and dragons.\r\n\r\n\r\n===========\r\n[b]FEATURES:[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]* Custom Enchanting Table, designed by RealitySpectre (used with permission)\r\n* Custom book, documenting the historical background of The Sanctuary and the other ancient buildings at Bleak Falls\r\n* Abundant player storage (a total of 14 safe, non-respawning containers) for food, clothing, equipment, crafting supplies, and books\r\n* Alchemy workstation\r\n* Ancient Nord Catacombs located beneath the home\r\n* Unique stone bridge and staircase added to the cliffs near Bleak Falls\r\n* Beautiful views of Bleak Falls from a back patio and 2nd floor balcony[/i]\r\n===========\r\n\r\n===========\r\nWhat this mod [b]DOES NOT OFFER:[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]* Weapon racks or display cases \r\n* Mannequins for armor display\r\n* Smelter, forge, armor worktable, or weapon grinding stone[/i]\r\n\r\nI have no desire to have these items in this mod, nor will I add them.  First and foremost, I do not feel it would be lore-friendly to have weapons and armor storage and crafting in a spiritual sanctuary.  Secondly, weapon and armor crafting items are available a short distance away in Riverwood.\r\n===========\r\n\r\n===========\r\n[b]INSTALLATION:[/b]\r\nDownload with Nexus Mod Manager, or place the .esp file and meshes folder into your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n===========\r\n\r\n===========\r\n[b]UNINSTALL:[/b]\r\nRemove with Nexus Mod Manager, or remove the .esp files from your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n===========\r\n\r\n===========\r\n[b]BUGS:[/b]\r\n[i]* Minor graphics glitch on the banister of the balcony (due to overlapping structure), but in my opinion not bad enough to worry about (especially since I don’t anticipate many people will spend too much time out there).\r\n\r\n* I did NOT NavMesh the 2nd floor balcony.  This was intentional, to avoid any possible conflicts with the NavMesh on the patio below.\r\n\r\n* Slight possibility that one of the cliffs added to the exterior stone staircase may not be visible the first time the area is viewed upon loading the game.  I am fairly certain I have corrected this problem, but going in and out of any load door (for example, entering then exiting The Sanctuary) should correct the issue if it does happen to occur in your game.\r\n \r\n* NavMesh is done correctly (I’ve tested it), but followers may occasionally still get hung up on the spiral staircase into the catacombs.\r\n\r\n* Follows will enter the catacombs (I’ve tested it).  That said, it can be quite difficult to get them in (you’ll find out why), but it certainly is not impossible.[/i]\r\n===========\r\n\r\n==========\r\n[b]CREDITS:[/b]\r\n\r\nThank you to [b][u]RealitySpectre[/u][/b] for permission to use his custom Enchanting Table.
