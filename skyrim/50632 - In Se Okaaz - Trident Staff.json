  "descriptionHtml": "This simple little mod adds a Trident staff with a projectile ice and absorb health enchantment. Due to popular request a melee version has been added. They both share the custom model and texture. They can be found on a dead body just North of Solitude on a small island near the Light House. Special thanks to Gray-Wolf Jack for showing me how to set up the thrusting melee animation. Please do not redistribute.\r<br />\r<br />The textures on the trident were made using source material from CGTextures.com. These images may not be redistributed by default, please visit www.cgtextures.com for more information.",
