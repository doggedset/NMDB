  "descriptionHtml": "MJB is a custom body preset done by me.  I\\'ve decided to share it with the rest of you too.  Don\\'t get me wrong, I love CBBE/UNP/UNPB too, but there\\'s nothing better than something you made custom to your liking.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/37307-1-1371479826.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[b]VERSIONS[/b]\r\n\r\nIncluded are two(2) basic versions:\r\n\r\n- MJB (Default) Normal\r\n- MJBK (K) Pregnant\r\n\r\nAfter that, there are variations of the two aforementioned bodies:\r\n\r\n1) File #1 uses breast and butt bones and thus, requires compatible skeletons and animations.  I RECOMMEND XPMS Skeletons : http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800 and Dragonfly Butt Bounce Animations : http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34713\r\n\r\n2) File #2 does NOT require any skeletons or animations, but you don\\'t get any \\\"bounce\\\".  Shame on you for using this version!\r\n\r\n[b]CHANGE LOG[/b]\r\n\r\n- (6/24/2013) Version 1.1.500 Adds optional \\\"Never Nude\\\" or SFW versions of the MJB base body.  No MJBK yet, sorry.  File \\\"A\\\" requires compatible skeletons while File \\\"B\\\" does not.\r\n\r\n-  Version 1.0.500: Initial Release\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]INSTALLATION[/b]\r\n\r\n6/29/2013:  A couple of people have sent me PM\\'s about not being able to get the body to work/install properly.  From what I can tell, those individuals may have tried to use Nexus Mod Manager.  If so, then that\\'s my fault.  I should have mentioned, you SHOULD INSTALL MANUALLY.  MJB is not currently setup for NMM, so if you use it, the files will likely not install to the right directories.  HERE ARE THE PROPER STEPS TO FOLLOW:\r\n\r\n1) Download your \\\"MAIN FILE\\\" of choice.\r\n2) Open the archive with 7zip file manager.\r\n3) Within either of the \\\"MAIN FILES\\\" you will find folders for the Default body and the Pregnant body.  Open whichever you like and keep going until you see a folder called \\\"meshes\\\"\r\n4) Copy the \\\"meshes\\\" folder to your Skyrim/Data directory and click on yes to merge when prompted.\r\n\r\nThat is the standard way of installing any mod manually just for future reference guys.  On a side note, I think someone also had texture issues.  MJB does not come with textures.  I left out textures so that anyone could use their own body texture of choice.  MAKE SURE IT\\'S A CBBE TEXTURE SO THAT IT LOOKS PROPER ON THE BODY.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.  Let me know if there are any more issues you guys may need help with.  \r\n\r\n[b]BONUS[/b]\r\n\r\nI\\'ve also included MJB versions of most of Killer Keo\\'s Skimpy armor and clothing to get you started.  Note that the armor and clothing does not require skeletons or animations, only the bodies from File #1 do.  Also, there are no pregnant versions of the armor and clothing yet.  Pregnant versions are coming in a future update for clothing, but armors probably won\\'t make much sense. lol\r\n\r\n[b]MORE INFO[/b]\r\n\r\n- File #1 which requires skeletons is known internally as \\\"BAD MJB\\\" and it includes a 3D pubic hair mesh.  File #2 does not.\r\n\r\n- I have not included any textures with MJB so you are free to use whatever CBBE textures you want with my MJB body.\r\n\r\n[b]USELESS INFO[/b]\r\n\r\nIn-case anyone is wondering, let\\'s talk about file version naming for future update reference.  The initial release is version (1.0.500) of MJB.  The first two digits indicate version 1.0 to the public.  The \\\".500\\\" at the end indicates that this is actually version 5 of MJB internally as it is known to me.  This is just mainly for my reference so I can keep any future updates straight.\r\n\r\n[b]CREDITS[/b]\r\n\r\n- Thanks to Killer Keo for original armor and clothing : http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3654\r\n- Thanks to ChronoTrigger77 for Bodyslide Plus Plus : http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32731/?\r\n\r\n[b]PERMISSIONS[/b]\r\n\r\nYou are certainly free to create armor/clothing for MJB if you so desire.  Just be sure to give a link to the original MJB mod on this page.  Thanks!",
