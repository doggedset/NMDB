  "descriptionHtml": "After many unsuccessful attempts at trying to make a nice looking Altmer, I\\'ve finally managed to make one I\\'m satisfied with.\r\n\r\nHer name is Al\\'viye.  No one can pronounce it, and every mispronunciation is another blow to her fragile psyche. [feel free to rename her if you REALLY want to.]\r\n\r\nI\\'m sharing this because making an attractive (by which I don\\'t mean super model, or even... attractive... just something I enjoy seeing for one reason or another) Altmer is difficult and there are few around the nexus.  I also made her very Un-Altmer-like, as part of her character, she\\'s meant to be a bit of an oddball outcast in her home land, and as such very resentful of Altmer society (and high elves in general).  Also just generally a little touched in the head, possibly due to the horrible facial disfigurement (she honestly thinks she\\'s hiding it with that ridiculous hair, I know...) suffered as a child (possibly) at the hands (claws) of a particularly bloodthirsty group of swearing mudcrabs. Flesh was torn, feelings were hurt, and her estrangement from a dignified Altmer society was complete.  Or so the story goes.\r\n\r\nOther mods used in my pictures are as follows:\r\n- [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356]Xenius Character Enhancement[/url] \r\n- [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1329]Beauty Faces for females[/url] \r\n- [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=195]Human eyes for Elves[/url]\r\n\r\nOther Considerations:\r\nThe default Altmer height bothered me a little ways into the game so I scaled her down to 0.88 \\\"player.setscale 0.88\\\" (and bumped up her body weight by a few notches to compensate), if you want the optional pre-Helgen Imp/SC choice file, I suggest you make those changes when renaming her \\\"showracemenu\\\".  Besides looking better in my opinion, the stunted growth kinda plays into the \\\"runt\\\" image I was going for.",
