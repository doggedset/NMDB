  "descriptionHtml": "The City of Rome - A Historical Mod by M7, 2014.\r<br />\r<br />Attention History Students&#33; Now you can visit a section of Ancient Rome from within Skyrim.\r<br />First you must go to Winterhold and find the Imperial Roman History Center (Rome Center on Map), and enter the stone tower. From there find the History Book and &#34;read it.&#34; You will be magically transported to Ancient Rome, where you can engage fighting in the Arena, visit a Temple, visit Trajan&#39;s Baths, or Sleep in Caesar&#39;s Palace.  The Arena can be visited as a spectator or contestant -- enter the Arena Bloodworks on Ground Level, find a Calm spell book, and enter the Arena.  There you may pull one of 3 switches to release your opponents; to end the fight cast a Calm spell on them and throw the switches. You will notice that the opponents will not die (where is the sport in that?), as this is for entertainment purposes only. [You may also find the Circus Maximus for a short visit in another &#34;History Book.&#34; Note: The Actual Circus Maximus is a race track with horses (WIP?).]  Now with Circus Maximus in the Colosseum Insula&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />\r<br />DRAGONBORN & DAWNGUARD DLC\r<br />SKYRIM, UPDATES.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0, M7 December 17, 2014.\r<br />\r<br />Happy Holidays&#33;\r<br />\r<br />;;\r<br />\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=357809690\r<br />\r<br />;;\r<br />\r<br />Update: 12-18-2014: \r<br />\r<br />- I added the Circus Maximus race track with horses, accessible inside the Colosseum Insula. The Naval Battle part of the Colosseum is accessed via a book on the Bar counter.\r<br />- I added &#34;Nero Effect&#34; in the City. (Look for a lever near the Palace entrance). ",
