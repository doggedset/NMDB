  "descriptionHtml": "Shines-Like-Silver has heard about your daring escape from Helgen...and she thinks it\\'s the Sexiest. Thing. Ever.\r\n\r\nI made this mod for myself because I was frustrated from Shahvee\\'s apparent fickleness in handing in her quest (Seriously I tried every single thing suggested by the internet. That girl plays hard to get!).  Shines-Like-Silver has no required quest, and will be interested in you as soon as you show her the appropriate Amulet of Mara. After marriage she behaves like Shahvee would, and will open a store.\r\n\r\nTo make it a little bit \\\"lore friendly\\\", I made her Stands-In-Shadow\\'s granddaughter.  She\\'s visiting her granddad and can be found at the Argonian Assembly or at the Windhelm docks.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod ever, so it\\'s fairly simple. Once I have more experience with the Creation Kit, I hope to tweak Shines a little bit more.\r\n\r\nIf anyone downloads this: It worked fine for me, but feedback on problems would be appreciated. Thanks!\r\n",
