  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a data file for Caliente\\'s BodySlide for people who want to a bit more thigh on their cbbe model.\r\n\r\nInstall by extracting the files into your BodySlide directory.\r\n\r\nWarning: this will overwrite Caliente\\'s default in SliderSets.\r\n\r\nNo pics - The file is 15k and easy to install, so I\\'m not going to the trouble.\r\nI set the Adult only flag but the slider can be made to work for the never-nude version of cbbe by copy-pasting 3 lines in SliderSets/CalienteSets.xml\r\n\r\nJust for anyone who doesn\\'t know: BodySlide is a tool Caliente made to tweak cbbe meshes.  This file is not a mesh and is not directly usable in the game.\r\n\r\nYou may be aware that Caliente is releasing armors for use with BodySlide. Those armors will not have any accommodation for this slider, and adding the slider to them is probably a lot of work.\r\nIf I decide to do that work, I\\'ll post something, but I doubt I\\'ll even look at it before Caliente is done with her armor project. \r\n[color=red][size=5]\r\nFAQ:\r\n[/size][/color]\r\n1. This only changes thighs.\r\n\r\n2. [s]There is a known issue at 100% - namely that a vertex split occurs on the right thigh - I\\'ll upload a \\'redone\\' version - It will look a little different because it\\'s a full do-over.[/s]\r\n\r\n3. Sliders will probably exceed the BodySlide\\'s default window size. \r\nThe bodyslide window is hardcoded GUI instead of using a layout manager, so just resize the window.\r\n\r\n4. Want to add this slider to another body?\r\nOpen sliderSets/CalienteSets.xml with your favorite text editor (like gvim)\r\nCopy the 3 line definition for the \\'Thighs\\' slider from the first SliderSet \\\"CalienteBody\\\"\r\nPaste those 3 lines into the SliderSet of your choice ex: CalienteNeverNude, ... etc\r\nSave the file, cross your fingers and restart bodyslide\r\n\r\n5. You did #4, but now you have duplicated sliders. (you use a text editor that makes backups ?)\r\nYou have duplicates in your SliderSets folder.\r\nGo to the SliderSets directory and delete or move or change the extension of any .xml files other than one you want BodySlide to use. \r\n\r\nSorry",
