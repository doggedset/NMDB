  "summary": "Reduces all non-weapon/armor items to zero weight.",
  "descriptionHtml": "If you&#39;re like me, you do your very best to pick and choose what you loot in order to avoid getting overweight.  If you&#39;ve ever found yourself aiming carefully at an apple yet accidentally picking up the useless, heavy plate it sits on instead, this is the mod for you.\r<br />\r<br />All potions, scrolls, books, food, drink, ingredients, ingots, jewelry, and miscellaneous junk are now weightless.  Only quest items, weapons, and armor still have their original weight with the exception of the woodsman&#39;s axe, riekling spears, pickaxe, and Ancient Nordic Pickaxe.\r<br />\r<br />This mod requires all-DLCs and should be compatible with all other mods.  To ensure that items remain weightless, place this mod at the end of your load order.",
