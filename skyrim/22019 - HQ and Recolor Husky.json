I love the Dawnguard companion Husky but I found them a little, derpy looking. Cute but not as epic as they could be.\r\n\r\nNow I\\'m far from a pro retexturer but I try my best.\r\nIve deepened the color of the armor and increased ridge detail.\r\nIve also replaced the tongue on the husky with a more realistic (actually a real tongue) texture and lightened the fur while adding more quality to it.\r\n\r\nIts far from perfect, but this time yesterday I had no idea what I was doing and now I\\'m pulling detail from a 512x512 res texture, so, gimme a week :)\r\n\r\nEnjoy and endorse if you like.\r\n\r\n[center]---Requires Dawnguard---[/center]",
