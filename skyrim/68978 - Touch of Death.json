( D&amp;D terms )\n<br />Basically it would be a weapon of Meridia, designed to slay undead. ( TES terms )\n<br />\n<br />It is based on http://auriv1.deviantart.com/art/Concept-Touch-of-Death-424935029\n<br />\n<br />The weapon can be crafted and is listed under the MISC section. This is due to it having silver properties instead of iron or steel.",
