If the player is attacked when that substitution is ready, they will be replaced with an inanimate object, and teleported behind the attacker.

If the player is attacked when that substitution is ready, they will be replaced with an inanimate object, and teleported behind the attacker. Time is slowed for a moment to allow the player to get a few hits off. \r<br />\r<br />Take extreme caution when fighting dragons with this spell. If the dragon is flying far overhead and damages you while you have a substitution ready, there is a small chance you will be teleported onto its back in mid-flight, but usually you will be teleported to the ground underneath it. If the dragon is landed anywhere (including on rooftops) you will usually teleport onto its back. If your character is squishy I would advize against using this during a dragon fight; however if you are a close range bad@&#036;&#036; this makes for very fun encounters. \r<br />\r<br />I have a number of future updates planned; hopefully I&#39;ll have the time to add them soon&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Future updates planned: \r<br />-Add in more objects for substitutions. \r<br />-Increase substitution persistence (from maybe 5 seconds to 10) \r<br />-Add cooldown for the power.(probably around 5 - 15 seconds) \r<br />-Remove courier quest and add mini-dungeon to obtain spell tome. \r<br />-Slow time before teleport, check distance, and if greater than a certain value, retaliate with a &#39;kunai&#39; before teleporting. \r<br />-Additional spells for teleporting away from or around enemies on hit, for ranged characters. \r<br />-Add Shadowclone jutsu spell, starting with three clones (all one hit kills) \r<br />-Add quest to improve shadowclone jutsu spell with additional clones \r<br />\r<br />Currently this mod has no dependencies and plays well with the hundred plus mods I have installed. \r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Masashi Kishimoto and everyone who contributes to the show and manga &#34;Naruto&#34; which (obviously) inspired this mod&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />For original subscribers who have the quest stuck open and unable to complete: \r<br />\r<br />Originally posted by [b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=317923311&tscn=1413603640#c613937306728146252]FailureMaster[/url][/b]:\r<br />Originally posted by [b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=317923311&tscn=1413603640#c613937306723706931]FromCanada[/url][/b]:\r<br />Same here I would like to get rid of it too\r<br />I found the quest ID by typing &#34;help subjut&#34; (&#34;subjut&#34; being part of the quest name in the console) then completed the quest with &#34;Completequest ID&#34;. It&#39;s at least a temporary fix for now.",
