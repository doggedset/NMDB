  "modName": "TFCG - Body Part Weapons",
  "summary": "A Gore mod where once you kill an animal, you collect one of its parts. Either one of its legs, arms, head, or tail to use as a weapon, or a chest as a shield.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Please read the description carefully, because it says where to get the weapons, and what weapons are available at the moment, and ones that will be available in the future. Thanks you for reading, Wolf.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you love the mod, please feel free to donate at our [url=http://theflamingceletov.wixsite.com/tfcgaming]Website[/url], or on [url=https://www.patreon.com/TFCGaming]patreon[/url]. It will help a lot and make me want to move the mods out a lot faster, and it will also show your support.\r<br />\r<br />In this mod, when you kill any creature or NPC (Male and Female Argonians, Imperials, and Khajiits right now. We are working on other playable race characters. Then I&#39;ll start working on monsters), You can grab either of their body parts. Legs, Arms, Head, Tail, and so on (including chest). They will be weapons, and a chest shield.\r<br />\r<br />A few friends wanted it due to the conversation about beating someone with their limbs in a game. Morrowind: Bloodmoon - &#34;Severed Nord Leg&#34; was what was brought up. So I decided to make a mod for them, and everyone with the same gory mind. It also makes the game a bit more fun and interesting.\r<br />\r<br />You will find these items in dead bodies, and things you kill (dragons will have dragon parts, Wolfs will have wolf parts, people will have people parts).\r<br />\r<br />Before you comment, make sure to post only stuff of this mod, no memes or comments that arnt about this mod. Thanks. \r<br />\r<br />If you like the mod, feel free to sign up to our group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TheFlamingCeletovGaming]TFCG[/url]\r<br />Also, feel free to like our Facebook page: [url=https://www.facebook.com/TFCGaming-118033984964479/]The Flaming Celetov Gaming[/url]\r<br />Feel free to also visit out web site: [url=http://theflamingceletov.wix.com/tfcgaming]TFCGaming[/url]",
