  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=red][size=48]Improved Riverwood[/size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n[center]This as my first mod I tried to stay small, however I think It evolved into something quite nice. The highlight of this mod in my opinion is much improved interior lighting, no more are interior dull and shadow-less, now they are full of color and shadows. Bethesda it seemed did take much care for lighting as I\\'ve found it was done quite poorly, I.E. Having a light source randomly put the center of room without a candle or some kind fire of the sort, quite bad if you ask me. However I didn\\'t want to stop there, I also aimed to improve the NPC\\'s clothing to add a bit more flavor, Faendal for example is now wearing a hunting armor configuration. Him being a ranger class I only saw it fitting for him to have the proper garb. I have also improved the forests around Riverwood. I added many more trees, shrubs, and plants and varied the size of existing foliage to give it more verity and flavor, the difference is astounding.[/center]\r\n\r\n[center][color=Green][size=48]Full Feature List with Upcoming Features[/size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n-Improved Interior Lighting\r\n-Improved Exterior Lighting\r\n-Improved the density of Forests\r\n-Improved NPC clothing\r\n-Added an Archery range\r\n-Improved the entrance a tad (all 3)\r\n-Still kept the feel of Riverwood\r\n- Many more coming in V1.5 and at user request.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][color=Blue][size=48]Bug List[/size][/color][/center]\r\n-Tree sticking through a rock, roadside, south of Riverwood.\r\n-Floating trees by river\r\n\r\nIf know of anymore please do not hesitate to bring them forward.\r\n\r\n[center][color=Purple][size=48]Planned Features[/size][/color][/center]\r\n-Enchantment Table to Sleeping Giant Inn[X]\r\n-Spell, alchemy, and enchantment merchant.
