  "descriptionHtml": "Just a small resource of a blue and white canine retexture, like Aylied, and a brown and black retexture. They work as wolves and huskies.\r<br />\r<br />I made them for a project I&#39;m working on that probably won&#39;t be finished for a while, so I figured people might get some use out of them. Right now they don&#39;t replace the in game textures of wolves and huskies, they are separate from them so if you want them as replacers you&#39;ll just have to rename the textures to what you want. Both textures work on either the vanilla wolf or husky mesh from dawnguard. \r<br />\r<br />The AyliedÂ texture does have a blue mouth, tongue and teeth, but it&#39;s varying shades of blue and greenish blue. Overall, I think they would look nice in unnatural places. \r<br />\r<br />Use for whatever you&#39;d like&#33; That&#39;s why I uploaded them. Just credit me.",
