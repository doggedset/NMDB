I think UBR is awesome so i am making this a mesg only details. ************\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]UPDATE: UBR NOT REQUIRED\r<br />   [/size]\r<br />   [size=3]Download the Main File v1.1 or v1.0 (v1.1 is better and has a pointy stick added) \r<br />   Download the Optional UBR NOT REQUIRED file MANUALLY (Do not use NEXUS MOD MANAGER FOR THIS ONE)\r<br />   Extract the contents\r<br />   INSTRUCTIONS are in the folder in a README file\r<br />   Follow the Steps EXACTLY and you wont have a bad time\r<br />   \r<br />   EST TIME to get this working 5 to 10 mins at most\r<br />   \r<br />What does this do? \r<br />   This file will replace the mods .esp with a new one. This new .esp makes it so that while wearing the Jera Scout    Armor your Khajiit will have UBR properties such as digitigrade like feet with claws and awesome hand claws. When    you take off the armor, Your Khajiit will go back to Vanilla - plantigrade feet and no awesome hand claws.\r<br />   \r<br />   This also means that All Khajiit in Skyrim are Vanilla, if you give this Armor to a Khajiit follower, they will have UBR as    well\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Issues\r<br />   if you download Khajiit retextures/skin textures, these textures may conflict with this armor only, should not affect    anything else. i have not tested this, just a fair warning.\r<br />   [/size]\r<br />   UPDATE PLEASE READ\r<br />      Received a mesg saying that UBR not required file caused a crash on their game. After several mesgs and troubleshooting attempts, i believe that the issue is a mod conflict and not a problem with this particular mod. I am asking if anyone downloads this alternative solution to the mod that they mesg me or comment in the comment section if this alternate download method worked for them. \r<br />\r<br />please comment if this solution did or did not work for you. i want to provide good mods so please let me know. i will do what i can to make this mod work for you.\r<br />\r<br />Solution to above problem was a conflict with skeleton \r<br />The person downloaded xp 32 extended skeleton and the armor worked after installation.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />recommended mods\r<br />-ubr link above \r<br />-Real Bows http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64440/?\r<br />-Race Menu http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?\r<br />-fnis peca2 http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71055/?\r<br />-tk hitstop http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23681/?\r<br />-tk recoil http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32769/?\r<br />-ABT- for archers http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11941/?\r<br />-Sxp http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40899/?\r<br />-equipping overhaul http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49784/?\r<br />-casm-auto save http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67188/?\r<br />-archery gameplay overhaul http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69033/?\r<br />-blades samurai armour and kimonos http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24704/?\r<br />\r<br />and many more but these are friendly to low end graphics cards like mine ",
