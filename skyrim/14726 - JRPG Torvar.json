  "descriptionHtml": "===========\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nRemember that guy in animes, the main character\\'s best friend who always hangs with him? WELL NOW THAT GUY CAN BE TORVAR. In spirit, at least.\r\n\r\nLore? NOT IN THIS HOUSEHOLD. Unless you can somehow explain how Torvar has such remarkably smooth and girly girl skin. After all, this is more of a joke than anything else. And thus our journey into lore-breaking continues!\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I \\\"accidentally\\\" made Torvar\\'s forehead shockingly large. Seriously, you could land a plane on that bad boy.\r\n\r\n============\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n1) ApachiiSkyHair for the hair:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\n\r\nNote: You don\\'t really need this next one. I just use it because it makes males look\r\nbetter. I used the Younger Faces & Geonox version in my screenshots.\r\n\r\n2) Better males - Beautiful nudes and faces - New hairstyles:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2488\r\n\r\n============\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nPut both the esp and the bsa in your \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data folder. Hopefully, it should work fine.\r\nIf not, tell me and I\\'ll try and fix it myself. This was a really quick job, so I expect\r\nan issue or two.\r\n\r\n=======\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Apachii for the hairs, foretrenty for the npc editor, and Chris57 for the face textures. I don\\'t care what you do with this mod, but please respect the other guys. ",
