  "descriptionHtml": "Are you tired of Dremora and Thalmor using iron weapons? Are you tired of those mods that add those overpowered weapons to them that&#39;ll get you killed in an instant or when you do kill them you have an overpowered weapon for the rest of the fucking game? Well, this mod is for you. This mod adds under powered versions to the game that they use. They are still powerful, but not so powerful that you can storm through the game at level 2 after encountering them. This mod is heavily inspired by the Dremora field weapons in oblivion.Â ",
