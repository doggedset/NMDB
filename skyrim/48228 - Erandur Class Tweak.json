  "summary": "This is a minor tweak to Erandur to fix the odd magicka cap problem and make his skills fit his background more appropriately.",
  "descriptionHtml": "After kissing a lovely certain Daedric artifact goodbye and saving Erandur's hide, I discovered that he was utterly useless to me as a follower -- low-capped combat skills and no magicka with which to actually use any of his own vanilla spells (can forget about giving him new ones via UFO).\r\n\r\nSo, I tried to fix him.\r\n\r\nI duplicated his vanilla class (\"Priest\") in the Creation Kit and tweaked it, so these changes should not affect any other NPC Priest in the game. \r\n\r\n- He will now level with magicka as his primary stat.\r\n- He will still gain health, but it may not be as much.\r\n- He will now how have stunted but reasonable stamina.\r\n\r\nHis still weights were also tweaked, but more for roleplaying flavor in order to match his back-story:\r\n\r\n- Completely removed smithing.\r\n- Lowered speech\r\n- Increase to alchemy\r\n- Conjuration now on par with restoration\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease report any problems you find - this is not fully battle-tested, but I'm using it on my own game and have not found any problems with it.\r\n",
