  "descriptionHtml": "Just sharing a small tweak that finally fixed my mannequin problems.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]To explain[/b][/size]. Skyrim&#39;s mannequins are basically NPCs (with their own AI Package), which are frozen in place by a script which fires off each time you load the cells they&#39;re in. If the script fails to fire off immediately the moment the cell loads, they&#39;ll have 1-2 seconds to wander off (like NPCs tend to do) before being frozen in place. This causes the vanilla wandering mannequin bug.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]What USLEEP does[/b][/size] is tweak the script (&#34;mannequinactivatorscript.pex&#34;) that freezes the mannequins to be faster and more streamlined (I think? Did not really look at the source code.) and more importantly, to make it reset the mannequins&#39; pose and position after it&#39;s done freezing them so that \r<br />they&#39;ll be where they should be and in the pose they should be in. \r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re running a vanilla game, this will be all that you&#39;ll need. However, if your game is heavily modded (with script heavy mods) and you&#39;re suffering from an even slight Payrus Script lag or alternately, you use player home mods like &#34;Deus Mons&#34; or &#34;Halls of Dovahndor&#34;, with 15+ mannequins in one cell, USLEEP&#39;s script just won&#39;t be able to keep up and you&#39;re likely to end up with floating/wandering mannequins anyway. \r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]What my mod does [/b][size=2]is tweak the mannequin&#39;s NPC AI package to keep them from wandering around in the first place. In the vanilla game, the mannequin&#39;s AI Package &#34;MannequinStay[/size][/size]&#34; is set to the &#34;travel&#34; template, which is why without the script &#34;mannequinactivatorscript.pex&#34;, the mannequins \r<br />tend to... travel. As of the latest version, USLEEP does not touch this. What my tweak does is change the AI Package so that it now has a template that tells the mannequins to &#34;hold position&#34;. Now they&#39;ll no longer wander around in their cells while waiting for &#34;mannequinactivatorscript.pex&#34; to turn them into statues and reset their postion, they&#39;ll simply stand in place, maybe turn their head this way and that way, but no more. This vastly reduces the possibility for error. \r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]TLDR[/b][/size] If all this just flies right over your head, just download and install. If it doesn&#39;t solve your mannequin problems, then it&#39;s perfectly safe to uninstall without negatively affecting your game in anyway. Peace.",
