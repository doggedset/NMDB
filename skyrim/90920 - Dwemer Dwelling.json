  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff0000][size=5]First of all, this mod is produced by a newbie modder, so I expect there will be some problem with the design or navmesh.\n<br />\n<br />Concept[/size][/color][size=5] [color=#ff0000]of this mod[/color][/size]\n<br />[size=2]I want a house with lots of cell room to house custom followers since keeping several custom followers in the same cell usually exhausts the VRAM. Thus, this house provides 10 seperate cell rooms for your needs. These rooms each have four beds so you could use mod to make them rest there.\n<br />\n<br />﻿Meanwhile, the entrance is just a portal door, minimizing the influence to original gameplay. Also, it contains no custom contents and should be machine-friendly.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[color=#ff0000]So-called Lore[/color]   \n<br />Some Snow elves and their Dwemers friend built a place to hide from the Nords. The place remains unexplored until recently. Snow elves used their portal technology to build an entrance at a remote place while the Dwemers use their technology to build the underground shelter.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000]Where can I find it?\n<br />[/color][size=2]It is located East of Skyborn Altar and South-Southwest of Shrine of Mehrunes Dagon. The portal overlooks the Skyborn Altars.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]Requirement\n<br />﻿[/size][/color][size=2]I used all of [/size]skyrim[size=2] DLC as master. That includes Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]What is not finished[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]The second large cell. I can't figure out what to fill in empty space. Hopefully I get some idea to fill it up.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][color=#ff0000][size=5]Install / Uninstall\n<br />[/size][/color]Drop the esp into data under Skyrim folder. Remove it when you want to uninstall.",
