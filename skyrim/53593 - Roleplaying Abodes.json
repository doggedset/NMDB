  "descriptionHtml": "AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE: From now on, I will be uploading &#39;Roleplaying Abode&#39; separately, meaning that is is significantly easier to find, simply by using the Recent Uploads tab.\r<br />\r<br />v1.1 - Proudspire Lair, a VAMPIRE LAIR released.\r<br />v1.0 - Player-Owned FORT and LUMBER MILL released.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Over a lengthy period of time, more and more homes will be added. Of course, having daily updates would be ridiculous, and so the &#39;un-requested&#39; housing will come in pairs, whereas the requested housing will come standalone. Feel free to suggest anything, though... I&#39;m not perfect, and no very adept yet, but happy to try anything.\r<br />\r<br />Note: In Fort Foehammer&#39;s Prison, it is likely you will encounter the &#39;missing map&#39; bug. It will do nothing, to what I have tested. Just run towards it, or &#39;in to it&#39;, and everything should appear as normal, though it may return.\r<br />\r<br />Also, with the Lumber Mill, you can not properly cut wood, and when exiting the building, you spawn under the exterior stairs. However, you will NOT be stuck.\r<br />",
