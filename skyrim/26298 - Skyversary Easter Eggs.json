  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][color=#B690DE][b]Skyversary Easter Eggs[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />The Sheogorath Bunny has laid Easter Eggs in shiny nests all over Skyrim, and it&#39;s up to you to find them&#33;  Once you have one of each of the seven colors of eggs, you can bake them into a deliciously magical Easter Egg Pie.\r<br />\r<br />There are well over 200 eggs added (40 of each color) but finding many of them will be a challenge.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#B690DE][b]Installation Instructions[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />If you&#39;re installing this by hand, then extract all files into Skyrim&#39;s Data folder (for me, that&#39;s under C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;Data). If you already have existing meshes and textures folders, click Yes or Yes to All when it prompts you whether you want to copy the files into them.\r<br />\r<br />Once you unpack the files, verify that the mod is activated by selecting &#34;Data Files&#34; from the loader screen, and ensuring that &#34;EasterEggs.esp&#34; is checked.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#B690DE][b]Credits[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />This mod and all of the new resources was created by Deandra at the UESP (username Merilia at TESNexus since the name Deandra was taken).  Feel free to use these resources in your own mods, but you must credit me for my work.",
