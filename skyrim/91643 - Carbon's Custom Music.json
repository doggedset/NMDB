  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=4]Overview[/size]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />This adds 12 custom music tracks to the game. 10 are inspired by traditional Celtic, Jewish, and Eastern European folk music, and the other two are custom arrangements of the Skyrim and Morrowind themes.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]The Songs and Where to Hear Them\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />Celtic Songs:\n<br />3 waltzes\n<br />2 jigs\n<br />1 hop-jig (jig in 9/8)\n<br />1 reel\n<br />\n<br />Klezmer (Jewish/Eastern European) Songs:\n<br />2 Shers\n<br />1 Paidushka (traditional Balkan song in 5/8)\n<br />\n<br />The Celtic songs can be heard in the wilderness and towns in mainland Skyrim and the Forgotten Vale, as they are \"Explore\" tracks. The arrangement of the Skyrim theme can also be heard here. On Solstheim, you will here the arrangement of the Morrowind theme instead, and only a few of the Celtic songs. The Klezmer (Jewish/Eastern European) songs can be heard in the taverns, and only there.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Updates/Changelog\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />Known bugs:\n<br /> - The Tavern tracks are not wanting to play for some reason. All outdoor ambient tracks are working just fine though.\n<br />\n<br />v1.1 \n<br /> - Fixed the Dragonborn sound file\n<br /> - Added all Tavern tracks to both playlists (they're still not playing though!)\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Installation\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size]Requirements: \n<br />You should have both the Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLCs to hear all of the tracks, though it [i]should[/i] work without them (no promises!).\n<br />\n<br />Manual:\n<br />\n<br />1. Download the .7zip file.\n<br />2. Unzip the .7zip file using 7-Zip or WinRAR. \n<br />3. Copy Data folder into the Skyrim directory located at C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim OR wherever you have Skyrim installed. There should be a folder called Data in there along with various launchers, .inis, and .txts. \n<br />4. Make sure the .esp is activated in the launch menu.\n<br />5. Done.\n<br />\n<br />NMM/Other Mod Manages\n<br />\n<br />1. Download the .7zip file.\n<br />2. Use your manager to install and activate the file.\n<br />3.
