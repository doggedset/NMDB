  "summary": "Replaces two female and hair hair models with horned models. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center] This mod replaces two of the female/male hair models with two horned hair models (those used for the dremora race). It makes the Dovahkiin look more mystical, more similar to the dragons with whom he shares his blood. It\\'s a nice touch for evil characters too.\r\n\r\nThe hairs are currently available for the human races of the game (Imperial, Nord, Redguard and Breton)\r\n\r\n[color={red}]{ Install: Extract the \\'Data\\' folder into Skyrim\\'s main directory. }[/color]\r\n\r\n[color={red}]{ Uninstall: Delete the \\'male\\' and \\'female\\' folders in Data\\\\meshes\\\\Actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\hair. }[/color] \r\n\r\n\r\n [/center]\r\n\r\n[b] Known bugs : [/b] The hair models were done for the dremora race, so they don\\'t completely fit the human models and may show some opacity issues. Sometimes they are not noticeable, so I\\'d advise testing the models on your character, and check if they look correct.\r\n\r\nI\\'ll be working on fixing this bug, and will release an update when it\\'s fixed.\r\n\r\n",
