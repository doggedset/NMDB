  "descriptionHtml": "I always was disappointed with mismatching of orcish weapons and armor, but I never tried to solve this problem until I wanted to play pure orc-warrior. All retextures I\\'ve found was too much green or completely gray. So, I have make this work with myself.\r\n\r\nWeapons was recolored to match armor. Leather on weapons & scabbards now is same or near color as leather on armor (no yellow tint). Shield was recolored too. Leather on shield back was recolored.\r\n\r\nArmor wasn\\'t changed, only weapons & shield.\r\nAll based on official HD texture pack (except sword scabbards).\r\n\r\nSorry for my English.\r\n\r\nknown issues:\r\n- Mace is little much more gray than other weapons. But it isn\\'t so noticeably. ",
