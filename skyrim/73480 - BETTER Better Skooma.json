  "summary": "A remake of my &#34;Better Skooma&#34; mod from the Steam Workshop, with a few small improvements",
  "descriptionHtml": "Some time ago, I made a little mod for the Steam Workshop called &#34;Better Skooma.&#34; Despite being thrown together in 10 mins and being barely functional, a couple people apparently liked it and it got almost 200 downloads and around 25 favs. Some guy asked me to put it on the Nexus, so I put it on the Nexus and added a couple things to it (now that I kinda know my way around the Creation Kit).\r<br />\r<br />This mod makes a couple changes to Skooma. It was always played up in the game as some terrible drug that would do terrible things to your body, and you were a terrible person if you used this terrible drug. Then you got a hold of some, and it wasn&#39;t terribly different from a normal stamina potion. Now, the effects are a bit more... dramatic.\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll be seeing things, man.\r<br />\r<br />(I know it just says &#34;slows time for 60 seconds&#34;, but trust me, it does way more than just that. I would recommend using it in a place with a lot of items lying around)\r<br />\r<br />You can also make your own Skooma at cooking pots, if you have the Physician perk, using nightshade and moon sugar. Skooma also now has a dramatically increased value of 2000 gold, so you can cook a lot of Skooma, then become a drug dealer and sell it for quite the profit. This new value is much lower than with the first version of Better Skooma found on the Workshop, but if I had left it at 140,000+, this mod would be even more game-breaking.\r<br />\r<br />Link to the barebones Workshop version:Â http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=227748584",
