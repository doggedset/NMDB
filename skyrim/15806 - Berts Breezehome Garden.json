  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o487/Stuart_Goddard/BBGLogoW.jpg[/img]\r\n[color=\\\"#48D1CC\\\"]\r\nBert\\'s Breezehome Garden\r\nA new garden called Dragonsreach grotto added to Whiterun that can be used as a stand-alone or connected to the original Breezehome, Bert\\'s Breezehome Cellar or Bert\\'s breezehome Remodel!\r\n\r\nPart of the Bert\\'s Breezehome Collection\r\n\r\nAlso available are...\r\n\r\nBert\\'s Breezehome Remodel\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8922\r\nA full remodel of Breezehome including interior, exterior and cellar(loadscreen) plus Dave the pet house dragon!\r\n\r\nAnd...\r\n\r\nBert\\'s Breezehome Cellar\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15801\r\nAdds an open (no loadscreen) cellar to Breezehome with a full set of crafting and smithing tools plus displays for armour, weapons, dragon masks and dragon claws!\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nA new garden called Dragnsreach Grotto underneath Whiterun that, as a standalone can be accessed through the grate in the main city wall behind the stables, or, with one of the connector\\'s, you can connect to either the original Breezehome, Bert\\'s Breezehome Cellar or Bert\\'s Breezehome Remodel!\r\nTo \\\"turn the garden on\\\" you need the bug jars you can collect throughout the game (finally a reason for them!), or, if your impatient like me, you can also get the cheat pack that turns it on straight away!\r\nThe garden should also be compatible with any Breezehome mod that doesn\\'t change under the stairs using the vanilla connector!\r\n\r\nThis one is for PurpleIsis, without whose inspiration, encouragement, support and help with assigning plants to bugs this mod would probably not exist!\r\nYou have my thanks, and i hope you like it!\r\nbert\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAlways read the included .txt files for full information!\r\n\r\nThe entrance in the original Breezehome is a trapdoor under the stairs, but, in either of my 2 you need to examine the rug in front of the tanning rack!\r\n\r\nWhen installing the connector\\'s and cheat pack,  NMM may say \\\"A differen version of blah, blah, blah has been detected blah, blah, blah...\\\", select NO to install normally or bits might be missing and you get desktop!!!\r\nAny addons to the mod should always be last in the mod load order in the DATA section of the Skyrim launcher!\r\n\r\nKnown bugs:\r\nWell there\\'s bees and butterfly\\'s and..... oops!\r\nThe bees and fireflys (torchbugs) get stuck in some kind of loop when you exit the garden during their set times and don\\'t disapear when they should, but its not a big problem, just collect them or ignore them, new ones get spawned anyway when you re-enter! (though if you enter, exit, enter, exit a few dozen times in one day you may end up with quite a swarm!!!) This will be looked at in future updates!\r\nOne of the Creep Cluster Roots is real tricky to get, but it is there if you look towards the bottom right corner of it!\r\n\r\nUnknown bugs:\r\nWell i don\\'t know! Their unknown!\r\nIf you find any please let me know!\r\n\r\nberticus0001 ;-)\r\n\r\n[/color]",
