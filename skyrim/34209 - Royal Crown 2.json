Both sit at different positions on characters head. \r\nGold and silver colors.\r\nNew mesh. (higher poly count and cleaner construction).\r\nLess shine/glare (than my first crown).\r\nLocated in Whiterun blacksmith (Warmaidens) on the second floor, above the counter.\r\nShould work for males and females.\r\n\r\nTo install, extract the Crown 2.0 data file into your Skyrim Data directory. \r\n\r\n\r\nI also used this crown mesh, in my new (NSFW) armor, but it has a better texture.\r\nCheck it here, if you\\'re interested\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35119\r\n",
