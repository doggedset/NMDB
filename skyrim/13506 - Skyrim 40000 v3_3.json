These abilities are meant to represent the bonuses granted by using a suit of powered combat armor. These abilities are granted through scripting, which means that the player can still enchant each piece at will.\r<br />\r<br />Mark VII Aquila Helmet - Full environmental systems provide independent oxygen and toxin filters.\r<br />Waterbreathing, and +40 Poison Resistance\r<br />\r<br />Mark VII Aquila Power Armor - Cybernetic and servo-assisted muscle amplification.

They SHOULD be perfectly safe for use, but *Please backup* your saves however, since the races are in testing, I would hate to affect your saves in any negative way. \r<br />The race are no longer larger than normal - Players can now control scale at will.\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\r<br />To become a Space Marine with an existing character: In console - \r<br />Type ShowRaceMenu and select is best or\r<br />Type player.setrace QSMSpaceMarine \r<br />and you shall become one of the Emperor&#39;s Chosen :) \r<br />Or a wretched slave to the Ruinous Powers using QSMChaosSpaceMarine \r<br />Space Wolves - QSMSpaceMarineSpaceWolf\r<br />Grey Knight - QSMSpaceMarineGreyKnight\r<br />(Changing races through the console is imperfect, and a low potential for errors exists - Always BACKUP your saves before using races with an existing game.)\r<br />@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\r<br />\r<br />For best results, delete mod in mod loader, and re-download if you experience any issues. (The mod is quite large, so the potential for an overwrite error is slightly greater than others.)\r<br />\r<br />% Known issues: Races do not have stored face-gen data (if you shift to one mid-game, you will retain your appearance if a human race.)\r<br />Modeling errors (armors disappear if dropped, gauntles do not display in inventory unless spun, Armor shows over text) Nothing that hampers 1st or 3rd person use, however it will be corrected.\r<br />\r<br />***********************************************************************************\r<br />I did not create these meshes or textures, I have only compiled and further edited them with permission from the creators. These files were created for New Vegas by akindain, and modified for Skyrim by zhaihouxi, both from the Nexus. A special thanks to akindain for not only creating these assets, but for generously releasing them as a modder&#39;s resource - This mod would not be possible without him&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Acey/Pirate has granted the use of his awesome Dwemer Autoblade, now modified and included (In the Weapon Pack, not here.)\r<br />\r<br />Tessai has granted the use of his custom Nighteye effect (and has other surprises in store)\r<br />\r<br />reschu0 has been working hard to create vastly improved versions of the Black Templars, Blood Angels, Blood Ravens, Dark Angels, Deathwatch, Salamanders, Soul Drinkers, Space Wolves, and Ultramarines plus the Iron Snakes texture, and more that will be featured soon.\r<br />\r<br />The Crusade and Corvus Pattern helms were created by cerberos008\r<br />\r<br />My sincere gratitude to Bethesda for Skyrim, the Creation Kit, and Elder Scrolls - To Games-Workshop for my nearly life-long addiction to Warhammer 40,000 and To Valve, for Steam and the Steam Workshop, which got me into this. This is a mod for a retail game, made from assets I do not own, as all mods are. This is a free, publicly available mod, and will never be sold or profited from. I intend no infringement upon the rights of the companies who&#39;s assets are used here, and will of course comply with their wishes.\r<br />***********************************************************************************\r<br />\r<br />Scripters rejoice&#33; - A new set of training videos has been made by richardbmiller2 that finally gives comprehensive details on Object-Oriented Papyrus scripting - this is paid-training level information, and I am learning a LOT :)\r<br />http://www.youtube.com/richardbmiller2\r<br />\r<br />Want to learn to model? A very helpful start-to-finish series is available from ghosu\r<br />(German and English versions available)\r<br />http://www.youtube.com/user/LeckerHamster\r<br />\r<br />v3.3 - Texture updates for 7 chapters, 2 new Chapters, improved normal maps, Chaos armor moved to separate expansion, new perk to mimic Cushioned so as not to affect the base perk.\r<br /> \r<br />v3.2 - Weapon Pack compatibility, Shiny Chaos armor fix, and integration of races with Quest DB09 &#34;To Kill an Empire&#34; (The chef will recognize marines as Imperials)\r<br />\r<br />This web site is completely unofficial and in no way endorsed by Games Workshop Limited and all associated marks, names, races, race insignia, characters, vehicles, locations, units, illustrations and images from the Warhammer 40,000 universe are either ®, TM and/or © Copyright Games Workshop Ltd 2000-2012, variably registered in the UK and other countries around the world.
