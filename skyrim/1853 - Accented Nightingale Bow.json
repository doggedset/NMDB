  "descriptionHtml": "*Update*\r\nI no longer have time to keep this mod updated\r\n\r\n\r\nThis bow was made to match my accented Nightingale set which can be found here http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1689\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nI\\'ve darkened the wood of the bow and given it a slight purple hue, as well as given the metal it\\'s self a purple hue.\r\nI\\'ve added in the matching medalion from the armor set to tie the two together even further.\r\n\r\nThe bow it\\'s self is HD, or as HD as one could really call it. I\\'ve doubled the size of the all the .dds files associated with it.\r\nHowever, I personally don\\'t consider this HD as the over all quality of the textures don\\'t improve a whole lot because of the sheer lack of quality they had to start with.. thank you Bethesda..\r\n\r\nOther Info:\r\nAs far as the screen shots are concerned the item preview from the equipment window is showing the metal far brighter than it is when it\\'s on the character. The bow I\\'ve used in the screen shot is also enchanted. I looked for an ID code for an un enchanted one but to no avail.\r\nbecause of the enchant the bow may look slightly different in your game.\r\nAnd as always, your personal game settings as well as the area you are in will effect the look of the item.\r\n\r\nAll my screen shots are taken at ultra quality  and at 1920X1200 resolution with a few minor .INI tweaks for shadows.\r\n\r\nPlanned:\r\nDarker metal version\r\nArrow + quiver to match\r\nComments and critiques are appreciated as are endorsements.\r\nEnjoy\r\n~Mirror",
