The Blade was used by Mehrunes Dagon&#39;s Daedric forces in the capture of the Imperial Battlespire. These extremely unique Blades were gathered up and destroyed after the Battlespire was recaptured by the Empire. All but one it seems. Though the Empire believes them all to be destroyed, it is rumored that one still remains in existence, somewhere in Tamriel, though none have ever seen it. The Blade lends it&#39;s wielder the ability to do great damage on an enemy and allows him to paralyze and put heavy wear on his enemy&#39;s armor. Quite the prize for any mighty warrior, if it does indeed exist.[/i] —Yagrum Bagarn, Tamrielic Lore[i]&#34;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO OBTAIN\r<br />You should look for an amulet, called &#39;Daedric Sanctuary Amulet&#39;, you&#39;ll find it on Arcane Enchanter table and should use it in the same room you&#39;ve found it.\r<br />\r<br />*hint. Amulet is in possesion of a skilled mage who have experience of dealing with otherworldly beings.\r<br />**If you&#39;re unable to find it, read the &#39;Spoiler - Amulet Location.txt&#39; in your &#39;Data&#92;NSCrescent&#92;Spoiler&#92;Location&#92;&#39;.\r<br />OR\r<br />open console and type\r<br />help&#34;Daedric Crescent&#34;4\r<br />player.additem itemID 1\r<br />\r<br />RECCOMENDED MOD\r<br />XP32 Maximum Skeleton Extended - This mod will allow you to possition Daedric Crescent on your back.\r<br />\r<br />OPTIONAL SHAPES\r<br />In your &#39;Data&#92;NSCrescent&#92;Shapes&#92;&#39; you&#39;ll find picture with two folders &#39;Battlespire&#39; and &#39;Morrowind&#39;.
