  "descriptionHtml": "[font=verdana][center][img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v464/sushisquid/ConvenientCrossbows.png[/img][/center]\r\n[size=3][color=green]100% Conflict Free![/color][/size]\r\n[size=3][color=crimson]Dawnguard required[/color][/size] - this does not add crossbows to the game. It just makes them more easily available.\r\n\r\nWhy weren\\'t crossbows added to normal forging, purchasing, and spawning in the game? I can\\'t think of a good reason, so let\\'s go ahead and do that.\r\n\r\nYou can now craft [color=silver]Crossbow[/color], [color=silver]Steel Bolt[/color], [color=silver]Dwarven Crossbow[/color], and [color=silver]Dwarven Bolt[/color] at any forge. The only requirement is having Steel Smithing or Dwarven Smithing perks.\r\n\r\nYou still must complete Ancient Technology to unlock exploding bolts and enhanced crossbows. This was done so that Ancient Technology still has rewards. Exploding Bolts can be crafted at any forge now like crossbows and normal bolts.\r\n\r\nCrossbow, Steel Bolt, Dwarven Crossbow, and Dwarven Bolt can now be found at shops all over Skyrim and on spawned NPCs. Exploding bolts and enhanced crossbows still are only available from crafting or purchasing from Sorine. Crossbows and bolts are a little bit rarer than bows and arrows, and they won\\'t appear on things like Forsworn or Falmer where it wouldn\\'t make sense. They\\'re mostly found with bandits, guards, and soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere you go. Very simple and does only what Dawnguard should have always done without adding anything else. Why make this when other similar mods exist? Well, this doesn\\'t add in new crossbow types and doesn\\'t negate the rewards of the Ancient Technology quest. It also doesn\\'t conflict with other mods [i]at all, ever[/i]. Nothing similar to this that\\'s available can claim that.[/font]",
