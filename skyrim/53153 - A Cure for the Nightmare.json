  "descriptionHtml": "   In the Midden, beneath the College of Winterhold, you meet a mage who seems to be working on some kind of new spell: a spell that could increase one&#39;s mental capabilities. Or, at least, that&#39;s what he pretends; but this strange encounter will soon make you wonder what&#39;s real and what&#39;s not...\r<br />\r<br />   A Cure for the Nightmare is a quest mod, but it&#39;s unlike any quest mod you&#39;ve ever seen. It will drag you into a creepy and immersive world of insanity where you don&#39;t always have a weapon or easy way out. And when you do have to fight, those combats aren&#39;t like classical Skyrim combats: they are realistic and deadly combats, so be careful. What&#39;s more, it takes some curiosity to really understand the story. You have to be attentive to every detail.\r<br />\r<br />   There isn&#39;t much else to say that won&#39;t spoil the mod, except that it&#39;s quite short compared to my other quest mods, and it&#39;s fully voice-acted. I can also tell you that you&#39;ll learn a new spell at the end. For the rest, I&#39;ll let the screenshots do the talking for me.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-- Bugs / conflicts / requirements --\r<br />\r<br /># No requirements\r<br />\r<br /># Should be compatible with any mod that doesn&#39;t affect the Midden 01\r<br />\r<br /># Known issues:\r<br />- Do not use &#34;god mode&#34; cheat, or you&#39;ll get stuck.\r<br />- After you finished the quest, you might get an NPC following you all the time. In that case, open the console, click on him and enter &#34;disable&#34;.\r<br />- If, in the first area, after climbing up the ladder, you get teleported back to the Midden, open the console and enter &#34;COC CNWorld1Cellar&#34;.\r<br />- If you don&#39;t know what to do, simply ask yourself: &#34;What would I do in this situation?&#34;\r<br />- You might find yourself unable to move at some point. In that case, just jump.\r<br />\r<br />-- Credits --\r<br />\r<br /># Developer: WitchRiser, AKA VitchRazor\r<br />\r<br />#Voice-actors\r<br />Bobshadow as Kyres Archer\r<br />WitchRiser\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-- Check out my other mods&#33; --\r<br />\r<br /># Cycle of the Silencer\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49713\r<br />\r<br /># The Warpers\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32873\r<br />\r<br /># Custom Family Home\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47621",
