  "descriptionHtml": "===This is a community project; Skyrim is too big for me to fix on my own. Do tell me of any relationships that should be added/changed when you have done something that would affect that NPC, such as a quest, marrying a family member, etc.===\r\n\r\n*Note: This mod (accidentally) requires Dawnguard and Hearthfire. This is a mistake on my end; this will be fixed on the next update. If you are experiencing CTDs after installing this mod, it is because you don\\'t have the DLC.*\r\n\r\n[[How to install:\r\n\r\nUnpack to Data folder.]]\r\n\r\n***This is perfectly save to use in existing saves***\r\n\r\n***Due to the 1.7 patch and the way it handles \\\"Start Game Enabled\\\" quests, you may need to install the mod, load your save, save, quit skyrim, and reload. It will now work if it didn\\'t before.***\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery 75 in-game hours a script will make various checks on relationships between the Player and certain NPCs, how far and/or in which way the Player has completed a quest.\r\n\r\nFor example, should you have helped Saadia in \\\"My Time of Need\\\", you would just be given a monetary reward. End of.\r\nNow, you will have bonded with Saadia. Saving her life? That earned you \\\"Lover\\\" status (Relationship rank 4). With Kematu, you spared him and brought him his quarry. For the sake of fairness to gay/female characters, he will also have \\\"Lover\\\" status with the player.\r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\nWhen you get out of helgen (Lets say, with Hadvar), you eventually are given \\\"friend\\\" status with Alvor. Now, you\\'ll get \\\"Ally status\\\" with the rest of Hadvar\\'s family. You DID save him, after all.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat this mod will also do, is add you to appropriate factions.\r\nSay that you married Carlotta Valentia (Through use of my \\\"Everyone is followable\\\" mod, or some other mod that adds NPCs to the marriable faction), you will now be able to adopt her daughter, Mila Valentia, and will be added to Carlotta\\'s home faction.\r\n\r\n***===***\r\nChangelog(In terms of hold):\r\n\r\nMorthal: Falion\r\n\r\nMarkarth: Brother Verulus\r\n\r\nWhiterun: Amren + Saffir, Danica, Fralia Greymane + Olfina Greymane, Saadia, Kematu, Andurs, Danica Pure-spring\r\n\r\nRiverwood: Sven + Hilde, Alvor + Family, Gerdur + Family\r\n\r\nFalkreath: Lod, Hafjorg\r\n\r\nRiften: TalenJei, Keerava\r\n\r\nSolitude: Greta, Angeline Morrard, Taarie\r\n\r\nWindhelm: Suvaris Atheron, Rolff Stone Fist, Quintus Navale\r\n\r\n***===***\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog(In terms of versions):\r\n\r\nV0.12 (Removed older versions.
