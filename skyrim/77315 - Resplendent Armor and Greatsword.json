Bear in mind, it's not as perfect as you might think. Clipping still happens, but much less than before.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />This is an elegant, noble armor mashup which may or may not be heavily inspired by Dark Souls and has HDT physics. It's my first proper mashup, which I made for myself and I'm still [s]terrible[/s] not great with 3D programs so it's far from professional work, but I figured someone out there might enjoy it anyway.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />• Can be worn by male and female.\n<br />\n<br />• Is upgradeable and enchantable.\n<br />\n<br />• Has no weight slider because I'm too lazy. Probably will never make one.\n<br />\n<br />• I don't recommend using it with any skeleton that edits body scales such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26800/?]XPMS[/url] or [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34438/?]Subtle Male Skeleton[/url]. Technically nothing bad happens but the armor is already modeled to be rather thin and those skeletons will slim your waist to scary proportions. TL;DR don't blame me if you look like a wasp.\n<br />To avoid misunderstanding: It is NOT incompatible with XPMS. The armor just will not have the intended shape on male characters. If this doesn't bother you, or if you play female character, don't mind it.\n<br />\n<br />• The sword uses battleaxe animations, but don't worry – it's still a sword and benefits from sword perks.\n<br />\n<br />• If you wish to put this armor on followers/npcs, I highly recommend installing [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77815/?]Hdt Invisibility Fix beta[/url] to solve the bug where they would frequently become invisible.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ea9999]For Perkus Maximus users who cannot use the patcher with this armor, a user made patch is available [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/81302?]here[/url] (not made or supported by me personally, as I don't use PerMa)[/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#b4a7d6][size=5]THANK YOU!\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/77315-0-1469628203.jpg[/img]\n<br />I'm overwhelmed by the tremendous positive response I've received for this mod. I never imagined it would become so popular.\n<br />You guys inspire me to make more stuff!\n<br />\n<br />I'd also like to clarify that the HDT physics are not my creation - the original skirt with its physics was made by [b]singlebelong[/b], I only edited it.\n<br />At the moment I cannot help you in making your own physics, but be assured that I am going to learn how to work with HDT myself, or die trying.\n<br />\n<br />---------------------------------[/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][center][/center][/size][/b][center][b][size=4][color=#f1c232]- HOW TO ACQUIRE -[/color]\n<br />[/size][/b]Go to your favourite forge and craft. It has stats equal to ebony gear and therefore requires ebony perk to make, because balance and stuff.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=2]The following items can be crafted at any forge[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />• Resplendent Armor, Boots, Gauntlets, Helmet and Greatsword - regular unenchanted versions\n<br />• Hallowed Armor, Boots, Gauntlets and Helmet - enchanted versions, for Dovahkiins who don't want to level enchanting\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][b]The following items can be crafted only at Skyforge (Whiterun, outside Jorrvaskr)[/b][/color]\n<br />• Red, white, purple and green color variants of Resplendent and Hallowed armor\n<br />• Tarnished Armor, Boots, Gauntlets, Helmet and Greatsword - dark, tattered version of the set, available in two colors\n<br />• Abyssal Armor, Boots, Gauntlets and Helmet - enchanted version of Tarnished\n<br />\n<br />If you don't like crafting, you can open console and type [i]help resplendent[/i] (or hallowed/tarnished/abyssal) followed by [i]player.additem xxxxxx 1[/i] where xxxxxx is the item's ID.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][center][color=#f1c232]- INSTALLATION -[/color][/center][/size][/b][center]Throw everything from the zip into your Data folder and activate the esp in the launcher. Also go download [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53996/?]HDT Physics Extension[/url] if you don't have it already.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][center][color=#f1c232]- UNINSTALLATION -[/color][/center][/size][/b][center]Delete all stuff that you previously placed in your Data folder.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][center][color=#f1c232]- KNOWN ISSUES -[/color][/center][/size][/b][center]• Some clipping, I'll probably reduce it further in a future update.\n<br />• Inventory models don't represent the real armor well, no plans to fix because I don't care how they look.\n<br />• Due to my laziness, using pieces individually will look bad (you will get holes in your legs etc) but I don't know why you wouldn't wear a full set anyway.\n<br />• The active effects tab will tell you Hallowed Helmet gives you only 20% shout cooldown but it's lying, it is 30%.\n<br />\n<br />If you find bugs or general weirdness not listed here, please let me know.\n<br />\n<br />Any suggestions/requests/ideas are welcome, I will not bite you. But there's no guarantee that I will implement your suggestions.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][color=#f1c232][size=4]- CREDITS -[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Thanks to the following modders for permitting me to use their models:\n<br />newermind43 for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8723/?]boots and gauntlets[/url]\n<br />JayMercer for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57160/?]helmet[/url]\n<br />singlebelong for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51401/?]skirt[/url] with glorious physics\n<br />Thanks to www.textures.com for being the best texture site ever.\n<br />And thanks to Bethesda for everything else I guess.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]- PERMISSIONS -[/size][/color]\n<br />You are free to make body type conversions or retextures of this mod.
