  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a one-handed weapon weapon, Yamato, to the Daedric category.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;After all, Daedric is the closest to what the Devil twins were like.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Requires the same materials as a Daedric sword. Have fun&#33;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;You can also craft a scabbard version of his sword because he would weild it sheathed as a weapon as well. Only requires additional \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Firewood.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Recommended mods:\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58973]Unlocked Grip\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[/url]\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Because sometimes you want to switch to two-hands. (Would still have one-handed damage values, but benefit from two-hand perks). Vergil would occasionally wield it, rarely, in two-hands, but that doesn&#39;t change the weapon itself of course.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Note: Elysees has a better mod that does all this but keeps the scabbard as a shield and animates putting your Yamato in to the scabbard which is pretty cool. It&#39;s not on the Nexus though. It doesn&#39;t have the option of having a Yamato in Scabbard as a weapon though.",
