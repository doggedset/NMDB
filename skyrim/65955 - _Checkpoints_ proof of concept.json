  "summary": "A small proof-of-concept mod for a Dark Souls-inspired checkpoint system.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a proof-of-concept for a mod I am working on called &#34;Checkpoints&#34;.  Instead of reloading a previous save when you die, you will instead be teleported back to the last checkpoint used.  Any items you collected will still remain in your inventory, but *all actors you&#39;ve killed will be reanimated*.\r<br />\r<br />In this proof-of-concept version of the mod, there are only two checkpoints, both of which are in Riverwood.  I plan to incrementally add more checkpoints to the world in the &#34;real&#34; version of this mod (atleast one for every dungeon and town).\r<br />\r<br />This mod *does not* stop you from quicksaving / quickloading any time you want...just in case I didn&#39;t put a checkpoint where you think one should have been ;-)\r<br />\r<br />The purpose behind this mod is to make the death system more like Dark Souls.  I&#39;m open to any feedback.",
