He was not, in fact, a man. He was actually a giant goat plagued with indigestion (these things happen when you eat nothing but virgins, burlap, and shovels).\r\n\r\nThus with his mighty bowels he would unleash a great fu\\'um from his backside. It is said that in days gone by he befriended the people of Whiterun by defeating a dragon that was threatening the city. Admittedly, it was a bit of an accident. He got into their cabbage fields and let loose a mighty fu\\'um which knocked the dragon flat.\r\n\r\nRecently was the great festival of Goatmas and all the proper incantations were done and now Govahkiin has returned to the plains outside Whiterun and many omens have foretold of this. Many omens. Such as Dragonreach being overrun with goats.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Things I Did[/u][/b]\r\n-Replaced the tree in Whiterun with the eponymous monument to govahkiin\r\n-Replaced Heimskr\\'s beloved Talos statue with a statue to Goatphala\r\n-Renamed Heimskr to Goatskr\r\n-Made Goatskr an actual goat\r\n-Replaced dragon head in Dragonsreach with goat head\r\n-Filled Dragonsreach dining hall with goats and added a giant goat head presiding over the Ceremonies\r\n-Added Govahkiin to outside Whiterun",
