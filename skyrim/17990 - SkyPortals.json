  "descriptionHtml": "[size=7][center][color=yellow]SkyPortals[/color][/center][/size]\r<br />[size=3][center][color=cyan]Though it&#39;s plain and unpolished, it will add some randomness to your game.[/color][/center][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Inspired by Oblivion&#39;s &#34;The Ayleid Steps&#34; mod by Ervvyn (and many, many thanks to him for allowing me to use any of the text from TAS if I should choose to use it), this mod adds Altars throughout Skyrim.  You will be teleported randomly to one of 103 locations or to one of 22 &#34;addresses&#34;, assuming you have the Soulgems to spend...\r<br />\r<br />Addresses? Some altars are uniquely identified by the combination of Soulgems used to teleport to them. Four filled Soulgems are used to activate a teleporter completely. Which type of Soulgem you use and the order in which you use it may match an &#34;address&#34;. If it does, that&#39;s where you will teleport.\r<br />\r<br />Any combination of Petty and Lesser Soulgems will create a portal to the outskirts of a city or settlement.\r<br />And if you paid attention, using the same combination will teleport you to the same location from any altar.\r<br />Some of the altar placements are quite near bad guys, just so you know.\r<br />Altars are all over Skyrim - in caves, forts, camps, water, crypts, houses, etc.\r<br />\r<br />This mod just adds some randomness to your play.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Warning&#33;&#33;[/color]  I did not pay close attention to where I placed the altars in relation to vanilla quests.  Clearing a location may result in either breaking a quest or completing one before you have received it.  Always make a save before using a portal just in case.  Should that happen, please post a comment here or on the BSG Skyrim Mods forum and I&#39;ll see about relocating the altar.\r<br />\r<br />Requires Skyrim 1.8.151, earlier versions not supported.\r<br />\r<br />FAQ:\r<br />[color=orange]Q.[/color] Will this conflict with XYZ mod?\r<br />[color=orange]A.[/color] If XYZ mod alters the landscape in an exterior cell or changes the layout of an interior cell where I&#39;ve placed an altar, it will probably break that location.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]Q.[/color] Is this compatible with Open Cities?\r<br />[color=orange]A.[/color] I think it should be, though I do not have OC in my load order.  I did not place any altars in any exterior worldspace other than Tamriel.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]Q.[/color]Oh great... another fast travel mod?\r<br />[color=orange]A.[/color] This is not a true fast travel mod. With the exception of a relative few locations, a teleport destination is randomly selected at the time the teleporter is activated. There are no map markers for the altar locations.  However, you can always fast travel to the place they are located instead of the altar directly.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]Q.[/color] Why Soulgems?\r<br />[color=orange]A.[/color] Because.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]Q.[/color] How do I figure out the address of a particular location?\r<br />[color=orange]A.[/color] At this time, there is no rhyme or reason to the destination combination of gems used. Pay attention to which Soulgems and in which order you use them. Outside of the 22 already configured, there aren&#39;t any others.  Yet.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]Q.[/color] When will you update the mod?\r<br />[color=orange]A.[/color] I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;ve started a major re-write (including quests).  This is a proof of concept mod that I figured some people might enjoy an early release.",
