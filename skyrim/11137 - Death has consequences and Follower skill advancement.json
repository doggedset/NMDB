  "modName": "Death has consequences and Follower skill advancement",
  "summary": "2 mods jammed together, both are optional.\r\nRequires Script Dragon.\r\nMod 1: Each time you die, when you reload your game, penalties are applied to your character. \r\nMod 2: Your followers start off with half the skills than you have and level up just like you.\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "OVERVIEW:\r\nThis mod is really two independent mods tied together for technical reasons.  Both mods can be configured on and off.\r\n\r\nDeath has consequences:\r\nThe purpose of this mod is to make dying much worse than the short wait to reload a save file.  \r\nWhen enabled every death of your character is saved, and whenever you load a savegame with that character, penalties are applied according to the total number of deaths that character has received.  \r\n\r\nFollower skill advancement:\r\nWith this mod enabled, followers gain levels, stats, and skill points similar to how you do. Whenever you very first take a character as a follower, that characters stats are updated to be 1/2 your level.  Periodically the follower gains a couple skill points, additionally each time you gain a skill, the follower will gain the same amount of skill points + 10%.  This should allow them to catch up to your level.  A level is then calculated based on their total skill points, and their health, magicka, and stamina are updated.  \r\nThe script uses the initial stats of the character to determine stat and skill point distribution, however the follower will slowly develop greater emphasis on skills that they use.  So if you want them to use a two handed weapon and light armor, have them use those during combat and they will slowly develop.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\r\nThis mod manipulates 2 keys in your inventory in order to store information about your character.  The Helgen Keep key and the Embershard mine key.  Dropping or removing either of these keys can have undesired effects.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have the helgen keep key you can add it to your inventory using the command:\r\nplayer.additem 000b5178 1\r\n\r\nI\\'d appreciate the endorsement if you are actively using this mod.\r\n\r\nDETAILS:\r\nFor follower skill advancement, there are 2 configurable options.  1 to enable/disable that portion of the mod.  The second option allows you to reduce the followers experience each time they bleed out.\r\n\r\nFor death has consequences, there are 7 configurable options, they can be as benign or serious as you desire.  The default value is 0 health, 0 magicka, 0 stamina, 0 skills, 3% of your gold, and 50 gold.\r\n\r\nPermanently lose stat points - Every death permanently reduces your health/stamina/magicka by this amount.\r\n\r\nUnlevel skills - Every death reduces the level of this many random skills.  Skills will never be reduced below 1.  The skill reduced is random but weighted towards the higher skills.  The mod never reduces your level or perks, so you could end up with much lower skills than your level would indicate. This also means that you can level above the default level cap.  \r\n\r\nPercentage of gold - Every death takes away a percentage of gold.  This percentage is calculated before the fixed gold cost taken.\r\n\r\nFixed amount of gold - Every death takes away this amount of gold.\r\n\r\nxp reduction - Reduce the amount of experience you recieve each time your skill goes up.\r\n\r\nI set up a spreadsheet where you can manipulate try out different values.  I think it\\'s publicly shared, so don\\'t break it or it will be ruined for everyone:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnLuQRS9i8ENdDhyQk5xUk04ZE1qNHItV0VuQm9xNEE\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\ninstall using NMM or extract archive into your Data directory preserving the directory structure.\r\n\r\nmodify the death_has_consequences.ini located under data\\\\asi\\\\ to configure your experience.\r\nor rename one of the example ini files to death_has_consequences.ini\r\n\r\nThis mod requires Script Dragon.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8221\r\nor\r\nhttp://alexander.sannybuilder.com/?altname=skyrim_script_dragon\r\n\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION:\r\nDelete the files from the asi directory. Unfortunately your reduced stats are permanently lost with no way to recover them. Revert to an old save file, or manually adjust them upward using a console command.  To fix your current followers stats, open the console, target them, then type setlevel 1.  The skyrim engine will ignore your input and update the follower to whatever it thinks the followers stats should be.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:\r\nThe data for all of your characters is stored in a file in your root skyrim directory called death_has_consequences.dat.  Deleting this file will erase all details about the number of deaths.  The quantity of helgen keep keys above 1 is the identifier for your character.  If the number of keys changes, deaths from other characters could get applied.  The quantity of Embergleam mine keys represents the number of deaths that have been applied to that character.  Removing these keys from your inventory will cause your deaths to be reapplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERSION HISTORY:\r\nversion 0.99\r\nreduced default follower health by 50 to keep it more in line with skyrim\\'s values.\r\nAdded support for followers losing xp when they bleed out.  This value is configurable.\r\n\r\nversion 0.98:\r\nFixed followers advancing skills WAY too fast.\r\nImproved messaging for followers, telling you their level.\r\nFollowers levels are now updated.  Due to an issue with Skyrim, it will not update their level if they are only 1 level off of their desired level in either direction, but their stats are updated appropriately.\r\nImproved initial skill distribution for followers.\r\nFollowers now advance in skills appropriate to what they use.  One handed, two handed, block, archery, light armor, and heavy armor all specifically advance based on their equipment usage.\r\nFollowers using spells now advance in conjuration, destruction, illusion, alteration, and restoration equally.  Too much effort to detect the specific spell they use, maybe I\\'ll fix this later.\r\nSneak and lockpicking advance if the follower is sneaking.\r\n\r\nversion 0.95:\r\nadded beta support for follower skill advancement. \r\n\r\nversion 0.94:\r\nadded experience reduction option\r\nAdded logarithmic scaling options\r\nUpdated display for skill reductions\r\nNow displays the cumulative level loss from any skill point reductions.  Does not reduce your level.\r\nFor example: if it says 0.6, that means regaining those skills would raise your level by 60% of 1 level.\r\n\r\nversion 0.93:\r\nfixed a bug where multiple characters got assigned the same id\r\n\r\nversion 0.92:\r\nnow supports reducing magicka and stamina.  \r\nreduced stats are now listed up to 4 at a time",
