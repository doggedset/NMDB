  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Loading Screen Texts \r<br />Version: 1\r<br />Date: 21 August 2012\r<br />Category: Misc\r<br />Author: Malachi Delacot\r<br />\r<br />===========\r<br />\r<br />Tired of the same old boring loading screen texts you have to read ?  \r<br />Well, if you are, this mod is for you &#33;\r<br />This super groovy awesome mod changes the text in almost every loading \r<br />screen... over 250.  Some are funny, some are amusing, some are really \r<br />lame, some are suggestive, and some may annoy you.   But now, for the \r<br />first time in Skyrim, you can read them all...when and if they appear in \r<br />your game.  I did a similar mod for Oblivion, and one night at work when \r<br />really bored, I figured I&#39;d do one for Skyrim.  So after 20 minutes in the \r<br />making, I came up with this mod. Nah, just kidding, it took longer than \r<br />that. And since so many people upload WIPs, I figure I can make this \r<br />one also....I mean, after all, I may make changes.....\r<br />\r<br />Details:\r<br />Just a change from the old vanilla loadscreen texts to something that may \r<br />( or may not ) be more entertaining to read.\r<br />Zip file comes complete, for a limited time, of one ( 1 ) esp file and one \r<br />( 1 ) &#34;read me&#34; file you can print out and make a paper airplane, light it\r<br />on fire, throw out the window, hopefully scaring somebody passing by.\r<br />\r<br />  Screenies were not done for Dawnguard since I do not have it\r<br />\r<br />Requires:\r<br />Computer\r<br />Skyrim\r<br />Sense of humor\r<br />\r<br />Install:\r<br />1. Unzip file to desired location  ( or directly into SkyrimData folder, \r<br />     in which case you can skip #2 and go directly to #3 ).\r<br />2. Copy or move the .esp file to (install folder)SkyrimData\r<br />3. Start &#34;Skyrim Launcher&#34;, click &#39;Data Files&#39;, place a checkmark beside \r<br />     the .esp file. \r<br />    Or, if using &#34;Nexus Mod Manager&#34;, put a check beside mod to activate it. \r<br />\r<br />Uninstall:\r<br />1. Start Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file.\r<br />2. Delete the .esp file from Skyrim Data\r<br />\r<br />Incompatibility:\r<br />None known to me. \r<br />But hey, if you find one, don&#39;t tell anybody or they&#39;ll want one, too.\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts:\r<br />Might conflict with &#34;Uncle Sheogorath&#34;, but don&#39;t know for sure since I\r<br />did not know that file existed until after uploading this and have not\r<br />checked it out.\r<br />\r<br />EDIT  \r<br />As of Oct 2016, there are many others you may be interested in; just\r<br />do a search for &#34;loading screens&#34;.  this has been a non paid for advert.\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues or Bugs:\r<br />Sometimes the text may change while the same picture is on screen.  \r<br />Hey, not my fault...it was that way with the vanilla loading screens.\r<br />Second line of text, if not a whole line, aligns to the right margin. Also,\r<br />not my fault...it&#39;s a game thing.\r<br />People that complain about how any mod isn&#39;t exactly like they want.  \r<br />This is the &#34;bug&#34; section, and well, it does bug me when I read some \r<br />comments about some mods....\r<br />\r<br />Contact:\r<br />You can find me in Nexus as &#34;malachi delacot&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Tools Used:\r<br />Readme Generator - LHammonds \r<br />Fraps - for making the screen shots work\r<br />iPhotoplus - my very limited on what it can do editing program \r<br />       that I&#39;ve had since 1996. ( Carah&#39;s been after me me to\r<br />       get a newer program )\r<br />WinRAR - zipping this file and the esp so I could upload it\r<br />\r<br />Credits / Thanks:\r<br />Bethesda for the great game and free Creation Kit.\r<br />Nexus for wasting the space for this mod.\r<br />A big thanks to Carah for beta testing...her laughter letting \r<br />me know she found humor in some of the shots.\r<br />You, for taking a look at this mod and maybe even trying it out.\r<br />\r<br />Serious paragraph: \r<br />I had wanted to do this mod also in Russian, Spanish, French, \r<br />and German, but due to the limitations of Google Translate, \r<br />too much was lost in translation and I was unable to.\r<br />At least the thought and desire was there.\r<br />\r<br />Licensing/Legal:\r<br />You can do whatever you want with this mod but don&#39;t complain to \r<br />me if it doesn&#39;t work, your PC blows up, or all your hair falls out.\r<br />Just give me credit if for some insane reason you find a use for it.\r<br /> ",
