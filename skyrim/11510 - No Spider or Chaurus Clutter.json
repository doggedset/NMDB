  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE:\r\nThere\\'s a new mod that does all of this and more, called [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26468/]Insects Begone - Modularly Dealing with Spiders and Chaurus[/url] by yroc1234\r\n\r\nOLD:\r\nI made this because there is a great spider replacement mod ([url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=28]No Spiders[/url] by Luthien Anarion) and a spider web removal mod ([url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=144]No Spider Webs[/url] by Justin Strawn), but even with both of those active you still have things such as egg sacs which I don\\'t enjoy so I figured I\\'d replace them too.\r\nThis mod only replaces the 3D models of things, so for example even though the eggs look like apples they are still eggs for Alchemy purposes and whatnot.\r\n\r\nHere\\'s a list of things that get replaced:\r\nSpider Eggs --> Apple\r\nChaurus Eggs --> Other Apple\r\nSpider Egg Sacs --> Barrel (Two barrel types for five different sac types)\r\nChaurus Egg Sacs --> Two different Burlap Sacks and a backpack\r\nSpider \\\"Dinner\\\" objects --> Hanging piece of rope\r\nFalmer Wallpod --> Ruins Wall Sconce\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\nSometimes this leads to odd things such as barrels sticking out of the wall, or halfway in the floor, etc. I\\'d rather have that than spider egg sacs everywhere.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve never made any mods before for any Bethesda games, and this isn\\'t even really a mod just a rudimentary file replacement, but it gets the job done.\r\n\r\nIf you run into anything real crazy that this causes let me know.\r\nI\\'m not responsible if this explodes your computer or savegame or whatever, but I don\\'t think it should break anything.",
