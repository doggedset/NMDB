And does not just plain skip the 1 foreigner line, that would not have kept sense in the conversation nor the quest triggers working: instead it changes some of players written lines to Galmar and alters the old dialogue tree so that &#34;foreigner&#34; will not appear, quest triggers work, there is  a tiny talk using old voice dialogue and new player lines where the player wants to fight for his/her homeland, Galmar appears suspicious of the players committment/motivation, and gives the quest (normal vanilla one) that`s given to such suspicious candidates. \r<br />\r<br />Exact changes made are to:\r<br />DIAL CW00BGalmarSkyrimIsHome\r<br />DIAL CW00BGalmarBlockingTopic\r<br />DIAL CW00BGalmarOnlyNords\r<br />INFO &#34;hmmm, Helgen, eh, Ulfric told us...etc...&#34;\r<br />GRUP group:topic (0001AEB6) children\r<br />\r<br />Updates:only updated this description page for mor more informations so far",
