  "descriptionHtml": "This simple mod just adds a door to return to Misty Grove, a plane of Oblivion ruled by Sanguine. The door is located in the Inner Sanctum of the Temple of Dibella in Markarth. I always felt that the Cult of Dibella had some things in common with Sanguine. When in Misty Grove, you can go back to Tamriel via a trapdoor in the ground. \r<br />\r<br />I would like to expand Misty Grove and add a player house and questline that explores the secret connection between the Temple of Dibella and Sanguine. However, I do not yet possess the time or the modding skills to do so. Hopefully someone out there will take my mod and expand on it. \r<br />\r<br />I recommend completing the Sam Guevenne quest and finding the Sybil of Dibella before using this door.",
