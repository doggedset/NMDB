Now you begin completely from scratch! The two spells you normally start with are now hidden somewhere in Helgen Keep, and if you can\\'t find them I\\'ve added them to the general goods trader in Riverwood and you can buy them there if you can\\'t find them.\r\n\r\niNSTALLATION:\r\nUse NMM or add it in the Skyrim/Data directory and activate it with the Skyrim Launcher/data files.\r\n\r\nRemember to endorse if you like it!",
