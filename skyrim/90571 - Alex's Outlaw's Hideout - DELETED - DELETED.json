  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]Hello. Ive wanted to make a shabby looking player home inside of a cave for my assassin character since i didnt find any that i like and now im sharing it with you. I just finished it and tried it out and there seems to be no problem.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f4cccc]Details:[/color]\n<br />There are no static items and there is no custom storage. It is as vanilla as it gets.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f4cccc]Features:[/color]\n<br />It has some weapon plaques and mannequins, some chests, workbenches, a cooking station and more.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f4cccc]Location:[/color]\n<br />You can find it near the Pelagius Farm in Whiterun. If you fast travel there and look south, you should see a new Cave marker on your radar. Head there to discover it.[/size]",
