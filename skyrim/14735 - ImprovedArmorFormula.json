  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"I think the [vanilla] damage reduction formula is too bad, and the later game was nearly broken by that.\\\"\r\nThis is from a forum post I found. I agree entirely.\r\n\r\nIN VANILLA SKYRIM, the formula for damage reduction is as follows:\r\n<%dmgReduction>=(<Armor rating>+100)*.0012\r\n\r\nThis is silly. This means that as your armor increases, your %dmgReduction rises with a linear scale and, worst of all, your effective durability (The amount of damage you can take) will rise exponentially. Which means (calculated values):\r\nA player with:  0   armor and 100hp can take 114 damage\r\nA player with: 300 armor and 100hp can take 192 damage\r\nA player with: 600 armor and 100hp can take 625 damage\r\nNote that from 300 to 600 armor, you have 2x more armor, and over 5x more extra effective hp.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSING MY FORMULA, the formula for damage reduction is as follows:\r\n<%dmgReduction>=<Armor rating>/(<Armor rating> + 100)\r\n\r\nThis is good. This means that as your armor increases, your effective durability (The amount of damage you can take) rises with a linear scale. Which means (calculated values):\r\nA player with:  0   armor and 100hp can take 100 damage\r\nA player with: 300 armor and 100hp can take 400 damage\r\nA player with: 600 armor and 100hp can take 700 damage\r\nNote that from 300 to 600 armor, you have 2x more armor, and 2x more extra effective hp.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave any questions? Good, I like to explain how this all works. There is a FAQ section below you can refer to, or you can post a comment or send me a message and I\\'ll get back to you.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n1) Merge the data folder from the zip file with your Skyrim\\\\data folder.\r\n2) Take off all armor items and turn off all spells until you reach 0 armor. Only when you have 0 armor will the mod initiate. After that, you can put it all back on and it will run normally.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\nQ:Do I have to worry about an armor cap?\r\nA:No. I\\'ve changed the game setting cap to 100%. However, because of how the formula works, it is quite impossible to reach 100% %dmgReduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ:I don\\'t get it.. does your mod make armor better or worse?\r\nA:Neither. The mod lets -you- dictate how effective armor is. Pick between the preset difficulty settings of the download files.\r\nThis mod is not meant to make armor better or worse.\r\nThis mod is only supposed to change the relationship curve between armor and effective health.\r\n\r\n(Later on I will add a version with an ini file that lets -you- dictate precisely how effective armor is. However, until SKSE has an update that includes a function for ini files, I am unable to provide you with an ini file. So for now, simply choose a preset difficulty setting.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ:Do you have any advice on which difficulty setting I should choose?\r\nA:Well, if you want armor effectiveness to be close to vanilla but still with the new curve, select difficulty 2.\r\n\r\nHowever, I like to use difficulty setting 4 and then change the in-game difficulty setting to Adept. That way, I take lots of damage and I deal lots of damage. Most of the time, I will die in 3 hits and my enemies will die in 5 hits. It makes for much more real, intense combat where you must find opportunities to hit them without being hit.. Instead of the usual slice and dice mentality that you fall into with vanilla.\r\n--If you want me to make another difficulty setting, then make a comment and I will make a version for you with your requested difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ:What does the difficulty factor do exactly?\r\nA:The difficulty levels shift the armor vs effective health graph up and down by a factor. \r\nImagine it this way: y = (1/<difficulty>)x ..... y is effective health, x is armor \r\nBasically..\r\nDifficulty 2 means that your armor will give half as much effective hp as Difficulty 1. \r\nDifficulty 4 means that your armor will give one fourth as much effective hp as Difficulty 1. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ:What happens to the armor rating from my shield and/or spells?\r\nA:The formula updates every second. If you equip your shield or cast an armor spell, it will take less than a second to readjust the value. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***MY FAVORITE QUESTION***\r\nQ:Isn\\'t %dmgReduction and effective health almost the exact same thing?\r\nA:No.\r\n-%dmgReduction is the % dmg reduced from incoming dmg.\r\n-Effective health is the amount of damage a character can take.\r\n%dmgReduction is the \\\"derivative\\\" of effective health. If %dmgReduction is linear, effective health is exponential. If %dmgReduction is logarithmic, effective health is linear. \r\nThis is counter-intuitive, but true nonetheless. MATH. Bethesda, plz hire me to fix these types of problems in all your games. Serious. K thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n1) Delete Troy1010_ImprovedArmorFormula.esp from your skyrim\\\\data folder.\r\n2) Delete aaImprovedArmorFormula.pex from your skyrim\\\\data\\\\scripts folder.\r\n3) Delete aaImprovedArmorFormula.psc from your skyrim\\\\data\\\\scripts\\\\source folder.\r\n4) Modify your armor rating to it\\'s origonal.\r\nTo do so, in the game console, type:\r\n\r\n-----(First, take off all your armor and remove all sources of armor rating)\r\nplayer.getav damageresist\r\n-----(This will return your <modified armor rating>. Use this value in the next line)\r\nplayer.modav damageresist -<modified armor rating>\r\nplayer.getav damageresist\r\n-----(This will return your armor rating. It should now be 0. Done)",
