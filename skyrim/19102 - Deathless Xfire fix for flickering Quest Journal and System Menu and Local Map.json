  "summary": "If your Quest Journal, System Menu, Stats Menu and Local Map flicker or show a flashing of yellow-green colors when you open them, you\\'ll probably like this mod. The bug is related to anti aliasing, and the solution up to now was disabling aa or getting used to the bug. This mod makes the menus non-transparent though, and this makes the bug go awa",
  "descriptionHtml": "Recently my Quest Journal, System Menu, Stats Menu and Local Map (the one you see when you press L while on the main map) started flickering or showing a flash of yellow-green colors, very tedious since I open them very often ingame.\r\nI found out the bug is related to multi sample anti aliasing and Amd Xfire, and the solution until now was disabling either aa or Xfire.\r\n\r\nSince I want my Xfire and aa on and I hate bugs, I decided to try and find an alternate solution: I got rid of transparency in said menus, and the flicker disappeared. Now, the bug is still there somewhere, but you can\\'t see it so it\\'s as as good as fixed, unless you absolutely need transparency to be on in those menus.\r\n\r\nIf you have no idea what I\\'m talking about, take a look at the pictures. If you still have no idea what I\\'m talking about, it means you don\\'t have the bug.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\nThere will be compatibility issues only with mods altering the map.swf interface file. I only know of one such mod, Fully Colored Map Markers. With permission from the author, I\\'ve included a version with colored map markers (colors are mostly different though).\r\nThere are no compatibility issues with mods altering the map\\'s meshes or textures, such as A Quality World Map, EzE\\'s World Map or HQ3DMap.\r\nThere are no compatibility issues with SkyUI either.",
