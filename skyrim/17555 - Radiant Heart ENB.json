  "descriptionHtml": "[color=green][b][Center]Please find Grim Gem ENB, the successor to Radiant Heart ENB and Winterfell ENB, here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20798/ [/Center][/b][/color]\r\n\r\nRadiant Heart, a graphic modification for Sykrim based on Boris Vorontsov\\'s ENB Series ( 0.114), aims at a bright, shiny lighting that makes you literally feel the air around you. Still it\\'s meant to keep the warmth of nature and the atmospheric broodiness of nights and dungeons deep.\r\n\r\nYou will find the world feel much more \\\"threedimensional\\\" and also more mystical and at the same time more brilliant as before. This is achieved by many dozends of hours of tweaking highly advanced graphic techniques created by Boris Vorontsov in his ENB series, including an own approach to SSAO that makes you feel the air inbetween, colourful indirect lighting that blends the world together in a very cohesive way and very detailed shadows which pronounce the delicate details of everything. \r\n\r\nWhile it has a very crisp, realistic look sometimes, it\\'s not exactly meant to be a realism mod. You will soon discover, for example, that the night clouds are much darker than you might expect, while the mountain fog glows eerily bright. On a bright day some scenes are diamond dusted and a million sparkles, especially in the near of glacier ice, will dance around you.\r\n\r\nSeeing is believing, so please have a little step into this truely fantastic world... \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\n1) Please do the installation manually and place all the files and subdirectories contained into your Skyrim install folder, where the SkyrimLauncher.exe is located\r\n2) Additionally download the ENB series, version 0.114 by Boris Vorontsov, from this page:\r\nhttp://www.enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0114.htm. \r\nAfter unzipping this KAGE archive, please go into its WrapperVersion subdirectory and just copy the file named d3d9.dll. Please place that d3d9.dll into your Skyrim directory, too.\r\n3) When starting Skyrim don\\'t forget to activate the FurtherDarkDungeons.esp (all credits to Mindflux/artem1s, see also below)\r\n4) I strongly advise using the following two mods to get clarity the mod aims for:\r\nRevampedExteriorFog by Greg Manthey (Gargorias)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9930\r\nRemove Ambient Interior Fog by Greg Manthey (Gargorias)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9571\r\n5) Make sure that in your skyrimprefs.ini (found under user/\\\"username\\\"/my documents[path to skyrim] this line is contained:\r\nbFloatPointRenderTarget=1\r\n\r\nPlease note that this ENB will cost you some performance due to high quality AO and (even simplified) Screen Space Indirect Lighting being activated. \r\n\r\nCredits to:\r\nBoris Vorrontsov for his great ENB Series\r\nAndrej Dudenhefner alias mrhaandi for his excellent smaa solution used here\r\nMatso for his absolutely amazing Depth of Field effect that I use with his permission here\r\nTheRadikal for his twists on the enbeffect.fx and the enbpalette.bmp file that I further modified with his consent and inculde here\r\nMindflux/artem1s for the  essential FurtherDarkDungoens Mod that he kindly allowed me to integrate into the Radiant Heart package\r\nSharpshooter8 for inspring me to start this with his amazing ENB\\'s\r\nPuuloo for his great More Dynamic Shadows Mod that I suggest to keep a very close eye on - he\\'s just giving it the last refinements to make it really perfect\r\n\r\nAdditional graphical mods I use and like:\r\n(HQ Textures by Bethesda)\r\nBetter Dynamic Snow\r\nWarmer Magic Lights\r\nCrimson Tide\r\nEnhanced Distant Terrain\r\nFiner Dust\r\nReal Glaicers\r\nLush Trees\r\nLush Grass\r\nThe Eyes of Beauty\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please give feedback and - if you should like it - please endorse it.\r\n\r\nAll the best\r\nyoungneil1",
