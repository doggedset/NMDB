Her name was Flumpkinand she spent her days pursuing \r<br />a long forgotten recipe, one which could imbue the sacred pumpkin with mighty magical effects. \r<br />Try as Flumpkin might, she could not replicate the recipe her grandmother had made many years back, \r<br />when she was but a cub. \r<br />\r<br />Flumpkin’s fruitless dedication to this research did not sit well with all her peers, especially Tolfdir, \r<br />who believed she was wasting her great talent on this endeavour. \r<br />Flumpkin felt scorned by the other mages, so she decided it would be best if she was to find solace \r<br />and remove any distractions from her research. Flumpkin knew of an Ideal location, a small\r<br />cavern set into the glacial rock beneath the College, along the riverbank. Here\r<br />Flumpkin made a home in the disused storage place that once connected to the\r<br />college above and so, she spent the next 8 years living there until now,\r<br />because now, she has made a discovery.  [/color]\r<br />[center]\r<br />[youtube]0tN4SV_UbrM[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff00ff][size=4]Requirements[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />[color=#ff7700]\r<br />The latest Skyrim Update[/color] \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff00ff][size=4][b]Features\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/size][/color][color=#ff7700]Flumpkin is a new Alchemy Trader, stocking potions, poisons, ingredients and now something a little special. \r<br />(spoiler, its Pumpkins) see screenshots for effects stats of the pumpkins. \r<br />\r<br />[/color][color=#ff7700]Flumpkin will go about her daily business in her home, but she welcomes customers day or night \r<br />and has been known to even let the odd adventurer or two get some rest in her bed if she is not using it.[/color][color=#ff7700] \r<br />\r<br />New Alchemy Skill Book (note)\r<br />\r<br />[/color][color=#ff00ff][size=4][b]Installation\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/size][/color][color=#ff7700]Install with NMM or manager of your choice.\r<br />\r<br />[/color][color=#ff00ff][size=4]Uninstall\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][color=#ff7700]Uninstall with NMM or manager of your choice.\r<br />\r<br />[/color][color=#ff00ff][size=4]Compatibility\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][color=#ff7700]Mod should be compatible with anything that does not change the area of the river below the College bridge.\r<br />\r<br />[/color][color=#ff7700]This mod uses a new texture for InsanitySorrows Pumpkins, if you already have Pumpkins in your game, \r<br />you may be asked to overwrite the textures.
