  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod to share, so be easy on me, I\\'m just an old geezer trying to have some fun.  :)  If there is any interest I\\'ll upload some other followers I\\'ve made.\r\n\r\nTo look like she does in the pictures:\r\nDIMONIZED UNP female body UNP Base Main body V1dot2 by dimon99 here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709\r\nBetter Females version 3 Makeup Version 3 and No Shine by BellaGail here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\nNatural Eyes with Elves Alternative Eyes by nevenbridge here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589\r\nShe comes with a full set of Nightingale Gear, if you want her look like the pictures use UNP - Ultra Skimpy Armor by Nightasy here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9546\r\nTo hide helmets I use Hidden Helms by z999z3mystorys here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13349\r\n\r\nWithout at least UNP body, Bella\\'s faces, and Natural Eyes, you could end up with grey face or worse.\r\n\r\nRequired:\r\nRequires ApachiiSkyHair by Apachii, without it you\\'ll CTD, found here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\n\r\nShe is set to\r\nLvl 1 auto lvl\r\nWeight 40\r\nEssential\r\nCombat Ranger\r\n\r\nIf you want to change her gear, stats, make her nonessential, I suggest Extensible Follower Framework by Expired, found here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12933, don\\'t install with NMM though, download the NMM version, unzip it, and copy XFLMain.esm, XFLMain.bsa, XFLDialogue.esp, XFLPlugins.esp, and XFLTweaks.esp to your Skyrim\\\\Data folder.  UFO should work too, but I prefer EFF for the group commands. \r\n\r\nYou\\'ll find her in Whiterun, she patrols the city from 0800 to 1200, and again from 1300 to 1700\r\nFrom 1200 to 1300 and from 1700 to 1900 she\\'ll be in Dragonsreach eating\r\nFrom 1900 to 2300 she\\'ll be in the Bannered Mare partying (hopefully not too much)\r\nThe picture of her eating is not staged, that\\'s how I found her.\r\n\r\nInstallation is easiest with NMM\r\nOr if you want to install manually extract someplace, click on CGTammy, copy the data folder, and paste it in your Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\nUninstall with NMM if you used NMM to install\r\nOr if installed manually:\r\nDelete:\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\CGTammy.esp\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Meshes\\\\Actor\\\\Character\\\\facegendata\\\\facegeom\\\\CGTammy.esp\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Actor\\\\Character\\\\facegendata\\\\facetint\\\\CGTammy.esp\r\n\r\nAny requests for changes I\\'ll try to accommodate, but changing faces\\\\editing followers in the CK is tricky, and can corrupt the file to point its unusable.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\ndimon99 for the best body\r\nBellaGail for her face textures\r\nnevenbridge for the great eyes\r\nNightasy for the great meshes on gear and his tutorials for making gear.\r\nz999z3mystorys for setting all the helmets to hidden\r\nApachii for the awesome hairs.\r\neamico who I got the sandbox idea from\r\n\r\nFalmerBane for inspiring me to make followers, if you\\'ve never used one of his followers, you should.  They are all simply awesome.",
