  "descriptionHtml": "This is a (very) small sound mod that replaces the sound effect of the Whirlwind Sprint shout.\r<br />\r<br />I got tired of hearing that annoying, nonsensical squeaking in the default sound effect, so I decided to do something about it. While editing the squeaks out, I decided to give the sound a little bit more depth, subtly mixing in new thunderclap sounds. The result is a highly vanilla-esque sound, but without the annoying squeaks and a little more &#34;boominess&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve included a short comparison video, so you can hear the difference yourself. In my experience, I&#39;ve found that the new sound makes the shout much more usable without that irksome squeaking.\r<br />\r<br />Note: This only replaces the shout&#39;s single sound effect, NOT the actual vocal part(s) of the shout. Those remain unchanged.",
