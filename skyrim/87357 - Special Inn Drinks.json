  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wondered what Argonian Ale tasted like? What about Colovian Brandy? Ever missed its flavor after its associated quest? Well, look no further&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds in the ability to purchase these rare drinks for consumption at inns, but due to their rare status, you may find them in limited quantity, if you can find them at all&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Now, drinks like Dragon Breath Mead and Mead with Juniper Berry are excluded from this mod due to them be native to only certain taverns.",
