  "descriptionHtml": "The Crucible is a painstakingly handcrafted series of caverns.  There are very few tile-set constructed rooms- this is to give the dungeon an organic, novel feel.  \r<br />My original intent was to have it be a sort of witches&#39; coven.  I imagine it would also be a good troll dungeon.  I hope to see someone else&#39;s take on it, and their refinements.  This is my first attempt at a dungeon and any feedback would be greatly appreciated.\r<br />\r<br />Important notes:\r<br />-THERE IS NO DOOR CURRENTLY -----&gt;COC aaaCrucible&lt;----- is the only way to enter\r<br />-Most of the &#34;main&#34; area is navmeshed.\r<br />-There are a couple places that errors in the geometry can be observed in normal play, but they are few and far between.  The skylight openings are intended for extra waterfalls and &#34;sunlight&#34; beams, if desired.\r<br />-The player is intended to start at the top of the highest waterfall.  A short drop leads to a ledge and from there the player may walk down two separate paths.\r<br />-There is room for expansion, if desired.  I will be &#34;caving in&#34; the door-into-space, as I cannot fathom navmeshing any more than already required. \r<br />",
