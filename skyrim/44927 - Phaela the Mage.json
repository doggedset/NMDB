  "descriptionHtml": "My little sister was very interested in watching me play Skyrim, so I let her help me make a mage based on her in the CK. Though I had planned on only keeping her as a follower for a little while, I found her to be great fun as a companion, and thought that I would share her online. Phaela is marked as Essential, so killing her off should be very tricky. I\\'ve placed her in the Frozen Hearth in Winterhold.\r\nThis follower is about as close to vanilla as a mod can be, so it should not conflict with anything except for major alterations to the inn itself.\r\nCritique and comments are welcome! Thank you!",
