  "descriptionHtml": "I ADVISE YOU PLACE THIS MOD IN THE LOAD ORDER ABOVE ANY QUEST MODS YOU MIGHT HAVE INSTALLED, TO AVOID ANY CONFLICTS.\r\n\r\nI originally created Frostfang Coven for myself. I enjoy playing vampire characters and found Castle Volkihar a little too cliche for my tastes, so decided to make something a little more quaint, and populated it with three rather useful companions; Morrigan, Deacon and Alanna.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Coven is designed for vampires, I have made it accessible to everyone. Simply install the mod and wait for the courier to deliver your mail. Once inside, you will have access to;\r\n\r\n+ A highly detailed and frequently updated player home.\r\n+ All your crafting needs; including the new Staff Enchanting Table.\r\n+ Three vampires with their own agendas and schedules, who also act as merchants and trainers.\r\n+ A secret room to store all your valuables.\r\n+ Plenty of materials, ingerdients and clutter.\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s more, with this mod you also get a dedicated author who is committed to constantly weeding out bugs, tweaking optimization and steadily improving your experience. \r\n\r\nPlease leave comments describing your experience, with any bugs you might have experienced. I\\'d also love to hear your thoughts on ways to improve this home. \r\n\r\nNot to your liking? Check out my previous mod; Temple of Merith.",
