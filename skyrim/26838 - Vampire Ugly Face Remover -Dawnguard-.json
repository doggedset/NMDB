  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />[size=5]Thank you all for 1k endoresements[/size].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is a REALLY simple mod, i made in 5 minutes and therefore issues may occure but for me it worked so i thought sharing is caring :)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5][b]DISCLAIMER:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod is somewhat old but still works as intended. However I recently made another mod with which you can use ANY facetexture you want. All you need to do, is press a button. I recommend you check it out: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57346/]UHFTfV - Use Human Face Texture for Vampires[/url] (I may have overdone it with the acronym :D)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4][b]Description:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />In my opinion is the players face ugly, once he is transformed into a vampire. My attempt to fix this via &#34;showracemenu&#34; failed every time i loaded a save. So i replaced the vampire face texture with the vanilla human face texture and the texture from &#34;Better Females by Bella&#34;. There are two files. One contains the vanilla male and female human facetexture and the other contains only the female texture from &#34;Better Females by Bella&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff0000]\r<br />[size=4]How it works:[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />The Dawnguard files are in a file called Dawnguard.bsa whereas my files are in a folder structure. Skyrim uses the .bsa as resource BUT prefers &#34;raw folders&#34;. So my files do not overwrite anything. Actually you can do this yourself but i thought some people dont know how to do this or are too lazy.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff0000][size=4]Recommended Mods:[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57346/]UHFTfV - Use Human Face Texture for Vampires[/url] (One needs to do some advertise for oneself :D)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42049/]Porcelain Vampire Skin For- CBBE UNP CHSBHC ADEC SeveNBase and Dream Girl[/url] (Makes my mod obsolete, but I use it nowadays and I really recommend it)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38829/]BVFE - Better Vampire Fangs and Eyes[/url] (Gives all vampires better fangs and eyes, hence the name)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41634/]DVA Dynamic Vampire Appearance[/url] (Your vampire character will have different appearances depending on your vampiric stage and some other things)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4][b]Issues:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />The Vampires in Volkihar Keep now also have a normal facetexture\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Changelog:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1.0 Release\r<br />1.1 Added &#34;Better Females by Bella&#34; version ,  removed ReadMe (full of grammar mistakes etc) from first file\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4][b]\r<br />Credits:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />BellaGail for the awesome female facetextures ([url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812]Better Females by Bella[/url])",
