  "summary": "Light armor or normal clothing",
  "descriptionHtml": "My first armor mod for Skyrim, based on CBBE v3. \r\nLight armor or normal clothing, craftable at leather category. You will need some steel ingots, leather and leather strips. Armor version is upgradable.\r\nCorset is made for females only, and no weight slider is supported (everything is based on max weight body). For those who think that the normal version is too tight, I\\'ve created two less tight variants (50% and 0%). The most constricting version is and will remain the default version. This is a corset, and it must be tight, but I don\\'t think that it is unnaturally tight, waist circumference is reduced to 75% of the original value. Of course it would be difficult to run and fight wearing this, but you do many impossible things in Skyrim.\r\n\r\nI was asked to make it compatible with other body versions - my answer is no, sorry, but I prefer to make a new things than changing it over and over. Third version of this mod was made only because during the process of modelling a new armor, I\\'ve found that CBBE was upgraded and I wanted to compare it to the older version (ok, I was asked to do this).\r\n\r\n[b]Changes:[/b]\r\n[b]3.0[/b]\r\n- Upgraded everything to CBBE version 3.2.3\r\n- Fixed issues with seams. Finally I understood what I was doing wrong\r\n- Added clothing version (the \\\"armor\\\" version will contain \\\"light\\\" in the name) \r\n\r\n[b]2.0[/b]\r\n- Added cupless version\r\n- Less tight versions included in the main file and available for crafting\r\n- Pants are separated from main \\\"armor\\\" part\r\n\r\n[b]1.0[/b]\r\n- Initial release\r\n\r\n[b]Installation/Upgrade:[/b]\r\nCopy contents of Data directory to your Skyrim Data directory.
