  "descriptionHtml": "[color=yellow][b]What is GELO?[/b][/color]\r<br />If you&#39;ve ever played any games like Diablo or Borderlands, you know affix based loot.\r<br />Items where combinations of prefixes and suffixes determine the enchantments on items.\r<br />\r<br />GELO is an ambitiously massive loot mod that adds over 60,000 affix based armor items to the game. \r<br />You can even import armor from other mods and use them with GELO&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Compatibility & Requirements[/b][/color]\r<br />This mod uses a SkyProc based patcher.\r<br />\r<br />It automatically detects DLC.\r<br />Example: if you have dragonborn, it will add enchanted nordic carved armor variants and such.\r<br />If you don&#39;t, no worries. You just won&#39;t find nordic carved gear.\r<br />\r<br />You may run into compatibility errors if you try to run a pre-compiled ESP with another mod that edits leveled lists.\r<br />\r<br />Java 1.7+ is required for the patcher. [url=http://javatester.org/version.html]Click Here to check your Java Version.[/url]\r<br />your armor mods must not use outdated BODT records.\r<br />See bottom of page for details on how to update a mod from BODT to BOD2.\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Feature Details[/b][/color]\r<br />- [b][url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AldEhLOK6ejJdGtZUlVIbmJvbUhpLUIzMGNReFBmN3c&single=true&gid=25&output=html]List of New Enchantments[/url][/b]\r<br />- [b]Yes you can turn the name prefix/suffixes off[/b]\r<br />- [b]Frequency of new loot[/b]\r<br />50% of enchanted loot will be vanilla loot.\r<br />50% will be GELO loot.\r<br />- [b]More Rare Loot.[/b]\r<br />In vanilla, only daedric, dragonscale, and dragonplate armor are rare (ie 20x rarer than other armor)\r<br />This mod expands the rare enchanted loot tables with new items like ancient falmer.\r<br />Unenchanted loot tables are not touched at all.\r<br />- [b]Disenchantable[/b]\r<br />Every new enchantment added by this mod can be learned.\r<br />- [b]You can buy a catalogue of enchantments from M&#39;aiq the liar.[/b]\r<br />To teleport to M&#39;aiq, use the Console Command:\r<br />Player.moveto ba0cb\r<br />PS: I think it&#39;s funner if don&#39;t spoil the enchantments, so you can discover them for the first time in loot.\r<br />- [b]Balance:[/b]\r<br />It&#39;s not really feasible to make armor with 6 different enchantments without making things at least a little OP.\r<br />On the other hand, getting 100 enchanting, maxed perks, and spamming fortify archery is just as OP\r<br />But it&#39;s nothing the difficulty slider and or a difficulty mod can&#39;t fix.\r<br />- [b]Sigil Stones:[/b]\r<br />Sigil stones are optional in the patcher version.\r<br />They have a chance of replacing gems in loot, starting at lvl 30.\r<br />They serve no purpose other than to be sold or disenchanted to learn new enchantments.\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Tutorial: How to use the SkyProc Patcher[/b][/color]\r<br />[url=http://youtu.be/AD9kJe7QaYQ]http://youtu.be/AD9kJe7QaYQ[/url]\r<br />[youtube]AD9kJe7QaYQ[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Minor Tweaks[/b][/color]\r<br />[b]Enchantments:[/b]\r<br />Skill Tags Removed and descriptions shortened.\r<br />Nothing special here, most enchantment and balance mods will remove skill tags from enchantments.\r<br />It&#39;s done to prevent bugs.\r<br />\r<br />The descriptions of various enchantments have been shortened to make them readable on armor with 6 enchantments.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Perk Tweaks[/b]\r<br />Very small tweaks that prevent bugs.\r<br />Example:\r<br />Vanilla Bladesman 1 - Set Player Crit Chance with one handed to 10\r<br />Tweaked Bladesman 1 - +10 Player Crit Chance with one handed weapons\r<br />\r<br />The tweaked version is less buggy because it won&#39;t override enchantments and wonky stuff like that.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Armor Rating Tweaks[/b]\r<br />In Vanilla: \r<br />Daedric Helmets have less than 50% of the armor of a cuirass.\r<br />But Iron helmets have over 60% of the armor rating of a cuirass.\r<br />With the tweak:\r<br />Ratio of armor ratings between all slots are the same now.\r<br />This is done because the mod selects enchantment tier based on armor rating.\r<br />You may remove these tweaks via TES5Edit or override them with other mods.\r<br />The only consequences would be stuff like low tier armor having different enchantment tiers.\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Future Modules (WIP):[/b][/color]\r<br />Weapon Variants Module\r<br />Handplaced Unique/Legendary Loot Module\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][b]Uninstallation[/b][/color]\r<br />Just delete the bsa&#39;s and esp&#39;s.\r<br />You should always unequip all enchanted items before uninstalling ANY enchantment mod.\r<br />GELO is no exception to this rule.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][b]Regards to Updating Versions[/b][/color]\r<br />Delete GELO_Patcher_Build.esp and update all the relevant ESP & BSA files.\r<br />Insure that your load order and active mods are correct.\r<br />DO NOT play skyrim until you run a new patcher. (or you will lose all your GELO loot)\r<br />Run the patcher jar just like you did originally.\r<br />Make sure that the new GELO_Patcher_Build.esp has an identical file name and capitalization as before (or you will lose all your GELO loot)\r<br />And that&#39;s it, you should be good.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][b]Regards to TES5edit[/b][/color]\r<br />TES5edit may tag some records as dirty edits.\r<br />This is because they aren&#39;t used by the game.\r<br />But these records may be important to the SkyProc Patcher.\r<br />Please do not remove &#34;dirty edits&#34; unless you are a very proficient modder.\r<br />I will periodically trim dirty edits with TES5 edit as I update this mod.\r<br />So please leave it to me if possible.\r<br />If you feel like I missed a dirty edit, feel free to report them though.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][b]Compatibility with other SkyProc Patchers:[/b][/color]\r<br />Lootification - Lootification only affects vanilla enchantments, and ones designed similarly to vanilla enchantments. GELO only affects enchantments that I have added. So the two are generally compatible. Load order shouldn&#39;t matter.\r<br />ASIS - GELO and ASIS don&#39;t overlap in any edits, so they should be compatible. Load order shouldn&#39;t matter.\r<br />SkyRe/Reproccer - you MUST run ReProccer AFTER running GELO first.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][b]Help&#33; Null Pointer Exception Error&#33;[/b][/color]\r<br />Null pointer exceptions occur when my patcher can&#39;t find a file.\r<br />Here are things to check:\r<br />\r<br />- Did you remember to put GELO_Vanilla_Base_File.esp, GELO_Dawnguard_Base_File.esp, and GELO_Dragonborn_Base_File.esp into your data folder AND make them active in your load order?\r<br />- GELO_IMPORTER_CASE_SENSITIVE.txt and GELO Armor Patcher.jar need to be in the same folder.\r<br />- do not edit the name or capitalization of the GELO_IMPORTER_CASE_SENSITIVE.txt file name.\r<br />- Any ESP files found inside of GELO_IMPORTER_CASE_SENSITIVE.txt must be active in the load order, and higher up than the GELO base files in the load order.\r<br />The name of the ESP file and the name you type into GELO_IMPORTER_CASE_SENSITIVE.txt must match exactly, capitalization included.\r<br />- Try moving GELO_IMPORTER_CASE_SENSITIVE.txt & GELO Armor Patcher.jar up or down a folder. (the name of the folder does not matter)\r<br />- do not put any esm files into GELO_IMPORTER_CASE_SENSITIVE.txt\r<br />- If you don&#39;t have dawnguard/dragonborn, you do not need to use GELO_Dawnguard_Base_File.esp or GELO_Dragonborn_Base_File.esp respectively, at any point. You can delete them.\r<br />- I recommend using either NMM or using skyrim directly to edit your load order. Other programs may store your load order in a separate location where the patcher cannot read.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Case by case[/b]\r<br />at skyprocstarter.SkyProcStarter.runChangesToPatch(SkyProcStarter.java:542)\r<br />This error means you might have a typo in your GELO_IMPORTER_CASE_SENSITIVE.txt file.\r<br />\r<br />at skyprocstarter.SkyProcStarter.runChangesToPatch(SkyProcStarter.java:572)\r<br />This error means one of the esp&#39;s you&#39;re loading in GELO_IMPORTER_CASE_SENSITIVE.txt were made using a very old version of creation kit.\r<br />Simply load the mod into an updated version of the creation kit and save.\r<br />\r<br />It wouldn&#39;t hurt to tell the mod maker to update to BOD2 as well, there&#39;s no reason not to.\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;re not getting an error but your patcher just won&#39;t finish loading, even after 10-15 minutes.\r<br />(it&#39;s not abnormal for the patcher to take even as long as 3-5 minutes though)\r<br />This means the patcher has reached a limit on the amount of memory it&#39;s willing to allocate to the patcher.\r<br />First, try turning off all programs and setting the patcher&#39;s priority to high via the task manager.\r<br />That might not work though, so here&#39;s a [url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/350344-allocating-more-memory-to-java-windows/]guide on how to allocated memory for java[/url]\r<br />If that isn&#39;t enough, disable any mods that aren&#39;t relevant to the patcher.\r<br />Try to keep any that edit armor leveled lists.\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Instructions for Mod Organizer Users by Tristamid[/b][/color]\r<br />    Download GELO and add it to MO.\r<br />    Right click GELO and click the option &#39;Open in Explorer&#39;.\r<br />    Fix GELO using my previous methods, changing the file structure, .jar, and adding the .bat file.\r<br />    At the top of the screen will be a file tree (a url) that you will need to copy to the clipboard.\r<br />    Return to the MO screen.\r<br />    At the top of the latest MO at the time of writing (12.9) is a green and white gear button called Modify Executables.  Click that.\r<br />    A popup screen appears.  Under Title, give the executable an appropriate name, such as GELO 1.5.\r<br />    For &#39;Binary&#39; you&#39;ll want to use the browse button &#39;...&#39; to navigate to the GELO folder under MO.  You can shortcut this by pasting in the file tree (url) onto the top of the screen (Windows 7 users) to appear directly inside the folder.\r<br />    Click the GELO.bat file.  NOT THE .jar&#33;\r<br />    For &#39;Start In&#39;, repeat the process of 8 and 9, but this time choose the folder itself.  It should appear empty to you, just click &#34;select folder.&#34;\r<br />    The final product should look like this:\r<br />    Title: GELO Armor Patcher 1.5.\r<br />    Binary: G:&#92;Full Games&#92;Mod Organizer Skyrim&#92;mods&#92;GELO - Grimys Enchanted Loot Overhaul&#92;SkyProc Patchers&#92;SkyProc Patchers&#92;GELO Patcher.bat\r<br />    Start In: G:&#92;Full Games&#92;Mod Organizer Skyrim&#92;mods&#92;GELO - Grimys Enchanted Loot Overhaul&#92;SkyProc Patchers&#92;SkyProc Patchers\r<br />    Note:  The text in blue is my own personal file structure, yours will be different, but that&#39;s okay.\r<br />    Click Modify at the bottom of the popup.\r<br />    Click OK.\r<br />    On the right side of the MO screen, make sure the GELO .esps are all activated, and in the right load order.  (Protip:  BOSS is pro.)\r<br />    Click the SAVE button on the top of the load order/esp tab.\r<br />    Use the dropdown menu at the top of the screen to select the GELO.exe you created with MO, and then click RUN.  A black command prompt will appear and then the GELO.jar menu will appear.\r<br />    Configure and run the GELO patch.  Note that when it&#39;s running, all MO mods that you have will appear being scanned by GELO.\r<br />    Close the prompt when it says it&#39;s finished and you&#39;re all set.  Run Skyrim through MO as usual and GELO will work.",
