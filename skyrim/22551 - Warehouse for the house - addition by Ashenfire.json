He started the mod.\r<br />\r<br />I have created a new project:   WareHouseContainersAsh\r<br />So if you want drag and drop containers that I create, you will have to go the the\r<br />WareHouseContainersAsh Project for updates.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The original author hellcat5 gave us a great break.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> I am just adding on to his room for MODDERS.  \r<br />Fixed potions and scripts to be predictable now.\r<br />\r<br />You can copy and paste the hard to create items.  Mannequins, dagger rack display with activators, weapon racks, bookshelves, interior walls and droppable items.\r<br />\r<br />Drag and drop potions and the triggers for them, then link ref the &#39;orange&#39; container\r<br />to the orange dummy potions on the display.  Scripts included.  \r<br />Must make own keywords and forms to match the scripts.\r<br />IT WORKS when you coc to the cell.  It won&#39;t work if you only drag and drop.\r<br />Look for future version, trying to make them droppable.\r<br />\r<br />You can drag and drop an actor and the 2 woodpiles it is linked to.  The actor will carry\r<br />firewood.  You must use the AI PACKAGE I created or look at my AI package and create the same\r<br />one in your active file.    There is a book next to the actor that explains how to make it work.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />coc warehousehome          if you want to take a look, but it is meant for the creation kit.",
