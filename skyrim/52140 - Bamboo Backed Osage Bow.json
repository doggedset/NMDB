  "descriptionHtml": "Bamboo Backed Osage Bow is a bow made from a sheet of bamboo and reinforced with osage wood .\r<br />The mod replaces lavender plants for bamboo plants , they retain the same chemical properties so if someone used the lavender for some potion can use the bamboo now, unless someone used the lavender to bring it behind the ear.\r<br />Bamboo plants can be found it in all Tamriel , even within counties or can buy it at any merchant.\r<br />\r<br />The bow can be crafted in the forge in the Wooden category and three things are required for this, steel ingots , Leather Strips and bamboo, of course.\r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT: This mod is not compatible with any other mod that uses the plant or ingredient lavender.\r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT: Make a backup of your previous saved games.\r<br />\r<br />Installation : I recommend using NMM.\r<br />Uninstalling : I recommend using NMM.",
