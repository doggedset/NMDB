  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new player home just north of Riverwood. If you don\\'t fancy living in a hole in the ground or feel that having your own castle is more than a tad ostentatious then this modest, secluded yet picturesque home is just for you. It is packed with all the features you could ever want or need and boasts some great views of Skyrim itself.\r\n\r\nNow, there is no shortage of very decent Player Home mods on Nexus. However, I felt alot of them gave the player too much of an advantage via either items, perks or both.\r\n\r\nSo, as to not unbalance the game, this house does not actually contain any items or anything else that would otherwise give you an advantage in any way. It does however have PLENTY on shelfs, weapon racks and storage space to display all the loot you acquire through out your adventures. I created this house with the idea of being able to fill it with all the things you find whilst relaxing in its natural surroundings.\r\n\r\nSome of it\\'s features include but are not limited to:\r\n- Two story house\r\n- Study\r\n- Working kitchen\r\n- Large sleeping quarters\r\n- Living area\r\n- Basement\r\n- Alchemy room\r\n- Enchanting room\r\n- Storage room\r\n- Jail\r\n- Practice room\r\n- Smith with workbench, grinding stone, tanning rack and smelt.\r\n- Archery practice area\r\n- Stables\r\n- Hidden safe/panic room\r\n- Armour and Weapon Display Room\r\n- Library capable of storing 324 Books\r\n- Many harvestable plants\r\n- Super Secret Escape Tunnel (Which is quiet useful if a dragon decides to land on the roof).\r\n\r\nI also added two fast travel points depending on whether you choose to use a horse or not. Also, there are some keys to find about the place, so make sure you have a good look around.\r\n\r\nThis mod does not require any additional mods. That said, this mod is complimented by the 2K HD texture packs.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: If you are updating from version 1.1 or less be sure to collect all your stuff from the house as the ESP name has changed (now static). Also if none of your bookcases or armour stands don\\'t work or are invisible, try fast travelling away from and returning back to the lodge.\r\nALSO IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading from 1.4 to 1.5 ensure you take your items out of the noble trunk in the study and the small chest in the Alchemy room.\r\n\r\nFLOATING GRASS For those of you with floating grass go here:\r\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/41058482/SkyrimMods/Ridgeview/FloatingGrass.txt\r\n\r\nIf you like this mod make sure you spead the word or even endorse.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to leave feedback as comments are always welcome.\r\n\r\nI would ask this mod to not be redistributed.\r\n\r\nCHANGE LOG\r\n\r\nVersion 1.5\r\n\r\n- Fixed two contains that still has respawn properties (Noble trunk in the study and the small chest in the Alchemy room), See ALSO IMPORTANT.\r\n- Fixed the way dragons interact with the house.\r\n- Some lighting adjustments.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.4\r\n\r\n- Added a secret escape tunnel in the event you needs to escape(Good for dragons when they visit).\r\n- Couple of minor fixes.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3\r\n\r\n- Added Weapon plaques to display room\r\n- Some minor changes to the study\r\n- Made the Main key easier to find\r\n- Some minor bug fixes\r\n- Made ESP name static\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\n- Display Room\r\n- Library\r\n\r\nSome minor fixes.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n\r\n- Fixed issue with safe key duplicating across several containers over Skyrim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
