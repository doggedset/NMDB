Although you may need to cut the hair of your girl off haha. But it looks neat and uses the Female skin-texture for it instead of the males.\r\n\r\nthe WARNING: The gloves are the males texture as well since there is no seperate Female Gloves; be warned that NPCs that are male wearing this armor may have just their gloves and (possibly the chest) retextured. Although the Female Chest is seperate.\r\n\r\nWARNING AGAIN: I have not tested-well I have tested the Male Version and Female version out at the same time and they work FINE. No problems at all (Besides them sharing the same gloves and hat (Hat is shared if you don\\'t use the vanilla file; which is why I reccomend it).\r\n\r\nBugs? Problems? Please let me know! I tested my ugly-ass female like 12 times. Yeah, she\\'s ugly. Muwa ha ha ha! Actually I kinda like her. Damnit emotions...\r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like the skin-texture - I\\'m sorry. But it works for my eye!",
