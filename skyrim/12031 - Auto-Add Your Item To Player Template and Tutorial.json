INFORMATION ON THE MOD           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod is a template that you can modify to automatically add your custom item or spell \r\nto the player without using console codes.\r\n\r\n\t   The .esp is a playable modders resource.  It is set up to automatically add a spell, a \r\nweapon, and a piece of armor or clothing item to the player\\'s inventory.  This happens the first\r\ntime you play Skyrim after installing the mod.  Messages appear in the upper left corner of the \r\nscreen to notify you that items have been added.\r\n\r\n\t   The three things which are added are just custom versions of low-level Skyrim items.  They\r\nare there for demonstration purposes and as placeholders.  This is how you use this modders resource:\r\n  \r\n(1) You add your custom item or items to this mod.\r\n(2) You change the script and properties so that the mod delivers your new item or items to the player\r\n    instead of the placeholder or placeholders included in the mod.\r\n(3) You can disable the addition of items you don\\'t want.  Like if you want a mod to add your new \r\n    spell, then you change the script and properties to add your spell instead of mine, and disable\r\n    the portion of the script that adds a weapon and piece of armor, because you just want the mod\r\n    to add your new spell.\r\n(4) You can change the message the player receives on getting your custom spell or item.  The current\r\n    messages are very generic and would apply to anything.  You can leave them alone, or customize \r\n    them to say the name of the spell or item the player receives.  You can disable the message so\r\n    that the spell or item is added secretly and silently if you wish.  You can disable the messages\r\n    for items that are not added by your mod.  So if your mod just adds a spell, then you can disable \r\n    the  messages about the weapon and the armor piece.\r\n\r\n\t   If you wish to add something other than a spell, weapon, or armor/clothing piece, that can \r\nbe done, but is a bit more complicated.\r\n\r\n\t   If you wish to add more than one spell, weapon, or armor/clothing piece, that can also be\r\ndone but it takes a bit more work.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod includes a pictorial tutorial on how to edit this mod for adding your own items to\r\nthe game without the ugliness and annoyance of console codes.  The tutorial is written at a fairly low \r\nlevel for beginners.  It is 21 pages long, contains 34 images, and is in PDF format.     \t   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n2. Installation                           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n           Extract (decompress) the .esp and Scripts folder to your Skyrim directory.  \r\n(It will be something like *Installation directory*\\\\Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data)\r\nMark the box next to Auto-Add Your Item To Player Template.esp in your mod manager.\r\n \r\n           Alternately, extract files someplace else.  Then move the .esp and scripts folder \r\nto Skyrim\\\\Data.  Mark the box next to the plugin in your mod manager.\r\n************************************************************************\r\n3. Version History    \r\n************************************************************************\r\nV 1.0    3/3/12   Initial release.   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n4. Conflicts, Known Issues, and Troubleshooting\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   You need a little bit of modding skill in order to be able to use this modders resource.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod will not work if you don\\'t install both the .esp and the Scripts folder in the\r\nproper locations.\r\n\r\n\t   If you locate a bug, contact David Brasher on TES Nexus so that the situation can be\r\nexamined and can hopefully be fixed. \r\n************************************************************************\r\n5.
