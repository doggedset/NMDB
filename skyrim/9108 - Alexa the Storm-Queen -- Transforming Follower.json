  "descriptionHtml": "REQUIREMENTS:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url]\r\nSorry, its a requirement because the Vanilla hairs are JUST SO BAD.\r\n\r\nLooking for artists and level designers.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not much of a story person or an artist, (I\\'m a programmer) I have no problems writing the quests, scripts, AI, levels, anything to do with the CK.\r\n\r\nWARNING: THIS FOLLOWER IS CURRENTLY RIDICULOUSLY OVERPOWERED.\r\nAlso she looks quite bad under vanilla as you can see.\r\nI only included assets I made myself so I wouldn\\'t have to go around acquiring permission for all the customization I personally use (I have a separate ESP for this as it requires multiple plugins)\r\n\r\nYour probably thinking oh great another follower mod, but she isn\\'t just any follower, she can become a FREAKING dragon outdoors for two minutes. ONE THAT SPITS LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nSo I decided I would release a little preview of this mod before I actually got deep into the story, I did some playing with the Creation Kit for a few days to get the hang of every aspect and see just what it was capable of. I had an original story in mind for this character to be an Amazon but I figured what kind of reward could she give at the end of the quest line other than items?\r\n\r\nHow about she IS a dragon and maybe you can ride her when the time comes (Sexual innuendo? I THINK NOT). Usually not the greatest idea to change a characters background, but it worked about because I built the story up as a shell and left locations as variables (Who does that? I DO)\r\n\r\nHer dialogue is pretty bare right now, it extends a little after you make her your current follower, I attempted to make an infinite follower mod before this but it seemed the whole system was based around one reference alias holding the current follower (WHY?!) so acquiring multiple actors through the vanilla system was a dead end and would require a new system.\r\n\r\nOh right, where is she located? LOL Riverwood\\'s Sleeping Giant Inn... I also MAY have left her OP horse outside.\r\n\r\n\r\nI just wanted to get this mod out there and let people know that I am looking for collaborators in this long story-filled journey. I feel pretty confident in my Creation Kit skills at this point.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.3.2\r\n-Updated Alexa\\'s human and dragon form appearance\r\n-Custom facetint\r\n-Improved scripts\r\n-Packaged as BSA\r\n\r\nVersion 0.3.1\r\n-Packaged scripts, oops\r\n\r\nVersion 0.3\r\n-Changed Alexa\\'s Dragon form to be a unique actor to prevent save leaks\r\n-Changed Alexa\\'s Dragon form mesh to be different from regular dragons\r\n-Changed Alexa\\'s default appearance\r\n-Changed Greymane\\'s mesh to be a lightning horse (Will be renamed to something more appropriate later)\r\nVersion 0.2\r\n-Updated her transformation effects, doesn\\'t look so awful now, and she also stays on the ground for 3 seconds before flying.
