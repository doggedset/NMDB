  "summary": "Simple retexture of the Flamberge Rot and flamberge blau from Bobs Armory (required). Makes the sword appear to be red hot. for the F Rot. Makes F Blau an icicle. the proper name should be flammenschwert Zweihander but naming options are your own.<br />credit to Mr. Dave and Bobs Armory",
  "descriptionHtml": "This makes the \"Flamberge Rot\" from Bobs Armory Skyrim edition appear as though it were a piece of metal that was in the process of cooling. The blade is RED HOT. The tip is approaching WHITE HOT. near the handle, the blade is only just warming up.\n<br />\n<br />Now includes \"Black Ice\" the frozen counterpart. Replaces \"Beidenhander Blau\"\n<br />\n<br />Both textures rely on the mod \"Bobs Armory Skyrim Edition which can be found here:\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12060\n<br />\n<br /> Just drop the new texture file into its corresponding folder. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />credit to Mr. Dave and Bobs Armory\n<br />\n<br />I plan to put all my \"Saint\" files into one mod, when all the permissions have been OK'd.\n<br />\n<br />This is officially the end of the mod. \n<br />\n<br />This next part can be skipped, it deals with another mod entirely.\n<br />\n<br />I will re-phrase this part so as not to seem demanding, which I see now i may have been.\n<br />\n<br />The excellent Hothtrooper, whose mailbox is full, helped me out personally once. \n<br />Armor, especially around the neck area, can pinch you. It's not fun, I should know, owning a mostly authentic suit of Italian blah blah blah. So when I came up with the concept for Ruthula, I designed her armor to incorporate a fluffy fur collar so her hair wouldn't get caught (and yes, she wears a helmet and a padded arming cap. Sallet or Armet when the fighting is intense. Sallet is nice because its very breathable, and feels lighter because the helmet is split into two parts)\n<br />\n<br />Anyways. Hothtrooper made that fur collar mod listed below, so true, I don't need the credit. But the idea, and the fact that the mod now exist, AND a sequel mod... I'm just saying, it wouldn't be totally out of left field to ask for a nod of credit. I may be a junior modder, but someday I'll be there too. I am by no means upset that I am not credited, I didn't actually do the work.\n<br />\n<br />Fur Collar and Exotic Fur Collar are listed below.\n<br />\n<br />Fur Collar\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35486\n<br />\n<br />Fur Collar Collection (exotic fur collar)\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72690\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />CREDITS:\n<br />Bethesda\n<br /> Mr.Dave and Bobs Armory\n<br />Hothtrooper for Fur Collar\n<br />Gisla for Fur Collar colors\n<br />\n<br />last but not least, that picture of Ruthula is my property. I drew it. Don't take my work or I will find you and eat you, bones and all.",
