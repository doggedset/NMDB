  "descriptionHtml": "AS ALWAYS, my screenshots are worthless.  Please feel free to take your own screenies and post them here! :D\r\n\r\nThis is my take on the Bloodskal Blade.  Originally I did this for my own purposes but after how well it came out I\\\\\\'ve decided to release. Particularly because only a few have really tried to touch the blade\\\\\\'s textures, but also because why not. :D\r\n\r\nAnyway, this will naturally conflict with any other texture mod that affects the weapon.  However, anything to do with the enchantment and its effects will be fully compatible.  The Texture size is 2048x2048. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nThis should be able to work with NMM, but I don\\\\\\'t know for sure.  If it doesn\\\\\\'t, please make sure to let me know. \r\n\r\nFor manual installation, simply open up the Bloodskal_Blade_HD.rar  and extract the textures folder within to your Skyrim Data folder, and overwrite as needed.
