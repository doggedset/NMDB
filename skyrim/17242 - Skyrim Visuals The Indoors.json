This will push some players to use spells, torches, and other light sourches in areas they find hard to see. Dark areas will allow players to feel more hidden and stealthy instead of feeling like your exposed.\r\n\r\nArea that have been modified include:\r\n\r\n- Blackreach\r\n- Houses\r\n- Caves\r\n- Dungeons\r\n- Towers\r\n- Mines\r\n\r\n* Works great with SV - The Outdoors.\r\n* Should have no performance drop.\r\n* This will not be compatible with any mod that changes the colors for interiors.\r\n* Realistic Lighting may or may not work (haven\\'t tested it yet) but it\\'s not recommended.\r\n\r\n=============================================================================\r\nKNOWN ISSUES\r\n=============================================================================\r\n\r\n* In certain spots of a dungeon or room, the colors will change back to the vanilla version then change back to my mod once you leave the spot or room.  This issue, however, sometimes addes more immersion to the game.  I currently have no knowledge on how to solve this issue.  If you know how to fix this or have a link that may provide some help I will greatly apprieciate it.\r\n\r\n* Your character seems to be in a massive blue box thats open on the top when outside. This box moves with your character making things seem slightly tinted blue execpt the sky above.  This uncommon issue seems to be caused by loading your saves very frequently.  I believe this only occurs if you have SV - The Outdoors installed.  This issue can be easily fixed by simpily by changing the load order of SV - Indoors and setting it to load after SV - Outdoors (this also works vice versa).  Start up the game and load your save.  The problem should be solved.   \r\n\r\n=============================================================================\r\nFUTURE UPDATE\r\n=============================================================================\r\n\r\nv1.2\r\n\r\n=============================================================================\r\nFUTURE MODS\r\n=============================================================================\r\n\r\n==//==//==//==//==//==//==//==//==//==\r\nS.I.V.E (Skyrim Indoor Visual Enhancement)\r\n==\\\\\\\\==\\\\\\\\==\\\\\\\\==\\\\\\\\==\\\\\\\\==\\\\\\\\==\\\\\\\\==\\\\\\\\==\\\\\\\\==\\\\\\\\==\\\\\\\\==\r\n\r\nDescription (may change):  This mod will improve the SV - The Indoors mod by modifying the imagespaces.
