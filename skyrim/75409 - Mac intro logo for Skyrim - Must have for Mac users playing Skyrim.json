  "descriptionHtml": "Of course, Skyrim is a Windows only game and the only way to get it working on a Mac is by using a wrapper, (like Wineskin) dual-boot or in software like Virtual Box/Parallels, but I thought it would still be nice to add the text that you are playing the &#34;Apple Edition&#34;. It&#39;s just appearance, but maybe nice to show off to your friends and make them jealous that they don&#39;t have a shiny logo at booting up the game.\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][u]You could help me though by making a .bik version to provide an easier way to use it as in-game logo.[/u][/i][/b]",
