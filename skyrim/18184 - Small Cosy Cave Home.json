  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first house mod for Skyrim.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple and basic-ish player home in a cave which offers the basic essentials without being too massive or too small. \r\nThe project objectives for this mod were:\r\na) Not be in Riverwood like 492,389,843 other player-house mods. \r\nb) Be small and basic to provide essential services and storage for characters of all levels.\r\nc) Be visually appealing and provide a cosy \\\"at-home\\\" feeling.\r\n\r\nHOME ENTRANCE IS LOCATED IN FALKREATH BEHIND THE GENERAL-GOODS STORE\r\nNotes:\r\n- Enchanting and Alchemy tables WITH storage chests for gems and ingredients\r\n- Two Mannequins \r\n- Display cases and weapon plaques.\r\n- Chests, drawers and safe.\r\n- THERE IS NO NAVMESH. I\\'m holding back on making one until the 1.6 beta patch goes live as it is supposed to fix the navmesh bug.\r\n\r\nAnd that\\'s it. The point of this mod is to stay simple and clean. Nothing extravagant here. \r\n\r\nComments and criticisms are welcomed, and please check back regularly for updates! Any updates that affect containers will be made manual-download only and will come with a warning so you don\\'t have to worry about your gear going missing before you can relocate it.\r\n\r\nHistory: \r\n1.0\r\n-Release\r\n1.1\r\n-Fixed object alignment of various meshes that were leaving gaps.\r\n-Filled holes in cell near and around entrance\r\n-Visually reworked the interior to give it a more \\\"cave-like\\\" feel\r\n-Added various visual effects.\r\n- Please note that the bookshelf is still dysfunctional.\r\n1.2\r\n-More alignment and clipping fixes.\r\n-WORKING BOOKCASES! :D\r\n-Brand new entrance. Same location.\r\n-Tweaks to the roots.",
