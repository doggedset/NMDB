  "descriptionHtml": "Hello guys&#33;\r<br />\r<br />At first I have to sorry for any language mistakes I made in description ;)\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][color=#ff0000]Mod requires the latest version of Skyrim and Dawnguard of course.\r<br />[/color][/i][/b][color=#ff0000]For now it doesn&#39;t require to have DG finished. I&#39;ll change it one day&#33;Â [/color]\r<br />\r<br />Ok, so after trying a few mods that should give player power to toggle the Eclipse I was quite angry when none of them worked properly. After that I made my own that finally does what it had to - allow player end the Thyrany of the Sun or bring sun back whenever he wants to.\r<br />\r<br />For now mod just adds a spellbook with a lesser power near the Harkon&#39;s coffin. Use the power during the sunny (or cloudy, lol) day and you&#39;ll have a beautiful Eclipse. Use it when Eclipse is on the sky and it&#39;ll end it. Mod offers Eclipse with all its visual effects, removing sun weaknesses and making vampire attacks - in mechanic it works exactly as Auriel&#39;s Bow.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ll improve my mod by adding some lore-friendly stuff like quest or something (and better description ^^) if I see people are interested in this mod. So any feedback or reported bugs would be nice.\r<br />\r<br />So, hope you enjoy it and let the darkness rule the world&#33; ;]\r<br />\r<br />P.S.\r<br />You can cast it in interiors and everything will be ok. I am not sure how it will work when cast between 7 PM and 6 AM.",
