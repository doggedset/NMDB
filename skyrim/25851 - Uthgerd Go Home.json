  "descriptionHtml": "As some of you have no doubt noticed, Uthgerd very much likes the Bannered Mare. So much in fact, that she forsakes her own home in favour of permanently anchoring herself to that chair in the corner. Convenient for the player who wishes to have constant access to her as a companion? Yes.  A bit weird? In my opinion, also yes, as it means she never enters her own house, and also never sleeps. With this file, she now returns home late in the evening to sleep, and then returns to her favourite chair in the morning to wile away the day.\r\n\r\nCompatibility: If your mod alters Uthgerd in anyway, you may get some oddness. Feel free to report any issues, and I\\'ll take a look if I can.",
