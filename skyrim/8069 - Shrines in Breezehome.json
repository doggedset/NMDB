  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a shrine of each divine separately to the upper floor of Breezehome, for those who would like to pray to them. Started out as a personal little mod I made while trying out the CK :)\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nExtract the plugin of your choice and activate it. Note that not all can be used at the same time as the shrines are placed in the exact same location. Should be compatible with mods that changes the interior, except it wont look good if said mod moves/removes the dresser the shrine is standing on.\r\n\r\nPS. I use the mod Anti-Idle Skyrim to make my spouse appear to pray in the screenshot.\r\n",
