  "summary": "Makes the Vampire Lord\\'s raise dead spell much more effective and fun to use.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes the raise dead spell for Vampire Lord\\'s. The changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n-Raised level cap of reanimation to 125, so basically anything\r\n-Spell now has an area effect of 150 feet\r\n-It will raise all the undead within that range, for one minute\r\n-Spell cost gone up to compensate for changes, now 200 instead of 50\r\n\r\n[youtube]OpydFRi5vus[/youtube]\r\n\r\nThe spell now is meant to be used as quick support during combat. The undead do not last very long, so they are useless as companions. The point is to make the Vampire Lord feel more like the master of death (being immortal, undead and all). This makes fighting large groups of mobs more easy, as you can whittle away some of their forces, and then raise a bunch of them to help you fight.\r\n\r\nHowever, for this mod to work, you must get the perk called \\\"Vampire Necromancy\\\", it is in the Vampire Lord perk tree, you can see it in the images. Without this perk, you cannot raise multiple undead, and will probably be limited to one or two instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nJust plop it in your data folder, or use the manager.\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\nIncompatible with anything that changes the Vampire Lord\\'s raise dead spell. If you are using a mod which alters the Vampire Lord skill tree, just load my mod after that mod and then:\r\n\r\nJust open up your console, and type: \r\n\r\nhelp \\\"Vampire Necromancy\\\"\r\n\r\nWith the quotes, and find the code associoated with it, and then type:\r\n\r\nplayer.addperkXXXXXXXX\r\n\r\nWhere XXXXXXX is the code I asked you to find.",
