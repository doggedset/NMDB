  "descriptionHtml": "This is the first verion of my first mod :P\r\n\r\nI m going to make version that is going to use one light armor set (suggestions on what set should I use thinking dragonscale) and not taking parts from different sets of game.\r\n\r\nHere is weapon for this mod now :) http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3037\r\n\r\n!!NOW WITH FEMALE AND MALE VERSION TOO :D!!\r\n\r\nAnyways hope you like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling:\r\nTextures go to data folder and it should put all the things to right places :) Read: Read Me! for more info... \r\n\r\nShould work with Nexus Mod Manager... (Newest version 1.2 may have some problems as it has esp file on it and it should go to data don\\'t know :/ )\r\n\r\nIf you find any problems feel free to ask me for help :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW criticism is welcome so if you have any ideas about this mods future or some wishes about me making one feel free to add on comments also if you like the mod be sure to endorse :)\r\n\r\nPictures of your nice moments using armor are also welcomed ^^\r\n\r\nHave done really much work for this mod already, so if you like this then endorse or comment to comments about your future needs or just come to say thanks ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersions\r\n\r\n1.0 works fine (OLD FILE)\r\n\r\n!!REPLACES!! Nightingale armor hood Dragonscale armors gloves and boots replaces mage ADEPT robes. Gonna do in future so that it replaces only one light armor set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1 Same as 1.0 just adds female version to game also :) (Old File)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2 (Main File) Is ready however fixing that it won\\'t anymore use original items such as nightingales hood are not done yet they are going to be on version 1.3 that will be last actual uptade then there will be optional files for those who want to use mage perks armor :) \r\n\r\nSo 1.2 still recolors all the old parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3 (Future) is going to take awhile cos I want now to play the game a bit more and not hassle all the time with this mod :P \r\n\r\nVersion 1.3 will not be using anymore old items as I said and only replaces dragonscale armor or some mage clothes that does not have armor on it...\r\n\r\n\r\n",
