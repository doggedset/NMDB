  "descriptionHtml": "[b]1) WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO EXACTLY?[/b]\n<br />\"Purity - Mist Return\" reduces the Distant fog value (both near &amp; far) from the most [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65242]PURITY[/url] weathers, to match vanilla levels. The visual result is a more evident dintant fog (see pictures). Those weathers with similar values between vanilla and Purity were not edited...\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]2) WHY MODIFY PURITY? IT'S GOOD AS IS...[/b]\n<br />I made this mod for personal use for two main reasons:\n<br />\n<br />First, I think the fog does a great job creating a cold atmosphere, even on the clearest days, and I like the visual effect it gives.\n<br />\n<br />Second and most important, a closer fog allows to disguise the ugly LOD textures even with mods that help a lot in this aspect (see pics).\n<br />I like how [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65242]PURITY[/url] transforms skyrim from a grayish thing to a vibrant and colorful world, and best of all, without loss of FPS. However, I also noticed immediately that the ugly LOD textures become more evident (an usual issue of all visuals and enviroments overhauls).\n<br />\n<br />Also, if you have a midrange PC like me, which does not allow you to raise the \"Ugridstoload\" (cells that the game loads) or install ultra High resolution Lod textures, without your a FPS drops below 30 on wodden areas, maybe this mod may interest you ...\n<br />\n<br />you can also use medium resolution mods to improve the LOD textures like:\n<br />-[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17984]Detailed Terrain and Tree LoD[/url]\n<br />-[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77130]LaBeats unobtrusive tree LODs for enb\n<br />[/url]\n<br />Installation:\n<br />Use your favorite Mod Manager and put after \"Purity\".\n<br />\n<br />Uninstallation:\n<br />Just delete the mod with no risks.
