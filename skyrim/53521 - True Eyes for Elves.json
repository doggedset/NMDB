  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very simple mod that applies jimtownirish&#39;s excellent TrueEyes mod to all three Elven races. Requires TrueEyes. The eye textures themselves are not altered--as you can see from the MS-Paint-ified banner, I&#39;m not much of an artist--the only difference is you can now select them for Elves as well as Humans.\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=red]Download TrueEyes [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49963/?]HERE[/url][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />I originally made this partly for my own use, and partly as a learning exercise for myself. I noticed a few people on the TrueEyes page had requested something like this, so I decided to upload it in case others might find it useful.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Incompatibilities:[/color]\r<br />None that I know of. In theory this should be compatible with basically anything--it modifies no existing records, it only adds some new eye options. It&#39;s certainly going to be compatible with anything TrueEyes is compatible with.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Installation:[/color]\r<br />Just put the file in your Skyrim data folder, or use NMM. Make sure you also install TrueEyes.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Load Order:[/color]\r<br />You might as well put it right after TrueEyes.esp, but it should probably work anywhere. Use BOSS or LOOT if you aren&#39;t sure where TrueEyes.esp should go.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Also Recommended:[/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50307/?]True Brows[/url] by JimtownIrish\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24273/?]Ethereal Elven Overhaul[/url] by nuska\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]RaceMenu[/url] by Expired\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36925/?]CharGen Extension[/url] by Expired (add morphs)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12951/?]Enhanced Character Edit[/url] by ECE team (alternative to RaceMenu & CharGen morphs)\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Credits:[/color]\r<br />jimtownirish, for creating TrueEyes and for his kind permission to post this. Any errors or omissions in this mod are entirely my own.\r<br />\r<br />Also thanks to Mator, whose [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49373/?]Automation Tools for TES5Edit[/url] was indispensable in making this.",
