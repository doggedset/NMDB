  "descriptionHtml": "[size=7][color=yellow] Dawnguard is required.[/color][/size]\r\n[size=7][color=yellow] [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18340/?] General Stores [/url] is required.[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[color=red]As of version 1.3...[/color] Inorder to attain the house you must find any of four the \\\"Blood court Keys\\\" that are hidden in dungeons that relate to vampires. These locations are listed below under \\\"KEY LOCATIONS\\\". They can be tough to spot and there\\'s no quest associated with them so keep sharp!\r\n\r\n[size=7][color=red]Description[/color][/size]\r\n  Necessity is the mother of invention, and since I was dissatisfied with most of the vampire homes out there I found my self needing to make my own.  As per my previous home mods I wanted this one to be predominantly underground and more or less hidden from public view. I really didn\\'t want a big dark scary castle that would scream to people, \\\"HEY! Some pretty evil dudes live in here. Better steer clear so you don\\'t get eaten!\\\" Because that would probably cramp my dinner plans. Breakfast was also a challenge; I\\'d get home at dawn to unload and rest up but come morning I\\'d wake up blood starved with no one around to feed off of since I\\'ve used [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15524] AFT [/url] to convert them all into vampires. This is especially a problem if you use [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24222] Vampiric Thirst [/url] or another mod like it. Last but not least I knew there were some really great resources in the Dawnguard DLC that I could use to really sell the blood sucking nature of this den of undead.\r\n\r\n  So with all this in mind I set out to build a new cave home centered around the idea of the vampiric consumption of blood, and I really do mean \\'around.\\' The layout is roughly circular with a central dining room which includes a round table with a pit in the center. The idea is once you\\'ve sucked the victim dry and stripped the flesh off their bones you pitch whats left over into the pit. To prepare your food there\\'s a kitchen with a particularly gruesome oven in which there are some slightly over cooked people. Additional features are an alchemy lab, human cattle pens (with thralls inside!), a master bedroom (or \\'coffin room\\' if you please) with a fire place, common room with six coffins and two beds, an alter to Molag Bal but modified for the Dovakhiin, and an entrance with spike and fire traps that are activated by the pull of a chain and press of the button. There\\'s also a hidden button in the entrance tunnel that opens the spike barriers. Outside in the tower is all the basic crafting stations and a panoramic view. Through out the whole thing I\\'ve scattered access points for Harvey2112\\'s General Stores Cloud storage. \r\n\r\nI hope you like it! \r\n\r\n[size=7][color=red]Detailed List[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nINDOORS\r\n\r\n-Kitchen\r\n     +Cooking Spit\r\n     +Pantry Crates (GS)\r\n     +Custom oven (mostly for show)\r\n\r\n-Dining Room\r\n     +8 chairs around Dining table and pit\r\n     +Lots of Blood potions\r\n     +2 thrall feast activators\r\n     +10 weapon racks\r\n     +3 mannequins\r\n     +1 weapon display case\r\n     +2 dagger display cases\r\n     +Weapon storage activators (GS)\r\n     +1 generic Bookshelf\r\n     +1 book storage activator (GS)\r\n     +1 scroll storage activator (GS\r\n     +Armor storage activators (GS)\r\n     +2 enchanting stations\r\n     +1 soulgem storage activator (GS)\r\n     -2 metal cages with thralls in each (key on mantle in bedroom)\r\n\r\n-Alchemy Lab\r\n     +A lot of common plants and fungus\r\n     ingredient storage activator (GS)\r\n     +Potion storage activator (GS)\r\n     +Alchemy station\r\n\r\n-Bedroom\r\n     +1 key for the whole home\r\n     +1 master storage chest\r\n     +1 book storage activator (GS)\r\n     +1 scroll storage activator (GS)\r\n     +1 dagger display race\r\n     +1 shield mount\r\n     +1 coffin\r\n\r\n-Common Bedroom\r\n     +Follower equipment storage chest (GS)\r\n     +6 coffins\r\n     +2 beds\r\n     +3 benches\r\n     +Modified altar to Molag Bal (mostly for show)\r\n\r\n-Front Entrance\r\n     +Spike fence activated by generic button and hidden button\r\n     +Flame trap activated by generic pull chain.\r\n     +Unburden fountain\r\n\r\nOUTSIDE\r\n     +Seperate map marker for convenient fast travel\r\n     +Forge\r\n     +Smithing storage activator (GS)\r\n     +Smelter\r\n     +Smelting storage activator (GS)\r\n     +Tanning rack\r\n     +Taning storage activator (GS)\r\n     +Worktable\r\n     +Sharpenning wheel\r\n     +General crafting storage activator (GS)\r\n     +General weapons storage activator (GS)\r\n     +General armor storage activator (GS)\r\n\r\nKEY LOCATIONS [COLOR=RED](SPOILERS!)[/COLOR]\r\n[spoiler]\r\n     Dimhollow Crypt - Just before the room with the word wall.
