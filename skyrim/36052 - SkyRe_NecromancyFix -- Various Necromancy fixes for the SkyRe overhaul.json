  "summary": "Fixes to various issues with SkyRe\\'s Necromancy subtree in Conjuration.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is simply a fan-made fix to a few problems found in the Necromancy subsection of the Conjuration tree found in T3nd0\\'s SkyRe overhaul. [b]So be sure to thank him for all of this, not a dinky modder like me![/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Fixes[/b]\r\n\r\n1. Summoned skeletons will no longer be hostile to everything. They will function as a proper companion/summon.\r\n\r\n2. Reduced the frequency that skeletons will bug and refuse to transfer through loading screens with you (let me know where you noticed this happening and if a newly summoned skeleton experienced the same problem)\r\n\r\n3. Harvesting bodies now causes them to leave behind an ash pile containing all of their loot.\r\n\r\n4. Mark of Decay has been modified to no longer spawn a worthless Draugr that cat slaps all of your enemies. Targets that die while under the affect of Mark of Decay are now instantly resurrected as a permanent minion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]To Come[/b]\r\n\r\nAs I play more and find more issues I\\'ll fix them and post them the best I can. I\\'m a novice at Papyrus/SCK, but I do pride myself on fixing anything to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\n\r\nMake sure the SkyRe_NecromancyFix comes after the main file in the load order. Other than that, it\\'s a typical install.",
