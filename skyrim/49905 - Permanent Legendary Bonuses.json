  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/XW3TuJy.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Looking for a Skyrim SE version? [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12743/?] Find it here[/url], converted and supported by [/size][size=4][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5040332]Nekoyoubi[/url]&#33;\r<br />[/size][/center]\r<br />[heading]About[/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Since its introduction, the &#34;Legendary&#34; skill system sounded like a cool idea, but was missing something: incentive.  It&#39;s great to have the ability to make a skill legendary, continue to level it, and receive extra perks/health/etc. but it feels like the legendary skill itself should receive some kind of small perk or bonus.\r<br />\r<br />As of right now, the most efficient way to grind levels beyond 85 is to constantly reset smithing, alchemy, and enchanting.  With a small, additive bonus given to skills as their &#34;legendary level&#34; increases, it becomes beneficial in the long-term to reset the skills you use most often (combat skills, armor, etc.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading]What this mod does[/heading]\r<br />\r<br />This mod rewards players making a skill &#34;Legendary&#34; by providing that skill with a small, permanent bonus.  The bonus will increase for each additional time you make the corresponding skill legendary.\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]After a skill has been made legendary, you will receive a passive ability that grants a 5-point bonus to that skill.\r<br />[*]The bonus will increase by 5 points for every subsequent legendary level\r<br />[*]You can view the bonus under your &#34;Active Effects&#34; tab in the Magic menu\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />All of the magic effects are called [b]Legendary *Skill Name*[/b], so they should group together in the menus and be easy to notice.\r<br />\r<br />The bonus will also be visible (green &#34;level&#34; number) [u]the next time you open the skills menu[/u] (star sign menu).\r<br />\r<br />The bonus will increase by 5 for every subsequent time that skill is made legendary.  There is no limit to how high the bonus can be increased, but I believe the game stops counting skill bonuses once they reach 199.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Requirements[/heading]\r<br />[color=red][b]You MUST have SKSE v 1.6.16 to use this mod[/b][/color]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][url=http://skse.silverlock.org]Download SKSE[/url]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTGnQIiNVqA]SKSE installation help video[/url]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Installation and Removal[/heading]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Installation[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Download and activate with the NMM [color=red][b](Need testing)[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[u]Manual Install[/u]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Download the main file from the files section\r<br />[*]Unpack to your Skyrim/Data directory. If asked to overwrite, say yes.\r<br />[*]Activate the .esp\r<br />[*]Load any saved game and play\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: The file  &#34;/data/scripts/source/LegendaryBonus.psc&#34; is only necessary for modders, and can be removed, if you so choose.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you load a game that already has legendary skills, you will receive the bonuses immediately.  They are added silently, so check your active effects.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Uninstall[/u][/b]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Open the console and type: [b]StopQuest LegendaryBonus[/b]\r<br />[*]Create a new save\r<br />[*]Exit Skyrim, and deselect &#34;LegendaryBonus.esp&#34; or unistall via NMM\r<br />[*]Load your latest saved game\r<br />[*]Create another new save in a new slot ([u]not a quicksave&#33;[/u])\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />This is now your &#34;clean&#34; save.  All previous saves should be considered &#34;dirty.&#34;  The scripts don&#39;t run constantly, and they only create a couple of small variables, so it&#39;s probably not even a big deal.  However, in the interest of best practices, you should follow the steps above.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Compatibility[/heading]\r<br />\r<br />This mod should be compatible with any mod, as long as it does not overwrite the &#34;Spells.pex&#34; script from [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Mods that make significant changes to the Legendary system, such as the Skyrim Community Uncapper, should be compatible, but the benefits of this mod would be redundant.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Known Bugs/Issues[/u][/b]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]On slower systems with high script latency, entering the skills menu and IMMEDIATELY exiting it (before all of the graphics load) can prevent the bonus abilities from being added.  [i]This is fixed by opening the skills menu again, staying on the menu for 1 second, and then exiting the skills menu.[/i]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[heading]How it Works[/heading]\r<br />An invisible reference alias quest is added to the player, which attaches a script.  Whenever the player closes the [b]Skills Menu[/b] (the menu with the star signs), the script checks to see if any skills are legendary, adds up their appropriate bonus, and applies the bonus effect to the player.\r<br />\r<br />[b]For anyone that thinks all scripts are evil[/b] - In general, I agree with you&#33;  Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way to do this without a script.  This one is small, doesn&#39;t run constantly, and doesn&#39;t create hundreds of variables to get stuck in your save files.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Credits[/heading]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/3172350-davidegzz]davidegzz[/url] for the original idea in [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/1001068-small-permanent-skill-bonus-when-making-a-skill-legendary]this thread[/url]\r<br />[*][url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/5910982-grimybunyip]grimybunyip[/url] and his [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33395]SkyTweak[/url] mod for the proof-of-concept\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Change Log[/heading]\r<br />[b]v 0.09 BETA[/b]\r<br />Initial BETA release",
