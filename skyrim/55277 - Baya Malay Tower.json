  "descriptionHtml": "This dungeon mod introduces Baya Malay Tower to the world of Skyrim&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffe599][size=4]WHAT IS BAYA MALAY TOWER?[/size][/color] \r<br />\r<br />Baya Malay Tower is the much beloved (ahem) dungeon from the first game in Sega’s Phantasy Star series that leads to the climax of that game.\r<br />\r<br />The Tower contains eight floors (five levels and three basement levels), along with . . . well, I won’t tell you, but Phantasy Star fans will know what’s at the top.\r<br />\r<br />It’s a non-lore friendly, Dwemer-themed dungeon. However, it doesn’t seem much like a “theme.” I have gone for “nostalgia” over “aesthetics.” The layout is based on the Generation I remake on the PlayStation 2 versus the original on the Sega Master System. There are very slight changes to the layout, but most maps should be usable, if you want to use them.\r<br />\r<br />The suggested level for this mod is 40 or higher.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff0000][size=3]NEW FOR VERSION 1.5&#33;[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Guaron Morgue has been added to the mod as a bonus dungeon.  It has two floors, and has many zombies.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffe599][size=4]WHERE IS IT?[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />+ The entrance to the Tower is located near Anise’s Cabin (west of Riverwood), in the mountains, and has its own map marker.\r<br />\r<br />+ The entrance to the Morgue is located near the Skytemple Ruins (in the northeast of the map, in the snowy region) and has its own map marker.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffe599][size=4]REQUIREMENTS[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />None&#33; No other mods are required, as this one uses vanilla resources.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffe599][size=4]INSTALLATION[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your Skyrim Data folder.\r<br />2. Make sure PhantasyStar.esp is checked in the game launcher menu (Data Files).\r<br />3. Star playing&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffe599][size=4]UNINSTALLATION[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1. Uncheck PhantasyStar.esp in the game launcher menu.\r<br />2. Delete PhantasyStar.esp from your Data folder.\r<br />3. Delete the following files from the MUSIC folder in your Data folder: MUSCrossPain.xwm, MUSLostShrine.xwm, MUSProphet.xwm.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffe599][size=4]THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This is my first public Skyrim mod, and I think it is a valiant first effort into Skyrim modding. It’s hardly perfect, and there are some issues that still need to be addressed, but the mod is complete enough to release for fans to download.\r<br />\r<br />Once again, this mod favors “nostalgia” over “aesthetics,” which means there is very little clutter, and long passages. You could probably snipe some of the enemies from far away. I didn’t create the layout for the Tower; blame it on the original designers.\r<br />\r<br />Some changes have been made to the original scenario, but if you proceed through the Tower, you will find all the items you need to complete the entire mod. Items from chests became their approximate Skyrim counterparts, when possible.\r<br />\r<br />If it’s too hard, easy, etc., I welcome constructive criticism. Remember, the keyword there is &#34;constructive.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />I’d be interested in reviews, videos and playthroughs from Phantasy Star players and non-Phantasy Star players alike.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffe599][size=4]CREDITS[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />+ Bethesda, of course, for the amazing game called Skyrim.\r<br />+ Sega, for the creation of Phantasy Star, and remains their copyright, trademark, etc. This is a fan-created mod, and is intended only as a friendly homage to the series.\r<br />+ There are three music tracks used from free music sites:\r<br />Cross Pain by Foceal (http://sound.jp/foceal/)\r<br />Prophet by Cyber-Rainforce (http://www.cyber-rainforce.net)\r<br />Lost Shrine by Cyber-Rainforce\r<br />\r<br />* NOTE: The equipment featured on the characters in the screenshots is not included in this mod. The keyblades are featured elsewhere on Steam and the Nexus, so pick them up&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffe599][size=4]GOALS&#33;[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />+ Alis Landale (It is looking unlikely, however.)\r<br />\r<br />I welcome other suggestions. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffe599][size=4]UPDATE HISTORY[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />v1.5\r<br />+ Second release\r<br />+ Added missing default map marker for Baya Malay Tower if not yet discovered\r<br />+ Added the Guaron Morgue dungeon\r<br />+ Added Laconian equipment (Laconian Sword, Laconian Axe, Laconian Armor, Laconian Shield, Laconian Gauntlets, Laconian Boots), and have been spread across chests in both Baya Malay Tower and Guaron Morgue\r<br />+ Chests for non-key items now respawn (including ones with Laconian equipment)\r<br />\r<br />v1.0\r<br />+ Initial Release",
