  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://static-7.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/56679-1-1424901016.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-7.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/56679-2-1424901016.png[/img][/center][center]\r<br />This is a simple mod that adds craftable and purchasable silver arrows and bolts to the game.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/56679-1-1424901473.png[/img]\r<br />They have the same base damage as steel arrows & bolts but they do +20 damage to undead (draugr,ghosts,vampires,bonemen,wisp,dragon priest etc) and werebeasts (werewolves and werebears).\r<br />\r<br />They can be crafted at any forge (for now :P Dawnguard reqiurement is on the way). \r<br />Steel Smithing Perk is required for crafting. A silver ingot and a firewood yield 24 arrows or 10 bolts. \r<br />\r<br />Merchants those sell arrows now sell silver arrows, merchants those sell bolts (there are only two: Gunmar and Sorine) now sell silver bolts.\r<br />\r<br />Silverhand archers carry silver arrows and and Dawnguard archers carry silver bolts.\r<br />\r<br />Unfortunatelly, in Skyrim, Vigilants of Stendarr do not use bows and crossbows therefore no silver arrows/bolts added to them.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The meshes, textures and other stuff are from Sunhallowed arrows and steel bolts from Dawnguard DLC. Sunhallowed arrows seemed more closer to bright/burning/blessed to me. Until I find or create better ones, they are what I got.  I have plans to add retextures of some existent arrows and bolts to look like silvermade, thanks to a friend :D[/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/56679-2-1424901473.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Best to use Nexus Mod Manager.\r<br /> Download it and then activate it. Endorse it, if you like :D\r<br />\r<br />I haven&#39;t test it yet but for now it is best to use it with Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLCs.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/56679-4-1424901473.png[/img][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*] [/list][list]To add some kind of Dawnguard Faction/Quest requirement for crafting(ON THE WAY)[/list][list][*]I am thinking about to change the look of silver arrow to nordic arrows, what do you think? Please leave a comment[/list][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/56679-3-1424901473.png[/img]\r<br />If the arrows (and bolts) hit walls,grounds and other static objects  (but not enemies/npcs) they disappear. From what I&#39;ve learn this is due to the way I enchant the arrows. I will be looking for a solution.\r<br />If another undead/werebeast is very very close to the target, it may take the extra damage from the enchanment. Again, this is due to the way I enchant the arrows. I will be looking for a solution.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This my first mod. I always wanted silver arrows and bolts to deal with vampires, werewolves, ghosts, draugr and other &#34;dark-side&#34; creatures. Switching equipment according to enemy... Just like Witcher games, just like Supernatural (TV series)... There are couple of silver arrow mods but I did not like them so I made one. It is mainly for role-playing purposes. \r<br />\r<br />English is not my mother language, please forgive my mistakes.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I will be updating\r<br />[center]\r<br />[img]http://static-7.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/56679-1-1424901016.png[/img][/center]",
