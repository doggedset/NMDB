  "descriptionHtml": "So like most mods, people often find themselves typing down codes and also starting as a new race. So in this mod however the player has access to new perks in the Vampire Lord tree and the Werewolf tree. So now there will be new perks allowing the player to get the Vampire Lord power and the beast form power. However I must credit bugmenotvers2 because I got the idea of the new power from him. So there is a new power called Hybrid Lord which is for the main werewolf power that allows you to be a werewolf wherever you want.\r<br />\r<br />To Do List:\r<br />Make Hybrid Perks compatible with the royal bloodline perk tree by xyks. However do tell me if there is any others you might want me to make it compatible with.",
