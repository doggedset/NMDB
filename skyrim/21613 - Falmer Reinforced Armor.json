  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=red]-Updated to V2-\r\n-Corrected Crafting Recipe-[/color][/center]\r\n\r\n---Lore---\r\n\r\nWith the rise of Dawnguard we received access to hidden Falmer armor worn by their strongest soldiers. These crudely crafted pieces of armor are highly resilient to damage but weight alot due to their construction and materials. Upon gaining access to this Skyrims blacksmiths have found a way to reinforce this armor, reducing the weight but also reducing its armor value. Still it is a strong piece of armor and more lightweight then the original.\r\n\r\n---Accessing The Armor---\r\n\r\nFirst of all you must get your hands on some of the original Hardened Armor, beware, the Falmer are more vicious then ever now.\r\nWhen you have gotten your hands on this armor bring it to any forge along with some extra crafting material (Leather Strips) and you will be able to hollow out and recraft the armor to make it lightweight.\r\n\r\nIt has an armor value equal to Scaled armor. It is fully temperable with a single Chitin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a Dawnguard Vanilla armor so of course you need Dawnguard to access it. It wont effect the ingame item because its standalone.\r\n\r\nIf you like this mod maybe you\\'ll also enjoy the HQ Recolor I also made.\r\nHQ Recolor Falmer Armor (Version 2 now available)",
