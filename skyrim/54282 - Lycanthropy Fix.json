  "summary": "Changes Basic effects of becoming a werewolf in human form.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Just a small mod that changes the effects from getting the &#34;Beast Blood&#34;, I always felt that when in human (or Mer) form you should have gotten at least a few perks for being a werewolf. This is my way of solving that.\r<br />\r<br />An increase to Health + 50 and Stamina +100. \r<br />As well as an increase to regeneration.\r<br />An increased carry weight +100.\r<br />\r<br />I also changed the werewolf health and stamina by just a smidgin. Instead of the +50 to Heath, and the +100 to Stamina to start with, I bumped them up to +100 and +150 respectively. Hopefully that still keeps it slightly balanced.\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY\r<br />\r<br />I only changed two records in the CK, the &#34;ABWEREWOLF&#34; and the &#34;WEREWOLFIMMUNITY&#34;. If it changes that then this won&#39;t work. Both of these only deal with the Health and Stamina, and the disease resistance. Nothing in the PERKS themselves has been changed. Otherwise, I would place it after any werewolf mods you have, just to be on the safe side.\r<br />\r<br />If you already have BEAST FORM in your spell list, then you may need to remove it, then add it back, If the effects aren&#39;t showing up. Most werewolf mods have a way to &#34;cure&#34; yourself, and then give it back. Or you can use the console to do it.\r<br />\r<br />Thank you all who have checked this out. Its my first mod so feel free to be critical. Only way I&#39;ll learn.",
