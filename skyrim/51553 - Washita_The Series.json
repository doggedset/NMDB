Bethesda has allowed me the opportunity to do something I enjoy. For that I am grateful. Thank you. It&#39;s been work changing over from Oblivion to Skyrim, but it&#39;s been fun even though my disability interferes from time to time. The sad part is that it&#39;s done, so I&#39;m considering continuing it on another level on a single .esp.\r<br />______________________________________________________________________________\r<br />Disclaimer:\r<br />-This free to play work comes as-is without any guarantee.
