  "summary": "A house located within the town of Falkreath at the main entrance.  Not your typical home.",
  "descriptionHtml": "*Update* 12/14/2012\r\nCreated a stand-alone version that doesn\\'t include the \\\"annoying follwer Bella\\\".  I am not sure what I did, but no matter what she won\\'t leave the player alone.  So I fixed that.  Bye bye Bella babe =)\r\nI already have a new location.  Just dressing it up and adding those special touches.  Will be releasing a new file soon!\r\n\r\n*Update* 12/10/2012\r\nI have updated the file to download. I replaced the snow covered home and mound with a non-snow version!  Special thanks to (acidzebra) for helping me with this.  I also updated every screenshot.  So now what you see, is what you get.  I\\'ve added a usable bookshelf to the main living area and a potion storage shelf near the potions table in the cellar.  I\\'ve also added a map maker.  Just delete the old file and install the new.  Don\\'t copy over old file, that doesn\\'t seem to work well.\r\n\r\nFast travel type: ~coc FWH (FalkreathWelcomeHome)\r\n\r\nHello and thanks for looking at my Falkreath home. This is probably unlike any player home before.  This home is situated atop a dragon burial mound.  It has two lit torches guiding your way to the entrance and plenty of charm.  It comes complete with access to the cellar via a well.  \r\n\r\nThis home has many little details that make it special.  Inside the cellar you\\'ll find cells, a complete weapons smithing, enchanting, and potions area.  And there you will find every container you could ever desire.  Fully labeled according to what should be stored there.  Also, there is a \\\"special room\\\" that can be accessed from inside the home or via the well outside.  This room allows one to travel to all of Skyrim\\'s \\\"most fun places\\\"!  There\\'s also your very own personal wench/follower just begging to tag along.  Pssst... she looks a lot like Muiri!  I dressed her nude so that way she has no default clothes and wears whatever you want her to ;)\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s the worst that could happen?  You tell me, so try it out.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nMUST READ:\r\nThis mod does change the town of Falkreath.  It switches the location of the Goods store and deletes the guard\\'s barracks.  This home sits now where the Goods store was, and the Goods store is now where the barracks used to be.  So you should probably LOAD this AFTER any village enhancement and or Falkreath enhancement mods.  ;)\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nRecommended Mods:\r\nRealistic Lighting Patcher - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7654\r\nSLOD Potions - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4259\r\nSLOD Wine Cellar - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4260\r\nCeltic and Braided Rugs - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7274\r\n\r\nP.S. Read the letter you find once you enter the home.  The rest I\\'m sure you\\'ll figure out on your own.  \r\n\r\n*Thanks to Mr.Biggengaming (Video Guy)",
