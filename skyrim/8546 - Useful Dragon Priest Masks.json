  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple mod that changes all of the Dragon Priest masks to be either light, heavy, or no  armor. I was bugged that Nahkriin, despite being mainly useful for mages, was heavy armor. So I changed it, along with all the other masks. I also fixed the Morokei bug, it now has a 20% Shout Recharge buff, along with the 100% magicka regen. \r\n\r\nNote I did not change any weights or armor values- this is purely a categorization change. \r\n\r\n*INSTALL*\r\nJust drop Useful Dragon Priest Masks- Light.esp, Useful Dragon Priest Masks- Heavy.esp, or Useful Dragon Priest Masks- Mage.esp into your Skyrim/data directory, and activate it in either NMM or the Skyrim launcher. It should be obvious you do not want more than one activated at the same time. \r\n\r\n*BUGS*\r\nMorokei\\'s description only shows the 20% shout buff, but both effects are applied. I do not know why this is, or how to change it. ",
