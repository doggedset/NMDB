The style deviates from vanilla a bit, but I would still classify it as lore friendly. The goal has been to make a mix of metal and obsidian, with a touch of demonic style&#33; Let me know in the comments if you think I have succeeded or in general just want to provide a bit of feedback&#33; \r<br />\r<br />If you do have a super awesome idea on yet another alternative version then I am also all ears&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Q5ugNJD.png[/img][/center]\r<br />[/size]There are two different versions up. \r<br />The 4k version: \r<br />4k DXT5 compressed diffuse and normal map as well as a 1k DXT1 compressed reflection mask. \r<br />\r<br />The 2k version:\r<br />2k DXT5 compressed diffuse and normal map as well as a 1k DXT1 compressed reflection mask. \r<br />\r<br />I will not be uploading a 1k version since imo the amount of detail I have put in gets a bit too washed out.. especially the normal map will suffer quite a bit at lower resolutions. Also it is quite easy to get a program that can resize at the click of a button if you need it. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]TdffVlpuWuE[/youtube]\r<br />[size=5][center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Doyq7NC.png[/img][/center][/size]\r<br />It is simple textures and meshes use your mod manager to install and remove like any other. Folder structure should be correct&#33; \r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/mWIoZXq.png[/img][/center]\r<br />Bethesda for the game and all the goodies to play with&#33;\r<br />Sparrowprince for lots of help and suggestions\r<br />Mangaclub and Benhat for beta testing and providing feedback. \r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/2RezCmn.png[/img][/center]\r<br />If you want to use these assets in your own mod, please ask me first&#33; I will most likely agree it is the best idea since icecream&#33; \r<br />I do not give permission for these assets to be redistributed to other sites then the Nexus. ",
