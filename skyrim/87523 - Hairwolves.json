Use the MCM to add other werewolves to the system or change assigned fur color. Werewolf followers will transform when you do! \n<br />Random encounter werewolves should have a randomly selected fur color. \n<br />\n<br />Playing an Argonian, or using a mod that gives your character a non-vanilla hair color? You can still manually select the werewolf color of your choice in the MCM.",
