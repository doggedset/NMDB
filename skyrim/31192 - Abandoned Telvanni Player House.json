  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i899.photobucket.com/albums/ac192/AqPlanted/abtvhhdrrr.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n==================\r\n[color=#fafad2]Description:[/color]\r\n==================\r\n\r\nA quick Telvanni player house that I made so my mage can store his loot someplace safe. It is located in the Tel Mithryn area. I imagine there are/will be MUCH better Tel Mithryn house mods than this but I figured someone else may enjoy this quaint mod so here it is. :)\r\n\r\nIt has a decent amount of containers, a bed, an enchanting table, an alchemy table, and a small Ash Yam garden with a cooking area next to it.\r\n\r\nA bit of backstory is given in the form of a journal that is located on the bed.\r\n\r\nAll rooms in this house are located within the same cell. This allows the player to avoid any load screens. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ve optimized the cell so it should be no more demanding than if I made each room its own cell.\r\n\r\nIn v1.1: I\\'ve added a basement with weapons racks, mannequins, chests, a bookcase with three shelves to store your books on. v1.2 adds some crafting stations to this basement.\r\n\r\nIn v1.2: I\\'ve added a crafting anvil and tanning rack to the basement, and a little bit more clutter as well.\r\n\r\nIn v1.4: I\\'ve added a passageway to the basement that leads to a cavern that contains a peaceful pond, insects, moss, a shrine to Azura, and more.\r\n\r\nBefore updating from pre-v1.4 to v1.4 or higher: Please collect everything you set down in the living area of the house, else it will likely be gone - this excludes anything you placed in containers. Anything in the containers are safe, it just affects the items you dropped on the floor, shelves, etc. Once you have v1.4 installed, you can place all these items back where you want them as they\\'ll be fine. Also, please collect any items you placed in the two weapons racks and the display case, else they will be floating since I had to move the weapon racks and display case a bit (If you forget to do this, you can still pick up the floating items so it is not a big deal). Finally, I suggest leaving the house, saving, and then updating to v1.4. I apologize for any inconvenience.\r\n\r\nNote: It is not designed for followers and Bethesda barely navmeshed the area that this house is on, so followers will not follow you to the Ash Yams garden/etc. I didn\\'t touch the existing navmesh as I wanted to maintain as much compatibility as I can with upcoming mods.\r\n\r\n*Requires Dragonborn*\r\n\r\n\r\n==================\r\n[color=#fafad2]Incompatible:[/color]\r\n==================\r\n\r\nMay be incompatible with mods that modify the same area where the house is.\r\n\r\n\r\n==================\r\n[color=#fafad2]Changelog:[/color]\r\n==================\r\n\r\n2/19/2013 - v1.4.2 - Added some more atmosphere to the place.\r\n2/17/2013 - v1.4.1 - Added water lilies to the pond.\r\n2/17/2013 - v1.4 - Added a passageway to the basement that leads to a cavern that contains a peaceful pond, insects, moss, a shrine to Azura, and more.\r\n2/14/2013 - v1.3 - Added some more containers (sacks) and fixed the weapon rack.\r\n2/9/2013 - v1.2 - Added a crafting anvil and tanning rack to the basement, and a little bit more clutter as well.\r\n2/9/2013 - v1.1 - Added a basement with weapons racks, mannequins, chests, a bookcase with three shelves to store your books on.\r\n2/7/2013 - Initial Release\r\n\r\n\r\n==================\r\n[color=#fafad2]Contact Details:[/color]\r\n==================\r\n\r\nIf you run into any bugs or have any suggestions/comments, then either PM me here or leave them in the comments section.\r\n\r\n\r\n==================\r\n[color=#fafad2]Credits:[/color]\r\n==================\r\n\r\nA big thanks to:\r\nBethesda.\r\nelinen, Ztree, and everyone else who contributed to Hoddminir Water plants (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29486).\r\nEarrindo for the Telvanni Tower Resources pack (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34882).\r\nAnd InsanitySorrow for the ReadMe Generator this ReadMe is based on.\r\n\r\n==================\r\n[color=#fafad2]My Other Mods:[/color]\r\n==================\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25528][img]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o22/98LS1TA/25528-2-1350249669ac1s.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24933][img]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o22/98LS1TA/24933-1-1349229183fwm2s.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24920][img]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o22/98LS1TA/24920-1-1349206269sc1s.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28131][img]http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o22/98LS1TA/SnowboundAcres.jpg[/img][/url]",
