  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][b][u][center][color=#ff7700]Elegant Ladies for brave knights 2ce[/color][/center][/u][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Notice[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />This mod is the complementary edition of: \n<br />\n<br />[center][b][color=#ff7700][size=3]Elegant Ladies for brave knights 2[/size][/color][/b][/center]\n<br />&gt; You must install [b]“Elegant Ladies for brave knights 2”[/b] before installing this add-on;\n<br />&gt; This mod may operate without [b]“Elegant Ladies for brave knights 2”[/b], even though it is mainly intended to complement it;\n<br />&gt; This mod is aimed at adult players as it contains nudity.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Description [/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />For those who may be interested in taking their personal erotic pictures with the Ladies, this mod adds a naked version of Argis “the Bulwark”, the housecarl of Vlindrel Hall in Marcarth, with two bodies: normal and more muscular and two conditions: erect and at rest.\n<br />\n<br />I understand that if you are a male player you would prefer to love the Ladies by yourself, however you could always set a spicy threesome encounter and what if you prefer to “look”? Then this mod is ideal, you may have a seat and enjoy the show.\n<br />\n<br />If you are a female player, then this simple mod could be very handy and discreet to fulfil your hidden desires in the privacy of your house.\n<br />\n<br />Please note that for the time you’ll be using this mod you’ll have two Argis: the original one, dressed with his armour and this one naked. This is normal and they don’t interfere with each other.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Content[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />This mod is complete and includes all meshes and textures for a naked well-built version of Argis. If desired a more muscular version, but still very acceptable in terms of aesthetic is available, up to you the choice. See [b]Installation section[/b] for full details.\n<br />\n<br />&gt; Argis is intended to be used for photographic purposes only;\n<br />&gt; Argis is not a companion or a follower and will not initiate any follower dialogue, his main job is to \"assist\" the Ladies when they need his services. Separate animations/poses mod is required for that;\n<br />&gt; Argis cannot be killed;\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]AI (artificial intelligence) modules[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />Argis has a few AI functions. He has breakfast, lunch and dinner and he sits when the vampires Ladies use the Alchemy table, to not interfere with their activities. He doesn’t sleep and wanders in the Alchemy lab room waiting for you...\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]The body [/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />&gt; Argis is an interesting well-built man; \n<br />&gt; His body is rather hairy;\n<br />&gt; He is always excited or at rest, depending on the version you install;\n<br />&gt; He only wears an amulet of Kynareth.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Location - where is Argis?[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />Argis resides in [b]Vlindrel Hall[/b] in [b]Marcarth [/b]and, in particular, he wanders in the Alchemy lab room.\n<br />\n<br />If you move him elsewhere, via console commands, that's where he returns.\n<br />\n<br />[u]You must own this house first, completing related quests and become Thane of the Reach, before activating this mod (see [b]Prerequisites[/b] section).\n<br />[/u]\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Prerequisites[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />- You must own the house Vlindrel Hall in Marcarth first, completing related quests and become Thane of the Reach, before activating this mod;\n<br />- You must also have/purchase the [b]Alchemy lab[/b] room and NOT the children room (both use the same area).\n<br />- You should install [b]“Elegant Ladies for brave knights 2”[/b].\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Technical features[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />This mod is autonomous and does not need other mods.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Load order[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />Not critical, but should be loaded [u]after[/u] (below) [b]“Elegant Ladies for brave knights 2”[/b].\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />This mod is fully compatible with Dawnguard, Dragon born and Hearthfire Bethesda’s official add-ons.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Conflicts[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />None, except for: any mod that alters the interior of Vlindrel Hall such as:\n<br />Vindrel Hall TNF - Hearthfire\n<br />Vlindrel Hall Reborn\n<br />Nicer Vlindrel Hall\n<br />Vlindrel Hall TNF Beds Plus\n<br />Vlindrel Hall Overhaul\n<br />Markarth Vlindrel Hall Redecoration...\n<br />\n<br />and the like. There are about 16 mods that modify the interior of the house and will interfere with the actions and habits of Argis and with his AI modules. Most may also cause a failure of loading the game.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Installation[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />Installation is very simple and should be done manually. Only 2 or 3 files are needed.\n<br />You need [b]46 MB[/b] of free disk space to install this mod; [b]11 MB[/b] can be recovered at the end of installation.\n<br />\n<br />Two versions are available: [b]erect [/b]and [b]at rest[/b] and both have a skeleton file for a more muscular body. You can [u][b][color=#00ff00]install/use only one at a time[/color][/b][/u], but you certainly may download both versions.\n<br />\n<br />Please note that both versions' content ([b]F2ce818e.7z[/b] and [b]F2ce818r.7z[/b]) have identical file names on purpose, therefore if you decide to download the two versions, you must place the files in separate folders having a mnemonic names for you. In these folders you should also decompress the F2ce818.7z files (final [b]e[/b] or [b]r[/b]) so their contents are always available and ready for use.\n<br />\n<br />&gt; When you need to switch from one version to the other, simply copy the files from one folder or the other into ...[b]Skyrim&#92;Data[/b] overwriting existing files.\n<br />\n<br />&gt; In doing so there is [u]no need[/u] to run Skyrim launcher every time, nor deactivate/activate any mod. The system will not notice the change, but the content has actually changed according to your requirements.\n<br />\n<br />1 - Decompress the downloaded file F2ce818.7z in ... [b]Skyrim&#92;Data[/b] (i.e. where you find Skyrim - Meshes.bsa file);\n<br />You will find following three files:\n<br />[b]&gt; Fardosa2ce.bsa\n<br />&gt; Fardosa2ce.esp[/b]\n<br />[b]&gt; skeleton.nif [/b](this is only required if a more muscular version is desired);\n<br />\n<br />2 - First two files [b]Fardosa2ce.bsa[/b] and [b]Fardosa2ce.esp[/b] must stay where they are, i.e. in …[b]Skyrim&#92;Data[/b] folder;\n<br />\n<br />3 - The skeleton file [b]skeleton.nif[/b] must reside in …[b]Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;meshes&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;character assets[/b], but [u]DO NOT[/u] overwrite the skeleton file you already have, instead go to indicated folder and rename your current skeleton.nif as [b]skeleton.nif-org[/b] (original), so if you don’t like the more muscular version you can always restore the original one.\n<br />\n<br />4 - Move the downloaded [b]skeleton.nif[/b] to its destination folder;\n<br />&gt; Please note that for the time you’ll be using this skeleton all men will be more muscular, furthermore some (rare) clipping might occur with some “tight” armours. This is normal.\n<br />\n<br />Now you may delete the F2ce818.7z file (optional to save disk space);\n<br />\n<br />5 - Run Skyrim Launcher and activate (mark the check box) Fardosa2ce.esp (it should be already active anyway);\n<br />\n<br />6 - The priority (order of execution) is not critical and you can position Fardosa2ce.esp as you prefer with respect to other mods. In case of doubts it is recommended to put it after other mods, i.e. at the bottom of the list and [u]after[/u] Fardosa2.esp. \n<br />\n<br />7 - Close Skyrim Launcher;\n<br />\n<br />8 - Run Skyrim and play; do not forget to go to Vlindrel Hall in Markarth.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Uninstallation [/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />1 - Run Skyrim Launcher and deactivate Fardosa2ce.esp;\n<br />2 - Deleted from the folder...Skyrim&#92;Data these two files:\n<br />&gt; Fardosa2ce.bsa\n<br />&gt; Fardosa2ce.esp\n<br />3 - If you have installed the more muscular version, delete skeleton.nif from … Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;meshes&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;character assets and rename skeleton.nif-org to skeleton.nif;\n<br />4 - Load your last save and click on OK when notified that some content may be obsolete;\n<br />5 - Play a bit (without the mod) and make a new save in a separate file;\n<br />6 - Exit the game;\n<br />7 - Load this new save and save once again in another new file;\n<br />8 - When you want to play load this last new save.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Credits[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />Bethesda: for Skyrim game\n<br />Nexus: kindly hosting the modders’ community\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Objects/mods used for the pictures, but not included in this mod[/u][/b]\n<br />Fore: base animations\n<br />Halo’s poser: poses\n<br />Gomapero: poses\n<br />Kapaer: face expressions\n<br />Jaxonz: pose positioning\n<br />Elewin: navel piercing\n<br />Severus616: necklaces, diadems, circlets, earrings\n<br />Zonzai and Kalell and UKC: piercing\n<br />Electionis and jclyde6108: high heel shoes\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Objects used in the mod[/u][/b]\n<br />Chris57 and FavoredSoul: male body\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ffff][size=3]Permissions[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />- This mod and all its assets, including pictures, MUST reside here on Nexus only.
