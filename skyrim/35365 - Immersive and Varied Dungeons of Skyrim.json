  "summary": "Gets rid of the stomach turning hordes of Draugr found in the majority of Skyrim\\'s Dungeons and replaces them with a variety of different enemies.",
  "descriptionHtml": " [heading]What this mod does: [/heading]\r\nReplaces the Draugr in some of their crypts with a variety of soon-to-be lore-friendly creatures.\r\n\r\nEach dungeon will have a creature-type \\\"theme\\\" so that giving it a backstory will make more sense ITF.\r\n\r\n[heading]Important things to consider:[/heading]\r\nBringing at least one (essential) follower with you.\r\n\r\nChoosing the easy ESM:\r\n\r\nThis mod makes gameplay much harder. The normal version will require a dungeon raid-esque mindest to play through successfully. That means LOTS of preparing before you ever step foot in the dungeon and coming with multiple followers who\\'ve also been prepped. That is, stocking up on potions, getting a good set of armor and a good weapon, maybe grinding a little to level up your skills, making sure all of your followers are set to essential, and just generally doing anything else you can think of to prepare yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd even then, the \\\"Easy\\\" version is still pretty hard, and you\\'d be smart to do just a little prepping with it(maybe just stocking up on potions), too.\r\n\r\n[heading]What\\'s to come in future updates:[/heading]\r\nCreatures from Dragonborn and Dawnguard (with lore-friendly explanations for why they are there if neccessary). Because Skyrim deserves a few Werebears, at least.\r\n\r\nFully fleshed out back story for the majority of reworked dungeons and basic lore for all of them which also makes each dungeon lore and logic friendly (see Bleak Falls Barrow for an example)\r\n\r\nEnemy patrols to give the dungeons more life (and challenge).\r\n\r\nCompletely new dungeons, [i]possibly.[/i]\r\n\r\n[heading]Ways you can help out:[/heading]\r\nDownload this mod and play with it. Report any bugs/glitches you find to me. \r\n\r\nSenior modders who would like to help out with the development with this mod should PM me. Really though guys, this is my very first mod, and I need all the help I can get.\r\n\r\nGot a suggestion? Don\\'t be afraid to put it in the comments!\r\n\r\n[heading]Finished Dungeons:[/heading]\r\n\r\nBleak Falls Barrow\r\n\r\nAngarvunde\r\n\r\nDead Man\\'s Respite\r\n\r\nDustman\\'s Cairn\r\n\r\nForsaken Cave\r\n\r\nYngol Barrow\r\n\r\nFolgunthur\r\n\r\nArcwind Point\r\n\r\nForel Host\r\n\r\nGeirmund\\'s Hall\r\n\r\n[heading]Will not be covered by this mod:[/heading]\r\n\r\nAnsilvund\r\n\r\n",
