  "modName": "RLO - Torches for Realistic Lighting - theFlicker Patch",
  "summary": "Combine the colours of RLO, with the increased torch radius and lifespan of TRL, and the increased flickering effects of theFlicker. The combined result: vastly improved visuals for candles, torches, bonfires, braziers, and pretty much every other type of flame found in the game.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a plugin merging the torch and candle settings of three of the best lighting mods around: Realistic Lighting Overhaul, Torches for Realistic Lighting, and theFlicker. I originally created this for personal use after realising that I wasn\\'t getting the full benefit from any of these mods together- to achieve perfect synergy, I had to create a patch.\r\n\r\n[b]LINKS:[/b]\r\nRLO: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30450]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30450[/url]\r\nTRL: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8741]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8741[/url]\r\ntheFlicker: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11100]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11100[/url]\r\n\r\nThough none of those mods are required for these settings to take effect, they are HIGHLY recommended, as the screenshots and video shown on this mod\\'s page are demonstrating the combined effects of all three mods + this patch! In particular, you really REALLY should have RLO, at the very least. This patch overrides settings for all types of torches and candles, as well as some campfires, and so will conflict with any other mods that change those objects.\r\n\r\nWhy use this patch?\r\n\r\n[youtube]bgzX2Qwz8V8[/youtube]\r\n\r\nWell, these settings were intelligently merged, by hand, to combine the colours of RLO, with the increased torch radius and lifespan of TRL, and the increased flickering effects of theFlicker. You can\\'t achieve this mix using just Wrye Bash alone. The combined result: vastly improved visuals for candles, torches, and campfires; now torches are brighter and last longer to help you in RLO\\'s darker dungeon interiors and nighttimes; light sources are realistically coloured; and candles/open fires flicker like real fire, instead of the slow meandering movement you\\'d otherwise see using vanilla settings.",
