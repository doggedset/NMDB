  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guys, this is my first mod so there are gonna be some bugs. I plan on fixing those, don&#39;t worry. This mod basically changes the conjure familiar to a conjure dragon, an elder dragon that is. It runs smoothly and is great. There are some problems though such as the dragon, after battle, hovers half of his body in the ground and won&#39;t land. If you conjure another it will take off in flight into the ground. The conjurations after that one will work fine, but i&#39;m not sure if that process is repetitive. I hope you have fun with this mod. enjoy&#33;",
