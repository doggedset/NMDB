  "descriptionHtml": "There are several [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9717]vampire mods[/url] out there, but many of them are rather [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17077]extensive overhauls[/url]. They\\'re great mods if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for, but what if you just want a smaller change? With this mod, vampires will get weaker if they don\\'t feed, stronger when they do. Very simple. Now a vampire must continue to feed if he wants to stay powerful, which makes much more sense.\r\n\r\nAlso available on [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=103987716]Steam Workshop[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Vampires who haven\\'t fed (stages 2, 3, 4):[/b]\r\n[list][*]Have weaker versions of their drain and thrall spells.\r\n[*]Do not have Embrace of Shadows.\r\n[*]Have lower frost resistance.\r\n[*]Are weaker to fire and sunlight.[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Vampires who have fed recently (Stage 1):[/b]\r\n[list][*]Have the strongest versions of all spells.\r\n[*]Have Embrace of Shadows.\r\n[*]Are very resistance to frost.\r\n[*]Are only slight weak to fire and sunlight.[/list]\r\n\r\nMessages reporting when your powers grow/recede are updated to reflect these changes.\r\n\r\nImportantly, all stages will now have Vampire\\'s Seduction. It is not removed from later hunger stages because Dawnguard allows you to use it to feed, so I did not want to take that away.\r\n\r\n[b]This has no effect on your Vampire Lord form[/b]. Your transformation ignores your vampiric stage. It grows in power with player level instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that feeding is important, you might want to have more options for it besides sleeping NPCs and Vampire\\'s Seduction. I\\'ve added the items Potion of Blood and Synthetic Blood Serum to several shops.\r\n\r\n[b]Potion of Blood[/b] is the [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Potion_of_Blood#Potion_of_Blood]item from Dawnguard[/url] that feeds and restores 100 health.\r\n\r\n[b]Synthetic Blood Serum[/b] is a new (and very unique) item. It\\'s a dual potion/poison. When consumed as a potion, it feeds a vampire. It also provides immunity to sunlight and prevents blood thirst from building for one day. This means you can choose to feed every two days to keep hunger back, or you could feed every day to stay immune to sunlight.\r\nYou can alternatively activate it as a poison. When applied to a weapon, it causes a painful -120 to the health, magicka, and stamina of a vampire for 60 seconds. This bypasses normal vampire poison immunity, but does nothing to non-vampires. [b]Even non-vampire players can use this as a poison[/b], although drinking it does nothing if you\\'re not a vampire.\r\nI got the idea for this from the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_%28film_series%29]Blade movies[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3]The shops that now carry these and their chances to appear are:[/size]\r\n[b]Potion of Blood[/b]\r\n[list][*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ahkari]Ahkari[/url][i] - 1 at 40%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Babette]Babette[/url][i] - 1 at 100%, 5 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Belethor]Belethor[/url][i] - 2 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bothela]Bothela[/url][i] - 2 at 40%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Enthir]Enthir[/url][i] - 3 at 40%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Feran_Sadri]Feran Sadri[/url][i] - 3 at 100%, 5 at 40%, 5 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Herluin_Lothaire]Herluin Lothaire[/url][i] - 2 at 40%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lisbet]Lisbet[/url][i] - 4 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ma%27dran]Ma\\'dran[/url][i] -  1 at 40%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Niranye]Niranye[/url][i] - 2 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Revyn_Sadri]Revyn Sadri[/url][i] - 1 at 40%, 1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ri%27saad]Ri\\'saad[/url][i] -  1 at 40%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sharamph]Sharamph[/url][i] - 2 at 40%[/i][/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Synthetic Blood Serum[/b]\r\n[list][*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Angeline_Morrard]Angeline Morrard[/url][i] - 1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Arcadia]Arcadia[/url][i] - 1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ahkari]Ahkari[/url][i] - 1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bothela]Bothela[/url][i] - 1 at 40%, 1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Calcelmo]Calcelmo[/url][i] - 1 at 40%, must have Merchant perk[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Elgrim]Elgrim[/url] and [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hafjorg]Hafjorg[/url][i] - 1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Enthir]Enthir[/url][i] - 1 at 40%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Falion]Falion[/url][i] - 1 at 40%, 4 at 15%, must have Merchant perk[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Farengar_Secret-Fire]Farengar[/url][i] - 3 at 15%, must have Merchant perk[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Florentius_Baenius]Florentius Baenius[/url][i]  - 1 at 100%, 2 at 40%, 3 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Frida]Frida[/url][i] - 1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Herluin_Lothaire]Herluin Lothaire[/url][i] - 1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lami]Lami[/url][i] - 1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ma%27dran]Ma\\'dran[/url][i] -  1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Madena]Madena[/url][i] - 3 at 15% , must have Merchant perk[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nelacar]Nelacar[/url][i] - 2 at 15%, must have Merchant perk[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nurelion]Nurelion[/url][i] - 1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Revyn_Sadri]Revyn Sadri[/url][i] - 1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ri%27saad]Ri\\'saad[/url][i] -  1 at 15%[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sybille_Stentor]Sybil Stentor[/url][i] -  1 at 100%, 2 at 40%, must have Merchant perk[/i]\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Wylandriah]Wylandriah[/url][i] - 2 at 15%, must have Merchant perk[/i]\r\n\r\n[*][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Zaria]Zaria[/url][i] - 1 at 15%[/i][/list]\r\n\r\nI built a new system for adding items to existing vendors just so this could be done in a way that cannot conflict with anything else. It\\'s entirely possible I\\'ll add these to more vendors later if they end up being too rare still, but these merchants made sense for now. Potions of Blood are generally carried by only darker merchants, or at least those who can be discreet. They aren\\'t too uncommon and don\\'t cost much. Synthetic Blood Serums can be used [i]against[/i] vampires, so they aren\\'t as taboo, but you still might find it difficult to get everyone who carries them to openly sell to you. They are also rare and fairly expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]Advertisement[/color]\r\nIf you\\'d like to join the Dawnguard as a vampire, try [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21932]this mod[/url].\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=cyan][b]Thanks to:[/b][/color]\r\n[list][*]This is based on [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12727]Vampirism Inverter[/url] by David Brasher, which itself is probably based on the Oblivion mod [url=http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/36206]Simple Vampirism[/url] by kuertee. This mod wasn\\'t built using any of their work, but still I credit them both for the idea.\r\n[*]Mardoxx and especially TMPhoenix for help decompiling Dawnguard\\'s scripts. Although the scripts are available now from Bethesda, this could not have been released as early as it was without their help.\r\n[*]Chesko for (unknowingly) helping to add items to existing vendors.[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a final note, there are also four bugfixes included in this. First, using Potions of Blood (and the new Synthetic Blood Serums) will no longer increment your Necks Bitten counter, because you obviously aren\\'t actually doing that. Second, you no longer get a warning on stage 4 vampirism about being feared and hated, because that doesn\\'t happen with Dawnguard installed (instead you\\'re just warned that your powers are very weak). Third, the sunlight penalty to regeneration for stage 3 has been corrected. And fourth, the ability Nightstalker\\'s Footsteps was incorrectly providing 20% stealth even though it claimed 25%. This has been corrected and it does provide 25% now.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\\'d like to use either the vendor item adding system or the dual potion/poison system in your own mod, feel free to just copy the scripts and do that. Source code is included with everything. Let me know and I may be able to help you or even link to the mod when you\\'re done.
