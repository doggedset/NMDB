  "descriptionHtml": "Adds craftable Heavy Daedric, Dwarven, Ebony, Elven, Glass, and Orcish bows to the game.\r\n\r\nThe weapons are balanced, they are 3x stronger but also take 3x longer to pull, when combined with the heavy arrows you get a much more powerful weapon. This mod does not replace any weapons, it adds brand new weapons and arrows all of which can be forged with the appropriate perks.\r\n\r\n----------\r\nBows\r\n---------\r\nTo start, bows in skyrim are not all the same, the higher quality you go the slower they are. That being said i added new bows based on skyrims that are 3 times slower so higher end weapons like the Daedric Heavy Bow are painfully slow so i wouldn\\'t use it unless you have the quick draw bow perk. To start out use a Orcish Heavy Bow its got a good speed and is basically what i designed this mod around.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of my bows from slowest to fastest: Daedric, Ebony, Glass, Elven, Dwarven, Orcish.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\nArrows\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n[size=4]Use these faster arrows, the bow does not control the speed of the arrow. The arrows speed affects your aim, you will need to aim lower than you would expect at greater distances. Take some test shots on a building to get your bearings. If you only use the bow you don\\'t have this problem.[/size]\r\n\r\nI now have arrows for each bow you can build them at the forge under misc for 2 ingots and 50 arrows.\r\n\r\n------\r\nWord of warning, i always seem to mod when im sleep deprived so if somthing is off please leave a comment  :)",
