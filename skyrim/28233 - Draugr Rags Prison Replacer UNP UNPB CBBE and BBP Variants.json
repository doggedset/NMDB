  "descriptionHtml": "Name          : Draugr Rags Prison Replacer UNP+BBP, UNPB+BBP & CBBE+BBP\r\nVersion       : 1.1\r\nDate          : 12-12-12  \r\nCategory      : Clothing\r\nAuthor(s)     : Tattooedillusions\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n------------\r\nWARNING: Contains some nudity so adults only. I formed the rags that the female Draugrs have on in the dungeons to fit UNP, UNPB, CBBE & each of the BBP variants for people that use BBP and made it a replacer for the Prison Clothes/Rags\r\n\r\n\r\nDetail:\r\n---------\r\n\r\nUPDATE 12-16-12:\r\nAdded version 1.1 files which include Draugr rag replacers for the Beggars Clothes which were brought to my attention are other prison clothes during the game.  I also added footwear meshes for both the beggars clothes and prison clothes which target new textures for each that match the Draugr Rags a little better.  The initial prison clothes (ones you start the game with) have toeless shoes and unfortunately the feet look hideous.  I\\'ve tried everything I can think of short of making this mod use an .esp but I can\\'t get the feet to look right.  \r\n\r\nNOTE: Pics here are of the UNPB BBP version set at 100 wt.  I have pics of the other versions on my Draugr Skirts UNP UNPB CBBE and BBP Variants mod located here if you would like to see the differences.  \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28056\r\n\r\nAlso this is ONLY the vanilla Draugr Rags texture and there is no .esp file because it is just a replacer and I didn\\'t include a texture folder because the .nif file is targeted to the vanilla Draugr rags which is located in the Skyrim Textures .BSA file.\r\n\r\nVERY IMPORTANT SO PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE DOWNLOADING:\r\n\r\nIf you choose to use the BBP versions of either UNP, UNPB or CBBE you will need the proper skeleton and animations for these to work. If you DON\\'T have them it MAY CAUSE CRASHING. You can grab the original BBP skeleton and animations from Cherryhotaling\\'s mod CHSBHC-BBP-Nude and Jiggly Mod (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4888). If you want to view the jiggle from the front view of your character as you walk you will need an additional animation replacer such as Victoria\\'s High Heel Walk Animation by xp32 (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13272). I personally use the Less Exaggerated version. Another skeleton that is compatible is xp32\\'s Maximum Skeleton-XPMS (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800/). Read his description page for more info because you will need FNIS more than likely.\r\n\r\nI took the dirty, silky-ish skirt/rags that the female Draugrs wear in their dungeons and formed it to the UNP, UNPB & CBBE bodies along with each one\\'s BBP Variant and replaced the Prison Clothes with it. The CBBE version is a custom bodyslide preset of the new 3.2 version that I made to be very similar to a preset that Ginnyfizz sent me. Another note on the CBBE version is that the outfits themselves ARE NOT bodyslide compatible meaning if you have you\\'re own personal preset it will not be the same size. I may look into this in the future but for right now it is what it is. If someone that knows how to do this feel free to do so and teach me in the process lol. All I ask is if you do make it compatible just let me know so I can check it out and include myself and the other great modders in my credits list. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and if you like it please endorse, leave a comment or submit a picture (I have it set so I have to verify just so I know when someone does decide to send one) or if you\\'re feeling really generous all 3 would be awesome ha ha. And PLEASE don\\'t forget to do the same for Dimon99\\'s UNP body, AjuntaPall316\\'s BBP version of UNP, Calyps for the UNPB body, Caliente for the CBBE body and bodyslide and Cherry for the basis for BBP with the skeleton and animations. They are the one\\'s that really deserve it.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nTI\r\n\r\n\r\n---Installation:---\r\n-------------------\r\nManual Installation:\r\n--------------------\r\nIMPORTANT PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING\r\nIn order for the outfits to work as intended, you MUST:\r\n\r\n(THIS STEP IS ONLY NECESSARY IF YOU ARE USING A BBP VARIANT. IF NOT THEN SKIP TO THE NEXT STEP)\r\n\r\nFIRST download and install Cherry\\'s skeleton & animations.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4888\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nxp32\\'s Maximum skeleton along with his requirement (FNIS) (Note you will still need Cherry\\'s animations too.)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800/\r\n\r\n(MAIN STEP)\r\n\r\nSECOND download and install the body replacer of your choice if you haven\\'t already and make sure you have the correct body textures for that body.\r\n\r\nDimon99\\'s UNP Body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709\r\n\r\nAjuntaPall316\\'s BBP version of Dimon\\'s UNP body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10470\r\n\r\nCalyps\\' UNPB body (MY PERSONAL FAVORITE)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14899\r\n\r\nCaliente\\'s CBBE body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r\n\r\nTHIRD extract the file you just downloaded from here to anywhere you want to on your computer.\r\n\r\nFOURTH copy the data folder in the file you just downloaded to your Skyrim game directory which should be C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim. Click yes to overwrite when you get the pop-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n---Uninstallation:---\r\n---------------------\r\nManual Uninstallation:\r\n----------------------\r\nEither delete the prisoner folder that contains the meshes to go back to vanilla prisoner clothes or install a different one and overwrite my files when asked\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown issues and bugs:\r\n----------------------\r\nMaybe a little clipping. Especially with the UNPB BBP version around the breasts at idle. I will try to fix this eventually but I\\'ve been working on this for along time and just want to get it out. Also, on the right hip you will notice some triangles. That is how the original Beth mesh was and my noobness has no idea to fix it. Another thing I have no idea how to fix is you\\'ll notice that when inside somewhere they will look darker when the light hits it. I have no idea if this is a nif setting I have to change or if it\\'s just Skyrim\\'s lighting. Any advice would be great on that matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatabilities:\r\n------------------\r\nNone that I know of just make sure you have the right body textures installed for the body you are using.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact:\r\n--------\r\nFeel free to send me a message here at the Nexus if you run into any issues or just to say Hey.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT - Requirements:\r\n-------------------------\r\nSkyrim of course\r\n\r\nA body replacer from one of the above links\r\n\r\n(Only necessary if you are using BBP)\r\nCherryHotaling\\'s BBP skeleton and animations or your game will crash\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n--------\r\nDimon99 for the UNP body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709\r\n\r\nAjuntaPall316 for the BBP version of the UNP body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10470\r\n\r\nCalyps for the UNPB & BBP body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14899\r\n\r\nCaliente for the CBBE body and Bodyslide\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r\n\r\nCherryHotaling for bringing the bounce to Skyrim in the first place\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4888\r\n\r\nxp32 for the XPMS Maximum Skeleton\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800\r\n\r\nand for the Victoria\\'s High Heeled Walk animations\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13272\r\n\r\nHumannature66 for his great input and thoughts on the Litheria Draugr Skirts.
