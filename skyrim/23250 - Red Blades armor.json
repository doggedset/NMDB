  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red][size=5][center][b]RED BLADES LIGHT ARMOR[/b][/center][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\nAdds a set of light armor:\r\n\r\n- [color=lightblue]Craftable[/color] at any Forge - Steel menu\r\n- Can be fully [color=lightblue]Tempered[/color] - considered Scaled Material\r\n- Requires the [color=lightblue]Advanced Armors[/color] smithing perk\r\n- Stats close to [color=lightblue]glass armor[/color]\r\n- A Crown (armored circlet) replaces the helmet.\r\n- Complete Set: all light armor perks can apply.\r\n- [color=lightblue]Retextured[/color] in Red by SluggoV2, from his [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10755]blades light armor mod[/url], and not by me. Authorization received, thanks again pal. It makes that armor set unique.\r\n- Male or Female\r\n- Khajit and Argonian friendly.\r\n- French version included as Optional. Main version in English, of course. Other translations are always welcome.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1.2: FIXED the gloss effect - one .nif file was missing, sorry about that. Reload it!\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]INSTALL[/b]\r\n\r\nUse NMM, or extract and copy/paste the content of the .rar file into your Skyrim/Data directory.\r\nUninstall: uncheck the mod, delete the .esp file and the copied meshes & textures of that armor.\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE about the cuirass on the Female version:[/b]\r\n\r\nI kept the vanilla cuirass mesh for the female version, so that players using a Body mod like CBBE, UNP, ADEC etc. could use their own armor mesh adapted to their body of choice. Example: I use Dimon99\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]UNP[/url] mod (hi-res text of course) and ingame the female version of my Red Blades armor will use the converted blades cuirass Mesh from Exeter\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7305]UNP Female Armors[/url] meshes pack.\r\n\r\nPS I can ask Exeter for an authorization to include his converted meshes, so that you can get the full UNP version of that Red Blades armor - the one I use. Ask me on comments, I\\'ll see what I can do.\r\n\r\nThe downfall is that the female cuirass will still be textured as the vanilla blades cuirass (Black) but the boots & gloves will be new & reddish.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]LORE[/b]\r\n\r\nThe Red Blades were the Empire\\'s special units during the Great War. Unlike the heavy bodyguards of the Emperor - the more classic Blades warriors - they needed a lighter and more flexible armor for their long travels in hostile territory, and their recon or \\\"strike fast\\\" missions against the Thalmor.\r\n\r\nThe Redguard blacksmiths of the Anvil crafted for them these Red Blades armors, as strong as the classic lamellar armors of the South, but lighter, by using different materials and new techniques.\r\nNow, the Red Blades are outlaws and most of them have sold their gear to merchants, sometimes to blacksmiths. In Skyrim, only some veterans of the Great War still remember how to craft them. The good news is that some of them have become successfull blacksmiths and maybe you could forge yourself a new set with their teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]RECOMMENDED WEAPON SET[/b]\r\n\r\nInsanity\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15389]Celtic Katana[/url] collection perfectly first that armor, especially the Red versions of the Dai-Katana, Katana and Tanto.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]WIP for 1.1[/b]\r\n\r\n- Add a Light Shield. Red retexture already included.\r\n- Add the UNP option (on request) with Exeter\\'s approval first.",
