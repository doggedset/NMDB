  "descriptionHtml": "[b]This is my a race mod and does not replace or change the Argonians[/b] \r<br />\r<br />[font=Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif][color=#d5d4d4][b]Shadowscales are Argonians born under the sign of shadow in black marsh They are trained from childhood in the art of stealth and combat. Shadowscales serve their province as assassins. They have historically been used by the King of Argonia as a means to end conflicts and wars without major bloodshed, and to gather information on potential foes. \r<br />\r<br />I have given a skill bonus to the shadowscale race and 2 new powers while trying to keep the race balanced\r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy the mod and long live the shadowscales    \r<br />[/b][/color][/font]",
