  "descriptionHtml": "Sunnie\\'s Tracer Arrows v2.5\r\n\r\nAdds translucent tracer style arrows in various colors, as well as explosive and time delayed explosive arrows.\r\nTime delayed arrows are intended to be used as proximity weapons, they have no direct damage (other than base bow damage) and will not explode if shot into any enemy.\r\n\r\nTo install: Unpack and drop the SunnieTracerArrows2_5.esp and SunnieTracerArrows2_5.bsa into Skyrim\\'s data folder (?\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\). Activate mod with a mod manager or the games launcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo update 1.x or 2.0 > 2.5: \r\n-If you are updating from 1.x, Delete the following folders and files inside them.\r\n--->?\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\effects\\\\sunnie\r\n--->?\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\weapons\\\\sunnie\r\n-Delete SunnieTracerArrows.esp.\r\n-If you are upgrading from 2.0, delete SunnieTracerArrows.esp and SunnieTracerArrows.bsa from the Data folder.\r\n\r\n[color=red]NOTE:[/color] It is recommended to clean your save game of the older versions. Disable old version of mod, run game, load save and select ok to missing mod message. Once in game, do a manual save and exit.\r\n\r\n-Unpack the v2.5 zip file into ?\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data (yes to overwrite any files)\r\n-Use mod manager or launcher to activate new version.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo uninstall: Delete SunnieTracerArrows2_5.esp and SunnieTracerArrows2_5.bsa from the Data folder.\r\n\r\nHistory:\r\n\r\nVersion 2.5 : Feb 17, 2012\r\n-Added new time delayed explosive arrows in 5 and 10 second delay options.\r\n-Removed the need for using spell scrolls in the explosive arrow recipes, it was a bit frustrating trying to find them legitimately during normal game play.\r\n-Rebuilt entire mod in Creation Kit, previous versions were developed in early 3rd party tools and had some persistent issues. This also fixed a bug where the Bound Bow arrows were green when they should not have been.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0 : Feb 08, 2012\r\n-Added Blue color arrows\r\n-Added 4 different explosive arrows: Fire, Frost, Lightning, Poison. \r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 : Jan 17, 2012\r\n-Added 4 additional color arrows (red, purple, yellow, white).\r\n-Increased trailing tail size and intensity so arrows are more easily tracked in flight.\r\n\r\nVersion: v1.0 : Jan 16, 2012\r\n-Initial release\r\n-Adds new glow style translucent arrows to Skyrim that can be crafted at any forge. \r\n\r\nConflicts: None, this is a stand alone mod. \r\n\r\n\r\nPermissions: You can not use this mod or any part of it in another mod without permission.
