  "modName": "Oblivion Roll Dodge",
  "summary": "In a game where you fight dragons, dodge projectiles and attack strategically, I was appalled at the removal of the Acrobatics skill and in particular the epic rolls you could perform in Oblivion in order to dodge attacks. This small mod adds a &#39;roll dodge&#39; you can perform by simply hitting a key on your keyboard. ",

Just simply drag and drop the esp and bsa files into your DATA folder. Before you can use this mod, there are you few steps you must first perform. Because of the limitation that comes with the implementing of gameplay mechanics into Skyrim, before you can roll you must first have the &#39;Silent Roll&#39; perk which can be obtained by entering [Code] Player.AddPerk 00105f23 [/Code] into the console. [/size]\r<br />",
