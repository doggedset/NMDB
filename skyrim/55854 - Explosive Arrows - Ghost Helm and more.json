  "descriptionHtml": "Arrows:\r<br />Daedric Explosive Arrow - xx001DA8 (Large area explosion, 24 points of damage)\r<br />Daedric Lightning Arrow - xx002312 (Single-Target lightning arrow, 24 points of damage)\r<br />Daedric Freeze Arrow - xx002311 (Single-target paralysis arrow, 24 points of damage)\r<br />\r<br />Nightingale Armor (Modified):\r<br />Night Armor - xx000D70\r<br />Night Boots - xx000D71\r<br />Night Gloves - xx000D73\r<br />Night Helm - xx000D75\r<br />Night Ring - xx000D77\r<br />\r<br />Sexy/Spooky caster armor:\r<br />Ghost&#39;s Touch - xx006CDE\r<br />Ring of Wolves - xx006CE0\r<br />Crown of Corin - xx006CDF (Turns character into a ghost, not marked as undead)\r<br />Nocturnal Robes - xx006CE1 (Yes, the incredibly sexy one, not bugged)\r<br />Boots of Stalking - xx006CDD\r<br />Jewel of Haunting - xx014A41 (Creates an ice cloak)\r<br />\r<br />Forsworn caster armor (Modified):\r<br />Helmet of the Homeland - xx02DF4A\r<br />Armor of the Homeland - xx02DF48\r<br />Boots of the Homeland - xx02DF47\r<br />Gauntlets of the Homeland - xx02DF49\r<br />\r<br />** Notes:\r<br />1) The ghost effect from the Crown of Corin will PERMANENTLY affect your character, I have not found a fix for this. When removed you become mostly transparent, but still visible to NPCs.\r<br />2) The Jewel of Haunting cloak affect is NOT permanent. You can take it off and there is no lingering affect.\r<br />3) These arrows are good for distracting NPCs (most will run toward the landing spot) and are MUCH more visible than even Bound arrows.\r<br />4) Some of these items are a bit overpowered, so if you&#39;re playing on a lower difficulty you may want to increase it.\r<br />5) If you are new to the console, the &#39;xx&#39; in front of the number corresponds to the load order of this mod. It will go from &#39;01&#39;-&#39;09&#39; then to &#39;0A&#39; and up.\r<br />6) These arrows ARE affected by the stealth multiplier\r<br />7) This is my first custom file and I can&#39;t really support it much because I&#39;m just messing around with stuff. Also, I don&#39;t THINK you need any expansions....",
