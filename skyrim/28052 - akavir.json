  "descriptionHtml": "A large japan style castle. Real name of the house is Yagiu\\'s castle, the map marker will indicate this name, but i can\\'t enter it on the site, i don\\'t know why.  Location : Near Dawnstar. Other mod required : None. Issues : Notice me if you have any problem. My last mod, using the same method, seems to be automatically unchecked by Nexus mod manager. Feel free to use and change any parts of my mod.\r\n\r\nImportant. Because i don\\'t think the mod is very stable and can create crashs. It\\'s at least easy to uninstall entirely. Go to your data folder. In your \\\"texture\\\" file find \\\"\\\"Chatex\\\", in your \\\"meshes\\\" file find \\\"Meschato\\\", in your mods list find Yagiu\\'s castle.esp. Delete these elements. It will have no effects on your other mods or on skyrim system.  ",
