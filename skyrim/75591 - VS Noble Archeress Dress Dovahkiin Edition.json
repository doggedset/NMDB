Adds 23 total new colours/patterns. \r<br />UNP version for initial release. CBBE will be added soon&#33;\r<br />This is a standalone, Dovahkiin-specific texture. Has a large dragon crest on the vest back to signify your Dragonborn status. \r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />Two pattern styles: Vintage and Tartans. \r<br />Vest has dragon crest on back and added designs in the leather on all sides.\r<br />Belt updated to studded variant with re-coloured coin purse and pouches.\r<br />And six matching hood variants with new textures. \r<br />These are the same meshes as the original dress version.\r<br />Update will be added later (TBA with updates of original Medieval Archeress dress) to correct wrist gaps that resulted from the uneven UNP arm meshes and weight sliders. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is for the dresses and hoods only. Wrist band and shoes are contained in the original [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74702/?]Medieval Archeress[/url] set. \r<br />Additional shoe colours, circlets can be used from the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72966/?]Paige Cuirass[/url]. \r<br />\r<br />Craft at forge under leather. Or obtained quickly through use of the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64905/?]AddItemMenu[/url] mod, type in &#34;Archeress&#34; (recommended for those who do not like crafting).\r<br />Light armor, with same stats as VS Medieval Archeress Dress, rating 40. Upgrade at bench, enchantable too&#33;\r<br />[color=#3d85c6]\r<br />WARNING ABOUT THE MESHES/TEXTURES.\r<br />My original meshes for the torso portion are HIGH POLY COUNT. The Textures are also high rez. This means, if you have a lower end pc you may experience issues using this item. If you find you do have any issue loading the item in inventory, freezing upon equipping, or any other performance related issue you will most likely need to uninstall. I will not be providing a Low Poly Count/Low Rez version of this mod. It&#39;s as is.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ffff00]Check out my other mods:[/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/14180385/?tb=mods&pUp=1]ViciousSARR[/url]\r<br />[color=#ffff00]And for updates on future mods and WIPs\r<br />Visit[/color] [url=https://www.tumblr.com/blog/vicioussarr]Tumblr\r<br />[/url]\r<br />[/size][center][color=#ffff00][size=4]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />My screenshots are done either with Rudy END or Climates of Tamriel, \r<br />both of which work fantastic on armors with cubemaps.\r<br />The cubemaps also work great in Vanilla lighting.\r<br />Certain ENBs may cause the armors with cubemapping to look &#34;shiny&#34; or like plastic.\r<br /> You may be able to adjust this in your ENB settings.

My mods are meant to be conservative/family friendly, as in all age groups.\r<br /> That being said, I am not permitting other body conversions. UNP and CBBE are better suited to the overall Skyrim look.\r<br />Any conversions will be handled by myself or other mod authors of my specific choosing. \r<br />No conversions will be made for 7Base, Bombshell, UUNP, Bodyslide, TBM, HDT, etc. \r<br />[color=#ff0000]If you do not like that, then do not use this mod. All negative comments will be ignore and removed if need be.[/color]\r<br />I will ignore all complaints about this.[/center]",
