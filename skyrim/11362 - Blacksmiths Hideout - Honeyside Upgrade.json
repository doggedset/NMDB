  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Impact][size=6][center]Blacksmith\\'s Hideout - Upgrade for Honeyside[/center][/size][/font]\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]==\tIntroduction\t==[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nHi! I\\'m El Tucu and this is a mod i made that adds a whole new upgrade for Riften\\'s purchasable house, Honeyside, dedicated to blacksmiths! Plus it adds new storage for both Alchemy Lab and Enchanting Table upgrades. Video and images with all the details!\r\n\r\n[b]If you have issues with the steward\\'s dialogue not appearing (conflict with other mods i think, i can\\'t reproduce it) you can download the \\\"No Dialogue\\\" version and go and \\\"talk\\\" with the button instead of Anuriel :P DON\\'T use the two esps at the same time, just install either the normal version or the \\\"No Dialogue\\\" one.[/b]\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]==\tDetailed features\t==[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n- New smithing hidden room! For the paranoid blacksmith, it features more weapon stands, a forge, workbench, grindstone, new storage and furniture.\r\n- New smelthing room! With your own smelter! Plus bunch of furniture, storage, your own safe box, more weapon stands, chopping wood block and lots of things that i forgot probably.\r\n- Between the two new rooms there are 12 new weapon stands and around 15 new containers for the obsesive compulsive adventure collector of all things interesting and shiny!\r\n- Two new chests for Enchanting Table upgrades! No need to go back to the first floor to look for your gems and weapons.\r\n- Two satchels in the Alchemy Lab! So\\'ll have your ingredients at reach when making potions.\r\n- Two buttons! Everybody loves buttons!\r\n- And probably stuff that i forgot.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]==\tNotes\t==[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThe upgrade is purchased from the Jarl\\'s steward, its price is 3000 septims (basically doubles the size of the house). The location of the secret entrance is despicted in both the images that i\\'ve uploaded and the video link.\r\n\r\nIts NOT navmeshed!!! That means that your followers WONT follow you into the new rooms. I\\'ll fix that once Bethesda fixes their navmesh bug in Skyrim.\r\n\r\nThe installation is the same as any other mods. Just extract in your Skyrim/Data folder, enable the mod in the launcher or Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]==\tVideo\t==[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[url=http://youtu.be/L4iXz8IQkbA][b]Skyrim Mod - Blacksmith\\'s Hideout (house upgrade)[/b][/url]\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]==\tOther mods I made\t==[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13087][i][b]Wicked Moons Retex[/i][/b][/url]\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]==\tChangelog\t==[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 : I forgot to add the script :D Sorry about that.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 : First release.",
