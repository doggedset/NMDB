  "summary": "Master and Expert is actually now doable in Skyrim Redone. Armor perks now give adequate bonuses, making Heavy Armor actually viable. Removed the helm requirement for Bastion, don\\'t have to forfeit the bonus in order to wear a light armor Dragon Priest Helm. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "NB: Requires Skyrim Redone and needs to be loaded after all it\\'s modules.\r\n\r\nVanilla difficulty scaling just don\\'t work out very well in Skyrim Redone, since it\\'s mostly \r\n\r\nbalanced around 1:1 Adept. The difference between Vanilla Adept and Master is 4x which is impossible to balance. The new difficulties is close to the 1:1 ratio with enemy leveling normalized across all of them. 25-50% bonus damage from enemies in Skyrim Redone is a lot.\r\n\r\nMaster: 1.2 : 1.5\r\nExpert: 1.1 : 1.25\r\nAdept: 1 : 1\r\nApprentice 0.75 : 0.85\r\nNovice 0.5 : 0.75\r\n\r\nThe problem with the Armor perks is that it apples to the base armor rating only, giving you very minor bonuses. I\\'ve gone ahead and double them, now scales better along with the enemies you face.\r\n",
