It is located on the summit of a mountain between Riverwood and Whiterun. The fortress is rather small, but the design offers everything you need.

You have to complete a quest to returning the former glory of the fortress. After that, you have a  atmospheric home to live with the following features:\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Exterior areas:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/34834-1-1366042395.jpg[/img] \n<br />\n<br />1.

You can [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/34834-2-1366042181.jpg]heat up[/url]  the forge with coal or firesalts:\n<br />          10 piece of coal – fortify smiting 14% for 60sec.\n<br />          01 firesalt – fortify smiting 24% for 60sec.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />5.

Eagle’s Nest (no reset zone / safe containers)[/i] \n<br />Eagle’s Nest is the main building of the fortress. It is the area for the player to live. There is an office, a living room, a bar, a kitchen, a dining area and a bedroom. There are also two mannequins and a lot of weapon racks and also a secret safe.\n<br />\n<br />[i]B. Alchemy tower (no reset zone / safe containers)[/i] \n<br />The Tower contains a small alchemy area. But it has enough containers to store your ingredients. \n<br />\n<br />[i]There is also the special alchemy burner located. You can [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/34834-2-1366042181.jpg]heat up[/url]  the burner with coal or firesalts:\n<br />          10 piece of coal – fortify alchemy 14% for 60sec.\n<br />          01 firesalt – fortify alchemy 24% for 60sec.[/i] \n<br />\n<br />[i]C. Stable (no reset zone / safe containers)[/i] \n<br />In the stables live the animals (cow, goat, chickens), the NPCs and there is also a free bet for a follower.\n<br />\n<br />[i]D. Stonetree/Mine (reset zone / not safe containers!)[/i] \n<br />Stontree is a mine with different types of ore. But attention, the containers there aren’t safe. The area is set as a reset zone because the ore has to respawn.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Quest and NPCs[/size][/b] \n<br />You have to complete a quest. \n<br />\n<br />1. Find the [url=http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/34834-3-1366041845.jpg]dead eagle[/url] , take the book “Legend of the Eagles Nest” AND don’t forget to take the key\n<br />2. [url=http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/34834-4-1366041846.jpg]Read the book[/url]  (the quest starts by reading the book), use the information and find the fortress\n<br />3. Buy furniture in Riverwood (about 7000 gold)\n<br />4. Find a steward (also in Riverwood)\n<br />5. Find a guard (also in Riverwood, about 1400 gold))\n<br />6. Buy some livestock (also in Riverwood, about 1000 gold)\n<br />7. Find someone who rebuilt the secret Passage (also in Riverwood, about 700 gold)\n<br />\n<br />If you have any problems to complete the quest let me know. \n<br />\n<br />[b]- NPCs list:[/b]\n<br />[i](Name / funktion before completed quest / funktion after completed quest)[/i] \n<br />\n<br />Aldavinur Félagi / beggar in Riverwood / steward and merchant (during the day) with AI package (sweep, chopping wood…)\n<br />Oddur Húni / wounded warrior / guard with AI package (patrol, training, sleep…)\n<br />Aldavinur Félagi / sells furniture in Riverwood / same\n<br />Oddi Holdur / sells the livestock in Riverwood / same\n<br />Grasteinn Apall / miner, merchant (during the day) and helps you to rebuilt the secret passage / same\n<br />\n<br />After completing the quest, you can [url=http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/34834-3-1366042011.jpg]equip your steward and guard[/url]. Talk to them and choose “I have some items for you”.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Install[/size][/b] \n<br />a. Use NMM to install\n<br />b. Manually install contents of archive in Skyrim/Data folder.\n<br />c. Use the version on steam workshop\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Update[/size][/b] \n<br />This is just a small update. the changes aren't that important, especially if you've already finished the quest.\n<br />It's up to you if you want to install it or use the old version if you already finished the quest.\n<br />\n<br />Following points are fixed with the update:\n<br />- Added a SEQ file, so the dialogues should show up without save and load the savegame\n<br />- Fixed the \"grey face bug\"\n<br />- Renamed the \"Stables\" to \"Byre\"\n<br />- The steward the NPC who sells furniture in Riverwood look different now and have different names\n<br />- Fixed some misspelling and trainslation errors \n<br />\n<br />To Upgrade:\n<br />(no ill affects on savegames):\n<br />[color=orange][b][size=4]1. Make a Backup/clean savegame (best at another location like breezhome)[/size][/b] [/color] \n<br /> 2. Uninstall the old mod.\n<br /> 3. Install the new mod.\n<br /> 4. Start Skyrim and play.  \n<br />\n<br />There is no effect on saved games\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Required[/size][/b] \n<br />Latest version of skyrim\n<br />Doesn’t require any DLC \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/b] \n<br />The mod is compatible with riverhelm\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Incompatibility[/size][/b] \n<br />(Probably mods - especially player homes - which are located in the same area.)\n<br />Riverwood Real Forest \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Known Issues or Bugs[/size][/b] \n<br />- First: If you have any problems, try to change load order\n<br />- I’m Swiss, so my English is not the best. If you find spelling mistakes please report them to me.\n<br />- Because of the high grade of detail, performance may suffer in the mod\n<br />[color=green]- During the quest, if dialogue doesn't show up (for example with Aldavinur Felagi / buy furniture) save and load the savegame again. That should help.[/color] \n<br />- Some of the weapon racks are designed for a “specific” type of weapon. 'If you place a bow in a rack designed for a dagger, it doesn't fit.\n<br />- Some weapon racks are also pretty small. I didn’t want to have the large, chunky weapon racks everywhere. The disadvantage of this is that sometimes it's difficult to take weapons out of the racks\n<br />- If you equip the guard or the merchant NPC, they will be set as player teammate. So if you draw your weapon, they will also draw their weapons. I don’t see that as a “bug”, I think it is even more atmospheric.\n<br />- Known “bugs” with moving mannequins, they could also undress the armor after some days, but they won’t lose it! The Armor is then in the inventory of the mannequins.\n<br />[color=green]- The steward and the furniture salesman look similar and have the same name. The quest will still work, but this makes for confusion. I'll fix that by the next \"mini update\"[/color] \n<br />[color=orange]- If the livestock dosen't shows up in the Byre just save and load the save game.[/color] \n<br />[color=orange]- Some players have the sound of the wind also at other places like riverwood. The cause is still unclear.\n<br />For a temorary fix you can download the optinal \"flaho_shi_eagles_nest_wind_fix\" file. This optinal file place a silent *.wav file form the \"ambr_wind_mountainheavy_lp.wav\" to the following directory: \"SteamsteamappscommonskyrimDataSoundfxambrwindmountainheavy\" This File will overwrite the effect in the whole Skyrim. But If you delet the file out of the folder, or uninstall the mot with NMM everything is normal aigain.[/color] \n<br />[color=orange]- If you use BOSS you get this warning:\n<br />Warning: This file contains 1 deleted NavMesh record that TES5Edit cannot repair automatically and it may cause problems with your game. NavMesh deletions should be reported to the mod author. A guide to repairing NavMesh deletions with TES5Edit is located here.\n<br />I checked it, and there are two navmesh in Riverwood affected. It isn't a big problem but I'll fix that with the upcoming update.[/color] \n<br />\n<br />[size=2][color=green]- green - fixed with V.1.05[/color] [/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]History[/size][/b] \n<br />1.0, 14/04/2013 - Initial release\n<br />\n<br />1.05, 19/04/2013 - mini update\n<br />Just a small update. The changes aren't that important, especially if you've already finished the quest.\n<br />\n<br />Following points are fixed with the update:\n<br />- Added a SEQ file, so the dialogues should show up without save and load the savegame\n<br />- Fixed the \"grey face bug\"\n<br />- Renamed the \"Stables\" to \"Byre\"\n<br />- The steward the NPC who sells furniture in Riverwood look diffrend now and have diffrend names\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Closing word[/size][/b] \n<br />This is my second mod at all. So maybe not everything is perfect, but I spent a lot of time to create a atmospheric player home. If you like it, leave a comment. I'm glad about any feedback ;)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Atmosphere and video[/size][/b] \n<br />I tried to capture the atmosphere as good as I can with the Images. Unfortunately, I can’t make video because I haven’t got any programs for that. So, if someone would like to make a video that would be great. But the best way to feel the whole atmosphere of the mod you should download it and convince yourself ;)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Recommended mods[/size][/b] \n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10652]Vanilla Mannequin Script Fix[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10891/?tab=3&amp;navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D10891]Unlimited Bookshelves[/url] \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Credits[/size][/b] \n<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\n<br />Thanks to RealitySpectre for the Mod resources\n<br />Thanks to Grantyboy050 for creating the LOD\n<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/category/134-resources/]Thanks to TESA for the Mod resources[/url] \n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14134]Thanks to Blary for the Mod resources[/url] \n<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/category/134-resources/]Thanks to InsanitySorrow for the Mod resources[/url] \n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16525]Thanks to Oaristys and Tony67 for the Mod resources[/url] \n<br />[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_x6y8gHIhc&amp;feature=player_embedded]Thanks to insane0hflex aka svaalbard for the great mod video[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_r1s0oACM8&amp;feature=player_embedded]Thanks to Brodual for the great mod video[/url]\n<br />Thanks to obla for the Spanish translation\n<br />Thanks to DavorVideoBlast  for the Italian translation\n<br />Thanks to ebrate for the Russian translation\n<br />Thanks to EldunariEmlyg for the German translation\n<br />Thanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\n<br />Thanks to the people, who made tutorials\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]My other mods[/size][/b] \n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21122]Eng.
