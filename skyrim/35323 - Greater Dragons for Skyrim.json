  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a few non-respawning Greater Dragons for the more experienced player to fight. I would not advise downloading this for anything except a seriously challenging fight, or for a more immersive lore experience with dragons as really deadly fights. This will not effect any other dragon mods, as the dragons added are completely independent of the standard races.",
