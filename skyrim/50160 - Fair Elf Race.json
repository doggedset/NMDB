  "descriptionHtml": "This mod was created by request of Laicamir, and is based on his detailed description of his desired starting race.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s basically a small modification of the Wood Elf race. (It does not replace Wood Elves, they are just similar.)\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Fair Elves (Elenmer)\r<br />\r<br />Fair Elves, also known as &#34;Elenmer,&#34; are a race of elves that separated from the Bosmer over disagreements surrounding the Green Pact, and still share many of their physical characteristics. Most live in small communities in secluded locations and almost all become adventurers. Their culture emphasizes valor and stories of great heroes: As such, their culture most emulates that of the Nords and many of these elves emigrate to Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />They are naturally proficient in one-handed weaponry and restoration magic. Fair Elves can also carry heavier loads than most elves due to their constant travels. Elenmer blood grants them 80% resistance to disease and faster travel speeds. They can use Diplomacy to increase their speechcraft for a short period of time.\r<br />\r<br />Ability:\r<br />Nomadic Lifestyle - Disease resistance is 80%, and travel speed is increased by 10%.\r<br />\r<br />Power:\r<br />Diplomacy - Raises speechcraft by 25 points.\r<br />\r<br />Starting Stats:\r<br />One-Handed +10\r<br />Speech +5\r<br />Archery +5\r<br />Light Armor +5\r<br />Restoration +5\r<br />Enchanting +5\r<br />\r<br />Other:\r<br />Height has been increased to 1.05, carry capacity starts 50 points higher than usual. \r<br />Slightly lower starting HP and higher magicka and stamina than average. \r<br />\r<br />Appearance:\r<br />Wood Elves with taller stature and lighter hair color and skin tone options.\r<br />\r<br />TROUBLESHOOTING:\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re having some weird issues going on, you may need TMPhoenix&#39;s &#34;RaceCompatability for Skyrim and Dawnguard,&#34; available here:\r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24168/?",
