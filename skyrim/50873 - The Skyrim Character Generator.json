  "descriptionHtml": "[u][b]NEW 2015 UPDATE[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Man it has been so long since I even touched this project. I still cannot believe you lot seem to like it. Since I had some spare time, I decided to come back to it and do a complete rewrite, improving on its features. It was a complete rewrite since I had lost the original VB project files and hence the source code. Since I&#39;m finally uploading the final, revised version, I&#39;m discontinuing this project. I can assure you if I ever do anything worth releasing to the world, I will promote it here in good moderation.\r<br />\r<br />Continuing on...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I know we all had trouble coming up with characters for our RPGs at some point, so I made this program for a school project.\r<br />\r<br />This is a simple yet capable random character generator for Skyrim, Oblivion and Morrowind. It generates random attributes such as name, age, class, titles and more. If you don&#39;t want to generate a certain aspect, you can simply untick it. You can also choose if your character is a &#39;Dovahkiin&#39; or a Vampire or a Werewolf.\r<br />\r<br />The old version had only 250&#39;000 possible first-last name combos, but now the new version has as much as 32 million. Names have been greatly expanded upon[i], [/i]now including an option to limit names to lore friendly variants for the generated race (Race specific names)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you generated a character you&#39;re actually happy with, you can export it as a .txt file to keep as a reference or perhaps share.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Due to limitations and other factors, its obvious I can&#39;t generate the character&#39;s looks on a GUI, but that&#39;s the fun part.Â  It would be way too much work for me to generate textual descriptions for hair, face, eyes, [s]corpse[/s] war paint. This is especially considering the amount of you who use anime hair modifications, crystal clear faces, WAY TOO MANY DAMN FRECKLES and demonic kitty eyes. You can just simply imagine what your character would look like based on the more [i]important[/i] attributes that can be implemented.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This program was written with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express\r<br />Personal use is free of course, but if you put it up on other sites, I would prefer you to link it in the comment section.\r<br />[b]May Talos guide you[/b]",
