I feel that some spells should have different mechanics, for example, it would be nice that protective spells could be cast just by selecting them on the menu, instead of been equipped, charge and release.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]This mod gives you the possibility to improve your magic casting gameplay with the following three alternatives:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img51/7269/ex45.png[/img][size=3]You can assign a set of rules to a spell to be cast automatically[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img194/8732/0lk4.png[/img][size=3]You can customize these special rings to cast spells when you wear them. You don&#39;t have to worry about your gear, the biped slot was not assigned to these rings, meaning that no item will be unequipped from your character[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img202/7595/m0t4.png[/img][size=3]Cast more spells with just one hand, you can select up to 3 spells to be cast at the same time[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]You don&#39;t have to be a magic caster to benefit from this mod, if you are a warrior or a thief, you can create Smart Spells or Spell Rings to cast minor spells like [color=#8C99C2][i]Oakflesh[/i][/color] or [color=#8C99C2][i]Fast Healing[/i][/color] without switching your weapons, now you can use your magicka pool more often, even if it is very small.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img203/8742/mnwp.png[/img][/center]\r<br />[size=3]Before installing this mod, make sure you have [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3863]SkyUI[/url] 4.1 and [url=http://skse.silverlock.org]SKSE[/url] 1.6.16 installed, you can try using a lower version, but I programmed the scripts using those versions.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]I recommend installing this mod with [color=#CCCCFF][i]Nexus Mod Manager[/i][/color], but if you are installing it manually, just extract into your [color=#CCCCFF][i]skyrim/data[/i][/color] folder.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img547/4125/jlir.png[/img][/center]\r<br />[size=3]After a successful installation, wait around 20 seconds for the initialization message to appear and the MCM to announce the registration of 2 mod configuration pages, after that, you will be ready to go. If you are updating, the mod will disable itself while it makes the necessary changes, just wait for the update messages to appear, any new features will be set to their default values.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img819/7/v7il.jpg[/img][size=3]Location of the mod configuration pages[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]The mod revolves around the weapons and spell cache menus to help you customize your spell casting options. It is a little odd to use them, but the limitations of [color=#CCCCFF][i]Papyrus[/i][/color] gave me no other choice, here is the explication:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#EEFF77][size=4][b]1.[/b][/size][/color] [size=3]To get some spells or weapons up and running with the mod you have to equip them to your character first, powers are supported but shouts are not.[/size]\r<br />[color=#EEFF77][size=4][b]2.[/b][/size][/color] [size=3]Once you enter either of the mod configuration pages those weapons or spells will be registered to their corresponding cache menu.[/size]\r<br />[color=#EEFF77][size=4][b]3.[/b][/size][/color] [size=3]The first spells or weapons in the cache menus will be the ones your character currently has equipped. The limit of either cache menu is 30 slots.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img594/7223/ma28.png[/img][size=3]Spells cache menu[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img24/36/bkoj.png[/img][size=3]Weapons cache menu[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]The main purpose of the cache menus is to minimize all the switching of spells and weapons to configure the mod, but keeping it as compatible as possible.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]You can use any spell to be part of the mod, even the ones that need a target, but I highly recommend using only cast-on-oneself spells and avoid concentration spells, for example, use [color=#8C99C2][i]Fast Healing[/i][/color] instead of [color=#8C99C2][i]Healing[/i][/color]. You have to keep in mind that some spells have a casting range, if the required range is not met, the spell cast will fail and the magicka needed for the spell will be consumed, [color=#8C99C2][i]Conjure Familiar[/i][/color] spell is a good example of a spell with a casting range that will fail if you target an area too far away.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img850/5423/dmb9.jpg[/img][size=3]Example of failing and succeeding the [color=#8C99C2][i]Conjure Familiar[/i][/color] spell cast, notice that both screenshots have consumed the magicka for the spell[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img12/4318/ejab.png[/img]\r<br />[size=3]Here you can set up rules for the auto casting system, if all the rules you assign to a spell met and you have enough magicka, the spell will be cast without any intervention from the user and the magicka needed for the spell will be consumed. The order for casting spells is from top to bottom (spell 0 to spell 10), this means if you have a spell that consumes a lot of magicka at the top, other spells will not be cast even if the rules met, keep that in mind. I recommend putting [color=#8C99C2][i]Fast Healing[/i][/color] at the very top, you don&#39;t want to die because you cast a big spell instead of a lifesaving [color=#8C99C2][i]Fast Healing[/i][/color] spell.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img854/8738/23p4.jpg[/img][size=3]These are the available options for Smart Spells[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Smart Spells can be auto dispel too, for a spell to qualify for auto dispelling the duration of its magic effects should be more than 25 seconds. If the character is still in combat or just got out of combat, the dispel option will return some magicka back depending of the time the spell was active, for example, a spell will return more magicka if it is dispelled with 40 seconds than 20 seconds left.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]I guess all the other features of this mod configuration page are self-explanatory, besides the page has [color=#CCCCFF][i]Option Highlight Text[/i][/color] to help you through. The [color=#CCCCFF][i]default key[/i][/color] for the mod configuration pages has the role of clear/reset, if you use it at the select spell option it will remove the Smart Spell, if you use it at the numeric options it will reset it at 50%, any other option will reset it to ignore.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Smart Spells use by default a 5 second loop to enquire your character status, this means that the auto cast will take from 0 to 5 seconds to detect changes in your character status and cast a spell, please keep that in mind. I programed this loop to be as fast as possible, I use a computer with an Intel i5 processor and an AMD Radeon HD 7750 graphic card to play the game, and the loop takes from 0.09 to 0.25 seconds, I think it is good enough.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img36/6269/c474.png[/img]\r<br />[size=3]This mod configuration page helps you add or remove Spell Rings, Spell combos and Spell Details. It also has the Smart Cast Manager and Customization menus to help you tweak the mod.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img543/7043/yn7p.png[/img]\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img607/5664/5zcj.jpg[/img][size=3]Spell Ring menu, up to 24 customizable rings[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]When you create a new Spell Ring, that ring will be added to your character&#39;s inventory and will be renamed after the spell you assign to it. These rings will help you cast spells instantaneously, avoiding completely the typical magic cast mechanic, for example, do you want to cast [color=#8C99C2][i]Oakflesh[/i][/color] but you don&#39;t want to switch your sword or shield for a spell?, well, if you have a Spell Ring with [color=#8C99C2][i]Oakflesh[/i][/color] spell assign to it, you only have to equip it and you will be ready to continue your fight. These rings will be unequipped automatically, they are just a way to trigger an event for the mod to cast spells. You can favorite and assign a hot key to any ring if you want a quick access to a spell, and you can spam these rings for instant cast as long as you have enough magicka for the spell.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]To remove a Spell Ring you can use the [color=#CCCCFF][i]default key[/i][/color] from the mod configuration page, it will clear the spell from the ring and the ring will be removed from your character&#39;s inventory as well.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Since version 1.1, every spell cast by the mod has its duration properly tracked down, meaning, if [color=#8C99C2][i]Oakflesh[/i][/color] is cast by a Smart Spell and it is cast again by a Spell Ring before the magic effects wear off, the mod will warn you that it is already active or in cooldown, this is a problem for spells that can fail and have a long duration, like [color=#8C99C2][i]Conjure Familiar[/i][/color], if you enable the [color=#CCCCFF][i]Can Be Recast[/i][/color] option, by default the Spell Ring will return some magicka back and will cast the spell again.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]There is a dispel ring, this ring will dispel all magic effects from your character cast by the mod, and by default it is going to return some magicka if you are in combat or the spell you are dispelling was cast in combat.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img856/2319/t69q.png[/img]\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img189/8610/8qm8.jpg[/img][size=3]Spell Combos menu, up to 10 combos[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]If you feel Spell Rings can break your game immersion or it is some kind of cheat, Spell Combos are the alternative. Just like any other spell, you still need to equip a Spell Combo to your character to cast it, but you can cast up to 3 spells at the same time. After you create a Spell Combo your character will have a new spell in the alteration section of the magic menu, and it will be named after the first spell of the combo. You can use the [color=#CCCCFF][i]default key[/i][/color] to clear spells from a combo, if you clear all the spells of a combo, it will be removed from your magic menu.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Since version 1.1, every spell cast by the mod has its duration properly tracked down, meaning, if [color=#8C99C2][i]Oakflesh[/i][/color] is cast by a Spell Ring or even a previous combo, and then try to cast it again, the mod will ignore that particular spell, this is a problem for spells that can fail, like [color=#8C99C2][i]Conjure Familiar[/i][/color], if you enable the [color=#CCCCFF][i]Can Be Recast[/i][/color] option, by default the Spell Combo will return some magicka back and will cast the spell again.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Spell Combos use a queue to cast spells since version 1.1, so any duplicated spell with a cooldown less than 0.7 seconds is going to be registered in this queue to be cast at a later time, this way the scripts are not overloaded with casting so many spells at the same time. By default, all spells have a 0.5 cooldown, but if you activate the [color=#CCCCFF][i]Extra Cooldown[/i][/color] option in the [color=#CCCCFF][i]Customization[/i][/color] menu, the cooldown will be the same as the casting time of each individual spell, meaning, a Spell Combo might start ignoring spells because they have a cooldown greater than 0.7 seconds. Be aware of this behavior.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img689/5828/jbul.png[/img]\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img856/6690/7rsp.jpg[/img][size=3]Spell Details menu, up to 14 spells[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]There are some troublesome spells that cannot be probe by normal means, for example, [color=#8C99C2][i]Voice of the Emperor[/i][/color], this section helps you to manually establish how to handle these kind of spells. As a bonus feature, you can also specify how much magicka the spell will consume, just in case you want to balance your gameplay.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img811/2921/ifkj.png[/img]\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img32/8613/qnlz.jpg[/img][size=3]Smart Spell Manager menu[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]This section helps you change the priority of Smart Spells automatic casting by moving spells up or down from the list of spells. You can delete unwanted spells too. The Smart Cast loop frequency can be adjusted or disabled, this last option is particularly useful when you engage in a fist fight with someone and casting magic spells is consider cheating. The reset option is just in case you consider the loop have messed up the spell durations of the automatic casting.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img571/1396/838j.png[/img]\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img547/6956/cbbz.jpg[/img][size=3]Customization menu[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]With the help of this menu you can change the way this mod behaves, you can adjust the magicka consumption to balance your gameplay, if you activate the [color=#CCCCFF][i]Combat Only[/i][/color] options the magicka is only going to be returned if the spell was cast in combat or you dispel it or recast it in combat.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Activating the [color=#CCCCFF][i]Extra Cooldown[/i][/color] option will make all spells have a cooldown equal to its casting time with a minimum of 0.5 seconds, preventing powerful spells with a long casting time to be spammed.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Enabling the [color=#CCCCFF][i]Combo Extra Cast Time[/i][/color] option will make any Spell Combo have a cast time (the time you spent charging a spell) equal to the sum of the cast time of each spell registered in the combo.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]If you have a mod that changes how long a game hour is (by default a game hour is 3 min long), you have to run the [color=#CCCCFF][i]Time Factor Adjustment[/i][/color], it is not a mod breaking problem, this adjustment is just to have an accurate magicka return of spells that use the game hours from Spell Details.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]As a bonus feature of this menu, the right side will display the stats captured by the Smart Cast loop, just to give you an idea of the data the loop is working on.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img801/6798/biw6.png[/img][/center]\r<br />[size=3]I did my best to program this mod to be compatible with any other mod. I tested it with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16225]Apocalypse Spell Package[/url], [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2275]Balanced Magic[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286]T3nd0s Skyrim Redone[/url].[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img843/6741/3rdp.png[/img]\r<br />FAQ\r<br />\r<br />[list][size=3][color=#BBFF77][*] How can I clear/reset/remove X option?[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]You can use the [color=#CCCCFF][i]default key[/i][/color] from the mod configuration pages.

It is an excellent companion to use with Smart Cast, just keep in mind the toggle feature can be a little tricky to use, if you cast the spell while it is still active, the spell effects will be dispelled, therefore, use Spell Rings instead of Smart Spells, this way you will have more control over the toggle feature.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34795]Learn Alchemy From Recipes[/url][/size][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34795][center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img24/1527/40i9.jpg[/img][/center][/url][size=3]Would you like your alchemy recipes to be more useful?, try this mod.[/size] \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][url=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url][/size]\r<br />[size=3]This mod creates a more dramatic and realistic mood to the Skyrim lighting.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28428]New Animation for Magic Casting[/url][/size]\r<br />[size=3]Very cool animations for magic casting, no more &#34;caveman&#34; animations from magic users.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img826/4248/po9k.png[/img][/center]\r<br />[b][size=3]Author:[/b] [color=#BBFF77]NeoRunek[/color][/size]\r<br />[b][size=3]Special Thanks to:[/b] [color=#BBFF77]Zeitz[/color][/size]",
