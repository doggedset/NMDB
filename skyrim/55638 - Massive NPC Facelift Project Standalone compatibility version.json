  "descriptionHtml": "A small edit to egpants excellent Massive NPC Facelift Project(in this case the vanilla versions of the others,followers and Dlc files)http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29535/?, my goal was to make it compatible with Consistent Older People,immersive college of winterhold and Cutting room floor, so I just removed the conflicting npc edits from Massive NPC Facelift Project(about 50 npc´s). Also changes from Unofficial Skyrim/Dragonborn Patch and weapon and armor fixes were forwarded. I merged the esp´s that could be merged and called them Facelift-Vanilla-Aio-Without Followers.esp, the other esp in the archive is still called Followers.esp.\r<br />\r<br />The requirements are Unofficial Skyrim/Hearthfire/Dragonborn Patch, and Weapons & Armor Fixes_Remade. You can of course use this mod without Consistent Older People(31 npc&#39;s)/immersive college of winterhold(16 npc&#39;s) /Cutting room floor(3 npc&#39;s).\r<br />\r<br />By the way dont forget to endorse egpants origional mod http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29535/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
