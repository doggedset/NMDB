  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][color=#ffff00]News[/color], hurray&#33; I&#39;ve just added an optimized .ini file. I&#39;ve made it for those who has a bit better computer. You have to change a few things inside of it before you can use it. I&#39;ve inculded a little guide so it will be easier. It uses ugrids to load 7.\r<br />Don&#39;t worry, if you already used ultra settings, this will acutally add to you&#39;r fps a bit.\r<br />\r<br />OOOOkay, so. A new lighting enchanting tool just came out for skyrim and i coulnd&#39;t wait to try it. It turned out that i actually made a mod out of it.\r<br />\r<br />The tool is named Reshade. It&#39;s something like sweetfx but a bit more than that. With this tool you can actually add effects like Lens Flare or Bloom (as i read it&#39;s better than the one that sweetfx uses) and things like that. It&#39;s not as advanced as the enb series, but more than sweetfx, so something in the middle.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6]Keep in mind that this mod uses [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/648/?][size=6]No Tint and Desaturation[/size] [size=4]by [b]Laicus\r<br />[/b][/size][/url][size=4]\r<br />[/size][/color][img]http://i62.tinypic.com/i3z6oh.jpg[/img]   \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Ah yea, about the mod. I made the mod, becauze this tool has a lot of potential. First when i tried it, i was amazed by the low fps hit i got.(Well it was basically nothing, but well speak about that a bit later.) Then i was amazed by the choices it gave me. And i guess that&#39;s all. :P [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]I tried to create a feeling that you are actually using an enb-like modification but i wanted to keep the feeling of the vanilla skyrim. Also try make it a happier and more forgiving place.(It just makes me feel sad when i see those harsh colors, but i love the atmosphere)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Umm... what else...[/size]\r<br />[size=3]Ah it&#39;s pretty hard to write down this whole decription, it requers so many thing to keep in mind. ehehehe....[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Ah yes, the presets. I created two presets: [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[u]The first one is the normal preset[/u][size=3] - This one basically will change the colors and add a bit of sharpness. I guess you already figured it out that this one is for the weaker pc-s like mine. This was my first version, witch gave the basics of the mod. The colors, the feeling, the atmosphere. This shouldn&#39;t effect you&#39;r performance but it may will. As i said earlier when i first tried, it didn&#39;t drop my fps one bit, but then it just sudently did. It&#39;s Crazy I Say&#33;. Anyway you should get around with it just fine. I have a 5 year old budget pc but i can still run it on 30-40 frames at hd. [/size][b][u]It drops something like 3 fps.[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[u]The second one is the higher preset[/u][size=3] - The higher preset it&#39;s the more preformance heavy one, as i think you already guessed. This one provides effects like [/size][b]Bloom, LENS FLARE and[/b][size=3] [/size][b]SMAA[/b][size=3]. [/size][b]This one will decrease your fps a lot more. [/b][size=3]The performance hit could be as hard as a weaker enb preset.( i&#39;m not even sure that it looks better than the normal one, but i wanted to make one anyway, but psssst) ^^[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]I also wanted to add ambient oclusion and dof to the higher preset, but te tool is still in beta, and these two effects are pretty buggy yet. Maybe in a future update?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Last one i think is the [/size][color=#e69138]installation[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]1. First you have to download the [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/648/?]No Tint and Desaturation[/url][size=3] and install it.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]2. Then download one of my presets, and extract everything to the folder where is you&#39;r TESV.exe is located.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]3. Make sure that in your .ini the bDefferredShadows=0 and the bFloatPointRenderTarget=0.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]4. [/size][color=#b6b6b6]Turn all the way down[/color][size=3] your [/size][color=#ffff00]brightness[/color][size=3] settings in game.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]4.After that i think maybe you should play and enjoy or something like that.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]By the way, maybe you should also download a new sun model. Vanilla sometimes looks weird, but mostly allright.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#cfe2f3][size=5]Official FAQ[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]-Does the night vision work with this mod?\r<br />\r<br />-Yes, it does.\r<br />\r<br />HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\r<br />\r<br />-Is this compatible with the enb series?\r<br />\r<br />-No, it dosen&#39;t.\r<br />[/b]\r<br />[size=3]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]- Did you used some type of translating program to write down all of this? [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]-Naa, this is all self thought language knowledge right out from skyrim&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]-Google translate would have been better....[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]___________________________________________________________[/size]\r<br />[size=3]- C.A.N Y.O.U R.E.A.D T.H.I.S?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]-Ummm, you should think about something harder maybe. But i aprishiate you&#39;r attempt of being super intelligent.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]___________________________________________________________[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]-Do you really ask these questions from yourself? I mean no one has seen the mod yet. Are you crazy or something?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]-Well, umm, noo? I..I just...you know, i tried to..... JUST LEAVE ME ALONE, OKAY &#33;?[/size]",
