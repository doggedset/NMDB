  "descriptionHtml": "Updated: Made the cutie mark a little better.\r\n\r\nChanged the color of the robe to be blue, added the universal symbol of love and magic onto the back.\r\n\r\nMy first mod. :)\r\nTried to improve the quality of the base texture, but didn\\'t really help at all I think.\r\nAdded Twilight Sparkle\\'s mark, blended it in a bit.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thought I would share in case anyone else is interested.\r\n\r\nNo hate/troll softly please.\r\n\r\nA couple of the images taken with one of the FXAA injector mods active, that\\'s why its darker.\r\n\r\nINSTALL\r\n\r\nExtract the textures folder.\r\nDrop it into your Skyrim Data folder.  (Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/Data)\r\n\r\nThis only adds 1 texture file under textures/clothes/magejourneyman/f/robes.dds\r\nDelete it to uninstall.\r\n\r\n------------\r\nFree Use\r\nFeel free to reuse, reupload, repack, and anything else you\\'d like.
