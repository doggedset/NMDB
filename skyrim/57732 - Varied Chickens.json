More varied chickens&#33; The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== ABOUT ==[/color][/size]\r<br />I am a huge chicken fan, and some time ago I reinstalled my Skyrim, losing an old mod I used to have and that now has been removed from the workshop. It was called &#34;Chickens of Skyrim&#34; by Treguld and it added several breeds/colors of chicken [i](barred, black, white...) [/i]to some places around Skyrim. Nothing more, nothing less. So today I decided to take matters into my own hands and rebuild the mod from scratch.\r<br />\r<br />Version 3.0 has the mod bundled into a neat BSA and replaces [url=http://i.imgur.com/ywpDuLu.jpg]my ugly rooster[/url] from version 2.0 [i](no longer available)[/i] with [url=http://i.imgur.com/P4YzHCh.jpg]Qasiermo&#39;s model[/url] from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17723/?]Birds of Skyrim[/url], which looks ten million times better [i](thank you for the permission&#33;).[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s a small comparison video in Riverwood. Thanks, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/8749168/?]SpartanX025[/url]&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]9ONClwzeOfc[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I know there are big overhaul mods such as Automatic Variants that add all sorts of new animals, but all I wanted was to have the chickens. I made this for myself, and I&#39;m leaving it here in case someone else may want to use it as well. I didn&#39;t get to take many pictures, so feel free to upload your own&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF][size=5]== WHERE ARE THEY? ==[/size][/color]\r<br />I hand-placed these new chickens around Skyrim, in places where chickens were already around. They yield the regular chicken meat, and you can choose whether to have them essential or killable. Choose one .esp from the download and enable it. DO NOT USE BOTH&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF][size=5]== WILL THERE BE DLC SUPPORT? ==[/size][/color]\r<br />Probably not. It becomes hard to juggle so many versions of a mod (for Hearthfire, Dragonborn, for both, and then both essential and killable versions...), so to compensate, you can find a new spell book outside Hod and Gerdur&#39;s House in Riverwood. Use this spell to place one of my new chickens (chosen at random) at any location you want. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF][size=5]== RECOMMENDED MODS ==[/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72866/?]Chicken Butthurt Minimizer AKA Immersive Eggs[/url] by ShinGouki will make eggs in nests look a lot smaller and less like ostrich eggs&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF][size=5]== INSTALLATION ==[/size][/color]\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the esp of your choice (essential or killable chickens) through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. \r<br />[size=5]\r<br />[color=#1E90FF]== CREDITS ==[/color][/size]\r<br />Textures by Bellyache (from the amazing [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3621/?]Bellyaches Animal and Creature Pack[/url]), my good friend  [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/schlurbi]Schlürbi[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17723/?]Qasiermo[/url], and yours truly.\r<br />\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/donate/?mode=straight&id=2543917][img]http://i.imgur.com/V6qmsU9.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
