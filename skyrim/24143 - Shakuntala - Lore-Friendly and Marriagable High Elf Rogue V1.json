  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=4]A NOTE REGARDING THIS AND MY OTHER MODS: Hola! It's been a very long time, but I have returned to Skyrim. I'm currently in the process of getting my personal game set up how I like it, which includes going back to my original mods and attempting to see what I can do with them. I've decided to start with the one mod I did that most people did not like. I've put a new emphasis on her looks because that's what most people blasted her on originally. As you can see, I think here in 2018 I have done a much better job.\n<br />\n<br />She currently has no release date as I am still setting up shop, but soon I should have her done and tested and will prepare a proper release.\n<br />\n<br />[s]I will not be putting out any new versions of Lydia The Unburdened, Shakuntala or Visarra until I upgrade my PC sometime early next year. I will not return to Skyrim until that time (I still have Dragonborn and Falskaar to finish so I have plenty reason to return) so I can play / run in full Ultra settings. I will update with more info when available. Thank you for your use of my mods![/s][/size][s]\n<br />[/s]\n<br />SHAKUNTALA THE ROGUE[/b]\n<br />------------------------------------------\n<br />VERSION 1.0\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=red][size=3]NOTE: YOU WILL NEED APACHII SKY HAIR OR YOUR GAME WILL CRASH.[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />REQUIRES- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii Sky Hair[/url]\n<br />\n<br />This mod is best experienced with the following mods (my screenshots use these):\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666]Caliente's CBBE[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24273]Ethereal Elven Overhaul[/url] (Elven races by default in Skyrim, are not very pretty)\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMPATIBILITY:[/b] Skyrim base game, no expansions required.\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow][b]QUICK-LIST OF FEATURES:[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.0\n<br />\n<br />+High Elf Rogue\n<br />+Lore-friendly, sticks with Bethesda's visual style of elves.\n<br />+Dual-Wielding\n<br />+No morality and no remorse\n<br />+Completely loyal\n<br />+Marriagable\n<br />+Increased foot speed lets her keep up with the fastest Dragonborn.\n<br />+Knows the \"Muffle\" spell, can be taught other spells via mods like U.F.O.\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow]SHAK IN MOTION:[/color]\n<br />[youtube]0u_WiNyK-F4[/youtube]\n<br />This is an older video, and will be updated as time permits.\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow][b]DETAILED FEATURES:[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.0\n<br />\n<br />Based on a long-time friend of mine and her character, adds a beautiful high elf rogue to the game named Shakuntala. She will dual-wield and has no remorse, will dispatch whoever you tell her to, and doesn't care what you do. Perfect companion for a thief, a warlock or any other shady-style Dragonborn.\n<br />\n<br />She prefers light armors, but will wear whatever you tell her to. She comes equipped with a plain set of clothes and can be found in the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. If you fancy her, she will marry you. She has a increased speed setting and will seem to move in a blur at times, as a true master rogue should. She comes equipped with the \"Muffle\" spell, but can learn other ones if you have a companion mod like U.F.O. installed.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Try my other mods![/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]LYDIA THE UNBURDENED 3.0[/b] - Turn Lydia into a 7ft tall Nordic Barbarian.\n<br />@Skyrim Nexus: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20107]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20107[/url]\n<br />@Steam Workshop: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=80815442]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=80815442[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[b]VISARRA[/b] - Lovely orc warrior companion.
