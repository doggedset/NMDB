  "descriptionHtml": "Game:Skyrim\r<br />Mod Name:The Legend of Zelda: The Master Sword\r<br />Version:0.2 Beta\r<br />Contact Info:jacob_jenks@yahoo.com\r<br />Author(s):Jewfish\r<br />This is a master sword mod I had a while back, but it didn&#39;t have a scabbard that worked, and nobody really liked the textures either but i didn&#39;t change that because I do, if you want to make them better, go ahead and do it, upload it too, everyone has my permissions, just credit me for the original mesh. The sword can be located somewhere in the Falkreath hold, you will know when you get close if you have your music enabled ;). Credit for the scabbard mesh goes to chief-01 from deviantart, i just retextured it to have a golden look instead of grayish and make it look old and worn down, but the sword looks pristine. I really hope you guys enjoy this weapon, im hoping to make a shield soon too, if time permits.\r<br />\r<br />Update****** Fixed the problem where people could not find the sword or shield, just download the no sword and shield fix. Ocarina of Time Version is at hand. Nearly done. Just a few more things need to be added.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:unzip into your Skyrim data directory or use the nexus mod manager, whichever you are more comfortable with\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation: Delete the data files\r<br />\r<br />Change Log:\r<br />26/5/2013: Initial release\r<br />28/5/2013: Added my good friend Overmind5000&#39;s Hylian Shield all credit for the mesh and texture goes to him.\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues:All known bugs fixed.\r<br />\r<br />Developers: jewfish\r<br />\r<br />Thanks To:\r<br />jewfish- model and textures for the Master Sword\r<br />Overmind5000- model and textures for the Hylian Shield\r<br />Nintendo- my childhood\r<br />Bethesda- Being the sh*t and letting people mod their games\r<br />Nexus staff- Allowing people to download my crap\r<br />Users- downloading my crap",
