  "summary": "Adds a new shout based on Marked for Death using audio from My Little Pony: FiM",
  "descriptionHtml": "After a long struggle figuring out how to make the simple script I wanted, the mod is finally ready. Unlike my previous mods this one doesn\\'t replace the existing Marked for Death but adds a new shout entirely. It behaves exactly like the shout and when a dragon soul is spent on one they will both level up. All this does is adds an alternative shout to use.\r\n\r\nIt does what Marked for Death does, but it does so with alternate audio, nothing else. Any mods that modify the effect of Marked for Death will also affect this mod since it uses the same spell effect as Marked for Death.\r\n\r\nTo actually get the shout you need to use Marked for Death. That\\'s it, no special activator to find and worry about.\r\n\r\nKrii - *squee*\r\nKrii Lun - *Fluttershy*\r\nKrii Lun Aus -  *Fluttershy*  *squee*\r\n\r\n[url=http://youtu.be/yKYmpzNQG-U]The shout in action[/url]\r\n\r\nAs you might have guessed I took the high road and didn\\'t use Pinkamena, instead Fluttershy use\\'s her adorableness to melt the hearts of your enemies making them easier to kill.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\nEither use the nexus manager or extract the zip file to your Skyrim data folder and activate in the launcher, same as any other .esp mod. Uninstallation is a matter of unchecking the box and if want it gone entirely then delete the files MarkedForSquee.esp and MarkedForSquee.bsa. The default directory is \r\nC::\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nAlternatively the mod can be found on Steam [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1281028] here[/url]\r\n\r\nHere are the shout mods I have already released, expect them to be updated for the Steam workshop at some point.\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3732]Fus Ro Yay[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3783]Fluttershy loves Animal Allegiance[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3985]Trollestia Commands you to Catch on Fire[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4902]LUNA SHOUTS AT TIME AND IT OBEYS[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5201]Whirlwind Dash[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5981]Timber Wolves are a Howlin\\'[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll audio is taken from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic ",
