  "descriptionHtml": "[b]This is a racemenu preset for the female nord that is based on the likeness of Bounty Suicide of the goth/tattoo modeling organization &#34;suicide girls.&#34; It does not include all of her many complex tattoos because I haven&#39;t the faintest clue on how to draw all of her tats on a female body texture, and I am also not a skilled artist. But if you would be willing to do that, be my guest&#33;\r<br /> \r<br />There are three files, the first one (Michaeline.jslot) which is the modern general version of her, and the 2nd file (Michaeline SG.jslot) was made to make her appearance look like she did in a very specific photoshoot of hers for suicide girls, and the third file is a set of custom eyebrows that were cut out of an actual photograph of Bounty and carefully crafted into eyebrow textures. One of the femalebrow_## files in the following directory computer/local disk/programfilesx86/steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data/textures/actors/character/femalebrows.[/b]\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#00ff00]===INSTALLATION===\r<br />[b]Step 1. After downloading this file, go into the directory [i]my computer/local disk/program files x86/steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data/skse/plugins/chargen/presets[/i] and copy and paste the file Michaeline.jslot into there. [/b]NOTE: before the &#34;chargen&#34; directory is created, you have to save a preset in racemenu, so just go into the racemenu screen and then go into presets, then press F5 to save any preset and create the directory.\r<br /> \r<br />[b]Step 2. Boot the game up, go into racemenu by typing &#34;showracemenu&#34; in the console, then click &#34;presets&#34; on the bar in the top right of the screen, and press F9 to load presets and load &#34;Michaeline.jslot&#34; (it should be in there) and voila, there you are&#33;[/b]\r<br /> \r<br />[b]Step 3. To install her eyebrows, go into the following directory[/b] [b]computer/local disk/programfilesx86/steam/steamapps/common/skyri/data/textures/actors/character/femalebrows and drag the femalebrow_02.dds file contained in the download into the open directory screen for skyrim&#39;s female eyebrow textures, click &#34;move and replace&#34; to replace the existing texture. Be sure to back up the original beforehand unless you want to lose them.[/b][/color]\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ff0000][b]===REQUIREMENTS===\r<br />*SKSE 1.7.3 or above\r<br />*Racemenu (latest version)\r<br />*Xenius Character Enhancement Compilation Pack &lt;---- XCE Compilation Pack is not 100% necessary but is strongly recommended&#33;[/b]\r<br />[b]*Caliente&#39;s Beautiful Bodies Edition (CBBE) OR Dimonized UNP Skinny (UNP) whichever you prefer[/b]\r<br />[b]*The Eyes Of Beauty\r<br />*True Brows\r<br />*Apachii SkyHair Females 1.5[/b]\r<br /> \r<br />[b]Make 100% sure that you have the above mods installed before playing this or else this will not work properly&#33; [i]Follow the instructions very carefully&#33;[/i][/b][/color]\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#00ffff][b][b]===Optional/Recommended===\r<br />Sexy Vanilla Female Armor for UNP and SevenBase with BBP[/b][/b]\r<br />[b]Red Dress UNP[/b]\r<br />[b]HN66s Golden Earrings[/b]\r<br />[b]Ashara Dimonized Dragon Dress And Jewelry[/b]\r<br />[b]Dovabling Jewelry Replacer[/b]\r<br />[b]Immersive Jewelry[/b]\r<br />[b][b]Bracelets By Ezuka\r<br />Sexy Swimsuit and bikinis for CBBE\r<br />Wedding Rings By Ezuka\r<br />FNIS Sexy Walk/FNIS 5.2[/b][/b][/color]",
