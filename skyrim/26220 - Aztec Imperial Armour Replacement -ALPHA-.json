  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is for a University Project and this is my testing phase - I would appreciate it if you could take the time after testing the mod to fill in a short feedback form for me located here - http://goo.gl/E6GvU\r\n\r\nThis is a mod which replaces the Mesh and Texture of the imperial Light armour set - all except the Body Armour (which I am finding difficult as this is my first mod and I\\'m not sure how to do the rigging). \r\nThe Mod currently replaces the on-character view of the armour but the Ground Models haven\\'t been finished due to difficulties with collision. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much for taking the time folks!",
