  "descriptionHtml": "A strange door has appeared at the Throat of the World. A door to where? To the place above the throat, of course - the eyes!\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a door to the Throat of the World that takes you to the Eyes of the World. The Eyes of the World is a floating platform above the waterfalls of Riverwood. You get a very nice view of Skyrim and a chair for you to sit on. You can also jump into the river for a nice, long jump. Watch out for the rocks!\r\n\r\nI have added a fast travel marker for you to travel there easily. To ensure you don't get to the Throat of the World too early in the game, I have locked the door and placed the key at the Throat of the World in front of the door. \r\n\r\nThere is a chest there for storage. I've also placed my four favorite books up there in the chest for a good read if you have time (Beggar, Thief, Warrior, and King).\r\n\r\nThere are no requirements for this mod and it shouldn't conflict with anything. The map marker for the Eyes of the World is a bit weird, you will have to rotate the map a bit.\r\n\r\nI am open to suggestions. Enjoy this mod!\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso available on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=194496441]Steam Workshop[/url].",
