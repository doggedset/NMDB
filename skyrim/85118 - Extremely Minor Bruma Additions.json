  "summary": "Adds some Bruma items to the inns of two most Empire-connected cities of Skyrim, and places some generic NPC&#39;s in Bruma.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a minor modmod that makes innkeepers and general traders of Falkreath and Solitude (the most Imperial-connected cities of Skyrim)* offer some limited food and weapon items from BS: Bruma. I wanted to keep the unique feel of Cyrodiil, hence the additions are quite humble. It also adds four generic &#34;citizen&#34; NPC&#39;s to wander around Bruma, since with InconNPC and 3dnpc in Skyrim, Bruma looked relatively empty. \r<br />\r<br />*Falkreath is close to the border and, if I&#39;m not mistaken, was considered a part of Cyrodiil back in some previous era. Solitude, of course, is the center of Imperial power in Skyrim.",
