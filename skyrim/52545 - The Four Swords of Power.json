  "descriptionHtml": "Legends tell of four swords a long time ago in a time before time. These swords spanned the power of the elements Fire, Ice, Air, and Earth. The swords where so powerful and well built that they outdated their owners. \r<br />One day one of the original swords was found many eras after it&#39;s owner had died. The sword was found stuck in a stone, that sword the sword of Ice received the name Excalibur and was claimed by the legendary King Arthur. Arthur was later mortally wounded by mordred who wielded the sword of Fire, Clarent. Arthur died soon there after. \r<br />Around this time the sword of Earth was bestowed apon Roland, The Paladin of Charlemagne the sword given to him by an angel received the name Durendal. When Roland neared his death bed he tried to destroy Durendal for he feared that it would be to powerful in the wrong hands. Legends do not say if he was successful. \r<br />The sword of Air, Joyeuse was also supposedly given to it&#39;s owner by an angel, the owner was Charlemagne. \r<br />No one knows what happened to the swords but some speculate that all four owner&#39;s where locked in the same tomb along with an army of undead soldiers to protect the swords form the wrong hands. This Tomb is called the Aether dungeon. The Aether is the power of Time legends say the if the four swords of power are combined they create a sword of ultimate power. \r<br />Hello everyone this is my first mod it&#39;s in The starting stages but i hope you will enjoy it as much as i enjoyed making it. The game Adds some Elemental swords Unfortunately i suck with 3d modeling and texturing so don&#39;t expect any custom meshes/ textures. this mod took me around 12hrs for the dungeon and around 2hrs for the items \r<br />if you feel that something should be added please tell me i based the swords off of the Secrets of the immortal Nicholas Flamel book series. also please leave a comment if you encounter a bug and i will do my best to fix the bug. Warning This level May cause uncontrollable rage quitting: The dungeon is EXTREMELY Hard And includes a maze that was pretty hard for me and i have the solution. also the treasure room is filled with draugrs and includes four custom draugr bosses wielding Some overpowered swords, LITERALLY the dungeon is nearly IMPOSSIBLE&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; \r<br />It is even hard to get inside Master leveled lock&#33;&#33;\r<br />[size=5][b]This Mod is no longer being updated, I simply do not have the ability to create different models and textures.[/b][/size]",
