Problems are if he sits down he glitches into the chair and grows when he uses the cooking pot. But I hope those little problems wont keep you away from your own little housecat. He can be used as storage (just pickpocket him).\r\nHe\\'s got the voice of a dragon and is really how a dwarf should be.\r\nHope you enjoy!\r\n",
