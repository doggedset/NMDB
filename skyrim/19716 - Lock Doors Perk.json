  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]Lock Doors Perk[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[u]Description[/u]\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t quite find what I was looking for in regards to mods locking doors, there\\'s one that does it through magic but I wanted a simpler and easier approach. So what this does through a perk is give you the option of locking doors. You\\'ll need to be sneaking and you\\'ll need at least one lockpick in your inventory, then approach any door and you get the option to lock it or open it as normal. It locks to novice level.\r\n\r\nThe perk branches off from Locksmith (SSS), and has a requirement of 80 lockpicking and of course Locksmith.\r\n\r\nThat\\'s it. Try not to lock everyone inside their own homes ;) Best used by sneaky types in dungeons who eschew the use of magic.\r\n\r\nIf you want to add the perk in console just type [u]help locksmith[/u], it\\'ll be one of the two. It\\'ll be something like 04000D62.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Un/Install[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nUse NMM, I don\\'t use it but it should work ok. To install manually put the esp. file into the data folder and the pex. file from the scripts folder into your own script folder. \r\n\r\nTo uninstall, delete those two files.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Creds[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nBeth\r\nNexus",
