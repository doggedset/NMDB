  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size= +4]Minimalist Renaming[/size][/center]\r<br />[center][size= +1]for better sorting[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size= +2]Better Food Edition[/size][/center]\r<br />[heading]Description[/heading]\r<br />This was a very quick and simple mod to help organize items together, I didn&#39;t want the whole line taken up, so i simplified to one or two letters.\r<br />\r<br />I separated food, since there are many food mods out there and renaming them would have overwritten the new values. \r<br />\r<br />The values for the food in this mod used Wke113&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32911/?]Better Food[/url] as a starting point. I added support for from all DLC&#39;s, and modified some of the value&#39;s though.\r<br />\r<br />In essence, most raw ingredients like vegetables and flour only restore 5 points of health. Most raw meat will restore Health and Stamina for 15-30 depending on size and cooked food will restore about double the raw amount. More complex recipes have a larger benefit. \r<br />\r<br />There are a few recipes that are quite powerful, restoring 2 points of health, stamina or magicka for up to 15 minutes, these are general made in an oven, since i believe they are rather hard to find. \r<br />\r<br />Some of the values are rather random, this mod is not meant to be realistic, just to make food an alternative to potions for some people. \r<br />\r<br />As for the renaming, All food is prefaced with either, F: U: or F: C: for Food, cooked or uncooked.\r<br />I also added what the food increases, so if you have a lot of food, you can decide quickly what to use.\r<br />\r<br />The letters in Parenthese mean \r<br />H - restores a flat mount of health\r<br />S - Restores a flat amount of Stamina\r<br />M - Restores a flat amount of Magicka\r<br />\r<br />one of these with a + means that stat is fortified.\r<br />one of these a &gt; means that stats gets restored over time.\r<br />a + by itself means some other stat is fortified. like Bows.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Other Mods by Me:[/heading]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54133/?]Magical Fortify Gear[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54995/?]Minimalist Renaming[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54285/?]Massive Cloud Storage Network[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54848/?]Massive Cloud Storage Network - Functional Homes Support[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54896/?]Massive Cloud Storage Network- Whiterun \r<br />",
