  "descriptionHtml": "   I made this tiny mod a while ago and never posted it.  Its basically a spell tome that teaches you the &#39;hide other&#39; spell.  Cast this spell at any npc and they turn invisible for 30 or 60 seconds (dont remember which).  The book is just to your left on the floor when you enter Dragonsreach.  Also, if you use my breezehome mod, there will be a couple of copies on your bed.\r<br />\r<br />   I made this in response to the kid thats always asking you to turn him invisible.  Now you can&#33;  Use at your own risk, as I imagine that there are circumstances when this could mess the game up, so be smart about it.\r<br />\r<br />   I had planned to find a better way to introduce the book into the world, but never got around to it.  If anyone else wishes to do so, feel free.",
