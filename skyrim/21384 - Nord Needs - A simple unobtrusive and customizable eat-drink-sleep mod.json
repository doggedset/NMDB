  "modName": "Nord Needs - A simple unobtrusive and customizable eat-drink-sleep mod",
  "summary": "Adds an unobtrusive and uncomplicated eating, drinking and sleeping needs system to skyrim. Most aspects can now be modified via an in-game spell.",
  "descriptionHtml": "**I no longer mod or play skyrim, mod is unsupported. Use or modify it as you wish and at your own risk**\r\n\r\nSo you just killed 3 dragons, decapitated dozens of bandits, and spent the better part of a day yelling so hard that it knocked people over. Your needs mod is now telling you that you\\'re hungry and thirsty, so you eat an apple and down some mead, now you\\'re fighting fit to do it all again! Or maybe you woke up in an inn ten minutes ago, you\\'re now sneaking through a nordic ruin and your sleep mod says your tiredness is affecting your sneak skill. Maybe you just ate 70 potatos but your hunger didn\\'t go down at all because you were past some arbitrary hunger threshold. Maybe you just emptied a bottle of mead and got back an empty bottle that weighed the same amount as the full bottle. Maybe you just got a message that said your badass Dovahviking is not getting enough cod liver oil and probably isn\\'t going to make his weight loss goal this month.\r\n\r\nI made this mod because I was unsatisfied with one or more aspects of all the eat-drink-sleep mods that I tried. My main goals were as follows:\r\n1) No micromanaging.\r\n2) Not obtrusive to gameplay.\r\n3) Make cooking worthwhile\r\n4) Make need status updates unambiguous with respect to the level of that need.\r\n5) Detrimental, but not overpowering, debuffs that don\\'t overlap.\r\n6) Eat enough to fuel Dovahviking badassery.\r\n\r\nAs of version 1.5 the mod has been completely rewritten under the hood and most aspects are now customizable through a spell you get upon installing the mod. You can now easily tweak this mod however you like to suit your individual needs. The specific values mentioned in the following section are only the defaults.\r\n\r\nThe specifics:\r\nNeed caps: all needs are measured in hours you can go without addressing that need before it begins to affect you. All needs cap out at 48 hours, so you can go up to 2 full in game days between having to deal with needs and not feel any ill effects. Current need levels display automatically every 6 in-game hours.\r\n\r\nHunger: 3 types of food: snack, small meal and large meal. Snacks restore .5 hours of hunger. All raw meat counts as a snack to encourage cooking. Small meals restore 2 hours of hunger, large meals restore 5 hours of hunger. Cooking will always be worth it in terms of the amount of hunger ingredients restore vs what the product restores. Debuff lowers heal rate and carry weight.\r\n\r\nThirst: Three types of drinks: small, large and special. Small are common drinks like alto wine, they restore 3 hours of thirst. Large are rarer drinks like Honningbrew mead, they restore 6 hours of thirst. Special drinks are only skooma and sleeping tree sap, these restore 24 hours of thirst. Stew and soups count as a small drink in addition to food (with the exception of Elsweyr Fondue, which is a large drink to make up for its comparatively large cooking cost.) Debuff lowers stamina and shout recovery rate.\r\n\r\nSleep: any amount of sleep restores sleep to maximum value (I did it this way so I could go to an inn and just sleep until whenever the next morning was.) Debuff lowers magica regen rate and move speed.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\ndrop the contents of the rar into your data folder and then activate the esp in your skyrim launcher, or just use NMM.\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\nDisable the mod through the config spell\\'s disable/enable menu to avoid a bug where the debuff effects will persist permanently after the mod is disabled. This is a problem with the game engine and not with the mod. After disabling in game, deactivate/delete the mod files. I would recommend preforming a clean save to be safe.\r\n\r\nConflicts and support:\r\nMay conflict with other mods that alter food or drinks. Won\\'t work with non-vanilla foods or drinks. That being said, I\\'m making this mod open source so you can change it to suit your needs, and in addition I do plan to continue to support it. If you want a reasonable small tweak, I can probably upload a version for you, just request in the comments. If you want it to work with your favorite non-vanilla food mod, I can probably make a compatibility patch if you request one.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\nv1.5\r\n-Mod completely rewritten under the hood to allow for in-game customization.\r\n-Upon Installing the mod you will receive a config spell under powers. Use it to check your current need stati, as well as edit a slew of mod values.\r\n-The following scripts have been merged into a single, more streamlined script. You can delete them if installing manually: AllDrink, LargeDrink, MajorFood, MedFood, MinorFood, SmallDrink\r\nv1.1\r\n-Buffed drinking from 2.5 hours for all to 3 hours minimum, and added two larger drink tiers.\r\n-added drink effects to soups",
