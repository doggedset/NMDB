  "summary": "Adds a Ancient Falmer Beacon South of Dushnik Yal, located in a untouched and prime location to place a hidden kingdom located on the Skyrim/Hammerfell border up in the Mountains.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was running about exploring one day up in the craggy Reach until I stumbled upon a way up the mountainside behind Dushnik Yal and that Arkanthaz Dwemer Ruin included in Dawnguard and I came across a decent sized empty area located in the mountains that has a few trees and alot of idea terrain to place a hidden kingdom.\r\nLocated here:\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/26942-3-1353017130.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThis mod also places a nice Beacon of Auriel in this area with map marker and everything plus makes the Ancient Falmer armor included in 3 containers and also make\\'s Gelebor\\'s paldronless armor playable.\r\n\r\nI really am interested in making a Falmer Fortress of somekind but there is lack of resources to make an adiquate one so I think I will look into the Ayield resources to counter this.\r\n\r\nhave a look fellow modders and see this prime and ideal place to put a new player abode, castle or kingdom of the Falmer.",
