  "modName": "Dragon Priest Masks for Mages",
  "summary": "[REQ]Made the all the Dragon Priest Masks friendlier for mages.",
  "descriptionHtml": "It has been probably made by someone else before, can\\'t say I checked much. Also this mod was a request by my cousin (why I haven\\'t checked to see if it was made before), won\\'t say I approve of it entirely.\r\n\r\nBasically, what this mod does, is removing any armor rating from the masks (light/heavy) and giving them 0 armor, this way they won\\'t distrupt the Mage Armor perk, making them cloth-like and reducing their weight to 1lb to match it. Also fixed Morokei\\'s enchantment, though if you have USP, then it makes no difference. And before you ask, yes all the masks got no armor rating (though if you play as a mage it shouldn\\'t make much difference), even though some make absolutely no sense, but hey I made it to his liking.\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Requirements:[/color]\r\nSkyrim 1.8+\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Installation:[/color]\r\n\r\nUse NMM or other app thingy you use to manage your mods, or if you prefer to do it manually place the .esp file from the archive into your \\\"\\\\\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\\\" folder. Remember to check if the mod is activated before starting the game.\r\n\r\n[b][color=red]Please read:[/color]\r\n\r\nIf you want the masks to look like in the pictures above, than I strongly recommend using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15052]\\\"Apophysis Dragon Priest Masks WiP\\\"[/url] by pondcypress, probably the best retexture for the Dragon Priest Masks - remember to thank him and endorse him for his great work. Otherwise the masks are vanilla.[/b]\r\n\r\n[color=red]Changes:[/color]\r\nVersion 1.1:\r\nFigured some of the masks weren\\'t really appropriate for mages despite the fact that they were \\\"cloth\\\"-like\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Hevnoraak[/color]: received a 50% magicka regeneration buff (still retains original enchantment)\r\n[color=orange]Krosis[/color]: received Conjuration/Illusion enchantment opposed to Lockpick/Archery, retains Alchemy\r\n[color=orange]Morokei[/color]: received 20% shout cooldown, retains the magicka regeneration\r\n[color=orange]Rahgot[/color]: swapped stamina increase with magicka\r\n[color=orange]Volsung[/color]: 50% magicka regeneration instead of carry weight\r\n\r\nThe rest of the masks haven\\'t been changed (yet). They are also ready to be used with the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21295]Circlets with Helms/Hoods[/url] by Morzie. Be sure to install this mod after it (and after the unofficial patches), so you\\'ll received these enchantments/AR.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0:\r\n-Initial release: Same as the vanilla masks except there\\'s no armor rating on any of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Recommended Mods:[/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15052]Apophysis Dragon Priest Masks WiP[/url] by pondcypress\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21295]Circlets with Helms[/url] by Morzie\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Credits and Thanks:[/color]\r\nBethesda for making Skyrim and releasing the CK.\r\nThe Nexus community and everyone that enjoyed this tiny mod.\r\n",
