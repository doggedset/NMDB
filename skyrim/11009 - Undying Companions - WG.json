  "descriptionHtml": "Makes all companions essential, meaning they cannot die by friendly or hostile damage. Exceptions: Erandur, Cicero and Eola.\r\n\r\nVersion: 1.1\r\nAuthor: WarriorG0el\r\n\r\nI love clear feedback, good or bad! Let me know if there\\'s anything else you\\'d like to see in this mod, or any bugs that I can fix. \r\n\r\nI think I caught all the exceptions, but if you have specific issues with a companion that needs to be unflagged as \\\"Essential\\\" to complete a quest, post a comment, and I\\'ll do my best to have a fix posted within 24 hours.\r\n\r\nTO COMPLETE BOETHIAH\\'S CALLING - SOLUTION 1: If you do not kill either Erandur or Eola for their respective quests, they may be sacrificed. Their related quests are Waking Nightmare in Dawnstar (Erandur), and The Taste of Death in Markarth (Eola).\r\n\r\nSOLUTION 2: Simply load the game without the mod activated to allow you to kill the follower you really want to kill, and then reactivate it after the deed is done. That way, as many followers as possible can remain essential. \r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n1.0 (Release) - All obtainable companions (based on this list and comments below http://www.gamersheroes.com/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-companion-guide) have been flagged as Essential, meaning they cannot be killed, even by the player. Exceptions (because of potential issues with quests): Erandur, Cicero and Eola.\r\n1.1 - Torvar has been added to the list of essential companions. (Many thanks to Woodsman from the Steam Workshop for seeing the omission!)\r\n\r\nComplete list of Essential tagged Companions: \r\n\r\nLydia\r\nCalder\r\nIona\r\nAgris the Bulwark\r\nJordis the Sword-Maiden\r\nAela the Huntress\r\nAthis\r\nFarkas\r\nRia\r\nNjada Stonearm\r\nVilkas\r\nJ\\'Zargo\r\nOnmund\r\nBrelyna Maryon\r\nBerland\r\nVorstag\r\nJenassa\r\nMarcurio\r\nStenvar\r\nErik the Slayer\r\nAranea\r\nLob\r\nOgal\r\nUgor\r\nAdelasia Vendici\r\nAhtar the Jailer\r\nCosnach\r\nBorgakh\r\nBenor\r\nGhorbash\r\nUthgerd the Unbroken\r\nSven\r\nFaendal\r\nRoggi Knot-Beard\r\nDerkeethus\r\nAnnekke Crag-Jumper\r\nMjoll the Lioness\r\nKharjo\r\nGolldir\r\nIllia\r\nTorvar\r\nDark Brotherhood Initiate (already flagged as Essential without this mod)\r\nVigilance (thanks shill6451!)\r\nMeeko (thanks Badger The J from the Steam Workshop for catching the omission!)\r\n\r\nThanks very much!\r\n\r\nOther WG Mods:\r\n\r\nItem Rewards For Bounties:  Adds a random leveled item as a reward upon quest completion, and changes bounty rewards to 250 gold for Bandits/Forsworn, 500 gold for Giants and 750 gold for dragons. \r\n\r\nBreezehome Enchanting Table - Adds an enchanting table to Breezehome right next to the Alchemy Lab. Will only show up once Alchemy Lab decoration is purchased from Proventus in Dragonsreach. Mood lighting included.\r\n\r\nEnhanced Alchemy XP - Slightly increases Alchemy XP gain rate (20%) to balance with other skills such as Smithing. Still balanced, more fun.\r\n\r\nImproved Imperial Racial Abilities - Changes Voice of the Emperor ability to a +10 Speech bonus for people like me who never use Voice of the Emperor when they roll Imperial characters.\r\n\r\nGIANT Animals - Makes all animals, plus trolls, 3x bigger than normal. Just subscribe and walk around Skyrim - it\\'s GREAT for kicks.\r\n\r\nSkyscraper Giants - Makes giants 3x bigger.\r\n\r\nVisible Slaughterfish - Makes only slaughterfish 3x bigger so you can see them more easily.\r\n\r\nEvil Slaughterfish - Makes slaughterfish much more dangerous: 3x damage, 2.5x speed, 3.1x attack chance and 2x health.\r\n\r\nAlso available on the Steam Workshop here:\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/WarriorG0el/myworkshopfiles/",
