But, a hot little corner to chill should be welcome.\n<br />\n<br />Okay, purchase a house!\n<br />Bad news, a killer squat inside the last house in town. If you are able to kick out this man no problem. So, Chamberlain give to you a house for some buckets. You use the key and open a huge door.\n<br />\n<br />Oh my god ! This is an ugly arrangement !\n<br />\n<br />I go back to Whiterun.\n<br />\n<br />No, no, no, Vastary's company is here for you ! Look at my plans :\n<br />\n<br />-Change all the interior\n<br />-This house has been build above Nordic's ruins. We can do unique gallery.\n<br />\n<br />[color=red][u][b][i]2) Prerequit[/i][/b][/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />You have to buy Hjerim House.\n<br />Some body Bodyslide, meshes, texture, faces for more fun and nude girls.\n<br />\n<br />CBBE: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\n<br />And be 18+ or 21+\n<br />\n<br />[color=red][u][b][i]3) Features:[/i][/b][/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />-1 Forge\n<br />-2 Bedrooms ( 6 beds )\n<br />-1 Kitchen\n<br />-1 Lab\n<br />-1 Dining room\n<br />-1 Living room\n<br />-1 Library\n<br />-1 Armory\n<br />-Nordic's ruins\n<br />-Little modifications in Breezehome\n<br />\n<br />Some stuff are hidden, you must read books. There is a door with an access to the ruins but be carefull and play the roleplay! You don't need any of your skills, it's done a way if you have to die you die! Can't counter God mode but head's up to you.\n<br />\n<br />[color=red][u][b][i]4)Install[/i][/b][/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Copy all files in Skyrim's data folder.\n<br />\n<br />You Wannamey'tO purchase a house ?\n<br />\n<br />[u]Two options, another time, head's up to you :[/u]\n<br />\n<br />-Finish \"Blood on the ice\", and become Thane.\n<br />You will need 12500 pieces for buy it and clean killer's stuff.\n<br />\n<br />-Use the damn console,\"Â²\" and write \"setstage 000a7b33 10\". It's possible you will find some dirty objects on the floor, must have pay for the house!
