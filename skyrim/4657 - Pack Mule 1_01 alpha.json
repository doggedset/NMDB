  "descriptionHtml": "Update: Thanks to SteelChi there is now working feather spells that you can buy from mages! Check out his mod @ http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4710\r\n\r\nI was tired of having to buy potions or depend on enchanted items all the time to increase my carry weight. And have been unable to find a mod with this type of spell. So I made this simple spell with skyedit for myself, and decided to upload it here for others to use. I am having issues getting a buyable spelltome version in game. So for now you have to use the console command \r\n\r\n\\\"Player.addspell 1C001000\\\".\r\n\r\nTo install this just place the .esp into your Skyrim Data folder \\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\" and activate the plugin. \r\n\r\nIf for some reason the above code is not working open the console ~ and type \\\"help pack 0\\\" without quotes and use the page up key until the spell is listed.\r\n\r\n",
