  "descriptionHtml": "Adds an Expert level conjuration spell to summon a Spriggan Earth Mother.\r\nAvailable in the Hall of Countenance or with the console. \r\n\r\nREQUIRES: Dawnguard.\r\n\r\nI did not see this mod here, and created it for myself to learn the CK. Decided to upload it for anyone else interested. It\\'s my first mod, but I have checked everything and it should be completely bug free.\r\n\r\n- Creature should be affected only by duration increase, range and cost reduction perks. Should work with the 100 perk to cast 2. Is NOT affected by the perk which increases potency. Similar perk behavior to the Dremora Lord.\r\n- Creature is already immensely powerful on it\\'s own, and I felt this was a good balance.\r\n\r\nHowever, I made it scale with player level. If it is too powerful in later levels, I will leave it open to comments if it needs a change (they are default level 30 in CK). I did not test levels past 50.\r\n\r\nSummon lasts for 60 seconds and has a moderate magicka cost.\r\n\r\nNOTE* The Earth Mother is a fairly large creature, I did not alter it\\'s size but it should be mentioned it might get stuck on some doorways, indoor areas etc. I did not realize they were such a towering creature.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nDrop the .esp file in your data directory. Not sure if NMM compatible, never used it. It\\'s just an .esp file, nothing else.\r\n\r\nHope someone enjoys it.\r\nCheers, \r\n\r\nEDIT* Picture shows a size comparison with Lydia. \r\n\r\nUpdate 1.2\r\n\r\n- Added the spell tome to Phinis Gestors area in the Hall of Countenance.\r\nThe location of the tome is on the floor, to the right of his bed. Can\\'t miss it.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.1\r\n\r\n- Reduced duration to 60 seconds\r\n- Increased skill multiplier to match the Dremora Lord (2.0, was set at apprentice xp gain matching the flame atronach)\r\n- Readjusted Magicka cost to remain similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
