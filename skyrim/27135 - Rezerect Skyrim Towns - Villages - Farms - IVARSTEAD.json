I plan to fix that!\r\n\r\nThe Rezerect Skyrim - Towns, Villages and Farms Series aims to add beauty to each and every Town, Village and Farm in Skyrim; making each of them unique. There is also a focus on FPS; I do not plan to add SOOO MUCH detail that it will impact FPS a great deal; just enough to make an impact on your experiences!\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8488/8200302747_e01ceddd12_c.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8340/8201394702_23a743c89a_c.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8200302963_c01a2766ea_c.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8208/8200303019_ea1ca24274_c.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8488/8201395138_64c93967e1_c.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8199/8200301903_565e6da915_c.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=red] Compatibility[/color][/size]\r\nShould be compatible with any and all mods that do not alter Ivarstead (Structures, Animals, etc.)\r\nAny and all lighting mods (ENB, COT, etc.) will work with this no problem.\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=red]Load Order[/color][/size]\r\nSince it is a new mod, Wyrebash and BOSS wont recognize it, so you will have to manually move it in your mod order. Make sure ANY AND ALL Rezerect Skyrim Towns - Villages - Farms Mods are loaded with other City, Town, Villages, Mod (no particular order). Do not put it at the end of your mod list, this will cause issues.\r\n\r\nHere is part of my load order:\r\n\r\n•\tdD - Enhanced Blood Main.esp Active\r\n•\tdD-Dawnguard-EBT Patch.esp Active\r\n•\tdD - Easy Lift Bodies and Objects - Light Only.esp Active\r\n•\tRiverwoodEnhancedPlugin.esp Active\r\n•\t[color=yellow]Rezerect_Ivarstead.esp Active ***********************************[/color]\r\n•\tTAVESolitude.esp Active\r\n•\tTAVEWindhelm.esp Active\r\n•\tdD - Realistic Ragdoll Force - Reduced.esp Active\r\n•\tApocalypse - The Spell Package.esp Active\r\n\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=red]Other Mods[/color][/size]\r\nCheck out my ENB, Rezerect Skyrim V3, which was used to take all pictures shown here.\r\n [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25616]Rezerect Skyrim ENB[/url]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25616",
