  "modName": "Dominos Reduced Weight Mod",
  "summary": "Reduces the weight of various items in Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Before I continue, some items that are .25, .75, etc will show up as being rounded up to .3, .8, etc on the default inventory (not sure about custom UIs). I only modified the weight values however I have not been able to get this mod to coexist with any mods that alter the value of the same items. I&#39;ve tried other weight-modifying mods to see if it&#39;s an isolated event and it is not, if I discover a way to make them compatible I will update accordingly.\r<br />\r<br />There is two options to download. One contains 1 esp that combines all effects and another download which contains 8 esps with 8 different readme&#39;s.  If I recall there is a mod limit so once a mash-up of these esps has been tested (I have bat files with all of the items in this mod) it will be posted. I am still debating if I wish to go further with my weight modifications.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to keep the changes from a mod that modifies anything from an item from any of the esps I suggest loading it after the esp it would effect.\r<br />\r<br />For a full list of the items altered click the Read Me section and hit ctrl+f to start the search.\r<br />\r<br />This mod was made for myself because I was unhappy with the weight choices by Bethesda and other mods. Nothing is weightless in these mods and some items are reduced up to 80%. Any feedback is appreciated as this was my first mod and used as a learning experience to get comfortable with how they name certain things in the CK.\r<br />\r<br />Completed:\r<br />Lighter Animal parts\r<br />Lighter Dragon Scales and Bones\r<br />Lighter Dwemer Items\r<br />Lighter Food\r<br />Lighter Ingredients\r<br />Lighter Ores and Ingots\r<br />Lighter Potions\r<br />Lighter Scrolls\r<br />\r<br />Might Do:\r<br />Lighter Books\r<br />Lighter Misc Items\r<br />Lighter Quest Items (would NOT include equippable &#34;quest&#34; items like bows, armor, swords, etc that you retrieve for npcs.)",
