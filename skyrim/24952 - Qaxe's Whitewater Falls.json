  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=3][i][size=4]This stand-alone version of Whitewater Chalet is fun and reliable, but is no longer supported. Whitewater is part of my mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75451/]Qaxe's Questorium[/url][/size][/i][/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />[b][color=orange]WHITEWATER CHALET[/color][/b][color=orange][b]: [/b][/color]Affordable, convenient, and private.\n<br />-- House purchase dialog with a lore-friendly, unique character   \n<br />-- Pay 8k, buy upgrades and move in -- no lengthy quests involved\n<br /> -- Home furnishing options (starts unfurnished)\n<br />-- Option to hire a housekeeper to help you buy much needed supplies\n<br />-- Options to hire experts to come guard your home, teach you their skills, or travel with you\n<br />-- Hirelings have their own rooms, beds, chests and schedules. Hirelings have horses.   \n<br />-- Horse purchase option for player (2 follower horses included)\n<br />-- Underground passage with option to connect with your home\n<br />-- \"Teleport Whitewater\" lets you teleport home from anywhere in Tamriel\n<br />-- All crafting stations, bookshelves, weapons racks and mannequins available.\n<br />-- Safe storage inside and outside the house\n<br />-- Bridge access for people who prefer walking\n<br />-- Scenic location between Whiterun and Riverwood\n<br />\n<br />[color=orange]NOTES: [/color] \n<br />-- Total cost: 15,000 septims (or so).

M.O. installation is not just faster, but safer when removing mods.\n<br />\n<br />[color=orange]CONFLICTS [/color]with any mod that occupies the same location. Click the \"Images\" tab to see the location on the map.Do not use with \"Qaxe's Questorium\". Whitewater is now part of QQ.\n<br />\n<br />[color=orange]CRAVE MORE ADVENTURE? [/color] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75451/]Qaxe Questorium[/url] is my \"main\" mod. It contains over 1Gb of towns, quests, dungeons, spells, voiced followers, and...pretty much anything I could possibly cram into my 9 unique world spaces. This mod is part of Qaxe's Questorium, so don't use them together.\n<br />\n<br />[color=orange]SUPPORT:[/color] Qaxe's Whitewater Falls moved to my [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75451/]Qaxe Questorium[/url] mod in May, 2016. This stand-alone version is [i]no longer supported.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[color=orange]PERMISSIONS:[/color][b] [/b]This mod is the creative property of the author.
