  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=white][size=5][u]Ready to make Alchemy a real skill?[/u][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Let&#39;s face the facts, crafting in Skyrim breaks the game.  A player can easily obtain high levels of Alchemy, Smithing, and Enchanting with very little effort.  Who hasn&#39;t gone to a Alchemy table and potion spammed for quick cash and levels?  It&#39;s so easy, it&#39;s dumb.  Enter Alchemy Requires Bottles...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][size=3][b]Goals[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />The purpose of this mod is to challenge the player with a more immersive style of Alchemy.  Potion making should be harder than clicking the mouse a few times.  Spamming potions should be outlawed as crating a potion takes time.  Obtaining high levels of Alchemy becomes rewarding and difficult.  A player no longer has to feel guilty for earning alchemy levels or selling potions they made to merchants.  With &#34;Alchemy Requires Bottles&#34; installed, you earned those levels.  You earned that gold&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][size=3][b]Features[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />* To craft a potion, the player must have some sort of empty bottle\r<br />* An empty bottle is given to the player when they drink a potion or drink\r<br />* Attempting to craft a potion will cause the screen to fade out for 2 seconds\r<br />* Game time will be advanced when a potion is created.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][size=3][b]Future Plans[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Adding MCM menu so player can customize so how much experience is earned from crafting a potion and how much time it takes to make a potion. (game time and real time)\r<br />MOD SERIES:\r<br />Smithing Requires Fuel\r<br />Enchanting Requires Magicka\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfItInp7zvw]Click here to watch at YouTube[/url][/center]\r<br />[center][youtube]EfItInp7zvw[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][size=3][b]Bugs/Warnings[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />There still may exist some loopholes in the ability to spam due to the fact that the script must fire a series of commands in order.  However these anomalies are few and far between.  If the crafting menu happens to remain enabled when you know it shouldn&#39;t be, DON&#39;T CRAFT A POTION.  If you do, you will a warning message.  If you persist to exploit the mod, bad things will happen...\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][size=3][b]Compatibility[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Not compatible with anything that add&#39;s the ability to craft potions outside the Alchemy table.  If you want to make it compatible, message me and I will show you how in 2 minutes.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][size=3][b]Installation[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />SKSE is required. To install the mod, just unzip the files and drop them in the folder, or you can use the NMM if you want. \r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][size=3][b]My Recommendations[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Find a mod that nerfs Alchemy effects so they don&#39;t stack OR/AND adds a potion drinking animation OR/AND disables potion/food consumption in combat.  There&#39;s lots out there...\r<br />",
