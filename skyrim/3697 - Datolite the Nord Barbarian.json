  "descriptionHtml": "I think it\\'s one of my best looking character creations, and I only regret I didn\\'t save a level 1 version of this to share. I included two saved games, one at level 11 (just getting started I think with Companions and assaulting the Thalmor prison) and one at level 40 after completing the main storyline quest, the brotherhood, companions and stormcloaks.\r\n\r\nThe level 40 version has a home in Solitude full of goodies, with Lydia in full daedric gear waiting back in Whiterun. Also some weird and kinky lesbian werewolf marriage with Aela the huntress. Yeah, don\\'t ask.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'ve never tried a dual-wield character, this might give you an idea of just how badass they can be. Magic is for the weak! Get in there and spill some blood the good old-fashioned way!\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: If you get a message saying content is missing, don\\'t sweat it. Just a few mods I was using that won\\'t impact the game.",
