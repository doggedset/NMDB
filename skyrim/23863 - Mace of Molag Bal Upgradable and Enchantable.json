  "descriptionHtml": "Basically, I like this mace.\r\nThe only thing, can\\'t be upgraded properly! The smithing perks do not effect it.\r\n\r\nI changed that so it can now be upgraded properly with the daedric smithing perk and I also removed the enchant (as nice as it was).\r\nI just prefer to use my own enchantment or none at all (elemental fury ftw).\r\n\r\nI also felt the need for some reason to change it\\'s damage so it\\'s the same as dragon bone weapons (17 Base Damage).
