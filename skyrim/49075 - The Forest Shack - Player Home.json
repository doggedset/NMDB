  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=red][b]The Forest Shack - Player Home[/b][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />This was a request from Glory4Lyfe, where she wanted a small player home styled for a Bosmer. I hope you like it, Glory&#33; :) Everyone, please note I am leaving for the week as soon as I upload this file and cannot do any more requests until Sunday. Also, forgive my typos, it&#39;s been a while since I slept.\r<br />\r<br />The Forest Shack is small but cosy player home nestled along the road to Falkreath on the shores of Lake Ilinalta and a stone&#39;s throw away from Halfmoon Mill. The Bosmer owner of the shack, Conor, lives there peacefully but gets a bit lonely so he offers up for free to any adventurer who wants the main shack to rest and store items in.\r<br />\r<br />The shack has no load screens, so don&#39;t worry about being slowed down for your adventures&#33; There&#39;s plenty of storage, from a strong box to weapon racks, plaques and chests. Every container around the area is safe. It&#39;s also nav-meshed, so it&#39;s completely follower friendly, and the bed in the main shack gives the player a well-rested bonus. Overall, it&#39;s extremely lore friendly, with nothing out of place (such as a Dwemer chest, lol&#33;) and lots of nice friendly clutter.\r<br />\r<br />Full features:\r<br />* All crafting stations\r<br />* Two beds\r<br />* Cluttery goodness\r<br />* Nav-Meshed\r<br />* Fus Roh Dah proof\r<br />* A rather handsome Bosmer ranger follower named Conor (who&#39;s also able to be married&#33;)\r<br />* Dock\r<br />* Vegie garden\r<br /> ~ And more&#33; ~\r<br />\r<br />I also do plan on updating this, mainly because I was rushed to finish it and didn&#39;t fit in as many things as I wanted. Conor will also become a merchant (selling pelts and other hunting gear) and I wish to add in another Bosmer, a female trainer. I want to add in more storage (because there is never enough, right?) and perhaps another shack for followers... I don&#39;t know right know.
