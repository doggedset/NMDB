  "descriptionHtml": "[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/80198-3-1479045565.jpg[/img]\r<br />[size=4]This is my own retexture of the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68530/?]Eso Nord Armor [/url]made by the awesome Newermind43.\r<br />\r<br />When i first saw the ESO trailer i fell in love with nord armor, and i wish to have it on Skyrim. Thanks to Newemind43 now all of us can enjoy this model. Although I really appreciate the work done by Newermid43, i think the textures arent good enough for this awesome armor. For me it looks unrealistic, non lore-friendly at all, the steel plates feel like plastic, the leather is brand new, and i think thats not the correct feeling  of the armor.\r<br />\r<br />I tested the other retextures on Nexus (fadingsignal and Bulldog) but neither of this like me. Although the textures made by fadingsignal make it more older and rough, i still thinking the same. So i decide to create my own retexture and be part of this awesome armor and contribute with my little effort to the community. \r<br />\r<br />After hours of testing and creating i think i have one retexture that can be suitable to the lore-friendly, realistic, rough and battle-worn look i want.\r<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/80198-0-1479047099.jpg[/img]\r<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/80198-0-1479047619.jpg[/img]\r<br />[/size][size=4][quote]&#34;I always hated the black gloves, even though it is accurate. Replacing the black with chainmail was brilliant. Standing next to the guard shows how well the armor blends into the game.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />&#34;I like Gamwich&#39;s version, as well as this one. Great job. You can&#39;t have too many good retextures.&#34; jayr848[/quote]\r<br />\r<br />Please feel free to use it and change it as you wish to create your own custom armor. Also i will appreciate if you can take some pictures and show all how it looks in-game.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />A) INSTALLATION - UNINSTALLATION \r<br />Manual - Simply extract to your Skyrim folder /Delete the files \r<br />NMM - Use it as normal /Deactivate the mod\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=3]B) CHANGELOG - VERSION 1-\r<br />-Completely new textures for all the major pieces, take from here and there and personal tweaked.\r<br />-The black shirt is now a HQ chainmail.\r<br />-The leather is now made like a real leather which has a lot stories behind him, with details.\r<br />-Change the colour of the gloves with the original colour version of Newermind43, with fadingsignal retexture they are way too dark.\r<br />-The horns now has new textures to be like a real polished horn.\r<br />-Change the shiny (Metal_e) of the metal, to have more contrast and saturation, less shiny and more detailed.\r<br />-The plates all are redone with another material to be like metal (no more plastic plates&#33;&#33;), added custom scars, gaps, stains and more.
