  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a bunch of stupid Batch(Command) files i decided to post, many might have bugs.\r\ndon\\'t expect anything to cool, except, maybe a flaming follower*, but you know, not much.\r\n\r\nInstall: Add to your main directory (where your TESV.exe and Launcher are)\r\n\r\nI will update description as I add BAT files\r\nDragonScale.txt I believe it may be OP but unfortunately the fire only works on a follower* and FPS WILL TAKE A HIT\r\n\r\nDragonPlate.txt May be same as above but Plate armor\r\n\r\nDragon.txt you will turn Into a dragon... not entirely undo-able (use racemenu or setrace commands) but it is difficult to use in vanilla skyrim (no fly or other cool stuff) Relatively balanced\r\n\r\nVampWolf.txt You OP little..... Um, It will add perks from Vampire, Werewolf, and Dragon... NOT BALANCED unless you are dragonborn ;)\r\n\r\nmarry.txt You are now in the marriageable faction... In theory, but you may still need amulet of MARA\r\n\r\nMASTER1.TXT Unknown\r\nMASTER2.TXT Unknown\r\nMASTER3.TXT Unknown Sorry... but try it out anyway\r\n\r\nactivate  with the following command: BAT Dragon to activate the Dragon batch file\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Most only effect your character, so some clever BAT Editing skills may be necessary, if you want to effect others. Armor effects only work when follower equips\r\n\r\nPlease Just Tell Me If something isn\\'t working or fix it yourself.\r\nI am open to Ideas, These just seemed cool. So yeah...\r\n\r\n\r\nI just created some BAT file using the helpful resources that came from :\r\n\r\n http://www.mmo-game.eu/cheats-and-console/ \r\nThose Guys are awesome!\r\n\r\nAnd the Skyrim wikis online.\r\n\r\nAnd a lot of trial and Error.",
