  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]Information[/u][/b]\r<br />This mod allows you to craft the Sword of Truth from the series of books of the same name by Terry Goodkind. The sword itself is strong but, shouldn&#39;t be too overpowered, I am still working on the enchantments for it to act how it is in the books, I will update with that when I can figure it out. The forge recipe currently requires you have the Deadric smithing perk, using the same ingredients as a Deadric Sword, also requires you to forge it at the Skyforge, I may change this later depending on the feedback, I think it fair though.\r<br />\r<br />The value is pretty high if you want to sell it, I mean it&#39;s a one of a kind sword with enough power to make the wielder go into a blind rage, not exactly supposed to be cheap. Why you would want to sell it is something I can&#39;t understand considering the fantastic work BattleyaxStudios did on the appearance.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Reviews[/u][/b]\r<br />[youtube]U5LEQtxYReQ[/youtube] [youtube]TarKBvrCD6M[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u] Compatibility[/u][/b]\r<br />Should be compatible with everything really, only adds a sword currently so no reason for a conflict. There will be a quest added in a later version to get it (alternate version instead of crafting), so that may add an incompatibility.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Credits[/u][/b]\r<br />BattleyaxStudios - Model and Textures\r<br />Durge13/Neronix17 - Implementation",
