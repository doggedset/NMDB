  "descriptionHtml": "[u]Dawnstar Sanctuary Overhaul:\r<br />[/u]by k4tonic\r<br />\r<br />As the title suggests, this is an overhaul for the Dawnstar Sanctuary. Added a new area off to the side of the main entry way that includes a blacksmith forge, smelter, grindstone, tanning rack and workbench, as well as a chest for storage. There&#39;s also an Arcane Enchanter at the top of one of the stair cases.\r<br />\r<br />But that&#39;s not all... The lighting has also been redone. Each light source puts out its own light, and has been made to look a bit more appropriate taking into account the type of light and where it&#39;s located. Candles on tables put out less light than chandeliers and other larger light sources.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Are there any incompatible mods?\r<br />\r<br />[/i]Any mod that alters the Dawnstar Sanctuary is most likely incompatible. Also this overhaul was created for a RealVision ENB/ELFX combination in mind. Other setups will produce different results, and may not be desirable.\r<br />\r<br />Note: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10510/?]Additional Dark Brotherhood Members[/url] by [b]icestormganon[/b] is compatible with this overhaul.\r<br />\r<br />[i]What&#39;s new?\r<br />\r<br />[/i][b]3.22.2015[/b] - v1: Initial Release\r<br />\r<br />[i]Planning any updates?[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Maybe add a Dark Brotherhood face sculptor. I&#39;ve already experimented with this but ran into some issues. Not sure if it&#39;s the script or something else. May also add some vendors.\r<br />\r<br />[i]How do I install this mod?\r<br />\r<br />[/i]Download using NMM and install. I&#39;ve never used Mod Organizer so I&#39;m not sure how it functions, and I never recommend manually installing a mod unless required.\r<br />\r<br />[i]I don&#39;t like this, how do I get rid of it?\r<br />\r<br />[/i]Once again, NMM is your best friend here.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Can I use this for my own projects, or upload to another site?\r<br />\r<br />[/i]Um, no. I prefer the Nexus Sites, and a lot of time went into getting everything right.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Who all is responsible for this mod?\r<br />\r<br />[/i]Bethesda for the game and Creation Kit\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]That&#39;s it, enjoy your new Dawnstar Sanctuary&#33;[/b]",
