  "descriptionHtml": "It had annoyed me that you can only place one Magelight at a time, even though we see other mages in game place multiple&#33; This fixes that, there is now no limit to how many you can place and the duration has been extended to 5 minutes.\r<br />\r<br />I may implement multiple different colors for the spell if there is interest and I can competently do it.",
