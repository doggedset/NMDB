  "descriptionHtml": "Good news everyone. Mrs Teal (that&#39;s me) is back to playing Skyrim, and therefore modding. I sort of wanted to remake my old child mods and created separate child races from the adult versions. There is 9 children in total in this mod. This mod is not entirely lorefriendly, so.. I know Dremora can&#39;t have children. But I thought why not? Even players of that race should be allowed to have kids of their own kind.\r<br />[b]Managed to make the children adoptable now, as I realized I hadn&#39;t set the faction rank to 1. So it should work now.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Where to find the kids?[/b]\r<br />-Woodelves: In Riverwood near the sawmill respective inside the windmill outside Whiterun.\r<br />-Highelves: Solitude.\r<br />-Darkelves: Windhelm.\r<br />-Dremora: Outside respective inside Mehrunes Shrine.\r<br />-Orc boy: In the bandit camp outside Whiterun, where you can find skooma.\r<br /> \r<br />[b]Required files[/b]\r<br />-Hearthfire\r<br />-Xvision Children Redone\r<br />\r<br />[b]Recommended files[/b]\r<br />-No More Blocky Faces (Less Ugly Elven Faces version)\r<br />-Eye enhancement mods\r<br />\r<br />[b]Known bugs[/b]\r<br />-If you can&#39;t find Camden in Solitude, bring up the console and type &#34;prid xx00603f&#34; (with xx being the number of your load order) and then type &#34;moveto player&#34;.\r<br />-The children have neck seams, they might have it in the Xvision mod as well.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Future plans[/b]\r<br />-Add an orc girl.\r<br />-Fix further bugs (let me know if you find any)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Things I&#39;m not planning in the near future[/b]\r<br />-Make the child races of this mod playable.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits[/b]\r<br />-Zazemel for the head meshes of their Drow Race mod.\r<br />-Bugsbugme and Bagserk for the Xvision Children mod.\r<br />-mrjentipede for the orc head mesh of their Kids Of Skyrim mod.\r<br />-And at last, I thank Bethesda for making this mod possible.\r<br />\r<br />Hope you guys enjoy this mod&#33; Don&#39;t forget to endorse if it worked for you. And I&#39;m always open for suggestions&#33; :-)",
