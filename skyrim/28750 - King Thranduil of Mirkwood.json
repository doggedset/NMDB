I made this character to look like King Thranduil of the recently released The Hobbit movie, no mods on it, hope U like it. \r\n\r\nIt is recommended to use the console command * player.setscale 1.1 * (default is 1) to look taller like the Lord of the Rings Wood Elves.\r\n\r\nMod used for the Mouse/Elk Mount: Like a Boss - New Mounts Mod\r\n\r\n~ I\\'d really like the Autumn Circlet he wears in movie, made by someone ~\r\n~ It now is in the Mod Requests Forum area _ Any help appreciated ~",
