My compliments to who created the program (I apologize I do not remember his/her name).\r\n\r\nCurrently she follows your commands and wields any weapon you give her.  However the one thing you expected her to do (wield the elements) I have not been successful in getting her to do.  This is my first mod so bear with me.  If anyone is able to get her to do elemental magic (bending), before I figure it out all I ask is to receive initial credit and the secret to getting her to use magic.",
