  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Dwemer Clutter into Dwarven ingots - by EliteKhajiit[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is a mod for someone that needs more dwarven metal ingots, but just can&#39;t find enough material to make them.  If you have a mod that allows for the creation and maintenance of Dwemer constructs, you probably know what I mean. I have made all dwemer clutter smeltable while still maintaining some sort of balance to not make things too easy.  This is not a mod for people looking for a cheat, balance is my biggest concern.\r<br />\r<br />Speaking of, I&#39;ve tried to keep it balanced by using weight.  It takes 5 weight to make 1 dwarven metal ingot, so an item that weighs 10 will yield 2 ingots.  Items that weighed 2 will now weigh 2.5, and many other items have been similarly adjusted.  An item&#39;s weight is relevant to its size, and it&#39;s yield is relevant to its weight.  Simply put, larger items weigh more and yield more ingots. \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve also changed the weight of the dwarven metal ingots to 3.5.  Weighing 1 is just ridiculous, and weighing 5 would be too much.\r<br />\r<br />All dwemer clutter is now classified as an ore, so it will be more organized in your inventory, and more vendors will buy it.  I&#39;ve also renamed all clutter so the names start with &#34;Dwemer&#34;.  \r<br />\r<br />Smelting dwemer clutter requires the [i]Dwarven Smithing[/i] perk.\r<br />\r<br />Lastly, all small clutter, like forks and cups, are smeltable into partial ingots.  Three partial ingots make 1 dwarven metal ingot.  This was done to make it easier for the player to mix and match to make a full ingot, otherwise I&#39;d have to make it require 12 knives, 6 cups 3 dishes etc., to make 1 dwarven metal ingot.  Obviously, those quantities would take a long time to accumulate, so I feel this is better, especially with there being 3 different kinds of dwemer cups in the game.  Right now the partial ingot is using the regular dwarven metal ingot mesh.  I may make a smaller ingot mesh if I get a chance.\r<br />\r<br />To give a better idea of how partial ingots work:\r<br />\r<br />[i]4 forks make a partial ingot\r<br />2 cups make a partial ingot\r<br />1 dish makes a partial ingot\r<br />3 partial ingots makes 1 regular dwarven metal ingot.\r<br />\r<br />Therefore, 4 forks, 2 cups, and 1 dish make 1 regular dwarven detal ingot, and so on.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I realize there are a number of mods that do something similar to this, but I felt balance and simplicity were key here.  Also, Centurian Dynamo Cores can&#39;t be smelted, since they are rare and used for other things.\r<br />\r<br />This mod now requires the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19/?]Unofficial Skyrim Patch[/url].  If anyone has any suggestions or concerns, please let me know.\r<br />\r<br />[i]*This mod was cleaned with TES5Edit*[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[i]Installation[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Just download and install with your mod manager.

If you are paranoid, leave all of you dwemer items in a container and travel to a different cell before deactivating.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[i]Compatibility[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Compatible with anything that doesn&#39;t change the names or weight of dwemer clutter.
