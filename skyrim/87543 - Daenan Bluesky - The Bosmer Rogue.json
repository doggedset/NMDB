  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />**IMPORTANT NOTE***\r<br />Screenshots just wont work for me as they either arent saved properly or grey and badly distorted. The one picture you can see was taken with my phone and looks really bad. So I need your guys help to get some good pictures. Whoever provides any will be credited on this page. Thanks for your help&#33;\r<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br /> \r<br />Hey people who can mod better than me&#33;\r<br />This is my first work and based on one of my characters who became the master of the thieves guild and a badass Nightingale during his career. Feedback is greatly appreciated as Im a huge noob and a CK legasthenic.\r<br />\r<br />Anyway...\r<br />Meet Daenan Bluesky, the Bosmer rogue. Hanging out at the Drunken Huntsman, he will accompany you for free as soon as you say the magic words.\r<br />His abilities are\r<br />-archery, which is his main fighting style\r<br />-one-handed, which he will only use in sticky situations\r<br />-sneak (has the light foot perk and wont blow your cover)\r<br />-and restoration along with some healing spells so you dont need to worry about him going down.\r<br />He prefers light armor and also uses it by default. Also, he wont judge you for your crimes. In fact, he will be happy to lend a hand (like if you suck at lockpicking he will even unlock houses for you).\r<br />\r<br />Voice type: MaleEvenToned (same as e.g. Faendal) but sometimes he will make somewhat unique radiant comments that at least I have not (or rarely) heard from other followers with the same voice type. My theory is that its affected by his morality because in tombs and dwemer ruins he will often comment on finding valuable items.\r<br />AI: Thalmor archer (cant remember its name in the CK) so he will use his healing spells effective. He will do so during late and mid-game but not during early game as he wont take much damage there yet due to his light armor perks.\r<br />\r<br />Finally, if theres any bug or glitch you notice let me know yadda yadda suck suck.\r<br />Im out guys. Enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />Update notes\r<br />1.0: first version\r<br />1.1: removed some archery perks and changed his AI to balance Daenans combat behaviour",
