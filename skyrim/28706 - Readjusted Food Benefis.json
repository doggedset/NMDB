  "descriptionHtml": "Ever feel like the vanilla food settings were just too... bland? I mean, a whole Apple Pie, and all you get is 10 health restored?\r\n\r\nI aim to change that with this mod.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, I\\'m just sticking with the direction Bethesda themselves took with food - it should not replace health/stamina/magic potions, but should also provide a benefit worthy enough to sacrifice the carry weight for it.\r\n\r\nThis breaks down to adding those lovely \\\"Regenerate 1 Stamina per second for 720 seconds\\\" effects and the like to pretty much every form of \\\"prepared\\\" food (so Apples are still a measly few HP, but an Apple Pie will now fortify your Magicka by 50 and your Magicka Rate by 2 per second for 2 minutes).\r\n\r\nI had a full list here, but in the interests of brevity, I\\'ll include it in a readme for the next release.\r\n\r\nNOW HEARTHFIRE COMPLIANT!  Take a look!  Changes not listed here, but plenty of good things.  Be sure to bring a jug of milk along the next time you tee off against a Chaurus ^_~\r\n\r\n\r\n---==Compatibilities==----\r\nAny survival mods that require you to eat food should be compatible with this mod, as I haven\\'t changed any of the formIDs or other data; just the actual effect of the food.\r\n\r\nI deliberately didn\\'t touch the drinks so that this mod can be compatible with most of the Alcoholism/Drunk mods out there.\r\n\r\nIf you come across any issues, let me know! I\\'ve rather limited ability, but I\\'ll do what I can or find someone to help.\r\n\r\n\r\n---==Version History==----\r\nv1.0 (12/21/2012) - Yay! The world didn\\'t end! Also, initial release!\r\n\r\nv1.5 (1/26/2013) - Second release, with Hearthfire Support.",
