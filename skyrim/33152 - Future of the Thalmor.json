  "summary": "I know many of you may not have felt the same way, but I for one, have always wanted to join the Thalmor. Even though they are elven supremacists I thought they were a fascinating organization. So I made this mod to let you do just that, join the Thalmor. But there is one other thing you can do... destroy the Thalmor.",
  "descriptionHtml": "   The Thalmor are truly dominant in the land of Skyrim and eradicate the worship of Talos, one of the nine (eight if you are Thalmor) divines. You have two options in this mod, and you must choose carefully. You can choose to become a Thalmor Agent and work for the Thalmor, assassinating targets and abolishing worship of Talos, raiding temples and churches, as well as completely destroying the Stormcloaks. But you can also choose to join them as a Stormcloak spy, and learn the secrets of the Thalmor, undermining them and betraying their plans to the Stormcloaks and unveiling the dark secrets that are the Thalmor. The choice is yours, you have to decide. I would like to see people in the comments section telling me if you should have to be high elf to become a Thalmor Agent or Imperial, but I have decided that you MUST be Stormcloak in order to destroy the Thalmor, or at least not imperial.",
