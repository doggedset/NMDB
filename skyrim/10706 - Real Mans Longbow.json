  "descriptionHtml": "Update: Added a slightly quicker draw variant, for people who just want the long bow visuals as a replacement to the default high level bows. File: Heartwood Longbow Archer.\r\n\r\nMy image of a Nordic Warrior involves giant two-handed claymores and longbows, and so I found it sad that in Skyrim, where the theme is clearly very Norse, the long bow is one of the lowest tiers of weapons, and frankly feels pretty flimsy.\r\n\r\n I felt it only right that the heavy close combat characters should have with their bows what they have in their Claymores and Warhammers; huge damage, at the cost of speed. This Bow IS slow, and not intended for archer characters, I just felt it more in line with the sort of character I was playing.\r\n\r\nTHE BOW:\r\nThe Bow has a base damage of 35 (balanced out with speed so that the Damage per Second is 1). For lack of a better name, I called it Heartwood Long Bow (googled longbows and picked a word..).\r\n\r\nLOCATION:\r\nThe Bow is sold in the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun, with base cost 350 gold (will go up based on your speechcraft).\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I would like to do the following things with the bow, but currently lack the knowledge/skill to do so. Anyone who has any advice on doing these things please message me:\r\n- Make the bow BIGGER. Apparently resizing in NIFskope isn\\'t enough?\r\n- Make it unusable in Sneak Mode.\r\nThanks",
