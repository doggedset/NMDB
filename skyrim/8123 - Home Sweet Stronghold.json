  "summary": "Adds a small player-owned hut in Dushnikh Yal, the Orc Stronghold southeast of Markarth.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Current Version: 1.0.0\r\n\r\nIf you want to incorporate this mod in a mod of your own, go ahead.  No need to ask, just use it as your heart desires.\r\n\r\n------ Description ------\r\n\r\nEver wished you could live in a Stronghold among the Orcs?  Me too!  That\\'s why I made this mod.\r\n\r\nThe hut is located in Dushnikh Yal, next to the farm.  Just walk to the right around the Longhouse, up the wooden steps, and you can\\'t miss it.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the hut contains a bed and some player storage, including a strongbox and shelf.  Around the side of the hut is a small balcony with a tanning rack and some additional storage. All furniture and architecture is in the Orcish style, so it\\'ll fit right in with the surrounding homes.\r\n\r\nIn the basement you\\'ll find an enchantment table and a reading area.\r\n\r\nThere is no quest or other requirement to use this house, but the Orcs of the stronghold won\\'t trade or speak with you unless you are accepted by them first.  For more info on being accepted as an Orc clan member, visit the following page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Forgemaster\\'s_Fingers\r\n\r\n------ Upcoming features ------\r\n\r\nYou\\'ll notice that the bookshelves in the basement are currently not functional. This is due to the Creation Kit crashing every time I try to place the required pieces to get it to work.  The same goes for mannequins and wall plaques, which will also be coming in a later version.\r\n\r\nI\\'ll be adding a fire pit and cooking pot somewhere, either on the first floor or out on the balcony.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s been brought to my attention that followers can\\'t come inside.  I don\\'t have a problem with this because I think it would be too cramped with another person inside, but I can make it work if enough people want it.\r\n\r\n------ Install Instructions ------\r\n\r\nJust drop the .esp file in your Skyrim/Data/ directory, and activate it via the launcher.  To uninstall, delete the .esp.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use the Nexus Mod Manager instead, if you wish.\r\n\r\n------ Thank you ------\r\n\r\nThanks for your interest, and I hope you enjoy your new Orcish home!",
