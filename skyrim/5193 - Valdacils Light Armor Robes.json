  "descriptionHtml": "Valdacil\\'s Light Armor Robes by Valdacil\r\nv4.00 - 2012-01-21\r\n\r\nI really dislike being restricted to a certain look merely because it has the best stats.  What if I want to gain\r\nthe benefit of light armor but have the look of a robe?  What if I want to gain the benefits of upgrading to\r\ndragon scale, but really like the look of glass (because of some awesome retexture mod I\\'ve installed)?  Why can I \r\nconstantly upgrade to a new look from 1-30ish; but once I hit 100 smithing I\\'m stuck wearing dragon scale the rest\r\nof the game?\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod (hopefully in a series) that will work to correct this.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does this mod do?\r\n----------------------\r\nThis mod makes \\'light armor\\' versions of many different robes craftable and upgradable (just like light armor) at\r\nthe forge and workbench.  So you can gain the benefits of leather armor (for instance), but have the look of a robe.\r\nAdditionally, you can recover a portion of the materials back if you want to \\'recycle\\' the robe and make a different\r\nstyled version.\r\n\r\n\r\nLore Explanation\r\n----------------------\r\nIf you say that smithing robes that provide armor benefits doesn\\'t make sense I would argue that these pieces are\r\npotentially cloth sewn over the top of the armor.  So in theory the character is wearing the actual armor, but has\r\n\\'covered it up\\' with the robe.  In that way, you are still gaining the benefit of the armor, it\\'s just hidden like\r\nFrodo\\'s mithril shirt. :)\r\n\r\nOnly the standard color robes and hoods are unlocked to a beginning character.  In order to craft robes specific to\r\nvarious factions you must learn more about that faction (join them).  When you are a fledgeling member of the faction\r\ncrafting options may be limited, but you will learn more recipes as you advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n----------------------\r\nI have plans to add more robes, so keep checking back as this project expands.  (See list below)\r\n\r\nThe required inputs match the base armor (Leather Robes require 4 Leather, 3 Leather Strips) plus a Bolt of Cloth\r\nwhich can be crafted at the tanning bench with 5 Tundra cotton.\r\n\r\nI have not added these robes to the leveled loot tables, so you can only get them through smithing.  The reason I left\r\nthem out of leveled loot is to prevent cases where you see an enemy and think \\\"He\\'s wearing a robe, must be a weak\r\ncaster\\\", only to find that its a glass version of that robe and the enemy is a lot tougher than you think.\r\n\r\nI also tweaked all of the hoods that I\\'ve added to allow equipping a circlet with the hood.  This may cause clipping\r\nproblems between the hood and the circlet.  Additionally, some might consider this unbalanced since you are gaining\r\nbenefits of an enchantment on the hood and the circlet.  I would argue that a helmet is tight fitting and doesn\\'t\r\noffer enough room for a circlet; but a circlet could fit comfortably beneath a hood.  Use at your own discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n----------------------\r\n- With NMM: Download with Manager and activate.\r\n- Without NMM: Download then extract the Data folder to your Skyrim folder\r\n     ie: C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\.  Then in the Skyrim launcher select \\\"Data Files\\\"\r\n     and select Valdacil\\'s Light Armor Robes.esp to activate it.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n----------------------\r\nWARNING: Any items crafted by the new recipes (including the Bolt of Cloth) will disappear when this mod is removed.\r\n     Be sure to breakdown any items crafted by this mod back into components before removing this mod.\r\n- With NMM: Deactive the mod.\r\n- Without NMM: Delete \\\"Valdacil\\'s Light Armored Robes.esp\\\" from your Skyrim Data folder\r\n     ie: C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n----------------------\r\nBecause the Light Armor Robes are all new ObjectIDs with their own forge, workbench, smelter, and tanning bench recipes\r\nthere should be no known conflicts with other mods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n----------------------\r\nHooded robes use chest and helm slots and cannot be equipped with a standard helm.  A \\\"hidden\\\" helm has been included\r\nas a recipe to allow equipping of a \\'helm\\' for the purpose of the additional armor slot and for the light armor perks.\r\nThis \\\"hidden\\\" helm uses the crown slot and could be exploited by equipping a normal helm AND the \\\"hidden\\\" helm to\r\ngain the armor rating from both.  Use or don\\'t use at your own discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion Notes\r\n-------------------\r\nv4.00\r\n- Added Greybeard Robe, Hood, Boots\r\n- Added Hammerfell Outfit, Hood, Boots (non-DB)\r\n- Added Monk Robe (hooded and non-hooded)\r\n- Added Mythic Dawn Robe (hooded and non-hooded), Gloves, Boots\r\n- Added Necromancer Robe (hooded and non-hooded)\r\n- Added Sheogorath Outfit and Boots\r\n\r\nv3.00\r\n- Added recipe for Bolt of Cloth using 5x Tundra Cotton\r\n- Bolt of Cloth now required for all cloth based robes, outfits and hoods (gloves and boots assume your character uses\r\n     the cloth \\'scraps\\' for the small amount of cloth they would need; therefore no additional components required\r\n     in the recipe)\r\n- Bug fix for Dragonscale Novice Robe recipe\r\n- Bug fix for Novice Robe recipe conditions\r\n- Added Dark Brotherhood: Shrouded Robe/Hood/Gloves/Shoes; Shrouded Redguard Outfit/Hood/Boots; Jester\\'s Set\r\n\r\nv2.30\r\n- Added College Boots and Archmage Boots (similar in style, but slightly different)\r\n- Added Vaermina Robes\r\n- Added Black Boots and Brown Boots\r\n\r\nv2.20\r\n- Added Psiijic Boots and Gloves\r\n- Added Mystic Gloves (College of Winterhold)\r\n- Added Thalmor Robe (Hooded and non-hooded), gloves, boots (all unenchanted)\r\n     - There are 2 quests that can unlock them\r\n\r\nv2.01\r\n- Bug fix for Novice Robe having the wrong model.
