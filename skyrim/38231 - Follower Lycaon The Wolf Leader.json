  "descriptionHtml": "Meet Lycaon The Wolf Leader. He has his own horse that follows him everywhere. His horse has even his very own name: Skyler. His two Elite Wolf guards have their own horse too but they are not named.\r\n\r\nLycaon and his two elite wolf guards can be found on the main road between Riverwood and Whiterun. They patrol day and night.\r\n\r\nLycaon can be a follower but his guards not. When lycaon is asked to be a follower his elite guards wil keep patrolling that road. When you dismiss Lycaon, he will return to his road and the guards will follow him again.\r\n\r\nLycaon and his elite guards fight like rangers so their main weapon is the bow.\r\n\r\nFor the record I\\'m not updating this mod cause I\\'m working on an other mod right now and I don\\'t have time to check up on this mod.\r\n\r\nFeel free to comment and endorse.\r\n\r\nCredits to Maty743 for the Bosmer Armor.",
