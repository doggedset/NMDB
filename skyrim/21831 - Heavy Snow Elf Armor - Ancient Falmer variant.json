  "descriptionHtml": "** Requires Dawnguard DLC.\r\n\r\nAlso available on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=87710490]Steam Workshop[/url].\r\n\r\n** Description **\r\n\r\nI loved the aesthetics of the Ancient Falmer armor I found in Dawnguard, but wanted a heavy armor version as that is what I use for my current character. I felt like sharing it as well.\r\n\r\nThe crafting recipes all consist of a new ingot type, ivory, and a few leather strips. They are under the Elven category at any forge. There is a book located in the Inner Sanctum called \\\"Esoteric Falmer Crafting\\\" which will enlighten the dragonborn on the crafting methods of these pieces. Reading this book (or at least opening it once) is required. Ivory bars, required to make this armor, can be smelted from mammoth tusks at any smelter after reading this book (or manually adding the perk to your character).\r\n\r\nI\\'m very open to suggestions on the perk requirements, recipes and stats. If you have any ideas, please leave a comment.\r\n\r\n** Stats **\r\n\r\nThe base stats for each piece are:\r\nGauntlets - 19\r\nBoots - 19\r\nCuirass - 46\r\nCrown - 24\r\n\r\n** Tips **\r\n\r\nIf you do not want to find the book to begin smithing these items, you can add the Ivory Smithing perk directly to your character with the console. In the console search for \\\"Ivory Smithing\\\", find the 8 character hex number associated with it. It should be something like \\\"xx0123456\\\". Then just type \\\"player.addperk xx0123456\\\". You\\'ll still need the required ivory ingots and leather strips to make everything.\r\n\r\n** Change log **\r\n\r\nv1.1b - 8/8/2012\r\n* Added a recipe for crafting Ivory bars from mammoth tusks, requires Ivory Smithing perk\r\n* Added some text to the book. It may not be extremely lore friendly or well written, I\\'m not a great author\r\n\r\nv1.1a - 8/6/2012\r\n* Added an Ancient Falmer Crown spawn to the inner sanctum throne room\r\n\r\nv1.1 - 8/6/2012\r\n* Added a new type of ingot - ivory\r\n* Ivory ingots added to falmer level lists\r\n* Altered original recipes to include ivory ingots and remove ebony and moonstone ingots\r\n* Added a book to the Inner Sanctum room with all of the frozen Falmer called \\\"Esoteric Falmer Crafting\\\", this teaches the dragonborn how to craft Snow Elf gear. It must be read or at least opened once.\r\n\r\nv1.0 - 8/6/2012\r\n* Initial release",
