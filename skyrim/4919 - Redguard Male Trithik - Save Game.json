  "descriptionHtml": "This is Save Game of my character.\r\nTrithik from Stros M\\'Kai\r\nTrithik is descendant of Rackham family from Stros M\\'Kai. Like his predecessors, He is adventurer and talented warrior of Hammerfell. His parents were implicated in the conspiracy and were publicly executed. He was raised by his uncle, who taught him how to wield a sword and forge weapons. He is not fond of magic and he can cast only basic spells. When he became an adult, he decided to take revenge on the murderer of his family but because he was not experienced in planning the murder, he fail and was banished from the island and in this way he came to the border of Skyrim where once again he fell into an ambush.\r\nAmbush was pledged on Ulfric Stormcloak and his people, and our hero found himself in the wrong place and wrong time. When he awoke he was in a cart with the rest of the prisoners.\r\n\r\nPrisoners were brought to Helgen on the execution. When the Imperial soldiers read their damned list, it turned out that there is not the name of our hero but he went to the block anyway.\r\n\r\nWhen the executioner had cut to his head, then a dragon appeared. In the confusion he managed to escape and at this point begins the adventure.\r\n\r\nEnd of the history of Trithik from Stros M\\'Kai. Now it\\'s time for fun.\r\nI hope you enjoy my character.",
