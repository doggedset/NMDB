  "descriptionHtml": "[b]DANGER - MJOLL&#39;S FOLLOWER DIALOGUE MAY BE DISABLED - DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK UNTIL I FIX IT[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Like many others, I enjoyed Katria&#39;s company during &#34;Lost to the Ages&#34; quest, and was rather sad when she disappeared at the end.\r<br />\r<br />Also like the others, I looked for Katria mods to bring her back as a follower, but sadly they resorted to vanilla follower voices, and robbed her of her unique voice. So I took it upon myself to create a new voiced Katria&#33; I jumped right into the BSAs and spliced out some lines.\r<br />\r<br />She&#39;s located back down in Bthalft, in the courtyard. Doing nothing.\r<br />\r<br />FEATURED:\r<br />- Her original appearance&#33; NO, she doesn&#39;t look like a doll and/or had plastic surgery done to her; she retains her pretty, vanilla appearance.\r<br />- Her original lines, extracted from the game files, spliced to match the situation. She will make idle comments, occasionally about your location. She also recognizes some enemies, as well as Aetherium items you have equipped. Due to limited voice files, some lines appear more than once. I also could not figure out friendly fire lines.\r<br />- Armed with Zephyr and two Skyforge steel daggers; Vah & Koor (Spring & Summer), as well as a special ring.\r<br />- Compatible with AFT, UFO and probably other follower enhancer mods. Why wouldn&#39;t she be?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />NOT FEATURED:\r<br />- A lore friendly explanation why she&#39;s back. I don&#39;t feel like learning how to make a quest, or even create a story. Lore complaints will be disregarded, please utilize your imagination.\r<br />- Marriage option&#33; Sorry&#33; Not enough sound files to work with&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Caution:\r<br />- May break/be broken by other custom voiced followers made by the D16 method. (I don&#39;t use other D16 method followers, or other custom voiced followers in general, so I can&#39;t test)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is my first uploaded mod, so there may things be wrong, or something. Just let me know.\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t upload anywhere else.\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />Voice and all assets property of Bethesda\r<br />Thank the Eight for:\r<br />Unfuzer by greentea101\r<br />BSAopt by Ethatron\r<br />Custom Voiced Follower tutorial by Deck16",
