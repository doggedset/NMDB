We will see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Short Description] *UPDATED*\r\nSparrow has traveled far in search for his unknown twin brother. Sparrow is now in Winterhold, usually in The Frozen Hearth where he offers some service (as hireling) in order to get some gold coins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[His Journey Continues]\r\nSparrow has left Riverwood and is moving deeper into the province of Skyrim, towards a much colder part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Backstory]\r\nHe has a twin and that is why he in the first place was caught on the border to Skyrim. After sometime searching for his twin in other provinces, he ended up in Skyrim. But his twin brother doesn\\'t know about him and Sparrow did just recently (nine months ago) learned that he had a twin brother that was separated from him at birth.\r\n\r\nBut right now he has stopped in Riverwood and are staying at the Sleeping Giant Inn.\r\nBecause after being on the road for a long time plus all the trouble on the way, Sparrow needed to catch his breath and gather his thoughts a little.\r\nAnd he has not given up on finding his twin brother!
