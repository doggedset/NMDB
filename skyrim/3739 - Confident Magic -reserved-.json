  "descriptionHtml": "Hey everyone here is my Confident Sorcerer\\'s Animation  > Endorse <   \r\nNOW WITH MALE ANIMATIONS (sorry i didnt realise they were default female)\r\n\r\nnew video to show fluid movements i was nervous before so the mouse was a bit shakey.\r\n\r\nother fixes: i would have mentioned all this before but i didnt know how to make videos smaller so i thought i was getting the one and leaving it at that but there is all the video\\'s with everything now.\r\n \r\nThis is a combo of all these animations tidied up which i think look very confident and reserved.\r\n\r\n--- Animation Description ---\r\n\r\nWhilst idle with your magic out you will stand as normal unequiped Idle and all strafing and running, and walking will be smooth and normal and not look a mess like vanilla, except walking strafe which will be a more combat ready movement.\r\n\r\nLeft Handed Casting will be similar to vanilla but a little more confident looking and will be the hand you use when you want to look like your putting some real force and power into your spell.\r\n\r\nRight Handed casting will be totally relaxed but the release of the spell itself will be lightning fast making it look frightningly dangerous/vicious.\r\n\r\nDual Casting will look like your channeling power from your core(Heart) but again look controled and confident.\r\n\r\nAlso a superiour looking double chargecast and stream cast.\r\n\r\nCasting spells on yourself with duel cast and left hand also have a much nicer flourish/finish that resembles a finger snap.\r\n\r\n---Animation Fixes---\r\n\r\nThe jittery drag like double casting (not dual casting) is now fixed in this mod, a vanilla bug that annoyed many people.\r\n\r\n\r\n---Youtube Video\\'s---\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1h14BLN6Sg&context=C26665ADOEgsToPDskIPT7Qry7djbHQzGuJqpiYW\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT8eg0zVqME\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qODB78Oll54&feature=plcp&context=C2899cUDOEgsToPDskKG6l1KsCc9DPeP0duqo308\r\n\r\n---Install---\r\n\r\nJust put folder in C:/Program Files/Skyrim/Data/Meshes/Actors/Character\r\n\r\ndont use nexus mod manager apparently it doesnt work using that, just drag it into the folder above.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2275 (btw great mod for balanced magic here) use V1.00 forget the rest any higher version is unbalanced in all the wrong ways.",
