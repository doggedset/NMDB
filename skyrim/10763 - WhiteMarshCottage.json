  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a cozy but convenient playerhouse just outside Whiterun. Contains everything the seasoned dragonslayer could ever need.\r<br />\r<br />Features\r<br />- Lots of storage (some of it labeled) both inside and outside\r<br />- An outdoor smithy with all crafting tools\r<br />- Alchemy and Enchanting lab\r<br />- Cooking area\r<br />- Working bookshelves with room for over 100 books\r<br />- Working displaycases and weapon racks\r<br />- 2 mannequins\r<br />\r<br />Known issues.\r<br />- Companions may get confused in or around the house due to navmesh issue. As I don&#39;t use followers and this was primarily created for personal use, this probably will not be fixed.\r<br />\r<br />Please report bugs and dont hesitate to come with suggestions for improvement and/or future mods.",
