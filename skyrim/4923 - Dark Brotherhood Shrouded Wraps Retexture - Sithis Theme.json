  "summary": "A retexture of the Dark Brotherhood Shrouded Wraps armour from red to black, with red Daedric lettering.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I didn\\'t like the bright red of the Shrouded Wraps so I decided to turn them black and also add some Daedric lettering for a cool effect. The letter is S, for Sithis (the patron deity of the Dark Brotherhood), with another S upside down next to it to make a cool zigzag looking rune effect.\r\n\r\nThis was my first attempt at retexturing - something very simple but it makes a big difference to my character\\'s overall look.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it :)\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\nMANUAL INSTALLATION\r\n---------------------------------\r\nPlace the file into your Skyrim folder:\r\n[where your skyrim is installed, then...]/Skyrim/Data/Textures/clothes/robedarkbrotherhood",
