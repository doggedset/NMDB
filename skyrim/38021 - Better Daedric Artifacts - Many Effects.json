  "descriptionHtml": "One of the complains about Skyrim was that the weapons/armor that you get from Daedric quests, that are supposed to be strong by the lore, arent really strong as they should be and you can easly get to higher damage with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"regular\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" weapons, such as Daedric or Dragonscale. So, this mod simply makes those weapons and armor stronger, so that if you want to use the Mace of Molag Bal for exemple but you couldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t because of the low damge, now it should do more damage and have better effects that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll make it worthy of using.\r\n\r\nNow, this doesnt make the weapons OP or something, just makes them worthy of using as they should be. If I made a weapon/armor too strong or still not worthy of using, please report it in the comments :)\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n\r\nDawnbreaker - Faster, Damage boost, Critical hit damage boost\r\n\r\nEbony Blade - Damage boost, Little speed bonus, Critical hit damage boost, ignore weapon res.\r\n\r\nMace of Molag Bal - Damage boost, Critical hit damage boost, little speed bonus.\r\n\r\nMehrunes Razor - Damage and Critical dmg boost.\r\n\r\nSpellbreaker (shield) -  Armor boost, less weight, seen as light armor.\r\n\r\nValendrung - Big damage boost, Critical hit damage boost, Speed boost (Still slow, its still an axe :P). Ignore weapon res.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nIf you liked, please don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t forget to rank it and thumbs up. ",
