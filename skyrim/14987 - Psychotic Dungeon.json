  "descriptionHtml": "Named it what I did because its fucking psychotic.\r\n\r\nThis is just a 3 stage rudimentary dungeon i scrapped together learning the CK.\r\n\r\nFirst stage is just a nord ruin into a cave, second stage is where the shit hits the fan, I got a little carried away and you might need to console TIM for invuln, but watching the scene play out is pretty epic imo.\r\n\r\nSometimes the dragons win, sometimes the atronochs win, sometimes the humans win, but NEVER do the skeletons win. \r\n(I KNOW THE FUCKING DRAGONS FLY THROUGH WALLS AND SHIT THEY ARE CHUCK NORRIS NINJA DAGRONS!!, so ya... i gave up and just made it work lol)\r\n\r\n3rd stage is just a dwarven ruin.\r\n\r\nI did not really clutter these up or trap them it was just me learning how to do those etc\r\n\r\nI have hit a brick wall on scripting, so if anyone wants to help make some quest mods etc I can design levels populate clutter trap them and provide voice actors. I can do the dialogue trees etc in quest editor but I seriously suck at scripting. My brain hurt after a hour of trying to figure it out. \r\n\r\nVideo (IT IS A SPOILER DO NOT WATCH AMG!!!) http://www.twitch.tv/maveric83eq/b/314710950\r\nYa you hear my friend in vent yapping cause I was streaming for him. \r\n\r\nAnyway enjoy\r\n\r\nMy other files\r\n\r\nSexy Lydia Voice changer      http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14622\r\n(Changes most of Lydias dialogue and random conversation to be more sultry, unique voice actress overdub)\r\n\r\nSHout Changes female to more anime\\'ish  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14323\r\n\r\n",
