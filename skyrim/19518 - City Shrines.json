  "descriptionHtml": "City Shrines v1.1\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />General Information\r<br />\r<br />Shrines are an important part of gameplay, and the world of Skyrim as a whole. Because I use eat/drink/sleep mods and try to avoid fast travel, finding out that I have a disease while I&#39;m in a town that lacks a shrine can be a huge pain. Normally, this wouldn&#39;t be an issue. I would bite the bullet and say &#34;well, I guess I should have brought cure disease potions&#34;, but the fact of the matter is, the people of Tamriel are quite pious, in fact, that&#39;s what the civil war is all about.\r<br />\r<br />I have added shrines to each city and township that lacked one. As for which, I tried to do what made sense for the area.\r<br />\r<br />Here is a list of all the new locations:\r<br />\r<br />Winterhold: Shrine to Talos on the mantle of a fireplace inside one of the destroyed houses.\r<br />   *ETAC version: Sitting upon the memorial to the sunken city instead.\r<br />\r<br />Dawnstar: Shrine to Talos up on a hill to the west, just outside town.\r<br />   *ETAC version: Same spot, but is outside the city walls. Exit the city and hang a right.\r<br />\r<br />Morthal: Shrine to Talos just to the east of Falion&#39;s house, on a small cairn, behind a large rock.\r<br />   *ETAC version: Same spot, but it now possibly harder to find due to the extra buildings.\r<br />    It is still behind Falion&#39;s. To find it easily, go left from the door into Morthal Dry Goods\r<br />    and then slightly right to go behind the large rock.\r<br />\r<br />Dragon Bridge: Shrine to Kynareth on the edge of the cliff across the stream from the lumber mill.\r<br />\r<br />High Hrothgar: Shrines to Akatosh and Kynareth inside the main hall.\r<br />\r<br />Ivarstead: Shrine to Arkay sitting upon an altar inside exterior area of Shroud Hearth Barrow. It is directly across from the door leading into the actual dungeon.\r<br />\r<br />Karthwasten: Shrine to Zenithar across the dirt path from the Miner&#39;s Barracks.\r<br />\r<br />Riverwood: Shrine to Zenithar at the end of the wooden walkway overlooking the bridge to the lumber mill.\r<br />   *ETAC version: ETAC moved the walkway, resulting in a floating shrine. I just moved the shrine\r<br />   to the walkway&#39;s new location.\r<br />\r<br />Shor&#39;s Stone: Shrine to Akatosh on a rock near Odfel and Grogmar&#39;s house, overlooking the road into town.\r<br />\r<br />Darkwater Crossing: Shrine to Talos, across from Verner&#39;s house near the water amongst some plants and trees.\r<br />\r<br />Rorikstead was not included as it already has a (well hidden) Shrine to Akatosh, north of ther Frostfruit Inn, on a hill next to some ruined blocks.\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts\r<br />\r<br />Unlikely, but let me know if something wierd happens.\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Version History\r<br />\r<br />1.0: I done made it.\r<br />\r<br />1.1: Various visual improvements outlined below:\r<br />\r<br />   *Dragon Bridge: Completely remade Shrine to Kynareth. It was ugly. It was made before I realized I was going to be releasing it to the public.\r<br />\r<br />   *Added light sources to several candles that were missing them (oops).\r<br />\r<br />   *Added &#34;flavor items&#34; to nearly all shrines, to give the impression of human activity.\r<br />      +This is usually books, offerings, and tools.\r<br />      -The one in Winterhold was left alone, as it is supposed to appear abandoned.\r<br />      -Left High Hrothgar untouched, as the Greybeards seem to value a more spartan environment for worship and meditation.\r<br />      -Left Ivarstead alone, as it&#39;s likely been abandoned for some time.\r<br />\r<br />1.1 ETAC: New version compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13608/?]ETAC[/url], since ETAC moves some assets around.\r<br />      \r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Bugs and Feedback\r<br />\r<br />There shouldn&#39;t be any issues. I made sure that each one functioned and did not interfere with any other existing vanilla objects. I may have moved a plant here and there and added a few rocks, but that shouldn&#39;t be a big deal.\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Distribution\r<br />\r<br />Please do not redistribute this file in any way, shape, or form.
