  "descriptionHtml": "Compatible with all follower mods as it is a simple BAT file with an ESP fix to make it permanent.\r<br />\r<br />I use this mod on my mortal NPCs (not essential or protected) with Extensible Follower Framework and Populated Lands so I can recruit random NPCs such as Travelers, Merchants, Hunters and make them heal their wounds after combat.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is simple: it makes any NPC you use it on regenerate health over time when they are not in combat.\r<br />\r<br />To install:\r<br />Place both txt filse and esp in your Skyrim&#39;s Data Folder and enable AutoHeal.esp\r<br />\r<br />To use:\r<br />Open up the console (~)\r<br />Click on the NPC or follower and type &#34;bat autoheal&#34; without the parentheses and hit enter.\r<br />If healing is too slow for you, I added a faster auto heal and just do &#34;bat fasterautoheal&#34; instead which is doubled.\r<br />\r<br />The NPC should automatically regenerate his health over time after or if he is not in combat.\r<br />\r<br />The default heal rate value for NPCs in the vanilla game who did have it is 0.7. Feel free to change the number in the bat files.",
