  "descriptionHtml": "================\r\nDetails\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis is an add-on intended for Witcher5688\\'s Witcher2 Replace Mod - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22054\r\n\r\nWhilst playing the above mod, I noticed that the Riften guards were unchanged from vanilla and that just didn\\'t sit right with me. I used some assets from other Witcher mods to create this simple guard overhaul for Riften. I went for a toned-down look compared to the Witcher-style guards in other towns, as Riften always seemed like a run-down town, Additionally, some dialogue from the Jarl of Riften implies that resources are stretched thin. So I thought that guards should look less well-equipped than the guards of, say, Whiterun. Overall, I think that the style works - the guards look like they belong in Riften. I hope that you agree.\r\n\r\nThe guards wear one set of armour (cuirass, gloves and shield), one type of shield and two helmet variants. All pieces are usable by the player.\r\n\r\n================\r\nRequirements\r\n================\r\n\r\nThe Witcher 2 - HD Retexture of Craftable Seltkirk Armor by geraltdirivia and Suhoi72 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10834\r\n\r\nNOTE: You have the option of two downloads, with similar yet separate texture sets. I recommend the Suhoi72 download.\r\n\r\nNot essential, but this mod will make most sense when used alongside the Witcher2 Replace Mod - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22054\r\n\r\n================\r\nInstallation\r\n================\r\n\r\nInstall meshes and textures from Witcher 2 - HD Retexture of Craftable Seltkirk Armor by Suhoi72 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10834\r\n\r\n(you can download and install with NMM)\r\n\r\nDownload and install my mod with NMM is recommended, or manually extract to your date folder.\r\n\r\n================\r\nInstallation\r\n================\r\n\r\nUninstall via NMM, or manually delete the files.\r\n\r\n================\r\nCredit\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis mod would not have been possible without meshes and textures from:\r\n\r\nThe Witcher 2 - HD Retexture of Craftable Seltkirk Armor by geraltdirivia and Suhoi72 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10834\r\nWitcher 2 Shield Pack by redxavier - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7328\r\nWitcher 2 Helmet Pack by redxavier - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7159\r\n\r\nand finally, CD Projekt Red - developers of the Witcher 2 who have kindly allowed their meshes and textures to be used in other projects provided they are given credit.\r\n\r\nOn a personal note, I learned a lot about the Creation Kit whilst making this admittedly simple mod. CK modding is certainly not as challenging as I\\'d first feared. I heartily recommend that people dive in and start modding.",
