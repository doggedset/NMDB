  "descriptionHtml": "=====================================================\r\nERGONOMICS\\' REVENGE: 360 CONTROL SCHEME\r\n=====================================================\r\n\r\nSimply put, a 360 Gamepad remap based on my sense of ergonomics.\r\n- Power and Sprint are assigned to buttons where they can be used in comfortable conjunction with your weapons.\r\n- Hotkeys are staggered across three different input locations; I don\\'t know about you, but I don\\'t need (and find it distracting and detrimental) to have eight hotkeys of equal importance, [b]which all require you to move your thumb off of the control stick[/b], which is what a lot of these control maps end up doing. Instead, you are given four on the D-Pad (powers/shouts/less used spells), two on the shoulders - ideal for your primary pair of weapons or spells - and two that require a button combo and thus are well-suited to things you like to use but don\\'t need at a touch in a fight. (e.g. potions of strength, etc.)\r\n- The Favorites menu is mapped so it doesn\\'t require moving your left thumb.\r\n- This is the control mapping I use to playtest [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17353]The Revenge of Colette[/url] as of v3.0. \r\n- Installation is simple: drop the folder in the rar directly into your Skyrim folder. If there is an existing \\\"ControlMap_Custom.txt\\\" file in the Skyrim folder, it should be backed up or renamed. Uninstallation is merely reversing these steps.\r\n- Mod would not be possible if not for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/88]Interface Hard Coded Key Tweaks and Skyrim Key Helper by crazy-g[/url].\r\n\r\nLeft Trigger: Left Hand/Block\r\nRight Trigger: Right Hand/Block\r\n\r\nA: Activate\r\nB: Jump\r\nX: Nothing\r\nY: Power\r\n\r\nX+Y: Favorites\r\nX+A: Sheath\r\nX+B: Wait\r\n\r\nLeft Shoulder: Hotkey 5\r\nRight Shoulder: Hotkey 6\r\nX+Left Shoulder: Hotkey 7\r\nX+Right Shoulder: Hotkey 8\r\n\r\nLeft Thumb: Sprint\r\nX+Left Thumb: Sneak\r\nRight Thumb: PoV\r\nRight Thumb+Left Stick: Zoom\r\n\r\nD-Up: Hotkey 1\r\nD-Left: Hotkey 2\r\nD-Down: Hotkey 3\r\nD-Right: Hotkey 4\r\n\r\nX+Up: Skills\r\nX+Left: Magic\r\nX+Right: Inventory\r\nX+Down: Screenshot\r\n\r\nBack: Map\r\nX+Back: Quicksave\r\nStart: Journal\r\nX+Start: Quickload\r\n\r\nBack will also alter whether you are buying from or selling to a vendor in their screen, and the shoulder buttons toggle sorting in SkyUI.",
