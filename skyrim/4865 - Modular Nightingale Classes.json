  "descriptionHtml": "The premise of this mod is that everyone likes to make their character look good but sometimes good looks come at the cost of crappy enchantments. Well, no more, I say!\r\n\r\nI really like the look of the Nightingale Armor but it had some kinda crappy enchantments so I fired up SkyEdit and fixed it. After I uploaded the files I got a couple of good requests and then I realized that the best way to handle this is to just release a modular version which contains a set of armor for different character classes.\r\n\r\nHere are the different plug-ins and changes in detail:\r\n\r\n*Nightingale Assassin*\r\nGiven the exact same enchantments as the Ancient Shrouded Armor from the Dark Brotherhood missions.\r\n-Armor-\r\nIncreases Poison Resistance by 100%\r\n-Boots-\r\nMuffle (Move more quitely.)\r\n-Gloves-\r\nBackstab (Double sneak attack damage with one handed weapons.)\r\n-Hood-\r\nBows do 40% more damage\r\n\r\n*Nightingale Knight*\r\nFor the character that wants to be a knight but doesn\\'t want to look like one!\r\n-All Armor peices changed to Heavy Armor and given the same armor rating as Blades Armor\r\n-Armor-\r\nIncrease your Health by 70 points\r\n-Boots-\r\nCarrying Capacity Increased by 50 points\r\n-Gloves-\r\nOne-Handed attacks do 40% more damage\r\n-Hood-\r\nStamina Regenerates 50% faster\r\n\r\n*Nightingale Knight Light*\r\nExact same thing as Nightingale Knight except it\\'s Light Armor instead of Heavy Armor.\r\n\r\n*Nightingale Mage*\r\nAll armor rating has been removed for the armor. The game now recognized the Nightingale Armor as clothing so your Mage Armor perk should still work. (Needs to be tested)\r\n-Armor-\r\nSame Enchantment as the Archmage\\'s Robes. (All spells cost 15% less to cast, +50 Magicka, +100% Magicka Regeneration)\r\n-Boots-\r\nIncrease Magic Resistance by <mag>%\r\n-Gloves-\r\nSpells cost 3% less to cast.\r\n-Hood-\r\nSame Enchantment as the Diadem of the Savant. (All spells cost 5% less to cast.)\r\n\r\n*Nightingale Mage Armor*\r\nSame thing as the Nightingale Mager but is still classified as light armor. This WILL affect your Mage Armor perk.\r\n\r\n*Nightingale Ranger*\r\nAll-purpose armor for Rangers, Rogues, Thieve and Assassins\r\n-Armor-\r\nIncrease Light Armor skill by 25 points\r\n-Boots-\r\nMuffle (Again, you move quietly.)\r\n-Gloves-\r\nOne-Handed attacks do 40% more damage.\r\n-Hood-\r\nBows do 40% more damage.\r\n\r\n*Nightingale Warrior*\r\nAll purpose armor for the big-ass ass-kickers and Berzerker class. Note: Again all armor has been changed to Heavy Armor and give the same armor rating as the Blades Armor.\r\n-Armor-\r\nHealth Regenerates 50% faster.\r\n-Boots-\r\nStamina Regenerates 50% faster.\r\n-Gloves-\r\nTwo-Handed attacks do 40% more damage.\r\n-Hood-\r\nIncrease Magic Resistance by <mag>%\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nIf you\\'re using Nexus Mod Manager then just download, activate the mod, check the plug-in that you want to use and profit.\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\nExtract the content to the Skyrim/Data folder. Activate the one you want to use. Profit.\r\n\r\nONLY USE ONE AT A TIME!! I cannot stress that enough. If you try to use more than one at a time your game will break. DON\\'T DO IT!\r\n\r\nRemember: If you use it, Endorse it! Don\\'t be a d-bag.",
