Normal arrows are now Craftable as well, provided you have the smithing level perks. \r\n\r\nFound in the Riverwood Trader Shop, in a basket by the door. \r\nYou have to craft more after that. \r\n\r\nFire Arrows Burn like an Oil Lamp explosion.\r\nIce Arrows have an icey blast.\r\nStun Arrows knock down a group making an easy kill. \r\nLightning Arrows explode in a ball of lightning. \r\nLight arrows Illuminate your way. \r\nSteel Impact Arrows to knock a person back. \r\nNormal arrows are all craftable as well. \r\n\r\nHope you have fun with them.\r\n\r\nUPDATED: Changed the requirements for Fire Arrows and Steel Impact Arrows. I made the fire arrows use \\\"Tomes of flames\\\" Instead of fireball scrolls. Impact arrows now use just steel ingots and leather strips. I also made impact arrows have a smaller impact effect zone.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I Never turned off comments, Nexus is being weird and not letting me unlock them even tho i have them set to unlocked.",
