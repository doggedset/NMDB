They are one of the beast races which inhabit the continent of Tamriel, primarily their home province of Elsweyr. They are one of the ten default playable races, and are known for their natural agility, stealth, and Moon Sugar, which can be refined into skooma. They travel around selling their wares but are not usually trusted. They also usually talk about themselves in third person, such as with J\\'zargo, and Kharjo. Such as \\\"J\\'zargo is leaving now, J\\'zargo bids you farewell\\\", or \\\"Kharjo is ready to fight now\\\".\r\n\r\n-=Thanks BETHESDA Softwork=-",
