  "descriptionHtml": "I spent a little time attempting to make my new \\\"The Ashen - Oriental Beauty Race\\\" character look something similar to Japanese model Hiroku Anzai. She definitely looks Japanese and is pretty darn cute but I am not sure I did Ms. Anzai any justice. She includes the Blades Armor (You,ll have to find the gauntlets, boots and helmet on your own)\r\n\r\nShe is equipped with a Blades Katana, Tytanis\\'s; Wakazashi, Tanto, and Nodachi two handed sword.\r\n\r\nYou will need these mods below: \r\n\r\nThe Ashen - Oriental Beauty Race by Seren4XX and RadioRagae - Ashen Option for the Dimonized UNP Body - gives her a softer appearance IMHO.\r\n\r\nTytanis - The Ultimate Mod - Crafts - Spells - Items - MORE \r\n\r\nDaisho symbol of Samurai by Abakus http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4936\r\n\r\nMy take on Makeup on Female and Male NPC\\'s not being \\\"Lore Friendly\\\"\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of people playing this game that think the use of make-up is not lore friendly and so they are hesitant about using character mods like mine that use makeup or beautification mods. I would ask you to consider these following historical tidbits in relation to being lore friendly. Makeup is documented to have been used by the Ancient Egyptians over 10,000 years ago by paleontologists. Makeup was also documented to be in use by the Greeks, Romans and other ancient societies, including tribal body and face painting by Ancient Briton and Germanic tribes. To me it is completely plausible for makeup to be used in Skyrim given Bethesda supplied it and used it in the game on its own NPC\\'s. Inescapably Skyrim\\'s lore is tied to our history in some way shape or form, the latest \\\"trend\\\" of having NPC\\'s look more natural is more likely a current trend in modern use of makeup and not a direct reflection on the lore of this game or any game that that bases its lore partially on human medieval and ancient history. It is inarguable that Skyrim spans the times from early man to the late 16th century with the various in-game elements it provides us. Note the use of mammoths and saber tooth cats and then fast forward to some of the more modern items in the game such as steel bear traps (which were recorded to be first in use in the late 16th century). It is perfectly fine and period to this game to have your characters kicking ass in black eyeliner, eye shadow and red lipstick. Don\\'t let someone tell you it isn\\'t lore friendly because it really is. Given the choices of races we have in Skyrim it may not only be lore friendly but very plausible on some characters depending on their status and rank within their society. In the end it is completely your choice on how you want your NPC\\'s and PC\\'s to look. I personally am not interested in having androgyny rule my game so I opted to creating and sharing my own female characters that cannot be mistaken for anything else. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\n\r\nFalmerBane",
