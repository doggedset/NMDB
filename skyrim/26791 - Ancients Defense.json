  "summary": "Ever wonder why there was a helm of Yngol with frost resist and a helm of the unburned with a fire resist? Ever wanted to combine the two? Nope? Well I did and this is that mod.",
  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE:\r\nJust finishing off creating the new mesh, should have it up later tonight after I just cut and paste the textures around a bit to make it fit. Should start with the new textures in the next few days. Also looking for someone who would be interested in creating a quest to obtains this helm.\r\n\r\nAdds a new helmet to the game located in the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood, the helmet can be found on the floor refer to the screenshot. I think it still has to be stolen but I might have fixed the problem, if not just drop a comment and ill see if I can fix it. I am going to be working on making a custom mesh for this helm, something like the deer antlers on the side but also with the addition of the vertical horns found on some high level Draugr and the helm of Yngol, I am also going to try and complete a new darker texture and a lighter texture so that it fits in with Deadric and Dragonplate armour.\r\n\r\nAncient\\'s Defense:\r\nThis helm uses the model of the female ancient Nord helm for every race. It is already enchanted with the same enchant used on Otar the Mads mask, 30% resist to frost fire and shock. Currently working on a new enchantment with stronger and new effects, hopefully wont be too strong though.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nExtract contents to the Data folder in your Skyrim directory. \r\n\r\nBugs:\r\nNot player owned yet\r\nMay not work on every race\r\n\r\nPlease leave feedback in the comments section.",
