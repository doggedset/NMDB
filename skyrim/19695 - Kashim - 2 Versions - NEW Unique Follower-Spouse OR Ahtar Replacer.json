  "summary": "Adds new, unique Redguard follower/spouse to Skyrim or replaces vanilla follower Ahtar.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p215/faeriexxdecay/kashimheader1.png[/IMG][/center]\r\nKashim Blackheart, a stalwart Redguard male, has come to Skyrim to provide you, the Dragonborn, with his sturdy shield and sharp sword.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds Kashim, an able-bodied sword and shield user that comes equipped with a leveled weapon and shield and powerful 1-handed perks, ready to fight beside you or become your enamored spouse. There are [color=#CC3300]two versions[/color] of this unique follower.\r\n\r\n[center][color=#CC3300][b]ONLY CHOOSE ONE OF THESE.[/b][/color][/center]\r\n[b]In version 1[/b], Kashim will come set with a default steel plate outfit, meaning he will [color=#CC3300]never be naked[/color]. You can give him any armor you choose and he should switch to that armor, but if you remove all the armor from his inventory, he will default back to his steel plate outfit.\r\n\r\n[b]In version 2[/b], Kashim will [color=#CC3300]NOT[/color] have a default outfit and will thus probably be undressed the first time you see him. He comes with steel plate armor in his inventory, but you will need to access his inventory and remove/add from it to force him to equip something. This way, he will wear whatever you give him, but it is also possible to completely undress him for whatever reason. Unless you have body replacers installed, Kashim will just be in his underwear when you first meet. :)\r\n\r\nKashim New Follower Features:\r\nAvailable as a follower AND can be married.\r\nIncreased speed, set as essential, 1-handed shield user with extra health and stamina.\r\nPowerful 1-handed perks.\r\nFind him at [color=#CC3300]The Winking Skeever in Solitude[/color].\r\nStarting level 10, max level possible 99.\r\n[color=#CC3300][b]NOTE:[/b][/color] This new follower is scripted to return to the inn if you dismiss him. I find this a convenient option that helps make it less likely to lose your follower. He does not have his own home (that\\'s the inn!), so it is recommended to tell him to move in with you when you marry!\r\n\r\n[center]---------------------------------[/center]\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p215/faeriexxdecay/kashimheader2.png[/IMG][/center]\r\nThis option will change the vanilla follower Ahtar\\'s physical features to match Kashim and also adds a few improvements without changing too much of how he works in vanilla. If you already use Ahtar or would rather have an executioner for a follower instead of a 1-handed shield user, this option is for you!\r\n\r\nChanges made to Ahtar:\r\nSpeed increased to 125.\r\nDisposition increased to 75.\r\nSet to be essential.\r\nMood raised to Neutral.\r\nAdded Player\\'s Ally Status.\r\n[color=#CC3300]CANNOT BE MARRIED![/color] Ahtar has a girlfriend and likes her a lot, apparently.\r\nAdded Perks: Barbarian, Champion\\'s Stance, Devastating Blow, Great Critical Charge, Sweep, Deep Wounds, Limbsplitter, Skullcrusher\r\nEntire appearance changed to resemble Kashim.\r\nFind Ahtar in [color=#CC3300]Solitude.\r\nTo find him:[/color] If you have never visited Solitude before, you will see him in a cutscene; he is the executioner. After your initial visit, he follows a schedule: works as a jailor starting at 8 a.m. for 12 hours, then eats at the inn for 4 hours, and then goes home to Jala\\'s house to sleep for 8 hours. I find it\\'s easiest to catch him right as he returns home but before he heads to sleep, usually between 8 p.m. and 12 a.m.\r\n\r\n[color=#CC3300][b]INSTALL[/b][/color]\r\nFor ease of use, download and install using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/modmanager]Nexus Mod Manager[/url].\r\nFor manual install, simply extract the contents of the archive into your Data folder.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6]BOSS[/url] is recommended for proper mod sorting!\r\n[color=#CC3300][b]This mod is FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH UFO![/b] Simply load my plugin AFTER UFO.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#CC3300]Kashim\\'s Look[/color]\r\nIf you want Kashim to look like the screenshots, please take a look at these wonderful mods!\r\nAlso keep in mind that Kashim should work with ANY texture replacers, these are just recommendations.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488]Better Males[/url] - Younger Geonox Faces Without Beard + FavoredSoul Meshes\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4141]High Res Face Maps for Men by Geonox[/url] - Original version of the amazing facial textures by Geonox, minus the other stuff from Better Males.

Great balance of beauty and performance and doesn\\'t even slow down my low-medium machine!\r\n\r\n[color=#CC3300][b]SPECIAL THANKS[/b][/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/4257724]Kataous[/url] for the original Kashim and for the request to create an attractive Redguard.
