Due to the large size of the 'bik' file.\n<br />[color=orange]NOTE 2:[/color] If you are one of those who install mods very often and you try them over and over again with the \"open-close\" method. [color=red]I DONT RECOMMEND THIS INTRO.[/color] It can be VERY tedious watch it over and over again. (For there is no \"skip\" option... not jet)\n<br />_______________________________________________________________\n<br />\n<br />When I started up Skyrim to playing the 93 mods I added, the [color=red]\"Bethesda Logo\"[/color] was not enough epic as the mods are. So I made this Intro to fix that.\n<br />\n<br />It was simple, (well, not really). It was very difficult to get the \"Live Action Skyrim\" commercial, but when I finally got it, many things were so easy.\n<br />First I converted the video in a 'avi' file, I added some sound effects with (an almost) precision and finally, I converted the whole project in a 'bik' file.\n<br />\n<br />If the Video doesn't load in the [color=orange]VIDEO[/color] sections, here's the video:\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]WzaFHVphTco[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[color=green]For more information about installing, read the \"Read Me\" text file.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=red]CREDITS:[/color]\n<br />-The Dragonborn Comes (Female Cover by Malukah)\n<br />Malukah's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/malufenix\n<br />-Orock1musicO, and the collaborators: Eidelnos, zeldaxlove64, Triforcefilms andÂ Christina Grimmie (Rest in Peace).\n<br />-Skyrim Live Action Commercial by Bethesda Softworks\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />I hope you all enjoy!
