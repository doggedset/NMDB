  "summary": "A load of cheating weapons and armors what are fully for cheaters. - UPDATED",
  "descriptionHtml": "I recently made a mod quite quickly what creates another set of daedric stuff for the player to toy around with, It adds a superbow, super armor available to craft in any normal forge but no the sky forge. I\\'ve not tested it with any DLC so i\\'m unsure as of yet if it will work. It keeps gliching out with my files so i\\'m having to take care when making the updates as i lost the dagger i was making. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=5][b]Video:[/b][/size][/color]\r\nMy Video.\r\n[youtube]N8DRD8uaRSQ[/youtube]\r\n\r\nMy New Video\r\n[youtube]8PELiIQJWSs[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000]THIS IS PURELY A CHEATING MOD AS EVERYTHING WILL MAX YOU OUT AS FAST AS YOU CAN SAY \\\"BOB\\'S YOUR UNCLE\\\" Do NOT use this in a legit save or you\\'ll screw up your game.[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=5][b]Current Items:[/b][/size][/color]\r\nUnknown-SuperBow - 1 Firewood - In the Iron Section of crafting at the bottom. \r\nSuperArmor - 1 Firewood per armor set (4 all together) - In the Deadric section.\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=5][b]Upcoming:[/b][/size][/color]\r\nMore weapons,\r\nMore Animals,\r\nHarder Boss,\r\nCustom Textures,\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=5][b]Cautions:[/b][/size][/color]\r\nThese weapons and armor will make you level up INSANELY fast. I tested it with a dagger and 2 hits got me 100 one handed skill and 10-20 levels up.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I made this mod completely for fun, and the textures will look the same for a while as i need to change them but don\\'t know of how this moment.\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000][size=5][b]Current Bugs:[/b][/size][/color]\r\nIf you press F and move you can\\'t use the weapon properly, to avoid this managing you to get into 3rd person, You\\'ve only got to scroll the middle mouse button both ways to go in and out of 1st and 3rd person.",
