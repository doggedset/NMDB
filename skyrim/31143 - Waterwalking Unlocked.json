  "summary": "Allows you to disenchant a small pair of boots, and enchant any ring/boot/amulet with Waterwalking. Requires Dragonborn",
  "descriptionHtml": "-REQUIRES DRAGONBORN-\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n---------------------\r\nDragonborn adds Waterwalking. That is great. However, aside from a few potions and a Heavy Armor pair of boots it can\\'t be accessed. That is entirely unfair to mages and light armor users. I remedied this by making my own waterwalking enchantment and placed it on a disenchantable pair of boots. The enchantment can be placed on rings, amulets, and boots. Maybe clothing. I\\'m too lazy to remember. \r\n\r\nWhere to find the boots:\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nFollow the coast south from the Strident Squall. You\\'ll eventually come to \\\"Girmir\\'s Chest,\\\" a chest that contains some potions of waterbreathing which you will need. Standing in front of the chest, look straight out into the sea. Go forward and keep to the ocean floor, you\\'ll eventually find Girmir\\'s body. The boots are on him. Girmir is underwater and wearing Waterwalking boots for a completely unexplainable reason. Use your imagination. \r\n\r\nOkay, I lied, it is an explainable story. Here it is as presented by Isphus and Elforia:\r\n\r\nGirmir was on his way to Morrowind from Solstheim when he was struck by a wave and turned upside down. His boots and feet stayed on the surface as he fervently searched for those Waterbreathing potions he totally forgot in his chest back on shore. He drowned and the boots filled with water pulling him to the bottom of the sea. The End. \r\n\r\nNotices:\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nIf anyone feels that I\\'ve made it too easy to obtain waterwalking, please tell me. I\\'m not a fan of mods that makes things too easy, and I\\'ll likely place the boots somewhere more challenging. However, if more people are fine with it then I\\'ll keep it this way.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n------------------------------\r\nMe - Everything\r\nBethesda - Dragonborn, a great DLC, Waterwalking, Skyrim\r\nSoda pop - the nectar of the Gods\r\nIsphus and Elforia: Coming up with a plausible story for Girmir",
