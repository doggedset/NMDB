  "descriptionHtml": "Uploaded for a friend. We both hated how it constantly rained mammoths and giants after they randomly decided to start walking 10000 feet in the air. I tried and tried to fix the bug. The HKX Havok files yielded no answers, and neither did the race records in Skyrim.esm. Mysterious&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Soooo...this is not a stereotypical bug fix. Since it seems that the giant and mammoth races are beyond repair, this mod removes them entirely from the game. \r<br />\r<br />Giants are changed to frost trolls, and mammoths are changed to cows. The &#34;new&#34; frost trolls are passive, like giants.\r<br />\r<br />There are two esp files (one for each race) so feel free to use one or the other, or both.\r<br />\r<br />The giant remover requires Dawnguard, because of the added frost giants.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />To Do:\r<br />\r<br />-Remove the name &#34;Giant&#34; and &#34;Mammoth&#34; from the changed NPCs.\r<br />-Make the trolls bigger.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />NOTES:\r<br />\r<br />This mod will likely cause issues with mods that add duplicates of the giant race. You&#39;ve been warned.\r<br />\r<br />If you load a saved game after installing a mod and find bugged trolls and cows, try disabling them and then enabling them using console commands. That irons them out.",
