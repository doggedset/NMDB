What are you even talking about&#33;? Of course you are&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod is an attempt at creating a more original katana, but it also includes a new armor set that goes nice with the sword: white thalmor robes with enchantments that are useful to all classes.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s also worth mentioning that this mod adds a small dungeon as well as a quest, so obtaining the sword is a little more interesting than simply crafting it, buying it, finding it laying on the ground, or cheating it into the game... but, if this sounds unappealing to you, then there&#39;s a &#34;no dungeon&#34; version that you can use.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[center][u][b]Reviews / showcases[/b][/u] (because these things need their own category)[/center]\r<br />-------------------------↓ Fancy showcase by Nozi87 ↓------------------------\r<br />[youtube]dSN5RTFTAr0[/youtube]\r<br />-------------------------↓ Review EonBY ↓------------------------\r<br />[youtube]upq_0zIcV9U[/youtube]\r<br />-------------------------↓ Review Seriezs↓------------------------\r<br />[youtube]y73n57fMygg[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[center][u][b]Acquisition[/b][/u] (also known as, HOW DO I GET IT?)[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Through killing a boss (Primary method):[/b]\r<br />Start &#34;The Legendary Blade&#34; quest by either buying the &#34;Imitation of a Legendary Blade&#34; from Ulfberth [i](the shop owner of Warmaiden&#39;s in Whiterun)[/i], or by entering the Timeless Dungeon [i](assuming you know where the entrance is)[/i], after which you will have to follow the quest objectives to find Alidax the Timeless Ruler of Abyss.\r<br />\r<br />He carries two Tear of Abyss katanas and the whole Timeless armor set, and there&#39;s also a chest behind his chair, in which you should find two shorter versions, as well as a two-handed version of the Tear of Abyss katana.\r<br />I said &#34;you should find&#34; instead of &#34;you will find&#34; because Alidax will sometimes steal stuff from said chest, so be sure to always check his dead corpse.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Through buying (Secondary method):[/b] \r<br />This [b]REQUIRES[/b] that you download the &#34;Tear of Abyss no dungeon&#34; version of this mod, in which you will be able to purchase the katanas as well as the whole armor set directly from Ulfberth.\r<br />I repeat, this method doesn&#39;t exist in the default version of this mod, and the prices are extremely high for average players.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Through crafting:[/b] \r<br />You can create replicas at the forge through the Daedric category, those replicas will have no enchantments, but the stats will be the same as their original counterparts.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Through cheating:[/b]\r<br />Open the console by pressing the ~ key located below Esc, and type this:\r<br />  [i]help &#34;tear of abyss&#34;[/i]\r<br />Now look for a line that says:\r<br />  [i]WEAP:  (8digitcode) &#39;Tear of Abyss&#39;[/i]\r<br />In my case, the 8digitcode is 2B000D63, so this is what I will have to type:\r<br />  [i]player.additem 2B000D63 1[/i]\r<br />In case you followed my instructions correctly, you should now have the weapon, and if you want the armor set, you&#39;ll need to type:\r<br />  [i]help timeless[/i]\r<br />And repeat the &#34;player.additem&#34; process 4 times with each armor piece.\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[center][u][b]Installation[/b][/u][/center]\r<br />\r<br />1&gt;Unzip the archive inside Skyrim&#39;s Data folder\r<br />2&gt;Start &#34;SkyrimLauncher&#34;\r<br />3&gt;Click on &#34;Data Files&#34;
