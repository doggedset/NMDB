Return to Tallon IV is a mini side adventure for Metroid fans to conquer. Within the mod you can explore several areas from Metroid Prime, including the Canyon Cavern, the Landing Site and the Alcove. In these areas you can find different pieces of new equipment, those being the Gunship Blade -- a custom reskinned sword made from the same material as Samus&#39; gunship from MP3 -- Varia Space Jump Boots and Varia Gauntlets that have unique abilites and enchantments. Beware, though, as a familar foe resides within. That&#39;s right, Return to Tallon IV features a Meta Ridley reskinned dragon that you&#39;ll have to face if you want to get out alive&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This is a Work In Progress (WIP), it&#39;s fully functional but things are continually added. Enjoy the mod and GO METROID&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />**Check the gallery for entrance location.

I could have easily put it in.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Thanks to the Nexus user &#39;IsharaMeradin&#39; for creating the majority of the Varia Space Jump Boots higher jump script&#33;[/b]",
