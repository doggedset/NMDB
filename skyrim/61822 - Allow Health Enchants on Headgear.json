  "descriptionHtml": "Enchant Head health/health regen by ZHOOL\r<br />\r<br />There aren&#39;t really any head enchant options for melee toons... archery mebbe. This mod allows health and health regen enchants to be applied to above the shoulder boulder holders. In vanilla, beth mostly limits enchant types to four slots each - except health regen, which was 3. Allowing another melee skill buff, eg fortify one-handed, would probably be OP (sif 4 isn&#39;t already OP), but I figure there&#39;s not much harm with regard to balance in buffing HP/HP regen, and melee toons wouldn&#39;t feel like their hat is decorative. The mod applies to cloth hats, circlets and helmets. \r<br />\r<br />Installation: copy .esp to skyrim&#92;data, and activate using data files option in skyrim splash screen. Removing the mod will not effect items created using the mod or cause any issues.",
