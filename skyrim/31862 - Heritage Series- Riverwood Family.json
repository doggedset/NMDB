  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE: VERSION 2.0\r\n\r\n     The new version makes the following changes:\r\n      \r\n     - new voices for the characters\r\n     - improved navmesh (mostly just tidying the old one up)\r\n     - new horse named Family Mare\r\n     - mother is now dead. her gravestone is on the ledge behind the house\r\n     - fixed clipping issue with ledge behind the house\r\n     - npcs now address the player in unisex terms instead of \\\"son\\\" or \\\"brother\\\"\r\n\r\nTo update from the previous version, just copy and paste new files into your data folder, and overwrite exsisting ones when prompted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\n     The first in a series of mods focusing on adding a sense of belonging and purpose to Skyrim. I have been playing TES games for about 10 years now and i always had a strange connection to the province of Skyrim. In Morrowind and Cyrodill, my characters were always outlanders from this province and when i new they were making TesV in Skyrim i thought to myself, my character can finally go home. This mod goes even further and adds the character\\'s dad, mom, and brother Roland to the game, as well as the family home just outside Riverwood.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n     -all npcs are fully voiced and have AI packages. Dad works down at Alvor\\'s Smithing shop during the day, Mom can be found at home and at the Riverwood Trader getting supplies, Roland works at the Inn in the Evenings, and can be asked to acompany the player on their journeys.\r\n\r\n     -New home is fully navmeshed\r\n\r\n     -Dialogue is based on what real families would discuss\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\n     Tim C. - voice of Dad\r\n\r\n     Tammy C. - voice of mom\r\n\r\n     Nick C. - voice of Roland\r\n\r\nFUTURE OF THE HERITAGE SERIES (in no particular order)\r\n\r\n    - Heritage bow (custom made weapon\r\n\r\n    - office and store for the character in Whiterun with custom voiced characters\r\n\r\n    - new followers and extended family\r\n\r\n    - purchasable properties and homes\r\n\r\nPERMISSIONS\r\n\r\n     If you would like to change anything about the mod in order to better suit your play style, all i can say is have at it. Thats the beauty of this game and community, we all know what we like and every one is good with supplying the rest of us with the means to be able to accomplish just that. Al I ask is that if you release something under your name involving this mod, just credit me and maybe send me a message so that i can check it out for myself. thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
