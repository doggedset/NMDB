  "descriptionHtml": "[b][center][size=20pt][color=red]DRAGON CLAWS WITH SOLUTIONS[/color][/size][/b][/center]\r\n\r\nThis mod simply adds the solution for each dragon claw into it\\'s name, so all you have to do is look at it in the game world, or view it in your inventory, and you\\'ll know right away what the solution is. For example, \\\"Golden Claw\\\" becomes \\\"Golden Claw (Bear, Moth, Owl)\\\". No more zooming, tilting, turning, shifting, and twisting the object around needed.\r\n\r\nIf I happened to miss one or put the wrong solution into a name, let me know.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nInstallation: Just extract \\\"Dragon Claws with Solutions.esp\\\" into your Data folder, enable it in whatever you use to launch the game, and play.
