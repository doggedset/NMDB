  "descriptionHtml": "----Description----\r\n\r\nSince everyone is uploading their own.  I thought I might as well share my own.  This is my tweaks.  These settings focus on improve upon vanilla look in every aspect possible without some problems that are caused by using the injector.  \r\n\r\n----Detail explanation---- \r\n\r\n(Just skip it and make your decision base on the screenshots if you don\\'t want to read)\r\n\r\nAs expected, I tuned the saturation up to make it feel much more realistic and pleasant to look at.  For those who have used and tweaked the settings before, you will notice using TECHNICOLOR will somehow give you a bit of a blue overlay of sorts (especially at night time and loading screen).  But tuning it too low or off completely will make lightning contrast really ugly, the saturation would also be a bit hard to control right.  So my settings address that to minimize that blue overlay.  Which is now unnoticeable at anytime but at night, but I think it still much better than vanilla\\'s.  Another problem with using saturation is the lightning would be too saturated when in interior places.  The lights that are reflected off walls are really yellow and weird.  While I wouldn\\'t say I fixed it, but I think I reduced it as much as possible without making the game black and white.  I like high sharpen effect to make the texture look more \\\"high res\\\", so it might be a bit high for those who like more vanilla/blurry style.  But check out the screenshots, see if you like it.  If not, you can easily change that yourself, there are only one value to tweak.\r\n\r\n----Install----\r\n\r\n1. Download Version 1.2 or 1.3.  1.2 settings will have FXAA, and 1.3 will not.\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=131\r\n2. Put the injFX_Settings.h file you downloaded from me to where your skyrim installed (where TESV.exe is located)\r\n\r\n----Uninstall----\r\nReplace injFX_Settings.h with other one of your desire, or delete it if you no longer uses FXAA Injector.\r\n\r\n",
