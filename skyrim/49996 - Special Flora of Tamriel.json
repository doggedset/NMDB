  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a variety of new ingredients that are seen in previous Elder Scrolls games and lore. This currently has many new ingredients, most of which can be planted, the ability to plant previously unplantable ingredients from Skyrim and the DLC, and a Merchant to sell ingredients.

They also spawn the insect parts similar to how wild beehives work\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*Nirnroot, Crimson Nirnroot, Jarrin Root, Poison Bloom, Chicken Nest, Pine Thrush Nest, Rock Warbler Nest and Hawk Nest only give ONE ingredient per harvest, meaning you can get one from a plant once every three days. This is intended to help maintain balance and immersion as most of these models only have one visible harvestable ingredient on the model.*\r<br />-BYOH indicates that this item is plantable in Hearthfire gardens\r<br />-Wild indicates that a model has been added for a wild harvestable plant. (ONLY AS LISTED BELOW HAVE ANY BEEN PLACED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Alchemy Effects:[/b]\r<br />Blind - Causes enemy to have difficulty detecting by sight (like the falmer)\r<br />Chameleon - partial to full invisibility with the ability to interact with things\r<br />Fortify Damage - Increases any your damage\r<br />Fortify Speed - Increases the speed you move\r<br />Light - Casts a light over you\r<br />Muffle - Silences your movement\r<br />Night-Eye - Enhances ability to see in low light conditions\r<br />Reflect Damage - Decreases the damage you receive and reflects it to the cause\r<br />Resist Damage - Increases your ability to resist damage\r<br />Resist Disease - Decreases your chance of being infected by disease\r<br />*Waterwalking* -Added by Dragonborn DLC, used as an ingredient effect here\r<br />\r<br />*Chameleon has been fixed. The effect consistently causes the player to be more transparent and harder to detect. This only uses the set alpha script (as a trigger) and does not require any save bloating scripts or perk requirements or other spells to use. Works just like any other alchemy effect that has variable magnitude and duration. There is still a small graphical glitch where small faces of the mesh are shaded different from the rest of the body. Looks like moving boxes. That is an interference from the scripted alpha shader and the invisibility alpha shader, but the invisibility alpha shader doesn&#39;t like to fire consistently without the scripted alpha shader acting as a trigger on/off.  \r<br />\r<br />Not all these effects are used and some are not used more than once, yet. More ingredients are coming and will eventually all have at least two ingredients so that potions could be made with each. These effects could also be used on custom potions if you choose to do so.\r<br />\r<br />[b]New Spells/Spelltomes:[/b]\r<br />Haste - Fortify Speed 150% for 90 seconds - Restoration - Apprentice\r<br />Quicken - Fortify Speed 200% for 90 seconds - Restoration - Adept\r<br />Shroudwalk - Chameleon 15% for 30 seconds - Illusion - Apprentice\r<br />Chameleon - Chameleon 25% for 30 seconds - Illusion - Adept\r<br />Shadow - Chameleon 50% for 30 seconds - Illusion - Expert\r<br />Cloak - Chameleon 85% for 30 seconds - Illusion - Master\r<br />Night-Eye - Night-Eye for 30 seconds - Alteration - Adept\r<br />Waterwalking - Waterwalking for 60 seconds - Alteration - Adept\r<br />\r<br />Spelltomes can be found and purchased randomly at the Traveling Alchemist&#39;s camp.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Wild Placed Plants:[/b]\r<br />Wolfsbane - Near Hvitkald Peak, Solstheim\r<br />Wormwood - Two found in the Jerral Mountains between Bloodlet Throne and Southfringe Sanctum (you need to look hard)\r<br />\r<br />[b]New Recipes:[/b]\r<br />The items are vanilla or DLC but were unable to made by the player.\r<br />Baked Potatoes - Cook Pot\r<br />Grilled Leeks - Cook Pot\r<br />Butter - Cook Pot\r<br />Bonemeal from Skulls or Troll Skulls\r<br />Powdered Mammoth Tusks from Mammoth Tusks\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Future Plans:[/b]\r<br />Next on list: Motherwort, Corn, Pumpkins, Arrowroot, Saltrice, Wickwheat, Ampoule Pod, and Coda Flower. \r<br />More new ingredients to grow and to be purchased from vendors.\r<br />Ability to plant more of the vanilla food plants\r<br />More new food items to plant\r<br />Ability to &#34;plant&#34; other ingredients to cultivate things like bugs and eggs. \r<br />Add more plants to the wild. They will be rare and most likely near borders.\r<br />More NPCs to sell the new ingredients or add them to existing NPCs wares.\r<br />Planters around the world.\r<br />\r<br />If there are any requests for any alchemy ingredients or food items let me know and I will see what I can do.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits:[/b]\r<br />Bethesda for Skyrim&#33;\r<br />Bethesda for lore on other ingredients and effects&#33;\r<br />All the free texture resources including CGTextures.com\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />As a modder&#39;s resource, anyone may use the meshes, textures, and data from the .esp as they wish.
