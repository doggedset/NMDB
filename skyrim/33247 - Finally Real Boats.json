Real working Boats!\r\nYup, you heard me right, real working boats!\r\nDid you ever wanted to sail the rivers of Skyrim or to take a boat to the middle of a lake?\r\nWell, I\\'m sure you did! Want to go down waterfalls? Well, now you can!\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/4608644]KnightRangersGuild[/url] has made a quite impressive mod, which made it possible to do all this, he made a boat that really worked, so all credits for the boat to him, he made it! So, I asked him for permissions to make a mod, a mod that would replace all of Skyrims and Solstheims static boats with real working, float-able boats. He said it was okay! So, I opened the Creation Kit for the first time, lost my way in it, after hours of exploring I decided to give it a try. I [B]manually replaced 62[/B] of the static boats with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/4608644]KnightRangersGuilds[/url] one and it took me many nights, I did it for all immersion seekers of Skyrim, who wanted to play Skyrim like it was supposed to be from the beginning! Now you can take a boat and sail all over Skyrims rivers, lakes, seas, or even if you must rocks! Very useful for mods like [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163]Frostfall[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16139]Fishing In Skyrim[/url]! This is my very first mod. So, please, tell me what you think of it, and if you like it, please, endorse it :)\r\nAlso don\\'t forget to endorse [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29526]\\\"Pilotable Rowboat\\\" by KnightRangersGuild[/url] he will be grateful for that! I will add more boats to Skyrim, so, stay tuned!\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://www2.picturepush.com/photo/a/12422430/img/12422430.png[/img]\r\n[youtube]gSqZpAFZ6OA[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://www4.picturepush.com/photo/a/12422342/img/12422342.png[/img]\r\n[size=4][B][color=#805629]NMM:[/color][/B][/size]\r\n[list=1]\r\n[*]Install [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29526]\\\"Pilotable Rowboat\\\" by KnightRangersGuild[/url] and endorse his mod!\r\n[*]At the \\\"FILES\\\" tab, click the \\\"DOWNLOAD WITH MANAGER\\\" button to download the mod.\r\n[*]Activate the mod.\r\n[/list]\r\n[size=4][B][color=#805629]Manual:[/color][/B][/size]\r\n[list=1]\r\n[*]Install [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29526]\\\"Pilotable Rowboat\\\" by KnightRangersGuild[/url] and endorse his mod!\r\n[*]At the \\\"FILES\\\" tab, click the \\\"download manually\\\" button to download the mod.\r\n[*]Unpack the \\\".rar\\\" file.\r\n[*]Drag the \\\"Data\\\" Folder into your Skyrim main folder.\r\n[*]Activate the Finally!

But don\\'t worry, they won\\'t break your game or anything like that! There are no scripts in it. We are fixing these bugs a fast a possible, so don\\'t make this a reason to not download this mod! I hope you can live with that for now. Version 0.2.0 fixed many bugs but takes new ones with it, I\\'m sorry.\r\n\r\n[*][color=green]FIXED in 0.2.0[/color] - Some boats lying in the water may rotate 90Â° and sink after a few seconds, you can still use them.\r\n[*][color=green]FIXED in 0.2.0[/color] - Sometimes boats are lying on land instead of in the water, when reloading your save, they lie in the water again.\r\n[*][color=green]FIXED in 0.2.0[/color] - When leaving a boat he can rotates\r\n[*][color=green]FIXED in 0.2.0[/color] - When sailing a boat and you touch land or a rock the boat stops working correctly, leave the boat and re-enter to fix this.\r\n[*][color=green]FIXED in 0.2.0[/color] - The boat makes horse sounds.\r\n[*][color=green]FIXED in 0.2.0[/color] - The boat doesn\\'t make sound when sailing yet.\r\n[*][color=orange]IMPROVED in 0.2.0[/color] - There is water in the boat; sometimes parts of the boat are underwater after touching something.\r\n\r\n[*]- Boats follow you on Fast Travel, pretty funny.\r\n[*]- When uninstalling this mod when you are in a boat, your camera will be bugged.\r\n[*]- The lantern on the boat gives no light.\r\n[*]- You are lying in the boat.\r\n[*]- Entering the boat, animation is bugged.[/list]\r\n\r\nI\\'m looking for a programer and a animator.\r\nIt\\'s my first mod, and I\\'m inexperienced.\r\nSo please, if you can help, contact me on the Nexus or my e-mail, sigi.baes@hotmail.be.\r\nThank you very much!\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://www4.picturepush.com/photo/a/12422487/img/12422487.png[/img]\r\nI\\'ve got permissions from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/4608644]KnightRangersGuild[/url] to release this mod.
