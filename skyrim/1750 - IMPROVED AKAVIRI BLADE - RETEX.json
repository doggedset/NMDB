  "summary": "Retextured Akaviri Blade + Sheathe to bring out details that were squashed out + Dragon Engraving.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'ve personally thought that the Akaviri blades were a little too dull, considering the fact that they are based on Japanese Katanas. A blackened katana with dreary decoration isn\\'t a very good one!\r\nP.S. Didn\\'t the old hilt kind of look like a dog turd wrapped around it?\r\n\r\n\r\n- Brightened/ polished the blade\r\n- Engraved a Japanese dragon on the base of the blade\r\n- Changed the underlaying colour on the hilt to Green, rather than the dull Orange/Brown\r\n- Brightened the hilt to more of a golden tone, brought out the Dragon ornamentation\r\n- Updated the Sheathe to match\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re like me and want to kick some dragon ass with a bit more style, this one\\'s for you!\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\nSimply unpack and drop into your Skyrim/Data/Textures folder!\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, just delete the folder\r\n\r\nEndorse \\'em if you like \\'em!",
