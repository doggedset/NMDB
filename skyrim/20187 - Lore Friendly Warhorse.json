  "descriptionHtml": "LORE FRIENDLY WARHORSE\r\nSkyrim Mod\r\n\r\nVer 1.0  (7/9/2012)\r\nby: Darius2301\r\n\r\n[b][u]Description:[/u][/b]\r\nThis mod adds a lore-appropriate warhorse to Skyrim.  The horse can be purchased for 5000 gold at the Whiterun stables.  The horse has the exact same stats as \\\"Shadowmere.\\\"\r\n\r\n[b][u]Design Goals:[/u][/b]\r\nThis mod was designed to be very lightweight and to interfere with other mods as little as possible.  It was also designed to fit into the Skyrim lore.  For this reason, the stats on the warhorse are set to be the same as the existing horse \\\"Shadowmere.\\\"  The warhorse has the same speed as all the other horses in the game, but (like Shadowmere) has increased health and stamina.   The warhorse is also very hard to kill, but can die if enough damage is taken quickly enough.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Manual Installation:[/u][/b]\r\nCopy the files LFWarhorse.esp and LFWarhorse.bsa to your Skyrim \\\"Data\\\" directory.  Normally, this can be found here: Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\n[b][u]Q & A:[/u][/b]\r\nQ: How can I purchase the horse?\r\nA: Go to the Whiterun stables and look for a small for sale notice on the front left side of the horse stable.  It will appear as a parchment note on the left beam.  Walk up to that for sale note and activate it.\r\n\r\nQ: When I activate the for sale note, I don\\'t get the option to purchase the horse?\r\nA: You don\\'t have the necessary 5000 gold in your inventory.\r\n\r\nQ: My horse died, how can I buy a new one?\r\nA: You can\\'t.  This warhorse is one of a kind.\r\n\r\nQ: How can I report a bug?\r\nA: Please enter a comment on Skyrim Nexus.\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE:[/b]The Horse Armor in this mod is taken from the excellent \\\"Horse Armors for Skyrim\\\" mod by Mystikhybrid - Gabriel Gullbergh.
