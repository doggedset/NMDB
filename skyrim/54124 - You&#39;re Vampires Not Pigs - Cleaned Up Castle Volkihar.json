  "summary": "Cleaned up that pigsty of a castle. And they called themselves Vampire Lords.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Update: Okay so apparently you can pick up the replaced mead barrels; if you drop them from your inventory after picking them up, they become suspended in the air. I&#39;m trying to figure out how to fix this, but so far, no luck. I&#39;ll keep trying though.\r<br />\r<br />NEW: Added clean boss room&#33; Removed rubble, but kept skeletons because of the boss fight mechanics. Removed bloody mead barrels from main hall&#33; Added more Blood Potions&#33; Removed unnecessary corpses&#33; Install Guild Hall or Boss Room separately, or download both files together&#33; You choose&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Hi there&#33; This is my first ever mod, so bear with me&#33; This mod aims to clean up all the unnecessary blood, bones and rubble from Castle Volkihar. You&#39;d think the lords and ladies of the Undead would clean up the place. I mean, yeah, you&#39;re vampires, but still&#33; Blood everywhere? Keep that to the feeding areas, &#39;kay?\r<br />\r<br />Cleaned Areas:\r<br />Dining Hall\r<br />Lab Area\r<br />Bedrooms\r<br />Lab\r<br />\r<br />The only areas that aren&#39;t cleaned up are the prison/food pens (because it makes sense they&#39;d be that dirty, ya know) and the gateway to the Courtyard. I made this with SKSE installed, so I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s required or not, but most likely not. You do need Dawnguard, obviously.\r<br />\r<br />Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy, or at least find this useful&#33; Thanks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Sorry for the crappy image quality. I&#39;m still trying to work out screenshot cameras and angles.",
