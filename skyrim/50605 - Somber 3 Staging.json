  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/L0OPwu8.png[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />Somber 3 represents a stage of development succeeding Somber Antique 2.x prior to Tansarville&#39;s retirement from Skyrim ENB modding and as such, can be considered the third generation of Somber ENB.  The objectives of this version were to provide support for multiple weathers and the enbhelper.dll as well as to leverage the improvements of a new enbeffect file and a new set of shader files.  It has been my goal to meet these requirements and make this preset presentable while respecting the core Somber aesthetic.  However, please keep in mind that Somber 3 is [i]not Somber Antique[/i].\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/s9GquJk.png[/IMG]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Remove all files and folders associated with previously installed ENB presets [b][color=gold]except the [i]enblocal.ini[/i] file.[/b][/color]  This file is specific to your system and must be retained.

Any mods that alter lighting will change the way this preset looks.  Some of these changes will be subtle and may be to your liking while others will result in lighting levels that are not intentional.  As this preset was not tuned for any specific lighting mod, no lighting mods will be supported.  \r<br />\r<br />[list][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9930//?]Revamped Exterior Fog[/url] [color=gray]This mod is necessary due to how Somber ENB was tuned.[/color][/list]\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/2bbrIWw.png[/IMG]\r<br />Somber ENB was tuned with these mods and each has its reasons for being used with this ENB preset.\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18814/?]Project Parallax[/url]\r<br />[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37865/?]AmidianBorn Landscape[/url] [color=gray]Use with project Parallax.

My first priority with weather support has been to correct anomalous lighting conditions and not to create wildly unusual weathers.  This process is not yet complete.\r<br />\r<br />If you encounter any problems with weathers, please report them by providing the following information and I&#39;ll do my best to address the issue:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]post a screenshot in the comments thread, resized to 800 pixels or less in width (maintaining aspect ratio) - images larger than this will be deleted\r<br />[*]location of screenshot (e.g. Whiterun hold)\r<br />[*]in-game time (or expand and show the &#34;statistics&#34; section of the ENB GUI when you take a screenshot)\r<br />[*]weather ID - found by opening up the ENB GUI and selecting &#34;weather panel&#34; (you can provide either the weather file name or the ID code (e.g. &#34;SkyCldTU&#34; or &#34;10A243&#34;)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />All of this information can be provided in a simple screenshot as shown below (make sure the GUI text is readable - my screen resolution is 2560x1600 - the ENB GUI text will be larger at lower resolutions):\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/1XCLAf3.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />If you don&#39;t provide this information there will be little I can do to investigate the issue.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/xeQaoPn.png[/IMG]\r<br />[center][youtube]2VnIdukbCo4[/youtube][/center]\r<br />[center][color=#778899]Video of Somber 3 ENB by hodilton - many thanks to him[/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/JhrnyCG.png[/IMG]\r<br />Somber ENB was created by Tansarville and without her dedication and artistic vision, this preset would not have been possible.  UnrealWarfare deserves special mention as Somber ENB was originally based on Unreal Cinema ENB and UnrealWarfare&#39;s contribution to Somber ENB must always be recognized.  I would like to extend a personal thank you to Kyokushinoyama for allowing the use of his Evolution shaders, without which Somber 3 would not be possible.[color=#778899]\r<br />\r<br />Boris Vorontsov - ENB Series developer\r<br />Tansarville - Creator of the Somber Series\r<br />UnrealWarfare - inspiration, help and support\r<br />HeliosDoubleSix - HD6 Shader code\r<br />Matso - Sun textures, original Depth of Field code\r<br />IndigoNeko - Active Film Grain\r<br />Confidence Man - Water Texture\r<br />Trillville - Palette file used on Somber series tweaked from his palette\r<br />Jawz - original enbeffect.fx file, GUI coding, Sunprite texture\r<br />gp65cj04 - Tilt Shift DOF\r<br />Kyokushinoyama - Sunsprite file,Tilt Shift DOF, Cinematic DOF, Bloom code and Evolution shaders\r<br />Mindflux - Particle Patch & Further Dark Dungeons, SnowFX\r<br />Opethfeldt - Sunsprite texture\r<br />Tapioks - Shader Package Port\r<br />Ceejay.dk - SweetFX shader (in older versions of the Somber presets)\r<br />Midhras - Optional DOF file\r<br />Ewi65 - DoF files\r<br />WolfGrimDark - support, testing\r<br />MannyGT\r<br />amoebae for lens textures (and [url=http://xnienke.deviantart.com/]xnienke[/url] for the actual texture used)[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/gs7NBLc.png[/IMG]\r<br />This ENB preset is for personal use only.
