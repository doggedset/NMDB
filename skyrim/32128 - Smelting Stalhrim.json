  "summary": "Want more Stalhrim? Have a Stalhrim greatsword? This mod enables you to melt it down for the component ore at any smelter. Also includes a craftable Heavy Stalhrim Shield!",
  "descriptionHtml": "Smelting:\r\n\r\nTaking a page from one of my favorite mods, SPERG, I added the ability to melt down Stalhrim. Found a greatsword but you use Warhammers? Due to limitations in Skyrim\\'s engine you are unable to get the other components, but none of them are as rare as Stalhrim anyway!\r\n\r\nThe conversion rate is as follows:\r\n\r\nArrow\t\t30 per 1 Ore\r\nBattleaxe\t        3 Ores\r\nBoots\t\t        2 Ores\r\nBow\t\t        1 Ore\r\nCuirass\t\t1 Ore\r\nDagger\t\t1 Ore\r\nGauntlets\t        1 Ore\r\nGreatsword\t3 Ores\r\nHelm\t\t        2 Ores\r\nMace\t\t        2 Ores\r\nShield\t\t3 Ores\r\nSword\t\t1 Ore\r\nWarAxe\t\t1 Ore\r\nWarhammer\t3 Ores\r\n\r\nCrafting:\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Stalhrim did not come with a heavy shield. Since most of my shield users tend to be Heavy Armor users besides, I\\'ve taken the time to add in a heavy variety of said shield. As I lack any talent at 3D modeling, or rendering, or meshes, etc, this is merely the same item with all of its flags switched to \\'heavy\\'.\r\n\r\nYou might be thinking that this is unfair for stats (lighter, weaker, due to the way heavy shields are heavier and stronger than their lighter kin) but instead the proportional stats of the light shield is merely . . . better than other light shields! So rather than nerf the existing shield, I merely left the new one alone instead of buffing it. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nMerely place the StalhrimSmelting.esp in your Data folder (in 86x Windows this is typically C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data and in 64 bit Windows this is typically C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data ) and activate as any other mod. If you don\\'t use mod manager you know how to do this already, if not, merely make sure it\\'s checked in your load order. Otherwise merely use the mod manager as usual.\r\n\r\nUninstall Instructions:\r\n\r\nRemoving is the same, merely delete the StalhrimSmelting.esp from your Data folder. You will receive a warning on boot that you may experience lost items etc, but there is no dataloss or damage to your save. You should always save before changing your mod loadout, but this mod does not change anything that will cause your game to become unstable.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n\r\nNone . . . besides Dragonborn! You can use it with other mods that affect smelting and crafting. It should have no conflicts. If it does, please contact me so I can update this information.\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n\r\nCompatibility added for \r\nStalhrim Enchanted ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31805/ )\r\nShould cause no issues. If you have any negative reactions as a result of this update, please contact me.\r\n\r\nOther:\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod. That said, I am open to criticism to make sure future contributions only improve upon my first work, so don\\'t hesitate to let me know if there\\'s something I could do better!",
