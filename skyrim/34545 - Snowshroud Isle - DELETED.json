  "descriptionHtml": ": Description :\r\nThis mod adds a Necromancy college to the seas bordering Skyrim. The college is home to some very powerful and knowledgeable Necromancers. I created this mod with high hopes of it being a fully complete, quest included, special home and college, but sadly, I had too high hopes. I felt overwhelmed and gave up on it. I have the entire exterior and interior complete, there are no quests, there are special armors and weapons. I will add all of the NPC\\'s I created, but they do nothing special. Requires DAWNGUARD. DRAGONBORN, and the newest UPDATE.\r\n\r\n: Author Notes :\r\n:- I am planning on updating this eventually, updating it with new spells, maybe a better boat system.\r\n\r\n: Features :\r\n:- New Faction Specific Weapons, Armor, and Clothing.\r\n:- Full College\r\n\r\n: Update Log :\r\n:- Main File: Version 1.0\r\n::- Contains Main Components, should include BSA File\r\n:- Version 1.1 (v1.1)\r\n::- Adds some new spells\r\n::- Generic Improvements\r\n\r\n: Layout :\r\n:- Entryway\r\n:- Snowshroud Citadel (Main Room)\r\n:- Castle Labratory (Labratiry)\r\n:- Training Foyer (Training Room)\r\n:- Bunkhall (Living Quarters)\r\n:- Archmage\\'s Chamber (Leader\\'s Bedroom)\r\n:- Athenaeum (Library)\r\n:- Castle Kitchen\r\n:- Castle Forge\r\n\r\n: Known Bugs :\r\n:- None Yet",
