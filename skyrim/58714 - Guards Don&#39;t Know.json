  "descriptionHtml": "Have you noticed how the guards seem to know you&#39;re a member of the Dark Brotherhood, a group that&#39;s supposed to be very secret about its members? Or how they seem to somehow magically know that you murdered some bandit leader for a contract? I have and I found it annoying and immersion-breaking, and this mod fixes that. It simply makes it so those lines of dialogue are never triggered, assuming this mod works.\r<br />\r<br />[b]How to install/uninstall?\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Simply drop the esp in your data folder or use a mod manager. Uninstall by removing the file (or using a mod manager).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Load order\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Place this mod after any mods that modify guard dialogue or it will not work, but before Alternate Start - Live Another Life (if you use that).",
