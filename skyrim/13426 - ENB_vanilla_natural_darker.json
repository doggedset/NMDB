  "descriptionHtml": "first off creds go out to boris @ enbdev.com for this awesome thingy\r\n\r\nthe goal was to get as close to vanilla as possible with all lightning/sky features intact, but slightly darker nights and more vivid days, think the result came out pretty nice\r\n\r\ntheres a few things you need to do before running this\r\n\r\n1. adjust your lcd monitor according to all rules at www.lagom.nl\r\n\r\n2. if you have a nvidia card force AO from the control panel\r\n\r\n3. run the mod Revamped exterior fog (i use a few more tho, like realistic water etc, if you run crimson tide use the dark blood)\r\n\r\n4. use the games DoF\r\n\r\n5. unpack files to your skyrim folder and start it up ;)\r\n\r\n6. feel free to add saturation via nvidias digital vibrance, makes it pretty nice, keep in mind tho what you learned at lagom.nl\r\n\r\n7. i also run 16x af forced from the CP (results might vary between nvidia/ati) and 2x AA from the game, not forced. also turn off aa tranparancy settings in the cp and af optimizations\r\n\r\nthis is my private preset that a buddy of mine wanted me to share since it fixes a few enb bugs, thats why its being upped, really dont have time for any huge projects\r\n\r\nscreenshots features a custom sunglare made by MGE wich can be found in skyrim enhanced shader mod if ud like it",
