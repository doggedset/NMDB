Not Yet.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#cc0000]ABOUT LOAD ORDER[/color]\r<br />\r<br />The main file, New Vigil, adds outposts and npcs scattered through Skyrim. If you got mods like Immersive Settlement or any other that adds buildings to towns and villages you&#39;d better keep my mod at the bottom of your load order. I&#39;m moving some of the outposts to more distant places in order to avoid &#34;collisions&#34; and other strange things. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />===============================================================\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE: 12/07/2014\r<br />16:02  / 4:02 p.m \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />DIALOGUE LINES:\r<br />\r<br />- Kemeth\r<br />- Boreas\r<br />- Malink (New NPC)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />JOURNAL:\r<br />\r<br />- Drusilla has two more diaries.

Concept\r<br />II. Locations\r<br />III. Followers and NPCs\r<br />IV. Special Items\r<br />V. Installation, Bugs and known issues:\r<br />VI. Next steps\r<br />________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Requirements\r<br />\r<br />- The Latest Version of Skyrim\r<br />- Dawnguard DLC\r<br />- Apachii Hair: 1.5 Full\r<br />- Apachii Hair: 1.4 Female\r<br />- Apachii Hair: 1.2 Male\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I. Concept\r<br />\r<br />I had been watching the Vigilants of Stendarr among other religious orders for some time.They claim to hunt down Daedra worshippers and supernatural beings like Vampires and Werewolves but I felt that something was missing. So, I got this idea, to make an “expansion” of the Vigil. You see, I do not intend to change completely the original Vigilants found in Skyrim but to show another perspective. New characters with a story behind them. \r<br />\r<br />II. Locations\r<br />\r<br />A) Whiterun&#39;s Vigil: close to the bridge. It&#39;s easy to see it if you are travelling from Riverwood to Whiterun. Take a look at the map, too. \r<br />\r<br />B) Brelyn’s House:  just before one of the entrances, by the road. About Brelyn and his children:\r<br />\r<br />- Allyah is a blacksmith and she can be found working outside the house during the day;\r<br />- Skaadi can be found working at the Dead Man’s Drink;\r<br />- Marcus can be found walking by the streets of Falkreath (patrol);\r<br />- Brelyn can be found farming in Falkreath and hunting nearby;\r<br />- All of them can be found relaxing at Dead Man’s Drink around 6 pm and they will back back home around 11 pm.\r<br />\r<br />C) Morthal&#39;s Vigil: close to Movarth&#39;s Lair. The site is scary but unless you are using mods that change (completely) the scenario, we cannot say that Morthal is the most colorful, safest hold in Skyrim, can we? And if you have &#34;Skyrim Witcher Experience&#34;, beware for drowners, as they might spawn nearby and threaten anyone around&#33;\r<br />\r<br />D) Fendaris&#39;s House: It is the old Dawnstar&#39;s Vigil. \r<br />\r<br />E) Markarth&#39;s Vigil: only the tower remains. The loft became a Safehouse in the Rift. \r<br />\r<br />(The fast travel to the tower is currently disabled)\r<br />\r<br />F) Winterhold&#39;s Vigil\r<br />\r<br />G) Ramzem and Tilda’s Inn: close to Riften&#39;s main gate (North Gate).\r<br />\r<br />H) Windhelm&#39;s Vigil: close to Windhelm&#39;s bridge.\r<br />\r<br />I) The Mighty Aegir: It is a ship docked in the port of Solitude.\r<br />\r<br />J) Kynesgrove Retreat: in Kynesgrove, close to the dragon burial mound.\r<br />\r<br />K) Heroes for Hire: Darkwater Crossing\r<br />- Claudia Stromm\r<br />- Maiger\r<br />- Dhaulae\r<br />- Faelhelen\r<br />\r<br />III. Followers and NPCs\r<br />\r<br />- Some of these New Vigilants are not like the &#34;fundamentalist robots&#34; wandering off Skyrim. They can even follow you with their own, peculiar equipments;\r<br />\r<br />- There are vigilants with different perks and combat styles: one-handed, two-handed, dual-wielding, bow and arrow, knives and daggers...\r<br />\r<br />- Amidst standard mages, spellswords and battlemages, there are &#34;Exorcists&#34;, in other words, mages with advanced perks in Restoration School that can be a real challenge for the undead and other similar creatures. \r<br />\r<br />- The multi-ethnicity is more evident: there are vigilants from all [vanilla] races.\r<br />\r<br />- There is someone with murderous intent hunting down the Vigilants of Stendarr AND  you. Be careful&#33; They can tear you apart within a blink of an eye.\r<br />\r<br />IV. Special items\r<br />\r<br />If you explore the New Vigil and some of the outposts you will find enchanted items and diaries. Take a look and see if they are useful to you. If you are willing to get in the Danger Room, make sure you are prepared&#33; There is a good reason for the word &#34;danger&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />(Before hitting anything that moves inside Danger Room, check if it’s not an ally, ok? You may not have the chance to apologize…)\r<br />\r<br />V. Installation, Bugs and Known Issues\r<br />\r<br />1. SAVE YOUR GAME BEFORE INSTALLING&#33; Always save your game BEFORE installing any mod.\r<br />2. Use Nexus Mod Manager or just drop the .esp file inside &#34;Data&#34;, in your Skyrim folder.\r<br />3. To uninstall this mod, delete the .esp file manually or use the Nexus Mod Manager. Load your game, save it and quit. The file should be &#34;clean&#34; again.",
