  "modName": "Dwemer Cliff Houses",
  "summary": "This mod adds SEVERAL Dwemer style houses to Skyrim.  They range from a fair sized complex to boxcar camps.  The smaller dwellings don&#39;t have load spaces.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The main house features merchants, a follower, outdoor near fast travel point storage and crafting stations, a hot tub, shower, mess hall, stable, farm, Dwemer spider gardener, fishing spot, library, armory, exhibit hall, workshop, and more.  Centrally located just north of the Falkreth lake with beautiful views.  \r<br />\r<br />Several smaller houses are located throughout Skyrim, including Boxcar houses outside Winterhold and Windhelm.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Sorry for not keeping this version updated or monitored adequately.  There are a ton of changes in version seven, and now it should be clearly labeled as the main file.  Most of the changes are to the main house.   \r<br />_____________________________________________\r<br />The sixth file includes many improvements including a (mostly) working navmesh, a merchant and hunter, many storage and cosmetic additions and improvements, and the starts of an outdoor shrine.  Once I can get the model to not havok settle (yes I&#39;ve tried both the check box and script).\r<br />__________________________________________\r<br />The fifth file contains a lot of fixes and updates to the outside and inside of the main house, including working bookshelves.  The lift makes more sense now as well.  I&#39;m working on a village and a quest, so hopefully I&#39;ll have that done in a couple weeks.  Any suggestions are welcome, but keep in mind that I&#39;m not a scripter so new shouts are working trains are, unlikely, to say the least.\r<br />__________________________________________\r<br />The fourth file is the updated version I&#39;ve been putting on Steam Workshop.  Yes, it is THE least popular house mod on the entire workshop.  \r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s expanded on the house looking over the Riverwood lake, now with a sprawling basement.  It doesn&#39;t still feel like the original (which I still can&#39;t get to open in any version on the Creation Kit), but it&#39;s closer.  The basement also has a lot of interesting creations in a large viewing hall.  \r<br />\r<br />More importantly this mod now is several houses.  One overlooks Morthal, one is on the right side wall of the valley as you travel from Whiterun to Windhelm, before the bandit bridge.  One is east of the Throat of the world by that upper lake.  And one is east of Windhelm not far from the shrine.  That last one is basically a box car.  At any rate, they each have a slightly different character and many different sizes, the original being the largest.  \r<br />\r<br />Hopefully this does better here than on the workshop.  I know it isn&#39;t THAT bad.\r<br />_______________________________________________\r<br />File 3 is a different esp (with &#39;Dwemer&#39; spelled correctly) that is not an update of the previous version, but a re-do.  The house location is moved to overlook the large southern lake.  My previous versions will no longer open in the Creation Kit and also I&#39;m told aren&#39;t stable in-game in all cases, in some instances causing crash to desktop when around Riverwood.  I tried to recreate it on Spine of the World, but I&#39;m beginning the suspect that was some of the problem in the first place.  The new location&#39;s view isn&#39;t as nice sadly.  \r<br />\r<br />I might add in a quest with the Dwemer spider gardener.  Oh, and if you don&#39;t like bees, don&#39;t walk through the flower field.\r<br />_____________________________________\r<br />File 2 is the one with working lifts and some other fairly minor changes.\r<br />\r<br />It was part of an over ambitious mod idea that will probably never get done, but it stands well enough on it&#39;s own.\r<br />\r<br />The issues I know it has.\r<br />\r<br />-snow covers some things for some reason\r<br />-water not working, but you should be able to climb out of the pond anyway\r<br />\r<br />Feedback welcomed.  Please don&#39;t upload this to the Steam Workshop.  I&#39;ll do that when I iron out some issues.\r<br />\r<br />The &#39;Dwemer Cliff House 2&#39; file has working lifts now.  Thanks to Macgyver1958 for showing me where the door versions of the levers are.",
