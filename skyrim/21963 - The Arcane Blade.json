  "descriptionHtml": "This dagger may very well be one of the weakest and most powerful weapons in the game.\r\nHow can this be? That makes no sense!\r\n\r\nWell, without being fully charged, the weapon does a mere 1 point of damage (pathetic isn\\'t it?).\r\nHowever, when fully charged with soul gems, the blade is capable of killing pretty much anything in one hit (dealing approximately 10000 points of damage). \r\n\r\nHowever, this weapon is not to be used too casually as it costs just short of 4 grand soul gems to fill and then grants one successful hit before needing to be recharged.\r\n\r\nThis mod is mainly for those who want an instant kill weapon without being too overpowered.\r\nAt least you\\'ve got to earn your kill with this one.\r\n\r\nIt can be found on the little table (by the dead guy) as you enter Helgen keep.\r\n\r\nIf you plan on using this, I\\'d suggest owning either Azura\\'s star of the black star to make soul farming more feasible (and less costly).\r\n\r\nAlso, it\\'s un-disenchantable to give it a sense of uniqueness.",
