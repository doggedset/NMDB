  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes totally new combat experience. It has focused on precise and responsive combat.\r<br />It is not only numerical game settings, enemy action adds special attacks, special spell, dodge, counter, block and bash.\r<br />These are depending on behavior of the player and situation.\r<br />Moreover, add some new attack animations for special attacks.\r<br />Your tactics and operation, more affecting results of combat.\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------------------\r<br />[size=4]Features[/size]\r<br />----------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />-Smart AI with script\r<br />NPC AI is smarter and more natural than previous ones. It is not only adjusting the numerical, NPC react to player or myself.\r<br />NPC watches your attack, and then attempt to dodge or block. \r<br />Additionally, NPC watches your mistake or passive action, and then aggressive special attack.\r<br />These actions only if you are within eyesight of NPC. You would need to attack from out of NPC&#39;s sight.\r<br />\r<br />Human NPC is classified broadly into five groups(e.g. archer, mage, melee..).\r<br />NPC&#39;s behavior frequency is different by groups.\r<br />\r<br />Applied race:human, draugr, dragon priest, skeleton, ash spawn, dwarven centurion, falmer, giant, frost giant.\r<br />\r<br />-Special Attacks\r<br />NPC will have special attacks different from normal attack and power attack.\r<br />Special attack more deal damage; and deal stagger even if blocking. \r<br />NPC cannot special attack when not have stamina.\r<br />Human npc animations are created by kill move ones, Other NPC add new some attack animations. \r<br />\r<br />-Timed Block\r<br />If the player have been blocking attack for a short time(adjustable in MCM), the block will no damage and cost no stamina, and then attacker is staggering.\r<br />This stagger is no effective in described above &#34;stagger resistance&#34;, so you would be actively utilized.\r<br />However, these effects will be applied only melee attacks from the front. In addition, Player cannot use it when player have low stamina.\r<br />\r<br />When succeeded in timed blocking, screen will stop temporarily(like a hit stop) and blur strongly than usual. You can change the settings in the MCM.\r<br />\r<br />-Infighting Shield\r<br />Expand magical shield when you charge a magic(just pressing a button) with the timing of enemy melee attacking at the front.\r<br />You parry the enemy attack, you are not damaged, and then attacker staggers.\r<br />It consumes 10 magicka on success. Possible range of parrying is limited than timed block.\r<br />Enchant effect is not blocked.\r<br />\r<br />-Speed Bonus\r<br />Your movement speed and direction affect melee attack damage both dealing and incoming.\r<br />\r<br />If you go forward enemy, increase deal and income damage.\r<br />If you go backward enemy, decrease deal and income damage.\r<br />The maximum damage is two times than the vanilla. It does not greatly modify the game balance.\r<br />\r<br />-Stagger Resistance (Diminishing returns)\r<br />Whenever stagger attack(it mean bash and power attack) hit enemy, NPC have stagger time decreases gradually.\r<br />So, your first stagger gets full duration, the second stagger is cut by 0.5 second, the third stun is cut by 1.0 second, and for the fourth stun and beyond you get &#34;Immune.&#34; \r<br />It will reset the resist after 30 seconds from first stagger.\r<br />It keeps the usefulness of stagger attack, but you would not be churning out blindly.\r<br />It is a counter-measure of player&#39;s stagger attack is too strong.\r<br />This function enable to turn off/on in MCM.\r<br />\r<br />- NPC power attacks staggering.\r<br />Player is overwhelming advantage. Because player not limited in behavior, when player get stagger by power attack.\r<br />So player gets the stagger of limited action same as NPC.\r<br />If player cannot control time too long, it would not be fun time. Player&#39;s stagger time is shorter than NPC.\r<br />That time is different depending on the NPC/weapons type.\r<br />\r<br />- Stamina Cost\r<br />The player&#39;s weapon swing cost a stamina. This cost add to power attack stamina cost.\r<br />Instead, regeneration rate of stamina in combat is higher than vanilla. These can be adjusted in MCM, because it take account of balance with some other mod.\r<br />\r<br />When player&#39;s stamina is low, blocking efficient degrades and timed block is disable.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- Headshot\r<br />If player succeed in shooting to the head by bow/crossbow, deals extra damage, and then victim gets stagger occasionally.\r<br />This extra damage depends on the player&#39;s skill in archery and weapon critical damage.\r<br />It almost does not detect erroneous head position.\r<br />\r<br />- Cooperation\r<br />If dying ally, other NPC try to help that NPC. It is natural.\r<br />When human NPC bleed out, mage try to recover NPC health, warrior try to defend NPC.\r<br />\r<br />- Performance and stability script.\r<br />It is dynamically attached script only combat at the start. So, it is more stable than the other.\r<br />There is no need to wait for the re-spawn.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- Slower movement when attacking with one-hand melee.\r<br />- Blocking is a little more effective. \r<br />- Blocking attacks costs stamina.\r<br />- Player&#39;s two-handed attack the enemy when blocking deal more damage and more stamina damage.\r<br />- Bash reach is reduced.\r<br />- Human enemies restore health when health is low. \r<br />- NPC dodge a ranged-attack is reduced speed.\r<br />\r<br />= Common Boss Actor\r<br />They are stronger than other NPC.\r<br />\r<br />- Dragon Priest\r<br />Adds dodge spell, shock wave spell that has staggered, automatic tracking spell, delayed bomb spell, water splash at the feet spell.\r<br />His health has twice by default. It&#39;s adjustable in MCM.\r<br />He has a little damage resistance.\r<br />Marked for death becomes hard to effectiveness.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- Dwarven Centurion\r<br />Adds new whirl slash and two-handed chop animations. \r<br />Player cannot be blocking whirl slash.\r<br />It sometimes will bash when attack from front.\r<br />\r<br />Centurion has locational damage system.\r<br />When you melee-attack from back a few times, centurion will not be able to act while error checking.\r<br />When you ranged-attack(bow or projectile spell) on hit around chest, you deal additional damage.\r<br />Note: Face is invalid damage.\r<br />It has damage resistance.\r<br />Marked for death becomes hard to effectiveness.\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------------------\r<br />[size=4]Mod Configuration Menu (MCM)[/size]\r<br />----------------------------------------------------\r<br />+Timed Block\r<br />[b]Effective Time[/b]   - Set TimedBlock effective time after starting block stance.\r<br />[b]Pause Time[/b] - Set pause time when succeeded in timed blocking.\r<br />[b]Blur Strength[/b]   - Set blur strength when succeeded in timed blocking.\r<br />\r<br />+Game Balance Settings\r<br />[b]Hardcore Damage[/b]   - Both player and NPC increased damage.
