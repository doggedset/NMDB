This preset includes a darker and more mature color tone, some desaturation with fog removal and crisp enhanced shadows through the use of ENB and also SweetFX. \r\n\r\nThe video demonstration linked below should explain better on the ENBs concept. If you have tried the config and like how it plays then feel free to endorse or better yet post some images. In fact any feedback positive or negative would be grand, cheers!.\r\n\r\n[center][img] http://i47.tinypic.com/t5t3li.png  [/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center] Note: I used Realistic Lighting overhaul for interiors in the video demonstration.

[/center]\r\n\r\nNote: At present I won\\'t be updating the config for later versions of ENB. This preset will not work well or look correct with any later version of ENB other than 0.132 so don\\'t waste your time and try to experiment because I\\'ve tested already. I will update the config but just not at the moment. I\\'m going to see how Skyrim ENB evolves (Boris Vorontsov has noted that he will be adding additional Water Effects, which looks promising). \r\n\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n [center] [heading][color=green]Setting up SkyrimPrefs.INI[/color] [/heading] [/center]\r\n\r\nThis is important for new users of ENB.\r\n\r\nGoto your SkyrimPrefs.ini file (typically found in C:/users/(computers name)/mydocuments/mygames/Skyrim/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind and alter the following lines to read.\r\n\r\nbFloatPointRenderTarget=1 \r\nbTreesReceiveShadows=1\r\nbDrawLandShadows=1\r\nbShadowsOnGrass=1\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[center][heading] [color=red] Lighting Mods Compatability [/color] [/heading][/center]\r\n\r\n[center] This mod works well vanilla lighting. But it also works well with either Realistic Lighting Overhaul for interiors and spells or Enhanced Lights and FX. I have tested and balanced and the ENB works with either one of them.[/center]\r\n\r\n[heading][center] Exterior Lighting [/heading][/center]\r\n\r\n[b] Do not use any Weather systems with this ENB because they\\'re not compatabile with this ENB (this includes Realistic Lighting overhaul \\\"exterior\\\" weather effects and Climates of Tamriel. They\\'re not compatible).\r\n\r\nWar Steel ENB has been balanced around vanilla Skyrim\\'s weathers to incorporate very strong true black shadows and Sky Lighting effects. When additional weather mods alter the original look of the game to create darker exteriors or to add hundreds of additional weather systems then it\\'s out of my control in how the enb will look but I can probably predict glitches and strange shadows coupled with darkened exteriors. I will not balance around these mods because it will go away from the mods original concept. [/b]\r\n\r\n[b][color=red] Be sure to adjust in-game brightness when first using the mod to match your monitors screen brightness/contrast.

It’s recommend to disable Anti Aliasing (AA) from Skyrim’s graphical options and also any GPU settings should be changed to \\\"application controlled\\\".  This will provide the best performance with no graphical loss. FXAA can be used if desired.
