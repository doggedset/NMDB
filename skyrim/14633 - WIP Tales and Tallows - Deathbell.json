Introduction\r<br />2. Install/Uninstall\r<br />3. Compatibility\r<br />4. Permissions\r<br />5. Credits\r<br />6. Contact\r<br />\r<br />=========================================================================\r<br />1. INTRODUCTION\r<br />=========================================================================\r<br />This mod contains mature content.\r<br />\r<br />Tales & Tallows: Deathbell is a project that will allow the player to help build Deathbell, a secret association of practitioners of the dark arts. Deathbell’s symbol is the flower of the same name, a plant that presumably grows where unfortunate deaths have taken place. The mod provides dark-themed characters for the player’s character to interact with.\r<br />\r<br />This is a dialogue-heavy mod. Because we don’t have voice acting, you need to have all subtitles turned on to read NPC dialogue. Each line lasts about 30 seconds, but you can click through or hit E or Enter to make the dialogue go faster.\r<br />\r<br />This testing version at Skyrim Nexus contains work in progress. It is intended for community feedback on the mod’s current state. Be aware that playing this mod in this state subjects you to spoilers, bugs, and glitches. Feel free to dig around the mod in the Creation Kit. Keep in mind that the content not used in the first chapter of the mod is not finished. You can help the mod by reporting your concerns.\r<br />\r<br />By installing this WIP mod at Skyrim Nexus, you understand that anything you uncover in the mod is at your own risk and that anything is subject to change in the final release. It is recommended for now that you install the mod only to experiment with the content, not to assume permanent modifications to your character and game, such as storing any of your possessions in the mod’s gamespace. Remember to back up your saves&#33;\r<br />\r<br />To begin the mod, visit the Lonely Pier along the shore north of Winterhold, and take the skiff there to the Ruins of Arkay. Speak to Adrithel at the Knights of the Circle Camp.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=========================================================================\r<br />2.
