  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff0000]Beware[/color]: This mod adds Cannabis related content.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod is based on Cannabis Skyrim by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2345988]MadNuttah[/url] and Virakotxa.\n<br />I found the Shop infront of Whiterun unimmersive so i changed it. \n<br />And tried to find an immersive way to implement the weed into the game. \n<br />\n<br />Its called Eashab based on An Arabic Word used for Herb. \n<br />It comes in \n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#93c47d]Common [/color][color=#d8d8d8](Alteration),[/color]\n<br />[*][color=#76a5af]Pale [/color][color=#b6b6b6](Illusion)[/color][color=#76a5af] [/color]\n<br />[*][color=#00ff00]Bright [/color][color=#d8d8d8](Restoration)[/color]\n<br />[*][color=#a64d79]Purple[/color][color=#00ff00] [/color][color=#d8d8d8](Conjuration)[/color]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />I moved Eashab business to the underground and[color=#ff7700] \n<br />had to remove the[/color] \"[color=#00ff00]YOUR HIGHNESS[/color]\" cannabis shop. ;/\n<br />\n<br />Replaced with a \n<br />[color=#ff7700]Burnt Farm [/color]that can act as a beginners Playerhome, aswell as \n<br />\n<br />[color=#cc4125][b]START[/b] [/color]the [color=#00ff00]Quest[/color] by giving the first hint. \n<br />The Quest includes meeting Eashab Dealers.\n<br />Those complete the very limited selection The Khaijit Caravans have to offer. Aswell as allow you to grow Eashab.\n<br />One Merchant will most likely be met thru a playthrough, The Second one has to be Unlocked!\n<br />\n<br />The Quest is lowkey, It uses letters and wont show as an actual quest!!\n<br />You pretty much find the next hint (Letter/Note) always in the area you were sent to from the Burnt Farm on.\n<br />\n<br />3 Spells can be learned:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]\"[color=#ffd966]Fiery Aura[/color]\"   ﻿   ﻿Fire Cloak that lasts a long time but drains your magicka slowly.\n<br />[*]\"[color=#00ffff]Frosty Aura[/color]\"    ﻿    Frost Cloak that lasts a long time but drains your magicka slowly.\n<br />[*]\"[color=#00ff00]Reeking Robe[/color]\"   ﻿A Cloakspell so smelly it staggers your opponents, but comes with a backlash.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The Reeking Robe aswell as the Filled Dragon Pipe are considered the most powerfull additions to the Game.\n<br />Besides Sana Ora.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />You may find a hint during the Quest when obtaining [color=#00ff00]Philis[/color][color=#efefef] Thar[/color]´s Letter.\n<br />And meet [color=#ffd966]Sana Ora[/color][color=#ff7700] [/color][color=#efefef]a potential Follower fighting an enchanted immortal Creature.\n<br />You pretty much find the next hint (Letter/Note) always in the area you were sent to from the Burnt Farm on.\n<br />[/color][color=#ffff00]\n<br />Sana Ora[/color] is a strong female Fire Mage and College of Windhelm drop-out. \n<br />She is surrounded in a fiery Aura; and easily steals your show by looks and dealt damage. ;)\n<br />[color=#e69138]She uses only vanilla assets but is unique in its way.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />You will discover her home, \n<br />[color=#ffff00]The Witchhouse[/color], that can act as your Playerhome. (Navmeshed and All)\n<br />It has a discoverable Fast Travel Point on its small balcony, overlooking [color=#6aa84f]Falkreath[/color].\n<br />The Witchhouse is not your typical playerhome. It has 2 seperate Wardrobes for example :)\n<br />[color=#e69138]It uses almost only vanilla assets but is unique in its way.[/color]\n<br />[color=#d8d8d8]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/color]Almost all Craftable [color=#00ff00]\"Potions\"[/color]fortify 2 Handed Weapons and a Magic School, some slighly buff Alchemy, some give you the berserkers rage. \n<br />Others will knock you down and leave you paralized. (for 5 minutes) :) \n<br />\n<br />\"[color=#00ff00]Potions[/color]\" contain,\n<br />Common, Pale, Bright and Purple version of:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The Eashab Seed (edible food)\n<br />[*]The Eashab (edible weak potion)\n<br />[*]The Wrapped Eashab ) (smokeable, medium strong, medium lengh durattion)\n<br />[*]The Filled Eashab Pipes (smokable, strong, short duration)\n<br />[*]Edible Eashab and Eashab Treat (medium strong, long duration)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Aswell as [color=#76a5af]Eashab Essence[/color] and [color=#f6b26b]Wrapped Elves Ear[/color]  /  Pipes filled with Elves Ear.\n<br />\n<br />Potions should be balanced, also by the fact that they can take effort to obtain.\n<br />All the mods items aim to be potentialy strong but negligible if wanted. Favoring maybe certain Mage and Assassin Builds.\n<br />(For those of you that wish to play with it being merely an uncommon presence in the game, like Skooma)\n<br />\n<br />Many \"Potions\" have the negative [color=#b6d7a8]Stamina drain[/color] Effect, that very slowly takes your Stamina away. \n<br />Others Fortify it[color=#efefef] li[/color]ke The [color=#ea9999]Sweetroll [/color][color=#efefef]now is a valuable treat. that gives Stamina but cuts its Regeneration. Skooma is stronger aswell , for a higher price.\n<br />[/color]Sweetrolls are craftable (cooking) and Sugar Pile as an ingedient. ([color=#e69138]may conflict with cooking overhauls [/color]that do something similar. you may end up with 2 Sweetroll recipes for example)\n<br />\n<br />The bright outfits are replaced by A craftale Assassins Outfit. (Eashassin, based off the [i]Ḥashāshīn),[/i]  Eashassin, Boots, an Eashassin Hood and a Robe, lootable from a Forsworn Mage. \n<br />\n<br />IMMERSION:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#6aa84f]The Forsworn[/color] smoke it (Rare Leveled List Items), \n<br />[*][color=#e69138]The Bandits[/color] smoke it. (Rare Leveled List Items) \n<br />[*][color=#ffd966]All Citizens[/color] smoke it.(Very Rare Leveled List Items)\n<br />[*]I think the [color=#6d9eeb]Stormcloaks[/color] and [color=#dd7e6b]Imperials[/color] smoke it too.\n<br />[*]Maybe even the [color=#00ff00]Highking[/color], who knows. \n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />It is not talked about in Skyrim as other things are of importance. There is no law yet considering the imported plant but its looked down upon.\n<br />Noone speaks about Sana Ora or the Weed.\n<br />\n<br />([color=#ffff00]RECOMMEND[/color]: selling dialoge initiation: [color=#e06666]OFF[/color])\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#00ff00]Recommended Mods: [/color]\n<br />[/b][/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/87974]Better Sweetrolls[/url]",
