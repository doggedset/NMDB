  "descriptionHtml": "Stalactites to make your rock caves look more interesting&#33;\r<br />\r<br /> \r<br />  There are 42 new meshes, and these are retextures of the vanilla icicles so they can be used in rocky caves. The meshes with a &#34;cw&#34; in the end of the name  use cave wall textures, the ones without it use cave rock textures and have a more crystalline surface (some real world stalactites have a crystalline look because of calcite crystals).I have not included the textures and cubemaps, since these meshes use vanilla stuff and the game should recognize them automatically.\r<br />\r<br />**********************************************************************\r<br />What´s new in version 2.0\r<br />**********************************************************************\r<br /> \r<br />-Included the stalactites´ bases meshes.\r<br />\r<br />-Included another kind of cave formation: travertines.\r<br />\r<br />-Included a new kind of stalactite: sulphur ones (14 meshes with a &#34;s&#34; at its end). Now it is possible to create an unique kind of cave.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />  This is a modders resource and they are not in-game yet, I have included an .esp file for evaluation purposes. If you want to check how they look, extract and activate stalactiteTEST.esp to your game &#34;Data&#34; folder, with the new meshes of course. Launch Skyrim, then use the console and type &#34;coc AAteststalactite&#34; to go to a cave with the crystalline stalactites, &#34;coc AAteststalactiteCW&#34; for a cave with the rocky ones and &#34;coc AAteststalactiteS&#34; for a sulphur cave.\r<br />\r<br />You may use and redistribute this in legal terms as you wish, just give me the credits&#33;",
