  "descriptionHtml": "The better mage\r\n[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/images/40460-1-1376713862.png[/img]\r\n\r\nSorry for my bad english as it isn\\'t my primary language. Welcome to my first mod.\r\nFirstly, I\\'m a fan of destruction magic. Its ranged and fun to play but it doesn\\'t scale with your level and equipments! Even you\\'re level 100 but the damage still remains the same! How do magicians survive in harder mode?\r\nSometimes I feel desperate because I can\\'t play with equipments and leveling totally doesn\\'t make spells more powerful. There are some awesome mods right there but I don\\'t want to make skyrim too complicated like SKSE. So, I decided to make one.\r\n\r\nSince version 1.9 you can make your spells became legendary so perks isn\\'t a problem. I\\'ve add some useful perks into destruction and conjouration tree. Additional destruction mods will increase damage for sure, and conjouration will lasts longer. In RPG games, mage usually deals high dps and consumes a lot of mana so I already made it. For conjouration, it annoying to cast every few minutes if your primary magic school isnt conjouring.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve started a new game to test this mod to test its balancing and bugs. Now, I\\'ve cleared winterhold quest and working on the main story line. So far, its fun and powerful. [color=red]This is still a beta, might unbalanced, but i decided to share it because i really have fun with it[/color]\r\n\r\n[Size=5] Installation [/size]\r\nJust extract the esp file to : skyrim folder\\\\data\r\nThen, enable it in data files.\r\n\r\n[size=5] Uninstalling [/size]\r\nMake the following perk legendary first and get back your perk points. Then ,uninstall the mod or you will lost the perks.\r\n\r\nThe new perks doesn\\'t scale with your level, but scales with magicka! The values will be nerfed anytime if i feel overpowered in my gameplay, or your suggestions. I don\\'t put the numbers because it breaks the skyrim LOL.\r\n\r\n[size=5]The new destruction perks : [/size]\r\n1. Arcane Mastery\r\nDeals additional damage. 4%/8%/12% of your current magicka. (Overpowered if not following the current magicka)\r\n\r\n2. Destruction Amplification\r\nAmplifies damage while increasing the magicka cost. When maxed, additional 30% magicka cost and 50% damage.\r\n\r\n3. Additional Amplification\r\nAdditional amplifies 35% magicka cost and 50% damage.\r\n\r\n4. Arcane Overdrive\r\n10% / 20% / 30% to deal (1% of your current magicka)x additional damage. (if your magicka is 300, deal 3x)\r\n\r\n5. Master of elements\r\nIgnores 75% of enemy\\'s resistance to your desired element. (Requires a lot of perk points!)\r\n\r\n[size=5]New conjouration perks : [/size]\r\n1. Conjouring mastery.\r\nAdditional (Magicka * 1%/2%/3%) seconds for summoned units.\r\n\r\n2. More souls\r\nCan summon (Magicka *1%) souls. (I\\'m having 600+ magicka, so i can summon 4~6, but I cant make it 0.5% >_<)\r\n\r\n[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/images/40460-1-1376713226.png[/img]\r\n\r\nAny suggestion is appreciated! Thank you for using my mods.",
