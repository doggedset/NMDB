  "descriptionHtml": "I thought the marriage options were not the best, and missed the variety that it could of had.

List of companions include Maggothe, Jolda, Kaassi, Baadar, Aralin, Olemee, Shabo, Tsabhi, Kaylort.\n<br />-Changed Aralin's voice type to be Dark Elf Female, allowing Aralin to be a companion as well.\n<br />\n<br />Known Quirks:\n<br />-Khajit male sounds like Argonian, Khajit female sounds like default nord female, High elf and Wood elf male sound like Dark elf male. Reason is that Bethesda did not include marriage voice sets for these races.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Follow me on Facebook for updates: [url=https://www.facebook.com/ArronDominionProductions/]Arron Dominion Productions[/url]",
