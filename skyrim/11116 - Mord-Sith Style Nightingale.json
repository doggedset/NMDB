  "descriptionHtml": "When playing through the game, I realized how much the Nightingale Armor reminded me of Mord-Sith armor from the Sword of Truth series. I decided to work on texturing it for my own personal use. After it was finished, I decided to share the final version with you all.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nThis mod will color the gloves and boots for the male version of the armor. I have not attempted to make a Crimson color armor and don\\'t really plan on doing one. Sorry for the inconvenience, but the Female armor relies on the Male textures for these parts and I don\\'t know how to make non-replacing versions of armors.",
