  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod on the Nexus, and it&#39;s a pretty simple one.\r<br />\r<br />Armored Articulation makes the armor rating of the Amulet of Articulation (the only armored piece of clothing in the game) much higher,\r<br />which allows for you to have normal clothing or light armor equipped on your character for whatever reasons you like (role-playing, better\r<br />character aesthetics, etc.), while still being able to partake in combat fairly normally. All versions of the amulet should have an armor rating\r<br />of 45. Enjoy the mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />-NasMaster",
