  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION\r\n============\r\nReading books now increase speech skill. Almost every book in the game is able to increase Speech skill progression towards next level twice. Reading book first time will increase Speech skill depending on players Speech skill level and represent greater increment. This increment will fall off in percentage as Speech level is close to 100 (but not too drastically) so player would need to read more books as skill level makes progress. Second reading will increase Speech skill progression for a small amount. At first, this second reading will have nice impact in comparison to the first reading on lower Speech levels, while later it will be barely noticeable on Speech level above 90. Third and every next reading of the book gives player nothing as nothing new to learn from the particular book.\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\n=======\r\n[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://SkyrimGEMS.com/images/badge_featured.png[/img][/url][/center]\r\nVersion 1.2 fixed visual of the text if speech skill is 100 and included extra files to work 100%\r\nVersion 1.1 makes Speech increases by certain percentage instead whole level\r\nOld version 1.0 is still there for those who wish to increase entire Speech skill level per book.\r\n\r\nVIDEO\r\n=====\r\nExample and Skyrim Mods series #74\r\n[youtube]GbZ2-KUxDs8[/youtube][youtube]mRx6CP5oWdw[/youtube]\r\n\r\nWHY\r\n====\r\nHaving speech skill ingame should be affected by the player if he read books i.e. person who reads more have better vocabulary and knowledge base for conversation. The only true leveling of speech is trough sales as there is not enough Persuade/Bribe options in game. Besides it is obvious that more literate people have better speech skills.\r\n\r\nAFFECTED BOOKS\r\n===============\r\nAll books that have no skill increase (or script) mady by Bethesda and one of the following conditions:\r\nBook is history lesson\r\nBook is a story\r\nBook is a poem\r\nBook is a tale\r\nAdded to this list some scientific research books\r\n\r\nOmitted books\r\n=============\r\nNotes\r\nTutorials\r\nJournals\r\nBlank books\r\nBethesda skill books\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION\r\n=================\r\nIt is very useful to have installed mod\r\nUnread Books Glow by duggelz\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10012#content\r\n\r\nLAST WORDS\r\n===========\r\nIt SHOULD work on Skyrim pre-Dawnguard version - haven\\'t tested this, I play it with Dawnguard.\r\nI tried so hard to exclude tutorial books, guides and descriptive books. If I messed up some, please let me know.\r\nThis file will be available on Steam Workshop too (if I don\\'t get lazy and sync my files to the cloud)",
