[/heading]\r\n[line]\r\n[img] http://i.imgur.com/wO7o0.jpg [/img]\r\n[b] Moving to Solitude as a child with his parents, Raginah\\'s caravan was raided by bandits. His family was slaughtered in front of him, and Raginah was left to die. He learned to survive on his own by hunting and selling his pelts. Putting his true skills to the test, Raginah encountered Krosis, the dragonpriest. Coming out of the battle triumphant, Raginah took his dagger as his own, and his legendary mask. Now Raginah keeps it as trophy, showing it to people who doubt his skills. [/b]",
