  "summary": "Adds a small cave with a portal to the top of High Hrothgar.",
  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE V2: The Player Home area of the cave has been improved upon. It now has more mannequins, weapon racks, chests, etc. A new sound has been added to the teleport stone also.\r\n\r\nSo recently I started a new character and I decided to take the immersive route and not use fast travel. After reaching High Hrothgar, it became evident that the constant climbing would become tedious. So I made this mod.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a small cave (that doubles as a mini player home) in Ivarstead that houses a portal to a room outside High Hrothgar. To get access to the portal you will need the key to the gate. The key is located in the top end of the portal (See pictures) This is so you will have to make the climb at least once to be able to have access to this portal.\r\n\r\nAs with everything I do, I do it for me... so if it doesn't strike you as something you like, ignore it please. (Directions to the cave are in the pictures)\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n----------\r\n- Myself ;)\r\n- Blary for his fantastic resources I used\r\n- Oaristys & Tony67 for their fantastic Modder's Resource pack",
