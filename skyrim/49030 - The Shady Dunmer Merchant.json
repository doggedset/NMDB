  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][b][color=red]The Shady Dunmer Merchant[/color][/b][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Just a quick mod I did for practice and thought others would enjoy. This adds in a Dunmer merchant in Begger&#39;s Row in Rfiten who sells rather, er, less-then-legal items such as Daedra and Human Hearts, Human Flesh, some armor and rings, bones, poisons, lockpicks, poisons, skooma, several ingredients and at higher levels, ebony, Daedric and Stalhrim weapons.\r<br />\r<br />Unfortunately, he doesn&#39;t have any unique dialogue (despite me trying). He&#39;s always open for buisness (which is what I didn&#39;t want, but meh) and he has 750 gold for trading.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Installation[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Download and drop the file into your data folder. Place meshes into the appropriately named folders. \r<br />Or just use the NMM. \r<br />To uninstall, just remove the file. \r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]====[b]Compatibility[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Compatible:[/i]\r<br />Everything and anything, there is no scriptsw and he is a simple NPC.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Incompatible:[/i]\r<br />None that I can think of. Incompatible NPCS makes a few more NPCs occupy Begger&#39;s Row, but it&#39;s not impossible to wander around there.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Permissions and Credits[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />This mod is not to be uploaded anywhere but the Skyrim Nexus. Please report to me if you see this anywhere else.\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating a great game and letting us fiddle with it. \r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Thanks for reading and check my page for more mods&#33;[/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7065334/?tb=mods&pUp=1 ] [IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/2dryws3.png[/IMG][/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
