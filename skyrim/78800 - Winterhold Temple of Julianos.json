  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=6]Temple of Julianos - Winterhold[/size][/center]\r<br />[center]I found it odd that there was no dedicated shrine in Winterhold. Yes it was destroyed but given the recent conflicts about divines and how religious the Nords seem to be I just found it odd. Plus Winterhold is one of my favorite Cities/Towns/Ruined place because I normally play as a Mage. \r<br />\r<br />So why Julianos and why Winterhold? I wanted to add something different to Winterhold, something that was not really done before. I did not want to make a massive mod so I thought small. Compact. This was the result. I released a previous mod on STEAM a few years back that just added a shrine to the corner of Winterhold but this time I wanted something in-doors. \r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-MA-\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]What it does:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a small temple to Julianos in Winterhold. Inside the temple is a Shrine to Julianos. \r<br />It is located to the right of the college bridge entrance, just behind one of the ruined houses.\r<br />\r<br />The Temple is not very big (Half a house&#33;) with the other half dedicated to living space for the priest that runs the temple. \r<br />The priest has a schedual, he will sandbox in the house from 8am - 8pm where he will then break for food while still inside the temple.\r<br />The temple closes its doors at 10pm and reopens at 8am. The door will be locked and you will not be able to access the temple during this time.\r<br />\r<br />The Temple is full Nav-meshed.\r<br />\r<br />Cleaned with TES-EDIT\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Compatibility:[/b][/u][/size][/center]\r<br />[center]This mod is NOT compatible with any mod that drastically changes Winterhold. So any massive restoration/more ruins mods will conflict.\r<br />It is NOT compatible with the STEAM mod: An alchemist for Winterhold as they both use the same location. \r<br />\r<br />It is compatible with: \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50491/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D50491%26preview%3D&pUp=1]QAXES Winterhold[/url] (I was using this in my play test)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65824/?]Winterhold stores[/url] (Alternative to QAXES mod)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53975/?]Vellamo - Mage home in Winterhold\r<br />[/url]\r<br />\r<br />It is also compatible with my other Winterhold mods:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50148/?]Winterhold Gate[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77889?]Winterhold Bridge Repair\r<br />[/url]\r<br />[/center][center][size=4][u][b]Credits:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Galdran for there [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70619/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D70619%26preview%3D&pUp=1]DIY Custom Banner[/url]s mod which was used to make the Julianos Banner.\r<br />AndrealphusVIII for pointing me towards Galdran&#39;s mod.\r<br />Nifskope team for Nifskope\r<br />DarkFox127: His tutorials are great&#33; Check them out on [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/DARKF0X127]his YouTube channel[/url]\r<br />\r<br />                                                               [/center]",
