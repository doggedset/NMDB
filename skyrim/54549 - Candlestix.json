It&#39;s added now and fully functional.\r<br />-Removed Tallow and replaced it with Honeycomb.\r<br />-Also Reduced the Brightnessto about half of the torches brightness.\r<br />\r<br />This was originally supposed to be an HD retexture of the items found in the &#34;Silver Linings&#34; quest.\r<br />Candlestix is a mod that adds a few features to the Basic &#34;Candle Mold&#34;.  This mod adds craft-able candle items that can be equiped like a torch.  Not everyone is happy with just a plain torch.  You can find the mold in &#34;Pinewatch Bandit&#39;s Sanctuary&#34;. Don&#39;t be mistaken by the quest item; I made this mold separate but, to go along with the quest.  Perhaps the bandits made a copy of the mold? Your choice.  The quest to find this mold is called &#34;Silver Lining&#34; and its part of the thieves guild. So this will be great for the thief merchant character you feel like making.  With the mold in your inventory, go to the smelter. Requiring a single silver or gold&#34; ingot you can craft either a silver or gold candlestick.\r<br />\r<br />To make the wax, simply bring a Honeycomb and the crafted Candlestick to a cookput to melt the beeswax into the proper shape, thus creating the Candle.\r<br />\r<br />The Candlesticks can be sold to vendors for a decent price, seeing how rare the mold is and all.           \r<br />\r<br />I also added an HD texture to the candlesticks and Mold models in-game.  The current ones were dull and boring.\r<br />\r<br />Permissions - \r<br />\r<br />You cannot upload or modify this mod without first seeking my permission.\r<br />                                      \r<br />Credits - \r<br />I must thank [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/776954/?]Tamira[/url] for help making the collision for the candlestick.  Would not be a mod without her help.                                          ",
