The fickle and highly annoying Creation Kit has F***ed it up as per usual) So after your vampirism takes effect totally open the console and type &#34;setrace Daevaracevampire&#34;  and once you are cured open the console and type &#34;setrace Daevarace&#34; Sorry for the inconvience.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The Daeva are servants of Angra Mainyu, also known as Ahriman, the destructive spirit, the Adversary. Angra Mainyu is the devil of the ancient world, the source of all evil. Angra Mainyu and the Daeva seek the destruction of the mortal world. The Daeva are primal and animalistic. Very nasty demons who respect only strength and power. They despise weakness. Those who serve Angra Mainyu are known as Servi Angra Mainyu\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />STATS\r<br />\r<br />One handed     10\r<br />Conjuration     5\r<br />Smithing         5\r<br />Sneak             5\r<br />Heavy Armor   5 \r<br />Lockpicking     5\r<br />\r<br />POWERS/RACIAL\r<br />\r<br />Terror of the Daeva (Fear 19 pnts on target for 30 secs)\r<br />Blood of the Daeva (Resist fire 30%)\r<br />Inkoke Nightmare (Summon demonic horse)",
