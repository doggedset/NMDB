  "modName": "Better Konahrik Mask",
  "summary": "Changes the enchantment on the final dragon priest mask to something a little more reliable and friendly to all character types.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I like to play with dark characters and typically stay away from elemental magic.  I found that the enchantment on Konahrik was not only unreliable, but since it only helped me when I was close to death it often didn\\'t help me when I wanted it too at all.  In addition, I thought ghosts appearing and flame shields surrounding me were a little out of character for a lot of my playstyles.\r\n\r\nSo what does this mod do?  Simple, it changes the enchantment on Konahrik to something you can always use, no matter what your character is.  Konahrik now gives a 50% reduction to your shout timer, meaning you can shout twice as much with it.  Powerful, as it should be considering how hard it is to get, but not god mode, and it will always benefit you instead of being a percent chance to turn you into a god.  ",
