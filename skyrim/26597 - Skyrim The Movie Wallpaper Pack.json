  "descriptionHtml": "[font=verdana][color=yellow][size=1]So, I don't know if anyone will remember but about 3 centuries ago I made a series of images here on the Nexus called \"Skyrim The Movie\", tracking the adventures of my first Skyrim character, Talea of Anvil.\r\n\r\nI just found them on my hard drive, so if you like this look as much as I do, you can now download them.\r\n\r\nThey are all high quality 1600x900 j-pegs (originals are long gone I'm afraid), but work really well at any resolution due to the highly stylized look.\r\n\r\nAnd, if there is enough interest, I may do a new series in this style...[/font][/color][/size]",
