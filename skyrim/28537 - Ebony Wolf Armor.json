  "summary": "A new stand alone set of Companions wolf armor in ebony so it\\'s longer a valid armor to wear. Retextured to match my ebony retexture.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The companions armor looks great but by the time I unlocked it my warrior was rocking ebony and saw no reason to downgrade.\r\n\r\nSo I made a not to make ebony version of the armor. Using my own retexture that\\'s the source of the ebony armor. Without it the armor might look less like ebony in your game. It took me nearly a year to get started on this but it\\'s finally done. \r\n\r\nIt\\'s sold by Eorlund at the Skyforge when you\\'ve unlocked the regular armor for sale. Stats are identical to ebony and should work with the matching set perk I think. I haven\\'t tested this as I got no heavy armor high level character that works on my current mod setup. So have fun and happy gaming!\r\n",
