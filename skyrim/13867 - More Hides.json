  "descriptionHtml": "MORE HIDES!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*********** DESCRIPTION **************\r\n\r\nThis is a simple mod that adds 4 new hide/pelt types to the game (Mammoth, Skeever, Dog, and Horker). They are obtainable by killing those animals then may be used to craft leather using a tanning rack. There is also a chance that you can loot Mammoth hides from a Giants inventory or a Skeever\\'s pelt from Bandits.\r\n\r\nI tried very hard to make this well balanced and merge well with the rest of the game. I don\\'t believe in god items and I\\'m one of those players that NEVER use cheats. If a mod feels like it\\'s giving me an unfair advantage in the game, I don\\'t use it. So my goal with this mod was to make something that I would be willing to use myself and not feel like it\\'s making the game any easier, rather just expanding upon it.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy. Please endorse and leave me any feedback you have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*********** UPDATES *****************\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\n\t- Horker Hides have been added to the mod along with the corresponding leather tanning recipe.\r\n\t- Skeever pelts can now be collected from Skeever\\'s trapped in spider webs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*********** INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS **************\r\n\r\n1) Simply extract files from the More Hides rar file into the Skyrim Data folder.\r\n\tC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n2) Play and Enjoy!\r\n\r\nNOW ALSO COMPATIBLE WITH THE NMM!",
