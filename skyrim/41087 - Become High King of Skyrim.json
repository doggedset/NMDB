That&#39;s right&#33; You can go on adventures with Ulfric, a Greybeard, even boss enemies like Harkon, Ysolda (and turn her into a powerful warrior), anyone you can talk to can be a follower&#33;\r<br />... have your own army that will follow you on command, fight your battles while you sit back and have any NPC&#39;s like Lydia, Miraak or even kids join that army?\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]Well if you said yes to any of the above, and even if you didn&#39;t, this mod is for you&#33; This mod has so many features you are bound to find at least one of them useful&#33; Heck this mod even has a legendary armor that turns you invisible when you crouch&#33; \r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][center][color=orange]II. USAGE[/color][/center][/size]\r<br />- do not use on a new game. Use this mod AFTER you are done with all the preliminary introduction quests\r<br />- this mod has no voice file yet, use your subtitles\r<br />- requires no DLC&#39;s. Just updated Skyrim base game\r<br />- each version release is STANDALONE and will work by itself \r<br />\r<br />[size=4][center][color=orange]III. ALL NPC&#39;s ARE NOW KILLABLE[/color][/center][/size]\r<br />- added an optional patch file that makes everyone killable. Please report any NPC&#39;s that still won&#39;t die.\r<br />[color=red]- Warning: Killing NPC&#39;s that shouldn&#39;t die can break quests[/color]\r<br />- you can toggle any NPC&#39;s essential/nonessential status through dialogue\r<br />- type &#34;set aakingextra to 0&#34; to disable the &#34;Are you essential?&#34; dialogue\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][center][color=orange]IV. SURGUS OF THE BLACK[/color][/center][/size]\r<br />Adds a new NPC in the Warrens district of Markarth that starts the Highking quest\r<br />- offers to assassinate people for you. Simply walk up to the NPC you hate, Mark him with a new dialogue option then return to Surgus. Pay him 1500 gold and he will take care of your problem for you \r<br />\r<br />[size=4][center][color=orange]V. BECOME HIGH KING OF SKYRIM&#33;[/color][/center][/size]\r<br />- first, talk to Surgus to begin the quest\r<br />- the quest objectives are just there for information, they won&#39;t track your progress nor will they complete. But that does not mean it&#39;s not working. Just do the requirements and talk to Surgus after\r<br />\r<br />[color=gold]To become High King, you need to:[/color]\r<br />1. Have 50,000 gold for your campaign\r<br />2. Gain 20 supporters to support your claim\r<br />3. ANY of the following:\r<br />- Kill Ulfric or have him assassinated\r<br />- Kill Elisif or have her assassinated\r<br />OR\r<br />- Marry Elisif or Ulfric (The marriage quest has been modified to accomodate for them)\r<br />OR\r<br />- Gain 40 supporters to support your claim instead of 20\r<br />\r<br />[color=green]\r<br />To gain supporters, talk to somebody you have a high realtionship rank with after you have started the quest.
