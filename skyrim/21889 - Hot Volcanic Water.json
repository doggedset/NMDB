Well, you can in Skyrim - hence the need for this mod.\r<br />\r<br />This is a simple mod which makes volcanic water (such as the hot springs outside the Eldergleam Sanctuary) do 2 points of damage.  \r<br />\r<br />Most areas that have geysers (technically &#34;perpetual spouters&#34;) are affected, but one or two sections of water that look volcanic aren&#39;t recognised by the game as volcanic water and won&#39;t cause the damage.\r<br />\r<br />An unintended side effect of this is that it appears to kill the bathing hunters nearby if you&#39;re in the area for long enough*.  Serves them right for trying to bathe in boiling water.\r<br />\r<br />*OPTIONAL BETA VERSION AVAILABLE - adds locational damage directly to the spouts - doesn&#39;t harm the bathing hunters, and only damages the player if you walk right into the spout.  Only a quarter of spouts covered so far, more will be covered in next update.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is compatible with W.A.T.E.R.\r<br />",
