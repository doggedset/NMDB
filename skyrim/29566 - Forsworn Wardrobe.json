  "descriptionHtml": "No longer be forced to choose between aesthetics or gameplay stats optimization! With this mod, you can turn your Elven, Scaled, Glass and Dragonscale armour pieces into Forsworn versions with the same stats.\r\n\r\nThe armour pieces are crafted at the forge. No smithing perks needed. The Forsworn variations are considered by the game to be made of Elven/Scaled/Glass/Dragonscale material, meaning:\r\n1) you still need the appropriate smithing perks to temper them at double magnitude.\r\n2) the Matching Set perk applies if you\\'ve got a full set of the same \\\"material\\\".\r\n\r\nFor tempering, rather than requiring Ingots, I\\'ve changed the ingredients to items you can get from hunting, to stay within the Forsworn theme. For instance to temper a Forsworn Glass Armor you don\\'t need a Malachite Ingot (worth 100 gold). Instead you need 9 Leather, a Sabre Cat Tooth and 1 Small Antlers, for a total of 94 gold.",
