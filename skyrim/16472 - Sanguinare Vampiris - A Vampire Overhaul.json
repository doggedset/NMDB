You will be required to choose perks based on what kind of vampire you wish to be.\r\n[color=red][list][*]Blood Path of the Savage: geared towards warrior type characters.\r\n[*]Blood Path of the Dark Arts: geared towards mage type characters.\r\n[*]Blood Path of the Night: geared towards thief/assassin type characters.[/list][/color]\r\nThe intention of this mod is to make vampires more fun, but also to maintain the feeling of a curse. Sunlight will make you very weak and you will only be able to choose between stat buffs for different skills. This is intended to keep vampires from becoming overpowered.\r\nIn order to add a new perk tree, I had to merge one with another. I decided to merge Pickpocketing with Lockpicking. You can now unlock all of the Pickpocketing perks through the Lockpicking perk tree. As a result of this Pickpocketing no longer levels any skills, but I think it is a worthwhile compromise.\r\nThis mod is very complete but it is also the first one I have made. If there are any bugs or issues whatsoever please feel free to let me know and I will work hard to get everything sorted out.\r\n\r\n[center][img] http://img849.imageshack.us/img849/9603/perks.png [/img][/center]Initiate: 1 day as a vampire and 1 neck bitten.\r\n[color=red][list][*]Vampiric Athletics: 5% faster movement Speed.

If anyone has any ideas please share them with me!\r\n[*]I might restructure the way the Vampirism perk tree looks just to make it fit in more with the image, but I decided to wait and see if I add any more perks.\r\n[*]The Lockpicking perk tree could be a little cleaner I guess, I might work on that in the future.\r\n[*]Screenshots are still to come.\r\n[*]Make this description page prettier.[/list]\r\n\r\n[center][img] http://img600.imageshack.us/img600/5084/installn.png [/img][/center][list][*]First you will need to install ScriptDragon. This is used to control the jump height bonuses distributed by the perks. You can use the mod without ScriptDragon, but you won\\'t be able to jump higher.\r\n[*]You can get the latest version of ScriptDragon here: http://alexander.sannybuilder.com/?altname=skyrim_script_dragon\r\n[*]Thanks to jimhsu for making the ScriptDragon plugin to control jump height! http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14437\r\n[*]Once you have ScriptDragon installed you can either extract the contents of this archive to your \\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\, or use NMM to install it automatically.\r\n[*]This mod should probably be loaded somewhere near the bottom of your load order.[/list]\r\n\r\n[center][img] http://img833.imageshack.us/img833/1548/compat.png [/img][/center][list][*]This mod will be incompatible with any mods that directly affects the vampire stages, the Pickpocket and Lockpicking perk trees. It also may not be compatible with mods that give the player perks in any other way than leveling up.\r\n[*]Bottle That Blood - For Vampires by LFox. This mod has been tested and works with Sanguinare Vampiris.\r\n[*]Werepyres - Vampire and Werewolf by MGoods. This mod has been tested and works with Sanguinare Vampiris.\r\n[*]Better Vampire Sight and Night Eye by LloydChristoph. This mod has been tested and works with Sanguinare Vampiris and is pretty much a must have if using Realistic Lighting.\r\n[*]Path of Shadows by Ronyn. If you want to be a sneaky vampire assassin, then use this mod along with mine. It adds a lot of perks and abilities that go very well with my mod, and more specifically if you follow the Bloof Path of the Night.\r\n[*]If anyone has tested out any other mods that are compatible with this or are worth mentioning let me know and I will add them to the list.\r\n[/list]",
