  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Slightly Less Terrible Hanging Herbs\r\nVersion: 1\r\nDate: 12/25/2012\r\nCategory: Models and Textures\r\nAuthor: faeriexdecay\r\nSource: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28907\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/28907-1-1356479932.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nIf you\\'ve ever been to an inn or inside a person\\'s home, you\\'ll likely have seen the hanging pixel puke next to the garlic. That pixel puke is actually supposed to be herbs - Elves Ear and Frost Mirriam. Well, I\\'ve attempted to make that puke texture a little easier on the eyes by increasing the resolution, sharpening, adjusting saturation and contrast, and a few other tiny tweaks. It\\'s not HD. It\\'s not professional. It\\'s not super amazing. But I think it looks a hell of a lot less painful than vanilla.\r\n\r\nPS: The texture size might be a bit large for something this small, so I have added an optional reduced version that is closer to vanilla\\'s size for those who want to try it. Please note that these reduced textures are untested.\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE:[/b] This mod does not retexture the garlic, only the herbs beside it. If you want the garlic texture seen in my screenshots, try [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1192]this mod[/url].\r\n\r\nNMM Install and Uninstall\r\n=======================\r\nYou should know what to do. :D Contains just 2 textures, so super easy and fast to add/remove with NMM.\r\n\r\nManual Install\r\n=============\r\n1.
