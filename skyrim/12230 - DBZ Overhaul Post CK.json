  "descriptionHtml": "Here is our awaited 2.0 drop for Skyrimball Z ( Semi overhaul/Non-Lore friendly Skyrim Enhancer!)\r\n\r\nSo what do you get in 2.0?\r\nDBZ Standalone Spells \r\n   Kaioken x2/x10 ( stackable spell)-This is a charging spell, for show accuracy.\r\n   The Kamehameha 2.0 ( Fast Cast Style, Traditional, Japanese Goku, and Krillin)\r\n   KiBlast 2.0 (more balanced)\r\n   KiBlast Auto (less powerful, but it autofires)\r\n   Triple Threat Descructo-Disc (krillin)\r\nNew Playable Saiyan Race!\r\n4 Dragonball Hair Alphas\r\nGoku\r\nVegeta\r\nYamcha the Desert Bandit\r\nOub from Dragonball GT \r\nDragonballZ battle gloves for non-saiyans ( saiyans do 65 unarmed damage naturally)\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re running our first version, please uninstall all the files. \r\nInstallation is drop in your datafolder and go! multiple esp\\'s so feel free to pick and choose what you want! \r\n\r\nHere\\'s a video of them in action! ( no music as to hear the sfx better)!\r\n[youtube]I8aw1C_ggDI[/youtube]\r\nYou can search our old entry for more videos of the progression of the project. \r\n\r\nAlso, this is not exactly lore friendly. It\\'s not meant to be. It\\'s not going to be a huge overhaul. it\\'s meant to get the dragonball races in and explain their exsistence, and as soon as my quest line is completed...it will be. \r\n\r\nSuggested Mod\\'s to enjoy this more:\r\nNo fall damage: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9008\r\nGoku outfit: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7205\r\nScouter ( it rocks!) http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9690\r\n\r\nAlso we removed the dragonball bat file as it screwed up some people\\'s games. you can google how to increase jump height and running speed...it\\'s pretty easy. \r\n\r\nWe are figuring out how to add the new spell/energy attack tomes to the game to a merchant, so there might be a small update really soon. Until then, just console help\\\"kamehameha/senzu/destructo/dbz/ki blast...ect\\\" 0 and make sure to add only spell tomes and in the case of senzu beans the alchemy entry not the ingredient. \r\n\r\nHEY HEY HEY!\r\nLike DBZ and want to see more in skyrim? Well we\\'re looking for some help! If you can do the following, please send us a message!\r\nScripting\r\nTexturing ( we have meshes, but can\\'t get our textures to wrap right, we can do the rigging)\r\nCan somehow make people fly\r\nOr just want to get in on the fun!",
