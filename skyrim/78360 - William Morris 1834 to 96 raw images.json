  "descriptionHtml": "William Morris (1834-1896) was an author, artist, designer and medievalist often credited with writing the first high fantasy books.\r<br />\r<br />These are images i&#39;ve had sitting around waiting for me to do something with them on my desktop for a while.\r<br />They&#39;re a mix of seamless patterns and slices big enough to be made seamless, some random pages from his books and a rare painting of his, all in medieval or pseudo-medieval styles, useful for wallpapers or fabric patterns.\r<br />\r<br />Loads more of his patterns and images are widely available. I&#39;m mostly posting this because I like his work and I think others would too.\r<br />\r<br />Cheers&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Red\r<br />\r<br />edit; Updated with some larger examples I had meant to include initially. Sorry for any inconvenience.",
