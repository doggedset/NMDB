  "descriptionHtml": "Scale-Kin\\'s Skyrim Overhaul\r\nVersion 0.2\r\n\r\nThis mod aims to overhaul Skyrim by providing more of a challenge, realism and things that should have been there in the first place!\r\nThis version is untested and thus awaiting your feedback!\r\n\r\nCurrent Features:\r\nPotions and food will heal, or provide their effects over time (usually a dew seconds), poisons will also do this, this should prevent spamming foods and potions.\r\nAlcohol slows magicka regeneration!\r\nImproved AI:\r\nI focused more on dragons, but wolves should now act more like pack animals and be less aggressive, many other creatures and NPCs are improved!\r\nArgonians now do claw damage, swim faster and they can also do combat while swimming!\r\nThe racial skill of restoration has been replaced by alchemy, as it seems more logical with a swamp full of poisons!\r\nArgonians now have a few more skin colours!\r\nBetter melee combat (WIP)\r\nCombat will be deadly in future, for now melee attacks and shield bashing are closer!\r\nMore powerful traps (less delay, higher fire-rates, generally script-based atm)\r\nThankyou for at least considering to try my mod!\r\nSuggestions and welcome and I appreciate feedback!\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n0.2\r\nFixed bugs, removed supposed \\\"ragdoll collisionm which didn\\'t work.\r\nAdded trap tweaks and tweaked races.\r\nArgonians now have a few more skin colours!\r\n",
