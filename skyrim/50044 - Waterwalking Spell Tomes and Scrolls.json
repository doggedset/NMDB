  "summary": "Adds Waterwalking as a common spell.",
  "descriptionHtml": "One of the most sought-after magical effects in TES III: Morrowind and TES IV: Oblivion was the ability of waterwalking. However, this ability was not included in the original version of TES V: Skyrim. But with the Dragonborn DLC, it has again made its appearance in Ahzidal&#39;s Boots of Waterwalking. Unfortunately, the ability is only accessible through these boots. But in this mod, I&#39;ve added the effect for common use.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds two Spell Tomes that can teach the player how to cast the spell, and four scrolls that accomplish the same effect for one-time use. The tomes and scrolls are placed in various locations across Solstheim. They are also available for purchase from merchants.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve provided two images to give hints at the locations for one scroll and one tome. The remaining items shouldn&#39;t be too hard to locate during your adventures in Dragonborn.\r<br />\r<br />If you wanted this effect for enchanting, please refer to my mod; &#34;Boots of Waterwalking&#34;. You can find this mod here; nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50008/\r<br />\r<br />Note: This mod requires the Dragonborn DLC, as well as the update needed to play it. As obvious as this might seem, I felt it needed to be stated in the description.\r<br />",
