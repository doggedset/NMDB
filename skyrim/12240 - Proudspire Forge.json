  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a forge (with Skyforge capabilities) etc. to Proudspire Manor in Solitude. It\\'s not the prettiest looking add-on ever, but it works. This is my second mod.\r\n-------------\r\nI got tired of running back and forth between the forge in Solitude and my house, so I added a sub-basement with a forge and all the other utilities that go along with crafting. I also placed an apothecary satchel on the alchemy table for storing ingredients, and a knapsack next to the enchanter for holding soul gems. You WILL still have to upgrade your basement to reach these.\r\n\r\nComplete list of what this adds:\r\n--\r\nSub-basement room\r\nForge (with Skyforge capabilities)\r\nSmelter\r\nTanning Rack\r\nGrinding Wheel\r\nWorkbench\r\nChopping block w/ Woodcutter\\'s Axe\r\nApothecary Satchel for storing ingredients\r\nKnapsack for storing soul gems\r\n3 more Mannequins\r\n2 Weapon Plaques behind each Mannequin\r\n2 chests to hold crafting ingredients\r\nA weapon rack next to the chopping block to hold the Woodcutter\\'s Axe (It is a known bug that the axe does not react well with the rack. It will fly next to it, but it will stay there, at least)\r\n\r\nPlease give me suggestions on how I can improve this.\r\n\r\nFor my Steam file:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=12103\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n\r\n------------\r\n03.11.12\r\n------------\r\nChanged the Skyforge into a regular forge with Skyforge crafting capabilities.\r\nAdded NavMeshes\r\n\r\n------------\r\n02.20.12\r\n------------\r\nAdded Weapon plaques behind the Mannequins.\r\nAdded Light to the room (It was too dark)\r\nAdded a weapon rack next to the chopping block to hold the Woodcutter\\'s Axe",
