  "descriptionHtml": "Story\r\n=====\r\nRecent rumors speak of a lone, terrifying draugr near Whiterun \r\nat Hamvir\\'s Rest. As dragonborn it is your sworn duty to defend the \r\npeople of Whiterun. Upon encountering this draugr, he greets you and \r\nbegins to speak to you. Apparently you are the first person hes been \r\nable to speak to due to everyone else running away. He has no memory \r\nof his past except for a wedding band left in his possession with \r\nsome initials inscribed in it. Will you take him along with you on \r\nyour adventures or leave him to rot at Hamvir\\'s Rest?\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n==========\r\n<Version 1.3>\r\n+Remade from scratch using the latest CK and Skyrim version. \r\n+Victim of the nerfbat, lowering health, and removing Frost/Fire Breath shouts.\r\n+Now efficient with maces.\r\n+Optional file that adds DG\\'s undead healing spells next to his coffin.\r\n+Removed wedding band for now...\r\n\r\n<Version 1.2>\r\n+ Custom faction added which should prevent bounty related hostilities.\r\n\r\n<Version 1.1>\r\n Revert to a save before original mod was used to make sure he is updated properly.\r\n+ Removed factions causing him to be hostile when released from service.\r\n+ Removed skeletons from Hamvir\\'s rest to prevent improper awakening.\r\n+ Removed starting ammo supply to avoid an issue that causes him to be \r\n   incapable of ranged combat after picking up ammo from enemies \r\n(see mod recommendations for additional help).\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis is the first of what I have planned for a series of new followers. \r\nThis is also my first mod, so be gentle I am still learning.To be honest \r\nI hate most of the vanilla followers. They are not very intelligent, \r\ntend to cause more trouble then they are worth, and become rather weak \r\nlate game/on higher difficulties, and lack uniqueness. As a result, \r\nI picked up the creation kit and made this Draugr follower. Read on to \r\nsee what makes this follower more useful than the vanilla followers.\r\n\r\n<Behaviour>\r\n-When awoken he rises from the coffin like a legitmate draugr.\r\n-Combat: Typical Draugr Death Overlord AI\r\n\t+ Good judgement of enemy weaknesses when using shouts \r\n\t  (more accurate than enemy draugr shouts too)\r\n\t+ Capable of Tanking, 2H-Offense, and Ranging\r\n\t+ Prefers 2H weapons over shield and sword if both setups are in \r\n\t  his inventory.\r\n\t+ Will switch between Tanking/Ranging or 2H-Offense/Ranging \r\n\t  when appropriate.\r\n-Limitations:\r\n\t+ No magicka or spells.\r\n\t+ Incapable of sneaking due to drauger animation limitations.\r\n\t+ Same pesky follower bow issues. To fix simply remove the \r\n\t  Druagr Supple Bow from his inventory and add desired bow.\r\n\t+ Due to draugr animation limitations, if using any shield other \r\n\t  than an Iron Shield or Ebony Shield it will not display, but will \r\n\t  function normally for blocking and stats (as far as I know he \r\n\t  should be able to use all weapons normally).\r\n-WARNING:\r\n\t+ If you are in the way of his shouts they will merely stagger you.\r\n\t+ If you go into a finishing move animation at the same time he \r\n\t  shouts, you WILL be injured by it upon exiting the animation.\r\n\t+ When facing enemy draugr he favors Fire Breath Shout. If you \r\n\t  happen to be standing on oil next to his target you are likely \r\n\t  to get 3rd degree burns.\t\r\n\r\n\r\n<Notable Features>\r\n-Essential Character.\r\n-A follower that can shout.\r\n-Few vanilla followers in the game have perks, this follower has several \r\nperks relevant to his combat styles (Improves late game performance and/or \r\nhigher difficulty performance).\r\n-Doesn\\'t set off pressure plate based traps \r\n(thanks to Light Foot perk)...thats right I\\'m looking at you Lydia.\r\n-Increased speed to keep up better and eliminate slow draugr issues.\r\n-Levels with player up to level 81 (starts at level 10, 6 version 1.3) without the use \r\nof other mods like UFO.\r\n-Equipment & Defense: \r\n\t+ Starting inventory(1.2 and lower): Honed Draugr Battle Axe, Honed Draugr Sword,\r\n\t  Iron Shield, Supple Draugr Bow.\r\n        + Starting inventory(1.3): Draugr Battle Axe, Draugr Sword,\r\n\t  Iron Shield, Draugr Bow, Ancient Nord Armor set.\r\n\t+ 100% resistance to poison, 10% magic resistance, \r\n\t  and 50% frost resistance.\r\n-Shouts: \r\n\t+ Unrelenting Force Shout\r\n\t+ Fire Breath Shout(removed in 1.3)\r\n\t+ Frost Breath Shout(removed in 1.3)\r\n\t+ Disarm Shout\r\n\r\n<Location>\r\n-Make your way to Hamvir\\'s Rest, see pictures to get an idea of where that is, or use console \r\ncommand \\\"coc hamvirsrestexterior01\\\".\r\n-To awaken him from the coffin just approach it.\r\n-If dismissed he will return to stand by the coffin.\r\n-If lost try wait for 1 hour, or check back at his coffin in 3 days.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nDrop files into the Skyrim Data folder, default location: \r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n-Remove the VahruktCompanion.esp file from the data folder.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n=============\r\n-Works with UFO follower mod, MUST BE LOADED AFTER to work\r\n-Potential issues with any other mods that edit the \r\n cell: HamvirsRestExterior01\r\n-If he does not appear at Hamvir\\'s Rest, try adjusting the load order \r\nso that this companion mod is loaded last (highest priority). \r\n\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n==========\r\n<Minor>\r\n-Draugr outfit now comes with clothes in 1.3, Bethesda did it not me.\r\n-When first discovered, armor will not be equipped. (just add or remove anything and it\\'ll fix itself).\r\n-If injured to the point of near death aka \\\"bleedout\\\" mode he will not recover until \r\nall combat has ceased, after that he is good to go (see DG optional file for fix). \r\n-Minor animation error for melee weapons occur on occasion, it fixes itself though.\r\n-Animation issue with displaying some shields.\r\n-If awoken by an enemy, he appears from the coffin before the lid pops off\r\n\r\n<Major>\r\n-None disovered yet\r\n\r\nRecommendations\r\n===============\r\n-Check out my other companion mod, Domkavosh the Betrayer.\r\n-Use UFO Follower mod for the friendly fire feature for your own safety:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037\r\n-If you still have issues with follower bow/ammo problems I highly recommend\r\nthis mod (try loading this mod after the follower mod): http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13400\r\n\r\nCredits and Permissions\r\n=======================\r\nThanks to Bethesda for releasing the creation kit.\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n========\r\nLet me know if you run in to any bugs not already listed, and provide a \r\ndescription of the situation so that I can replicate the bug for testing. \r\nI\\'d love to hear any suggestions in order to make him the best warrior \r\nfollower. If you want to see other useful companions like this then show \r\nyour approval by voting/endorsing. ",
