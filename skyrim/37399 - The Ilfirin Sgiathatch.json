  "descriptionHtml": "\r\nThe Ilfirin Sgiathatch adds three new follower to the game including, Enlila, Destinia, and Grond. The followers are located in three different holds being the Reach, the Rift, and Winterhold. These new characters have a range of abilities that allow them to be ranged, hand to hand, and magical abilities.\r\n\r\n======================================================================================\r\n\r\nDescriptions:\r\nEnlila- The Mage, a Breton who can heal herself and casts some advanced spells. Enlila is an avid mage of the College Winterhold who easily becomes immersed in the books of the Arcaneum.\r\n  \r\nGrond- The Warrior, a Nord who uses brute strength to achieve his ends (he is also part giant). He is attempting to find a home where the ground turns white in the Rift.\r\n\r\nDestinia- The Hunter, a ranged Bosmer follower archer. She tends to roam the reach searching for the best game.\r\n========================================================================================\r\n\r\nIf you like this mod, check out these other mods\r\n\r\nOther Mods:\r\n\r\n-Fea Rana         http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36200/\r\n-Vares Rarem    http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35052/\r\n-Istalindir         http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34818/\r\n========================================================================================\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-This mod requires Apachii Skyhair\r\n-Let me know if enough people want a version of the mod without the required mod.\r\n-Post any questions, and I will answer them as soon as I can.\r\n-Feel free to post screenshots",
