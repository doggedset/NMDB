  "descriptionHtml": "With the release of Bodyslide 2 and Outfit studio, converting outfits to Bodyslide has become much easier. I&#39;ve taken it upon myself to try and convert the rest of Skyrim&#39;s outfits to Bodyslide.\r<br />\r<br />There will be issues with some outfits; some not having been converted, clipping, texture madness and the like. It&#39;s your duty, as a downloader, to report to me any and all issues that are to do with this mod.\r<br />\r<br />If you have mods (such as HDT physics) and are having issues, disable those first and see if it persists.\r<br />\r<br />This is best used with Caliente&#39;s original mod, as I&#39;m not going to reinvent the wheel unless her outfits have issues which I can remedy. Get it here. http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12273/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Known issues:\r<br />\r<br />Mage robes have messed up lighting - *UPDATE* I may have figured out the problem. It involves removing parts of the mesh and enabling a flag in Nifskope. When I get over the slight burnout of converting the 59 or so outfits, I&#39;ll fix it.\r<br />\r<br />Dragonscale has black textures on arms - Don&#39;t know how to solve this issue.\r<br />\r<br />Savior&#39;s Hide doesn&#39;t morph. Will fix.\r<br />\r<br />The female ragged trouser continuity version doesn&#39;t work. Will fix.",
