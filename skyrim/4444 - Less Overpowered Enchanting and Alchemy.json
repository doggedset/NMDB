  "descriptionHtml": "(NO LONGER SUPPORTED)\r\n\r\nTwo files:\r\n\r\nLess Overpowered Enchanting removes +smithing and +alchemy effects from the enchanting table and world loot, and replaces them with innocuous Fortify Health & Fortify Magicka effects.  Note that there will now be two Fortify Health, and two Fortify Magicka effects on the enchanting table.  I\\'m too much of a newb to know how to fix this, but if you know how, let me know and I\\'ll update.\r\n\r\nLess Overpowered Alchemy removes +smithing and +enchanting potions from vendors and the world, and replaces those effects on ingredients with other effects, including several +destruction damage effects to improve pure magic-user viability.\r\n\r\nUse either or both.  This is my first mod, so any hyper-technical questions I will probably be unable to answer.  If you want to use this idea or mod in another mod or mod compilation, no permission is required, just credit me please.  Thanks, and enjoy.\r\n\r\n*** At the request of Imp of the Perverse (thanks for the idea!), I have made an alternate version of the Less Overpowered Enchanting mod.  Be sure that you only use ONE of the two Less Overpowered Enchanting .esps.  The alternate version leaves +alchemy and +smithing enchanting effects in the game, but significantly reduces their potency by reducing base enchantment values (scaling is unaffected).  It also reduces the potency of +onehanded, +twohanded, and +archery enchantments.  If there is demand, I may integrate the latter change into the main version as well.  The numbers are as follows:\r\n\r\nFortify Alchemy Enchant Without Mod: 8/12/15/17/20/22/25\r\nFortify Alchemy Enchant With Mod: 4/4/6/8/10/12/15\r\n\r\nFortify Smithing Enchant Without Mod: 8/12/15/17/20/22/25\r\nFortify Smithing Enchant With Mod: 4/4/6/8/10/12/15\r\n\r\nFortify Onehanded/Twohanded/Archery Enchant Without Mod: 13/15/20/25/30/35/40\r\nFortify Onehanded/Twohanded/Archery Enchant With Mod: 5/5/8/11/14/17/20\r\n",
