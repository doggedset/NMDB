Which likely comes as a surprise to no one who actually knows me, since I’m clearly too broken to have stayed away forever. Anyway, heeeeeeeeeeey. I’m back. \n<br />\n<br />What does this mean for you, me and the future of this mod? That’s an excellent question. \n<br />\n<br />My plan, such as it is, is to focus on the new a/k/a SSE version first and foremost. I have two towns (Darkwater and Riverwood) completely done (mostly done... as \"done\" as I'm capable of being), and the rest I’ll get to, one at a time, until all 24083049824 are at least somewhat usable. Per people asking me about it a whole bunch, I've also posted the WIP SSE version for LE over here. Sooo... good luck with that you brave and wonderful souls. \n<br />\n<br />In any event, now back to it...\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/U3jbuWn.png[/img]\n<br />There are (mercifully) a whole bunch of people now working on this giant unending monstrosity with me...\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/tP146Cf.png[/img][/center]\n<br />Whether with writing (I do like zero of the writing for this thing now, thank God), voice acting, or testing (in addition to helping out on the comment thread and discord (speaking of which, many thanks also to Thallassa, the reigning Queen of the Internet, for doing nearly all of my discord crap for me, including, but not limited to, teaching me how to use the damn thing), providing patches, supplying me with wine, moral and psychological support, random information on bees and mead, and also on Skyrim (did you know there's like a whole game in there? I did not.) or donations of their awesome meshes (please see credits at the bottom for more info on mesh donations) - You guys are amazing, and wonderful, and also good looking, and I literally wouldn't be able to do this without you. \n<br />\n<br />And while I'm off on a thanking-people tangent... To Nazenn - I cannot possibly thank you enough for all the wonderful work you've done for me with ETaC (and other mods) (and everywhere else – you've got a lot on your plate, you're literally a machine) in my absence. You're the best ever,. A million trillion thanks to you for... everything. All of it lol. &lt;3\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/99If1Jy.png[/img]\n<br />Many thanks to the respective creators for making these translations possible. \n<br />(Click the images to be taken to their pages.) \n<br />[url=https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/13608-0-1502352899.png[/img][/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41378/?]Polish Translation[/url] by LordTorus\n<br />[url=http://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/skyrim/mods/bordeciel/villes_et_villages/extension_des_villes_et_villages_%5Bversion_complete%5D]French Translation[/url] by Sita\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49231/?]Deutsch Translation[/url] by Severin von Saarthal\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66517/?]Italian Translation[/url] by Logan1710\n<br />[url=http://gamer-mods.ru/load/skyrim/doma_i_lokacii/rasshirennye_goroda_i_poselenija_skajrima_v8_3_expanded_towns_and_cities/15-1-0-1799]Russian Translation[/url] by Santiya\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/bCLxDF0.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[b][u]DARKWATER CROSSING[/u][/b]\n<br />- Added 4 additional houses.\n<br />- Added 6 NPCs.\n<br />- Added gather crops option.\n<br />- Added general store.\n<br />- Added inn / tavern.\n<br />- Added \"docks\".

So if you came here expecting identical towns, with identical people and identical layouts – Prepare yourself, because you’re about to be sorely disappointed lol. This was built from the ground up, taking into account everything I have learned in MY CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE AND/OR WISDOM (lol jokes, I clearly have neither of those things) to try and give you and me and everybody a much better mod overall. \n<br />\n<br />I made a lot of mistakes with the old ETaC. Things that, given the opportunity (and a time machine), I would never had done in the first place. Mostly for my own sanity. As it turned out, I now HAVE that opportunity to build the mod I’d always wanted to build, so buckle up mod-friendos, we’re going to go on a little adventure together. Which brings me to…\n<br />\n<br />List of changes!\n<br />\n<br />As for specifics, I’ll be omitting the small \"aesthetic\" changes from these list (i.e. clutter, trees, wildlife, lanterns, blah blah) as identifying every single barrel I’ve moved and tree I’ve added would be a huge enormous pain in my arse. (Read: am lazy! HI!) Anyway. (Those things excluded) here's what you get...\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/WpKGGOV.png[/img]\n<br />- Added 6 new houses.\n<br />- Added 9 new NPCs. \n<br />- Added new custom dialogue for said NPCs\n<br />- Added new quest (misc): Riften Delivery.  \n<br />- Added some vanilla options that were available in other towns, but not here for whatever reason...\n<br />- Like the gathering of wood and food for those of you who had fervently wished you'd been born into a life of farming and woodcutting.\n<br />- Added a general store.\n<br />- Added an inn/tavern for the sleeping and the consuming of the wines.\n<br />- Added a shrine and alchemy bench for the healing of your poor diseased self.\n<br />- Added a well for drinking water.\n<br />- Added exterior chimneys for houses because fireplaces.\n<br />- Added additional farms, farmers, fishermen, and hunters.\n<br />- Added additional woodcutters; And, NPCs will collect firewood for their houses daily.\n<br />- Added ownership data to all the random exterior items/barrels/etc.\n<br />- Added occulusion planes to houses / walls / etc. for better performance.\n<br />- Added smoke / light to forges and smelters. \n<br />- Added armor bench and sharpening wheel to blacksmith area.\n<br />- Added horse marker for player horse.\n<br />- Gave vanilla homeless NPCs homes (Derkeethus, Sondas, Tormir and Hrefna.)\n<br />- Derkeethus Quest - People in Darkwater will now react to Derkeethus' absence/return.\n<br />- Derkeethus Quest - Added the ability for talking to the aforementioned people to start his quest.\n<br />- Derkeethus Quest - Derkeethus' house will reflect whether or not he's living in it.\n<br />- Changed Verner's house exterior mesh to match interior layout.\n<br />- Made extensive changes to town layouts, landscape, navmesh and NPC AI *\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/6YjRFRr.png[/img]\n<br />- Added 6 Houses\n<br />- Added 18 new NPCs. \n<br />- Added General Store\n<br />- Added Temple of Dibella\n<br />- Added small camp area for DLC Ferryman.\n<br />- Added seagulls and rats to dock area.\n<br />- Added horse marker for player horse.\n<br />- Added new quest (side): The Burning Queen. \n<br />- Added new quest (side): Blessing the Temple. \n<br />- Added -OPTIONAL- wall around the city. (Can be toggled on / off via MCM or the ETaC Config prompts.)\n<br />- Added a well for drinking water.\n<br />- Added exterior chimneys for houses because fireplaces.\n<br />- Added additional farms, farmers, fishermen, and hunters.\n<br />- Added additional woodcutters; And, NPCs will collect firewood for their houses daily.\n<br />- Added ownership data to all the random exterior items/barrels/etc.\n<br />- Added occulusion planes to houses / walls / etc. for better performance.\n<br />- Added smoke / light to forges and smelters.\n<br />- Fixed covered walkways not using the snow versions.\n<br />- Gave vanilla homeless NPCs homes (Abelone.)\n<br />- Made extensive changes to town layouts, landscape, navmesh and NPC AI *\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/UQcIBQa.png[/img]\n<br />- Added 6 new houses.\n<br />- Added 9 new NPCs. \n<br />- Added new custom dialogue for said NPCs\n<br />- Added new quest (side): A Potion in Time.  \n<br />- Added new quest (side): The Collector Pt. 1.  \n<br />- Added new quest (side): The Collector Pt. 2.  \n<br />- Added new quest (side): The Collector Pt. 3.  \n<br />- Added new quest (side): The Collector Pt. 4.  \n<br />- Added an alchemist store.\n<br />- Added a well for drinking water.\n<br />- Added exterior chimneys for houses because fireplaces.\n<br />- Added additional farms, farmers, fishermen, and hunters.\n<br />- Added additional woodcutters; And, NPCs will collect firewood for their houses daily.\n<br />- Added ownership data to all the random exterior items/barrels/etc.\n<br />- Added occulusion planes to houses / walls / etc. for better performance.\n<br />- Added smoke / light to forges and smelters. \n<br />- Gave vanilla homeless NPCs homes (Embry.)\n<br />- Made extensive changes to town layouts, landscape, navmesh and NPC AI *\n<br />\n<br />[i]* People now do a bunch of things beyond standing around and eating bread, om nom nom.)[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center] [img]https://i.imgur.com/97owoe2.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/LSXyMT7.png[/img]\n<br />New ETaC will do what it should always have done, and that is towns and nothing else. There will be no changes to vanilla interiors (to maintain compatibility with any mods that make them, ELFX, and etc.) There will be no changes to vanilla NPCs’ actor records (to maintain compatibility with any character mods that make them), there will be no player houses, or new textures, no unnecessary item additions (no more having to patch leveled lists or for survival, food, weapon, or shop mods.) I won’t be “removing” any vanilla markers or intractable objects (to maintain compatibility with other NPC behavior and/or AI mods, 3DNPCs, Immersive Citizens, etc.). I will be *moving* vanilla objects, but NPCs will still be able to find them, and so I won’t have to patch for them. Woot.\n<br />\n<br />One major change, however, is that New ETaC now [b]requires[/b] you to have all the DLC installed. They've been out long enough that most people should have them by now and Hearthfires and Dragonborn in particular are packed with all kinds of useful assets for this kind of mod.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/h7eUfat.png[/img]\n<br />New ETaC NPCs are going to have a little more depth to them. I’ve added more … “involved,” we’ll call it, AI packages, to make the towns and their inhabitants feel a little livelier. They’ll each have varying daily routines, new dialogue, some of them will have new side quests (which will conform with Skyrim’s side quests - no major quests.) They’ll have some more back story, and will react to your action in the rest of the world, to the weather, they’ll be a least a little bit more human, and slightly less like cardboard cutouts. Or at least that’s the goal lol. \n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/HJnOaV4.png[/img]\n<br />I will still be offering Complete and Modular versions of the ETaC files. I will also include version with and without a MCM menu, and versions with and without the added quests in case you hate new things. Which is fine. No judgment.\n<br />\n<br />And lastly, and maybe most importantly… \n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/r0rbpr0.png[/img]\n<br />I’m still who I’ve always been and my particular aesthetic remains largely unchanged. So it’s likely the new ETaC towns will still have the same sort of visual as the old ETaC towns. But I am trying to build things in a slightly more streamlined way. Stuff that would make sense, is practical, and is slightly less of a resource hog than it was in previous versions. So think original ETaC just reigned in a little bit. Some towns will still have unique buildings (I do still plan on adding a bakery to Dragon Bridge – And hey! With Hearthfires, I don’t even need to add new bakery items. I have them already. Hooray! - but I wouldn’t expect to see Dragon Bridge South making a comeback.) although the goal overall is to give them more of a vanilla-feel than might have been in the case in the old mod. \n<br />\n<br />Yep. Ok. I’ve rambled on enough to that end, you get the general idea I think. SO. Moving on. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/6M0CUjW.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Everything you'll ever to need to know about compatibility can be found over on the “Forums” tab under “Compatibility.”[/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/wSeE5Nu.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Everything you'll ever to need to know about compatibility can be found over on the “Forums” tab under “Troubleshooting.”\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTE --- IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING THE \"FLOATING GRASS BUG\" ... \n<br />This is NOT a problem with this mod specifically, and is instead an issue with grass textures not updating correctly.  \n<br />You can fix it by following [url=https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Floating_Grass_Fix]these steps[/url].[/i][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/RCt41h0.png[/img][/center]\n<br />#01: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16625]Teddybears[/url] by Tamira.\n<br />#02: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17717]Bakery (and Kabob) Food Meshes[/url] by Jukkz.\n<br />#03: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14133]Food &amp; Alchemy Storage Meshes[/url] by Blary.\n<br />#04: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14135]Book Set Meshes[/url] by Blary.\n<br />#05: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/43204/?]New Solitude House Meshes[/url] by Ga-Knomboe Boy.\n<br />#06: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4721]Dwemeri Font[/url] by Alathan.\n<br />#07: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16525]Whole Ton Of Stuff[/url] by Oaristys and Tony6.\n<br />#08: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37113/?]Better Book Mesh[/url] by DanielCoffey.\n<br />#09: [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1605-open-books-library/]Open Books Resource[/url] by stoverjm.\n<br />#10: [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/profile/378-insanitysorrow/&amp;tab=node_downloads_Files]A Truly Ridiculous Amount of Stuff[/url] by InsanitySorrow.\n<br />#11: [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/topic/5441-development-journal/]Cookies[/url] by Metallicow.\n<br />#12: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/549822/?tb=mods&amp;pUp=1]Alcohol Storage[/url] by Corpsehatch.\n<br />#13: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15854]Mudcrab in a Jar[/url] by badgremlin.\n<br />#14: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22110]Rounded Lanterns[/url] by MannyGT.\n<br />#15: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26132/?]Water Pump[/url] by Runspect.\n<br />#16: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17303/?]Rugs Resource[/url] by yourenotsupposedtobeinhere.\n<br />#17: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30599/?]Alchemy Clutter Resource[/url] by Blary.\n<br />#18: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30600/?]Ingredients Drawer Resource[/url] by Blary.\n<br />#19: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/776954/?tb=mods&amp;pUp=1]Whole Ton of Stuff[/url] by Stroti and Tamira.\n<br />#20: [url=http://artbysebastianschulz.com/]COMPLETELY AWESOME Mead Bottles[/url] by Sebastian Schulz.\n<br />#22: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30602/?]Ingredients Wall Art Resource[/url] by Blary.\n<br />#23: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59977/?]Phitt's Morrowind Style Lanterns[/url] by Phitt and Tamira.\n<br />#24: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59578/?]Mr. Siika Seagulls[/url] by mr_siika and Tamira.\n<br />#25: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59602/?]Mr. Siika Ravens[/url] by mr_siika and Tamira.\n<br />#26: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59426/?]Cyrodiil Ship and Boat Resource[/url] by Markus Liberty.\n<br />#27: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20911/?]Seadog Pirate Armor[/url] by hothtrooper44. *\n<br />\n<br />* [i]Actor use only.
