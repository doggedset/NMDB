  "summary": "Makes Dawnbreaker a real legendary sword. It became bigger, it\\'s damage was put in a line with a top tier swords, it\\'s enchantment now even better, but keeps original idea. If you are the warrior of the light, then this is essential weapon for you.",
  "descriptionHtml": "ATTENTION! Dawnguard DLC REQUIRED for All-in-One version!\r\n\r\nPlease check my other themed mod here: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32842]Meridia\\'s Light[/url]\r\n\r\nPLEASE ENDORSE if you like it! :)\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought that your Dawnbreaker is too small for the legendary sword? How warrior of the light even going to fight with such a tiny thing? If you thought about this, then you\\'ve come to the right place!\r\n\r\n[b]Description:[/b]\r\nSword became bigger. It\\'s base damage increased up to 15. Sword draws energy from the Sun (no need to recharge it) and cause sun damage ONLY to undead. Meridia hate only undead after all. Enchantment was redone with new Sun spells including explosion. Starting from v3.2 there is alternate version without explosion and with turn to ashes on death effect (only undead).\r\n\r\nDon\\'t like new enchantment? Fear not! You can use MESH module ONLY and combine it with any STATs and Texture mod of your personal taste.\r\nAlso this mod does NOT contain sword textures. If you want them you can use this for instance: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30291]Noldorian Dawnbreaker[/url]\r\nIt\\'s the best current texture mod for this sword if you ask me.\r\n\r\n[b]Compatibility:[/b]\r\nMesh module is compatible with any mods except those with Dawnbreaker meshes. So, if you want to use my mod you need to overwrite during installation.\r\nOptional positioning module is NOT compatible with any mod that edits or adds custom skeletons.\r\nOptional .esp module in NOT compatible with any mod that modifies Dawnbreaker\\'s stats. Also you NEED DAWNGUARD dlc for this module!\r\n\r\n[b]Troubleshooting:[/b]\r\nIf you experience any type of problems with this mod you need to know that you have them not from this mod directly, but maybe from some kind of incompatibility with your other mod. Try to use modular version and to enable/disable each module to find the conflicting one. After that please make a post about what module cased your problems and I\\'ll investigate why this happen and do my best to eliminate the problem.\r\n\r\n[b]Installation:[/b]\r\nUse NMM!\r\n\r\n[b]Load order:[/b]\r\nTo ensure nothing will override this mod, put it last in your load order. It will not alter anything, but Dawnbreaker sword! But if you\\'ll put it in the other place, then other mods could override this one and we don\\'t want this. Do we?\r\n\r\n[b]Notes:[/b]\r\nBasic module of this mod contains mesh ONLY! If you want better stats, use optional .esp module or any .esp at your choise. If you want better textures you need additional texture mod. I use this one: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30291 (Noldorian Dawnbreaker)\r\nWeapon positioning was adjusted to \\\"SPOA Silver Knight Armor\\\" set so it may and will cause clipping with some armor types. Also it is NOT compatible with any mod which edits or adds custom skeletons.\r\n\r\n[b]Credits:[/b]\r\nPersonal credits to Ekseth for his \\\"Dawnguard Dawnbreaker\\\" mod, as I was inspired by his creation.\r\nI\\'ve mainly took his idea on upgrading sword with new Sun spells from Dawnguard DLC.\r\n\r\nFor better blood decals this mod is essential to have: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/60]Enhanced Blood Textures[/url]\r\n\r\nArmor on screens is [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32275]SPOA Silver Knight Armor[/url]",
