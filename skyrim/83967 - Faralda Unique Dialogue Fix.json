  "descriptionHtml": "Usually after you open the Time Wound, TLD gets a new dialogue with Faralda at the bridge leading up to the College of Winterhold if they haven&#39;t already joined the College. When she tests you on your magical abilities, you can say &#34;I&#39;m the Dragonborn&#34;, and she&#39;ll let you pass. That dialogue is now unlocked much earlier, as soon as &#34;Way of the Voice&#34; is completed.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />This is really simple. Just drag and drop as with most other .esp files.",
