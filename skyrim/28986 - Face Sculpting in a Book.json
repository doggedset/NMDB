  "descriptionHtml": "A simple book you can get at the Riverwood Trader created to allow the player to be able to do face sculpting anywhere. To make it a little more realistic I added a few required items to be able to sculpt. Face Sculpting takes:\r\n\r\n1 Set of Torture tools\r\n2 Health Potions\r\n1 Troll Fat\r\n1 Bonemeal\r\n\r\nAll these items have also been added to the Riverwood Traders Store content, so when his store respawns its items they will all be back in his inventory, they are pretty common items through skyrim though so you\\'ll be able to find them anywhere.\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\nVersion 1.0.2 Changes\r\n===========================================================\r\nAdded Alternate locations the book can be found rather then buying it.\r\nRadient Raiment on a bookshelf.\r\nDawnstars Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary in the Torture Chamber\r\nThe Abandoned Prison on a book self\r\n\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\nVersion 1.0.3 Changes:\r\n===========================================================\r\nThe book will now inform you to why you do not have access to the face sculpting menu, If your a werewolf, vampire or lack the ingredients to perform it.\r\n\r\nThe book will also let you choose if you want to perform the face sculpting or not, in case of acidental menu clicks and when picking the book up off the ground (sense by default that reads the book).\r\n\r\nVampires and Werewolves also can not use face sculpting, it causes problems with thier race abilities for some reason, so just like the sculptor in the rataway, you can\\'t do it if you are a werewolf or vampire.\r\n===========================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nHope some of you find this useful, I needed it so rather then waiting for someone to come out with it, I created it myself. \r\n\r\nThis Doesn\\'t require any DLC for it, but you should have the latest version of Skyrim installed.\r\n\r\nTested on version 1.8.151.0.7 of Skyrim\r\n\r\nHistory:\r\nver 1.0.1 - fixed some spelling, lowered pricing of book to counter merchant markup.\r\nver 1.0.2 - Added Alternative spots to find book.\r\nver 1.0.3 - Added Prompts to book.",
