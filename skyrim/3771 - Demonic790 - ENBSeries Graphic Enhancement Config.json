  "descriptionHtml": "PLEASE NOTE:\r\n-This is not my mod!I have simply edited the files to obtain the look that I wanted. ALL CREDITS go to Boris Vorontsov for the ENB Series Graphic Enhancement.  \r\n\r\n-There are a few mods used in the pictures with the inclusion of this mod. Anything different you see, such as the clouds, the trees, the textures, etc, are from various mods found around the site and in no way belong to or were created by me.\r\n\r\nA new adjustment created with the ENBSeries Graphic Enhancement.  This graphics enhancement is so ridiculously crazy that I am literally finding myself stopping every second to look at how jaw-dropping the graphics have become.  I have aimed to offer the highest possible image quality with the lowest cost of performance.  Hopefully you see the beauty!  It truly is breathtaking.  \r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n1. Download the file\r\n2. Open the .RAR\r\n3. Extract all files into your main Skyrim directory\r\n(program files>steam>steamapps>common>Skyrim)\r\n4. Enjoy\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS:\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please refer to the ENBSeries Graphic Enhancement mod found here:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2971  \r\n\r\nENJOY!",
