  "descriptionHtml": "Clean game saves everywhere along the main quest. I saved 36 times as I played the game, in various significant places. I completely uninstalled Skyrim, and Nexus Mod manager, and deleted EVERYTHING that was related to them, including all files on my computer they put there. I then reinstalled Skyrim, and did the Main Quest only. I used a one-handed sword and Heavy Armor (Imperial). I also used the healing power, which raised my restoration. I did not loot anyone or anything (unless I had to for the quest), and tried as hard as I could to avoid starting any other quests. \r\nDragon Bones and Scales I collected are in the chest in front of Sky Haven Temple.\r\nThe Negotiations were:\r\nRiften goes to Imperials, Markarth goes to Stormcloaks. Ulfric pays for Karthwasten.\r\nHere is a list of the game saves:\r\n001: After the Cartride to Helgen\r\n002: Before the Western Watchtower\r\n003: On the 7,000 Steps\r\n004: Before the Troll fight on the 7K Steps\r\n005: After the Troll fight\r\n006: High Hrothgar\r\n007: After Ustengrav\r\n008: Giving the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller (Final Trial for Greybeards)\r\n009: After the Greybeard greeting (being officially Dragonborn)\r\n010: Before the Thalmor Embassy\r\n011: After Thalmor Embassy\r\n012: After Esbern\r\n013: Before Sky Haven Temple\r\n014: Alduin\\\\\\'s Wall\r\n015: Before meeting Paarthunax (Learned Clear Skies Shout)\r\n016: Before Alftand\r\n017: Before the Dwarven Centurion at Alftand\r\n018: After the Dwarven Centurion\r\n019: Blackreach\r\n020: Tower of Mzark - After Blackreach (Before using the Lexicon)\r\n021: Before Elder Scroll (after doing the Lexicon puzzle)\r\n022: After Elder Scroll\r\n023: After Using Elder Scroll/Before 1st Alduin Fight\r\n024: After 1st Alduin Fight\r\n025: Before the Peace Council (Negotiations)\r\n026: After the Peace Council\r\n027: Captured Odahviing\r\n028: Arrived at Skuldafn\r\n029: Before Entering Skuldafn Temple\r\n030: After Using Diamond Claw\r\n031: Before Entering Sovngarde\r\n032: After entering Savngarde\r\n033: Hall of Valor\r\n034: Before fighting Alduin\r\n035: After defeating Alduin\r\n036: Everything Complete - Throat of the World (After the dragons are gone)\r\n\r\nThe character is a nord, level 1. I did not level up, so you can go to the level up screen, and add Health/Stamina/Magicka as you please, and choose any perks you want. The only setting I changed was to put the game on Novice difficulty (It\\\\\\'s hard when you can\\\\\\'t level up). Everything else is the same. No mods or console commands used, and did not buy or sell anything.\r\nAnd there you have it. Hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nYou may do anything you want with the file, or use it in any mods, no need to ask my permission or credit me.",
