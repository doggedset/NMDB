  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=5]WINDHELM&#39;S ANCIENT LIGHTHOUSE Version 1.0[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=2]By Mr. C. Racer[/size][/center]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59608/?]Traducción española\r<br />[/url] Last year, MannyGT released his &#34;Windhelm Lighthouse&#34; mod, but, though well done, it used the Solitude lighthouse model, which doesn&#39;t really fit with Windhelm&#39;s aeshetics. So I decided to make a new lighthouse more fitting for Ysgramor&#39;s city, and this is the result. \r<br />\r<br />  The mod includes:\r<br />\r<br />- Kyne&#39;s Beacon: Windhelm&#39;s lighthouse, located near the mouth of the White River.\r<br />- A new NPC, Sjorn of Windhelm: the caretaker, with his own schedule and a few lines of dialogue that change depending on your character&#39;s race.\r<br />- Nothing inside the lighthouse is owned, and the chest is set to &#34;no respawn&#34;, so it can be used as temporary home. Of course, you&#39;d have to kill Sjorn for that, and only a bad person would do it. And you&#39;re not a bad person, [i]right[/i]?\r<br />\r<br />-------------------\r<br />REQUIREMENTS\r<br />-------------------\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14884/?]Fuz Ro D-oh - Silent Voice[/url] by shadeMe, if you want to be able to read the new dialogue. Honestly, Bethesda, when are you going to give us the option to set the amount of seconds a text stays on screen when there&#39;s no voiced dialogue?\r<br />\r<br />-----------------\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />-----------------\r<br />\r<br />  Unzip all the files and drop them on your Skyrim/Data folder, overwriting if asked, and activate the plugin in the Skyrim launcher. The file has been fully cleaned with TES5Edit 3.0.32.\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------\r<br />BUGS / THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND\r<br />----------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />- Pieces of the lighthouse, or the entire building, disappear as you move away from it. The reason is the lack of LOD model.\r<br />- You can&#39;t reach the top of the lighthouse. There was problems with the navmesh.\r<br />\r<br />----------\r<br />HISTORY\r<br />----------\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0: First version.\r<br />\r<br />----------\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />----------\r<br />\r<br />- Everything: Mr. C. Racer\r<br />\r<br />--------------\r<br />THANKS TO\r<br />--------------\r<br />\r<br />- MannyGT for inspiration.\r<br />- The people at the official TES forums for help with Sjorn&#39;s dialogue.\r<br />- The TES5Edit team.\r<br />- Bethesda.",
