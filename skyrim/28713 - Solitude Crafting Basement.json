  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes it easier for you to craft and organize your items in the basement of your house in Solitude! It\\'s annoying to store everything in one chest, and usually you don\\'t find many chests in one location. I\\'ve added several chests to the basement where you can craft and not have to move around too much.\r\n\r\nThis mod was originally made for myself, but I thought I\\'d share and give something back to the community.\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\n+ Storage units for each crafting post.\r\n+ Static soulgem lights.\r\n+ Display cases.\r\n+ Smithy crafting stations.\r\n+ Four extra chests for those in need.\r\n+ Warm carpets for your cold feet.\r\n\r\nRemoved:\r\n- Cobweb from all over the house.\r\n- Clutter that nobody needs or uses.\r\n- Small fire in alchemy area.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n-SirMagus",
