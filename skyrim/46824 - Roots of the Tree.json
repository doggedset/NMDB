  "descriptionHtml": "\"Vainly on beech and oak I knock\r\nAmid the silent boughs;\r\nThen hear her laughter,\r\nThe moment after,\r\nMaking of me her laughing-stock\r\nWithin her hidden house.\"\r\n - Richard Le Gallienne\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod was made especially with \"The Dryad\" ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21458//? )  in mind.\r\nThis is not required but i recomend it, awesome race mod!\r\nI didn't find any of the other treehouse-mods to be what i wanted from a dryads den and why on earth would a treespirit live in a house? Made from wood?\r\nI wanted something simple that felt more like the dwelling of a spirit than a furnished house.\r\n\r\nSo i created this, my first ever mod.\r\n\r\nWhat does it do?\r\nThe mod adds a simple player home under the roots of a big tree in Autumnshade Clearing, northwest of Riften.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\nGo there, kill the critters/hunters there and find the tree.\r\nYou wont miss it.\r\nBetween some rocks a door is nestled that leads to the Roots of the Tree.\r\n\r\nFeatures?\r\nNot many.\r\nA bedroll, a tanning rack, a hollowed out rock next to the bedroll for keeping stuff in.\r\nSome baskets filled with fruit and veg, a buttload of butterflies and a lot of herbs.\r\nGlowing mini-version of the big home tree. \r\nSkulls of men lie strewn about, don't you bring an axe to her home tree!\r\n\r\nMod as you like!\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nI added a second version with a waterfall and spring.\r\nI'm still feeling that the upper level is missing something but i can't figure out what.\r\n\r\n",
