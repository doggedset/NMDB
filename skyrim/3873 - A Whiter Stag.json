  "descriptionHtml": "Frankly, I didn\\'t think the White Stag quite lived up to his name. This retexture cleans up his markings and lightens his coat to a pure, uniform white. In the sunlight he tends to \\\"glow\\\" since he\\'s so light-colored, but I thought it went well with him being a unique, somewhat magical sort of creature.\r\n\r\nThe screenshots don\\'t do him justice--to see him in-game, use the console command \\\"player.placeatme 00104F46\\\", or do the quest Ill Met By Moonlight in Falkreath. :)\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, simply delete the texture and he should revert back to his vanilla texture.",
