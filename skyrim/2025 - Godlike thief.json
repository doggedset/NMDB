  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first upload, I hope to actually add this to an item once the creation kit comes out, as my first mod.\r\n\r\nIt deactivates AI detection while you\\'re sneaking, meaning, while you\\'re sneaking, NPCs and Enemies will NOT see you. Ever. Even if you\\'re right in \r\n\r\nfront of them in broad daylight.\r\n\r\nIt also sets your pickpocket probability to 100% all the time. your pickpocket attempts will always be successful.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\\'t alter your stats or perks in any way, so if you want to play without it, you can simply reload the game and continue without issue. You can grind your stealth and pickpocket skills this way.\r\n\r\nInstructions are in the readme.",
