  "modName": "Convert Arrows Into Assassins Equipment",
  "summary": "If you use The Dark Brotherhood Armor TS Edition by TS, then you probably agree that the Assassin\\'s Equipment is one of the coolest features, besides the retextured armor itself. But my oh my, wish they did more that 10 damage? This plugin allows you to convert any vanilla arrow into Assassin\\'s Equipment, keeping the original arrows value and dmg",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is not a standalone mod. This is just a plugin that allows conversion of arrows into Assassin\\'s Equipment (heavy version) from The Dark Brotherhood Armor TS Edition by TS. This plugin is very small, the only info it contains are the recipes and the converted items\r\n\r\n[color=red]REQUIRED MOD:[/color]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6249]The Dark Brotherhood Armor TS Edition by TS[/url]\r\n\r\n[color=red]DAWNGUARD IS REQUIRED FOR v1.1 \\\"AE Conversion_Dawnguard.esp\\\"\r\nIf you do not have Dawnguard, make sure you download v1.1 \\\"AE Conversion.esp\\\"[/color]\r\n\r\nConversion is done at a tanning rack, to avoid smithing skill gains. Currently, conversions are done in 5\\'s. (5 Daedric arrows can be converted into 5 Assassin\\'s Equipment)\r\n\r\nAll arrows converted retain their damage and value, and type of arrow is noted. Ingame it looks like:\r\nAssassin\\'s Equipment (Daedric) (#) -See uploaded pictures.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nIn keeping the integrity of the original mod, the original Assassin\\'s Equipment recipe can still be seen at the forge. I did not remove anything from the original mod\r\n\r\nDidn\\'t bother making conversions for the light version of Assassin\\'s Equipment. (Does anyone really prefer the light version?)\r\n\r\nThe only way I was able to make these arrows spin with  Archery - Spinning Arrows by Palistov, was to assign the projectile model with the Nord Hero Arrow model. This is the closest looking arrow to the type displayed on the Assassin\\'s Equipment. (Which looks very similar)\r\n\r\nThis only affects the arrow\\'s appearance in flight, and how it\\'s displayed loose in the world out of an inventory or container. When the arrows are moused over, they will say something like \\'NordHeroArrowProjectile\\', but fear not. Once they are looted they are back to being Assassin\\'s Equipment. And no, this does not turn every static Nord Hero Arrow into Assassin\\'s Equipment.\r\n\r\nFinal note, this was all done in the Creation Kit with basic knowledge of modding. If anyone wants to further improve upon my goals here, feel free to do so.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there are any issues. Enjoy! \r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED MODS: \r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29086]Archery - Spinning Arrows by Palistov[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16438]Bandolier - Bags and Pouches by Dragten\r\n[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9717]Better Vampires by Brehanin 6-1 by Brehanin\r\n[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22274]Predator Vision - Vampire Werewolf and Khajiit by Gopher\r\n[/url]",
