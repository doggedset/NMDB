Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />I have always been enthralled by ancient Norse mythology, so when I came across a [url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14726]public domain[/url] copy of the Younger Eddas of Snorre Sturleson, and after having gawked in amazement at the glorious [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35094/?]Aesir Armor[/url], I just knew I had to put some of them in Skyrim. I also have been having a horrible migraine for several days, so this helped distract me. I&#39;m weird like that.\r<br />\r<br />But enough of that - there is a grand total of 10 books, which are in a chest somewhere in the Haafingar hold. In one of the screenshots you can see the general area where you can find them - just stick to the main road. One of the screenshots shows how great the books look when placed in order in a bookshelf - very colorful&#33;\r<br />\r<br />As you may imagine, some chapters are quite long and they could get annoying to read in-game, so I took the liberty of summarizing them a bit, editing some things for clarification and merging some tales I personally like here and there. Feel free to read the public domain copy of the Younger Eddas if you feel thirsty for more.\r<br />\r<br />These are the books I added:\r<br />[i]- Of The Formation Of The World\r<br />- Of Night And Day\r<br />- Of The Sun And Moon\r<br />- Of The Wind And The Seasons\r<br />- Of The Gods\r<br />- Of The Goddesses\r<br />- Of The Origin of Poetry\r<br />- Of The Joys Of Valhalla\r<br />- Of Ragnarok, Or The Twilight Of The Gods\r<br />- The Renovation Of The Universe[/i]\r<br />\r<br />I am not planning on adding any more books, although if there&#39;s a massive demand, I could add some more - if you have a particular tale or fact you are interested in, let me know and I&#39;ll see what I can do. To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. \r<br />\r<br />The beautiful covers for the books come from Axhoff&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12884/? ]Book Covers Resource[/url]. The Elder Eddas of Saemund Sigfusson; and the Younger Eddas of Snorre Sturleson, in the public domain, can be read at [url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14726]Project Gutenberg[/url]. And last but not least, Ouroboros design Â© [url=http://saki-blackwing.deviantart.com/art/ouroboros-17479771]Saki-Blackwing[/url].
