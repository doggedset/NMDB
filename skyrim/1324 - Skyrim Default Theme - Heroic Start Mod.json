  "descriptionHtml": "Tired of waiting at the main screen to get to the epic parts of Skyrim\\'s amazing theme music?  Well fret no more!  Start your gaming session right as the sons and daughters of Skyrim chant you on to glory.\r\n\r\nThis simple mod edits the game\\'s default theme music so it starts right in the thick of it.  I\\'ve simply shifted the preceding part to the end, so it will still loop properly if that\\'s of any concern.\r\n\r\nI primarily made this for myself, but figured other people may like it, so here it is.\r\nI\\'ve uploaded the starting portion to YouTube, so you can have a try before you download.\r\n\r\nPreview:  http://youtu.be/fPb1SUD8kyQ\r\n\r\nEnjoy!  :)",
