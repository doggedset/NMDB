  "descriptionHtml": "Perhaps the baddest Orc you could ever get..... Malacath!\r\n\r\nThis is a simple companion of a unique over the top Orc guy who is my interperation of Malacath from mimicing the Daedric Shrine of Malacath.\r\n\r\nI am sorry about the gray face bug, Its a problem I have heard that alot of people also suffer from. How do I fix this?\r\n\r\nHis weapon of choice is an over powered Ebony blade I called Malacath\\'s cleaver and his outfit is bandit topless fur armor.\r\n\r\nI also mixed and matched non replacer horns and brow horns from the various races to try and add that Daedric feel.\r\n\r\nI noticed Malacath looks like Mehrunes Dagon\\'s little brother.\r\n\r\nHe is over powered, aggresive and is your ally regardless your situation. \r\n\r\nHe can be found at Dushnikh Yal near a Malacath shrine.",
