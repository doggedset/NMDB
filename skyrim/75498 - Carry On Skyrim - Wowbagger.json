He won&#39;t become available until he&#39;s ticked off his list.\r<br />\r<br />Note: Maven is his first victim, so she needs to be at the Bee and Barb for the whole quest to initiate. \r<br />\r<br />[b][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/75498-0-1462661810.gif[/img][/b]\r<br />\r<br />With your favourite mod installer in hand, installation is as easy as flying. All you need do is forget to fall. \r<br />Luckily those boffins at the Nexus & Mod Organizer headquarters have made it really easy for you, which is fortunate because nobody likes the ground when it&#39;s trying to hit them.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/75498-4-1462661665.gif[/img][color=#ff0000][size=4][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Wowbagger uses scenes to insult certain game npcs. This all works well, unless the npc in question happens to be already in one of their own scenes. Although, this isn&#39;t game breaking... it just means that sometimes you might need to wait around a while before his target is free to be insulted.\r<br />\r<br />Additionally, if a particular npc is no longer in default locations due to main story quest or because you have disposed of them like MXR on a drunken rampage...\r<br />Then you will have to advance the quest via console. If this is the case, please refer to the walk through posted on the forum tab. \r<br />\r<br />I also recommend browsing the posts too for additional information. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=4][b][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/75498-1-1462661666.gif[/img][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Huge thank you to my fellow modders for jumping in and sorting out my textures.

In regards to companions in general; \r<br />I made the decision that this time around I would make him summon-able, rather than constant. Hopefully, this will keep him fresh. I also made the decision to make him a little less interactive than any of previous creations. In regards to further develop, other than fixing and bugs that may appear, I do have a very small idea to make him MCM menu functional, and add selectable &#34;mild &#34; to &#34;really rude&#34; dialogue. But we&#39;ll see if the muse bites.[/center]\r<br />[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/75498-0-1462737183.gif[/img]\r<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61016/?]Carry On Skyrim: M.H.A.R.P.H.I.N.[/url] (Now version 2.
