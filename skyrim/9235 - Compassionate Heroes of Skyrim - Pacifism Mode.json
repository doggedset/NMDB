  "summary": "Complete tasks for strangers without resorting to violence. You know, like a productive member of society or something.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Being the Hero of Skyrim is demanding work, but do you really need to sacrifice your sense of moral superiority just\r\nfor the sake of lowly peasants? Surely a smart dovahkiin like you can find a way to settle your conflicts with words,\r\nlike a grown-up. Let\\'s try the Way of the Indoor Voice, shall we?\r\n\r\nThis mod makes some minor tweaks to the world so that most quests can more easily be completed without killing anybody.\r\nI strive to make the smallest changes possible to meet that goal. Quest objectives that ask you to kill people won\\'t be\r\nchanged, however. And I\\'m not touching the Dark Brotherhood with a six foot broom.\r\n\r\nI\\'m fixing things as I discover them, so if you find a quest that needs work, let me know.\r\n\r\nUpcoming Features\r\n---------------------------\r\n+ Tweak Missing in Action, Under Saarthal, and House of Horrors to have pacifist-friendly resolutions\r\n+ Add a secondary mod component which makes bigger, changes to make playing a pacifist more friendly\r\n+ Add a method to obtain dragon souls without killing dragons\r\n\r\nVersion 0.9\r\n---------------\r\n+ Changed \\\"Key Required\\\" to \\\"Master\\\" on locked doors in Fellglow Keep for The Caller fight in Hitting The Books\r\n+ Made it possible to pickpocket Dragonstone from the Draugr boss in Bleak Falls Barrows\r\n+ Made it possible to pickpocket Diamond Claw from the Draugr boss in Skuldafn Temple for The World-Eater\\'s Eyrie",
