Introduction\r<br />2: Installation\r<br />3. Version History\r<br />\r<br />===============\r<br />1. INTRODUCTION\r<br />===============\r<br />\r<br />Nordic ruin totem puzzles.  They consist of matching up a key of some sort somewhere (visual, book, etc) to a selection of nine ancient nordic totems that are surmised (by the BGSF Lore Forumites) to correspond to the ancient nordic gods.\r<br />\r<br />Among them, the Snake (Shor), the Whale (Tsun), the Hawk (Kyne), the Moth (Dibella), the Bear (Stuhn), the Owl (Jhunal), the Fox (Ysmir), the Wolf (Mara), and the Dragon (Alduin).\r<br />\r<br />But the most prevalent totem puzzle, the Rotating Pillars... only uses the Hawk, Snake, and Whale.  Where are the other six?  This mod rectifies that, and intersperses the new pillars amongst all the puzzle pillar arrays.\r<br />\r<br />Naturally, I also replaced any pertinent puzzle keys.  I did not touch two particular puzzle arrays as their keys were in book text, and the context would be broken.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />===============\r<br />2. INSTALLATION\r<br />===============\r<br />\r<br />Unpack the ESP module and the Meshes folder into your SkyrimData folder.  Activate the ESP module &#34;MissingTotemPuzzlePillars.esp&#34; using the mod manager of your choice.\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t foresee any incompatibilities with anything short of another mod that does the very same thing as mine.  No textures are packed, they&#39;ll use whatever existing textures you have loaded.\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />3. VERSION HISTORY\r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />v1: \r<br />Initial Release.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />====================\r<br />4. USAGE PERMISSIONS\r<br />====================\r<br />\r<br />These are available as a mod resource.  You have permission, but you must notify me of your use.\r<br />\r<br />I didn&#39;t touch any scripts (neither the source or the shell property variables), it was just a form copy/mesh redirect and a lot of Find/Replace work in the scene render window.",
