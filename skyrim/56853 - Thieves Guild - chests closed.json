  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][u]DESCRIPTION[/u][/size]\r<br />A simple mod that closes the chests in the Thieves Guild&#39;s vaults (Cistern area, not the Ratway vaults, mind you.). The chests won&#39;t respawn, which means you can safely store your stolen loot or whatever it is you want to store.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u]INSTALLATION\r<br />[/u][/size]You can install it via NMM or just put the file in your Skyrim/Data\r<br />[u]UNINSTALL\r<br />[/u]Uninstall via NNM or simply delete the file\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u]ISSUES/COMPATIBILITY\r<br />[/u][/size]There shouldn&#39;t be any issues, I just replaced the open static chests inside the vaults with the closed container ones.\r<br />No DLC or anything else needed to run this.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=3]ANYTHING ELSE?\r<br />[/size][/u]I&#39;m honestly not sure if this already exists on the Nexus, but I uploaded this on the Workshop maybe 2 years ago. Here is the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=90047392]Steam Workshop version[/url]ï»¿.\r<br />I might make a follower mod of my Skyrim character later.",
