  "summary": "[[see: NEW PICTURES!!!]]a pretty follower for your bosmeri carracter. She is a fine Marksman, and the perfect follower for the archer-type of player.",
  "descriptionHtml": "If someone wish her to have brown or green eyes, the only thing you need is to leave a comment... I will customize at request, just ask!\r\n\r\nHer name is Limwen Aerahlanmyr, and she would currently be located at the Dead man\\'s drink, the Inn of Falkreath. (I know you can see a male elf there too, but that is me, and is not included in the .esp file).\r\n\r\nThis NPC is only made for my use only, i will edit at request, and I am having this uploaded for reasons of display.\r\n\r\nAt the time, when you have downloaded the file, installed it and found her, she will either: a) be naked or b) have a set of scout-armor equiped. ยง She will only have the curiass, gauntlets and boots equiped. The scout-armor pack is required to make her use it, see the download links.[[remember: the scout armor is alot buggy, and it\\'s a 90% chance that she\\'l have it equipped, but the armor being invisible. After you get the DragonSmithingPerk you can make the armor(steel for weapons), then you will choose the lover one, with the lover stats (theese are the only one\\'s working).]] \r\n\r\nAnd to not forget, she is using a nightingale bow, it isn\\'t the best bow at high levels, thus it would be smart to upgrade it a little, just leave a comment if u can\\'t mod it yourself, and i will upload an other esp.\r\nShe is also using some different facetextures, see the links.\r\n\r\nI would like to thank FalmerBane for the base of the NPC and alot of inspiration, here is a link to his masterpiece, and download that aswell if you liked this one, he is the best one at making NPC\\'s so be sure to follow him. (lol, see dowload linx)\r\n\r\nI will not make more NPC\\'s, but i will update this one, at request, just remember to leave a comment, if you like what you see, but want something fixed.  ( I may make an other NPC but not for a looooong time, I need to get sick of this beauty first!)\r\n\r\nIf you like my work, i can make an NPC for you, but give detailed info if you have any meanings of her/his appearence.\r\n\r\nDownload linx:\r\nRequired:!!!:\r\n-http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812 (bella\\'s better faces, nr 1)\r\n-http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6554(CBBEv3 with Navetseas CBBEv3 body texture (feminine arms and toned abs)\r\n-http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168(ApachiiSkyHair)\r\n-http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3566(eye fix)\r\n\r\n\r\n-http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7109 (scout armor, highly recommended)\r\n-http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14805(to match the color of the NG-Bow)\r\n\r\n-http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16775#content \r\n(the base of the NPC, just look at this one too, she is good work!)",
