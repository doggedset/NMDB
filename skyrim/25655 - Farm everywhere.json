  "descriptionHtml": "Farm everywhere.\r\nThis mod creates fertile soil spots for planting much like farming in Hearthfire. \r\n\r\nSupports all the plants from Heartfire planting pluss elvesear , frost mirriam, garlic, crimson nirnroot, Jarris root from the dark brotherhood quest.\r\nIt also let you plant eggs for nests, the chicken nest spawn chickens  + spider and  chauus eggs who spawn spiders and  chauus for defense. \r\nFrom Dawnguard the gleamblossom, yellow mountain flower , soul husk and the poison bloom \r\n\r\nTo farm you need an farming hoe, craft one with one iron and one firewood piece on an anvil. \r\n\r\nStand still and do 3-4 basic standing power attacks, you see that you create an mound of fertile soil. \r\nYou can now click on it and select an seed from the list to plant, one is required, if you add more the rest is returned. \r\n\r\nThe mound changes, 24 hours later the plant has grown up, after harvest it uses three days to grow back, \r\nyou do not have to be away for it to grow back. Note you will only get one ingredient not 3-4 like in Hearthfire but you can plant as much as you want. \r\n\r\nAdvanced functions: If you sneak then accessing the empty and unplanted mound you can remove it, you can also move it or rotate it, \r\nthis can be useful then decorating or in hilly terrain. \r\n\r\nAfter planting you cannot move it anymore but you can remove the plant, move and plant another if you sneak. \r\n\r\nYou can also plant various eggs that become nests. Chicken nests have a chance of giving chickens.\r\nSpider and chaurus eggs sacks will produce Spider and chaurus if left in four days. \r\nThey will be friendly to player and other friendly creatures and can be used as guards for Hearthfire homes or other wilderness settlements. \r\nHowever spiders and chaurus are hostile to each other so you cannot have both at one place. \r\n\r\nYou only get one creature from a nest or egg sack but will get a new after the creature dies. \r\n\r\nTips: For speed its best to make multiple mounds then plant them. Then planting in slopes, don\\'t walk up and down the slope but sideways in the hill, \r\nyou might have to move or rotate the mounds anyway for an good looking result. \r\nEmpty mounds disappears after three days, this is planned. \r\n\r\nNote: Do not wait next to the plants for them to regrow, move to another cell. Just waiting does not trigger the script to check if plant is harvested. \r\n\r\nRequire: Hearthfire for plant models and SKSE for scripts.\r\nThe Dawnguard version also require Dawnguard, only use one of the versions.",
