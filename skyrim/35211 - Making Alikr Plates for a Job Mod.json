  "descriptionHtml": "This is another i-don\\\\\\'t-want-to-set-the-world-on-fire-and-kill-everyone mod by me. Basically, what it does is it allows you to make an Alik\\\\\\'r Plate (not plate mail, just plate) that you can sell.\r\n\r\nIt takes some iron, corundum, and firewood to create the plate in a forge. There\\\\\\'s plenty of corundum and iron deposits around whiterun, so early in the game, this is an easy way to make money.\r\n\r\nHere is my Cooking is a Job mod that might be a good match for it, if ever you want a different occupation in the game.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35205\r\n\r\nIs there a way to change the increase in smithing experience? Please teach me how in the comments section. Experience increase seems to be too high for this item.\r\n\r\nPlease make comments useful. If uploading to a different site, please give credit to me, and this site of course.",
