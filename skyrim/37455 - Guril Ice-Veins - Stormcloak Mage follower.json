  "descriptionHtml": "I sat down at my computer one morning, thinking, \\\"wow, there just aren\\'t enough followers on Nexus\\\". So I made a new one. Guril is a standalone, lore friendly companion specializing in Frost magic. \r\n\r\nTo get her to look like my pictures, you need: \r\n\r\nApachiiSky hair (required)\r\nDawnguard (required)\r\nZoners\\' high performance ENB, vanilla mode\r\nAll-in-one face\r\nXenius\\' Character Enhancement\r\nZX eyes\r\nApachiiSky hair - Better Textures\r\n\r\nRace- Nord\r\nSex- Female\r\nMarriable- Yes\r\nLevel- Starts at 10, up to 81\r\nLocation- Candlehearth Hall\r\nCombat Style- Mage\r\nSpells- Ice spike, Frostbite, Lesser Ward\r\nShouts- Ice form, Frost Breath\r\nPerks- Light Foot\r\nRequires- ApachiiSkyhair, Dawnguard\r\nBackstory-\r\n\r\nGuril grew up on the streets of Windhelm, begging for spare septims and sleeping on the ground. When the civil war started, she enrolled with the stormcloaks almost immediately, seeing it as a chance to get a warm(ish) bed (I mean c\\'mon, this is Skyrim) and regular pay. Soon after, she was wounded in an ambush and set back to recover in Windhelm. While on leave, she met Wuunferth the Unliving and he quickly started to mentor her on the art of war magic, with Ulfric Stormcloak soon taking interest in this beautiful, intelligent, patriotic Soldier, and deciding to teach her some basic Thu\\'um. And now she follows around the Dovahkiin, smitten with love. Or something like that.\r\n\r\nPlease post your pictures of her in action!",
