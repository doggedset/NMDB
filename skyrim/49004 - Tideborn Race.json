  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first race mod hope you like it and sorry if there is any bugs. I got the ideal for this race from the game perfect world. This race makes excellent assassins. They can breath underwater and once per day become invisible for a little while. They have different skin tones from many other races including each other such as blue, red, purple. \r<br />\r<br />Tideborn\r<br />\r<br />The top of the food chain in their vast ocean domain, the Tideborn have returned after thousands of years of isolation from the mainland.\r<br />\r<br />Life in the deep under tremendous constant physical pressure has made their bodies lithe, yet remarkably strong, making them perfectly suited for acrobatics and other impressive feats requiring precise body control. The quiet isolation inherent to deep sea survival has also given them plenty of time to practice meditation and focus, allowing them to hone their minds to a near supernatural level.",
