  "descriptionHtml": "25/05/2017: This mod is now available for Xbox One for Skyrim SE after kindly being ported by AlpineYJÂ https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4017889\r<br />\r<br />In collaboration with Tyrannicon, I proudly present Throthgar: A Fully Voiced Follower. \r<br />This mod adds the popular character of Throthgar (featured in Tyrannicon&#39;s youtube series of Skyrim vids) as a fully voiced follower to the game, featuring the voice talent of Tyrannicon himself. \r<br />\r<br />PLEASE READ: This mod is designed to be used for a new game. This will ensure that he works as he should do. Also be sure to download the SEQ file.\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll find him in the Sleeping Giant Inn at Riverwood. He is essential and will level with the player. \r<br />\r<br />TROUBLE SHOOTING:\r<br />Make sure you download the SEQ file\r<br />After downloading the mod, wait at the launch screen for the data files to finish updating before starting the game. \r<br />\r<br />If his dialogue doesn&#39;t appear then stand in front of him and quick save then load. \r<br />\r<br />Make sure you have no other followers recruited when you talk to him. If you wish to use him with other followers then I would suggest using AFT: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?\r<br />I&#39;ve tested it myself and he works well with any other followers if you use AFT. Just make sure AFT is below any followers in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />Start a new game to make sure the scripts work as they should. \r<br />\r<br />Make sure you have the latest update for Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />CREDITS: First and foremost, a massive thank you to Tyrannicon for teaming up with me to do this project. It was a lot of fun to do. \r<br />\r<br />Next up a big thank you to Shodan44 for allowing others to use his edit of the Dragonplate helm. It wouldn&#39;t have been Throthgar without his legendary mask. Check it out here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7084/? \r<br />\r<br />Finally, thank you to Nichevo/Deck 16 for his superb tutorial on adding voiced followers to the game.
