INFORMATION ON THE MOD           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod makes it so enemies who yield to you will stop attacking you after that.\r\n\r\n\t   Enemy NPCs who are near death will go into bleedout mode or start fleeing.  If you hear them\r\nmake a comment about yielding, then they will stop attacking you.  When they recover and stand up or stop\r\nfleeing in terror, then they will sheath their weapons and start using a sandbox wander package.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod just effects hostile NPCs, and not all of them.  Some NPCs do not have the dialog to\r\nyield, or do not have the personality to ever yield.  Creatures do not ever yield.\r\n\r\n\t   In most cases, after defeating an enemy in a dungeon, and having him or her yield, you can walk \r\naround and confiscate all his or her valuables that are laying around, and not suffer any consequences.\r\n\r\n\t   If you have been annoyed in the past when enemies give up and beg for mercy, but then attack \r\nyou again a few seconds later, this mod might find a home in your load order.\t    \r\n************************************************************************\r\n2. Installation                           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n           Extract (decompress) the .esp and .bsa to your Skyrim directory.  \r\n(It will be something like *Installation directory*\\\\Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data)\r\nMark the box next to Mercy.esp in your mod manager.\r\n \r\n           Alternately, extract files someplace else.  Then move the .esp and .bsa \r\nto Skyrim\\\\Data.  Mark the box next to the plugin in your mod manager.\r\n************************************************************************\r\n3. Version History    \r\n************************************************************************\r\nV 1.3    7/16/12  Repackaged file in a format that is easier to install and remove.\r\nV 1.2    4/14/12  Worked with an issue where using fear magic would make NPCs permanently yield rather than\r\n\t\t  attacking again when the spell wears off. \r\nV 1.1    4/13/12  Worked with an issue where using fear magic would make NPCs permanently yield rather than\r\n\t\t  attacking again when the spell wears off. \r\nV 1.0    3/2/12   Initial release.   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n4. Conflicts, Known Issues, and Troubleshooting\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod can make the game a little strange.  You might possibly beat a dungeon without killing \r\nvery many people.  Then it will look odd with all of the bad guys wandering around not attacking you.  You \r\nmight start wondering if it is more moral to spare a bandit\\'s life or to kill him, because what if he \r\ndecides to rob someone weaker than you?  But I guess you could role-play and pretend that you made the \r\nbandit swear to stop robbing innocent travelers and only prey on the wicked, like you, the adventurer do. \r\n\r\n\t   The hostile NPCs that yield to you do not have a lot to say.  They wander around the battle \r\narea while you defeat their friends and don\\'t react to it much.  There really isn\\'t much you can do to \r\ninteract with the bad guys who have yielded to you.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod could lower the aggression of really aggressive followers back down to default.\r\n\r\n\t   When you revisit dungeons after clearing them, you may find enemies who yielded to you last time\r\nand who do not attack you or react much to your presence.\r\n\r\n\t   If you accept the yield of a dungeon boss or quest target, you may not clear the dungeon or\r\ncomplete the quest.  You may have to pick a fight with the enemy to continue on.\r\n\r\n\t   Enemies with AI packages and dialog to warn you to keep your distance will stop combat when they \r\nyield, but will attack you again if you stay close to them or go close to them again.\r\n\t   \r\n\t   The edits in quest \\\"Voice Powers,\\\" tab \\\"Misc,\\\" dialog topic \\\"ThrowVoiceLine\\\" are not dirty edits.  \r\nThey had to be made to tighten up slop in the vanilla Skyrim dialog conditions to cover for a situation \r\nwhich the designers had not envisioned:  hostile NPCs no longer being hostile and actually talking.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod needs more play-testing under a broad range of operating conditions for a more extended\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\n\t   If you locate a bug, contact David Brasher on TES Nexus so that the situation can be\r\nexamined and can hopefully be fixed. \r\n************************************************************************\r\n5.
