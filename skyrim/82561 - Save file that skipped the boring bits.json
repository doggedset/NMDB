And no ENB. So pics are dull. \r<br />I have to start all over, but I was sick of starting Skyrim all over , decided to download a save file from Nexus but all the save files online seemed to be the same. Nothing wrong with them but  i was just tired of starting a new game, visiting Riverwood, and doing the same thing. \r<br />\r<br />i was sick of Carlotta  complaining about Mikael?\r<br />Sick of looking for a mammoth tusk.\r<br />Sick of carrying the Golden Claw. think ill go back and steel it, lol.\r<br />Amrens silly sword quest. Isn&#39;t he man enough to get it himself. \r<br />\r<br />In this game I have started the quest In my time of need. \r<br />I found Meridias ball thing in Break of Dawn.\r<br />Started Blessings of Nature, and am off to the Eldergreen.\r<br />I have already smacked Mikael around but if you wanna hit him, then please go ahead .\r<br />I have bought Breezehome, but now im broke.\r<br />\r<br />I am up to the Quest, The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller\r<br />\r<br />If this mod is not to your liking, dont complain to me, and dont download it, no skin off my back. \r<br />Mods used in save\r<br />[/size][size=5]\r<br />[/size][b]REQ-Dawnguard,Hearthfire,Dragonborn and USLEEP[/b]\r<br />The Eyes of beauty\r<br />KS Hairs\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][size=4]True brows[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][size=4]I have Xanthy&#39;s asa follower because he is cool.
