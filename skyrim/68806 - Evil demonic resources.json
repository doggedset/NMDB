  "descriptionHtml": " This is a compilation of the resources I made for my mod &#34;Demonika&#34;. I put in this file the ones which were rejected in the final version, plus the ones I used. Some are nice stuff, others are just the purest crap (in case you want to change them in order to make them usable, do as you wish). \r<br />\r<br />There are:\r<br />\r<br />- 2 new robes\r<br />\r<br />- 2 new banners\r<br />\r<br />- 8 altar clothes\r<br />\r<br />- 3 round rugs\r<br />\r<br />- 1 new altar, which is Mehrunes Dagon´s altar without his head and his razor´s pieces. \r<br />\r<br /> These are modders´resources and they are not ingame yet. I included an .esp file for evaluation. To check them out:\r<br />\r<br /> -Activate evildemonicTEST.esp and launch skyrim. Use the console and type &#34;coc AAevildemonic&#34; to go to the test cell, and &#34;coc AAevilaltar&#34; to see a sample of what can be done with them. \r<br />\r<br />You may use, modify and redistribute this as you wish,just give me the credits and make no commercial use of it of course.  ",
