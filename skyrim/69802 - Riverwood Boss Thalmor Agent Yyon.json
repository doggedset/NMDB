  "descriptionHtml": "Thalmor Agent Yyon is a boss 100x stronger than the Ebony Warrior. This is my 2nd boss mod, you can find my other one (Falkreath Boss Zavakin) here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69770\r<br />\r<br />Thalmor Agent Yyon has been sent to Riverwood to investigate the rumors of a couple Nords who were trying to encourage belief in Talos. I won&#39;t tell you how strong he is, but you&#39;ll see as soon as you walk into Riverwood. Let&#39;s just say you&#39;re going to get paralyzed. A lot. Make sure to bring tons of healing potions with you.",
