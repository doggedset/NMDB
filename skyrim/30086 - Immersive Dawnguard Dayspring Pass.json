It adjusts the locations of Fort Dawnguard and Dayspring Canyon (offsets the entire Dawnguard world space) to be more geologically correct.  I found it annoying that Fort Dawnguard was located right on the road from Skyrim but yet you could not get there from the road.  \r<br />2. It moves the entrance to Dayspring Canyon and creates a more immersive entrance.  I found it silly that the entrance to Dayspring Canyon was so far west and it did not even contain a map marker.  Also, why was the entrance to the Canyon so small?\r<br />3. When the Dawnguard Quest begins, the Dayspring Pass Map marker is added instead of the Fort Dawnguard marker, which doesn&#39;t even take you to the fort until later in the quest.  With this mod, the Fort Dawnguard map marker always takes you to the Fort.\r<br />\r<br />[i][color=green][size=4]Requirements[/size][/color][/i]\r<br />Obviously this mod requires the official Dawnguard DLC\r<br />\r<br />[i][color=green][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/color][/i]\r<br />This mod will probably conflict with any mod that modifies or add items at the vanilla Dayspring entrance in the Tamriel or Dawnguard worldspace.\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=4][i]Installation[/i][/size][/color]\r<br />Just download with Nexus Mod Manager and activate.\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=4][i]Known Issues[/i][/size][/color]\r<br />If you have already started the Dawnguard Quest line, you may need to &#34;Rediscover&#34; Fort Dawnguard since the map marker may get reset.  I could create a script to fix this but I&#39;m not sure its all that important.\r<br />_________________________",
