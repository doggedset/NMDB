  "summary": "Applies several fixes to Destruction Rune, Cloak and Wall spells to make them a more viable option.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod applies several fixes related to Destruction Rune, Cloak and Wall spells, namely:\r\n\r\n[LIST]\r\n[*]Cloak and Wall spells now correctly display their damage instead of the false 8 and 50 in their description. This oversight on the dev\\'s part made it so you could not see the effect of the Fortify Destruction potion on theses spells, even though it does in fact affect them.\r\n[*]Rune and Cloak spells are now affected by the Augmented Flames, Augmented Frost and Augmented Shock perks.\r\n[*]Wall spells have their base damage increased from (the actual) 8 to 15 to make them much more viable. (increasing it to 50 would have been insanity!).\r\n[/LIST]\r\n\r\nAll of these should make Destruction feel a bit more diverse and fun. There are other mods that make similar fixes, but this mod serves as a standalone version. It\\'s compatible with any mods that do not alter the above mentioned spells or perks (most notably my Mastered Magicka mod; I recommend using it).",
