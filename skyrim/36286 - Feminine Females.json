  "descriptionHtml": "[font=century gothic][size=2] This Mod changes the way that the women of Skyrim move. Instead of moving around like men, they will now use the appropriate female animations. This affects [b][u]ALL[/u][/b] of the female NPC’s in the game that normally use the male animations (If I’ve missed any, please let me know). All NPCs added by DLC&#39;s are also included.\r<br />\r<br />Have you ever found yourself being disturbed by the way that some of the women in Skyrim move around? Unbeknownst to many, quite a number of the women of Skyrim are set to move like men. This was a design decision by Bethesda; apparently because women in armour move like men (ignoring the fact that said armour is made for men&#33;). Oddly though, men in the game who wear dresses (mages, priests etc.) aren’t set to move like women (except for some of the male Dark Elves introduced by the Dragonborn DLC who were given the wrong animation type by accident). Either way, I disagree with this decision. If you have a world in which it’s normal for women to wear armour, armour will be made to allow women to move normally. So, I made this to make the female NPC’s a bit more feminine.\r<br />If you have a separate Mod that alters the female animations, this will extend the number of NPC’s using them.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=orange][u]Installation/Uninstallation[/u][/color][/size]\r<br />[size=2]To install simply download and activate using NMM, only one plugin will be activated but will cover whichever DLCs you have installed. Otherwise download the file manually, unpack with 7-zip and drop the appropriate plugin for you into your Skyrim Data folder, then ensure that it is activated in your Data files.\r<br />If you have a previous version of the Mod, please remember to remove all files first. No clean save is required.\r<br />The optional files are included for those people who still wish to do a manual installation but they are otherwise unnecessary.\r<br />Regardless of which or how many DLC&#39;s you have, there is now only one plugin for your game.\r<br />\r<br />To uninstall, simply use NMM to uninstall or delete the files from your Skyrim Data folder.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=orange][u]Load Order[/u][/color][/size]\r<br />[size=2] It’s best to load this Mod near the top of your load order, after all of the master files (.esm’s) and any Mods that say they have to be loaded at the top of your load order (such as the Unofficial patches). This should minimise any conflicts with other Mods and, if you do have any other Mods that modify the female NPC’s, the other Mods will take precedence and those NPC’s will use whichever animations those other Mods&#39; authors chose.
