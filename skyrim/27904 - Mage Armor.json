I made both the small and big body but no female version, since the female version of the journeyman mage kinda sucks (but if you guys request, i´m willing to do it)\r<br />EDIT: As you can see, i made a female version and i even made different styles (long sleeves, different gauntlets, etc)\r<br />So, if you are the kind of person who thinks that mages don´t have to limit their clothing to just robes and you have the knowledge and resources to add this to this game, then this is the file for you&#33;",
