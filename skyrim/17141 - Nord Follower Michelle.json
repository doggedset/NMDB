  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u][size=5][b]None of my mods may be used in ANY paid mods, if you have permission to use this mod from me you do NOT have permission to use it in a sale.[/b][/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />I have spent a while downloading follower mods to build up my femdom army, so it&#39;s time to give back to the community.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first attempt at a follower mod, and she turned out to be quite cute (well, she is when Better Females by Bella is used:- she&#39;s quite hideous with the vanilla head mesh). Michelle is set up to auto-level between 5 and 80, and uses a basic follower set-up. If dismissed she will remain at the location where she was dismissed.\r<br />\r<br />She can be found at the Drunken Huntsman inn at Whiterun, and favors heavy armor and two-handed weapons.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Version History[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />V1.0 - Initial attempt at using the construction set.\r<br />V1.1 - Attempt to remake using the NPC Editor.\r<br />V1.2 - Renamed esp/bsa to avoid conflict with Basskimm&#39;s Girls of Skyrim mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Updating[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Before updating, Michelle must be dismissed as a follower. After updating she can be found in the Drunken Huntsman again.\r<br />If updating from 1.0 remove Michelle.esp and Michelle.esm from your Data directory prior to updating. The .esm file has been replaced with a .bsa file.\r<br />If updating from 1.1 remove Michelle.esp and Michelle.bsa from your data directory prior to updating as the file names have been changed.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Requirements[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />ApachiiSkyhair - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Highly Recommended[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Better Females by Bella - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Credits[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Apachii for the excellent ApachiiSkyHair mod.\r<br />Foretrenty for the NPC Editor.\r<br />Bethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Permissions[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to make use of this mod. All I ask for is to be credited.\r<br />Please DO NOT upload this mod to any other site. The Steam Workshop has some particularly nasty verbiage in their terms and conditions that basically hands over all rights to Valve.",
