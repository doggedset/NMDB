Almost.\r\n\r\nI was very sad human being when i discovered skse doesn\\'t (or didn\\'t) tell steam about trophies. Fortunately I had learned only 19 dragon shouts (gosh, i never thought about counting it!) and i hadn\\'t pickpocketing at all.\r\n\r\nFor \\'Thu\\'um Master\\' just go closer to the wall.\r\n\r\nFor \\'Thief\\' escape a dungeon and travel to any city. There equip (already in backpack) special gloves and amulet for % of pickpocket. And rob whoever you want with 90% on trash. 11 people left for trophy so it\\'s not many.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS i had custom armor on Lydia, tell me if it makes problems.",
