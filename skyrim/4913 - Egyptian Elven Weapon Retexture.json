  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nA complete retexture for the elven greatsword. I tried to make it look like ancient egyptian but ended giving it a more futuristic look in some details.\r\n\r\n-Doubled texture size to 1024x1024.\r\n-Improved normal and enviromental maps.\r\n\r\nI will retex the rest of the elven weapons and the armor/shield if you like this, so critizism is more than welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nCopy the data folder to your Skyrim directory. To uninstall simply delete the files greatsword_d, greatsword_n and greatsword_m.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\nIt seems theres some flickering in the blade only visible if you drop it to the ground and look closely. This has nothing to do with the retexture, as it\\'s also present in vanilla elven greatsword.\r\n",
