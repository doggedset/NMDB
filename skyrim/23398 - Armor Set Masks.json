  "descriptionHtml": "Original mod:\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=90417576&searchtext=\r\n\r\nThis adds a Dragon Priest style mask to every craftable armor set.\r\nThe masks all have the same stats as the helmet from the set its from. All Masks are craftable and temperable, using the same materials as their vanilla helmet equivalents and require the same crafting ability.\r\n\r\nAll textures are original by me or edits of the vanilla textures, they won\\'t interrupt any other mods that affect the textures of the vanilla Dragon Priest Masks. They should be compatible with every mod, as they are all unique items and textures.\r\n\r\nI have not had a whole lot of time to troubleshoot every variable so if you find a problem please let me know and I\\'ll fix it right away.\r\n\r\nThe dragon masks come in both Heavy and Light, though they use the same mesh and textures.\r\nThe Wood mask (not Wooden Mask) has the same stats as a Leather Helmet, and requires Leather to upgrade.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n*Update - August 24 2012*\r\n- Added daedric mask with no tears, has different specularity than the tears version.\r\n-Added 2 non-armor \\\"jewelery\\\" masks.\r\n\r\n--credist--\r\nspecial thanks to Subtil_suicide\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=90417576&searchtext=\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nNote:please click endorse me if you like it.thanks",
