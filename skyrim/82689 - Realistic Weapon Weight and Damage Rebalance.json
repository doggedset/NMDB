  "descriptionHtml": "[b][i][size=3]\r<br />Description\r<br />[/size][/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod. Just Saying.\r<br />I was Unsatisfied by the damage weapons dealt and Increased the damage of all weapon types into a (hopefully) realistic area.Â I also reduced the damage difference between the weapon materials becaurse a steel sword isn`t much deadlier than a Iron sword just becaurse it got some finishing material in it (ouh and the longbow now is one of the strongest bow ingame, just how it should be with over 100lbs drawweight and ability to penetrade armor plates).\r<br />The Pictures show the damage with the Armsman perk on level 3\r<br />\r<br />Another thing I changed is the weight of all the weapons. I measured the weight in Kg and researched the real life counterparts so the weights shoud be pretty accurate. (exept orsimer/falmer/dwemner/usw. stuff there it was just guesswork)\r<br />\r<br />[b][i]Installation & Requirements\r<br />\r<br />English and German Version now aviable\r<br />\r<br />[/i][/b]Its just an esp. Drag it in your Data folder or use an Installer\r<br />You need Dragonborn and Dawnguard since I edited those weapons too.\r<br />If you want a Vanilla only Version just ask :)\r<br />I highly recommend using this mod\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9857/?\r<br />\r<br />[i][b]Bugs & Conflicts\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/i]Should conflict with mods that edit weapon damage or weight too but you can fix that by changing the load order\r<br />Please write it into the comment section If you notice any bugs or conflicts I try to fix them asap.\r<br />\r<br />I used tesv Translator for creating the English Version",
