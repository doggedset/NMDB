  "summary": "A very simple Husky Follower, Requires Dawnguard.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Riley is a husky companion found a Deep Folk Crossing, my personal favourite area in the game.\r<br />\r<br />I plan on updating Riley with a nearby skeleton holding a note with a little bit of backstory but until then Riley is just a normal dog follower.\r<br />\r<br />this is my first ever mod so I decided to start with something simple like a follower.\r<br />\r<br />He is exactly the same as Meeko except a Husky and Essential which means he SHOULD be 100% compatible with any follower mod such as UFO or My home is your home.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks for checking out my first mod and be sure to endorse if you like it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />-Bradley/Mr Bwabbers",
