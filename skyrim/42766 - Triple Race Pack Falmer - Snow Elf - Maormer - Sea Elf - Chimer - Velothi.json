  "descriptionHtml": "Three reworked Mer races for Skyrim, with their own abilities and stats, conforming to Lore. \r\n\r\nFALMER (Snow Elves)\r\n-Stat rework to match Lore Elves\r\n-New Abilities\r\n    -Cloak of Auri-El (Flame cloak for 30 seconds, ignores all resistance)\r\n    -Frostbitten (100% Resistant to Frost)\r\n\r\nMAORMER (Sea Elves)\r\n-Stat rework to match Lore Elves\r\n-New Abilities\r\n    -Waterborn (Fire resistance)\r\n    -Sea Child (Waterbreathing)\r\n\r\nCHIMER\r\n-Stat rework to match Lore Elves\r\n-New Abilities\r\n     -Pure Energy (Cloak of sparks, 100 seconds)\r\n     -Aldmere Remnants (70% resistance to disease, quicker Magicka regeneration)\r\n**\r\nNB NB NB NB NB NB NB NB NB\r\n**\r\nI have had a lot of people pm me with the typical \\\"purple skin disease\\\", otherwise recognised as missing textures. This means that people are not reading the instructions properly. Irrespective of whether you have NMM or not, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS BELOW. Else the race will not work. I\\'m sorry it had to be done this way, but if I had used NMM scripting-and I tried- then these would become race replacers, and nobody wants that.\r\nThe directions are not rocket science, and they won\\'t harm your game, or NMM, in any way whatsoever, it is simply to avoid mixing up of scripts and turning any possible race into some wacky hybrid. Thanks for your time :P\r\n***\r\nDIRECTIONS\r\n\r\nUnpack the .esp into your Skyrim Data file.\r\nUnpack the texture files marked \\'chimer\\', \\'maormer\\' and \\'snowelf\\' into the directory within your skyrim folder: data, textures, actors, character alongside the other files marked \\'bretonfemale\\', \\'bretonmale\\' etc.\r\n\r\nTAKE NOTE\r\nThe eye textures, due to scripting, will need to be aligned with the race. To do so, just flick the gender slider back and forth till the Falmer eyes go pale, Chimer eyes go yellow, and the Maormer eyes white. Then you will have the correct compilation of feature. If any of the features glitch for some reason, just flick the gender slider again to reset the glitched feature.\r\nIn addition, I have not fully completed complexion diffuses as of yet, so that slider will give you some honestly weird outcomes. To reset, use the gender slider. I shall be uploading a file with the complexion diffuses altered as soon as I figure out their strange lightmapping.....",
