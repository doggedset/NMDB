  "summary": "Makes the Bound Bow playable, craftable and potentially endgame material. If you\\'ve got the stones that is.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod basically adds the Bound Bow into the game without having to use spells. If you\\'re an archer then you\\'ll love this mod. The Bound Bow becomes craftable and temperable. It\\'s extremely powerful and isn\\'t meant to be obtained right away from Helgen.\r\n\r\nI have also made Bound arrows playable for the full set. These weapons have the highest base attack then all the other bows and arrows. Making them endgame weapons.\r\n\r\nI have renamed the bow to Spectral Bow since it isn\\'t bound anymore. It doesn\\'t weigh anything, why would it? It\\'s spectral...\r\n\r\nCrafting: Spectral Bow\r\n1x Daedric Bow\r\n2x Daedra Heart\r\n10x Black Soul Gem (Filled)\r\n\r\nCrafting: Spectral Arrow x25\r\n25x Daedric Arrow\r\n1x Black Soul Gem (Filled)\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\nYou may take this mod and do whatever the hell you like with it. Took me all of about 10 minutes to make, so enjoy. :)\r\n",
