  "summary": "Just two overpowered companions to help you out.",
  "descriptionHtml": "They are both at level 100, are set to essential, maxed out stats, all perks.\r\n\r\nThey have basic steel armor, just add on what you want. Also they are huge, about a foot taller than the average npc, and built. I suggest this mod: A Better body scale for Khajit and Argonian Male by TS http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6239 makes them looks like true beasts.\r\n\r\nLocation: Riverwood\r\n\r\nInstall: Just drop into your data files, nothing fancy.\r\n\r\nUninstall: Just delete them, not the hardest thing in the world.\r\n\r\nSoon to come, quests for each NPC. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you like, endorse,  any questions, just comment.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
