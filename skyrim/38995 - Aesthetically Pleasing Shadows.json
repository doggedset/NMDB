  "descriptionHtml": "This is more of a Tweak than a mod, which made the Shadows in my opinion much better, with a low fps drop of 3-5 fps in general.\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the codes below into SkyrimPerfs* by deleting only the original text shown below and replacing with this, this will mean that there will be high resolution shadows, unlike the vanilla ones with minimal fps drop. Remember to create a backup by copying the initial codes and saving in a programme such as Notepad as SkyrimPerfs Backup in case the change affect your performance in-game.\r\n\r\n* SkyrimPrefs is located in the Skyrim Folder, or alternatively can be searched for using the windows search bar\r\n\r\n[Display]\r\niBlurDeferredShadowMask=4\r\nfInteriorShadowDistance=1800.0000\r\nfShadowDistance=2000.0000\r\niShadowMapResolutionSecondary=16384\r\niShadowMapResolutionPrimary=16384\r\niShadowSplitCount=2\r\n\r\nbTreesReceiveShadows=0\r\nbDrawLandShadows=0\r\nbFull Screen=1\r\n\r\nbShadowMaskZPrepass=1\r\n\r\niShadowMapResolution=16384\r\nfShadowBiasScale=0.9000\r\n\r\nThank you all for the constructive comments, especially Ablaze666.
