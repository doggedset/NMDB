  "descriptionHtml": "Changed the enchatments for the Nightingale Set to be more apropriated for a highly trained sneaker.\r\n\r\nI was thinking myself, this set is cool and strong, but the enchantments aren\\'t that good. So let\\'s see: The thieves venerates Nocturnal, so they\\'ll receive her blessing (specially when someone turns into a Nightingale), but they can\\'t lose the enchantments of their own armor because they\\'re thieves and a Nightingale used to be a sneaker. Why don\\'t just combine the enchantments? So I did this mod and changed some things.\r\n\r\nNotes: All the new items have a \\\"(NEW)\\\" after the name. Use the console to get them. They can be destroyed to learn the enchantment.\r\n\r\nHope you like it ;).",
