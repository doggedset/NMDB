  "descriptionHtml": "Adds the Alchemy Chest from Oblivion to the Arch-Mage\\'s Quarters. This version is slightly modified from the original Oblivion-chest.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\n- Place an ingredient to the Enchanted Chest\r\n- Cast Hands of Alchemy on the chest (spell tome found in the chest). This is a power and can only be used once a day.\r\n- Placed ingredient is now duplicated\r\n\r\nThe amount of copies varies:\r\n- Ingredients marked as common (including Glowing Mushrooms) are duplicated 10-15 times.\r\n- Ingredients marked as uncommon are duplicated 8-12 times\r\n- Ingredients marked as rare (exception are Daedra Hearts) are duplicated 6-9 times.\r\n- Human hearts, Human Flesh and Daedra Hearts are duplicated 1-3 times.\r\n\r\nNote that if you are not Arch-Mage, taking anything from the chest is considered theft.\r\n\r\nWhile originally a part of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11123]this mod[/url], I decided to release this as a separate version. The two are NOT compatible.",
