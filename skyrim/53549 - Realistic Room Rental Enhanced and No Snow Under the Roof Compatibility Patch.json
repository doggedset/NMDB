  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small compatibility patch I put together to fix some issues outside of the Nightgate Inn.  The edits are fairly small...  I just replaced a few meshes with the snow-covered versions and disabled a few snowdrifts that were in the way.  \r<br />\r<br />Note:  This patch is only for Realistic Room Rental Enhanced.  The Basic version should not require any patch to be compatible.\r<br />\r<br />In your load order, No Snow Under the Roof should come first, then Realistic Room Rental, then this patch.\r<br />\r<br />Both of the original mods are required.  All credit should go to the original authors:\r<br />perseid9 - Realistic Room Rental Enhanced (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25029/?)\r<br />PROMETHEUS_ts - No Snow Under the Roof (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51188/?)\r<br />\r<br />I made this patch for my own use, but I see other people asking for it, so here it is.  I am hoping that eventually perseid9 will bundle a NSUtR patch with Realistic Room Rentals.  I do not have any plans at this time to do any additional work with this patch, but if you see a problem, let me know and I may fix it.  \r<br />",
