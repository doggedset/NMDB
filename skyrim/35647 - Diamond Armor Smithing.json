  "descriptionHtml": "Have you completed the \"Stones of Barenziah\" quest and don't know what to do with all those gemstones???  Put them to use by crafting a stylish set of armor.  \n<br />\n<br />This is a full armor mod for all races and genders. There are light and heavy sets as well as a midweight variant of the light cuirass. I hope you enjoy the armor.  Stat list is available on the \"read me\" tab. It is best viewed in .txt format.\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]osr_qEw7kZ0[/youtube]    [youtube]FXyWpkhUozU[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />Items can be crafted at the forge each gem type is unlocked as you progress in the smithing perk tree.\n<br />Garnet=Iron\n<br />Amethyst=Steel\n<br />Ruby=Elven/Dwarven\n<br />Sapphire=Advanced Armors(steel)/Orcish\n<br />Emerald=Glass/Ebony\n<br />Diamond=Dragon\n<br />\n<br />///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n<br />Also available:\n<br />Diamond Weapon Smithing http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19068/?\n<br />///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n<br />\n<br />[FAQ]\n<br />\n<br />{Q}: What are the console commands for these?\n<br />{A}: First off, do yourself a favor and complete the “Stones of Barenziah” quest.  It will take you to some cool places and afterwards you will never want for gemstones again.  I want to make you play the game to get these, work for it a little bit. but if your time is short and just want to get to it I can definitely relate to that.  Item codes are created randomly when you install a mod and thus unique to you.  you have to search for them by typing [help diamond] in the console to search for all references to diamond in the game.  pgup to see more entries.  or type[help \"heavy diamond gauntlets\"]  to search for a specific item.  then type[player.additem XXXXXXXX n]x's are the item code, n = how many you want.\n<br />\n<br />{Q}:  How come no shields? /How come no hammers?\n<br />{A}:  I have just made an update adding shields hammers will be next.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is there gender/beast support? \n<br />A: Yes, full female and beast support is included in this mod. There are two heavy helmets, visor up, and visor down. My helms do not hide the head like other full helms. I really wanted to be able to see the character eyes through the helm as you can see in the 5th screenshot with Serana. For beat races (Argonian/Khajiit/Orc) the visor is always up it was too far of a stretch to morph the helm to fit correctly. \n<br />\n<br />{Q}:  Will you make silver/steel, or another gem color?\n<br />{A}:  I intend to finish the missing items in the series but beyond that I have no intentions to add more texture variations.  As it is, in terms of mesh files, this mod series is already the equivalent of six separate sets of weapons and armor.  I actually could not fit another color in (on steam) even if I wanted to without making it a separate mod.  Regardless, I've done way more than I set out do back when I first made a diamond sword and bow. I am looking to tie up my loose end on what I've got and put this series to bed. \n<br />\n<br />Q: Will this work with other mods like “Deadly Combat”, “SkyRE”, and “Frostfall”? \n<br />A: Assuming mods like this adjusts the armor rating based on the material keyword it should treat most of my stuff the same as if it were the vanilla armor. I haven't made any changes to gameplay I've simply added new models. One exception will be with the \"Skyre: compatibility plugin\", when used on my weapon mods, particularly with light sapphire and diamond weapons where I used armor material keywords to link the weapons to the advanced and dragon armor perks. The plugin will likely get confused and give them low stats. Other than that my mods play very well with others. As I mention before, no changes have been make to how the game functions, its just new content.",
