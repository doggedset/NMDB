At second level of the perk, it extends its duration to 5 seconds, which is enough to move along half of a room and get at behind of a target or find another shadow[/*]\r<br />[*]   Normal+Extended description. Same as last Normal Plugin, but it has an extended description, like the ones in the mod  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59854/?]Defluffling PerMa and PerMa Extended Perks Description by GioGr[/url].\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]   Hardcore Plugin. The perk Shadowbound at first level require a light level lower than 20, and has a duration of 2 seconds, which is ideal to choose combats and flee from thoose you still need to prepare or want to pocke before real combat, it also could help you if you are close enougth  to another shadow or to get a perfect ambush at small distances. At second level of the perk, it extends its duration to 5 seconds, which is enough to move along half of a room and get at behind of a target or find another shadow[/*]\r<br />[*]   Hardcore Plugin+Extended Description. Same as Hardcore plugin but has an extended description.\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />This far, both Hardcore plugins are thinked for temerarious ninjas or people who uses Dark nights and dark dungeons, or any other mod wich makes Skyrim darker and more dangerous\r<br />\r<br />I had to edit also the Vaermina&#39;s Refuge perk, to be more compatible with this new shadowbound, so it provides an additional regeneration of 30% only, but it has no cooldown neither (because shadowbound has none), it requires same light level to be active instead\r<br />\r<br />It is much more usefull and immersive with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19447/?]Sneak Tools [/url]and darkness mods (but climates of tamriel, even light is shadow in this mod) and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52239/?]immersive NPC in the dark[/url] (they use lanterns to look for you).  There is much more sinergy with the perk Thief Tools, both given by the prodigy perk, not it is more rewarding to turn on lights in strategical points, so you could see your enemies, but  they don&#39;t, and the most important, you can use water arrows to make sure a dark path or refuge  for you, just like Nocturnal would want. \r<br />\r<br />In fact you need to think like a ninja and shadows are much more than an estetic or visual effect, they are your home now. I would really like to share this contribution with all of you.\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][i][u][b][color=#ff7700][size=3]REQUIREMENTS[/size][/color][/b][/u][/i]\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list][color=#ff7700][size=3][i][u][b]\r<br />[/b][/u][/i][/size][/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59849/?]   Perkus Maximus by T3nd0[/url] obviously\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][b][i][u][color=#ff7700][size=3]INSTALLATION[/size][/color][/u][/i][/b]\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />With manager:    Just use NMM or MO\r<br />Manually:      Copy the choosen esp to the data folder\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][u][i][b][color=#ff7700][size=3]UNINSTALL[/size][/color][/b][/i][/u][/*]\r<br />[/list][color=#ff7700][size=3][b][i][u]\r<br />[/u][/i][/b][/size][/color]With manager:   You can use NMM or MO to uninstall\r<br />Manually:      Just delete the esp used from data folder\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][u][i][b][color=#ff7700][size=3]RECOMMENDED MODS[/size][/color][/b][/i][/u]\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]   [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52239/?]Immersive NPC in the Dark by by [b]hacknpaint[/b][/url]\r<br />   [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11356/?]Mike Foxs Darker Nights by [b]Mike Fox[/b][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11353/?]   Mike Foxs Darker Dungeons by [b]Mike Fox[/b][/url]\r<br />   [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59171/?]AH Hotkeys - Skyrim Hotkey Manager by [b]RealAntithesis[/b][/url]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][i][b][u][color=#ff7700][size=4]INCOMPATIBILITIES[/size][/color][/u][/b][/i][/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />   Any other mod which changes Shadowbound Perk\r<br />\r<br />Any suggestion is wellcome.
