  "summary": "Adds a snazzy bosmer specializing in the sale of ranged goods to Sadri&#39;s Used Wares.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=pink]When I moved to Windhelm, I found it difficult to keep my bow supplied with decent ammunition to fire at bad guys without traveling to Whiterun or Solitude. So, I finally got around to muddling through the CK to do something about that problem. Sharing on the chance that there are other Windhelm natives with empty quivers out there.\r<br />\r<br />Presenting Rita the Fletcher.\r<br />\r<br />A Bosmer Skyrim native who used to make the wilds her home. With the war breaking out, she&#39;s decided to find sturdy walls and set up shop, peddling her talents in the frozen city of Windhelm. Luckily a local Dunmer merchant had a spare room and counter space to offer for a [i]relatively[/i] decent rate. \r<br />\r<br />[u]Notes:[/u]\r<br />*Dawnguard Compatible when you select v1.01DG. She will now stock a good supply of steel and dwarven bolts. Crossbows themselves must be obtained through other means. \r<br />*She usually holds shop in Sadri&#39;s Used Wares from 9AM to 8PM, but can sometimes get held up on her morning stroll through the city and her deliveries to the Palace if she stops to jaw at someone. She likes to talk to people even though she doesn&#39;t have much to say.\r<br />*She is setup as Master Marksman Trainer (For those archer types who aren&#39;t in the TG) and Marriage option, but I&#39;ve yet to be able to test these two aspects with success due to the nature of my current save game. If anyone with applicable skill or a marriable character wants to test this, I&#39;d be much obliged.\r<br />*This mod should not conflict with anything I know of. I deleted a few static crates and shuffled some things around in the &#39;storage room&#39; at Sadri&#39;s to make a little space for her to live in, and she&#39;s taken possession of the wardrobe there. Of course, if you have any mods installed that also use this space, there&#39;s likely to be some issues.\r<br />*Pictured with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356]XCE[/url] installed. Your Rita may not look exactly like mine if you don&#39;t have it, but it shouldn&#39;t be required.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][u]Updates[/u]\r<br />[b]1.01DG:[/b] -Finally got around to making her sell bolts. \r<br />[b]1.01:[/b] -Fixed Rita&#39;s journal to be a little more lore friendly and applicable to an Imperial Windhelm. \r<br />-Modified her routine a bit. She&#39;ll now visit the temple at 8pm and take supper at the corner club at 10pm before heading back to the shop for bedtime. Reason for this is she and vanilla Sadri both strangely won&#39;t sell anything after 8pm, even though the store is open and both of them are at the counter and their packages tell them to. \r<br />[b]1.00:[/b] -Launch Version [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=cyan][u]Installation: [/u]\r<br />-Select the file that suits your needs. Note: 1.01DG Requires Dawnguard to function. \r<br />-Extract to Data Folder, enable .esp and enjoy&#33; Or&#33; Use the NMM&#33;\r<br />-The textures/meshes folders are optional to fix the gray face bug. Drop them in your Data folder to prevent or fix this issue if you experience it.[/color]",
