  "summary": "A mod created to improve Hunting and prices of pelts and hides.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]Description[/u][/b]:\r<br />\r<br />I created this mod to give more love to Hunters. In a place like Skyrim, hunting is for sure one of the best ways of gathering food as well as all the pelts the Nords require to make their amours and clothes. I felt that hunting wasn&#39;t rewarding enough and so I increased the price of all the pelts and hides along with some other items related to hunting (food and ingredients). The animal loot was also improved. We all need to pay for that house in Solitude and what would we do with all the pelts and hides acquired from all the animals we had to kill to stack our Glass Bow of the Stag Prince? By the way, this mod only requires the main Skyrim game. No DLC required. :P\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]List of contents[/u][/b]:\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][UPDATE][/u][/b]\r<br />- Bug fixes\r<br />- [u][i]Kyne&#39;s Sacred Token[/i][/u] - Bows do 10% more damage insteasd of 15%.\r<br />- [u][i]Ancient Bow of the Hunt[/i][/u] -
