  "summary": "Updated to 3.0 now. Her body will work with all types now. I updated Willow\\'s warpaint a little to make it look like it was applied by fingers. I updated her hair with a new hair from Apachii. I left her face alone completely but removed her spells in keeping with her movie character. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/12989-1-1345062312.jpg[/img]\r\n \r\n\r\n[b][size=4]Etain from the movie Centurion - This is my interpretation of one of my favorite movie characters \\\"Etain the Pict Scout\\\" played by Olga Kurylenko in the film Centurion. While by no means a perfect replica, with the limited resources I had to work with I am happy with her final version. I spent nearly a week working on her, feeling like I was going to go mad at times trying to get her facial features correct. I have edited Willows Warpaint that she made for me so that it is closer to the original movies warpaint. I basically took the wide brush strokes and made them rounded so they look like they were applied by fingers. I still owe much thanks for Willow\\'s help on this!!![/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[b][size=3]Update 3.0[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[b][size= 2]Face: Warpaint Updated to look more like the movie character but her face is the same as version 2.0 for purists\r\nWeight: Body Weight Updated to 70% at the scale and will now work with all female bodies\r\nSpells: No Spells whatsoever in keeping with the original movie character\r\nRelationships: No relationship to wolves (didn\\'t really work anyway) \r\nCombat: She is at a Calculated Level 45 or Auto-level from 10 to 82 Two Handed Boss.\r\nArmor: Prefers light armor in keeping with the movie character \r\nHair: New Hair from Apachii that I feel matches the movies a little closer. Note: Since she is created using the NPC Editor I removed each and every extra Apachii hair file from her. There should be no extra hairs in the \\\"showracemenu\\\" with version 3.0 in use.\r\nEyes: Hazel Green, I used \\\"[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722]Eyes of Beauty[/url]\\\" on her for this update.

It is located under miscellaneous in downloads.[/b][/size]  \r\n\r\n[b][color= cornflowerblue]Location: Winking Skeever\r\nColoring and Physical Attributes: I customized her hair color, skin tone and of course her facial structure and makeup coloring. I used Ms. Kurylenko\\'s physical stats on her scaling ( 27% for version 2.0) and height. \r\nFace: Better Females by Bella - Makeup Option 1 and No Shine Option: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\nSkin: Glossy Skin for all female bodymod - v05 - No Gloss http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=26003\r\nShown - Vanilla Armor for CBBE by Caliente - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12273\r\nCloak; Winter is coming Timber Wolf Cloak Trimmed in White Fur. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13486\r\nHer Spear (Which is the closest to the one in the movie I could find) is from Bob\\'s Armory (Thanks Mr. Dave!)
