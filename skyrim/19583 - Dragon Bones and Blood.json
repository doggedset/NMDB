  "descriptionHtml": "I personally felt that the dragons\\' bones seemed way too clean after being killed. It only seems logical that some gore would be left over.\r\n\r\nThis is just a simple re-texture done with Photoshop.\r\n\r\nThis texture DOES affect all dragon skulls and skeletons throughout Skyrim.\r\n\r\nAs I am not a modder, I do not know how to apply this texture only to killed dragons.\r\n\r\nIf any modders know how to do so, feel free to alter the file.\r\n\r\nInstall manually to your Skyrim folder where your \\\"Data\\\" file is located.\r\n\r\nI\\'m in no way, shape or form a modder. This was a personal preference of mine and I thought I\\'d share it with those who may have the same preference as I do.\r\n\r\nThanks. :)",
