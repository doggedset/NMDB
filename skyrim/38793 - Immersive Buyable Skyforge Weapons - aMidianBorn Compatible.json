  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#1E7FCB][size=14]Description[/size][/color]\r\nAlways wanted to use the Skyforge Weapons but you havn\\'t completed the Companions quest? Always wondered why everyone says Eorlund Gray-Mane is the best smith in Skyrim even if he sells the weapon that makes his reputation only to Companions?  Wonder no more, now you can!\r\n\r\n\r\nEorlund Gray-Mane will now sell Skyforge Weapons but you\\'ll 1rst have to persuade Eorlund to sell Skyforge Weapons and then, persuade him again to get a discount. He is voice acted and use is own voice so it\\'s [u]not immersion breaking[/u]. If you finish Companions, you get a new dialogue. You\\'ll get vanilla prices (very low) as usual and the other sets will be removed.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, [color=#1E7FCB]you need to be Lvl 15[/color] to be able to persuade him. There\\'s [color=#1E7FCB]2 way to persuade Eorlund[/color]. The 1rst way is related to [color=#1E7FCB]Main Quest[/color] and I\\'ll let you find which quest is required to persuade him. The other way is with [color=#00CC00]Speechcraft[/color], you need to be [color=#00CC00]Lvl 25[/color] the first time and [color=#00CC00]Lvl 40[/color] for the discounts. \r\n[color=#FFCC00]Defaults prices[/color] are [color=#FFCC00]Elven[/color] and [color=#FF9900]Discounted[/color] are [color=#FF9900]Dwarven[/color].\r\n\r\n[b][color=#FFCC00]Please endorse![/color] [color=#FF9900]It helps more than you think![/color][/b] \r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000]**Known minor bug[/color] : If you look at Eorlunds selling list and than activate the dialogue, the new weapons won\\'t be added to the list immediately. You have to wait for his list to change. Wait for 30 hours should be ok.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#1E7FCB][size=14]Versions and Compatibilities[/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#1E7FCB][b]\\'\\'Main file\\'\\'[/b][/color]  aint compatible with any mod that changes properties of Skyforge weapons. \r\n\r\n[u]The  2 patches below requires the Main File![/u]\r\n\r\n[color=#1E7FCB][b]\\'\\'Amidianborn Patch\\'\\'[/b][/color]  requires [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34147//?] Wolf and Skyforge Weapons [/url] V2.0 since his latest version is not on Book Of Silence yet.\r\n\r\n[color=#1E7FCB][b]\\'\\'Skyforge Weapon Patch\\'\\'[/b][/color] requires [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36815//?]Skyforge Weapon[/url]. For now, Eorlund will sell only standard Steel Skyforge Weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=#1E7FCB]Credit[/color][/b] \r\nThe screenshots were taken with RCRN, Dynavision and Amidianborn Textures. \r\nAlso, a big thanks to [u]ThresherMaw[/u] for his help for compatibility and [u]EmeraldReign[/u] for his help with scripts.",
