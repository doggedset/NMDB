  "descriptionHtml": "[b]\r<br />Version 1.1 online\r<br />\r<br />[b]All credits/kudos/endorsements go to KainXavier, he did all the work and he allowed me to alter\r<br />his mod and scripts.\r<br />And he was holding my hand while doing this, because I am a little magician\r<br />with the CK,\r<br />but I have no clue of scripting and that will never change.\r<br />\r<br />I have been searching for something like this for a long time, I hope you too.\r<br />Enjoy it.\r<br />\r<br />One thing in my own cause:\r<br />\r<br />I am looking for a scripter how could write a mod similar like this one,\r<br />which will monitor summoned creatures and grant a very little xp in conjuration\r<br />to the player\r<br />e.g.\r<br />for every few seconds the summond creature is alive, or maybe in combat, or\r<br />maybe is doing a attack,\r<br />anything like this would be suitable.\r<br />So it would make sense to keep your summonings longer, because in vanilla they\r<br />only give you XP for\r<br />their FIRST strike in combat and then never again.\r<br />THX for reading\r<br />\r<br />Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />=Summary=\r<br />\r<br />Running while wearing armor builds experience for Light and Heavy Armor.\r<br />\r<br />Increasing Heavy Armor allows players to sprint for longer.\r<br />\r<br />Increasing Light Armor results in being able to move faster overall.\r<br />\r<br />Just about everything is customizable too&#33;\r<br />\r<br />=Installation=\r<br />\r<br />Please extract ArmoredRunning.bsa and ArmoredRunning.esp to Skyrim&#39;s Data\r<br />folder and ensure the mod is set to load before playing.\r<br />\r<br />=Removal=\r<br />\r<br />Armored Running makes permanent changes to the player character&#39;s actor values.\r<br />\r<br />Please be sure to disable these changes using the Armored Running lesser power \r<br />or the Mod Configuration Menu before removing the mod.\r<br />\r<br />=Compatibility=\r<br />\r<br />This mod was tested on Skyrim v1.9.32.0.8 and cleaned with TES5Edit v3.0.30.\r<br />\r<br />It does not make any changes to the base game and is entirely script-driven.\r<br />\r<br />It also fully supports SkyUI&#39;s Mod Configuration Menu but does not require it\r<br />or SKSE.\r<br />\r<br />Will not be compatible with Armord Sprint, because it uses the same reworked\r<br />scripts, my limited knowledge prevents\r<br />to rewrite and rename everything without breaking it.\r<br />\r<br />=Known Issues=\r<br />\r<br />-Player-enchanted armor must be re-equipped after first loading the mod.\r<br />--There is a known issue with Skyrim that prevents custom enchantments from \r<br />being applied when items are equipped through script.\r<br />\r<br />=Change List=\r<br />\r<br />--v1.0--\r<br />\r<br />- Changed MCM descripotion\r<br />\r<br />-Please contact the author if you wish to alter or localize this modification.\r<br />--He goes by KainXavier on the Nexus network and Kain-Xavier on Steam.[/b]\r<br />[/b]",
