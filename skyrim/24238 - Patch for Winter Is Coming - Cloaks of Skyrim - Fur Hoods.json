It is free, take less than a five seconds and it says a lot about you. \r\nREAD ALL THE “READ ME” FILES, (YES, the three of them) most of your question about contents, distribution, etc…. are already answered there.\r\n\r\n============   \r\nInstallation   \r\n============ \r\n\r\nInstall the following mods, use the procedures included in the “READ ME”\r\n\r\n- Download and Install Cloaks of Skyrim\r\nUse\r\nCloaks.esp - Regular version. Cloaks are distributed throughout levelled lists and hand-placed in the world, as well as being craftable.\r\n\r\n- Download and install Winter is Coming\r\nUse\r\n1nivWICCloaks.esp: This is the main plugin for WIC, it places items through out the game in chests/npcs/vendors AND crafting.\r\n\r\n- Download and Install Fur Hoods\r\nUse\r\nNorthborn Fur Hoods.esp: This is the main plugin, does distribute nothing in the world, but made the items craftable.\r\n\r\nYour load order should be by then\r\n\r\n    Cloaks.esp \r\n    1nivWICCloaks.esp \r\n    Northborn Fur Hoods.esp\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n(And then the patch, should be installed after those)\r\n    .\r\n    1nivWICSkyCloaksNorthPatch.esp\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\nManual Installation of the Patch\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you installed your selected .esp/meshs/textures into your Data folder found in Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/Data/\r\nAnd you DID NOT FORGET ANYTHING (or it won´t show in game).\r\n\r\n2. Use 7zip to extract the files. Extract the 1nivWICCloaksNorthPatch.esp to your Data folder.\r\n\r\n3. Arrange your load order to be exactly\r\n\r\nCloaks.esp \r\n1nivWICCloaks.esp \r\nNorthborn Fur Hoods.esp\r\n1nivWICCloaksNorthPatch.esp\r\n\r\n4. Turn on the .esps in your choice of mod manager, or the Skyrim game data files menu.\r\n\r\n5. Finished.\r\n\r\n==============   \r\nUninstallation   \r\n==============\r\n\r\nDelete de Patch .esp\r\nIf you do so, the leveled list shared between the three mods will disappear, you won´t find some of the cloaks in vendors or in the world any more.\r\n\r\n==============   \r\nQuestions \r\n==============\r\nQ-is this compatible with dawnguard or only no dawnguard? and dragonborn?\r\nA-It is compatible with everything, but if your are using dawnguard and you want the cloaks from cloak of sjyrim mod you still need to use the small dawnguard patch included in cloaks of skyrim. This pluggin itself does not contain info from dawnguard nor dragonborn, but as far as they use the leveled lists included here, the items will be there.\r\n\r\nQ-Do I need the old WIC-Cloaks Patch from WIC compatibility patch?\r\nA-No, all the data and information contained in that patch is already included in this one. What I have done is basically take the old one and just expanded it to include Northborn Fur Hoods in leveled lists, vendors, etc… just to make the three of them compatible and working together at the same time.\r\n\r\nQ-How long it will take see all the stuff in game?\r\nA-As soon as the NPC and vendors list reset and NPC re-spawn, that is around a week ingame time. Areas that you have not explored yet should be fine\r\n\r\nQ-Was it tested?\r\nA- Yes, it was with no problems so far. The only thing is that Northborn Fur Hoods are a bit underpriced compared with WIC stuff.\r\n\r\nQ-It is multilingual .esp?\r\nA-Any item will keep the name in its original language, except northborn fur hoods, because their items price were edited.\r\n\r\nQ-Are those mods still compatible with Frostfall or Hypothermia?\r\nA-Personally I am not using it, but the patch ONLY touch the leveled lists and nothing else, so I think that those of the three mods already compatible with Hypothermia still are (I think currently all of them are). If you want it, you should request that to the author).\r\n\r\nQ- This mod crashes my game before the main menu. \r\nA- Did you update your Skyrim to the latest version? It has nothing to do with this patch; remember that those mods required Skyrim to be updated to at least 1.6.89.0 to work properly. Also, did you install everything?, sure?, WIC, cloaks and northborn are pluggins that are masters of this one, you need to load then because if just one is not there or not ticked the game will crash.\r\n\r\nQ- I already had the Hoods because I am using \\\"Inmersive Armors\\\", and the Hodds are there. Do I need this?\r\nA- If you already have Immersive armors you don´t really need this patch, but you can still use it with no trouble.\r\nCloaks and WIC add its items ingame trough their own leveled lists (not the vanilla ones, but its own), I just included the hoods in such lists, so now you have the chance to get those items ingame together (in NPC, vendors, chests, etc..) with hoods mixed up with all the other cloaks and WIC stuff.\r\nImmersive armors already add the hoods ingame and does pretty much the same, but using other different leveled lists than WIC and cloaks (it edits some of the vanilla ones), with that lists you will find them mostly as armors on NPC and loot.\r\nBasically, I did this patch focusing in those not using immersive armors or those using just some of them as standalone armors, so they do not miss the hoods.\r\nHowever, I felt that the hoods fit better with the kind of stuff that cloaks and WIC are adding and I personally prefer the hoods distribution ingame that way; it is just a matter of personal choice.\r\nBut you can still use both the patch and immersive armors together (I do) because there is no conflict at all, the only thing you have to choose is in which way you want your items appearing ingame (Both fit well, using both could be a bit redundant, but just a little and is almost not noticeable), so it is up to you to use it or not. \r\n   \r\n=====================   \r\nCREDITS\r\n=====================   \r\n\r\nThanks to Nivea for meshes and textures.
