WHAT IS THIS GUIDE? [color=#3d85c6]________[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This guide is a collection of tweaks and mods almost guaranteed to vastly improve the quality performance and stability of Skyrim with as little fuss as possible. I have written this guide to be as versatile as possible so you can increase or lower the settings and install additional texture mods depending on your machine&#39;s capabilities.\r<br />\r<br />This guide was originally written prior to my reading the STEP (Skyrim Total Enhancement Project) but, since STEP is so comprehensive and popular, I have since taken it on to fully consult and incorporate the STEP guide into this guide.\r<br />\r<br />I would therefore like to take this opportunity to state my appreciation for the hours of work and effort everyone in the Nexus community contributes. Most of the credit is due to the many modders and users who have posted on the site and its forums. This will always be a work in progress so please  let me know of any tweaks or (stable) mods you think should be included&#33;\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: Although I take the utmost care in testing my settings I am constantly on the hunt for more and/or better tweaks. Any major updates will be noted but it might be a good idea to run through areas of the guide again if you encounter issues.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4] [color=#3d85c6]___[/color] 3. WHO IS THIS GUIDE FOR? [color=#3d85c6]_____[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: As of now parts of this guide do cater more specifically for nVidia based systems. I have no real gripe with ATI but simply don&#39;t have an ATI card (anymore) so cannot really test and make promises. However, much of the guide is applicable to either configuration and if you know your graphics card it should pose no real obstacles.\r<br />\r<br />Now, I like to push my system to its limits, however, I like my game experience to be as immersive and interruption free as possible (girlfriend excluded of course) so would like to make it clear now that this is NOT a guide on how to maximise everything regardless of the cost to fps. My main priority is about finding a good balance between quality, performance and stability so that the game looks as good as it can but also that it runs smoothly everywhere and without crashing&#33;  Skyrim deserves to be immersive and nothing is more off putting than inconsistent visuals and/or juddering fps and a CTD.\r<br />\r<br />For your info, my rig:\r<br />\r<br />Intel Core i5 3.1Ghz\r<br />nVidia GTS 450 w/ 1GB\r<br />6GB RAM\r<br />Windows 10 64bit\r<br />\r<br />It is also worth mentioning that this guide assumes the reader has some BASIC knowledge about adding and removing mods, how mods work etc. If you have absolutely no idea then study the following guide first: \r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: this is actually a highly detailed Oblivion guide but modding the games is a very similar process except the only real difference is that because of Steam the /data folder is in C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />[url=http://cs.elderscrolls.com/index.php/Oblivion_Mods_FAQ]http://cs.elderscrolls.com/index.php/Oblivion_Mods_FAQ[/url]\r<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4] [color=#3d85c6]___[/color] 4. STARTING FRESH [color=#3d85c6]____________[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />NB&#33; BACK UP YOUR SAVE GAME AND .INI FILES FOUND IN C:[user name]My GamesSkyrim (Vista)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />It is a good idea (especially if you have mods and do not know how to manage them properly) to start with a clean copy of Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />If you really cannot be doing with that then AT LEAST delete your Skyrim.ini, SkyrimPrefs.ini and the RenderInfo files so you can set up all the following tweaks and mods with fresh configuration files (can make a BIG difference in stability) REMEMBER: BACK UP BACK UP BACK UP&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I will not get into unistalling mods at this time because if you are not used to doing it (it comes with practice) it can be very complicated to explain for all the many different mods out there which falls a little outside the scope of this guide. It would be a good idea to learn and most mods have installation/uninstallation instructions... remember what I said about instructions? Good :)\r<br />\r<br />If using Nexus Mod Manager... You&#39;re not? Well you should be as not only is it easy to reset ArchiveInvalidation with it, which is essential if adding any mods that add content to the game, but you can also activate and deactivate mods relatively problem free. However please also be aware if you are new to modding, it cannot be guaranteed there will never be residual files or tweaks left behind by NMM that could cause conflicts and ultimately instability so as I have said before... always read instructions&#33;\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE SHOW YOUR APPRECIATION FOR FILES/MODS IF YOU USE THEM AS A LOT OF HARD WORK GOES INTO THEM&#33;\r<br />\r<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager: \r<br />[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/content/modmanager/]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/content/modmanager/[/url]\r<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4] [color=#3d85c6]___[/color] 5. ESSENTIAL FPS BOOST [color=#3d85c6]_______[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />NB&#33; If you have v1.42 or later then ignore this section for now and move on to section 6. NB&#33;\r<br />\r<br />If you have an older version of Skyrim installed then the first thing you should do is read section 14. If you decide not to risk an update then you should at least get TESV Accleration Layer (works on any Skyrim version). For anything before v1.42 then even BETTER is Skyboost. As of 1.42 neither are really necessary as Bethesda have implemented a lot of these fixes officially.\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE:  The authors advise not to use them together. I have not encountered any issues in trying it but did not notice any improvements in doing so either. My advice then is to stick with one to ensure greatest stability&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Get them here: \r<br />\r<br />PLEASE SHOW YOUR APPRECIATION FOR FILES/MODS IF YOU USE THEM AS A LOT OF HARD WORK GOES INTO THEM&#33;\r<br />\r<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />TESV Acceleration Layer: \r<br />[url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1321575-rel-tesv-acceleration-layer/]http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1321575-rel-tesv-acceleration-layer/[/url]\r<br />- or -\r<br />Skyboost r4: \r<br />[url=http://www.dev-c.com/skyrim/skyboost/]http://www.dev-c.com/skyrim/skyboost/[/url]\r<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4] [color=#3d85c6]___[/color] 6. ESSENTIAL VISUAL ENHANCEMENT [color=#3d85c6]__[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />OK the good stuff, for vastly improved lighting and visuals with next to no fps loss I cannot recommend highly enough the following mods:\r<br />\r<br />NB&#33; It is best to back up [b]Skyrim.ini[/b] and [b]SkyrimPrefs.ini[/b] and any other ENBseries or FXAA Injector mods before proceeding.\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />a) [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71029/?]Just ENB and SweetFX for Skyrim[/url] (my personal custom ENB preset)\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />NB&#33; The [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6131/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D6131&pUp=1]ini files[/url] included with this guide are custom tuned to complement the above ENB preset.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: When starting Skyrim up without SKSE after installing ENB mods it might try automatically detect your settings (new d3d9.dll) and put the graphics options available in the Skyrim Launcher (and the SkyrimPrefs.ini) back to default&#33; You will need either re-calibrate or use backups and copy the &#34;sD3DDevice=&#34; value over.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />b) Improved 3rd Person Camera mod\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />This is actually two mods together that centre the 3rd person camera and disables all the automatic zooming in and out nonsense. You can install one or both, up to you :)\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE SHOW YOUR APPRECIATION FOR FILES/MODS IF YOU USE THEM AS A LOT OF HARD WORK GOES INTO THEM&#33;\r<br />\r<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />Camera Tweakage: \r<br />[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4882]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4882[/url]\r<br />-and-\r<br />Instant Camera POV switching: \r<br />[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1661]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1661[/url]\r<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />c) uGrids\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: this setting is locked to the save game. Increasing is not an issue but decreasing will render the save game unable to load.\r<br />\r<br />Do not be scared though as you can easily test this setting without saving and then change it back if your computer says no =D\r<br />\r<br />What the setting does is it adds the rendered area visible to the player. What this means is objects and scenery that were not visible in the distance before or were just featureless blobs will become MUCH more detailed and add huge depth to the world.\r<br />\r<br />Open the Skyrim.ini file and change:\r<br />uExterior Cell Buffer=64\r<br />\r<br />and under it add the line:\r<br />uGridsToLoad=7\r<br />\r<br />Load a game in the world map and switch off all autosave features in the options menu while you run around and see how your computer copes with it. If it dies a death then change then exit and delete the uGridsToLoad=7 line and put uExterior Cell Buffer back to default.\r<br />\r<br />If it works? Be sure and stress test before you save and continue&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4] [color=#3d85c6]___[/color] 7. ESSENTIAL GAMEPLAY ENHANCEMENTS [color=#3d85c6]__[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />a) SKSE (Skyrim Script Extender)\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />Now before we go any further you should install SKSE (Skyrim Script Extender) and just pop that in the Skyrim directory (NOT data folder&#33;). You can then create a shortcut to &#34;skse loader&#34; on your desktop or use Nexus Mod Manager (see section 4) to start Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: All graphics profiles and such should be/are linked to TESV.exe so no complicated hooks involved for any mods in this guide (just thought I would mention that).\r<br />\r<br />Get it here:\r<br />\r<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />[url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]http://skse.silverlock.org/[/url]\r<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />b) Skyrim UI\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: You MUST have SKSE running for this mod to work correctly&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This basically revamps the Skyrim User Interface so everything is easier to get to. Bonus is that it  is fully Mouse+Keyboard and Controller compatible&#33; Essential&#33;\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE SHOW YOUR APPRECIATION FOR FILES/MODS IF YOU USE THEM AS A LOT OF HARD WORK GOES INTO THEM&#33;\r<br />\r<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3863]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3863[/url]\r<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4] [color=#3d85c6]___[/color] 8. SHADOW FIXING [color=#3d85c6]____________[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />I have fiddled with shadows more than anything else in Skyrim and can safely say they are probably the biggest killer of fps in the game. They are far from optimised in the vanilla settings and can look shocking in places even on ULTRA&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Now the thing is I have managed to get them looking good with minimum fps loss, however with other graphics tweaks it always seems to come a performance or quality cost I am not willing to make. In the end I found the default high settings pretty much did the job and then cranked all the other settings (see section 9) and found I can put up with the odd hideous shadow.\r<br />\r<br />For those of you who still want to know and have a crack at it then here are all the tweaks I know about. If you find a magical formula then feel free to share ;)\r<br />\r<br />[b]NB&#33;[/b] If you use ENBs then they have shadow fixing capabilities (see section 6a)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />a) Main Shadow Options\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />In the SkyrimPrefs.ini:\r<br />\r<br />iBlurDeferredShadowMask=0 (ultra sharp and best performance) &#34;5&#34; (best setting for balance of quality and performance) &#34;5+&#34; (do not know limit to this value but can greatly improve blocky shadows especially at lower resolutions BUT it can come at a performance cost with higher resolutions)*****\r<br />\r<br />fInteriorShadowDistance=3000.0000 only decrease if you are struggling indoors\r<br />\r<br />fShadowDistance=4000.0000 good balance between visuals and performance (the further the shadow draw distance the more depth on the sreen, BUT costs a lot of fps and in some cases shadows will become more blocky resulting in having to use iBlurDeferredShadowMask to compensate decreasing performance even more&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />bTreesReceiveShadows=1 (for eye candy) 0 (for performance)\r<br />\r<br />bDrawLandShadows=1 (for eye candy) 0 (for performance)\r<br />\r<br />iShadowMaskQuarter=4 (good quality and gives good performance) &#34;3, 2 and 1&#34; (shimmering shadows but may increase performance) &#34;5+&#34; (if your computer can handle it, try it) &#34;0&#34; (disables interior shadows)\r<br />\r<br />iShadowMapResolution=2048 (512, 1024, 2056, 4096 8192 - main factor that determines shadow quality and works in tandem with iBlurDefferedShadowMask - see below)\r<br />\r<br />***** The way this works is that when you decrease iShadowMapResolution you can increase iBlurDeferredShadowMask to blur shadows almost completely out of focus and make them look a little more like shadows than Tetris blocks.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />b) Shimmering Shadows\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />Now in Skyrim.ini add the following lines under display to fix shadow shimmering when the sun moves:\r<br />\r<br />fSunShadowUpdateTime=0.25 how often the movement of the sun updates (this value calculates at roughly every 15 minutes in game-time)\r<br />\r<br />fSunUpdateThreshold=1.5 this seems to increase the speed of the update and should also fix flickering shadows when the sun moves\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4] [color=#3d85c6]___ [/color]9. nVidia GRAPHICS SETTINGS [color=#3d85c6]____[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]NB&#33; [/b]If using an ENB then all Anti Aliasing, Anisotropic  Filtering and other graphics settings are handled by the ENB engine or you will get glitches and performance issues. For a detailed guide and my own personal tuned ENB preset check out [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71029/?]Just ENB and SweetFX for Skyrim[/url] and ready tweaked [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6131/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D6131&pUp=1]ini files[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Make sure you get a fast but bearable mix of SHADOW FIXES (see section 8) as they are the main culprits of fps drops. Once I fine tuned my settings I gained a big leap in average fps (around 10+ in places). You should then be then able to really have fun and start cranking up other graphics settings (see below) and not only will it look awesome, but it should remain a lot smoother as well&#33;\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: Look at my rig settings in section 3 and adjust settings appropriately to your hardware. To help you I have put the settings in order of how much effect they have on fps if you increase or decrease them. \r<br />\r<br />Enabled:\r<br />\r<br />a) Resolution 1280x800 [5 - 25+ fps]\r<br />b) in-game 2x AA (smooth edges 2x, 4x ,8x) [5 - 20 fps]\r<br />c) View distances are on high default [5 - 15 fps]\r<br />d) nVidia &#34;performance&#34; Ambient Occlusion (see section 10) [3 - 10 fps]\r<br />e) 2x SuperSampling AA (in nVidia Control Panel - really needed to prevent noise in forested areas) [2 - 10 fps]\r<br />f) nVidia 16x AF (in nVidia Control Panel) [2 - 5 fps]\r<br />g) Quality Texture Filtering (nVidia Control Panel) [1 - 3 fps]\r<br />h) in-game FXAA (applies good and fast AA to everything including post processing and only causes bigger fps hits if used with &#34;normal&#34; in-game AA) [1 - 2 fps]\r<br />i) LOD Bias CLAMPED [&lt;1fps]\r<br />\r<br />It is worth of mention I use most of the &#34;lite&#34; versions of the high-res texture mods too. They are not the highest of course but are miles better than vanilla and look amazing&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Even on my limited rig this game now runs like a hot knife through butter EVERYWHERE&#33; Rarely drops below 30 fps in even the most intense places&#33; And looks bloody amazing&#33; If you have a better rig imagine the possibilities =D \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4] [color=#3d85c6]___[/color] 10. AMBIENT OCCLUSION [color=#3d85c6]________[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]NB&#33; [/b]If using an ENB then its own Ambient Occlusion engine will look much better. The nVidia Graphics Settings is a little faster though. In either case do not use both or you will get performance issues for sure&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I am unsure of Ambient Occlusion support with ATI cards at the moment and I think some ATI users feel a little short changed by a lack of support for their cards. This is one of the reasons I had to give up on a long relationship with ATI and went to the Dark Side =D\r<br />\r<br />For nVidia users:\r<br />\r<br />Ambient Occlusion is basically a way of making lighting react naturally to its environment. In other words objects will have different light levels depending where they are relative to light sources. What does that mean? It means the game will look a LOT more real and objects will look more like they are actually in the environment and not &#34;floating&#34;. Try it and see what I mean, its hard to go back...\r<br />\r<br />The technology was not originally supported in Skyrim and is so far still not supported in their WHQL drivers. However new beta drivers (don&#39;t worry they are very stable) have come out to support it:\r<br />\r<br />Download from here:\r<br />\r<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />[url=http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx]http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx[/url]\r<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />\r<br />Enter your system details and look for a driver with the build number 290.53 and do a custom clean install.\r<br />\r<br />All good? No, because Ambient Occlusion is a jammy bugger and is FAR from perfect. However, we can tweak it to look NEARLY perfect. In the nVidia Control Panel in the &#34;Game Profiles&#34; we need to select &#34; Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim&#34; (if its not there then just add it). \r<br />\r<br />Ambient Occlusion options include &#34;Performance&#34; and &#34;Quality&#34;. Quality is best by far BUT it will trash the FPS on everything except the most powerful systems. On &#34;Performance&#34; the fps stays almost unaffected BUT it shimmers horribly. Fix? Yes.\r<br />\r<br />Select &#34;Performace&#34;, exit and then get this:\r<br />\r<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />nVidia Inspector: \r<br />[url=http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/nvidia-inspector-download.html]http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/nvidia-inspector-download.html[/url]\r<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />\r<br />It opens self conatained (awsome). In here we can go into configuration and select &#34;Elder Scrolls V Skyrim&#34; again but we have a lot more options. What we need to do is change the ambient occlusion PROFILE to &#34;Call of Duty 6 Modern Warfare II&#34; (as in the STEP guide - see Credits). Shimmering is not gone... but almost forgotten :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4] [color=#3d85c6]___[/color] 11. SMOOTH FPS [color=#3d85c6]______________[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]NB&#33; [/b]If using an ENB then all FPS Management and related settings are handled by the ENB engine or you will get glitches and performance issues. For a detailed guide and my own personal tuned ENB preset check out [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71029/?]Just ENB and SweetFX for Skyrim[/url] and ready tweaked [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6131/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D6131&pUp=1]ini files[/url].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: It is a very common issue that particular areas in Skyrim (certain dungeons) cause silly slow downs for no apparent reason&#33; They are not game breaking issues but can be annoying if you think you are the only one having them. YOU ARE NOT ALONE&#33; These appear to be faults with the game engine itself and are so far unfixable.  There will no doubt be mods out soon to help with these issues and there is a new official patch imminent that claims to address these issues BUT time will tell and make sure you have noted my advice in section 13&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Most of the game is fine but there is still nothing more annoying than getting 60fps in some areas and 30 in others because (as with most Bethesda games) this causes juddering and lag which totally diminishes the immersion. If you followed the steps in section 9 this is easy :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />a) Limit FPS\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />In the same place we changed the Ambient Occlusion Profile, further down there is a Limit FPS option. I would suggest you go about half way between your minimum and maximum. Even better is to find your average and be sure to test it out in multiple areas with lots of stuff happening on screen to get the best results. To do this you need a program called FRAPS:\r<br />\r<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />FRAPS:\r<br />[url=http://www.fraps.com/]http://www.fraps.com/[/url]\r<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />\r<br />I use 35 fps. Once benchmarked and fps limit has been applied game will run A LOT smoother. I mean proper SMOOTH&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />b)Still Lagging?\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />In the nVidia Control Panel under your Skyrim profile you could also decrease the maximum number of frames to render ahead to 2 or even 1 to reduce any input lag.\r<br />\r<br />I you are still struggling then try to Force V-Sync off in the nVidia Control Panel (causes unsightly tearing IMO) and if you still get lag then change bMouseAcceleration=1 to bMouseAcceleration=0.\r<br />\r<br />If you are STILL getting  bad lag then you need to move onto section 13 and/or lower your graphics settings.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4] [color=#3d85c6]___[/color] 12. TEXTURE MODS [color=#3d85c6]____________[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: Texture mods can really transform Skyrim BUT they can come at a cost of being more demanding. Having ample memory is ESSENTIAL so if you are to use them be sure to follow section 13 to activate the 3GB switch and minimise Windows resources.\r<br />\r<br />At this point we take a detour to the STEP (Skyrim Total Enhancement Project) because the author (The Compiler) has created the most comprehensive list of compatible texture mods on the Nexus. Read the advice on FPS hits and pay special care in your installation order (just move down the list). My personal advice would be to use NMM and to consider &#34;lite&#34; versions of texture mods and skip ones your are not too bothered about unless you know your system can handle it.\r<br />\r<br />The textures part of the guide is Step 4 on page 9 but you may want to investigate the rest of the guide too as it covers a lot of ground.\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE SHOW YOUR APPRECIATION FOR FILES/MODS IF YOU USE THEM AS A LOT OF HARD WORK GOES INTO THEM&#33;\r<br />\r<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />STEP (Skyrim Total Enhancement Project):\r<br />[url=http://wiki.step-project.com/Special:RunQuery/ModListQuery]http://wiki.step-project.com/Special:RunQuery/ModListQuery[/url]\r<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />\r<br />For example, you can run the query &#34;Core&#34; and &#34;OrderID&#34; for a basic mod package shown in the order of installation&#33; Amazing&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4] [color=#3d85c6]___[/color] 13. CTD FIXING [color=#3d85c6]_______________[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This is NOT just a collection of CTD fixes but things that should be performed anyway as there is the potential to drastically improve performance too&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Right, now among the MANY reasons why you may be suffering a CTD (Crash To Desktop) or other major performance issues, the type of CTD I wrote specifically for is the common CTD (with no errors) problem. That is the game will just shutdown with no warning and no error message&#33; However, as stated, the following may help fix a variety of other CTD issues.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />a) Make Skyrim Large Address Aware and activate 3GB switch\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />NB&#33; LAA requires at least 4GB RAM and [u][b]IS NOT required on 64-bit systems[/b][/u]&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Now the LAA patch released with the Official 1.3 version of Skyrim is only half a fix if you own a 32bit operating system. In fact its completely useless as it may not be common knowledge that the LAA patch/fix is like a dog without a bone if you have not enabled the 3GB switch. You can find a tutorial here: \r<br />\r<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />3GB Switch Tutorial:\r<br />[url=http://scorpion.tordivel.no/help/GettingStarted/3gswitch.htm]http://scorpion.tordivel.no/help/GettingStarted/3gswitch.htm[/url]\r<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />\r<br />I found that the (possible) reason for this CTD was that as soon as Skyrim hits a certain RAM usage on your machine it will just die... 4GB is almost mandatory, especially if you intend on using any mods. If you plan on using a fair amount of texture mods then you MAY also want to turn off Low Memory warnings as well as it behaves a little hyper-actively. \r<br />\r<br />To do this on XP/VISTA/Win 7: \r<br />\r<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />Suppress Low Memory Warning:\r<br />[url=http://superuser.com/questions/41789/how-to-suppress-low-memory-warnings-in-vista-home-premium-when-running-without]http://superuser.com/questions/41789/how-to-suppress-low-memory-warnings-in-vista-home-premium-when-running-without[/url] \r<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />\r<br />Its more difficult in Windows 8 and 10 without Group Policy Editor...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />b) Optimise Windows environment\r<br />&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;\r<br />\r<br />If you do not have 4GB RAM I suggest you get some. If you refuse, or cannot afford it (its actually really cheap) then you can try the following to try improve things.\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: Even with 4GB or more it is probably a good idea to follow these tips so as to get the most out of your system.\r<br />\r<br />a) Defrag (duh&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />b) Disable &#34;fancy&#34; features of Windows (resource hogs&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />c) Get rid of unnecessary startup programs and other stuff in Windows that you don&#39;t need/use (common consensus is avoid using msconfig.exe and instead disable the program from within or use something like Autoruns: [url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902]http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902[/url])\r<br />\r<br />d) Increase Virtual Memory\r<br />\r<br />e) Turn off System Restore, Error Reporting, Auto Defrag, Auto Update, Indexing.\r<br />\r<br />f) Do NOT turn off SuperFetch, ReadyBoot, Pagefile etc... may work for some but they should increase speed and stability the more you play Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />g) Defrag again&#33;\r<br />\r<br />h) Try lower res texture versions of mods.\r<br />\r<br />i) Delete heavily modified ini files, start up to get fresh ones, start low and build up applying edits you [b][u]need[/u] [/b]or know are stable&#33;\r<br />\r<br />j) Priority switches may be counter productive on some systems (Bethesda games can be very sensitive to stuff like this)\r<br />\r<br />k) I understand many people use Game Booster (myself included at one point) and can increase performance a little this way (thanks for clarifying that for me MShoap13) but just make sure it runs ALL the time not just when you &#34;run a game&#34; (Steam causes Game Booster to start and stop) and make sure you know what you are doing before you try tweaking beyond the default stuff) \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4] [color=#3d85c6]___[/color] 14. AVOIDING FUTURE PROBLEMS [color=#3d85c6]__[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />STEAM AUTO UPDATE&#33;\r<br />\r<br />If you use a lot of mods and got everything humming along nicely then you may want to avoid updating the game.  This is because settings and/or current mods may not be compatible with the new patches to begin with. Also, as with the patches released so far, they may fix issues for some but may be game breaking for others. You can avoid updates by opening Steam in offline mode and choose &#34;Do Not Automatically Update This Game&#34; from game preferences to avoid problems\r<br />\r<br />If you feel you must or find out you need to update then i would advise:\r<br />\r<br />a) Unequip and store everything you can\r<br />\r<br />b) Find a small interior unrelated to quests and empty\r<br />\r<br />c) Wait between 3 and 31 days... longer the better (Try [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12625/?]this[/url])\r<br />\r<br />d) Hard save (not quicksave&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />e) Back up all save game files and .ini files.\r<br />\r<br /> f) Back up SkyrimLauncher.exe, TESV.exe and Update.esm (Data folder)\r<br />\r<br />f) Update Skyrim in Steam.\r<br />\r<br />g) Load game and wait between 3 and 31 days again and then save.\r<br />\r<br />h) Check your settings and test mods in game for any obvious [u]new[/u] bugs/changes the update might have caused.\r<br />\r<br />i) Pray you don&#39;t run into any more problems...\r<br /> \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4][color=#3d85c6] ___[/color] 15.
