  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=4]A NOTE REGARDING THIS AND MY OTHER MODS: I will not be putting out any new versions of Lydia The Unburdened, Shakuntala or Visarra until I upgrade my PC sometime early next year. I will not return to Skyrim until that time (I still have Dragonborn and Falskaar to finish so I have plenty reason to return) so I can play / run in full Ultra settings.

Lost and unable to return to her stronghold due to being on the run from her father, she can hear the villagers across the water, but stays hidden. Visarra was one of many of the chief&#39;s daughters, but the only one to resist the traditional orc ways. Long a thorn in her father&#39;s side, she drew the line at being given away as property to a neighboring chief to become just another one of his wives. Strong-willed and independant, she longs for adventure and battle, her bloodlust rarely sated. Deep in her heart, she longs for a true companion who will treat her with honor, with which to share her years, all the while fearing what will happen if her father should find her.\r<br />\r<br />Visarra is a female orc follower who is a true warrior. One-handed weapons and shields are her choice of weapons, and she will stop at nothing to protect her allies. Loyal to her last breath, but unable to continue to live under the laws her stronghold laid down, Visarra escaped in the night and wanders Tamriel seeking a new life. Now lost outside of Riverwood, perhaps the Dovakhiin can give her what she seeks.\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Try my other mods&#33;\r<br />\r<br />LYDIA THE UNBURDENED - Turn Lydia into a 7ft tall Nordic Barbarian.\r<br />@Skyrim Nexus: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20107\r<br />@Steam Workshop: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=80815442\r<br />\r<br />SHAKUNTALA THE ROGUE - Beautiful high-elf companion who has no morals and no remorse.
