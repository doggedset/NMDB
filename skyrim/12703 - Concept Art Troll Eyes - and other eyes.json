  "descriptionHtml": "http://images.uesp.net/c/c0/SR-concept-Frost_Troll_Fight.jpg\r\n\r\nConcept art shows a troll with yellow eyes. Instead, we found that trolls ended up with blank pits for eyes when Skyrim was released. I hated it, so the eyes on the textures of Frost Trolls and Cave Trolls have been edited into six choices including the concept art eyes.\r\n\r\nThese texture files are high resolution based, saved as DXT5 Interpolated Alpha.\r\n\r\nInstallation for main file:\r\n\r\nBe sure that you don\\'t already have textures for troll.dds and troll_cave.dds in your textures/actors/troll folder. If it is empty, then that is good. If not, then you will have decisions to make.\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to your Skyrim/textures/actors/troll folder.\r\n2. If it does not exist then recreate the folder structure.\r\n3. From the zip, navigate to the actors folder and open the troll eyes folder of your choice.\r\n4. Drag the contents of that folder into your troll folder, the one mentioned in step 1.\r\n\r\nInstallation for Dawnguard update:\r\n\r\nBe sure that you don\\'t already have textures for armoredfrosttroll.dds and armeredcavetroll.dds in your textures/dlc01/actors/armoredtroll folder. If it is empty, then good. If not, then you will have decisions to make. You should back up armoredfrosttroll.dds and armoredcavetroll.dds before installing these.\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to your Skyrim/textures/dlc01/actors/armoredtroll folder.\r\n2. If it does not exist then recreate the folder structure.\r\n3. From the zip, navigate to the actors folder and open the troll eyes folder of your choice.\r\n4. Drag the contents of that folder into your armoredtroll folder, the one mentioned in step 1.\r\n\r\nNote on the Dawnguard update:\r\n\r\nI do not have Dawnguard, so Al99 provided me the textures via file download. They were medium resolution. So I layered them over the high resolution textures from the HD pack. Now they are high res textures with the eyes. Because of the limited layer choices in Photoshop 7, there were some moderate changes to the troll fur ( not able to keep all dirt and lessened shadow effect on the cave troll ). But it shouldn\\'t be much too of a difference.",
