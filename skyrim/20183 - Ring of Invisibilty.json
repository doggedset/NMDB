  "summary": "Ring that makes the wearer permanently invisible.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Another very simple ring made by me.\r\n\r\nMakes the wearer completely invisible, much like the Chameleon effect in TESIV.\r\n\r\nTested to make sure it works wonderfully, swing, interact, talk, etc. and you WILL stay invisible.\r\n\r\nI would consider this a cheat, as it removes a lot of the game.\r\n\r\nCompletely compatible with every one of my current, and future ring mods, as well as any other mod. (Be careful though, with any mod that messes with invisibilty)\r\n\r\nTo obtain, either console (help Invisible, page until you see Ring of Invisibility, player.additem ##000D64, ## is the load order.)\r\nOr go to Dragonsreach, and on the first table to the right, it will be there chillin\\'\r\n\r\nDo with it what you will, it\\'s just a ring :)\r\n",
