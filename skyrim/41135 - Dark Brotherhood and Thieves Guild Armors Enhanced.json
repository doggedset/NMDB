  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#1e90ff][u][b][size=5]Description[/size][/b][/u][/color]\r\nDid you ever feel that the enchantments on the DB and TG armors were a bit underpowered and had some pointless enchantments? Whenever I play as a thief I like to keep immersion by wearing the guilds armor but at a point the armor is so obsolete you just have to switch. This mods aims to change that by adding a total of 8 new sets of armors to the game with various enchantments. Below is a description of all of the armors.\r\n[color=#1e90ff][u][b][size=3]Thieves Guild Armor[/size][/b][/u][/color]\r\n-All of the new sets are available in The Ragged Flagon Cistern training room.\r\n-The first set has much more powerful enchantments than the original and will be given to you when you join the guild. \r\n-The second set is much like the first set except with different enchantments.\r\n-The third set is for those who think the first two sets are overpowered. The enchantments are just a bit stronger than the original but they are much more useful.\r\n-The fourth set is an unenchanted and craftable set. In order to craft the armor, you will need the thieves guild tokens found in one of chests in the cistern. This is just to ensure that non-guild members can\\'t craft thieves guild armor.\r\n-Also included is the guilds old armor.\r\n[color=#1e90ff][u][b][size=3]Dark Brotherhood Armor[/size][/b][/u][/color]\r\n-All of the new sets are available in The Falkreath or Dawnstar Sanctuary.\r\n-The first set has much more powerful enchantments than the original and will be given to you when you join the brotherhood.\r\n-The second set is much like the first set except with different enchantments.\r\n-The third set is for those who think the first two sets are overpowered. The enchantments are just a bit stronger than the original but they are much more useful.\r\n-The fourth set is an unenchanted and craftable set. In order to craft the armor, you will need the dark brotherhood guild tokens found in one of chests in the sanctuary. This is just to ensure that non-guild members can\\'t craft Dark Brotherhood armor.\r\n-Also included is the brotherhood\\'s old armor.\r\n[color=#1e90ff][u][b][size=3]Nightingale Armor[/size][/b][/u][/color]\r\n-Changes the enchantments of the Nightingale Armor to be much more powerful.\r\n\r\n[color=#1e90ff][u][b][size=5]Install/Uninstall[/size][/b][/u][/color]\r\nRecommended: Use NMM.\r\nManual: Place the .esp file into your data folder (yourskyrimdirectoryhere/data).\r\nUninstall: If you used NMM then deactivate it, if you installed manually then delete the .esp file.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/6888730/?tb=mods&pUp=1][b][size=5]Check Out My Mods[/size][/b][/url]",
