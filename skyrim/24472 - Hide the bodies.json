  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Ih3F6.png[/img][/center]\r\n[center][i]A really simple and convenient way to hide the corpse of your victims.[/i][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][b]DESCRIPTION[/b] : Adds a new book close to Riverwood that will teach you how to hide a body.[/center]\r\n\r\n[center]_________________________________________________________________________________[/center]\r\n\r\n[center][b]DETAILS :[/b] Animations and small visual effects [i]( to hide popping and transitions )[/i] are included, but don\\'t expect something really fancy. Pretty straightforward right now. \r\n\r\nI\\'m open for everything, but keep in mind that my scripting abilities are [b]really[/b] limited. What can i say, i can\\'t into Papyrus. [i]Still, i will try to do my best to include good ideas and suggestions.[/i] [/center]\r\n\r\n[center][b]HOW DOES IT WORK[/b] : The first step is to find the book that will teach you the \\\" voice / spell \\\". You can\\'t really miss it.[/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/o8tUg.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][b]It\\'s working like a shout, you will have to select the spell in the magic tab and press your shout key to trigger the actual effect. Like any regular shout.[/b]\r\n\r\nSecond step is to find a body, aim at it and get somewhat close to it, and press your shout key. \r\n\r\nEnjoy ![/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/6P6iy.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/bddyY.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/OKiEq.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][b]CONDITIONS & ADVANCED DETAILS[/b] : \r\n\r\n? Your weapon should not be drawn, otherwise nothing will happen.\r\n? You have to be somewhat close to the body otherwise nothing will happen.\r\n\r\n? Yes, you can hide everything. Even dragons. Why ? Well you tell me. [i]Subject to change if it bothers people.[/i]\r\n? Yes, the bloodstains and other decals will stay where they are. The mod will only disable the \\\" selected \\\" body and nothing else. \r\n\r\n? Don\\'t forget to loot the body or [i]whatever you have to do[/i] before hiding it. Once it\\'s gone, it\\'s [b]gone.[/b]\r\n\r\n?Trying to hide something that is still alive will... not work ( aeueueaeue ).\r\n\r\n[b]INSTALLATION[/b] : Use NMM or drag & drop the Data folder into your main Skyrim folder. Activate the hidebodies.esp before launching the game.\r\n\r\n[b]COMPATIBILITY[/b] : \r\n\r\nI\\'m waiting for the first feedback. But honestly i don\\'t see how this mod could conflict with [b]anything[/b] else. \r\n\r\n[b]LAST WORDS[/b] : \r\n\r\nHope you will enjoy hiding everything as much as i do. \r\n\r\n[i]If you think the mod is worth your endorse... well endorse ![/i][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
