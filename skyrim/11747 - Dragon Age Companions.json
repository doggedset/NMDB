  "descriptionHtml": "DRAGON AGE COMPANIONS-  \r\nLeliana, Morrigan, Isabela, Alistair, and Fenris.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATED 8/20/13!!! \r\n**All followers should now have the proper hairstyle/color WITHOUT installing Apachii Skyhair\r\n\r\nNOTE:  I am no longer working on adding voices to the characters due to legal complications in using voice files directly from the Dragon Age games.  Sorry not my fault ;_;\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-REPLACEMENT NPC FOLLOWERS\r\n\r\nThis is my first uploaded mod for Skyrim... Though I\\'ve done some small tweaks for my own use in the past.  I\\'m still getting used to the Skyrim creation kit.   And yes I know they don\\'t look EXACTLY like the original characters but I did my best with the current limitations of Skyrim\\'s character creator.  At the very least this adds new sexy followers for you : )\r\n\r\nAll companions can be found in a camp across the river and slightly SW of Riverwood, you should see a marker on your map.\r\n\r\n**MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE ALL YOUR GEAR FROM FOLLOWERS DISMISS ALL CURRENT FOLLOWERS BEFORE INSTALLING THIS MOD!\r\n\r\n**ALSO DELETE ALL OLD VERSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n!!!REQUESTING HELP!!! \r\n\r\nThis is still at WIP.  If anyone is good at creating meshes (for a proper hairstyle), tattoos or just wants to help feel free to contact me :)  I could also use some help crafting a purty webpage. \r\n\r\nDon\\'t think my versions of the characters match up to your expectations???  Then Help!\r\n  - Create your version of the character in Skyrim\r\n  - Hit the tilde key ( ~ ) \r\n  - Type \\\"savepcface charactername\\\" without the quotes\r\n  - Take a screenshot\r\n  - Send me the resulting files (found in your Skyrim data folder) and I\\'ll get back to you.  If your creation is good enough I\\'ll implement it in this mod and you\\'ll get credit : )\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know of any bugs.  Especially issues with face and body textures not matching up, grey faces, or hairstyles being wonky.  I had to jury-rig some stuff and I\\'m not sure how that will effect the appearance on everyone else\\'s machines.\r\n\r\n...REQUIRED/SUGGESTED DOWNLOADS...\r\n\r\n\r\nApachii Skyhair (I don\\'t know what Vanilla hairstyles the followers will show up with).  \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\n\r\nBetter Female Faces by Bella:  I used makeup version 3.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\n\r\nBetter males: I used \\\"Younger faces merged with men\\\" by Genox \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488\r\n\r\nTo make some of the elves look better I used vanilla human races... to add elf ears simply download Nouserheres Ears and add to the desired companions.  \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21459\\\"\r\n\r\n...SUGGESTED ARMORS...\r\n\r\n- Isabela – \r\n\r\nField mage outfit by ECHO\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14198//?\r\n… also downloaded white retexture\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18105//?\r\n\r\n- Fenris – \r\n\r\nDread Hunter Armor… http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21125/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fid%3D21125%26user%3D1&pUp=1\r\n\r\n- Hawke (F&M) - \r\n\r\nMercenary Armor:  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5588/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fid%3D5588%26user%3D1&pUp=1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun and happy questing!\r\n-Revras\r\n",
