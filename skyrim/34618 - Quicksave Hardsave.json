These copies will remain intact when you quicksave again, meaning that every time you quicksave, you have a permanently available save instead of only one which will be overwritten when you quicksave again.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#00ff00][size=3]3: Installation[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />Download one of the two main files. Put the .exe file contained within and the file named &#34;Quicksave Hardsave.txt&#34; into the folder where your saves are.\r<br />\r<br />If you want this to automatically run, then right-click the exe, and choose &#34;create shortcut&#34;. Move this new shortcut to your startup folder. Your startup folder can be found in different places depending on your OS.\r<br />Windows 7/8: &#34;C:&#92;Users&#92;{Username}&#92;AppData&#92;Roaming&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;Start Menu&#92;Programs&#92;Startup&#34; (make sure you replace {Username} with your username).\r<br />Now, whenever you log on, it&#39;ll run this in the background so that when you play, it&#39;ll already be there. It doesn&#39;t use much in the way of resources, so you shouldn&#39;t need to worry about it slowing down your computer.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#00ff00][size=3]4: Uninstallation[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />Delete the three files created above (if it&#39;s running, you need to find it in your notification area, where you&#39;ll right-click it and choose close first).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#00ff00][size=3]5: Compatibility[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />This is compatible with all mods as far as I know. SKSE creates an extra file upon saving, and this file is taken into account. I don&#39;t know of any other mods which modify save-game files.\r<br />\r<br />This is compatible with Mod Organizer, but because of how Mod Organizer tracks profiles, you&#39;ll need to put a new copy of this utility into each profile&#39;s save-game folder. These can be found in &#34;[Mod Organizer]&#92;Profiles&#92;{Profile name}&#92;Saves&#34;. I have a file which will monitor the profiles and take care of all of this for you. PM me and I&#39;ll send you a copy. I don&#39;t want to upload it publicly until I have some verification by at least one other MO user that it works on a machine other than mine.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#00ff00][size=3]6: Bugs[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />In-game, the numbers will not progress correctly. Correcting this would require editing the saves, and that&#39;s an area I&#39;m not going to venture into.\r<br />\r<br />If you use the rename version, then you are less likely to encounter save-game corruption from the quicksaves overwriting one another (something I&#39;ve never experienced anyway). However, you will also be unable to quickload. This may also cause the game to not automatically load your last save when you die. There are no easy ways to fix these, except by using the copy version.\r<br />",
