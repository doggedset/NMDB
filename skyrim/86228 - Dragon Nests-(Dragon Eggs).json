Also they are decorated with trunks, branches and rocks to make the structure of the nests that harbor the eggs. There are also dead animals, bones and blood scattered around to simulate the hunt of dragons over other creatures.\r<br />\r<br />The dragon mother is not alone, and is that her offspring that is already out of the eggs is kept close to the nest until reaching full maturity, and then leave the nest. For this reason you will not find adult dragons in these places besides the Dragon Mother, however if there are newborn (very small) dragons, baby dragons, young dragons and subadult dragons who are almost already adults.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]Attention&#33; Danger to death:[/size][/color] Under no circumstances try to fight any of the  [color=#ff0000]Supreme Mothers[/color] until you are at least level 70&#33; These dragons are level 80 and have unique breaths and unique abilities, are very powerful creatures and are created only to protect the nest or combat with the highest level players, the most experienced or the hardcore players&#33;. If you want to steal eggs you can try, you&#39;ll have to get the mother to become distracted and then run to the nest, steal as many as you can and then run&#33; Do not stop running&#33;.\r<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/86225-1-1503479592.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/86225-16-1503468612.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/86225-0-1503479592.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />You can have fun killing small dragons, but never get too close to the nest unnecessarily or alert the supreme mother&#33;\r<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/86225-6-1503468621.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Nests were specially placed in remote places where there are not many human settlements nearby, nor missions, but you may have to pass through the territory of some supreme mother. In that case you have 2 options:\r<br />1-Wait until you have a higher level to withstand attacks and pass\r<br />2-Try to do it, but always save before. Most likely, you and the mission NPCs will die out again and again.\r<br />\r<br />Even eggs are only a valuable alchemical ingredient, which can be used to reach high levels in other areas, have a good value in gold also, however most likely later the eggs the player can open them by hitting them with a spell Its corresponding element (Fire, Frost, etc.) and will be born a small dragon that will help you in any combat that you are facing, however this would already require scripts so when it does, it will only be optional.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[img]http://static-8.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/38488-4-1374347773.png[/img]\r<br />[color=orangered][size=5][b]Requirements:[/b][/size][/color][size=3][b]\r<br />[url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Dawnguard]Dawnguard DLC [/url]\r<br />[url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V%3A_Dragonborn]Dragonborn DLC \r<br />[/url][/b][/size][b][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38488/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D38488%26preview%3D&pUp=1]Deadliest Dragons Mod[/url][/size][/b]\r<br />This is not negotiable, if you do not meet these requirements the mod failed.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ea9999]Deadliest Dragons does not support another mod that adds dragons to Skyrim, it only supports mods that modify the vanilla dragons of the game (which does not eliminate either).[/color]\r<br />\r<br />I strongly recommend that if you have another dragon mod and that&#39;s why you do not want to install Deadliest Dragons, you try at least, since my mod does not have scripts, you can uninstall it without any risk for your game and return to your previous mod, just follow The uninstallation instructions. It&#39;s worth a try&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][color=#ffff00]This mod is also free of scripts[/color][/b][/size], so you can install and uninstall anytime without any risk.\r<br />\r<br />Steps to install:[list][*]Download the Master File.\r<br />[*]Unzip the files &#34;Deadliest Dragons-Dragon Nests.esm&#34; and &#34;Deadliest Dragons-Dragon Nests.bsa&#34; in your &#34;data&#34; folder of Skyrim\r<br />[*]Enable the mod in the &#34;SkyrimLauncher.exe&#34;\r<br />[*]Put the mod &#34;Deadliest Dragons-Dragon Nests&#34; the higher up in the order, just after Deadliest Dragons, should look like this:\r<br />[/list]    -Dawnguard.esm  \r<br />    -Dragonborn.esm\r<br />    -Deadliest Dragons.esm\r<br />    -DeadliestDragons-Dragon Nests.esm\r<br />    -............\r<br />    -.......\r<br />    -........\r<br />\r<br />[line][img]http://static-8.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/38488-5-1374347773.png[/img]\r<br />To update the version of Dragon Nests simply delete your files and place the new ones.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=Springgreen]Updates:[/color][/b]\r<br />[b]- Version 1.0[/b] (Initial)\r<br />\r<br />[line][img]http://static-8.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/38488-1-1374347491.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Enter any room or cave (interior), save and exit game. Now delete the mod files and continue with your game.\r<br />\r<br />[line][img]http://static-8.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/38488-2-1374347491.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[b]The mod is highly compatible with any other. Dragon Nests does not edit any Skyrim quest or referral list, and does not modify the terrain or cells or absolutely any of the base game or DLC, it only adds nests and new dragons and entities, so it is 100% compatible with others Mod, if your game has problems, the fault is not of this mod. [color=#ffff00][size=3](Cleaned with TES5EDIT)[/size][/color][/b]",
