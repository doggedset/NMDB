  "descriptionHtml": "[color=Aqua]____________[/color]\r<br />[color=Aqua][b]UNBURDENED[/b][/color]\r<br />Adds 3 new [color=#ffe599][i]channeled[/i][/color] &#39;feather&#39; spells to Alteration that reduce your encumbrance... or to put it another way, increase your maximum carry weight and grant small speed buffs. \r<br />There are other mods that add similar spells, but I wanted to make my own because I felt that a channeled spell that also gives a speed boost would be more pleasing. I&#39;ve really tried to make these spells &#39;feel cool&#39; to use.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve spent many hours balancing them and getting them to work, and I think they are really nice now. A non-mage character can, with a bit of difficulty, use these spells to haul all that junk out of a dungeon to their horse. Anything more than a short burst of movement and they will soon run low on magicka.\r<br />An experienced mage however can channel these spells for quite some time for some very nice speed buffs (useful for combat hmm), especially if they are well versed in Alteration.\r<br />Care has also been given to make these level your alteration skill in a balanced manner.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=Aqua]LIGHTEN LOAD - Apprentice[/color]\r<br />Reduces encumbrance by 25 and grants a 10% speed boost.\r<br />If dual cast (with perk) this translates to 62 carry weight, and 25% speed boost.\r<br />\r<br />[color=Aqua]EASE BURDEN - Adept[/color]\r<br />Reduces encumbrance by 50 and grants a 15% speed boost.\r<br />If dual cast this translates to 125 carry weight, and 37.5% speed boost.\r<br />\r<br />[color=Aqua]PACK MULE - Expert[/color]\r<br />Reduces encumbrance by 100 and grants a 20% speed boost.\r<br />If dual cast this translates to 250 carry weight, and 50% speed boost.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=Aqua]_______________[/color]\r<br />[color=Aqua][b]INSTALLATION[/b][/color]\r<br />Use NMM...\r<br />Manual? Drop the esp in your /data folder, activate it in launcher.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=Aqua]_____________________[/color]\r<br />[color=Aqua][b]GETTING THE SPELLS[/b][/color]\r<br />The spells are sold by the College of Winterholds Alteration master, Tolfdir.\r<br />If you can&#39;t wait then open the console and type help &#34;Lighten Load&#34;, find the spell tome entry and then type player.additem (entry number) 1.\r<br />Repeat for the other two tomes.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=Aqua]________________________________[/color]\r<br />[color=Aqua][b]Compatibility/Recommendations[/b][/color]\r<br />I run this with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63246/?]Awakened Magicka[/url].\r<br />Bashed patch should sort any conflicts with tolfdir. I will be releasing my own personal levelled list version soon.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=Aqua]_______[/color]\r<br />[color=Aqua][b]Thanks[/b][/color]\r<br />Thanks to Theroguex for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10871]Feather Spells and Tomes[/url]. I looked to that mod for Inspiration/to learn some things I wasn&#39;t sure how to do, if Unburdened isn&#39;t for you perhaps that mod will be.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to the thousands of nameless forum people I saw while googling a fix to the speedmult problem.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=Aqua]_______________[/color]\r<br />[color=Aqua][b]Future Plans[/b][/color]\r<br />I&#39;m planning on adding quite a few more spells to the game to make the other schools viable for full use. I&#39;m also hoping that I can make another alteration spell to permanently alter the weight of items.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thats about it, Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />PS: I&#39;m a total noob at this side of modding, so if any experts around here want to take a look at the mod and check it over please do&#33; Everything seems to work fine though :D",
