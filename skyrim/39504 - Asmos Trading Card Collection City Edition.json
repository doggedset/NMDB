  "descriptionHtml": "NOTE: REQUIRES THE MASTER FILE HERE - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/40465/?\r<br />\r<br />Bandit Edition is out&#33; Download with the full master collection here&#33; - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40465/?\r<br />\r<br />Welcome to the FIRST installment of a soon to be large compilation of mods created by me, Asmo, to add a collection of trading cards to the world of Skyrim. Each set will contain at least 50+ cards with each set having a unique border and text with EVERY SINGLE CARD having its OWN UNIQUE SCREENSHOT to represent the card&#33; I aim to create many more expansions and will put out a special Easter Egg edition when I break 500 cards&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This pack is entitled City Edition. I have gone through Solitude, Windhelm, Whiterun, Markarth, and Riften and individually placed all 55 cards that I have created for this first edition. Some are easy to find, while others not quite so much&#33; There is a book that you will be able to find in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun with possibly your first card located on top of it&#33; This book will tell you the names and the card number of each card that you can find in this first set&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Fan promotion video by the Youtube Channel BestinMods&#33;\r<br />http://youtu.be/xXMVWX9sIac\r<br />\r<br />I hope you take the time to enjoy this mod&#33; There should be no conflicts with any other mod created. This mod does not require any of the official DLCs however I will be putting out DLC exclusive cards that will be entitled Dawnguard Deadly Creatures, etc.\r<br />\r<br />Plans for the future?\r<br />\r<br />-Next package will be forest and monstrous creatures.\r<br />There will be a various percentage drop chance that a card will come off of a creature that      matches the creatures type such as a Giant Frostbite Spider.\r<br />\r<br />-Skyrim Settlements\r<br />\r<br />-Questlines (Dark Brotherhood, Companions, etc...)\r<br />\r<br />-Landmarks Locations\r<br />\r<br />-Settlements\r<br />\r<br />-Vendors\r<br />\r<br />-And much more",
