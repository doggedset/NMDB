  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first take at modding, so feedback is encouraged. \r\n\r\nThis mod is NOT compatible with Forested Riverwood. At least not without deleting/moving some of the stuff that is behind the Inn..\r\n\r\nCell beneath house isn\\'t quite finished yet. I will update this as soon as i figure out how to code with Papryus and find something cool to put down there.\r\n\r\nThe house has a complete smithing area, enchantment table, and alchemy bench. and none of the containers respawn so you can store everything safely!",
