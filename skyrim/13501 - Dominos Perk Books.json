Requirements:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nSkyrim.esm\r\n\r\n=================\r\nII. Description:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nAdds 18 NPCs in 15 different locations to sell perk books. In all there are 41 Novice, 65 Apprentice, 91 Adept, 33 Expert, and 21 Master perk books for a total of 251 perk books.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this mod, although how I know not everybody will use it, is to make using perk mods a friendlier experience. The amount of extra perk rank and additional perk mods is likely to grow to the point where vanilla perks may fall to the wayside unintentionally. Some may see fit to buy as many perks as they want until they have them all and that is their decision.\r\n\r\nThe perk books DO require you to have the require SKILL to learn the perk based off of the vanilla value. I currently have no intention of changing this. Perks with ranks (ie Overdraw) require you to learn Rank 1 before you learn Rank 2, etc. I also have no intention of changing that.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nIII. Future Plans:\r\n=================\r\n\r\n*No plans to update this mod further due to no time anymore.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nIV. Details:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThe first time you play with this ESP enabled you will get a popup that asks you which version you would like to use: Easy, Normal, or Hardcore. Depending on which version you choose you will have different base costs of the books. Your actual cost to buy it from the merchant will vary depending on mods that altar the % at which you buy the item and on how high Speech is for that character.\r\n\r\nIf you get to a NPC and decide you want to use another version, don\\'t worry! There was a spell added under powers that will run a similar script to change the items they carry. However their inventory needs to reset in order to do so whether through natural or artificial means.\r\n\r\n\\\"Easy\\\" BASE cost\r\nNovice: 10,000\r\nApprentice: 20,000\r\nAdept: 50,000\r\nExpert: 80,000\r\nMaster: 125,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\\\"Normal\\\" BASE cost\r\nNovice: 10,000\r\nApprentice: 40,000\r\nAdept: 100,000\r\nExpert: 160,000\r\nMaster: 250,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\\\"Hardcore\\\" BASE cost\r\nNovice: 25,000\r\nApprentice: 100,000\r\nAdept: 250,000\r\nExpert: 400,000\r\nMaster: 500,000 \r\n\r\n\r\n=================\r\nV. NPcs and locations:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThe NPCs will have 10k gold each and will still gain the gold (1k in vanilla) from the Master Trader Perk. J\\'Dato and An-Deese are marked as part of the Thieves guild but NOT as fences (yet). They should not react to any theft they see that does not concern an item of theirs.\r\n\r\nTheir outfits should only be changed from what\\'s in the screenshots if you have a mod that replaces the mesh/textures of the clothes they wear.\r\n\r\nCombat:\r\nArchery---------RIVERWOOD (ACROSS FROM SVEN\\'S HOUSE)-----------------------Jonah Hawker\r\nBlock-----------WHITEWATCH TOWER (NORTH EAST OF WHITERUN)------------------Malphen Esdrecus\r\nHeavy Armor-----WHITERUN (BEHIND JORRVASKR)--------------------------------Sloomala Lurn\r\nOne-Handed------DRAGON BRIDGE (FOUR SHIELDS INN)---------------------------Caccia Crunus\r\nSmithing--------WHITERUN (OUTSIDE WARMAIDEN\\'S)-----------------------------Sharli Ruuz\r\nTwo-Handed------FALKREATH (DEAD MAN\\'S DRINK)-------------------------------Joldi\r\n\r\nMagic:\r\nAlteration------IVARSTEAD (VILEMYR INN)------------------------------------Robent Panoit\r\nConjuration-----WINDHELM (NEW GNISIS CORNERCLUB)---------------------------Dalam Heloth\r\nDestruction-----KYNESGROVE (BRAIDWOOD INN)---------------------------------Llaala Theray\r\nEnchanting------COLLEGE OF WINTERHOLD (HALL OF COUNTENANCE 2ND FLOOR)------Nelanare\r\nIllusion--------MORTHAL (MOORSIDE INN)-------------------------------------Asciene Aurmine\r\nRestoration-----SOLITUDE (TEMPLE OF THE DIVINE)----------------------------Elaninde\r\n\r\nStealth:\r\nAlchemy---------COLLEGE OF WINTERHOLD (HALL OF COUNTENANCE 2ND FLOOR)------Tsabhira\r\nLight Armor-----HUNTER\\'S REST (BETWEEN FALKREATH AND MARKARTH - SEE SS)----Oleeme\r\nLockpicking-----SOLITUDE (THE WINKING SKEEVER)-----------------------------J\\'Dato\r\nPickpocket------RIFTEN (CENTER MARKET)-------------------------------------An-Deese\r\nSneak-----------KARTHSPIRE CAMP (EAST OF MARKARTH HOSTILE AREA - SEE SS)---Lorchel\r\nSpeech----------MARKARTH (UNDERSTONE KEEP)---------------------------------Forond\r\n\r\n=================\r\nVI. Installation:\r\n=================\r\n\r\n===============\r\nManual Install\r\n===============\r\n\r\n1. Extract the archives to any folder and then copy the contents to Skyrim\\'s Data folder. You should have either the BSA and two folders (meshes, textures) or four folders (Meshes, Scripts, Sounds, Textures) and the ESP of your choice for the ESP to function as intended.\r\n2. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, and enable the Domino\\'s Perk Books.esp file(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n=================\r\nUn-Installation:\r\n=================\r\n\r\n===============\r\nManual Un-Install\r\n===============\r\n\r\n1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, and disable the Domino\\'s Perk Books.esp file(s).\r\n2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n=================\r\nVII. Upgrading/Switching:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nFor the v0.6 to v0.6.1 upgrade all you need to do is drop into your data folder and hit \\\"Yes\\\" to overwrite the old files.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nVIII. Compatibility:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nI have minorly tested two perk mods:\r\n\r\n\\\"Caos Advanced Perk Ranks\\\" - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3717\r\n\\\"PerkUP - Ultimate Perk Mod\\\" - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9359\r\n\r\nThere was no issue receiving perks that PerkUP modified because the EditorID (not the RefID you use in game) was the same as vanilla and with both mods there was no issue buying ranks they added. \r\n\r\n--If you have any compatibility issues or questions let me know via comments.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nIX. Known/Possible Issues:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nIssues as of 4/11, let me know if you discover any more but please read these before posting about an issue. If the info here do not help you than let me know if you\\'ve already done the suggested fixes.\r\n\r\nTATOOS NOT SHOWING/FACES ARE WHITE:\r\n\r\nMake sure you downloaded both the textures and meshes. They are not included with the ESPs because they are huge and haven\\'t changed since v0.5 If the faces still show up white contact me if you need additional assistance.\r\n\r\nMERCHANTS WITH MORE THAN 30k/100K GOLD DO NOT GIVE GOLD WHEN BUYING ITEMS\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a vanilla bug (I tested it on a fresh start with only skyrim.esm, update.esm, and qstart.esp enabled) I have no solution for this currently. I\\'ve decided to compensate for this issue by adding more gold to the NPCs so you can sell things to them before you buy the books. They will still receive gold from the speechcraft perk that adds extra gold to vendors.\r\n\r\nPERK BOOK ISN\\'T GIVING ME THE PERK\r\n\r\nMake sure you\\'re not getting the \\\"You already know this!\\\" message in the notification (vanilla UI has it top left). If you aren\\'t, try dropping it and reading it from the ground. For some reason after a save it will not prompt the script. It is most likely an issue with the game itself when saving and quitting to desktop since altering the scripts do not help in this issue (see issue below).\r\n\r\nMERCHANTS LOST ALL THE GOLD I JUST GAVE THEM AND RESET THEIR STOCK\r\n\r\nThis is a vanilla issue that happens after you save and quit to desktop. I tested it on vanilla merchants and it makes no sense...but it\\'s there.\r\n\r\nWHEN I ASK THE NPCS WHAT THEY CAN TEACH ME I DON\\'T HEAR OR SEE THEIR WORDS\r\n\r\nThey are currently unvoiced so if your subtitles are turned off they will not show up (force subtitles doesn\\'t work in the CK currently even when it\\'s checked). The quest objectives try to be as descriptive as possible without being too long to help with this. They will be voiced in the future however when the actual quests are implimented.\r\n\r\nWHEN I ASK THE NPCS WHAT THEY CAN TEACH ME THEIR SUBTITLES MOVE TOO FAST TO READ\r\n\r\nThe subtitles are fast for me as well and I already know what they say. Timing the silence right for each line (276 as I write this) so it gives you time to read it but isn\\'t so slow that you wonder if your game is lagging is tricky and it alters for everybody based on reading speed so the misc quests that are triggered lead you right to the NPC and are as descriptive as possible (for the first objective) so you don\\'t have to keep checking your map when you\\'re in Markarth trying to figure out where Forond is at.\r\n\r\nI CHANGED THE PRICE SETTING AND THEIR INVENTORY STILL HAS THE OLD PRICES\r\n\r\nReset their inventory either by letting it reset naturally in-game or by saving, quitting to desktop, and then reloading the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n=================\r\nX. History:\r\n=================\r\n\r\n3/22/2012 - v0.5 Released\r\n3/26/2012 - v0.54 Added more gold to NPCs and added a keyword to the books to make them sellable to vendors that buy books to help compensate for the 30k/100k gold glitch (see KNOWN ISSUES above).\r\n3/27/2012 - FaceGen Textures added in a seperate upload file since they\\'re quite huge, if you have issues with the NPC faces being paler than their faces download it.\r\n4/11/2012 - v0.6 Released. Papyrus script allows 1 ESP instead of 3 for easier updating.\r\n\r\n**LONG HIATUS**\r\n\r\n3/26/2013 - Rebooted Project, streamlined the price change script and uploaded a new version.\r\n\r\n\r\n=================\r\nXI.
