  "descriptionHtml": "As my first little project in the Creation Kit, I made Cornelius Fennich. While he is currently pretty basic, I will slowly build on his design and other parts. Currently, I somehow can&#39;t find a place anywhere on the internet that explains how I can advance a quest stage simply by speaking to him. Anyone who can help out in that regard would be appreciated.",
