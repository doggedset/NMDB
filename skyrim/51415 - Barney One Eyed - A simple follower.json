When he returned to skyrim he went back to the village he grew up in and settled there until the dragons came back. He didn&#39;t like the idea of sitting around when hundreds of people were getting killed by dragons, he will now help out anyone that asks him to come with him if they give him a good sword to slaughter his foes.[/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\r<br />[COLOR=#632423][FONT=Arial Black][SIZE=4]\r<br />[/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\r<br />[COLOR=#632423][FONT=Arial Black][SIZE=4]Barney wanders around Riverwood close to the place you can fast travel to, he has a set of iron armor and some potions, you can hire him for nothing. (If he doesn&#39;t put his armor on when he comes with you you need to remove a piece of his armor and then give it back to him) Give him a weapon of some sorts and slay people.[/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#632423][FONT=Arial Black][SIZE=4] [/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\r<br />[COLOR=#632423][FONT=Arial Black][SIZE=4]\r<br />[/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\r<br />[FONT=Arial Black][SIZE=4][COLOR=#1f497d]Where did the idea come from?
