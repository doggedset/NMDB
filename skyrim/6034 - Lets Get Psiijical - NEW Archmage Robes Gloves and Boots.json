  "descriptionHtml": "What self-respecting Archmage runs around Skyrim in a secondhand serape? \r\n\r\nNot this one...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod adds an alternative set of Arch-Mage Robes that uses the Psiijic Order Robe\\'s mesh and is re-textured to match the Morokei Dragonpriest Mask.  The robes carry the same enchantments as the original robes, and a fully enchanted set of matching gloves and boots are also included. \r\n\r\nAll three of the new Arch-Mage items can be purchased from everyone\\'s favorite collegiate dunmer, Enthir, who can typically be found hanging out on the second floor of the Hall of Attainment. \r\n\r\nA set of unenchanted ([i]and much less expensive[/i]) gear, the Imposter\\'s set, can also be purchased. Enthir has plenty of these, and they\\'re ready to receive your custom enchantments at costs that are much more palatable to the lower-level character. \r\n\r\nOf course, for those of you who want your cake and the ability to consume it too, you could skip Enthir altogether by entering the following codes in the console:\r\n\r\n[code]Boots:  player.additem 06001005 1\r\nGloves: player.additem 06001004 1\r\nRobes:  player.additem 06001003 1[/code]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE:[/b]\r\n\\\"Lets Get Psiijical - Archmage ONLY\\\" is available as an optional download. It simply replaces the vanilla robes and boots (found in the Archmage\\'s Quarters) with the retextured Psiijic ones. Enthir, and his new stock, is not included. This can be installed by itself or with the actual mod.\r\n\r\n***Updates***\r\n2.0 - Removed the forced robe replacement with new robes, gloves and boots available for purchase from Enthir only.\r\nx.x - Added \\\"Lets Get REALLY Psiijical\\\" which retextures the ordinary Psiijic Gloves, Robes and Boots, all allowing for custom enchanting.\r\n1.3 - Added the matching boots (found in the Archmage\\'s Quarters) and fixed the male 1st person view. \r\n1.2 - Added a female version of the robes.\r\n1.1 - Skipped this number for no apparent reason.\r\n1.0 - Replaced the Archmage\\'s Serape to a fitting set of robes.\r\n",
