  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ffff00][size=3][b]Description:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />- This file is only  an update of a currently existing patch in Moon and Star file.\n<br />- The patch correct issues between Moon and Star from Ganxingba and Aurora village from Scarla\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3][b]Why ?: [/b][/size][/color]\n<br />I had updated the patch because the curre official patch didn't correct the landscape issue under Aurora's forge. Currently, the forge and the smelt are in the air.  The original author seems to be absent from modding  and this patch will likely never be updated. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700][size=3]What this patch do ?: [/size][/color][/b]Just put up landscape under the smelt and the forge. \n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[b][color=#ff0000]Legal:[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />The Aurora village author had granted to the communauty to patch his village.  The Moon and Star author wasn't specefic about that. But, I interpret  from his page, he was very smooth on permission and patching. He had not requested permission to use his assets.He just aske permission to use other autors assets.  Also, this moddified file didn't edit Moon and Star assets or eddition. \n<br />\n<br />But, if Nexus or the author  request this file to be shut down, it will be removed without argumentation. The original author could include this file in Moon and Star without permission.\n<br />\n<br />If someone want to port that file on SSE, he could without permission or interpret the permission rules of the original author.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff00ff][size=3]Credits:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Scarla for Aurora village: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41852/\n<br />Ganxingba for Moon and Star: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52397?tab=description",
