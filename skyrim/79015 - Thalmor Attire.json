  "descriptionHtml": "[center][u][b][size=6]Thalmor Attire [/size][/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a simple, basic way of crafting Unenchanted Thalmor Robes as well as providing a means to acquire just the Thalmor hood.\r<br />That&#39;s right, you can now have a separate Thalmor hood and robes&#33; Both unenchanted&#33; \r<br />\r<br />There are many mods that add the Thalmor hood as a separate item but I found they over did it adding in loads more &#34;clutter&#34; such as extra clothing or features. This is just a pure simple crafting mod.\r<br />\r<br />That being said it will not be easy to craft them&#33; They require the Elven Smithing Perk. Each item requires various amounts of Gold Ingots, Leather and Leather Strips. That is pretty much it. \r<br />\r<br />[u][b]\r<br />\r<br />FAQ:[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]What can I craft?[/b][/u]\r<br />Thalmor Boots, Thalmor Robes, Thalmor Gloves, Thalmor Hood.\r<br />[u][b]\r<br />Where can I craft them?[/b][/u]\r<br />At the Tanning Rack.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]What do I need?\r<br />[/b][/u]Each item requires various amounts of Gold ingots, Leather and Leather Strips. \r<br />The Elven Smithing Perk is also required.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Why do I need the Elven Smithing Perk?[/b][/u]\r<br />I just didn&#39;t want to hand the ability to craft Elven Robes to just any commoner.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]No Hooded Robes option?[/b][/u]\r<br />No. \r<br />[u][b]\r<br />Why not?[/b][/u]\r<br />It did not make sense to have a separated hood and robe only for you to crate a hood variety.\r<br />[u][b]\r<br />All the items are unenchanted?[/b][/u]\r<br />Yes\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Does it affect the default Thalmor Clothing?[/b][/u]\r<br />No. That still remains as it was.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Can I obtain the Hood without crafting it?[/b][/u]\r<br />No. Crafting it is the only way. Unless you use a console command. Which I am not going to supply.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Will you make it so other clothing/hoods can be crafted?[/b][/u]\r<br />No. That is not the scope of this mod. Simple = Better.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Are the Thalmor the superior beings?[/b][/u]\r<br />Yes. \r<br />[u][b]\r<br />I don&#39;t agree.\r<br />[/b][/u]That&#39;s because you&#39;re not a Thalmor. \r<br />[/center]",
