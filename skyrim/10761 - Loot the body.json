  "summary": "Open the inventory of the badies you or your follower destroyed automatically so you don\\'t have to click click click every time you win a fight.",
  "descriptionHtml": "With this mod, you would never have to loot your fallen enemy manually, saving huge amount of time and energy for better enjoying the awesome game! If you like it, please endorse!\r\n\r\nWhat it does:\r\nOpens the fallen enemies\\' inventory screen automatically a few seconds after you or your follower killed him/her/it. Then you can pick which items you want to loot, or none at all by closing the inventory screen right away.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nPut the downloaded .esp file in you Skyrim\\'s Data folder, and activate it using NMM.\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\nNo compatibility issue that I\\'m aware of. I\\'ve played the mod with all the popular mods combined.\r\n\r\nFaq:\r\nQ: Will this mod always open your fallen enemies\\' inventory?\r\nA: Almost. If you kill a dragon with a notoriously long finishing move, it won\\'t. Other than that, it will always open your enemies\\' inventory, after a few seconds.\r\n\r\nQ: Will this mod feel like interrupting my combat flow?\r\nA: At first, maybe. Soon you\\'ll feel natural with the mod, because you EXPECT the inventory screen to be automatically open. I\\'ve played with the mod activated for 10+ hour. trust me. It won\\'t interrupt your combat even if you are drawing the bow with either Gamepad or Mouse/Keyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n1.1: fix stupid packaging error, included the scripts, now it will actually work..\r\n1.0: initial release. \r\n\r\nCredit:\r\nThanks Cipscis for giving me lots of heads up about CK and scripting, without his help this mod would never be.\r\n\r\nDistribution:\r\nIf you want to redistribute this mod in any way, including merging it with other mod, please contact me first.",
