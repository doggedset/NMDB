  "descriptionHtml": "AEterna Rings\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n(if you are looking for baubles look also here: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1994\r\nand here: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2288\r\n\r\nFor now there is only two versions of the ring. First one I tried to embelish in imitation of One Ring from Lord of The Rings with Mordor lanuage description. The second is... I think more lore friendly as I\\'ve heard here (I don\\'t speak English very well). I proudly present... Dibella\\'s Ring  :-)   \r\nThese are not unique items. You can use only one mod at a time. I know this is an irritating limitation but I can\\'t help it (for now). After you install my mod many popular (standard) rings will change their appearance to my version. Only colors may be slightly different (mainly gold and silver) and sometimes they will have gems, sometimes they won\\'t. I placed few examples in the pictures.\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n-------\r\n\r\nMy One Ring is made from typical version of Skyrim rings. I didn\\'t change the the mesh, that is why it looks a bit blocky. Heh, when I learn how to change the mesh and so on we\\'ll talk more ;-))))\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n----------------\r\nThere are two methods:\r\n\r\n1. if you don\\'t use Nexus Mod Manager, simply download one of the ZIP files, extract it and copy the contents to your Skyrim installation folder. But be aware: if you have another ring mod already installed and you don\\'t want to lose it then better backup two files in the folder ..\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\amuletsandrings. Those files are:\r\ngenericrings.dds\r\ngenericrings_n.dds.\r\n\r\n2. If you use Nexus Mod Manager, click \\'Download with Manager\\'. The rest you should know.\r\n\r\nUninstallation\r\n---------------------\r\nFor those who use Nexus Mod Manager I will not explain what to do :-)\r\n\r\nTo uninstall the mod manually:\r\na) From the folder ..\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\amuletsandrings remove following files:\r\ngenericrings.dds\r\ngenericrings_n.dds\r\nb) If you made backup of your previous files put them back into ..\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\amuletsandrings folder.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nAEterna\r\n(aeterna826) \r\n",
