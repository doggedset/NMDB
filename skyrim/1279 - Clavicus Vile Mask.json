Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/ folder, overwrite files if needed\r\n\r\nIf you like it, endorse it! :)\r\n\r\nThis is a simple, but hi res re-tex of the Clavicus Vile Mask.\r\n\r\nI felt the original was weak looking, like pewter. So I re made it, with a richer and darker texture. Added a slight age patina to give it a look and feel of something much older than the vanilla one.\r\n\r\nI also worked over the shadows, and added more definition. The eyes have a light color patina to them and some areas have a little more wear and tear. This should feel like a Daderic artifact, not a cheap trinket.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\nUse as you like, just credit me, Jase180! Cheers. ",
