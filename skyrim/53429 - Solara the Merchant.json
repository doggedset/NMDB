She will be able to sell/buy from 8 am to 8 pm.\r<br />\r<br />I recommend to enable it after you purchase the house in Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: none ( well, the house in Whiterun)\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility : its compatible with all mods as far as i know.\r<br />\r<br />Future update : she will be available to the house in Solitude and in the house of Windhelm\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />PS. in case they have grey faces i have included in the file their face textures. Just copy-paste them in  data/textures/actor/Character/Facegendata/Facetint/\r<br />\r<br />Credits: Bethesda Studios for the creation kit ",
