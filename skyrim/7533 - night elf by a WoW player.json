Those are blueish bosmers or simply some color mad fairies! so i made a night elf based on the color and tatoo wich are similar if not same to world of warcraft (you will find the color selected for this realy accurate)\r\n(btway the armor used for the pic will not apear as such unless you downloaded the right mode otherwise its just a casual glass armor)\r\n\r\nto fit more with the context the night elf name actualy is Tyrande Whisperwind XD\r\n\r\nPS: you will need the extended sliders color mode to play this save",
