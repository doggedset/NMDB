  "descriptionHtml": "10/20/13 Beta project was broken so I am starting from version 1.40. If anyone is watching let me know it help motivate me lol.\r\n Not sure when I will have an update but I am working on it off and on.\r\n\r\nHere is Link to Predrag Pesic\\'s mod. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37489/?] Ogmunds Tomb by Predrag Pesic [/url] Which is used in the beta version as the new quest dungeon for high levels. Credit goes to him for the base I used in the dungeon design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=Brown][u][b]--- 1.40 --- Reworked the Proving quest to be able to complete at level 40 down form 70. Fixed some clipping error and the the error with the one helms not showing on characters.\r\nAdded more bad guys to the Cathedral.[/b][/u][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n      I have started adding the features and materials I need to update with Alexrep\\'s armor. Their is no quest yet but their is new world spaces and the elements of the quest as the armor has been added and is for sell in heaven atm. But, I am not telling how you have to reach heaven yet as I want it to be part of the quest. But if you find it good for you. You can get Tyraels armor lol. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][u][b]Well, Alextrep as given me a reason to make an update he has given me permission to add him mod armor as quest rewards. Which I really want to do so I am working on that now it is going to be a big one with lots of Quest. This of coarse is going to take some time to be released as it is alot to add.\r\n\r\n1.42 Beta is up for testing let know if you have an issue. It is not very complete yet removed and moved the Main base to new spot to hopefully fix some errors some have reported and make mod compatible with many other mods.\r\n\r\n1.43 Added more to the moved fort.\r\n\r\n1.44 Made file Master file for test to fix all errors. Cleaned removed landscape changes as they seem to be the problem.  Master will most likely become the main version. Still need to finish new quest and moving the fort / decor as well as nav meshes in fort.\r\n\r\nUpdate on Project I am still working on 1.5  just wanted to let you all know it in the works it going to be a big one. [/b][/u][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][u][b]Looking For someone to make a tutorial video. on you-tube for me. [/b][/u][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][u][b]1.3 Update See Change Log.

[/b][/u][/color] \r\n\r\n---This mod adds new player faction to Skyrim you can join Known as the Knights Templar.\r\n\r\n---So far in first release it has.---\r\n\r\n--Main Quest Chain Leading up to an really Nice Bow. (Requires Level 70 or above to get and you Must Defeat a very hard Opponent). Too Finish the quest but you can start at a low level. Getting your own Knight\\'s Templar armor. \r\n\r\n--Bad Voice Acting By me lol.\r\n\r\n--A hidden Easter Egg in the world only clue I am giving until some makes a video is it\\'s in the sea somewhere. Happy hunting. \r\n\r\n--Building added to Winterhold Old Priory, Barrack Miners Quarters, and the work of uncovering the old Winterhold fort. \r\n\r\n--Templar Base Ship. \r\n\r\n\r\n--Option to Buy Templar armor \r\n--3 Followers in the barrack.\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][u][b]---Quest troubleshooting---[/b][/u][/color]\r\nMarkers may not update as they should. So read the quest as where to go. I am still working on a fix it is weird everything is set they just do not update all the time on the Proving quest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith more to come if the mod takes off. It is alot of work adding quest and dialog. So I am more likely to do more the more endorsement I get. That is just how I am sorry. I am not asking for any donations. But, would like help with scripts and voice acting if I add more I want to add some more quest but I still a beginner at quests. I have tested quests on my end worked. Let me know if dialog doesn\\'t show or you have quest problems. But, you shouldn\\'t. lol\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][u][b]---Future Plans:---[/b][/u][/color]\r\nMore Quest.\r\nMore Easter Eggs.\r\nMore to the Fort.\r\nMore Voice acting.\r\nMore Dialog with history of the order.\r\n\r\n\r\n---I have uploaded my load order in the readme file section for those who have questions about load order and mods that are known safe to use with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][u][b]Great Mods:[/b][/u][/color]\r\nThe Okaazah - Player-Owned Ship with Crew and Travel System by Kingston3K\r\nVery special thx to TheAmazingDerpMan For Permission to use his boat as a templar base ship.
