  "modName": "Fix the dagger one handed damage",
  "summary": "This fix is supose to actualy clean the lame and anoying bugs wich prevented daggers to benefits from the one handed weapon damage increase enchant. It will also allow daggers to benefit from Critical of sword item type all of this while keeping the precious assasin blade perk intact",
  "descriptionHtml": "I went looking for a mode that would allow my dagger to benefit from one handed damage bonus from enchant but found none to my liking. The only one that did purposely killed the assasin blade perk by simply changing all daggers to sword. This mode actualy makes dagger act both as sword type and dagger type weapons keyword wich allow you to benefit from both sword and dagger perk as well as let you get damage bonus from one handed enchantments. \r\n\r\n(To anyone who pretend daggers are overpowered and should be speed based rather then damage based... If you need speed that much why dont you go get elemental fury and start smashing with two mace.)\r\n\r\nVersion history 1.0Beta\r\nUnder testing to see if everything work right.",
