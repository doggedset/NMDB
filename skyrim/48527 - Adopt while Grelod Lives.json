  "summary": "Play a virtuous character that does not feel like murdering Grelod the kind and still adopt from the Honorhall Orphanage. Adopt while Grelod Lives.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Thanks for viewing my mod. Really this is a very simple change to the hearthfire honorhall adoption quest. Originally, if Grelod was living, Constance would not allow you to adopt any of the children from the orphanage. All I did was change a few of the quest requirements.\r<br />\r<br />I have not tested EVERY conceivable combination of actions. The way I have it set up, you can adopt if you have not yet begun the dark brotherhood quest, this means, you have not yet TALKED to Aventus. Once you have talked to Aventus, she won&#39;t let you adopt until his quest is completed.  \r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS:\r<br />- Skyrim (Obviously :P )\r<br />- Hearthfire. You can&#39;t adopt without it anyway...\r<br />\r<br />CHANGELOG:\r<br />v1 - Initial Release",
