  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a craft-able axe to your adventures. The design as some may recognise is from the genius McFarlane, creator of Spawn. This axe is based off the Blood Axe wielded by the great Viking Spawn.\r\nIt can be crafted at any crafting forge and requires the steel smithing perk. \r\nIt is in no way intended to be the new best axe ever, So the stats have been tuned to make it actually useable in average game play. The stats make it just on par with Ebony Battle Axe. It has slightly increased damage, greater reach and increased chance of stagger. However, it is slightly slower and heavier to balance it out.\r\nBlood stain effects now work as they should! Tip for anyone else out there making their own weapons that you need to have vertex color set to \\'yes\\' on the triShape Data of blood effect and blood lighting branches for it to work.\r\n\r\nStats:\r\nBase damage: 30\r\nWeight: 30\r\n\r\nAlso find my viking spawn shield here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14076",
