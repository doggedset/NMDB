  "descriptionHtml": "=========================================================================================================================\r\nDo not download the 85 MB version. Download the 1.1 version of size 15 MB. It is free of bugs!\r\nThe drastic reduction in download size is because, I converted the *.wav  and *.lip files to *.fuz files, which occupy very little memory.\r\n=========================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nHello Gamers and Skyrim-lovers! This mod adds a small quest associated with the much fabled sword Umbra in the Elder Scrolls series. Hope everyone enjoys it!\r\n\r\nWHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?\r\nThis mod adds a character(s) in Skyrim named Umbra who wields the sword Umbra. It also adds a quest(s) to kill (not kill) her and obtain the sword. Sounds pretty lame doesn’t it? I won’t tell much in the description otherwise it will ruin the mod.\r\nThere is also a side quest that collimates with the main quest.\r\n\r\nHOW TO START THE QUEST(S)?\r\nOnce you are level 30 go to Urag gro-Shub in the College of Winterhold Arcanaeum. He will have a dialogue option for you to retrieve a special book.\r\nIn order to start the side quest, go to Katla’s farm near Solitude and speak to Katla. If she is already dead, then sorry dudes.\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\r\nThe Umbra sword that you will see in the mod is not my creation. I am a completely noob in Blender, that’s why I used the sword created by Bloodysunday in the Nexus Forum. Hats off to him for creating such an awesome mesh! You can download it here.\r\n                 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12797#content\r\nEverything else is my creation. There are several sites and software that I took the help of. Their names and links are given in the DOCX present in the 7zip file.\r\n\r\nNote : The Voice files present in the mod may not actually sound human. I have downloaded them from sites like Acapela, Ivona, AT&T etc. Then I have edited them using Sony Vegas. So voice of Arngeir, for example, may not sound like that of an old man or the dialogues of Gimli may lack a special raspiness. But I\\'ve tried my best.",
