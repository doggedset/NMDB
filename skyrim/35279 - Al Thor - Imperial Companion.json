  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/ms0rvk.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nAl\\'Thor can be found at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. He has no custom armor or weapons, he\\'s only equipped with steel armor, gauntlets and boots, and a steel greatsword.\r\nHe specializes in 2 handed weapons, and levels up with the player, however, he is capped at 100.\r\n\r\nHe IS an imperial, it\\'s just that I forgot to un-equip nouserheres ears /oops\r\nAlso, yes he is NAMED after Rand Al\\'Thor from the Wheel Of Time novels, but there are no more similarities other than his name.\r\n\r\nRequired files:\r\nApachii Sky Hair (Male V 1.1) || http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\n\r\nNot required but recommended: \r\nFine Face Textures by Urshi || http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27815/\r\nBetter Males Sundracon meshes by Urshi || http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26145\r\nHigh Quality Eyes by Xenius || http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/498\r\n\r\nInstallation: (Manually)\r\n1. Download and extract.\r\n2. Locate the Skyrim directory and drop the files into the \\'Data\\' folder.\r\n3. Check the .esp and enjoy!\r\n\r\nInstallation: (NMM)\r\n1. Well you probably already know what to do, so get to it!\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n1. Uncheck the .esp file.\r\n2. Delete the .esp from the \\'Data\\' folder in the Skyrim Directory!\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting:\r\nSo far I have only encountered one problem which is sometimes, he will not be at the Bannered Mare.\r\nIt\\'s not really that major, it\\'s just a teeny tiny issue.\r\nIt can be fixed by opening the console window with ~ or ` , then typing in \\'help thor\\'* (without quotation marks). Then, next to his name should be a series of numbers, all you need to do then is type in \\'player.placeatme #\\' (replace the # with the series of numbers) hopefully he\\'ll then pop up right next to you when you close the console window!\r\n\r\n*yes just \\'thor\\' because it doesn\\'t work as well if you put in \\'al\\'thor\\', probably because of the wee quotation mark in his name\r\nSorry if it\\'s not that clear, I suck at explaining stuff heh\r\n\r\nAaaaaaaaand if it still doesn\\'t work then leave a comment and I\\'ll try to figure something out!",
