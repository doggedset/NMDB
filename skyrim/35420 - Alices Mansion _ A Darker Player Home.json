The file name may seem odd, because it was also influenced by luigi\\'s--you know what trademark. This is",
  "descriptionHtml": "The entrance \\\"The Rabbit Hole\\\" is located behind the first house in Winterhold (next to the tree and snowbank). \r\n*Rabbit Hole door FIXED!* SAVE backup files just in case! \r\n___________________________________________ \r\n*Revisions 1 & 2 - (rugs, Giant mushrooms and instruments in the rabbit hole, and a small midway house connecting rabbit hole and mansion). I won\\'t do much more due to serious health issues. \r\n\r\n*Revision 3 - The switch for Shadowmere has been moved in front of his \\\"tiny room\\\". Not in room, but reachable. \r\n\r\n*REVISION 4 - Giant shields placed on the wall near the weapon racks, a few E.E. crates replacing old boring ones, Wolf\\'s Bane silver sword damage slightly upped, and a workbench added near the forge.\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ \r\nNotes from Creator- \r\nI have fixed many (not all) cracks between x,y,z. It\\'s near impossible to get them all when you make some areas from scratch. \r\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ \r\n\r\nHaVe FuN! :}",
