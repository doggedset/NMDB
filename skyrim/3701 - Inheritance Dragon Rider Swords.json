  "descriptionHtml": "What started out as a small idea is slowly becoming a fun side project for me...\r\n\r\nWelcome to AlagaÃ«sia!\r\n\r\nI\\'ve currently released retextures of common swords to make them look like the swords of Dragon Riders. My plan is to make them new items altogether when to Toolkit is released, and from there, give them special properties unlike any other weapons in the game. I do not aim to make the weapons overpowered, however. They will instead be placed in specific locations or acquired from certain people, and will be at or around the same strength as Eleven/Orcish weapons.\r\n\r\nIdeas to be implemented:\r\n     - Make them separate items\r\n     - Slightly alter the original models\r\n     - Add more swords\r\n     - Give them certain \\\"staff\\\" properties\r\n     - Make them act like unbreakable soul gems\r\n\r\nI\\'d also like suggestions on things. Maybe some more swords to do or changes I should make to the three I\\'ve already started. Any help is appreciated. If you would like to offer services, please contact me through my Nexus account.\r\n\r\n(All unofficial symbols on the swords were created by CorellaStudios.
