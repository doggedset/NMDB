  "summary": "Adds a more practical dungeon like player home.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Please Endorse and/or comment!! I want to know what you guys think!!! thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a dungeon like player home located beneath a beautiful waterfall. It has many display cases and mannequins, a smithy, and enchanting and alchemy room, a bedroom, and a combat/ torture room. The home is only slightly cluttered and there are several bookshelves however I am new at modding and could not for the life of me get the bookshelves to work properly, if you know how feel free to fix it and I would be glad to reupload the fixed version. For now to put things on a bookshelf you will have to do it manually :P In order to get the house/ dungeon you will need to defeat the Dragon Priest with the key waiting outside, so this is not for low level characters.\r\n\r\n======================Releases=============================\r\n1.0beta\r\n  Release, still may be bugs.\r\n1.1beta\r\n  Fixed a backwards chest, added a real Dragon Priest Mask altar.",
