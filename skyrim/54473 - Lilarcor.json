Modder&#39;s brought Lilarcor into Morrowind and then later on Oblivion.\r<br />\r<br />And now Lilarcor has found his way to Skyrim. The mod re-introduces Lilarcor to the world of the Elder Scrolls, complete with a unique appearance and his trademark humour.\r<br />\r<br />Features:\r<br />\r<br />    A Sentient sword with a mind of his own\r<br />    Lilarcor&#39;s Trademark Humour and quirkiness\r<br />    Over 100+ lines of fully Voice Acted Dialogue\r<br />    A treasure hunt\r<br />    Unique High Quality Assets\r<br />    Lilarcor can be upgraded, each upgrade is visually different\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i390.photobucket.com/albums/oo346/InsanitySorrow/Lilarcor/LilAcquire_zpsb9bdc986.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />To acquire Lilarcor you will need to first find each of the 4 pieces of Lilarcor scattered around Skyrim.
