  "descriptionHtml": "Flame atronachs.  Your first serious Conjuration summon.  You summon it up, and... it looks awful&#33;  Too dark, its &#34;flames&#34; look way too deep red-orange.  That doesn&#39;t look like flame&#33;  After fiddling, you discover that Your ENB setup is doing it, and nothing short of shutting off major components of ENB can correct it.  It doesn&#39;t even seem to respond properly to the fire settings in the ENBSeries INI.\r<br />\r<br />Enter me, one rather well-versed in NIFSkope surgery.  I noticed that the flame trail that Madame de Flambedaedra leaves in her wake is not so affected.  After poking at the two NIFs, I discovered that it was a shader flag lacking in the main flame atro mesh that was present in the flame trail: SLSF1_Soft_Effect.  After setting all pertinent bits on the main flame atro body mesh to have that shader flag, presto&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Sharing for all of you who are partial to siccing daedra against your foes and also have an ENB setup.\r<br />\r<br />Special thanks to Boris Vorontsov for ENBSeries, and for Jonwd7 for his recently revealed massive in-progress overhaul of NIFSkope (I call it &#34;Super-NIFSkope&#34;, it&#39;s that big a deal), to which you can get a piece of from here: [url=https://github.com/jonwd7/nifskope/releases]https://github.com/jonwd7/nifskope/releases[/url]",
