  "descriptionHtml": "Simply shortens the casting time of master level spells from 3 seconds to 1 second.\r\n\r\nHaving a 3 second charge time seems flashy and powerful in theory, but in practice it\\'s just annoying as heck since it takes about 10 attempts to charge it while being beaten to death by swords. I feel one second is a much better balance to these situations, since you can still be stopped, yet its much easier to actually get the cast in.\r\n\r\nExceptions: \r\nconjuration, since theres no practical use in summoning thralls mid battle\r\nlightning storm: set to instant because the post-charge animation also takes about a second (so in practice it\\'ll still be about one second)\r\n\r\nSteam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=75859155",
