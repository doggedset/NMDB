  "modName": "Summon Falmer Champion - Snow Prince",
  "summary": "Allows the player to summon the Falmer Champion the Snow Prince.  This mod also adds a master level destruction spell, Ice Wave.",
  "descriptionHtml": "=============================================\r\n8/4/12 Revision Notes:\r\n\r\nVersion 1c and 2c further fixes the slow effect caused by fighting the Snow Prince, these files removes the slow effect.  The perma frost cloak should now be removable using a Cure Diseases potion.  This version also fixes the Snow Prince\\'s Master of the Snow ability.  If the current weather is a snow storm (natural or if induced by the Snow Prince) he attains near invincibility... if the weather changes he will take damage normally.  While in interior areas, Snow Prince attains some health regeneration but can still be taken out easily if in extended combat situations.  With these changes, fighting his Aspect in Blackreach is now a lot more difficult and nearly impossible if you do not prepare.  If you use the proper strategy he can be taken out quickly.  Trying to overpower the boss version is a suicide mission and even my Potema and Ysgramor summons could not overpower him.  PM me if you\\'re still having a difficult time defeatig him and I\\'ll tell you the simple and very effective way of defeating him.\r\n\r\nVersion 1c retains the 24 hour recast timer, and version 2c removes it.\r\n\r\n=============================================\r\n7/23/12 Revision Notes:\r\n\r\nFurther fixes a bug in which the player is permanently stuck in a block of ice impeding their movement speed.  Also fixes the issue that adds a Snow Elf race in the character creation screen that causes bugs with the other races.\r\n\r\nVersion1b is for those who want the 24 hour recast timer when summoning the Snow Prince, while Version2b is for those who do not want the recast timer.\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\n7/12/12 Revision Notes:\r\nFixes a bug in which the player is permanently stuck in a block of ice impeding their movement speed.\r\n\r\nVersion1a is for those who want the 24 hour recast timer when summoning the Snow Prince, while Version2a is for those who do not want the recast timer.\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\nVersion 1 - Has a 24 hour recast timer.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 - Doesn\\'t have a recast timer and the player can summon the Snow Prince indefinitely.\r\n\r\nTo gain access to the Snow Prince\\'s Seal and spell tome: Ice Wave, the player must travel to Blackreach and defeat the Falmer Shadow Champion.  The Falmer Shadow Champion is located in the arena area of Blackreach and is the same level as the player. As an additional challenge, he is followed by the Aspect of the Snow Prince that is also the same level as the player.  This battle will be very difficult and requires a lot of strategy.  To make this battle a lot easier, I\\'d advise using my Potema or Ysgramor summon to battle the duo.\r\n\r\nSnow Prince is equipped with the following:\r\n\r\n1. Laevanteinn Axe Spear - A modified glass axe that the Snow Prince uses as a spear.  The weapon can freeze his opponents into blocks of ice.\r\n2. Freija Staff - A modified staff that the Snow Prince uses as striking weapon that freezes the enemy.\r\n3: Laevanteinn Thrust Technique - The Snow Prince will counter enemy melee attacks with a powerful thrust that enduces a snow storm.  The thrust itself is a ice javeline projectile that generates a wall of ice.  At critical strikes, the ice wall will also fire off additional ice spears for extra damage.\r\n4: Snow Elf Magic: Storm Waypoint Portal - (Only available in outside areas) The Snow Prince will use his Snow Elf magic to open a storm waypoint in the sky and unleash a barrage of snow storms that supresses his opponents.\r\n5: Snow Elf Magic: Ice Lance - A power ice spell that unleashes an ice javelin that generates a wall of ice.  On critical hits, the ice wall will unleash additional ice spikes for extra damage.\r\n6: Snow Elf Magic: Frozen Cloak - A frost cloak effect that damages multiple foes within a certain range.\r\n7: Master of the Snow - During a snow storm, the Snow Prince is nearly invincible, if the weather changes he will once again take damage.\r\n8: The Snow Prince has boosted health, magicka, stamina, and movement speed.\r\n9: Fortified health regen out of battle.\r\n10: Custom combat style that switches between two handed barbarian and spellsword depending on the situation.\r\n11: Player gains access the the ancient Falmer spell: Ice Wave after reading the spell tome in possession of the Falmer Shadow Champion.  The spell is a concentration spell that unleashes an explosive wave of ice that is very powerful and can clear an area quickly.  The spell greatly drains magicka because of its high damage output.\r\n\r\nNotes: The Snow Prince has access to a variety of AOE damage.  He is very effective in open area combat and is still very powerful in interior areas.  He can easily wipe out an army of badits if he lands a series of critical hits and activates the extra effects of his Ice Javelin and Laevateinn Thrust attacks.  He can survive longer if you take breaks in between combat situations, but eventually go down in prolonged battles if he does not have any time to regenerate health out of combat.  His storm spell is very effective in crowd control, but he can only cast it every 30 seconds, and the storm only lasts for 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any issues with the file, it should not cause any issues with any other mods. The only possible issues I can predict is if you are using a mod that changes the entire Blackreach area.  No additional mods are necessary to run the file. ",
