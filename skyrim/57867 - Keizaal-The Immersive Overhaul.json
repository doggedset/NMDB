Well, it&#39;s a Skyrim Overhaul. Another one you say? Yes, another Skyrim Overhaul, however this Overhaul was borne out of the need for something better. I dislike every other Overhaul there is for Skyrim, some have to many perks, others barely change anything, or sometimes they just create ridiculous difficulties. If your like me and are simply disappointed with the current variety of Overhauls then perhaps your might want to give this one a go&#33; I aim to achieve the perfect balance between Realism, Roleplaying and Gameplay. And not only that, but I want this mod to light-weight and compatible with as many mods as possible. Meaning, that this Overhaul is MODULAR and 100% FREE of SCRIPTS&#33;[/font][/color][/size][/font]\r<br />[font=Century Gothic]\r<br />[center][color=#BFBFBF][font=Century Gothic][size=4][font=Franklin Gothic Medium]In the text below, you will easily find out if this mod truly is what your looking for.[/font][/size][/font][/color][/center]\r<br /> [center][img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/57867-1-1410019156.jpg[/img][/center]                                 \r<br />[color=#BFBFBF][font=Century Gothic][size=4] [font=Franklin Gothic Medium]The night today is not to cold. There is no wind, and the Lake&#39;s waters are calm. This night couldn&#39;t be better you say to yourself. You look at an old Stump and think to yourself &#34;This looks like a great spot to camp&#34;. You place your bags on the floor, and quickly start gathering small stones by the Lake to make a clearing for the campfire, next you grab your old lumber axe and quickly scavenge the area for some wood. After some minutes your able to gather enough good pieces of wood to begin to light your campfire. Right after that, you start taking your tent and bedroll out of your bag, and start working. After some time, your tent is ready for you to rest your tired body. However, instead you wish to spend a bit of time outside. You take your helmet, sword and shield and place it on a handy rock just beside you, you also place two candles on it, if you feel like writing on your journal as you so often do. And as you sit on the stump, the sky catches your eyes.[/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Century Gothic][color=#BFBFBF][font=Century Gothic][size=4][center][img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/57867-2-1410395656.jpg[/img][/center][/size][/font][/color][/font]\r<br />[font=Century Gothic][color=#BFBFBF][font=Century Gothic][size=4][center][/center][/size][/font][/color][/font]\r<br />[font=Franklin Gothic Medium]An amazing starry sky sits above you, this night you can clearly see the great array of colors in the Sky and all it&#39;s stars and constellations. You spend a moment, looking up while the warm fire keeps you comfortable, and the peaceful sounds of nature greet you for an amazing night. You pick up from your bag a small bottle of mead, you were never much of a person to drink, but on some special occasions you would. As you feel the sweet honeyed liquid travel trough your mouth, you look up at the sky again, and start wondering how many stars there are, and you wonder if there are other worlds like yours. Or how many adventures used these stars to guide themselves to their destiny. Ah yes. Destiny.[/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Century Gothic][color=#BFBFBF][font=Century Gothic][size=4][center][img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/57867-3-1410395656.jpg[/img][/center][/size][/font][/color][/font]\r<br />[font=Century Gothic][color=#BFBFBF][font=Century Gothic][size=4][center][/center][/size][/font][/color][/font]\r<br />[font=Franklin Gothic Medium]What is your Destiny? You wander this land in search of something, of purpose and meaning, to find your life&#39;s compass to guide you to your greatest achievements. This is when you remember of an old book, you had. You wonder...You placed the bottle down and decided to take a deep look around your bag, amongst the many things you have collected so far, there it is. The Tome of Knowledge.[/font]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/57867-4-1410395656.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Franklin Gothic Medium]You pick it up in front of you, you look at it&#39;s old cover that has already began to fall off, and gently place it on the stone next to you. You go to the extreme right side of the stump to get closer to the stone as if it were some sort of table. The calm waters of the Lake stand before you as does this ancient Tome. You wonder, perhaps this book will guide me to my greatest achievements and teach me all there is to know about the world around me. You stand still looking at it, until you finally have mustered the energy to open it.[/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/font][/color][center][size=4][font=Franklin Gothic Medium][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/download/1000127138]OPEN THE TOME[/url][/font][/size]\r<br />(Download for Keizaal&#39;s Manual)[/center][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[/color][center][/center]",
