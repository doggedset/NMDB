  "descriptionHtml": "vwrSand\r\n\r\nThis mod replaces a couple textures to bring sandy beaches to Skyrim.\r\nDue to Bethesda\\'s choice to rely on landscape textures to \\'look similar to meshes\\', this will cause hard edges to be more noticeable. This means, the dark colored rocks will look kind of stupid coming out of the sand because the transition is not gradual. The rivers around Whiterun also have rocks and terrain which don\\'t blend well with the sand so please don\\'t blame that on me, it will break immersion in some areas. Refer to the screenshots and make the determination before you install this mod.\r\n\r\nInstallation: Copy contents of Data folder into your Skyrim Data folder. That\\'s it.\r\nUn-installation: Delete the 4 textures from your Data/Textures/Landscape folder.\r\n\r\nIf you want to back up the textures you\\'re currently using, just look in the data/textures/landscape folder in this mod and find the 4 included textures in the same directory of your Skyrim game folder. Rename them with _underscores so if you want to use them later you can.",
