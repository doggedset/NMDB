  "descriptionHtml": "This something i made when i was very bored. It simply adds an empty dwemer basement in the basement of the abandoned stronghold Gash Murug. (a basement in a basement. °-° inception)\r<br />\r<br />Just put it below the other mod in your load order and you should be fine.\r<br />I have no intention on expanding on this but do feel free to do whatever you want with the part that i modified.\r<br />As long as you keep it here on the nexus. This is what Kagreesh wanted and i cannot change that.\r<br />Also this mod is based on the one without the follower.\r<br />\r<br />Anyway have fun with whatever you use it for.",
