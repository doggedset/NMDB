  "modName": "UnderC - Removable Underwear",
  "summary": "Removable Underwear\r\n\r\nDo you like to play with a naked body model but are afraid that someone else will play your Skyrim and see that you do? This mod adds a hidden way to have both underwear and a naked body.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[heading] Requirements: [/heading]\r\n[u]This is NOT a body model replacer[/u]. You will need to add your own preferred body model to the paths specified for this mod to work properly. One with underwear located where the characters body model is kept and \r\none nude placed in the paths specified.\r\n\r\n[color=red]READ[/color]: You now have to place the textures you use for your nude body model into the paths provided.\r\n\r\n[heading]Notes[/heading]\r\n\r\n[u]If updating[/u] from a previous version before 1.4 to 1.4 or above you will just need to move your body model/textures into the new directories. Sorry for any inconveniences.\r\n\r\nunfortunately if you are using \\\"better males body, Nudes - FavoredSoulMeshes - ErectVersion\\\" the latest update was not able to fix a normal map (malebody_1_msn.dds) error when using one of the normal maps that are in the optional section of the mod, however there is a fix, all you need to do is get the normal map (malebody_1_msn.dds) from the non optional section of that mod for the males and place it into the males texture folder I provide and all should work fine after that.\r\n\r\nRegarding custom races with their own unique body models. I was asked to provide support for custom races like these, so I had an idea to make that work although it turns out that this idea wouldn\\'t work, I\\'m still trying to add support though but if anyone knows of any ways this could be accomplished please let me know. Otherwise till then this mod may not work correctly for [u]custom races that  have unique body models.[/u] \r\n \r\n\r\n [heading] Change Log: [/heading]\r\n\r\n1.4\r\n- Fixed a possable male body texture glitch (occured when using \\\"better males body, Nudes - FavoredSoulMeshes - ErectVersion\\\")\r\n- Added support for elderly Normal Maps.\r\n- Changed the directoies for cleaner and easier modding.\r\n\r\n1.3\r\n- Made it so the nude body modle uses different textures to the default underwear version.\r\n\r\n1.2\r\n-Placed the ring in game.\r\n-Added male support.\r\n-Added Proper Khajiit and Argonian support.\r\n-Made it so NPCs now get completly naked. For real this time! I accidentally reverted this feature while previously updating, fixed now.\r\n\r\n1.1\r\n-Made it so NPCs now get completly naked.\r\n-Slightly increased the chance for NPCs to say yes.\r\n-Fixed 1st person Body.\r\n\r\n1.0\r\nInitial Release.  \r\n\r\n[heading] Description: [/heading]\r\nThis mod adds a way to have a body of your choice with underwear as your default body model and then the ability to take off the underwear and roam naked.\r\n\r\nIf you have siblings or friends who play your Skyrim and you don\\'t want them to know you play with a naked body model use this mod.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve placed a ring on the counter of The Sleeping Giant (the inn in Riverwood) and when the ring is equipped it adds underwear to your inventory which when equipped removes the underwear from your body. While the ring is equipped you also have the option to ask an NPC to remove their clothing and underwear although they may not always want to do this for you. If the ring is not equpped non of this will be visible. I\\'ve used game dialogue for the NPCs so it seems as real as possable. If you have a speechcraft skill of over 50 you have another higher chance to convince them if they turned you down.\r\n\r\nIt is easily customizable so you can use the body model of your choice!\r\n\r\n[heading] Known Bugs: [/heading]\r\n-For some reason occasionally the conversation will exit out early, no harm is cause when this happens and im not sure what is actually causing this. If you know a solution or the reason please let me know.\r\n\r\n-If an NPC does not have the voice files for the dialogue that I\\'ve used they will not speak although Im guessing nearly everyone in default Skyrim has these files. This does NOT mean that any new NPCs added by mods wont work because they will, unless they have unique voice files of there own but even then they still could work. unfortunately this means pretty much anyone who was added with Dawngaurd falls under this problem, although the scripts will still work and you will be able to strip them, they just wont speak.  Once again if you know a solution let me know.\r\nI will be trying to fix these bugs in future updates.\r\n\r\n[heading] Installation: [/heading]\r\n\r\nUnzip the Data folder within the zip to your skyrim installation directory.\r\n\r\nor unzip everything with in the Data folder in the zip into:\r\n\r\nskyim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n\r\nWhich is located by default at:\r\n\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\nor\r\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\n\r\n\r\nThen place your NUDE body model into this directories and rename as follows.\r\n\r\nFemale:\r\n Data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\underclothing\\\\female\\\\\r\n      rename the body models to:\r\n           skin_1.nif\r\n           skin_0.nif\r\nMale:\r\n Data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\underclothing\\\\male\\\\\r\n      rename the male body models to:\r\n           skinmale_1.nif\r\n           skinmale_0.nif\r\n\r\nConcerning textures:\r\n\r\nREQUIRED!! Please place the textures of the body models of your choice into the following directories:\r\n\t\r\n\tFemale: Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\underclothing\\\\female\\\\   \r\n\tFemale Khajiit: Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\underclothing\\\\khajiitfemale\\\\\r\n\tFemale Argonian: Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\underclothing\\\\argonianfemale\\\\\r\n\tFemaleold: Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\underclothing\\\\femaleold\\\\\r\n\t\r\n\tMale: Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\underclothing\\\\male\\\\\r\n\tMale Khajiit: Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\underclothing\\\\khajiitmale\\\\\r\n\tMale Argonian: Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\underclothing\\\\argonianmale\\\\   \r\n\tMaleold: Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\underclothing\\\\maleold\\\\\r\n\r\nYou shouldnt need to rename them from what they are already called. Dont worry if the body model you are using did not provide all of these textures for each race just place the ones you have into the directories and make sure you have [u]at least[/u] the texture file that doesnt have _s/_msn/_sk after it in the directories otherwise the mod will use the games vanilla texture and the model texture will properly look weird. There names should look something like this:\r\n\r\nMales:\r\nmalebody_1\r\nmalebody_1_msn\r\nmalebody_1_s\r\nmalebody_1_sk\r\n\r\nFemales:\r\nfemalebody_1\r\nfemalebody_1_msn\r\nfemalebody_1_s\r\nfemalebody_1_sk\r\n\r\nArgonianFemales:\r\nargonianfemalebody\r\nargonianfemalebody_msn\r\nargonianfemalebody_s\r\n\r\nArgonianMales:\r\nargonianmalebody\r\nargonianmalebody_msn\r\nargonianmalebody_s\r\n\r\nKhajiitFemales:\r\nfemalebody\r\nfemalebody_msn\r\nfemalebody_s\r\n\r\nKhajiitMales:\r\nbodymale\r\nbodymale_msn\r\nbodymale_s",
