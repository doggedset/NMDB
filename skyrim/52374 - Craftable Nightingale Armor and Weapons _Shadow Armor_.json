  "descriptionHtml": "This little mod allows you to craft the Nightingale Armor and Weapons without the Enchantments. \r<br />Armor can be crafted in light and heavy version. The textures for both Armors are the original ones. So if you change the textures for the Nightingale Armor, this Armor&#39;s texture will be changed, too. \r<br />\r<br />For crafting the Armor you need the &#39;Advanced Armors&#39; perk in Smithing. You will find the pieces under &#39;Daedric&#39;. \r<br />\r<br />The costs for the Armor pieces and the Weapons are the same as for the Daedric Armor pieces and Weapons. But instead of a Daedra Heart you will need Void Salts. \r<br />Void Salts are also required for upgrading. \r<br />All pieces and Weapons are enchantable. \r<br />\r<br />The stats for the light Armor are the same as the level 32+ Nightingale Armor: \r<br />Shadow Armor: 34 Armor; 12 Weight \r<br />Shadow Hood: 15 Armor, 2 Weight \r<br />Shadow Gloves: 10 Armor, 2 Weight \r<br />Shadow Boots: 10 Armor, 2 Weight \r<br />\r<br />The stats for the heavy Armor are the same as the Daedric Armor: \r<br />Heavy Shadow Armor: 49 Armor; 50 Weight \r<br />Heavy Shadow Helmet: 23 Armor, 15 Weight \r<br />Heavy Shadow Gauntlets: 18 Armor, 6 Weight \r<br />Heavy Shadow Boots: 18 Armor, 10 Weight \r<br />\r<br />The stas for the Weapons are similar to the Daedric Weapons: \r<br />Shadow Blade: 14 Damage, 15 Weight \r<br />Shadow Bow: 19 Damage, 18 Weight",
