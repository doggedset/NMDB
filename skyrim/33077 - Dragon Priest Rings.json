  "summary": "Allows the crafting of the Dragon Priest Masks as rings.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple little mod that allows you to craft 9 different rings that are enchanted with the 9 enchantments from the Dragon Priest Marks. This is my first mod and still very much a work in progress. All comments are welcome.\r\n\r\nSince version 0.2 9 new recipes have been added that allows you to duplicate any of the dragon priest masks you currently have and then use those new copies to forge the rings. This way you have to obtained the mask before you can make the ring.\r\nThe cost of duplicating a mask is current a filled black soul gem, a dragon bone, a dragon scales and the mask you want to duplicate. The recipes make 2 mask, the original one you used in the recipe, plus the new duplicate you can use to make the rings.\r\n\r\nWhat the mod adds:\r\n9 new rings that can be crafted at any forge under the jewelry category.\r\n9 new recipes that allow you to make copies of the dragon masks you currently have under the Daedric category.\r\n\r\nWhat is required:\r\nSkyrim updated to at least 1.8.\r\nLoad order really shouldn\\'t matter as the mod doesn\\'t add anything new to the game.\r\n\r\nHow to install:\r\nSimply extract the .esp file into your Data folder contained within your Skyrim folder or use NMM.\r\n\r\nFuture updates:\r\n-Add 4 more rings that have the enchantments for the 4 new Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn.\r\n-Make all rings for the left hand.\r\n-Make enchanted necklace versions of each ring.\r\n-And anything else that I end up thinking of or anything that is requested.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any ideas on how to make the mod better or anything I can add feel free to comment.\r\n\r\nThanks and happy playing!",
