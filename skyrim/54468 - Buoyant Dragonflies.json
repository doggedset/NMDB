  "descriptionHtml": "--- Description ---\r<br />Ever been having a peaceful walk alongside a stream, shouting at fish along the way (like a normal person)? Perhaps harvesting your hatchery with a few magical blizzards? Maybe you&#39;re playing with Frostfall and, while you&#39;d [i]like[/i] to catch a few dartwings, diving into freezing water to get them isn&#39;t [i]really[/i] worth the reward.\r<br />\r<br />You may have noticed that, while the fish you kill float to the surface, the dragonflies slain along with them sink to the bottom like rocks. Surely the surface tension of the water in Skyrim is greater than that.\r<br />\r<br />This mod changes the material type of the two dragonfly models from [b]SKY_HAV_MAT_CLOTH[/b], which sinks, to [b]SKY_HAV_MAT_ORGANIC[/b] which, well, doesn&#39;t sink&#33; Now, the dragonflies you&#39;re harvesting via the fantasy equivalent of blast fishing will float along the surface of the water, just like the fish you&#39;re likely killing along with them.\r<br />\r<br />--- Installation/Uninstallation ---\r<br />To install, unzip this mod&#39;s .zip into your Data directory. Preferably, use a good mod manager such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/]Mod Organizer[/url].\r<br />\r<br />To uninstall, delete both [b]Data/meshes/clutter/ingredients/dragonflyblue.nif[/b] and [b]Data/meshes/clutter/ingredients/dragonflyorange.nif[/b]. This mod includes no other files.\r<br />\r<br />--- Compatibility ---\r<br />This mod will likely not be compatible with any other mod that overwrites either dragonfly model, or adds new dragonflies to the game.\r<br />\r<br />Incompatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4955/]83Willows&#39; 101Bugs mod[/url]. I&#39;ll have to ask for permission to make a compatibility patch.\r<br />\r<br />--- Other ---\r<br />On a stroke of remarkably unfortunate timing, Wiseman303 released a mod a few hours after mine -  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54485/]Wiseman303&#39;s Critter Fixes[/url] - that includes the changes my mod makes, as well as several other similar fixes. I&#39;ll be honest, it&#39;s better than my mod, go check it out.",
