  "summary": "Adds clothing item to the leveled lists for bandit armor.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Have you noticed that every bandit in Skyrim is decked out in full armor 24-7-365?\r<br />\r<br />Well, in my opinion that is highly unrealistic. There would not be enough armor for all of them even if they robbed every smith in the country. This mod adds a very small chance that the bandits will wear clothing pieces instead of some of the armor.\r<br />\r<br />If you use a bashed patch, this should be compatible with everything. Refer to Wrye Bash documentation to learn how to set up a bashed patch.\r<br />\r<br />Bandits from other mods will only wear cloth if the author of the mod has used vanilla leveled lists to equip them.\r<br />\r<br />I am aware that this is not a mod for everyone. Some will find it ugly and/or immersion-breaking, and some might even demand my immediate execution for ruining their gaming experience. Well, I made this mod mostly for myself, and decided to upload it for the people who have even more rudimentary modding skills than I do. If you don&#39;t like it just uninstall. There are no scripts to mess up your saves.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.01 fixes an issue where some bandits would appear naked. Solved by removing hooded robes from list.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda, the entire modding community and the coffee farmers in Colombia.\r<br />\r<br />Also try my other mod, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49274/]Inhuman Soldiers[/url]",
