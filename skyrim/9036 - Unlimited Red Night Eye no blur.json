  "summary": "This Mod makes night eye in Skyrim red with no blur as well as making it last as long as you want.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first Mod ever and I changed the imagespace modifier for night eye to be a redish pinkish color and removes the blur; I also changed the time for which the spell is active. It now lasts forever and so is essentially a toggle for night eye. I thought this made more sense because you could already use it without spending magicka and I\\'m pretty sure Kajiits and Vampires should just be able to see in the dark whenever they want.\r\n\r\n This is mainly to be used for vampire characters in my opinion (hence the red) and I will eventually make different colors as well as a separation between the colors for Khajiit and vampires.
