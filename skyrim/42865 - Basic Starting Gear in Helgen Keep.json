  "descriptionHtml": "NOW AVAILABLE ON SKYRIM SPECIAL EDITION THANKS TO JenModding&#33; Download here:Â http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1135/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This rather simple mod changes the contents of the Warden&#39;s chest in Helgen Keep.\r<br />It adds some simple starting gear to the chest and does not effect anything else.\r<br />These items aren&#39;t overpowered and are early game items just to get you set up for the character build you wish to play.\r<br />\r<br />Updates: The newest version (1.2) has replaced the iron gear with Steel, changed the arrow count from 30 to 70. It has also added a complete set of imperial gear and an imperial sword, I have also added a raise dead spell tome and some necromancer gear.\r<br />Requirements: Skyrim and the latest update of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />If you enjoy this please endorse.\r<br />There shouldn&#39;t be any problems but if you have any let me know.",
