It makes the stables more realistic. cold regions have more shelter, more warmth, and a cozier feel while the warmer regions may have less hay, but still added immersion.\r<br />\r<br />[color=royalblue]--&gt; More buckets, shovels, and pitchforks added.\r<br />--&gt; More hay for more comfortable looking sleeping areas.\r<br />--&gt; Hay beds for poor folk who may need a place to rest.\r<br />--&gt; Added clutter such as crates, lanterns, and sacks.\r<br />--&gt; Expanded stable areas in certain cities.\r<br />--&gt; More horses added to give more of a &#34;stable&#34; feel without over-doing it.\r<br />--&gt; Neat and clean, remaining immersive without obsessive clutter - No performance loss.\r<br />--&gt; Cleaned with TES5 Edit.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]How to Install/Uninstall[/Size]\r<br />1) Use NMM or another mod manager\r<br />2) Install Manually by dragging and dropping the file into your Skyrim Data folder\r<br />3) To Uninstall - Delete the esp file &#34;Immersive Stables - Vanilla Edition&#34; from the Data folder or uninstall using mod manager\r<br />\r<br />[size=5] My other mods:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[URL=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52391/?][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/PlPccow.jpg?1[/IMG][/URL]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[U][B]Changelog[/B][/U]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[U][B]Known issues/Compatibility:[/B][/U]\r<br />\r<br />May conflict with other mods that make changes to the stables in Whiterun, Riften, Solitude, Markarth, and Windhelm.\r<br />",
