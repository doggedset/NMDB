  "descriptionHtml": "Ok first of all it\\'s my first mod and prolly last one :P I did that \\'cause i like realisting lighting but while playing sneak character with I always felt that torches and those light balls are kinda unrealistic (i mean common, if someone flashes u with flash light in the eyes u will notice him :P). And while there are quite a few Night Eye mods they\\'re unfair to khajiit. Whats the point of being a khajiit if any1 can use Night Eye without any cost whatsover. And i don\\'t like khajiit\\'s look so i don\\'t play one :P\r\n\r\nSo this is buyable Illusion Expert spell with 30 secs countdown and pretty heavy on magicka. \r\n\r\nIt\\'s pretty much copy paste from Bethesda\\'s invisibility with changed effect so it took me not more than 30 minutes to make. I probably won\\'t have time to correct any bugs so feel free to comment on any but I give no guarantee to correct them ^^\r\n\r\nSo credits to Bethesda for Skyrim and luser friendly CK (ppl like me :D).",
