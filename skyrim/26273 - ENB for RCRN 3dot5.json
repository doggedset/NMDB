  "descriptionHtml": "I use so many ENB to give to Skyrim the best realism and immersion. I\\'ve never found nothing that could be the \\\"perfection\\\" and each ENB had his weakness. So I decide to made an ENB by myself.  I didn\\'t create nothing, I\\'ve just taken many parts of many ENB and i make a one new.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nThis is an ENB that use the enbseries file 0.119 (http://enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0119.htm) and provided all his features such sunrays, no shadow striping, better lighting, ecc.... Combined with this ENB i use RCRN 3.5 with all his lighting effects, his sun, reflection, and more.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\n- Install RCRN 3.5 - set RCRN to CLASSIC -(choose manual or automatic) and be care that all the files .esp are installed correctly;\r\n- Install my ENB (remeber to download enbseries 0.119) and overwrite everything.\r\n\r\nWARNING - My ENB uses SMAA (set on HIGH, you can raise it until UBER on the file \\\"injector.ini\\\") that is a better and more performant antialasing so remeber to deactivate the antaliasing of the game and of your videocard.\r\n\r\nWHAT THIS ENB GIVE TO YOU\r\n\r\nThis ENB give you a great lighting effect, high quality antialiasing, sunrays effects, better shadows, dark and realisting nights (thanks to the guys of RCRN!), and scary dungeons.
