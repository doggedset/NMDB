  "descriptionHtml": "**I no longer mod or play skyrim, mod is unsupported. Use or modify it as you wish and at your own risk**\r\n\r\nQuick mod I scripted to allow you to fill empty soul gems from your inventory. Open your inventory, click the empty gem and it will replace it with a filled one.\r\n\r\nupdate 1.1:\r\n-added version that removes gold to charge soul gem. gold charge is 3 times the difference in value between the empty and filled gem.\r\n\r\nI made this mod for me, because I play under a lot of specific role playing rules to make the game harder but not more tedious. Specifically, I only charge unique weapons (like dawnbreaker, or grimsever). When a self-enchanted or non-unique weapon runs out of charge I destroy it and switch to something else, so I can\\'t just make a \\\"+12 sword of battles won\\'t ever be hard again\\\" and be done with the game, I\\'d have to go through the process of making a new one every time the charge ran out.  At the same time, I think soul trapping is tedious, so I made this to remove that part.\r\n\r\nKnown \\\"issues\\\":\r\n-Does nothing with azura\\'s star\r\n-No idea what it might do on a quest specific soul gem, I wouldn\\'t try it to be safe\r\n-You still get the \\\"Item can\\'t be equipped\\\" message\r\n-I noticed a fraction of a second of lag after clicking a soul gem, noticible if you try to charge a lot of soul gems at once I guess\r\n\r\nI\\'m really not intending to support or do anything else with this. I might do small changes if it\\'s something I can add easily, but no promises. This is not my ideal solution to making enchanting work like i want it to, but making a mod to make it work as I intend it to would take a while and I\\'m working on other projects, so I just made this as a personal stopgap. Uploading in case anyone else might find it useful.",
