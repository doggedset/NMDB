  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]4BKBdyo3i0I[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds The Shiv of Destiny to the game. This magic weapon lets players kill enemies from any distance away, and quickly transport to the enemy to perform a killmove.\r<br />\r<br />Also includes The Shiv of Destiny Fast version, which swings fives times faster than the original Shiv of Destiny. Looks particularly cool when duel wielding &#33;\r<br />\r<br />Location:\r<br />The Shiv of Destiny can be found on the same table as the player belongings chest in the Solitude jail. Also includes the fast version, and many copies for all your duel wielding needs &#33;\r<br />\r<br />Note: This mod is intended to mess around with and to have some quick fun. Not meant to be a serious weapon ;)\r<br />\r<br />Mod by Randall Herman\r<br />www.RandallHerman.com",
