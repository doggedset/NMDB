  "modName": "Magic Runes - You can use magic runes as shield",
  "summary": "Add some magic runes as shields.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Firstly here are some statements about the graphics I am using.They are not my original works.Some of them were found on websites where people share their resources or those providing resources for the public to download,and others are from some famous animes.I love their magnificent forms so I want to see them in Skyrim.I don\\'t know their authors and their original names so I named them myself.If their authors are unwilling about my behaviour ,please be sure to let me know. I will cancel this MOD if I\\'m not accredited and I\\'m really sorry about that.At least it is promised that I won\\'t use them for commercial purpose.\r\nHere are the websites where I found them.\r\nhttp://tieba.baidu.com/p/1399534880\r\nhttp://www.nipic.com/show/2/61/7132820k4c567179.html\r\n\r\n\r\nThis MOD is NOT-AT-ALL lore-friendly,if you do not like this style,I\\'m very sorry for that :(\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n\r\nSome simply modified magics are now avalable , they are all sold by Farengar in the Dragonsreach.\r\n\r\nWhile making the magics I found myself not very good at dealing with magics , so maybe I should concentrate more on the shields. The magics are not perfect , some problems still exist ,please don\\'t consider them too seriously. I hope there could be an expert who can improve them into real magic - everyone is welcome :)\r\n\r\nVersion 1.01\r\n\r\n-Fixed some little graphical bugs\r\n-Added a Non-Glowing version for those who don\\'t like shiny things\r\n\r\nI\\'ve always been thinking that the magics in Skyrim look so simple.While I\\'m new on making MODs,the only I can do to make the game look more \\\"magical\\\" is to make this small MOD.After I publiced this MOD, I found that almost everyone hopes that they can work as graphics of magics.At first I just wanted to use them to take screenshots , so I didn\\'t consider about their practical functions... Another reason why I didn\\'t set them as accessible magics is that I don\\'t know how to export a file with animation.Though it\\'s a little hard for a newcomer like me , I will try to make it .But it would be better if someone could teach me how to make a .nif file move...\r\n\r\nSeveral magic runes are added in the game.There are two versions - the smaller ones can be armored as shields and the larger ones are just misc items,you can throw them onto the ground.Of course they are useless except for taking screenshots :p.\r\n\r\nYou can forge all the  magic runes on the smithing forge , Daedra category.\r\n\r\nKnown BUGs: if the ground is not very plane , some parts of the magic runes may sink under ground.\r\nIf your computer is slow running , there is a possibility to cause CTD.\r\nIf CTD accurs when loading your game, just try to load anther savegame,and then load it.\r\n\r\nI\\'m still studying things about MODs,so every suggest is welcome,and it will be better if you can teach me how to set it as an accessory...\r\n\r\nIf you like this MOD, that would be my pleasure.",
