  "descriptionHtml": "[center][i]So this was an armor I was designing, and for the most part it came along well. Sadly, I lack the skills to bring it to Skyrim. I&#39;m not happy with how the LoPoly is turning out, and I have no knowledge on how to rig or weight the armor. I&#39;m hoping someone skilled can finish this armor for us all. \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve included all Hi-Poly meshes, Lo-Poly meshes, the texture maps, normal maps, and AO maps..\r<br />\r<br />The idea was there, just not the skill :( but I&#39;ve gotten a lot better at all of it.\r<br />\r<br />Hope you all enjoy, and feel free to leave feedback about it and for the love of everything enjoyable, someone PLEASE finish it&#33;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[i][u]CREDITS:[/u]\r<br />Credit me if you use this resource in any mod, of course give your self credit for implementing it and/or retexturing it[/i].\r<br />\r<br />[i]DO NOT UPLOAD THIS ARMOR OR ANY VERSION (retexture) TO ANY SITE OTHER THAN NEXUS[/i][/center]",
