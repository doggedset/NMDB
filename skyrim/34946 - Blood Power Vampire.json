  "modName": "Blood Power Vampire",
  "summary": "Changes Vampires to be more powerful the more recently they have fed.  As they go longer without feeding, their spells and resistances get weaker, and their weakness to fire and sunlight gets stronger.  Also includes upgrades if you have become a hybrid.",
  "descriptionHtml": "v1.1 changes the messages displayed when feeding and growing more hungry to be more accurate.\r\n\r\nThis was a very basic mod I decided to make for my own Vampire, and figured others may like it as well. It currently requires Dawnguard, because that is the version of the scripts I was working with, but if anyone would like it converted for vanilla, just place a post or message me, and I will get a vanilla version implemented.\r\n\r\nAlso includes upgrades if you have become a hybrid.  Checks vanilla globals (PlayerIsVampire and PlayerIsWerewolf) to determine Hybrid status.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n----- Hybrid Explanation ------\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nMy theory behind the Hybrid\\'s abilities is this.  The Beast Blood is so full of energy it keeps you from being rested.  As such, It is strong enough to maintain your abilities at their highest regardless of how starved you are.  And in turn, the power your abilities bleed off allow you to gain the rested bonus.\r\nAlso the additional strength protects you from sunlight and fire, but only when you are mostly fed.\r\nThe rested bonus can be removed by deleting the PlayerSleepQuestScript.pex file from the Data/Scripts folder\r\n\r\n-------------------------------\r\n----- Ability Details ------\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis mod changes the benefits at each stage of vampirism as follows:\r\nVanilla stage 1\r\n[list]\r\n[*]20% Frost Resist\r\n[*]20% Weakness to Fire\r\n[*]Vampiric Drain (Stage 1)\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Servant (Stage 1)\r\n[*]No regen, all stats reduced by 15\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nBlood Power Vampire Stage 1\r\n[list]\r\n[*]50% Frost Resist\r\n[*]20% Weakness to Fire\r\n[*]Vampiric Drain (Stage 4)\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Servant (Stage 4)\r\n[*]No regen, all stats reduced by 15\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Seduction\r\n[*]Embrace of Shadows\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nVanilla Stage 2\r\n[list]\r\n[*]30% Frost Resist\r\n[*]30% Weakness to Fire\r\n[*]Vampiric Drain (Stage 2)\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Servant (Stage 2)\r\n[*]No regen, all stats reduced by 30\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Seduction\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nBlood Power Vampire Stage 2\r\n[list]\r\n[*]40% Frost Resist\r\n[*]30% Weakness to Fire\r\n[*]Vampiric Drain (Stage 3)\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Servant (Stage 3)\r\n[*]No regen, all stats reduced by 30\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Seduction\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nVanilla Stage 3\r\n[list]\r\n[*]40% Frost Resist\r\n[*]40% Weakness to Fire\r\n[*]Vampiric Drain (Stage 3)\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Servant (Stage 3)\r\n[*]No regen, all stats reduced by 45\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Seduction\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nBlood Power Vampire Stage 3\r\n[list]\r\n[*]30% Frost Resist\r\n[*]40% Weakness to Fire\r\n[*]Vampiric Drain (Stage 2)\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Servant (Stage 2)\r\n[*]No regen, all stats reduced by 45\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Seduction\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nVanilla Stage 4\r\n[list]\r\n[*]50% Frost Resist\r\n[*]50% Weakness to Fire\r\n[*]Vampiric Drain (Stage 4)\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Servant (Stage 4)\r\n[*]No regen, all stats reduced by 60\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Seduction\r\n[*]Embrace of Shadows\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nBlood Power Vampire Stage 4\r\n[list]\r\n[*]20% Frost Resist\r\n[*]50% Weakness to Fire\r\n[*]Vampiric Drain (Stage 1)\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Servant (Stage 1)\r\n[*]No regen, all stats reduced by 60\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nAnything not specified above remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nFor Hybrid, All stages have all positive benefits of Vampire at their strongest.\r\nStage 1 has no negatives, and includes a 50% Health, Stamina, and Magicka regeneration buff\r\nStage 2 has no negatives, but does not have the regen buff.\r\nStage 3 has 20% weakness to fire\r\nStage 4 has 30% weakness to fire, and the vanilla stage 1 sunlight weakness.\r\nHybrids also can gain a sleep bonus.\r\n\r\nThis mod will overwrite the VampirePlayerQuestScript.pex file, so as such it will overwrite any other mod that modifies this file.\r\n\r\nThis is a very beta release, as I have never made a skyrim mod before.  \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nExtract the BloodPowerVampireHybrid.esp into the Data folder\r\nExtract the PlayerVampireQuestScript.pex file into the Data/Scripts folder.\r\nExtract the PlayerVampireQuestScript.psc file into the Data/Scripts/Source folder if you want the source.\r\nIf you don\\'t want the sleep bonus, skip this step.\r\nExtract the PlayerSleepQuestScript.pex file into the Data/Scripts folder.\r\nExtract the PlayerSleepQuestScript.psc file into the Data/Scripts/Source folder if you want the source.\r\n",
