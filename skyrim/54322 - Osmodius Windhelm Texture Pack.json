Your feedback has a huge impact on my mods. \r<br />\r<br />This is a hi-res texture replacer for Windhelm. Built for a dark and gritty setting, I have been working on this mod since my Solitude texture pack. Each texture has gone through several changes and modifications to get the right look. There are 2 versions to choose from based on your computer&#39;s specifications,  Ultra and Regular.\r<br />\r<br />The Ultra pack includes a mix of 4k textures, 2K textures, and 1k uncompressed normals and may cause fps loss. The Regular pack contains 2k textures and 1k compressed normals and should not impact your performance much at all.\r<br />\r<br />I also added an alternative to the street stone texture to have a less jarring transition between the textures on the ground, see screenshot for details.\r<br />\r<br />Parallax maps are included but they will have no effect if you do not have Project Parallax Remastered and a recent version of ENB. You can still use this mod just fine without Project Parallax Remastered and ENB. \r<br />DO NOT RUN ddsopt&#33; These textures are already fully optimized and ddsopt will lower the quality&#33;\r<br />If you like this mod, check out my other ones:\r<br />\r<br />Solitude Texture Pack  -  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53879/?\r<br />Project Parallax Remastered  -  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40512/?\r<br />Normal Map Tutorial  -  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40801/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />(Insatallation)\r<br />Install using NMM or drag the &#34;textures&#34; folder into your skyrim/data folder and click &#34;yes to all&#34; when prompted to do so.\r<br />\r<br />(Compatibility)\r<br />This mod is not compatible with other texture packs that change the same textures in Windhelm.\r<br />\r<br />(Credits)\r<br />Me for the textures, and Bethesda for the game.",
