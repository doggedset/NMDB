  "descriptionHtml": "PLEASE GO HERE TO GET DAWNGUARD COMPATIBLE VERSION http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28494/ Huge thanks to SolarTails for fixing :)\r\n\r\nSub-mod for my main knights of the nine mod http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18114/\r\nPlease endorse if you like to inspire me to keep improving :)\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWHAT TO DO\r\n\r\nTravel to the \\\"Hall of the Vigilant\\\" south of Dawnstar (see screenshot). In the basement you will find two magical mannequins and a staff. These relics were sent down by the divines to the Vigilants of Stendarr to keep in holding until someone was worthy enough to wield them. It\\'s not just a walk in a park to get to the \\\"hall of the Vigilant\\\" and be prepared for a fast paced fight around the boarders of the hall.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nDonators.\r\nA huge thank you to users that have decided to make a donation. It is really appreciated. Thanks!\r\n- FelxcolossiCXx \r\n- Tfig2110\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\nThank you to Zenl for letting me use his cape mesh as a base for my modified version. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11784\r\n\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Permissions/////////////////\r\nThe assets that I created in this mod are now able to be used as modders recourses but with a few guidelines to be followed.\r\n1. If you use some of these assets you must clearly credit in the mod description and include the link as well.\r\n2. You cannot re-release this exact mod just as it is as your own unless it is a language translation.\r\n3. You cannot release as a armor mod based on Knights of the nine armor. (As I still have plans for this in the future). You can how ever make quests for knights of the nine.\r\n4. If you use my assets then give someone else permission to use your assets you must inform them that they have to credit as well.\r\nFeel free to message me about any of these points",
