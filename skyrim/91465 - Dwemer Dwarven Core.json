When the lightning resistance is 100% or more, You can completely absorb all magic damage taken and the Destruction spell effect becomes 2 mult.\n<br />The overload damage can not be avoided by fortify magic resistance or lightning resistance.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Aetherial Transform Core-Quality Conversion Mode[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Increase armor rating 800 point , reduce and prevent the physical attack below &lt;100&gt;. Alteration spells cost &lt;50&gt;% less to cast and gain the ability of the Aetherial Fusion,\n<br />You can become ethereal at temporarily.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Now, if you have \"dwarven carfter\" and \"Ancient Knowledge\" , You can reselect and make different core on smelter and smithing forge.\n<br />\n<br />------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />You can careful look at the shelves of Aetherium Forge\n<br />After obtaining the necessary items, it can be manufactured in the forging \n<br />furnace of Ethylene\n<br />You can only choose one\n<br />Equipment slot is 49\n<br />Does not conflict with Dwemer Exoskeleton or Dwarven Goggles\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=3]How to install[/size][/color]\n<br />Load the file with the manager\n<br />No other things to pay attention to\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/color]\n<br />No overwrite vanilla data\n<br />Other mod new dwarven weapons or armor can function properly if they have the \n<br />happened keywords\n<br />All enchantment effects are independent\n<br />Therefore, the ability part is calculated separately from other MODs.\n<br />Can be used with Perk overhaul or new enchant mod\n<br />There may be problems with the module that was modified to the Aetherium Forge FormID\n<br />Because the new necessary material is located in the Aetherium Forge\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=3]How to uninstall[/size][/color]\n<br />Although it may seem a bit complicated, this mod does not add any extra script\n<br />There is also no change to the original value or levellist\n<br />Just put the new item into the container and save then exit\n<br />You can easily and this crazy stuff say bye bye.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=1]Forgive me for my English\n<br />Thanks Miss GOOGLE:)[/size]",
