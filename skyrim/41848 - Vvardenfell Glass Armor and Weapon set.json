  "descriptionHtml": "ATTENTION: I'm not really sure how leveled lists work, so, if anyone can tweak this to place the items only near morrowind and solstheim, i'd be really grateful. Meanwhile, the items ARE included in the leveled lists as random loot... OR... you can steal Irileth's armor, haha!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was included in the mod Morrowind armor for Skyrim. The mod page has permissions to edit and tweak the mod as we saw fit... And i didn\\'t see it fitting with Dragonborn once it was updated to 1.2 and lost many, many of its items. The mod also seems abandoned after the 1.2 patch for dragonborn was released. A shame, it at least had sets of bonemold and citin weapons.\r\n\r\nThis armor was originally made by Bingles, and it was called Splinter Glass armor. I asked for permission to upload the tweaked meshes here.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds his splinter glass armor, tweaked by the Morrowind armor for Skyrim team[?] to have sleeves, a few extra details, and an eye cover on the helmet. The helmet works on beast races and orcs, and there is also a set of weapons - Those will be kept, thankfully, because replacers can be used on them. Already got a bow, sword and greatsword, thanks to Insanitysorrow and a bit of patience. Can't share these models, tho.\r\n\r\nAll items can be crafted with the glass smithing perk and are included on leveled lists AND adds an helmet-less outfit for Irileth, because she\\'s been all over the place already, and is a dark elf. The armor really suits her IMO.\r\n\r\nCompatibilty:\r\nOverwrites anything that tweaks Irileth, obviously. If you have Ethereal Elven Overhaul, place this esp after it and Irileth should get her facelift AND the new armor.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBingles for the models.\r\nMorrowind Glass Armor team for the tweaked models and new green textures\r\nPlanetSlayer for initial help with trimming down the MorrowindArmor esp\r\nTes5Edit for making the trimming and cleaning faster and less painful.\r\nLrsarmways, for granting permission to use some meshes from Expanded Skyrim Weaponry.",
