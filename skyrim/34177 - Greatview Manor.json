  "summary": "A new, stylish, completely upgradeable player home in the Rift. Hearthfire is NOT required",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a stylish, upgradeable house named \\'Greatview manor\\' into the game.\r\n\r\nAs said, you can fully upgrade this house and sometimes you also have to choose - do you want a noisy bard or better some supplies?\r\nThe house is located in the rift and has a map marker right in front of it. To purchase upgrades go to the nearby argonian - he will love to sell them to you.\r\n\r\nMost Screenshots are Before - Then - After Screenshots; Before is the Stage before tidy up, The next one is is with the \\'tidy up\\' upgrade but without the specified Upgrade for that room and \\'After\\' when the specified Upgrade is activated. Also the Lightning in the furnished Screenshots may seem dark but it is actually pretty lighty now\r\n\r\nI recommend purchasing the \\'Tidy Up\\' upgrade first and also activating it, else it may cause some major glitches.\r\n\r\nWhen you fully upgraded your new stylish home you will have all crafting stations with some resources, all shrines of the divines a bard who will sing for you, a new unique follower as well as an arrow merchant who is also an expert marksman trainer.\r\n\r\nThe available upgrades are:\r\n- [b]Tidy Up:[/b] Tidies  your home \r\n- [b]Entrance hall:[/b] furnishes your entrance hall\r\n- [b]dinner hall:[/b] furnishes your dinner hall, including a cooking spot\r\n- [b]Empty space 1st floor:[/b] Fills your empty space on the 1st floor\r\n- [b]Shrines:[/b] adds shrines of all divines to the first floor\r\n- [b]Magic room:[/b] Adds enchanters and alchemy table with ingredients and furniture\r\n- [b]Sleeping room:[/b] Furnishes your sleeping room\r\n- [b]Empty space 2nd floor:[/b] Fills the empty space in the second floor\r\n- [b]Bard room:[/b] Adds a bard as well as his rooms.
