  "modName": "Toggable Werewolf Nighteye howl",
  "summary": "Adds toggable Nighteye to all werewolf howls (exept \\\"call of the wild\\\")",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ok, you\\'re a werewolf, a terrible beast that stalks the night preying upon the unwary. When they see you it is already to late. That is if it wasn\\'t for the fact that the werewolf is night blind and unable to see in the dark. (Or smell where your enemies are hiding)\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re like me and you\\'re using RCRN - realistic colors and Real Nights or something similar that affects the lights, making dungeons and nights darker then you\\'ve probably come across this problem. When you shift into your wolf-form you can\\'t see a bloody thing since your torch is put away or light spell vanishes. This mod has a solution to that problem.\r\n\r\nWhat it does:\r\nThis mod adds the Night eye effect to your werewolf howls (except Call of the wild). Now you can finally see what you are doing even under the cover of night. Nighteye is now a permanent toggle effect, lasting until canceled. Tap the howl button to use your chosen howl, hold to activate or turn off the nighteye effect.\r\n\r\nOptional version*:\r\nThis version also adds the Aura Whisper effect to your howls as well as the night eye effect, to simulate your enhanced sense of smell.\r\n(Note that you should only use one of these files)\r\n\r\n*(outdated version, this version simply adds the aura whisper and nighteye to your howls and the effect is not toggable).\r\n\r\nUpdate 2.0\r\nNighteye is now a permanent toggle effect, lasting until canceled. Thanks go to weich for the night eye permanent effect. (His original mod http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16262).\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.1\r\nAdded night eye for the summon howl and increased its duration to 60 seconds up from 45. Old version still available.\r\n\r\nAdded optional version which adds the Aura Whisper to your howls.\r\n\r\n",
