  "modName": "Remove Blood and Gore Mod - Skyrim For Teens",
  "summary": "If you\\'ve got over-protective parents, this mod is for you. It removes most blood and gore from the game. Thanks to Citizen86, a Modder here, the blood is removed, and I put together a few things to touch it up and put it in this Mod pack. I have also removed some burnt bodies but it isn\\'t perfect. Know that I am still working on it slowly.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Want to make Skyrim more appropriate, as if it were rated T for teen? Now you can. Finally I have developed a working modification for that, along with Citizen86\\'s mod for No blood, you can take away blood, gore, and a few more \\\"inappropriate\\\" things in the game, making it suitable for ages 14+.\r\n I\\'m no ESRB rater, but after this mod is installed, with it, I\\'d rate it\r\n TEEN for: Violence, Suggestive themes, Language.\r\n\r\n Alright, so my mod will come in a \\\"package\\\" (zipped folder) with both Citizen86\\'s mod and mine, for convenience.\r\n\r\n",
