  "descriptionHtml": "Ever played Final Fantasy XII or XIV? \r<br />\r<br />Well in them you have Espers and Raid Bosses who happen to be HUGE and tough as hell. \r<br />\r<br />Anyways, I&#39;m trying to make bosses like these so I made one to see if I have potential to do this. \r<br />\r<br />This is just a demo version so I would like some feedback about it if possible. \r<br />\r<br />Also if the community likes it I will try to make a boss dungeon (inspired in FFXIV). \r<br />\r<br />This mod basically gives you a boss room near the Whiterun castle. \r<br />To fight the boss, enter the black door to the left of Dragonsreach. \r<br />After killing the boss you can loot a summoning tome from his corpse. \r<br />I suggest you bring some friends to kill him.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Sadly, in the end he became simply a Dragon Priest with higher stats, I gave him some crazy spells to use but they made him buggy. I&#39;m still new to modding so it may be just a lame mod. \r<br />\r<br />If you liked the mod, please endorse&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Requires:\r<br />\r<br />The latest Skyrim version.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Just put everything in the Skyrim data folder or use the great Nexus Manager.\r<br />\r<br />Have fun.",
