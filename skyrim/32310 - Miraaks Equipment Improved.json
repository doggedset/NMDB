  "descriptionHtml": "Were you ever disappointed how bad Miraak\\'s gear was? This mod aims to improve the stats and enchantments on Miraak\\'s armour. His weapons won\\'t be affected though, since there are already so many mods out there that do that. Here are the current improvements:\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG:\r\n\r\n3.0a\r\n*Clothes version added! For those who prefer Alteration spells :)\r\n*New enchantment to the gloves, which fortifies Destruction spells by 20%(if I\\'m correct)\r\n\r\n2.0 - 2.0b\r\n*Tentacle explosion damage increased, now does at least SOME damage to NPCs, instead of the usual nothing(it does damage, but they regenerate very quickly)\r\n*Fire and Frost breath damage ahs been increased.\r\n*Fixed the massive cooldown glitch with Miraak\\'s mask, now works properly.\r\n*Dragon Infusion now works correctly.\r\n*Boots now also add a 10% to Miraak\\'s Robes spell absorption. This was originally intended, but in the end I forgot about it.\r\n*Fixed minor glitches in the \\'Active Effects\\' section.\r\n*Value has been decreased. It now ranges from 3000 to 23000 Septims.\r\n\r\nTo apply the updates, just remove the old file and replace it with this one. In-game, drop Miraak\\'s armour and then pick it up. Re-equip it and the new enchantments shoud apply.\r\n\r\nALL:\r\n* Value of everything has been heavily increased. This is because they\\'re unique items, used by a Dragon Priest himself that was Dragonborn! I know most vendors won\\'t have the money to buy this, but why would you want to sell it anyway? Merchants aren\\'t supposed to afford unique relics, are they?\r\n* Fire and Frost breath shout damage increased, matching Miraak\\'s version of the shouts.\r\n\r\nMIRAAK(Mask):\r\nAll versions, no matter light or heavy have an enchantment of +70 magicka and fortify Shouts by 20%.\r\n\r\nMIRAAK\\'S ROBES:\r\nSame as before,but now also adds the \\\"Dragon Infusion\\\" perk, which allows dragons to do 25% less melee damage. The Tentacle Explosion, instead of doing 100 damage, now does 150.\r\n\r\nMIRAAK\\'S GLOVES:\r\nNow instead of giving a 5% extra bonus, they give a 10% extra boost to spell absorption of Miraak\\'s robes. Also fortifies Destruction spells by 20%.\r\n\r\nMIRAAK\\'S BOOTS:\r\nAllows the user to walk on water, similar to Azhidal\\'s boots. It also adds an additional 10% to spell absorption.",
