  "descriptionHtml": "A race hiding among the nords of Skyrim has been discovered, the Unblood. \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;The Unblood were designed for a stealth build, but obviously like any race in Skyrim can do anything. They have two very powerful passive abilities, they can be poisoned and are immune to disease. This is due to their lack of blood. Instead their bodies are supported by a magic aura which I&#39;ve yet to find a way to implement that Iike. Instead a basic, short invisibility power is currently a place holder.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;This is my first mod, so recommendations and feedback would be greatly appreciated. Currently I&#39;m working on unique presets and that&#39;s what&#39;s planned for the first update. Thanks for taking a look.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[b]*WARNING*\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;THERE IS NO VAMPIRE COMPATIBILITY ON PURPOSE&#33;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[/b]They don&#39;t have blood, they can&#39;t contract diseases. There is no reason for unbloods to immersively turn into vampires, but ifÂ I get asked enough I&#39;ll implement it in a future update.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[b]*REQUIREMENTS*\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[/b][b][font=Palatino Linotype]Skyrim.esm\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Dawnguard.esm\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[/font][/b][b][font=Palatino Linotype]RaceCompatibility for Skyrim and Dawnguard (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24168/?)\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[/font][/b]",
