  "descriptionHtml": "[color=deepskyblue][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nI wasn\\'t satisfied with any of the currently uploaded retextures, so I handled it myself. It\\'s just a quick one, but it is sufficient. Resolution is 1024x1024 to preserve detail. I don\\'t have any plans to release any other resolutions for this particular mod.\r\n\r\n[color=deepskyblue][b]INSTALLATION[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nTo Install these textures: \r\n\r\n1. Unpack the .rar into your Skyrim/ directory.\r\n2. Select yes if a permission box pops up to overwrite any other quest textures that may be floating around.\r\n\r\nTo Uninstall just delete the files pertinent to this mod.\r\n\r\n[color=deepskyblue][b]OTHER INFO[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: None so far. I can\\'t fathom one that would arise. It\\'s all fairly straight-forward\r\n\r\n- I\\'ll likely have other texture mods in the future, be sure to keep an eye out.\r\n\r\n- Feel free to do what you wish with this mod without requesting permission. I would like to be provided with a link to any mod that uses my resources, however.\r\n\r\n[color=deepskyblue][b]MY MODS[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2052][color=deepskyblue]Ethereal Elven Equipment[/color][/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4884][color=deepskyblue]DRAGONHOOD[/color][/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5204][color=deepskyblue]Unusual Gem Redux[/color][/url]",
