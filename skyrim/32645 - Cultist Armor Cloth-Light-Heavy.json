  "descriptionHtml": "[B][I][U]Requires Dragonborn DLC[/U][/I][/B]\r\n\r\nyes, i know there are several other mods that fix this mishap however from looking at the comments on most of them i kept seeing that it didnt fully work well with the mage armor perk which for me is kind of a big letdown.\r\n\r\ni tried doing this before when dragonborn came out but only changed 1-2 things on the item info and while it did appear as cloth ingame, it did not work with the mage armor perk. this time i tried playing abit with the CK and chaning some of the keywords while looking at other items (circlets and clothing gloves) to get the correct keywords needed to work and viola! it worked.\r\n\r\nanother thing i changed is simply to remove that god-awful magicka regen enchantment on the cultist robes so now you can put your own enchantment on them.\r\n\r\nsince the most annoying part of it is done, getting it to work with the mage armor perk. also decided to play around with the other 2 armor types and make a version for each.\r\n\r\nthe Light version will be about as strong as Leather Armor since this armor looks like itd have some sort of protection from those jagged things on the arms and gloves.\r\n\r\nthe Heavy version will be about as strong as the Steel Plate armor, as most \\\"heavy\\\" armors before Steel Plate are slightly weaker than leather\r\n\r\nThe Heavy version of the armors can be improved with the standard Steel ingot, as i based its armor rating on the steel plate.\r\nThe Light version of the armors can be improved with the standard Leather (not leather strips) again cause its armor rating is based on leather armor\r\n\r\nsince this is merely a simple edit of the ingame armor, when downloading choose only 1 version.\r\n\r\nThanks to Because for the link to make the light and heavy versions improveable",
