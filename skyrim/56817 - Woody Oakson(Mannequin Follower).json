I can´t get him to use it, but there´s a spell tome in the room where he was originally. \r<br />-He has gauntlets with a custom enchantment. You can´t get them, but it´s nothing you couldn´t do yourself if you´re a good enchanter. \r<br />-He has ragged trousers, and you don´t see that often on a follower,do you? \r<br />-He will carry your armor [b]AND[/b] your weapons&#33; \r<br />-If you like the sound of bears, [b]he even has a custom dialogue option for that&#33;[/b] \r<br />-And he just causes death and destruction \r<br />\r<br />Update 1.1: \r<br />-[b]He is now marriable&#33;[/b] I don´t know why someone said that would be terryfying \r<br />\r<br />~~~~[b]Probably-about-to-be-asked-Questions (PAQ)[/b]~~~~ \r<br />[i]Where can I find him?[/i] \r<br />- Seriously...? \r<br />\r<br />[i]Is he marriable?[/i] \r<br />- Maybe in a future update \r<br />\r<br />[i]That´s awesome&#33;[/i] \r<br />- That´s not a question...",
