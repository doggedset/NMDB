  "descriptionHtml": "This isn\\'t my first mod but it\\'s the first I\\'ve ever shared or submitted to the Nexus.  This mod adds a 1-handed rapier-type sword to Skyrim.  This latest version makes some changes:\r\n-The base item is unenchanted and you can craft it at any forge\r\n-The enchanted version must be made at the Skyforge, and requires the plain weapon as an ingredient\r\n-There is also a more powerful and unique \\\"Grand\\\" version located where the enchanted one was in the earlier version of the file.  A particular key is now required and is located on a nearby corpse\r\n-All versions of the weapon are somewhat visually distinctive from each other thanks to revised textures and a glow map on the Grand version\r\n-I have added somewhat of a story to the weapon...not a real quest but kind of a fun mystery to solve in order to get all the backstory.  If you want to do this you would start in Riften; the first clue is in the Bee and Barb and should lead you to the rest\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nI have tested this file fairly thoroughly and have had very few problems so far, but there is a chance that using the new file will cause your character to lose the sword if they already have it.  If this is a major problem for you, keep in mind that the old version is still available for re-download just in case.",
