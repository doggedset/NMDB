The watchtower is situated right next to the Riverville tavern, left behind by a Keeper to perform their duties in Ark. The home has an enchanting and alchemy station, fair storage, a player bed, so forth. Other stations exist in Riverville proper. \r<br />The new items in question are a slightly stronger and faster 1-h keeper sword, an unenchanted Kilean bow, Assassin gloves/boots and a city guard cuirass and shield.\r<br />Admittedly, it does not have many bells nor whistles. It&#39;s pretty spartan. But if you like elegance in simplicity, I hope you enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Enderal was an amazing experience in my first playthru, and the second is sure to provide more of the same. This was more of a personal mod, and may not fit the bill for some others, and that&#39;s okay&#33; I may have the ambition sometime soon to make a whole new settlement in Enderal to honor the remarkable work of the SureAI team. \r<br />\r<br />Walk blessed&#33;[/center]",
