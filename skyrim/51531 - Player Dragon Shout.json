  "descriptionHtml": "Dragon Voice\r<br />\r<br />I am sure this has probably been done, however this is my rendition of shout editing to make it more immersive &#34;in my opinion&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Modifies shouts: Fire breath, ice breath and storm call, giving the player shouts more like the dragon.\r<br />\r<br />Fire breath;  First word Unchanged due to the Parthurnax first encounter, Parthurnax attacks if the first word is edited, word 2 is exchanged for dragon fire 3, word 3 is exchanged for dragon fire 5, time outs unchanged.\r<br />\r<br />Frost breath: Word 1 exchanged for dragon frost breath 1, word 2 for dragon frost breath 2 and word 3 for dragon frost breath 3, time outs unchanged.\r<br />\r<br />Storm call: First and second words unchanged, word 3 exchanged for dragon storm call, time outs unchanged.\r<br />\r<br />No scripts or animations changed or edited. Simple edit using vanilla resources, strength of shouts unedited. No other mods needed, suggest a new game as i have only tested it on a new game, will obviously conflict with anything that modifies the same other than that, should not conflict with anything else.",
