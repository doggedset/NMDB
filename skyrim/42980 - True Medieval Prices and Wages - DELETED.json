One septim has same value as Medieval England farthing (1/4 pence) and now uses Bronze texture\r<br />\r<br />[b]Armor[/b]\r<br />Armor now is very expensive. Most people can afford only something made of fur or leather. Good armor like steel, elven, scaled is very expensive and usually can be afforded only by professional warriors (soldiers, mercenaries, adventurers, experienced bandits etc). Best unique armor.. As expensive as those gilded and ornated with gems armors worn by dukes and kings.\r<br />Prices gap between good light armor and heavy armor now is much lower. Yes. It is realistic too.\r<br />Light armor below elven light x5\r<br />Light armor from elven light and below nightingale x15\r<br />Light armor from nightingale and better x30\r<br />Heavy armor below ebony x10\r<br />Heavy armor from ebony and better x20\r<br />\r<br />[b]Weapons[/b]\r<br />Weapons are very expensive too. Swords are much more expensive than axes and maces. Please don&#39;t complain about it because it is historically accurate. Bows are relatively cheap.\r<br />1H and 2H Swords x10\r<br />1H and 2H Maces x5\r<br />1H and 2H Axes x5\r<br />Daggers x5\r<br />Bows x1\r<br />Arrows x1\r<br />Everything better than elven additionally x2 (same as best armor)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Clothes[/b]\r<br />Clothes are expensive. Most clothes cost 200-300 septims. Jarl clothes... They cost almost like a full suit of steel armor. Just imagine it.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Food and alcohol[/b]\r<br />Untouched. I&#39;m going to work directly with basic needs mods. Food will be relatively cheap (base value of simple food without modifiers few septims a day).\r<br />Note: commoners usually ate rye bread which was much cheaper than wheat bread. However we have only wheat bread in Skyrim :( So perhaps I will make it cheaper.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Gems and jewellery[/b]\r<br />x5\r<br />\r<br />[b]Clutter[/b]\r<br />Changed. Now it is not so cheap as it was.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Hides[/b]\r<br />Changed. More expensive now (mostly x2)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Ingots[/b]\r<br />x2, rare ingots x4, leather untouched.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Books[/b]\r<br />Very expensive. All books x100. Skill books x15 (much closer in value to usual books now).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Spell tomes[/b]\r<br />x5\r<br />\r<br />[b]Scrolls[/b]\r<br />x5\r<br />\r<br />[b]Enchanted clothing, armor, weapons[/b]\r<br />Value of enchanted item = base item value + effect value\r<br />Really formula is more complicated but nevermind.\r<br />Value of all effects x10 (roughly... Many nuances here)\r<br />Soul gems x10\r<br />Basic value of all items are also correct\r<br />\r<br />[b]Horses[/b]\r<br />5000 septims for a horse\r<br />\r<br />[b]Houses and furniture[/b]\r<br />Gap between simple and rich houses now much bigger.\r<br />Whiterun, Riften x1\r<br />Markath, Windhelm x4\r<br />Solitude x3\r<br />\r<br />[b]Ingredients and potions[/b]\r<br />Mostly untouched. But pearls now are very expensive&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Mercenary[/b]\r<br />5000 septims\r<br />3 months salary for a man-at-arms, or 6 months for armored footsoldier, or a year for archer... Anyway I feel it&#39;s okay.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=14]Jobs (with any basic needs mod):[/size][/b]\r<br />Woodcutter and miner:\r<br />You must install RP chopping and mining. You still can sell ore to merchants for good money... But if you roleplay an honest man than you should sell it to owners of the mine or sawmill and get your small-but-realistic sallary. You will earn 1 septim for 1 hour of chopping or mining.\r<br />Note: your sallary for mining sometimes can be rounded down and you will lose 1 septim. You will never encounter such issue if you mine for 10 hours and take payment only after this.\r<br />\r<br />Hunter:\r<br />I strongly advice you to use one of the mods which dynamically change timescale. This way you will not hunt too many animals a day. Hunting can be quite profitable but remember that it is also quite dangerous.\r<br />\r<br />Fisher:\r<br />I don&#39;t know. Please write me about your experience. (especially with fishing mods)\r<br />\r<br />Alchemist:\r<br />I don&#39;t know.\r<br />\r<br />Blacksmith:\r<br />If you truly love realism then don&#39;t go smithing. Seriously. It is stupid when you craft 50 or even 500 daggers and suddenly become able to craft daedric stuff. People spent years to learn craft. So I advise you to use this mod instead\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14474/]SHARPE Craftsmanship - Made to order by Herko ter Horst[/url]\r<br />But if you still want to be smith... One of the my mod features is that materials needed to craft weapon or armor always costs less (usually 10-15% without modifiers) than ready weapon or armor. Enjoy\r<br />\r<br />Trader:\r<br />Your spouse will make from 30 to 70 septims a day and will give you half (15-35)\r<br />\r<br />[size=14][b]Crime bounties[/b][/size]\r<br />Based on the Ancient Germanic Laws (I think it is suitable enough for nords). And they are now big. Really big\r<br />Default bounties are mostly based on the &#34;Lex Frisionum&#34;.\r<br />There is also optional file &#34;Higher Bounties&#34;. These are based on the &#34;Lex Saxonum&#34;. These laws were compiled by the Franks who conquered Saxons and wanted to break down possible resistance with very severe punishments. Use it if you feel that it better suits a country in the middle of the Civil War.\r<br />Crime Default/Higher Bounties\r<br />Murder 25 000 / 65 000\r<br />Assault 2 000/6 000\r<br />Trespass 4 000/12 000\r<br />Pickpocket 1 000/3 000\r<br />Steal Multiplier x3 / x10\r<br />Escape 2 500/6 500\r<br />Werewolf/Vampire Lord 25 000 / 65 000\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=14]Merchant&#39;s gold[/size][/b]\r<br />Due to the known bug I had to limit their gold to 25 000 septims. Of course different vendors have different amounts of money.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=14]Gold loot and quest rewards[/size][/b]\r<br />All bosses now are much reacher. Rewards for big quests also are very big.\r<br />Unlevelled version is available for those who use ERSO/Skyrim Scaling Stopper/etc.\r<br />\r<br />[b]FAQ:[/b]\r<br />Q:Your prices are not realistic&#33; I have a book/article/movie which gives higher prices for X and lower for Y.\r<br />A:Come on. Truth is that we simply don&#39;t know real medieval prices. What we have in different books are just some numbers taken from different sources which refer to different years and different regions. So that&#39;s no way to tell who is right. Anyway Skyrim is a fictional place with magic and monsters and it&#39;s economy simply cannot be exactly same as it was in medieval Europe. Remember it.\r<br />Q: Your prices are not balanced&#33;\r<br />A: But they are realistic. Well I really tried to keep them also as balanced as possible. But still - post your feedback and suggestions.\r<br />Q: Now I have too much/too less money&#33;\r<br />A:Change preferences in [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34612/]Trade and Barter by kryptopyr[/url]\r<br />Q: Why farthing and not penny?\r<br />A: To have proper prices for food, arrows and small clutter, and make it more convenient to make money through mining and woodchopping. Anyway a penny always could be split into 4 parts (4 farthings). So it is logical and convenient to have it as the smallest face value.\r<br />Q: Make X cheaper and Y more expensive.\r<br />A: Please make detailed explanation why it should be like you say and not like I already did. Include historical sources if you have some. If I like this I will do that. But I will not support different versions of this mod. I simply don&#39;t have time for it. If you don&#39;t like anything in my mod so much... Use Creation Kit or don&#39;t use my mod.\r<br />Q: How do I change word &#34;Gold&#34; in my inventory?\r<br />A: If you&#39;re using SkyUI go to Data/Interface/ and open file Translate_&lt;YOUR LANGUAGE&gt;.txt Than find &#34;&#036;Gold&#34; and change text right next to it to what you like. That&#39;s all.\r<br />Q: Make compatibility patch for X&#33;\r<br />A: You can ask me ONLY if it fits into next categories:\r<br />1)50+ endorsements (unless mod is really new)\r<br />2)lore-friendly or semi-lore-friendly.\r<br />LOTR, Game of thrones, real medieval Europe are ok but Warhammer 40k isn&#39;t.\r<br />3)No anime (real medieval Japan is ok).\r<br />Nothing sexy/skimpy.\r<br />No oversized weapons.\r<br />Nothing unrealistic and immersion-breaking.\r<br />4)if apparel: 3+ sets (not just different textures) or 10+ (different textures)\r<br />if weapons: 10+ items\r<br />These items must be included into levelled lists.\r<br />etc: not too small :)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Some notes:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod will always be simple, modular, and as realistic as possible.\r<br />It will always include last fixes from &#34;WAF - Remade with Dawnguard and Dragonborn support&#34;.\r<br />If someone makes such request I will make an optional patch for those who don&#39;t like my &#34;True Soldiers&#34; fixes (but still with WAF fixes). But it will break logic of this mod&#39;s prices progression.\r<br />\r<br />My price calculations were mostly based on next sources:\r<br />[url=http://www.hoboes.com/pub/Role-Playing/Fantasy/Real%20History/Medieval%20Prices/Price%20List/]Link[/url]\r<br />This is a very detailed article which gives years and sources for different prices. I tried to keep my prices as close to late 14th-15th century as possible.\r<br />[url=http://chertoznai.ru/?p=1576]Part 1[/url]\r<br />[url=http://chertoznai.ru/?p=1578]Part 2[/url]\r<br />(in Russian. Use Google Translate, should work fine enough)\r<br />This article gives even more information than previous but doesn&#39;t give sources or exact years. It only states that all prices from it refer to 13th-14th century England. That&#39;s why I usually used information from this article only when I couldn&#39;t find it in the first article.\r<br />\r<br />Please return and press &#34;Endorse&#34;. I love it.\r<br />&#92;m/",
