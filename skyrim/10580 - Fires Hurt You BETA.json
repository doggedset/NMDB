  "descriptionHtml": "This file has been removed by me.\r\nIt was like too much hard work placing so many actors in the world and was causing some graphical glitches and incompatibility with other mods.\r\nPlease wait for a new version of this mod call RevampedFires which I,m currently working on that will simply replace the vanilla meshes with new ones that have a fire damage actor attached to them.\r\n\r\nCheers and thanks for your support!\r\n\r\nGreg Manthey - gargorias",
