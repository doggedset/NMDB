  "descriptionHtml": "Are you tired of having to hack, slash, bludgeon, and disembowel your way through Skyrim? Wouldn\\'t it be so much better if you could avoid all that violence and bloodshed and have someone else risk their life for you? Well, say hello to Anastasia the Femme Fatale (pat. pending). She will have all the men in the frozen north wrapped around her finger, or at least she [i]would[/i] if [i]Skyrim[/i] featured any sort of halfway-decent persuasion mechanic.\r\n\r\nThis character starts at Level 1 and is located in Honeyside, Riften. In order to get her face looking exactly like the screenshots, you will need, at the minimum, the following mods:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/]ApachiiSkyHair by Apachii[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1329]Beauty Faces for females by necKros[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589]Natural Eyes by nevenbridge[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20483]Women of Skyrim-Enhanced female normalmaps by zzjay[/url] (Note: I replaced the Breton normal map with the default Nord one, located in Skyrim/Data/textures/actors/character/female)\r\n\r\nHer gown is the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25873]TM BallGown conversion by zzjay for UNP by zzjay[/url].
