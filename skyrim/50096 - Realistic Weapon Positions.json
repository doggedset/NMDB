  "descriptionHtml": "[b]* * * UPDATE:  Realistic Weapon Positions 1.11 is now live&#33; This update now includes a single file download, a handy NMM installer, several new weapon loadouts (including Frostfall compatibility), and even it&#39;s own .esp * * *[/b]\r<br />\r<br />What&#39;s Next?  ---  The next update will feature a single skeleton download with the ability to switch loadouts on the fly through the MCM.  What does this mean?  Change your weapon positions in game&#33;  You&#39;ll even be able to choose individual weapon positions - e.g. right dagger in boot, and left dagger on chest&#33;  I will also aim to add animations to the individual weapon positions, which will change on the fly as well&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Description: So I was tired of seeing weapons and shields floating in the air like magic, and even worse, clipping like it&#39;s going out of style.  This mod aims to fix a large majority of that. \r<br />\r<br />Please keep in mind that this is a skeleton replacer ONLY.  The animations for this will probably be messed up.  However, with Immersive Animations, and some clever tweaking, you can get it looking damn good.\r<br />\r<br />This works best with Immersive Animations Sword and Board and a tweaked sword and dagger.\r<br />\r<br />Features:\r<br />\r<br />-Shields that rest on the quiver, not float in the air\r<br />\r<br />-Daggers are now in several possible places\r<br />\r<br />-Bow is slung across the body over the left shoulder and sits behind the other weapons\r<br />\r<br />-The left hand sword is now in on the left back shoulder\r<br />\r<br />-The shield, quiver, daggers, bow, and other weapons now move with armor, reducing clipping \r<br />\r<br />-Vanilla shields, IA shields, and SkyforgeShields have been specially tweaked to sit in the right place (even the gigantic dwarven shield)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />\r<br />XP32 Maximum skeleton.  (make sure you install BEFORE this)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />**Install XP32 Maximum skeleton FIRST (doesn&#39;t matter which one, as this skeleton replaces it)**\r<br />Easy Way: Use NMM\r<br />Hard Way: Extract the files you want and install.  If you are doing the hard way, I presume you know what you&#39;re doing.\r<br />\r<br />Load Order:\r<br />\r<br />Make sure this mod shows up LAST in your order (yes, even after skyre, reproccer, and dual sheath redux).  That&#39;s the safest way.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />\r<br />This is just a skeleton replacer (and shield mesh replacer), so it should be compatible with everything, except other skeleton replacers, obviously.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods:\r<br />\r<br />-I HIGHLY recommend you use these mods along with this-\r<br />\r<br />Dual Sheath Redux,\r<br />Armed to the teeth (easy version or regular)\r<br />-OR-\r<br />Equipping Overhaul,\r<br />Immersive Animations,\r<br />Private Selective Quivers\r<br />Custom Races (so you don&#39;t see just EVERYONE walking around with daggers floating on their backs)\r<br />(just make sure you install this last)\r<br />\r<br />Known Bugs / Issues:\r<br />\r<br />This mod eliminates a lot of clipping, but certainly not ALL of it.  Both Ebony and Stahlrim quivers are huge and love to clip with everything.  There is still a considerable amount of clipping with certain bow / shield combinations, and both battleaxes and warhammers get very clippy with the quiver.\r<br />\r<br />Also, you shouldn&#39;t use crossbows.  Just don&#39;t.  They pierce the body and it&#39;s just awful.\r<br />However, I will release a version that fixes the crossbow soon.\r<br />\r<br />-If you want a different position of weapons (bows, swords, daggers, etc.) let me know and I will add it to the next update-\r<br />-If you have any shields, daggers, or whatever that doesn&#39;t work well with this, let me know, and I&#39;ll try to get it fixed-\r<br />",
