  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is created with users of [url=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2730]Headbomb\\'s Better Sorting[/url] in mind. I had noticed that the food items added by Hearthfire didn\\'t behave the way the rest of my food did and so created this add-on to fix it.\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\nAutomatic:\r\nJust load this up with NMM or other mod manager, select your option, and the installer does everything for you.\r\n\r\nManual:\r\nChoose [b][u]ONE[/u][/b] of the four .esp files and copy into your /Data folder. Enable in the launcher, and it\\'s ready to go.\r\n\r\n[b]Uninstall[/b]\r\nAutomatic: just uninstall in your mod manager.\r\nManual: delete the .esp in your Data folder.\r\n\r\n[b]Files[/b]\r\nThis mod includes four files, corresponding to the same food mod in Better Sorting, all affect the names of the food items:\r\nBetter Sorting - Hearthfire Food (Normal Weight).esp - Modifies names only, weights are unchanged.\r\nBetter Sorting - Hearthfire Food (Reduced Weight).esp - also caps weights of the food items to 0.5\r\nBetter Sorting - Hearthfire Food (Light Weight).esp - caps the weights at 0.1\r\nBetter Sorting - Hearthfire Food (Weightless).esp - all the food items are weightless\r\n\r\n[b]Compatibility[/b]\r\nThis mod will not be compatible with any other mod that affects food items added in Hearthfire. I do not forsee any problem with other mods, but if you run across one, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThis mod won\\'t crash if Headbomb\\'s Better Sorting is not installed, but if you\\'re not using it, it seems kind of silly to be using my add-on.\r\n\r\n[b]Thanks[/b]\r\nThanks to Headbomb for making the original Better Sorting mod.",
