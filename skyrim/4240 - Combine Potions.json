  "summary": "Get rid of all that excess weight and clutter by combining your little health, stamina, or magicka potions into bigger ones.  No loss of potency -- just pour them together at the nearest cooking pot.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A simple mod that allows you to combine your weaker health, magicka, or stamina potions into stronger ones via a Cooking Pot.  There\\'s no loss of potency.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nPotion of Minor Healing (25) + Potion of Minor Healing (25) = Potion of Healing (50)\r\nPotion of Stamina (50) + Potion of Vigorous Stamina (100) = Potion of Extreme Stamina (150)\r\n\r\nJust use the Cooking Pot with your potions in hand, and remember to select the MISC section for the potion recipes.\r\n\r\nFully compatible with mods that alter potion weight, name, etc. (as is demonstrated by the screenshot, in which I\\'m using Better Sorting).\r\n\r\n[u]-Installation-[/u]\r\nPlace Eld-combinePotions.esp into your Data folder, and enable it using your preferred mod manager.\r\n\r\n[u]-Credits-[/u]\r\nThanks to Dave Humphrey for SkyEdit.",
