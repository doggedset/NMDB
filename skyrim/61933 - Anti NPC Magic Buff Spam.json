  "descriptionHtml": "Anti NPC Buff Spam by ZHOOL\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />So I was running around with Illia and I noticed that sometimes when she had pathing issues to a target she&#39;d spam her frost cloak, which she can do about 3 or 4 times before she&#39;s out of mana. This mod puts a condition on the cloak and armor buff spells the NPCs use (all NPCs btw) to prevent them casting it if they already have the effect.\r<br />\r<br />Spells affected:\r<br />NPC version of Lightning, Fire and Frost Cloak\r<br />NPC version of Oak, Stone, Iron and Ebonyflesh (added in v1.1)\r<br />\r<br />1.2 changes: fix for ck recalculating mana costs for no reason. Big thanks to myztikrice for pointing that out.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: put the .esp in your skyrim&#92;data folder and activate with the data files option on the skyrim splash screen.",
