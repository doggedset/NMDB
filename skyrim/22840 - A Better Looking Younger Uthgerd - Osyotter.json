  "descriptionHtml": "By the Way: I am going to do requests, If there is any other characters you would like me to improve or edit let me know in the comments or message me, I\\'ll do my best.\r\n\r\nA long story short. Just a big improvement on Uthgerd\\'s ugly face. Hair color can be blonde or default. Hair is a slightly different style, (to make her look younger). Just look at the picture to see the difference! :D\r\n\r\nNote: These Files are Not Needed, but recommended.\r\nI recommend that you use a face mod for a younger look. I personally use Coverwomen:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563\r\n\r\nI also use and Highly recommend Younger Females - Realistic young female faces:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3227\r\n\r\nBetter Faces by Bella also is suitable:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\n\r\nReadMeFile:\r\nBetterUthgerd - by osyotter\r\nV 1.4\r\n\r\nNew:\r\nNow you can choose between 2 hair colors for Uthgerd. Use Uthgerd.esp \r\nfrom the Blondehair folder to make her blonde or for her normal hair color\r\nuse The esp from DefaultHairColor, pretty simple.\r\n \r\nInstallation:\r\nPlace the BetterUthgerd.esp of your choice into Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\.\r\nOver-right if asked.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThis file is incompatible with other Uthgerd facial edits and possibly stat edits\r\n\r\nThanks For your download, If there is any other character you would want me to\r\nImprove/make look younger jsut message me leave a comment on the mod.",
