You can edit in showracemenu.\r<br />\r<br />Download instructions:\r<br />Download the file and open the saved game. Depending on the saved game you choose you might need alternative start, otherwise your character will start out in whiterun.\r<br />Load the save, use shadowracemenu and then press F5 to save the face, after that press F9 to apply it.\r<br />Tip: Only use for ningheim for it to work properly.\r<br />Required:\r<br />Sevenbase body replacer. Ningheim race. Coverwomen. Â SG female eyebrows. SG female textures renewal. Apachii sky hair. (Leave a comment if the saved game doesn&#39;t work. :P)\r<br />\r<br />",
