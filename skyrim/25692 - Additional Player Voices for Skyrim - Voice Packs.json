  "descriptionHtml": "[color=yellow]This mod is officially discontinued.[/color]\r\n\r\nVoice packs for the Additional Player Voices Mod. They're a bit limited in scope and are really meant for battle. Generally you might think your character shouldn't be talking too much when they're all by their lonesome, right?\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n[color=red]\r\nYou MUST have [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21215]Additional Player Voices for Skyrim[/url] installed for this to function.[/color]\r\n[color=green]\r\nHearthfire + Dawnguard are NOT necessary for this mod to function and should be fully compatible.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=purple]If you are kind enough to make a video for me, I'll gladly place it here on the page so people can get a preview of the voices. I lack the proper video editing skills to do it myself. [/color]\r\nCurrent Packs:\r\nMales:\r\nVery Angry Fighter (Berserker/Fighter)\r\nVillain (Any archetype so long as they seem evil would make sense.)\r\nBrash Adventurer (Sounds almost like a leprechaun....)\r\n\r\n- You may only have one installed at a time. Swapping between two voices may require you to uninstall your current one first and then install the new one via the manager if for some reason you install a new one and the voice doesn't change.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore to come!\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\nNexus Mod Manager:\r\nJust download and activate! Using this method you can also easily swap between voice packs for characters (once they're available, duh.)\r\n\r\nManually:\r\n1.Extract the archive.\r\n2.Merge the data folder with your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mikhos/]Contact Me[/url]\r\nOr send me a message, leave a comment, whatever floats your boat.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther voice packs to check out:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24630] MORE Additional Player Voices for Skyrim by gawan[/url] His voice packs have sounds for most context situations. That means your character should have something to say about all the things you do.\r\n",
