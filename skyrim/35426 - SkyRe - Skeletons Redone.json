  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'ve been reworking the skeleton abilities in T3nd0\\'s Skyrim Redone mod, I love gathering bones to raise skeletons, but there we some issues;\r\n\r\nHaving lots of permanent skeletons was a nightmare, especially in tight areas\r\nLate game skeleton resources can be scarce\r\n\r\n\r\nHere\\'s how skeletons work now:\r\n\r\nSkeletons die Slowly, losing 2.5 health every second\r\n\r\nPerk Bone Mastery level 1 grants the skill Summon Skeleton, allowing the player to use the required materials and summon 1 Skeleton Warrior\r\nPerk Bone Mastery level 2 allows more bones to be harvested from skeletons\r\nPerk Bone Mastery level 3 allows Summon Skeleton to summon 1 Skeleton Warrior and 1 Skeleton Archer\r\nPerk Bone Mastery level 4 allows even more bones to be harvested from skeletons\r\nPerk Bone Mastery level 5 allows Summon Skeleton to summon 1 Skeleton Warrior, 1 Skeleton Archer, and 1 Skeleton Mage\r\nPerk Bone Mastery level 6 gives skeletons more health (This allows skeletons to take more damage and live longer)\r\n\r\nSkeletons no longer attack everyone when summoned\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nThe reason I did this was because, while skeletons hoards were epic and amazing, having them all the time was a serious pain in the ass, especially indoors when your available movement space is very limited, and just putting them on a timer made the skill too weak since they require a lot of materials, so instead, increasing the amount of skeletons raised with every other level while keeping the same materials allows for more expendable skeletons, and as every necromancer knows, skeletons should be very expendable!\r\n\r\nSummon as many skeletons as you want, enjoy your amazing skeleton hoards without being burdoned every time you go indoors\r\n\r\nRemember: This (obviously) requires Skyrim Redone, make sure it\\'s loaded after skyre_main.esp http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286",
