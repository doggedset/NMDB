Changes made by USKP have now been carried over into this mod, and the mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit.  The changes to Babette have now been included in the mod.  In addition, I created a Hearthfire version.  The Hearthfire version changes the newly added children&#39;s furniture to work with this mod.  It also makes a few tweaks to the children inventories and adds the chance of Hearthfire items appearing in their inventories.",
