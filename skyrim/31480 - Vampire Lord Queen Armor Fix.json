  "summary": "A really small mod which changes the Vampire Lord Queen Armor to which it should have been.",
  "descriptionHtml": " This is a really small edit, which is very easy to do when you know how to do, but nobody did this so I learned how to edit .nif files and made it. It simply makes the vampirelordfemalequeenarmor.nif better, by adding a joint to the cape and making the silver ornament on the head solid.\r\n\r\n But nobody uses this armor in the vanilla game, so if you don\\'t use any other mods which allow you to wear royal armor in your vampire lord form, this mod is useless :P I use mod by xyks(Royal Bloodline - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22565).\r\n\r\n This mod will have Compatibility problems with other mods which change Vampirelordfemalequeenarmor.nif, like Grimoas Vampire Lord. I really love that mod too, but, well, I just like the cape so much.\r\n\r\n Thank you for reading, and thank you for using my mod.\r\n\r\n Thanks for Bethesda for great game and Nifskope/3ds Max developers for these tools. And of course xyks for making great mod(Royal Bloodline).",
