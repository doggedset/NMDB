TOTALLY RECOMMENDED FOR USE WITH THIS MOD.[/size]\r<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />This mod replaces and adds more unique and diverse textures, than the usual 3 used by the vanilla game, to spider webs, cobwebs and egg sacs placements throughout the entire game world.\r<br />\r<br />After releasing a retexture mod earlier in the year ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33718/? ), I was never completely satisfied with the outcome of it due to the limited number of textures used to create the over all effect in the vanilla game. A grand total of 3 textures were used to cover all types of webs available.\r<br />\r<br />I decided to edit each spider web and cobweb mesh, using Nifskope, so each would have a different and separate texture associated with it, giving the game a more varied effect, as far as webs are concerned. I tried to make each new texture fit the mesh more convincingly to give a more immersive and spookier atmospheric feeling to lairs and abandoned areas.\r<br />\r<br />There are[/center] a few new textures covering all aspects of spider webs, cobwebs and egg sacs. Simply copy the textures and meshes folders into your data folder and overwrite if asked (always remember to backup your folders in case you wish to uninstall).\r<br />\r<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />[center]\r<br />[size=4]COMPATIBILITY[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This mod isn&#39;t compatible with other web retexture mods including my WEBS mod ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33718/? ).\r<br />\r<br />It is fully compatible with texture overhaul mods which don&#39;t retexture webs or change their meshes. I haven&#39;t seen any that do so, on the Nexus. If there are just overwrite with this mod.\r<br />\r<br />If you are using or intend to use Enhanced lights and fx install this mod after it, allowing it to be able to replace the spider web and cobweb meshes from that mod. Failure to do this will cause the new textures added, not to be present in the game. \r<br />\r<br />ENB users, if you use the ENB particle patch overwrite with this mod for the same reasons given for ELFX , otherwise it is compatible and recommended (effects may differ with different ENB configurations).\r<br />\r<br />If there are any other mods that change these particular meshes used in this mod, just overwrite with these.\r<br />\r<br />THERE IS NO NEED FOR COMPATIBILITY PATCHES AS THE MESHES HAVE BEEN EDITED TO SOLVE LIGHTING PROBLEMS.\r<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />[center][size=4]VERSION HISTORY[/size][/center]\r<br />0.1: Initial release\r<br />\r<br />0.2: Edited some alphas to make them more visible or less so depending on the texture. Changed a couple of textures because I thought they looked a bit out of place. Enhanced all textues to look better. Added a new gradient which I feel gives a more realistic effect to how webs react to light and movement past them.\r<br />If you don&#39;t like the new gradient just delete it and the vanilla one will be back again (Textures...effects...gradients...gradspiderweb.dds)\r<br />\r<br />1.0: Completely overhauled all textures. Tweaked meshes to be compatible with ELFX and ENB users.\r<br />\r<br />1.1: Fixed meshes that were wrongly uploaded with version 1.0 (my apologies to anyone who downloaded version 1.0).\r<br />\r<br />1.2: Updated spider egg sacs textures and normal maps to less resemble rocks and look more organic.\r<br />\r<br />1.3: Updated hanging cobwebs textures to look more like old webs and changed the particle effect to appear less like dust. Added an esp to the mod to enable new cutting through web door effect (just enable it and can be put anywhere in your load order). You can also use this mod without the esp activated, it won&#39;t harm your game or saves in the least (no scripts used). It will only make the hacking effect be over after one strike, not several.\r<br />\r<br />1.3a: Eliminated ESP from mod due to the fact of not being able to figure out a solution to the Bleak Falls error that some people are experiencing. \r<br />ESP version has been put as an optional file and will not be supported unless an explanation or solution is given (It&#39;s baffled me and I don&#39;t want to spend more time than I have already with ending up being no wiser). \r<br />Be aware if the ESP is used that the error may or may not occur in your game, the majority of people don&#39;t appear to have a problem.\r<br />\r<br />1.3b: Fixed the error which some people were having at Bleaks Falls Barrow with the ESP activated. I finally came across it and it appears the webs in the doorway were resetting but not to the first texture cell but the last before the web breaks. So when you tried to cut the web a second time the animation did not work because the game engine did not recognise it because it was the last cell of the animation and not the first. So in part this was a fault with the game not resetting the doorway properly. To fix this I told the game to not reset the webs after they have been cut. So from now on every time you return to Bleak Falls Barrow the webs will remain cut.\r<br />\r<br />2.0: Completely overhauled the entire mod with new textures and introduced a new web shimmer effect to try and make them react more natural to the light. It is the best I could do with the limitations of the gradient but it&#39;s a vast improvement over previous versions. The textures have been updated to be more authentic than version 1.3b with thicker threads I have also modified the vanilla spider web texture and merged it into the spider webs textures to give more flow. I choose the vanilla texture because it&#39;s a decent texture and blends well. I have eliminated the ESP because it is more trouble than it is worth and I can not solve the Bleakfalls bug, so it will no longer be supported and it will not work with version 2.0. I consider this mod now completed because I feel that I have achieve what I set out to accomplish with the over all effect. \r<br />\r<br />3.0: Completely enhanced all textures which makes them look more 3D (many thanks and credit to, my friend, Gamwich, for showing me new techniques). Revised the normal maps used in this mod which also gives a more 3D effect to the egg sacs and suspended husks. Played more with the gradient texture to give a more shimmery effect (best viewed in 3rd person view). I now consider this version to be the final one, unless bugs are reported.\r<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />[center][color=#ff0000]THIS IS ONLY FOR OLDER VERSIONS OF ELFX NOT NEEDED WITH NEW VERSION.[/color][/center]\r<br />Added in optional. is a ELFXEnhancer replacer. It eliminates the black and invisible webs issue whilst keeping the lighting effects of ELFXEnhancer (well as close as possible) . Replace the ELFXEnhancer.esp with this one. This is intended to be used with ELFX.\r<br />\r<br />Full and all credits go to anamorfus for his brilliant mod. This is only a edited version of his ELFXEnhancer.esp to be used as a patch only to make cobwebs and spider webs visible and not have a black colouring under certain lights. This is not a new mod.\r<br />ELFX found here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27043/?\r<br />If you use his version or this patch and like it ENDORSE his mod.\r<br />\r<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thanks for looking, endorsing and leaving posts and pictures.\r<br />\r<br />MY MODS:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58695/?]ELECTRIFY[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58452/?]RIPPLES[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58427/?]STEAM[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56127/?]CLOUDS[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54185/?]ATMOSPHERE[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54085/?]RAIN[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53971/?]AURORA[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53917/?]STARS[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52986/?]SNOW[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52733/?]LEAVES[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51462/?]DANDELION SEEDS[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51011/?]DUST[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48538/?]WEBS extended[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33718/?]WEBS[/url]",

I finally came across it and it appears the webs in the doorway were resetting but not to the first texture cell but the last before the web breaks. So when you tried to cut the web a second time the animation did not work because the game engine did not recognise it because it was the last cell of the animation and not the first. So in part this was a fault with the game not resetting the doorway properly. To fix this I told the game to not reset the webs after they have been cut.
