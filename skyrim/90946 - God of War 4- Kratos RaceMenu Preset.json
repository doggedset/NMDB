  "descriptionHtml": "You know the deal, don't have a ps4 so I made my own Kratos... :D\n<br />\n<br />And to add some lore:\n<br />[i]\n<br />[/i][center][size=3][i]\"After many years of battles, Kratos came upon the Norse realms. There, embedded on a ruin, he found a portal to another world. And as he wonders how he can ever go back, the land of Skyrim awaits ahead of him, taunting him into the unknown.\"[/i]\n<br />[/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]REQUIREMENTS:Â \n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />-RaceMenu, of course:\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />And if you want Kratos to look like the images above:\n<br />\n<br />-Bald Head:\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3518\n<br />\n<br />-Warpaint:\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1433\n<br />\n<br />[i](Small warning, the bald head mod replaces the 'shaven' look in-game, so any characters using that will look completely bald.)\n<br />\n<br />[/i]\n<br />[b][size=4]Recomended:\n<br />[/size][/b][i](Another small warning: apparently the warpaint mod causes a bit of visual glitch in the back of the head, to fix it, and have a much better looking Kratos, I recommend:)\n<br />[/i]\n<br />-XCE- Scarface\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24600\n<br />\n<br />[i](They install as complexions in the game, and there is one that looks almost perfect with Kratos.)\n<br />\n<br />[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center]I'm working on making the Leviathan Axe from the game, hopefully that'll come out soon.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This is actually the first mod I upload, so please be kind :)\n<br />\n<br />If there is any questions I'll try to answer them as best as I can.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][i]This mod is exclusive to the Nexus\n<br />\n<br />It is and always will be FREE![/i][/b][/center]",
