The followers were created using my custom race mod, [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29766]Lovergirl Race[/url].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Followers:[/b][/color]\r<br />Violet the Violent - A two-handed katana-wielding beauty.\r<br />Scarlet the Wildfire - A fiery spellsword using fire magic in one hand and a dagger in the other.\r<br />Nina the Frozen Heart - An icy spellsword using ice magic in one hand and a sword in the other.\r<br />Charlotte the Duelist - A duel-wielding beauty.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Requirements:[/b][/color] This mod requires that you have [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29766]Lovergirl Race[/url] installed, which requires Skyrim v1.8.151+.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Installation:[/b][/color] Download the relevant Follower Pack and extract its contents to your Data folder. Activate RaceCompatibility.esm, Lovergirl Race.esp, and Lovergirls Follower Pack.esp in your mod manager. Lovergirls Follower Pack.esp must be placed below Lovergirl Race.esp in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Customization:[/b][/color]\r<br />Changing the followers&#39; outfits to vanilla in-game ones can be done using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12933]Extensible Followers Framework[/url] or [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url]. I personally use the former. Please note that changing outfits this way will result in your followers losing their default outfits permanently in your current save. Weapons can be changed by merely trading the followers. If the weapon you&#39;re trading has better damage, then the follower will likely use it instead.\r<br />\r<br />You can customize the followers with different face and body meshes/textures by overwriting the files in meshesBSnakeLovergirlsCBBE or UNP and texturesBSnakeLovergirlsCBBE or UNP. Make sure to overwrite existing files using the same file name, else your new assets won&#39;t be recognized by the mod. You must edit your new meshes in NifSkope to point to the textures in texturesBSnakeLovergirlsCBBE or UNP, else the followers will likely use your default female textures. Charlotte, Nina, and Scarlet use CBBE, while Violet uses UNP.\r<br />\r<br />Do not change the femalehead.nif in meshesBSnakeLovergirlsCBBE or UNP or the tri files in meshesBSnakeLovergirlsfaceparts, else the followers may not look as intended. The followers use your skeleton_female.nif in meshesactorscharactercharacter assets female in hopes of providing BBP support.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Editing Followers in the CK:[/b][/color]\r<br />If you wish to edit the follower&#39;s face, add headparts like scars, adjust their stats, give them specific equipment, etc., then you&#39;ll need to install Wryebash.\r<br />\r<br />After installing Wryebash, move Lovergirl Race.esp to the very top of the esp files list (or the very bottom of the esm files list - same thing). Right-click Lovergirl Race.esp and click &#34;Esmify Self&#34;. Then exit Wryebash completely and open Lovergirls Follower Pack.esp in the CK. Make your changes and then start up Wryebash again. Right-click Lovergirl Race.esp and click &#34;Espify Self&#34;. Be sure to do this before starting up the game. If you save in-game and forget to &#34;espify&#34; Lovergirl Race.esp, your save file will become corrupt.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Compatibility:[/b][/color] This mod relies upon Lovergirl Race, so it is incompatible with Enhanced Character Edit. You must deactivate EnhancedCharacterEdit.esp in your mod manager or delete it altogether. Mods that make large changes to, or replace, the Drunken Huntsman might be incompatible.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Uninstallation:[/b][/color] Dismiss the relevant followers, exit the Drunken Huntsman if you&#39;re currently inside it, and then save your game. Delete the Lovergirls Follower Pack.esp file and the Lovergirls folder in DatameshesBSnake and DatatexturesBSnake. Delete the folders called &#34;Lovergirls Follower Pack.esp&#34; in DatameshesactorscharacterFaceGenDataFaceGeom and DatatexturesactorscharacterFaceGenDataFaceTint.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]F.A.Q.:[/b][/color]\r<br />Q: I don&#39;t see any followers in the Drunken Huntsman.\r<br />A: If you used &#34;coc whiterundrunkenhuntsman&#34;, simply exit the tavern and enter it normally. Make sure Lovergirl Follower Pack.esp is placed below Lovergirl Race.esp in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I use UFO and I can&#39;t get X NPC to follow me.\r<br />A: Move the UFO.esp files below Lovergirls Follower Pack.esp in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I can&#39;t seem to recruit X from a different follower mod with this mod activated.\r<br />A: Try moving Lovergirls Follower Pack.esp above/below your other followers&#39; esp files in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Nina, Scarlet, and/or other NPCs have a constant swirly, blue effect surrounding them.\r<br />A: If you have [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/60]Enhanced Blood Textures[/url] or the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22745]Footprints[/url] mod installed, update them to their latest versions.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Thanks and Credits:[/b][/color]\r<br />Thank you so much to the following authors for granting me express or free-to-use permissions to use their assets:\r<br />\r<br />RAN46, tktk\r<br />A&K Team\r<br />Apachii\r<br />cazy, zzjay\r<br />PeggyZone, LaughingVampire, zzjay\r<br />caliente\r<br />dimon99\r<br />LogRaam\r<br />Gizmodian, Xenius\r<br />FavoredSoul\r<br />jmenaru\r<br />calyps\r<br />Zonzai, Telthalion\r<br />Toad\r<br />\r<br />Thank you to En Masse Entertainment for explaining to me their terms of use concerning modding.
