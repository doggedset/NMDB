  "descriptionHtml": "After using many Mods and the CK i had a strange Bug inside the Game. \r\n\r\nEvery Time i changed the Weapon, get something from an NPC or at \r\nOnscreen Events there was a thunder sound with echo. Ok, that was very boring.\r\n\r\nSo i\\'ve tried a little bit around with the CK and changed the Volumes of the \r\nSound Descriptors (SD) a little bit to \\\"reset\\\" it (the fix should be loaded at last in \r\nloadorder). \r\n\r\nHow to fix the Problem:\r\n1. Install the SDfix.esp to the Data folder\r\n2. Start the Game.\r\n3. Load a (might be older) Savegame.\r\n4. THE GAME MAY CRASH!!! (use CTRL+ALT+DEL to kill the Task)\r\n5. Go to Data folder.\r\n6. Remove the SDfix.esp\r\n7. Start the Game and play (now with -should be- fixed event sounds).\r\n\r\nThis was working for me very well to fix the Problem, however - what a strange bug.\r\n\r\nhave fun, triplex2011",
