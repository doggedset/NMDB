  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes available much less ingot materials from blacksmiths etc.\r\nThe idea is to make weapon/armor crafting harder: too easy buying the ingot materials you need everywhere and improve your equipment too fast. Makes crafting slower and harder and gives a sense to the almost useless mining option in the game (who needs pickaxes and mining if you can find or buy the material everywhere in abundance?).\r\nLet me know if this breaks something in the game (should not, edited only one leveled list chance).",
