  "descriptionHtml": "I scoured Nexus, searching for a mod that made it easier to obtain glass. Goat horns can be collected from goats(duh!) and there are mods to gather straw from the static hay bales scattered around Skyrim, but there doesn\\\\\\'t seem to be anything for glass!\r\n\r\nI\\\\\\'ve decided to change that.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a couple retextured items and a new mining vein called a Sand Drift. Mining a Sand Drift earns you bags of sand, which can be melted down at the smelter for glass.\r\n\r\nYou mine four bags of sand at a time, and each bag currently gives you three(3) glass.\r\n\r\nI\\\\\\'m in the process of placing sand drifts around Skyrim; currently Lake Ilinalta has the strongest concentration. The Textures are lighter in color, and easy to see. More drifts have been placed along the river all the way to the Whiterun area. There is also at least one drift very close to each of the Hearthfire houses, for easy access.\r\n\r\nThe drifts should be \\\\\\'endless;\\\\\\' you can gather continuously as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS MOD REQUIRES HEARTHFIRE. That should be obvious, considering its purpose...\r\n\r\n",
