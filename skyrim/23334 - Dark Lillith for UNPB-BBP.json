  "descriptionHtml": "Update 8/31: added non-BBP patch for those who don\\'t want to jiggle when they wiggle.\r\n\r\nHentai\\'s Dark Lillith Armor for UNPB-BBP\r\nadaptation by selobl\r\nSkyrim v1.6 or greater\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThis armor is based on the Oblivion mod \\\"Dark Lillith\\\" by Hentai http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/21579. All artistic value is attributed to Hentai, I have simply modified the original to work in SKyrim with my body mod of choice. \r\n\r\nI adapted the meshes for the UNPB-BBP body with working weight slider\r\nI created new gloves by slicing and dicing UNPB meshes (what, you were expecting me to adapt HGEC hands?)\r\nI derived _m textures from the originals\r\nI created inventory meshes\r\nI made the esp\r\n\r\nI assigned the pieces to Biped Object slots according to the standard here: http://www.creationkit.com/Biped_Object\r\n\r\nThe pieces are craftable at any forge. A light armor version is under leather, and is upgradable at any workbench. \r\n\r\nYes, I called it armor. I gave it armor rating, so in the context of the game it\\'s considered armor. If the look is unappealing, try playing the game with your eyes closed.\r\n\r\nRequired mods:\r\n\r\nUNPB-BBP by Calyps\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14899\r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t properly install the BBP package this mod will not work and your game will probably CTD, or you might just get spooky-boobs. If you can\\'t figure out BBP, you should spend your time learning research and trouble shooting skills instead of wasting time playing with boobie mods.\r\n\r\nA UNP-compatible texture, I use the latest by Dimon99\r\n\r\nUNP by Dimon99\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709\r\n\r\nBBP animations if you want to see the jiggly-bits:\r\n\r\nVictorias High Heel walk Animation plus BBP by xp32\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13272\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nI recommend\r\nWrye Bash\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1840 \r\nIf you\\'re using it, I doubt I need to explain it.\r\n\r\nor you could unzip the archive into your Data folder.\r\n\r\nNMM - might work, I don\\'t use NMM. Ask your colleagues on the forums how to install via NMM.\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES:\r\ncould be some clipping in some poses or animations\r\nI\\'m busy in RL and might not support this mod to a professional standard\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture plans:\r\nsquash any bugs I missed\r\nnon-BBP meshes for very special people, when time allows\r\nI may tweak the esp to include heavy and cloth. maybe.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I won\\'t make a CBBE version - Nikitaa already has an amazing version:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13067\r\nAlso, despite good intentions, I\\'m not likely to complete a stock UNP, because it will take limited modding time away from doing another UNPB-BBP mod\r\n\r\n\r\nRe-Use:\r\nI\\'ll quote Hentai on this:\r\n\r\n1. Feel free to use everything in this file.\r\n\r\n2. Everything I made for Oblivion is free to convert to Skyrim. Since Im not going to convert them myself.\r\n\r\n3. Do not upload this file on Steam Workshop until furthur notice. ( I like Nexus so much more as a modder)\r\n\r\nbe considerate and give Hentai, Calyps and me credit\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS and THANKS\r\n\r\nthanks to Hentai/Zotman12 and Calyps\r\n\r\nDark Lillith by Hentai/Zotman12\r\nhttp://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/21579\r\n\r\nUNPB-BBP by Calyps\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14899\r\n\r\nCaliente\\'s tutorial and Nif Cleaner\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r\n\r\nLots of fine folks at tesadventures.com for technical info, inspiration and encouragement\r\n\r\nLeckerHamster on Youtube for insight into inventory meshes\r\n\r\nApachii, Halofarm, Psychos1s and Brokefoot for the hair, poses and race used in screenshots\r\n\r\nDarkOne and Skyrim Nexus for a place to discover and share mods\r\n\r\nTools used:\r\nBlender\r\nNikskope\r\nGIMP\r\nNifCleaner by Caliente\r\nCreation Kit\r\n7 Zip\r\nNotepad\r\n",
