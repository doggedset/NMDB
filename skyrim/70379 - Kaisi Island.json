  "descriptionHtml": "Introducing the enchanting world of Kaisi Island. It is recommended you have an HD texture pack installed before playing. \r<br />This is my first Skyrim mod, so I hope you all enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it. \r<br />I am an aspiring game designer, so I decided to make this for my portfolio, and to give back to the mod community. \r<br />Please let me know any feedback you guys may have. Post any screenshots or gameplay video you guys have of this mod, would love to see it.  My email is brucecopelanddev [at] gmail dot com if you have any questions for me directly.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy &#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Features[/b][/size]\r<br />- A lush enchanting forest with lots of wildlife and flora. Perfect for lots of hunting.\r<br />- Elvish city built in the trees.\r<br />- Ancient Dwarven walkway with a gigantic troll boss.\r<br />- A zoo with creatures, friendly and not friends from across skyrim.\r<br />- A player home with 2 horses.\r<br />- 2 bandit camps\r<br />- A misty lake with small island in the middle\r<br />- Some hidden treasure chests scattered around the island.\r<br />- Other little cool places to visit and see\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img.ctrlv.in/img/15/10/07/56159cc1604c7.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Required DLC[/size][/b]\r<br />Kaisi Island requires NO DLC, only the latest up-to-date version of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Location[/size][/b]\r<br />To travel to Kaisi Island, go to the boat at the Dawnstar docks. There is a trap door on the dock to enter the Island. See screenshot on this page to see the exact location.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Known technical issues[/size][/b]\r<br />- I tried for many hours, but I cannot seem to get the LOD settings to work properly, so expect some LOD glitches. So sorry about that.\r<br />- For some reason, the large mushrooms sometimes seem to fall over and roll around on the ground.\r<br />- There may be some minor nav mesh issues.\r<br />- On some rare occasions, creatures in the zoo can escape from their cage.\r<br />- Occasional crashes on low performance machines. If you have a low performance PC, download the low performance version of the mod.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Mods used in screenshots[/b][/size]\r<br />ENB - RealVision\r<br />Enhanced Landscapes\r<br />Enhanced Landscapes - Green Fields\r<br />Enhanced Landscapes - Marsh Pines\r<br />Enhanced Landscapes - Oaks\r<br />Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul\r<br />Revamped Exterior Fog\r<br />Tamriel Reloaded Flora\r<br />Tamriel Reloaded Trees\r<br />Unbelievable Grass Two\r<br />And various high texture mods as well.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Install[/size][/b]\r<br />Just extract everything into Skyrim&#39;s data folder, but I&#39;m sure you all know that by now :)",
