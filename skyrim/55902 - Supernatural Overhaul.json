Their stats are as Followed ranging from level 10 to level 60. \r<br />\r<br />Werewolf - Level 10 / Vanilla Damage +10% faster the normal \r<br />Werewolf Savage - Level 15 / +20 Claw Damage +15% faster then normal \r<br />Werewolf Savage (BOSS) Level 20 / +20 Claw Damage +20% faster then normal \r<br />Werewolf Brute - Level 25 / +40 Claw Damage +25% faster then normal \r<br />Werewolf Brute (BOSS) Level 30 / +40 Claw Damage +30% faster then normal \r<br />Werewolf Skinwalker - Level 35 / +60 Claw Damage +35% faster then normal \r<br />Werewolf Skinwalker (BOSS) Level 40 / +60 Claw Damage +40% faster then normal \r<br />Werewolf Beastmaster - Level 45 /+80 Claw Damage +45% faster then normal \r<br />Werewolf Beastmaster (BOSS) Level 50 / +80 Claw Damage +50% faster then normal \r<br />Werewolf Vargr - Level 55 / +100 Claw Damage +55% faster then Normal \r<br />Werewolf Vargr (BOSS) Level 60 / +100 Claw Damage +60% faster then normal \r<br />Werebear - Level 50 / +150 Claw Damage +50% faster then normal \r<br />\r<br />As a Bonus all Lycanthropes have a 500 Armor Rating and have gained the Full Moon Rising Ability \r<br />(In other words they will get Bonus Health and stamina when the Moons are out) \r<br />------------------------------------------------------------- \r<br />About Dragon priests - \r<br />Dragon priests were harder to change then the Vampires and Werewolves however I did manage to accomplish my goal in changing them...Their Stats are as Followed ranging from level 65 to level 75.\r<br />\r<br />Random Dragon Priests - Level 65 / +10% faster then normal + Chain Reaction \r<br />Masked Dragon Priests - Level 70 / +15% faster then normal + Chain Reaction \r<br />Acolyte Dragon Priests - Level 75 / +20% faster then normal + Chain Reaction \r<br />\r<br />So what is Chain Reaction? \r<br />A Chain Reaction is a Feature where one Dragon Priest will summon a 2nd Dragon priest who will summon yet a 3rd Dragon Priest and this will continue until either one of you is Dead, A Chain reaction will usually begin shortly after a Fight starts with a Dragon priest this feature can prove very deadly and troublesome to low level character&#39;s but is not always guaranteed to occur if that happens you should consider yourself lucky in the fight but how did I create this feature? well it was very simple. \r<br />\r<br />As an added Bonus all Dragon Priest&#39;s have been given their own Healing Spell, the Atronach Perk so they will absorb some magic that is cast at them and a 300 Armor Rating so now they can survive a bit longer when in close quarters with a melee fighter. \r<br />------------------------------------------------------------- \r<br />About Witch&#39;s \r<br />Witches... They were so weak in the Vanilla game and were no different from mages, I have changed that to make them more threatening to the lower level player&#39;s and perhaps more enjoyment to Higher level players...Their stats are as Followed ranging from level 20 to level 50. \r<br />\r<br />Witches - Level 20 + Added Spells, was level 4 + Atronach Perk & Dremora summon \r<br />Hags - Level 35 + Added Spells, was level 8 + Atronach Perk & Dremora Summon \r<br />Hagravens = Level 50 + Added Spells, was level 20 + Atronach Perk & Dremora Summon \r<br />------------------------------------------------------------- \r<br />Compatibility - \r<br />Any mod that does not Change the Same Things \r<br />\r<br />Questions -\r<br />Define Faster?\r<br />Faster means they will attack faster and Move Faster\r<br />",
