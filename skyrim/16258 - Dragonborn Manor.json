  "descriptionHtml": "Version 1.1 Changelog:\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nForget about Version 1.1 lmao, 1.2 shows how much I\\'ve progressed with the CK since I first made this one.  Wait for V1.2 to be done, it\\'ll be worth it.  I\\'m almost done with it. Edited on 4/15/2012.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt includes:\r\n\r\n-Bedroom\r\n-Armory (with over 30 mannequins and weapon racks)\r\n-All Doomstones (in armory)\r\n-All Shrines (main room)\r\n-All crafting stations (Alchemy table, Enchanting table, Armor workbench, Grinding wheel, Forge, Tanning rack, Wood chopping block, Cooking pot, Smelter)\r\n-TONS of storage all with their own unique names\r\n-Fully navmeshed by hand\r\n\r\n\r\n*Located across the river from Riverwood.  See map in screenshots for exact location.*\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nJust place the MyPlace.esp into your Data folder and make sure it is checked in your Data Files list.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n-To get to the armory use the right teleport stone, the left one and the night mother coffin are purely cosmetic.\r\n\r\n-Hope you like it and feel free to give suggestions/comments as I appreciate constructive criticism for future reference.  I do not plan on updating this, but will if persuaded to do so.  Enjoy.\r\n********Due to interest in this house I will update it on request. :)***********\r\n\r\n*The name of the house in the creation kit is MyPlace (not case sensitive if coc\\'ing there) if you want to play around with it for personal use.*\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\nIt will only conflict with any other house/mod that places something in the exterior cell where the Bethesda tutorial had you put an exterior entrance.  I placed it there because its a convenient location and I like the atmosphere around Riverwood.\r\n\r\nThanks to Eldiabs for his Modder\\'s Resource Mod.  It made adding the mannequins MUCH easier.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11618\r\n",
