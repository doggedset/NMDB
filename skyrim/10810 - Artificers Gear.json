Total of 116% bonus to potions and improvement of weapons and armor. Currently can only be added via Console. The gear cannot be disenchanted or crafted. \r\n\r\nIn the future...\r\nI\\'m working on a quest line that gives the items as rewards. \r\n\r\nWhy?!?!?\r\nMy main characters main quest story line got bugged because of conflicts with the civil war quest line and after many attempts to finish quests, reset quests, and just flat out skip quests, that game is useless and I had to restart. Making this mod was easier than making the gear. I also figured it might be useful to share.",
