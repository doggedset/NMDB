  "descriptionHtml": "This fix is for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12015]Better Shrouded Armor by Half-Dead[/url] \r\n\r\nThe main mod, is missing the meshes for 1st person view. It shows up as default DB armor textures. (refer to images)\r\n\r\n[b][color=green]To install, just open the zip file, drop \\\"meshes\\\" folder into your skyrim / \\\"Data\\\" folder. \r\n\r\nOr use Nexus Mod Manager.[/color][/b]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Credits goes to H4lfD3ad for his amazing dark brotherhood armor. Of course, you need to install his mod first in order for this to work. [/color]\r\n\r\n[color=grey][i]dave_rayner87 also made an esp fix [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16025]here[/url].\r\nBut for those that were having \\\"invisible arms\\\" problem, or couldn\\'t get it to work, try mines.
