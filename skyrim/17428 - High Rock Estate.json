  "descriptionHtml": "I started this in the hopes of making this into a true mansion on a grande scale.  I\\'ve put a lot of time into it and I\\'ve only just barely finished the first floor, and was planning at least 4 floors.  Navmesh has been done also.  With work and family I just don\\'t have time to finish, but figured I\\'d post this as a modders resource so someone else can take it in as their own.  So feel free to download and do whatever you want with it.  I don\\'t even really care if I get any credit.  See pics to get a feel for what I have done.  Enjoy\r\n\r\nTo access you will have to type \\\"coc highrockestatemain\\\" into the console ~ in game.\r\nIn CK there are three cells all starting with highrockestate.\r\n\r\nIf you do use any portion from this in your mods please upload a pic of your version and a link to your mod.
