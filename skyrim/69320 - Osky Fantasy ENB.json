  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=5]\r<br />[center]Welcome to Skyrim, warrior&#33;[/center][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Description, why did I create this ENB?\r<br />[/b][/size]\r<br />This is a modified custom ENB preset, made for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The reason I made this preset is I wanted to find an ENB preset, which really fits to me. I checked out the Nexus, YouTube, searched for custom ENB presets on Google, but I couldn&#39;t find any ENB presets that I think are perfect. I found a few really good ones - for example True Vision ENB - but I still had to consider whether I wanna install them or not, because I wasn&#39;t 100% sure that those ENB presets are the ones I&#39;d like to see in-game, so I decided to create my own ENB preset. \r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]What kind of ENB preset is this, what are the visuals based on?[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This is a custom ENB preset, and its visuals, its look is based on &#34;my fantasy&#34;. I mean, I wanted to create a less realistic ENB preset, which is still not too unrealistic. I didn&#39;t want to create a movie like ENB preset, nor an unrealistic one, which would be so colorful with ultimate-atom-mega-giga Depth of Field, with a tons of Lens Flare, no... My idea was to create an ENB preset, which if you take a look at, first, you&#39;ll break down in tears of how beautiful an ENB preset could be, second, you&#39;ll break down in tears again, because you look through your window and realize, that this ENB preset has actually got better graphics, than the real world, and third, you&#39;ll realize that it is WORTH downloading this preset ;)\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]What about the optimization?[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Honestly, I think I did my best to optimize this ENB preset, in order to make it run well on most modern PCs.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Why is the 30 FPS lock?\r<br />[/size][/b]\r<br />Well, first of all, the 30 FPS lock is NOT needed. I locked the FPS to 30, because I&#39;ve been using a modded Skyim with at least 100 mods, and I noticed interior stuttering if my FPS was over 30, so I locked it, and it solved the problem, funny isn&#39;t it? :D\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]What can I do to disable the 30 FPS lock, and let the game run by more than 30 FPS?[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />First of all, you need to open enblocal.ini, then look for a line: &#34;EnableFPSLimit = True&#34; and change it to &#34;EnableFPSLimit = False&#34;. That&#39;s it.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b][center]INSTALLATION[/center]\r<br />[/b][/size]\r<br />[b][size=3]Preparing ENB (you have to do it if you haven&#39;t done it yet)\r<br />[/size][/b]\r<br />Go into &#34;My Documents/My Games/Skyrim&#34;, look for a file called &#34;SkyrimPrefs.ini&#34;, open it, and make sure these lines are set: \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]bFloatPointRenderTarget=1\r<br />bDrawLandShadows=1\r<br />bTreesReceiveShadows=1[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Go to [url=http://enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0279.htm]enbdev[/url] and download the latest ENB series for Skyrim. Extract the files, and copy D3D9.dll and EnbHost.exe to your Skyrim main folder*.\r<br />\r<br />* Skyrim&#39;s main folder is the folder where you can find &#34;SkyrimLauncher.exe&#34;, \r<br />   &#34;TESV.exe&#34;, &#34;Data&#34; folder, etc... Overwrite anything if it asks.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Intallation short explanation:\r<br />[/b][/size]\r<br />Copy everything inside &#34;Osky Fantasy ENB&#34; folder to Skyrim&#39;s main folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Installation longer explanation:[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />1.: Go into &#34;main files&#34; folder, and copy everything inside that folder to Skyrim&#39;s main folder*:\r<br />   * Skyrim&#39;s main folder is the folder where you can find &#34;SkyrimLauncher.exe&#34;, \r<br />          &#34;TESV.exe&#34;, &#34;Data&#34; folder, etc... Overwrite anything if it asks.\r<br />\r<br />2.: Go back to &#34;osky&#34; folder, select a preset (standard, high, ultra), go into the preset&#39;s folder, select everything inside the folder and copy them to Skyrim&#39;s      main folder.\r<br />\r<br />3.: If you want to disable FPS lock, go into Skyrim&#39;s main folder, look for a file called &#34;enblocal.ini&#34;, open it, then look for a line: &#34;EnableFPSLimit = True&#34;        and change it to &#34;EnableFPSLimit = False&#34;. That&#39;s it.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]After installation:\r<br />[/size][/b]\r<br />Open enblocal.ini in Skyrim&#39;s main folder, and set the VideoMemorySizeMb parameter. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000](VRAM + RAM - 2048)[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Make sure that Anti-Aliasing (AA) and AnisotropicFiltering (AF) are disabled in the SkyrimLauncher options. (It is not needed, but recommended to disable Skyrim&#39;s own AA and AF in the SkyrimLauncher)\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][center][b]Additional graphics settings[/b][/center][/size]\r<br />\r<br />- If you find motion blur annoying, you can disable it by opening &#34;enblocal.ini&#34; in Skyrim&#39;s main folder, and change &#34;EnableLongExposureMode=true&#34; to &#34;EnableLongExposureMode=false&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />- If you want to open the in-game ENB configurator, press &#34;Shift+Enter&#34; in-game, but it is highly recommended to NOT use this feature, because the graphics presets were specially tweaked to give the best results&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]Compatibility[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />I used this ENB on a clean version of Skyrim, and on a heavily modified version of Skyrim too, and both worked fine. If you use this and you don&#39;t recognize any bugs, but something happens and ENB makes your Skyrim look bugged, than simply reinstall this mod. If it doesn&#39;t help, than one of your installed mods conflict with this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b][center]If you have any problems with this ENB preset, read this&#33;[/center][/b][/size]\r<br />1.: MAKE SURE you have bFloatPointRenderTarget = 1 in your SkyrimPrefs.ini in MyDocuments/Games/Skyrim\r<br /> \r<br />2.: MAKE SURE you have iWaterMultiSample = 0, and you have iMultiSample = 0 in your SkyrimPrefs.ini\r<br /> \r<br />3.: MAKE SURE you have bDoDepthOfField = 1 and you have bFXAAEnabled = 0 in your SkyrimPrefs.ini\r<br /> \r<br />4.: MAKE SURE you have iPresentInterval = 1 in your SkyrimPrefs.ini\r<br /> \r<br />5.: MAKE SURE you have bTransparencyMultisampling = 0 in your SkyrimPrefs.ini\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Also, if you have and ENB preset installed currently, but you want your game to look like the screenshots of Osky Fantasy ENB, than do this:\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />1.: Download Osky Fantasy ENB from Nexus and extract it\r<br /> \r<br />2.: Follow the installation instructions, but DO NOT remove your previous ENB preset.\r<br /> \r<br />3.: Overwrite anything if asks, but always make a backup\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The last thing you can try if none of these works is DISABLING AMBIENT OCCLUSION and ENB REFLECTIONS:\r<br />\r<br /> \r<br />1.: Open enbseries.ini, look for a line EnableAmbientOcclusion=true and change it to EnableAmbientOcclusion=false\r<br /> \r<br />2.: Look for a line EnableReflection=true and change it to EnableReflection=false\r<br /> \r<br />\r<br />If you still can&#39;t get the game working, open enblocal.ini in your Skyrim&#39;s main folder, and set &#34;UseDefferedRendering = true&#34; to &#34;UseDefferedRendering = False&#34;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you so unlucky and you still cannot get the game work, than try dowloading an older version of D3D9.dll from enbdev.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b][center]Uninstallation[/center][/b][/size]If you want to uninstall this mod, delete every file that belongs to this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b][center]Credits[/center][/b][/size]\r<br />Credits goes to: \r<br />\r<br />Bronze316\r<br />Boris Vorontsov, creator of the ENBSeries\r<br />Confidence-Man\r<br />Matso: Skyrim Visual Immersion\r<br />FXAA Injector www.3dcenter.org\r<br />gp65cj04: Bokeh DoF and Tilt Shift\r<br />--JawZ--: ENB Resources for Skyrim\r<br />CeeJay.dk: SweetFX Shader Suite\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Osky Fantasy ENB by oskidani\r<br />Thanks for checking it out, and enjoy ;)",
