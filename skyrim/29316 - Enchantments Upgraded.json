  "descriptionHtml": "Adds expanded enchantment visual effects to weapon enchantments.\r\n\r\nI always thought the base enchantments were a little subdued so all 11 of the vanilla weapon enchantments have been modified with added visuals.\r\n\r\nE.g. Shock now has lightning bolts that flash along the length of the weapon, Frost has a swirl of ice particles, Fire has flames etc.\r\n\r\nVisuals should be good with pretty much all of the weapon types. I have tested them with quite a few but I\\'ve definitely not covered all the possible variations!\r\n\r\nWith many thanks to matteos88, there is now an additional optional patch file for using this mod with SkyRe (as there seems to be a bit of a conflict). For load order, load SkyRe_main first, then this mod and finally the patch esp after the other two.\r\n",
