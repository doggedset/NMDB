  "modName": "Ildrameshs Folly - A Valley By Deepfolk Crossing",
  "summary": "Adds a valley with a story to be found by Deepfolk Crossing in the Northwest reaches of Skyrim. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "A linear series of dungeons that contain several boss encounters. I\\'ve added some books and notes to give some lore to the area please forgive my amateur writing, I tried to make up something relatively interesting. The dungeons are set in a valley occupied by a large group of bandits and the dungeons themselves contain some secret areas, many, many traps and of course boss encounters. I have now implemented all of the major areas of the mod and they are considered close to their finished state. All revisions will be bugfixing, optimizing and tweaks to loot or adding some secondary areas to add more flavor to the mod. There is no quest for this area and I don\\'t plan on implementing one, my modding skills aren\\'t adequate yet. The possibility is there for later on after I have done some work with questing in future mods. \r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions for this mod or future mods please comment! After all I\\'m making this stuff for other people as well, so your opinion matters! My status with this mod is I\\'m burnt out. I have learned alot making this one and I feel my time would be best used making a different mod that is higher quality overall. I will continue to support this mod, however.\r\n\r\nI\\'m also looking for someone to make a video for this mod, as I can\\'t do it myself. (Computer spec isn\\'t very good)\r\n\r\nPlans: Updated Feb. 19th\r\nVersion 2.5 Released\r\nChanges/Additions:\r\n-Optimized\r\n-Lighting Changes\r\n-Some minor bugfixes\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n- IMPORTANT - I have recently found some containers were accidentally modified in this mod changing all objects of that type to give additional loot. If this mod is active some objects will give more loot.\r\n-Dragons will not work properly in the valley due to a design flaw (or my ignorance of how dragons work)\r\n-The puzzle to enter the boss encounter has broken logic (But will not hinder the player)\r\n-Draugr in one area aren\\'t lootable (Still confused on fixing this one, their loot sucks anyway. XD)\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\nNone",
