  "descriptionHtml": "ANTI-IDLE SKYRIM\r\nA little utility by Noobo\r\n\r\nTired of seeing NPCs doing nothing? want to make them do \\'stuff\\'? sweep your house? read a book? sit by the fire, or maybe relax by the hotsprings (like those hunters)\r\nHeres the mod for you!\r\n\r\nThis collection of bat files allow you to spawn \\'markers\\' which tell an idle NPC to act out an animation of your choosing!\r\n\r\nIDLE ANIMATIONS:\r\no\tSit (cross legged)\r\no\tLay\r\no\tLeanrail\r\no\tLeantable\r\no\tLeanwall\r\no\tMeditate\r\no\tWorship\r\no\tWarm (stand and crouch around a fire)\r\no\tSweep\r\no\tRepair (hammer the wall)\r\no\tRead\r\no\tDrunk singing\r\no\tWoundedsit\r\no\tWoundedlay\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS:\r\nPlace all the txt. files in your Skyrim ROOT folder (the folder with TESV.exe or C/Programfiles/Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim)\r\n\r\nUSE:\r\n1)Simply open your command console ([~] key)\r\n2)Type: bat sit                            (or warm/read/sweep, whichever takes your fancy)\r\n3)Your NPC should (when idle) go to the spot where you entered the command and do the action\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nThese bats place a marker for idle animations. It will affect any NPC that is idle â€“ that includes your housecarl and spouse at home.\r\n\r\nSome NPC\\'s will not use these markers, simply because they will never \\'idle\\'. This applies to Town guards, travelers and some shopkeepers - To remedy this, some variants of guards will idle, just use the - help \\\"guard\\\" 0 - search function in console to track their base ID down.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to select and disable these markers once placed. So please SAVE before placing them because you might not be able to remove them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPATABILITY:\r\nThis should not have any conflict with any mod, it simply a vanilla use of the bat function to spawn an idle marker\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDIT:\r\nIf you enjoyed this please take a second to endorse this file on nexus\r\nThere is no need to credit me if you use this, I am simply utilizing the console commands to make a nice little utility.
