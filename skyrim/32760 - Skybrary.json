You can download from thornsoft.com)\r<br />\r<br />You can extract the folders into any place on your computer, they are not required to go into \r<br />the skyrim game directory.\r<br />\r<br />================================[/color]\r<br />If you want to install the SCRIPTS: extract the [non modders] directory file.\r<br />\r<br />1. Inside the non modders file is a directory called SCRIPTS,change directory so you are inside \r<br />,,,,the scripts directory.\r<br />2. Copy all the files inside the SCRIPTS directory to the skyrim directory (where you installed your \r<br />....game, where TESV.exe resides).\r<br />3. Run TESV.exe and in the console (you press tilde ~) type BAT HELP to start you off, or use \r<br />.....some of the commands listed in GKEYS for modders and nonmodders. \r<br />==============================\r<br />CLIPS:\r<br />1. Extract the [skyrim modders-clipmate version] folder to anywhere on your computer.\r<br />2. Install Clipmate. It has 30 day trial. I purchased mine.\r<br />...Included in the clipmate directory is  [Buttons] directory.  Copy it to your Clipmate installed \r<br />...directory where it also has a [buttons]\r<br />...directory.  512k is small so don&#39;t worry.  I did the work and made more icons.\r<br />,,,If you don&#39;t own or care to own clipmate, then you can create new documents, paste from clipmate\r<br />,, then uninstall clipmate.\r<br />,,Also, you can wait for me.  I am making exact duplicates so no method is missing something that\r<br />.. the other has.\r<br />\r<br />3. In the clipmate program there is an option to add databases, you then click &#39;add&#39;, browse to\r<br />,,,where you extracted the [skyrim modders-clipmate version] and for now on you will have all the \r<br />...clips, you can add your own as well.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#a61c00][size=5]DAWNGUARD:[/size][/color] No issues since this doesn&#39;t modify items Dawnguard relies on.\r<br />\r<br />=== FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION ====\r<br />THIS IS A COLLECTION OF EVERYONE&#39;S WORK.  I MAKE NO CLAIM I DID IT BY MYSELF\r<br />IT IS TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO COME TOGETHER AND PARTICIPATE IN THE NAME OF \r<br />HELPING EACH OTHER WITHOUT EXPECTING GRATUITIES (PAYMENT).  I volunteered with \r<br />police jr cadet program, hurricane relief, fund raisers for a community center; etc.  I never was\r<br />given a &#39;wage&#39;.  So all I am saying this is a VOLUNTEER Project and the &#39;wage&#39; is pride that you\r<br />are involved.  After comments on nexus forum/private chat.... I added this rant.\r<br />=============================\r<br />\r<br />Thanks, Hellcat5, Thirteen Oranges, DarkFox, creationkit.com & all modders helping put tesv \r<br />into shape.",
