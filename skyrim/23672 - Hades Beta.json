  "descriptionHtml": "(Comments and advice welcome)\r\nThis is a mod in progress just uploaded so me and a future team could work on it. I need team members to help work on it. I need LOD help and navmeshing help when its done.\r\nthis mod is going to be hades the underworld.( To get there you haft to take a right after you get to the vampire castle and cross a bridge and defeat the gatekeeper and go in the portal)\r\n\r\nspecial features of this mod is mining lavaglass and using that at hadesforge so far thats the only special thing in the mod worth checking out.\r\n\r\nA guy named Kempalot on steam made the mesh for the gate keeper hood, originaly called reaper hood i just retextured it tho. Here is the link to his mod http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22296 \r\n\r\ndont attack the enemys in hades because there is no navmeshing and it wil crash when the creatures get pushed from a spot. ( I don\\'t know if that\\'s what causes it or not because it only happens on the lava gargoyles\r\n\r\nYOU NEED DAWNGUARD FOR IT TO WORK!!!!\r\n\r\n(To install put the esp and the bsa into skyrim data folder)",
