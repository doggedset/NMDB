  "descriptionHtml": "This save was created for those who want begin new game but don\\'t want complete annoying High Hrothgar and Ustengrav for 101th time. Stopped at \\\"Blade in the dark\\\" cause after this you can fully feel free. \r\nAnother reason (for me at least) to create this save was to avoid quest bugs: final battle with Miraak that sometimes caused by using old save (game started before Dragonborn DLC), and bug with Delphine caused by unknown reason (probably by one of my mods).\r\nSave info:\r\n1st level, no points spent, default appearance, name \\\"Prisoner\\\", standing in Dragons Reach.\r\nSomewhat increased \\\"destruction\\\" and \\\"onehanded\\\".\r\nQuests were completed in \\\"speedrun mode\\\": with tgm, minimum dialogues, avoiding most combats.\r\nQuest sequence: Ralof\\'s side in Helgen, Bleakfalls Barrow started in Whiterun, not Riverwood (golden claw in inventory), Ustengrav \\\"speedrunned\\\" - word of power learned, Urgen\\'s horn returned, 3rd power in \\\"unrelenting force\\\" learned, killed dragon in Kyns Grow. Killed \\\"cultists\\\" (can\\'t avoid this :( ) - started \\\"dragonborn\\\".\r\nSave was made on game version 1.9.32.0, russian, with Dawnguard, Heartfire, Hi-Res pack and Dragonborn DLCs activated, launched with SKSE. Save created with \\\"save\\\" console command.\r\nUsed some cosmetic mods (textures, meshes) but they actually have no influence on save file.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nPut file in My Documents\\\\My games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves\r\nor\r\nC:\\\\Users\\\\*username*\\\\Documents\\\\My games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves\r\n",
