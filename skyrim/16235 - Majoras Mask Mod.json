I didn\\'t enchant it so you can customize it yourself.\r\nThe Mask works now with all races but it looks a little bit off on Argonians.\r\nYes the Mod is now really online ;)\r\n\r\nThe Legend of Zelda - Majoras Mask Skyrim Mod\r\n\r\nI did the 3D Mesh of the Mask just for fun and practice in 3ds Max but when it was done I thought it would be a pity not to use it for something so i created this Skyrim Mod.\r\nI hope all the Zeldafans who play Skyrim have fun with this mod.\r\nIf you like it please leave a comment and rate it!\r\n\r\nChangelog 09.05.2012\r\nThe Masks Eyes now glow in the dark\r\n\r\nChangelog 13.05.2012\r\nThis is a major update!\r\nI have assigned the mask to a new equipment Slot (55) so you can wear it with all other Equipments, except maybe some other mods.\r\nAlso the mask is now craftable in the Forge as Jewelery and Upgradeable on the Armory Table.\r\nYou can forge a light armor and a heavy armor version of it.\r\nThe Mask lying on the table in Breezehome is the light version.\r\n\r\n3D mesh by Martin Steinberger (motch1391)\r\nTexture by Martin Steinberger (motch1391)\r\nMod by Martin Steinberger (motch1391)\r\nMajoras Mask by Nintendo",
