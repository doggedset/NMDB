  "descriptionHtml": "Asmosia&#39;s Trading Card Collection is a compilation of mods that will soon add over 500 trading cards to the game&#33; This page is dedicated to the collection as a whole and has a master download of all of the files in addition to a single download for the master .ESM for use with individual expansions&#33; I will have all of the links to the individual packs below. This ESM adds a house where the printer of all of the cards lives. it is along the road from Riverwood to Whiterun so it will be easy to visit on your way through to visit Whiterun for the first time. Asmosia Vivic is the owner of the shop (No he is not named after the Ex-Tribunal member, I had the name first as it is the last name of all of my characters in most of my games). He will sell a random assortment of cards of each expansion as they come out and are released to the public.\r<br />\r<br />How to install you may ask? Use the download through manager and enable it in the manager, or download it manually and put the files in their corresponding folders. Note: The landspace fix .esp usurps a bug I discovered involving .esms and Tamriel&#39;s worldspace reverting to normal in-game. It is essential unless you want a rock and several trees on top of Asmosia&#39;s house.\r<br />\r<br />Fan Promotion Video on City Edition&#33;\r<br />http://youtu.be/xXMVWX9sIac\r<br />\r<br />The packs currently included are (You do not need to download each individual expansion if you have the Master Collection:\r<br />\r<br />City Edition- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/39504/?\r<br />\r<br />    This pack is entitled City Edition. I have gone through Solitude, Windhelm, Whiterun, Markarth, and Riften and individually placed all 55 cards that I have created for this first edition. Some are easy to find, while others not quite so much&#33; There is a book that you will be able to find in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun with possibly your first card located on top of it&#33; This book will tell you the names and the card number of each card that you can find in this first set&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Bandit Edition-\r<br />\r<br />   This pack is entitled Bandit Edition. I have added over 60 cards to the inventories of over 360 different random leveled bandits. It should not affect any leveled lists as it is its own. There is a book in the store of Asmosia Vivic.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you take the time to enjoy this mod&#33; There should be no conflicts with any other mod created. This mod does not require any of the official DLCs however I will be putting out DLC exclusive cards that will be entitled Dawnguard Deadly Creatures, etc.\r<br />\r<br />Plans for the future?\r<br />\r<br />-Next package will be forest and monstrous creatures.\r<br />There will be a various percentage drop chance that a card will come off of a creature that matches the creatures type such as a Giant Frostbite Spider.\r<br />\r<br />-Skyrim Settlements\r<br />\r<br />-Questlines (Dark Brotherhood, Companions, etc...)\r<br />\r<br />-Landmarks Locations\r<br />\r<br />-Settlements\r<br />\r<br />-Vendors\r<br />\r<br />-And much more",
