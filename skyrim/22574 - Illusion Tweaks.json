  "summary": "They say all of life is an illusion, so why is that spell school so wimpy? Not any more!",
  "descriptionHtml": "Basically, this edits the animage, kindred mage, and Master of the mind perks to be more effective. Animage now makes all illusion spells 2.5 times stronger, kindred mage makes them 3 times stronger, and master of the mind now makes it so your illusion spells never fail. (I mean, you are the MASTER). This is my first mod, so let me know if I did something wrong and/or if this doesn\\'t work. I\\'ll be testing it myself shortly for conflicts. It doesn\\'t change anything other than those perks, so it shouldn\\'t conflict with anything... I think.",
