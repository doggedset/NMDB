  "summary": "What would you do for the one you love?\r\n\r\nTrue Daedric Artifacts is the silent story of a remarkable woman.\r\nDiscover her origins on your search for power, but beware.\r\nPower always demands a price.\r\nIt\\'s up to you to decide if you\\'re willing to pay it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nYou now have the option to melt down Daedric Artifacts at the smelter for Tokens.\r\nCollect Tokens, forge Words, create a Name.\r\nYou shouldn\\'t be able to see the option to smelt/forge unless you have the required item.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: You will need to have Mehrunes\\' Razor in order to see the smelting recipe for it.\r\nSkyforge Smithing required (at some point, but not at first).\r\n\r\nFind your new follower inside the shrine of Mehrunes Dagon.\r\nYou can marry her (but you don\\'t have to).\r\nIf you want to kill her, don\\'t try unless you\\'re ready... or immortal.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\nThis is my first mod on Skyrim Nexus.\r\nPlease report any bugs, and I will try to see to them.\r\nThings in this mod use the prefix \\\"OPack1\\\".\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS:\r\n\r\nThe hard way:\r\n\r\n1. Collect daedric artifacts.\r\n(http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Daedric_Quests)\r\n2. Smelt them into tokens.\r\n3. Forge tokens into Words.\r\n4. Skyforge words into a Name.\r\n5. Kill the follower included with this mod for an item.\r\n6. Skyforge the Name and the Item into a spell that will take you to the room.\r\n\r\nStep 1 is important because you won\\'t be able to see the smelting recipe unless you have a daedric artifact.\r\nYou will need a total of 14 tokens, so basically this mod encourages you to play through the content to get the game\\'s daedric artifacts.\r\nYou will not have to smelt down the skeleton key or the oghma.\r\n\r\nThe easy way:\r\n\r\nSpoiler Alert: doing it the easy way, in my opinion, ruins like half of the experience of this mod, but I said I would reveal it so here it is.\r\ncoc opack1_room001\r\nBut, you should be able to get there without cheating.\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\n\r\nAdded a craftable to the Skyforge.\r\nRequires you to have a certain book in your possession to see the recipe.\r\nYou will know which book I mean once you get to the Room at the end of the journey.\r\n\r\nv1.2\r\n\r\nFixed the default follower bow:\r\n1. Playable\r\n2. Removed from \\\"DialogueFollower\\\" quest.\r\n(What this means is that the game won\\'t give your follower a default bow when you ask them to join you; the addition of making it playable is so that you can go into their inventory and manually remove any bows they might already be carrying.)\r\n\r\nv1.3\r\n\r\nAdded: Staff of Life.\r\n\r\nv1.4\r\n\r\nAdded: Wabbajack, Gold Edition.",
