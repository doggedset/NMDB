It also has an outside blacksmithing area, everything but a smelter. Be warned it is protected by some very tough bandits. May clash with other homes such as Darkwater Home, but i think thats below mine, Darkwater Keep, Darkwater Overlook.....\r<br />\r<br />The update files contains small changes such as a fix for the blacksmithing trough, changed some containers, chest for potions now looks like various bottles on a shelf, crate of scrolls and tomes, etc...see pics....",
