  "descriptionHtml": "[size=28] Elseryls Final Loss [/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3]This is my first, and maybe last quest mod, as I\\\\\\'m a lot better at player abodes, decorating etc.\r\nSo this quest is based on a family that were recently robbed. You go Whiterun\\\\\\'s bannered mare, and notice a Unhappy Dark Elf Male in there. You talk to him, he asks you a favour, you either accept the favour or deny it. When accepted and finished, he will ask you a new favour to help his robbed family. There are various quests in, and 5 new NPCS. They are NOT voice acted, if anyone would like to voice act any characters, PM Me! [/size]\r\n\r\nInstallation :\r\n\r\nA Rather simple installation, [i]Drag and drop ESM file to /Skyrim/Data[/i] Folder.",
