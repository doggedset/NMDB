  "modName": "Ethereal Bow",
  "summary": "A bow that can be crafted and upgraded.  It looks the same as the Bound Bow.  The bow also comes with an Ice Shard arrow maker that can also be crafted.",
  "descriptionHtml": "EDITOR NOTE: Changed a few things around so hopefully this mod will now be functional.  Also, the two optional arrows should be usable as stand alone mods.\r\n\r\nThe Ethereal Bow is a light weight bow with the same good looks of the Bound Bow.  The bow its self is craft able at the blacksmith for 2 Ebony Bars, 1 Grand Soulgem, and 1 Ectoplasm.  The pattern is found in a section called Draugr.  The bow can then be upgraded at the grinding wheel for 1 Grand Soul Gem.  The bow can also be enchanted like any normal bow.\r\n\r\nThe arrow Makers:\r\n\r\n1: Ice Shard Arrow Maker(included)\r\nThese arrows look like bound arrows.  When fired, they have an extra glow effect on their tip.  The also explode on impact, spraying the area with ice shards, and doing extra damage and some knock back.  You get 25 arrows for the cost of 50 Magicka.  The Ice Shard arrow maker is included with the bow and can be crafted in the Draugr section at the forge.  It requires 1 Iron bar, 1 Leather strap, and 1 Ectoplasm.\r\n\r\n2: Slayer Arrow Maker(optional)\r\nThe Arrows of Slaying are highly powerful Glass arrows. When fired, they have a brighter Green glow from their tips.  They have a faster flying speed then normal arrows.  You only get 5 arrows for the cost of 50 Magicka due too their Greater damage.  Use wisely.  The Slayer Arrow Maker is an Optional Download.  It can be crafted at the forge under Draugr for 1 Iron Bar, 1 Leather Strap, and 1 Malachite.\r\n\r\n3: Unbound Chicken Maker(optional)\r\nThese arrows are not arrows at all.  The Unbound Chicken is a suicidal chicken bent on destruction.  They allow you too fire them out of your bow and impact with a decent amount of force.  They explode on contact with hard surfaces.  These arrows are just for when you want too have a Clucking good time.  Some side effects are; Chickens stuck too the side of your victims.  A sudden hunger for KFC.  A strange urge too cluck at your screen when using them.  You get 25 Chickens for the cost of 50 Magicka.  Yes, chickens do work for \\\"cheap\\\".  The Unbound Chicken Maker is an optional download.  It is crafted at the forge under Draugr for 1 Iron Bar, 1 Leather Strap, and 1 Chicken Egg. \r\n\r\n4: Ice Blast Arrow Maker(Optional) *NEW, by request*\r\nThese arrows look like bound arrows. They explode on impact with a blast of snow and ice, doing a lot more damage and some knock back.  You get 5 arrows for the cost of 50 Magicka.  The Ice Blast arrow maker can be crafted in the Draugr section at the forge.  It requires 1 Iron bar, 1 Leather strap, and 1 Frost Salt.\r\n\r\nHow too use: \r\nThe Bow works like a normal bow.  \r\nThe Arrow Makers are dummy items that are only used too trigger a script.  In the inventory, equip the maker like any dagger.  Once it is equipped, it should automatically add the arrows too you inventory without you having too leave it.  Just select the arrows and a bow before leaving you inventory again and you should be good too go.\r\n\r\nIn the works:\r\n1: More Arrow types.\r\n2: An inventory image for the Summoner bow, right now there is none.\r\n3: A unique inventory image for the arrow makers, so it is easier too distinguish them from daggers.\r\nI hope you enjoy this mod I made for the fun of it.  I will be adding other types of arrows over time.  Some of them might even be practical. hehe",
