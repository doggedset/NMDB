  "summary": "Sahrotaar was so easily swayed by you that you can summon him from beyond the grave.",
  "descriptionHtml": "It was a shame that Miraak killed Sahrotaar and there was nothing you could do to stop him. But it turns out Sahrotaar was so sick of Miraak that he put a piece of his soul into a book and had it sent by courier to High Hrothgar. Sadly, his letters were left outside the entrance, by a rather empty chest, unread and cold. Maybe you&#39;ll read his letters.\r<br />\r<br />If you do, you can summon Sahrotaar and he&#39;ll fly around and help you for a bit. Only for about five minutes though, since you absorbed his soul a while back and his corporeal form is a bit... weak. \r<br />\r<br />This is a three-word Dragon shout and needs 3 souls to unlock.\r<br />\r<br />Sahrotaar will use any model replacers you give him. I recommend the Sahrotaar replacer in Chaos Dragons, makes him unique when compared to other serpentine dragons.",
