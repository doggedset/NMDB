These are the two locations where the Maramal, priest of Mara, sells Amulets of Mara.\n<br />Once inside, talk to Maramal.\n<br />\n<br />-Chat about Mara and weddings, and he asks if the Dragonborn knows how marriage works in Skyrim. After an explanation, the Dragonborn can purchase an Amulet of Mara for 200 .\n<br />\n<br />-Wearing this amulet broadcasts to the other citizens that the Dragonborn is available. Locate a compatible citizen and speak with them. Some citizens cannot be married and others require that certain tasks be performed beforehand.\n<br />\n<br />-Travel back to the temple in Riften, tell the priest, and have a ceremony.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=====Credits=====\n<br />\n<br />Apachii (Wood Elf's Hair)\n<br />\n<br />RAN46 (Modified Vanilla Head Meshes)",
