  "descriptionHtml": "Ok, so I know a couple of you are wondering why the update isn\\'t up yet. I\\'ve been really caught up in stuff in my personal life (had to go out of town for a funeral two days ago), and I\\'ve been having trouble getting all of the voices for NPCs and stuff together and put into the mod. While out of town, I started a mod based off of a book that I\\'m writing. If you liked Axiem Castle, you should like this one. It has almost all of Axiem Castles features and more. I also placed the portal to it very close to Axiem Castle for your guys convenience. You can get all the info for the mod on it\\'s page, cause it\\'s too much for me to put on here. Check it out! Here\\'s link: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10513\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\nHey everyone. Sorry I\\'m taking longer than usual to get out the next update, but I\\'m putting a lot more into 1.4 than I had originally intended to, like cave networks connected to the castle, advanced NPC Dialogue with voices, quests, tons of NPC\\'s, several merchants, and all the stuff that was originally going to be in 1.4, so at least you guys get all that stuff with it when it does come out. I should be getting it out by Sunday, so be expecting it. :)\r\n\r\n~Vulden\r\n\r\nDescription: Axiem Castle is a very large, player owned castle perched on the top of a mountain and surrounded by the snow covered forests that blanket Skyrim, just SouthWest of Dawnstar. At the peak of a mountain, Axiem Castle gives the player an expansive view of Skyrim\\'s beautiful landscape, making not only an ideal spot for a castle visually, but strategically as well. \r\n\r\nFeatures~\r\n-Large Castle Exterior\r\n-Map Marker\r\n-Castle Guards\r\n-Throne Room\r\n-Alchemy Room\r\n-Enchanting Room\r\n-Cooking Room\r\n-Master Bedroom with closet\r\n-Barracks\r\n-Treasury Room\r\n-King\\'s Study\r\n-58 Weapon Racks\r\n-6 Mannequins\r\n-4 Weapon Plaques \r\n-Butler\r\n-Treasury Room\r\n-Crafting Room with forge, workbench, smelter, tanning rack, sharpening wheel, and wood chopping block\r\n-Housecarl/Thane\r\n-Storage Room\r\n-King and Queen Thrones\r\n-More Coming!\r\n\r\nParts of the Castle:\r\n-Castle Exterior(COMPLETED)\r\n-Map Marker(COMPLETED)\r\n-Throne Room(COMPLETED)\r\n-Master Bedroom with closet(COMPLETED)\r\n-Crafting Room(COMPLETED)\r\n-Enchanting Room(COMPLETED)\r\n-Alchemy Room(COMPLETED)\r\n-Cooking Room(COMPLETED)\r\n-Storage Room(COMPLETED)\r\n-Treasury Room(COMPLETED)\r\n-Kings Study(COMPLETED)\r\n-Great Library\r\n-Secret Caverns\r\n-Garden\r\n-Grand Dining Hall\r\n-Temple\r\n-Barracks(COMPLETED)\r\n\r\n1.3 Additions~\r\n\r\n-Barracks\r\n-50 Weapon Racks\r\n-More Guards\r\n-Butler\r\n-Housecarl/Thane\r\n\r\n\r\nBugs~\r\n*If you have any experience with fixing bugs and think you can fix one of these, please contact me at airkonic@gmail.com.*\r\n\r\n-Sometimes when you fast travel to the castle the exterior is invisible, except for the two doors.
