Ask questions. You don\\'t ask, you never learn.” - Little Secret topic from Morrowind[/i][/center]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][b]Requirements[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n- [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE 1.6.16 or higher[/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14884/?]Fuz Ro-D-Oh - Silent Voice[/url] \r\n\r\nSince Topics of Skyrim does not have voice acting, Silent Voice generates a silent voice file and lip synch for each topic, allowing you to have the time to read the text and see the NPC moves his lips as he speaks.\r\n\r\nIf you do not install Silent Voice, the new dialogue will be barely readable because of how fast it skips to the next lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][b]What does it do?[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nTopics of Skyrim adds 700 new lines of dialogue contained in 35 new dialogue topics and 153 subtopics. Most of the dialogue comes from the previous Elder Scrolls games, Morrowind and Daggerfall, and some have been modified/updated/added for Skyrim’s context. \r\n\r\nYou can ask trainers more information about the skill they teach, ask faction members for advice, have a chat with a bard about history and the lost races of Tamriel, seek information from a conjurer about the Skyrim’s undead and much more.\r\n\r\nNot everyone in Skyrim knows something about everything. You’ll have to seek the right profession or people about a particular subject. For instance, try asking an alchemist about potions and diseases.\r\n\r\nThere are two people in Skyrim who are the most knowledgeable: Bards and Urag gro-Shub; the librarian at the College of Winterhold.\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][b]Technical - Mod Compatibility[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[b]Compatiblity[/b]\r\n\r\nTopics of Skyrim should be compatible with any mod there is, quest mods included. New topics will be added to modded NPCs if the right conditions are met.\r\n",
