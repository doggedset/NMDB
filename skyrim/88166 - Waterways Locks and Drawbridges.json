  "modName": "Waterways Locks and Drawbridges",
  "summary": "Waterway locks were built by fishermen on White River between Riverwood and Lake Ilinalta in order to improve navigation with small boats and to catch fish between locks. The people of The Rift replaced three stone bridges on Lake Honrich and Treva River with wooden drawbridges for allowing navigation with big boats between Riften and Ivarstead.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=4]Description[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod is composed of two main features: waterway locks at the old Falkreath/Whiterun holds border and drawbridges in Rift Hold.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Locks[/b][/size]\n<br />Two weirs were placed on White River near Embershard Mine. A small pond is created behind the lower lock. Salmons are captive between locks, meaning easy fishing for the nearby Riverwood residents. There are two fishermen and a small boat on the shore of the pond. In theory,  the locks are handled by fishermen by using the wooden pillars nearby when they need to navigate or wish a new stock of salmons.\n<br />Due to the upstream locks, White River is now flowing less turbulent near Riverwood.\n<br />Locks were not built in other places because of the too high waterfalls and/or because of the lack of an important water route.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/88166/88166-1512064068-1929621446.jpeg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Drawbridges[/size][/b]\n<br />Three stone bridges were replaced with wooden drawbridges in order to allow the navigation with big boats between Lake Geir and Lake Honrich.\n<br />The replaced bridges are in the following areas: Heartwood Mill, Treva's Watch and south of Sarethi Farm.\n<br />In some places, Treva River was deepened and enlarged for the new boat traffic.\n<br />Three big boats are aded in The Rift: 1 near Heartwood bridge (and 1 small boat), 1 near Sarethi bridge and 1 at the newly added Ivarstead dock (all boats have fish and other cargo onboard). Few sailors and fishermen are placed on and near the new boats.\n<br />The new bridges are composed of wooden ramps and drawbridges. The drawbridges are static, with no levier for rising them. In theory, the drawbridge must be handled only be sailors when they need clear water path and by using the wooden pillars nearby.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/88166/88166-1512064069-289873725.jpeg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Requirements:[/b][/u]\n<br />Skyrim, with or without addons/mods.\n<br />[b][u]\n<br />Compatibility:[/u][/b]\n<br />No known incompatibility.
