I got busy with other projects and just life in general, plus I wanted to take a break from body textures and branch out into other types of mods. Now, several months after it&#39;s original inception Glorious Perspiration finaly sees the light of day.\r<br />\r<br />So, what is it? Well, put simply it&#39;s a set of body textures designed to give the illusion of three dimensional sweat.\r<br />\r<br />This mod was originally inspired by xs2reality&#39;s &#34;Sporty Sexy Sweat&#34; mod. He did a fantastic job with his textures and the fact that he&#39;d only edited the s.dds files meant they were compatible with just about any body texture set.  Still though, I couldn&#39;t see why no one had taken the idea to it&#39;s next logical step. \r<br />\r<br />So, building on the idea xs&#39;s original mod I set about making a more substantial set of textures by applying the appropriate layers to both the surface textures and s.dds files as well as the normal maps.\r<br />\r<br />The downside of all this is that unlike Xs&#39;s mod, this mod requires you to replace most your characters textures. For this reason I have included the resource files in the optional files section for editing and modding purposes.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy the mod and don&#39;t forget to endorse it if you do.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=#FFFF00][b]Installation:[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Download the file, unzip and copy/paste the contents to your skyrim data directory. Click yes when asked to overwrite.\r<br />\r<br />At present the mod only replaces the diffuse and specular maps. So you can can use any set of normal maps you wish without fear of incompatibility.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Bugs/Incompatibilities:\r<br />\r<br />None that I have found.\r<br />Please report any bugs or fixes.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=#FFFF00][b]FAQ&#39;s:[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Q: Can I use this with custom races.\r<br />A: Yes, all custom races (even the scripted ones) use the same basic formula  \r<br />     and setup as that of the vanilla races with the largest difference being \r<br />     that custom races draw their assets (textures/meshes) from a different \r<br />     file location.  Find out where your custom races&#39;s textures are installed \r<br />     and copy/paste over them with the new textures.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Do you plan on providing 7Base support.\r<br />A: UNP is 7Base support, the two body textures are compatible.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Do you plan on providing support for any other body support like   \r<br />      Blessed, Dreamgirl or ADEC?\r<br />A: No, this is as much a proof of concept as it is a complete mod. I&#39;ve made\r<br />     the resource files available and anyone is free to use them. \r<br />\r<br />Q: I can&#39;t figure out how to install these textures.\r<br />A: They go in the &#34;textures&#34; folder. I&#39;ll let you figure it out from there\r<br />\r<br />Q: Can you make it more shiny?\r<br />A: No. The effect is meant to be subtle but, if you don&#39;t like the current \r<br />     presets you are free to use the resource files as you see fit.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Why are these files so big?\r<br />A: As with most of the textures I create, these textures are lossless which is\r<br />     to say they are not compressed in any way. This has the benefit of preser\r<br />     ving the images overall clarity and detail but also makes them much \r<br />     larger than standard textures.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=#FFFF00][b]Future Plans:[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />At this point I don&#39;t really have much in way of future plans. The mod is not done yet and there are still some improvments I&#39;d like to make, so as this project progresses I&#39;ll be concentrating on improving and building on what I&#39;ve already created.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve recieved a lot of feed back already on this mod and the most prevalent critisism I&#39;ve recieved is that this mod would perhaps be better served as a race menu overlay or even a scripted shader effect.  Although I&#39;m certainly not oppossed to the idea, I&#39;d like the opportunity to perfect the assets first before I consider alternate applications.\r<br />\r<br />In the meantime, the resource files are available to everyone and will be updated as the mod progresses.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=#FFFF00][b]Mods Used:[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Somber 3 ENB\r<br />Elwin&#39;s Pumps 2\r<br />Temptress Race\r<br />Bodyslide 2\r<br />Racemenu\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=#FFFF00][b]Similar/Recommended Mods:[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />WetBumps 1 2 3  \r<br />A great mod by Cald123, takes assets from GP and combines them with a detailed (oiled) specular map. \r<br />\r<br />Sporty Sexy Sweat  [url=http://http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28946/?][/url]\r<br />The mod that inspired glorious perspiration, If your unwilling to commit this mods character texture overhaul I&#39;d highly recommend this mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=#FFFF00][b]Credits:[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />xs2reality - for &#34;Sporty Sexy Sweat&#34;\r<br />Bethesda - for an awesome game",
