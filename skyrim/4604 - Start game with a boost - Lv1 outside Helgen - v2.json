  "summary": "Start at level 1 outside Helgen with 1 full set of weapons & armors for each of the 3 play types (mage, thief, and warrior). Weapons & armors have some very nice enchantments on them to help give you out. Some other tweaks have been added as well.",
  "descriptionHtml": "---------- NEW VERSION (2.0) ----------\r\n\r\nWith this save file you start as a female nord right outside of Helgen (after the opening escape quest).\r\n\r\nIf you wish to change the name, appearance, sex, or race of this character, open the console by pressing the ~ key and entering the command SHOWRACEMENU.\r\n\r\nThe following permanent changes have been made to this character:\r\n- Carry weight has been increased by 5000.\r\n- Base unarmed damage has been increased to 30.\r\n- Shout recovery time reduced to zero.\r\n- No decrease of health regeneration rate while in combat.\r\n- Movement speed increased to 2x normal speed.\r\n- All merchants will buy stolen goods.\r\n- All merchants will buy any item type regardless of the type of merchant they are.\r\n- All enchantments learned and usable.\r\n\r\nThe following items have been added to this character\\'s inventory. Note that all the names I have given these items have an asterisk at the front. This is so that they will always appear at the top of your weapon & armor lists regardless of what other items you have in your inventory. I do this for all of my self enchanted items, it really is a huge time saver because it allows you to find them quickly without having to scroll down through your lists.\r\n\r\nMAGE GEAR - Based on Psiijic Order set\r\n- Mage\\'s Hood: Alteration, destruction, restoration, and illusion -33% cost\r\n- Mage\\'s Robes: Conjuration -25% cost, Magicka +62, Magicka regen +62%, Health regen +31%\r\n- Mage\\'s Gloves: Health +62, Poison resist +37%, Disease resist +62%, Water breathing\r\n- Mage\\'s Boots: Magic resist +20%, Fire, ice, and shock resist +46%\r\n- Mage\\'s Weapons: Absorb 20 magicka, Soul trap 5 seconds (dagger, 1h axe/mace/sword)\r\n\r\nTHIEF\\'S GEAR - Based on Leather Armor set\r\n- Thief\\'s Helmet: Illusion & Alteration -25% cost, Poison resist +37%, Disease resist +62%\r\n- Thief\\'s Armor: Health & stamina regen + 50%, Light armor +40, Water breathing\r\n- Thief\\'s Bracers: Magic resist +20%, Sneak, pickpocket, and lockpicking +40%\r\n- Thief\\'s Boots: Muffle, Fire, ice, shock resist +40%\r\n- Thief\\'s Weapons: 2 second paralyze, Soul trap 5 seconds (dagger, bow, 1h axe/mace/sword)\r\n\r\nWARRIOR\\'S GEAR - Based on Wolf Armor set\r\n- Warrior\\'s Helmet: Health & stamina +100, Health & stamina regen +50%\r\n- Warrior\\'s Armor: Conjuration & restoration -25% cost, Magicka regen +62%, Water breathing\r\n- Warrior\\'s Gauntlets: +20 unarmed damage, Heavy armor +41, Disease resist +100%, Poison resist +62%\r\n- Warrior\\'s Boots: Magic resist +20%, Fire, ice, and shock resist +46%\r\n- Warrior\\'s Weapons: Absorb 10 health & 10 stamina, Soul trap 5 seconds (Dagger, bow, 1h axe/mace/sword, 1h axe/mace/sword)\r\n\r\nUNIVERSAL ITEMS\r\n- Power Ring: Archery, 1 Handed, and 2 Handed +40% damage\r\n- Amulet of Ultimate Haggling: Prices are 1000% better (Selling prices and buying prices will be close to the same)\r\n- 1,000 Iron arrows\r\n- 10,000 gold (to help with buying & furnishing your first house in Whiterun)\r\n\r\nTo make these gears I used a mod to allow me to put 4 enchantments on each piece of gear plus a mod that allows any enchantment to go on any piece of gear. But the good thing is that you don\\'t need to have these mods installed to be able to run this save game, because once the enchantments are on the gear they are there for good whether you have the mods or not.\r\n\r\n4 enchantment effects per item instead of 2 (by Kivespussi):\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=990\r\nAny enchantment on any gear (by fireundubh):\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3313\r\n\r\nTrue, some of these enchantments could have been lower, but I didn\\'t want to set the enchanting skill any lower than 100 during the enchanting process to make sure I was not gaining any experience points in the process of making any of the gear. I wanted to keep all skills at the absolute minimum in level AND in experience.\r\n\r\nBoosting this starter save through the use of gear rather than increasing skills or abilities through the console allows most of these bonuses (aside from the ones listed as permanent above) to be removed from the player by simply unequipping the item(s) so if you feel you don\\'t want or need any or all of them, you\\'re not stuck with them forever.\r\n\r\nOther than what has been noted above, there has been nothing else changed on this file apart from what you normally encounter on your way out of Helgen. Level is at 1, all skills are at starting levels, no perks learned, no shouts/words learned, no spells learned except the flames & healing you start with, no map markers discovered, no quests started.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\n---------- ORIGINAL VERSION (1.0) ----------\r\n\r\nWith this save file you start as a female nord right outside of Helgen (after the opening escape quest).\r\n\r\nIf you wish to change the name, appearance, sex, or race of this character, open the console by pressing the ~ key and entering the command SHOWRACEMENU.\r\n\r\nThe following permanent changes have been made to this character:\r\n- Carry weight has been increased by 5000.\r\n- Base unarmed damage has been increased to 50. This should result in around double the maximum unarmed damage towards end game.\r\n- Shout recovery time reduced to zero.\r\n- Health regeneration rate increased to 2x normal rate\r\n- No decrease of health regeneration rate while in combat\r\n- Movement speed increased to 2x normal speed\r\n- All merchants will buy stolen goods\r\n- All merchants will buy any item type regardless of the type of merchant they are\r\n- All enchantments learned and usable\r\n\r\nThe following items have been added to this character\\'s inventory:\r\n- Necklace with 100% magic and frost resist\r\n- Ring with 100% disease and poison resist\r\n- Boots (1 iron, 1 fur) with 100% fire and shock resist\r\n- Armor (1 iron, 1 fur) with 100% cost reduction for destruction & restoration\r\n- Helmet (1 iron, 1 fur) with 100% cost reduction for alteration & illusion\r\n- Gloves (1 iron, 1 fur) with +61 to armor (heavy or light, respectively) and +100% sneak effectiveness\r\n- Shield (1 iron, 1 hide) with block 100% more damage\r\n- Hunter\\'s bow & 1 of each type of iron weapon each with 3 second paralyze and 3 second fiery soul trap\r\n- 1000 standard iron arrows\r\n\r\nI left out conjuration casting cost reduction because I did not have room for all 5 magic schools and it seemed to me that it was the school that required cost reductions the least.\r\n\r\nI tried to make these sets of armor so that they give a good boost no matter what type of character you are playing (mage, thief, warrior, etc.) but with limited slots available for enchantment, it\\'s not very easy to do. But I think I have it set up so no matter how you want to play these gears should prove useful to you.\r\n\r\nBoosting this starter save through the use of gear rather than increasing skills or abilities through the console allows most of these bonuses (aside from the ones listed as permanent above) to be removed from the player by simply unequipping the item(s) so if you feel you don\\'t want or need any or all of them, you\\'re not stuck with them forever.\r\n\r\nOther than what has been noted above, there has been nothing else changed on this file apart from what you normally encounter on your way out of Helgen.
