  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Verdana][size=4][b][i]Intro:[/i][/b][/size]\r<br />[size=3]It always annoyed me how unrealistically heavy some of the items are, so I fixed this.\r<br />\r<br />I have reduced the weights of a large amount of items and on the odd occasion, I have increased some weights for certain items for greater consistency and realism, but my mod will definitely make you much lighter overall&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4][b]Ingredients:[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=3]For the ingredients, the lightest items are flowers at 0.1 and the heaviest is a Giant&#39;s Toe at 0.8. The rest of the items weigh somewhere logically in between but the majority weigh under 0.5.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4][b]Potions:[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=3]I also hated how all of the potions weighed 0.5 - they would obviously all be different weights&#33; So, the weaker potions are now the lightest and the stronger more advanced potions are heavier at around the vanilla weight.\r<br />\r<br /> For example...\r<br />Potion of Minor Healing = 0.1\r<br />Potion of Healing = 0.2\r<br />Potion of Plentiful Healing = 0.3\r<br />Potion of Vigorous Healing = 0.4\r<br />Potion of Extreme Healing = 0.5\r<br />Potion of Ultimate Healing = 0.6\r<br />\r<br />I think this also gives you a way of understanding those confusing names, with different weights it will now be more obvious which ones are better than others.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4][b]Food:[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=3]I kept many of the food items the same but I decreased many of the meat items to what I perceive as a more consistent value, and all the soups/stews now weigh 0.3. \r<br />The lightest items are things such as apples, carrots and dumplings weighing just 0.1 and the heaviest are Mammoth Steak and Goats Cheese Wheel at around 1. \r<br />All of the drinks weigh 0.5, this is the vanilla value but I fixed some inconsistencies. \r<br />\r<br />In order to make my mod overwrite the weight changes made by iNeed, install iNeed first then disable the weight changes in the iNeed difficulty tab in the mod menu in game, then install my mod and load it after iNeed.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4][b]Hides/Pelts:[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=3]I changed the weights of Hides/Pelts:\r<br />Fox = 0.5\r<br />Goat = 0.7\r<br />Wolf = 1\r<br />Deer = 1\r<br />Cow = 1.5\r<br />Sabre Cat = 1.5\r<br />Horse = 2\r<br />Bear = 2.5\r<br />Werewolf = 3\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4][b]Misc:[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=3]I left the weights of ingots and ores at 1 however I re-entered/overwrote this value so that my mod should overwrite any mod that changes these values such as Complete Crafting Overhaul Remade if you load it after.\r<br />\r<br />I changed the weight of leather to 0.4 since you can make 4 leather strips from 1 leather and each leather strip weighs 0.1.\r<br />\r<br />I reduced the weight of all scrolls from 0.5 to 0.1...they are just paper after all&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I decreased the weights of a couple of the Hearthfire materials such as Glass, Straw, Hinges, Locks, etc.\r<br />\r<br />I have also changed the weights of many more misc items.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4][b][i]Important Information:\r<br />[/i][/b][/size][size=3]See the pictures for examples of the weight changes but remember that far more items have been edited than shown in the pictures.\r<br />\r<br />In the files tab, you will find my mod - simply install it via NMM or drag the .esp into your Data folder. \r<br />\r<br />You can also find a spreadsheet I made showing my changes so you can see all of the before and after weights. If you have edited my mod and want to edit the spreadsheet, you can unlock the sheet by typing the password: IUnderstandThatEditingThisDoesNotChangeTheWeights    because EDITING THE VALUES IN THE SPREADSHEET WILL HAVE NO AFFECT IN GAME.\r<br />\r<br />My mod should be quite low down in your load order so that it will overwrite weight changes made by other mods.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to edit my mod if you disagree with some of my new weights then feel free but please DO NOT RE-UPLOAD as your own.\r<br />I may make a video showing how you can edit my mod and choose your own item weights.\r<br />\r<br />Unfortunately, my mod is not compatible with some of the potion retextures that have their own .esp files such as Potions Replacer from LoversLab and Pretty Animated Potions and Poisons, however it is compatible with retextures with no .esp file such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4259/?]Silly Level of Detail - Potions and Poisons[/url] (mod used in my screenshots) and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62701/?]Rustic Potions[/url]. \r<br />\r<br />Please endorse my file if you find it useful&#33; :)[/size][/font]",
