  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION:\r<br />This is a simple mod I made for myself a while back and decided to finally share it here on the Nexus. This mod adds a gold plated shield to the game under the &#34;STEEL&#34; smiting category once the &#34;Advanced Armors&#34; smithing perk has been unlocked. The shield can be enchanted or upgraded, there is also a version that can be found in the main burial chamber in Bleak Falls Burrow (if that is the version that was installed). The shield that can be found in Bleak Falls Burrow has an enchantment on it that can be learned but not used (at the moment) so beware. The enchantment grants the vanilla &#34;Imperial luck&#34; effect when the shield is equipped, it also adds 50% increased protection when blocking, and a ward spell that protects the user for up to 30 points of magic damage (sorry to anyone who was hoping for  some kind of God blessed over powered enchantment).\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />Just drag and drop into your Skyrim folder and merge folders when prompted.\r<br />\r<br />CREDIT:\r<br />I&#39;d like to thank Bathesda for the textures and meshes used in making this mod.. also for Skyrim, and Creation Kit.\r<br />\r<br />PERMISSION:\r<br />If you would like to use this shield in a mod, all that I ask is that you give credit where credit is due.",
