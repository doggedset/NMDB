  "descriptionHtml": "NO DLC REQUIRED\r<br />\r<br />Nabil Oran is a werewolf. Woof. Don&#39;t get into a fist fight with him.\r<br />\r<br />Perks: Savage Strike, Devastating Blow, Unhindered, Conditioning, Elemental Protection, Deadly Bash, Muffle, Dual Flurry\r<br />\r<br />Special Abilities: Werewolf, Disease Immunity, Increased unarmed damage\r<br />\r<br />Combat Style: Wreckless\r<br />\r<br />Strengths: One handed, Two Handed, Block, and sneak\r<br />\r<br />Lesser Attributes: Heavy armor, light armor, and archery\r<br />_________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Nabil&#39;s werewolf affliction means that he is wreckless when engaged in melee combat. He usually takes as much damage as he receives, which would spell death for anyone without the curse of the werewolf. As such, Nabil is the only follower I have made so far who can dual wield. His ranged game suffers as a result, but few can match the amount of hurt he can lay down in but a few seconds.\r<br />\r<br />Set as essential, can be disabled if you want; Perhaps he got himself into trouble even he cannot get out of.\r<br />\r<br />Max Level = 81\r<br />\r<br />Found in Dead Man&#39;s Drink Inn in Falkreath.\r<br />__________________________________________________\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />\r<br />Simply drag the contents of this folder into your Skyrim Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />__________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Thanks for downloading&#33;\r<br />The Idea is to wolf his wolf before he wolfs your wolf, cuz if he wolfs your wolf first, well ... your wolf is wolfed. Wolf woof woof.",
