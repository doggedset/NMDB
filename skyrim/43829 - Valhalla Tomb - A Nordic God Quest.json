  "descriptionHtml": "[center]This file is OBSOLETE!!!! I have created a mod that was what I original visioned this one to be!! These mods can NOT be used at the same time, so I HIGHLY suggest you get the new one!!\r\n\r\nLink To Asgard: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/44421//?\r\n[/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://img824.imageshack.us/img824/3316/89z7.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][i]The Ancient Gods. The Forgotten Gods. \r\nThey are in Skyrim. Deep under the cold, frozen ground. Waiting for any foolish enough to challenge them.[/i][/Center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/1078/1kyb.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nLong ago, in the first Era there were divine beings who walked the lands of Nirn. They called themselves gods. They had amazing strength and power, like none had ever seen. These gods searched for a dark evil that they believed would destroy everything in existence; Nirn and beyond. They found this great power, and imprisoned it deep under the ground of skyrim. The gods remained with the evil beast attempting to keep it imprisoned in its tomb. Over time, these gods were completely forgotten.\r\n\r\nDelve into a small dungeon on a quest, fight and kill gods, locate the evil they were imprisoning and stop it from devouring the entire universe!\r\n\r\nTo start the quest, speak to Bjorn Ironside in the Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar. He has traveled from the island of Thule to find a hero that will save the world from impending doom!\r\n\r\nI\\\\\\'ve done my best to make this quest possible for any level character, but I highly suggest you are level 30+ before attempting this quest.\r\n\r\nThe loot is grade A. If you don\\\\\\'t like \\\\\\'super loot\\\\\\' just don\\\\\\'t take the gold from the final chest, or any of the armors. The loot chests for the gods are currently empty. I haven\\\\\\'t decided what to put in them yet, but after I decide on loot fit for a god, I will fill their personal chests with amazing loots.\r\n\r\nOdins weapon is a bit over-powered. That\\\\\\'s okay. It\\\\\\'s the weapon of a god. Freyja\\\\\\'s armor is female only, sorry guys. Thor\\\\\\'s armor is male only. and I\\\\\\'m not sure about Odin\\\\\\'s armor, however I THINK it is male only. However, it\\\\\\'s worth a pretty penny, so if you\\\\\\'re a female character, just sell it!\r\n\r\nThis is my first ever dungeon mod AND my first ever quest mod! I\\\\\\'m not 100% sure if it is follower friendly, but I THINK it should be. I have a tester that is going to try the mod soon and give me feedback on all that kind of stuff. So I will update with appropriate information soon!\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/2217/tguw.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nApachii Hair IS required. All of the bosses use this as a masterfile. I\\\\\\'m not sure what will happen without Apachii installed. It may just switch their hairs with vanilla hair, or it might crash your game. So, try it without apachii if you, or be safe and just get it. All up to you!\r\n\r\nSkyrim.esm\r\nUpdate.esm\r\nApachiiHair.esm\r\nApachiiHairMale.esm\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/1770/d22p.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nNone yet!\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://img191.imageshack.us/img191/4158/npfs.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nThe gods for inspiring this mod!\r\nBethesda for Skyrim & the Creation Kit.\r\nOmesean for creating Odin\\\\\\'s Beard. He also helped me A LOT through creating this mod, and is testing it for me as well!\r\nHothtrooper44 for Odin\\\\\\'s Armor.
