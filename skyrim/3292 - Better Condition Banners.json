  "descriptionHtml": "Something i found unusual was that the banners in major cities and towns were ripped, if they were just dirty yes. But in places like Solitude, Windhelm and Markath it struck me as odd that they would display ripped and tattered banners. So I quickly just cleaned up the alpha channels so that they aren\\'t ripped e.t.c, just dirty. \r\n\r\nIf there is enough interest I may redraw & retexture the banners and offer clean, dirty, dirty & ripped e.t.c versions. \r\n\r\nAs for installation, the folders are set up so that you should just be able to extract straight into the skyrim folder",
