  "summary": "A mod that adds the keys to the kingdoms from the series by Garth Nix. *Started but not finished*",
  "descriptionHtml": "I have just started, and have not finished or tested please be patient with me.\r\n\r\nAs of now it will add all seven keys, but when I\\'m done I plan to include the trustees, the will, nithlings, and possibly some other objects and magics. If you have not read this series I highly recommend it. If you would like some information you can find general information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keys_to_the_Kingdom. This is my first mod, and is in progress please give criticism accordingly. It is not officially lore friendly. If you have some suggestions comment on the thread and I will respond.",
