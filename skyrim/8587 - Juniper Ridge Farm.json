  "descriptionHtml": "Updates - \r\n\r\n3/22/2012\r\n\r\nThe Skyrim 1.5 patch seemed to fix or improve the infamous Navmesh Bug but in doing so, it caused some problems with edited or new navmeshes added by mods. I took that opportunity to completely redo the navmesh inside the house. Followers are now able to enter and move about the house normally. It has also been tested with the Spouses Can Live Everywhere mod so you can now use them together to move your spouse into Juniper Ridge. The only thing odd thing I\\'ve noticed is that when they are at the alchemy station, they seem to float while using it. Don\\'t know what that\\'s all about. Oh, and I also changed the single to a double bed, moved the knapsack, chest, and strongbox that was in the sleeping area, and completely took out the endtable. If you\\'re updating to 1.3 please remember to remove all your items from the containers before switching over. The new esp\\'s name is jrfarm13.esp. You can simply delete whatever previous esp file you were using for this mod. \r\n\r\n2/20/12\r\n\r\nDue to popular demand, I have added a covered shed area with all the smithing stations, except for the smelter, in it. There\\'s also a few barrels and sack for storage in there. \r\n\r\nAlso new is Jed, your guard dog. He has no dialogue options so you can\\'t have him for a follower. He keeps watch over the yard and will attack any aggressor that comes close enough. After combat, he will return to his spot in the yard to continue patrolling. He\\'s essential so he can\\'t be killed. He will appear as any other default dog in the game so if you\\'re using a texture replacer for them in your game, he\\'ll look like them. \r\n\r\nA few minor changes around the exterior include... changed land texture under crops to an all dirt texture, moved the well and back juniper tree to accommodate the new shed, added a water and food bowl for Jed next to the house. \r\n\r\n2/10/12\r\nEdited the knapsack at the end of the bed to keep it from respawning and tinkered with the navmesh. Your followers should now be able to exit the farmhouse when you do. \r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nMy first housing mod for Skyrim is Juniper Ridge, a small farm southwest of Whiterun. The  house actually replaces the ruined farmhouse that was right on the road between the Western Watchtower and Ft. Greymoor. \r\n\r\nIt\\'s a small place with nothing fancy at all. I\\'ve tried to give it plenty of storage. The crates in this house are also able to be used for storage. All containers start out empty and do not respawn. There are enchanting and alchemy tables. There\\'s also a shrine to Julianos, for blessings and disease curing. Outside, there are two chickens with nests and eggs, a goat, a small garden, and a beehive that contains two bees and two honeycombs. It should respawn. There\\'s also a chopping block with an ax for your wood cutting pleasure. FYI, I did not include any smithing stations at all since Whiterun is just over the hill. \r\n\r\nKnown Conflicts: \r\n\r\nThis mod is not compatible with Valve\\'s Portal 2 Space Core mod. The crashes right where this house now stands. I have no plans at this time to fix that. I love this house where it is and I don\\'t want to change that. I have no objection if someone else wants to do it and rerelease it. \r\n\r\nInstallion: \r\n\r\nJust drag and drop the jrfarm.esp into your Skyrim Data folder and make sure it\\'s checked on your next startup. There\\'s a visible map marker to travel to immediately. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n",
