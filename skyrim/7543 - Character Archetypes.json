  "descriptionHtml": "---Description---\r\n\r\nThese mods will give you a head start in the game to say. For the people that think it\\'s odd that you start off weak barely knowing any skills. I mean like in your 30\\'s-40\\'s when you start the game right? Anyways use these simple archetypes to craft a well skilled starter character right from the get go.\r\n\r\nWill add more later. If people are interested in the idea of using these.\r\n\r\n---Archetypes---\r\n\r\nWarrior:\r\nThis will level you up to 10 and level up your One-Handed, Block, Archery, and Light armor. \r\n\r\nAlso it will give you the perks within each skill that you are able to get with your level; without using the perk points that you obtain leveling up to 10.\r\nThis mean you will have about 9 perks to distribute to other skills right from the start.\r\n\r\n---How to use---\r\n\r\nSimply put the text file in your Skyrim folder( The same folder that the data folder is located). \r\nMake a new character and once you get your hands are unbound type bat \\\"File name\\\" in the console. (Example: \\\"bat Warrior\\\") This will level you up to 10 and give you basic warrior skills and perks.\r\n\r\n",
