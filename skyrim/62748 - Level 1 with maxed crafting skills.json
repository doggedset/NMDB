  "summary": "Clean Vanilla save with no mods.\r<br />This save is for a level 1 Nord Male located in Dragonsreach in Whiterun.\r<br />Character can be altered by opening up the console using the &#39;~&#39; key and typing in &#39;showracemenu&#39; without the quotations.\r<br />",
  "descriptionHtml": "Saved game files can be placed into your Skyrim Saved Games folder.\r<br />Typically by default this folder can be found at C:&#92;Users&#92;User&#92;Documents&#92;My games&#92;Skyrim&#92;Saves.\r<br />\r<br />Features:\r<br />\r<br />- Several early quests completed including escaping from Helgen, killing your first dragon and discovering you&#39;re dragonborn, becoming thane of Whiterun, and visiting the greybeards. You also own the fully furnished version of Breezehome in Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />- Level 1 with no distributed stat points or perks. \r<br />- Will hit level 37 once you distribute all stat points.\r<br />- Has max level 100 in smithing, alchemy, enchanting, and speech.\r<br />- Has all perk points for the aforementioned skills which were obtained using console commands. (Optional files available without perks)\r<br />- Has discovered all Enchantments.\r<br />- Has discovered all alchemical effects from all ingredients.\r<br />- 2 sets of pre-enchanted gear, one for boosting created potions by approx. 245%, and one for boosting smithing improvements by approx. 245%. \r<br />These sets can be found in the character&#39;s inventory and only need to be used if desired. If you find using the full set is too OP then perhaps only using 1 or 2 pieces will better suit your needs. A pair of Notched Pickaxes are also included on the character to further boost smithing improvements.\r<br />- Optional files available with all dragon shouts unlocked.\r<br />\r<br />I created this character as the perfect starting ground for me to reroll characters for different playthroughs. \r<br />This save is great for allowing you to begin a game and create all your desired armor with desired enchants.\r<br />Having maxed alchemy and all effects discovered is perfect for creating any potion or poison you could want.\r<br />Having maxed Speech not only allows for better prices, but will also open up more dialogue options for you during your playthroughs.\r<br />\r<br />And because this save is fully Vanilla and clean of any mod it is also the perfect clean slate for mod testing. \r<br />\r<br />There is a bit of a mess in Farengar&#39;s room in Dragonsreach as well as Farengar&#39;s inventory. Sorry about that. \r<br />\r<br />Thank you and enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />**IMPORTANT**\r<br />For those of you who don&#39;t know here is a video on how to change your race and appearance in game without resetting your skills.\r<br />Open console using &#39;~&#39; key. Type &#34;player.setrace&#34; without quotations and followed by your chosen race e.g. orc. Next type in &#34;showracemenu&#34; without quotations in order to alter your appearance. Do not change your race within the race menu otherwise your skills will reset.\r<br />[youtube]GpOVp0H59nQ[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />There are four available saved files to download:\r<br />\r<br />1. Maxed Smithing, Alchemy, Enchanting, and Speech with ALL respective perks and NO dragon shouts unlocked.\r<br />2. Maxed Smithing, Alchemy, Enchanting, and Speech with ALL respective perks and ALL dragon shouts unlocked.\r<br />3. Maxed Smithing, Alchemy, Enchanting, and Speech with NO perks and NO dragon shouts unlocked.\r<br />4. Maxed Smithing, Alchemy, Enchanting, and Speech with NO perks and ALL dragon shouts unlocked.\r<br />\r<br />I appreciate any feedback regarding issues or uses you may find.",
