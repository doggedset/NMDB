  "descriptionHtml": "I noticed that there was like: 5 robes that weren&#39;t obtainable in the game. There was no visible issue with the robes (that isn&#39;t a problem with other clothing in the game) so I decided to add them to the outfit list for monks. I didn&#39;t just give every priest some random robe, though. For example: you&#39;ll find Talos worshippers tend to wear green robes, Mara and Dibella wear brown robes, and Kynareth and Zenthiar worshippers wear grey robes, and worshippers of Akatosh will wear red robes. This doesn&#39;t work with any other mod that has a monk wearing the default monk robes. It won&#39;t break your mod, it just won&#39;t make them wear the different colored robes. This can easily be fixed in the CK.",
