  "descriptionHtml": "Mod on Steam:\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=104493413&searchtext=\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a big fan of mods that add places like blackmarsh, valenwood, morrowind, elsweyr and other places. But I have only seen a few actually be completed. This mod will eventually be more comperhensive than similar mods, because it doesn\\'t just make a new landmass, but new faction , npcs, a new map(I have only seen a summerset isle mod make one), new world objects and new items.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUPDATE 0.02\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAdded a map marker for the shrine and changed when it said \\\"Portal to Aquilas\\\" in Aquilas to \\\"Portal to riverwood.\\\"\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUPDATE 0.03\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAdded 5 houses with doors, but doors lead to nowhere at the moment. I have also added  a guard\\'s barracks and this is on the opposite end of the map.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUPDATE 0.04\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAdded a road connecting main road with barracks and houses. Added second doors to houses that needed 2 doors. Also added the Jarl of Sedik, Brendella. (I think I might keep it as a Jarl, although Jarl\\'s are supposed to be just for Skyrim.) She has a female Dunmer voice, but the quest I put in didn\\'t seem to work. I will fix that soon... I added a bit of navmesh, but I didn\\'t navmesh where the portal is, just the barracks, so don\\'t bring in followers yet.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUPDATE 0.05\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAdded 4 forges and \\\"The blacksmith\\'s Dream\\\", which is just the skyforge. Also added \\\"The smiling elf tavern\\\", which is just the bannered mare. I now people have been saying that I should make my own everything, but I don\\'t know how to make new static world objects or new armour textures, then implement them into the creation kit. So I reaaly would apreciate help, or somone with a link to a tut. Added dialogue options with the Jarl of Sedik, but she will not give you a quest until later updates.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUPDATE 0.06\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAdded about 3/4 of the navmesh in Sedik. Just have to brush up on it then it will be done. Added an orc blacksmith called Odene.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUPDATE 0.07\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOdene now works at the forge. Added \\\"Bow of Sedik\\\" which is the bow Brendella talks about. However, THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE QUEST. SHE DOESN\\'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YO HAVE THE BOW. PLEASE HELP!!!!\r\n\r\nAdded 2 trees as well as and anvil, a grinder and a workbench. But they aren\\'t usable at the moment. Added a heap of archery targets and practice dummies.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUPDATE 0.08\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWarning! Massive update alert!\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n--World Objects:--\r\n----------------------\r\nMake bow of sedik stronger, made anvil, grinder and workbenches usable and added 2 tanning racks.  Added a lovely mossy/fern walkway. Added a massive mountain that has no apparent use at the moment. Cornered of training area with spikes and moved dummies. Added 3 khajiit tents and a fountain. Also added 2 more houses, along with another tree and 2 bushes. Added an arch leadin up to the barracks. Placed in a throne for the jarl. Added a big market(empty at the moment).\r\n------------\r\n--NPC\\'S:--\r\n------------\r\nBlacksmiths:\r\n\r\nThe Mysterious Blacksmith\r\nBlacksmith Trok\r\nBlacksmith Oera\r\nBlacksmith Ailda\r\n\r\nGuards:\r\n\r\nSedik Guard Breer\r\nSedik Guard Lorz\r\nSedik Guard Vork\r\nSedik Guard Ashl\r\n\r\nKhajiit:\r\n\r\nKhajiit tradesman X6 (3 Male and 3 Female)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt the moment I have building from whiterun. I am really bad at textures, so can someone please volunteer their expertise in making building textures. Please!!!!\r\n\r\nI have barely just started, the main reason I have put this up now is because I cannot do this project on my own, I need:\r\n\r\nLOD Designers\r\nCustom item and world object designers\r\nA custom map maker(the one in the menu, not the acyual world).\r\n\r\nThese are the cities. Every city has a guild or faction inhabiting it.\r\n\r\nThe cities are:\r\n\r\nSpearmalk-Imperial\r\n\r\nMetdrip-Mercenaries Guild\r\n\r\nAdwede-Farmers Guild\r\n\r\nSedik-Blacksmiths Guild\r\n\r\nGustern- A stromcloack type faction\r\n\r\nBlacktime-Blades\r\n\r\nLahrans-Traders Guild\r\n\r\nCulrib-Thieves Guild\r\n\r\nIdvine-A companion type guild\r\n\r\nBiglapse-Bards College\r\n\r\nFallwood-A forsworn type group\r\n\r\nTaldrog-Mining guild\r\n\r\nColdrune-The Aldmeri Dominion\r\n\r\nIcewall-A mage college\r\n\r\nDarkmoor-Dark Brotherhood\r\n\r\nOnce again, please please please join this modding team as I cannot do this alone!
