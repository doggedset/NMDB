  "descriptionHtml": "The Mod is divided across multiple esps making it fairly modular.  You can use them as a whole or individually, your choice.  As of 1.0 both the Destruction and Illusion scaling perks are added automatically using the quest system.  You should receive a quest complete notification for both when you first install them.  There should be no issues if you&#39;re upgrading from an old version and thus already has the perks by using my console instructions, you can ignore the quest notification.\r<br />\r<br />Lastly I have a development thread going which can be [url=http://thenexusforums.com/index.php?showtopic=501798]here[/url] or by clicking the discussion tab and going down to Ocyris Skyrim Tweaks - Development.
