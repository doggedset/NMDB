  "descriptionHtml": "The first time I played the game, I was disappointed that Jon Battleborn didn\\'t really do anything.  He was always hanging around in front of Belathor\\'s as if he was waiting for something, but all he ever did was give you a little bit of info about Whiterun, and that was it.\r\n\r\nWell, now he does a bit more.... :)  This mod:\r\n\r\n- updates his appearance (more to what I thought a bard should look like)\r\n- makes him a follower\r\n- makes him essential\r\n- was sure someone would ask for it if I didn\\'t, so I also made him marryable\r\n\r\nInstallation :\r\n- put the .esp and .bsa in your data folder, then start the game\r\n- some people still get discoloured heads for some reason.  If you do, also extract the meshes/textures folders to your data folder too - that might fix it.\r\n\r\nRemoval : \r\n- take any loot that he\\'s carrying\r\n- dismiss him as a follower\r\n- save your game\r\n- exit the game\r\n- remove the .esp and .bsa.  (If you installed the textures/meshes, then also delete /data/textures/actors/character/facegendata/facetint/skyrim.esm/00013bb1.dds and data/meshes/actors/character/facegendata/facegeom/skyrim.esm/00013bb1.nif)\r\n\r\nRequirements : \r\n- Apachii Sky hair packs",
