  "descriptionHtml": "Choose between 4 colors; Lead, Fern, Bluebell or Chocolate. \r<br />\r<br />Itâ€™s not technically a retexture, because in the case of plaques the color is not (mainly) determined by the texture map but by vertex colors which are properties of the mesh.\r<br />Vertex colors can be edited in nifskope, but the process is tedious. Yes, this is what I have done.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\r<br />Extract archive. Choose one of the color folders, paste the contents (i.e. the &#34;meshes&#34; subfolder) into your Skyrim Data folder. \r<br />\r<br />To uninstall, simply remove the [i]wrplaque01.nif[/i] mesh that this mod adds.\r<br />\r<br />[i]This mod currently does [/i]not [i]change the color of the combined weapons-and-shield plaque.[/i]",
