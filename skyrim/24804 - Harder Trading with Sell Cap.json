  "summary": "Fixes Skyrim\\'s inflation and easy money from loot, by introducing a hard sell cap.\r\nThis helps increase quest significance and decrease senseless hoarding.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Noticed gold loses significance the more you progress into the game, how they roll in thousands even early on ? \r\nNever understood how loot always pays more than the quest it\\'s associated with ?\r\nThen you\\'ve come to the right place.\r\n\r\n[b]Changes[/b]\r\nThis mod attempts to fix the inflation by capping sales to a given lower amount.\r\nThis decreases loot value and hoarding, you will find yourself selling every unused item in your inventory.\r\nIt also increases significance of quests/jobs, since before loot was the primary income.\r\nFinally it is more immersive, since skyrim in the middle of a civil war, therefore prices should reflect hard economy with heavy taxes.\r\n\r\n[b]Install[/b]\r\nRecommended to Install using nexus mod manager.\r\nThis mod is obviously not compatible with mods that change sell fBarterSellmax (sell cap)\r\n\r\n[b]Help me decide which ratio to use ![/b]\r\n[[b]4x[/b]] - mostly fine with vanilla values, but just want to reduce the prices a bit and cap them. \r\n[i](recommended for more casual players)[/i]\r\n[[b]6x[/b]] - want to halve the sell rates from vanilla, and want money to be truly challenging but not frustrating, most players will choose this value. \r\n[i](works well with 2-3x slower leveling mods)[/i]\r\n[[b]10x[/b]] - full-on hardcore player, want to devalue loot & crafting and play skyrim more like a simulator. \r\n[i](works well with 4-5x slower leveling mods.)[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]How is this different from mods that alter bartering ratios ?[/b]\r\nThe problem with just changing barter ratios, is that it effects buy/sell together.\r\nEssentially this just makes inflation worse, and also breaks the rest of the game. (e.g. quest rewards, legitimate treasure)\r\nTherefore only way to truly fix this is to cap sell at a lower value.\r\n\r\n[b]Doesn\\'t this break speech ?[/b]\r\nNo, speechcraft perks still effect buy/sell prices, in fact it only makes those perks more significant.\r\n\r\n[b]Other recommendations for balanced economy[/b]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24758]Increased Bounty/Guild Rewards[/url] - increases job rewards based on level/difficulty & optionally reduce fedex quest rewards.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25143]Expensive Transports[/url] - I use this with the option to multiply services by 10x.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14476]Expanded Apothecary Inventory[/url] - increased amount of potions/ingrediants without touching rare ones, this is great money sink.",
