  "modName": "Megumin hat WIP - DELETED",
  "summary": "This is a texture replacer. I can't get the hat to show up with hair so this is more like a resource, less of a mod",
  "descriptionHtml": "The original mod is found here. you do not need it, however.\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11767\n<br />\n<br />Edit: I think I realized my problem. I don't use body mods, like UNP or CBBE. just my preference. the original mod uses UNP. I guess I will take the plunge and see if that makes a difference. SECOND EDIT: No. that did not work. I use the mod \"cloth them bodies\" which covers everyone in potato sacs, so a body mod is useless to me. but no, that did not do the trick.\n<br />\n<br />this mod has no screenshots because I consider it a failure at the moment. you see, the hat is supposedly set as a circlet, so that it wont clip with hair. except it just removes the hair altogether. Now, this is possibly because I am using the Hepsy hair CC mod, but all it means to me is I can't use it as intended so its just a resource. However, I thought maybe someone could tell me what the issue is and maybe we can get a fixed version.Â \n<br />\n<br />Now then, the original mod author says the mod can be used openly, so the mesh and texture files as well as Esp are all present. this mod is essentially standalone. I wish to credit the author Backsteppo for making it. Normally I would just include the texture, but because I am looking for help in fixing the hair issue, I thought it a better idea to include the whole thing. Please let me know if that is out of line.\n<br />\n<br />So, please mod authors, help me make this madness complete and bring wonderful explosions to all the good little boys and girls...\n<br />\n<br />I will also point out that this is in no way the intended final texture. I plan to do a \"Megumin when she got older\" themed outfit mixing a variety of pieces. but without the hat this project is dead.",
