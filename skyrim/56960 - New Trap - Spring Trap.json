  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\r<br />[youtube]cDdrzCf-9kw[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I am officially done with spells, this took 7.5 hours and half of that was debugging and trying to make it fire silent, it doesn&#39;t, it fires really really quiet but seems no matter what I do the game fires a detection event on spellcast NO MATTER WHAT\r<br />So first off, as usual, video\r<br />[youtube]7PORoAARyKU[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />And as usual Discworld trailers\r<br />[youtube]FEBNe8XINd0[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]aPzA_6RBWcg[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Mod adds a new recipe at any forge to craft the spring trap\r<br />Something likeÂ \r<br />2 Pies\r<br />6 Iron Ingots\r<br />4 Dwarven Ingots\r<br />1 Sweet Roll\r<br />2 Fire Salts\r<br />1 Common soul gem\r<br />3 Firewood\r<br />\r<br />Once crafted you learn the placement spell automatically\r<br />Only one trap should be placed at a time, it does consume reagents upon placement, so think carefully\r<br />The trap will draw in a random person in range who is NOT in combat and is NOT in a follower faction\r<br />Once the person snatches the goodies the trap will spring and magic will happen\r<br />\r<br />Sometimes the bodies get stuck in living animations when dead, probably something to do with knocking them around like crazy\r<br />You can cast the spell at people and the box will drop but the trap takes 3 seconds to arm so if they move oh well\r<br />People can get through it before it triggers sometimes\r<br />You can lure people in combat into it by being on one side, any actor who walks in the center of it will trigger it, friend or foe\r<br />YOU CAN TRIGGER IT YOURSELF TO, Perks will not help you\r<br />\r<br />So far I have seeneverything but a mammoth and dragon go in the trap so giggidy",
