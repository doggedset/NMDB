  "summary": "This is a mod im working on, its not even close to done. I suggest not downloading until i finish.",
  "descriptionHtml": "For the person in the comments asking what this mod might eventually turn out to be:\r<br />I&#39;m going for a quest/dungeon mod that can either end up in a completed quest, with loot and such, or a follower. Considering on the choices that you make and the actions that you do to others, you will get one outcome or the other. Right now I&#39;m building the dungeon itself, working on combat attributes, different enemies, patrols, etc. Things I have completed is the physical follower (Samantha Rhode) but, I want to eventually get her custom voice acted, because I hate the vanilla insults, war cries, jokes, etc. So its a really ambitious mod, especially it being my first. So I hope this answers any questions. Thanks for the comments everyone.",
