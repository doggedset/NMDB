  "descriptionHtml": "I am not good at English, sorry.\r<br />\r<br />This is a joke mod to have helmets in right hand. At first, You need to find Skull Mace near the Guardian Stones. He wants you to put your helmets on his head. The better helmets be put him, The stronger he is. He has SwingSpeed:1.0, Weight:7+helmet&#39;s Weight, and Damege:5+half of helmet&#39;s ArmorRate.\r<br />\r<br /> He can be tempered and be converted to Skull Mace. Cautions, Helmets will be lost, but Jagged Crown, Yngol&#39;s Helmet and Clavicus&#39;s Mask will not be lost. Perhaps, he wore Replica Helmets//",
