  "descriptionHtml": "Updated: \r\nChangelog 1.3 \r\nTweaked the overall lightning inside to be in contrast with the fireplace which is now active in order to brighten the room a bit and added a cooking pot for convenience.\r\n\r\nChangelog 1.2 \r\nFixed the sconces in the basement not behaving as intended. Torches can now be added and removed from them which allows the lightning in the room to be changed dynamically.\r\n\r\nChangelog 1.1 \r\nAdded a map marker that can be fast travelled to once discovered and a basement interior featuring an enchanting and alchemy table along with shelf full of ingredients and 2 weapon racks. \r\n\r\nDescription: \r\nPilgrim\\'s Rest is a small lore friendly house located in the southwestern part of the Rift. It is an ongoing work-in-progress project I have dedicated myself to and plan on fleshing out further by adding an interesting questline to go along with it. I have most of it planned out already and just need to integrate it into the mod. (I\\'ve left some hints for what it will be about) \r\n\r\nRequirements: \r\nSkyrim 1.9 \r\n\r\nKnown Issues/Incompatibilities: \r\nNo known issues are present right now. Feel free to inform me in the comment section below if something comes up that needs to be fixed. \r\n\r\nAuthor Notes: \r\nLooking for people who have a fair amount of experience in moderate scripting to help me implement the questline. \r\n\r\nFor those of you who prefer the darker version of the hall shown in the screenshots you can still get that by downloading the older version 1.2 of the mod from the nexus. I\\'ll be supporting both versions if there are some people that decide to stay with that. :)\r\n\r\nSteam Workshop version  - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=142582676",
