It&#39;s in the barrel where you find potions, complete with a quest marker to make it easy. The spell tomes will be in the Court Wizards&#39; merchant inventories, and random loot, as they&#39;re added to the leveled lists. \r<br />\r<br />The outfit is for females only, but should fit any race. Select the hair during character creation.",
