  "descriptionHtml": "The Potadagger™\r<br />**SAVE BEFORE DOWNLOADING**\r<br />So I saw some mods put up for the sole purpose of being really useless and found that kind of hilarious and wanted to get in on the fun. I spent a few seconds shoving the potato and iron dagger mesh together to make… This and I’m pretty content with how completely pointless it is. I’m serious about the pointless part. Just kind of have fun with it&#33; Or not… There is nothing really stopping you. \r<br />It is crafted by shoving a potato and an iron dagger into a forge... Not sure why you would need a forge to shove a potato on a knife but you do...\r<br />Also, have a free advertisement:\r<br />\r<br />Have you ever thought of shoving a potato on a dagger and using it as a weapon? OF COURSE NOT&#33; Why would you? It’s a terrible idea. But now that I have implanted the thought into your mind I bet you can’t wait to get your hands on one can you? Well, for the modest price of 499.99 you can have your very own Potadagger™&#33; \r<br />(Warning:do not actually purchase Potatdagger™.
