  "descriptionHtml": "DAWNGUARD IS REQUIRED..............\r\n\r\nHere\\'s my second mod, a weapons mod. It\\'s a standalone retex of Auriels bow with some added UMPH. The arrows and bow can be crafted at any forge with the right ingredients and the bow can be enchanted. The arrows are really what make this bow in my opinion. They have a nice faint blue glow during flight (try in darkened area), the nord battle cry on impact and being from the God of Archery himself they have very little gravity pull and slightly faster flight time, as well as a pretty good punch.\r\n\r\nInstall with NMM or extract files into the skyrim data directory.\r\n\r\nCrafting:\r\n   Bow\r\n       Forge >> Iron >> Apollo\\'s Bow\r\n   Arrows\r\n       Forge >> Misc >> Apollo\\'s Arrows\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to leave comments and any advice you may have towards this mod.\r\n\r\nEnjoy",
