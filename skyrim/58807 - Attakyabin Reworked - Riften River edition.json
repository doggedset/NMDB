  "descriptionHtml": "[b]This is an update to my first ever house mod, when criticizing please keep that I am new to this in mind.\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Sorry for my english.\r<br />\r<br />No DLCs are required&#33; ApachiiSkyHair is only required if you care about the body at the back of the house having hair, but you should get it anyway, it is a good mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds one new house located in The Rift, it is fully navmeshed, features crafting stations (In the basement), named storages, and a bed, it is a simple starter house with plenty of custom models, nothing too fancy, it is fairly small cozy home, the style it uses fits in with the lore a fair amount, I find the location unique enough, what more could you possibly want?\r<br />\r<br />And the answer to that is likely naked women BUT I will not add those.\r<br />\r<br />That is all, I would like feedback, feel free to request new things.",
