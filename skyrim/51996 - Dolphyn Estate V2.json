  "descriptionHtml": "Dolphyn Estate v2.0\r<br />(by Remcoz ©2014)\r<br />A player-home mod for The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />Hihoo everyone :-)\r<br />\r<br />First of all , thanks for stopping by to have a look at this modest creation .\r<br />This is the 1st mod (2nd version though) I release , so I hope you&#39;ll be tolerant ;-)\r<br />Initially started in Oblivion , Dolphyn Estate was meant to be (and still is&#33;)\r<br />my personal home , arranged to fit my gameplay (geographical preferences , esthetics ,\r<br />practical storage etc...)\r<br />When Skyrim came out , I kinda let Oblivion aside , but wanted to bring\r<br />Dolphyn Estate into it .\r<br />After numerous hours of hard work ... Here is what suits me (well , allmost 99% ^^)\r<br />Wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d release it , and thought :\r<br />&#34;What the heck , after all ...It&#39;s always instructive to get feedback on a creation , no ?\r<br />And maybe some of you will like & use it :-) &#33;&#34;\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s not a &#34;Cheater-House&#34; , so don&#39;t expect to find any\r<br />objects/items/treasure in there (except a couple of hanging ingredients) :-)\r<br />I didn&#39;t &#34;over-decorate&#34; it either , (I kinda like &#34;sobriety&#34;)\r<br />so up to you to fill it with your personal style .\r<br />But I like to have my storage confortable & well-organized , so I created for\r<br />nearly each container unique Forms and/or ID&#39;s , named to match each &#34;zone&#34;\r<br />(Bedroom dresser ... Basement barrel ... Magic weapon chest ...Office safe ...and so on &#33;...)\r<br />All of them are empty and never respawn .\r<br />\r<br />Last little thing ...\r<br />I&#39;m a &#34;sunday-modder&#34; and very busy in real-life , so I&#39;m not planning to\r<br />make regular updates/evolutions for the time being .\r<br />\r<br />For info , the screenshots are Vanilla , with only official DLC&#39;s (including Hires texture DLC) .\r<br />Only thing added is Post Process Injector 2.1 with some settings that suit me :-)\r<br />\r<br />So ... you&#39;ll find :\r<br />- All the crafting equipment you may need in the basement .\r<br />- Magic crafting tables in the attic .\r<br />- Cooking equipment in the kitchen .\r<br />- Plenty of &#34;logical & zone-renamed&#34; storage/containers .\r<br />- Sober but subtle decoration .\r<br />- Cozy atmosphere in a nice environment .\r<br />- Stable for you horse\r<br />\r<br />Also ...:\r<br />- Geographically well-settled\r<br />- Once discovered , it will have a map-marker & can be fast-traveled to .\r<br />- All ownerships (furniture,containers,doors,crafting equipment & bookshelves) are set to Player .\r<br />\r<br />What you will NOT find :\r<br />- Mannequins & Display cases\r<br />- Patrol path for companions\r<br />- Bookshelves (This saddens me , but having recurrent unsolved issues with bookshelves , I decided to let it aside ) \r<br />(for the story , when I create a good working (tested ingame) 10-bookshelf , if I duplicate it 1à3 times , I have 3x10-books that work well . But if I duplicate one of them a 4th time , that one will work well , but each of the others suddenly show up a capacity 11 , or 13 , or 16 books . Posted a couple of times about it on Nexus in the last 2 years without much reactions solutions .... so I gave up on this :-(  )\r<br />\r<br />Requirements :\r<br />-Skyrim.esm\r<br />-Update.esm\r<br />\r<br />Installation :\r<br />Simply drop &#34;Dolphyn_Estate.esp&#34; into your Data folder and\r<br />check in Skyrim-launcher/data files that it is ticked .\r<br />\r<br />In case you use the outdated Dolphyn Manor v1 , just overwrite it (it&#39;s the same filename for v1 & v2)\r<br />Just remember to empty all your containers from V1 and save your game , before replacing \r<br />the ESP & re-dispatching your goods in v2...)\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation :\r<br />Simply remove/delete &#34;Dolphyn_Estate.esp&#34; from your Data folder .\r<br />\r<br />Bugs and (in)compatibility :\r<br />None (as far I know) .\r<br />But any other mod affecting that same exterior\r<br />area/cell MAY cause unexpected weirdnesses &#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod may not be modified without my permission .\r<br />I don&#39;t mean to be rude here , but a little email or private message\r<br />(explaining what you wanna do) doesn&#39;t cost much , no ?\r<br />And I&#39;m not totally &#34;hermetical&#34; ^^\r<br />Thanks .\r<br />This being said , I thank you for reading :-)\r<br />Enjoy your stay @ Dolphyn Estate ;-)\r<br />\r<br />Remcoz\r<br />\r<br />Contact :\r<br />Send me a private message @ my nexus-forum-profile :\r<br />http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/798374-remcoz/\r<br />\r<br />©Remcoz 2014 .
