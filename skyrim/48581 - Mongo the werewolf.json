  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome, I love to introduce you to Mongo the Werewolf. He&#39;s a very nice person and he thinks he is a female khajiit. If you&#39;re looking for another creature to be your follower, just contact me or write a comment&#33; :)\r<br />This is my first little mod and I&#39;m just discovering the world of a modder. I know its simple, but i think its a lot of fun having a werewolf as a companion with you on your adventure. He is a little bit bigger than a normal werewolf and he is quite Strong. \r<br />\r<br />He&#39;s waiting for you at the entrance of Whiterun where you can ask him to be your companion.\r<br />I&#39;m working on this mod and i think i&#39;m adding a Quest linked to him. For advices and questions just contact me on Skyrimnexus. I have always an ear for advices.",
