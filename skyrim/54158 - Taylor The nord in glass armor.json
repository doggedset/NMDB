  "descriptionHtml": "Adds an essential Nord follower that can be married, into the game. She is in the Riverwood Sleeping Giant inn and she scales from level 4 to 61 with you.\r<br />\r<br />Taylor is a Nord, She had a normal family like any other Nord until her family was taken captive by the Thalmor and executed. Luckily Taylor was in Solitude at the time or she too would have perished.\r<br />Taylor gathered nord volunteers and friends that offered to join and attacked a Thalmor patrol. Killing two high ranking Thalmor officers and six Thalmor soldiers. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Known bugs:\r<br />The only bug I know of is where her armor automatically changes to Daedric after leaving the Sleeping giant inn. This could be a problem on my side only, but if anyone else has this problem please let me know.",
