Angi has more amenities like an alchemy lab, anvil,\r<br />grindstone and wood chopping block.\r<br />[list]\r<br />\t[*] More idles markers placed around her home, Angi will do more.\r<br />\t[*] Tweaked dialogue that had restrictive conditions, and added some phrases. Result is Angi has some extra dialogue.\r<br />\t[*] Angi now has a schedule to sleep, eat and practice her archery. Added food to her table so her AI lunch package will activate.\r<br />\t[*] Turned her weapon racks into functional weapon racks. She won&#39;t accidentally knock down her bow anymore&#33;\r<br />\t[*] Gave Angi some perks so that she is a formidable foe should you choose to kill her.\r<br />\t[*] You can get Angi&#39;s bow by killing her if you don&#39;t want to finish her lessons.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />There are archery skill level requirements before you can move on to the next lesson.\r<br />  1st lesson: None\r<br />  2nd lesson: 25\r<br />  3rd Lesson: 40\r<br />  4th Lesson: 60\r<br />\r<br />\tAfter the first lesson, you can practice archery in freestyle mode&#33; To start, ask Angi to use her targets for individual practice. Go down to the practice area. Shoot the targets.\r<br />It will make your archery skill better, I promise.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Angis&#39; Camp&#34; is incompatible with anything that edits:\r<br />\t- The quest dunArcherQST\r<br />\t- The cells AngisCampExteriorCell and Wilderness (-6, 26)\r<br />\t- Angi&#39;s archery targets\r<br />\t- The NPC Angi\r<br />        - Angi&#39;s original sandbox package\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#B4CCCC][size=6]Installation[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />[color=#5E5E5E]_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[/color]\r<br />\r<br />This can be installed mid-save, given the following:\r<br />* Character is currently NOT located at Angi&#39;s Camp&#33;\r<br />* You have NOT started training with her&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\t1) Use a mod manager for ease of use.\r<br />\t\t\tOR\r<br />\t1) Manual installation, drop the contents of the zipped file into your Skyrim Directory, replacing the &#34;Data&#34; folder if asked.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\t2) Activate &#34;Angi&#39;s Camp.esp&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#B4CCCC][size=5][u]Updating[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />First, get into a different cell.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s recommended that you use a new save, but most likely you are fine just replacing the file if the update is a small increment, for example 1.0.0 to 1.0.1.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#B4CCCC][size=6]Uninstallation[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />[color=#5E5E5E]_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\tMake sure your character is no where near Angi&#39;s Camp&#33;\r<br />\tGuaranteed to break the quest if you already started it.
