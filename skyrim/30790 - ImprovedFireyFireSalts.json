I think this was kind of requested...... kinda, so i was kind enough to go ahead and make this wonderful mod! NOW FINALLY a mod that makes fire salts look like it was spilled from the guts of a fire atronatch firey enough to light your favorite brand of cigarette, and probably used as a condiment fit for a daedric prince, FIRESALTS looks almost pretty to look at. (sue me for my spelling.)\r\n\r\n[size=4] INSTALLATION [/size]\r\n\r\nNow.... how to install.....\r\n\r\n1. you already probably know how to install mods, so really this should be the only step you read.\r\n2. If you have trouble installing, try uninstalling skyrim and purchase the console version of your choice.\r\n3. Once installed, \\\"fire\\\" up Skyrim and franticly look for some firesalts.\r\n4. If in inventory, drop, and spend the next 15 minutes trying to set it right side up, realizing how difficult it REALLY IS!\r\n5. Ogle at its nifty flame effect as if it were the first time you saw fire.\r\n6. Come back to my mod page and endorse!\r\n7. Well, I couldn\\'t think of a good 7th step.... so there you have it!\r\n\r\nENJOY!",
