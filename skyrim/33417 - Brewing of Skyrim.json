  "summary": "This mod takes all the meads and wines in the game and adds them into the cooking pot for crafting. It also adds many custom beverages into the merchants and crafting system. Leave me any suggestion on what I should add into the next update! oh, and by the way, YOU CAN MAKE SKOOMA!",
  "descriptionHtml": "Love alcohol, love immersion, poorly written descriptions, or lust looking to download mods? Then you have come to the right place good sir. This mod takes almost all of the alcohol in the game and makes it craftable at the cooking pot with recipes realistic to real life. It also adds several generic alcoholic beverages into the game, both to some vendors and to crafting. The drinks added by me are as follows: \r\n\r\nCaptain Cruel-Sea (Captain Morgan Rum) \r\n\r\nAbsolut Mead (Absolut Vodka) \r\n\r\nBud (light) \r\n\r\nMiller (light) \r\n\r\nCorona (light) \r\n\r\nWhiskey \r\n\r\nBudwiser (yes, it\\'s purposefully spelled that way) \r\n\r\noh, and by the way, YOU CAN MAKE SKOOMA!\r\n\r\nInstallation: Get the .esp into your data folder, either through NMM or manually dragging it.\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s planned in the next update: \r\n\r\nMore brands and further shop integration \r\n\r\nIf you want to suggest anything for this mod or leave me ideas be sure to do so!
