  "descriptionHtml": "The hagraven. You\\'ve seen their wretched faces far too many times, but as I played through the witches quest, I thought, what if these ladies were a little more twisted? Wheres the garrish color, the wild eyes, the bloodied claws? Sure, the hagraven are scary, but they appear to be long from their glory days. This is my idea of a hagraven at full power. Blood red hair, bloodier hands, and wild bestial eyes. It isn\\'t perfect, but I think it works. I\\'ve included the original, as well as a working alterate version and an improved version. The improved version has better eyes, but it stil isn\\'t perfect by any means. Expect an update, but for now enjoy the horror that is the hagraven in her prime. ",
