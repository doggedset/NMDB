  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]   We made hot files&#33;[/u][/b] I honestly wasn&#39;t expecting that. I just want to say thank you to everyone that supported or helped with this mod.\r<br />\r<br />   ...it feels so weird seeing my mod up there...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[i]   Edit[/i]: Sorry to those who downloaded this mod and didn&#39;t know where to put the meshes. I accidentally didn&#39;t put /magic at the end of folder list. Again, sorry about that.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />   \r<br />   [i]Some more edits to yet another edit[/i]: The download works fine with NMM now.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />   Here&#39;s a video of it in action from Skyrim Mod Spotlight.\r<br />[youtube]qLIQQTGDPbI[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />   Added a standalone version, as requested by [i][b]ShiftyJ[/b][/i]. The spelltomes are added to the leveled lists, so they shouldn&#39;t be that hard to find. If you can&#39;t find them, or don&#39;t want to bother trying to find them, just open the console. Type: help &#34;Deadly Ice Spike&#34;. There should be only one thing listed. The mass of letters and numbers beside it is the ID. Type: player.addspell (whatever the ID is). Do the same with Deadly Icy Spear, but type &#34;Deadly Icy Spear&#34; instead of &#34;Deadly Ice Spike&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />   The ID of these two spells, like anything, will change depending on the load order; otherwise I would just tell you the IDs.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />   Am I the only one that hated the original game&#39;s ice models? I think so, as I cannot find a single replacer for them. So I decided to make my own.\r<br />The Ice Magic Hand Effect is basically just has less glowy crap in it. Ice Spike, Again, less glowy crap. But it is also much thinner. It actually looks like a spike. OMG. Ice Spear is Ice spike but longer.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />   These were originally just personal models, but I just decided &#34;screw it&#34; and threw them on Nexus.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />   This is compatible with anything that doesn&#39;t replace the models for these spells. Texture replacements are fine though.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />   I&#39;m sure everyone that is going to download this knows how to install it, but still. Unzip the folder and drop the files into progamfiles/steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data/meshes/magic. The &#34;programfiles&#34; folder might be &#34;programfiles(86)&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you enjoy this mod, please endorse it. It helps me know how many people actually like this mod. And it&#39;s a bit of a motivator for me to make more mods.",
