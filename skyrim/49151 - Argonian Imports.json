  "descriptionHtml": "This mod add four new weapons (concept, models and textures made by Artiedee) to the crafting menu of the forge.\r<br />These are the weapons names:\r<br />- Obsidian Warhammer\r<br />- Bone Talon Dagger\r<br />- Silver Jagged Katana\r<br />- Steel Great Cleaver\r<br />\r<br />For now they are only craftable and improvable, but i&#39;ve planned, in a future update, to add them to the leveled lists and to a new argonian merchant that i want make in the Windhelm docks (i&#39;m learning how to do that).\r<br />This is my first released mod, hope all is correct...\r<br />\r<br />Big thanks to Ghosu, Frankdema, Prometheus_TS, Cabal120 and Vioxsis for various useful tips about texturing, NifSkope and CK use;\r<br />Big thanks also to Bethesda, for obvious motifs, and the Nexus for this great site :D\r<br />\r<br />Merry Christmas, guys.\r<br />\r<br />P.S. The Bone Talon Dagger has a scabbard, but isn&#39;t shown in game; i hope that someone can say me why it don&#39;t work...",
