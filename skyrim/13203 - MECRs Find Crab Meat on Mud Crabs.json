  "descriptionHtml": "MECR\\'s Find Crab Meat on Mud Crabs\r\n\r\nA mod for TES V - Skyrim\r\n\r\nCurrent version: V. 0.50\r\nCompatible with: Skyrim 1.4.27.0.4 (not tested with older versions)\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this Mod\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nJust a quick fix I made. You are now able to collect Crab Meat from Mud Crabs, like in Oblivion.\r\n\r\nRaw Crab Meat is a food item that restores 1 Health point.\r\n\r\nMeshes and textures are from the vanilla game: tweaked versions of Giant Pestle and Raw Salmon.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion History - what this mod does so far (V. 0.50)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n---------------------------\r\nV. 0.50 (Initial release)\r\n---------------------------\r\nAdds Raw Crab Meat, a food item.\r\nAlters the Mud Crab Death Item accordingly.\r\nWhile I was at it, I also removed the Minor Loot Leveled Item. No more rings on Mud Crabs.\r\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nMesh and texture are crappy to say the least. I will fix them once I\\'m better with modeling and texturing. I know it doesn\\'t resemble RL Crab meat very well! Please don\\'t comment about it as I\\'m already aware of that issue.\r\nThe mesh has a collision box that is too large. The item doesn\\'t behave as expected when dropped to the floor. I will take another look into this. \r\n\r\nIncompabilities\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nProbably any other mod that adds something to the Mud Crab Death Item List. Also, if you have a hunger & thirst mod installed, Crab Meat will not work with the scripts of that mod (i.e. you can\\'t get sated by eating it).\r\n\r\nInstallation & Uninstallation\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nUse the Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n\r\nPlans for the future\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nAdding recipes so that you actually can cook some meals with Crab Meat.\r\nAdding an optional version of this mod, where Crab Meat is an ingredient.\r\nMaking my mod compatible with Total Realism - Basic Needs and Real Wildlife (or adding optional patches that do so).\r\n\r\nAbout bugfixing and updating\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nPlease post any bugs or ideas in the comment section. As with any other mod, this is not guaranteed to work with whatever setup you have. Always make a back-up savegame before you activate any mods. \r\nI\\'ve a full-time job. Playing and modding Skyrim is only one of my hobbies. I can\\'t say how regularly I will update this. There will be times when I\\'m not able to answer to comments or personal messages in a timely manner. Please understand and respect that.\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nPermission for translation: Granted, as long as you credit me and your upload contains the original readme and a link to the original file. Please send me a message, so that I might know what\\'s happening with my mod.\r\n\r\nPermission for adapting and reusing this mod\\'s contents: Please ask for my permission. Not getting an answer counts as NO permission.\r\n\r\nYou are under NO circumstances allowed to upload this mod, any of your mods based on this mod or any mod translations to any other site than the Skyrim Nexus or the TES Alliance, especially not to Steam.\r\n\r\nYou are under NO circumstances allowed to ask for, demand or accept any kind of donation for this mod, any of your mods based on this mod or any mod translations.",
