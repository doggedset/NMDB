  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'ve always wondered why Elven Light Armor wasn\\'t craftable - The shoulderless version of the armor always looked better to me for some reason. It was also weaker...\r\n\r\nHence i added recipes and made it craftable, without perks. It\\'s a *tiny* bit better than leather armor, but still way below \\\"full\\\" elven armor. It also requires 1 refined moonstone per piece to create, so i guess it will remain a mostly cosmetic option for most characters. Still thinking about removing the moonstone requirement, though what would make it elven then?\r\n\r\nThe recipes are the same as normal Elven Armor, except for only needing 1 refined moonstone, but 1 more leather and/or iron ore. This should keep it somewhat balanced despite it not needing any perks to create.",
