  "descriptionHtml": "Okay, so i wanted to add a new sword to the game but didn\\'t want to just put it in the crafting list.\r\n\r\nI made a little dungeon just north of riverwood called the Shadow Lair.\r\nIt\\'s map marked straight off so no wandering round searching.\r\nInside you\\'ll come across a dead body and reading his note starts \\'The Brothers\\' quest and grants you access to the rest of the dungeon. \r\nIt\\'s very small but tells a little story.\r\n\r\nIt may be part of a larger quest later but for now there are some other things i would like to do.\r\nThis sword was made by request from cashyyy so kudos should be shared his way.\r\n\r\nBasically i just followed the tutorials on the creation kit site to start but done some neat things with scripts (now there\\'s a headache).\r\n\r\nInstall to your Data folder or use NMM.\r\nUn-install, remove ShadowLair esp/bsa from your data folder or use NMM.\r\n\r\nCredits to the original artists for my inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
