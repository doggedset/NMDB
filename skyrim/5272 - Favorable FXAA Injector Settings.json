  "descriptionHtml": "[color=Yellow]Favorable FXAA Injector Settings[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=Cyan][size=2]I appreciate all the feedback I get, please leave a comment so I know what you think & If you like what you see please endorse to show your appreciation, thankyou.[/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=Yellow][size=3]What is this?[/size][/color]\r\nWhat I\\'ve done is created my own version of the FXAA Injector settings that better suit my game play, I wanted darker nights where you can still see but would be advised to use a torch, but I didn\\'t want those bright days that usually go along with dark nights I wanted it to look cold & miserable. I feel that with this the lights look warmer & more usefull. I understand that this isn\\'t for everybody but that odd few who like the same type of colours in their games as me, I hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\nIf you find it too dark, open up the FXAA_Tool & then change the Gamma to your liking.\r\n\r\nIn creating this I had FPS in mind, I\\'ve had literally no FPS drops what so ever. please tell me if your results differ. \r\n\r\nThis [color=Red]won\\'t[/color] work with FXAA [color=Red]1.3[/color] only [color=Green]2.1[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=Yellow][size=2]Installation[/size][/color]\r\nDrop the contents into your Skyrim directory NOT your data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=Red][size=2]INCOMPATABILITIES[/size][/color]\r\nIf you use any other FXAA settings with mine then it\\'s doubtfull it would work.\r\n\r\n[color=Red]NOTICE - If you\\'ve already got a [/color] [color=Yellow]injFX_Shaders[/color][color=Red] folder in your directory delete it, as if merged with my mod the results could differ & cause instabilities.[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n",
