  "descriptionHtml": "Hi Nexus\r\n\r\nSince I started to play Skyrim, I fell in love with the Wolf Armor, Companions and the everything about them. But, I think that Bethesda forgot about this armor. It looks awful. I searched and tried to find a darker retexture, to fit more with the wolf stuff. Found some but it didn\\'t satisfied me at all.\r\n\r\nSo, reaper9111 and I were talking about it and he made this retexture. The armor now is darker, with black fur and still keeping the details and this old appearence the armor have.\r\n\r\nTo Install: Open main folder after extracting/opening, Drop \\\"Data\\\" folder into Skyrim main folder,  allow folders to merge and done it. Or use NMM. \r\n\r\nIt should not have any conflict. \r\n\r\nPlease, endorse if you like and enjoy.\r\n\r\nThanks for reaper9111 for this retexture and for the time spent to do it.\r\n\r\nI\\'m looking for a pro modder to make a standalone wolf armor with this texture.  =(",
