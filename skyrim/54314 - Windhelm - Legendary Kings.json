  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]EnZE3UOHeOw[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Visiting Windhelm for the first time, I loved the feel of it. Except for the carved stone panels near the palace. They just seemed rather underwhelming - these are supposed to be memorials for historic kings about whom legends have arisen and songs are sung, in a culture that values ornament and craftsmanship: so plain stone slabs that look like they were engraved by an automated cutter felt a bit off, for me at least.\r<br />\r<br />So I changed them.\r<br />\r<br />Should be compatible with anything that doesn&#39;t change textures &#34;whkings.dds&#34; and whkings_n.dds&#34; in the data/textures/architecture/windhelm folder. They sadly get that snow shader on them which can obscure some of the detail. But I like them :) If you don&#39;t, simply delete those files. Make sure you do the appropriate changes to Archive Invalidation, of course.\r<br />\r<br />Images are taken from the Gundestrup Cauldron.",
