  "descriptionHtml": "********NOTICE********\r<br />[size=4]Thanks to the generosity of Caput770, work on this mod is underway despite my lack of a computer. Everyone give him a big thank you in the comments tab for me, because without him we wouldn&#39;t yet have Jaggarsfeld or Canal Home patches out&#33;\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[u][size=5]RE - Real Estate Patch Collection[/size][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=4]Introduction[/size][/u]\r<br />[size=3]I&#39;m making these patches because I enjoy sitting in front of a computer screen for long periods of time mucking about in the creation kit. I&#39;m weird like that. However, given that I have a busy life that doesn&#39;t revolve around mucking about in the creation kit (sadly), I cannot devote as much time to this endeavor as I would like. Please understand this and don&#39;t expect me to be pumping these things out on a daily basis. Next to each planned patch I&#39;ve placed the priority. This is the general order I expect to be making these in and isn&#39;t a hard-set value. In general, player home mods take a VERY small amount of time, as it just requires me to copy/paste a Landlord&#39;s Safe into the home; on the other hand Dragonborn will take a very significant amount of time because I have to place each sign individually and configure the scripts to recognize it. Due to this aspect of varying time, don&#39;t be surprised if one day I decide to upload a patch for a lower priority mod. Don&#39;t take this as a sign that I&#39;ve dropped my plans for Dragonborn, I&#39;m just taking a small (roughly 10 minute) break from it.\r<br />\r<br />I decided to make patches for Sjel Blad Castle and Jaggarsfeld because I&#39;ve used both mods and I very much enjoyed them. If you are planning on requesting a patch for a player home, go right ahead by PM-ing either myself (TangoDrango) or Caput770. If you leave your request in the comments tab I can&#39;t guarantee I&#39;ll ever see it, let alone complete it.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Safes in Homes - COMPLETE[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />Not much to say here really. Due to size issues I&#39;ve only placed safes in 4 out of the 5 homes, but honestly if you&#39;re confined to Breezehome you probably aren&#39;t running much of a real estate empire&#33; Proudspire manor, Honeyside, Hjerim, and Vlindrel Hall all contain Landlord safes.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=4]Hearthfire Patch - COMPLETE\r<br />[/size][/b][/u]Available for download.  Adds safes to Windstad Manor, Lakeview Manor, and Heljarchen Hall.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4][u]Thief Player Home in Riften Canal Patch - COMPLETE\r<br />[/u][/size][/b]Special thanks to CAPUT770 for making this patch&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Jaggarsfeld Patch[b][size=4][u] - COMPLETE[/u][/size][/b]\r<br />[/b][/u][/size]Available for download.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Sjel Blad Castle Patch[b][size=4][u] - COMPLETE[/u][/size][/b]\r<br />[/b][/u][/size]Available for download.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Dragonborn Patch - PRIORITY: 1\r<br />[/b][/u][/size]I&#39;m getting there. It&#39;s more time consuming than you&#39;d expect. Also, don&#39;t expect to be able to buy the Skaal village, their fear of outsiders means that it ain&#39;t gonna happen.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Other Home Mods - PRIORITY: 4\r<br />[/b][/u][/size]Ask and you shall receive. I do requests on my own agenda, and they have the lowest priority. I&#39;m sorry if that bothers you, but If you can&#39;t wait for it then ask me or Caput777 how to do it yourself. It&#39;s pretty dang easy.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=4]Falskaar Patch - PRIORITY: 0\r<br />[/size][/b][/u]No offense to the author, but I didn&#39;t enjoy that mod as much as some others, so it didn&#39;t&#39; make the cut into my current mod list. It is an amazing mod, and given enough requests I *might consider* doing a patch, but, seeing as I don&#39;t expect to use it myself, it probably won&#39;t be done. Sorry, but Dragonborn adds one small village and it&#39;s taking enough time already. I really don&#39;t want to spend a month making an esp I&#39;ll never even use.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Supported Home Mods:\r<br />[/b][/u][/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41612/?]Sjel Blad Castle[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38392/?]Jaggarsfeld[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53541/?]Thief player home in Riften Canal[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]SHAMELESS SELF ADVERTISING&#33;[/size]\r<br />[size=3]Check out my other mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61936/?]here[/url]&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]Special thanks to:[/u][/size]\r<br />[b]M3t4lxxx[/b] for making the RE - Real Estate mod for Skyrim\r<br />[b]Caput770[/b] - For taking up the torch and pumping out patches while I was computer-less&#33; What a guy&#33;\r<br />[b]Bethesda[/b] - for making the three best video games of all time (NON-DISPUTABLE): Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\r<br />[b]My Mother[/b] - for birthing me and being a kick-ass Mom&#33;",
