  "descriptionHtml": "     Adds a small farmhouse with all your storage and crafting needs just east of Rorikstead. It\\'s supposed to be where our character may have lived before they Skyrim, visiting the other provinces (assuming it\\'s a Nord character; it\\'s usable by anyone however).\r\n\r\n     It includes a farmhouse and a shack with an arcane enchanter, alchemy station, forge, smelter, grinding stone, workbench, and tanning rack.\r\n\r\n     There is also a nonrespawning wardrobe and chest for storage of your various things.\r\n\r\n     Fast travel is available at game start. Again, it is just east of Rorikstead, far west of Riverwood. \r\n\r\n     Cool fact: there is a dragon nearby that may attack you if you\\'ve made progress in the main quest line. There are markers to allow him to land on the roof of the farmhouse.\r\n\r\n     Thanks for looking into my mod! I hope you like it.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n     ~Versions~\r\n     \r\n     1.0.1: Fixed the clipping issue with the forge water trough and added the workbench.\r\n          Known Issues:\r\n               -Possible FPS issue outside the house.\r\n               -Possible issue with NPC\\'s getting indoors.
