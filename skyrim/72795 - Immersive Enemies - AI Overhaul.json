Specifically, this plugin deeply overhauls the AI used by NPC citizens when they are in a “standard state” and in a “combat state”. The “alert state” is left untouched. To explain, an NPC is in a “standard state” when he/she is unaware of an aggressor, a “combat state” when he/she has detected an aggressor, and an “alert state” when he/she is aware of an aggressor that cannot be located.\r<br />The complete description is available [url=http://nextgen-ai.com/immersive-citizens-ai-overhaul-se/]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://nextgen-ai.com/immersive-citizens-ai-overhaul-se/][center][img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2840/32961801630_21bbb1b577_b.jpg[/img][/center][/url]\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]7EgWWuWJ7pw[/youtube]      [youtube]9VmY3jdO6Kw[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://s4.postimg.org/46hyladgt/Credits.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Author: Arnaud d&#39;Orchymont.\r<br />JawZ for the first FOMOD installer.\r<br />Kudix for the banners.\r<br />Bethesda for the Creation Kit & The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\r<br />The SkyUI Team for SkyUI which allowed me to implement a configuration menu.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
