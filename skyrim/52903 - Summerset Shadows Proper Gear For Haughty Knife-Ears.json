  "summary": "Adds some pizazz to the Summerset Shadows gear rather than having them wear identical gear to their rivals, the Thieves Guild. What kind of rivals are they if they love their clothes so much?",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds some pizzaz to the gear the members of the Summerset Shadows wear while trying to smash your brain in even though they&#39;re meant to be thieves. \r<br />\r<br />It came about because I always thought that a guild staffed by the most arrogant beings in the existence of Mundus, Nirn and Tamriel would never stoop to wearing Thieves Guild &#39;rags&#39;. So instead they now wear impossibly impractical clothes for sneaking. Because High Elves prefer to let their superiority be known to all. \r<br />\r<br />I give this a thumbs up. I think what this guy made was pretty cool.",
