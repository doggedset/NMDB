  "modName": "Reaper Set",
  "summary": "The Deadliest Addition to Tamriel",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a whole new tier of armor and weapons into the game, each with crafting and tempering recipes.\r<br />\r<br />Due to the complex nature of the crafting requirements and the materials needed, I have included a full list of the items in the Read Me file contained within. Please consult that should you find yourself worrying about why you can&#39;t see the crafting recipes. Due to the length of the list, it won&#39;t be shown here.\r<br />\r<br />Weapons and armor (if you&#39;re eligible to craft it) will come up under the Daedric section, the ring and amulet under Jewellery.\r<br />\r<br />The pictures displayed are of all the items in this mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Check out this much appreciated video made by [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/TheYoudojo]YouDojo[/url] to help show off the mod:\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnpRC5b6wUA]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnpRC5b6wUA[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Note: People stating the obvious and or complaining about my use of modified default textures will be ignored. I&#39;m not good with textural works and don&#39;t understand meshing yet. I&#39;m programming orientated.\r<br />\r<br />Note: Before anyone asks about the inconsistencies in the graphics, yes I have been working on this a while and yes I did take the pictures at different times of day and phases of development.\r<br />\r<br />If you have any other questions, feel free to leave a comment. I&#39;ll find it eventually.",
