This is more based on the later adventure books, &#39;Fighting Fantasy&#39; ring a bell?\r<br />These had really great and simple rules, yet they really packed a punch, and you felt them good&#33;\r<br />Lol, i think you can download some of these in digital format now :)\r<br />\r<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r<br />\r<br />-- Lvl up \r<br />1st Roll\r<br />(4-6) &gt;&gt; upgrade any skill tree you choose\r<br />(1-3) &gt;&gt; can only upgrade a lesser skill tree\r<br />\r<br />2nd Roll\r<br />(4-6) &gt;&gt; choose between health, stamina or magic\r<br />(1-3) &gt;&gt; use one with lowest number\r<br />\r<br />-- Leaving City\r<br />(4-6) &gt;&gt; you choose destination\r<br />(1-3) &gt;&gt; re-roll dice\r<br />this number is the direction to a city you must travel\r<br />pick the city furthest away\r<br />use your own discretion\r<br />1 - NW, 2 - N, 3 - NE, 4 - E, 5 -SE, 6 - SW\r<br />\r<br />-- Selling Items (roll per trader)\r<br />(4-6) &gt;&gt; Trade as much as you desire\r<br />(1-3) &gt;&gt; Buy 1 item and/or Sell 1 item\r<br />\r<br />-- Looting Corpses\r<br />(4-6) &gt;&gt; Loot as many corpses as you please\r<br />(1-3) &gt;&gt; Choose only one corpse to loot\r<br />\r<br />-- Player Death\r<br />(4-6) &gt;&gt; you choose a weapon/armor to discard\r<br />(1-3) &gt;&gt; re-roll dice \r<br />this number is how many items you must discard\r<br />only weapons and armor can be discarded\r<br />and one weapon/armor must be a worn item\r<br />\r<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r<br />\r<br />Of course these variables can be suited to your needs, it can be easily extended to magic and thievery systems alike\r<br />\r<br />Let me know what you think, your feedback is welcome :)\r<br />\r<br />(Tip: only one dice is needed, but i recommend using two different color dice if you can. At times only one dice roll is need, at other two, but fact is that two dice just roll better together)",
