  "summary": "turns the PATHETIC vanilla winterhold into a real respectable city. (mod not complete but stable)",
  "descriptionHtml": "are you tired of going to the famed ancient city of winter hold just to see a few shacks. were you disappointed by the lack of change added by other winter hold overhauls. well then this mod is for you&#33; winter holds glory offers a large expansion of the worst city in sky rim turning it into a respectable and unique city with plenty of buildings to explore and new if not properly scripted npcs. however this mod if far from complete. while most interiors are enter able i have not yet nav meshed nor have i decorated most of them besides the basic furniture. the exterior is near complete with just polishing needing done and the npcs are far from complete. however this mod should run smoothly and will not conflict with any mods except those that alter the city of winter hold itself. please do report any incompatibility with other mods so i may address them when i continue working on this project. other then that enjoy and please do provide any input positive or negative.",
