  "descriptionHtml": "Archibald has managed to get his physical form back into Skyrim at your call. Learn his call and he will come to your aid\r<br />during battles for a duration of fifteen minutes. He is stronger than a normal wolf and slightly bigger. If he dies, you can\r<br />simply summon him again. [color=#00ff00][size=4]The spell tome and letter can be found in the Hall of the Dead in Whiterun,[/size][/color] next to the bench just inside\r<br />the door. It should be set to player ownership, so no having to steal this one. He is a higher leveled summon, so he is [size=2]labeled[/size] as expert,\r<br />but only takes about a 100 magicka.\r<br />\r<br />Note: He can fast travel with you, but he cannot follow you through loading screens, such as going through a door. The base texture is a contrast-enhanced red wolf texture, but I drew the gore and blue.\r<br />\r<br />Warning: this character does contain gore, can make a gore-less version if wanted.",
