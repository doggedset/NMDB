  "summary": "A fixed and complete English translation for ECE and ECEE.",
  "descriptionHtml": "There are three mods that all contain varying translations for Enhanced Character Edit: ECE itself, ECE Enhancer, and XP32 Maximum Skeleton Extended and no matter in which order I've put them in Mod Organizer there were always sliders or buttons that had their label missing. So I created this English translation that contains all string properties of all the three mods combined in one, permuted to contain no doubles, and fixed the translation of several strings to proper English.\n<br />\n<br />Place this mod after any of the mentioned three mods you have installed and it will solve those obnoxious missing strings in ECE once and for all.\n<br />\n<br />Requirements:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12951]ECE - Enhanced Character Edit[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Recommended:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35713/]ECEE - RANs Enhanced Character Edit Enhancer[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68000]XP32 Maximum Skeleton Extended[/url]\n<br />[url=https://github.com/LePresidente/modorganizer/releases]Mod Organizer\n<br />\n<br />[/url](For now only contains English translation file).",
