This set of configuration files have been carefully designed to give you a leading edge in both appearance and performance. Think of this as the Lamborghini of configuration files. Wait until they see your screen shots&#33;\r<br />\r<br />   I am a bit of a pioneer.I tried settings  that were purely experimental , while some of them were even forbidden. Call it luck, or call it Genius, but it has been working well for several months, with incredible results. Now maybe it&#39;s just my imagination playing tricks on me, but I changed my SkyrimPrefs.ini from  &#34;EWI&#39;s High Prefs&#34; setting of &#34;1024&#34; for  iShadowMapResolutionSecondary to a number I made up by multiplying it by 2, and I did this about 10 days ago. And I changed iShadowMapResolutionPrimary from 2048 to 8192. And I did this for a few settings. And now Geforce is using these same numbers on their webpage: [url=http://alturl.com/umt58] http://alturl.com/umt58[/url]   Coincidence?   Perhaps...\r<br />        \r<br />\r<br />   I have spent weeks testing different setting in these configuration files, and I think they are good enough now to share with the world. Try them and if you don&#39;t mind, upload your image of the results here. We would Love to see them&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#F0DE18][center]So far, the USER SCREENSHOTS look awesome&#33;[/center][/color]   \r<br />\r<br />I am flattered that all of you have made two of my files become featured HOT FILES ..... at the same time&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />   Credit goes to EWI and his INI files which I have made many adjustments on, and provided them here. Although similar, they are not the same. What might seem like a good change to add enhancements may result in an equal, or greater, loss in performance. So I spent many hours trying to conjure the right combinations for the best results. And I think I have done it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />   My settings are a bit high in some spots, so if you have an older PC, put on it&#39;s crash helmet before starting. Good Luck My Adventurous friend&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*** [color=#ffff00][b]NEW OPTIONS[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />   I&#39;ve done it again. I wanted to push the limits of the configuration envelope even further&#33;   I&#39;ve made some changes in ways I have never done before. After testing various settings, I was able to achieve the right balance of performance and appearance. Optimized for sharpshooter&#39;s ENB Users, you will be very pleased with this little package. It&#39;s free, so call it just a gift from me...to you. Just look in the &#34;optional files&#34; box.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />***[color=#ffff00][b] INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION[/b][/color] \r<br />\r<br />(1)\r<br />        Extract the files and place them into your Skyrim configuration folder:\r<br />        C:&#92;Users&#92;MYNAME&#92;Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />(2)    Optional:  under [DISPLAY], in the SKYRIM.INI, you can change the video card to the name your computer recognizes, by going to[size=4]  \r<br />      sD3DDevice=[/size]  and adding the name of your video card. Go to windows RUN, in the start button, and type DXDIAG. Then go to display\r<br />        and get the name of your card.  But so far no one has said it affected anything.\r<br />\r<br />(3)    I don&#39;t know if it will affect your game, but you can change this value if it does: In the skyrim.ini file, you can change the number under \r<br />       the [HAVOC] section from 8 to however many &#34;cores&#34; your computer processor uses. I am not an expert at this, but if it works, it works.\r<br />\r<br />(4)   I wasn&#39;t satisfied with the normal ugriduGridsToLoad, because I wanted more detail, so I took a chance and raised it to 7, and I was very\r<br />      impressed. But I must say, this setting is not for everyone. If you experience a crash, open the skyrim.ini, and change uGridsToLoad=7   to   \r<br />      uGridsToLoad=5.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />   Be sure to grab my other files, if you want to truly make your Game Awesome&#33;\r<br />   [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59286/?][b]JW&#39;s High Quality ENB Preset[/b][/url]\r<br />    [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59253/?][b]SKYRIM ENB GUIDE[/b][/url]\r<br />\r<br />***   Here&#39;s another file that will help you get more Frame Per Second:  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59305/?][b]SKYRIM PERFORMANCE BOOSTER[/b][/url]  \r<br />      (OVER 18,000 downloads and 340 Endorsements in 4 Days.)  [color=#ffff00][b]ANOTHER FEATURED HOT FILE&#33;[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />***[color=#ffff00][b]  [/b][/color][color=#ffff00][b]REVIEWS[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />     [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/1201691-sprag80/]sprag80 wrote:[/url]            \r<br />[size=6][size=4]{ [/size]&#34;[/size]Ms. Watson, thank you so much for sharing your excellent config file. Since I added your file, my heavily modded Skyrim has run like silk with\r<br /> nary a crash or freeze. I very much appreciate the time and effort you \r<br />devoted to this task on top of your considerable talents.\r<br />\r<br />Warmest regards,\r<br />\r<br />Jonathan [size=6]&#34;[size=4]}[/size][/size]\r<br />                                \r<br />                  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> [size=4]*** Be sure to save a copy of your current configuration files before moving these to the same folder.[/size]\r<br />       I recommend an even better safeguard, rather than just backing up your INI files: if you have played a few times and experienced problems,\r<br />       start Skyrim up, click the LOAD option as the game begins, and delete any saves that came after the point you began using the new .ini files.\r<br />       To delete a save, place your mouse over the &#34;old save&#34; and press [X] on your keyboard. After doing that, then you can place a copy of your\r<br />       ini files back into your configuration folder  :  C:&#92;Users&#92;mycomputer&#92;Documents&#92;My Games\r<br />\r<br />       From experience, the best way to prevent problems with your Skyrim is to limit the number of mods you use. I use about 70 mods, and I \r<br />       rarely\r<br />       add more. And when I add something, it is usually a clothing or armor set. Adding textures, especially with land or buildings is taking a big \r<br />       risk.\r<br />\r<br />       I really hope this helps you a lot. I will spend another night making it better, if I have to. May it add a whole new dimension to your\r<br />       SKYRIM EXPERIENCE.\r<br />\r<br />      [i]ENJOY&#33;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />   \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />      \r<br />       ",
