  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE: Now with ripped half cloak! Credit goes to Alpha Dragoon for his Torn Scarf variant which I used as the basis for the torn cloak.\r\n This is something people have wanted for a while but I never got to work. I got quite frustrated with it and left it for a while. But I have returned and figured out the rpoblem: I was using Photoshop ELEMENTS which doesn\\'t save Alpha channels properly :/ Thank god for GIMP.\r\nYou\\'ll also find a new file called \\'JoBNormals. Due to the aformentioned problem, I couldn\\'t get normals right either, but now I\\'ve managed them. Sadly, another problem has arisen, and for some reasons you\\'ll find strange black artifacts on the hood and cloak. I\\'ll see if I can sort this in the morning.\r\nNOTICE: Remember to grab my Sword of Aeons Retexture to go alongside this mod!\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1503\r\nOr the Avos Tear retex:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1667\r\n\r\nAfter hours of work, I\\'ve finally got this Jack of Blades retexture into a state I\\'m happy with, so I thought I\\'d share it with all of you.\r\n\r\nSome of you out there may have played the first Fable and as such know exactly who JoB is. For those of you unfortunate enough to have not had the pleasure, Jack of Blades was the main villain and he wore a mask and red robes. And he was amazing. YouTube him :)\r\n\r\nThis texture pack is designed to make the nightingale armour resemble the infamous villain. It\\'s certainly not perfect, but it\\'s as close as you can get with a retexture. In order to complete the look, I decided to switch out the Nightingale gloves and boots with the Daedric variants and retextured them to make them match the main armour.\r\n\r\nYou\\'ll notice there are two files for download. One contains the texture files for the Nightingale hood and armour and the Daedric boots and gauntlets. The other swaps out the usual mesh for the Nightingale gloves and boots with Daedric ones.\r\n\r\nObviously, you can leave the second file and just use genuine Daedric gloves and boots, so don\\'t feel obliged to download the second file.\r\n\r\nI\\'ll update this as I find new things to do with this retexture and please remember to let me know if you have a suggestion or if you just really like it :P\r\nEnjoy!",
