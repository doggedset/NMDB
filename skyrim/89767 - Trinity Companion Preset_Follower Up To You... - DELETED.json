  "summary": "You read the title right. Buggs has CK open and ready for suggestions for a final follower. YOU decide!",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\n<br />[img]http://funkyimg.com/i/2CEe4.gif[/img] [font=Comic Sans MS][color=#ff0000][size=6]This MOD contains NSFW and NON LORE Content such as super skimpy outfits and or poses. If this is NOT for you then please refrain from crying about it in the forums.[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]Time to change the floor plan so to speak. We are allowing YOU the user to pick stats, combat and everything BUT and there is always a but, the facegen of course and or textures and meshes. Really your deciding Trinity's fate in creation kit. Be gentle on her as she has feelings. Maybe a Mage? An assassin? A crappy follower that just runs around boobs bouncing and all dying all the time? Whatever...We will build her...Stronger, faster... \"cue music\".  Mods you need are in pic below and the 12FemaleBrows is from Fair Skin which is what was used to create her. So it's simple, if you want to offer suggestion great! If you think it's a crap mod and want to point out flaws move along. So far she is of the High Elf Race. Some suggestions could be warpaint, tattoo's hair style and or color. Armor and weapons (make sure assets are OK to use or permissions) and post links in forum.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://funkyimg.com/i/2CEex.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://funkyimg.com/i/2CEE1.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=6]CREDITS&gt;[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51602]Fair Skin Complexion by HHarley[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/]KS Hairdos - Renewal by Kalilies[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75674/]Lind's Human Eyes by Lind001[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://eskrimmods.blogspot.com/]Awesome Outfit Resource[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/center]",
