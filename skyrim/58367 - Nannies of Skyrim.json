  "descriptionHtml": "Name:Â  Nannies of Skyrim\r<br />Author Princess Stomper\r<br />Version: V1.0\r<br />Category: NPCs\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Description\r<br />===========\r<br />Small, simple mod that adds a &#39;nanny&#39; to each player-owned house in Skyrim/Hearthfire (not the other DLCs). This is so that I can take e.g. Lydia out questing with me without worrying about who can look after the children.\r<br />\r<br />Some of the nannies are young and beautiful, others are old and wizened. They&#39;re all female - not that I have any doubt that male nannies make excellent carers, but I just wanted it that way in my game. Each of the nannies is &#39;protected&#39; - they can be killed by the player, but not by anyone else, to protect them from bandit invasions.\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t have children in every home (i.e. with a multiple-adoption mod), you can roleplay them as being cleaners or housemaids. They have no conversation, and just a simple sandbox schedule.\r<br />\r<br />Bugs\r<br />====\r<br />Please contact me with any issues\r<br />\r<br />Install\r<br />=======\r<br />1. Extract the files to a temporary location.\r<br />2. Copy files to (install folder)&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;\r<br />",
