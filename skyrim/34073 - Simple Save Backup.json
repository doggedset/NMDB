  "summary": "A very small batch file that facilitates save backup process.",
  "descriptionHtml": "It happens that I mess around with my Skyrim so much that I need to be 100% sure I have my saves backed up. This tool makes save backup process dead simple.\r\n\r\nInstallation consists of 2 steps:\r\n1. Unpack the archive contents on your PC (location is irrelevant).\r\n2. Manually edit the bat file, replacing the text SKYRIMSAVES with your Skyrim savegame folder:\r\n\r\n[b]In case of default Skyrim installation on Vista and Windows 7, the last line in bat file would look like this:[/b]\r\n7z.exe a -x!*.7z -x!*.bak \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\[UserName]\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves\\\\%NAME%\\\" \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\[UserName]\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves\\\\*.*\\\"\r\n\r\n[b]In case of Windows XP:[/b]\r\n7z.exe a -x!*.7z -x!*.bak \\\"C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\[UserName]\\\\My Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves\\\\%NAME%\\\" \\\"C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\[UserName]\\\\My Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves\\\\*.*\\\"\r\n\r\n[u]Of course, also make sure to replace [Username] with your actual user name.[/u]\r\n\r\n[b]Now, every time this file is ran all saves are archived to a file named SaveBackup_currentdate_currenttime.7z.[/b]\r\nBAK files are not archived as it\\'s unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThis utility cannot be simpler but of course I cannot be held responsible if things go awry on your end.\r\n\r\nHappy saving!",
