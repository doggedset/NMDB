Due to this is because obsolete very fast and the only useful piece is whichever one you chose to \\\"improve\\\". This mod simply makes the basic pieces enchantable.\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus this mod will also set all Thieves guild pieces as \\\"VendorNoSale\\\" which means you cannot sell them. This is done so you do not accidentally sell your thieves guild armor because if you do get rid of it you will not be able to fully finish the thieves guild quest storyline.\r\n\r\nInstallation: Simply unrar the esp file into your Skyrim/Data directory and make sure it is checked off in the \\\"Data\\\" section of the Skyrim launcher.",
