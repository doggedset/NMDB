  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=9][color=red]SKYRIM MAIL ARMOR[/color][/size][/b]\r\n\r\nBy VonBarb.\r\n\r\n[b][size=6][color=yellow]What it does :[/color][/size][/b]\r\nSkyrim Mail Armor will add two sets of craftable and upgradeable mail armor for Skyrim in Iron and Steel material, consisting as of version 1.0 of two cuirass variants (Suit, with chainmail on the legs, and Shirt, without mail legs), gloves and boots, for both male and female and available in Light and Heavy versions.\r\n\r\nStats mirror Iron and Steel armor.\r\n\r\n[b]Version 1.1 :[/b] Added \\\"Fine\\\" variant, with upper-tier armor stats, requiring Advanced Armors perk to craft.\r\n\r\n[b][size=6][color=yellow]How to install :[/color][/size][/b]\r\nDrop the contents of the archive you downloaded into you Skyrim/Data folder. When starting the game, click \\\"Data Files\\\" and don\\'t forget to check \\\"VBMailArmors\\\"\r\n\r\n[b][size=6][color=yellow]Where to find in game :[/color][/size][/b]\r\nCraftable at any forge under Iron and Steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=6][color=yellow]Who I\\'d like to thank :[/color][/size][/b]\r\nBethesda of course, The Nexus, and the people who made the CK and Nifskope available to the community, as well as those who took time to post some very useful tutorials on the web about how to get the most out of these tools.\r\n\r\nI\\'d also like to make a special dedication to Pino, and his mod Pino\\'s Light Armours, which you\\'ll find on The Nexus. While none of his files were used in this mod, I still feel like I need to give him credit for the inspiration. This mod started as an expansion to Pino\\'s Light Armours before it evloved into a fully stand-alone modification.\r\n\r\n[b][size=6][color=yellow]What I know is wrong with it :[/color][/size][/b]\r\nAs of version 1.0, the models suffer from some clipping in some instances, and the 1st person view for the female models use the Guards Armour model. The first issue is a necessary evil until I can find a way to solve it, the second is the only way I found around a strange problem where 1st person models didn\\'t show texture sets assigned to them in the CK and transparency.\r\n\r\n[b][size=6][color=yellow]What\\'s coming next :[/color][/size][/b]\r\nI\\'m not done with this project just yet. In future releases I hope to add more materials, including all the stock materials but also new ones like Mithril, as well as faction-themes sets for the Companions, Dark Brotherhood and Thalmor.\r\n\r\nQuite obviously, I\\'m also exploring options to add a helmet to the set. Anyone who thinks he may have an idea how to do that is free to share :D\r\n\r\n[b][size=6][color=yellow]What you may do with this mod :[/color][/size][/b]\r\nDownload it, enjoy it, not enjoy it, endorse it or not, take lots of pictures of your characters wearing the armor and sharing them with us, tell me what you think of it, provide ideas...\r\n\r\nHowever you may not use it or any parts of it in your own mod or post on another site. Translations are OK.\r\n\r\n[b][size=6][color=yellow]Changelog :[/color][/size][/b]\r\n\r\n[b][color=yellow]Hotfix (July 23 2012) : [/color][/b]\r\n-Uploaded hotfix for Shirt model normal map.\r\n\r\n[b][color=yellow]Version 1.1 (July 22 2012) : [/color][/b]\r\n- Fixed invisible forearms on female Khajit.\r\n- Edited lining and belt colour saturation on female Steel textures.\r\n- Added \\\"Fine\\\" upper-tier armor stats version for upper level characters. Requires Advanced Armours perk to craft.",
