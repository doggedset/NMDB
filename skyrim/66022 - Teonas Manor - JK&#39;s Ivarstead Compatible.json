  "descriptionHtml": "[center][u][b][font=Georgia][size=6]Teonas Manor[/size][/font][/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />A medium-sized player home in Ivarstead, designed as an old fort for the previous Thane.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]1.1 UPDATE:[/size][/color] Hearthfire and the Multiple Adoption mod on the Nexus is now compatible&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Ivarstead, like Kynesgrove, was one of those towns that you really didn&#39;t care to revisit after the main questline when heading up the seven-thousand steps. Adding a home, both with vanilla and JK&#39;s version in mind, might hopefully bring some visitors. The manor itself isn&#39;t so outrageous that the Thalmor would pick it out in an instant as the Dragonborn&#39;s manse, but big enough that you don&#39;t feel you need to go into hiding, and secure enough to bring your friends and family into the Rift.\r<br />\r<br />Much of the floor plan was inspired by the lovely [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50067/?]Elianora&#39;s Vetrheim[/url] - which I highly recommend - and the houses in Bruma via Oblivion. It comes with the usual bells and whistles for a player home, including 4 guest beds and a working shower for the privy. There are many weapon racks and displays, as well as mannequins. Truly, I&#39;ve been racking my brain for months trying to make the perfect home for &#39;my&#39; Dragonborn, and I think this works rather well for my needs. I hope it does for you too&#33; \r<br />\r<br />In the towns inn, I&#39;ve also added a Pilgrim Merchant, a minor NPC that has a few basic supplies that you might need on a run up to High Hrothgar.\r<br />\r<br />To enter the manor, you must find the [color=#ff0000]key hidden in the courtyard[/color]. It shouldn&#39;t stump you.\r<br />\r<br />And thank you, AusGigo, for this lil vid&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[youtube]AtuF0r7gGcs[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Installation: \r<br />- All files into your Skyrim &gt; Data folder; it comes with custom meshes (including my retexture of a Raven Rock door&#33;), so best be careful with those. \r<br />\r<br />Incompatabilities: \r<br />- I&#39;d wager anything messing with the cell just north of Ivarstead, next to the bridge to High Hrothgar, might be in the way. \r<br />-Uncertain of EtaC, but as mentioned it should work flawlessly with JK&#39;s verison of the town.\r<br />\r<br />Needed DLC:\r<br />- Only Dragonborn is needed. I might think of a Hearthfire version later. \r<br />\r<br />Credits: \r<br />- Thank you Elianora for your constant inspirations in the modding community&#33;\r<br />- Many thanks to Darkrider for the wonderful paintings&#33;\r<br />- Thank you Oaristys for the glorious static meshes&#33;         [/center]",
