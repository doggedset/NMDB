  "descriptionHtml": "Details:\r<br />This save is for more of a quick start to quest mods. A lot of major choices are left out so you can customise the save to your liking.\r<br />\r<br />A non-legit (Read the bottom) save that has almost finished to skip all the annoying main story and things like that to play mods or possibly if you&#39;re like me to finish DragonBorn (I still have not done it).\r<br />\r<br />List:\r<br />\r<br />Main story - Complete\r<br />\r<br />Civil War - Not complete (Will not be done)\r<br />\r<br />Misc - Not complete\r<br />\r<br />Mages Guild - Complete\r<br />\r<br />Thieves Guild - Complete\r<br />\r<br />Companions - Complete\r<br />\r<br />The Dark Brotherhood - WIP (Trying to solve if it&#39;s a bug or a misunderstood part of the game)\r<br />\r<br />DragonBorn - Not complete (Will not be done)\r<br />\r<br />Dawnguard - Not complete (Will not be done)\r<br />\r<br />Spouse - Not complete (Will not be done)\r<br />\r<br />Children - Not complete (Will not be done)\r<br />\r<br />All Shouts, spells, skills, level 81, all perks\r<br />\r<br />This save is not entirely legitimate, it has had console commands used to add perks (Can be fixed), TCL to run through caves quickly and some to debug NPCs. (Hopefully this is okay) No mods have been used that you need, so you can just load the save without any mods.\r<br />\r<br />Install:\r<br />\r<br />Download from the link in the &#39;Files&#39; section.\r<br />Extract the File from the ZIP.\r<br />Put the ESS file into C:&#92;Users&#92;(Name)&#92;Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim&#92;Saves (Not sure with Mac or Linux)\r<br />Load the save in Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Edit History\r<br />\r<br />-Changed the description entirely.\r<br />\r<br />-Edited name from 100% to what the file actually is.",
