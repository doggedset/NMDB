  "descriptionHtml": "-Description- \r<br />\r<br />Thorn Vale keep is a massive castle player home located south west of windhelm. It comes with all crafting stations/Secondary crafting stations/armory/storage/over 80 beds for companions/Tavern/Library/Servants Quarters/Guest Quarters/Guard Barracks/Jail/Bath House/Temple Of the Divines/Throne room/Master Bedroom/Balcony and dozens of other rooms.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Update: 1/17/15 Uploaded The Vale Island Version of this mod. This version is a work in progress and is far from finished. Expect to encounter LOD issues Floating objects unfinished areas and lack of polish. This version should be pretty stable and is located in it&#39;s own world space. Before installing this version remember to uninstall the old version and remove all items and make sure your character is not inside.  \r<br />\r<br />Update: 9/1/14 I&#39;m getting close to finishing up this mod only about 30-40 more hours of work and I&#39;ll be done with most of this mod. After that just some bug cleaning and polish. I&#39;m going to upload A UNFINISHED version of this mod to nexus for the purpose of testing. While this version is unfinished it should be safe for you to download and check out my progress. \r<br />\r<br />Make sure before you install this mod you completely uninstall the other version and remove all items.\r<br />\r<br />Update: 8/6/14 I&#39;ve started working on this mod again a day ago and managed to solve some long over due problems with LOD. I&#39;ll upload a few picture with my progress. Right now Vale island is little more then a island with some trees and rocks on it but under the surface I have built a solid bug free foundation. I may release a unfinished version of the mod with in a few days just to make sure their are no problems. This version will be pretty bare but should be bug free.  \r<br />\r<br />Update: 6/28/2014 First I would like to apologise for the lack of any content updates in the last month for this mod. During the summer months I have very little free time due to work. I will start working on this mod again at the end of july. If all goes as planed I should have plenty of time to finish this mod up. \r<br />\r<br />Update: 5/29/2014 Still working on this mod but have really slowed down over the last week due to real life butting in. I got the island pretty much done now I just need to fill it in with interesting sites and pretty locales. I am working on a second world space as well called the valed docks. Think massive water cave with a dock and boats where you can store all your loot. Sort of like the East Empire Docks under solitude but bigger. \r<br />\r<br />Update: 5/20/2014 I have finally gotten the LOD working and with in a week or two if I don&#39;t run in to any more problem I should have Vale Island pretty close to finished. That being said I still have to work on my second world space and rework a few of Thorn vale Keeps cells. Namely The Tower Armor and the Tower Forge will be completely changed. When I&#39;m finished I plan to have a Enchanters Tower and a Alchemy Tower and the forge and everything else will have its own area.\r<br />\r<br />Update: 5/16/2014 I am still working on this mod and still trying to get the LOD landscape working for the island. Once I get the LOD working correctly I&#39;ll post some pictures.\r<br />\r<br />Update: 4/23/2014 The island is at 60% I&#39;m working on bug fixes and lod atm. I cant really give a ETA at the moment but I am still working on it. \r<br />\r<br />Update: 4/9/2014 my plan was to add a secret room but while working on it I got side tracked and am now working on a exterior world space to move Thorn Vale Keep to. When I&#39;m done I will be renaming this mode to Vale Island because of the island it will be sitting on when I&#39;m done.\r<br />\r<br />Due to the fact I have never no experience in creating world spaces this next update will take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. \r<br />\r<br />Update: 4/8/2014 Reworked Temple, added crypts, bug fixes, lighting improvments.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-Bugs to be fixed in next update.\r<br />\r<br />After reinstalling my game I&#39;m noticing cracks&#33; Lots of cracks, I&#39;ll see about getting the cracks fixed. \r<br />\r<br />-What&#39;s Finished-\r<br />\r<br />&bull;Added Guards and two venders\r<br />&bull;Added Balcony \r<br />&bull;Added Tavern\r<br />&bull;Castle Entrance redone 12/7/2013\r<br />&bull;Castle West Wing/Rooms/beds/storage/Archery and magic ranges\r<br />&bull;Castle East Wing/RoomsBeds/Storage\r<br />&bull;Castle Dinning area\r<br />&bull;Castle Kitchen\r<br />&bull;Castle Library\r<br />&bull;Servants Quarters redone 12/7/2013\r<br />&bull;Temple Of The Divines redone 4/7/2014\r<br />&bull;Bath House redone 12/8/2013\r<br />&bull;Guard Barracks improved 1/9/2014\r<br />&bull;Castle Basement WIP\r<br />&bull;Castle Lobby and dinning\r<br />&bull;Guest Quarters \r<br />&bull;Throne Room\r<br />&bull;Master Bedroom redone 3/14/2014 \r<br />&bull;Castle Crypts \r<br />&bull;Lots of other rooms\r<br />&bull;fully nevmeshed.
