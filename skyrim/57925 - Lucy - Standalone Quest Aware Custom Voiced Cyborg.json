Her father used to work for the government and the center of intelligence, he held much power in society, but everything changed when his corrupt manager decided to eliminate him to gain more profit as resources were diminishing, everyone was desperate for more. Radiation levels made it barely a livable planet and most people lived in vaults, Lucy was heartbroken and instead of facing certain death by getting revenge, she fled to the mountains to live a peaceful life. But they sent cyborgs and soldiers to track her down as she knew too much information they finally tracked her down and beat her to a bloody pulp, and they told her she was nothing but dirt and she was the property of the Government. Lucy was filled with bitterness and anger as she found herself helpless. They locked her in a cage and put her too sleep, the government was plotting to kill her but instead they decided to turn her into a cyborg so she can do their dirty work. Lucy was the Government&#39;s little lab rat, just another machine added to their vast collection of Cyborgs. The Scientist&#39;s who experimented on her were control freaks and wanted Lucy to bend at their every command, the scientist&#39;s injected her with a special serum to make her stronger and to follow their commands. Lucy was one of the few who survived the serum, the serum backfired and Lucy only got stronger and found herself using a higher percentage of her brain. Lucy quickly went on a rampage and killed many cyborgs and scientist&#39;s she managed to escape and as she was being chased by the government she had no choice but to activate her master&#39;s portal to escape certain death. Lucy&#39;s master was a genius and was obsessed in creating a time machine. As Lucy activated her master&#39;s portal she entered into a loophole which brought her to a different Galaxy. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#9900ff][size=4]Inspiration[/size][/color]\r<br />[youtube]bMpHtAMZRek[/youtube]\r<br /> \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff00ff]Requirements[/color]\r<br />Skyrim.esm\r<br />Latest Update 1.9\r<br />(Apachii 1.5 is optional and required for the Exclusive version)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff00ff]Compatibility[/color]\r<br />Compatible with AFT\r<br />Compatible with Sofia\r<br />Compatible with Inigo\r<br />Compatible with Vilja :)\r<br />Compatible with Wet & Cold\r<br />Compatible with spouse to custom home \r<br />Compatible with head tracking\r<br />You shouldn&#39;t have a problem with most mods&#33;For best results I recommend the AFT mod&#33; \r<br />It&#39;s recommended to place Lucy at the bottom of your load order.\r<br />I have cleaned this mod with Tes5Edit and it also brings its own SEQ file, so you don&#39;t have to save and reload.\r<br />The hunting bow that automatically spawns in your Companions has been fixed in this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#9900ff]Recommended Mods\r<br />[/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?]ApachiiSkyHair by [b]Apachii[/b][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?]Amazing Follower Tweaks by [b]Dheuster[/b][/url][color=#9900ff]\r<br />[/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52667/?]Hedge Mage Armor by [b]Elleh[/b][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60/?]Enhanced Blood Textures by dDefinder[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57841/?]dwarven beam blades by [b]mahty[/b][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57870/?]The Huntsman by [b]InsanitySorrow[/b][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43891/?]Edhildils Dwemer Cyborg BBP by [b]Edhildil[/b][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?]Caliente&#39;s Beautiful Bodies Edition -CBBE- by [b]Caliente[/b][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22701/?]Seductive Lips HD by [b]EcthelionOtW[/b][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36510/?]Superior Lore-Friendly Hair - HD textures by [b]skyrimaguas[/b][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?]The Eyes Of Beauty by [b]Gabriel Mailhot[/b][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27371/?]Better Dialogue Controls by [b]ecirbaf[/b][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28170/?]Better MessageBox Controls by [b]ecirbaf\r<br />[/b][/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11370/?]Spouses Can Live Everywhere by [b]Amgepo and Emma\r<br />[/b][/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12289/?]JJA SunGlare by [b]MannyGT\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/url][color=#9900ff]My Other mods&#33;[/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52093/?]GOS - Gangs Of Skyrim[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56530/?]The Nightingale Brotherhood[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57621/?]Rayan - Quest Aware Custom Voiced Companion[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]J6COD_MKuns[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#c27ba0]Questions?[/color]\r<br />[color=#c27ba0]I can&#39;t find Lucy, where did she go? it&#39;s ok Lucy tends to have a mind of her own sometimes.[/color]\r<br />open up the console ~ and press help Lucy&#33; Or type in (player.placeatme 03000D62 :)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#c27ba0]It&#39;s not lore friendly?[/color]\r<br />Buzz Off&#33; read the above statement&#33; Thank you&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[color=#d5a6bd]Can I marry Lucy?[/color]\r<br />Not right now, you have no idea how much extra effort one must take for that option, but I&#39;ll most likely give players that option in the future.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#d5a6bd]I thought I seen this mod up before &#34;Sorina&#34;\r<br />[/color]Many people sent me message on here and the nexus asking for Sorina and why I took her down. I nearly gave up on the project but then I decided to get to the bottom of it and I realized Sorina had a glitch with AFT, and I just had to make her compatible with AFT&#33; The reason she had a glitch was because Sorina was one of the first mods I made and I made her with many mods installed which I learned a year ago it&#39;s a big no no&#33; When modding one must always work on the CK with no mods installed only your esp and resources. I learned much now in the process. This is the new and improved version, in which comes with the actual cyborg eye as well with no glitches&#33; And with unique dialogue and quests. :)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#d5a6bd]Do I need anymore files?[/color]\r<br />No she is standalone, unless you want to put some make up and give her Apachii hair.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]Ab_ncqZ-6ZQ[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#9900ff]Credits [/color]\r<br />This mod is free and I don&#39;t expect any donations, it&#39;s all based on free ware, thanks to all who have supported my previous mods I appreciate it&#33; :)\r<br />First of all I want to give credits and honors to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2527329/?]Elleh[/url] for her amazing [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52667/?]Hedge Mage Armor[/url], thank you so much.
