  "descriptionHtml": "Janet is a seriously loaded alchemy merchant based in Arcadia&#39;s Cauldron in Whiterun. Not coincidentally, she is also Arcadia&#39;s daughter, and she carries large quantities of most alchemical goods. In fact, it&#39;s a wonder she hasn&#39;t put her mom out of business. You can usually find her on the second floor.\r<br />\r<br />Note:\r<br />I originally created this vendor to offset a certain weapon mod, which I thought had prohibitively high crafting requirements. Many players might consider Janet&#39;s inventory and gold reserves unbalanced.",
