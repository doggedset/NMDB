I&#39;ve had permission to post this for a while but only just recently thought of putting it up here. It&#39;s specifically for the two legged female &#34;putty tats&#34; of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Download the femaletailkhajiit.nif and put it in this folder:\r<br />\r<br />Data / meshes / actors / character / character assets\r<br />\r<br />and PRESTO&#33; No more butt plug tails.\r<br />\r<br />This will also work for the Ohmes Raht. Just gotta copy and paste the file into the Ohmes folder separately.",
