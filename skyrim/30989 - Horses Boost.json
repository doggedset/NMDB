  "descriptionHtml": "IMPORTANT\r\nThis is a REupload of a mod that i was using with another account that i deleted, named \\\"Cavalli Pi√π Veloci- Horse Speed Up\\\" (but for some reason that mod is still visible even if i closed the account, and obviusly i can\\'t touch it anymore o_O)\r\n\r\nThis mod simply change the Horse Race speed, making it more realistic.\r\nThe Horse now are faster in normal run and VERY fasto in sprint, but no too much to break immersion. That means that you can\\'t run fast as them even if sprinting (as it must be in real) but they are not RaidableRocket that can run the whole skyrim in 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nWatch out that this mod affect Every horses of the game, so if you use it from the start, the caravan will arrive to destination far before then normal :)\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\nEvery mod that add new horses not touching the horse race will be compatible and take the effect of this mod. To be sure, simply put this mod in lower load order",
