  "descriptionHtml": "Since no one has considered to fix up the Abandon Prison, I\\'ve decide to do it myself. Here are a list of changes:\r\n* Removed all ghost.\r\n* Removed all damaged parts of the exterior of the building.\r\n* Removed all possible collapsed walls and rocks. \r\n* Blocked off several hallways that lead to no where.\r\n* Repaired a damaged wall.\r\n* Placed several guards in the prison. (they just stand there with torches..too lazy to make them patrol)\r\n* Placed beds and tables in each cell\r\n* Placed several prisoners in the cells.\r\n* All cells have expert locks.\r\n* reorganized armory room. \r\n* Build a bridge so the player could go across the river.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there\\'s any issues.\r\n",
