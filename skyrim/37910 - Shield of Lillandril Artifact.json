  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new shield to the game, the Shield of Lillandril. Originally featured in The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard as a magical elven flask that protected it\\'s bearer from magical attacks, it was been reworked into an elven shield with a new texture. \r\n\r\nThe shield can be found in a large chest at the shrine of Clavicus Vile. Along with the shield comes a book that gives the official canon back-story to the original artifact.\r\n\r\nThis is a small mod designed primarily for those interested in learning a bit of interesting Elder Scrolls lore who also would like get a cool new shield. Everything discussed in the book is canon except the last parts about reworking the flask into a shield.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nSader325 - For the shield texture - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5600/\r\nNexusMods - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com\r\nBethesda - http://bethsoft.com ",
