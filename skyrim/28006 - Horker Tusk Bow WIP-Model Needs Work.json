  "modName": "Horker Tusk Bow WIP-Model Needs Work",
  "summary": "My personally long awaited weapon is soon to be in-game but it\\'s model could use a little TLC.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The model was created simply by \\\"model mashing\\\" and the only things that need work would be to bind the tusks to how the bow limbs so they bend and see how it all looks. In all ideal hopes it would be nice to see the strings reach to the tips of the tusks and there to be a notch for the strings to hook into. I am not prepared to implement this in-game until I can get some help and then it may be added as a collective mod featuring a weapon type I have not seen uploaded yet which would need some aid as well. I know this may be lost model but as one of my first to see nearest completion I\\'m throwing it in the air in the hopes it may be caught by a skilled modeler or modelers.",
