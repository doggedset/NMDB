  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Greetings&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I realize there&#39;s a lot of reworks for the Nightingale Set out there but none of them suited my needs. They either overpowered the Set as a whole or disabled the levelling of the items in order to make them work or they had wrong stats for an archer.\r<br />\r<br />Also most of these reworks didn&#39;t bother fixing the detection sound level. (Was normal before, should be silent for an assassin bow)\r<br />\r<br />[b]What has been altered?[/b]\r<br />Nightingale Bow; Level 1 to 4 - Enchantment altered to Frost/Soultrap, Basic Damage slightly reduced, Critical Damage slightly increased\r<br />Nightingale Bow; Level 5 - Enchantment altered to Frost/Soultrap, Basic Damage slightly reduced, Passive Perk &#34;Trick Shot&#34; added, chance to disarm hit target. Critical Damage slightly increased.\r<br />\r<br />Nightingale Blade; Level 1 to 4 - Altered back to Vanilla Stats\r<br />Nightingale Blade; Level 5 - Altered back to Vanilla Stats, Crit Damage increased to 20\r<br />\r<br />Nightingale Hood - Enchantment changed to Marksman (12-20) & Speechcraft Fortify (10-20)\r<br />Nightingale Cuirass - Vanilla Enchantment\r<br />Nightingale Boots - Vanilla Enchantment\r<br />Nightingale Gloves - Enchantment changed to Marksman (8-13) & Lockpicking (15-25)\r<br />\r<br />(Bonus) Nightweavers Band - Enchantment changed to fortify Sneak & Lockpick\r<br />\r<br />(Bonus) Sound Detection of the bow (Level 1-5) has been lowered to &#34;Silent&#34;. As it should be.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Concerns:[/b]\r<br />- But oh Kryo&#33; You have reduced the basic damage of Nightingale Bow&#33; Do not like&#33;\r<br />- Yes, yes. BUT&#33; +% in Archery and the increased critical damage makes up for it more than enough. This way you will do aprox. 25-30% more damage while Sneak Attacking. Also don&#39;t forget that you will have a &#34;silented&#34; bow now. This way I feel the risk/reward portion of beeing a silent hunter/ranger/assassin is increased without risking to &#34;underpower&#34; the weapon. (Tested thoroughly betwen level 5 and level 30 in multiple playthroughs)\r<br />\r<br />- I play with ultra-high difficulty and I have downloaded fiddyseven mods to increase said difficulty. Will Karliah die with the altered bow? She doesn&#39;t profit from your enchantments after all&#33;\r<br />- The NPC Versions of the Bow and Armor are unaltered. Karliah will have Vanilla Stats. If she dies/faints every 2 seconds its not my fault&#33;\r<br />\r<br />- I want the same textures as you in your screenshots&#33;\r<br />- Check below at recommended mods. Texture Addons have been linked.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation[/b]\r<br />Easiest way is to use NMM.\r<br />Else simply drop the .ESP into your Skyrim/Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Recommended Mods:[/b]\r<br />[i](Not needed but recommended to boost play expirience)[/i]\r<br />Nightingale Pride (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33704/) - Bow and Blade Reincarnation (ReTex of the Bow and Blade. Looks super awesome&#33;)\r<br />Nightingale Hi-res Retex with Torn Scarf and Variants (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3765/) (Retex of the Nightingale Armor, looks sweet as hell&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Problems with other mods?[/b]\r<br />Aside from mods that attempt to alter any of the above mentioned items should be okay. Remember&#33; Only addons that attempt to alter the Stats of said items might cause problems. Retex addons should not cause any problems at all&#33;",
