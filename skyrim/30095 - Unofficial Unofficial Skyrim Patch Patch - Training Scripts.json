Source files included. Click &#34;Yes&#34; to overwrite files if prompted.\r<br />\r<br />Specifically, the USKP rewrites the scripts that handle skill trainers who are also followers to remove their gold when you pay for training. It means the gold will not be in their inventory after training. As this seems to be purely a balance issue and not a bug, I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s appropriate to include in the USKP. This patch overrides the USKP scripts with the original scripts as created by Bethesda.",
