  "descriptionHtml": "NOW WITH A LEVEL 1 CAESSA! ENJOY!\r\n\r\nI apologize if there are any difficulties. First time submitting anything.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is a save of my beauty and pride: Caessa, a level 44 Nord (I think of her as Dunmir/Nord mix... you can think of her as you like ^^). I spent many loving hours downloading mods and fidgeting with the showracemenu console command to get what I wanted: a woman who looked elegant and \\\"perfect\\\" without being overly cutesy and meek.\r\n\r\nShe has slain Alduin, is head of the Dark Brotherhood, leads the Companions, has successfully rebuilt the Thieves Guild, and has 98% of the map explored, if not 100%.\r\n\r\nShe is a thief/assassin with 100 Sneak and the tree completely maxed. 200 Enchanting (I cheated here. You\\'ll see why later) and consoled perks in smithing and enchanting... in other words, they were ill gotten. :P\r\n\r\nIf you have a problem with that, feel free to remove them via console. ^^\r\n\r\n100 in Pickpocketing (filled tree), 80 in Archery, 66 One-Handed specializing in blades (especially dual wield), 60 in Light Armor, and 64 in Lockpicking.\r\n\r\nHer equipment is made up of hide armor with very strong enchantments placed on them. Reason behind this is... she\\'s an assassin... shouldn\\'t be hit. :P\r\n\r\nHer weapons are the Mehrune\\'s Razor and Skyforge Steel blade and Ebony Bow enchanted highly.\r\n\r\nShe has houses in a few holds but her main home is the little shack in Whiterun where you\\'ll find many stolen goods and enchanted items she\\'s been hoarding as well as her lovely wife Muiri.\r\n\r\nAnyway.\r\n\r\nI don\\'t remember every single mod...\r\n\r\nBut what I do know is that you should have:\r\n\r\nFur Hoods HD: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3201\r\n\r\nBright Eyes: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2464\r\n\r\nApart from that, the only mods I utilized were to enhance my graphics. I don\\'t know if it\\'s possible, but if someone wants, I can TRY to upload my entire skyrim folder... which should have all the mods in. :P\r\n\r\nAnyway, enjoy! Caessa is all yours.",
