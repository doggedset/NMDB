  "descriptionHtml": "&#39;&#39;The gods gave you two hands, and you use them both for your weapon. I can respect that.&#39;&#39; - Whiterun Guard\r<br />\r<br />Stoutheart Weapons provide the steel look as a &#39;&#39;cosmetic&#39;&#39; alternative for higher tier weapon crafting.\r<br />\r<br />There are three tiers of weapons available to craft. Stoutheart weapons are equivalent to Skyforge Steel; Improved Stoutheart weapons are equivalent to Ebony; and Superior Stoutheart weapons are equivalent to Daedric. Appropriate smithing perks are required.\r<br />\r<br />Note that there is not much difference between the lower tier Stoutheart weapons and Skyforge Steel weapons. Unlike Skyforge weapons, however, they are craftable (using dwarven perk) and do not require membership in the Companions.\r<br />\r<br />Includes recipes for:\r<br />\r<br />Battleaxe\r<br />Greatsword\r<br />Warhammer\r<br />Sword\r<br />War Axe\r<br />Shield\r<br />\r<br />These weapons are designed for use with the Stoutheart Armor sets, http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21704\r<br />\r<br />Also available on Steam Workshop, http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=72079477",
