  "descriptionHtml": "Requires Hearthfire.\r<br />\r<br />Now in beta&#33; Manually cleaned with TES5Edit, so it shouldn&#39;t be totally wonky anymore. Still need to rework the weapon displays and the mannequin, but it should be stable now, at least.\r<br />\r<br />New additions to the entry way, rearranged the kitchen, expanded the loft (new mannequin heyo&#33;), and added on to the master bedroom. Added a small cellar (via load door) with enchanting and alchemy stations. Plenty of storage, but i could probably have put more (and probably will, to be honest).\r<br />\r<br />Before installing, please remove all your stuff from Breezehome. I deleted plenty of containers in the &#34;common&#34; class and replaced them with &#34;upper&#34; versions. The chest in the master bedroom was actually just moved so that one&#39;s probably okay, but play it safe and just take your stuff out.\r<br />\r<br />",
