  "modName": "California Girls -- UNP",
  "summary": "All named female NPCs of Skyrim, DLCs, and some companion and quest mods etc.  This is not a WIP&#33; \r<br />Easy and tested as companions, any will level with you over level 300 (tested, they never have to be trained because they&#39;re part of Skyrim) (if they have a quest please wait until that quest is completed). Housecarls and bards are femal",
  "descriptionHtml": "N.B. All files have a document file in the download, which was the most current and updated document at the time that this file was created; however, the latest file with the latest version will have the absolute latest and most current installation document. So, if an update occurs, please load the latest file, which will have the most up-to-document for installation if you have problems with installation. I will also do my best to annotate those general conditions here on the Description page.\r<br />\r<br />Added Missing Eye Texture File.\r<br />\r<br />Use Oblivion Hair Replacer in the Miscellaneous Section for those who don&#39;t have the updated document files.\r<br />\r<br />For those users experiencing &#34;Infinite Loading Screens&#34; (ILS), try Safety Load (#46465) -- tested over 100 hours. This fixes ILS related to Lakeview Extended.\r<br />\r<br />The goal of this mod was to improve the appearance of Female NPCs and to allow them to wear the beautiful armors and clothes available to Skyrim and to wear upgraded armors. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so each NPC is available as a companion and will level up with you over Level 300 (tested).\r<br />\r<br />Uploaded a closeup of Mjoll to show the smooth face texture used in this mod.\r<br />\r<br />NPC female replacer for Bathing Beauties Luxury Suite added as an optional file. It requires any main file plus the Luxury Suite Mod. It also adds Willows Whiter Teeth to the game. All files are current and will upgrade to version 1.2 with this new file. \r<br />\r<br />WHAT&#39;S NEXT: I thought I might add some not-lore armor to the NPCs -- what do you think? Do you like the &#34;Images.&#34;Each NPC has been individually adjusted: her outfit has been removed and replaced as loose items in her inventory. However, without more feedback and support, I don&#39;t really know what to do. Where would you like me to take this mod?\r<br />\r<br />&#34;The Rest of Skyrim&#34; contains over 500 beautified female NPCs. All bards and housecarls are female. The complete set requires the Aela, Illia and Njada file and then you have all of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Did you know that LakeviewExtended can be an all female mod&#33; Model #13 is Willow from LakeviewExtended. I think that pretty little alchemist, Calista is the best.\r<br />\r<br />Obviously, the DLCs require their respective Bethesda DLC.\r<br />Also, if you insert Apachii Hairs properly and the Oblivion Hair Final, your ladies should look exacly like mine. There just isn&#39;t any thing else to do.\r<br />\r<br />These women should not interfere in any way with any of your quests or the normal running of Skyrim, or the normal use of the CK as they do not have &#34;special&#34; skins.\r<br />\r<br />Who is your favorite Lady?\r<br />\r<br />Almost all the ladies outfits have been removed and replaced as individual items within the inventory category of the CK. *** Bethesda claims that NPCs will wear best armor (bug fix), so they should not be naked, however I don&#39;t think this works -- it does in the CK.\r<br />They all start at level 10 and will level with you (tested over L300).\r<br />Almost all of them belong to the marriage and follower factions and many start with player relationships (you should wait until their quests are finished).\r<br />Most have had the conjuration spells removed so that travelling and fighting are not so cumbersome -- don&#39;t you hate it when you are in a battle and an astronach fills the screen so that you can&#39;t fight or see the enemy, or you can&#39;t get through a passageway because there is something conjured in the way.\r<br />\r<br />Also, each mod has some hidden feature that you&#39;ll find in a text file within the download. e.g. Hearthfire now allows creating more nails, etc. per click (at the same cost though). Dawnguard allows you to convert more crossbow bolts per click.\r<br />\r<br />They are all UNP California style -- for those people who haven&#39;t lived in California, you might call them thin, skinny etc. However, I assure you that they are very healthy All their weights are under 50, most under 30. Typically, what they wear will alter their weight look. Older ladies faces are younger matching the single body type allowed by vanilla Skyrim (All NPCs are in the first rank for age except 2). All scars, dirt, and tattoos have been removed except 1. Almost all are set to unaggressive, average (easy to change -- setav aggression #, setav confidence #. Almost all have a blue-eyed variant as brown looks terrible on my computer. n.b. California style is not a new body, it&#39;s just a mashup of what I think are the best features of the stock UNP body with some minor addons (like no neck seam, etc.) -- I just don&#39;t like the term UNP Skinny, when they&#39;re not skinny, just healthy, normal California types. Women aren&#39;t fat any more, they&#39;re full-figured -- I think California Style is full figured to me and the others are just ...\r<br />\r<br />I started this project over a year ago and as such I used the best mods available at the time, progressing up to now. They can all be edited normally within the CK. There are no special heads, etc. The base is built around Oriental Beauty Mod, Apachii Hairs and UNP thin high definition (whoops) I guess coverwomen wasn&#39;t used any more -- good thing because the architect doesn&#39;t answer his pm&#39;s.\r<br />\r<br />Some of my uploaded pictures will show NPCs from mods that have been converted to female. Case in point: Luxury Suite has a male guard guarding females, but also a male guard guarding males -- shouldn&#39;t a female guard protect the females? I loaded up the new Lakeview mod and brought some of my female companions there and what do I see but a male orc with time on his hands in the pool with all my ladies; so I converted all the NPCs in that mod to female -- While I&#39;m off saving the world, why do I want to leave my female companions with a bunch of males with time on there hands? As I get the proper permissions, I will add other files to my site. By the way, my mannequins are not naked unless you consider a block of wood or piece of plastic to be naked (oh my, the cup you delivered my coffee in is naked&#33; -- they are just artistically decorated and formed so that a woman or man can see what an outfit will look like on a woman -- not on a tree, a bear, a chair, a weasel, a dragon but a woman -- but it&#39;s still just a piece of wood or plastic. \r<br />\r<br />Recommended: Safety Load #46465\r<br />\r<br />These people deserve credit for their work.\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />In the download:\r<br />UNP Dimon -- Dimon99 #6709\r<br />Lograam, The Eyes of Beauty #13722\r<br />Oriental Eyes and Brows -- Radioragae\r<br />Oriental Beauty Mod -- Thanks to Radioragae\r<br />Willows Whiter Teeth -- 83Willow #11371\r<br />Not in the Download:\r<br />Apachii #10168\r<br />Oblivion Hair Final -- Radioragae #18110 (Use my replacement in the Miscellaneous Section -- Bottom)\r<br />Lakeview Extended -- Ac3s #31380\r<br />Tera Armor #25846 \r<br />Tes5Edit -- Elminster #25859\r<br />Willows Whiter Teeth -- 83Willow #11371 (the next release will include this in the download)\r<br />Bathing Beauties Luxury Suite -- Migal130 #11427\r<br />\r<br />Change Notes:\r<br />V1.1 Ysolda removed from BPAela as a duplicate and she looks better in &#34;The Rest of Skyrim.&#34; &#34;The Rest of Skyrim&#34; is being reworked and checked, available soon.\r<br />V1.2 Adds Willows Whiter Teeth to the game -- by permission it is included in the download.\r<br />V1.3 Adds missing mannequins to Skryim; Adds Willows Whiter Teeth to a Main File; Changes Aela slightly.\r<br />V1.3a Will include the missing Texture files in the main download \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
