  "summary": "Adds a half-giant race called the Vrykul to the game, based on the race of the same name from World of Warcraft.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds two races to the game, Vrykul and Vrykul child, based on the Vrykul of Warcraft lore; half-giant natives of Northrend and the progenitors of mankind.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 is essentially a scaled-up Nord race, with racials appropriate for Vrykul.\r\n\r\nAdult male: 1.5 scale\r\nAdult female: 1.45 scale\r\nChild male: 1.1948 scale\r\nChild female: 1.1948 scale\r\n\r\nVanilla children stand at .8 scale. The tallest vanilla race is the High Elves, which stand at 1.08 scale.\r\n\r\nVrykul have increased damage with melee weapons and increased base carrying capacity, making them excellent heavy-armor fighters.\r\n+10 each to Two-handed, One-handed, and Heavy Armor; +5 to Smithing.\r\nVrykul Roar: causes enemies to flee.\r\nVrykul Prowess: +10 melee weapon damage. Does not show up in Active Effects for some reason, but I\\'ve tested it to make sure it\\'s actually present.\r\n\r\n***IMPORTANT NOTE***\r\nVrykul children will appear in their underwear due to how Skyrim handles armor on child races. My new mod \\\"[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10198]Playable Children PLUS[/url]\\\" addresses this issue for the starting clothing.\r\n\r\nAlso note that in order to complete the Dark Brotherhood questline you will need [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10770]Higher Magic DB CookQuest Fix[/url]. This is a custom race fix, which allows the conversation with the Solitude cook to proceed.",
