  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Background[/b]\r<br />Resting atop a small craggy hill, is the seldom used outpost of Goldwatch. In recent years a Legionnaire has made the land his own. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Description[/b]\r<br />Greetings and welcome to my second mod for Elder Scrolls Skyrim. You can find this player abode near North Brittleshin Pass. Like my previous work, this is a lore friendly themed home. This player home is also completely navmeshed, so your companions won&#39;t be left at the door feeling neglected. :P\r<br />\r<br />Similar to Fort Ironcrag, the previous mod I released, some backstory to the home can be found in the journal resting on the nightstand. This player home also includes an improved set of Legionnaire armor as a bonus which can be found on the home&#39;s previous owner. I hope you&#39;ll enjoy my latest contribution to the excellent Nexus modding community, and I look forward to reading your feedback. Cheers&#33;",
