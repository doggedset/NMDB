  "descriptionHtml": "Hircine\\\\\\'s Needler\r\nVersion 1.11\r\njonathan0068\r\n\r\nREQUIRES SKSE\r\nhttp://skse.silverlock.org/\r\n____________________\r\n\r\n-The new update allows you to aim the bash spell vertically as well, so I highly recommend you update for that useful addition.-\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a bow with a unique abilities, that gain effectiveness when your character is skilled. The standard stats of the bow are that of a Daedric Bow, so, I recommend being of level 45 before using this bow, for balance reasons. \r\n\r\n1.) Bash attacks with Hircine\\\\\\'s Needler will unleash the power in the bow, causing nature magic to pour from the bow and into your enemies, which slows their movement speed. This attack will persist until you move, or release the bash button. It can also be channeled while shooting the bow without interruption, which allows skilled players to increase their damage output. Players with a high skill in destruction will do more damage with this attack, and slow their enemies for a longer duration.\r\n\r\n2.) Attacks against you have a chance to summon a leveled spriggan to aid you in combat. When summoned, the spriggan may use its heal on you. The probability that a spriggan will be summoned is based on your light/heavy armor skill (the highest). The strength of the spriggan is based on your archery skill (masters of archery will summon two spriggans, one of the highest strength and one of the lowest.) The chance that the spriggan will heal you when summoned is based on your restoration skill.\r\n\r\nThe bow is held by a leader of the Forsworn, in Lost Valley Redoubt. Kill him, and it\\\\\\'s yours.\r\n\r\nNOTE: As of now, these effects occur for the player alone. The bow in the hands of a companion will act exactly like a Daedric bow (I have not done extensive testing on this, so if this is incorrect, please let me know.)\r\n____________________\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nExtract the contents of this archive into your Skyrim data folder, activate the ESP \\\\\\\"HircineBow.esp\\\\\\\" via your preferred method. Launch\r\nthe game with the SKSE launcher\r\n\r\n____________________\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\n\r\nThis mod and its contents are not to be uploaded to any sites other than Nexus. \r\nEverything included in this mod can be considered a modder\\\\\\'s resource, my only request is that you credit my work and this mod. \r\n\r\n____________________\r\n\r\nARTIST WANTED!\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I am more for executing and scripting than modeling and texturing.
