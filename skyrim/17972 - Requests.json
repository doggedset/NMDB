It is craftable with 1 silver ignot and 2 leather strips, and tempered with 1 silver ignot. \r\nThe arrows are also about steel strength, and craftable with 1 silver ignot and 1 firewood for 10 arrows. They do not have the more damage to undead perk, because I couldn\\'t add a script to arrows. The box simply isn\\'t there in the editor.\r\nBoth the bow and the arrows have either a light or dark texture, see the screenshots for reference and read the installation instructions.\r\n\r\n\tCompability/ issues\r\nNo known issues.\r\nShould be compitable with almost anything, except with mods that change the SilverHandMissile NPC. Those issues can be solved with wrye bash.\r\nIf any compability issues or bugs are encountered, please send me a pm or post a comment.\r\n\r\n\tPermissions\r\nFeel free to use these textures in your own mods, as long as you do not simply copy my mod and give me credit.  Please do not upload to other sites without my permission.\r\n\r\n[b]Outlander Sword[/b]\r\nDescription\r\nAdds a new sword from a movie called Outlander. It\\'s craftable with 1 iron, 2 steel, and 1 quicksilver. You can temper it using 1 steel. Have fun.\r\n\r\nNo known issues.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use these assets in your own mods, as long as you do not simply copy my mod and give me credit.
