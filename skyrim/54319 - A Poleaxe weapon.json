  "summary": "Adds a craftable poleaxe to the game. The weapon is suitable for all situations.\r<br />A recommended weapon by all the leading Stormcloak Officers&#33;\r<br />Adventurers can use it too I guess...",
  "descriptionHtml": "Another weapon of the iron variety by TheNerevar.\r<br />Again, I like the iron tier weapons because they fit so well with the game.\r<br />\r<br />Weapon stats:\r<br />Swings at a speed between the Battleaxe and Warhammer\r<br />Does the damage between a Greatsword and a Battleaxe\r<br />Ignores 60% of an opponent&#39;s armour rather it&#39;s heavy or light.\r<br />\r<br />The Poleaxe:\r<br />Usually the poleaxe (I&#39;m guessing 15c) was this longish polearm, the head of it was a combination of and axe, hammer, and spike.\r<br />The spike at the top was for spiking.\r<br />The axe was for axing.\r<br />The hammer for hammering.\r<br />And so on...\r<br />\r<br />Poleaxes have a chance to spawn on Stormcloak soldiers and it&#39;s a preferred weapon for Galmar Stone-Fist.\r<br />Should not conflict with leveled lists since it uses it&#39;s own.\r<br />This weapon is craftable and temperable\r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods:\r<br />Polearm and two handed spear animations by h1zchan\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53455/?\r<br />\r<br />That mod replaces the idle attack animation for battleaxes/warhammers/polearms with a thrusting attack.\r<br />Looks really nice and definitely fits for any halberd type weapon out there.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;",
