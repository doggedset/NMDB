  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Information\r<br />[/b]My goal of this plugin was to enable werewolf genitalia for those who use both [i]Moonlight Tales - Werewolf Essentials[/i] by Brevi and [i]SAM[/i] by VectorPlexus. So when you pick your werewolf model and textures through the MCM menu, the schlong will use a matching texture which was included among the SAM archives. Even supports the Apex Werewolf model. And yes, now you can even be a d-girl werewolf (if you play as a male though).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Required Mods\r<br />[/b]-[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59463/?]Moonlight Tales - Werewolf Essentials\r<br />[/url]-[url=http://www.ladymoiraine.com/forum/index.php?topic=8263.0]SAM - Shape Atlas For Men\r<br />[/url]-[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52147/?]Moonlight Tales Mighty Beasts Compatibility[/url] (meshes only)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Recommended Mods\r<br />[/b]-[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60804/?]HD Werewolves[/url]Â (Which I&#39;m using in the screenshots)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Known Issues[/b]\r<br />-If you change your werewolf skin while in werewolf form, the schlong might disappear. To fix this, bring up the console and type &#34;player.setnpcweight x&#34; (with x being a number between 0 and 100). Alternatively you may try to reload the savegame.\r<br />-If you untick the &#34;Enable Schlongs&#34; option in the MCM menu for SAM, the schlong won&#39;t automatically disappear. Probably just my experience.\r<br />-Right now the models doesn&#39;t support the Samuel/Samson scaling. (I don&#39;t want to fiddle too much with the meshes in NifSkope.)\r<br />\r<br />Make sure you load the SAM plugins before MTE, and my modified plugin after.\r<br />\r<br />Should you find more bugs or if you have any questions, do send me a PM. For now, I will disable comments.\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t plan to make this plugin compatible with Automatic Variants, too complicated for me to work on\r<br />\r<br />-\r<br />\r<br />-Credits and thanks goes to Brevi, VectorPlexus and Alkaiser for their original plugins which made mine possible. :)\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;d be more than happy if users submitted screenshots related to my plugin ^.^",
