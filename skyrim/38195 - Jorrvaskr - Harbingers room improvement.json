  "descriptionHtml": "[center]- = -[/center]\r\n\r\n   As a proud member of the Companions, I always wanted to make the longhouse of Jorrvaskr my home. Completing the Companion\\'s questline and inheriting Kodlak\\'s room was not bad, but it didn\\'t exactly compare to an upgraded player house. I modded the room twice in the past trying to fix the lighting because Bethesda optimized it for console skrebs, but I have now decided to make a proper permanent upgrade to the living space. It should go well with anamorfus\\' lighting mod, listed below.\r\n\r\n    I feel a lot of player home mods go overboard with the customization and end up cramped, cluttered and losing the unique style of the locations (I mean, whiterun is in the middle of a tundra. Shit\\'s not supposed to be a lush forest, right?). If you were looking for something with a jacuzzi, eight mannequins, a whole blacksmith\\'s workshop and a lovely woman to keep your bed warm, you\\'ll want to look elsewhere. I added just enough racks and display cases to hold the neatest artifacts an adventurous Dovahkiin will find in his questing and a couple more containers to keep your loot in, along with some lights so you can see it all. Oh, and a mannequin to wear your swagger.\r\n\r\n[center]- A list of the changes -[/center]\r\n[u]In the main room[/u]\r\n- A shield plaque on either wall\r\n- Two candlehorns by the door\r\n- A set of weapon racks along the left wall\r\n- A dagger display case inside the bookcase at the end wall\r\n- A chest underneath the left display case\r\n- A couple of decorative shields and a trophy Sabrecat head\r\n- The old display cases now have proper functionality and will hold your weapons!\r\n\r\n[u]In the bedroom[/u]\r\n- A shield plaque above the bed\r\n- Four weapon racks along the back wall\r\n- A chest opposite of the bed\r\n- A mannequin in the corner\r\n- Some of the table clutter has been replaced by candlehorns\r\n\r\n[center]- = -[/center]\r\n\r\n   As you might have noticed, this is the first time I will have created and released a mod. I have about about two hours of previous experience with the Creation Kit, but I\\'ve tried my best to prevent any \\\"dirty edits\\\" and wonky functionality. If you find any malfunctions in the Jorrvaskr Living Quarters, do tell!\r\n\r\n  I\\'m going to call it a beta version for now as I\\'ve only been testing it myself, but if no problems arise in a week I\\'ll name it a proper release.\r\n\r\n[center]- = -[/center]\r\n\r\n[u]Mods visible in my screenshots[/u]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15983//?]True Vision ENB[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043//?]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37487/?]aMidianBorn Ebony Armor - Gold[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23125/?]aMidianBorn Elven Armor- Gold[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32405/?]Unique Bows[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33292/?]Unique Uniques[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36535/?]Glimmer[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16751/?]The Loner\\'s Sword[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21745/?]Glyphic Enchantment Effect - Dragon[/url]\r\nYour mods made my game way better.
