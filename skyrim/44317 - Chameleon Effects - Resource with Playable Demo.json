  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Description[/b]\r\nAdds Chameleon Effects for Spells, Enchants and Potions similar to Chameleon in Oblivion. They affect your visibility in detection calculations and make your character partially transparent proportional to the total Chameleon magnitude affecting you. The demo can be used in a serious game without concern, the effects are balanced, useful and compatible with practically any mod out there.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\nBusiness as usual, extract the archive in Skyrim\\\\Data or use a mod manager. Activate the plugin(s) in your load order list. Load order does not matter, no vanilla forms have been touched.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]About the Demo[/b]\r\nYou will be instantly provided with an Adept and Expert Chameleon Spell, two Rings of Chameleon and a few Potions of Minor Chameleon. At 100 Enchanting, you\\'ll be able to enchant three pieces of equipment with 15% Chameleon each (without Enchanting potions that is). The hard-cap for Chameleon is 85%, so permanent invisibility is not possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]About the Resource[/b]\r\nSince this is a resource, anyone is free to include or merge the contents of this mod into his or her own. No vanilla forms have been edited, no heavy scripting is used. Script source files are included. Note that if you merge the resource ESM into your own file, other mods using the resource ESM as a Parent Master might conflict. For big Magic overhaul mods that should not matter though.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the examples inside the resource ESM, creating your own effects is straightforward. The forms mostly use a similar naming and structure as the vanilla forms. If you want to adjust the hard-cap of 85%, look in the ChameleonBasePerk description for more details.\r\n\r\nNote that any Actor using Chameleon requires the ChameleonBasePerk, or else the effects simply won\\'t do anything.\r\n\r\nModders having issues with using this resource may PM me for assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Known Issues and Limitations[/b]\r\n[list][*] The transparency effect can cause minor graphical glitches on hair. The effect looks best on characters with headgear hiding hair.\r\n[*] Chameleon only takes effect on Actors that have the ChameleonBasePerk. The demo adds that perk automatically to the Player. Modders should not forget to add that Perk to the player and possibly to followers in their own mods![/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Change log[/b]\r\n1.1 - Changed the odd workaround for displaying magnitudes in the menu, they show correctly now in the Active Effects menu (albeit with a minus sign before them).",
