  "descriptionHtml": "I was tired of having to restart Helgen every time I wanted to make a new character or screwed up my modding list because I didn&#39;t save properly. So I made this clean save starting just after exiting the cave with Ralof. I eventually plan to make a clean save after exiting with Hadvar but I haven&#39;t gotten that far yet.\r<br />There&#39;s tons of these out there I know, but I&#39;ve had trouble with them because they were saved so long ago. This character is a female Nord. I will make one with each race and gender if anyone wants. Of course you can go into console and type showracemenu and change the character there.I did play this through using SKSE but there are no mods installed in this save. Have fun&#33;Â ",
