  "descriptionHtml": "I really liked the Orc race\\'s berserker rage power, and I tried making it a lesser power, but that seemed to make it more like a cheat spell, so I set about to make it more balanced that other races would benefit from it..\r\n\r\nThus the Berserk spell was created.\r\n\r\nWhat it does:\r\n\r\nDemonstration vid:\r\n[youtube]dAfwDPm23ss[/youtube]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bersek Spell costs 60 mana* and lasts for 9 seconds as opposed to the original Berserker rage which lasts for a minute. \r\nSimilarly when using the Berserk spell, the player\\'s physical damage is doubled. During the duration your mana regen is also hampered (this was to prevent spamming of the skill to keep it up indefinitely).\r\n\r\n*Why mana not stamina? \r\nThis spell is purely for warriors, since warriors don\\'t rely on their mana in battle(for the most part) it seemed to make more sense, since they\\'d need their stamina to power attack...\r\n\r\n\r\nhow to get it?\r\nFind the torn page near a small statue of Malacath above the orc Stronghold of Mor Khazgur in the west of skyrim..\r\nVideo of location:\r\n[youtube]bQYaaeqDvrI[/youtube]\r\n\r\nBut wait, why is just a torn page?\r\nWell, the whole spell tome is at the Shrine of Malacath in Giant\\'s Grove, only accessible during or after the Cursed Tribe quest.\r\nThe other spell, is called Rage of Malacath, it does the same, while healing the player a small amount and recharging the player\\'s stamina similar to the Redguard\\'s Adrenaline rush.\r\nThe spell costs more mana and the mana regen debuff lasts even longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon\\'t want to go all the trouble?\r\nThat\\'s fine with me..\r\njust open the console and type either:\r\nHelp \\\"rage of malacath\\\"\r\nthen type player.addspell <code>\r\nand/or:\r\nhelp \\\"berserk\\\" and do the same with that cod",
