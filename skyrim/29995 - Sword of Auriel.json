  "descriptionHtml": "Mod does not require Dawnguard to function, but does for authenticity.\r\n\r\n\tEver wanted Auri-El\\'s Armor, Sword, and Crown. Someone stole them from the Inner Sanctum some time ago, but was struck down when he raised his fist in diffidence to the Heaven.\r\n\r\n\tThe Armor and Sword are now locked in a Crystal at Deep Folk Crossing (See Picture).\r\n\tBeing the Sword of Auri-El Himself, it is recommended that you use wisdom in handling it lest you also be struck down.\r\n\r\n\tThe armor is just re-textured Daedric Armor, but it was the closest thing to what I could see of the culture of the Aedra Auri-El.\r\n\r\n[center][youtube]7Pn-_8QjBvE[/youtube][/center]\r\n\r\n\tI have now also made the Crown of Auriel.",
