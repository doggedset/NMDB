  "descriptionHtml": "Do you want the Dragon Infusion perk?\r<br />\r<br />Of course you do... because dragon attacks HURT LIKE OBLIVION&#33;\r<br />\r<br />But suppose you don&#39;t want anything to do with the Blades anymore because they want you to slaughter your old friend and mentor Paarthurnax...\r<br />\r<br />Those selfish bastards&#33;\r<br />\r<br />So how can you get the Dragon Infusion perk without Esbern to make his potion?\r<br />\r<br />Simple... you make it yourself.\r<br />\r<br />Because in his haste to leave his hidey-hole in the Riften sewers, addle-brained old Esbern left behind a crucial tidbit of information... the recipe for his potion&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds two new ingredients and recipes to make them, along with the recipe for the potion itself.  You&#39;ll find his notes on how to make it all in the crate next to Esbern&#39;s bed in his sewer hideout, partially covered by a book.\r<br />\r<br />The two new ingredients are Powdered Dragon Bone and Purified Dragon Scales, which Esbern&#39;s note will show you how to make.  Combined with other ingredients that will be listed, you&#39;ll be able to make Esbern&#39;s Potion without any help from the old man.  However, you will need his notes in your possession if you want to make it.  (Sorry, but it wouldn&#39;t be fair if you can make it right away after killing your first dragon.)\r<br />\r<br />Comments and endorsements are welcome.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy.",
