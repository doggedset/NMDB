  "descriptionHtml": "I was playing as a very godly and religious character, and wanted a player home that reflected that. So I made this small mod over the weekend. A quiet chapel out in the rift, long since abandoned and now overgrown with cobwebs and vines. No DLC required for this mod, purely stock vanilla content.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;There are three main rooms; a sanctuary, the priest&#39;s quarters, and the undertaker&#39;s office. I&#39;ve kept it simple, immersive, and lore friendly. No giant rooms full of mannequins or massive weapon displays. No forge or armor workbenches. You&#39;ve got a cooking stand, an alchemy stand, a bed, and a shrine, but that&#39;s about it in terms of &#34;features&#34;. Thankfully though, you&#39;re only a stone&#39;s throw away from Riften. \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Although I made this mod with a crusader-type dawnguard character in mind, this home would also work well for a vampire.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Let me know what you think in the comments&#33; If you&#39;d like to see something added or removed, let me know.",
