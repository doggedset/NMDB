This mod can be used without the original mod or USKP,[/size] [size=4]but without the USKP the Fortify Block enchantment will be the only enchantment that does[i] [b]not[/b][/i] benefit from Fortify Restoration unless you have another mod that changes that loaded after this one.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Â The only thing that was changed from the original mod was the &#34;Magic Skill&#34; field was changed from &#34;Restoration&#34; to &#34;None&#34; like the Unofficial Skyrim Patch. This will function without the original mod as this is simply an altered version of that mod&#39;s .esp file. I upload this because the last update to the original mod was in April of 2013 and I want people to be able to enjoy this mod without going \r<br />through extra hassle on their own to make it compatible with the USKP.\r<br />\r<br />In fact, I believe this should be part of the Unofficial Skyrim Patch, so if you believe the same go talk to the USKP people and let them know about it. Be sure to go to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34737/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D34737%26preview%3D&pUp=1]Fortify Weapon Block[/url]&#39;s original mod page and give an endorsement for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/101701/?]Ryuujin-0[/url]&#39;s work.\r<br />\r<br />From the original mod page:\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][i]Frankly I&#39;m amazed this mod hadn&#39;t been done already O,o\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]What&#39;s it do?[/b]\r<br />This mod makes one simple change - Fortify Block enchantments now apply to \r<br />ALL forms of blocking; one-handed, two-handed and shields (Even most \r<br />unarmed and dual wielding blocking with mods that support it) as opposed\r<br /> to vanilla Skyrim where it only applied to shield blocking.\r<br />\r<br />This applies to existing, standard block enchantments and for player enchanted items alike.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Is it compatible with...[/b]\r<br />Yes, it&#39;s just one simple change - enchanting rebalance mods may interfere \r<br />with it; in which case you can place it at the bottom of the load order \r<br />perfectly safely. Everything else it&#39;ll work fine with and can be freely\r<br /> removed at any time without causing any harm to your save file.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />...and that&#39;s all there is to it.         [/i][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I came across the original mod when I was looking for mods that would improve swordplay for people wanting to play characters that use a one handed weapon without a shield or spell. This fix supports those character types greatly, but still more is missing because there are no perks that benefit that playstyle. Therefore I recommend [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50046/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D50046%26preview%3D&pUp=1]Lopsided - Perks for empty left hands[/url] by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3065972/?]nauziem[/url]. It gives three perks for using one handed weapons in the right hand with nothing in the left. It is the most balanced approach to one handed perk mods that I have come across.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=4]MY OTHER MOD:[/size][/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63840/?] Better Magic Rebalanced[/url]",
