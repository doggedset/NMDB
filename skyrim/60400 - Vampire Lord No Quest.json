  "descriptionHtml": "got really sick of having to do a quest for the vampire lord ability every single play through . All other mods i found just made another quest to get it so i made this. There are 2 spell tomes next to skyforge in whiterun that will give the player this ability. One actually allows the transformation to take place, and the other gives you the starter spells for the vamp lord. Technically you can obtain these without even becoming a vampire if you&#39;d like.\r<br />\r<br />The tome that gives you the spells has a description about Khajiit claws. I believe this is due to the fact Bethesda used the same stronger unarmed attack effect on Khajiits as they did on the vampire lordÂ . Regardless, it all still works out\r<br />\r<br />*requires dawnguard, obviously.",
