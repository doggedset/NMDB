Unfortunately due to trademark issues, we&#39;ve had to rebrand the collection of cards. We asked you guys for ideas on new names and [b]Sheagoraths WappaPack[/b] was born (thanks [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/669024]Blood_Reaper[/url]).\r<br />\r<br />There are two project using the collection...\r<br />This [color=yellow][b]Sheagorath&#39;s WabbaPack PDF[/b][/color], which allows you to print the cards off and play with you friends (if you still have any after playing Skyrim for 2 years). This is the result of the hard work of the hugely talented [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1937550]MapleVolt[/url].\r<br />There is also the option to install an actual mod, so that you can collect [color=yellow][b]Sheagoraths WabbaPack in Game[/b][/color]. This feat of witchcraft is brought to you by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1398716]IceBurg[/url] (who has an understanding of the Mystical Creation Kit). Checkout the [b]Fantastic Sheogorath&#39;s WabbaPack Mod[/b]... COMING SOON\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]HOW TO USE [/color][/b]\r<br />It is a PDF. So just download and print.
