  "descriptionHtml": "This is just another city.  While it didn\\'t turn out quite as stunning as some of the others, I like it...particularly for indoors.  It is a bit over saturated on the exteriior, so it may or may not fit your tastes.  But this is how my Markarth would look.  :)  I imagine this place as being a marvel, and what better way for it to be spectacular and marvelous than to bring out the many colors?\r\nI hope you guys will enjoy this one, and please check out all of my other recolored towns.  :D\r\nAlso, I don\\'t have any before/after pics for now, but the difference is very visible.  :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPS:  Just an extra note....I will be submitting all of these cities together soon as a complete package.  I just have a few more holds to do, and it will be good to go.  :)",
