  "descriptionHtml": "update 1.2 fixes texture paths. sorry to those who had problems\r\nupdate. version 1.01 fixes the female clip issue\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered why no one wears sleeves in the northernmost province of tamriel?\r\nI have. In fact, i\\'d say it is downright ludicrous and immersion shattering.\r\ni live in New Jersey. Its certainly not a nordic climate but during fall and winter its cold and you need not only long sleeves, but hoodies and coats and even hats sometimes.\r\nObviously it was a stylistic choice and i think an unfortunate one. Imagine if they went to town crafting armours and clothes that were warm and kept the denizens of skyrim bundled up. It would certainly add to immersion and give skyrim its own unique personality.\r\nI have long sought to rectify this situation and as i learn more about modding i can fix armours and create new ones that fit the climate of skyrim.\r\nHere is steel armour. a plugin-less replacer.\r\n\r\nThe steel armour is simply with sleeves added however the banded steel has more additions than just sleeves. it is sleeves added to nordic steel armour from THusky\\'s morrowind armour\\'s mod.\r\n\r\nIt is compatible with retextures. it is for now only working on vanilla bodies so if you use big boobs replacers you will notice the boobs shrink when you put on this armor\r\n\r\nI have included a picture with the heaviest female size, there is some clipping on bicep area. i am working on that but for medium and smaller females this isnt an issue (resolved)\r\n\r\n",
