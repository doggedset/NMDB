  "modId": 22194.0,
  "modName": "Concealed Enemy Names",
  "summary": "How do you know that the mage you are about to fight focusses on ice? Right, the name tells you.\r\nWhat kind of spells will the \\\"adept fire mage\\\" over there use? Hmm....\r\n \r\ni felt it is illogical and immersion breaking. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "As soon as you engange a target or a target detects you, you will see the enemy\\'s name.\r\n The problem is, that the enemy\\'s name gives away too much information regarding the attacks you will be confronted with. \r\n\r\nSo i decided to change names like \\\"Ice Mage Adept\\\" to \\\"Mage\\\". So you can no longer know which kind of spells the mage who is about to attack you is going to use. (Until the mage attacks)\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this mod and -please- tell me what you think about it!\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nUnpack the Archive and place the .ESP file into your skyrim/data folder. Activate the ESP and you\\'re done :)\r\n\r\n!!Please note that this is my first mod, so i advice you to backup your game before using this mod, better safe than sorry. (Although i cannot see how this mod could break something as i only changed the names of enemies)!!\r\n\r\nI am really intrested in what YOU think about this mod, so leave a comment, i will try to check commets as often as possible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\nOriginal Version (1.0)\r\n\r\nWerewolf Bosses to Werewolf\r\nElements and kinds of mages to \\\"mage\\\"\r\nBoss-Mages called \\\"Warlock\\\"\r\nkinds of vampires to \\\"vampire\\\"\r\nkinds of necromancers to \\\"necromancer\\\"\r\nSpriggan and Spriggan Matros-> Spriggan\r\nWarrior/Brawler orcs to \\\"orc\\\" (Not sure whether i did that...But the general name is being used anyway. )\r\nkinds of Forsworn changed to \\\"forsworn\\\" \r\nkinds of Falmer to \\\"falmer\\\"\r\ndwarven centurion and dwarven centurion master to  \\\"dwarven centurion\\\"\r\nSpriggan and Spriggan Matron to \\\"Spriggan\\\"\r\nChaurus and Chaurus reaper to \\\"Chaurus\\\"\r\n\r\n(Special names like \\\"Mistwatch Bandit\\\" and \\\"Volkihar Vampire\\\" are still working)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n\r\nBoss-Necromancers called \\\"Warlock\\\" instead of \\\"Necromancer\\\"\r\nsome inconsistencies between \\\"Warlock\\\" and \\\"mage\\\" fixed \r\nno element differences between Atronachs  (shouldnt be hard to distinguish fire from storm)\r\nforsworn remained some names, should be fixed now. \r\nAll kinds of Draugr to \\\"Draugr\\\" \r\nAll kinds of \\\"Afflicted\\\" to \\\"Afflicted\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOptional File (Removed enemy and impersonal names completely)\r\n\r\nremoved the names of:\r\n-All \\\"always hostile\\\" creatures/humans  (i.e. bandits, forsworn, bears, spiders...those.)\r\n-Guards (you should know in which hold you\\'re currently in! Banners, shields can help you out as well)\r\n-non-relevant or obvious names (Imperial Soldier, Stormcloaks, Imperial/Stormcloak Archer/soldiers,  hunters...etc)\r\n-Volikhar vampires and Mistwatch bandits \r\n-Thieves, Assassins,Bounty Hunters and Treaure Hunters are no longer obvious :)\r\n-\\\"horse\\\" (for carriage) name is removed as well. Should be pretty much obvious what that horse-ish     looking, horse-ish smelling, horse-ish sounding animal is. (Hint: not a Falmer)\r\n-same as above for chicken, regular dragons....\r\n-Player summons like Player\\'s wolf spirit\r\n-Courier \r\n-Thugs and Hired Thugs\r\n\r\nuntouched:\r\nNPCs you may need to talk to and NPCs with real names\r\n\r\n!!!There is a sideeffect of this optional file: You can no longer actively start a conversation with somebody who had his name removed (obvious example: guards). However, they will still talk to you when you commit a crime or when you stand close to them (same comments as if you talked to them). \r\n!!However, you will also be unable to loot those enemie without names. i know this is a major flaw, but i cannot prevent this from happening. !!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might also be interested in my other mod:\r\nConcealed Ingredient Names\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22649",
