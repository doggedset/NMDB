There&#39;s about 5 laying around and if you&#39;re really lazy there&#39;s one in the Qasmoke cell near the Dragonborn chests just past the doorway. \r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s a wee bit better than the Chitin shield and a wee bit heavier but it&#39;s still classed asÂ  a light shield. Yes it doesn&#39;t look much in first person but that&#39;s not my fault, I&#39;m hoping there&#39;s some Ash Hopper Retex&#39;s out there to ease the eye burn. \r<br />\r<br />Right that&#39;s your lot, enjoy your new shield and if you ask nicely I&#39;ll probably make some weapons out of Scribs.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232]If you have the Hi-Res textures DLC, it would make the Scrib Shield look less blurry. [/color]\r<br />\r<br />Until next time.\r<br />Muddy. ",
