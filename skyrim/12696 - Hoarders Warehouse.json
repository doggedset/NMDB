  "summary": "Large Stronghold that is high up in the mountains.  Great place to store all of your weapons, armor, and other misc. items.  Also has multiple trainers, a merchant and every work room possible.  Also some specialized spells that you can only obtain here.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'m currently doing a huge overhaul on this mod based on feedback.  I want to make this the ultimate player stronghold available.  The location/landscaping is HORRIBLE and that is definitely something I want to work on; but there will be much more updated.  Stay tuned....\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nV 0.2\r\nUpdated landscaping\r\nUpdated lighting\r\nFixed ceilings\r\nGot rid of stairs leading up the mountain; I\\'ve made it easier.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nDragon Mask Display\r\nOver 100 Weapon Racks\r\nOver 20 Mannequins\r\n20 Dagger Display Cases (with activators)\r\nOver 10 Bookshelves\r\n2 Unique Spells\r\nTrainers:\r\nSmithing\r\nAlchemy\r\nEnchanting\r\nOnehanded\r\nTwohanded\r\nPickpocket\r\nMerchant\r\nEvery Guardian Stone\r\nEvery Shrine\r\n\r\nExterior is WIP, but I’m sure you’ll be impressed;  I placed it very high and had to get carried away with the stairs, but the map marker you travel to should prevent you from having to climb the stairs each time you arrive.\r\n\r\nThere are some bugs and would love to hear your feedback.  I’m constantly working on this project.",
