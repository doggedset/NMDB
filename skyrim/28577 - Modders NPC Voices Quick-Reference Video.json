  "summary": "Please note: this is not a mod. A simple and small reference for modders of Skyrim that would like to preview the voices they are giving to their Actors. I couldn\\'t find any way to do so without actually setting the voice and visiting the actor - and it seems no-one has uploaded something like this anywhere so - enjoy, and happy modding.",
