  "descriptionHtml": "If you would like her as a companion I made an updated version of her here [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26056]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26056[/url]!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\\'ve done a few characters from Game of Thrones already and really wanted to do Daenerys, but I couldn\\'t get it to where I was happy with it on my own. Then I saw the great version gdulal did and thought it was really close, so I used his version as a base and made a few small changes. \r\nMy version uses a purple eye texture and a modified eyebrow texture, I think it adds a nice touch to her and makes her look a bit younger.\r\n\r\nSave is level 1 right after the dragon attack. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor now I am just uploading a default eye texture I changed colors quickly, but if i get permission from xenius I will upload one of his high quality eye textures for people who are using his eye mod.\r\n\r\nFor the eyebrow I used the default texture and changed its position a little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:The textures will also affect npcs that use them, so expect to see some npcs with the same eyes as you and females with eyebrows a little off. I havent seen any yet, but if it is really distracting let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to gdulal for his version of daenerys, check it out [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1413]here[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center]If you liked this check out my other characters[/center]\r\n[center][url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1131]Khal Drogo[/url] /  [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1012]Jaime Lannister[/url] /  [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=972]Eddard Stark[/url] /  [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2157]Spartacus[/url] /  [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6036]Thor[/url] / [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5964]Megan Fox[/url][/center] \r\n\r\n",
