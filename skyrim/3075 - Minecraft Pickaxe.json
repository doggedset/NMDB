While the models and textures in this mod are very similar to the models from Minecraft, they are not copies. I created these models and textures myself and it took much time. While I appreciate Mojang\\'s creation of the game, I am the sole creator of these models and textures.\r\n\r\n~LoganZezima\r\n",
