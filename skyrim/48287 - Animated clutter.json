  "summary": "Several static objects are now animated, as they should be",
  "descriptionHtml": "The mod adds opening/closing and idle animations to several objects that should be animated in my opinion for the sake of greater “realism”.\r<br />Consider 1.9 the final update. The only static containers remaining are corpses and they should probably stay that way.\r<br />\r<br />1.9\r<br />Now included:\r<br />common barrel has opening/closing animations\r<br />thiefs guild cache has opening/closing animations\r<br />wrapped draugr have opening/closing animations\r<br />orc end table has opening/closing sounds\r<br />noble chest has opening/closing sounds (Old hroldan)\r<br />orc shack doors have opening/closing sounds (Largashbur)\r<br />spider sack 1.9 improved\r<br />dwemer dresser added closing sound\r<br />solitude palace inner door added opening/closing sounds\r<br />Sovngarde mead barrels\r<br />Winterhold trap door has opening/closing animation\r<br />imperial wall button animates properly when activated\r<br />wall cage has opening/closing sounds\r<br />Whiterun underforge doors have opening/closing animations\r<br />Solitude burial urn has opening/closing animation (solitude catacombs)\r<br />Dwemer coffins have opening/closing animations\r<br />Riften coffin has opening/closing animation\r<br />Whiterun coffin has opening/closing animation\r<br />Imperial sewer entrance\r<br />Imperial well entrance\r<br />Imperial trap doors\r<br />Katariah trap doors\r<br />Noble coffin\r<br />Poor coffin\r<br />Falmer chest and tribal falmer chest opening/closing\r<br />Doors in Windhelm Gray Quarters now animate when opening\r<br />satchel, knapsack animates when opening/closing\r<br />trapdoor to the basement in your home if you have Hearthfires\r<br />large ships, Katariah have idle animation (minor clipping with objects on ships)\r<br />ship trap door\r<br />Riften sewer entrance\r<br />all sacks from vanilla game\r<br />Strongbox has opening/closing sounds\r<br />Winterhold bookcase has opening/closing sounds\r<br />Dwemer convector has opening/closing sounds\r<br />Wall behind doors when entering ford Dawnguard is no longer visible\r<br />Elder scroll chest (which Valerica opens in Soul Cairn) has opening/closing sounds\r<br />Farmhouse trap door improved animation\r<br />Coffin has opening/closing animation\r<br />Albino spider sack has opening/closing animation\r<br />Beehive - for this I’ve done something different ;)\r<br />\r<br />The only reason this modular installer exists is because kevkas was kind enough to make it and deserves a bag of cookies :)\r<br />\r<br />Incompatibilities with mods:\r<br />This is a mesh replacer, it doesn’t and won’t include esp files\r<br />I personally use SMIM, ELFX and water and terrain enhancement redux. Had no issues with any of them, but since i don’t use parallax, the meshes don’t point to parallax maps if you use texture overhauls with parallax support. I don’t think you are gonna miss parallax on containers or doors, but if you do, you can add the texture location to a mesh pretty easy, I’m not gonna explain how. I don’t follow the water mod updates, so I don’t know what meshes it includes, but if you are skeptical I suggest not using ship meshes from this mod.\r<br />\r<br />BTW, please understand that these are my personal preferences in speed, size, type of animation, etc. so there is too much work for me in changing them or making optional speed changes\r<br />\r<br />Installation: just replace the default mesh in your folder structure\r<br />\r<br />If I eventually find anything that bothers me, I’ll add it. I would like to thank everybody for endorsing/downloading/liking this. It’s always nice if your stuff is appreciated.\r<br />Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />If you think something obvious (container, door) isn’t animated and should be in the main game or extensions, let me know\r<br />",
