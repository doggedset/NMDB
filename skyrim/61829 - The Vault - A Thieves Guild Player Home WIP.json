The mod itself is a small player home for members of the thieves guild situated within the basement of an abandoned house in Whiterun. The house itself is located just behind the marketplace. Just walk toward the Bannered Mare and head right. The home is accessed via a false wall in the basement. As far as player homes go, it&#39;s not swarming with advanced features but it is functional and should provide the feeling of a secure and hidden location. This is the goal of this particular player home - to provide a safe space for larcenous individuals to disappear.Â  \r<br />\r<br />Currently anyone can access the player home but once I get used to the creation kit and creating quests, I intend to include a small quest and a little back story toward the end of or on completion the Thieves Guild quest line.[/size] [size=3]Just now, the home contains;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][/center]\r<br />[list][*][size=3]A Shrine of Nocturnal[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=3]Safe Storage[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=3]Living amenities\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=3]Thieves cache[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=3]Weapon racks\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=3]Safety mechanisms (it&#39;s not called the vault for nothing)[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list][size=3]\r<br />With regards to the last point, the player home has two portcullises that serve as an inner security system. If these portcullises are shut when you enter the basement, you will not be able to access the main area. To counter this, and to provide some notion of common sense - there is a small button next to the shelf in the basement on the floor, this will release the gates and allow you to enter. The gates also have a chain on the other side.\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#cc0000][size=2]More features TBA*[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][url=http://s674.photobucket.com/user/Tingebert/media/requirements2_zps2c7c70d8.png.html][img]http://i674.photobucket.com/albums/vv105/Tingebert/requirements2_zps2c7c70d8.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This mod requires no DLC or other plugins. Files that alter the space in which the abandoned house appears will probably conflict with it. I hope that you enjoy the mod. Constructive feedback or advice is very much welcome as I&#39;m still getting used to using the creation kit and all that entails.[/size]",
