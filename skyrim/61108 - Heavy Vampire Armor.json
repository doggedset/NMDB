  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=4]Note: Anyone willing to alter the model of this armor set in any way to make it resemble Heavy Armor more is welcome to, however please contact me first.\r<br />[/size][/b]\r<br />[size=3]When playing the Dawnguard DLC and siding with the Vampires of Volkihar, I always felt disgruntled as to why there was no Heavy variant of the Vampire Armor. I felt as if I was missing out on this awesome new set of armor just because my character wasn&#39;t trained in Light Armor. No longer.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]For all those people like me, who weren&#39;t able to use the Vampire Armor, I&#39;ve added a brand new set of Vampire Royal Armor that can be found on the far right-hand side of the main table in Volkihar Keep (see screenshots.) This new set of armor has been altered to mirror the stats of the Blades Armor, whilst retaining the exact look and feel of the Vampire Armor from Dawnguard. The enchantment on the chestpiece has also been altered. No longer does it increase your Magicka Regen rate, it now boasts a 20-point Health boost to better cater to the needs of Heavy Armor users. Bare in mind, this new armor [/size][b][i][size=4]does not[/size][/i] [/b][size=3]alter the appearance of the Vampire Royal Armor in any way, it merely changes the stats.\r<br />\r<br />This is my very first mod, so any feedback, evenÂ criticism, would be appreciated so long as it tells me how I can improve. In case you haven&#39;t guessed, my mod does [/size][size=4]require the Dawnguard DLC [/size][size=3]in order to function, as without the DLC, the Vampire Armor is not present in the first place.[/size]",
