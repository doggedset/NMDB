Ok, don&#39;t panic, reload the &#34;before I screwed up&#34; save you made earlier and try again. Don&#39;t skip any steps.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Q: I have vanishing floors/walls/parts of the house when I move around it&#33; They reappear when I head for that part of the house&#33; Whats going on?&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[/size]A: Another mod is adding occlusion planes to Hjerim. The usual culprit is Skyrim Project Optimization. Use the &#34;No Player Homes&#34; version instead. \r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Q: Help&#33; My kids won&#39;t go to bed&#33; They just stand around in the room all night long&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />A: Use the &#34;wait&#34; key to advance time 1 hour. If that fails move the kids out to another player house and then move them back in. Also make sure you have no killable kiddie mods active. [size=3]Still not working?[/size] You almost certainly have a mod conflict. Try to disable one by one any other mods that affect children, spouses (NOT multiple adoptions mod), houses, etc. Theres no magic wand to wave here you&#39;re just going to have to track it down, 100+ endorsements at the time of writing from people with not troubles means the problem is almost certainly at your end, sorry.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Q: Do I need to use the &#34;Bless Home&#34; spell to move all 6 kids into the house?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />A: No, this is a vanilla home so it shouldn&#39;t be needed unless you&#39;re having problems purchasing the child bedroom. Just move the kids in and they should all find their beds when they need to sleep.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Q: The trapdoor/other thing to Dovahkin Hideout/other mod is covered by the staircase&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />A: There are millions of mods and not all are compatible with the remodelled layout of Hjerim. In most cases you should be able to move the trapdoor/other item somewhere more convenent with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52583]Jaxonz Positioner[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Q: Wheres the Forge gone?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />A: Its been relocated to the basement, see the trap door just outside the children&#39;s bedroom.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Notes[/u]\r<br />[u]Changes to original Hjerim TNF mod[/u]\r<br />Massively expanded child bedroom now has sleeping arrangements for six\r<br />Relocated Housecarl&#39;s room to (former) hidden room\r<br />Moved forge to new basement area\r<br />Added two extra dining chairs to accomodate 6 children\r<br />Overhauled the lighting to try and avoid conflicts (flickering walls/floors/objects)",
