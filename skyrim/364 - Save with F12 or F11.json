  "descriptionHtml": "In Fallout NV there was a mod that allowed you to make a new save simply by pressing F12.\r\n\r\nI missed this in Skyrim, so I decided to make an alternative solution. This is an AutoHotkey script that sends the necessary keys to make a new save, by pressing F12.\r\n\r\nMade a 2nd script that uses F11, as apparently the default key for screenshots in Steam is F12 and I assume plenty of people are used to this. Choose either version and simply run it, doesn\\'t matter where you run it from.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\nIt\\'s an AutoHotkey script made into an executable, so all you have to do is execute it. You can start it before, or while the game is already running. It works by quickly sending Escape (Open Menu), then E (Goto Save ), S (Go down to New Save), E (Create New Save) and thus making a fresh new save game in less than a second. \r\n\r\nThis is a small step to preventing you from getting RSI and a fast and easy way to make a new save game.\r\nThe script only works in Skyrim, so the F12 key behaves normally outside of the game.\r\n\r\nIn the Zip folder I also included the Script itself (AHK file), which you can edit in Notepad, for instance when you want to use a different key than F12 or F11. You will then need to install AutoHotkey to compile the file into an executable script yourself.\r\n",
