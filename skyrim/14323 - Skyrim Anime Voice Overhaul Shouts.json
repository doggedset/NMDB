  "descriptionHtml": "Contains Semi-adult content (She got racy in the throw voice taunts)\r\n\r\nI have started working to overhaul the voices in skyrim to be more anime and even tweak dialogue a bit but not stray to far from the original.\r\nThese files replace all the shouts and the voice throw sounds to sound more anime.\r\n\r\nDemo Video   http://www.twitch.tv/maveric83eq/b/313842732\r\n\r\nThe throw voice is definitely worth the mod imo\r\n\r\nIf you know anyone interested or are yourself in helping overhaul the audio there are literally 30k audio files per gender. I am only working on the female roles atm, but if any male VA\\'s want to do a lot of the legwork themselves, I would be more than happy to package it along side.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Warning- I do not know how the mod manager works as I have never used it personally, I do everything manually. The file is just a .7z file with audio for the data folder.  If its compatible with that well then use away. This is my first mod ever uploading in case it wasn\\'t apparent :)\r\n\r\nOk mod manager d/l doesn\\'t work yet will work on it later tonight and figure out how to do it\r\n\r\nEDIT- Screw the gd mod manager unless someone wants to tell me directly how to get it to work. I don\\'t feel like d/l it and risking 3 gigs of mods I already have installed so bleh.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther files uploaded\r\n\r\nSexy Lydia Voiceover    http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14622",
