  "descriptionHtml": "Uploaded so the requester can examine the facial scales due to an interest in my feminine Orcs. She is saved just after the Helgen tutorial and followed the Stormcloak prisoner rather than the Imperial out of Helgen.\r\n\r\nNo levels ups/skill points have been used, no console cheats or adds have been used, and this save will work with vanilla Skyrim and should also work with modded combinations.\r\n\r\nTo get her as she appears in the screenshots, pick up the following mods.\r\n\r\nCBBE v3 (also get v2 hip compatibility patch)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nBetter Females by Bella (also get the \\\"no shine\\\" option pack)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nFor the modded armor shown get Killer Keos Armor Pack\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3654\r\n\r\nTo install, just drop into your Skyrim/Saves directory.\r\n\r\nTo those of you who have downloaded my companion mods (several of them have well over 1K downloads and counting) I just want you to know that I haven\\'t forgotten about you guys. As soon as I get some spare time to work in the CK; I\\'ll be rolling out more companions for you guys to play around with.\r\n\r\nThanks for all of the downloads, and thanks for the endorsements...more stuff coming soon.",
