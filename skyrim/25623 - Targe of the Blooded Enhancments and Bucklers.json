  "descriptionHtml": "This is for the buckler mod. my \\\"vanilla\\\" targe can be found here: (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25674), or check my other mods section for it...\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTHIS IS MY FIRST MOD that ive decided to upload. noticed a few requests for a better Spiked Shield, and decided id upload what i use in my game. it should be compatible with all other mods unless they change the vanilla targe of the blooded (and associated perks/spells), or the ysgrmor enchantment the only thing i changed on the Spiked Shield is the mesh/ texture(wood looks more burnt), the basic info (weight, armor, etc) and the spell damage thats added to it. the reflect dmg enchantment on the spiked and orcish buckler is a modified version of the same perk, the ebony and orcish bucklers are seprate non replacers, each with their own meshes, and recipes for crafting. they use the same textures as their vanilla counterparts.\r\n\r\nALL BUCKLERS ARE LIGHT ARMOR\r\n\r\nSPIKED BUCKLER REPLACES THE VANILLA TARGE OF THE BLOODED SHIELD \r\n\r\nI ALSO MADE A SEPERATE MOD THAT ADDS JUST THE VANILLA TARGE W/ optional BLACK/BURNT TEXTURE, AND ENHANCMENTS (reflect dmg/spellbreaker), WHICH IS CRAFTABLE.\r\n\r\nif anything is conflicting, let me know. yes i know the targe is small. i prefer it that way if you dont, say something, and i might make another thats larger. \r\n\r\n\r\nEnhances the selected shields and turns them into bucklers.\r\n\r\nTarge of the Blooded: (mainly for parrying, similiar to dagger shields)\r\n          -Doubles the bleeding damage from bashing which stacks\r\n          -Reflects damage from attackers hitting your spikes\r\n          -Reduces size considerably and moves it to your forearm(if requested, might make it bigger)\r\n\r\nEbony: (mage defense)\r\n          -moved to forearm\r\n          -added shield of ysgramor enchantment\r\n          -disenchantable\r\n\r\nOrcish: (melee defense, alt to targe)\r\n          -Reflects damage same as targe\r\n          -reduced size slightly, moved to forearm\r\n\r\nall shelds can be crafted and tempered with respective perks. TO TEMPER YOU NEED ARCANE BLACKSMITH PERK.\r\n\r\n\r\nfuture plans:\r\n-originally, i was trying to find a way to make deflecting arrows easier, more guaranteed when blocking,and ended up just doing this, if you have any ideas for how to do this, please let me know.\r\n-i dont know yet how to do glowmapping(i think thats what its called) but i would like to add runes to at least the ebony shield that glow in the dark\r\n\r\nChange Log: if any problems please notify me and i will try to fix ASAP\r\n----- Added new optional file with targe buckler (lil bigger) with blades that stick out the front. \r\n1.2 - fixed various issues. should be working fine now.\r\n1.1 - fixed texture folder issue for the \\\"burnt\\\" targe texture not working properly\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPERMISSION:  If you want to uses my mod in yours, let me know and ill add a link to yours in my description, and give me credit where credits due...",
