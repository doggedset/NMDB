  "summary": "A standalone mod that improves upon the vanilla version of Camilla Valerius without the need for any addition hair or body mods.",
  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />     Since the vanilla wife selection totally blows, I thought I&#39;d share this custom version of Camilla Valerius with you guys. It doesn&#39;t totally redo her, it just fixes some things about her vanilla model. Camilla is my favorite spouse and I hated that she looked like a depressed clown. So, I used NPC editor to tweak her up a bit. (NPC Editor is awesome, go check it out.) Unlike other Nexus mods for Camilla, this one requires no other hair, body, clothing or anything mods to work, and it keeps the classic Camilla look, with a few modifications. Enjoy, and let me know what you think.",
