  "descriptionHtml": "*Requires Danwguard and Dragonborn DLC to work normally*\r\n\r\nHave you ever wanted to start a new game in Skyrim, but don\\'t want to do all those Greybeards and Whiterun b*llsh*t? I know I have! \r\n\r\nThis save skips all the boring stuff and starts you off with the quest \\\"Diplomatic Immunity\\\".\r\n*I also have the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller with me, so you can complete the Greybeards stuff*\r\n\r\nIt\\'s recommended you have SKSE if you want to use the save properly. \r\n\r\nAs for the character, Amaya Rin (Cold Night Rain), she doesn\\'t really specialize in anything particular. \r\n\r\nTo the get the same look as in the screenshot, you will require over 70 mods to achieve that. If you want a list, open the save in WyreBash and look at the .esp\\'s etc.. \r\n\r\nI\\'m also taking requests for different character looks. Just post a comment and I\\'ll see what I can do ;)\r\n\r\n",
