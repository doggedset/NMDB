  "summary": "Simple mod that ups the values of Dwarven objects to be somewhat similar to their Morrowind counterparts. It turns the vanilla junk into treasure worthy of being carried around.",
  "descriptionHtml": "For all of us nostalgic Morrowind players, vanilla Skyrim Dwarven items are pretty useless. In Morrowind, Dwarven items were a hot commodity and extremely valuable because they were outlawed. It was actually worth it to pick these items up and sell them. Morrowindized Dwarven Objects (MDO) seeks to bring back the sense of immersion and value to the numerous Dwarven misc. objects around Skyrim.\r\n\r\nAll Dwarven objects are covered with the exception of armor and weapons, but I will cover those as well and Morrowindize them if requested. I altered the weights of a few objects so you could stockpile them and bring out great hauls from ruins. MDO shouldn\\'t conflict with anything and it should effect the DLCs just fine as well.\r\n\r\n-Future Plans-\r\no Morrowindize armor and weapons if requested\r\no Adjust values and weights according to feedback\r\no Add Dwemer coins just like Morrowind\r\n\r\n-Other Mods-\r\n*Skyrim*\r\nLeaps Of Skyrim\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32589\r\n\r\nThe Hole In The Wall- Thief Hideout\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31024\r\n\r\nThe Mage\\'s Gorge\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32897\r\n\r\nHunter\\'s Abode- The Lodge\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35030\r\n\r\nDragonborn Hall\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35306\r\n\r\n*Fallout 3*\r\nUCO-Urban Combat Overhaul\r\nhttp://fallout3.nexusmods.com/mods/19129\r\n\r\n*Fallout: New Vegas*\r\nCompact Homes-New Vegas Edition\r\nhttp://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/50141",
