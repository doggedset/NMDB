  "descriptionHtml": "This is done without the authors permission. There are a lot of posts on the mod author\\'s mod page about this. However, there has been no response. If the mod author comes back and wants me to remove this and/or fixes the issue I have no problem with removing it.\r\n\r\nThe original mod is required and can be found here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25029/?\r\n\r\nThis is a patch for the enhanced version.\r\nJust replace that esp with this esp.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the issue that BOSS pointed out about the deleted NAVMESH. You should no longer CTD at the Moorside Inn. As a side benefit I also removed the identical master records.",
