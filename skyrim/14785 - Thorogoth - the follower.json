  "summary": "Adds Thorogoth as a follower",
  "descriptionHtml": "After years of money saved from his hunting, Thorogoth hired a partner.  He Then started making more and more money till he had a team of hunters to do his work for him.  He then set up a base of operations close to his best friend and the savior of his business, Alvor.  As he gathered more and more hunters he had to do less and less work.  This gave him time to practice with his bow and soon his reputation started to grow.  He purchased a set of armor and started his life as a hunter for hire.  As long as they have the coin, anyone can hire him to hunt anything.  \r\n\r\nSo this mod adds a base outside of Riverwood that houses Thorogoth (from my alternative start save) and his hunters.  He has a full set of elven armor and an elven bow.  \r\n\r\nBugs/Issues/Questions\r\nIf there are any problems or general questions feel free to voice them in the comments section which I will try to check often",
