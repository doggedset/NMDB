  "modName": "Script -- Individual Item Auto Sorter",
  "summary": "Two scripts:  One sorts items out the other brings the items back.\r<br />Non-playable testing cell to showcase the scripts in action.",
  "descriptionHtml": "There have been a couple individuals that expressed a desire to be able to sort items across multiple containers. Specifically they wanted to have one item per container. I offered to make the script. This then is the result. I am posting here so that others may benefit and use these scripts if they&#39;d like.\r<br />\r<br />Tutorial instructions on how to setup & modify the script for other item types is included in the modders resource download.\r<br />\r<br />Instructions on how to access the testing cell and the features found within are included in the non-playable testing cell download. See the pictures for an idea of what is included in the testing cell.\r<br />\r<br />I have no intentions of taking the testing cell further into a playable home, therefore feel free to do so if you wish. \r<br />\r<br />Feel free to comment in the comment section if you need assistance with modifying the scripts for your uses. I&#39;ll try to help if I can.\r<br />\r<br />All I ask is credit and a link to your mod so that I may add it here.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE:\r<br />Forgot to mention in the included documentation that if you do modify the script it would be a good idea to rename it. Just in case other mods use the script too.  Don&#39;t want one mod not working cause another changed the script behavior.\r<br />\r<br />DISCLAIMER:\r<br />This may seem similar to Sjogga&#39;s scripts & tutorial listed here: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24678]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24678[/url]. However, I did not use his tutorial and he should be aware that I had already worked on a similar technique based on the two posts in [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/754151-tutorials-without-youtoob/page__view__findpost__p__6348175]this thread[/url]. This is merely a modification of my own work from having learned how to transfer items by working with Manilla Turtle&#39;s scripts from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12468]Automatic Storage[/url] for my mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22944]Automatic Storage for Vidani&#39;s Bag of Holding[/url]\r<br />",
