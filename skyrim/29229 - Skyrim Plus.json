  "summary": "Just a little mod that overhauls skyrim, in simple terms. There is 2 more extra files (exact same files, mainly but with CBBE armors and CBBE body.) Dear nexus moderators and modders, if I have done anything mod, please warn me or pm me, I will humbly fix it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "There are 2 files, 1 which contains ALL the files to put in the data, 1 mesh, 1 texture, etc files for each mod, and TONS of esps. You just drag these into your skyrim data directory. C:\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data. Drag ALL of these files into the data, then it will ask to merge the meshes and textures, say yes to all. You CAN NOT install this with modmanager, therfore it is VERY hard to uninstall. BUT, there is a seperate file that will allow you to install multiple rars using nexus mod manager, now time for the list of about 30 credits :)\r\nThere ya go, 1-2 GB of mods :) Seriously, do we need mods that took 3 mins to compress? and NINE THOUSAND lines of voiced text :)\r\n\r\n",
