  "descriptionHtml": "Updated Description #2:\r\n\r\nFor an updated savegame, and for all future updated savegames, go to this link below:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2289\r\n\r\nUpdated Description:\r\n\r\nI have not done too much in the quests or missions in this save and the other one, but I now own all houses and have better stats. I figured people might want to check out the houses in the game to see what each one offers before you just go and buy one - since the way to get each house is basically the same, might as well chose the one you want.\r\n\r\nHouses (wih all upgrades):\r\n\r\nWhiterun - Breezehome\r\n\r\nRiften - Honeyside\r\n\r\nMarkarth - Vlindrel Hall\r\n\r\nWindhelm - Jherim\r\n\r\nSolitude - Proudspire Manor\r\n\r\nI still haven\\'t joined the Stormcloaks or Imperials yet, and the houses are fairly well stocked (I have at least 10 of all ingredients somewhere in each house - except Riften, I have the 10 of each on me but have been having issues with my ps3 controller working on my pc, so have been trying to get that fixed... I also have a lot of good weapons in the houses).\r\n\r\nOld Description:\r\n\r\nI lost my head by using tim (Immortal Mode) by having a Dragon eat me and then a Bandit cut it off after the Dragon spit me out, using tim I am like an essential NPC - everything works like normal except I won\\'t die.\r\n\r\nI have quite a lot done in the game, but nothing completely finished, I have also not chosen a side yet (Imperial or Stormcloak).\r\n\r\nI was experimenting in my leveling so it is kind of inconsistent, but mainly I am a mage, with decent one-handed. I am max on enchantment, above 90 on Alchemy, above 90 on Blacksmithing, high on sneak, and a lot others. I am uploading this strictly by request from someone on the Steam forums. \r\n\r\nI own the house in Solitude (which is where most of my stuff is - check everywhere) Proudspire Manor,  Breezeway in Whiterun, and just got the house in Markarth (Vindrel Hall) which has some items in it.\r\n\r\nI have used a lot of mods, so vanilla Skyrim might not work, but I would assume it would. I didn\\'t save a new game with no mods, but if someone wants me to I can - let me know if you have issues.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.",
