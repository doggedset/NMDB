  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />[b][size=4]Paradox Werewolf Changes - Exit on Demand[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod is a part of a set of mini-mods I have made for werewolves. \r<br />\r<br />It allows you to change out of Werewolf Beast Form early by sheathing your weapons (which allows first person view) and then changing to first person view.\r<br />\r<br />This can be used on its own to allow you to end Werewolf Beast Form without having to use “waiting” or it can be used with my other mod “PWC - Permanent Werewolf” that will keep you in Werewolf Beast Form permanently.\r<br />\r<br />This mod does not modify any of the werewolf scripts, spells or quests. Its only requirements to work are that the method to exit Werewolf Beast Form contained in the werewolf quest is unchanged (that is, that stage 100 starts the exit)",
