Each of them have two different glows you can pick from. There is a standard white glow, and then a dark blue glow (when Cloud is low on HP, the blade glows blue) you can pick. The glow is only visible at night/in shadowed areas, the blade in the day time is transparent.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, bug or glitch reports, leave it in the comments or contact me.\r\n\r\nINSTALL:\r\nOpen the rar, and pick which version you want (two handed or one handed)\r\nthen pick the glow color you want. Open the folder of the selected color choice, and drag those contents into your Skyrim\\\\Data folder.
