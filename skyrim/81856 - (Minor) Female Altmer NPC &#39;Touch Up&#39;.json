  "summary": "This mod changes the appearance of certain female altmer within the base game, made to look younger generally more attractive. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "A friend of mine asked me to &#34;pretty up&#34; some of the female altmer in Skyrim as a favour. So I went into the creation kit and did a touch up on a few of the characters (listed below).\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Taarie, Tailor in Solitude\r<br />[*]Endarie, Tailor in Solitude\r<br />[*]Nirya, Sorceress in the College of Winterhold\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Beauty is a subjective thing, so not everyone will find the changes to their liking. I have kept the changes minimal so that the character remains more or less the same (with exception to Nirya).Â This was intended for one person, but anyone is free to install the mod. If you do like what I did or have feedback on my stylistic choices, leave a comment and a rating based on how you feel about the mod.\r<br />\r<br />An additional note: I made a minor alteration to the quest &#34;Fit for a Jarl&#34; so that upon completion, Taarie&#39;s disposition towards you will increase as I felt it was lacking in the vanilla version.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks&#33;",
