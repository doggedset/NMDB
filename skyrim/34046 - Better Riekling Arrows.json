  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Description[/b]\r\nThis will change the Riekling \"Spears\" to work much more like normal arrows. You can now shoot the spears without them instantly falling to the ground. Look at the screenshots for the before and after screenshots. Before, the spear would go a few feet in front of you and just drop to the group. After, the spears fly in the air like arrows.\r\n\r\nWhy do this, you may ask? Because, I always loved how the Riekling Spears looked, but they were completely useless. \r\n\r\nI also slightly increased the damage to match Nordic Arrows. Getting impaled with a mini-spear hurts! You can find the arrows on Rieklings throughout Solstheim.\r\n\r\n[b]Requirements:[/b]\r\nDragonborn DLC\r\n\r\n[b]Installation:[/b]\r\nPlace BetterRieklingArrows.esp in your Skyrim data folder and enable it in Data Files.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso available on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=194493299]Steam Workshop[/url].",
