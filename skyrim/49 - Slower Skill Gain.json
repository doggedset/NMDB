  "descriptionHtml": "DEPRECATED: Please see new Pacing Overhaul at http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1992\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nMostly, I wanted to get out a balance-type mod on day one, so this is quick and simple.\r\n\r\nAs with all of my mods, this will be scalable, customizable, rebalanced, etc., but I spent the majority of the day figuring out how to do this.  Good news is, I figured out how to mod Skyrim just fine without the CK; bad news is, I can\\'t seem to find most of the settings I would expect.\r\n\r\nAs such, an actual amount of slowing is impossible to give.  But to put it in gaming terms: my Nord progressed from One-Handed 28 to 53 with 40k swings (simulated, of course :P) with this mod, and progressed to 79 without.  This mod technically alters the CURVE of skill leveling (from an exponent of 1.95 to 2.3 in the formula - I couldn\\'t find the base or mult yet).  So while it slowed gain by about half in that period, it will slow it significantly more as more skill levels are gained.\r\n\r\nMUCH more to come, don\\'t worry.  Like I said, just making sure I get out a mod for day one ;)\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions in the readme!\r\n\r\n*I\\'m really sleep-deprived and have a budding flu, so I apologize if this mod seems haphazard or anything I said doesn\\'t make sense :P  I\\'ll clean it up ;)  For those of you who don\\'t know my work, check xfo-nv.com for an idea of where this is going.  Endorsements are always appreciated!",
