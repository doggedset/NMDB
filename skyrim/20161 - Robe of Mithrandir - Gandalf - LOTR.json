The installed version is, the new version is.\",\n<br />and it asks you \"Would you like to upgrade?\", also it says you \"Selecting NO it will the new Mod normally\", you should click NO and not YES, it will keep the main file and will replace the update files over the main file.\n<br />\n<br />Its not hard to do it so! oo[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=red][[[@To all\n<br />If you have issues that the mod is not working, that the robe is invisible, that the robe doesn't show up in blacksmith or anything else, now i explain what you all do wrong, because i tested and the mod is working great like to all other people who installed it corectly and works great to them too!\n<br />\n<br />What you make wrong is:\n<br />You downloaded only the Update File \"MithrandirRobe\" and installed it, but not first the Main File \"Mithrandir_Robe\"!\n<br />\n<br />Why you have those issues:\n<br />Because the Main File contains the Meshes and Textures of the robe, also the esp file does not have armor rate and its my mistake.\n<br />\n<br />What you have to do is:\n<br />You must first install the Main File and then the Update File to replace the old esp with the new esp, the esp in Update File is fixing the armor rate.\n<br />\n<br />Where are the robe and boots in blacksmith:\n<br />The robe and boots are in the Leather section or in Misc section.\n<br />\n<br />If you will install like i say, then it will work like to all other people works.]]][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=silver]Author:\n<br />haldir307\n<br />\n<br />Description:\n<br />The white robe of Mithrandir, we all know him as Gandalf.\n<br />Mithrandir is his name in Sindarin language.\n<br />Its standalone, craftable robe and boots in leather section of blacksmith.\n<br />If you want his white staff, you can find it here:\n<br />Gandalfs Staff Skyrim:\n<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11956\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />Extract the file and copy the folder \"Data\" to Program FilesSteamSteamAppscommonskyrim\n<br />\n<br />Run SkyrimLauncher, click to Data Files and checkmark the empty box of the MithrandirRobe.esp,\n<br />checkmark the empty box of Load Loose Files and click OK.\n<br />\n<br />Attention please, if the Data Files section is grey and isn't working, go to this directory:\n<br />C:Users****DocumentsMy GamesSkyrim\n<br />and open SkyrimPrefs.ini, find the [Launcher] and type under of the last line,\n<br />those two lines exactly like they are:\n<br />bEnableFileSelection=1\n<br />bLoadLooseFiles=1\n<br />Save and close it, go back to SkyrimLauncher and enable the checkmarks i told before,\n<br />you are ready to enjoy the Mithrandir Robe.\n<br />\n<br />Permissions:\n<br />1) Users/Modders are not allowed to upload my files to other sites!\n<br />2) Users/Modders are not allowed to convert my file so that it works on similar games!\n<br />3) Users/Modders are not allowed to modify my file including releasing bug fixes or improving on the features my file adds to the game and upload it as a seperate file!\n<br />4) Users/Modders are not allowed to use assets contained in my files in their own files!\n<br />[b][i]5) Translations are allowed, no need to ask me.Â [/i][/b]\n<br />[b][i][u]6) Users/Modders are not allowed to upload my mods on Steam Workshop as their own to obtain money and it means the same for Permissions 2/3/4, my mods will always stay on nexus for free![/u][/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />Made by haldir307.
