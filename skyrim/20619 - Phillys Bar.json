  "descriptionHtml": "Poor old Phinius\\'s past has finally caught up with him,  but his loss is your gain.\r\n\r\nLocated just past the western watchtower is Philly\\'s Bar.\r\n\r\nYou will find Phinius on the porch.  If you are curious, go ahead and read his journal. ( I take no responsibility for the typo\\'s, that guy could never spell very well.)\r\n\r\nI took extra care to make sure that EVERY container is non-respawning and flagged as player owned( including all of the barrels)\r\n\r\nI did not label most the containers because that seemed a little presumptuous, however there should enough storage to suit your needs.\r\n\r\nThe home is nav-meshed and companion friendly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to Rickyrickylo for making a video for my mod\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDGUkSivS_Y\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n",
