  "summary": "Removes cooldown time from shouts and buffs the damage shouts.",
  "descriptionHtml": "   By the end of the game the shouts feel a little underwhelming, so this is a simple mod that removes the cooldown timer from all shouts, vanilla and DLC. It also buffs the damage of Fire Breath, Ice Breath, and Cyclone (as well any other direct damage dealing shout I may be forgetting), and removes the once-a-day limit from Dragon Aspect, as well as slightly increasing the duration of the Slow time shout (level 3 now slows time for about a minute, level 2 for 30 seconds, level 1 should still be 8 seconds). None of the shouts should be an auto kill on higher difficulties and or later in the game (except maybe fire breath level 3).\r<br />   This shouldn&#39;t really cause any crashes, and shouldn&#39;t conflict with any mods that don&#39;t affect vanilla and DLC shouts. Modded shouts and enemy shouts have been left unaffected, unless and enemy uses the player variant of the shout (won&#39;t change Dragon&#39;s power).",
