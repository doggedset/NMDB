Updated SweetFX to 1.5. \r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Main\r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Welcome to the Ultimate Lighting Overhaul Plus (ULO+)&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I first released ULO almost a month ago at the behest of my wife. Since then (much to my surprise and despite its awful name) ULO \r<br />\r<br />has become a run away success and people everywhere have been able to experience a richer, more beautiful Skyrim without the \r<br />\r<br />severe drop in framerate associated with many ENB profiles.\r<br />\r<br />Although the response to ULO was overwhelmingly positive, one question kept on popping up. \r<br />\r<br />&#34;Will you ever make a version of ULO that uses ENB?&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Well thanks to the research, expiremntation and prodding of:\r<br />\r<br />Alantor, Billyshakers, Kodiak123 and Boris (The creator of ENB) the answer is finally... Yes. \r<br />\r<br />So I now present to you, ULO+&#33;\r<br />\r<br />ULO+ combines the low impact tricks of ULO with the lighting and shadow enhancements of ENB. \r<br />\r<br />Unlike ULO, ULO+ will have a significant impact on your performance, however ULO+ is a huge improvement over the performance of \r<br />\r<br />other ENB profiles at only a 22% FPS over Vanilla. As a comparison... this means the entirety of ULO+ uses about the same \r<br />\r<br />performance as ENB&#39;s Depth of Field Shader. \r<br />\r<br />I still recommend ULO Ultra as the perfect balance point between graphics and performance. However, Enhanced+ is here for those \r<br />\r<br />who have been asking for it.\r<br />\r<br />Whiterun Performance Comparison:\r<br />\r<br />Vanilla: 123.3 FPS\r<br />ULO Ultra (no AA): 123.2 FPS\r<br />ENB 0.197: 103.5 FPS\r<br />ULO+: 99.6 FPS\r<br />\r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Installation Instructions: \r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />ULO+ requires a clean install of SweetFX and ENB. Delete all previous SweetFX and ENB related files before installing ULO+ to \r<br />\r<br />avoid CTD issues. To install ULO+, Pick the preset you want (Enhanced, Fantasy or Grim) and extract all the files from that \r<br />\r<br />folder into your Skyrim Folder (The one with Skyrim.exe). Copy (only) the d3d9.dll from ENB 0.199 into your main Skyrin folder \r<br />\r<br />and enjoy&#33; \r<br />\r<br />SMAA is enabled in the shader suite. So please disable all in game and driver level AA to avoid conflicts.\r<br />\r<br />You can download ENB 0.221.dll from: http://www.enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0221.htm\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Important Notes:\r<br />\r<br />Make sure you have the latest version of DirectX: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35\r<br />\r<br />nVidia Laptop users will need this otherwise Optimus will not work:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33227/?\r<br />\r<br />There may be incompatibilities with built-in anti-aliasing: Disable the game&#39;s built-in anti-aliasing and check for any driver \r<br />\r<br />anti-aliasing you may have forgotten to disable.\r<br />\r<br />Incorrect dll or dll location: One way to find out if the injector is attempting to load is to check for a &#34;log.log&#34;. If no log \r<br />\r<br />file is being created then you have probably copied the dll to the wrong folder or you&#39;re using the wrong dll for the game&#39;s \r<br />\r<br />version of DirectX.\r<br />\r<br />Incorrect location of injector files: If the injector tries but fails to load (crash during startup), the location of the \r<br />\r<br />&#34;log.log&#34; file indicates where the injector expects the rest of the files (everything without the dlls) to be.\r<br />\r<br />Insufficient user permissions: If a game is installed into a location that is read only for your current user it may cause the \r<br />\r<br />injector to crash on startup. The solution is to either run the game in administrator mode (right click and select &#34;run as \r<br />\r<br />administrator&#34;) or to modify the game folder&#39;s properties and grant your user account write access.\r<br />\r<br />Incompatibility with LucidLogix Virtu MVP: In some cases, LucidLogix Virtu MVP will conflict causing the game to fail to load. If \r<br />\r<br />your system has Virtu MVP, try disabling it.\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts with Third Party Applications: Third party applications such as FRAPS, MSI Afterburner and RadeonPro have been known to \r<br />\r<br />cause various conflicts with AA Injectors.\r<br />\r<br />Windowed Borderless Mode: Windowed Borderless Mode has been known to cause issues. If you are are using this mode and are having \r<br />\r<br />trouble, try switching back to regular fullscreen mode. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Recommended Mods:\r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Ultimate Lighting Overhaul Plus has been designed to run alongside mods such as:\r<br />\r<br />Climates of Tamriel\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17802/?\r<br />\r<br />Real Colors, Real Nights\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1875/?\r<br />\r<br />Enhanced Lights and FX\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043/? \r<br />\r<br />Realistic Lighting Overhaul\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30450/?\r<br />\r<br />Relighting Skyrim\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17609/?\r<br />\r<br />and mods that improve Skyrim such as:\r<br />\r<br />DYNAVISION - Dynamic Depth of Field\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12525/?\r<br />\r<br />Enhanced Night Skyrim by CptJoker\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/85/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Although they are not necessary in order for you to use ULO+, they are highly recommended as they have next to zero impact on \r<br />\r<br />performance while dramatically improving the visual quality of Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />Just be sure to install ULO+ last and overwrite any pre-existing files.\r<br />\r<br />Note: \r<br />\r<br />You must adhere to other lighting mods compatibilities. ULO+ will not suddenly make RLO and ELFX work together.\r<br />\r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />ULO+ is compatible with all lighting mods that make changes to Skyrims lighting in game.\r<br />\r<br />Users of Hailgoboost please see the Hailgoboost readme on how to get ULO+ and Hailgoboost running together.\r<br />\r<br />Exterior Fog Revamped (and interior fog removal) may cause the fog to look too blue with ULO+. If you notice the fog looking \r<br />\r<br />funky you may wish to try disabling these mods.\r<br />\r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />F.A.Q\r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Q: I CTD on startup and its all your fault&#33; HALP&#33;\r<br />A: Make sure you have all required files and that you did a clean install. \r<br />\r<br />Be sure to delete:\r<br />enbeffect.fx\r<br />enbeffectprepass.fx\r<br />enbseries.ini\r<br />enbsunsprite.fx\r<br />enbsunsprite.tga\r<br />d3d9.fx\r<br />dxgi.dll\r<br />dxgi.fx\r<br />shader.fx\r<br />injector.ini\r<br />sweet_d3d9.dll\r<br />SweetFX_preset.txt\r<br />SweetFX_settings.txt\r<br />SweetFX Folder\r<br />\r<br />Before installing ULO+. \r<br />\r<br />Q: Everything is too dark, how does I adjust shadows&#33;\r<br />A: The easiest way to adjust brightness is to properly configure your monitor. \r<br />http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/\r<br />\r<br />However, if you wish to make changes in game then I suggest doing so through the SweetFX_Settings.txt\r<br />\r<br />Under the tone map section you will see the following:\r<br />\r<br />/*-----------------------------------------------------------.\r<br />/ Tonemap settings /\r<br />&#39;-----------------------------------------------------------*/\r<br />#define Gamma 1.000 //[0.000 to 2.000] Adjust midtones\r<br />\r<br />The /lower/ this setting is, the brighter the image will be. \r<br />\r<br />So:\r<br />#define Gamma 0.000 is pure white\r<br />#define Gamma 2.000 is pure black\r<br />\r<br />Adjusting this setting should allow you to tap the shadows more in line to your personal preference without affecting anything \r<br />\r<br />else. \r<br />\r<br />Q: Do I need any of the other ENB files?\r<br />A: No. Just the d3d9.dll. If ULO+ required anything else it would have been included with ULO+. ULO+ does not use:\r<br />enbbloom.fx\r<br />enbeffect.fx\r<br />enbeffectprepass.fx\r<br />\r<br />These files are not required. And if you try to add them your game is going to look bad because ULO+ has not been configured to \r<br />\r<br />use them so all the settings will be wrong. \r<br />\r<br />Q: I have really low FPS on my Laptop/Optimus is not working&#33;\r<br />A: See this mod for a solution: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33227/?\r<br />\r<br />Q: Did you make this shader suite?\r<br />A: I did not. ULO+ is simply a config file for SweetFX and ENB. All the truly amazing work has been done by CeeJay and Borris.\r<br />\r<br />Q: What is SweetFX?\r<br />A: SweetFX is a shader suite designed by CeeJay.dk. \r<br />\r<br />You can find more info on SweetFX here:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23364/?\r<br />\r<br />Q: What is ENB?\r<br />A: A highly advanced postprocessing and shader suite by Boris Vorontsov. \r<br />\r<br />More information can be found here:\r<br />http://www.enbdev.com/index_en.htm\r<br />\r<br />Q: Why is ULO+ so fast compared to other ENB Presets?\r<br />A: ULO+ does not use any of ENB&#39;s Complex Shaders amd uses the latest version of ENB which has been highly optimized by Boris. \r<br />\r<br />Instead of ENB&#39;s complex shaders, ULO+ uses SweetFX to imitate a lot of complex effects and enhance the overall Image. ENB&#39;s \r<br />\r<br />Lighting and Shadow enhancements are amazingly fast for their quality so they are being utilized, but everything else is a post \r<br />\r<br />processing effect by SweetFX. You can actually see in game what shader suite is doing what by toggleing them on and off in game. \r<br />\r<br />Shift+F12 toggle ENB, Scroll Lock Toggles SweetFX. \r<br />\r<br />Q: This doesn&#39;t run on my laptop with no GPU&#33; \r<br />A: Sorry. Try just using ULO which can be found:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37846//?\r<br />\r<br />Q: Will this work with X Mod?\r<br />A: ULO+ will work in tandem with any mod that attempts to adjust Skyrims lighting via in game settings such as Climates of \r<br />\r<br />Tamriel, Real Colors Real Nights, Darker Dungeons, Ultra Realistic World Lighting or mods that replace the lighting models such \r<br />\r<br />as Enhanced Lighting and FX or Realistic Lighting Overhaul. \r<br />\r<br />Q: What’s the difference between ULO and ULO+?\r<br />A: ULO makes use of SweetFX and attempts to give the best possible visual enhancement without sacrificing performance. ULO+ uses \r<br />\r<br />both SweetFX and ENB and attempts to give people the enhanced visual quality of ENB without the huge performance cost of using \r<br />\r<br />ENB&#39;s advanced shaders.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Will ULO+ work with RLO or do I have to choose between them?\r<br />A: ULO+ works with RLO, ELFX or any other mod that changes Skyrims lighting in game.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Are you absolutely sure I can use ULO+ and RLO together?\r<br />A: You? No... I am not absolutely sure if you can use RLO and ULO+ together... but everyone else should be able to just fine.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Q: Can I toggle this on and off like?\r<br />A: Yes you can.\r<br />\r<br />Toggle ENB: Shift+F12\r<br />Toggle SweetFX: Scrolls Lock\r<br />\r<br />Q: How can I make this work with Hailgoboost&#33;?\r<br />A: Please read the Hailgoboost readme. It has all the answers.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Skyrim crashes and says msvcp100.dll is missing.\r<br />A: Download it from here:\r<br />\r<br />http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=5555\r<br />\r<br />Steam most likely did not install the 32-bit binaries (Which you still need for some 32-bit games and software).\r<br />\r<br />Q: Your mod is not working with X/Y/Z Mod&#33; I cannot get this to work&#33; Tell me how to fix it&#33;\r<br />A: I wish I could but some things are outside the scope of my ability to assist with. I just made some pretty colors using \r<br />\r<br />SweetFX. If you have a deeper issue with SweetFX or ENB, Skyrim or another utility that cannot be resolved by either:\r<br />\r<br />1: Checking to make sure you installed ULO into the right folder.\r<br />2: Updating DirectX: Make sure you have the latest version of DirectX: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35\r<br />3: Updating your video drivers\r<br />4: Disabling any programs that use an overlay.\r<br />5: Making sure AA is disabled in game and via drivers.\r<br />\r<br />Then I cannot help you. \r<br />\r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />_____________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />ULO+ Settings Config by VoidNull\r<br />\r<br />With special thanks to:\r<br />Alantor for their tireless enthusiasm, research, documentation and support.
