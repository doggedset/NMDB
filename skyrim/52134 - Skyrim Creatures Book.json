  "descriptionHtml": "Hello everyone. I bring to you this new mod, with some creatures of skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />Most of the creatures of the wildlife of Skyrim are presented in this 3 books. Im still woking on creatures like Falmer, Giants, Dragons, Draugh and Deadra. I will like to make books with a more extensive information on this ones. \r<br />\r<br />Each book has: \r<br />\r<br />-gives +1 Conjuration. (I chose this one because is information about creatures) \r<br />-Every creature have a picture. \r<br />-Level,Health,Magicka,Stamina,Spell/Abilities. \r<br />-Loot \r<br />-General locations \r<br />-Small text about the creature \r<br />\r<br />- Location of the book: \r<br />The books are in Whiterun, Farengar&#39;s study attached to the main hall of Dragonsreach, its in the table of the small room left when you enter the study. \r<br />\r<br />I Hope you like this new mod, and feel free to live sugestions and comments, it will help me gather information for improvements and updates. \r<br />\r<br />I tried not to take the immersion of the game, i tried to put the text of the books liked it was made by a traveller so if you see some part of the text that seems out of this context, let me know and i&#39;ll try to change it to look more ingame. \r<br />\r<br />My other mod &#34;Skyrim Races Book&#34; \r<br />\r<br />Hope you enjoy. Thanks",
