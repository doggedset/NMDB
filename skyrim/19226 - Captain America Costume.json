  "descriptionHtml": "Captain America Costume with Shield, there wasnt up already so i uploaded mine :D\r\n\r\nAll the armour pieces can be made at any forge for 1 gold, and the shield you can only get through the console atm, will work on it though to make it craftable :D\r\n\r\nMake sure the textures are in: Data, Textures, Clothes, Captain America\r\n\r\nI recommend you use this mod as it works perfectly with the suit and its awesome that you can throw it aswell-http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27497/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D27497",
