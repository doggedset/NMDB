This mod contains only a mesh and 1024x1024 textures for troll\\'s skulls, with an improved normal map and the update 1.01 introduced a specular map too, nothing more, nothing less, the whole thing looks great using lighting overhauls that darkens the locations in which these things are found (or shows up, as you prefer). I find it could add that bit of immersion that\\'s never too much.[/b]\r\n\r\n[size=3] If you shouldn\\'t like this mod it\\'s very easy to uninstall through NMM or following instructions included in the inner Jacks_Troll_Skull_Readme.txt (copied in the \\\"Skyrim->Data\\\" folder) or posted here on the nexus in the apprpriate section, if you should like it instead an endorsement would be greatly appreciated, being my first (public) mod AND a very simple one I don\\'t expect too much but ... you know.. [/size] \r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4]Notes:[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nPictures are very welcome but please don\\'t get angry if I like to choose myself the most weird, funny or good looking one :)\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4]Compatibility:[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nEverything that doesn\\'t overwrite the mesh or the texture of a troll\\'s skull. \r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4]Relyability:[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nIt\\'s proven it will work until you decide to get rid of it. \r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4]Work In Progress:[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nSomething fluo ?\r\n\r\n...and a new rework of another simple item, can\\'t say anything more for now...\r\n\r\n\r\n[/center]",
