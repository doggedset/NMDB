  "descriptionHtml": "Version: 0.12\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n------------\r\nA recreation of the island Solstheim as originally found in the Morrowind expansion Bloodmoon. It is planned to be updated to 4E, around the same time period as the Skyrim civil war.\r\n\r\nWARNINGS:\r\n---------\r\nThis mod is a Work in Process, and in its early infancy. \r\nMost of the island is incomplete, with major sections missing even basic texture plans. I strongly recommend that you only load this mod with a clean\r\nsave, and do not save while the mod is active. \r\n\r\nI offer this mod in the current state as a preview, and with the hopes that extra eyes can point out the more glaring flaws in my work. If you have suggestions\r\nor questions, please use the thread located here: http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/566416-wip-solstheim or send me a PM on the Nexus Forums.\r\n\r\nCompatability:\r\nThis mod modifies the Solitude docks slightly, which will cause conflict with any mods that also modify this area.\r\n\r\nHow to Install (Manually):\r\n--------------------------\r\nPlace the Solstheim.esp file in the Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data folder and select the file in the Data Files section of the Skyrim Launcher\r\nAlternately, use the Nexus Mod Manager to install\r\n\r\nHow to get to Solstheim:\r\n------------------------\r\n1. Travel to the Solitude Docks and board the large Nordic boat on the North-East end of the pier (a map marker indicates this is the Azura\\'s Grace (Solitude))\r\n   Open the door to the lower deck and you will be instantly transported to the deck of the same ship in Solstheim. \r\n   To return, open the door to the lower deck on the Azura\\'s Grace in Solstheim, which will return you to Solitude.\r\n\t*Note this is an interim travel option, and will be preferentially replaced with an Actor dialog travel option.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Only use this option if you are comfortable navigating using the console\r\n2. Enter the command console ( press ~ ) and type: coc FortFrostmothDocks\r\n   press the tilde ( ~ ) to exit the command console\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n-------------\r\nLOD is not created and most of the major \\'objects\\' do not have the LOD flag set. This is due to my own inexperience and poor understanding of these settings.\r\nThere is no connected navmesh to the north and east of the darker blue area marked on the Solstheim-Progress file. Companions will not follow here.\r\n\r\nVersion Info:\r\n-------------\r\nv0.12\r\nThe (new) town of Seglheim has been added to the north of Fort Frostmoth. \r\nSouthern Hirstaang Forest, as far east as the Iggnir river has been detailed.\r\nHimmelhost Barrow (exterior) added.\r\nNavmesh extended to include Fort Frostmoth and the western part of the Hirstaang Forest. This is a low-level object navmesh, suitable really only for follower testing.\r\n\r\nv0.11\r\nSouthwestern portion of the Hirstaang Forest detailed\r\nKolbjorn Barrow and Stormpfund Barrow (exteriors) added\r\nMinor changes made to the Fort Exterior\r\nA progress map has been added to reflect the areas completed (and to what degree).\r\n\r\nv0.10\r\nThe Azura\\'s Grace has been added to the Solitude docks.\r\n\tCurrently opening the door teleports the player (like a regular door) to the deck of the Azura\\'s Grace in Solstheim (and back)\r\n\t\tThis is not desirable behviour and will be replaced in the future with an interactive Actor/travel\r\nThe island of Solstheim is fully heightmapped\r\nNavmeshes are in place for all active cells, although not all of them have been validated.\r\nFort Frostmoth Docks is completed, save for Havok engine objects. \r\n\tThe navmesh for this area has been validated and corrected, although mating meshes are NOT, resulting in odd following behaviour.\r\n\tNote that actors are \\'dumb\\' and will likely be replaced.\r\nFort Frostmoth is complete, although NO navmesh recreation is complete, the mesh currently lies beneath all of the objects.\r\n\tMany of the doors lead directly through teleport\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DO (this list is likely to grow, it only contains items in my current view):\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRebuild the Navmesh for Fort Frostmoth\r\nCreate the interior spaces for the East Empire Trading Company office and Fort Frostmoth\r\nFinish roughing in the texture plans for the remaining island (the south portion is complete, as well as all bordering water)\r\nCreate the Havok engine \\'clutter\\' for the Fort and for the docks.\r\nGet the ladders to work in Fort Frostmoth\r\n",
