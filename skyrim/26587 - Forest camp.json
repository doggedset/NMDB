  "descriptionHtml": "This is a lovely little camp near hunters rest. I have not yet added everything there is still a little bit of work left to do but all of that shell be done in time. This camp is also companion friendly.\r\n\r\nLocations is by the hunters rest, just look at the images. And there is also a map marker leading to the location.\r\n\r\nI am open to suggestions though if you have anything you would like me to add or if you have found anything wrong with the camp please message me or write on the comments page and tell me what is happening =)\r\n\r\nAnd also if you want to change something yourself i have no problem with it. I dont mind if you guys go throwing it around the internet on different websites and so on. \r\n\r\nAnd if you want to use this in your mod you dont need to ask im not fussy. I suppose it would be nice if you gave me some credit but im not going to get all angry over it. Just use this how you all want to use it a hunting camp, a resource, a break away from the big city, a bandit camp, the foundation of a mod you are creating. \r\n\r\nThe future of this mod all comes down to you =)",
