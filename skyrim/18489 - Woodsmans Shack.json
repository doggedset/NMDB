  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][b]Woodsman&#39;s Shack is now available for Skyrim Special Edition, on the nexus as well as Bethesda.net for PC, Xbox One, and PS4.\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/size]\r<br />[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/yhzxU.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Update 04/03/13 - Updated to version 1.4\r<br />Changelog:\r<br />Version 1.4\r<br />- Fixed chest rotation\r<br />- Moved duplicate end table to be next to chest\r<br />- Moved alchemy barrel to be next to door\r<br />- Cleaned mod with TES5Edit, removed any dirty and deleted records\r<br />[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]There have been reports that mods that alter character size can make it so the player cannot enter this shack and others like it.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DODGERBLUE]Woodsman&#39;s Shack is a player home geared towards the Ranger/Hunter character situated in the Fall Forest.[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]When you start your game, there will be a new icon on your map for you to fast travel to your new home. It&#39;s located on the edge of the river running through The Rift that leads to Riften. Woodsman&#39;s Shack is situated east of Treva&#39;s Watch, and south of Rift Watchtower.[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]The house is set in the exterior of the game world, so there is no loading screen. Currently it contains the following:\r<br />\r<br />[u]- Storage - All safe to store your items, they do not respawn.[/u]\r<br />3 Weapon Racks\r<br />1 Weapon Plaque (wall mounted)\r<br />7 Barrels\r<br />2 Chests\r<br />1 Apothecary Sack\r<br />1 End Table\r<br />\r<br />[u]- Crafting Stations -[/u]\r<br />(Inside)\r<br />Alchemy Tabletop\r<br />(Outside)\r<br />Tanning Rack\r<br />Wood Chopping Block with Woodcutter Axe\r<br />Cooking Spit\r<br />\r<br />[u]- Misc gear -[/u]\r<br />Bed\r<br />Some Arrows\r<br />Hide Armour\r<br />Longbow\r<br />Mead/Food etc\r<br />Rabbits and Pheasants.\r<br />Chairs and benches.\r<br />\r<br />At the water&#39;s edge I have also added a campfire/cooking spit, bedroll, and fish rack with hanging fish to harvest.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />================================\r<br />\r<br />This is the first custom home mod I&#39;ve released to the public. I plan on releasing a series of player homes, named Roleplaying Homes. Geared towards particular classes, and not necessarily the common ones. Woodsman&#39;s Shack is the first of that series, and is aimed at the Ranger/Hunter. If you have any suggestions for classes feel free to comment.\r<br />\r<br />================================\r<br />\r<br />[u]=Recommended Installation=[/u]\r<br />\r<br />Use Nexus Mod Manager\r<br />\r<br />[u]=Manual Installation=[/u]\r<br />\r<br />Extract the .esp file to your SkyrimData folder. Using a mod manager ensure WoodsmansShack.esp is ticked. Or from the Skyrim Launcher, in Data Files.\r<br />\r<br />[u]=Uninstallation=[/u]\r<br />\r<br />Deactivate using Nexus Mod Manager if you installed it that way.\r<br />\r<br />Or manually delete WoodsmansShack.esp from your SkyrimData folder.\r<br />\r<br />[u]=Compatibility and Conflicts=[/u]\r<br />\r<br />Compatible with water/texture enhancing mods. Should be compatible with any mods that alter vanilla equipment as I have used almost all vanilla gear.\r<br />\r<br />Will conflict with any mods that alter the cell the house is built, and the immediate surrounding cells (TestForest).[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow][u]=Notes=[/u]\r<br />I always appreciate any feedback and bug reporting. Please feel free to comment.\r<br />\r<br />You may need atleast game patch 1.4.\r<br />\r<br />As is the general practice of mod usage, please remember to backup your save before using this mod.[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]=Also available at=[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=76041602]Steam Workshop[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1259-woodsmans-shack-ranger-or-hunter-player-home-roleplaying-homes/]TES Alliance[/url]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=yellow]\r<br />As a compliment to this mod, I recommend using my Hunting in Skyrim mod.
