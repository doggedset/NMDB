  "descriptionHtml": "It always bothered the f*ck out of me that Wuuthrad wasn&#39;t meant to be improvable. So instead of complaining or search for a Wuuthrad - specific mod, i made it by myself.\r<br />\r<br />This esp file should let you improve Wuuthrad at a forge, NOTHING more and NOTHING less. Stats of the weapon haven&#39;t been changed, Load order doesn&#39;t matter (let BOSS sort it or do it yourself). As for compatibility, i don&#39;t use any smithing overhauls or stuff like Skyrim Redone so you have to find out yourself. As mentioned above - it ONLY makes Wuuthrad improvable - Texture modifications shouldn&#39;t be a problem. At a forge you&#39;ll see which and how many ingots are required for improving (can&#39;t remember as I&#39;m writing this).\r<br />\r<br />I haven&#39;t tested it though, since i&#39;m struggling with my system at the moment - so feedback would be appreciated...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Info ( July, 2016 ) - it is highly possible, if not sure at all, that tempering Wuuthrad works only through a new game start. Required are also iron ingots and the arcane blacksmith perk.",
