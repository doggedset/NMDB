  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i217/Braigus09/cooltext938607753_zps096a35cf.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe Dragon Aspect shout is my most favorite shout in the game. Channeling your essence and in-born dragon blood to transcend yourself into a personified unity of both dragon and mortal blood. \r\n\r\nThe second word of the shout is my favorite because not only it gives you elemental resistance but also gives you an ability to summon the \\\"Ancient Dragonborn\\\" when you hit 50% health. My ass. \r\n\r\nI was infuriated to see this \\\"Ancient Dragonborn\\\" was nothing but a recycled model of Hakon One-Eye. Skills, shouts and everything. While technically he\\'s useful for a few second distraction; he does sometimes turn himself on your companion or allies (or guards) rather than your enemy. And why Ancient Dragonborn? That doesn\\'t make any sense to me. Is that supposed to be Wulfharth? Talos? You don\\'t even summon him through external means (Magic, Conjuration, Shout), you summon him from within you. Thus, he is supposed to represent your Dragonblood. \r\n\r\nSo here I am again to save the day, I looked him up the Creation Kit and give this bastard the needed haul.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i217/Braigus09/cooltext938614877_zps885979d3.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b]What this mod does[/b]\r\n\r\n-Renames him from \\\"Ancient Dragonborn\\\" to \\\"Dragonborn Avatar\\\"\r\n-I edited his AI script a bit, so that he can mirror your combat perks (Two-handed, Heavy Armor, etc.)\r\n-He now levels with you.\r\n-Removes his flimsy Nord Hero Battleaxe and outfits him with a new custom weapon.\r\n-Since he represents your Dragonblood, changed his voiced from Hakon\\'s (lazy Bethesda) to a Dragon\\'s; making him more intimidating.\r\n-Fixed his uber-aggressive AI, this is what gets us to trouble every time. His AI is set to Very Aggressive, no wonder your followers attack him too.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i217/Braigus09/cooltext938615175_zpscf1dcd1e.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b]Required Files[/b]\r\n\r\nDragonborn DLC\r\n\r\nJust keep it at the bottom of the load order thank you!\r\n\r\n",
