  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][color=#d5a6bd]Original Mod: \r<br />***************[/color][/b]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42438/?]Dragonborn Mudcrabs[/url] [color=#b4a7d6]by[/color] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/583426/?]noxiousq12 \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/url][b][color=#f9cb9c]Changes:\r<br />**********\r<br />[/color][/b][color=#ffe599]- Added optional texture as requested, that makes Sparky yellow instead of purple. Overwrite main or optional file with it. ;)\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4]Description: \r<br />**************[/color][/b]\r<br />[color=#d5a6bd]This mod makes the standard looking mudcrab followers from Dragonborn Mudcrabs look as special as they are&#33; Not only do they have the proper color according to the element of the spells they use, they did receive different meshes as well&#33; So each of them does have an individual look, that will NOT affect any other mudcrab in your game.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[color=#b4a7d6]There are two versions available, the standard version, that doesn&#39;t change anything additional to the textures and meshes, but their names, because I just felt like it - and an optional version that gives them double the speed, so they keep up with you a lot better. Choose which one you want.[/color]\r<br />[color=#a4c2f4]Tested and found to work alongside AFT and with My Home Is Your Home.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#d5a6bd]Where to find the little crabbies? \r<br />*************************************[/color][/b]\r<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Just like in the original mod, here are the places to find them:\r<br />- Sparky: Riverwood, near the bridge\r<br />- Snowflake: Falkreath, near the watermill\r<br />- Little Flame: Ivarstead near the bridge that leads over the river[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#a4c2f4][b]Additional information: \r<br />**************************[/b][/color]\r<br />[color=#d5a6bd]These little crabs are VERY powerful. I mean it&#33; If you&#39;re playing on low difficulty, you won&#39;t have much fun with them, unless you want them to do your work and just watch - which is admittably amusing. They were made for master difficulty.\r<br />Each of them has its own aspect, fire, lightning and ice.\r<br />\r<br />Taken from the original description:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Sparky&#39;s special attacks: ///LIGHTNING/// \r<br />-Whirlwind strike\r<br />-Ebonyflesh\r<br />-Lightning cloak\r<br />-Mass paralysis\r<br />-Summon mudcrab spirit\r<br />-Close Wounds\r<br />[/b][/color]\r<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4]Snowflake&#39;s special attacks: ///ICE///\r<br />-Frost breath\r<br />-Ice form\r<br />-Ebonyflesh\r<br />-Frost cloak\r<br />-Mass paralysis\r<br />-Summon mudcrab spirit\r<br />-Close Wounds[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#d5a6bd][b]Little Flame&#39;s special attacks: ///FIRE///\r<br />-Fire breath\r<br />-Unrelenting force\r<br />-Ebonyflesh\r<br />-Flame cloak\r<br />-Mass paralysis\r<br />-Summon mudcrab spirit\r<br />-Close Wounds\r<br />[/b][/color][color=#b4a7d6]\r<br />There is also a substantial boost to their health and stamina as well as static damage resist ability. Dragonborn mudcrabs are essential and won&#39;t die, so you don&#39;t have to worry about that. They have no effect on your stealth meter, and unagressive and won&#39;t attack recklessly or engage into combat on sight, I tried to make them fit stealthy profiles too. Carrying capacity have also been increased in case you are over encumbered. I gave them a speed boost so that they can actually keep up with the player. [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#a4c2f4]The companions were made and tested on master difficulty, playing on lower difficulties may change the experience and make them look overpowered compared to other NPC&#39;s. Consider that they are mostly for high level characters, though they scale with you starting from level 10. Difficulty enhancing mods are very welcome.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#d5a6bd]How to install:\r<br />****************[/color][/b]\r<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Extract the archive to your Skyrim directory, or use the modmanager of your choice to install.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#a4c2f4][b]How to uninstall:\r<br />*******************[/b][/color]\r<br />[color=#d5a6bd]Either use the modmanager of your choice, or delete the following files from your Skyrim directory:\r<br />Data/Dragonborn Mudcrabs.esp\r<br />Data/Dragonborn Mudcrabs.bsl\r<br />Data/Dragonborn Mudcrabs.bsa\r<br />Data/meshes/actors/mudcrab/character assets/little_flame.nif\r<br />Data/meshes/actors/mudcrab/character assets/snowflake.nif\r<br />Data/meshes/actors/mudcrab/character assets/sparky.nif\r<br />Data/textures/mudcrab/little_flame.dds\r<br />Data/textures/mudcrab/snowflake.dds\r<br />Data/textures/mudcrab/sparky.dds\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b]Credits:\r<br />*********[/b][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/583426/?]noxiousq12 [/url][color=#a4c2f4]- Original mod and scripts\r<br />(So be sure to leave him some kudos&#33;)[/color][/center]",
