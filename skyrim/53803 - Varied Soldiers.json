  "modName": "Varied Soldiers",
  "summary": "Adds more variety to both civil war factions",
  "descriptionHtml": "2 mods that add a lot of variation to the soldiers on both sides, Imperial and Stormcloak.\r<br />\r<br />3rd optional mod adds new soldiers to imperial camps and forts. Female nords, male orcs, and male dark elves.\r<br />\r<br />Varied Stormcloaks-sleeved cuirass, iron boots and gauntlets, now carry either iron, steel, banded iron, or Windhelm guard shields (the one with the bear painted on), new helmets (iron, officer, steel, bandages, scaled, hide, and the original stormcloak helmet) \r<br />\r<br />Varied Imperial Soldiers-adds new outfits for soldiers. Officer outfit, studded heavy variation, Legionnaire heavy (full faced helmet), and heavy set. Officer and Legionnaire sets are more rare than heavy, studded, light, and studded heavy (studded cuirass with heavy boots, gauntets, and helmet) sets. Light, studded, and studded heavy sets have either a light shield, heavy shield, and a 25% chance of no shield. All heavy sets have heavy shields. \r<br />\r<br />Works on existing saves. Use the&#34;resetinventory&#34; console command on any soldier not updated. \r<br />No bugs but if you have Immersive Armors the imperial armors added from that mod will overwrite the heavy set here so you&#39;ll see the other sets from here and the new armors from IA but not the heavy set unless you disable them in the MCM menu for IA.\r<br />I&#39;ve split the mods into 2 (3) files so you can use one or the other, or both (or all 3), up to you. Load order probably after any mods that change the same things.\r<br />Easy download with NMM or manually works too.\r<br />\r<br />If you like this mod check out my Varied Guards mod too: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53787/?\r<br />\r<br />Anyone who wants to port this or my other mods to the special edition/to consoles can",
