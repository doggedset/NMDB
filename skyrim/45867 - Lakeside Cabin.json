  "descriptionHtml": "Introduction:\r\nThis is the first mod that i have made for Skyrim so go easy on me. It basically adds a player home that can be used very early on in the game. If you have any advice or requests then please don't hesitate to leave a comment as I'm sure there is much to be improved!\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nI'm sure that I'm not the only one that got tired of lugging around all those weapons and dragon bones early on in the game; so what I've done is added a small player home that isn't too far from all of the key points that you will be visiting as a low level player. However, it does still act as a lore friendly home for the people that don't like living in the cities as it is relatively secluded.\r\n\r\nThe cabin has many of the features that will come in handy from time to time, including a workbench, cooking pot and enchanting table. There is plenty of storage throughout the house without it loosing its natural feel of a cosy cabin :)\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nThe Cabin is located just up the river from Riverwood on the opposite side of the lake. Refer to the screenshots for further detail.\r\n\r\nIf you like what you see then endorse :) It really helps out a lot.\r\n-NOLIF3",
