Yes I made a Beatles reference, Can be found right next to the Skyforge\r\n\r\nNo one else had done this yet so i figured why not. too lazy to make a silver hammer texture (by lazy I mean I have no idea!)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to donate silver hammer textures I\\'d happily give you credit and a total of 50 internet awesome points (by that I mean co-authorship on this mod my friendship and perhaps some cool mod ideas for the future :D)\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel Free to leave feed back so I can make this better/more balanced. I\\'m considering taking the stagger effect out. Endorse if you like it, perhaps I\\'ll do more mods if I\\'m not terrible at this! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
