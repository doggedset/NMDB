  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][b][color=FF0000]Clean install recommended for v0.3 to make sure navmesh is improved properly[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[u][b][size=3]Changelog[/size][/b][/u]\r\n[b]0.3[/b] (2/13/12) - Navmesh bug still exists, but it seems that the worst glitches have been fixed :) Blacksmith area tweaked, workbench removed for now. Alchemist and chapel buildings also edited slightly.\r\n[b]0.2[/b] (2/11/12) - Rebuilt the mod from the ground up. Changed the Chapel slightly, removed the Hunter\\'s Camp for now, and added both a Blacksmith and an Alchemist. Check behind the Inn :) Please note that the pathing bug is still not fixed (this is a Bethesda bug, not much I can do). For details on the bug please check the comments section. I\\'m still looking for solutions though :)\r\n[b]0.1a[/b] (2/9/12) - Hotfix designed to fix some pathing issues. Please do a clean install (uncheck esp, load into game, save, exit; then check the new esp and load in). I\\'ve gone through and edited AI pathing by hand so hopefully this will fix it, but unfortunately Bethesda hasn\\'t yet added detailed guides on exterior pathing so I\\'m using what knowledge I have at the moment.\r\n[b]0.1[/b] (2/8/12) - Initial release; includes Chapel of Kyne, Hunter\\'s Camp, and other minor additions\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][size=3][b]Description[/b][/size][/u]\r\nThis mod tweaks and adds to Ivarstead to make it more like an actual village rather than a farm. The main goal is to increase immersion by creating more residences, characters, environmental objects, and just generally giving Ivarstead a more \\'homey\\' feeling. Great for roleplayers! This is also designed to be used with Realistic Lighting, link below.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][size=3][b]Features[/b][/size][/u]\r\n[ul][*]Adds the Chapel of Kyne, complete with a shrine, available cot (free) for pilgrims/player, and even some background lore :)[/*]\r\n[*]Adds an open blacksmith forge behind the inn[/*]\r\n[*]Adds an alchemist, also behind the inn[/*]\r\n[*]Minor stuff like more environmental objects, different lighting here and there, etc[/*]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\n[u][size=3][b]Known Issues/Compatibility[/b][/size][/u]\r\n[ul][*]The AI pathing can bug out sometimes, see comments section for more details [/*]\r\n[*]So far the new NPCs don\\'t give out quests or engage in active dialogue with the player; this feature will be added later[/*]\r\n[*]Should be compatible with all mods that don\\'t modify the same cells in Ivarstead. Load order shouldn\\'t matter[/*]\r\n[*]Should not affect FPS negatively, I haven\\'t noticed any drops[/*]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\n[u][size=3][b]Upcoming[/b][/size][/u]\r\n[ul][*]More citizens/residences[/*]\r\n[*]Perhaps some more guard locations like a tower, wall, etc[/*]\r\n[*]Misc lore-friendly locations[/*]\r\n[*]More flora (trees, shrubs, etc)[/*]\r\n[*]Better lighting (still debating how to go about this, as more light sources means less FPS)[/*]\r\n[*]What would YOU like to see next? :)[/*]\r\n[/ul]\r\n\r\n[u][size=3][b]Installation[/b][/size][/u]\r\nAutomatic-\r\nDownload with NMM and activate\r\n\r\nManual-\r\nExtract esp into the Data folder and activate\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][size=3][b]Recommended Mods[/b][/size][/u]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7654]Realistic Lighting[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6770]Various Guards TS Edition[/url]\r\nTexture packs of your choice\r\nPISE, Wars in Skyrim, etc",
