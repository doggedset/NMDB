  "descriptionHtml": "Some time ago I gave this file out to a few people who were asking for a less crowded version in Lively Inns And Taverns&#39; comments section. I looked in on the mod recently and saw that people were still asking for a reduced version so here it is for the rest of you&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod removes many of the NPC spawns and redistributes the remaining ones so you don&#39;t walk straight into someone as soon as you walk through the door. It also adds a little more movement as the NPCs don&#39;t spawn and immediately sit down.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Note: The number of NPCs has been adjusted by the size of the tavern with the largest having 10/11 NPCs spawned and the smallest 2/3. Usually the amount was at least halved compared to the standard mod. There are a couple of taverns that weren&#39;t included in the original mod, if there&#39;s enough clamouring for it I&#39;ll add them myself at some point but I&#39;ve not seen it mentioned by anyone else yet :P\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Install: Just add my .esp to your Skyrim/Data folder, [color=#ff0000][b]deactivate the original LIAT - NPCs.esp[/b] [/color]and activate LIAT - Less NPCs *NOTE THIS REQUIRES THE ORIGINAL MOD TO WORK*\r<br />\r<br />Get it here: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19841/?][b]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19841/?[/b][/url]\r<br />\r<br />For anyone experiencing grey faces after installing this .esp you can either rename the facegen folder found here:\r<br />\r<br />Textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;FaceGenData&#92;FaceTint&#92;\r<br />\r<br />from LIAT - NPCs.esp to LIAT - Less NPCs.esp\r<br />\r<br />OR\r<br />\r<br />Rename LIAT - Less NPCs.esp to LIAT - NPCs.esp (seems people have had more success with this method).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> If you think anywhere is still too busy or too empty PM me and I&#39;ll have a go at balancing it a bit better.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod was cleaned in TES5Edit because you should clean your dang mods people&#33;",
