  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\r\n\r\n[youtube]uPIpAqQIDPQ[/youtube]\r\n\r\nEdits the over the shoulder/third person/horse camera settings to allow for more zoom and seamless transition from unsheathed to sheathed. As a bonus the mod now also attempts to have a go at a fake first person horse riding camera. Being an offshoot of a transparency bug affecting the Playable Char this aspect of the mod is very crude and has it\\'s share of niggles, it is is no way the main aim of the mod but just an attempt until the construction kit comes along.\r\n\r\nNotes on Fake First Person Riding - As of now when using the FFPR tweak you still have use of a decent 3rd person camera on horseback, the FFP comes into play when you zoom in as far as you can using the mouse wheel. As you zoom you will notice that your PC goes transparent and the zoom will pass through him slightly. This is the cheat, and are some of the best settings I could find to avoid the following problem. From time to time you WILL see your transparent PC block your view, mainly going down hills and when galloping. I found the best way to reduce this was to move my mouse with the horse. So if your going down an incline, aim down as if your guiding your horse, it is very annoying I\\'m afraid but I\\'m at a dead end. If it bugs you by all means experiments with the attached [Camera] tweaks.txt and find the fix.\r\n\r\nCredits: Bethesda for Skyrim, Zah for testing and Raptor Jesus for being awesome. Biggest shout goes to FLokii for alerting me to using minus values on fActorFadeOutLimit, without him you would have transparent horses and no Fake First Person Riding. Second biggest shout goes to many of you chaps in the comments. Thank you this is my first \\\"mod\\\" and you are an inspiration.\r\n\r\n[/center]",
