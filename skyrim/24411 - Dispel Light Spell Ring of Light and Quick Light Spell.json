  "summary": "If you are using an ENB with darker nights and dungeons and rely on stealth to kill your enemies, you may find this mod useful.  I always hated casting candlelight to not bump into walls in a dark dungeon, then having no way to put out the light when I stumbled upon an enemy to be able to kill them stealthily.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Dispel Light Spell, Ring of Light and Quick Light Spell\r<br />\r<br />v1.1 In Optional Files section adds the ability to disenchant the ring of light and learn the enchantment so you can enchant other items with light.\r<br />\r<br />If you are using an ENB with darker nights and dungeons and rely on stealth to kill your enemies, you may find this mod useful.  I always hated casting candlelight to not bump into walls in a dark dungeon, then having no way to put out the light when I stumbled upon an enemy to be able to kill them stealthily.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a Dispel Light spell (Alteration school) so that you can quickly put out your magic light to avoid being seen by an enemy.  \r<br />\r<br />I also added a Ring of Lanternlight that can quickly be equipped and unequipped for non-mage thief and warrior players.\r<br />\r<br />The other thing I thought was missing was a quick concentration light spell for times when you only need light for a few seconds to search for something.  \r<br />QuickLanternlight spell has been added as a concentration spell (which means that it is only cast as long as you hold the cast button down similar to Telikinesis or Clairvoyance).  This spell has a radius of 1000 (contrasted with the Vanilla Candlelight which has a radius of 450).\r<br />\r<br />Additional light spells were also added with larger light radius.  1. Lanternlight spell has radius 1000 and 2. Firelight spell has radius 1500.\r<br />\r<br />Dwemerlight spell was also added as a targeted spell like Magelight but with a larger radius of 1000.\r<br />\r<br />The light color for all these has also been changed to be more like the Vanilla fire light found in Whiterun streets.\r<br />\r<br />Check out my other mod Nightingale Hood Nighteye http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24454/\r<br />\r<br />Location:  These items can be found in a chest in Whiterun in the back of Jorrvaskr.  See screenshot for location.\r<br />\r<br />Works best with Project ENB  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20781\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts:  \r<br />1. If you have a mod that adds a chest or something to the same location that I added this chest.\r<br />\r<br />I know, I need better screenshots.  It&#39;s hard to make light exciting.  :)  Feel free to add your own screenshots. \r<br />\r<br />Copyright/Credits:  This mod consists of my modifications to original Bethesda content using the Creation kit.
