  "descriptionHtml": "Extract the files to Skyrim -> Data, merge the files and you\\'re set. If you have other texture mods added for dark brother hood, you may get a prompt to overwrite them so be careful and back up your files!\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this is just a simple recolor so it\\'s not something to feel super proud of, I like how it turned out though. For those of you who prefer blue/black schemes over the horrendous black/red one (Mythic Dawn eww). Then you might find this tex to your liking, I personally prefer this blue version over the red.\r\n\r\nCurrently I\\'ve only done the female version, working on alot of other stuff including the male. So it will be updated asap.",
