  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guys. i\\'ve made this mod to test some stuff on the creation kit but i like it a lot and so i have decided to share with you guys.\r\n\r\nComent and Endorse if you like. \r\n\r\nThis Mod Adds A werewolf King  To the Game, If you Kill Him, you Will Find On his Bodie a Book That has the Secret of his power. After reading the Book You will Be Able to Transform On the Werewolf King! \r\n\r\nThe Werewolf King is More Powerful,Bigger and Faster than a Normal Werewolf and he uses an armor fitting for a king of his kind.\r\nAs a werewolf King you will Be Able to Access The Main Menu, Shout And Equip Weapons! you will Not Be Able to use Spells but you can use Powers!\r\nAs A werewolf King all other werewolves are Loyal to you and shall not attack you.\r\nYou Can Fast Travel As a werewolf King.\r\nYou Can Stay In the werewolf King Form Forever (Can Beat the entire game in that Form)\r\nFriendly People That Normaly Woundn\\'t attack you(People From Cities,Etc), Still Don\\'t Attack You Because they Fear and Respect You for Being the Werewolf King(But Try not Trolling Them too much)\r\n\r\nYou Can Find the Werewolf King along with some of his servants near Cracked Tusk Keep, Ready to Eat their Meal.\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\nAs a Werewolf King you Can Equip Spells But you Cannot use them.\r\nYou Can Equip Weapons But the Attack Animations are still the same of the Werewolf, But Weapons\r\nDamage work.\r\nTwo-Handed Weapons are used as One-handed Weapons(Much Better i think :D).\r\nThrow Voice And Whirlwind Sprint Don\\'t Work Properly.\r\nArmor Animation is not Perfect. (It was the Second thing i ever rigged on 3Ds max, so don\\'t complain about it!)\r\nNo Feeding Option on Corpses.\r\nThe Only Way to return to normal Form is Changing to a Normal Werewolf (use Beast form Power) and then waiting untill the effect go away.\r\nNormal Werewolves Follow you and Don\\'t attack you but are still Showed as Enemies.\r\nCan\\'t use Bows Properly.\r\n\r\nPlease Do tell Me if you Find any bugs related to quests (if it breake a quest or something)\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n Grohiik/Undeadghost/Me For the Mod.\r\n Bethesda For Skyrim.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecomended Mods:\r\n\r\nLycanthropy Skill Tree by irie009 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9313 ",
