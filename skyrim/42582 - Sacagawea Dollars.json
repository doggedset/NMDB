  "descriptionHtml": "With all the texture and mesh mods I\\'ve played around with the past few months, I really started to get annoyed by the low-res, ugly gold coins. So I looked up coin mods, and found only a handful, and most were texturised European pound coins. No problem with that, of course, I even used an Irish pound mod for a couple days. But upon entering the game with the pound coin mod, I instantly thought of, \\\"I need gold Sacagawea dollars!\\\" \r\n\r\nSo I searched the workshop. Sacagawea dollars apparently didn\\'t exist in Skyrim format, which I was actually a bit surprised. So I studied a bit into texture modding, and produced this high-res Sacagawea dollar with a high-quality bump map for light reflection. Texture resolution is 1024*512, which is pretty good for such a small item.",
