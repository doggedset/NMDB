  "descriptionHtml": "==================================\r\nDawnguard Rune Weapons FXS Replacer\r\n==================================\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Description[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nI made this mod because the golden glow on the Dawnguard Rune weapons is just too heavy IMO - especially when walking in a dark dungeon.\r\n\r\nIt changes the Dawnguard Rune Axe and the Dawnguard Rune Hammer to not use the effect shader for healing spells, but a standard enchantment effect shader for weapons.\r\nThe color of the new FXS is the one the heal spell also uses.\r\n\r\nThis way both weapons are affected by enchantment effect replacers like [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21745]Glyphic Enchantment Effect[/url] or [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1345]Enchantment Effect Replacer[/url].\r\nSince Enchantment Effect Replacer also offers an empty texture, you can disable the enchantment effect completely.\r\n\r\nI added images how the axe and the hammer look with the vanilla effect shader, the enchantment effect shader and when using the various effect textures from the above mentioned mods.\r\nOf course the images cannot really reflect how the glyphs appear and disappear. I suggest that you just try it out. It\\'s worth it. The 2 mods just change one texture (enchflameproject01.dds) and it is replaced really fast. This way you will find your favorite configuration in a few minutes. :)\r\n\r\nIf you like this mod, I\\'d be happy about an endorsement! :D\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Installation[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nThe easiest way is to use Nexus Mod Manager to install it.\r\nIf you are not using NMM, copy the files into your Skyrim folder and enable DawnguardRuneWeaponsFXSReplacer.esp afterwards\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Uninstallation[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nIf you installed the mod with NMM, just use NMM also for uninstalling it.\r\nOtherwise delete the following files from your Skyrim\\'s Data folder:\r\n- DawnguardRuneWeaponsFXSReplacer.esp\r\n- textures/effects/gradients/gradgoldench.dds\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Compatibility[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nThis mod is NOT compatible with any other mod editing \\\"DLC1RuneHammerVisualEffect\\\" or \\\"DLC1DawnguardRuneAxeIncrementKills\\\".\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Credits[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nCredits go to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/4077675]AwkwardPsyche[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/355645]Myopic[/url] for making these awesome enchantment effects!\r\n",
