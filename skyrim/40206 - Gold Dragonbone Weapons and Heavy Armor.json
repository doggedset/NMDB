  "summary": "Gold Plated Dragonbone Weapons and Dragonbone Heavy Armor",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds gold plated versions of all of the dragonbone weapons and the heavy set of dragon armor in addition to the vanilla versions. These items can be crafted at any forge and are fully upgradeable. You can also collect all of them in a chest placed inside of High Horthgar where the Greybeards live, it is in the main hall where you learn the second word of Unrelenting Force. \r<br />\r<br />In game you should be able to see the items to craft at the forge once you have the dragon armor perk in smithing where the other dragon items are (you must have the perk to craft these items). One other quick note, the chest in High Hrothgar will say you have to &#34;steal&#34; the items until you complete the mission &#34;Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&#34; and the Greybeards accept you as one of their own (a member of that faction), then all items are free for you to take without having to &#34;steal&#34; them. They are meant for the Dragonborn after all.\r<br />\r<br />The armor works with all body types, races, and your followers, just like the standard dragonbone heavy armor. The weapons and armor are all more powerful then the standard versions but are not God items and I added a second Helm type to choose from. NOTE: Dawngaurd DLC (or the Skyrim Legendary Edition) is required for the dragonbone weapons. The item chest allows for respawning so do not use for general storage. Please endorse if you like this armor.\r<br />\r<br />Special Notes:\r<br />If you liked the old style of the armor better you have 2 choices, you can use the optional file (v1.5 the one you had) instead of the new 1.6, or you can have both sets in game by using my other mod that I made Gold Dragonbone Armor. That mod you can use if you do not have any of the DLC and it places the armor in another chest in High Horthgar across from this one that have different ID&#39;s so you can use both sets in game if you want to.
