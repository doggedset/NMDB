  "descriptionHtml": "Title:  Blue Velvet Ebony Retexture\r\nAuthor:  Asterai\r\n\r\nVersion:  1.0\r\n\r\nRelease date:  1/8/12\r\n\r\nCategory:  Retexture\r\n\r\nRequirements:  None\r\n\r\nDownload the latest version at:  http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5715\r\n\r\nForum home:  http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1330902-relz-ohmes-tattoos-etc/\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nI love the ebony armor set, but after seeing it for hours on end, I felt it needed just a little bit of color.  This lightweight retexture turns the cloth portions a dark blue and the leather portions a dark brown, and brings out the silver emroidery in the cloth.  I also added some \\\"depth\\\" (cloth folds) to the flat-looking texture on skirt of the male version.  The resulting texture looks natural in the dark world of Skyrim.\r\n\r\nOnly the main armor piece is affected; helmet, boots, and gauntlets remain as they are.  Male and female versions both included.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nUnzip BlueVelvetEbonyRetexture.zip into your ...\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\ folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n\r\nDelete the following files:\r\n\r\n...\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\ebonyarmor\\\\f\\\\ebonyarmorbodyf\r\n...\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\ebonyarmor\\\\m\\\\ebonyarmorbodym\r\n\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\n\r\nNone, strictly speaking, but this will overwrite (or be overwritten by) any other ebony armor texture you might use.\r\n\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\n\r\n- Please do not upload to any site you own, are employed by, or will otherwise profit from.  I prefer that these files be uploaded only to sites that have a strong focus on supporting the Elder Scrolls modding community, but in case of a modding apocalypse (Cthulhu wakes, eats Nexus servers, and returns to slumber, for example), do whatever you deem necessary.\r\n\r\n- You may use these for anything you want, but give credit where credit is due.  I\\'d prefer that where I\\'m credited, you also describe briefly what I contributed (a single phrase will suffice); I consider this good practice and will do the same for others in my own work.\r\n\r\n- I\\'d also appreciate it if you sent me notice when you use my mods; I\\'m interested to see what others will do with my work!  You do not need to wait for any response from me before continuing.\r\n\r\n- You may redisribute these files unaltered, and with the readme intact.\r\n\r\n- You may redistribute these files with minor added value (made into a separate armor instead of a replacer, for example) if you place a prominent notice attributing my files, but not your mod, to me.\r\n\r\n- You may redistribute these files as part of a larger work (as part of a quest mod or a leveled list overhaul, for example) so long as you credit me.\r\n\r\n- This mod was made by altering a texture from vanilla Skyrim, and therefore cannot be used in other games.\r\n\r\n- If you feel these terms should be modified I am open to discussion.  My goal is to make my work usable by many people while receiving proper credit for that work, and avoiding the woes that can come with uncontrolled distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n\r\n1/8/12:  First upload\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nScreenshots are taken with Xenius Character Enhancement, a character texture improver.\r\n\r\n\r\nTools used to create this mod:\r\n\r\nFallout Mod Manager BSA Browser to extract texture files.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA Texture Tools for Adobe Photoshop to open and save .dds files.\r\n\r\nPhotoshop Elements to modify armor textures.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact:\r\n\r\nBe aware that I only support versions of these files that I uploaded myself.  I do not support files uploaded by others, i.e. anywhere other than http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5715 .\r\n\r\nPost in the forum home (listed above), or in the discussion section for this file.  This is preferable to PMing me because other experienced users may be able to help you if I am out of contact.\r\n\r\nI may take a while to respond.  Modding is not supposed to be my top priority and I am sometimes out of contact.",
