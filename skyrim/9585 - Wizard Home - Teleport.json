  "summary": "Teleport to and from your own home!",
  "descriptionHtml": "Update!\r\n\r\nNow added a version that has a full crafting area with a smith/forge, smelter, work bench\r\nand tanning rack. There is also a lovely display area and some more general storage to go\r\nwith the crafting doodads. I have foregone mannequins for the time being as I think they\r\nlook like abominations unto the lord.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYour very own cosy home that you can teleport to and from! It can only be reached\r\nwith a special spell providing total safety and comfort.\r\n\r\nThe spell required can be found at Belethor\\'s General Store as a spell book called \r\nDimensional Rift.\r\n\r\nThis home is mainly designed as a basic mages home and as such contains an enchanter\r\nand alchemy table. There is some storage space and plenty of shelving. Personally I like\r\nto clutter my home with the fruits of my adventures rather than having placed clutter\r\nand as such there is a minimum of default clutter.\r\n\r\nThis is the first version, pretty sure there isn\\'t any bugs (not a whole lot can go wrong) \r\nbut don\\'t hesitate to say if something is horribly wrong that i\\'ve managed to overlook.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust to note, this is my first mod for Skyrim and my second mod ever. The first was a \r\nlovely garden for Oblivion that you could teleport to from the Arch-Mage\\'s Quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions or want to add to it, please do!\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit goes to DarkenDe for making the original script, if you upload your own version\r\nplease credit him!",
