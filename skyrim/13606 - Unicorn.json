Now unicorn is more cautious and unaggressive, he won&#39;t beat the living s*** out of the player if he hurts unicorn by accident (by accident, yes?..).\r<br />2.1\r<br />- Improved skin weights, now mane and body moves in more realistic fashion, Improved whole model polygon count without visual loss, removed injured sounds from fall damage and removed glow effect.\r<br />2.01\r<br />- Added optional patch. Unicorn is non essential, 25% faster than horses, stamina amount and regeneration rate is same as regular horse, no falling damage.\r<br />2.0\r<br />- Added entirely new Unicorn body mesh. Shape is similar to the Friesian horse breed appearance. See screenies&#33;[/color]\r<br />[color=#606060]1.12\r<br />- Added new dark Unicorn skin replacer as some people requested :)\r<br />1.10\r<br />- Fixed some clipping with one-handed swords.\r<br />1.05\r<br />- Fixed normal maps, now they show up properly.\r<br />1.01\r<br />- Fixes issue then Unicorn starts return to this location after dismount.\r<br />1.0\r<br />- Initial release.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u][b]Description[/b][/u][/size][color=#bfbfbf]\r<br />This simple mod adds new creature called a Unicorn in the game. Unicorn is non hostile, cautious creature. Despite that it looks like horse, it behaves differently then horses. Unicorn only fights in self defence and never assist player against his foes in combat like vanilla players horse does. Dragons won&#39;t fight unicorn just simply ignore it. Also it has lore friendly stats like in Oblivion. Unicorn has damage reflection abilities, but this time creature is essential, it can&#39;t be killed so has no weaknesses like it had before.\r<br />You can find this creature in abandoned camp near the Falkreath watchtower (see picture).\r<br />\r<br />To those who, somehow lost unicorn. Type in console: &#39;&#39;player.placeatme [u]14[/u]*000d65 1&#39;&#39;\r<br />[i]*First two numbers might vary depending on your load order, use command: &#39;&#39;help unicorn&#39;&#39; in console to find appropriate ID code.\r<br />[/i][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u][b]Unicorn Stats/Attributes[/b][/u][/size][color=#bfbfbf]\r<br />Invulnerable\r<br />Up to 100% chance to reflect blows\r<br />20% faster than horse\r<br />Unlimited stamina\r<br />Special attack using horn (2x damage, knockdown effect)\r<br />No saddle[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u][b]Installation[/b][/u][/size][color=#bfbfbf]\r<br />1.
