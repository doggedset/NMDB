  "descriptionHtml": "Thanks to Malukah for this wonderful piece of art!\r\n\r\n*** new ***\r\n\\\"The Age of Oppression\\\" added to download section\r\n**************\r\n\r\n*** new ***\r\n\\\"The Dragonborn Comes\\\" added to download section\r\n**************\r\n\r\n*** changelog v1.1 ***\r\nmusic file trimmed at the beginning and the end\r\nother phrases replaced with almost empty .fuz files\r\n**********************\r\n\r\nThe modification itself is a replacer for the bards song files which can be found in the \\\"data\\\\sound\\\\voice\\\\skyrim.esm\\\\femaleeventoned\\\" folder.\r\n\r\nLip snyc won\\'t work until the Creation Kit is released or someone with more knowledge on this might take the challenge.\r\n\r\nI could have split the whole song from Malukah into several small parts that would have fit the old lip sync files\r\nbut this would have totally destroyed the magic of the song because...\r\nthe bards original version is almost half the duration, which would have again needed lip sync.\r\n\r\nOriginal Bard Song from the Legion consisted of the following order in my test run:\r\nbardsongs__0009583f_1\r\nbardsongs__00095840_1\r\nbardsongs__00095841_1\r\nbardsongs__000d0839_1\r\nbardsongs__000d083a_1\r\n...\r\nAnd maybe some more of Malukah\\'s songs will soon be heard in your local tavern.\r\n\r\nFor testing you can just travel to Solitude and have a nice magic moment in the \\\"Winking Skeever\\\" listening to Lisette.\r\nJust ask her for the song, or wait till her vanilla script tiggers to start her singing.\r\n\r\nCredits to Malukah\r\nhttp://www.malukah.com/\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNDT7EInclo\r\nread her descripton for further details\r\n\r\n\\\"You are welcome to use this track in your own videos if you\\'d like to, montages, podcasts, or mods.\r\nJust please include a credit/link back to this video and also credit Bethesda and composer Jeremy Soule for the music.\\\"\r\n\r\nCredits to Bethesda\r\nCredits to Composer Jeremy Soule",
