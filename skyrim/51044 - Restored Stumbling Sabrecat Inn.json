I started this version from scratch, so it is a bit different from the one included in that mod.\r<br />\r<br />The file has been cleaned with TESEDIT, is fully navmeshed, and requires no DLC.\r<br />\r<br />The inn is originally run over by bandits and can only be cleaned up after starting the Imperial questline, but it is never made functional again. I feel it&#39;s a nice location for a wilderness retreat, so I made this. The mod adds an innkeeper who will rent you a bed for the usual fare, and some NPCs who mill about the inn; they are all essential in case bloodthirsty bandits may follow you inside. There&#39;s also a bathing room in the basement, compatible with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29025]Drink Eat Sleep Bathe[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36898/?]ZF Primary Needs[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Similar to what I did with other mods of mine that affect vanilla locations, all the triggers have been left intact; I moved the original door underground and placed a new one that links to a duplicate of the original cell. If you do the quest [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Battle_for_Fort_Dunstad]The Battle for Fort Dunstad[/url] you will not be able to kill the bandits that appear in the original Stumbling Sabrecat, so disable my mod before that quest and enable it again later.\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
