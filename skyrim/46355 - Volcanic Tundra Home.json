  "summary": "Hello Nexus, this is my first ever mod so go easy. I just want input.\r\nWIP\r\nMay require Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn for future updates.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I've noticed a lack of house mods in the Volcanic Tundra, I spent about a day on YouTube watching tutorials. This is a work in progress and I know there is much room for improvement so please tell me.  If you can this of a name for the fast travel and the house its self, leave a comment.  I'll be watching this like a hawk.  I've made a few changes to the noticeable environment around the house, fully navmeshed inside an out.\r\nplease leave feedback.  I'll update once you guys tell me what it needs/doesn't need.\r\n\r\nOne other side note, I'm going to leave the house and fast travel unnamed, in the comments I want you guys to tell me what you think a fitting name would be.  Also, the wood chopping block outside does not seem to work. I'm awful with that stuff, YouTube or you guys will help me :P\r\nOnce again, my first mod ever.",
