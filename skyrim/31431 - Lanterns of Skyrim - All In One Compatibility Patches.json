  "descriptionHtml": "[SIZE=14]Lanterns of Skyrim - All In One Compatibility Patches[/SIZE] \r<br />After downloading Lanterns of Skyrim I found that a few of my mods that had extended various cities and villages wouldn&#39;t all be fully covered. So as a result I stepped out of just downloading mods to start modifying them. \r<br />\r<br />[SIZE=12]Current Mods Patched[/SIZE]\r<br />So far the mods that are covered are as followed:\r<br />Dawnstar Expanded: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22644 \r<br />Expanded Winterhold Destruction Ruins: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8333\r<br />\r<br />I will continue to expand upon the variety of patches on here as time goes on.\r<br />\r<br />I plan to include patches for ThirteenOranges Places,  Highland Milk Farm, and more that can be suggested by you. \r<br />And if you have any suggestions for the current patches up be sure to tell me I would like to hear what you have to say.\r<br />\r<br />[SIZE=12]Requirements[/SIZE]\r<br />Base mod(You need this for everything in these patches): http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18916\r<br />Skyrim updated to 1.8\r<br />And the corresponding mod for the patch.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[SIZE=12]Installation and load order[/SIZE]\r<br />Easy as pie. Just drop the esp into your data folder through either NMM or manual installation doesn&#39;t matter where it goes through in the end. And make sure you have Lanterns of Skyrim All in One esm and light preset you want in the data folder\r<br />For the load order put the patch below the according mod, if you have any other mods that modify that area put the patch above that.\r<br />\r<br />Also no being rude to people and don&#39;t call me names, it isn&#39;t very nice and won&#39;t get you anywhere in life. :)",
