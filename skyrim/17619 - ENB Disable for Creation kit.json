  "modName": "ENB Disable for Creation kit",
  "summary": "A simple batch file to disable the ENB binary so when you run the Creation kit the ENB profile doesn\\'t affect the Render Window.",
  "descriptionHtml": "VERSION 1\r\nI made this becuase It was anoying me that the ENB ran when the creation kit did; the only way to stop that is to move/delete/rename the ENB file.\r\n So that\\'s what I did.\r\nThis batch file, Renames the ENB file and then Runs the Creation Kit. When you close it, run the batch file again to change the ENB file back to normal, simples.\r\n I know there\\'s a way to make the Bath file run in the back ground so that when CK closes it will put it back, but I couldn\\'t get that to work, I might come back to it at a later date.\r\n\r\nUPDATE \r\nI uploaded a second version, this time one only requires you use the batch to launch the CK, it does it all autoamticlly, with this one you don\\'t need to run the batch file a second time; however to get it to work I got a friend to write a small program that checks to see if the creation kit is still running or not, I couldn\\'t do that with batch commands. The program source is included in the folder \\\"Source\\\". I wanted to make it run in the background but It just woudn\\'t do it, SO as it is this is the current version, I\\'ll leave the other one up if any one still want\\'s it.\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\nOk, The fact that the cmd window stayed open (even minimized) kept bugging me So I found a way to make it so it runs completly sightlenty and since the error checking code is still there it still checks if the ENB/CK are there and so on, this new version has 2 more files (I really wanted this to be just one file, but It won\\'t work any other way) .\r\nA new batch file with the same name as the old main batch file and the old batch file was renamed and a VBS script. The script is what allows the batch file to run in the back ground, again the source is inside the source folder so you can see what\\'s in it.\r\nThis is the final version, So unless a way to make it all run from one file the I doubt I will update this again.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is error checking (masking sure the file is there) but due to the way I made it run invisibly If there is an error you won\\'t get any messages. I had to remove the echo and pauses otherwise if there\\'s an error, it will require user input to make sure the user is aware of it and since it\\'s invisible, It will stay there untill the user kills it or untill shutdown.\r\n\r\n----------Installation--------------\r\nVERSION 1\r\nPlace the batch file in the same directory as the Creation kit exe then create a short cut to it for ease of access.\r\n\r\nVERSION 2.11\r\nPlace all files in the same directory as the Creation kit exe (except the source folder, do what you want with that). Then create a shortcut to the file \\\"Disable ENB for Creation kit\\\" for ease of acess, my sugestion is to make it run minimized (via the shortcut) so it\\'s less distracting.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also checks if the ENB file is present, and if the Creation Kit is present, it won\\'t run if there not, same goes if you move/delete/rename the ENB file after you run the script",
