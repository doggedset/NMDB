  "descriptionHtml": "So, what is this ?\r<br />\r<br />This mod is just a few customized ini files to use with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1175/?]Elys&#39;s Skyrim Community Uncapper[/url]  that i created for myself. So you will need her mod (and SKSE to make that one work)\r<br />\r<br />I have played Skyrim several times and every time i did i noticed that the game gets too easy when reaching the endgame.\r<br />This happens partially because, no matter what your &#34;roleplay&#34; is (mage, warrior, ranger, etc), all the skills can be learnt at the same speed (+15% with lover stone), all skills contributes pretty much the same XP for PC leveling  and all skills can be learnt without restriction.\r<br />Yes sure, you can install enemy enhancer, sands of time and or revenge of the enemy to counter, but just the fact that you are able to master smithing and enchanting makes you insanely godly. \r<br />\r<br />[i]- &#34;Mr Dragonborn, nice armor. Where did you get it?&#34;[/i]\r<br />[i]- &#34;You mean this piece of metal with 350 armor 200 health and 60% magic resist? Oh, its just something i crafted and enchanted myself after drinking a 200% smithing and 200% enchanting potions that, also, brewed myself&#34;\r<br />- &#34;But... i thought you were just a thief / ranger?&#34;\r<br />- &#34;That i am too... now shut up before i cast incinerate on you&#34;.\r<br />[/i]\r<br />So, using the ini file that matches your role will not only give you some immersion but also some balance to your gameplay.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Primary skills:[/b] They can be learnt at a faster rate, will give you more PC XP level and have a lv 300 hardcap (150 softcap)\r<br />[b]Secondary skills[/b]: They can be learnt at a normal rate, will give you normal PC XP level and have a lv 75 hardcap (60 softcap)\r<br />[b]Misc skills:[/b] They can be learnt at a slower rate, will give you little PC XP level and have a lv 45 hardcap (30 softcap)\r<br />Also, depending on your role, when you level up you wont get the same benefits from choosing Health, Stamina or Mana. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#900000]HARDCORE version:[/color]\r<br />Only for &#34;purists&#34; that think that certain classes shouldnt learn some skills pass novice level.\r<br />Secondary skills are capped 40/30 and misc skills at 20/15\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b45f06][size=4][b]WARRIOR[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[b]Primary Skills: [/b]One handed, Two handed, Heavy armor, light armor, block, smithing\r<br />[b]Secondary Skills:[/b] Archery\r<br />[b]Misc:[/b] all the rest\r<br />[b]Stat on level up[/b] (the one you choose): 14 hp or 6 mana or 10 stamina\r<br />\r<br />[color=#3c78d8][size=4][b]MAGE[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[b]Primary skills[/b]: Destruction, Alteration, Conjuration, Restoration, Illusion, enchanting\r<br />[b]Secondary skills:[/b] Speech\r<br />[b]Misc[/b]: all the rest\r<br />[b]Stat on level up[/b] (the one you choose): 10 hp or 14 mana or 6 stamina\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#38761d][size=4]RANGER / THIEF / ASSASIN[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />[b]Primary skills:[/b] Archery, light armor, lock picking, one handed, pick pocket, sneak, speech, alchemy\r<br />[b]Secondary skills:[/b] none\r<br />[b]Misc[/b]: all the rest\r<br />[b]Stat on level up[/b] (the one you choose): 10 hp or 10 mana or 10 stamina\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#9900ff][size=4]SPELLBINDER[/size][/color][/b] (warrior-mage Hybrid)\r<br />[b]Primary skills:[/b] Archery, conjuration, light armor, one handed, two handed\r<br />[b]Secondary skills:[/b] Alteration, destruction, Illusion, restoration, sneak, speech, enchanting\r<br />[b]Misc[/b]: all the rest\r<br />Stat on level up (the one you choose): 12 hp or 8 mana or 10 stamina\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[i][color=#f1c232][size=4]\r<br />[/size][/color][/i][b][i][color=#f1c232][size=4]INSTALLATION[/size][/color][/i]\r<br />[/b]\r<br />Just select the folder structure from the profile you want and install it just like any other mod (remember to have Elys&#39; uncapper installed first)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Since there are some skills that you wont be able to learn pass apprentice I&#39;d strongly recommend you using this &#34;mod&#34; with the following ones:\r<br />\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51024/?]HONED METAL[/url]  by skyliner390:  Lets you ask blacksmiths and enchanters to craft / temper / enchant your gear for a fee (Yay&#33; finally something to spend on those piles of gold you get everytime you play&#33;)\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55285/?]TWO HANDED WEAPON SMASH LOCKS[/url]  by Haptly: Lets you bash some locks with a twohanded (goodbye lockpicks&#33;...)\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51733/?]ORDER MY ITEMS[/url] by allexbulluk: Lets you place order on some vendors for specific materials\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63246/?]AWAKENED MAGICKA [/url] by jimkaiseriv: Or any other magic overhaul that lets you take profit from investing in Mana points\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47521/?]DYNAMIC POTION AND POISONS[/url]  by egocarib: Or any other mod that overhauls poison dmg and duration so you take better profit from leveling alchemy\r<br />\r<br />(If you do, don&#39;t forget to endorse them&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />UNTESTED, but should be 100% compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63354/?]Disparity[/url] by kryptopyr \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][size=3]Small FAQ[/size][/i][/b]\r<br />-[i] &#34;I do not understand what hardcap and softcap are&#34;[/i]. The Hardcap represents the max level that skill will be able to get, the softcap represents the maximun benefit you will be able to get from that skill. For example, if you play a warrior once you reach lv150 with 2h weapon the skill becomes softcaped (shows up in red in the perk tree, as if it would be affected by a negative effect) and while you will still be able to level it up to lv300 (to get more PC XP) you wont get any more benefit (damage) from additional skill levels.\r<br />- [i]&#34;I do not like that my warrior/ranger/mage is not able to level X-skill because i want to be able to.. blah blah&#34;[/i]... No problem, edit the ini file yourself and make the changes you like. Its pretty easy :)\r<br />- [i]&#34;Can you raise the cap / change x-value from... ?&#34;[/i]  No problem, edit the ini file yourself and make the changes you like. Its pretty easy :)\r<br />- [i]&#34;Can you make X skill level faster in the X profile?&#34;[/i]  No problem, edit the ini file yourself and make the changes you like. Its pretty easy :)\r<br />- &#34;[i]Can you make X skill secondary for X profile?&#34;[/i] Yeah, you guessed the answer :)",
