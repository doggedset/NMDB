  "descriptionHtml": "Skyrim\\'s Gladiators Arena is a WIP mod that will focus on combat and fighting skills of your player. The concept of this mod is very simple, a colosseum or arena like place will be built, and you get to choose which class of fighters you want to fight against. You can also easily set the number of opponents you want to deal with in the arena, any class and any number simply with the fighter class we provide for you in mods. So for now, the arena will take place only at Helgen until I can find the hidden colosseum or arena in Windhelm for this mod. Frankly, I\\'m not good at building any structures and am still learning the creation kit. \r\n\r\nSo, for now, I have included here a horde of skeletons all at level 10, they will be waiting for you at Helgen if you dare brave their challenge. \r\n\r\nThis mod, I have set the numbers to 20 skeleton 1H melee with shield, and if you think you could deal with more than 20, all you need to do is copy the mod esp file and rename it to say Helgen skeleton2.esp and make sure you check the box for this one, and now you have a horde of 40. \r\nI decided to work it out this way so gamers with lower end rig can fight without any game lag. Increase to 60, 80 or 100 if you like. It\\'s an increment of 20 everytime you rename the mod esp.\r\n\r\n",
