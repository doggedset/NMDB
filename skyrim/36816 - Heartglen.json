  "descriptionHtml": "This is a player home mod to my liking. To make it much prettier I highly recommend:\r\n- Superb ENB-RL (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11318//?) for a realistic lighting;\r\n- Skyrim Flora Overhaul (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/141//?)\r\n- some water mod like Water and Terrain enhancement Redux (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13268//?)\r\n\r\nThe house is located near a beautiful pond, and I\\'d like to share it to see how other peoples taste for player homes is. It is a single cell house but with two floor inside where you can get through blue light portals, some kind of work floor where are enchanting and other crafting tables. Ofc it\\'s follower friendly and with storage chests. \r\nI think I will work further on this mod, make some more highlights. \r\n\r\nTo install it simply drop the .esp file into the skyrim/data folder (I think you know it anyway).",
