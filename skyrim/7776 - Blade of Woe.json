  "descriptionHtml": "I really have no idea how to call this (all out of imagination) so I\\'m just going to call it \\\"Blade of Woe\\\".\r\n\r\nWhat this does:\r\nWell, since I didn\\'t like the \\\"Absorb Health\\\" enchantment on the blade I decided to remove the enchantment in SkyEdit so I can put my own. And then I went and made some more changes. So now it\\'s a blade with no enchantment, can be upgraded with steel ingots (in vanilla it was upgraded with nothing, there were no ingredients set) and can be smithed (optional plugin, check pics).\r\n\r\nInstall: Extract the plugin you want to use, place it in your data folder and check it in your Skyrim launcher/NMM. If you\\'re using NMM to install this just activate it in \\\"Mods\\\" tab.\r\n\r\nUninstall: Do the opposite.\r\n\r\nIt should not conflict with anything, I use it next to 50 other esp mods, not counting retextures and stuff like that.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it.",
