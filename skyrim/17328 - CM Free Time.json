  "descriptionHtml": "CM Free Time\r\n============\r\n\r\nCM Free Time is a quest that if selected will prevent miscellaneous quests from activating automatically by quest givers through random encounters, couriers, mercenaries, etc. Now you can hunt, collect ingredients, craft, look for treaure, clear out dungeons, explore, or just take a walk to enjoy the scenery without having your Quest Log fill up with miscellaneous quests. Truly enjoy your free time without the pressure of more and more items being added to your To Do list. \r\n \r\nThe Free Time quest automatically activates at the beginning if a new game is started or at the time a saved game is loaded for the first time. All you need do is select the quest and set out to seek your own adventure.  You will still be able to accept and complete main and side quests, as well. So schedule some Free Time and just enjoy adventuring for a change.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRecommended Mods\r\n================\r\n\r\n- AskFollowerSkills - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10675\r\n- CM New Companions Mod - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11669\r\n- CM Companion Level Mod - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13790\r\n- Multiple Followers - http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1345602-wiprel-multiple-followers/\r\n- Live Another Life - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9557\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation Requirements for Version 1.0\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\nOfficial Skyrim patch 1.5 or greater.\r\n\r\nDownload and install using one of the following methods.  \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation - Nexus Mod Manager\r\n================================\r\n\r\nUse the \\\"Download with Manager\\\" button on the CM Free Time page at Skyrim Nexus and activate after download. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation - Wrye Bash BAIN\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nDrop the CMFreeTime.esp into your Skyrim Mods\\\\Bash Installers folder, and then activate.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation - Manual\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nDrop the CMFreeTime.esp and scripts folder into your Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n\r\nIf you used a mod management program, use it to uninstall.
