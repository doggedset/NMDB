And you can not craft them by a regular forge, just by the Aetherial Forge.\n<br />\n<br />If you want more Aetherium Crests, the chest with the materials respawns after a while.\n<br />\n<br />And the Aetherial Crown on the pictures is a retexture by the user: Saerileth\n<br />\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74766",
