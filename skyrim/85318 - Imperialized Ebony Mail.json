  "modName": "Imperialized Ebony Mail",
  "summary": "Changes the enchantment to resist fire and magic, with poison/disease immunity because I hate the Falmer and I&#39;m tired of getting AIDs from traps. I imagine it would be easy to switch out the enchantment for a different one by opening it in xEdit, so do that if you&#39;d like. I also changed the model (pics inside&#33;)",
  "descriptionHtml": "If you recall, Titus Mede II was said to wield goldbrand in the Battle of the Red Ring, so while he likely wouldn&#39;t have had the ebony mail, it would still be pretty dope, right? So I tossed this together. Otherwise, the AR is the same and it still is classified as a heavy armor and benefits from heavy armor perks - I didn&#39;t change any keywords, just the armor addon and magic effect. I recommend &#34;Darker Imperial Armor&#34; (Helmet file only) for the helmet, the excellent Goldbrand model from &#34;Artifacts - The Tournament of the Ten Bloods&#34; by FrankFamily on the nexus, and the boots/gloves from Knight armor - Ebony Armor edit on the nexus by 92demonking, with the textures created by the excellent CaBal120 Â to bring out that shine. Thank you to jasperthegnome on the nexus for the excellent &#34;Modular&#34; modding resource, which made it a good deal easier for me to acquire the ebony mail resources without having to export them myself. Note that I didn&#39;t include any of these assets besides the Modular permission free resource, so to look like it looks in the pictures you&#39;re gonna have to head over to those people&#39;s excellent mods and install them.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to use the mesh in anything, feel free to do so, it&#39;s a pretty basic nifskope mashup so if it saves you some time, knock yourself out.\r<br />\r<br />The requirements are soft, you don&#39;t need them but they make it look a lot prettier.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m using an adapted version of Gamwich&#39;s Rustic Texture in the screenies, and it shouldn&#39;t be included. To match the screenies, grab the texture from his mod, copy and rename it to the same name with a 2 on the end, and use paintNET or GIMP or whatever you have that can edit a .dds and remove that big ol&#39; fur piece (or keep it if you want it).",
