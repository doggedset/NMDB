  "descriptionHtml": "[color=\\\"#006400\\\"][size=\\\"3\\\"][u][b]What does this mod do?:[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThis mod fixes all of the major issues Skyrim has when played in 3D Vision.  While the vanilla version of the game looks fantastic, this complete compatibility mod makes the experience near-perfect.   You don\\'t need any other mods for 3D Vision with this complete mod, but feel free to mix and match as you like.  Other water mods with .esp files may break water compatibility, but any .dds water texture replacements will work.  ENB/FXAA/MLAA injector libraries should also work, see instructions below.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Major features and fixes of this mod:[/b][/u]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Uses -=HeliX=- mod to push 2D UI to 3D depths to improve comfort and compatibility.  \r\n[*]Ports Boris\\' ENB 3D stereo fix moon and aurora depths to -=HeliX=- mod.  \r\n[*]Includes Dorkirt\\'s 3D Vision Compatibility Project skybox fixes.\r\n[*]Includes chizow\\'s 3D Vision Water Fix using Creation Kit.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Example 3D photos shown here[/b][/u]: http://photos.3dvisionlive.com/chizow/album/4f36e75a3785015014000004/\r\n[u][b]Example Youtube 3D HTML5 video here[/b][/u]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xboODcwH25s&feature=html5_3d\r\n[youtube]xboODcwH25s&feature=html5_3d[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[b]Original mod links (No Longer Need to Download Separately):[/b]\r\n-[b]3D Vision Water Fix[/b]: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8127\r\n-[b]Dorkirt\\'s Sky Compatibility Mod[/b]: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=789\r\n-[b]ENB 3D Stereo fix[/b]: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4350\r\n\r\nThis single mod should take care of the vast majority of issues for Skyrim in 3D, enjoy and let me know if you have further problems!\r\n\r\nThis mod was designed and tested on Nvidia 3D Vision hardware, so I do not know if this mod improves 3D for DDD or iZ3D solutions, but it doesn\\'t hurt to try.  :)\r\n\r\n==================================================\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#006400\\\"][size=\\\"3\\\"][u][b]Change log:[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[u][b]V2.0 fix: [/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[*]Bundled all mods into one download with correct directory structure\r\n[*]Added my 3D Vision Water Creation Kit Fix\r\n[*]Added Dorkirt\\'s 3D Vision Mesh compatibility mod (with permission)\r\n[*]Added 2 new UI depth presets (0.40 and 0.60)\r\n[*]Added lots of documentation (vertexshader IDs, preset instructions)\r\n[*]Updated Aurora depth again (should be right this time)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[u][b]V1.2 fix: [/b][/u]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Updated Aurora depth so it does not appear so close.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[u][b]V1.1.1 fix:[/b][/u]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Adjusted default settings to 0.95 UI depth for better compatibility with 100% depth.  [/list]\r\n\r\n[u][b]V1.1 fixes:[/b][/u]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Added Boris\\' ENB Aurora fix\r\n[*]Adjusted default settings to 1.00 UI depth \r\n[*]Added multiple UI depth presets with 0.20, 0.60, and 1.00 (default)\r\n[*]Default 1.00 Setting fixes many issues in 3D including:[/list]\r\n[indent]-3D Map icons now match up with 3D landscape.\r\n-Original Skyrim Crosshair and Sneak icon are now usable in 3D (tweak convergence and depth to taste)[/indent]\r\n\r\n-Known issues: 0.95 UI depth starts pushing some HUD or text off the screen.  I would not recommend increasing this value as some text may not be legible at all.  Frustrum culling also becomes an issue at this depth (white bar on either side of screen) during loadscreen, so more reason to try to stay with 1.00.  Higher values may make it more comfortable to aim with default crosshair, but will make objects between crosshair and camera less comfortable to view.  Please use your discretion here.\r\n\r\n[u][b]V1.0 fixes:[/b][/u]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Moon fixes. I just copied Boris\\' ENB code after I identified the corresponding vertex shader using Helix\\'s mod so the moons are at the proper depths. With Dorkirt\\'s sky/stars/sun mesh the sky looks perfect for me now with just these 2 mods with Helix\\'s wrapper. \r\n[*]2D UI to 3D conversion. I used Helix\\'s mod and tutorial to push 2D elements to 3D. What this does is allow you to play with much higher depth values without as much eyestrain from refocusing from distant objects to the near-focus text and UI. Chat dialogue is closer to the Actors as well, so its easier to read text and subtitles while an NPC is speaking. The map is also less bothersome but still not perfect.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nI will add more fixes as I can here.  I\\'ll look at potential fixes for geometry/refraction/transparency for water next.  \r\n\r\n===================================================\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#006400\\\"][size=\\\"3\\\"][u][b]Instructions:[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[b][u]*Note:[/b][/u] if you already use another d3d9.dll injector, see below \\\"Compatibility with other d3d9 libraries/injectors\\\" first\r\n \r\n[list]\r\n\r\n[*][u][b]Step 1)[/b][/u] Extract or copy contents of download to your \\\\\\\\Skyrim directory or use Download Manager.  Dorkirt\\'s mesh mods should fall into place and override defaults.  3DVisionWaterFix.esp needs to be activated from Skyrim Launcher.  HeliX mod reads directly from \\\\\\\\Skyrim\\\\shaderoverride folder so if d3d9.dll is correctly placed you should be good to go.\r\n\r\n[*][u][b]Step 2)[/b][/u] I have now included preset UI depth values.  In order to change the depths, just rename \\\\vertexshaders to \\\\vertexshadersOLD.  Then change the name of the depth you want to use to \\\\vertexshaders.  For example: rename  \\\\vertexshaders - 100 to \\\\vertexshaders[/list]\r\n\r\nGeneral guidelines, use lower UI preset for lower depth settings on Nvidia wheel.  If you use 20% depth, use 20 preset, 60% depth use 60 preset etc.  The goal is to have chat text appear at or in front of NPCs, map icons to line up with the terrain behind it, and the crosshair to be functional for aiming.  Unfortunately these settings are one and the same so finer tuning cannot be made, but at lower depth settings on the Nvidia wheel you have more flexibility.\r\n\r\nYou may want to modify the depth of the UI elements further to suit your depth settings and screen size. In order to do so, open each shader in \\\\\\\\Skyrim\\\\shaderoverride\\\\vertexshaders and look for:\r\n \r\ndef c220, 0.95, 0, 0.0625, 0 //constant param\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][u][b]Step 3)[/b][/u] change 0.95 to a lower value for less separation (closer to screen depth), a higher value for more separation (deeper into the scene)\r\n\r\n[*][u][b]Step 4)[/b][/u] Run Skyrim as usual, if you use AfterBurner or Precision overlay, make sure to check off \\\"compatibility mode with modified D3D runtime libraries\\\" in the RSST config options.\r\n\r\n[/list]\r\n========================================================\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#006400\\\"][size=\\\"3\\\"][u][b]*Compatibility with other d3d9 libraries/injectors:[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n1) Rename the old library which you want to use. For example d3d9ENB.dll or copy it to another folder.\r\n \r\n2) Install/extract this mod to your \\\\\\\\Skyrim directory as detailed above.\r\n \r\n3) Make a text file named \\\"DX9Settings.ini\\\" in the \\\\\\\\Skyrim directory and add this text:\r\n \r\n[General]\r\n ProxyLib=C:\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\d3d9ENB.dll //Make sure path matches your Skyrim install directory!\r\n\r\n4) Save and exit.  You should now be able to use both d3d9 mods at the same time.\r\n \r\n\r\n========================================================\r\n[color=\\\"#006400\\\"][size=\\\"3\\\"][u][b]Credits:[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]-=HeliX=- for his amazing mod tools and tutorial\r\n[*]Boris ENB Series for his original 3D stereo fix and moon/aurora fix code\r\n[*]Dorkirt for his original 3D Vision compatibility mod \r\n[*]Bethesda for releasing Skyrim\r\n[*]Nvidia and their guys behind the guys for releasing and supporting awesome 3D hardware\r\n[*]Anyone who has made mods to help make 3D Vision better.\r\n[/list]",
