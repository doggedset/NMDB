  "summary": "A Basement added to Breezehome for storing some weapons, armor and scrolls .....\r\nI like Breezehome but i like to see my treasures, too. So i´ve added a small basement but with plenty of storage possibilities in nice rooms. (Read installation instruction carefully)",
  "descriptionHtml": "[heading]Update to Version 5:[/heading]\r\nThis is my update to version 5.\r\nWhats New ?\r\nFixes a big problem with respawning containers. Some of you lost their items out of some containers. Hope this update will prevent this now as the Basement is a \\\"No Reset Zone\\\", now.\r\nMade the Basement more sielnt again and removed the animals and changed them to some little Skeletons. (I personally like them). Also this annoying breathing from the dragonpriest is gone.\r\nAdded two more rooms. A study room and a room for followers. \r\nAdded a place to store all 9 Cityshields in a nice way i think. \r\n[color=yellow][b]If you just want to update from an older version you only need to download the \\\"Update file\\\" and extract the contents of the file in your skyrim folder. Overwrite the files if you´re asked for. Nothing should happen to your inventory you´ve already placed in the basement. But i recommend to make a save outside the basement.[/color][/b]\r\n[heading]Description:[/heading]\r\nA Basement in Breezehome for presenting your treasures.\r\nI´ve added some special storage possibilities like a shelf for scrolls or a some special holders for Staffs. \r\nJust activate Meridias Statue with a Sctaff equipped and see what happens.\r\nTake a look at all items because it could be an activator. ;-)\r\nA guard will take care of your treasures while your gone. \r\nIt is follower friendly now and with \\\"UFO\\\" installed your follower will interact with the environment. Enchanting, Crafting, Smithing .....\r\nAnd lots more .....\r\n\r\nPlease add suggestions or things you would like to see. \r\nCriticism and endorsements are both welcome. So don´t hesitate to comment.\r\n[heading]Installation:[/heading]\r\n\r\nTo use my mod with all its features its strictly necessary to install two further mods.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10891]Unlimited Bookshelves by da5id2701[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18340]General Stores - storage resource for packrats by Harvey2112[/url]\r\n\r\nIf you are already using one of the mods, I would recommend to download and install the Main File. This one contains only my mod.\r\n\r\nIf you don´t use any of the mentioned mods, you should download the optional file. This one contains all mods in one package.\r\n\r\n[list=1]\r\n[*]Download the file you need. \r\n[*]Extract the contents of the Data folder to your Skyrim directory.\r\n[*]Activate \\\"GeneralStores.esm\\\" \\\"UnlimitedBookshelves.esp\\\" \\\"zzzbasement.esp\\\"\r\n[*]Start your game and have fun.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[heading]Features:[/heading]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]12 Mannequins and Plenty of Weapon Racks. \r\n[*]4 Barrels acting as Staff holder.\r\n[*]4 Shelfs (I use them as Scroll holder or Soul Gems shelf)\r\n[*]lots of Special Bookshelfs. (take a look at the screenshots) \r\n[*]Special Places to place and show your potions, Diamonds, Necklaces, Rings .... (take a look at the screenshots)\r\n[*]3 Crates where everything can be placed in.\r\n[*]Dragonpriestmasks Display\r\n[*]DragonClaw Stand\r\n[*]Crafting area\r\n[*]A Guard\r\n[*]A little helper\r\netc.... [/list]\r\n[heading]Known bugs:[/heading]\r\nThe Konahriik Mask cannot be seen if placed on the Display. No solution yet. Mask is not gone. Can be taken back, but not seen.\r\n\r\n[heading]Credits:[/heading]\r\nGreatest Credits to Rayek for inspiring me to do that. Please check his [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16028]Hideout[/url]. You will love it.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18340]General Stores - storage resource for packrats by Harvey2112[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16525]Oaristys´ Modders Ressource Pack[/url]. Thanks for that great meshes. Checking every day for a new release.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12394]Darkrder´s Celtic Decor for Skyrim I[/url] Thanks for that great paintings.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14134/ ]OpenBooks Resource by Blary[/url]\r\n[heading]Required files:[/heading]\r\nTo have the possibility to put anything else than books on a shelf, i recommend [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10891]Unlimited Bookshelves by da5id2701[/url]\r\nand [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18340]General Stores - storage resource for packrats by Harvey2112[/url]\r\n[heading]Versions:[/heading]\r\n4.0 Completely revised Basement without conflicts but new features.\r\n\r\n3.0 Final Release\r\nOnly finetuning or bugfixes will happen in the future. Maybe a unique player home. \r\nBut first i wanna play and use a bit my mod.\r\n\r\n2.0 Next Release\r\nNo Bugs so far. Added a new room for a Dragonmaskdisplay and special storages again.\r\nMore to come !\r\n\r\n1.0 Initial Release\r\nBugs: One WeaponRack in each row is buggy. Will be fixed with version 1.1\r\n\r\n1.1\r\nBugfixes: One of the weaponracks in each row was buggy. It wasn´t possible to get the weapon back in the inventory\r\nAdded a new Version 1.1\r\nThe Weapon Rack Bug is fixed now.\r\nFor all those who already placed weapons at the buggy weapon rack, don´t worry.\r\nThe weapon is not gone. Just place a new weapon at the same rack because it tells you to activate instead of taking the weapon. When you did that, you can take both weapons back in your inventory.\r\nSorry for that bug and thanks again to kenz088 for letting me know.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2:\r\nIt is possible that you are experiencing a bug with the newest Skyrim Version loaded.\r\nMannequins are invisible maybe but it is possible to activate und to equip.\r\nMaybe this update will help.",
