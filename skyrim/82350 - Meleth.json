  "descriptionHtml": "This adds two new followers to Honningbrew Meadery, they are married and very deeply in love. They are not custom voiced though that may happen in the \r<br />\r<br />future as well as them having their own house (Oh yes, there is also currently a &#34;house&#34; in Whiterun that is inaccessible and seems to have opened a door to \r<br />\r<br />the void.) but anyways, they are Haleth and Melkor from The Silmarillion. Melkor has an absurdly over powered warhammer called &#34;Grond.&#34;  And their ship \r<br />\r<br />name is Meleth, which is both their names combined and also happens to mean &#34;love&#34; in Sindarin. Coincidence? I think not. [s]Also I blame two specific people \r<br />\r<br />who know exactly who they are for this and for how hopelessly i ship them.[/s] \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Simply use NMM or MO or extract the contents of the zip file to your skyrim data folder",
