  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/Uwawb.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/IsTNF.png?1[/img]\r\nMorrowind looking Glass Retexture V2 is out now!\r\n\r\nThis retexture mod replaces every glass armor and weapon texture with new one and modifies meshes. Textures made from Bethesda\\'s HD texture dlc. Won\\'t conflict with Chillrend.\r\n\r\nI decided to upload this as it\\'s own file since I\\'ve been worked alot on this mod and now both armor and weapons are included in the same file. \r\n\r\nMy previous glass retextures got many downloads and endorsements. I was glad to see that people liked them. Thanks alot for that! \r\n\r\n---\r\nChangelog:\r\nUPDATE 3 (30 October 2012) Added Morrowind looking Glass Retexture V2, with improved normalmaps.\r\nUpdate 2 (10 August 2012): fixed female helmet_1.nif, no more weird shades.\r\nUpdate 1: bow won\\'t dissapear anymore.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/cMklP.png?1[/img]\r\n\r\nput or extract Data folder to common\\\\skyrim\\\\\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/YzKEI.png?1[/img]\r\n\r\ndelete: \r\nMWglass folder from common\\\\skyrim\\\\textures\\\\weapons\r\nMWglass folder from common\\\\skyrim\\\\textures\\\\armor\r\nand\r\nglass folder from common\\\\skyrim\\\\Meshes\\\\armor\r\nglass folder from common\\\\skyrim\\\\Meshes\\\\weapons\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAny bugs or typos in .nif files please tell.\r\n\r\nPermission note: \r\nI won\\'t be uploading this file to Steam workshop.
