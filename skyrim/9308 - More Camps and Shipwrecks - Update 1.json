  "descriptionHtml": "Update:\r\n(Please leave a comment if you have questions or concerns)\r\nBugfixes are as follow - \r\n1. Resolved minor navmesh errors at the Thalmor camp.\r\n2. (Hopefully) Resolved Navmesh errors at the Redguard camp.\r\n3. Fixed the Map Marker for the Winter\\'s Fury.\r\n4. (Hopefully) Resolved the error of vanishing models. (If it\\'s not resolved, saving, and reloading your game at the site should set the models properly.)\r\n\r\nAdditions are as follow - \r\n1. Added bedrolls to the Thalmor camp.\r\n2. Added a bit more clutter to the Ragged Scallon, and the Winter\\'s Fury.\r\n3. Added a new (Basic) camp along the Morrowind border road, tents, campfire, bedrolls.\r\n\r\nFuture plans are as follows - \r\n1. Expand Morrowind Border Camp\r\n2. Proper shops at Redguard camp\r\n3. An Inn on the Cyrodiil border road.\r\n4. Minor quests (If I ever figure it out.)\r\n5. (What would you like to see?)\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal message below:\r\nThis mod adds five new camps, and three new shipwrecks to the land of Skyrim. These camps are scattered in areas where there\\'s not much else going on. Four of the camps have a map Marker, one does not, (That one is just northeast of Loreus Farm). There\\'s a Thalmor Scout Camp, a lone hunter camp, a camp on the Hammerfell border, and one in a isolated mountainside in Rift.\r\n\r\nAs for shipwrecks, they are dotted along Skyrim\\'s northern coast.\r\n\r\nWhile none of these mods add anything \\'dramatic\\' or \\'exciting\\', I always felt more little camps would help things feel more alive. Three of the camps are populated, with basic AIs, one hostile, two are not. \r\n\r\nAs always, with my mods, please give feedback and tell me what you think, or what can be improved upon. I\\'m ever working on improving my existing mods, and hope to expand this mod to double the amount of camps, maybe more, please, give suggestions too.",
