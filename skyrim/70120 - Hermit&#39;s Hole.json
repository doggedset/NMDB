Why isn&#39;t there a player home that is simple, compact and efficient, without the need to walk 5 miles to get from one area to another? Well the new and improved Hermit&#39;s Hole may be the residence for you&#33; Become the scum of society, the outcast of your friends, shy away from big castles and enjoy the nice outdoors. This is the Hermit&#39;s Hole. Just make your way south of Whiterun on the map and look for the shack icon labeled Hermit&#39;s Hole.
