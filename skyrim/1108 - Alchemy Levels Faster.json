  "descriptionHtml": "Makes alchemy level faster to be more in-line with other crafting skills.\r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS: This mod adds an effect to the thief, mage, warrior, and lover stones that increases the rate at which your alchemy levels by 1.5x, 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x (based on which esm you use). If you already have one of these blessings, it will work magically. If you have none, you\\'ll need to pick them up to enjoy the modded rate of leveling.\r\n\r\nThis mod will break training while you have one of these stone bonuses. This is unfixable. The game is fundamentally broken in that training gives a set amount of xp, so increasing xp gain on skills will break training. There\\'s not a lot I can do about it.\r\n\r\nAgain, YOU NEED TO HAVE A STONE BONUS THAT AFFECTS LEVELING FOR THIS MOD TO DO THINGS.\r\n\r\nI could easily make it a separate perk, but my current thinking is that a) crafting isn\\'t combat critical so you can easily switch stones before if you don\\'t run around with one of those 4 on and b) you\\'d have to manually add the perk when starting new chars which is a total pain. If / when the cs gets released I\\'ll make a script to do that.\r\n\r\nCheck out my other mods from my profile here:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3056619",
