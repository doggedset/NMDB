  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very simple fix that allows a player to continue through the Dark Brotherhood quests if they&#39;ve contracted vampirism or are using a custom race.  Usually the game holds you hostage in the castle, as Gianna, the castle chef, refuses to recognize you if you are anything but one of the non-vampiric Vanilla Races.  This refusal of recognition ends up being a greater threat to the Dhovakhin&#39;s ascendancy to power than all the dragons put together.  This fix merely tells her to recognize you if you are anything BUT a non-vampiric vanilla race.\r<br />\r<br />If you are playing in a way that does not neccessitate this mod (non-vampiric vanilla race), the mod will not affect you in any way. \r<br />\r<br />There are other mods that also fix this bug, in slightly different fashion, but as effectively:\r<br />Higher Magic DB CookQuest Fix :\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10770\r<br />and\r<br />Expired&#39;s custom race fix:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10165",
