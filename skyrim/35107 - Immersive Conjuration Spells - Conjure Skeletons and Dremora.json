  "summary": "Adds two Novice Level Spell Tomes which allow the player to conjure Skeleton Warriors and Skeleton Archers. Adds an Adept Level Spell Tome which allows the player to conjure Corrupted Shade. Adds two Adept Level Spell Tomes which allow the player to conjure Dremora Archers and Dremora Warlocks",
  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"If you\\'re like me and you\\'ve played a Necromancer before, you\\'ve probably wondered to yourself, \\\"Gee, everybody has Skeletons but me. Why is that?\\\" It\\'s because Bethesda are a bunch of axe dragging, pelt wearing, Mead chugging S\\'wits who don\\'t understand the beauty of the school of Conjuration. Hard realisation? Download this mod. It\\'ll make you feel better, or so I\\'m told.\\\"\r\n\r\nAdds the following Spell Tomes:\r\nConjure Skeleton Warrior, Novice. 120 Seconds. Level 5.\r\nConjure Skeleton Archer, Novice. 120 Seconds. Level 5.\r\nConjure Corrupted Shade, Adept. 60 Seconds. Level 20.\r\nConjure Dremora Archer, Expert. 60 Seconds. Level 46.\r\nConjure Dremora Warlock, Expert. 60 Seconds. Level 46.\r\n\r\nAll are available for purchase through-out Skyrim, just like other Spell Tomes. The Adept and Expert Tomes will be available for purchase once the player hits the appropriate level, just like other Spell Tomes. The goal of this mod is for it to feel like it\\'s a part of the vanilla game. As far as I\\'m concerned, it should have been. If NPCs can conjure something, the player should be capable of doing so too. Right? Right!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
