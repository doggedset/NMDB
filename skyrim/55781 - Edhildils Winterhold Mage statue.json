She does not have BBP because she is a sculpture.\r<br />\r<br />She is not a follower because she is a scupture.\r<br />\r<br />She might be a vampire or a werewolf but mostly she is a statue, sorta like a sculpture. \r<br />\r<br />She does not come in any other body size because she is made of a marblish stone and is already chisled to her shape. \r<br />\r<br />She does not mind if you do not like her statue because she already has so many others that do, and that is fine with her.\r<br />\r<br />She would like you to visit her and take a picture with her and post it; she is vain because she is a sculpture.\r<br />\r<br />I am using a mod called &#34;College of Winterhold Glory days&#34; in my screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />File:\r<br />\r<br />Data_meshes_clutter_statues_magestatue\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Bugs: \r<br />\r<br />The statue won&#39;t change if you use a mod that redirects the original mesh filepath.\r<br />\r<br />She shares the same body texture as my Meridia mod, they can overwrite each other safely so do not worry about conflicts with mod manager warnings or saying &#34;yes&#34; at an overwrite prompt upon install if you use both mods.\r<br />\r<br />My other statue mods:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55601/?]Edhildils Meridia Statue[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55398/?]Edhildils Nocturnal statue[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55220/?]Edhildils Sexy Azura Statue[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55167/?]Sevenbase Dibella statue[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55195/?]Sexy Mara statue[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Tools:\r<br />\r<br />Blender\r<br />Nifscope\r<br />FRAPS\r<br />Microsoft Paint (BMP to JPEG for screenies)\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />\r<br />Edhildil (statue)\r<br />Apachii (female hair mesh #04)\r<br />Sevenity (sevenbase body)\r<br />Bethesda (original statue mesh) \r<br />\r<br />Thanks to all above and to Skyrim Nexus. \r<br />\r<br />Usage:\r<br />\r<br />If you want to use my meshes in your mod please give the proper credits listed in your mod readme/description. It would also be nice if you sent me a link so I can check out your mod. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
