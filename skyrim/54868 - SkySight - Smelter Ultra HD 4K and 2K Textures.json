  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/p2yRJvv.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[b]This just showed up in the Hot Files 6/19&#33; Thanks for the support&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />SkySight | Detailed Objects &gt; Ultra HD Smelter (4k/2k) by fadingsignal\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />&#34;SkySight&#34; & &#34;SkyGazer&#34; are my series of 100% brand-new, vanilla-true HD re-textures.  I am a bit obsessive about retaining as accurate to vanilla detail as possible.  Stay tuned, many more objects in the works&#33;\r<br />\r<br />What a weird thing to re-texture, right?  Well, it always drove me nuts.  If you&#39;ve spent any time smithing and making ingots (a lot) you&#39;ve seen how awful the smelter looks, so I decided to just tackle it myself.  While I was at it, I re-textured the molten metal as inside the bucket, too.\r<br />\r<br />In my usual style, I made completely new textures by hand, and tried to stay 100% true to vanilla, to the point where a lot of the same scratches, highlight edges, cracks, and other not-usually-noticeable-except-by-crazy-people-with-OCD details were painted back into place.  From a distance you may not even realize that the texture has changed until you get close, then it&#39;s extremely obvious.  LOOK CLOSER&#33;  LOOK AT IT&#33;  Whoa careful, not that close, don&#39;t want to burn your face&#33;\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s a very large object, so a 4K texture was required to bring it up to visual standards.  It&#39;s no wonder the vanilla version is so ugly at 1024.  This makes the texture quite large (10mb) but my justification is that there is usually only one smelter rendered in a given area, so it should not impact memory much (as opposed to something like NPC/armor/weapons.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />FILES\r<br />----------------------------------------------------\r<br />Ultra HD is 4K diffuse, with 2K normal+specular (10mb)\r<br />HD is 2K diffuse, with 1K normal+specular (2.7mb) (much smaller in file size, better than vanilla but not nearly as clean looking.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />----------------------------------------------\r<br />This is just a texture replacer, so simply drop it into the appropriate path in your /data/ folder, or activate it in NMM.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY\r<br />----------------------------------------------\r<br />Not compatible with anything else that directly replaces the smelter texture.  A few folks asked about compatibility with the new SMIM smelter, but that uses a new mesh, with a different design and UV map, so this won&#39;t work with it, unfortunately.\r<br />\r<br />Check out my profile files for my other mods&#33;\r<br />http://bit.ly/skymods\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2546964/\r<br />\r<br />CHANGELOG\r<br />-----------------------------------------------\r<br />v1.1 -- Fixed the 2K normal map filename, thanks to Novem99 for pointing it out&#33;\r<br />v1.0 -- Released\r<br />\r<br />My other mods:\r<br />-----------------------------------------------\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54349/?]Skygazer Moons - Masser & Secunda Ultra HD 4K Textures[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55613/?]Skygazer - HD 2k Constellations w/ Nebulae[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55032/?]SkySight - HD Hi-Res Pillow (seriously :P)[/url]",
