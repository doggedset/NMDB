I dunno how to get the Creation Kit to read meshes as World Models, just yet.\r\nAs with other head-pieces that dont make your character bald, you will get a varying degree of clipping depending on your hairstyle. \r\nIdeally, I will make a higher poly model later with separate gem texturing.\r\n\r\nInstallation is just a matter of adding the file to your Skyrim \\\"Data\\\" folder.",
