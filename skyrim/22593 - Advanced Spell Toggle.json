  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][b]Description[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />This mod will make a few spells toggle-able (cast to turn them on/off) but will apply a debuff while they are active.\r<br />The spells will manage themselves, so if you run out of magicka the buff will be temporarily disabled but automatically reactivated when you have enough magicka again.\r<br />Additionally you will recieve experience whenever you lose magicka to maintain the spells.\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim Script Extender and SkyUI will be required for this mod.\r<br />\r<br />To enable the mod open the Mod Configuration Menu and check the toggles of the spells you want to sustain.\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][b]Changes[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[u]Candlelight[/u]\r<br />No Debuff.\r<br />The light effect isn&#39;t really worth to have a debuff and the fact that enemies can see you easier from farther is already a debuff in its own.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Fire/Frost/Lightning Cloak[/u]\r<br />You will lose 1 magicka per second for every enemy in range.\r<br />Also all cloak spells now scale with &#34;Destruction spells are x% stronger&#34; effects.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Ancestor&#39;s Wrath[/u]\r<br />Has been made a lesser power (multiple uses per day).\r<br />Other than that it works just like a Fire Cloak but 20% stronger.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Oak/Stone/Iron/Ebonyflesh[/u]\r<br />Each time you are hit by a physical attack you will lose magicka depending on the spell you cast.\r<br />Also Stoneflesh, Ironflesh and Ebonyflesh have an increased armor rating.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Muffle[/u]\r<br />Every five seconds you are sneaking you will lose 50 magicka.\r<br />Muffle has been nerfed a bit, now it provides only 50% noise reduction instead of 100%\r<br />\r<br />[u](new in v2.0)[/u]\r<br />[u]Prepared Healing[/u]\r<br />You can now prepare the Healing spell (via MCM) to be automatically cast on yourself when you fall below a certain health threshold and while you have a certain amoount of magicka left.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][b]Compatibility[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Version 2.0 should be fully compatible with any other mod, however any changes to Spells will be ignored on their sustained/prepared versions.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][b]To Do[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Add some more spells (Detect Life, Waterbreathing).\r<br />",
