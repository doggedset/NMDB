  "descriptionHtml": "Project Parallax - Markarth\r\n\r\nPROJECT PARALLAX HAS BEEN REMASTERED! PLEASE GET THE NEW VERSION HERE  -  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/40512//?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/18544-4-1339348010.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREAD THE DAMN Description!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod requires ENB version .112 or later. This mod adds parallax mapping \r\nto most of the textures in Markarth. In doing so it adds a level of realism that a \r\nsimple texture and normal map cannot, and it does it with little to no \r\nperformance hit. This version only contains the exteriors, the interiors are all part of the dwarven dungeon set which will be done after all the cities. I am in the process of doing this for the other cities, but each one takes up to a week, check for a new one every weekend. It is a very time consuming project. This mod is around 4 weeks in the making and would not have been possible without the help of Boris Vorontsov at ENB developement. He supplied the shaders necessary to get parallax mapping to function correctly, please be sure to thank him for his hard work. You will notice that some textures are not parallaxed, this is because they weren\\'t compatible or they were unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n(-REQUIREMENTS-)\r\nENB version .112 or later\r\n\r\n\r\nREAD THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS THOROUGHLY!!\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload ENB here - http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.htm\r\n\r\n\r\n(-INSTALLATION-)\r\nJust install the \\\"meshes\\\" and \\\"textures\\\" folders into your Skyrim/data folder and \r\n\r\nclick \\\"yes\\\" when prompted.\r\n\r\n\r\n(0COMPATIBLITIES&KNOWN ISSUES-)\r\nThis mod runs off of ENB .112 or later, if you don\\'t have that than this mod \r\n\r\nwill not work right.\r\n\r\n(-CREDITS-)\r\nBoris Vorontsov\r\nAnd Osmodius(me)",
