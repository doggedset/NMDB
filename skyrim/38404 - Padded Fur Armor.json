  "descriptionHtml": " Many parts of skyrim are pretty cold so i wanted to make a unique fur armor set that looked warm and had a little better protection. There are pouches in the back of the fur armor so i added a small carry bonus that is slightly offset by the added armor weight. The full set bonus is better than fur but not as good as leather armor.\r<br />\r<br />Crafting requires Deer hides that can be hunted or purchased.\r<br />\r<br />Chest: Tempering requires arcane blacksmith\r<br />Base Armor Rating: 24 +20 carry weight. \r<br />                         \r<br />Gauntlets\r<br />Base Armor Rating: 7\r<br />\r<br />Boots\r<br />Base Armor Rating: 7\r<br />\r<br />Helmet\r<br />Base Armor Rating: 12\r<br />\r<br />Install with NMM or manually place in Data folder. \r<br />\r<br />If you want to use the non vanilla texture download aMidianBorn Fur Armor.
