  "descriptionHtml": "These are Shawkab&#39;s works updated for Skyrim 1.9 and cleaned with TES5Edit.  I will be fixing and repairing most of his files.  Once they are all fixed I will examine more closely which can be combined into one file.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#FFA500]All versions are made with 1.9.32 of the CK therefore the mods are only supported with 1.9.32 of Skyrim.  You are welcome to try Version 1.8.151 or higher but I don&#39;t support earlier versions of Skyrim.[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />All files are hosted with permission from Shawkab.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9556]Razorshade Sanctuary[/url] -- by Shawkab\r<br />[color=#FFA500]Remove all items before installing&#33;[/color]\r<br />[color=#FFA500]Original mod is not required&#33;[/color]\r<br />[color=#FFA500]Also make sure to uninstall all previous version of Razorshade Sanctuary prior to installing.[/color]\r<br />[color=#FF0000]Hosted with permission from author.[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FFFF]Razorshade Sanctuary  V1.0&#33;\r<br />- Removed wild edits in the Breezehome\r<br />- Moved the trap door location.  I may put it back in it&#39;s original location.  However, it was on a ledge that would have been really hard to get to.  Shawk had the map marker set to travel to so you didn&#39;t really have to find it.\r<br />- Added NavMesh\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFA500]Installation:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Upgrading a player home usually requires that all items are removed from the player home.  In order to do that you need to have the old version of the Hideout installed.  Then preform the following steps.\r<br />\r<br />1) With the old version of Razorshade installed remove all items.  You will be encumbered and unable to move or fast travel.  However, you need to get out of Razorshade.  I&#39;d recommend going out and to Riverwood.\r<br />2) Save your game in Riverwood.  Think of this as your &#34;Moving Out&#34; save game.\r<br />3) Uninstall Both the Old and New version of Razorshade.  \r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF0000]**Note** NMM Tracks installation of files but not when you alter the Data folder manually yourself.  It is highly recommended that you close all installers such as NMM or Wrye Bash and check the Data folder for older versions of the hideout before proceeding.  If you use Mod Organizer remember they use a virtual folder so the mods are not installed directly to the Data folder.  Consult the MO documentation or ask in their thread for more information.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />4) Start Skyrim and load your &#34;Moving Out&#34; savegame where you are standing in Riverwood.  When you load your game Skyrim will tell you that plugins are missing, say yes to continue and it should load your game and you will be standing in Riverwood.\r<br />5) Save your game again in the same spot still standing in Riverwood.  Think of this save as your &#34;No Razorshade&#34; Save.\r<br />6) Install Razorshade Sanctuary\r<br />7) Load your &#34;No Razorshade&#34; Save.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFA500]Shawkab&#39;s mods I have updated:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59521]Breezehome Basement Continued[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43593]Dovahkiin Hideout Continued[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59524]Dovahkiin Hideout Continued - Compact Edition[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61129]Dovahkiin Keep[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59522]Dovahkiin Retreat Continued[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59531]Riftrun Continued[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61179]Razorshade Sanctuary Continued[/url]",
