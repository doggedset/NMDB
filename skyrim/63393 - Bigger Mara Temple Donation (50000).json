  "descriptionHtml": "Bigger Mara Temple Donation (50000)-----------------------------------Self explanatory really but for newcomers to Skyrim....This mod changes the charitable donation you can offer Maramal from 5 gold to 50,000.He is a priest of the temple of Mara in Riften and can be found initially in the Bee and Barb and later in the Temple of Mara.WHY&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; I hear you scream...Because you are the DOVA&#33; and have decided it&#39;s time to give something back to the poor people of Cyrodil for all your looting and pillaging.No, really guys - this mod will give you absolutely nothing - no stat boosts, no followers, no ultimate weapon or armor - not even a sweetroll&#33;It is simply a quick way to get rid of all your excessive gold for players that have become too rich and for which money means nothing in the game world anymore.I created this quick little mod for myself to try and create a way to unload my fortune in a charitable and lore friendly way.Before anyone comments on other mods to make money useful i can tell you that i have many mods already in my game to make money accumulation harder/slower and most services/traders 10X more expensive.Other mods do help to slow down your wealth accumulation and delay the inevitable progress towards riches but in the end it is only a matter of time before money becomes obsolete and dungeon crawls start to become boring and uneventful.This mod is simply your final solution and you can decide to donate your accumulated wealth whenever you like in chunks of 50,000 a time.Donate multiple times in one go or on a regular basis.Hope it is useful for other people like myself who don&#39;t want to start a new character but begin afresh with your current one (albeit now humbly poor)If i was a top notch modder i wish i could have created a largish mod where your charitable donations bear fruit in some way like seeing the Riften Orphanage gradually improve etc but alas that is beyond my skill - maybe someone else will be inspired to make a better charitable mod then this simple fix.Â ",
