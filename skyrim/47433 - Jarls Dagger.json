  "descriptionHtml": "Hi there&#33; I made this model as practice for my Maya course, but I figured, now that I&#39;ve made it, I might as well stuff it in Skyrim. So here it is. \r<br />\r<br />The stats are more or less identical to an Elven dagger. It can be found in the Jarl of Riften&#39;s bedroom chambers, but watch out; she owns it, so stealing is the only way you&#39;ll be getting it. If this is objectionable I may change that later. \r<br />\r<br />The dagger is based on a genuine persian dagger, made of black Damascus steel and walrus ivory.\r<br />",
