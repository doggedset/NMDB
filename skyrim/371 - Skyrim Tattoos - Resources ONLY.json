  "descriptionHtml": "This is a modders resource only. It is easy to incorporate these tattoos onto your avorite body mod using Photoshop and the DDS plugin. You just drag the desired tattoo onto your \\'femalebody.dds\\' file and your \\'femalebody_1.dds\\' file, flatten them and then save them. There are multiple body tattoos in black and yellow. You can mix and match them to suit your needs. These tattoos are NOT mine. They are from several Oblivion and Fallout mods. I cant put your names into them as I do not know whose they are. If these tattoos are somebodys design and they do not want me to post them, then I will remove them. All I have done is recolored them, resized them, and matched them to the Skyrim body. Enjoy!",
