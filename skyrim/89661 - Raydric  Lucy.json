  "descriptionHtml": "[right]﻿[/right][b]About Lucy[/b] \n<br />    \n<br />      Lucy, a  special nord girl from Solstheim, she had an amazing talent for both dual weapons and dragon voice. She was born in the cold Skaal village , and wanted to learn Frea, but she couldn't understand healing spells. By the time she was fifteen, her parents tried to help her by finding the black books, Unfortunately both of them disappeared in the temple of Miraak, and she was orphaned. she had to dig mine to feed herself. At Kolbjorn Barrow, Lucy happened to met Ralis, a dunmer treasure hunter, he taught her a lot of skills about dual weapons. Then she decided to go to Stalhrim Source to dig for the valuable stalhrim mine. To her surprise, she dug up two evil thousand ghost blades there that both of the blades were so light that she  could swing them faster than the common blades, and both were bloodsucking that the target being hit woud be cursed by the vampire bats and captured the soul by the blade. \"I will be changed into a vampire?\" Lucy was so scared that she left Solstheim for Tamriel.\n<br />     One year later, in Riften, with the help of Mercer, she learned Disarmshout in the ruins of Snow Veil Sanctum. When she shout at the bandits there, oh my god, Bloodsucking Disarmshout! That is horrilde! Lucy broke down. Finally, Lucy wanted to ask the Greybeards for help and she climbed to High Hrothgar. She told them what had happened to her, the Greybeards laughed and said, \"Aha, shilly girl! you should be proud of yourself. It's incredible that you can resist the hell forces comfortably, you would be the powerful fighter and not a vampire. You could even save your parents from the temple of Miraak with dragonborn.\"  Now Lucy, was waiting for Dragonborn in HighHrothgar Courtyard.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Lucy's Inventory\n<br />[/b]ThousandGhostBlade 2      LucyCrossbow 1    LucyBoltSteel 500    Stalhrim 10    Ectoplasm 20    AncientNordPickaxe 1    LucyMinerClothes 1    VampireBoots 1\n<br />\n<br />Lucy have a preference for her miner clothes, and had better change the clothes before you give her new dress.   Recommend AFT set management.\n<br /> You can improve the ThousandGhostBlade with 3  Ectoplasm when you fight against Karstaag.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Screenshot: [/b]BoneAsh.Skyrim.ENB.v4.0\n<br />\n<br />[b]Version 1.3 fix errors, now it can work properly.\n<br />\n<br />[/b]",
