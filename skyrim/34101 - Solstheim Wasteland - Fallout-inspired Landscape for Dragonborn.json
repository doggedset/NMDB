Now the inhospitable terrrain coupled by an extremely harsh weather presents an even greater challenge.\r\n\r\n================================\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n================================\r\nSolstheim Wasteland is a climate and landscape overhaul of Dragonborn DLC\\'s Solstheim.\r\n- Most trees and plant life has been destryoed to recreate the volcanic eruption effect. \r\n- Extreme harsh weathers (from Solstheim Climate Overhaul) were implemented to emphasize this effect. \r\n- Many of the local flora has been burned down so they can no longer be found in the wild. Trama Root, Scathecraw, Ash Yam and Ash Creep Cluster has become so rare that prices of the ingredients gathered from them has increased significantly and they can now be only purchased from the island\\'s traders.\r\n- Solstheim Wasteland affects only exterior areas, so Interiors and buildings would remain untouched.\r\n- Creatures spawn points around the island would remain the same\r\n\r\n\r\n================================\r\nCompatibility\r\n================================\r\nSolstheim Wasteland will have its own weather system - compatible with SCO.\r\nSince this mod affects only the Solstheim worldspace, It should be compatible with most other mods.\r\nFor enhanced wasteland experience: please turn off any grass mods, tree mods and climate/weather mods.\r\n \r\n================================\r\nInstallation\r\n================================\r\nCopy the esp file in your skyrim data folder\r\n\r\n================================\r\nRequirements\r\n================================\r\nYou must have the Dragonborn DLC\r\n\r\n\r\n================================\r\nLoad Order\r\n================================\r\nMust be placed below any mod that alter the climate or terrain in solstheim.\r\n\r\n\r\n[URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/download/1000021045][IMG]http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/2840/001ihn.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://img191.imageshack.us/img191/8482/004cyg.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=15]Check out also my other mods: [/size]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33919][IMG]https://imageshack.us/scaled/large/546/scoqe.jpg[/IMG][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34081][IMG]https://imageshack.us/scaled/large/18/bbskv.jpg[/IMG][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33582][IMG]https://imageshack.us/scaled/large/833/gosabg.jpg[/IMG][/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33784][IMG]https://imageshack.us/scaled/large/856/grassification.jpg[/IMG][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34912][IMG]https://imageshack.us/scaled/large/560/pikax.jpg[/IMG][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34999][IMG]https://imageshack.us/scaled/large/545/philh.jpg[/IMG][/url]\r\n",
