  "descriptionHtml": "This is an HD retexture of that god awful Business Ledger which I just couldn\\'t bear to look at while everything around it was HD-fied.\r\n\r\nSeems to be one of those textures that no modder has touched. YET.\r\n\r\n[B]Welcome to my first original texture mod!\r\nI present to you an almost REAL, readable and somewhat hilarious Business Ledger!\r\n\r\nThe game\\'s original resolution is 256px while this one is 4 times that at 1024px.[/B]\r\nEven the official Bethesda HD Texture Pack DLC did not do anything to improve the pathetic texture.\r\n[Line]\r\n[B]Features:\r\n\r\n1.[/B] Real columns, and real (VANILLA) values which follow a calculation system explained below:\r\n\r\n[B]Barter Ratio =[/B] A ratio that determines the selling price of the item (and income of merchant) according to the formula\r\n[B]Selling Price =[/B] Barter ratio X Cost Price (Merchant Expenditure)\r\n\r\nThen we have,\r\n[B]Subtotal =[/B] Income total - Expenditure Total\r\n\r\nAnd finally,\r\n[B]Total =[/B] Subtotal - Hold Tax\r\n\r\n[B]For the eagle eyed amongst you, now you know why all merchants\\' gold (in vanilla game) wanders around 750.[/B]\r\n\r\n[B]2.[/B] Real Items, real costs and real customer names (almost each signature has a unique handwriting!)\r\n\r\n[B]3.[/B] Skyrim inside jokes for the fans. \r\n\r\n[B]4.[/B] Real antique paper textures and old style handwriting fonts have been used!\r\n\r\n[B]5.[/B] A (not so hidden) easter egg.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re wondering what the name of the merchant at the top is, it\\'s just some random name I came up with - Jarle Kimat.\r\n[Line]\r\nHere\\'s a great video by Nozi87 (izon87604) which shows my mod! Watch in HD!\r\n\r\n[youtube]JXt2oldAcE4[/youtube]\r\n[B]Download and enjoy a new Skyrim ledger, the way it should have been![/B]\r\n[Line]\r\nPlease ask for permission before using this in your mods.\r\nPlease report any errors you may find, although it\\'s highly unlikely. I\\'ve double checked the text and tested it in game.\r\n[B]Most important of all, enjoy the mod!\r\n[Line]\r\nMy other mod:\r\n[url=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38236]2K HD Pickaxe - Variants[/url]\r\n[Line]\r\nRESOURCES USED:\r\n\r\nFonts:[/B]\r\nhttp://www.creavapeur.com/en/2010/polices-font-manuscrite/\r\nhttp://www.1001fonts.com/bedtime-stories-font.html\r\nhttp://www.thehutt.de/tolkien/fonts.html\r\nhttp://www.uesp.net/wiki/File:SR-Dragon_script.zip\r\n\r\n[B]Pages Stock:[/B]\r\nhttp://lostandtaken.com/blog/2013/1/4/7-free-antique-paper-textures.html\r\nhttp://www.dougturner.net/blendersite/index.html\r\nhttp://struckdumb.deviantart.com/art/Paper-84796520\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/devontt/167285658/\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/playingwithpsp/2546732241",
