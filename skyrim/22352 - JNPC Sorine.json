I feel Bretons are probably the hardest to make in the editor, but I was pleased with this result.\r\n\r\nThis requires the extra 10 apachii hairs. Coverwomen look one is needed to have exact screenshot appearance, but is not required.\r\n\r\nThis should hopefully work straight off the bat, given the Dawnguard npc hell I went through to get the construction set to cooperate with Serana. ;)",
