  "modName": "Common Basement",
  "summary": "A simple, shared basement for your houses which won\\'t break the game\\'s immersion.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Make sure to save OUTSIDE of the basement before upgrading![/b]\r\n\r\nThis is a simple basement with entrances from each house. There is one exit in the basement which takes you back to whichever house you entered through. There are plenty of treasure chests and mannequins and weapon racks, as well as all crafting stations and a bed. \r\n\r\n[youtube]x5IgI6IPBvM[/youtube]\r\n\r\nI made this mod because, while I was very impressed with Shawk\\'s Dovahkiin\\'s Hideout mod, it really wasn\\'t what I wanted. I didn\\'t like the large collections of doors which break the immersion in the game (you have 6 doors leading all over skyrim), and I didn\\'t like how big the basement was. And Shawk keeps adding more and more stuff to the mod. It\\'s a great mod but it\\'s not right for me.\r\n\r\nCommon Basement follows my philosophy for mods:\r\n\r\n- It doesn\\'t change the core gameplay\r\n- It doesn\\'t make the game easier or give you items before you should have them\r\n- It is simple, no larger than it needs to be\r\n- It helps the player organize\r\n- It doesn\\'t distract from the game or break immersion\r\n\r\nThis is version 1, so please report any bugs.\r\n\r\nObviously, this is somewhat incompatible with Dovahkiin\\'s Hideout.\r\n\r\nCurrent bugs:\r\n\r\n- Followers will not enter the basement (I don\\'t know how to fix this right now)\r\n- Bookcase scripting does not work\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n\r\nVersion 4:\r\n- Added some asthetics\r\n- Finally fixed weapon racks. If you were using them before, you might need to walk behind the new racks to pick up your weapons after you upgrade.\r\n- Fixed cooking pot clipping\r\n- Added shrine to heal your injuries\r\nVersion 3:\r\n- Workaround to get weapon racks to work a little better. Unfortunately, there seems to be a bug in skyrim which makes weapon racks never work that great. Maybe I\\'ll do some more work in the future. NOTE: after upgrading, you will need to put a new weapon into a weapon rack to release an old one.\r\nVersion 2:\r\n- Fixed ceiling texture\r\n- Added alchemy strongbox for quest items\r\nVersion 1:\r\n- Initial release",
