I made it for easy launch for either [i]default launcher[/i] or [i]SKSE[/i].\n<br />You see, I don't like to make a double Skyrim shortcut just for default and SKSE in other hand, so I made my own exe which I can run both from one shortcut.\n<br />For future update I'll make it to able to run LOOT as well.\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />- Put this launcher on Skyrim directory folder\n<br />- Make a launcher for this exe\n<br />- Enjoy",
