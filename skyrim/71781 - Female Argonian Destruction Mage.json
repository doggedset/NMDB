  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first EVER Mod.\r<br />\r<br />Casts-Destruction is a female Argonian Mage specializing in Destruction. She can be found in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun.\r<br />If everything is going correctly, you should have the option for her to follow you when you talk to her.\r<br />\r<br />She knows a few Destruction spells, including Healing for herself.\r<br />\r<br />She is essential and should not die.\r<br />\r<br />she has been created entirely from the Skyrim NPC Editor.\r<br />\r<br />She has the voice of the Female Commander, like Aela The Huntress for example. This is because I had to be sure of the follower voice actor, seeing as though I don&#39;t think there&#39;s follower lines for the Female Argonian voice actor.\r<br />\r<br />Please leave in the comments if you want me to produce a backstory for her, or to give her a staff.",
