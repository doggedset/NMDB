Conjuring spirits of underworld to pull their misused kin back to spiritual plane&#33; Some say that you can&#39;t fight fire with fire, but in this case, it showed more than useful&#33;\r<br />\r<br />~~~READ THIS~~~\r<br />Soon (tomorrow probably) I will make YT video of this class, describing its skills and background in more details, but well, it will be only suggestive background, I will leave Role-Play to you, since that is true quality and magic of TES games.\r<br />I have somewhere around 20 classes ready to come on Nexus and on Youtube very soon&#33; I really really poured my soul and feelings in this work, and I truly hope you will enjoy it&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />~~~IMPORTANT~~~ All class I made are OP (Overpowered) almost god-classes, but well, not quite, so if you play on higher difficulties, you will notice little difference, so as I was saying, classes are OPed, you have 3000 points distributed in Health Stamina(fatigue) and Magicka - WHICH MEANS THAT YOU HAVE, FOR EXAMPLE 1000 HEALTH 1000MANA AND 1000 STAMINA, NOT 3000 IN EACH (there are few exceptions where you have up to 3200 points, its in those classes in which I put all points to one stat)... ALSO - MAIN SKILLS ARE MAXED TO 100, SO IF YOU DONT LVL OTHER SKILLS, YOU WONT LVL UP MUCH, BUT EVERY TES PLAYER KNOWS THAT THIS IS NOT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE, SINCE IT WILL NOT DISABLE YOU IN ANY WAY, THERE ARE ONLY FEW QUESTS THAT REQUIRE LVLING (for example quest for museum in Dawnstar, Boethiah&#39;s quest, quest for ebony blade, which i never use, because its dumb to kill 10 followers, and few more I cant think of in this moment) IT WAS INTENDED TO BE THIS WAY, SO DONT BITCH AROUND...\r<br />\r<br />~~~EVEN MORE IMPORTANT~~~\r<br />IM WARNING YOU, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO STEAL IDEAS OR PUT VIDEOS OF THIS CLASS ON YOUTUBE, YOU DONT HAVE PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR USE THIS FILE IN YOUR MODS AND THEN PUT IT ON YOUTUBE OR NEXUS, SIMPLY BECAUSE ITS NOT SOME CODE OR MOD YOU CANNOT CREATE YOURSELF&#33;&#33;&#33; I PUT MORE THEN FEW THINGS IN THIS SAVE THAT CAN PROVE THAT I MADE THIS, SO IF YOU DONT WANT TO RUIN YOUR YOUTUBE CHANEL OR NEXUS ACCOUNT DONT STEAL&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Special Thanks to:\r<br />LoreCraft\r<br />Zola\r<br />Jovan\r<br />and special thanks to my fiancee Marina for enduring me&#33;",
