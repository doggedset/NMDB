  "modName": "Daedric Artifacts Value and Prices of Disbelief",
  "summary": "Realism and Depth mod that brings back true value to Daedric Artifacts in Skyrim, like they were in Morrowind. This gives these artifacts value that truly marks them as real. The values are the same as they were in Morrowind, or similar.",
  "descriptionHtml": "First off I want to say that this is an IMMERSION mod that is meant to add the depth and lore of TES back to Skyrim, by means of returning the true value of Daedric artifacts back to those found in Skyrim. \r\n\r\nThey may be of an extreme value, but it only shows their true rarity in the world they were placed in. Skyrim has valued these items extremely lowly, which is very unrealistic. A artifact given by a Daedric lord is surely worth more than a couple potions found in a dungeon. So I\\'ve priced them at the same [i]value they were found in Morrowind[/i].\r\n\r\n[b]The new values are as follows, which are on par with those found in Morrowind:[/b]\r\nAzura\\'s Star - 5,000\r\nDawnbreaker - 4,000\r\nEbony Blade - 110,000\r\nEbony Mail - 120,000\r\nMace of Molag Bal - 25,000\r\nMehrunes\\' Razor - 5,000\r\nMasque of Clavicus Vile - 15,000\r\nOghma Infinium - 50,000\r\nRing of Hircine -  25,000\r\nRing of Namira - 18,000\r\nSanguine Rose - 10,000\r\nSavior\\'s Hide - 150,000\r\nSkeleton Key - 1,000\r\nSpellbreaker - 115,000\r\nSkull of Corruption - 25,000\r\nVolendrung - 6,000\r\nWabbajack - 130,000\r\n\r\n[b]How to Install this plugin:[/b]\r\n1. Download and Install the Nexus Mod Manager from this link here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/modmanager/\r\n2. Go to the downloads section of this mod page and click the \\\"Download with Manager\\\" button.\r\n3. On the Nexus Mod Manager, the file should install.\r\n4. Go to the mods section on the Nexus Mod Manager and install the mod, which will automatically activate the plugin.\r\n5. Start Skyrim and play!\r\nOR\r\nIf you know how to install it manually, go ahead and be my guest. You may do so.\r\n\r\n[b]I\\'m happy to answer questions or take suggestions anytime! :3[/b]",
