(Achieved through stacking Lover&#39;s stone&#39;s perk onto an enchantment) (For the &#34;oh now well that&#39;s stupid, that has nothing to do with the lore and...&#34;people, read the lore section)[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=turquoise][size=4]Located at Sleeping Giant&#39;s Inn (see picture if unclear)[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=grey][size=4]Lore[/size]\r<br />After years of studying, dozens of failed attempts and a lost left arm, he finally did it. He imbued the energy of the Lover&#39;s stone onto a single, flawless diamond. Grown old, he started to think of a place to stay for his twilight years. The first thing to pop in his mind was with his nephew, Alvor in Riverwood. He then hopped on his horse, and began riding towards Riverwood. Upon arrival, he was weak and thirsty. By instinct, he wandered into the inn, where he then collapsed. Delphine then rushed over to him, but it was too late, as he had passed away. She was shocked, and didn&#39;t know what to do, and as she was panicking next to his body, a pure, flawless diamond dropped out of his pocket. She then without thinking grabbed it before anyone noticed. A day later she went to see Alvor, who was not yet informed of his uncle&#39;s passing. As she was about to tell him, Delphine thought &#34;Maybe I should first ask if he had the skill required to craft a golden ring around a flawless diamond&#34;, and did just that. Alvor, confidently began working on it. Two hours later, when Delphine had gotten back to the inn, Alvor was done. Proud of his handiwork, he went to Sleeping Giant&#39;s inn to present it to Delphine. Upon arrival, he noticed his uncle, lying dead in the corner of the inn, covered with a rug. Outraged, because Delphine hadn&#39;t informed him, he threw the ring at her. Alvor missed Delphine, and the ring hit the corner of a table. It split in half. Weakened by the power within it the diamond split along with the ring. Alvor then rushed over to his uncle, lifted him onto his shoulders, and stormed away. To this day, Delphine has kept the two rings on the same table that the ring had once split up upon.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=turquoise][b][u]COMMENT IF THE RING DOESN&#39;T WORK, WILL TRY TO FIX[/u]\r<br />All of the greedy who disenchanted the ring while still in 1.0: ahaahhhahah your loss, you can&#39;t bind the enchantment to another item :P (There were two rings on the table, other one dropped down, go pick it up if you disenchanted the ring(picture if unclear))[/b][/color]\r<br />[color=grey][b]New version has non-disenchantable ring[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=turquoise][size=4]As stated in the comments tab, I&#39;m 97,865% sure this works with the ACTUAL Lover&#39;s stone (and all of the other standing stones for that matter)[/size][/color]\r<br />[img]http://imgur.com/QXNLQUN[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=grey][size=4]Requires only an up-to-date, legit Skyrim[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=turquoise][size=4]Credits\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/3692783/?]ChampionKnifeFighter[/url] - Helped testing\r<br />Gamer1980Man - Idea\r<br />Elianora - forced me to make it non-disenchantable[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=grey][size=4]Permissions\r<br />Go nuts, credit me and them^[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=turquoise][size=4]Recommended: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53767/?]DovahBling[/url][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=grey][size=4]&#34;I was reading a bit on the forums, and on an unrelate topic someone recommended using Mod Organizer instead of Nexus Mod Manager.
