And without having to use a performance heavy ENB mod&#33; I can guarantee that most of you won&#39;t notice any drop in FPS when using this&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The title says &#34;Lightheads Realistic Lighting - SweetFX&#34;. I am Lighthead (or MrLighthead, if you please). This is a Nexus account I made some time ago and I just didn&#39;t use that name when I created it back then.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />1. Download the file manually.\r<br />2. Extract all the files from the archive.\r<br />3. Add all the files that you extracted to your Skyrim folder where your executable is located (should be in --&gt; steam/steamapps/common/skyrim)\r<br />4. Done&#33; Enjoy&#33; :)\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />1. Delete all the files from your Skyrim folder that you added there when installing SweetFX.\r<br />\r<br />They should be:\r<br />SweetFX (folder)\r<br />d3d9.dll\r<br />d3d9.fx\r<br />dxgi.dll\r<br />dxgi.fx\r<br />injector.ini\r<br />log.log\r<br />shader.fx\r<br />SweetFX readme.txt\r<br />SweetFX_preset.txt\r<br />SweetFX_settings.txt\r<br />\r<br />2.
