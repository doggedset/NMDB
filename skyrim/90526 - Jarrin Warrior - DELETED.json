  "summary": "Adds Jarrin Warriors into the game.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds leveled Jarrin Warriors into the game. they are mostly located on locations where bandit reside but they are not bandit faction meaning when you arrive you may find out all of them are dead and replaced by them.\n<br />They are always hostile to you and always carry jarrin roots ranging from 10 to 100.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Warning:[/b]\n<br />their sword has an absorb health of 200 which is the same when you eat a jarrin root raw making this not recommended for low level players but awesome if you want challenge. Their sword however are not lootable unless you fight the 'Jarrin legendary NPCs\" and will only spawn once you are 30-50 cause they are leveled.\n<br />\n<br />Since im new to modding i cant make them walk around skyrim so i just placed them on location where bandits/forsworn resides.\n<br />\n<br />Compatibility:\n<br />This mod has no scrips making this compatible on all mods.",
