  "summary": "(SFO not required)\r<br />Removes the grass around Lakeview Manor to make the yard look less overgrown with Skyrim Flora Overhaul or just the vanilla game.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Long time listener, first time caller here.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Details:\r<br />\r<br />I found that with SFO installed, the exterior of Lakeview Manor was just too overgrown. The grass almost completely covered the apiary, and I didn&#39;t even know where the hatch to the cellar was until I finished with this plugin.\r<br />\r<br />I switched the textures used in that cell to their grass-free equivalents (this means that the ground texture will be the EXACT same as before, just without any grass). The texture references here are the same as vanilla, so it should work for anybody as long as you don&#39;t have a mod that changes the actual terrain around Lakeview Manor. Texture packs are good to go, as I&#39;m using one in the screenshots. [b]Be advised that the screenshots are also comparing to SFO - Expanded Diversity, and not vanilla Skyrim[/b]\r<br />\r<br />If you play without Skyrim Flora Overhaul and still find there is too much grass or you&#39;re having clipping issues, this plugin will work for you too. It doesn&#39;t depend on SFO, nor does it reference it as a master.\r<br />\r<br />The texture repeating you see in the aerial shots is just the way Bethesda mapped the textures, and isn&#39;t visible from ground level, so I don&#39;t intend to change that. This mod is basically a one-off for personal use and learning my way around the Creation Kit, but I&#39;m open to suggestions.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Download Info:\r<br />\r<br />There are two versions of the mod; one which remove the grass all the way down the hill directly behind the house (probably nicer if you have the north extension), and one which leaves that grass alone for more of a cottage feel.\r<br />\r<br />There is a modified version of each of these for users of Lakeview Manor Road (file 27377).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Install Info:\r<br />\r<br />Just extract the ESP into your Skyrim data folder, or use your mod manager of choice.\r<br />\r<br />As far as load order goes, I would recommend to just make sure it goes after your last plugin that changes the exterior of Lakeview Manor (in unlikely cases this may undo changes made by these mods though). If you still see grass have a look in TESVEdit to see what&#39;s overriding it and/or leave a comment about it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />TL;DR:\r<br />\r<br />Gets rid of the grass surrounding the house at Lakeview Manor, works best for SFO users but doesn&#39;t require it, plays nice with texture packs and with a well-kept lawn like that you&#39;ll get the man/woman/goat of your dreams in no-time.",
