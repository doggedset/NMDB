  "summary": "A mobile fortress you can take with you on your journeys",
  "descriptionHtml": "Scarlet\\'s Planar Fortress, having since been lost and abandoned, has found its way back into the world of Tamriel. A mysterious book, and some darkly colored gems have found their way into your sack upon your travels, with no indication as to how they got there. Scarlet\\'s fortress was designed to serve the owner as a place of emergency shelter, allowing quick evasion of swarms of goblins coming at you in the blink of an eye; with no indication as to where the user had gone. It also includes all the necessities for any given practical situation, and with enough food and supplies to last a month.\r\n\r\nUse your new home to your desires, whether it is to seek shelter in the rain, quickly drop off loot in the middle of a dungeon raid, or simply to enjoy the magical atmosphere that Scarlet\\'s fortress has to offer. \r\n\r\nSimply spawn your Planar Portal through the Scar Ritual and enter your home!\r\n\r\n*Please note:*\r\nAlthough perfectly playable and functional, this is a Work In Progress. There is much I would like to add in order for this to meet its true potential. As is, currently will work perfectly as intended. Future updates \r\n\r\nwill allow this mod to be more than just a simple home, with a full fledged set of quests in play.\r\nAlso, due to a now know issue with the new Skyrim Scripting System, any old fragments will continue to use the old scripts that are stored in the save. Any new fragments you create will not be affected.\r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n- Garden\r\n- Smithing Area\r\n- Alchemy Lab\r\n- Enchanter\\'s Table\r\n- Kitchen\r\n- Critters\r\n- Mining Area (Incomplete)\r\n\r\n*If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or bugs please let me know! I am very open to constructive criticism and would love to hear yours!*\r\n\r\nForum Link:\r\nhttp://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1347458-relz-wip-scarlets-mobile-fortress\r\n\r\nIf you have issues you absolutely want me to see, post them there. I will check these often, but not as much as the forum topic.\r\n\r\n- - - \\\"Uncommon\\\" Legend - - -\r\n[NxtVer] = Next Version\r\n[UnImp] = Unimplimented\r\n\r\n- - - Update Progress - - -\r\n[UnImp] Scarlet & Violet\r\n[UnImp] Unique Quest for upgrades and background story\r\n[UnImp] Better \\\"Beauty\\\" factor / Improve looks\r\n[ToDo] Fix Companion following inside the house....
