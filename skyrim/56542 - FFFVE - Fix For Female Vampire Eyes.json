  "descriptionHtml": "Introduction\r<br />----------\r<br />So first of all you probably are thinking &#34;Oh look it&#39;s one of those vampire eye fixes again. We didn&#39;t have enough of those already&#33;&#34; That&#39;s okay, because I&#39;d be thinking the same thing, but just hear me out for a moment before clicking that &#34;Go back&#34; -button on your browser.\r<br />\r<br />I was browsing the Internet for a mod that would fix the stupid eye bug for quite a bit of time, and the only ones I found didn&#39;t have the Dawnguard&#39;s eyes for both males and females, so the eyes on a female would look exactly the same as a male&#39;s. That&#39;s when I decided to try out my modding skills by making my very first mod, &#34;FFFVE&#34;&#33; (Quite a name for a simple bug fix, isn&#39;t it? ;) )\r<br />\r<br />About the mod\r<br />----------\r<br />This fix addresses an issue that causes a female vampire character&#39;s eyes to display the color &#34;hazel brown&#34; instead of the vampiric red. Usually the bug does not happen within the vanilla game, but most mods that add customizable colors for hair and such (i.e. &#34;DartHairColors&#34; by Dart98Rock) seem to cause it.\r<br />\r<br />The mod should be compatible with anything, since it just changes a few HeadPart values. Remember to read the &#39;NOTE&#39; under &#39;Installation&#39;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Installation\r<br />----------\r<br />Option A: Use the Nexus Mod Manager (recommended)\r<br />\r<br />Option B: Select the proper download - depending on whether you have Dawnguard installed       or not - and extract the .rar file into your Skyrim&#92;Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*NOTE* Make sure (I&#39;m going to use a hair color mod as an example) you CHOOSE YOUR HAIR COLOR BEFORE you install the mod. Whenever you want to \r<br />       change the color, disable this fix first and re-enable it when done&#33; The colors wont show up otherwise.\r<br />\r<br />*WARNING* Make sure you have this fix AFTER your hair color / other color mods in the load order&#33; Will not work otherwise&#33; Also if you don&#39;t have          Dawnguard installed and select it from the autoinstaller / download the wrong version, your game WILL crash on startup&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Author: TheS0m3b0dy\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;",
