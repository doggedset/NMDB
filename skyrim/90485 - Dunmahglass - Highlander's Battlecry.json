  "descriptionHtml": "If anyone's played For Honor, it's likely you've heard the Highlander shout \"Dunmahglass!\"\n<br />\n<br />Well, I thought I'd throw together a small mod that added a shout where you can do just that. The shout gives a damage buff to the user for a very short time, but the cooldown is just as short.\n<br />\n<br />Currently, this mod needs a lot more work, but since I finally got a version working, I'm uploading it just to get it out there. I still need to edit the values and sound a little bit. That's why I marked the version as beta, if you didn't notice. I didn't notice a big difference in the damage, but I'll work it out soon.\n<br />\n<br />In the future, I also plan on having the shout lower defenses as well (since the highlander cannot block in offensive form).",
