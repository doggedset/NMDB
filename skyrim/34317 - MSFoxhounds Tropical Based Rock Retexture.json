Slightly volcanic based, all purpose rocks for normal and tropical Skyrim. In addition, it seems very good at Solstheim. Textures at 4096x4096 size, so its for moderate rigs at least. It doesn\\'t need any of previous DLC\\'s, but it works good with them.\r\n\r\nScreenshot are wolcoming gladly!!!\r\n\r\nBest regards...",
