  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i.minus.com/ibthUFP1cN6GtX.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b][color=red]* No longer a necessary patch, with the arrival of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28467]ReProccer - Automated SkyRe patch generator[/url], but I will keep the file in case anyone doesn\\'t use the ReProccer, or needs it for whatever reason. *[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nI am a huge fan of Skyrim Redone, and the work with Stormcloak Explorer Armor was incredible. I wanted to bring them together.\r\n\r\nThis mod changes the armor value of [URL=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26840]Stormcloak Explorer Armor[/URL] to match [URL=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286]SkyRe[/URL] armor values (namely a little stronger than the Stormcloak Officer/Heroic Armor). Changed according to t3nd0\\'s formula. Also meltdown options were added, if you have the according perks for it. It can be improved with steel ingots in a workbench.\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]:\r\nUse NMM for an easy install. Load the mod after the Stormcloak Explorer Armor mod. The main mod file is required, and t3nd0\\'s Skyrim redone. This patch should not be used without Stormcloak Explorer Armor\\'s esp, unexpected things may happen.\r\n\r\nManual installation: Unzip the files to ...\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\ and you should be good to go, don\\'t forget to enable the mod.\r\nTo uninstall, simply remove Stormcloak Explorer Armor - SkyRE Compatibility.esp.\r\n\r\n[b]Permissions[/b]: \r\n\r\nPlease do not upload this mod to Steam Workshop, you are free to change the armor values and whatnot, but please contact the original creators of the mods involved before uploading anything.\r\n\r\n[b]Credits[/b]:\r\n\r\nENB used in logo picture is [URL=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24828]UNBLEAK[/URL], by [URL=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/528208]trustinall[/URL].
