  "descriptionHtml": "first, i would like to give credit to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4757797]squidgy617[/url] for his craftable clothes mod. \r<br />this mod lets you craft clothes at a tanning rack. (i was going to use the spinning wheel resource mod, but nords dont use spinning wheels, they use looms. and the only loom resource i can find requires the use of another mod which isnt lore friendly to me, so anyway long story short: tanning racks are pretend looms. deal with it&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />anyway, most clothes are made from 1 linen wrap, some tundra cotton, leather strips and some extra material based on what kind of clothing it is. example: the fancy upper class clothing requires some pelts for the fur cloak on the back, and etc. look at the screen shots for details.\r<br />also, all the clothes require some form of coloring material based on what color they are, but i didnt want to create a new item called dye, so you just use the raw material in the game: like creep cluster for the red based clothes, or void salts for gray, or grass pods for green, etc.\r<br />\r<br />some clothes are quest locked: so you cannot craft the college clothes unless you have finished the first quest. same with dark brotherhood, and so on.\r<br />\r<br />finally: i have added a few tanning racks and materials to radiant raiment in solitude, in their basement, so it actually looks like they make clothes in conjunction with this mod. tried to make it as lore friendly as possible.\r<br />\r<br />one last thing, you should use this mod with my other one: craftable children clothes and linen wrap: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57414/? \r<br />so you can easily make straw into linen wraps (requires hearthfire tho)\r<br />\r<br />compatibilities: i have seen problems with the mod clothing and clutter fixes, but if you load my mod after it, no problems, unless you dont mind name problems for the clothes.",
