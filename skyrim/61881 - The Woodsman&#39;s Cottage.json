  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6]The Woodsman&#39;s Cottage[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]This home was created for my main Skyrim Role playing character who is a huntsman and general outdoorsy dude. Its basically an abandoned lumber camp that has been turned into a small but useful player home. It is located just north of Falkreath Hold right on beautiful lake Ilinalta. It would be hard to find a more charming location (If of course you don&#39;t mind the rival lumber yard down the road being owned by blood thirsty night walkers)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Some quick info on the crib[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Sits inside of an actual saw mill, just like the one in riverwood. Except this one is far prettier. And shiny.\r<br />Has a dock that leads to your own private fishing spot (currently just decorative)\r<br />Full crafting support in the basement\r<br />   Forge? Check\r<br />   Tanning? Check?\r<br />   Smelting and Armor/Weapon Improvement? Check and Check&#33;\r<br />   Ventilation? [size=1]Ugh, well, what doesn&#39;t kill you...[/size]\r<br />Follower Bedroom in the basement next to the forge. Don&#39;t worry about the smoke, think of it as a natural sleep aid&#33;\r<br />Upstairs has a full kitchen, a dining room, and the super duper woodsy styled master bedroom Be mindful of splinters\r<br />\r<br />VERSION 1.1\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1 is identical to the original with one exception. Due to Woodaxsa&#39;s suggestion, I have added a small garden and garden shed to the outside of the home. Fell free to check it out. Thanks for the Suggestion Woodaxsa&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Please read this as well\r<br />[/size]\r<br />I love to get feedback. If you have any bug reports to shoot my way, or possible ideas, I like to hear it all. Even the mean things&#33; I&#39;m sure given enough time I will cut you down with my rapier wit.\r<br />I will also take a look at any screenshots if you want them posted (given they are family friendly, yes I&#39;m looking at you. You know who you are)\r<br />\r<br />And thats about it. I&#39;ll end it with some credits\r<br />\r<br />Skeeter (Me)\r<br />Woodaxsa (For the garden suggestion)",
