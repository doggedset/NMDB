You see... Hoth has a unique hobby - he wears his most prized kills. He has collected on some of the highest bounties for monsters and men alike in his days wandering the frigid northlands of Skyrim - and he means to show off his work.\n<br />\n<br />His armor was crafted from the ribcage of a tyrannical giant lord who sought to unite the disparate giants in conquest. His cloak - hewn from the pelt of an ageless winter bear who long terrorized the outskirt towns of the North... strong enough to charge straight through a city's fortified wall. His gloves were fashioned with hand bones ripped off an elder daedra cultist - while he was mid-spellcast. On his shoulder he binds the skull of the most recent man he has killed, regardless of merit. Perhaps his finest trophy is mounted on a wooden haft struck from Eldergleam herself - the indestructible skull of an ancient and majestic white stag. It is said that gods and deadra test great men with such a beast.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/jtQsGGe.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[center][youtube]lIBovziypaU[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[center]I have my own [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWs5zR6JyBBoXaGisJ3OOgw]YouTube channel[/url] where I post about my mods.
