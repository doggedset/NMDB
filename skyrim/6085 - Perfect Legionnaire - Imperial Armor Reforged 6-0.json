And most of all: enjoy&#33; ;-)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u]Essential Credits - First things first:[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />This modification is inspired by and probably would not be in existence without [size=3][color=green]Aremeta[/color][/size]&#39;s very good Imperial Legion Armor mod. From her or him I got the initial idea of making use of the General Tullius armor mesh for the trooper armor and found orientation of how to link my reworked textures with the corresponding mesh files. That being said, Aremeta deserves a great portion of the credit for this mod&#33; I would very much like to link to her/his mod in this place, but it does not exist anymore on the Nexus. Nevertheless, I want and have to clearly express my thanks and appreciation for Aremeta&#39;s fine work &#33; [color=red]Update:[/color] Aremeta kindly sent me the assets of his original mod, which deserves another big &#34;thank you&#34;. :)\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=green]morpheas768[/color][/size] provided a cool and convenient NMM Installer for Version 2.0.

A few small texture gaps, a bit of clipping from combining models, being a noob with crude tools. There is a noticeable &#34;texture hole&#34; on the INSIDE of the skirt texture When crouching and looking at the crouching character or NPC from the front, from a low camera angle. This applies to the [color=green]studded armor[/color] and [color=green]Tullius armor[/color]. I suspect this to be an easily fixable texture issue, but sadly not for a person of my limited experience. Sorry for the inconvenience - but I believe the mod is already fine as is. It is a work of love and I hope you will enjoy nevertheless&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u]FAQ[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Q[/size]: Why don&#39;t the textures show up ingame...?\r<br />[size=3]A[/size]: You are very likely using the Skyrim High-Res Texture DLC, which has issues with other texture mods because these high res textures are added to the game in a rather... insensitive way by Bethesda.\r<br />[color=green]There is a rather easy fix/workaround though:[/color] Please refer to this [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SscPmV57JPw]video[/url] or [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/555176-bethesda-hd-pack-override]forum thread[/url]&#33;\r<br />Sorry for the inconvenience - although Bethesda should say the same I guess... :) \r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Q[/size]: &#34;I love this, but it looks odd that a low rank would have such great armour...&#34; (Morganite)\r<br />[size=3]A[/size]: Thanks for the compliment&#33; :) The main reason is: This armor was inspired by one of the legion trooper armors from &#34;TES 3 - Morrowind&#34;. I loved that armor and just wanted that thing in Skyrim. I think a proud and disciplined army like the Imperial Legion just deserves some style&#33; Even a low ranked trooper. Furthermore, I plan to work on the higher tier Imperial armors too, which then hopefully results in a proper and fitting overall picture.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Q[/size]: Why did you replace the studded armor and not the heavy one?\r<br />[size=3]A[/size]: Because I wanted to replace Skyrim&#39;s standard trooper armor, which is the light and studded one, with TES 3 Morrowind&#39;s (kind of) standard trooper armor: [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/File:MW_Armor_ImperialSteelM.jpg]Imperial Steel Armor[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Q[/size]: But this used to be a heavy steel armor in Morrowind&#33;\r<br />[size=3]A[/size]: Perfectly right. But for Skyrim I took the liberty to consider my reworked armor as a kind of studded/hardened/boiled leather armor similar to this one: [url=http://www.battle-axe.org/rpg/images/Boiled_leather.gif]Boiled Armor[/url] instead of being a steelish heavy armor. I deem that quite fitting for the standard legionnaire.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Q[/size]: There are a lot of files - why?\r<br />[size=3]A[/size]: To keep things modular and file size small. Different people like different things.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Q[/size]: Will you rework other Imperial gear?\r<br />[size=3]A[/size]: I will try to&#33; I cannot guarantee to come up with anything decent though, but at least I will try to&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Q[/size]: What&#39;s next on the agenda?\r<br />[size=3]A[/size]: See &#34;Future Plans&#34; above, please.\r<br />  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u]Description and Motivation:[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />This mod introduces reworked versions of the Imperial and General Tullius armors and shield, thereby re-introducing the classic and beloved Morrowind style to Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Why?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]A proud legion has a history&#33;[/size]\r<br />I always greatly liked Morrowind and its style - especially regarding the design and appearance of the proud Imperial Legion.\r<br />Skyrim&#39;s original light and studded imperial armor were somewhat... bland... in my eyes. The studded armor in particular. And i never liked those clunky vanilla shields\r<br />The legion just didn&#39;t appear to be a force to be reckoned with. That needs to be changed&#33;\r<br />This is my contribution and humble attempt to address that issue - and to re-introduce some much needed style and seriousness.\r<br />At least in my eyes. ;-)\r<br />[size=3]Enjoy&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u]Installation / Uninstallation:[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Either just drop / remove the files into / from your Skyrim folder, or use the Nexus Mod Manager.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u]Credits:[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Aremeta\r<br />Davis237834\r<br />Jedo_Dre\r<br />navida1\r<br />rahman530\r<br />morpheas768\r<br />Bethesda\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u]My other Skyrim mods:[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2215]\r<br />Female Underwear Retex[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3679]Bards Delight - A Lute Reworked in Three Flavors[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]If you like any modder&#39;s work, if you appreciate what you see and experience, feel free to state and show it -  by endorsing and / or by providing constructive feedback.
