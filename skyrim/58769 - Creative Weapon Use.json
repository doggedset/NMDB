  "modName": "Creative Weapon Use",
  "summary": "This mod replaces 9444 items/tools into weapons. This allows you to equip, use and also craft several items and tools as weapons. Always wanted to test out a farm shovel on your enemies, use a tankard in a bar brawl, play Dr. Draugr with a nordic scalpel or bash your spouses head in with a cast iron pot? Now you can.",
  "descriptionHtml": "In this mod you can pick up, equip (as weapons) and fight using a number of items and tools found in Skyrim. All vanilla items (currently replaces 9444 items) are replaced with exact replicas of themselves but now you are able to pick them up, equip them and use them as a weapon. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Currently Featured Weapons:[/b]\r<br />- Shovel (2h)\r<br />- Iron Shovel (2h)\r<br />- Hoe (2h)\r<br />- Pitchfork (2x) (2h)\r<br />- Clothes Iron (1h)\r<br />- Tankard (1h)\r<br />- Hook (1h)\r<br />- Soul Gem Holder (2h)\r<br />- Saw (1h)\r<br />- Cast Iron Pot (1h)\r<br />- Dining Fork (1h)\r<br />- Dining Knife (1h)\r<br />- Broom (2h)\r<br />- Blacksmith Hammer (1h)\r<br />- Blacksmith Tongs (1h)\r<br />- Ruins Tool Set (4x 1h) (Scalpel, Brainpick, Knife, Scissors) \r<br />- Silver Goblet (2x 1h)\r<br />- Silver Jug (1h)\r<br />- Silver Candlestick (3x 1h)\r<br />\r<br />All of them have working blood decals when you use them on enemies. Damage, range and swing speed are lore-friendly.\r<br />Get psycho with the saws, pitchforks and iron pots&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Important note:[/b]\r<br />Items/Tools you find out in the world are NOT compatible with followers and unfortunately they are never going to be since they have to use different models for all the object replacements to work correctly. \r<br />\r<br />If you want your follower to wield the items/tools, you will have to either craft them at a Blacksmith Forge or loot them of off enemy/friendly NPCs that wield them (items/tools have been added to leveledlists so some npc&#39;s spawn with the items).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\r<br />Just unpack into Skyrim/Data folder. You know the deal.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility:[/b]\r<br />Should be mostly compatible with &#39;Interactive Clutter&#39; for all items except &#39;Dining Fork&#39;, &#39;Dining Knife&#39;, &#39;Hoe&#39; and &#39;Hook&#39;. To use CWU, place it higher in your load order. When using together, TES5Edit Mergepatch and WryeBash patch should be used (although you should probably do that for all your mods ;) ).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Recommended Mods:\r<br />[/b]-For improved textures on the items/tools: Skyrim Ultra HD Texture Pack by MysteryModder: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35507/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35507/[/url]? \r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />-&#34;This mod is incompatible with the ultimate encounter aka Sands of time.&#34;\r<br />-The mod replaces a lot of Misc objects with their usable weapon counterparts. Any mod that relies on one of these items might cause issues with it (fortunately, not a lot of mods rely on a random pitchfork lying around though, so it should be fine in the majority of cases). This is very easy to verify with TES5Edit. If you suspect a conflict with another mod, verify in TES5Edit.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Future updates:[/b]\r<br />-Add more items to use as weapons\r<br />-Improve havoc/collision of dropped weapons (only applies to crafted/looted weapons)\r<br />-Create Blacksmithing Guild Quest Line Mod\r<br />-Create a .bsa file instead of loose files in meshes folder\r<br />\r<br />[b]No-No&#39;s:\r<br />[/b]This mod does not and will not touch commonly used items in other mods such as: firewood01, empty wine bottle, ingots, etc.\r<br />This mod will not touch statics or movable statics (with one or two exceptions), only MiscObjects.",
