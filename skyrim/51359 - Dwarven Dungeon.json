  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod. I have just started modding skyrim and I like it. Anyways to the mod. Its the beginning of a dwarven dungeon that I still have a lot of work on. This dungeon will in the end have a nice dwarven house at the end of the dungeon, but don&#39;t worry I&#39;l add a door somewhere outside the dungeon to get into the house when you get the key, I&#39;ll also make it a kind of hard dungeon to finish. :)\r<br />\r<br />The entrance is across the river at riverwood.\r<br />\r<br />Going to try to make it as lore friendly as possible.\r<br />\r<br />Also remember to back up everything as it is a Beta and anything can go wrong.",
