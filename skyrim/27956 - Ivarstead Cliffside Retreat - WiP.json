  "descriptionHtml": "Thanks for taking the time to view this mod.\r\n[img]http://i293.photobucket.com/albums/mm57/vegasfirebird/Nexus/ScreenShot66_zps445c2a49.jpg?t=1355886756[/img]\r\n\r\n......................................................................................................................................\r\n\r\nIt\\'s a pretty simple design player home located in the mountains of Ivarstead.  It sits just above a waterfall/swimming paradise!  Enjoy the majestic views and lush scenery.\r\n\r\nIn the swimming area you\\'ll find benches for cooling off in the water, a trap door that allows you to fast travel back to the diving board, and beautifully lit waterfalls!  The view at night is nothing short of glorious.  And the swimming area offers a rich bounty of fish, butterflies, dragonflies and torch bugs!\r\n\r\nThe interior is a basic hunters cabin layout.  I tried to match the overall design with how it looks on the outside.  This mod is very much a WIP (work in progress) and I will be updating once I\\'ve ironed out a few kinks.  Namely I need help with using weapons/shield racks as I haven\\'t yet been able to get them to \\\"activate\\\" in game.  But I am learning.  Feel free to check all 32 screen shots.  I will be uploading a video really soon.  Or maybe if you like this mod enough you\\'ll make an awesome vid for me ;)\r\n\r\nThis is my first official mod release here so be KIND!  :)  It shouldn\\'t conflict with anything that I know of?  Unless you happen to have another house located in the exact spot.\r\n\r\nAnd please any suggestions you may have will be noted.  Njoy the mod as I have in it\\'s creation!\r\n\r\nP.S. - To fast travel just type (tilde)~ coc ICRX (which means ivarsteadcliffsideretreatexterior)\r\n\r\nRecommended mods:\r\nRealistic Lighting Patcher - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7654\r\nSLOD Potions - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4259\r\nSLOD Wine Cellar - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4260\r\nCeltic and Braided Rugs - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7274\r\n\r\n*Thanks to Mr.Biggengaming (Video Guy)",
