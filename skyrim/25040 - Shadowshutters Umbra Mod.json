  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guy\\'s this is my first skyrim mod!\r\nI made this mod for a friend who really liked Oblivion\\'s Umbra sword.\r\nIt adds the  one handed sword Umbra and the Npc Umbra in an underground \\\"dungeon\\\" named The Usurpers Home near Anga\\'s Mill . There you must fight Umbra ( if you remember her from oblivion then you will know how tough she is) and recover the sword. She wears full ebony armor(except helmet) and you will find many goods in the dungeon. (Such as a big leveled items chest :-) )\r\nThe sword is a lore-friendly retexture of dawnbreaker and it\\'s not overpowered.It can also be upgraded with an ebony ingot in the grindstone.\r\nMaybe I\\' ll add a quest for the sword. \r\nPlz endorse if you like it. =)\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nBugs :\r\nNone that I know.\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nInstallation:\r\nI recommend you use the NMM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
