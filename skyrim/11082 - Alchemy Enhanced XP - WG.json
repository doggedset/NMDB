It does not break the game or make things too easy. On the contrary, Alchemy XP gain will feel similar to Smithing XP, and it makes Alchemy a lot more fun.\r\n\r\nVersion: 1.",

Let me know if there\\'s anything else you\\'d like to see in this mod, or any bugs that I can fix.\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n1.0 - Modified Alchemy Skill Use Multiplier from 0.75 to 0.9 (20% increase).\r\n1.01 - Added AEXP1.01 to \\\"Cheats\\\" category.\r\n\r\nThanks very much!\r\n\r\nOther WG Mods:\r\n\r\nItem Rewards For Bounties:  Adds a random leveled item as a reward upon quest completion, and changes bounty rewards to 250 gold for Bandits/Forsworn, 500 gold for Giants and 750 gold for dragons. \r\n\r\nUndying Companions: Makes all companions essential, meaning they cannot die by friendly or hostile damage. Exceptions: Erandur, Cicero and Eola.\r\n\r\nBreezehome Enchanting Table - Adds an enchanting table to Breezehome right next to the Alchemy Lab. Will only show up once Alchemy Lab decoration is purchased from Proventus in Dragonsreach. Mood lighting included.\r\n\r\nImproved Imperial Racial Abilities - Changes Voice of the Emperor ability to a +10 Speech bonus for people like me who never use Voice of the Emperor when they roll Imperial characters.\r\n\r\nGIANT Animals - Makes all animals, plus trolls, 3x bigger than normal. Just subscribe and walk around Skyrim - it\\'s GREAT for kicks.\r\n\r\nVisible Slaughterfish - Makes only slaughterfish 3x bigger so you can see them more easily.\r\n\r\nEvil Slaughterfish - Makes slaughterfish much more dangerous: 3x damage, 2.5x speed, 3.1x attack chance and 2x health.\r\n\r\nSkyscraper Giants - Makes giants 3x bigger.\r\n\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/WarriorG0el/myworkshopfiles/",
