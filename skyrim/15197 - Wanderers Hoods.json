  "descriptionHtml": "I was dissapointed to find all of Skyrims hoods had major flaws that made me stop looking badass, exept the ones that were atached to bathrobes. So i made this mod that makes all the colored monk robe hoods independant head pieces so they can be worn with any armor.\r\n\r\nAll 6 hoods are craftable (1 leather, 2 leather straps) and it comes in red, blue, black, gray, brown and green. I have made many mods for the elder scrolls games but this is the first that i think is worth uploading.\r\n\r\nHave fun looking badass!!",
