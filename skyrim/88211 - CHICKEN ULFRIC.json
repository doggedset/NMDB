  "descriptionHtml": "This lore friendly glorious mod changes Ulfric into a fully functional chicken&#33;&#33;&#33; With all of his dialogues, well, you maybe wondering &#39;why is that??&#39;.You see, my german grandfather always told me bed time stories, and say &#34;ya ya waffle mein kamf fuhrer schnitzel&#34; and as you might understand from these words, he was a nazi.\r<br />Anyways these words gave me a purpose in my filthy life. I was going to change some dude into a chicken and now I have reached my dreams&#33; To any of you out there wondering if you can do it - you too have the potential&#33;\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: I havent checked but there is no reason why this mod shouldnt work with the Ulfric follower mods cuz this just changes his race into some duplicate race I created. Enjoyyy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Special Thanks to:Georgia for this glorious desctiption\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />c:",
