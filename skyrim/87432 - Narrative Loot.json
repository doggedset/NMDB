  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][color=#6fa8dc]\r<br />[/color][center][i][size=6][u]Narrative Loot[/u][/size][/i][/center]\r<br />Narrative Loot adds 1,629 miscellaneous items to chests, pockets, and vendors. [font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4]Including new paintings, new decorative books, and new types of dinnerware.[/size][/font][/size][/font] [font=Palatino Linotype][size=4]All of the items are lore-friendly and blend into the game&#39;s pre-existing themes.\r<br />\r<br />Changes are done entirely through &#34;loot lists&#34; — there aren&#39;t any cell edits, so it should be compatible with anything you throw at it. If you use multiple loot list mods, then you could combine this using a [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6837/]Bashed Patch[/url], (or simply load this mod last, so that this mod&#39;s changes take priority).[/size][/font] This mod primarily affects the miscellaneous item loot lists, as well as chests and vendors. This won&#39;t affect the weapons that spawn on actors.\r<br />\r<br />When you open a chest, you&#39;ll have a chance to find certain items added by this mod. You might find new styles of pottery in a commoner&#39;s chest, or perhaps uncover unbeforeseen Dwemer gadgets from a Dwemer dungeon. Bandit chests will sometimes contain paintings, which you can sell, or even hang on your wall. Skeletons will sometimes drop bones and skulls. Necromancers and other rogue mages will carry strange and obscene things. Civil War combatants might carry valuable missives. The mod adds more variety to loot, with an emphasis towards deepening storytelling through loot. \r<br />\r<br />There have been many loot mods since Skyrim&#39;s initial release, and this one intends to stand above, by the sheer number of brand new items added to the game, and by the quality of content and implementation. This mod is a compilation of over 21 peoples&#39; work, from modelers and texturers to brush artists and collision work. This mod doesn&#39;t change every loot list out there — instead, it makes precise edits to add the included content, thus maintaining the widest possible compatibility. This mod has been designed for Skyrim Special Edition from the ground-up.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/lQSX6fE.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />The mod is a compilation of several modders&#39; resources, plus re-purposed vanilla assets. Here are the Modder&#39;s Resources within:[/size][/font]\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4]\r<br />A gargantuan amount of new plates, bowls, goblets, and other wares have been added [font=Palatino Linotype][size=4](1,482+)[/size][/font]. These can be found randomly in cabinets and chests. Each region has a unique type of pottery available for sale — Whiterun has a unique &#39;Snowberry&#39; ceramic type, Falkreath a &#39;Juniper&#39; type, and Solstheim has a wide selection of Morrowind-themed glass, Redoran, Hlaalu, and Telvanni styles. There are a stunning 57 new styles in total. Some of these styles are craftable, including Iron, Steel, and Glass, enabling a player to start out their game as a common smith, and then progress into working Steel and ultimately Glass. Many of these dinnerware styles are available only from dungeon chests, such as the Black Glass, Tarnished, and ruined styles. This is one of the most ambitious item additions to Skyrim, finally released in playable form. Check out the pictures for examples (although I captured nowhere near the full scope of this addition). [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24883/](Morrowind Style Clutter)[/url]\r<br />[u][b]\r<br />[/b][/u]61 painting types may be found in chests throughout the land, and for sale at general goods merchants. You can sell these paintings, or hang them in your home. The paintings are fantastic renditions of screenshots, passed through a filter that makes them look as if they are hand-painted. Check out the screenshots for what each one looks like, plus its ID should you want to spawn a specific one. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17423/](Paintings and Frames)[/url]\r<br />[u][b]\r<br />[/b][/u]24 decorative skill-books also added, which can train the player&#39;s skills when examined. Hidden in dungeon chests or available from merchants, each book has stellar page art, and looks awesome when laid out on a desk. I&#39;ve given them lore-friendly names, and matched each one to a relevant skill, which they raise on examining for the first time. There&#39;s even a Non-Automatic Skill Book patch available, if you desire more control over your skill gains. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/78766/](Open Books)[/url]\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve also included around 62 new treasures and miscellaneous items, which can be found in chests and in pockets. These have all been introduced where they make the most sense. Forsworn will have more bones and tribal items, Civil War actors may hold valuable missives, Snow Elf chests may contain ancient Falmer jewels, Skeletons will sometimes drop skulls or bones, and much more.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][img]https://i.imgur.com/TnkEGsC.jpg[/img][/size][/font][/center][b]\r<br />[/b]The artworks seen here have been created by their original authors, who were kind and fore-sighted enough to release their work openly, so that others can add onto it and bring it forward. Major kudos to them — we wouldn&#39;t still be here without such an awesome, collaborative, and free modding community. Let&#39;s always keep it this way.[b]\r<br />\r<br />[/b]I wanted to keep this mod lore-friendly, and balance it as well as I could, while maintaining the best possible compatibility. My intention is to blend the items into the game such that they are a pleasure to find, while also not detracting from gameplay or &#34;stealing the show&#34;. The items are also implemented such that they don&#39;t affect balance too much — new Dwemer items are just as valuable as pre-existing ones, and the new paintings are just as valuable as other bandit treasures. The mod is highly compatible, and more than that, it inherently extends out into new modded dungeons and lands. So long as mod level designers have used the vanilla chests and loot lists, you will be able to find these items anywhere in Tamriel.\r<br />[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][center][/center][b][center][size=6][i][img]https://i.imgur.com/AUAEUFi.png[/img][/i][/size][/center][/b]These new items will randomly spawn in addition to what these chests already contained in the Vanilla game. As a result, chests will carry more wealth than they do in the vanilla game. I&#39;d recommend counter-balancing this mod by adding difficulty mods. Personally, I use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/645/]iNeed[/url], Frostfall, plus [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/156/]Extended Stay[/url] to customize inn rental prices. This will simply add more treasures to your game, so I recommend using difficulty mods to balance it.\r<br />\r<br />These are the items which may additionally spawn in chests:\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/font][center][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][u][color=#d5a6bd][b]Noble Cupboards & Chests[/b][/color][/u]\r<br />Paintings\r<br />Decorative Books\r<br />[/size][/font][size=3][size=4][font=Palatino Linotype]Dinnerware in Noble Styles*[/font][/size][/size]\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4]\r<br />[color=#dd7e6b][b][u]Upper Cupboards & Chests[/u][/b][/color]\r<br />Paintings\r<br />Dinnerware in Noble Styles*\r<br />Dinnerware in Common Styles*\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#f9cb9c][b]Common Cupboards & Chests[/b][/color][/u]\r<br />[size=3][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4]Dinnerware in Common Styles[b]*[/b][/size][/font][/size]\r<br />[size=3][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4]Horned Candles and Candelabrum[/size][/font][/size]\r<br />[size=3][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4]Imperial Candelabrum[/size][/font][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][color=#f6b26b]Bandit Chests[/color]\r<br />[/b][/u]Paintings\r<br />Dinnerware in Noble Styles*\r<br />Dinnerware in Treasure Styles* (Boss Chests Only)\r<br />\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][u][color=#93c47d][b]Nordic Ruins Chests[/b][/color][/u]\r<br />Dinnerware in Ruins Styles*\r<br />Ancient Nordic Horns[/size][/font]\r<br />Frost Giant Skulls (rare)\r<br />\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][u][color=#8e7cc3][b]Warlock Chests[/b][/color]\r<br />[/u]Paintings\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4]Decorative Skill Books[/size][/font][/size][/font]\r<br />Decomposing body parts\r<br />Human bones (clean & bloody)\r<br />Bloody, Etched, and Engraved Skulls\r<br />Black Glass Dinnerware\r<br />Void Stones[/size][/font] (rare)\r<br />Alembic\r<br />\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][u][color=#e06666][b]Vampire Chests[/b][/color]\r<br />[/u]Paintings\r<br />Decorative Skill Books\r<br />Bloody Goblets & Tankards\r<br />Decomposing body parts\r<br />Bloody Skulls\r<br />Black Glass Dinnerware\r<br />Dinnerware in Treasure Styles*\r<br />Vampiric Chalice[/size][/font] (rare)\r<br />[u][b]\r<br />[color=#93c47d]Forsworn Chests[/color]\r<br />[/b][/u]Bark\r<br />Etched, Human, & Hawk Skulls\r<br />Clean Bones\r<br />Gilded Bones\r<br />Carved Werewolf Skulls (rare)[u][b]\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u][/size][/font][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][u][color=#ffe599][b]Dwemer Chests[/b][/color][b]\r<br />[/b][/u]Dwemer Cubes (Broken, Active, Inert)\r<br />Dwemer Geodes\r<br />Dwemer Mechanisms\r<br />Dwemer Drills\r<br />Dinnerware in Dwemer Styles*\r<br />\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][u][color=#b4a7d6][b]Falmer Chests[/b][/color][b]\r<br />[/b][/u]Human bones (clean & bloody)\r<br />Deer skulls[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#cfe2f3][b]Snow Elf Chests[/b][/color][b]\r<br />[/b][/u]Falmer Jewels\r<br />Weystones\r<br />Falmer Ewers\r<br />[color=#e06666]\r<br />[/color][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][u][color=#6fa8dc][b]Solstheim Reaver Chests[/b][/color][b]\r<br />[/b][/u]Paintings\r<br />Dinnerware in Morrowind Styles*[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][u][color=#a4c2f4][b]Solstheim Riekling Chests[/b][/color][b]\r<br />[/b][/u]Paintings\r<br />Dinnerware in Morrowind Styles*[/size][/font][/size][/font]\r<br />Clean Bones\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][size=5][i][size=6][/size][/i][/size][/size][/size][/font][img]https://i.imgur.com/wdRToQL.png[/img][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][size=4]\r<br />[/size][/size][/font][/center][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][size=4][size=4]These new items are added in addition to what these NPC types already have — I haven&#39;t removed anything that already existed. As a result, actors will hold slightly more wealth than they already have, but it shouldn&#39;t be \r<br />more than 20gp each on average. I&#39;d recommend balancing this by using one of the many combat mods (I use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1368/]Wildcat[/url]) or by increasing the in-game difficulty through other means.\r<br />\r<br />These are the items which have a chance to spawn in faction actor pockets. I&#39;ve added them in the spirit of placing new and interesting &#39;pocket valuables&#39;, while also adding small amount of non-valuable &#39;character loot&#39;:\r<br />[/size][/size][/size][/font][center][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][size=4]\r<br />[/size][color=#dd7e6b][size=5]Imperials[/size][/color][size=3]\r<br />Missives[/size][size=3]\r<br />Cyrodilic Brandy\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][size=3]More wines[/size][/size][/font]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=5]Stormcloaks[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]Missives[/size][size=3]\r<br />Drinking horns[/size][size=3]\r<br />Hides\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][size=3]More mead[/size][/size][/font]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[color=#93c47d][size=5]Forsworn[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]Human & hawk skulls[/size][size=3]\r<br />Common ingredients[/size][size=3]\r<br />Gilded Bones[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#999999][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][size=5]Draugr[/size][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][size=3]Ancient Nordic Torcs\r<br />Human bones[/size][/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][font=Palatino Linotype][color=#8e7cc3][size=4][size=5]Warlocks[/size][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][size=3]Human bones (clean & bloody)[/size][/size][/font][/size][/font][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/font][/center][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][size=4][center][size=5][b][i][img]https://i.imgur.com/3YZni9n.png[/img]\r<br />[/i][/b][/size][/center]These new dinnerware styles are all created by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/150604/]The_Funktasm[/url], from his phenomenal modder&#39;s resource [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24883/]Morrowind Style Clutter[/url]. There are a jaw-dropping 1,708 new items added by him, and NarrativeLoot implements almost all of them in the game. If you enjoy decorating your house, or yearn for the variety of styles that Morrowind had, you will likely be very pleased by what he&#39;s done. Check out the screenshots to see some examples.\r<br />\r<br />These styles are all available in various cupboards and chests. I&#39;ve also set up the regional styles to regularly spawn at general goods traders in those regions. Enjoy — these have been a gargantuan effort, primarily by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/150604/]The_Funktasm[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Here are all the styles; there are 57 texture styles, each with 26 models available in-game.\r<br />[u]\r<br />[/u][/size][/size][/font][center][size=4][font=Palatino Linotype][color=#d5a6bd][b][font=Palatino Linotype][u][b]Noble Styles\r<br />[/b][/u][/font][/b][font=Palatino Linotype][font=Palatino Linotype]Steel, Brass, Bronze, Imperial, Akaviri, Reman, Windhelm, Dawnstar, Winterhold, Burnished, Haafingar, Snowberry, Juniper, Peach Glass[/font][/font][/color][b]\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/font][font=Palatino Linotype][color=#f9cb9c][u][b]Common Styles[/b][/u]\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype]Ceramic, Clay, Painted, Blue, Red, Green, White, Steel, Iron, Cyrodillic, Imperial, Septim, Windhelm, Dawnstar, Winterhold, Snowberry, Juniper, Bottles[/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b4a7d6][b][u]Morrowind Styles[/u]\r<br />[/b][font=Palatino Linotype]Redoran, Telvanni, Hlaalu, Redware, Blue Glass, Green Glass, Peach Glass, Yellow Glass, Bottles[/font][/color][b]\r<br />\r<br />[/b][color=#ffe599][b][u]Dwemer Styles[/u]\r<br />[/b]Brass, [/color][font=Palatino Linotype][color=#ffe599]Bronze, Dwarven, Dwemer Variant, Dwemer Gold[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#efefef][u][b]Ruins Styles\r<br />[/b][/u]Tarnished, Rusted, Nordic, Bronze, Iron, Limeware, Rippled\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffe599][u][b]Treasures Styles[/b][/u]\r<br />[b]G[/b]ilded, Extravagant, Ornate, Gold[/color]\r<br />[/color][/font][/font][/size][/center]\r<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][size=4][size=5][b][i][center][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][b][size=6][i]\r<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/VtygGDp.png[/img]\r<br />[/i][/size][/b][/size][/font][font=Palatino Linotype][size=4][size=4]I&#39;ve added the Iron, Steel, and Blue Glass styles as craftable, so you can make them at the forge if you have the prerequisite perks.
