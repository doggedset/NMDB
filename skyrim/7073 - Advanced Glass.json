  "descriptionHtml": "Once you know how to work with glass and then learn the secrets of dragonscale, you can apply those techniques to create advanced glass armor and weapons -- the weight of glass, but the protective qualities of dragonscale and the damage-dealing capabilities of ebony!\r\n\r\nCharacters with both the Glass and Dragon Smithing perks will find advanced glass in the Glass category at the Forge; they require the same materials as glass, and can be improved on the workbench just like glass.\r\n\r\nThe \\\"Plus\\\" version requires additional materials to smith (dragon scales and iron for armor, dragon bones for weapons), and to temper (dragon scales for armor, and dragon bones for weapons).\r\n\r\nTo-do:\r\n * [Maybe] Include custom meshes and textures (if there\\'s enough interest, and I can find a willing contributor -- I\\'m a code, I\\'m no 3D artist, a simple recoloring is pushing my skills!), or alternatively release a version that points to different meshes and textures so that users can install their choice.",
