  "descriptionHtml": "Tired of trying to sack a town only to find some random essential guardian protects it? Tired of trying to destroy an enemy faction camp only to find an immortal field commander? Don&#39;t want to remove the protection that Essential NPCs were supposed to add?\r<br />\r<br />This mod replaces the &#34;Essential&#34; tag on NPCs with the &#34;Protected&#34; tag, making the normally immortal NPCs killable but by YOU only, maintaining the protection on the vanilla game while still allowing for a more fully immersive experience. This doesn&#39;t work for a few NPCs that didn&#39;t have the essential tag to begin with but are still essential such as &#34;Aela The Huntress&#34; or certain NPCs that I couldn&#39;t edit, a complete list of NPCs I couldn&#39;t edit can be found in the ReadMe. If I missed any NPCs please let me know, I will try my hardest to fix them and if I can&#39;t I will update the ReadMe with their names.\r<br />\r<br />Incompatibilities-\r<br />None that I know of, Leave a comment if you find one.",
