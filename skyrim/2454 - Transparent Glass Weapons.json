  "descriptionHtml": "I tried some other mods that was supposed to make the glass stuff more realistic. I didn\\'t like them so I created this. \r\n\r\nIncluded is the glass:\r\nbattle-axe\r\ndagger\r\ngreat-sword\r\nmace\r\nsword\r\nsword-chillrend\r\nwar-axe\r\nwar-hammer\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war-axe is a little bright, unfortunately I couldn\\'t find the texture for it to fix it. If somebody does find out where it is let me know and I\\'ll fix it. BTW, don\\'t ask me to do the shield, armor or arrows unless the meshes are fixed. Right now they only are one mesh for each piece and they have no glass components and I don\\'t want to spend the time to fix them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to include this in compilation mods.\r\n",
