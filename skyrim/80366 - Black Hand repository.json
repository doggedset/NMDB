  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]If you are like myself, you were a bit disappointed by the Dark Brotherhoods new &#34;feel&#34;. They have essentially abandoned the Five tenets and the Black hand are no more. This Mod intends to bring them back.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />For now, there is a Player home known as the Black Hand Repository. I&#39;ve tried to keep this player home fairly minimalist rather than filling it with game breaking amounts of stuff. There are a couple of items of loot which I based on the Original Black hand which will add a bit more of a professional assassin feel, rather than rogue brawler. \r<br />\r<br />This mod will develop over the next few weeks but is fully playable now and I would appreciate feedback on any bugs which might surface. \r<br />\r<br />Future plans:\r<br />\r<br />Black Hand faction Including NPC&#39;s\r<br />Custom meshes (all meshes are currently native content)\r<br />Better enchantments for custom items.",
