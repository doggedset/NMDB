This mod will replace the amount of blood coming from the melee attacks of the playable races with the same amount that is seen in a Werewolf attack.\n<br />The small amount of blood that was common in these playable races can still be seen during an unarmed fight.\n<br />[color=#ffff00]\n<br />[/color][color=#ffff00]Compatibility\n<br />[/color]\n<br />With any other mod and DLC, since it does not contain ESP.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/center]",
