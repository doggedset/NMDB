  "modName": "Philter of the Phantom Recipe",
  "summary": "The Philterof the Phantom is now craftable and serves a purpose! People will fear you while the potion lasts and you can craft it at a cooking pot!",
  "descriptionHtml": "If you were like me your were pissed that there were only around 2 philter of the phantom potions in the entire game and that the potion didnt really do anything except make you look like a ghost. Well I have made Philter of the Phantom Craftable!\r\n\r\nUse:\r\nTo make them you need to look at and take the Philter of the phantom recipe atleast once in shroud hearth borrow then go to a cooking pot and make it with or without the recipe. You need one of each of the following; glow dust, ectoplasm, void salts, and a bone meal. I also made the potion scare people when you use the potion.\r\n\r\nPossible updates: \r\n1. Make the player have to use a alchemy table to make the potion (Im going to need help though, I tried and failed).\r\n2. A quest with a backstory and alot of other stuff for the Philter of the Phantom.\r\n\r\nUpadates:\r\n1.2: Now the Philter of the phantom potion scares people up to level 30 away for 30 seconds and makes people angry for 30 seconds!\r\n1.4: New quest so you can sell Philter of the Phantom to the mysterious boy in Shroud hearth borrow! He is located where you follow and kill wyndelius. \r\n1.4.3: Now you only have to look at and take the recipe once, then you cant make it with or without the recipe.\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\n1. Q: When i go near or in shroud hearth borrow, skyrim crashes.\r\nA. Check your mods and see if you have any mods that affect shroud hearth borrow or philter of the phantom. If you do, they are probally conflicting with this mod, delete or uncheck those mods.\r\n\r\n2. Q: When i go to cooking pot, i cant make Philter of the Phantom.\r\nA. First make sure you have picked up the Philter of the Phantom recipe before. If you did and it still doesnt show the potion go to the answer for question 1.\r\n\r\n3. Q: There\\'s no audio for the Mysterious boy.\r\nA: That could fall with the conflicting mod part, but most likely not. This glitch will probally never happen but if it does its just a rare glitch, It wil probally fix itself. Just leave shroud hearth and come back. I know theres no audio for the second dialouge for if you dont have the potion, I will fix it next update.\r\n\r\nAlso Available on steam workshop: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=78824110\r\n\r\nKnow bugs: \r\n1. Some people might not be scared away, not because there higher than level 30, but because its just a glitch. I will try to fix it.\r\n2. Might not be able to talk to the mysterious boy. This can be fixed by either leaving shroud hearth and coming back, or quicksaving than loading the quicksave .\r\n3. No audio for the second time saying you dont have the philter of the phantom to the mysterious boy.\r\n\r\nHELP WANTED:\r\nI need to know how to make new recipes for alchemy tables, so you can make this from a alchemy table instead of a cooking pot. I am not much of a quest maker, so any help with making quests will be nice, PM me so we can work on it. Thank you for your help! Also if you have any ideas that could improve this mod then by all means tell me!",
