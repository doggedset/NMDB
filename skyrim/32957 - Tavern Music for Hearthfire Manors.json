  "descriptionHtml": "Changes the music of the Hearthfire manors (main floor(s), not cellar) to tavern music.  Just a very small mod I did for myself and figured I\\'d put it up here for anyone who wants their manor music changed but doesn\\'t have the creation kit or doesn\\'t want to bother editing it. This mod changes nothing other than the music played in the manors. If your manors are already built, make sure your most recent save the first time you load the mod is saved with your character outside your manor, or else you will have to exit and then re-enter for the music to be changed.  To state the obvious, this mod requires that you have the Hearthfire DLC.  ",
