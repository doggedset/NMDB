  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=4][b][u]DrNewcenstein&#39;s Elks Lodge for Skyrim[/u][/b][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />REQUIRES DRAGONBORN (sorry for not mentioning that earlier).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I realized what was missing from Skyrim: a Moose Lodge&#33; Last bastion of Freemasons rejects, these hallowed halls are where &#34;Boy&#39;s Night Out&#34; originated; a place where men could gather and drink and watch dancing girls dance on tables and get away from their oppressive housewives and demanding family. A place where Men could be Pigs.\r<br />\r<br />But, since there are no Moose in Skyrim, I couldn&#39;t very well do a Moose Lodge.\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s also no Water Buffalo, so I couldn&#39;t go Fred Flintstone, either.\r<br />\r<br />But there are Elk, and while the Elks are a slightly more respectible bunch than your average Moose Lodger, they still throw down, but without worrying about the whole &#34;Shriner&#34; thing.\r<br />\r<br />This is not a player home, so I don&#39;t suggest storing anything you want to keep.\r<br />\r<br />The Lodge is located outside Dawnstar, just past and across from Windward Ruins.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy, and try not to take it too seriously.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Unzip and drop the contents into your Skyrim folder. Everything should go into place (Data/meshes/etc).",
