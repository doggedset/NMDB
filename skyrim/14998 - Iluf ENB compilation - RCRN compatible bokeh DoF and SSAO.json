  "modName": "Iluf ENB compilation - RCRN compatible bokeh DoF and SSAO",
  "summary": "An ENB config for all the users of RCRN who don\\'t want to fiddle with all features most custom ENB configs have to offer. You get a subtle bokeh DoF which actually looks good in game and is not only usable for screenshots, performance SSAO enabled by defualt, and a bit of sharpening.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=red]The settings have been updated to support Skyrim 1.5 with ENB 0.111 and RCRN 3.0. I am currently taking an extended break from Skyrim and cannot test and tweak the config extensively as I should, so please don\\'t be angry if something doesn\\'t match.[/color][/b]\r\n\r\n[b]IMPORTANT: this configuration was made specifically to work in combination with Realistic Colors and Real Nights - Pure preset. I strongly recommend using RCRN Pure for the best gaming experience.[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]1. Introduction[/b]\r\nThis \\\"compilation\\\" is a result of my work on getting RCRN to work correctly with ENB without any of the aberrations such as: picture darkening, non-existing sun corona, changed color palette et cetera.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]2. Description[/b]\r\nIt offers a subtle bokeh depth of field effect (that is, you won\\'t be running around half-blind with anything 10 meters away from your character being blurred), performance SSAO (tweaked to avoid excessive darkening of distant objects such as LoD trees in the background), and a subtle sharpening effect.\r\n\r\nThe color correction part of ENB is tweaked to achieve similarity to the original colors offered by RCRN Pure (the picture might be a bit brighter or darker in some scenes especially when staring at the sky but the general look and feel is very much the same).\r\n\r\nI\\'ve disabled certain features of ENB, such as bloom, adaptation or chromatic aberration, to suit my own tastes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]3. The compilation[/b]\r\nI call this config a \\\"compilation\\\" and not a standalone setting because it\\'s based on MarMScA\\'s preset (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13391) and Matso\\'s bokeh DoF setting (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5587). All I have done was tweak the settings to enable SSAO, change the DoF effect for my liking (it\\'s more subtle than Matso\\'s) and remove any possible visual bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]4. Pros and cons[/b]\r\nPeople are probably asking themselves, \\\"why use this and not Dynavision\\\".\r\nThe answer is easy: \r\n1. Dynavision is *not* bokeh, and never will be, this has been stated by its authors. The game engine itself doesn\\'t provide bokeh DoF, and Dynavision works with the game engine to provide a visible dynamic DoF effect.\r\n2. Dynavision works with scripts and as such can cause conflicts with certain other mods and/or cause save bloat or corruption. This is sadly due to how Skyrim handles its scripts and can probably only be fixed by Bethesda.\r\n\r\nENB is a standalone piece of software that is injected into the game process, it doesn\\'t affect the in-game scripts in any way and is not subject to the limitations of the original game\\'s engine.\r\nHowever, we have to pay for this in the raw currency that is FPS (frames per second).\r\nUsing this compilation together with RCRN, you\\'re going to lose about 20 FPS, subject to vary depending on your system. Personally I\\'m running it on a i5-750/8GB RAM/1GB ATI5870 and getting ~25 FPS in Warzones (cue Warzones - Civil unrest mod), 30-40 FPS during outdoor exploration and 50-60 FPS when indoors.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]5. Installation[/b]\r\n1. If you\\'re running the game with RCRN, manually rename the d3d9.dll file it uses to rcrn_d3d9.dll.\r\n2. Get ENB\\'s d3d9.dll at http://enbdev.com/\r\n3. Open your skyrimprefs.ini and change \\\"bFloatPointRenderTarget=0\\\" to \\\"bFloatPointRenderTarget=1\\\". SSAO won\\'t work without this tweak.\r\n4. Paste the files from my compilation\\'s archive to your Skyrim folder.\r\n5. Run the game, enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]6. Uninstallation[/b]\r\nDelete the d3d9.dll file from your Skyrim folder. If you\\'re going to continue using RCRN, don\\'t forget to rename rcrn_d3d9.dll back into d3d9.dll or it will not work.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Known bugs/issues[/b]\r\n- Water transparency: this is an issue of the original ENB. Deal with it.\r\n- \\\"This doesn\\'t look at all like my RCRN setting!\\\": Upload a screenshot with some info, I\\'ll see if I can tweak it for better likeness. Remember, this is a work in progress. Or better yet, you can try tweaking enbseries.ini yourself.\r\n- The sky looks too bright, or the colors don\\'t match RCRN at all: make sure there\\'s no leftover files from your previous ENB settings. The only four ENB-related files in your Skyrim directory should be: d3d9.dll, enbseries.ini, enbeffect.fx, enbeffectprepass.fx.\r\n\r\n[b]9. Future Updates[/b]\r\nConsider this a work in progress, meaning, I will tweak my settings whenever I encounter an unrealistic-looking scene. Other than that, feel free to submit your feedback in the comments section and I might get to changing things accordingly.\r\nPlease note, however, that this was made for my personal use first and foremost and I just like to share, so don\\'t expect any drastic changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]10.
