Seemed to be a bit of a problem, so I decided to break my Mod cherry and whip this thing up.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Damage Values of arrows (no bolts included, they&#39;re O.P. already) have been modified to reflect the rarity of the item as well as the lore (Why would Forsworn fire arrows that are shittier than Iron?) using a multiplicative algorithm - All arrows have improved damage over Vanilla Skyrim and SkyRe but each arrow group has it&#39;s own damage scale. \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;",
