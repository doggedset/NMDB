  "descriptionHtml": "I usually like to play the dastardly type; rouges, assassins, necromancers, nightblades…you get the picture.\r\nBut every once in awhile I like to play something else, and after beign inspired by some Superman pictures I decided to create a paladin character, someone who would be a standard of virtue to look up to for the people of Skyrim, and who might actually look the part. Believe me it is usually easier for me to come up with shady characters or beautiful women so this proved quite a challenge. He is right after the cart ride and ready to face the executioner…so go have some fun\r\nI forgot to uncheck an esp during his creation, but other than that it is purely vanilla with Younger Males textures by Genox",
