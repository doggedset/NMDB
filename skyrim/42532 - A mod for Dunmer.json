  "descriptionHtml": "Dragonborn DLC is required for this mod.\r\n\r\nSkyrim is a great game, but still there are some small things which I don´t like, especially when it comes to Dunmer. That´s why I made this mod for my upcoming Dunmer gameplay and wanted to share it with the community. \r\n\r\nWHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?\r\n\r\nIrileth is one of the toughest Dunmer in Skyrim. I hate to see her in Leather armor. She deserves Ebony.\r\n\r\nThe Raven Rock mine might be shut down for a long time now but hey these are Redoran Guards of House Redoran, one of the most powerful houses from Morrowind. They would never carry High Elven weapons. Redoran Guards use Ebony weapons now.\r\n\r\nAn orc in Raven Rock bullying and harassing merchants just right next to a Redoran Guard? Come on! That´s just too much. Good news is you can kill him and his thug now and nobody would give a damn about it.\r\n\r\nThat racist Rolff in Windhelm is not essential anymore. He deserves too die whatever race you play!\r\n\r\nBoethiah Cultists are all Dunmer now! \r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALL & UNINSTALL\r\n\r\nUse the nexus mod manager to download and install/ uninstall.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to manually download it, just drag the file into your data folder.\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY ISSUES\r\n\r\nNone so far. If you encouner any let me know. \r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\nIf you think you have a good idea how to improve this mod please leave a comment.\r\n\r\nThanks for Bethedsa for such a great game.",
