  "descriptionHtml": "This is alittle different than most FPS Optimizations. This file will give you an fps boost of (depending what your running) 10+ fps with little to no difference in how the game looks. I myself have gone from 23-26- to 35-60. (Before, even inside, I could never cap out to 60:)\r\n\r\n I have also went through the liberty in fixing some bugs that normal FPS optimizations will give you:)\r\nHere are some bugs reportedly fixed.\r\n\r\nEsbern will not talk to you or/open the door for you.\r\nArrows dont shoot far.\r\nShadows going crazy.\r\nAnd CTD\\'s,\r\n\r\n\r\nCool right? Also, here is what my system is running.\r\n\r\nDual Core, 4gigs of RAM, 2.4ghs, and I am running a GEFORCE 320M graphics card. Not the best one but hey. Its what I got.\r\n\r\nENJOY!",
