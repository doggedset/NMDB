  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a follower meant to look like Mads Mikkelsen in his role of One-Eye in the movie Valhalla Rising. The Follower is 100% Mute just as he is in the movie. Find him in the sleeping giant inn in riverwood.\r<br />\r<br />This is a follower that will be in an upcoming mod of mine based around bandits/slavers/slaves (he is a slave in the movie). So enjoy it, and hopefully the full bandit mod will be released within a few days.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: Updated Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />FranklinZunge for the armor - Colovian Leather Armor\r<br />Misanthropia for his axe - Viking Weaponry\r<br />Northborn for his scars - Northborn Scars\r<br />\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />PM me if you want to use him, depending on your desired use I may or may not let you.",
