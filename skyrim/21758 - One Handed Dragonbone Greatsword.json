  "descriptionHtml": "Update 12/02/2013\r\nAdded a sheath to Dragonbone Daggers. Replacer.\r\n\r\nUpdate 14/09/2012\r\nDragonbone Greatsword sheath added. Adds a sheath to ALL Greatswords. Replacer.\r\n\r\nUpdate 16/08/2012\r\nShortsword speed and damage adjusted.\r\n\r\nUpdate 10/08/2012\r\nShortsword version added! Craft at a forge, upgrade at a grindstone.\r\n\r\nUpdate 06/08/2012\r\nReplacer version added. Extract to your Skyrim\\\\Data folder (see below) and you\\'re good to go!\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nAs soon as I saw the Dragonbone Greatsword, I thought: \\\\\\\"when Dawnguard gets released for the PC, I\\\\\\'m gonna try and mod this to be a one handed sword.\\\\\\\" I don\\\\\\'t think it\\\\\\'s perfect, but it\\\\\\'s as close as I can get to something that satisfies me; I wasn\\\\\\'t planning on releasing this but I thought maybe others felt the same. So here you go. This mod DOESN\\\\\\'T replace all one handed Dragonbone swords with the two handed version.\r\n\r\nThe model is scaled down about 20% to look a little more like a one handed blade. It can only be obtained through crafting at a forge (1 dragon bone, 1 ebony ingot, 1 leather strip); this is to prevent conflicts as my game isn\\\\\\'t in english.\r\nAlso, it is possible to upgrade it at a grindstone, using a dragon bone.\r\nStats wise, the sword is a little better than a regular one handed Dragonbone sword, but not as good as the two handed version.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nTo install, simply extract the archive to your Skyrim\\\\\\\\Data folder, usually located in C:\\\\\\\\Program Files [(x86)]\\\\\\\\Steam\\\\\\\\SteamApps\\\\\\\\common\\\\\\\\Skyrim\\\\\\\\Data\r\nAnswer yes to all if prompted; it won\\\\\\'t overwrite anything.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nSkyrim (latest version);\r\nDawnguard DLC\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nNone that I am aware of. Please report any in the comments section; I don\\\\\\'t plan on updating this mod as I think it is pretty much final, but I will try and fix any issue that may arise.\r\n\r\nPERMISSIONS\r\n\r\nFeel free to do whatever you want with this mod.",
