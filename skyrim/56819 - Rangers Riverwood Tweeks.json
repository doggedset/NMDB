  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][u][b]The Basic&#39;s[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Hi all\r<br />\r<br />This is my 1st mod, so please go gently on me&#33; lol.\r<br />\r<br />There are so many wonderful mod&#39;s out there, and many make-overs for dear little Riverwood. However, for one reason or another, I have never been totally comfortable with them. Each persons view is a little different after all.\r<br />\r<br />What I&#39;ve wanted, since the begnning, is to be able to have a starter home in Riverwood that looked like its always been there. Nothing over the top, no vast crafting area&#39;s, just a simple & cozy home.\r<br />\r<br />And so this came about.\r<br />\r<br />Now, it&#39;s take a great deal for me to be able to make this as I have sever depression, and more still to try and offer it up ... for that you may thank ( or possibly curse) my two sons&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]What You Get[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />A smalter by Alvor&#39;s work area\r<br />A shrine on the dead-end dock\r<br />A fully functional home\r<br />Something Hidden&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]The Details[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />A smelter. Why did poor ol&#39; Alvor not have a smelter? I mean, theres a mine up the road ( ok, so it has a few problems now) but are you telling me he has to go to Whiterun to smelt his ore? \r<br />\r<br />The Shrine. A small shrine to Zenithar on the otherwise usless dead-end dock for the hard working folk of Riverwood.\r<br />\r<br />A home. A simple, in-fitting home in Riverwood that you may purchase very early on. This is fully Nav-meshed and follower compatable. You will also get the &#39;joy&#39; of having random dragons sitting on it to kill the good folk of the village.\r<br />\r<br />Something Hidden. About this I shall say little, other than a true son or daughter of Skyrim should find it with ease.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][u]How To Use[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Download and install with NMM.\r<br />To purchase the house, simply click/activate the &#39;for sale&#39; sign.\r<br />[size=4][u][b]\r<br />Does this clash with.....[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Probably most things that alter Riverwood in the area&#39;s ive used... Those being By Alvors smithy, the dead end dock and behind the Inn ... Try it out and see what does and does not work for you.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Recomended[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br /> I use this home for many, many levels, thanks especially now to Jaxonz positioner here on the nexus, check it out guys.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Thanks[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36756/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D36756&pUp=1.]Thank&#39;s very much to Berticuss0001ï»¿ for his resources&#39;s & tutorials\r<br />[/url]",
