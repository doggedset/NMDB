  "descriptionHtml": "Never thought why such a powerful ancient relic is so useless on practice? I mean it&#39;s a game series named &#34;Elders Scrolls&#34;, but not a single game from the series gives you the opportunity to actually use those mysterious artifacts. Even Serana wears one, but for some reason you can&#39;t. But not with this mod&#33;\r<br />Give some practical use to your Elder Scrolls. Wear them&#33; Enjoy their new cool look and beneficial magical bonuses.\r<br />Wear one by yourself, give other two to your followers&#33; Get bored from them? Sell them&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Changes to the vanilla scrolls (book items):\r<br />1. Weight is set to 5 instead of 20.\r<br />2. No longer a &#34;quest items&#34;, thus they actually have weight.\r<br />3. Price is set to 6000 for each scroll.\r<br />4. Texture was enhanced and made 3 different gems colors for each of the 3 scrolls.\r<br />5. After you&#39;ll use your scrolls in crafting wearable versions they will no longer be a quest items even if this mod will be uninstalled. This is a side effect, but I see nothing harmful in this.\r<br />\r<br />Q: How to use this?\r<br />A: Go to the tanning rack and attach a strap to your scroll. All you need is a leather straps and an Elder Scroll or course. If you are using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163]Frostfall[/url] then you can do that in any place you like with a help of portable tanning rack.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Great&#33; I&#39;ve used my Elder Scroll to craft wearable one and now I can&#39;t proceed by quest. Thanks a lot, pal&#33;\r<br />A: Not a problem I say&#33; Go to the tanning rack and cut off the strap. Get your quest item back. Attack strap back, if you wish, after your quest is done.\r<br />\r<br />Q: After my death and reload of last savegame my scroll is floating in the air or just not appear on me. What should I do?\r<br />A: Just re-equip it or reload your savegame clearly (exit to the main menu 1st). This is in-game glitch. I can do nothing about that until I&#39;ll remade scroll model.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I can&#39;t attach a strap to my scroll. It&#39;s complaining about the luck of components. What should I do?\r<br />A: Report to me with the name of the scroll (Dragon, Blood or Sun). And note if you donated the scroll to Urag gro-Shub during your gameplay.\r<br />\r<br />Q: This is mod is so cool&#33; I like it&#33;\r<br />A: Endorse it then&#33; ;)\r<br />\r<br />Q: This is BS&#33; Not going to use this&#33;\r<br />A: Well... do not use it then.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Update Notice:[/color]\r<br />If you are updating for previous version please do next:\r<br />1. detach strap from scroll(s)\r<br />2. save\r<br />3. update mod\r<br />4. re-attach strap to scroll(s)\r<br />[color=red]Failing to do that may result in loosing your scroll(s)&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]REQUIREMENTS: Dawnguard DLC.
