  "summary": "Several small camps spread out across Skyrim that can be used as player homes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The wanderers of Skyrim cannot always afford an inn for the night. Even when they can, there are certain utilities that the average pub won\\'t provide. As a result, small camps have been set up in every town and city.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a rest stop in every town. Each rest stop is slightly different, but they all include a bed, a cooking pot, and permanent storage. A few of the camps are occupied, however, the residents will not give you any trouble. Any items stored in nearby containers owned by the player will be permanent and not disappear, making all of these camps effectively player homes.\r\n\r\nStandard disclaimer: I am not responsible for your screw-ups. Back up your saves and pray for stable CHIM, because your problems are not mine. I am not aware of any incompatibilities, but I will be sure to update if any are found.",
