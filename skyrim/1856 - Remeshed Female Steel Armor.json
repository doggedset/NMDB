  "descriptionHtml": "Ok, I\\'ve redone the light version from scratch and updated the mod as v3. I tested the mod for about 2 hours on my usual high settings without any crashes whatsoever. However, I was also using the 4G mod to help with the other random memory crashes that the game has. Hope this finally fixes this really annoying problem.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHey guys\r\nThanks for all the feedback. As everyone has pretty much figured out by now, the shoulderless version (light) crashes the game frequently whereas the shouldered version doesn\\'t. I\\'m pretty much as clueless as everyone else on the reason why (seeing I made them all identically) so if you download this, please only place the shouldered version in. When my internet speed resets for the month and I fix steam issues of being ...well just steam, I\\'ll remake the shoulderless version from scratch and try it out. \r\nWill keep you posted on what happens.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLatest version is up. This version contains the remesh for both versions of the steel armor (due to requests) as well as versions for the light and heavy body types (_0 and _1 respectively). Also thanks to red123456 for providing me with the bug fix for the male armor. The female meshes now map directly to textures/armor/steel/f for the new female textures instead of mapping to the same directory as the male textures.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\nRemove all previous versions of this mod (particularly the texture files in textures/armor/steel/m as they will still affect the male body [unless you installed the updated meshes I posted earlier but is easier to just remove the texture]) and extract the new files into your Skyrim archive.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFirst mod guys, glad to get on board with everyone.\r\n\r\nThis is a remesh and retexture (alpha channels only) of the female light version (the one without shoulder pads) of the steel armor.\r\n\r\nI made this armor while trying to figure out how to use nifskope and alpha channels in photoshop. I originally got the idea for this from zuluknob\\'s dragon boner mod who also gave me some pointers on importing other meshes into an existing mesh.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is wondering about the extra pocket on the back left, I had to insert it from the iron armor set and move it into that position as the female body mesh (taken from Thepal\\'s Nude Females mod) clipped through the armor mesh in that position.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have only done the small female body ( _0 meshes) as the larger one produced a lot more clipping.\r\n\r\nTo install, place exacted data folder in you skyrim folder and merge with the existing one.\r\n\r\nAgain as it is my first mod, if I have done anything wrong in regards to the uploading let me know.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nBethesda for the amazing game and meshes and textures.\r\nThepal for his/her work on the female body meshes and textures.\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\nUse this to your hearts content. Change it however you want. But if you reupload it please just mention me and particularly Thepal.\r\n",
