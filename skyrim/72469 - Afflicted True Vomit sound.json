  "descriptionHtml": "This is a replacer mod for the sound of one attack of the Afflicted npcs of the quest names The only Cure.\r<br />I made this replacer mod because I dont liked the sound what comes with the attack of vanilla vomit, I meant the vomit doesnt sound like that.\r<br />Also I have to say I have made this mod because I really enjoy a mod names, Creepy Zombies by futoshisan, it adds some really zombies to the game, and the zombies uses the effect sound of the Afflicted\r<br />\r<br />I have to say I had to go to The Creation kit to find where the file it was, because just searching something related on the Skyrim folder path doesnt work\r<br />In the video you can listen it (the last part &#34;spit&#34; I cut it)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />You have two version:\r<br />\r<br />1.0: Sounds like a human throwing up\r<br />1.1: Sounds like a zombie throwing up\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Manually\r<br />Just drop the files on your Skyrim folder and replace them If its needed.\r<br />\r<br />Using NMM\r<br />Just activate the mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I have noticed the sound of the vanilla impact vomit attack doesn&#39;t sounds like something liquid, sounds like &#34;shch, shch, shch&#34; (I think doesnt fit), I cant find the file of that sound, If you know where it is, please tell me to make a replacer sound and have the full version of &#34;zombies vomit attack&#34;. I have search on creation kit, and it seems the file would be have something in common with chaurus or poison.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]In next update:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Note: I already created a version what replaces just afflicted NPCs vomit sound in a standalone way and let the ice sound FX to sound has it have to be. But, the reason I created this mod was just to work with Creepy Zombies mod, I already created the standalone version, but I noticed Creepy Zombies mod had an update recently... so I need to redone the stand alone version to upload it, this version of the mod modifies the Creepy Zombies.esp file. Also I&#39;m going to create an optional version stand alone just for afflicted NPCs vanilla, not a replacer version, so this way ice sound FX file will be not replaced with vomit sound, to do that I will have to create a .esp file.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------by Maredark3d (Medieval)---------------------------------------------------------------------------",
