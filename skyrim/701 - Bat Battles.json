  "descriptionHtml": "Will NOT update - A fellow Nexus member has created a superior version with all the updates I suggested.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Sometime the AI becomes unresponsive.\r\nANOTHER NOTE: My computer sucks but I am still able to run this with some lag. This is a great mod for the Imperial and Stormcloak main quest where you take over forts :).\r\n\r\nOpen the console with ~ make sure you place the files in your skyrim program files section/\r\nType- \\\"Bat SC\\\" - Summons Storm cloak enemies\r\nType- \\\"Bat I\\\" - Summons Imperial allies\r\nType- \\\"Bat Bandit\\\" Summon Bandit enemies\r\n\r\nThe entire purpose of this is for huge battles, and you can always change your getstate to determine what side you want to be on.\r\n\r\nA little tutorial for people wanting to find ID\\'s even though a lot of people knew how to do this since morrowind. Simply type something like \\\"help Bandit 4\\\" then go all the way to the top where you see the digit codes that start to begin with 000 write all of them down or some of them down. The command is player.placeatme (you dont actually need the zeros) you could just write 5f167 (player.placeatme 5f167) or whatever it is to spawn that unit. Placing a space and then a number like 20 will spawn 20 of them.",
