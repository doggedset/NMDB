  "descriptionHtml": "[b]7/11/2016 wow, I can&#39;t believe this was over 2 years ago.  This was my first mod&#33;  Lots has changed since then.  I&#39;m revisiting all of my Skyrim stuff over the summer for the upcoming Skyrim Special Edition re-release, so stay tuned for some updates and improvements to this.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/47G7pD3.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Completely new textures for the wonderful Masser & Secunda moons, in glorious 4K, 2K, and 1K resolutions, designed to retain the look and feel of the original vanilla creations.  I love looking closely at things and taking in the detail of the natural Skyrim environment, and adore the night sky, so I decided to give them the quality update they deserve.\r<br />\r<br />The Official Hi-Res DLC did not improve these, so vanilla uses 512 textures.  Mine are a whopping 8x larger at 4096.  Now you can drop your FOV all the way down to 5 (yes, five&#33;) and visually explore the entire surface of both moons&#33;  Mine are a bit less &#34;craggy&#34; than vanilla, but they are very faithful.\r<br />\r<br />For those curious, the moons in Skyrim are not 3D objects with a wrapped texture and lighting, but flat static images, so each of the phases for each moon were created separately (14 in all -- which is why I don&#39;t think there are many moon retextures&#33;)  You may also recognize parts of Mars and Enceladus, which the original textures utilized as well.  Thanks to NASA for their insanely high resolution photography as a terrain source&#33;\r<br />\r<br />BE WARNED: The 4K textures are huge, weighing in at 22MB each, but it is insane how far you can zoom in on them&#33;  The 2k versions still look just as good in normal gameplay but are only 5MB each.  \r<br />\r<br />Stay tuned for the upcoming companion(s) to this mod under the Skygazer series, which will feature 4K stars, constellations, nebulas, and auroras, making it a total Skyrim astronomy texture upgrade.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;SkySight&#34; & &#34;SkyGazer&#34; are my series of vanilla-true HD re-textures.  I am a bit obsessive about retaining as accurate to vanilla detail as possible.  Stay tuned, many more objects in the works&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please let me know if you experience any issues, or have any questions&#33;\r<br />\r<br />FUTURE PLANS\r<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \r<br />- Glowing option\r<br />- More saturated color option\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY & TESTING\r<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \r<br />This is a simple texture replacement, so it will only conflict with other moon texture mods.
