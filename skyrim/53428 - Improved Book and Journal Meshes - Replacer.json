  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/QtD7v94.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Hello&#33; This is something I&#39;ve been wanting to make for a long time but had been avoiding, until I finally got crackin&#39; so here we are. \r<br />\r<br />This mod will replace most of the vanilla (not DLC) book and journal meshes and textures with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3204267/?]DanielCoffey[/url]&#39;s improved versions, which are featured in the mindblowingly amazing [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35399/?]Book Covers Skyrim[/url]. I did not replace the notes. I also did not change a couple of books, such as the Dragonborn one, the Master magic books, the Falmer Text books from Dawnguard, or the one used by The Aetherium Wars. I chose textures from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44267/?]Book Covers PSD - Modders Resource[/url] that would look close enough to the vanilla books so the changes wouldn&#39;t be too drastic, but the final result looks still quite different. I like how everything turned out, so I&#39;m uploading the file in case someone else may want to use it as well.\r<br />\r<br />Why bother with this when you may have already installed Book Covers Skyrim? Well, I made these thinking of other mods that add new books (such as fan-written stories) or journals for NPCs, so they would benefit from the new look. Now all books will be pretty and optimized~ Choose the regular version or the desaturated one (-50 adjustment), or combine them to your liking. The screenshots show the regular version in my game, which has slightly boosted colors.\r<br />\r<br />This file will NOT overwrite any textures; they are in a new folder to avoid conflicts, so this means meshes and textures from Book Covers Skyrim will also not be overwritten. There is no replacement for paper included; the new meshes will use whatever paper textures you are using. The new textures are 1024x512 and have been optimized. If you don&#39;t like how these look, feel free to download [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44267/?]Book Covers PSD - Modders Resource[/url] and replace the ones you dislike. Please keep your complains to yourself otherwise, thank you~\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. That&#39;s it, no .esp required. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. \r<br />\r<br />The credits go to DanielCoffey&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35399/?]Book Covers Skyrim[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44267/?]Book Covers PSD - Modders Resource[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37113/?]Better Book Mesh - Modders Resource [/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42388/?]Better Journal Mesh - Modders Resource[/url] - all I did was choose some, rename them and make them point to the new textures so they could work as replacers. Thank you very much&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
