  "descriptionHtml": "Update: 5-20-13 \r\nIt has come to my attention that this home is not compatible with the newest build your home mod, Millwater Retreat. You will not be able to use both because they occupy the exact same spot. \r\n\r\nUpdate:  5-16-13\r\nOkay, I think I have a handle now on the disappearing smelter! I have uploaded the updated mesh, plus three others that I think could do the same thing. Simply download them and replace the old ones. I\\'ve tested them out in my game and everything seems to be fine but please, let know if there are any problems. Thanks goes out to Tamira for pointing out what was wrong and how to fix it. That woman is a godsend. \r\n\r\nUpdate: I was reminded this morning that Tamira included a demo esp of this cabin when she released it as a resource. I never did use it and I didn\\'t release that I was putting my cabin in the exact same spot as she did, so it looks like they will not be compatible at all. If you have Tamira\\'s cabin, you will not be able to use this one as well. \r\n\r\nThis mod adds a small, one room cabin to the northeastern shore of Lake Ilinalta. It is located just southwest of Anise\\'s cabin. It is suitable for one person only but it\\'s fully navmeshed inside so followers can come in with you. Since the place is very small and there is only one chair, I\\'ve made it so that you can sit on the end of the bed, just in case you have someone in there with you. \r\n\r\nFeatures Include:\r\nAll crafting stations - Some of them may not look like what you\\'re used to, but they are all there. I\\'ve changed most of them to go with the cabin since it\\'s very small and the normal stations would look very crowded in and around there. \r\nA respawning fish trap and respawning mudcrab that will give you chitin. They are the only containers in the mod that do respawn. \r\nA fishing pole that will give you a fish when you activate it\r\nThe lights outside from the lanterns come on at night and turn off in the morning\r\nSeveral weapon plaques and two racks.\r\nAmple, safe storage\r\n\r\nIt\\'s best to just load it up and check it out for yourself. If you like it, great, then I\\'ve done my job. :) \r\n\r\nFor those who like to spend some coin on a house, you can buy the deed from Riverwood Trader in Riverwood. The base price is 2000. The deed will tell you where to find the key. If you wish to bypass this, you can. You can simply look for the key. It\\'s very easy to find. \r\n\r\nIf you\\'d like to take virtual tour of Fisher\\'s Folly, you can, thanks to insaneOhflex (svaalbard) Check out his youtube channel for other great mod videos. :)\r\n\r\n[youtube]x2PAGbaolzs[/youtube]\r\n\r\nInstallation: \r\nDrag and drop the mod files into your Skyrim data folder. \r\n\r\nThis mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit and should contain no game breaking errors or anything else scary. \r\n\r\nPlease do not upload this mod to other sites without my permission. \r\n\r\nFisher\\'s Folly would not be nearly as nice without the hard work of the following people..\r\n\r\nStroti - the cabin itself, the outhouse, and various pieces of furniture. \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1657719/?\r\n\r\nInsanity Sorrow - Sundial, armour stand, fishing items, watering can, and the lovely lanterns. \r\nhttp://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/user/378-insanitysorrow/\r\n\r\nTamira - the static birds were converted by her from the original models by UMAR6419, she also converted Stroti\\'s models for Skyrim and pointed me to the cardinal chirping wav used in this mod. Hats off to that lady!\r\nhttp://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/user/4357-tamira/\r\n\r\nBlary - several clutter items like the bookshelf, potion bottles, etc. \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2250922/?\r\n\r\nRunspect - Clutter items \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1308288/?\r\n\r\nOaristys - Clutter items \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2235573/?\r\n\r\nLilith - Her Ready Clutter and Furnishings helped fill this place\r\nhttp://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/user/643-lilith/\r\n\r\nDarkRider - The beautiful painting and pewter dinnerware are his. \r\nhttp://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/user/3-darkrider/\r\n\r\nThe cardinal wav came from Soundbible.com\r\nhttp://soundbible.com/1515-Best-Cardinal-Bird.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that\\'s it. Please, let me know if I\\'ve missed anyone and also if you find anything wrong with this mod. ",
