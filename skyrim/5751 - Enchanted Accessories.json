  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]Note[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nFor those who made Fire Cloak equips, they will be changed to Poison Cloak. I did this since Fire Cloak doesn\\'t damage opponents. However, if you still want the Fire Cloak visual effects, you can still make them.\r\n\r\nOther than that, THANK YOU for the support and downloads! =)\r\n\r\n[spoiler]Since you can have 3 enchantments now, you\\'re literally invincible against wizards. Just equip the respective Resist, Ward, and Healing. Hah.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n[b][u]Change Log[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n1.3 - Circlets added. And some random enchantments.\r\n\r\n1.2 - Rings added. Added Grace Enchantment (EFury)\r\n\r\n1.1 - Fixed \\\"Invisibility\\\" spelling. Added 9 more Amulets. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]What is this?[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nEnchantments placed on accessories.  \r\nSome are for fun, such as Spectral. The accessory of Spectral makes you spectral permanently since you are essentially wearing an equipment. \r\nOthers are for more practical purposes. Candlelight, for example. If it\\'s too dark and you\\'re lazy to use your spell just equip an accessory of Candlelight. \r\nThere are some also for combating. Acessory of Muffle makes your movement silent.\r\n\r\n[b]This is in conjuction with my other mod - Ultimate Potions and Poisons. Most of the enchantments come from there.\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5067\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re not really savvy about accessories (maybe because you have an accessory for damage and you can\\'t live without it and you have to wear it 24/7), you might want to check that out too. =)[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]What kind of accessories are there?[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nSee-read me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]FAQ[/b][/u]\r\n[b][u]Where to make?[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nForge. Jewelry section (Either that or the MISC; but most probably Jewelry). 1 Leather strip, 1 Iron ingot, 1 Grand soul gem (empty or filled) to make 1 accessoriy. I think it\\'s pretty balanced since you\\'ll only need to make it once.\r\n\r\nRings are also made in the Jewelry section, and need the same things to craft. Too lazy to change~\r\n\r\n[b][u]How to install/uninstall?[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nInstall) Download EnchantedAccessories.esp and place it in your Data folder.\r\nUninstall) Remove EnchantedAccessories.esp from your Data folder.\r\n\r\n[b][u]When will you make more?[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nIf you have seen my UP&P Mod, I stated that school has started and I would be absent on weekdays. So I\\'ll probably update this mod on weekends.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn\\'t mean that I\\'m closed to suggestions. Please, comment and give your opinions. This is the best way that mods can become better. =) \r\n\r\n[b][u]Why are all the amulet images Amulet of Talos?[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nI figured changing the images would be confusing if I switched them here and there. Plus, it\\'s easier for me. And since Talos is one of the... \\\"debatable\\\" divines, I\\'d thought it\\'ll be nice. (If you get what I mean).\r\nSo yeah, if you hate Talos. Sorry. =(\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun!",
