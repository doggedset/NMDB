  "descriptionHtml": "[center][URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/24/nexustemplate2.gif/][IMG]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/1209/nexustemplate2.gif[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nMore Rain now comes with a FOMOD scripted installer!\r\n\r\nThis mod is similar to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8328] More Snow[/url], but it adds more Rain not More Snow :) This Mod was made with the creation kit and is comptible with every Rain Mod retexture too, so you can download any other rain Mod retextures from the Nexus to make the Rainnipples/drops even nicer. The Weather is various (as Vanilla), this mod affects the all Rain \\\"Stages\\\" that are used in Skyrim. Skyrim has nine \\\"rain stages\\\" but only 2 are used at this Time - \\\"Light Rain\\\" and \\\"Rainstorm\\\". The Mod comes with five different Versions:\r\n\r\n[b]MoreRain - Just More Rain :)\r\nMoreRainWindy - Adds More Rain and WindFX at Rainstorms\r\nMoreRainWindy33percentLessView - Adds More Rain and WindFX at Rainstorms and decreases view Distance by 33 percent (only when it rains for sure)\r\nMoreRainindy66percentLessView - Adds More Rain and WindFX at Rainstorms and decreases view Distance by 66 percent(only when it rains for sure)\r\nMoreRainHeavyandDarker - Adds More Rain, Wind, Fog and the view distance is decreased by 80 percent (only when it rains for sure)- really fun :) [/b]\r\nNote : Please use only one Version at the same time, you cant combine them!\r\n\r\nI also recommend [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8739]Enhanced Dynamic Weather System[/url] if you want more often Rain!\r\n\r\n(Ingame you will see the Effect much better then at the Screenshots)\r\n\r\n[b]Note: [/b]\r\n[i]If you´re using a Realistic Lightning Mod you have to set the correct load Order. At first load your prefered Lightning Mod, then -->MoreRain.esp or MoreSnow.esp (doesn´t Matter) . MoreRain and MoreSnow without extras are fully compatible to any Lightning mod, the Versions with extras such as Windy and WindywithLessView Versions wont work with all Lightning Mods, try out yourself :) \r\nIf you want to use EDWS it also doesn´t matter in wich Order you load the File. The important thing is to load every Lightning mod before MoreRain, MoreSnow or EDWS. [/i]\r\n\r\nKnown incompatible Lightning mods at this time :\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=648]DARKER NIGHTS v0_97a[/url] ->conflicts with Extra Versions such as MoreRainWindy/MoreSnowWindy. Use only MoreRain/MoreSnow and load after DarkerNights. EDWS is also compatible. \r\n\r\nHow to Install :\r\nSimply use the NexusModManager FOMOD installation , or pick a prefered Version, copy the File to your Skyrim Data Folder and activate it via the Launcher.\r\nTo Uninstall just untick the File in your Launcher and delete it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave Fun! If you like this Mod, please Endorse so others can see/use it too. [/center]\r\n\r\nFAQ :\r\n\r\n[b]Q: \\\"What the Heck? Rain and Snow falls trough Solid Objects\\\" [/b]\r\nA: There is nothing i can do about it at this time. This \\\"Bug\\\" would also appear without the Mod, but you would not notice so intense, because Vanilla Rain and Snow is much softer! \r\n\r\n[b]Q: \\\"My Background turns to white at Rainstorms, what can i do to fix it?[/b]\r\nA: This is a conflict with another Mod like Realistic Lightning, Dynamic Shadows, or any other\r\nVisual enhancement Mod. Check your load order and load EDWS after any those kind of Mods.\r\nCould also appear when using an ENB Profile.  \r\n\r\n[b]Q: \\\"During Rain or Snowstorms NPC´s are walking around as if it is the sunniest of days, can you fix it please?\\\"[/b]\r\nA: Without a clearly new scripted Weather System this is not possible and sadly i do not have the time to do it. Maybe we will get an Update for the Weather System in the future from Bethesda, so we do not have to create a whole new scripted weather system. \r\n\r\n[b]Q: \\\"Sometimes it Rains or Snows for just a few seconds - Bug?\\\"[/b]\r\nA: This happend to me very very rare, but it has something to do in the way the Weather system works and in the next Updates i will try to fix it to best possible result. \r\n\r\n\r\n ",
