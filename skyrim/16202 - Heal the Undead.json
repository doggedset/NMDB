  "descriptionHtml": "Healing the Undead\r\n\r\nThis mod adds 3 new Speelbooks \\\"Healing the Undead\\\", \\\"Empower the Undead\\\" and \\\"Infect\\\" sold by a separate Merchant named Drelia located in the \\\"Sleeping Giant Inn\\\" in Riverwood. \r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this was to be able to heal undead minions. So you can play a conjuration/restoration (+ illusion if you like) magician without doing damage by yourself. The fact that you cannot heal your undead minions in Skyrim was very dissapointing to me. I wanted to use Retoration with Conjuration but i dont want to bring an additional follower into combat just to have someone i could heal while my minions die far to fast. Now you can play a passive or supporting magician w/o the need to do damage by yourself. Let your minions do the dirty work and keep them alive.\r\n\r\nIn the future i might be adding more support spells like a decrease armor/health, damage over time spells etc.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 03:\r\n\r\nadded Conjuration-Spell \\\"Empower the Undead\\\" which works like \\\"Courage\\\" but only with Undead. Can be purchased by Drelia or found in Bleak Falls Barrow.\r\n\r\nadded Restoration-Spell \\\"Infect\\\" which is a concentration based damage spell. Does not very much damage because i dont want to make Destruction obsolete. Its just intended to help killing things, when you only play conjuration and Restoration. Can be purchased by Drelia or found in White River Watch.\r\n\r\nchanged \\\"Healing the Undead\\\" so it now only heals Undead (for example a \\\"living\\\" wolf cant be healed with this spell, but a reanimated can be healed). Can be purchased by Drelia or found in Embershardmine.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 02:\r\n\r\nDrelia didnt show up anytime with any character as intended. So i have added a copy of this new spellbook in the embershardmine (german: Glutsplittermine). See screenshot for location.\r\n\r\nTO DO:\r\n- find a way to heal undead and damage living things with the same spell\r\n- add more supporting spells\r\n- maybe a related quest\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nJust extract the Heal_the_Undead.esp into your Data Folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO GET THESE NEW BOOKS:\r\n\r\nJust visit the new Merchant \\\"Drelia\\\" in the Sleeping Giants Inn in Riverwood. This Merchant already sells this new book and additionally Magicka-related Vanilla Stuff (nothing special). In the Future she will sell more new spells.\r\n\r\nIf she is not there, you will also find the books in the Embershardmine near Riverwood, Bleak Falls Barrow and White River Watch.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO BUGS FOUND SO FAR:\r\n\r\nI kept anything easy as possible. Should work with any other mods. If you encounter any problems, please let me now :)\r\n\r\n",
