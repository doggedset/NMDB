  "descriptionHtml": "During the construction of Whiterun defense walls, an ancient Nord Palace was discovered underneath the city. Throughout the years different Whiterun Jarls have cleanup and slowly rebuilt the Palace. Due to the existence of Dragonsreach there was never a use for the Nord Palace until the Dragonborn showed-up. As a show of gratitude for saving the city from the dragon, the Jarl and citizens of Whiterun have offered the Nord Palace to the Dovahkiin. The entrance is just outside the city main gate on the drawbridge wall, inside the little hideout.\r\nEasy to reach, fast travel to Whiterun stables and the Palace is just a few steps away.\r\nInside you will find:\r\n8 Urns for storage\r\n12 Chests\r\n38 Weapon plaques\r\n22 Mannequins\r\n1 Strongbox\r\n1 Large bed\r\n2 Small beds\r\nAll the crafting tolls\r\nA throne â€“ if you wish to look at the room while seating instead of looking at yourself I recommend \\\"Free Camera Movement on Jarl Thrones and others\\\" mod. \r\nThe Palace is companion friendly.\r\nTo install I recomend using the Nexus Mod Manager, if you install it mannually place the file in the Skyrim data folder.\r\n\r\nVersion 2\r\nCorrected some architectural imperfections, and added some items.\r\n\r\nVersion 3\r\nCorrected interference with The House of Horrors quest.\r\nFixed interior light as requested.\r\nMinor fixes.",
