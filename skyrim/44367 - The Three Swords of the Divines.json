  "summary": "Adds three swords, a helmet, a spell and three non-quest treasure hunts to the game!",
  "descriptionHtml": "REQUIRES DAWNGUARD! \r\nv1.1 Added more notes and two new swords (Drun Fo and Strunmah Qo) \r\nv1.2 Added a helmet, a spell and fixed errors.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod so be nice! \r\nThis mod adds the swords Dukaan Faas (Dishonor Fear), Drun Fo (Bring Frost), Strunmah Qo (Mountain Lightning) and the helmet Divines Smile. \r\n\r\nTo find the swords:First you have to find a note on the road to Riverwood, there will be a lightball over it. There will be a note there and there will be a non-quest treasure hunt which you have to figure out for yourself, it\\'s pretty easy, just remember to read. I have tried to be lore friendly but if i have done something wrong, just comment! the first line of clues (to keep it from being a game breaker, considered that they are easy to find) gives you different points in skills like one-handed for an example, so the swords wont be the only reward. If this mod gets a good response i will probably do this kind of mod again, just a more complex hunt! THESE WEAPONS ARE NOT OP! They has a bit more damage then the Blades sword and some average enchantments and tweaks. \r\nAny questions or ides? Just comment! And have fun playing my mod :) \r\nTIP: For a better looking sword, use SeeEnch (available here on the Nexus)",
