  "descriptionHtml": "[color=Blue][font=Impact][size=7]Cattle Herd by Fall Hammer[/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[URL=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50171/?]German Translation by Kingwulf here[/URL]\r<br />\r<br />Cattle Herd is a simple mod that adds several cows, a cattle herder named Harvey LeBeouf, and his two trusty herding dogs. There is also a tent and campfire to to keep Harvey dry and warm. \r<br />I created this mod as a compliment to:[URL=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/?]Alternate Start-Live Another Life by Arthmoor[/URL] and [URL=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50093/?]Dragon Bridge Manor an Adoption Friendly Home by pinkstarfish[/URL]\r<br />\r<br />As both those are within a cow paddy toss from where the herd is located, and make for a great roleplaying experience as with Live Another Life if you choose the Karnsdale Farm location, you can collect &#34;Farm Profits&#34; from the farmer, and live the life of Lord/Landowner in the Dragon Bridge Manor over looking both the herd and the farm. \r<br />\r<br />Another Mod that is compatible is\r<br />[URL=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25439/?]Bridge Farm by Gentester[/URL] If using with Dragon Bridge Manor load Bridge Farm last(fixes any landscape issues). \r<br />\r<br />Note: Bridge Farm is NOT compatible with Live Another Life, as LAL&#39;s Karnsdale Farmhouse, is in the same spot.\r<br />\r<br />For the ultimate Farming/Cow herding experience I would also suggest \r<br />[URL=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25239/?]Berts Hearthfire Dairy Goods Upgrade by Berticus0001[/URL] as this adds COW MILKING&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />So I hope you enjoy, and as usual this requires the latest version of Skyrim (no DLC required unless using mod that requires them)\r<br />\r<br />Fall Hammer \r<br />\r<br />Now also [URL=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=218825761]Cattle Herd on Steam Workshop[/URL]\r<br />\r<br />Update Info:\r<br />Version 1.0 Initial Upload\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1 Cleaned with TES5Edit Hmm smells fresh. \r<br />\r<br />Version 1.2 Small tweaks to make compatible with Bridge Farm, moved tent, fire, and 1 dog.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.3 Added FaceGenData textures and meshes to prevent &#34;Grey Face Bug&#34;",
