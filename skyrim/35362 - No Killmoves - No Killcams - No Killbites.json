It\\'s just there for the curious.) In addition to several hours of informal testing in normal gameplay, more rigorous tests were run to ensure the mod did its job reliably.\r\n\r\n[i]First test[/i]: On Master difficulty, I provoked an ancient dragon, waited for it to land, set Health to 1 via console, and waited to get killed by a bite.\r\n- Mod disabled: 8 of 20 bite-caused deaths involved killbites (i.e. bite-and-toss).\r\n- Mod enabled: 0 of 20 bite-caused deaths involved killbites.\r\n\r\n[i]Second test[/i]: On Master difficulty, I provoked a sword-and-shield fighter at close range, set my Health to 1 via console, and waited to get killed.\r\n- Mod disabled: 4 of 40 deaths involved killmoves.\r\n- Mod enabled: 0 of 40 deaths involved killmoves.\r\n\r\n[i]Third test[/i]: On Novice difficulty, I used a ranged sneak attack to kill a Forsworn Forager. \r\n- Mod disabled: 10 of 40 kills involved killcams.\r\n- Mod enabled: 0 of 40 kills involved killcams.\r\n\r\n[i]Fourth test[/i]: On Novice difficulty, I used a dualcast Thunderbolt to kill a Forsworn Forager.\r\n- Mod disabled: 14 of 40 kills involved killcams.\r\n- Mod enabled: 0 of 40 kills involved killcams.\r\n\r\n[i]Fifth test[/i]: On Novice difficulty, I used a two-handed Power Attack with Devastating Blow to kill the last enemy in an area, a Forsworn Looter.\r\n- Mod disabled: 8 of 20 kills involved decapitations, and 12 of 20 kills involved other killmoves.\r\n- Mod enabled: 0 of 20 kills involved decapitations, and 0 of 20 kills involved other killmoves.",
