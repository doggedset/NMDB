Or you can get it with the command.\r\n- the blade is the Nighingale Blade retext. So by finishing the theives guild you will get it. And it as now replaces the Akaviri Katana know as the Sword of the blades.\r\n- The Shield is a rare item that can be found in the game. i dont know where so use the command if you want it.\r\n\r\nfor the commands, open the console, then type ex:  player.additem 000aeb9 1   \r\n the 1 is for the quantity you want to add to your inventory.\r\n\r\n0003AEB9  AkaviriKatana \r\n000D3EA0  ArmorPenitusCuirass \r\n000D3EA7  ArmorPenitusBoots \r\n000D3EAB  ArmorPenitusGauntlets \r\n000E41D8  ArmorShieldofYsgramor \r\n0009610D ArmorImperialHelmetFull \r\n\r\n_install_\r\n\r\nPut the data folder in steam/steamapps/skyrim.\r\n\\\"warning\\\" it will replace the Akaviri Katana for a Celtic type of sword...\r\n\r\n_Uninstal_\r\n\r\nremove the files..\r\n\r\nHave Fun!",
