  "descriptionHtml": "Tired of going back and forth your browser and Skyrim just to find that very last stone of barenziah? Or maybe you just need to know how to make that cure disease potion without praying to some God?\r<br />\r<br />This mod is very simple, and it began as a necessity for me as through multiple playthroughs I just couldn&#39;t get into alchemy long enough to learn all the recipes by experimenting. Then I found certain quests rather tedious; stones of barenziah/crimson nirnroots, running around in circles for hours. So I just made a mod to help save time.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALL:\r<br />\r<br />Simply extract the zip file and put the .esp and .bsa file in your Skyrim/Data folder and enable it in your mod manager of choice\r<br />\r<br />UPGRADE:\r<br />\r<br />The same, simply overwrite with new version, no clean save required - very simple mod.\r<br />\r<br />USAGE:\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s just books, has NO scripts.\r<br />Thanks to Fallhammer you can now find these books at Belethor&#39;s general store or the Arcaneum.\r<br />\r<br />Alternatively, if you are paranoid about compatibility (like me&#33;), and wish to use the console; The name of the books are as follows:\r<br />&#34;Anarchist&#39;s Cookbook&#34; - 3 volumes of recipes (the first 2 potions, the last being poisons)\r<br />&#34;Blackreach&#39;s Roots&#34; - Crimson root locations\r<br />&#34;Stones of Barenziah&#34; - SOB locations\r<br />&#34;The Dragon&#39;s Tongue&#34; - Shout locations\r<br />&#34;Trainers of Skyrim&#34; - Non-guild trainer locations\r<br />&#34;Jius Opus Map&#34; - Map for Jius&#39; notes\r<br />\r<br />CHANGELOG\r<br />1.1b - Uploaded Fallhammer&#39;s version (with books in merchant shops)\r<br />1.1 - Added Jius Opus&#39; Map\r<br />1 - First release\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS:\r<br />\r<br />Fallhammer - for V1.1b\r<br />Bethesda\r<br />Modding Community\r<br />UESP\r<br />Josh from Giannipc.com in his guide for the nirnroot map\r<br />Gamebanshee for the Jius&#39; Opus map",
