  "descriptionHtml": "So upon reaching Solstheim, I, like you, went crazy, getting new items, and resources for crafting. Only to realized that , given I don\\'t use fast travel, I am gonna need to keep hauling my loot back and forth between there and Skyrim. This inspired me to throw together a player home to use while in Solstheim. Forget the fact that you get a home already in a brief quest (which looks more like a tomb inside), we all know you want to head strait to Telvanni or other areas you remember from Morrowind.\r\n\r\nThis house has;\r\n4 Bookshelves\r\n3 Mannequins\r\n2 Five weapon racks\r\n5 Weapon Plaques\r\n1 Shield and Weapon Plaque\r\nEnchanting Table\r\nAlchemy Table\r\nWorkbench\r\nGrindstone\r\nTanning rack\r\nForge\r\nStaff station\r\nCooking pot\r\nLots of storage\r\nAnd plenty of clutter\r\n\r\nNow I\\'m only gonna say this once, I just threw this together in about 4 hours (while all you are playing) so please bear with any small bugs that may pop up. However I will say all storeage should be safe, and both the new smithing forge and the staff crafting station are included.\r\n\r\nI do plan to update this mod, however as soon as it\\'s uploaded, I\\'m going back to spending time in the new DLC, and no matter how much anyone begs for updates, their gonna have to wait. I\\'m not going to let modding get in the way of my enjoying the game.\r\n\r\nWell enough of all that! Look at the screens, decide if ya wanna try it, if so, download, and enjoy!\r\n\r\n-UPDATE 1.1-\r\nSpread Lighting around to make things a tad brighter.\r\nAdded two strongboxes upstairs.\r\nAdded basement library with plenty of bookshelves.\r\nAdded more clutter as I felt inclined to add.\r\nAdded potion shelf near alchemy area.\r\n\r\nThanks;\r\nBlary for all his AWESOME meshes he uploads for modders!",
