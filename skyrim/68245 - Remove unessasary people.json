  "descriptionHtml": "So I&#39;ve been looking for a way to remove all NPCS from skyrim without effecting my access to the cities.\r<br />after searching the interwebs i found no mod that does this the way i want it.. so i made my own with what was available online.\r<br />\r<br />A bat script that removes everyone i could so i can repopulate skyrims world with my own mods of choice. \r<br />I found a mass revive script by Toaster on the skyrim forums and edited it to remove everyone instead of resurrecting them. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />first zip is to remove everyone (nopeople), It does work,Â  i made this so it leaves all the merchants. \r<br /> when i ran it, it did throw a couple errors but i still saw no one but gaurds and people marked essential after the fact. I assume the errors were because i had been playing that save for a few days and already cheated lol.\r<br />\r<br />to run this open console and type \r<br />\r<br />Bat nopeople\r<br />\r<br />The second script is the same as the first except with most of the merchants included, so they get deleted as well\r<br />\r<br />The 3rd script is to enable all that was disabled, just in case you already saves and want everyone back. \r<br />\r<br />to run this type \r<br />\r<br />bat peopleback\r<br />\r<br />personally i made sure i was indoors and away from everyone when i ran this to be sure i didn&#39;t cause a crash. As i play a bit more if i find anyone i want out of my game I&#39;ll add them to a revised version of these scripts. The original resurrection script was from 2013 so i don&#39;t know if he did have everyone on the list from all DLC packs. the list was a bit over 700 people long so i think so. \r<br />\r<br />It does not remove any guards as far as i&#39;m aware. Thanks to Toaster from the skyrim forums for making his resurrect all list so i didn&#39;t have to hunt down all the ref ids. ",
