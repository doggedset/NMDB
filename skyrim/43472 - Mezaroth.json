It is said his name was given to him the day he drew his power from the very halls of Mezaroth, and allowed the lost souls of the dead to rise into the shadows as his slaves. He has been in slumber for nearly four thousand years, but as with the return of the dragons, so does he awake.\r\n[u]Location[/u]\r\nThe Location of the dungeon is south-west of Falkreath, following the road passed Halldir\\'s Cairn, at a place called Cyrodiil Pass.\r\n[u]Requirements[/u]\r\nSkyrim\r\nTorches\r\nThe Wooden Key found on the body of a High Elf outside the Dungeon.\r\n[u]Mezaroth\\'s Staff[/u]\r\nDamage = 0\r\nWeight = 8\r\nValue = 12900\r\nEnchantment = Unrelenting Force & 50 Generic Damage[/color]",
