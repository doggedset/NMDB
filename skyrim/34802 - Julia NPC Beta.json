  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first attempt at creating a NPC.  I put my wife (in real life) into the Bannered Mare in Whiterun.  She is a combat ranger. You need to add your own weapons and outfit.  I used cbbe curvy, better females, CBBE face pack, eyes of beauty, for her to look like the screen shot, you shouldnt need any of those mods though.\r\n\r\n To get her to follow you you MUST have a follower mod. I use amazing follower tweaks.\r\n ## updated ## now she can be a follower, do NOT need another mod.\r\n\r\n## updated##  If you had version 1.0 to update to1.1, you need to dismiss her , save,  and then download mod again and go get her at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun.  \r\n\r\n  You MUST have ApachiSkyHair.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you like her, please post pics.\r\nComments and ideas welcomed.",
