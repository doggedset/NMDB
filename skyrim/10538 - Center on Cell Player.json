  "descriptionHtml": "This is for modders. This replaces the default character the game chooses to give you when you use center on cell from the main menu. This is for utility as much as it is just for fun.\r\n\r\nHe is level 81 and equiped with:\r\n- Full Dragon Plate Armor\r\n- Maxed Leveled enchanted weapons of all weap types\r\n- Maxed Leveled enchanted robes of each magic school\r\n- Maxed Leveled staffs of each magic school\r\n- Level 100 in all skills\r\n- All the shouts\r\n- Over 9000 Daedric arrows, gold, lockpicks and torches!\r\n- 600 HP, Stamina and Magic\r\n\r\nFuture plans:\r\nAdd skill points once the player is loaded (i don\\'t know how to script this yet)\r\nAdd all the proper spells to the character inventory\r\nAdd Dragon Souls to the player inventory\r\nMake the character drunk for laughs\r\nMake the character not over-encumbered\r\n\r\nIf anyone could help me fill in the future plans and/or the scripting that would be great. I\\'m very novice when it comes to scripting.\r\n\r\nToggle God Mode to get around the encumbrance.\r\n\r\nDO NOT USE THIS if you are going to play the game for real. This is purely just for use when testing mods. This replaces the default player. If this is on when you start a new game, the character will have everything from this mod.\r\n \r\nenjoy",
