  "descriptionHtml": "Annoyed at the length of the cooldown time with shouts, I decided to add the reduced shout time enchantment to a set of Greybeard Robes, and ring. I\\'m sure a similar mod must exist, although a heavy and light armour version may not, hopefully giving this mod some use.\r\n\r\nThe robes can be found upon the \\\"Roguish Gent\\\" in the Whiterun Hall of the Dead Catacombs, who will attack on sight. He is right at the entrance, so will hopefully not be missed.\r\n\r\nIn his inventory you can also find a set which counts as light armour, which is slightly better than Elvish, and a Heavy set, a slight improvment of Orcish.\r\n\r\nExtract to your Skyrim Data folder. (...\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim) \r\n\r\n\r\nBugs?\r\n-A problem with the initial robe is that it appears not to register as clothing, causing NPCs to comment on your lack of attire. I believe this issue has been resolved, but please say if it has not.\r\n-From the comments the enchantments may not always stack (I\\'ve had no problem with this). Apparently typing \\\"Player.setav shoutrecoverymult #\\\" in the console, where \\\"#\\\" is the number of stacks the enchanment can have will overcome this problem.",
