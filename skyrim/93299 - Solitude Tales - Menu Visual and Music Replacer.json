The general location, be it upon an arch above the sea, works alongside other marvelous features in creating the perfect city, home for a family or just a general visit. There is nothing I enjoy more than a visit to Solitude in my adventures. So, presenting...[color=#ffff00] Solitude Tales.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />I think it's obvious that [url=https://www.malukah.com/]Malukah[/url]﻿'s covers are a common theme on the menus I create. I really struggle to find a song to compete. So, in this package you are welcomed by Malukah's cover of \"Three Hearts as One\" from the ESO bards. Yeah, wrong game, I know, but we're still in the same universe so accept it, lol. Visually, I have found a wonder of art from the beach perspective baring every detail of the city possible. I can't find the author, so if anybody knows who created this image, please let me know ASAP. Definitely not going uncredited any time soon.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][size=6][u]Installation[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=4][i][b][color=#ff0000]&gt;&gt;&gt; MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR FILES BACKED UP INCASE OF UNINSTALLATION[/color][/b][/i] [color=#ff0000][i][b]&lt;&lt;&lt;[/b][/i][/color][/size]\n<br />[size=4]The installation process is simple. All you need to do is download the .zip file manually and place it in your Skyrim folder. Seen as the folder is named \"[color=#ffff00]Data[/color]\" it will automatically place all the sub-folders [color=#ffff00]into your Data folder[/color]. Requires nothing more.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][u][size=6]Uninstallation[/size][/u][/color]\n<br />[size=4]Delete the files located in these directories and replace them with the default files, or other of your choice.[/size]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]Wallpaper:[/color] [size=4]C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;textures&#92;interface&#92;objects then delete [color=#ffff00]mainmenuwallpaper.dds\n<br />[size=6][size=5]Music:[/size] [/size][/color]C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;music&#92;special then delete [color=#ffff00]mus_maintheme.xwm[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]▅▄▃▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▂▃▄▅[/size]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]I'm open to people sending me screenshots of scenery they have personally taken or music they have created if you are interested in having your song or image made into a menu screen and featured as a mod.
