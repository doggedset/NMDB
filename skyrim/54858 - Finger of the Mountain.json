It&#39;s &#036;25 for the super Game of the Year edition that gives you all the dlc plus two houses from the start.\r<br />2. This is a god spell that all one needs to do is point in the general direction of your enemies (or Braith) and cause death.\r<br />\r<br />The spell can be found on the floor of Dragonsreach as you walk in and does not require much magjica to use. \r<br />\r<br />No, you do not need to ask permission from me, use it as you please.\r<br />\r<br />And before you ask, no, you do not need any dlc for this mod to work, keep licking that vanilla ice cream. \r<br />\r<br />Workshop link for the lazy: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=270577696",
