  "descriptionHtml": "Brodir Grove and Nerevarine by EndgameV\r\n..........................................................................................................................................\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nThis is my attempt to add a few things that I thought were missing from Solstheim. This mod adds Ulfgar the Unending\\'s dwelling from Bloodmoon, now called Brodir Cave and home to Reavers, to Brodir Grove. \r\n\r\nAlso included is a little piece of nostalgia, for all you Morrowind players, hidden at the rear of the cave. I won\\'t reveal too much, but hopefully the image gallery will help wet your appetite. There are two versions of the Journal, one with and one without a final message from the author, Choose only one file.\r\n\r\nSince Solstheim is the first place Bethesda have deemed to revisit in one their games, I thought it was important to add a stronger sense of return for players between two generations of elder scrolls games. This is my attempt, I hope you\\'ll enjoy it.\r\n\r\n!Spoilers! About the Journal:\r\nPlease don\\'t be quick to rage at why things are missing, I know that not EVERY entry from the game is in the journal, but due to the numerous player choices available and to keep the game from freezing from all the text that would be in it, I\\'ve only included the main quest entries (vanilla and DLC) and a few side quest entries that have been shown to be confirmed in later games.\r\n\r\nThe author message on the final page is of my own hand so don\\'t assume it to be canon or associated with Bethesda, if you don\\'t like it feel free to use the normal esp which removes the message.\r\n\r\nRequired Files:\r\nDragonborn DLC of course.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nChoose only one file!\r\nMod Manager:\r\nJust click \\'Download With Manager\\' and install\r\nManually:\r\nExtract the esp to your skyrim/Data folder\r\n\r\nSkyrim and Morrowind belong to Bethesda Softworks\r\n",
