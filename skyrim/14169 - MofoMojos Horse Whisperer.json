  "descriptionHtml": "Provides the \\\"Horse Whisperer\\\" spell which will gives you a chance to tame stolen horses into considering you as their owner. \r\n\r\nYes...yes... I see there are tons of others out there too. I did this, simply because I wrote the first one for Oblivion, http://tes.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4515, and wanted to do one for Skyrim too. \r\n\r\nTo use:\r\nYou will be given the \\\"Horse Whisperer\\\" spell on starting the game wih the mod enabled. If you steal or find a horse you can use the spell on the horse. You will have a chance to subdue the horse based on a combination of your speechcraft and illusion skills. Failure will cause the horse to run away in fear for a short time, possibly getting in a hit before doing so. Be wary, your followers may view this as an aggresive move on the horses part and attack it. \r\n\r\nIf you successfully tame the horse, ride the horse and then it will be considered yours completely, and stop wandering off.
