  "descriptionHtml": "This is a weapon pack that I plan on expanding with more weapons in the future. For now, it has just 3 weapons:\r\n\r\n\r\nDark Blade (Greatsword, Two Handed)\r\nLong and deadly blade that is a cross between a Japanese katana and a Middle Eastern scimitar.\r\n\r\nDamage: 20\r\nWeight: 16\r\nReach: 1.8\r\nSpeed: 1\r\nRecipe: 4 Steel Ingots, 2 Leather Strips. Requires \\'Steel Smithing\\' perk.\r\n\r\n\r\nDark Sword (Sword, One Handed)\r\nShort version of the Dark Blade.\r\n\r\nDamage: 12\r\nWeight: 8\r\nReach: 1.25\r\nSpeed: 1.25\r\nRecipe: 2 Steel Ingots, 2 Leather Strips. Requires \\'Steel Smithing\\' perk.\r\n\r\n\r\nDark Glaive (Sword, One Handed)\r\nLightweight glaive suitable for dual wielding.\r\n\r\nDamage: 10\r\nWeight: 2\r\nReach: 0.8\r\nSpeed: 1.25\r\nRecipe: 2 Steel Ingots, 2 Leather Strips. Requires \\'Steel Smithing\\' perk.\r\n\r\n \r\nIf you don\\'t want to use the forge to create those weapons, you can find them all in a chest to the west of Riverwood, near the Guardian Stones, down by the river. Chest also contains a couple of Black Soul Gems, if anyone wants to enchant the weapons and try them out on a nearby hunter who has been hunting and fishing in those parts for years. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit tool. Let me know if you experience any problems with it. And if you liked it, feel free to rate and comment.\r\n",
