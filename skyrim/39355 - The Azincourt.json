Forced into battle and against all odds, they defeated the French and slaughtered the flower of French nobility.\r\n \r\nThis sword is a tribute to that stunning conflict and is one type of sword that would have seen service on both sides.\r\n \r\nOakeshott describes the Type XV as a strongly tapering, acutely pointed blade of flattened diamond cross-section. The sub-type XVa is often longer and slimmer than the Type XV, but with the primary difference being the longer grip. This type of sword was referred to as an epée bâtarde or \\\"bastard sword.\\\" \r\n \r\n[heading][size=5][font=georgia,serif]Details:[/font][/size][/heading]\r\nThe Azincourt.\r\nA stunning historically inspired bastard sword with accurate dimensions and great texture detail. The sword comes with a scabbard and can only be crafted under the steel section at the skyforge (Steel smithing required). For those of you that have downloaded my previous mod, Glimmer, you can expect the same level detail and elegance on the Azincourt that was first introduced on Glimmer. Again, these textures are 2048x2048 and offer a life like rendition of the weapon. Although, it is worth mentioning that the Azincourt has quite a few dents and bruises, since I wanted to capture what the sword would look like after a battle the likes of the one that took place in 1415. \r\n \r\nAt the skyforge you will be able to craft a 1-Handed and 2-Handed version of the sword. Both with slightly better stats than the ebony sword and greatsword. Some of you might also notice that both weapons are identical in size, and the reason for this is that the two weapons are essentially the same. If you for some reason notice that the 1-Handed version is stronger than the 2-Handed equivalent, this is because you\\'re ingame character is more skilled with 1-Handed weapons.\r\n \r\nNow get in game and start slashing!\r\n\r\n[heading][size=5][font=georgia,serif]Installation:[/font][/size][/heading]\r\nTo find out how to install or uninstall \\\"Azincourt\\\", a simple google search will do the trick. I do not\r\ninclude instructions here to maintain a \\\"small\\\" mod description.
