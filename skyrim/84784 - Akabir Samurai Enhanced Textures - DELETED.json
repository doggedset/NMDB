  "descriptionHtml": "Hi guys, I decided to give you one last Enhanced Textures before I&#39;m going away for a long pause or perhaps even for good.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve always loved this armor and I think my Enhanced Textures make it shine.\r<br />I&#39;ve no idea where this armor came from and I haven&#39;t asked around if it&#39;s ok to be uploaded on Nexus. I hope it is ok and that I&#39;m not doing all this work for nothing.\r<br />\r<br />As always, these are not re-textures, but only magic tricks I made on photoshop, hence the name Enhanced Textures. They are not even 4K actually, but all 2K. I wrote 4K because this armor handle textures in a different way than most of the others: there are 8 of them instead of the usual 4, so they are as detailed and heavy on the pc as if they were 4K textures.\r<br />\r<br />About the images: I don&#39;t have a funcioning Skyrim right now (and that&#39;s why I&#39;m taking a pause) so I can&#39;t make new images with the original textures. I had to use a very old and very ugly screenshot.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy it.\r<br />\r<br />Original mod: [url=http://mitakusaner.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-991.html]Sky TM[/url]\r<br />UUNP version, not required but reccomended: [url=http://wtfuun.tumblr.com/post/145491234019/akabir-samurai-bikini-armor-uunp-hdt-need-this]Diablio Link[/url]\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS:\r<br />Ofam for creating the original mod",
