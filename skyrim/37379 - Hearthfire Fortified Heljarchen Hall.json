Anything else\r\n\r\n===============\r\n1. DESCRIPTION\r\n===============\r\n\r\nHearthfire Fortified is a mod series that aims to give the Hearthfire homes some well needed protection whilst maintaining lore and realism. This .esp focuses on Heljarchen Hall. The walls have been inspired by those of Whiterun, as in such barren lands, a strong defense is required. While not as well protected as some of the forts in the area, Heljarchen Hall now has the means to fend off anything from petty thieves to a bandit assault.\r\n\r\n- A perimeter wall has been added, complete with a main gatehouse and three towers as well as scaffold walkways.\r\n- Four guards will now man these towers.\r\n- Two archery ranges have been added, one inside the walls and one outside.\r\n- General clutter makes the property feel more used. Crates, barrels and carts give the impression of being able to survive a lengthy amount of time under siege.\r\n- A well has also been added to simulate the basic needs of a position under said siege.\r\n- A paved road now leads up to the fort, making it feel more connected to the outside world.\r\n\r\nNEW: Heljarchen Hall Light\r\n\r\nAs of version 1.1, there is now a light version of the fortifications. Installing this one will replace the stone walls with wooden stockades, as well as alter some of the features of the grounds. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod simply adds the fortifications; you do not need to build them yourselves. Therefore, it is advised to build most of the exterior of your home before installing the mod. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod simply adds the fortifications; you do not need to build them yourselves.
