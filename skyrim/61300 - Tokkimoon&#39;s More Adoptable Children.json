Where do I find Minna the Wood Elf Girl?\r<br />A. In Riften Honorhall Orphanage\r<br />\r<br />2.) Where do I find Sher&#39;Tul the Orc Girl?\r<br />A. In Largashbur Shagrol&#39;s Longhouse just southwest of Riften\r<br />\r<br />3.) Where do I find Zirain the Dark Elf Boy?\r<br />A. In Windhelm&#39;s New Gnisis Corner Club\r<br />\r<br />4.) Where do I find Solitar and Shalina the High Elf Boy and Girl?\r<br />A. In Markarth&#39;s Understone Keep in the tower just left of the door leading to the Nchuand-Zel Excavation Site\r<br />\r<br />5.) What ENB do you use?\r<br />A. I use RealVision ENB\r<br />\r<br />6.) How do I adopt?\r<br />A. Per [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Adoption]The Elder Scrolls Wiki[/url], &#34;In order to adopt a child, either a [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Houses_%28Skyrim%29]house[/url] with a children&#39;s bedroom, or a [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Homestead]homestead[/url] furnished with a bed and a chest is required.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />7.) What if I have already adopted two children?\r<br />A. I highly recommend using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249/?]Hearthfire multiple adoptions[/url] - Now with custom home support for kids and spouse by [b]TMPhoenix[/b]\r<br />\r<br />8.) Will you make more adoptable children?\r<br />A. I really just wanted to fill out children for the other neglected races and now I feel pretty good about accomplishing that.  So, I&#39;m going to take a break now.  Maybe I&#39;ll get motivated at a later time and pick it up again but for now, the answer is no.  Modding is very time consuming and my husband is about to pass my level&#33;  *insert Aquaman voice* That&#39;s outrageous&#33;  \r<br />\r<br />9.) What about changing clothing?\r<br />A. You may need another mod that can force them to wear different clothing.  The RS Children clothing will fit them perfectly but other attire may/will most likely show the hideous neck gap.  Basically, the original children clothing was never set up to handle incorporating new children races and you would have to go through each and every one of the pieces of clothing and set my new children races as being among the list of races allowed to wear the clothing.  This is too much work for me and I don&#39;t like modifying vanilla assets because it could cause conflicts with other mods down the line.  \r<br />\r<br />10.) How do I change the eyes/hair/skin color?\r<br />A. If you have experience with the creation kit and Racemenu, I have uploaded an optional file containing all of the exported heads for each of the children from Racemenu.  You will want to drop the files (NOT THE FOLDERS) but the files for each of the children into the SKSE directory (you should have something like C:&#92;Games&#92;Steam&#92;SteamApps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;SKSE&#92;Plugins&#92;CharGen).  From there, go into game and into Racemenu and use the sculpt tab to IMPORT the head you desire.  When you are done making modifications, export your new head with a new name and use a tool like NifMerge to merge the new face with the Creation Kit exported FaceGeom face mesh.  If I can do it, you can too&#33;  :D\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FFAA][size=4][u][b]********UPDATES********[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#FF0000][b]UPDATE: 1/23/15 [/b][/color]- Squished the purple hair bug that was plaguing the two high elf children.  They will feel less itchy now.  Also, I updated the optional file of Zirain (YIN Version) to now include the High Elf Children.  \r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/61300-3-1421642699.jpg[/img]\r<br />[color=#FF0000][b]UPDATE: 1/18/15 [/b][/color]- I have included twin Altmer children, a boy and a girl named Solitar and Shalina, to Markarth Understone keep.  There is an image showing their exact location.  To find it, enter Markarth Understone Keep and immediately go to the left. Climb a small hill and continue going straight. Climb the set of four stairs, which lead to a larger flight of stairs. At the top of the second set of stairs is the entrance to the excavation site, turn left and proceed up the tower with the lite fire pit.  [b][color=#00FFAA](TL;DR - It is the tower just to the left of the entrance to the Nchuand-Zel Excavation Site.)[/color][/b]  The children are often sitting in the stone chairs around the tower edge, so look for them there.\r<br />\r<br /> [img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/61300-1-1421379149.jpg[/img]\r<br />[color=#FF0000][b]UPDATE:  1/15/2015 [/b][/color]- I have included an optional file to make Zirain the darker &#34;Yin&#34; version of the original file&#39;s &#34;Yang&#34;.  Reference new images posted to see what he looks like.  If you want Zirain to have dark hair and skin, just download the optional file.  The optional file is standalone meaning that the main file is not needed to make all of the original children work with the new version of Zirain.  You can overwrite files if prompted.  Be advised that this file does not include the new High Elf children added in version 2.0.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FFAA][size=4][u][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />   - Skyrim up to date\r<br />   - Hearthfires\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FFAA][size=4][u][b]THANKS AND PERMISSIONS[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />I want to give a huge thanks to Ranaline for giving me permission to use her RS Children Resources that were used in the making of this mod&#33;  \r<br />Also, many thanks to Hello Santa for SG Texture Renewal and SG Hairs, Expired for Racemenu, Empyrean42 for Empyrean Warpaints, and also to LogRaam for The Eyes of Beauty&#33;  \r<br />And a special thanks to my husband for helping me test this mod out&#33; :)\r<br />\r<br />Last but not least, thank you to everyone on Nexus that have been so supportive of my work and images&#33;  You are awesome&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FFAA][size=4][u][b]CREDITS[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55555/?]RS Children Overhaul [/url]by Ranaline\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35267/?]SG Female Textures Renewal[/url] by Hello Santa\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?]The Eyes of Beauty[/url] by LogRaam\r<br />SG Hair pack by Hello Santa\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]Racemenu[/url] by Expired\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61332/?]Empyrean Warpaints[/url] by Empyrean42\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />[color=#FF0000][b]**** PLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD THIS MOD ANYWHERE ELSE ****\r<br />[/b][/color][/size]Rights:\r<br />- This mod is exclusive to Nexus and will not be uploaded to the Steam Workshop.  \r<br />If it is uploaded there, it has been so without my permission&#33;\r<br />- You MAY NOT use any part of this mod for commercial purposes, including (but not limited to) creating a paid mod for the Steam Workshop.",
