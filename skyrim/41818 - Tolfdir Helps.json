  "modName": "Tolfdir Helps",
  "summary": "Tolfdir can help you clear Saarthal rather than remaining behind.",
  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION:\r<br />\r<br />During “Under Saarthal,” instead of instructing you to delve into the ruins while he examines the sarcophagus room, Tolfdir will instead offer to aid you. If you accept his offer, he will follow you through Saarthal and aid you. If you decline, the quest will proceed normally and he will still appear just before you discover the Eye of Magnus.\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS:\r<br />\r<br />A working copy of the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Place the contents of the .7z file in your &#34;Data&#34; folder, which is usually located under Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />The ReadMe document and the .bsl file are not required for the mod to run -- you may keep them or discard them.\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Delete the included .esp and .bsa file.\r<br />\r<br />The nature of Skyrim’s scripting language, Papyrus, means that, even following this procedure, your Papyrus log will continue to throw errors about missing scripts, potentially leading to save game bloat. There is, lamentably, nothing that I can do about this -- you have been warned.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATING:\r<br />\r<br />Replace all older files with newer versions. If in doubt, replace all mod files with the contents of the latest uploaded archive.\r<br />\r<br />No in-game configuration is necessary.\r<br />\r<br />BUGS:\r<br />\r<br />As of yet, none.\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY:\r<br />\r<br />This should be compatible with practically any mod.",
