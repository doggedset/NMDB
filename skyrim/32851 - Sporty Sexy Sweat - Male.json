With moderate specularity settings it should look similar to water; only reflective with a light source under a certain direction. However when these settings are too high, it will appear white. See ENB tweaking for more info.\r\n\r\nQ: What is this mod?\r\nA: This mod is only a \\'shine texture\\' and doesn\\'t contain little information how your body actually looks like in game. It doesn\\'t make your character nude or muscular, only shiny!\r\n\r\nQ: What the heck is a specular map?\r\nA: A specular map allows an additional lighting per pixel enabling a shiny effect on game models. This mod uses it to create a diffuse gloss on the entire body as well as some drops and streams of sweat or water.\r\n\r\nQ: What can I do to thank you/xs2reality for creating this wonderful mod?\r\nA: Endorsements are only to rank the mod on the Nexus site. I will always love to see your screenshots to see what everybody is doing with their game. \r\n\r\n[i] Got any more questions? Feel free to message me through the Nexus, I constantly check it, and would be glad to help with any problems or direct you to someone who can fix them!
