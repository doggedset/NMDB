  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#00FF00] [size=5] Description [/size] [/color]\r<br />\r<br />I made this in a couple of minutes as a request:\r<br />\r<br />The Bullseye perk is supposed to give you &#34;15% chance of paralyzing the target for a few seconds.&#34; but it actually gives you 16%. This mod fixes that.\r<br />\r<br />This issue has already been fixed in the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19]USKP[/url], if you use it you don&#39;t need my mod to fix it. However, you can still use the Dragonslayer perk to replace the Bullseye perk if you don&#39;t like it that much.\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[color=#00FF00] [size=5] Dragonslayer Perk [/size] [/color]\r<br />\r<br />Alternatively, you can replace the Bullseye perk with a new perk I made. User Yujimbo requested me to change/modify the perk entirely because he was having issues with the paralyze effect, so I thought &#39;why not? this is a good time to be creative&#39;, and I came up with the Dragonslayer perk. It&#39;s my first attempt at making a new perk from scratch, so let me know what you guys think. \r<br />\r<br />The perk grants a 20% chance of dealing double damage to dragons when using bows or crossbows. The reasons I decided to go with this specific creature-type oriented perk are:\r<br />\r<br />- Getting to 100 in any skill should give access to a cool perk in my opinion, but the Bullseye perk isn&#39;t that great if you ask me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it is useful in some circumstances, but I just don&#39;t find it that interesting.\r<br />\r<br />- I always though that pure archers lacked the damage output needed to take down dragons. Personally I don&#39;t use any &#39;increased arrows/bolts damage&#39; options from my own Arrows and Bolts Tweaks mod, I kinda like vanilla arrows/bolts damage so I didn&#39;t want to increase it. But dragons are tough opponents (as they should be) so I thought giving archers a little extra damage this way would be welcomed.\r<br />\r<br />- I also based my decision on mods like [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3829]Deadly Dragons[/url], and other mods that make dragon fights harder and less frequent (like [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16724]Skreee[/url]). For everyday fights the archery perk tree already grants +100% bow/crossbow damage with all Overdraw perks maxed out, and 3 levels on the Critical Shot perks boost critical hits, but dragon fights are supposed to be EPIC, so giving archers a boost for an epic fight made sense to me, and sounded cool too. Now Dragons will truly fear the Dovahkiin&#39;s ranged attacks.\r<br />\r<br />- Last but not least, there&#39;s not a single dragon-related perk in ANY of the perk trees, kind of weird for a dragonborn not to be able to improve his/her dragon-slaying abilities... After all, The Book of the Dragonborn does say &#39;The Nords tell tales of Dragonborn heroes who were great dragonslayers, able to steal the power of the dragons they killed.&#39;\r<br />[line]\r<br />[color=#00FF00] [size=5] Installation [/size] [/color]\r<br />\r<br />Install either &#39;Bullseye Perk Fix&#39; or &#39;Bullseye to Dragonslayer Perk&#39; (only one) with NMM, or manually copy the chosen .esp file to your SkyrimData directory (and activate the .esp using the Skyrim Launcher).\r<br />[line]\r<br />[color=#00FF00] [size=5] Credits: [/size] [/color]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/938388]83Willow[/url]: for letting me use her screenshots.\r<br />[*][url=http://nilecitypatrik.deviantart.com]Nilecitypatrik[/url] (@ DeviantArt): for providing the title&#39;s background image for this mod.\r<br />[/list][line]\r<br />[color=#00FF00] [size=5] My Other Mods [/size] [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[center] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11941] [img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8307/7762716856_e1a790e93b.jpg[/img] [/url] [/center] \r<br />[center] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10125] [img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8142/7360210334_4f525aaf01.jpg[/img] [/url] [/center][center] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17968] [img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7232/7321224062_3b226a6e05_z.jpg[/img] [/url] [/center]",
