  "descriptionHtml": "Red Gorak. (Made using the Official Creation Kit, not the Nexus program. In case you were wondering.) \r\n\r\nNo she’s not red, that’s her name. Her True name lost in history so long ago. Queen of the Gorak tribe that sat on a thrown of skulls surrounded by a pool of blood she earned the name The Red Gorak due to her bloody battles back in Ancient days where once she rules with no mercy. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow cursed and bound to walk the earth in Undead form she strives to make amends for her past deeds in order to be released from eternal unlife. In her travels she was passing by a village that was recently saved by the dovahkiin. She realized the potential in allying herself with the Dragon Born to accomplish greatness and make up for all past suffering she had caused. \r\n\r\n\r\nRed Gorak can be found in Beggars Row in the town of Riften. This skeleton is an essential character and will be hard to kill. She will follow you on your adventures and help along the way and will be glad to take the lives of those who would do Evil. Unless of course you too are Evil and decide to start a murder campaign she will kill anything that does not agree with you. She may also be there to shoulder some of your burdens’ and carry items and equipment . ",
