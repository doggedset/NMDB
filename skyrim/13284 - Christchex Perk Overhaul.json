  "descriptionHtml": "[UPDATE]\r\n     3/20/2012\r\n- Removed speech temporarily... also considering removing archery as I\\'m currently updating it.\r\n- New version of speech esp.\r\n- Considering trying out the Uncapper, finally. Though, I have a hard time seeing any reason to have skills go beyond 100. I use a leveling speed reducer (by 50%) and part of the reason why I\\'m doing this is because I felt there were too many perk points and not enough perks in any given skill. My characters continually became generalized.\r\n\r\n[DESCRIPTION]\r\nThis current version has only expanded the Archery and Speech skill trees. I plan to release each skill tree as a separate esp file for modularity.\r\nThe next skill tree I\\'m working to expand is one-handed.\r\n\r\n[SKILL SPECIALIZATION]\r\nEach skill tree now has a new perk associated with that skill referred to as a \\\"Major Skill\\\" choice. Each of these perks increases the speed in which you gain levels in said skill by 35% while lowering all other skill rates by 4%. These effects are cumulative; or if you prefer, \\\"Stacking.\\\" What this means is that if you choose two major perks, you get a 31% increase instead of the 35%, and all other skills will level 8% slower. In addition, the best perks in each skill tree require their related \\\"Major Skill\\\" perk in addition to their vanilla requirements.\r\n\r\nI have uploaded an optional skill specialization file, this will only be around until I complete expanding all 18 perks. It\\'s so that all the skills have their associated major skill perk.\r\n\r\n[EPIC PERKS]\r\nOn top of being able to choose your major skill, you can also become a veteran, which has no bonus other than unlocking epic perks in the skill trees. Your character can only ever have one epic perk.\r\n\r\n[ARCHERY SKILL TREE]\r\nI have added an additional 20 new perks and ranks, bringing the total number of points to complete the archery tree to 36.\r\nI have also moved some of the vanilla perks around to offer two distinctive skill trees, one intended as a sniper and the other as a combat archer. In many cases I modified the vanilla perks to require a lower/higher skill and benefit in line with additional ranks or all around balance.\r\n\r\nThe new perks I have added are:\r\nCombat Archery (3 ranks): Gives bonus damage if target is within a close distance.\r\nKnowledge of the Land: Grants a 10% movement speed bonus if outdoors.\r\nSeasoned Huntsman: Grants a damage bonus against animals. OooOo, scary.\r\nStalker: Grants a damage bonus against creatures if sneaking.\r\nTrick Shot (2 ranks): Chance to disarm an opponent.\r\n\r\nVanilla perks with added ranks:\r\nOverdraw: Two additional ranks, the last of which is epic class and triples your damage.\r\nEagle Eye: Two additional ranks\r\nHunters Discipline: Two additional ranks\r\nPower Shot: One additional rank\r\nQuickshot: Two additional ranks.\r\nCritical shot: One additional epic class rank that trades off 100% of critical hits with half bow speed.\r\n\r\n[SPEECH SKILL TREE]\r\nI\\'ve added an additional 15 perks, bringing Speech\\'s total to 28.\r\nMoved some vanilla perks around.\r\n\r\nNew Perks:\r\nClassy Buyer: 10% discount on buying if wearing rich clothes.\r\nPatron: 10% better prices at Inns.\r\nTrained Voice (5 ranks): Reduces time between shouts, has epic rank perk, too.\r\n\r\nAdded ranks:\r\nHaggling: 2 additional ranks, including an epic class rank that betters prices by 50%.\r\nIntimidation: 2 additional ranks, however the first two give lower bonuses than vanilla.\r\nPersuasion: 1 additional rank.\r\nAllure: 1 additional rank.\r\n\r\n[COMPATIBILITY]\r\nWill not be compatible with any other perk mod. However, if you wish to use a different perk mod for a specific skill tree that I have yet to expand, just place that mod below ccPerkOverhaul_SkillSpecialization.esp and you\\'ll only be missing my major perk for that tree.\r\n\r\n[INSTALLATION]\r\nUse 7zip, unzip contents into your data folder, including the script! It should be in Data/Scripts or else this mod will not work. Also be sure to keep a backup save.\r\n\r\n[LOAD ORDER]\r\nI\\'d recommend placing them at the bottom of your load order... it should look like this as well\r\nccPerkOverhaul\r\nccPerkOverhaul_SkillSpecialization.esp (optional)\r\nccPerkOverhaul_[Skill Name].esp\r\n\r\nThe individual skill files can be in any order as long as they come after ccPerkOverhaul and the optional Skill Specialization.\r\n\r\n[UNINSTALL]\r\nYou will likely lose any perk points spent on any new perks added by this mod, but should keep the vanilla ones just fine. You have been warned!\r\n\r\n[VERSION HISTORY]\r\nV0.60b\r\n- Created and added the required master file ccPerkOverhaul to centralize recurrent entries.\r\n- Expanded the Speech skill tree.\r\n\r\nV0.50b\r\n- First release\r\n- Only expanded the archery skill tree.\r\n\r\n[FUTURE PLANS]\r\nExpand the remaining skill trees! Of course.",
