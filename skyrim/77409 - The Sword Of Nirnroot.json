  "descriptionHtml": "So the reason I made this sword is because I was joking around about how playing oblivion made it to where I had to collect every nirnroot I see because of that stupid quest that made you collect all 250, so I thought what if nirnroot actually had purpose In skyrim to. So I made this sword. If you like it, comment that you do and I might make more Nirnroot gear.\r<br />Â ",
