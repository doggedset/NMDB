  "descriptionHtml": "This is an idea I had after going through cave dungeons in Skyrim, while default looks good I had a personal taste for more sandy like caves with a brighter rocky wall to blend into it better.\r\n\r\nAll textures used here are new to skyrim, they weren\\'t taken from some other folder. New fresh feel!\r\n\r\nCheck out the screen-shots and let me know what you think!\r\nHappy Modding!",
