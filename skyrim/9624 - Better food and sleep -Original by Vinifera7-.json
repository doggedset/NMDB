  "modName": "Better food and sleep -Original by Vinifera7-",
  "summary": "Sleep/hunger mod that does not force you into too much micromanagement while retaining a sense of balance and realism.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/rfQtS.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b]Main Features[/b]\r\n\r\n- Vegetables and bread give stamina regeneration.\r\n- Meat, fowl, and cheese give health regeneration.\r\n- Sweets, fruit and fish give magicka regeneration.\r\n- Cooked food is much more beneficial and desirable.\r\n- Alcohol is useful for warrior characters, it gives a very large\r\nbut short boost to stamina, while damaging your Magicka rate.\r\n- Sleep gives stamina and magicka regeneration bonuses.\r\n(Werewolves have constant stamina and magicka regeneration.)\r\n- Any effects from food will stack with those from potions.\r\n- Messages in the upper left corner of the screen inform you\r\nwhen food or sleep effects run out (hunger/weariness).\r\n- 21 new cooking recipe with new textures.\r\n- Balanced and increased food prices\r\n- New item: Milk - distributed through inns, sacks and barrels, \r\ncures poison, but gives \\\"Milk Drinker\\\" effect which destroys your\r\nspeech skill for four game hours (on timescale of 4). Is also an \r\ningredient required for cooking Clam stew.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Note on the timescale:[/b][/size]\r\nThis mod requires you to change your timescale to 4 - 6. It\\'s not completely mandatory, the mod will work properly anyway. However, if you have the default timescale (which is 20) the food effects will last the whole day, sometimes even two. In other words, you will be required to eat only once during 24-48 game hours. Which is not realistic. By setting your timescale to 4, you\\'ll make the time go slower in game and you\\'ll have to eat every 4-6 game hours. To change your timescale, in game press \\\"~\\\" to open console and enter this command: \\\"set timescale to 4\\\"\r\n\r\nFeb 17: There is now an optional default timescale .esp available with shorter effects.\r\nFeb18: Added an esp for those of you who prefer a timescale close to 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Note on the hunger messages:[/b][/size]\r\nIf you eat more than one food of the same quality (e.g. health regen) in succession you will get a message that you are hungry. That happens because you override the first effect with the second. (Yes [color=red]the effects from food do not stack!!![/color] Eating two sweetrolls, will not give you 2x of the effect!) Sometimes they will override each other immediately, but sometimes the game will wait until the first effect fades off, then the second begins. Either way, in these situations you should simply ignore the messages. Or better yet - do not eat more than one food for each stat (health/stamina/magicka) at a time. Also keep in mind the messages appear only for 3 seconds in the upper left corner. They are easy to miss, of course, so you should always keep an eye on [b]Active Effects in the Magic menu[/b].\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Installation:[/b]\r\n\r\n1. Copy everything into Skyrim/Data folder and check the .esp file in Launcher\\'s Data Files.\r\n2. When in game, open console by pressing \\\"~\\\" and enter this command: \\\"bat noreg\\\". \r\n(This will disable the default stat regeneration.) You only have to do this once per character. \r\nAfter you save game, it will remember the setting.\r\n3. Change your timescale. Open console and type: \\\"set timescale to x\\\", with \\\"x\\\" being a number of your choice.\r\n4. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n[b]Uninstallation:[/b]\r\n1. Uncheck/delete the .esp file\r\n2. Optionally: delete the texture and mesh files.\r\n3. In game, open console and enter this: \\\"bat reg\\\", this will restore the standard regeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Other mods:[/b][/size]\r\nI recommend using this with mcxar\\'s excellent [b]Portable Campsite[/b] mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9935\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Changelog:[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]v2.2[/b]\r\n- Some more minor adjustments.\r\n- Messages now inform you of being hungry/tired. Note that if you accidentally eat two health foods, you will get a message that you\\'re hungry.\r\nThat happens because one effect overrides the other, but if you look at the Active Effects, you\\'ll see that regen effect is active and working!\r\n\r\n[b]v2.1[/b]\r\n- Decided to decrease prices significantly. Base values for best foods capped at ~50 coins. (Will cost more than that, if speech skill is low.)\r\n- Some more fixes, and balance tweaks. I\\'m quite satisfied with how everything works now and probably won\\'t change the balance anymore.\r\n\r\n[b]v2[/b]\r\n- Tweaks and fixes all over the place (probably needs more tweaking, I\\'ll get to that later)\r\n- 19 new recipes (plus the 2 by Vinifera7). The new foods can\\'t be bought from vendors, they can only be cooked\r\n(textures and meshes by [b]Wolferoo[/b] and [b]Merilia[/b]) (Thanks to jay3ranger and Archangel7144 for suggestions.)\r\n- Sleep bonus decreased to 12 hours (as suggested by obdown666)\r\n- Prices tweaked a bit\r\n- New item: Milk - distributed through inns, sacks and barrels, cures poison, but gives \r\n\\\"Milk Drinker\\\" effect which destroys your speech skill for four game hours (on timescale of 4).\r\n Is also an ingredient required for cooking Clam stew.\r\n\r\n[b]v1[/b]\r\n- Longer effects\r\n- Regeneration bonuses are larger for the most part.\r\n- Sleep now gives bonuses with a duration of 16 hours.\r\n- Prices for all foods have been balanced (increased for the most part).\r\n- Removed negative stamina effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Compatibility:[/b]\r\n\r\nThis mod is not compatible with anything that changes food items or sleep effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Credits:[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Vinifera7[/b] for the original mod. It can be found here: \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7511\r\n[b]Wolferoo[/b] and [b]Merilia[/b] for their food textures!\r\nAll those who comment and give feedback. Thank you all![/center]",
