  "modName": "Ore to Ingot Ratio Fix",
  "summary": "Fixes the ratio when smelting ore into ingots to 1:1",
  "descriptionHtml": "Personally, I was always frustrated when I would go to smelt my ore, and would be left with one extra that i had to carry around until I found some more. This mod is a simple fix that changes the input and out put ratios for melting ores to 1:1, for example, one ebony ore yields one ebony ingot, and when creating steel with corundum and iron, the player receives two steel ingots in return.",
