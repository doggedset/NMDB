  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE (10-14-2012)\r\n\r\nI am back, and making armors every now and then.  My passion to play Skyrim fluctuates often, so I\\'m not keeping myself as busy with modding as I used to.  Ever since I played Morrowind, I haven\\'t felt like any ES games have compared to it (at least with the exploration and terrain.  I realize the fighting system was crap).  In any case, if you have any questions, concerns, or favors as far as modding armor for RBBB or other body types, let me know and perhaps I can help.\r\n\r\nUPDATE (3-19-2012)\r\n\r\nI must regretfully retire from adding content to this mod.  I started this project with big hopes and dreams (no pun intended), but I simply do not have time in my life right now to put in the effort that it needs.  Actually, I don\\'t even have enough time to play Skyrim, to be perfectly honest.  The last thing I might do is create a tutorial video on how to mod armor for this body type, in case anyone is enthusiastic enough about keeping this mod to get involved, themselves.  \r\n\r\nIn any case, thank you for your support and I apologize if you are really bummed out by this.  I am bummed out as well, but I simply have to move on for now.  When I make the video, I will post it to the videos section.\r\n\r\nIf you appreciate the hard, tedious work I\\'ve done creating this body for you and getting migraines converting armor to fit it...\r\n\r\nPLEASE ENDORSE!  THANK YOU SIRS/MADAMS! \r\n\r\nUPDATE (3-8-2012)\r\n\r\nAlright, so I actually took some time to play Skyrim instead of just sit around modding armors, and I\\'ve come to a realization:\r\n\r\nI need to use a modified body type for nude body, and a different one for the clothed/armored bodies.\r\n\r\nThat\\'s the only way I\\'d be able to fix the breast clipping in the armors. I was fighting with the different armors on, and the breast clipping was out of control with some of the animations, and I want this body type/armor to be tight and professional-looking.\r\n\r\nMy plans for this spring break:\r\n- Create RBBB 1.4 Nude Base : This will be the main nude base, and I\\'ll be working hard getting her into shape.... a round shape, anyways.\r\n- Create RBBB 1.4 Vanilla : This will just be the body base that the vanilla armors will automatically create when you wear them. The body will have smaller breasts to help with the clipping, but most of the vanilla armors don\\'t show cleavage so the breast size change may not even be noticeable with many of the armors.\r\n- Create RBBB 1.4 Skimpy (final version) : The body base that the skimpy armors will use. It will take the nude base, and push the stomach over the belt section. It might also push the breasts together some to help with the clipping.\r\n\r\nAnyways, this is just me speaking what\\'s on my mind. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or comments, now is the time to make them. \r\n\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nWelcome to my page!  This is my first mod, ever!  I am very excited to finally be taking an active role in donating and sharing content with other people rather than just waiting for other people to do it for me.  Well, enough of that.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this mod:  Give the game a true \\\"weight\\\" slider.  Essentially, increasing the weight slider using this mod will make the females actually appear to gain fat.  Now, the type of \\\"fat\\\" that my particular mod creates is one where the thighs, butt, and breasts are the most affected.  This is uncommon to see in real life, but not so \\\"unrealistic\\\" that it will break the immersion of Skyrim.  Furthermore, if you are fighting lizard people who shoot fireballs at you, this body type shouldn\\'t be too hard to believe.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you are looking for a mod that only changes certain NPC\\'s to be fat, or perhaps a different variant of my body, look here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10111.  It\\'s a variant by Razorwire, and be sure to endorse his work if you like it! \r\n\r\nI\\'m very, very new to modding, but thanks to CherryHotaling, and anyone else who wants to lend me a helping hand, this WIP will hopefully become much more developed.  \r\n\r\nWhat is this, specifically?\r\n\r\nIt\\'s a modified femalebody_1 file. Used with the CHSBHC femalebody_0 file, it makes it so the high-end weight not only increases the size of the breasts and butt, but also increases the size of the thighs, calves, stomach, arms, and hips.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\nCHSBHC\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\n\r\nMy body is designed to fit Caliente\\'s CBBE hands at feet at max weight.\r\nAny texture that works with CBBE will work with this body.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1:  Moved the nipples some.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2:\r\n-Increased the curve on the outer hips into the thighs, giving a more \\\"hourglass\\\" figure.\r\n-Increased mass around the kneecaps.\r\n-Increased mass around the calves.\r\n-Increased bulge in the stomach.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3:\r\n-Remodeled the stomach even more (more bulge above the navel to even it out).\r\n\r\nVersion 3.0 (Skimpy Only)\r\n-Bigger butt, stomach flap, closed gap in the thighs, fatter arms.  (WIP until I\\'m satisfied as well as my fans)\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\n\r\nQ: Why doesn\\'t the heavy imperial armor bounce?\r\nA:  Armors with complex skirtbones (heavy imperial, stormcloak, etc.) have problems with the CHSBHC skeleton.  I had to use the default skeleton for those armors, and any others in the future like them.  If you know a way around this, message me.\r\n\r\nQ:  Why is the skimpy body different from the body that uses vanilla armors?\r\nA:  I can\\'t use the larger skimpy body on vanilla armors because... it\\'s too big!  The vanilla armors have way more vertices than the skimpy armors, and stretching them all the way around the skimpy body would make the armor look like it was imported from a N64 game.  With the skimpy armors, they have less \\\"clothing\\\" to stretch around, so it\\'s not so bad.\r\n\r\nQ:  Why can\\'t you make this/that bigger/smaller/wider/etc.?\r\nA:  It\\'s MY fat girl.  Get your own.  (Although, I don\\'t mind receiving opinions and suggestions.  Perhaps I\\'ll like your ideas).\r\n\r\nFuture Plans:\r\n-Remake both vanilla and KK skimpy armor for those who wish to have the weight setting to add to the immersion of the game, as well as those who want the sexy armor for the body.\r\n-Create a face model that also gains weight.\r\n-Earn my degree online in Fatology.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
