  "descriptionHtml": "This is a little edit for &#34;[URL=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2973/]The REAL Fus Ro Dah -Unrelenting Force Shout from Trailer[/URL]&#34; by xchargerfanx \r<br />I created this mod because I liked the original mod but hated the fact that the totally badass 5second+ chanting is part of the shout duration. It doesn&#39;t matter too much if you&#39;re playing, well, legit style. But if you used mods that negate the shout cooldown period or ,like I did, remove the duration through console commands, this is annoying for two reasons.\r<br />First, which applies to both legit and cheat, is that you cannot cast spells, powers or switch to different shouts &#34;while shouting&#34;, as you&#39;re technically shouting until the chant ends.\r<br />Second, you cannot shout again &#34;while shouting&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />1) Install The Real Fus Ro Dah original mod using NMM or follow the instructions given in original mod page, selecting &#34;shout only&#34; and &#34;muted thunder&#34; (IMPORTANT). Female version is optional.\r<br />2) Download this mod and extract it to your data file in the game directory. Overwrite all files.\r<br />\r<br />How this works:\r<br />This mod contains 2 .wav files which overwrites the silent thunder effect from the other mod. Basically the thunder is replaced with silence, and the silence is replaced with the chant (if that makes any sense), while the shout duration is unchanged.\r<br />\r<br />Sorry I am unfamiliar with using mod managers of any kind, so manual installation may be required.\r<br />\r<br />Credits to xchargerfanx for the original mod.",
