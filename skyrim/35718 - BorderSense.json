Thanks!\r\n[youtube]UyWNuA7h7p8[/youtube]\r\n\r\nA very small mod that lets you know when you are near the borders of a hold.\r\n\r\nVersión en español [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41779/?]aquí[/url]! Todos [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1602430/?tb=mods&pUp=1]Aegeons[/url] granizo!\r\n\r\nRequested by daventry, may his castle never end up in a bottle.\r\nRequest thread: http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/832148-landscape-ouline/?p=6667902&fromsearch=1#entry6667902\r\n\r\n1.3 Updated Release - Bounty notifications added!\r\n\r\nThis mod notifies you when you are getting close the border of a hold, and again when you actually cross that border. Optionally notifies you of any bounty you may have in the hold you have entered.\r\n\r\nThat\\'s all.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b][u]A note on accuracy[/u]\r\nThis mod relies on the Bethesda-provided location identifiers being accurate. Some of them aren\\'t, and I\\'m fixing them as I go. \r\n\r\nIf you encounter an obviously wrong location notification, [i]please[/i] let me know by posting! I can\\'t fix it if I don\\'t know about it. You should post:\r\n[*]The nearest named location to where you got the bad message\r\n[*]Where you were in relationship to it (i.e. southwest of Ragnvald, the middle of Salvius Farm, etc)\r\n[*]What the incorrect Hold was and what it should have been\r\n[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s new?\r\n===========\r\n1.31:\r\nFixed misidentified Bethesda-provided locations that were causing inaccurate notifications:\r\n* Wilderness cell 1,-15 (SW of Riverwood near Embershard Mine) belonged to PurewaterRunLocation, changed it to None. This was pretty clearly a mistake.\r\n* HillgrundsTombLocation belonged to PaleHoldLocation, changed it to WhiterunHoldLocation. Hillgrund\\'s Tomb is pretty clearly WAY south of the Pale, and it was triggering bogus notifications when crossing the Eastmarch/Whiterun border.\r\n* SnaplegCaveLocation belonged to EastmarchHoldLocation, changed it to RiftHoldLocation. This one is a border case (yeah yeah) but since it\\'s between two locations that are definitely in the Rift and it\\'s at a much higher elevation than Eastmarch, I\\'m calling it the Rift. \r\n\r\nFixed a bug where a bounty notification would be displayed even if your bounty was 0.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Kirilov13 here at the Nexus and SJR on Steam for pointing out the bad locations!\r\n\r\n1.30:\r\nAdded optional bounty notifications (on by default).\r\n\r\nSeveral different levels of notifications have been added. \r\n* Immersive (Default) -  Tells you not only which hold you are nearing/entering, but how the player knows that (landmarks, weather, smells, vegetation, etc). \r\n* Detailed - Tells you what hold you\\'re in, and what hold you just left. Optionally, tells you which direction the border is from your location.\r\n* Basic - Minimalist notifications that tell you what hold you just entered, nothing more. When border proximity notifications are disabled, this behaves almost exactly like Oblivion\\'s location system.\r\n\r\nAdded the ability to turn off border proximity notifications, so you are only notified when you actually cross a border.\r\n\r\nCompletely rewrote much of the location detection script to be a bit more reliable, and infinitely easier to manage from a coding standpoint.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nThis mod monitor\\'s the player\\'s location and compares it to all loaded hold locations. DOES NOT require SKSE to run, but requires SkyUI/MCM (and therefore SKSE) to use the settings page.\r\n\r\nMCM\r\n====\r\nThis mod uses the SkyUI MCM. Options are available to turn on directional notifications and \r\ndisable notification sound effects.\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nUnless a mod alters or destroys the vanilla Hold Locations, it should be fine.\r\n\r\nOnly works in Tamriel. Doesn\\'t break elsewhere, just doesn\\'t work.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nSometimes the detection will be a bit off. This due to how the game keeps track of location data. Since most wilderness cells do not have a parent location, the script tries to guess where you are by looking at nearby named locations. Usually this works fine, but sometimes a location is miscategorized, which will result in the wrong hold being displayed. I have fixed this where I\\'ve found it: please report any incorrect locations and include a screenshot of your map location!\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n====\r\n* Alert you when a nearby NPC reports to a Hold other than the one you\\'re in. This is actually implemented already but disabled due to a bug.\r\n* Add support for Dragonborn/Solstheim\r\n* Possibly use SkyUI Widgets for notifications or bounty tracking\r\n* Possibly improve detection of player\\'s location.\r\n\r\nScripts\r\n=======\r\nSources are included. \r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n=======\r\n\r\n1. Extract this archive to any folder and then copy the contents to Skyrim\\'s Data folder.\r\n2. Start Skyrim, click Data Files, and enable the BorderSense.esp file.\r\n\r\nOr simply use Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the BorderSense.esp file.\r\n2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.\r\n\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\BorderSense.esp\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\BorderSense.bsa\r\n\r\nOr just use Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n=======\r\nJust overwrite everything, no problem.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n1.31, 2013/05/19 – Minor bugfixes.
