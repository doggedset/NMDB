  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/FZ4eDCb.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]--- News ---[/color][/heading]\r<br />My newest projects WIP thread can be found here:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/1335327-wip-deadly-preview-and-brainstorming]D.E.A.D.L.Y or Distinguished Essence Arrow Delivery Logistics for You.[/url]\r<br />(Final name pending)\r<br />\r<br />This mod can now be considered as finished. \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve lost the interest to improve it any further.\r<br />I hope there aren&#39;t any game breaking bugs left in it. At least I haven&#39;t found any even though I&#39;ve went through the whole dungeon and player home countless of times with pre-existing characters and fresh new ones. \r<br />\r<br />- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30435/]My follower mod[/url] now has a optional version which moves Ilatria (the co-owner of the Palace) to your new player home and considers the place her home. Change was made mainly for convenience and the mods lore in mind.\r<br />- Patch 0.93 is now out. No brighter version available. Sorry&#33;\r<br />- Note that the player home is always well lit. Dark and bright versions only define the dungeons lighting.\r<br />\r<br />Change log / known issues\r<br />- Added a new teleport spell so you can get out of the house, check the master bedroom for the tome.\r<br />- [s]Merchants in the home refuse to sell anything, this will be looked at.[/s] Fixed (they sell 23 hours a day)&#33;\r<br />- Converted the main file to ESM and added an update file (TotO_update.esp). Have both activated.\r<br />- Script of the spell is fixed\r<br />- Palace of Groizen&#39;Zor is now officially accessible&#33;\r<br />- Found an instance where Prototype wouldn&#39;t attack the player. Possible fix implemented, requires more testing.\r<br />\r<br />I didn&#39;t want to spoil it for you guys, so these are the only screenshots you&#39;re getting ;)\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]--- Requirements and Recommendations ---[/color][/heading]\r<br />Requires: The Elder Scrolls IV: Skyrim - Dawnguard DLC\r<br />I recommend: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30435/]Ilatria - Nord Female Standalone Follower[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]--- The Dungeon ---[/color][/heading]\r<br />Journey in the depths of the Tomb of the Old, a very old Nord crypt [b][u]near Riverwood[/u][/b] to start your mission. As you enter, you notice a few journals laying on the table, what&#39;s that about?\r<br />The story, background of the dungeon and what it holds will unlock as you read the journals that you find inside.\r<br />Followers will not follow you after the first part of the dungeon. This is intended. Uncovering the secrets of Groizen&#39;Zor Temple is something that you must do on your own.\r<br />The mod includes a fully furnished Dwemer themed player home in the deepest corner under Skyrim. How do you get there? Follow the story and find out&#33;\r<br />As hard the dungeon might be, the greater the reward, unlock Groizen&#39;Zor the underground Dwemer Palace to use as your home.\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]--- The House ---[/color][/heading]\r<br />The player house is located deep within the earths crust and is only accessible through completing the dungeon.\r<br />Groizen&#39;Zor Palace is well hidden from the outside world, it&#39;s fully follower compatible, contains every crafting station and a lot of storage space&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The palace includes several rooms. Temple area, main lounge, room for a possible house-carl, master bedroom, crafting lounge that also has it&#39;s own bar, barmaid and a fence that enjoys the safety that your home provides. And like all great palaces, there&#39;s a bathing hall. The bathing hall is huge, features deep enough water to swim in, a jumping platform near the ceiling, two bathing beauties and more mead than you could ever drink&#33; And what&#39;s a home without it&#39;s own garden? Groizen&#39;Zor palace has it&#39;s own little ecosystem inside a cave with lots of herbs for you to pick up, it&#39;s also connected to your home&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod was originally started as a player home for my own use, but has since developed into something much more. \r<br />\r<br />Explore and find all that the palace has to offer (read: treasure)&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=red]--- &#33; WARNING &#33; ---[/color][/heading]\r<br />This dungeon is very hard and very dark. Bring torches, a high level and well equipped character&#33; Designed for those who do not find challenge in the vanilla game anymore.\r<br />(A brighter version now available in optional files&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]--- Installation ---[/color][/heading]\r<br />1. Use NMM\r<br />2. or Install manually by extracting the contents of the RAR-archive (two files) in to your SkyrimData folder \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]--- Credits ---[/color][/heading]\r<br />Thanks to Ghaunadaur for the script to make Palace Merchants inventory to reset&#33;\r<br />Biggest thanks to Bethesda for creating the immensely epic game and of course for releasing Creation Kit for us modders to use&#33;\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4825044/?]mysticentity[/url] and The Creation Kids for the beautiful &#39;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?]Forever Free[/url]&#39; logo",
