  "descriptionHtml": "Dragon Priest Mask Journal\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a journal called \\\"Dragon Priest Findings and Conjectures\\\" in the hand of the skeleton where the Wooden Mask is found in Labyrinthian. It is a collection of notes written by the dead Breton who was searching for clues regarding the Dragon Priest masks. It provides a little back story and includes descriptions of locations where the Dragon Priest masks are suspected to be.\r\n\r\nSince the masks aren\\'t part of any quest, you really have no idea where to start looking for them, once you find one. I never found them all on my first character and I only found them all on my second character by looking them up on uesp.net. This way, you now have a more immersive and lore friendly method of actively seeking out the Dragon Priest masks. Some of the notes may be spoilerish. If they\\'re too spoilerish, let me know and I\\'ll see about revising them.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nChange log:\r\n\r\n1.0 - Dragon Priest Mask Journal mod released\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\n\r\n1.
