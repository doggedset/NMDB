  "descriptionHtml": "This is an enb Palette that I use with Ultra Performance ENB- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41180/?\r<br />Now tested with Gameplay Performance ENB (see screenshots)\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53100/?\r<br />If you want it to look like the screenshots then use either enb but you can use it with any other if you have a preferred one. \r<br />\r<br />Feel free to download the Alpha or the Beta (alpha not tested on GP-ENB) my ini file is not required so you can use one you already have it&#39;s just there for your game to look like the Beta Screenshots\r<br />\r<br />WARNING:\r<br />There is one glitch i cannot fix at the moment as Markarth looks a bit too bright (It&#39;s nothing serious i just don&#39;t like it, could just be me though), please tell me if you are having this issue and know how to fix it so i can update the mod\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />Drop the palette into your skyrim folder, not the data folder. You must have an ENB installed for this to work&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Please Read:\r<br />This is a work in progress and the first time i have ever tried to create a mod suggestions are much preciated and i take them all into account.\r<br />I will try and expand this into its own ENB in the future so keep an eye on this, thanks to all who download &lt;3\r<br />Any picture titled as &#39;Beta&#39; is the newest Version, Without a title is the Alpha download.\r<br />I Recommend you install the Ultra Performance ENB and my custom .ini file if you want the results to look the same\r<br />(I think the first 2 screenshots were before i fixed the lighting with the ini file so that might be what the game looks like without the ini file depending on your settings already though of course)",
