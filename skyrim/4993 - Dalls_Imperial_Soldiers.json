  "descriptionHtml": "---README---\r\n\r\nfor DALLs - Imperial_Soldiers\r\n\r\nv1.2\r\n\r\n05/05/2012\r\n\r\nImperial_Soldiers is arms n armor custom re-texturing (n not simple - in part - recolor) mod which changes how game Imperials (Army) and their weapons look.*\r\n\r\n* Word of warning - my work actually do changes how these items look - rather then \\\"polishes\\\" same / boring game \\\"apple\\\" a bit further as many other popular mods do - so it might not be fit for casual modders or more-of-same seekers.\r\n\r\nWhy my game textures look as they do: All textures I make are closer to original game Art / Game Art concept (short of some minor technical n aesthetic changes) then are those you have in your game. How is that possible? If you know process of texture (game Art) making that will be obvious but if you don\\'t it will suffice to say that this process (like any other) has various stages which serve different purposes. Brilliantly done - Original Art in game is \\\"covered\\\" in \\\"immersion\\\" grime n dirt probably out of necessity - as quite lot users / potential game buyers insist on low-key (dark) games - which they (users) find as more interesting / much more \\\"realistic\\\" (immersive). So if you want to \\\"see\\\", what you think is there you better avoid my re-texture mods - on other hand if you want to see what original Artists and I have (really) done there - go for them. ;)\r\n\r\nRegardless of your opinion and personal preferences in Skyrim - Imperial soldiers are unavoidable. Unfortunately they are - as regular \\\"Army\\\" - pretty ill equipped and in reality they look little bit better then brigands and lowly bandits. Armor n weapon models used are of quite reasonable quality but textures that \\\"grace\\\" these models (officer steel) are the worst I have seen in quite while - read absolute nightmare to work on but as that \\\"small n insignificant\\\" part is - probably ;) - of no consequence to most of you - lets move to what this mod brings-in your game.\r\n\r\n1/ Full Imperial (Officer) M/F Steel armor set - one you can make / use\r\n2/ Light n Medium (Imperial troopers standard gear) M/F armor sets\r\n3/ three helmets (full-face, heavy/officer n medium) - medium one can be crafted \r\n4/ two shields (steel/officer n trooper) - steel/officer one can be crafted\r\n5/ Imperial bow (new look - same model) - can be crafted\r\n6/ and (finally) Imperial Army\\'s trademark - Imperial Gladius (Legionaries short - sword) with matching (new look) scabbard - can be crafted\r\n\r\nBeside these new textures, there are some (Imperial) helmet-swap meshes as optional extra. If installed - medium helmet becomes light one - while heavy/officer one becomes regular (can be used by PC) - medium helmet. Officer helmet and full-face one are unchanged.\r\n\r\nTo install you need to navigate to your Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim - game folder and paste / drag n drop in it my Data (mod) folder. Allow overwrite!    \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like this new look, simply delete / remove my (check for names my mod) texture files from Data/textures/armor/imperial and Data/textures/weapons/imperial after that original look will be restored to your game. Meshes (if used) can be found\r\nData/meshes/armor/imperial.\r\n\r\nBugs/conflicts: none known - but take care not to overwrite them by accident!\r\n  \r\nUse:\r\nFree to use but if any files included (therein) are to be used for modding ask me for permission!\r\n\r\nNote on v1.1: Some minor changes - two new armor sets (M/F light and medium) n Imperial / Iron bow were added. This lot completes my Imperials - their remake.\r\n\r\nNote on v1.2: Imperial (CW) full-face helmet added. Its omission from previous set/s was due to simple fact that I have not seen it in my game - so it was not included. Civil War Imperial soldiers will look much better with this new / improved version.   \r\n\r\nEnjoy and try to remember - if you like it even in a part - to give endorsement! \r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for really great game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
