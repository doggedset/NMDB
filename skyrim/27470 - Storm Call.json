  "descriptionHtml": "The Storm Call shout will now target only hostiles. The only disadvantage is the enemy has to be hostile before you cast it but at least there is no friendly fire.\r\n\r\n\\\"when casting the spell it will \\\"stagger\\\" everyone within 100 feet, im looking into changing this, if you notice even tho it attacks everyone initialy the lightning itself doesnt hit the \\\"staggered\\\" enemys. The only solution to this is not to use it when around anything that turns hostile in one hit or walking far enough away casting the spell and then moving in after. Like i said ive noticed and am looking in to fixing it. \\\"",
