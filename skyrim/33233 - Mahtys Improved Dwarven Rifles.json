  "descriptionHtml": "Disclaimer:\r<br />I only made crafting adjustments and grammar changes to Mahtys Dwarven Rifle mod. Found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22545\r<br />I have no knowledge of scripts or how this mod works, I merely made adjustments using the Creation Kit. If you find a script-related bug, I can&#39;t help you, check the original mod page.\r<br />\r<br />YOU NEED DAWNGUARD INSTALLED OR YOUR GAME WILL CTD&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />You do NOT need the original mod installed for this mod to work. If you do, you will be prompted to replace all the files of either this mod or the original.\r<br />\r<br />I have no idea what would happen if you installed the Automatic Crossbows mod\r<br />\r<br />This mod changes the crafting recipes and names of the weapons and ammo made by Mahty. I have also made each rifle different, having strengths and weaknesses. Each rifle, and its ammo are found in the &#34;Dwarven&#34; category, and require the Dwarven Smithing perk to craft, and can be improved with dwarven ingots. Note, the ingredients list is quite long, however, I believe it is worth it, it also gives a use to all that dwarven scrap metal.\r<br />\r<br />The Dwarven Rifle (originally dwarvenrifleB) is a default rifle, no special bonuses or disadvantages.\r<br />Here is the list of ingredients:\r<br />-3 Dwarven Ingots\r<br />-2 Iron Ingots\r<br />-2 Dwemer Scrap Metal\r<br />-2 Dwarven Oil\r<br />-1 Dwemer Gear\r<br />-1 Dwemer Lever\r<br />-1 Dwemer Cog\r<br />-1 Dwemer Dagger\r<br />\r<br />The next rifle is the Dwarven Rifle 2.0 (formerly dwarvenrifleA) this is the much better dwarven rifle, having much better damage, and is slightly heavier\r<br />Here is the crafting list:\r<br />-5 Dwarven Ingots\r<br />-3 Dwarven Oil\r<br />-3 Dwemer Scrap Metal\r<br />-2 Iron Ingots\r<br />-3 Dwemer Gears\r<br />-2 Dwemer Cog\r<br />-2 Dwemer Gyro\r<br />-1 Dwemer Lever\r<br />-1 Dwarven Dagger\r<br />-1 Centurion Dynamo Core\r<br />\r<br />The third rifle is the Dwarven Sniper Rifle (was dwarvenrifle) this rifle is very heavy, but has a higher damage, not as high as the Dwarven Rifle 2.0.\r<br />Here is the crafting list:\r<br />-3 Dwarven Ingots\r<br />-3 Dwarven Oil\r<br />-3 Dwemer Gears\r<br />-2 Iron Ingots\r<br />-2 Dwemer Scrap Metal\r<br />-2 Dwemer Cogs\r<br />-1 Dwemer Lever\r<br />-1 Large Dwemer Plate Metal\r<br />\r<br />Finally, the last rifle is called the Dwarven Quick-Shot Rifle (previously called dwarvenrifleS) this is your up close and personal rifle, it is light, but deals low amounts of damage.\r<br />Here is the crafting list:\r<br />-5 Dwarven Oil\r<br />-3 Dwarven Ingots\r<br />-3 Dwemer Gears\r<br />-2 Iron Ingots\r<br />-2 Dwemer Scrap Metal\r<br />-2 Dwemer Levers\r<br />-2 Dwemer Cogs\r<br />-1 Dwarven Dagger\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The dwarven bullets are also implemented. 1 Dwarven ingot will give 24 bullets, and 24 bullets with 3 of the corresponding salt (Fire Salt, Frost Salt, Void Salt) will give 24 of the exploding bullets\r<br />\r<br />You can see the rifles in the uploaded picture, taken from the original mod page, the top rifle is the sniper rifle, the 2nd is the Dwarven Rifle 2.0, the 3rd is the default Dwarven Rifle, the last is the Dwarven Quick-Shot Rifle.\r<br />\r<br />Installing:\r<br />Simply &#34;Download with Manager&#34; and activate. Load order shouldn&#39;t be an issue.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstalling:\r<br />You should simply be able to uninstall the mod in the manager or deleting the files from your data folder. If you wan&#39;t to be really safe, drop all the rifles and ammo outside a building, enter the building, save and quit, then uninstall from the manager.\r<br />\r<br />Version History:\r<br />1.2\r<br />-Changed the speeds so the rifles actually run at the right speed.\r<br />\r<br />1.1\r<br />-Swapped the meshs of the Dwarven Rifle and Dwarven Sniper Rifle\r<br />-Increased the Sniper Rifles damage to 40\r<br />-Edited crafting lists\r<br />\r<br />1.0\r<br />-Initial Release\r<br />\r<br />Feedback is appreciated, please take into consideration this is only an adjustment of a mod I didn&#39;t create, and its my first mod.",
