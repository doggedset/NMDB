  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Verdana][size=2]This is a small mod that I made for personal use, played with it for a long while and decided to share, because why not. Requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64798/]Campfire[/url]﻿, as well as the dlcs.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14645]SSE conversion by kfroguar could be found here[/url].[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64798][center][img]http://i.imgur.com/kPyl4AD.png[/img]﻿[/center][/url][font=Verdana][size=2]\n<br />\n<br />Ever wondered could there be non-alcoholic lore friendly drinks? What else people could drink to keep warm on a usual Skyrim day?\n<br />It is time to have some tea (or coffee).\n<br />\n<br />There are different types of teas made from different mountain flowers: blue, red and purple.\n<br />Coffee could be made from elves ears.\n<br />Dragonborn support: make ash tea from ingredients easy to find on Solstheim (ash creep cluster and trama root).\n<br />Mix tea or coffee with honey, milk, lavender or frost mirriam. Or just add some coffee to your morning flin.\n<br />There is an extra sweet drink with more honey than tea, and there are several ways to make a hot beverage from wine, ale or mead by adding herbs and berries.\n<br />There is also a special tea, that many people would find bitter, but it could be helpful for your voice.\n<br />\n<br />I tried to keep the effects and names more or less lore friendly and appropriate for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281/]Requiem[/url]. There is only one craftable drink that would directly restore health, and it does that for a reason (all drinks are based off real life examples).\n<br />\n<br />In order to start making drinks you can create yourself a teapot (in a forge) from a 'Rusty old teapot' (can be bought from a pawnbroker, such as Belethor, or found in containers with miscellaneous items, I sometimes found them in crates from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32448/]Dynamic Things - Woodpiles and Barrels[/url]﻿) and two corundum inglots.\n<br />\n<br />You can place your teapot anywhere.\n<br />\n<br />Besides adding those drinks I also made one minor change to existing ones:\n<br />\n<br />Riften specials are now indeed special, pricy, with unique, powerful and equally dangerous effects. They are no longer in a 'potion' section, they are legitimate drinks.\n<br />Other than that, vanilla records are untouched, so compatibility should be fine.\n<br />\n<br />It seems that [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52248/]Legacy of the Dragonborn[/url]﻿ (and I suppose any other mod) would easily overwrite these changes, so choose it for yourself: whichever mod loads last takes priority. Other functions do not suffer in the slightest.\n<br />\n<br />All the drinks could be found on defeated foes, in shops, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12977/]traveling merchants[/url]' [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73186/]supply[/url], somebody's pockets... Basically anywhere you would've expected.\n<br />\n<br />If you use other mods which add things into the leveled lists, it's always better to make a [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1840/]Bashed patch[/url]﻿.\n<br />\n<br />In [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88459]Deithwen - Family Edition[/url] 2.0 I added two options to craft drinks from this mod in the house's kitchen (with and without extra, not so lore friendly ingredients). Check it out if you want to settle down.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281/]Requiem[/url] 2.0 introduced it's own consumable water, so I made a tiny patch (now in order to create boiled water you'll need Requiem's bottled water). You can run them both without a patch, it's just for making things more difficult, lol.\n<br />\n<br />For detailed recipes and effects check '[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88619?tab=images]Images[/url]' section. Note that in Requiem drinks would obey food rules like any other and only work out of combat (not the special ones however, but their price more than balanced that out).\n<br />\n<br />And boiled water does restore a little stamina, it just doesn't show up in menu (usual thing when the value is less than one).\n<br />\n<br />Also added a miscellaneous file without edits to vanilla Riften specials (esp only, overwrite the main file). Don't install it on a save where you had a version with edits installed, that sounds like a bad idea.[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/thumbnails/65163-1-1430165136.png[/img]﻿[/center][/font]\n<br />[font=Verdana][size=2]\n<br />[b]Requires [/b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64798/]Campfire[/url].\n<br />[u][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163/]Frostfall[/url] support[/u]: beverages warm you right up.
