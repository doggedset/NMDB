Introduction\r\n2: WARNING\r\n3. Version History\r\n\r\n===============\r\n1. INTRODUCTION\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Nordic Armor that you can get from the Skyforge at the end of the Companions quest seemed... lackluster to me.  The Skyforge churned out above-par steel weapons beforehand (Elven tier damage, Steel weight), and then we get... crummy ancient nord swords and armor.\r\n\r\nThis mod aims to correct the armor at least, boosting up its armor rating to Orcish tier.\r\n\r\nIt does require the Daedric Smithing perk to get the full potential of crafting, however.  I am still investigating how to change that.  Maybe to Orcish or Advanced Armors tier.\r\n\r\n==========\r\n2. WARNING\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThis was created using TESSnip in Fallout Mod Manager.  Since it\\'s pretty much hex editing, this may cause issues since it was not authored using the (as yet) unreleased Creation Kit.  Use at your own risk, I will not be held responsible if it goes kaput.\r\n\r\n==================\r\n3. VERSION HISTORY\r\n==================\r\n\r\nv1: \r\nInitial Release.",
