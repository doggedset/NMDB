  "descriptionHtml": "After playing skyrim and downloading so many mods i decided to make my own first mod XD. Here it is, the Dino Jack Virus. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Descriptions:[/b] \r<br />Dino Jack Virus is a summoning spell which will summon Dino Jack, a selfreplicating argonian virus. When first summoned, near enemies he&#39;ll replicate himself and the replicates will do so as well. Each replicate will have a random armor, weapons and combat style. These are: Unarmed combat, close combat and ranged combat. The Dino Jack Spell Tome can be crafted at any crafting forge but requires the skill Arcane Blacksmith. It can be found under the daedric smith craft. \r<br />\r<br />[b]About Dino Jack[/b] \r<br />Dino Jack has no relationships or factions which means he (or his replicates) could attack you as well, so don&#39;t bug him ;-). He can be summoned for 60 seconds. During this time he is invulnerable (and his replicates to). When his time is out he&#39;ll fall and the replicates will follow like domino. \r<br />Dino Jack will appeare unarmed so he&#39;ll run towards the enemy, mostly after using he&#39;s voice power. \r<br />\r<br />[b]About the replicates[/b] \r<br />The replicates are not bound to you&#33; They&#39;re only bound to the one summoned him or her, which means there neutral against you. They&#39;ll just help their summoner. If you attack them they&#39;ll fight back. \r<br />\r<br />Dino Jack and his replicates can only replicate themselves once, with a 5% chance of not having this ability and sometimes they just won&#39;t replicate if they&#39;re to busy in combat. Dino Jack (and his replicates) will summon one of the following: \r<br />\r<br />Dino Jack Unarmed \r<br />Dino Jack Armed \r<br />Dino Jack Heavy Armed \r<br />Dino Jack Archer \r<br />Dino Gem Unarmed \r<br />Dino Gem Armed \r<br />Dino Gem Heavy Armed \r<br />Dino Gem Archer \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Unarmed ones will have a enchanted ring that fortifys unarmed damage. \r<br />Armed means they&#39;ll have ramdomly 2 one-handed daedric or nordic weapons except daggers. \r<br />Heavy Armed one&#39;s will have two-handed daedric or nordic weapons or the real ebony blade. \r<br />Archers will have either a dwarven, ebony, nordic or daedric bow with daedric arrows which explode with either fire, frost or shock. \r<br />\r<br />All weapons have the same enchantment but they do not ignore resistance. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements[/b] \r<br />Requieres the lates version of Skyrim, Heartfires DLC, Dragonborn DLC, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11990/]Bingles Colorful Armory[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14113/]Bingles Glass Splinter Armor[/url]. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Recommended[/b] \r<br />Since I&#39;ve made and tested this mod alongside with mods that increase the difficulty of NPCs anykind I recommend to use: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3829]3jiou&#39;s Dealdy Dragons with Deadly Monsters [/url]or any other mod that increases the difficulty of dragons and/or creatures. \r<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation[/b] \r<br />Just use the NMM for this.
