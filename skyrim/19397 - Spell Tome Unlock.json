  "summary": "Allows spell tomes to be purchased at any time",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod allows adept and expert spell tomes, which you are normally only allowed to purchase once you reach a certain skill level, to be purchased at any time. You\\'ll still need to complete the relevant quests to obtain the master level tomes. I felt the fact that the spells cost twice as much until you obtain sufficient levels to get the perks was restrictive enough.\r\n\r\n[b]Important Note[/b]\r\nThe effect of this mod on a saved game is [b]permanent[/b], even if you later remove the mod, since it simply tells the game you\\'re allowed to buy the tomes the first time it\\'s run.\r\n\r\n[b]Known bugs/conflicts[/b]\r\nNone\r\n\r\n[b]Compatibility[/b]\r\nThis mod only adds content and as such should be compatible with anything. Any mods which add tomes to the relevant levelled lists should also have those tomes unlocked.",
