  "summary": "Become a vampire from the start. dont waste time beating quests or fighting vampires to get the disease, when you can just use the race! :D",
  "descriptionHtml": "Instead of beating dark brotherhood quest, or going to find a vampire to catch the disease, you can just pick the race. Also, this way you get enhanced stamina from the start, and you dont recieve sun damage like you would if you did the quests or caught the disease. Just download the file, and either place it in the data folder, or just use the nexus mod manager( which I recommend). Ten you will have the Vampire race :D. ENJOY!\r\n\r\nDOWNLOAD FOR DIFFERENT HAIR: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168",
