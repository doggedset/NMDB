(Else Game Crashes) (Only need to do it once if you keep loading that save).\r\n\r\n- To use the dragon shouts, simply go to your shout menu, look for the [Dragon] shouts and equip them.\r\n\r\n- To Change back, use the curse shout while on ground. (Not flying.)\r\n\r\n- If you get stuck with the flying, re-load your save or type on console ( player.pa actionflystop ).\r\n\r\n- Landing currently has a bug and it will teleport you to the center of the world.\r\n\r\n- At the moment, disable any other dragon mods that mess with the race. My mod isn\\'t compatible yet. Im working now on it to make it so.\r\n\r\n- To fly, you need to have your \\\"weapons\\\" on, just press once with mouse1 (attack) and if the dragon attacks you can fly.(Fixing the bug too).\r\n\r\n\r\nControls :\r\n\r\nMouse2 : Mouth Attack (no damage.)\r\nMouse1 : Tail Attack / Landing \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================\r\n =====  How to Fly : =====\r\n======================\r\n\r\nFirst check if your in control of the dragon (the dragon turns with your mouse). If you aren\\'t just press mouse1 or mouse2 to \\\"equip\\\". Once thats done follow the following steps : (The dragon wont fly untill your sure its in control).\r\n\r\nEquip the [Fly] Shout and use it once. The Dragon will takeoff. Then once you want to land just use the shout again.\r\nDO NOT PRESS R IN THE MIDDLE OF A FLIGHT/LANDING/TAKINGOFF.\r\nOnce you land just press F5 and F9 (Once the warning shows).\r\nShould work just fine.\r\n\r\nIf you can\\'t Fly at all, check for other mods that mess with the dragon race and disable them :).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n============== To do List (Incomplete) =================\r\n\r\n[X] FLYING [BETA]\r\n[X] Better Head Control.
