  "descriptionHtml": "Mirkwood\r\n\r\nMirkwood is a two in one home with shared storage between the two homes.  Mirkwood is located in Skyrim and Solstheim and since it uses shared storage what you place in one home is available in the other.  The interior in both homes is almost identical so if you place something into one container you will easily know where it is in the other home.  Although all containers use shared storage the mannequins and weapon plaques in each home are unique.  There are 4 mannequins in each home so you can have 4 sets of armor displayed in Skyrim and another 4 displayed in Solstheim.  The same applies to the weapon plaques.\r\n\r\nMirkwood is also companion friendly and can be fast traveled to immediately.  It is fully navmeshed and has everything most adventurers will need.  The clutter is static so you don't have to worry about knocking items around.  \r\n\r\nMirkwood in Skyrim is located on the river between Anga's Mill and Bronze Water Cave.\r\nMirkwood in Solstheim is located North-East of Thirsk Mead Hall and can easily be seen from there. \r\n\r\nThis mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit.      \r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n- Two homes in two locations with the same interior and shared storage.\r\n- Fully navmeshed.\r\n- All crafting stations.\r\n- 8 Mannequins (4 in each home).\r\n- 8 Weapon Plaques (4 in each home).\r\n- Plenty of safe and shared storage.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\nDragonborn DLC\r\nSkyrim Patch 1.9.32.0.8\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nJust copy Mirkwood.esp into your Skyrim\\Data\\ folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n\r\nJust delete Mirkwood.esp from your Skyrim\\Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate Info:\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 just adds 4 more chests and 2 other containers near the cooking spit.",
