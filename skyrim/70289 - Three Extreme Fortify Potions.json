There are Three Potions included in this mod. They are Extreme Fortify Restoration, Extreme Fortify Smithing, and Extreme Fortify Alchemy. Each potion has a duration of 60 minutes, so no need to rush around like if you were doing the restoration glitch. I&#39;ve added a chest to Breezehome upstairs in the loft. It has 1000 of each potion",
