Yaasir\r\n\r\n Somewhat skimpy for female characters. turns out it\\'s better looking than I thought.\r\n\r\n I should also mention version 0.1 is based of the vanilla game bodies.\r\n\r\n while you\\'re reading this, check out the awesome pictures posted by gin4ex\r\nin the user contributed section.\r\n\r\n[size=4]Installation[/size]\r\n\r\n Extract meshes folder and all contents to your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n That\\'s about it for this first version.\r\n \r\n[size=4]Notes[/size]\r\n \r\n This mod does not modify game textures, so no need for those. You\r\n can use alternative textures from other mods for the armour or body\r\n if you like.\r\n \r\n Weight Slider works. So it is safely equipable by all females PC and NPC. \r\n \r\n\r\n== Version History ==\r\n 0.2\r\n  - cbbe version available at http://www.nbnakama.com/gamemods/skyrim/somewhat-skimpy-dragonscale-armour/v0.2/\r\n 0.1\r\n  - initial release.\r\n  - there might be some minor clipping here and there.\r\n  - to do: CBBE version.",
