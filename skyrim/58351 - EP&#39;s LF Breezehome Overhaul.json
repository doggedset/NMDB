  "summary": "This is a Lore-Friendly (LF) overhaul for the Breezehome.  Adds a basement, enchanter, weapon and armor crafting and upgrading stations, display cases, mannequins, decorations, and sooooo much more&#33;&#33;&#33;  ",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was tired of how the Breezehome was laid out.  No Enchanting Table, no mannequins, crates under the stair well, items not placed correctly, lack of light upstairs, and so on.  This mod cleans everything up, adds items, and adds an entirely new basement level.  Everything is done in a lore friendly way that makes the Breezehome keep its small, yet cozy feel unlike other mods out there.  [u]Please read installation instructions.[/u] \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />To get all of your furnishings, just talk to the steward in Dragonsreach and purchase the upgrades.  Added new values...\r<br />Basement Furnishings (1000)\r<br />Enchanting Laboratory (750)\r<br />Crafting Stations (750) &lt;-Armor and weapons\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][u]Info:[/u][/i][/b]\r<br />I changed many things.\r<br />\r<br />The most notable changes are... \r<br />- A basement.\r<br />- Added an Enchanting Table.\r<br />- Added an armory\r<br />- Added a few mannequins and display cases to show off your armor/waepons.\r<br />- Added a more weapon racks to show off your cool weapons.\r<br />- Added more storage such as shelves, book cases, a safe, chests, and etc.  \r<br />- I moved a few things around to make it look more realistic, less cluttered, and less like a storage unit.  \r<br />- I also added some more decorations so it feels more like a home.\r<br />- A few bug fixes.\r<br />- A LOT MORE LITTLE TWEAKS&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][u]ETC:\r<br />[/u][/i][/b]- Everything has been properly NavMeshed.  Companion and follower friendly.\r<br />- Mod cleaned and optimized with TESVEdit.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][b][u]READ INSTALATION INSTRUCTIONS[/u][/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]You will [u]NOT[/u] lose anything that you currently have stored in the Breezehome.[color=rgb(255,255,255)]  I made sure not to delete any storage items that were in the vanilla Breezehome.  If you had books stored in that shelf on the right when you first walk in, you will find the books scattered on the ground (This will only happen once; Just pick them up).  Its a stupid bug that I don&#39;t now how to fix.  Sorry about the trouble.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=rgb(255,255,255)]This mod also goes perfectly with[/color] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57898/?][b][size=3]Breezehome Front Porch - A Simple Little Add-On[/size][/b][/url][/color][color=rgb(255,255,255)].  It adds a front porch to the Breezehome.  \r<br />\r<br />[/color][u][i][b]Requirements:[/b][/i][/u] \r<br />- Latest version of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />[u][i][b]Installation:[/b][/i][/u] \r<br />Use nexus or manually drop the file into your &#34;Data&#34; folder.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]WARNING: [/color][color=rgb(255,255,255)]If you have the Hearthfire DLC installed, please use the Hearthfire compatible file.  If you don&#39;t use the compatible file, and you have the Hearthfire DLC, your game will crash when you enter the Breezehome.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[b][i][u]Compatibility:[/u][/i][/b] \r<br />- Compatible with all mods that do not affect the interior of the Breezehome.\r<br />- [u]For those of you with the Hearthfire DLC, please read the installation instructions.[/u]\r<br />- [size=1]If you are using my other mod,[/size] [size=2] [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57357/?][b][size=2]A Simple Little Clean Up - Breezehome[/size][/b][/url][size=2] [size=1], please replace it with this mod.  I am discontinuing it because it is an older version of this mod.  I will make it available if you do not want to add the basement.  However, it does not make all of the other changes that I have done to the rest of the Breezehome since this release.  Do not use both together. \r<br />\r<br />[/size][/size]\r<br />[b] [/b]\r<br />[u][i][b]Known Issue(s):[/b][/i][/u]\r<br />- There are no known serious issues with this mod.\r<br />- There is a small bug that prevents the Steward from showing how much the upgrades cost.\r<br />- [size=1]First Use:\r<br />When you first use this mod, there is a CHANCE you will find some stuff just lying on the ground.  This just means that your character moved the item(s) before the mod was installed and the game rendered another where it was supposed to be.  Also, if you had books stored in the bookshelf on the right when you first walk in, you may notice that they are all on the ground.  If this happens, just pick them up and do whatever you want with them.  [u]It will NOT happen again[/u].  Its an annoying little bug that I don&#39;t know how to fix.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][u]Uninstallation:[/u][/i][/b]\r<br />AAAWWWWW....if you have to, take all of your items out of the storage containers that I added to the game and then remove the .esp file from the &#34;Data&#34; folder or uninstall with nexus.  If your don&#39;t remove the items from the containers I added and you uninstall this mod, you will loose those items. \r<br />\r<br />[size=3][size=3][size=2][color=#00ff00]And, as always, thank you for looking/downloading...  If you like my work, please remember to check out some of my other mods [size=2] [/size][/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/8497898/?tb=mods&pUp=1][size=4][b]Here[/b][/size][/url][size=2] [/size] :)[/size][/size][/size]",
