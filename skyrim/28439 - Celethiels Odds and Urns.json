  "descriptionHtml": "I created some time ago and Odd\\'s and Ends mod\r\nthis is the dressed down version that doesn\\'t include things I added for experiment sake.\r\nWhat you are now able to pick up\r\nDwemer Urns\r\nDwemer Pots\r\nOars\r\nForks\r\nKnives\r\nAnd Glazed Urns\r\n\r\nIt\\'s actually rather easy to make, as all that they did was not name the items and then you can\\'t pick them up.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also made some of these Items (ie the forks and knives) worth a tiny bit more, i never understood how an item can be worthless. If someone is willing to buy it, and not make it themselves it\\'s worth something to them, and to shopkeepers who obviously aren\\'t making forks themselves...\r\nI seriously doubt I will make a mod that overhauls the price charts on all items though.\r\n~~~~\r\nObviously since It does many of the same things as the previous Mod, Celethiel\\'s Things the two are not compatible.",
