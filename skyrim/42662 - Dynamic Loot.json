Tired of leveling up Enchanting just to survive enemies&#39; spells, or to be able to cast a few more spells before your magicka runs out? Well no more&#33; This mod aims to expand existing loot with pre-enchanted armors and weapons. Currently Dynamic Loot adds over 1000 pre-enchanted armors to your enemies at runtime through scripts.[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=3][color=#FFFF99]Assorted add-ons are available, thanks to jlizard.

[u]Armor drop rates[/u] settings have two sliders:  for &#34;rare&#34; armors which hold two enchantments on them, and for &#34;epic&#34; armors which have 3 enchantments. [u]Weapons drop rate[/u] determines the probability that your enemies will get (and most likely, use) an enchanted weapon. At this time, most weapons are vanilla items, but more weapons with custom enchantments will probably be added in future versions. This depends on your feedback only. The [u]Drop Rates: Other[/u] settings expand the loot even further; here you can set the chance to find alchemy ingredients, potions, raw food, etc. on corpses.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/42662-1-1381912815.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />The [u]Preferences[/u] tab controls which type of enemies can drop certain items. Currently, you can enable or disable certain type of items for humanoids (this includes NPCs of all playable races), animals (bears, skeevers, wolves, etc), dwemer mechanisms, and monsters (including dragons, trolls, falmer, etc.).[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/42662-2-1379788204.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b][size=3]Note:[/size] This mod does not use or modify the leveled lists in Skyrim, so it should have no conflicts with mods that do.  There are no known conflicts.[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]NEyR6w2JSyo?vq=hd720[/youtube][youtube]eBNpiJK1ILM?vq=hd720[/youtube][/center]\r<br />[line]\r<br />[b][color=#86CDFF]Any questions or bugs you find within this mod please post them in the discussion board and they will be handled and answered as time permits.[/color][/b]",
