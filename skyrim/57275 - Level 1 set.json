  "descriptionHtml": "The Problem\r<br />I am a serial character-creator.  Iwant a new character every week, it seems, just to see how the new one would play.  I rarely have the attention to play through the entire main quest yet I keep finding myself starting it over.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Incomplete (for me) solutions\r<br />I have played with Skyrim Unbound and Iloved it as an idea but then I keep wanting the main quest to be completed.  I found Skyrim Ultimate Vanilla Saves but couldn&#39;t bring myself to play them as I was too unhappy with having 8 levels already (I like a mod named Character generation which requires me to have a character below level 3 to use it) and skills all in Destruction magic.  What if I want to play as a magic-eschewing Barbarian? That doesn&#39;t fit.  There was another save set titled Skip Past High Hrothgar Clean Save.  This was a lower level so it looked great.  But\r<br />this did not satisfy me because the character was already level 4.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />My solution\r<br />So, I created a new character at thebeginning and played as a crazy Kajjit (Kajiiti...Kajjiiiit...however it is spelled) boxer named Clawra, whowears only gloves of the pugilist and some sort of clothes.  With her we charged through the game rapidly.  I accidentally got her to level\r<br />2 with speechcraft and lockpicking before I stopped doing those things.  Everything obtained on her adventure was dropped off in the\r<br />chest in Breezehome as the quest progressed.  I had to use a cheat code in Underdark to deal with those Dwemer monstrosities (though not\r<br />for dealing with any dragons).  I have saved it in 45 different instances throughout so that one could choose the best time to join in.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Mods:\r<br />I did use some mods--Hearthfire,Dragonborn, Dawnguard, all of the unofficial patches, a Zelda music mod, a dark nights and dungeons mod, a colorful Skyrim mod and maybe one or two other cosmetic mods--the bare minimum for me.  Judge for yourself if this matters for you.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />To install:\r<br />1.  Extract the save files to yourSkyrim save directory\r<br />C:&#92;users&#92;...&#92;my documents&#92;mygames&#92;skyrim&#92;save&#92;   or whatever\r<br />2.  Play Clawra or use race change tomake her someone new\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />To uninstall:\r<br />In Game:\r<br />In the save menu, select each save gamein sequence, pressing &#34;x&#34; and clicking &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;Okay&#34; or whatever it is.\r<br />Manually:\r<br />Open the directory where the games weresaved and sort them by name.  Find the games numbered and named (which should all, then, be bunched together) and delete them all.",
