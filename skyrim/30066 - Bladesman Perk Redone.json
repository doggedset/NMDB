  "summary": "So, I played alot skyrim as one hander warrior, and I got very dissapointed about the bladesman perk(critical). Now with this mod, the critical strike damage stacks with onehanded skill, and it will be much more useful in the entire game.",
  "descriptionHtml": "In vanilla the Bladesman perk only works off of the base damage of the weapon, which is a fraction of total damage at high levels. \r\nFor example:\r\nUsing a Legendary Daedric sword with 100 One-handed skill and 5/5 Armsman perk levels, you will deliver 72 damage per hit. However, base damage for a Daedric Sword is only 14; so with 3/3 Bladesman perk levels, you would have a 20% chance to cause an additional 10.5 points of damage. For reference, a critical hit with a one-handed iron sword will do an extra 3 points of damage at Bladesman perk level 1, or 4.5 damage at Bladesman level 3 (1.5x the base critical damage). For a one-handed Daedric sword, it would be 7 and 10.5, respectively. Nothing modifies these numbers, so even if you\\'re doing 300 damage per hit \\\"normally\\\", a critical hit would still only do an additional 3 to 10.5 points of damage.\r\n\r\nWhat my mod does:\r\n\r\nIt\\'s increasing the critical damage by the base damage+your skill level. So this perk will become usefull in the later stages of the game also.\r\n\r\nBase formula:\r\nlvl2 bladesman: Vanilla critical damage(for daedric sword its 7)*onehanded*0.15=105(with 100 onehanded)\r\nlvl3 bladesman: Vanilla critical damage(for daedric sword its 7)*onehanded*0.20=140(with 100 onehanded).\r\n\r\nCompability: It\\'s combatible with every mod, except the ones that modify this perk.\r\n\r\nThe only weak point right now is that i cant find a solution to modify the first step of the perk, so basically lvl 1 bladesman will stay as vanilla,but 2-3 are modified correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would gladly hear your suggestions guys. \r\n",
