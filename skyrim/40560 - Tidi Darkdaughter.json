  "summary": "Very basic and simple Dark Elf female follower",
  "descriptionHtml": "Tidi was chased out of the Underdark due to her strongly independant nature and her refusal to indulge in the sort of horrors found normal in that realm. Vaguely related to Brylana she was told to wait in Solitude at Proudspire Manor when she would be contacted.\r<br />Tidi is nothing special but she is a level 30. Her only equipment is  basic covering and an Elf Knife. So she needs equipping. Has some Magic but not a lot. Generally a happy personality but does have an independant turn of mind. Last time she was told to &#39;dismiss but hang around here&#39; she left the house and town and started wandering off god alone knows where - so be warned.\r<br />2 versions available \r<br />Version 1 as above no other files required\r<br />Version 2 Tidi will be found in the inn at Solitude. If you ask her nicely and get out of her way she will unlock most locked items (like chests). This version requires Apachii Hair 1.5 full\r<br />\r<br />This is my very first mod of any nature and I would like to take this opportunity of thanking all the forum members who helped me out with my daft questions.\r<br />\r<br />Please try her and make comments - I can&#39;t learn without sensible and constructive instruction so feel free.",
