Found under the miscellaneous category of the smithing menu.  No upgrades as they are still clothing.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />=============\r<br />Dimonized UNP body.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />=============\r<br />\r<br />Drag and drop the folders to line up with the ones in your game directory.  When prompted to overwrite, select yes.  Tick the esp in your program of choice.  [The default game loader, WryeSmash, NMM, etc]\r<br />\r<br />Addendum for the Crafting Version:\r<br />=======================\r<br />\r<br />INSTALL MAIN FILE FIRST.  Then remove the mainfile esp and use the optional instead.  \r<br />\r<br />You can probably tick on both, but it wouldn&#39;t really do much good except give you both the Belethor&#39;s shop stuff and the ability to craft them and/or cause your computer to growl at you and attempt to bite off your knees.  \r<br />\r<br />Or make you a cup of tea.  I can&#39;t really remember.  Something like that.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />===============\r<br />\r<br />Untick esp, delete meshes/Gizmodian/witchbane and textures/Gizmodian/witchbane.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />========\r<br />\r<br />Dimon99 for help.  [And because he&#39;s teh awsumsawce]\r<br />Bethesda.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Programs Used:\r<br />==============\r<br />Autodesk 3DSmax\r<br />Adobe Photoshop CS3/CS5\r<br />Nifskope\r<br />Creation Kit\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Permissions and Usage:\r<br />======================\r<br />\r<br />I require credit.  \r<br />\r<br />I like to be notified as a courtesy if you plan on using anything of mine.
