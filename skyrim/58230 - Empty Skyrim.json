  "descriptionHtml": "Removes all human-civilized npcs from the vanilla game. Makes skyrim look abandoned. Created for Frostfall, and Random Alternate Start. No merchants, npcs or walled cities. This has to be used with random alternate start or game will be unplayable. Not compatible with almost any mod that edits or adds npcs. No access to walled cities, including Whiterun, Markarth, Windhelm, Solitude, Riften. This was made specifically for testing survival builds, and I find it adds an intense feeling of stress to the game not unlike bioshock one. If you don&#39;t like it, dont use it, and don&#39;t comment because I don&#39;t give a shit. This was tailored to my personal tastes. I just want to share the feeling with others.",
