This habbit was often done in medieval \r<br />times to conseal a very important document from being read without permission. If the seal was broken, the \r<br />owner knew, someone discovered the information, which was supposed to be hidden&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Seals also were used to just make documents a valid peace of \r<br />paper, authorized by an important Institution or Authority. For example during war it was very important that \r<br />Messangers carried sealed messages with a specific logo on it to leaders of the army, so every member of the \r<br />army could identify the message as a valid order. I found it would look pretty cool to have a Seal of &#34;Forever Free&#34;\r<br />in a way that appeals very much to the medieval times and makes much sence for a sign like this.\r<br />\r<br />______________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]I want to thank mysticentity for permission to create\r<br /> a modded version of: \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?]Forever Free by [b]mysticentity and The Creation Kids\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/url][/size]Follow the link above to find out about this sign and why they created it.\r<br />______________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you want to use this mod in yours, you can do so by giving full credit to me, \r<br />[color=#ff7700]mysticentity and the Creation Kids&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[/color]You just have to ask them, not me&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />______________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />I hope you like this version as much as i do&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Best regards&#33;\r<br />Destero\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65157/?]\r<br />\r<br />[/url][/center]",
