  "descriptionHtml": "[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40615]Included in Relics of Hyrule[/url]\r<br />\r<br />&#39;&#39;Long ago, there existed a kingdom, where a golden power lay hidden. It was a prosperous land, blessed with green forests, tall mountains, and peace. But one day, a man of great evil found the golden power and took it for himself. With its strength, he commanded darkness across the kingdom. But then, when all hope had died and the hour of doom was at hand, a young boy [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36713]in green[/url] appeared as if from nowhere. Wielding [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32615]the blade of evil&#39;s bane[/url], he sealed the dark one away and gave the land light.The boy&#39;s tale was passed down through generations until it became legend. A day came when a fell wind began to blow across the kingdom. The great evil that all thought had been forever sealed away by the hero once again crept forth from the depths of the earth, eager to resume its dark designs. The people believed that the Hero of Time would again come to save them. But the hero did not appear...What became of that kingdom? None remain who know.&#39;&#39;\r<br />\r<br />This is the heavy armor version of my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36713]Hero&#39;s Clothes mod[/url], and provides the lore for both itself and the light armor version. The armor included in this mod is meant to be the armor worn by the armies of Hyrule as they tried to defend their kingdom in its darkest hour.\r<br />\r<br />The mod includes the Hero&#39;s Armor, which was forged for the Hero who never came;\r<br />Hylian Soldier&#39;s helmet and gauntlets;\r<br />Zora Soldier&#39;s armor, which allows the wearer to breathe underwater and resist frost;\r<br />Zora Scout&#39;s armor, which is a light armor version of the Zora Soldier&#39;s armor;\r<br />Heavy and Light Zora circlets which [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36429]serve as helmets[/url] and allow the wearer to breathe underwater;\r<br />Hylian Goron Armor, crafted using the knowledge of the Gorons for the soldiers of Hyrule and grants the wearer immunity to flames;\r<br />Goron Warrior Armor, crafted by the Gorons for use in battle and granting immunity to fire;\r<br />A heavy Goron Circlet which serves as a helmet and grants some resistance to fire.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: The Blades Armor mesh is flawed in that some gauntlets do not appear properly on it, causing a gap between the sleeve and the gauntlet. I cannot fix this, it&#39;s a problem with the core game.\r<br />\r<br />The Hero&#39;s Armor can be found in Blackreach and allows for you to find the Zora Soldier and then the Goron Warrior armors, which are intended to be stumbled across in other Dwarven ruins (hints below).\r<br />\r<br />Once you find the Hero&#39;s Armor and accompanying book, you can craft the Hylian Goron Armor with the book in your inventory, the Arcane Blacksmith Perk and the Ancient Knowledge effect from Unfathomable Depths. Crafting the Hylian Goron armor does not destroy the Hero&#39;s Armor.\r<br />\r<br />Once you find the Zora Soldier&#39;s armor, you can craft the Zora Scout Armor with each respective piece of armor in your inventory as well as the Arcane Blacksmith Perk and the Ancient Knowledge effect.\r<br />\r<br />For the Additional Armors, you must find the Yeti Armor [spoiler]near Snowpoint Beacon and unlock it with a key from under the Brinehammer.[/spoiler]\r<br />The chest contains the second volume of A Chronicle of War, which is required to craft the additional armors.\r<br />\r<br />All of the armors have identical recipes for crafting and tempering except for the variations below:\r<br />The Yeti Armor requires frost salts,\r<br />The Woodfall Armor requires Deathbell and Nightshade,\r<br />The Ikana Armor requires Nirnroot,\r<br />The Lanayru Armor requires void salts,\r<br />The Dark armor requires Jazbay Grapes (and must be crafted with Ectoplasm as well)\r<br />The Sheikah Armor requires Frost Mirriam (and must be crafted with Purple Mountain Flowers as well)\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s a video explaining the Hero&#39;s, Goron and Zora armors in depth:\r<br />[youtube]LIOk6CChwwA[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />There is also secret item you have a chance to find&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34718]Hylian Shield[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Future plans:\r<br />- Recipes for crafting additional sets of Yeti Armor and Goron Warrior Armor\r<br />- Distinct helmet for Goron Warrior armor\r<br />- Unique textures for Hylian soldier helmets and gauntlets\r<br />- Recipes for crafting Hylian Soldier armor (maybe)\r<br />- Fierce Deity Armor\r<br />\r<br />Version History: \r<br />June 25th, 2013 - Additional armors added, various fixes and additions\r<br />June 20th, 2013 - First Release\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Spoilers&#33;\r<br />[spoiler] The Hero&#39;s Armor is in Blackreach War Quarters. There is a small key nearby that will unlock the Heavy Chest in the Nchuand Zel Armory. The key in the Nchuand Zel Armory will unlock a Heavy Chest submerged in Tolvald&#39;s Crossing, deep within Tolvald&#39;s Cave. This chest contains the Goron Warrior Armor.[/spoiler]",
