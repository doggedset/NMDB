  "summary": "This mod changes the function of bears in Skyrim&#33;  Previously they hand around you and attack if you stay too long or get too close, now they are your allies&#33; They will not attack you and when you are being attacked they will choose to help you&#33;",

Do you like bears, just as much as I do? But then played Skyrim and thought, hey... why are bears aggressive? This is a fantasy game (so yes, I am implying that no wildlife should be aggressive, but that&#39;s irrelevant.) so bears should be your friends&#33; Well then, if you thought all of those two lines which I just typed into my computer was accurate to you then with THIS mod, right here, the one that you&#39;re looking at right now, bears can no longer be aggressive&#33; In fact, they will actually fight for you now&#33; Even if they do die relatively often, considering the power of your enemies at slightly higher levels, it&#39;s nice to have a companion that in the original game would have been an enemy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />So now I&#39;m going to list some [s]Recommended[/s] good mods that you could use with this mod that add nice additions to the game;\r<br />Actually, there&#39;s only one &#34;good mod that adds a nice addition to the game which you can potentially use with this mod&#34;, here goes...\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2809/?tab=3&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D2809]Panda Bears: By DigitalLion[/url] Aka: My favourite mod ever&#33;\r<br />Now you probably notice I don&#39;t have it on in the screenshots of this mod, that&#39;s because I&#39;m posting this mod, not that panda retexture&#33;",
