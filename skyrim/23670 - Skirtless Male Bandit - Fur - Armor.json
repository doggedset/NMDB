  "descriptionHtml": "This is a REPLACER for existing meshes/textures ... You have been \r\n\r\nwarned!\r\n\r\nA Non-Replacer version MAY be forthcoming, after I do all of the male \r\n\r\narmors in game I can.\r\n\r\nContinuing my \\\"Skirtless Male Armors\\\" theme mods\r\nHide = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23579\r\nIron = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23665\r\nNord = http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23669\r\n\r\nBasically my DOV don\\'t wear skirts!\r\n\r\nSo I decided to try and create a \\\"pants\\\" version of the male armors.\r\nWhere possible I tried to use existing textures and keep the \r\n\r\ntheme/style the same, and where not possible, I created the textures \r\n\r\nfrom scratch (like all of the normal maps!!!)\r\n\r\nThe fur armors were little easier in some ways, and a little harder in \r\n\r\nothers, mainly because the game engine for Skyrim makes creating \r\n\r\nrealistic looking \\'fur\\' very difficult to do, hopefully they don\\'t \r\n\r\nlook too bad for you. Although personally I\\'m still not 100% happy \r\n\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nThe textures are not \\\"High Def\\\" and please don\\'t ask for for a \\\"HD\\\" \r\n\r\nversion, but they are as detailed and as close to the original \r\n\r\ntextures as I can make them.\r\nIf someone wants to create a HD version, feel free.\r\n\r\nI\\'m slowly going through all the armors and, where possible, doing the \r\n\r\nsame thing, so there should be more coming, please be patient if your \r\n\r\nwant \\\"xxx\\\" armor with no skirt\r\n\r\nThese are MALE ONLY, as I feel there is already enough female variants \r\n\r\nout there, but If I get enough requests I MAY try and do something \r\n\r\nsimilar for the female version.\r\n\r\nThere may be some minor clipping errors here and there with certain \r\n\r\nanimations, I haven\\'t tested these out exhaustively in game, but in \r\n\r\nmost situations they seem to work OK\r\n\r\n!!! Again, Any bugs or major issues PLEASE let me know POLITELY, and \r\n\r\nI\\'ll try and sort them out !!!\r\n\r\nFor the SS I used vanilla assets, except I used one of the \\\"clean\\\" \r\n\r\nskin textures (can\\'t remember which one, but there aren\\'t that many \r\n\r\nfor male bodies so ...)
