  "descriptionHtml": "I just changed the height values of some of my favorite races and the werewolf. This mod will make you really, reeally tall. Try using the \\\"tgm\\\" cheat in the command console to keep from dying. This only works on the females.\r\n\r\nNOTE: you will move really fast so either have a good computer or try walking really slowly. I haven\\'t checked the compatibility of this mod with anything. It is made \\'as is\\'. Make sure when changing into a werewolf to not be around anyone. The A.I. watching you change really slows the game down if you have too many people.",
