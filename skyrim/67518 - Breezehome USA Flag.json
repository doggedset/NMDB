  "summary": "Come get the American flag today and solve your problems with Democracy&#39;s way&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "Are you feeling like a patriot but don&#39;t have the means to do so? Are you feeling a little less free while wandering around Skyrim and don&#39;t know how to fix that? What this mod does is it adds the US flag to the outside of Breezehome in Whiterun. With this flag I can guarantee you at least one of the following on the list will occur \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Feelings of freedom \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Spontaneous instances of uncontrollable shouting \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Random clapping when finishing a hearty meal \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No fear of Brittish oppression \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to aquire it in-game, you need to speak to Proventus Avenicci and purchase the living room furnishings if you haven&#39;t done so. \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If for some reason you want to use this mod in one you are working on, go ahead. Just remember that while freedom isn&#39;t free, my mod is and always will be.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, keep in mind I will not be responsible for saves that get mucked up or otherwise become overrun with dangerous amounts of tyranny. That said, this is a joke mod so don&#39;t take it too seriously. If you want you can find this mod on steam&#39;s workshop with the same title under my username smu_dude07",
