  "summary": "Four additional lore-friendly followers in Solstheim - created to provide some UFO-compatible followers on the wonderful Morrowind Island. I could not choose Frea as a follower without breaking my UFO gameplay (the author is working on it) - but you can get Skaal huntress Sveya now or her friend Jorrim, or the Dunmer Zalva and Arunh ...",

Please see screenshots.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />If you choose the SkyHair Version you don&#39;t need to download the Vanilla version, only the optional file then.\r<br />Their look also depends on the body replacers and facial textures you use (if at all) - you can find the mods that I have in use listed further below. \r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Some background:\r<br />\r<br />When I reached the point in the Dragonborn DLC questline where I could get Frea as a follower I had to learn that this doesn&#39;t work (then) together with the great follower mod UFO. And disabling UFO made my other followers (which I had left &#34;relaxing&#34; in Skyrim) pop up out of nowhere in Solstheim, so I decided better not to interrupt my UFO gameplay - or wait until the problem is fixed - and rather install some Solstheim followers myself.\r<br />They are created according to Blackie&#39;s tutorial &#34;CM Creating Custom Companions&#34; and will work just like normal custom followers (no special scripts or voices), but you can get them at once in Solstheim as UFO-compatible followers.\r<br />\r<br />I wanted them to be as lore-friendly and Solstheim-matching as possible - and share them with you now that they are ready to go adventuring ...\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />More details:\r<br />\r<br />The followers come with some perks because playing with &#34;Mighty Dragons&#34; and &#34;SkyrimMonsterMod&#34; (as I do) demands strong companions.\r<br />They are &#34;essential&#34; by default, marriable, and will level from level 10-80 with the player.\r<br />Both Skaal followers have a &#34;no crime&#34; morality whereas the Dunmer will commit any crime you ask them to.\r<br />And they build good teams - see the screenshots&#33;\r<br />(As far as I know followers won&#39;t use spells to heal others but I added them anyhow. Maybe this will work some day, and it feels more complete.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][u] Sveya Talking-Tree [/u][/color]\r<br />Nord, Skaal Village, Great Hall\r<br />Stats/Skills: Archery, Light Armor, Sneak, Alteration, One-Handed, (Restoration)\r<br />Spells: RaceNord, PowerNordBattleCry, Oakflesh, Stoneflesh, Healing, Healing Hands, Fast Healing\r<br />Perks: AlterationApprentice25, AlterationAdept50, Overdraw20\r<br />[u]Sveya is a sweet and smart young Skaal huntress and other than Frea she would love to see more of the world outside Skaal Village ...[/u]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][u] Jorrim White-Wolf [/u][/color]\r<br />Nord, Skaal Village, Great Hall\r<br />Stats/Skills: One-Handed, Block, Heavy Armor, Two-Handed, (Archery)\r<br />Spells: RaceNord, PowerNordBattleCry\r<br />Perks: ShieldWall20, Armsman20\r<br />[u]Jorrim is a good-natured young Skaal warrior and though loyal to his people he would never refuse the Dragonborn&#39;s request for his support ...[/u]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][u] Arunh Vareq [/u][/color]\r<br />Dunmer, Raven Rock, The Retching Netch\r<br />Stats/Skills: Sneak, One-Handed (dual-wielding&#33;), Light Armor, Archery, (Alteration, Destruction)\r<br />Spells: RaceDarkElf, PowerDarkElfFlameCloak, Oakflesh, Stoneflesh, Firebolt\r<br />Perks: AlterationApprentice25, DestructionApprentice25 (to support his otherwise weaker magic skills)\r<br />[u]Arunh is in mourning and might need a a good distraction from his sorrows and a new task in his life.
