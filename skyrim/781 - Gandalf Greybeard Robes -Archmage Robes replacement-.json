Now you can add greybeard robes to your inventory without needing to use the console command to equip them.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nTo replace Archmage Robes with Greybeard Robes\r\n1. Unzip and add the \\\"Meshes\\\" folder to your Skyrim/Data/ directory.\r\n2. Use the console (press the \\\" ~ \\\" key while in game) and type: player.additem 0007c932 1 \r\n3. The Greybeard robes are now added to your inventory. Enjoy wearing!\r\n\r\nTo add Gandalf the Grey texture\r\n1. To add \\\"Gandalf the Grey\\\" texture, add the texture folder to your Skyrim/Data/ directory.\r\n\r\n*Note* Robes are for males only and are unhooded, and you will not receive the +50 magika enchantment. You will receive 100% Magika regen and spells cost 15% less.\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nI replaced the archmage robes (un-hooded) with the Greybear robes (un-hooded). You can now add them to you\\'re inventory and enjoy wearing them while having the same awesome stats as the Archmage robes.\r\n\r\nI really loved the Greybeard robes, but was upset that I could only equip them with the console command. Moreoever, we could not enchant them with anything. On the other hand, I hated the Arch Mage robes, but they noticably have the best Mage enchantments in the game. \r\n\r\n",
