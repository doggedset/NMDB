  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a playable fox beast race called the Fennec (based on the Fennec Fox) \r<br />\r<br />[i]A wood dwelling race with a fondness for chasing rabbits, this crafty race is sneaking back into society after being driven out by the Bretons.[/i] \r<br />\r<br />------ \r<br />[u]Compatibility:[/u] \r<br />- Should work with other race mods. If you use Khajiit mods they may effect the look of the fox, but not vice versa. \r<br />- Digitigrade feet mod appears to work with this. \r<br />- Dawnguard not required (99% sure) \r<br />- [u][b]Werewolf post-transformation still a working progress, may work better with a werewolf compatibility mod of your choice. \r<br />Vampirism works but you may not be recognised as a vampire by other vamps[/b] [/u]\r<br />\r<br />[u]Note:[/u] \r<br />Using showracemenu to alter an existing character may drastically change your characters skill levels. You can reset them using console commands such as, &#39;player.modav skill archery 50&#39; [b]OR[/b]&#34;Change your Race (ShowRaceMenu Alternative)&#34; mod. \r<br />\r<br />+++ If you avoid using the presets, it should preserve the changes you make to your character. Only skin colour will change, as far as I know it is not my mod that is causing this and can happen using showracemenu in general unfortunately&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Known issues: Duplicated &#39;claw&#39; powers // Fails race-checks in certain missions (Dark Brotherhood + Companions ) \r<br />\r<br />------- \r<br />[u]Race traits:[/u] \r<br />One-handed +10 \r<br />lockpicking +5 \r<br />Sneaking +5 \r<br />Pickpocketing +5 \r<br />speech +10 \r<br />(Total traits + 35) \r<br />Stamina regeneration greatly increased. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Nexus note: My first time uploading to here so apologies in advance if this was done incorrectly.\r<br />",
