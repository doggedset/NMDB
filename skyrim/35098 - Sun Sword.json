To get it, you had to complete Toto\\'s house, and then watch the cutscene where Gosuke dies, and the sword is retrieved from his body.\r\n\r\nHopefully fellow Dark Cloud players can enjoy this mod!\r\n\r\nIt is found Nchuand-Zel Excavation site, which means you must travel to Markarth in order to retrieve this legendary weapon!",
