  "descriptionHtml": "   Long ago Zenithar Granted great knowledge and power to his followers in the form of a pair of gauntlets. After years of war and strife the Gauntlets have been lost, or have they.   \r<br />    Have you ever wondered why there would be bandits running a mine? Just a good place to hide or are they looking for something? \r<br />    This Mod adds a dungeon to find Zenithars gift In the Embershard Mine. God level gloves that unlock all Potion, Smithing and Enchanting skills and perks, and Fortifys them by 100. If you can find and defeat the guardains. This is my third mod created in response to requests to make a quest to go along with my Smialench Gloves. \r<br />      The level is difficult but do-able as a new character. Its hidden in the Embershard Mine.\r<br />The entrance may be hard to find. (hint its a very dark level)\r<br />\r<br />Please endorse if you like&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />Find spoiler in Forums.",
