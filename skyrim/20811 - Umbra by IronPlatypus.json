  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is my take on Umbra. I know there are other Umbra mods out there, but I felt like they were missing something. The design was based on Morrowind\\'s Umbra, and the stats based on Oblivion\\'s. I also added in the \\\"ebony blade effect\\\" (i.e. it never runs out of enchantment). A very fun sword to use... if you can find it.\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG\r\nV1.0- initial release\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n-frostnads for giving me this idea\r\n-anyone who comments with ideas for this mod",
