  "descriptionHtml": "Steam Workshop link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=8960\r<br />\r<br />There was a small bug in Riften jail, where from certain angle the wall seemed to disappear. This is now fixed.\r<br />\r<br />It may just be a bug in the portal/room system, because originally they weren&#39;t really that out of place. However, there were 2 portals connecting these rooms. I removed the other and enlarged it to cover both door areas (like was done for other room in same jail...).\r<br />\r<br />Note: This fix is already included in Unofficial Skyrim Patch.",
