  "descriptionHtml": "A requested mod by [url=\\\"http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/4472935-redbeard007/\\']Redbeard007[/url] to add ingredients with the Fortify Alchemy effect. I didn\\'t want to do anything that would change any lists (and my attempts to make harvestable plants failed), so I edited four preexisting ingredients: \r\n\r\n[list][*]Skeever Tail has had its \\\"damage health\\\" effect changed to \\\"fortify alchemy\\\". (It had both \\\"damage health\\\" and \\\"ravage health\\\", which seemed redundant. I left the worse one.)\r\n[*]Small Antlers has had its \\\"fortify restoration\\\" effect changed to \\\"fortify alchemy\\\". \r\n[*]Nirnroot and Crimson Nirnroot have had their \\\"damage stamina\\\" effect changed to \\\"fortify alchemy\\\".[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Edit:[/b] if you want your Nirnroot pristine, v 1.1 uses Eye of Sabre cat (replaces \\\"restore stamina\\\" and Giant Lichen (replaces \\\"restore magicka\\\") instead.\r\n\r\nThis is under \\\"Cheats\\\" because, well, there\\'s probably a reason this didn\\'t exist in the vanilla game. \r\n\r\n===Install===\r\nNMM or extract file to your Data folder.\r\n\r\n===Compatibility===\r\n[list][*]Shouldn\\'t have much of a problem with anything that doesn\\'t change those four ingredients.\r\n[*]If you are using a mod that makes alchemy take time (if there is one, I\\'m not sure) you might have a problem due to the potion durations being, like most potions, about a minute. If anyone is using such a mod and can test that out I would appreciate it. [/list]\r\n\r\n===Note===\r\nThe screenshot that shows the Nirnroots being used shows that the Fortify Alchemy effect lasts for 0 seconds. After taking that screenshot I fixed that so they actually have durations on their effects.",
