  "descriptionHtml": "Detailed Description (For those who like reading!)[Minor Spoilers]\r\nThis mod adds a tower directly above Old Hroldan full of forsworn and a hagraven (nice lady). The daggers in the mod can be found relatively easily. They do more damage then the other daggers in the vanilla game however not by much. They also have a bonus effect of stealthing the target they hit for a few seconds or until your target strikes you. There\\'s not much more to say, it\\'s a small dungeon where I\\'ve applied most of what I learned doing Ildramesh\\'s Folly and have done my best to make it high quality and condensed.\r\n\r\nComplete with edited navmeshes inside/outside, lighting, optimized, travel point, and tested. \r\n\r\nBugs:\r\nRegarding the Daggers: When brought to an enchanting table you receive the option to disenchant them and you can! However the enchantment will not work (from what I saw) when applied to other weapons. Instead they receive a strange purple orb where your hand is with no real effect added to the weapon. \r\n\r\nConflicts: None\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1: Fixed physics bug on some clutter. (fish was beating up the wall)\r\nVersion 1.2: Fixed exterior disappearing. Fixed navmesh conflict between exterior cells. (Tower sits on 3 exterior cell borders so the navmeshing needed some extra attention to link together.)",
