  "descriptionHtml": "[img] http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/2049573-1391378775.png [/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />In short this mod does something really simple, but in doing so it dramatically changes how you think of staves in Skyrim for the better. ( This is NOT a cheat mod, it does NOT make the game any &#34;easier&#34; )\r<br />\r<br />what it does: This mod increases the number of uses of every staff in skyrim, in a fair and balanced manner, Thus making staves in skyrim much more practical and viable weapons.\r<br />-\r<br />[color=green] Detailed description: What this accomplishes in game, and what it means for your typical combat scenario. [/color]\r<br />In stock Skyrim staves are weak the good ones do decent damage however they run out of uses after killing just a few enemies, in the past you would have to stop all combat and recharge your staff with a soul gem, this is annoying and immersion breaking. Plus in stock Skyrim its not rare for a common or sometimes even a lessor soul gem to provide more &#34;enchant&#34; than what the staff actually holds, this is inefficient.\r<br />\r<br />And that&#39;s where this mod makes a difference, by increasing the &#34;enchant&#34; a staff holds you increase the total number of possible uses, so you can last longer in every combat scenario. To completely fill a staff you would now require more soul gem &#34;enchant&#34; (because it holds more); but you wont have to recharge as often.\r<br />\r<br />for instance\r<br />( made up examples )\r<br />---\r<br />Stock\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]A staff has 1000 &#34;enchant&#34; [/color]\r<br />its ability uses 100 &#34;enchant&#34;\r<br />[color=red]total number of uses = 10 [/color]\r<br />lesser soul is worth 750 &#34;enchant&#34; so it takes 2 lesser souls to fill 100%\r<br />\r<br />------\r<br />With this mod\r<br />\r<br />[color=green]The staff now has 3000 &#34;enchant&#34; [/color]\r<br />its ability still uses 100 &#34;enchant&#34;\r<br />[color=green]total number of uses is now 30 [/color]\r<br />lesser soul is still worth 750 &#34;enchant&#34; so it takes 4 lesser souls to fill 100% (in this case you can now more efficiently use soul gems )\r<br />======\r<br />\r<br />[color=blue] Why I made this mod. [/color]\r<br />\r<br />In TES 4 Oblivion, any proper mage would use a powerful staff as his/her main weapon, while using spells on the side.\r<br />\r<br />but in skyrim it always seems like staffs are simply tools you only use for 1 boss and then put away (If it even last long enough to do any amount of damage to a boss.)\r<br />If you dare use a staff in Skyrim for most combat instances you are forced to recharge the staff during combat ( sometimes after killing just 3 enemies&#33; ) This combat mechanic is simply faulty, and unnecessary.\r<br />\r<br />In Oblivion a Mage would charge his/her staff and it would last for the duration of a short adventure or most the way through. This is what I wanted to introduce to Skyrim.\r<br />-\r<br />Quote from a user [color=green]&#34;Brilliant idea&#33; This is my kind of mod. Just a little tweak to how the staves are charged. Makes using them more practical in a battle, a thus makes the weapon more practical. No lore breaking whatsoever. This is the kind of mod that turns up in GEMS. &#34;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />------------------------------\r<br />Install\r<br />\r<br />recommended, Install this mod via NMM\r<br />\r<br />Manual, simply place the ESP file from this mod into your Skyrim data folder and activate the ESP.\r<br />----\r<br />uninstall\r<br />\r<br />Recommended, deactivate this mod from your NMM\r<br />\r<br />Manual, deactivate the ESP.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />Compatibility\r<br />\r<br />due to the simplicity of this mod, it won&#39;t conflict with anything unless it modifies the number of uses staves receive.\r<br />\r<br />(load order is not important)\r<br />--------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Safety\r<br />\r<br />again due to the simple nature of this mod, it is totally safe and easy to uninstall if you wish to do so.\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------\r<br />Credits\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda for making TES series\r<br />The Nexus for this amazing mod website\r<br />Special thanks to Kekor\r<br />--------------",
