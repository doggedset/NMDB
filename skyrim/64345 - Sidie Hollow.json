  "descriptionHtml": "This is a work in progress&#33; Sidie Hollow is a small park located in Southern Wisconsin, U.S.A. I have been attempting to recreate the park with as much accuracy as the Creation Kit allows as a school project. This area is not fully navmeshed and still needs a lot of work but feel free to check out what I have so far. If you would like to use Sidie Hollow in your mod send me a message and tell me your idea and we will see what we can do&#33;",
