  "modName": "Intense Dragon Fight",
  "summary": "This is a little mod I made to dip my toe in the water of Skyrim modding. Just a fight against an OP Dragon. The fight itself is difficult even with Dragonrend, and as a reward for defeating him. You get an abundant amount of scales and bones.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is very simple and tame. There is a big bad Alduin-level dragon based near Bleak Falls Barrow, you as the Dovakiin need to kill it. The dragon itself is passive unless attacked, so running into him (shouldn&#39;t get you killed.) The loot doesn&#39;t give you anything nice, just lots of bones and scales to A. get rich as hell, or B. make armour and things.\r<br />This is my first time actually modding Skyrim, and as such I didn&#39;t try to overextend myself and try to make DLC sized content the first try. This is a beginning for me, and even though it is simple I hope you will enjoy.   ",
