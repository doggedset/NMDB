Ever. \r<br /> \r<br />All this mod does is increase the Hunting Bow’s damage to 26 (from 7) and increase the attack speed to 1.2 (from 0.937).  The reason being is, I really like the look of the hunting bow, but it doesn’t do enough damage for me to have fun with it.  \r<br />",

The reason being is, I really like the look of the hunting bow, but it doesn’t do enough damage for me to have fun with it.  \r<br />\r<br />The improved bow&#39;s name is Hunter&#39;s bow.  It can be bought in the Drunken Huntsman.\r<br />\r<br />This mod should be compatible with all mods, except the ones that mess with the hunting bow.\r<br />\r<br />Possible glitch: Sometimes the Hunter&#39;s bow won&#39;t show the correct item necessary to temper it in the tempering menu.  To fix it just leave the grindstone, then come back.\r<br />\r<br />Like I said, this is my first mod and I would really appreciate suggestions, critiques, etc.  Also if it doesn’t work with a mod, please let me know.\r<br />Please remember though, I&#39;m just starting out and you may know more about modding than I do.  If that is the case, please help me out.\r<br />\r<br />Also in the steam workshop at http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=248081344\r<br />\r<br />All screenshots taken by me.\r<br />\r<br />Hunting Bow with purple background picture taken from http://www.therpf.com/f9/skyrim-hunting-bow-done-next-up-ebony-186433/",
