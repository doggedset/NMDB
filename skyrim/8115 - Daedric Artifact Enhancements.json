  "summary": "This mod removes the charge costs from all Daedric artifact weapons and increases their damage, basically giving you unlimited charges and somewhat more powerful weapons.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever think it was odd that only a couple of the daedric weapons had unlimited charges, like Ebony Blade?  I did, so I slapped together a small mod to make them all like that.  Now, the enhancements on Dawnbreaker, Sanguine Rose, Skull of Corruption, Mace of Molag Bal, Volendrung, and Wabbajack all require no charges to cast and the charges from these weapons have been removed.  The Ebony Blade and Mehrunes\\' Razor already had infinite charges, so no tweaking to their enchantments was required.  The actual weapons in the group also had their damage increased (including Ebony Blade and Mehrunes\\' Razor) to make them more believable as weapons granted by god-like beings while hopefully not making them too powerful.  Enjoy!",
