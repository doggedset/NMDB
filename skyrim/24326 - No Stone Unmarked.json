  "descriptionHtml": "Adds quest markers to all Stones of Barenziah in No Stone Unturned. This mod only modifies No Stone Unturned itself, and should not conflict with anything unless it also modifies that quest.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* Clairvoyance works for some Stones but not others. (Very likely this is due to the location of the stone being too high off the ground or otherwise not \\\"reachable\\\" by the pathing system...or just the usual Clairvoyance bugs.)\r\n* The marker for the one in Astrid\\'s room at the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary won\\'t show up until you\\'ve entered the sanctuary. (Due to how the Dark Brotherhood quest works.)",
