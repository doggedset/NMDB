  "summary": "Want to add some flavor to your adventuring? Well how about you run into enemies in the places you feel most safe... To top it off, once you slay them, they are yours to summon back from Oblivion!",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will add 10 random enemies throughout buildings and places you would most likely go sometime during your questing. One may be on the throat of the world...one may be in Proudspire Manner? You never know...I will be constantly adding people and creatures to it as I go along. Each NPC you slay, or are slain by, has some cute lute held within them. Among this lute is a Spell Tome: Summon Imposter ________......\r\nThe Spell Tome allows you to summon the NPC you just slayed. These people are everywhere, trying to kill you. For the sake of your survival it is your duty to tie their souls to your will, and use them to unleash your wrath upon Skyrim to tear it asunder.",
