  "descriptionHtml": "A Save Game of my female imperial at the begining of her journey. This is by far the best character I have ever made. Her name is Claudia and i tried to go for a more french/italian look. Will try and post more skreenshots of her further down the track as i dont think the 1st 3 do her justice.\r\n\r\n--Mods Used to achieve whats in Screenshots--\r\nBright Eyes v1-3 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2464\r\n\r\nCBBE v3-Slim/NeverNude Preset - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nFountain of Youth - Beauty Project v 1-5 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2535\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI doubt the order they were installed will have a huge impact but for those who want it, I placed them in chronological order in the list above.\r\n\r\nI have only noticed one problem with my mod colection. The FoY textures are different from CBBE skin textures so you will see a neck seem when naked or wearing exposing armour. however since most the vinila armours stop at the same point as the neck seem its not noticable. Another thing is that it might tell you that some items are missing from the save, just select \\'yes\\' to force the save to load. this is because i have variouse item mods active (that you might not have aswell) which I forgot to disable at the time of saving.\r\n\r\nTo install just place the .ess file in your Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Saves Folder.\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\nPlz don\\'t forget to indorse it if you downloaded it and liked it :)\r\nHave Fun out there!",
