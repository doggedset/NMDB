  "summary": "Vath Firehall - A Nord, two handed warrior companion. As member of the Whiterun Guard he has vowed to protect and serve you the Dragonborn.  He will skillfully follow and use his training to help you in the fight against your most powerful foes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "   Vath Firehall is currently employed as a guard in Whiterun. He can be a bit of a sarcastic loudmouth sometimes, not taking his work to seriously. He causes Commander Caius endless grief, losing his job three to four times a week. The Commander always ends up hireing him back, due to a debt that he owes the Firehall family from long ago. Although one day Caius still swears he will rid Whiterun of the troublemaker once and for all. It&#39;s not that Vath doesn&#39;t want to do his job, there are just so many more interesting and fun things to do besides patrol all day. In the end it might take him a while but, at least he always finishes his job, much to the Commanders relief. Vath is really not to sure what to make of all this Dragonborn business, but to him it sounds like allot of trouble.\r<br />   \r<br />[b]Details[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Nord - Two Handed Steel Hammer wielding warrior.\r<br />Currently he is at level 8 with the potential to reach 100 and he auto-levels up with the player.\r<br />Vath is a member of the Guards in Whiterun and you can find him paroling the city streets each day, though he sometimes sneaks off to the Drunken Huntsman for a drink in the early afternoon. After he finishes his patrol, he ends his night with a visit to the Bannered Mare before going back to the Guard Barracks to sleep. He has several perks in Two Handed, Stealth, as well as the Light Foot Perk for those pesky traps. Vath is also potential marriage candidate.\r<br />\r<br />Even if you dislike the Whiterun Guards, Vath is still a GREAT Warrior Follower to pick up and adventure with&#33;&#33;&#33; *(Vath is more of a Companion/Follower than true acting guard right at the moment, he won&#39;t notice player crimes but, he won&#39;t help commit them either.)*\r<br />\r<br />Vath Firehall is a Semi-Stand Alone Follower- meaning he is complete as you see here (hair/eyes/armor are included) and he needs no required mods *SAVE FOR YOUR SKYRIM GAMES CURRENT UPDATE* Vath will use your own body and facial textures that you currently have installed.\r<br />*(I was planning on doing a complete stand alone character but, I thought people might enjoy using their own meshes/textures choices better. If the need arises I will do a seperate standalone file, if people tell me what body and facial mods they prefer.)*\r<br />\r<br />I love screenshots&#33;&#33;&#33; If you decide to invite Vath into your game please comeback and show me&#33;&#33;  Give me all the screenshots you can&#33;&#33;&#33; I will love them all&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />These mod authors either gave me permission to use their mods or mods that were free to use with given credit or gave help - during the creation of Vath Firehall.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17993]Hair packs of TES IV Oblivion for Male Only by Radioragae[/url]   \r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]ApachiiSkyHair by Apachii[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722]The Eyes Of Beauty by Gabriel Mailhot[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25791]TairenSoul Tattoo Warpaint for Men by TairenSoul[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38217/?]Beautiful Freaks Warpaint by MM[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20900]Bandanas of Skyrim by volvaga0[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12092]Cloaks of Skyrim by Noodles[/url] \r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16438]Bandolier - Bags and Pouches by Dragten[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488]Better Males by Chris57 and FavoredSoul-Geonox Faces[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=18]Suggested Mods[/size][/b]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17993]Hair packs of TES IV Oblivion for Male Only by Radioragae[/url]   \r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20900]Bandanas of Skyrim by volvaga0[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12092]Cloaks of Skyrim by Noodles[/url] \r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16438]Bandolier - Bags and Pouches by Dragten[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23755]Inhabitants of Skyrim - NPC Overhaul by Rops1981[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31210]Vaendral - Imperial Male Follower by highonsunday[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22524]The Companions by Netherwalk by netherwalk[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29953]Julien Christophe - Priest of Mara by greyblood[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29953]Better males -by Chris57 and FavoredSoul/Geonox[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28363]Beards by Hvergelmir[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=18]Install-Uninstall[/size][/b]\r<br />INSTALL- Download with NMM and install or manually place Vath.esp, .bsa in your Skyim/Data folder \r<br />UNINSTALL-Deactivate with NMM or delete all included Vath files from your Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=18]FAQS[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Q-Where is the previous version of Vath that included quests?\r<br />A-Edoserax is no longer working with me on my mod, I have taken down the older versions of the mod so I can rebuild it from the bottom up.
