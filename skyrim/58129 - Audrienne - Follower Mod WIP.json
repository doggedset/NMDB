  "descriptionHtml": "This is version 0.1 of the Audrienne Follower Mod. It is still heavy work in progress.\r<br />\r<br />Some folks asked me to make a follower out of my &#34;Audrienne - Breton Girl&#34; char and so I did. I have never created a follower in the creation kit before, so that was a real first timer for me. \r<br />\r<br />You can find her in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun, where she spends her spare time with dancing and drinking alcoholic beverages. Time to give her some work, didn´t you think? She wears a ebony armor (without helmet), a ebony bow and a ebony longsword. \r<br />\r<br />The mod is still WIP and I plan to add some changes with the next releases, like making her a merc for hire and balancing her stats. \r<br />\r<br />Installation is really a bit uncomfortable at the moment, I have to apologize for my lack of skill with the construction kit.\r<br />\r<br />I encountered a ugly problem, where facial textures aren´t loaded properly. Maybe a bug, maybe I forgot some setting. Maybe someone with more experience with the CK could have a look at it. :-)\r<br />\r<br />For the moment you need to do the following steps to make her work as intended...\r<br />\r<br />You need:\r<br />\r<br />CBBE 3.3 with activated face pack 2666\r<br />OblivionHairPackAIO 22598 \r<br />The Eyes Of Beauty 13722 (optional)\r<br />\r<br />Edit: en3raider pointed me to my mistake. I made a new NMM-friendly version, that should work without further steps. So I removed the rest of the readme, because it is obsolete. Thx for the jolt. :)\r<br />\r<br />Please let me know if there are any problems left. ",
