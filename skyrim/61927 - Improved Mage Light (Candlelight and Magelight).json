Vanilla settings are too bright when looking at a short distance, and you can&#39;t see far at all because of the low radius. Also increases the duration of Candlelight with 25 %. Does not modify the cost or color.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u][size=5]QUICK OVERVIEW\r<br />[/size][/u][/b][size=3][b]\r<br />[/b]Reduces the magnitude (brightness) of Candlelight and Magelight with 50 % to avoid the blinding effect, but increases the radius with 50 or 100 % (depending on which file you choose). Vanilla settings are too bright when looking at a short distance, and you can&#39;t see far at all because of the low radius. One version also increases the duration of Candlelight with 25 %. Does not modify the cost or color of the spells at all. [b]Allows you to see clearly at any time or place in Skyrim - without getting a headache.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=5]RECOMMENDED TO USE WITH\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/u][/b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61919/?][b]Improved Mage Armor Spell[/b] [/url]- Adds 25% duration to all Mage armor spells. Adds +20 Armor rating to each spell level (scales with Mage armor perk) and changes Dragonhide to add 150 Armor rating over a longer duration instead of the 80% reduction.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61921/?]Improved Magic Settings[/url][/b] - Changes Dualcasting cost from 2.8 to 2.5 and effectiveness from 2.2 to 2.5. Basically a must to make dual casting Alteration, restoration, destruction etc worth picking by itself. This mod also changes Combat magicka regeneration to 50% instead of 33%, so that you can rely slightly more on Magicka regen instead of -100% cost enchantments. Max resistances reduced to 70% (down from 85%) so that enemy spells are not trivialized with 97% (0.15*0.15) damage reduction.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30073/?][size=3][b]Immersive Potions[/b][/size][/url][size=3] - Modifies all instant restoration potions to heal over time and makes them non-stackable. If a new potion with the same effect (heal, stamina or magicka restoration) is used, it will overwrite the current potion. There are a couple of mods with the same features, but this one is unique in several aspects. Totally script-free 7kb download.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61922?][b]Realistic Movement Speed Reduction[/b][/url] - This mod aims to bring backwards- and sideways running movement speed closer together and reach more realistic levels. This mod slows the backwards movement speed by roughly 15 % - but the sideways and sidestepping movement speed is reduced by 33 %. It also reduces movement during combat to more realistic levels&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Enjoy&#33;[/b][/size][/size]",
