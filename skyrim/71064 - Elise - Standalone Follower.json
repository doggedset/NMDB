By the time she has earned a new friend Ulfberth War-Bear \r<br />that gave her a place to stay.\r<br />[/i][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[/b][quote][b][size=3][color=#ff0000]SPOILER ABOUT HER PARENTS&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; (Only for those who didnt get it from story)[/color][/size][/b][/quote]Her parents seem to be Jofthor and Boti while her sister&#39;s name is Fastred (Jofthor is not letting Fastred to see the world because long time ago her sister did it too and she is gone) According to my story :)) \r<br />[center][font=Comic Sans MS][size=6][u]\r<br />[color=#fce5cd][b]RECOMMENDED MODS[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/size][size=4][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?]KJ Hairdos - Renewal[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?]The Eyes Of Beaut[/url][/b][/size][/font][size=4][b][font=Comic Sans MS][/font][font=Comic Sans MS][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?]y\r<br />[/url][/font][/b][/size][font=Comic Sans MS][size=4][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30411/?]HD Brows[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?]CBBE[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51602/?]Fair Skin Complexion[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70890/?]Alacrity[/url]\r<br />                                        [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3654/?]Killer Keos Skimpy CBBE[/url][/b][/size][size=3] [/size][size=2](If you want exactly the same look of armor)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=6][b][u][color=#fce5cd]BIG THANKS TO:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/8267681/?]PTC001[/url] for being there with me since begining\r<br />\r<br />[b]      [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/30027/?]Hvergelmer[/url] (FOR BROWS)\r<br />   [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/1734939/?]Billyro[/url] (FOR SWORD)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/4559665/?]Kaliles[/url](FOR HAIR)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2509011/?]Jmenaru[/url](FOR ARMOR)\r<br />[/b][/size][/font][font=Comic Sans MS]\r<br />[size=6]Because without them Elise wouldnt be here :)\r<br />\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=#fce5cd][size=6]OTHER CREDITS[/size][/color][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4557236/?]HHaley[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3330686/?]Caliente[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1856479/?]Killerkeo[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/308756/?]LogRaam[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/b][/font][/center]",
