  "descriptionHtml": "==============\r\nShort Description:\r\n==============\r\nThis adds a seperate race from the Redguards.\r\nThe Greyguards of Pyandonea originally hail from the western continent of Yokuda, which sank into the sea in ancient times. Unlike their seafaring brethren they fled to the the misty island of Pyandonea and as a result retained their light skin color.\r\n\r\n===============\r\nVersion History:\r\n===============\r\nSorry for the amount of small updates instead of one bigger one.\r\n\r\nV1.2 Fixed Double Greyguard choice in the Race menu\r\n     No more floating head copy\r\nv1.1 Male and Female\r\nv1.0 Male only\r\n\r\n==============\r\nLore Description:\r\n==============\r\nThe western continent of Yokuda, which sank into the sea in ancient times, was the original home of the Yokudans. The meaning of the name is unknown. Although Yokuda no longer exists, it is included on one map of Western Tamriel, and there is some evidence of contact between Tamrielic explorers and Yokudans. According to residents of Anvil, ships still sail to Yokuda from Anvil, and some sources refer to the continent as if it still exists in some form. The largest land mass was Akos Kasaz, though the continent was also composed of over half a dozen large islands, such as Samara, Khibi, Kamlesh, and Kanesh. It is unknown whether the landmasses south of the Sea of Pearls, such as Ravan, are or were traditionally considered part of Yokuda.\r\n\r\nYokudan society was very advanced for its time. Yokudan navies were superior to those found amongst Tamrielic kingdoms, and their astronomical knowledge, martial arts, agriculture, politics, and philosophy were all very advanced. It\\'s debated whether the destruction which caused the Yokudans to flee was due to natural causes, acts of the Yokudans, or both. Yokuda was the scene of frequent warfare, and there are tales blaming the cataclysm on a rebel band of Ansei, magical swordsmen whose secret techniques are reputedly capable of such devastation. In any event, the Redguards themselves seem to be under the impression that the destruction of Yokuda was in some way their fault.\r\n\r\nUpon the sinking of their homeland around 1E 792, which apparently was predictable to some degree, the Greyguard fleet set to the south where they shored at the continent of Pyandonea in 1E 804, where they were greeted by the Maormer.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nRacial Skill Bonusses:\r\n=================\r\n- One handed      10\r\n- Archery            10\r\n- Alchemy            10\r\n- Block                 5\r\n\r\n- Resis Poison 50%\r\n- Adrenaline Rush (Stamina regenerates 10x faster for 60 seconds, once per day)\r\n\r\n============================\r\nAll Mods from this auther:\r\n============================\r\n- Oblivionized Racial Skill Bonusses and Resistances:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8215\r\n- Morrowindized Racial Skill Bonusses and Resistances:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8670\r\n- Morrowindized Artifacts:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8991\r\n- Caucasian Yokudans aka Greyguards\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16309\r\n\r\n=========\r\nRemember:\r\n=========\r\n- Feedback!
