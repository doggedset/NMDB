  "descriptionHtml": "NEW UPDATE!!!   Feb. 18, 2002\r\nPlease read below and look at the photos of the new Alchemy Platform!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nName:  Riverside Cabin - Chrome Edition\r\nVersion Update:  1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23\r\nDate:  Feb 18, 2012\r\nAuthor:  entropiachrome\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOriginal file:\r\nRiverside Cabin for new Adventurers\r\nby MalleusNoctum\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8612\r\n\r\nTheCabin.esp\r\n\r\n============\r\nWARNING:  Installing this mod will overwrite the original file “thecabin.esp” as I did NOT change the name.  If you already have the original version by MalleusNoctum installed, I would strongly recommend that you remove all possessions from the cabin prior to installing this version.\r\n============\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE VIDEO NOW AVAILABLE!!!   <see the video tab>\r\n\r\n\r\nI am completely new to modding, and had no idea how to create a player home.  After looking at dozens of player-designed home files available for download here on SkyrimNexus, I discovered this simple yet elegant player cabin designed by MalleusNoctum.\r\n\r\nSince this particular cabin along the river is almost exactly how I would have designed a home myself, I was inspired to learn a bit more about the Creation Kit to see what I could do to refine the interior and exterior to suit my personal needs.  Since I think it came out pretty decent, I figured I would upload it here for others to use.\r\n\r\nChanges and upgrades (Outside):\r\n* Changed one chair\r\n* Relocated fishing pole\r\n* Removed a lantern and empty crate\r\n* Small adjustments to the torch lighting on the porch\r\n\r\nChanges and upgrades (Inside):\r\n* Changed fireplace from embers to logs, adjusted light source\r\n* More food supplies, dish ware, and usable cutlery on the shelves and table\r\n* Reduced size of elk antlers above the fireplace\r\n* Changed angle of chairs\r\n\r\nAdditions (Outside):\r\n* Wood chopping block and woodpile just outside the home\r\n* Archery range to the west behind the home\r\n* Harvestable salmon on the porch\r\n* Added round table, lantern with candle lighting, and some mead\r\n* Two lantern posts lighting the bridge to Riverwood\r\n* Marker on the map, fast-travel enabled\r\n\r\n============\r\nUPDATE Feb 18, 2012:\r\nAll updated versions had two chairs (one inside, one outside) changed to allow for more natural seating animation while entering and exiting the chair.  Also, random items in the storage chest and dresser have been removed so they are empty when you first arrive in the cabin.\r\n============\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n============\r\nMAIN and OPTIONAL FILES (choose one):\r\n\r\nVersion 1.20:  Main file, basic cabin\r\nVersion 1.21:  Optional Cooking Pot ONLY\r\nVersion 1.22:  Optional Alchemy Platform ONLY\r\nVersion 1.23:  Adds BOTH the Cooking Pot and the Alchemy Platform\r\n============\r\n\r\n\r\n============\r\nINSTALLATION:  Place thecabin.esp file into your Skyrim Data Folder or use the Download Manager\r\n============\r\n\r\n\r\nBugs:  Slight clipping of the avatar feet when using the woodchopping block and the cooking pot, but it does not affect use.  Also, I\\'m not positive the hanging food items (salmon/pheasant/rabbit) will respawn.  Other than that, no known issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n============\r\nCREDITS:\r\n\r\nMalleusNoctum for creating the original file TheCabin.esp\r\nPlease credit and endorse MalleusNoctum for his original file.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8612\r\n\r\n\r\nBethesda for creating TES V: Skyrim and the Creation Kit",
