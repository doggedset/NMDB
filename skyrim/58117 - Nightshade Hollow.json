  "summary": "A small hideout near Ivarstead.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b]Introduction\n<br />============[/b][/center]\n<br />[center]Below the settlement of Ivarstead, at the base of the waterfall lies a door.\n<br />\n<br />A darkened entrance to a small dwelling, ignored by the inhabitants of the town. \n<br />There was a rumour of an Elve that lived there, a strange being wary of others and quick to remain out of sight.\n<br />\n<br />Apparently having moved on, the den has sat silent and unused. \n<br />Perhaps someone of a more adventurous nature would be willing to check out the entrance to this darkened abode.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Description\n<br />===========[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Name: Nightshade Hollow\n<br />\n<br />A small single person dwelling.\n<br />\n<br />Home Includes:\n<br />\n<br />~ Bedroom\n<br />~ Storage (Multiple, various)\n<br />~ Alchemy, Enchanting areas\n<br />~ Cooking pot and Oven\n<br />~ Forge, Grind wheel, Workbench and tanning areas\n<br />~ Armour mannequins and weapon displays/racks\n<br />~ Decorative shower area\n<br />\n<br />There are multiple and various storage areas and containers within the home, identfiable by their name when you hover the mouse over them.\n<br />\n<br />Weapon racks, bookshelves, armour storage, food stores etc... Plus a few other misc storage items.\n<br />\n<br />Many of the items are fixed in place to prevent clutter flying around the cell, but not everything. I have made efforts to avoid placing anything moveable in areas that are likely to result in them being knocked down or shifted by a passing player.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Location\n<br />========[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The home has it's own map marker - status - always activated.\n<br />\n<br />This means you can fast travel to it from first installation if you so wish. Look for it near Solitude on the world map. You should see the map marker close to Ivarstead.\n<br />\n<br />Image of the location on the map is included in this download.\n<br />\n<br />Location notes:\n<br />\n<br />Depending on other mods used, you may encounter creatures or enemies outside, this is something I did not encounter myself during my building and testing, but I am aware that any mod that adds additional creatures, combat zones or similar mods can increase the chance of such encounters, I hope it does not become an issue for people, but I felt people should be aware it might happen.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements:\n<br />============[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The official update ESM, and the officla DLC: Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Install\n<br />=======[/b]\n<br />\n<br />1.
