  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds 4 new destruction spells to the game, with minor issues due to my lack of knowledge, but not too serious issues.\r<br />\r<br />Learn to wield not only Fire or Frost separately, but fused together into ultimate spells of hot and cold\r<br />\r<br />The Novice Destruction spells &#34;Flames&#34; and &#34;Frostbite&#34; have been fused into &#34;Fire Frost Stream&#34;\r<br />The Apprentice Destruction spells &#34;Firebolt&#34; and &#34;Ice Spike&#34; have been fused into &#34;Fire Frost Shot&#34;\r<br />The Adept Destruction spells &#34;Fire Ball&#34; and &#34;Ice Storm&#34; have been fused into &#34;Fire Frost Blast&#34;\r<br />The Expert Destruction spells &#34;Incinerate&#34; and &#34;Icy Spear&#34; have been fused into &#34;Advanced Fire Frost Shot&#34;\r<br />\r<br />WARNING: People have stated that no vendors sell the spell tomes. Also, due to CK being difficult to deal with, I am unable to place a world spawn. IF you want to acquire these spells, you will have to use the Console.\r<br />\r<br />Minor Issues mentioned:\r<br />-Damage Balancing Issues are encountered, as each spell uses damage from both the spells.\r<br />-Textures look like either the frost spell or fire spell (not both), but still display frost and burning on enemy. The inventory image has been fixed to the absorb appearance.\r<br />\r<br />Hopefully, eventually, damages from both spells will be balanced and custom spell textures will be added. And maybe I will get smarter :D\r<br />If anyone has knowledge that can help me improve, leave a post for me and i&#39;ll reply when I can.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy~",
