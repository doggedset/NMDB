  "descriptionHtml": "[URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/831/screenshot69mv.jpg/][IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img831/2336/screenshot69mv.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nI present you my new mod: Heroic Armor.\r\n\r\n This armor is called \\\"HEROIC ARMOR\\\", reason for naming the mod \\\"Heroic Armour\\\" is because nexus doesn\\'t allow me to name it \\\"armor\\\" .[color=\\\"#FFFF00\\\"][size=\\\"4\\\"][font=\\\"Arial Black\\\"][/font][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s this all bout:[color=\\\"#FFA500\\\"][size=\\\"4\\\"][font=\\\"Arial Black\\\"][/font][/size][/color]\r\n- This mod includes two things, one of them is armor and the other is an axe.\r\n. Armor is called \\\"Heroic Armor\\\" and the axe is called: \\\"Heroic Axe\\\".\r\n- This mod is all about the Armor, the axe is just a simple bonus to the mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nHystory:[color=\\\"#DDA0DD\\\"][size=\\\"4\\\"][font=\\\"Arial Black\\\"][/font][/size][/color]\r\nThis armor was once costum made and worn by Yngol, son of Ysgramor. Ysgramor gave order to his blacksmith  to make a really durable and hard armor, like no other warrior had. Ysgramor\\\\\\'s blacksmith was crafting this armor for a long time, to make it better than any other armor warriors had. After one year the armor  was done. It was far better than any other. Ysgramor presented the armor as a gift to his son Yngol. Soon after, Ysgramor lost his son Yngol to the sea-ghosts and Ysgramor braved a storm to search for him in  the treacherous waters.But the only thing Ysgramor had found in the sea was Yngols armor. Ysgramor always looked at his son as a great hero, so in his son\\\\\\'s honour, he gave the armor a name; \\\"Heroic Armor\\\". Axe was later made by the same blacksmith that crafted the \\\"Heroic Armor\\\". He made the axe for the companions that  have followed Ysgramor troughthis battles.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to obtain and additional info:[color=\\\"#FF0000\\\"][size=\\\"4\\\"][font=\\\"Arial Black\\\"][/font][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n-You can craft both the armor and the axe under \\\"Ebony\\\" tab at the forge. Doesn\\'t matter which forge it is.\r\n- Full armor contains four parts: helmet, cuirass, boots and gauntlets.\r\n- Armor is upgradable and unenchanted and so is the axe. You can enchant both the armor and the axe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#9ACD32\\\"][size=\\\"3\\\"][font=\\\"Arial Black\\\"][/font][/size][/color]Armor stats:\r\n\r\nCuirass: Heavy Armor, - base armor: 60\r\nGauntlets: Heavy Armor, - base armor: 28\r\nHelmet: Heavy Armor, - base armor: 28\r\nBoots: Heavy Armor, - base armor: 29\r\nAxe: Two Handed, - base damage: 41\r\n\r\nInstallation:[color=\\\"#00FFFF\\\"][size=\\\"3\\\"][font=\\\"Arial Black\\\"][/font][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n- Both installation and uninstallation guides are located in the downloadable file. They\\'re writen inside\r\nthe document called \\\"Readme\\\".\r\n\r\nKnown bugs and other:[color=\\\"#98FB98\\\"][size=\\\"3\\\"][font=\\\"Arial Black\\\"][/font][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n1.This armor is only for male characters.\r\n2.Argonians can equip the helmet, but the helmet isn\\\\\\'t displayed on them. Reason: Who in the world\r\nwants to play an argonian??! (If you do, don\\'t worry, I\\'ll make helmet for them too, in the next\r\nfew days.)  \r\n\r\n\r\nPermision: You may not reupload or modify this files online without asking me first.
