  "summary": "You can pick up firewood continuously.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Activating a woodcutting block in vanilla, will then cause you to produce Firewood at a rate of 2 units each 3 seconds, with a limit of 6 units per activation.\r\nNow you can pick up wood continuously. This means that you will take the same time to get the wood, without the inconvenience of having to keep clicking the woodcutting block every 3 hits. Yes, now you can leave the computer for a long time to go and relax while your poor character (or his / her follower) works. If you want to leave it working for a long time, I recommend you do this in any big city.\r\n\r\nLook my another mod, infinite ore veins http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8505 Now you can be a hard worker.",
