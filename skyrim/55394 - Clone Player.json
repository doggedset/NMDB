  "summary": "Adds a power spell that clones the player. The clone has all your spells, shouts, stats and equipments, and will follow you.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new power to the player. This power creates a clone of the player, with same stats, spells, shouts, equipment, and controlled by the AI. The clone will follow you and will dissapear in an amount of time that can be configured in the MCM menu: default is 10 minutes, but you can change it, if set to 0, the clone is permanent until killed by the player.\r<br />\r<br />The clone player spell has a default cost of 90% health, 100% stamina and 100% magicka. But as of version 1.0, you can change that and fully remove the spell cost. Spell has a default cooldown of 24 ingame hours, but that can also be configured and removed in the MCM menu.\r<br />\r<br />The AI of the clone can be configured in the MCM menu: combat style, confidence, aggression, assistance and the radius at which the clone will follow the player.\r<br />The type of weapons, spells and items the clone will have can also be configured in the MCM Menu. \r<br />TIP: to make the clone have a particular fighting style, set the combat style in the AI page, and then change the weapons and spells section to match the fighting style.\r<br />\r<br />Clone can be updated at any time using the MCM menu or talking to the clone and selecting &#34;(Update clone)&#34; (dialogue requires that the option &#34;Can talk&#34; is checked in the config).\r<br />TIP: this is mainly useful for permanent clones. If you want to make your clone to match again the stats, weapons, spells, etc of the player, use the Update clone feature&#33; (Of course, configuration such as type of weapons, spells, etc will still apply).\r<br />\r<br />Clone can also be immediately removed through MCM menu or dialogue.\r<br />Clone has also some basic follower dialogue (these are independent of the vanilla dialog system).\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: SKSE and SkyUI\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Updating from 0.1/0.11 to 1.0: updating is safe, but make sure you don&#39;t have a clone.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Changelog 0.11 -&gt; 1.0\r<br />\r<br />- Fixed clone combat style reverting on load game.\r<br />- Fixed a possible condition of division by zero\r<br />- The health, stamina and magicka cost of the spell can now be changed in the MCM menu (set to 0 for no cost). Default health cost has been lowered from 98% to 90%.\r<br />- The cooldown of the spell can now be changed in the MCM menu from 24H cooldown to no cooldown.\r<br />- The lifetime of the clone can be now selected in the MCM menu. If 0, it will remain forever until it gets killed (clone is protected, so that means it can only be killed by the player). The default duration of the clone has been increased\r<br />from 5 to 10 minutes.\r<br />- The type of weapons the clone will have can now be selected in the &#34;Weapons&#34; page in the MCM menu. \r<br />- The type of spells (magic school) the clone will have can now be selected in the &#34;Spells&#34; page in the MCM menu.\r<br />- Added options to enable/disable the cloning of potions/venoms, scrolls, and &#34;other&#34; items.\r<br />- The following settings can now apply immediately to a current existing clone: &#34;Combat style&#34;, &#34;Can talk&#34;, &#34;Health percentage&#34;, &#34;Stamina percentage&#34; and &#34;Magicka percentage&#34;.\r<br />- The armor of the clone can now be updated at any time using the setting Armor-&gt;Clone current armor\r<br />- The clone stats, weapons, armor, items, spells, etc can now be updated using a MCM setting. This is mainly useful for permanent clones.\r<br />- Clone can be teleported to player in the MCM menu.\r<br />- Clone can now be removed immdeiately in the MCM menu.\r<br />- Some more AI settings can now be configured: &#34;Confidence&#34;, &#34;Aggression&#34; and &#34;Assistance&#34;. These settings also apply immediately to the current clone (if any).\r<br />- Radius at which the clone will follow the player can now be selected from a list in the AI page in the config (currently, 9 possible values)\r<br />- Some basic dialogue with clone: &#34;Wait&#34;, &#34;Follow&#34;, &#34;I need you to do something&#34;. Also, the clone can be removed and updated through dialogue (&#34;Dissapear&#33;, &#34;(Update)&#34; and &#34;(Update only armor)&#34;) Note:dialogue requires the &#34;Can talk&#34; setting checked.\r<br />- &#34;Can talk&#34; setting is now TRUE by default. Note: if you are updating from 0.1/0.11, this setting will have whatever value it had before (which was FALSE at default)\r<br />- Added a file under the optional section: &#34;Clone Player Dialogue Fix&#34;. It fixes the throw voices insult and the greybeard greeting from clone bug.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Optional file: Clone Player Dialogue Fix\r<br />[size=3][size=2]This is a fix for the &#34;throw voice&#34; insults and &#34;Dovahkiin&#34; [/size][/size][/size]greet of the clone. The reason why this is in a separate file is because it changes conditions of vanilla quests dialogues, and I want to keep the main file 100% free of vanilla edits.\r<br />The conditions change don&#39;t affect at all the game, it just fixes the conditions that made the clone do those things. This optional file has a single mod requirement: Unoficial Skyrim Patch. It doesn&#39;t need anything else, not even the main file of the mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Known issues: \r<br />\r<br />- If talk is enabled, the clone may insult the player (throw voice) or he may use the &#34;Dovahkiin&#34; greet of greybeards. See above for the Optional file that fixes this.\r<br />\r<br />- Black face. If you leave the game with alt+tab, and enter again, the clone may appear with black face. This usually disappears with fast travel, or just by exiting and starting the game again.\r<br />\r<br />- Some MCM options don&#39;t affect the current clone. As of 1.0, most options affect the current clone. \r<br />Some options like weapons, spells, will not, however, you can use the Update clone option in the MCM menu (or the clone dialogue option) and they will apply.\r<br />\r<br />- The clone takes time to appear. It is a technical limitation, the bottleneck is the player inventory size, the bigger, the more time it takes. Anyway, on my computer it doesn&#39;t take more than 15-20 seconds in worst case in a end game player with inventory full of junk.\r<br />\r<br />- If you kill the clone (with combat), and you are member of winterhold college, you will be expelled as if you had killed a member. TIP: if you want to get rid of the clone, use the &#34;Remove clone&#34; feature of MCM menu or dialogue, these ones don&#39;t have that bug.\r<br />\r<br />- Making yourself essential (by mods or console) will also make the clone essential. And viceversa.\r<br />\r<br />- The clone is able to use full shouts despite you not having some words of the shout. Likewise, it can use shouts you haven&#39;t unlocked yet. These are all technical limitations again.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall instructions: it is recommended that you remove the clone (if any) first. There is an option in the MCM and you can also make it disappear through dialogue.\r<br />\r<br />Once you are sure that the clone doesn&#39;t exist, just remove the esp. ",
