  "summary": "House #1 of this mod series. Iron Creek, a house revolving around any type of character, although fits nicely into a mage-type character.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]This is the first part of a series of mods which I have planned that introduce more player and NPC houses within the game, most likely a slow moving series since I\\'d like to release other mods in-between, of which I have a few ideas. \r\n\r\nThis is my first mod, it has been created with a very high level of desire for detail, however being my first mod, I\\'m open to a few bugs, please report anything you find that isn\\'t already a known issue.[/b]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/ppvds.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]House #1 - Iron Creek[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Iron Creek[/b] is a small house just behind Honningbrew Meadery, it belonged to Ranmir, a dark elf necromancer, however his necromancer status was a secret to the local citizens. When he heard of Hamvir\\'s Rest he jumped on the chance to improve his necromancy, what happens to him? You find out...\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n[b]Features[/b]\r\n\r\nGetting into the house does require a bit of work as it requires a key to get in to, as does the basement, this is all simply for immersion purposes, however, there is version without the need for any keys. [b]The house isn\\'t a huge mansion, more of a starter home.[/b] Since I\\'m new to creation kit, I don\\'t know how to make it so you have to buy the house from someone, hence the work needed to get the house. The house does have two chests, various other containers, an alchemy table and an enchantment table. There is also two bookshelves, one in the basement and one on the ground floor, as well a dagger display case.\r\n\r\nThe house can also be fast travelled to, after being discovered for the first time of course.\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\n\r\nYou can either use [b]NMM[/b] or;\r\n\r\nDownload a main file of your choice manually and extract into skyrim/Data folder.\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n[b]Known Issues[/b]\r\n\r\n- The house exterior might turn invisible sometimes, it\\'s an issue I\\'m fully aware of and as far as I know there isn\\'t much of a fix. If anyone knows of one, please tell me.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n[b]Patch History[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Version 1.0[/b]\r\nFull release\r\n",
