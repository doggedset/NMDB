  "descriptionHtml": "If you revere, endorse or at least like Sykrim please push the green endorse butty ^^\r\nAnd please feel free to add user uploaded images ;)\r\n-  -  - -\r\n\r\nA little lore: Witches were exekuted in the old times in the nord kontinent (irl!). Now with hi-tech technology it is time for retribution. (Even though it is probably just a simulator and not irl).\r\nSorceress Sykrim is akkused of being a Witch by the imperials. She is not a \\\"Witch\\\" she is a Sorceress. ...\r\n-\r\nYou start the game after the kharakter kreation, just after summoning a Shinryu dragon servant to save you from the IMPERIAL SCUMROLL trying to hurt Sykrim with a axe.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\ni Spent an hour to kreate the most beautiful & fierce Nord girl you kan kreate on Skyrim without mods.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the pikture does not show where you start. The HD video does! You start at the very beginning where it is possible to first save. (Of kourse that is if you choose to load the earliest save of the two save files provided.)\r\nTreat the sorceress well! She shall reign over the imperials & the \\\"Witchunters\\\"... With Galéttèas and Sorrowinds power and her Knights!\r\n\r\n\r\nPs. I did not even know about Skyrimnexus until know so it is guaranteed that this savefile uses no mods. Oh and you get 3 savefiles just in kase... But use the \\\"Save 2 - Sorceress Sykrim  Skyrim  01.09.44.ess\\\". The \\\"Save 6\\\" Sykrim has gained 1120 bounty after killing imperials and freeing a rebel. ^^ Like it is supposed to be ;) So up to you... Btw the Save 6 is my latest progress. So i am aktually letting u all download as far as i have gotten to in one day.\r\n\r\n\\'\r\n\\'\r\n \\'\r\n \\'\r\n\\'\\'\r\n\\'\r\n\r\nOther DLs:\r\n\r\nMorrowind ...\r\nNordic Bond:\r\nAsmaragda is a Nord girl presently residing in Morrowind. She is related Sykrim =) She is a Fierce & Beautiful Nord just like Sykrim ;)\r\nIf you like Sykrim and want a similiar looking girl for Morrowind then search \\\"Asmaragda\\\" in a search engine ;)\r\n\r\nDoing this since i will kreate a new kharakter possibly a boy or a elf girl :)\r\n\r\n*Updae: \r\n\r\n\r\nNord Alexander The GF\r\nhttp://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=485\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha_6y30oDMM\r\n\r\nThis is how it went for the Altmer girl (My 1st ever 2nd girl in Skyrim):\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGfpr99O49Y\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEnjoice! =D\r\nDo not forget to En=Dorse Sykrim :D (Dual smiley!)",
