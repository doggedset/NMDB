  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#e06666][size=3][b]30/6/2017 I hereby give permission for other modders and content creators to use these tweaked textures as they see fit. They can give credit if they want, though 70% of what I did was just creative photoshopping so I wouldn&#39;t feel right demanding credit. Mods belong to the community as far as I&#39;m concerned. I hadn&#39;t made such a statement regarding usage permissions until now because I thought it was implied, but better late than never, right? So yeah, use however.[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />--A NOTE--\r<br />The Fennec race mod appears to only be distributed as a packed .bsa now, so you need to unpack it to get at the files to replace. I&#39;ll see about making a .bsa replacer, but I&#39;ve never done those before so you&#39;ll have to be patient.\r<br />\r<br />Also I removed the Lover&#39;s Lab links. Apparently LL links are no bueno on Nexus, so you&#39;ll have to google those yourselves, sorry :/\r<br />--A NOTE--\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Male and female nude textures for the Fennec custom race found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62176/?]here[/url], recompiled for compatibility with Schlongs Of Skyrim and Calientes Beautiful Bodies Edition. I don&#39;t know how to do FOMOD packages yet, so for now you&#39;ll have to manually swap the files.\r<br />\r<br />The male texture is at:\r<br />&lt;skyrim install location&gt;/data/textures/actors/character/foxmale/foxmalebody.dds\r<br />The female texture is at:\r<br />&lt;skyrim install location&gt;/data/textures/actors/character/foxfemale/femalebody.dds\r<br />\r<br />Tested and compatible with:\r<br />\r<br />-Schlongs of SkyrimÂ &#34;normal&#34; body (should be compatible with bodybuilder mesh, untested)\r<br />-[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?]Calientes Beautiful Bodies Edition[/url] &#34;slim&#34; body (should be compatible with all, untested)\r<br />-[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54044/?]HDT Breast & Butt Physics[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Compatible and very highly recommended:\r<br />\r<br />-BadDog&#39;s Compleat Khajiit\r<br />-[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50637/?]XPMSE True Digitigrade Beast Race skeleton[/url]\r<br />-[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58165/?]HDT Tails[/url] (if you use the XPMSE digitigrade skeleton above, you&#39;ll need a patched version, it&#39;s an annoying spine node issue that leaves tails hovering in the air. For convenience I included a patched .nif replacer for the standard fox tail.)\r<br />\r<br />It should also be compatible with most other meshes and body replacers (such as UNP) so let me know if you find anything it [i]isn&#39;t[/i] compatible with and I&#39;ll see if I can update it to fix that.\r<br />\r<br />[s]KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES:\r<br />&#34;Furry Age Of Skyrim&#34; player appears fine, but NPC Fennecs turn invisible. If anybody knows a workaround please let me know and I&#39;ll post it.\r<br />[/s]Fixed itself, cause still unknown.",
