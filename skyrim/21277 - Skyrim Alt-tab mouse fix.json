  "summary": "This mod fixes the recent problem of the windows mouse cursor showing up in game as well as the game one, especially after alt-tab",
  "descriptionHtml": "1.1: Removed nomousy.exe, it was buggy and replaced it with my own ahk script. This should be the one and only update.\r\n1.2: Fixed mild race condition, set timeout for sbw.exe so you no longer have to wait 15 seconds.\r\n1.3: Removed previous timeout thing - was breaking for some people, added a version that doesn\\'t use SBW, so you can just use it with fullscreen skyrim.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS MOD USES:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4\r\n\r\nBasically what this mod is, is a launcher script for skyrim, that fixes the problem of the windows mouse cursor appearing as well as the skyrim in-game cursor.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\nSet skyrim to run in windowed mode, and set the resolution correct.\r\nCopy the files into your main skyrim folder - not the data folder.\r\n\r\nSBW will select the right launcher exe (skse or not), depending on whether you have the file in your skyrim dir, so don\\'t worry about that.\r\nIf you use the non SBW version, it will just launch skse. If you\\'re not using that - do! it\\'s great :3\r\n\r\nRun Launch.bat to launch the game, SBW will remove the window border, if it isn\\'t, it should do when you press alt-space.\r\nWhen you are in game, it will disable the windows cursor, and when you alt tab out, it will reenable it. The one and only disadvantage of this is that you have no mouse cursor for the steam in-game overlay.\r\nIf you get errors relating to getwindowtitle.exe, it is c sharp, so make sure you have the dot net framework installed (7 users should by default).\r\n\r\nTo add it as a non-steam game, add any old exe, then right click->properties, change target to point to Launch.bat. You needn\\'t worry about the \\\"Start in\\\" directory, the script will cd to the right place anyway.\r\n\r\nNote for the paranoid:\r\nThere are three exes in this mod, one of which come from the source I posted at the top of this page. getwindowtitle.exe is a c sharp program that I \\\"wrote\\\" myself - the source is from this stackoverflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/115868/how-do-i-get-the-title-of-the-current-active-window-using-c It just prints the title of the currently selected window, so if you\\'re really paranoid you can compile it yourself.\r\nmouse.exe is an autohotkey script I wrote - source mostly from here: http://ask.metafilter.com/85312/How-to-hide-mouse-cursor\r\nThe ahk file is also uploaded, if you really want to take a look.",
