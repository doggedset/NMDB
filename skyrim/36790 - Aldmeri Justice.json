  "descriptionHtml": "Do you hate the Thalmor and the Dominion? Are you the Sneaky Type? If you said yes to any of those two questions this is the mod for you! In this mod you\\'ll be going to Northwatch Keep to find this new weapon. Formerly in the possession of a Thalmor Soldier, \\\"Aldmeri Justice\\\" is an Elven Dagger that has improved stats, and an enchantment.\r\n\r\nSTATS\r\n\r\nBase damage of 15, this casts a Soul Trap effect for 8 seconds whilst also doing Fire Damage for 15 points. It has reasonable amount of charge, just be careful. So that makes this the perfect weapon for any thief or assassin type character.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nUse NMM (Nexus Mod Manager) - it\\'s just easier, be lazy.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nThis hasn\\'t got a retexture, it just has improved stats.",
