  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#ff7700][size=3]THIS ARMOR IS INCORPORATED INTO ANNA NPCS.\r<br />IF YOU YOU USE BOTH, THERE WON&#39;T BE CONFLICT, BUT YOU&#39;LL SEE TWO SETS OF THE ARMOR AT FORGES.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=+2][color=#ffff99][b]Linda Armor & Weapon Set[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]wrdbb0skGD0[/youtube]\r<br />Thanks to Hodilton for the video[/center]\r<br />\r<br />Here is the lovely armor worn by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48918/?]Nadina[/url] by Anna Castiglioni.  This armor was created by Shrikebot and given permission to be used in the companion mod and now published as a separate file, a sort of &#34;Nadina Special&#34; :)\r<br />\r<br />This is a set of armor and weapons based on the Nord Hero armor and weapons which you can create at the Skyforge after completing the Companions questline.  Linda Armor and weapons can be created at any forge with no prerequisite.  The armor is FEMALE ONLY.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff99][b]Q & A:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]What is included in this set?[/i]\r<br />Armor: Top, Skirt, Boots, Bracers\r<br />Accessories:  Amulet, Ring, Left-hand Ring, Circlet, Armbands\r<br />Weapons:  Bow, Arrows\r<br />\r<br />[i]How do I create these items?[/i]\r<br />Simply go up to any forge and look under &#34;Draugr.&#34;  All items are in that category.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Which body slots are used?[/i]\r<br />A few body slots are used besides the usual (boots, bracers, amulet, ring).\r<br />The top and skirt are separate pieces, rather than a single &#34;cuirass.&#34;\r<br />Top: 32 (Body)\r<br />Skirt: 49\r<br />Armbands: 59\r<br />Left-hand ring: 60\r<br />\r<br />[i]Why no male version?[/i]\r<br />I don&#39;t know, why not ask [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/853528/?]Shrike[/url]?\r<br />\r<br />[i]Which bodies does it work with?[/i]\r<br />The armor was created using the standard Skyrim body.  I believe that is the UNP model.  However, it also fits CBBE slim perfectly so I would assume it fits others as well, but I cannot attest to it.  You would need to ask Shrike.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff99][b]Conflicts:[/b][/color]\r<br />Potentially any mod that uses the same body slots.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff99][b]Credits:[/b][/color]\r<br />Full credits to Shrikebot for creation of armor and weapons (I just made this page&#33;)\r<br />I am rather fond of this set since Shrike kindly sent me progress pics as he created it, so I sort of feel like I was &#34;there&#34; during the creation process :)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff99][b]Permissions:[/b][/color]\r<br />Shrikebot supports open source sharing, and grants permission for anyone to do with this mod what they like, as long as you give him credit.\r<br />He also asks not to post this mod on Steam.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff99][b]Mods that feature Linda Armor:[/b][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48918/?]Nadina Companion[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51342/?]Anna NPCs[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff99][b]Shrike&#39;s other Mods:[/b][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37371/?]Slaughterfish Nemesis[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38465/?]Island Fast Travel[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38374/?]Faalskar Fast Travel[/url]",
