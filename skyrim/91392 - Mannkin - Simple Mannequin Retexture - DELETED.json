  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]Meet Mannkin! The most simple and basic retexture on the face of the Earth. \n<br />\n<br />Basically all I did is tinker with the color values and contrast to come up with this \"dusted off\" look. I did not seem to find any other retextures that pleased me so I made my own - I figure I might as well share it. YES I KNOW the point of them is to show off your armor, not the mannequin texture themselves, but I like to see a pretty man smile through his armor. \n<br />\n<br />Right now it is only for the male model. I understand that this is a retexure that anyone could make but considering I could not find any that seemed to look nice with my ENB, what's the harm with throwing him out there? Also he is a very handsome man please be nice to him.\n<br />\n<br />[i]No ENB required, though! I use Re-Engaged NAT but it looks fine without an ENB too! :)[/i][/size]",
