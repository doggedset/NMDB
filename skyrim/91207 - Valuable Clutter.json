  "summary": "Increases the value of stuff you can steal in rich people's houses and dwemer ruins, making them worth looting",
  "descriptionHtml": "\"Valuable Clutter\" is a very basic hackjob plugin that increases the value of silver and dwemer jugs, bowls, plates, platters, etc. by 10. A Silver Bowl that was worth 5 gold is now worth 50 gold, and so on. This is to ensure that, when you break into a rich person's house, you will be able to loot all their silverware and sell it to a fence, in order to make at least some money, in case you aren't skilled enough to open lockboxes yet.\n<br />\n<br />Does not require any DLC\n<br />Does not include items from DLC\n<br />Will conflict with mods that change the stats of silver or dwemer clutter",
