  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]Version 3.0 Now featuring a Ultra High Definition Version of the armor[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nNew in this version is a increase of texture resolution from 512x512 ~> 2048x2048 with the main armor originally 1024x1024 increased to 4096x4096.\r\n\r\nMale/Female Included\r\nSaturated/DeSaturated Available\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0 will remain as \\\"optional downloads\\\" for those wanting the color/scale scheme change without cramping your video cards VRAM. Although keep in mind, they do not have any additional enhancements.\r\n\r\nAs always, Love the critique and comments, and of course endorsements drive me to further improve as i continue to learn more about what i\\'m doing.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n[u][b]Shameless Plug[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nMy other List of Projects that will likely grow:\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4408]Ultra High Definition Enhanced Vanilla Dragons[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Old Boring Stuff from before[/b][/u]\r\nAfter being rather unimpressed with the orginal DragonScale armor set... just way to bland... and rather missing a lot in terms of wantin something that looked like some dragon you can kill in the game. I first came here to look at what our options are.... and unfortunately wasn\\'t quite impressed with the rather simplistic recoloring and some of the other things people did to \\\"enhance\\\" the excisting sets...\r\n\r\nWhile i didn\\'t spend a WHOLE lot of time, but a sufficient amount to say, most of it just trying to isolate the specific portions of the armor to reskin, without changing the OTHER parts of it.. like hte metal and fabric parts...... to stay somewhat true to the orginal.... it was just a matter of taking the dragon skin (from dragonboss) for refference for this specific one... to overlay it..\r\n\r\nNow without actually replacing the alphas and other lighting properties to match, i mearly overlayed it ontop of the excisting texture so that things still matched up and didn\\'t look completely wrong in game..\r\n\r\nThe color is enhanced so that it doesn\\'t look pail and washed out either....\r\n\r\nFinal product... just version 2.0..... i may make changes later....\r\n\r\nGo easy on me... first time doing something like this.. took me awhile to first out how to unpack the orginals and start editing.\r\n\r\nI decided to fix up the readme so it was a little more presentable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]ReadMe File as found in the latest File[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n+~~~~~======-----------------------------------------======~~~~~+\r\n+~~~~~======---Judas\\'s UHD Dragon BOSS Dragonscale---======~~~~~+\r\n+~~~~~======-----------------------------------------======~~~~~+\r\n\r\n+~~~~~======---------------VERSION 3.0---------------======~~~~~+\r\n\r\n+Made an Ultra High Definition with More Defining Detail\r\n+Enhanced Color without overdriving the Saturation...
