  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]This is a conversion of UNP Spice Gear to CBBE bodies. One of the best vanilla armor overhauls. Originally created by Tiwa44, also hosted for SSE by Gothpunk4Christ.\n<br />\n<br />Check out their stuff here:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68028]UNP Spice Gear Collection by Tiwa44\n<br />[/url]﻿[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11687]UNP and UNPB Spice Gear Collection by Gothpunk4Christ\n<br />[/url]﻿\n<br />These great people have granted me permission to use their work and thus I went ahead and tweaked some things in bodyslide. It took a lot of coffee and nerves and time but it's done. It's done. Enjoy.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]FEATURES[/b]\n<br />[size=3]-Replacer for vanilla armors\n<br />-All vanilla armors (no clothing) remade for a more sexy look\n<br />-Full bodyslide support included\n<br />-Weights placed where appropriate[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]INSTALLATION[/b]\n<br />[size=3]-Download and install with a mod manager of your choice\n<br />-Alternatively download and extract the mod to Skyrim's data folder[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]RECOMMENDED MODS[/b]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24909][size=3]aMidianBorn Book of Silence[/size]\n<br />[/url][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13207]CBP Physics\n<br />[/url]﻿[/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64981][size=3]A Closer Look[/size]\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[b]FAQ[/b]\n<br />[size=3]-Why no clothing?\n<br />It will be uploaded as a separate mod like the original.\n<br />\n<br />-How do I bodyslide?\n<br />1) Install bodyslide\n<br />2) Install my mod\n<br />3) Open bodyslide, choose groups (top middle) and select CBBE Spice Gear Full\n<br />4) Pick a body preset you like\n<br />5) Click Batch Build (with ctrl if you want a custom directory!)\n<br />6) Add the newly built meshes to the game and enjoy\n<br />\n<br />-No Gigist that's too hard help :(\n<br />You don't need to use bodyslide. I've prebuilt the armors in CBBE curvy so you can just DL the mod and play.\n<br />\n<br />-They don't jiggle?\n<br />Solid metal doesn't jiggle but the more bikini-style armors will. I added weights to the armors where I felt it was natural. If there's a lot of demand for a full jiggly setup I can revisit the armors. The clothing (Minidresses mod) will bounce naturally.\n<br />\n<br />-I see clipping.\n<br />Uh MAYBE. I spent a week learning and tweaking stuff and in the end I scrapped my near week long work and rebuilt the thing from scratch. I didn't go through every armor using all kinds of angles to test the clipping. I'll update the set as I go. Post a comment and I can check out the worst offenders. Mostly they should be fine already.\n<br />\n<br />-Why always a FAQ?\n<br />Idk. All the cool kids got one so I wanted one too.\n<br />\n<br />-Is this where we begin to chat and not actually do a real FAQ?\n<br />Usually yeah.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b]PERMISSIONS[/b]\n<br />None granted.
