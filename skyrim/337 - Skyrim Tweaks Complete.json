  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=4.5][u]Skyrim Tweaks[/u][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n[b][color=red]NOTICE:[/color][/b] This is severely outdated, I will update all files, images and description next week with my own tweaked set of ini\\'s, and a full hex edit of TESV.exe containing every setting, function, command etc in the game\\'s engine.\r\n\r\n[size=2.5]This is set of pre-tweaked TES: Skyrim.ini & SkyrimPrefs.ini (C:\\\\Users\\\\\\\"PC Name\\\"\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim) to max the game\\'s detail/visual settings whilst minimising the fps drop.\r\n\r\nWhat this aims to do in a nutshell, is to make the game look better than it does on default ultra, whilst providing better frame rate than the ultra setting, and little or no stuttering.\r\n\r\nBackup your ini files before tweaking.\r\n\r\nI [b]STRONGLY[/b] recommend taking out of it what you would like to utilize/use, and add them in your own ini. Recommended application for viewing/editing the ini files is [url=http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v5.9.6.2.html]Notepad++[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso a given that you can already run skyrim at max settings hardware-wise plus have at least 4gb\\'s of ram, preferably 6, 8gb, but would like it to look its best whilst maintaining as much fps as possible.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve been testing these tweaks for the past while and have been very happy with the results, so I thought I would share them for anyone who may be interested. Have fun, and enjoy.\r\n[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]\r\nWhat a few of the main tweaks do: (I\\'ve excluded the well known ones here)[/size]\r\n[size=2]\r\n1: uExterior Cell Buffer - loads more cells into memory to reduce stuttering on the world map.\r\n2: bUseThreadedParticleSystem=1\r\n    bUseThreadedBlood=1\r\n    bUseThreadedMorpher=1\r\n    bUseThreadedTempEffects=1\r\n    bUseThreadedParticleSystem=1\r\n    bUseThreadedTextures=1\r\n    bUseThreadedMeshes=1\r\n    bUseThreadedLOD=1\r\n    bUseThreadedAI=1 - these split the rendering processes, and order them in threads.\r\n\r\n3: bEquippedTorchesCastShadows=1 - torches/flames cast shadows.\r\n4: bActorSelfShadowing=1 - loads shadows on character\\'s geometry (body)\r\n5: bDynamicWindowReflections=1 - window lighting change at time of day.\r\n6: iActorShadowIntMax=12 - increase the amount of actor shadows inside, as fps is usually much higher in doors.\r\n7: bGrassPointLighting=1\r\n    bDrawShaderGrass=1  - increases the lighting detail of grass.\r\n8: iMaxDesired=5000 - increases the particles to render on screen for smoke, spell effects, lighting, snow etc.\r\n\r\n9: bEnableTreeAnimations=1- Trees gain lighting animation, and the sway in the wind is more noticable.\r\n    bUseMultiThreadedTrees=1 Render trees in multiple cpu threads.\r\n10: bBackgroundLoadLipFiles=1\r\n     bLoadBackgroundFaceGen=1\r\n     bUseMultiThreadedFaceGen=1\r\n     bBackgroundCellLoads=1 - loads object files in the background before the game loads to reduce stuttering from the game dynamically loading it as you walk (this one is not fully tested, but works in other bethesda games)\r\n \r\n11: bAllowLoadGrass=1 - Force All Grass types are loaded \r\n12: fMagnetismStrafeHeadingMult=0.0 - Crosshair \\'auto aim\\' when strafing/moving horizontally \r\n13: fMagnetismLookingMult=0.0 - Crosshair \\'auto aim\\' factor, vertically\r\n14: iMaxAllocatedMemoryBytes=4000000000 an attempt to extend the available memory addressing allocated\r\n15: bPreemptivelyUnloadCells=0 - If set to 1, this setting attempts to unload cell data it thinks you won\\'t need. This can help those with very low ram (shouldn\\'t be using any tweaks if you do have a low amount of ram), leave it at 0 for reduced stuttering, ie it won\\'t drop what it has loaded, until the space is needed for something else.\r\n16: bRunHighLevelProcess=1 - Attempts to force TESIV.exe as a \\'high\\' priority process, this is conjoined with +fullproc\r\n  \r\n17: bMTRendering=1 - multithreaded rendering \r\n18: bUseEyeEnvMapping=1 - is to make sure that ncps\\' are \\'looking\\' at the flagged object they\\'re supposed to be (is an eye mapping bug atm) and this can solve it.\r\n19: bFaceMipMaps=1 - attempts to use lod mipmaps for npc characters in the distance to increase fps.\r\n20: bFaceGenTexturing=1 - this is not needed, but it tries to ensure that all npc in your fov are forced full lod in the full lod region, depending on what your lod dist fade is.\r\n display: \r\n22: bPerPixelLighting=1 - attempts to force per pixel lighting, aposed to per vertex.\r\n23: bEnablePerPixelLighting=1 - enables it, above forces. \r\n24: bAllow30Shaders=1 - ensures 3.0 shaders are in use, not needed as they are by default, but this makes sure it doesn\\'t default to a lower shader model.\r\n25: bDo30VFog=1 SM 3.0 fog rendering \r\n26: bDoTallGrassEffect=1 - uses slightly larger grass rendering, best used with iMinGrassSize to increase rendered amount also.\r\n27: bLandscapeBlend=1 - increases blending on distant lod landscape. \r\n28: bFloatPointRenderTarget=1 - More accurate lighting by using floating point verc\\'s/points instead of only int values, can cost 1-2 frames, but i personally think it worth it.\r\n\r\n [/size]\r\n[size=2.5]\r\n[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]\r\nTo copy & paste [b]NOT Recommended[/b] (Recommended to add the tweaks to your own ini\\'s, rather then copy/paste)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to just place it in place of your own one, a few things you may need to edit is your GPU adapter\\'s name, the resolution(if applicable), and language of your game, and personal settings, such as subtitles etc, \r\n\r\nTo change sD3DDevice=\\\"AMD Radeon HD 6900 Series in  \\\"  Skyrimprefs to sD3DDevice=\\\"and include your own GPU indentifier \\\", which can be found by typing dxdiag into windows search and in the display tab, see your adapter name, and use that.  Resolution is in Skyrimprefs [Display], and game language is in Skyrim.ini at the very first line of the ini file.\r\n\r\n[b]You will also need to edit the [Archive] section of Skyrim.ini to match your current ini. In case you don\\'t have the HD texture pack, and fix installed.[/b]\r\n\r\nIf you deside you want or prefere your own one, just copy paste your own back into the location folder, or delete the ini\\'s and the game will create new ones on loadup.\r\n\r\n[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]\r\nAlso, to utilize more of your CPU\\'s power, you can also use the .exe launcher tweak. (Yes, it works)\r\n\r\nIf running the game through steam: \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n1: Right-click the steam taskbar icon (bottom right by your clock, network icon), and click library.\r\n2: scroll to Skyrim, and right click it. Then go to properties.\r\n3: In the general tab, click \\'set launcher options\\' and in the text field type +fullproc and click ok.\r\n\r\nIf running the game locally, without steam:\r\n\r\n1: Right-click the desktop shortcut, and go to properties.\r\n2: In the target field (should have something similar to \\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\SkyrimLauncher.exe\\\" click the end of the string, (after the .exe\\\") and press the space bar, and type +fullproc\r\n3: click apply and exit.\r\n\r\nThe +fullproc is like manually tabbing out of the game everytime you run skyrim, to increase it\\'s CPU priority to its highest, but this does it automatically everytime you run the game. My CPU usage went from 30-40% peak, to 50% peak usage with this, this being its 100% utilizing 2 full cores, of a quad-core CPU. The main point of this particular tweak is to flag the Skyrim process as a high priority task to keep your min, and avg fps up to help reduce stuttering.\r\n\r\nCheck the comments section for frequently asked questions.\r\n[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]\r\n[u]My CCC Settings:[/u]\r\nAA - Use app setting, filter - Edge Detect\r\nAF - Force x16\r\nTessellation - AMD Optimized (makes no difference as skyrim doesn\\'t use it, d3d9)\r\nCatalyst A.I - High Quality & Enable Surface Optimization. \r\nVSync - always on - preferance only \r\nAA Mode - 2x SSAA \r\nTriple Buffering - Enabled.
