  "descriptionHtml": "Located at the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm\r\n\r\n\r\nShelonah is a female dark elf follower for anyone in need of some simple unique or new followers. I am VERY new to modding and most likely followers would be the most I can handle for at least the time being, but if anyone would like to request a follower to be made let me know and I\\'ll would be happy to help. I liked her facial design and she was fun to have around on my personal save so I decided to distribute. But she is as simple as it gets and I would like to update her in the future, but my current skills do not allow it.  ",
