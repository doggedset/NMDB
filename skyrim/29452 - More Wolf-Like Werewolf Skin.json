  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]PCrciWDW92Y[/youtube]\r\nVideo created by BDMods! Thanks, guys :)\r\n\r\nEDIT X3: Changed the filename since some people have been giving me flak on \\\"more realistic\\\"... you know what I meant, guys ;P\r\n\r\nEDIT X2: Added 3 more colors for a total of six, and three new eye colors. Also added an Automatic Variants package!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Added 2 more colors per request :)  Blonde and Brown now up for download as well! Thanks for the feedback, you guys!\r\n\r\nJust what it says on the tin! I wasn\\'t satisfied with the other options out there, so I painted my own. Fairly high-res texture, modeled to look more like your average grey wolf. First Skyrim texture edit, worked from Bellyache\\'s hairier werewolves texture found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3621",
