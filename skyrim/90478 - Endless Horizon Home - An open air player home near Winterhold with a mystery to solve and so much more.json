  "modName": "Endless Horizon Home - An open air player home near Winterhold with a mystery to solve and so much more",
  "summary": "Endless Horizon Home is a lore friendly open air player home with everything you need for crafting and so much more. It requires that you solve a mystery to find out how to get inside and once inside you will discover beauty and many fun activities. Night time can be the most magical visual experience. Level 30+ is required to solve the mystery.",
  "descriptionHtml": "After a high ranking master disappeared from the College of Winterhold, a curious student took the time to write a book about all the clues surrounding the mystery. It has yet to be solved. \n<br />\n<br />Will you be the one to finally solve the mystery of Indelious Mephestros?\n<br />\n<br />To start the mod, go and read the book titled \"The mystery of Indelious Mephestros.\" It can be easily found on the desk of the librarian in The Arcanium.\n<br />\n<br />This mod only uses Bethesda assets so no other mods are needed. [color=#ff0000][size=4][b]You will need the Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLC's.[/b]\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />This mod has no quest scripts and therefore, no quest markers. All my scripts are trigger box and equipment based.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ffff00][size=4]Look for hints in the sticky post if you get stuck![/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />- Plenty of safe storage and every crafting station you should need. \n<br />\n<br />-This home is mage based and has a touch of madness from Sheogorath so there are no child beds. The games I created inside are plenty to keep you busy!\n<br />\n<br />-Incredible sunsets and sunrises. All the images were taken with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83091]Antique Dragon ENB[/url]\n<br />\n<br />-A ton of idle markers and things never seen before to watch your followers and enjoy.  Wait until you see the pool!\n<br />\n<br />-Intricate lighting system at night and not a roof in sight!\n<br />\n<br />-Lore friendly in my opinion and works great with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281]Requiem[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36849]Immersive College of Winterhold\n<br />[/url]\n<br />-Place this mod after Immersive College of Winterhold in your load order. Place above Requiem.\n<br />\n<br />-Fully hand nav meshed and cleaned with TES5Edit.\n<br />\n<br />I strongly recommend [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4955/?]83Willow's 101 Bugs HD mod[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c27ba0][size=4][b]Get the SSE version[/b] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16267/]HERE[/url][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=4]Spanish translation by LatinGames is[/size][/color][/b] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90740/]HERE[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][b][size=4]**** VERY IMPORTANT!!! Do [u]NOT[/u] place the 2 staffs you will find in the mod into any display racks!! Store them in your inventory or a container only or the scripts on them will not work! ****[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />I'm so excited to be able to release this mod on April fools! It being Easter is a plus as well with how many Easter eggs this mod contains!\n<br />\n<br />There will be a sticky post as with all my mods with all text so it can be easily translated and some hints will follow! I will be happy to make a more vram friendly version if there is a need. Please let me know what you think in the comments!\n<br />\n<br />This was a one week idea that turned into two months of work. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did in creating it.\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]aW0MRJ9GgVs[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />Check out my other mods!\n<br />\n<br />[b] Starter dungeon [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76391/?]Cave of the Forgotten[/url]\n<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/HjVNuL][img]https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7113/27124821764_cf333c996c.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />Mannimarco horror dungeon [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/87050/?]Depths of Fear[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/YVMS6G][img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4411/37364701866_434709959a.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />New world space adventure [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80086/?]Crater of Exile[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/NRo2uE][img]https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5824/30751217122_53df48be8d_z.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[b][b]Island mod with a follower: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75137/?]Isle of Ashes[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/FwFxM1][img]https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1575/25945125094_cafc86e3e2_z.jpg[/img][/url][/b]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[b]Large dungeon with a follower [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72907/?]Hope's Abandon[/url]\n<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/D7uPXt][img]https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1534/24358723853_5a66a6a87d_z.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />[/b][b]Other follower mods: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/93385/]Aria Frostwhisper 2.0[/url]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/NwmQ6E][img]https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1898/30535970248_4049e69e32_z.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/93000/?tab=posts]\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/93000]Shenmi[/url]\n<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/21L9nPP][img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4573/38568252681_d8e31fbfd7.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[/url]\n<br />      [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70840/?]Lady Jocelyn[/url]\n<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/zUH9oU][img]https://farm1.staticflickr.com/748/22256258968_f2b05eb807_z.jpg[/img][/url]",
