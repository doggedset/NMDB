  "descriptionHtml": "I wanted to try editing textures, this happened. (Sorry it took so long to upload. My browser decided to crash half-way through the process and my upload speed isn\\'t the greatest.)\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a warhammer, mace, sword, and bow. They are all vanilla meshes with altered textures by me. \r\n\r\nThe warhammer is based on overwhelming power and burning the enemy\r\n(Based on vanilla Steel Warhammer)\r\n\r\nThe sword is based on moving easily and slicing through the enemy\r\n(Based on vanilla Dwarven Sword)\r\n\r\nThe bow is based on being able to strike from anywhere\r\n(Based on vanilla Glass Bow)\r\n\r\nThe mace is based on slow, powerful movements crushing the enemy (it seems a tad overpowered to me, though, I only tested it out on some bandits, some wolves and a spriggan), and is the hardest to find.\r\n(Based on vanilla Orcish Mace)\r\n\r\nThe images show the weapons and their locations (no directions).\r\n\r\nthey should be upgradeable with the same materials as the vanilla weapons these are based on, since I just edited duplicates of the vanilla weapons. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\nCheck out my player home:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17081",
