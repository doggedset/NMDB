  "descriptionHtml": "Sun Strike is an Expert level Restoration spell that does sun fire damage to undead. \r<br />\r<br />I was a little frustrated that there was no restoration spell for dealing damage to undead higher than Vampires Bane, which becomes fairly useless at higher levels.\r<br />\r<br />Sun Strike follows on from the &#34;Sun Fire&#34; and &#34;Vampire&#39;s Bane&#34; spells, and has a cost and power rating similar to that of &#34;Incinerate&#34; from the Destruction school.\r<br />\r<br />The Spell Tome has been added to the leveled lists, and can be bought from Colette in the College of Winterhold once the player&#39;s restoration skill has reached a high enough level.\r<br />\r<br />Needless to say, this requires the DAWNGUARD DLC to work.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy",
