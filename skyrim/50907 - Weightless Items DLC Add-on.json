  "summary": "This mod adds some of the missed items in the original Weightless Items mod and adds compatibility for the official DLCs.",
  "descriptionHtml": "As a long time fan of the Weightless Items mod, I have always been frustrated by the few items (Centurion Dynamo Core, Linen Wraps, Mammoth Tusks) that are missing as well as the lack of DLC support.\r<br />\r<br />Finally, the OCD became too much, giving birth to this mod.  This will make Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn potions, ingredients, and numerous misc items weightless.\r<br />\r<br />Simply place at the end of your load order.  Requires Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn.  \r<br />\r<br />While you can use this mod without the Weightless Items mod, doing so makes no sense.  This was designed to work with that mod, which can be found here:  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1622/?",
