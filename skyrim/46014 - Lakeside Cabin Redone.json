  "summary": "This is a reworked model of my previous mod, Lakeside Cabin. This new version adds many features and details that were lacking from the original.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Introduction:\r\nThis mod adds a lore friendly player home adjacent to the river running past Riverwood on the opposite side. It is easily accessible early on in the game to benefit new players.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nI'm sure that I'm not the only one tired of lugging around all of the weapons and dragon bones that you obtain early on in the game; so what I've done is added a new player home that isn't too far from all of the key point that you'll be visiting as a low level player.\r\nAlthough it is conveniently placed near Riverwood, it still acts as a secluded home for the people who don't like living in the hectic cities whilst still having access to traders nearby.\r\nThe Cabin has many of the features that a player will need from time to time, including a tanning rack, workbench, cooking pot and enchanting table; as well as a few things that will come in handy, such as a personal garden, mannequin and a few gold bars for the people who would like a early on boost! Although it is not the biggest of homes there is still plenty of storage without it loosing its feel of a cozy cabin :)\r\n\r\nIt is fully Nav-Meshed (Follower friendly) and doesn't require any of the DLCs.\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nThe cabin is located just up the river from Riverwood on the opposite side of the lake. Use the screen-shots for further detail.\r\n\r\nIf you like what you see in this mod and appreciate the amount of effort that I have put into it then share it with friends, family and pretty much anyone who plays Skyrim :P\r\nDon't forget to endorse if you like it :)\r\nLeave a comment!\r\n-NOLIF3",
