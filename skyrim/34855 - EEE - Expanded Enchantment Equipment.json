  "descriptionHtml": "Expanded Enchantment Equipment (EEE)\r\n\r\nMaster Files: Skyrim.esm\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBy: Zutra (aka Mesh)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA simple mod that expands the options for enchantments on certain items. Now you can\r\nenchant nearly all equipable clothes, rings armor, with any enchantment you wish on\r\nit. Works with almost all vanilla enchantments and equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Install: Download with NMM and activate it. Or download manually, and put the esp in:\r\nC:\\\\\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\\\\\Steam\\\\\\\\SteamApps\\\\\\\\common\\\\\\\\Skyrim\\\\\\\\Data\r\n\r\nTo use: simply grab your favorite peice of clothing, or jewlery, and enchant it at any enchantment table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that this only works for any Fortify/Resist enchantment, Muffle, Waterbreathing, \r\nHealth/Magicka/Stamina and regen enchantments. The only limitations are your enchantment\r\nskill level and your currently used Soul Gem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMod Conflicts: Any mod that modifies the FormLists of vanilla enchantments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Modders:\r\n\r\n\tKeywords that work in the Creation Kit:\r\n\r\n\t\tArmorBoots\r\n\t\tArmorClothing (this works for all keywords with the prefix: Clothing as well)\r\n\t\tArmorDarkBrotherhood\r\n\t\tArmorGaunlets\r\n\t\tArmorHeavy\r\n\t\tArmorHelmet\r\n\t\tArmorJewlery\r\n\t\tArmorLight\r\n\t\tArmorNighingale\r\n\t\tArmorShield\r\n\r\n\tAny new equipment that have these keywords, should work just fine with\r\nthe vanilla enchantments. New enchantments needs them added through the FormLists\r\nthats attatched to your custom enchantment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny questions, comments? Anything I may have missed?
