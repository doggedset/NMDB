  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds 20+ Companions from Tactic\\'s Ogre and Ogre Battle. Two of my favorite games from childhood, and a cast of characters that many RPG gamers loved.\r\n\r\nI have re-released this mod as some people have requested for me to revive it. It has been updated with new perks for companions and aesthetics (hair).\r\n-Added a red-hair color mod for the redheads (This cast was very redhead heavy)\r\n-Deneb as requested is now a redhead and not a blonde (with new hair she now looks much nicer).\r\n-Lightfoot perk for all companions (hopefully I never missed anyone).\r\n-A few new hairstyles for some companions.\r\n\r\nWorking on:\r\n-Adding more Ogre Battle companions.\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWARNING:\r\n*The style of characters/faces that I enjoy is certainly not the same preference as everyone, you must decide what types of face mods you want to use.\r\n\r\n*Any derogatory/abusive or \\\"out of line\\\" comments will be reported. Please be constructive in comments.\r\n\r\n*I am open to suggestions/requests for new characters to be added... ask and you shall receive as I am always open to new character ideas.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nNow you can have the Xenobian Knights join you in your journey, or simply enlist the aid of willing recruits that are young and stout of heart.\r\n\r\nYou may only want to enlist the aid of the ferocious and sexy Wicce Deneb.\r\n\r\nRecruit them all or just a few it is completely up to you.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nEPIC BATTLES: (These battles are not meant for low level characters, and may require an army)\r\nRecommended level 30 (Dragon battle can be done with a group of lvl 20 characters)\r\n\r\nNot only do you have the opportunity to let the heroes join you, but you can also help them in defeating their enemies in the realm of Skyrim.\r\n\r\n1. Defeat Lans Tartare and his villainous allies as they come ashore near the lighthouse north of Solitude.\r\n\r\n2. The beautiful angel Yushis has fallen from the heavens, sent on a mission to track down her rebellious sister who has betrayed the heavens to aid her evil master and lover; Rashidi. The angel has tracked them down to a place of ancient power not far from Helgen.\r\n\r\n3. A clan of ancient dragons has been reborn in the valley east of Rorikstead. Witnesses claim to have seen multiple dragons in the area. It is rumored that a group of knights with a beautiful sorceress seek to slay these vicious beasts. (You can see this battle in my video section)\r\n\r\n4. The evil necromancer Nybeth and his allies seek to learn the secrets of Labyrinthia. Stop him before he gains entrance to the secrets within.\r\n\r\n5. The priestess Oelias and her cursed brother need assistance in the ruins of Aftland.\r\n\r\n6. Assist the heroes of yore Destin and Aisha, as they track down an evil foe. Diablo has been reborn with the aid of the witch Endora. Go to Windhelm (Temple of Talos) to find these heroes and aid them in stopping this foe.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nCOMPANIONS:\r\n\r\nAll set to Essential\r\nAll Marriageable\r\nAll have perk Lightfoot (Will not set off traps)\r\nLocal Dismissing\r\n\r\nDenam - Breton - Spellsword (Destruction/Blades) - Rorikstead\r\nVyce - Imperial - Assassin (Blades/Stealth) - Rorikstead\r\nKatiua - Breton - Princess (Destruction/Restoration/Conjur/Illusion/Blades) - Rorikstead\r\nLans - Nord - Knight (Blades/Greatswords/Restoration) - Valley west of Rorikstead\r\nGildas - Nord - Knight (Greatswords/Battleaxe/Restoration) - Valley west of Rorikstead\r\nMirdyn - Nord - Knight (Blades/Restoration) - Valley west of Rorikstead\r\nWarren - Breton - Necro Mage (Restoration/Conjuration/Alteration) - Valley west of Rorikstead\r\nCanopus - Wood Elf - Barbarian (Warhammer/Stealth) - Valley west of Rorikstead\r\nDeneb - Breton - Wicce (Destruction/Conjuration/Alteration/Restoration/Illusion) Valley Rorikstead\r\nArycelle - Nord - Ranger (Archery/Stealth) - Windhelm Palace\r\nCressida - Breton - Necro Mage (Conjuration/Restoration/Alteration) - Morthal\r\nJeunan - Imperial - 2-Handed Warrior (Greatswords/Warhammer) - Dawnstar\r\nOcionne - Imperial - Ranger (Blades/Archery/Stealth) - Dawnstar\r\nOlyvia - Imperial - Monk (Restoration/Alteration) - Markarth Dibella\r\nCistina - Imperial - Valkyrie (Blades/Greatswords/Restoration/Destruction) - Markarth Dibella\r\nCerya - Imperial - Rogue (Blades/Archery) - Markarth Dibella\r\nSherri - Imperial - Destruction Mage (Destruction/Alteration) - Solitude Palace\r\nFolcurt - Imperial - Knight (Blades/Axes/Restoration) - Markarth\r\nOzma - Nord - 2-Handed Warrior (Greatswords) - Solitude Palace\r\nIuria - Wood Elf - Bard (Archery/Illusion/Alteration) - Labyrinthia\r\nDestin - Nord - Knight (Greatswords/Restoration) - Windhelm Temple\r\nAisha - Breton - Monk (Restoration/Alteration) - Windhelm Temple\r\nOsiris - Dark Elf Vampire - Necro Mage (Conjuration/Alteration) - Morthal\r\nIsis - Dark Elf Ghost - Destruction Mage (Ice Destruction/Restoration) - Morthal\r\nXapan - Nord - Barbarian (Greatswords/Warhammer/Battleaxe) - Lighthouse\r\nOelias - Breton - Vigilant (Restoration/Alteration) - Aftland Ruins\r\nDievold - Breton - 2-Handed Warrior (Greatswords/Battleaxe/Warhammer) - Aftland Ruins\r\nHaborym - Imperial - Blade (Blades/Stealth) - Dragon Bridge Tavern\r\nRavness - Imperial - Knight (Blades/Restoration) - Dragonreach\r\nYushis - Nord - Angel Knight (Blades/Destruction/Restoration) - Cavern near Helgen\r\nDiego - Nord - Rogue (Blades/Dual/Archery) - Solitude\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nRequired Mods:\r\n\r\nApachiskyhair 1.5 by Apachi - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\nApachiFemales by Apachi, 1.2 and 1.3\r\nApachiMales by Apachi\r\nMore Hair Colors (I have both files active) - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27755\r\nAdditional NPC Follower Voices - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16266\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nRecommended Mods (But not required):\r\n\r\nUFO - Ultimate follower overhaul. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037 \r\nTERA Armors - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25846\r\n\r\nFine Face Textures by urshi - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27815\r\nEyes of Beauty - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722\r\nBetter Facegen - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6953\r\nBetter Males http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488 \r\nBetter Females http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812 \r\nBody mods (Calientes) \r\nOne of the sexy armor mods out there.

Make sure you have downloaded and installed all of the apachi files listed on the main page on required files.\r\n\r\n2. Be sure my files are installed properly, mesh and texture folders should be merged with the same ones in the skyrim/data folder. Make sure my .esp file is also pasted in your data folder. If you used nexus mod manager this should be done right.\r\n\r\n3. Make sure your load order is correct in mod manager or data files. Apachi .esm should be at the top with other .esm files (but below skyrim, update, etc)(The same is true for all .esm files). The .esp should be below. My .esp file should be below Apachi\\'s.\r\n\r\n4. It is possible that apachiskyhair might be conflicting with another mod. You can check on Apachi\\'s nexus page to see if there is a list of mods that they know cause conflicts. My mod in particular needs apachi\\'s files in order for it to work, without apchiskyhair\\'s a ctd will happen. My file is a companion mod, so it won\\'t cause a conflict as it is all added content, not altering in-game content.\r\n\r\n5. If all of the above did not work, then you must have a conflict somewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\n\r\nApachi in particular for the awesome hair mod! You are an inspiration to modders.\r\nThe creators and re-creators of Tactics Ogre (Square-Enix)\r\nAll modders whose mods I have linked to, your work has greatly enhanced Skyrim.\r\nBethesda for Skyrim, thank you for the beautiful game!
