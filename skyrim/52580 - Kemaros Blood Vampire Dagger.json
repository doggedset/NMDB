  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=#ff0000][size=3]*** I&#39;M NOT UPDATING THIS MOD ANYMORE ***\r<br />I&#39;m sorry for the trouble but I&#39;m a student, I made this mod when I was 13, completely forgot about it and now see it has some downloads and people even make comments. Now thing is I don&#39;t have time for it, only on weekends and if I&#39;m not going to be able to support it as much is I want, I prefer not to at all. Thanks for the nice comments tho, and I really want to continue this mod and will as soon as I get a chance. Again, sorry for the trouble ^^&#39;[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />First of all, you should now that this one is my first mod, so don&#39;t expect flying trains.\r<br />\r<br />-DESCRIPTION\r<br /> This is a dagger wich is made for vampires and uses the Daedra Dagger texture, but I&#39;ll try to make my own. It has a powerful Absorb Life enchantement, the best one.\r<br />\r<br />-CRAFTING\r<br /> You should be able to craft the dagger in any of Skyrim&#39;s forges, you&#39;ll find it under the &#34;MISC&#34; section. Ingredients needed:\r<br />  -1 Daedra Heart\r<br />  -1 Human Heart\r<br />  -1 Vampire Dust\r<br />  -2 Deathbell\r<br />  -1 Ebony ingot\r<br />This will give you two daggers (the idea is to use both at the same time).\r<br />***** NOTE that only vampires can craft it *****\r<br />(So don&#39;t tell me that your vampire hunter can&#39;t craft the dagger)\r<br />\r<br />-COMPATIBILITY\r<br /> This is a light mod that shouldn&#39;t enter in conflict with ANY other mod, but please report any bugs. \r<br /> Custom vampire races should be able to craft the dagger, but please report any bugs. (Tested with Better Vampires 6-6 by Brehanin and worked)\r<br />\r<br />-TO DO\r<br /> I&#39;ll make a small dungeon, full of vampires, where two unic daggers will be the reward. Then you won&#39;t be able to craft it, it wouldn&#39;t make sense.\r<br /> My own texture (a very bloody dagger)\r<br />\r<br />Hope you like it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />(If this interests someone, Kemaro is my vampire stealth assassin character).\r<br />\r<br />Steam Workshop link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=244187065\r<br />\r<br />-CHANGELOG\r<br /> -1.0 - First Release\r<br /> -1.1 - .esm file description fixed\r<br /> -1.2 - Removed frost resistance and modified item description\r<br />\r<br />By the way now you can submit bug reports. Even though I said I&#39;m not updating this mod, I want you to know that I&#39;ll check out every bug report and if I come back with the mod (which I will eventually do) I&#39;ll try to fix them all.",
