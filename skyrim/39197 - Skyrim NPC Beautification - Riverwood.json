  "descriptionHtml": "Apachii\\'s Sky Hair required (as well as both male and female add-ons)!\r\nWARNING! THIS IS A PURE BEAUTIFICATION MOD, AND THEREFORE IT\\'S NOT LORE FRIENDLY!\r\n\r\nFeel free to leave suggestions about what I should change, since this is my first mod.\r\n\r\nAny of you not impressed by the way vanilla NPCs look? Why they all look sort of ugly and not pleasing to the eye? Well, here\\'s a mod that I made that revamps the look of all the characters in Riverwood! The way that some features of their faces have been changed as I deem neccessary, and all their hairs have been replaced with Apachii\\'s sky hair. I tried to make the characters look as close to their original forms as possible, while looking good as well. \r\n\r\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder, and this is how I prefer them. Feel free to try them for yourself. If you like them, please endorse. If you don\\'t like them, I encourage downloading \\\"Skyrim NPC editor\\\" by \\\"Foretrenty\\\", and change them to your own preferences. \r\nLink: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4554/?\r\n\r\nTechnical stuff :\r\n\r\nI added warpaints to just about every character that I consider to be a warrior (eg. Delphine, Hadvar). I removed dirt from every character\\'s face. I also changed the complexion of characters that had \\\"rough\\\" or \\\"freckles\\\" to the default smooth one. \r\n\r\nImportant mods I use alongside this.\r\n\r\nApachii\\'s Sky Hair  (Obviously)\r\nZoner\\'s High Performance ENB 2.0\r\nCute Eyes\r\nPretty Face\r\nEnhanced Character Edit\r\n\r\nI will not type all the mods I use since I use about 200 of them.",
