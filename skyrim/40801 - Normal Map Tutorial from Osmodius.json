  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/images/40801-1-1377178241.gif[/img]\r\nThis tutorial is for people who do not know how to make good normal maps from their texture images. I learned this method on my own from two years of texturing in photoshop, and I am happy to share it with you. This method is ideal for brick walls, stone/rock walls, stone/rock/brick paths and roads, but the same rules in this tutorial apply to pretty much all textures. In the screenshot I have provided, you can see the difference between the average modders normal map, and the normal map that my method produces. I hope this tutorial is useful for anyone wanting to release their own texture packs for Skyrim. Good luck, and if you have any trouble or questions, I will keep an eye on the comments section for this mod\\'s page.\r\n\r\nYou can download the tutorial video from this modpage, or you can watch it on Youtube here [youtube]tKqKJi6nh7A[/youtube]",
