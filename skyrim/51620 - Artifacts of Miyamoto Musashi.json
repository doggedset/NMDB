  "descriptionHtml": "Who was Miyamoto Musashi?\r<br />Miyamoto Musashi (宮本 武蔵?, c. 1584 – June 13, 1645), also known as Shinmen Takezō, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten Dōraku, was a Japanese swordsman and rōnin. Musashi, as he was often simply known, became renowned through stories of his excellent swordsmanship in numerous duels, even from a very young age. He was the founder of the Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū or Niten-ryū style of swordsmanship and the author of The Book of Five Rings (五輪の書 Go Rin No Sho?), a book on strategy, tactics, and philosophy that is still studied today. \r<br />\r<br />So what this mod does is add a small Japanese (or Akaviri) tomb north to Septimus Signus&#39; Outpost. There, you can find a coffin that houses his armor and weapon, a pedestal with the Book of Five Rings, and two urns with gold in them. The door is locked at master Level.\r<br />\r<br />Hope you enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi\r<br />",
