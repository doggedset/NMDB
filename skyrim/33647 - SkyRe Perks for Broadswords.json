  "descriptionHtml": "This is a SkyRe-compatible set of perks that operate on the broadsword weapon type. I felt that broadswords needed a bit more love given that the more exotic weapons get some awesome perks that are very useful late-game. Historically, broadswords were used as blunt weapons almost as often as they were used as cutting weapons, so I designed the perks around getting in close and bashing to deal a finishing blow to your enemy. \r\n\r\nNOTE: I am looking for [i]constructive[/i] feedback on the balancing for the mod. I tried to stick close to T3nd0\\'s existing perks in terms of power and usefulness, but obviously that\\'s a tricky balance to achieve, so if it feels too weak or too powerful, please let me know (with examples).\r\n\r\n================\r\nDetails\r\n================\r\n- Adds a perk to Light Weaponry called \\\"Finishing Blow\\\" that has three ranks. Finishing Blow enables the player to perform extra-powerful bash attacks with their broadsword that can knock the enemy down and give the player a massive short-term damage buff to finish their opponent off. The chance to knock the enemy down increases as your enemy gets weaker, so get a few hits in before doing anything too risky!\r\n\r\n================\r\nInstallation\r\n================\r\nExtract the SkyRe_Plugin_Perks_Broadsword.esp plugin to your Skyrim Data directory or use NMM/Wrye Bash. \r\n\r\n================\r\nUninstallation\r\n================\r\nDelete the SkyRe_Plugin_Perks_Broadsword.esp file from your Skyrim Data folder or use NMM/Wrye Bash to uninstall.\r\n\r\n================\r\nLinks\r\n================\r\nGo here and get the original mod and files and ENDORSE it!\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286]SkyRe-Skyrim Redone[/url]\r\n\r\n================\r\nCredits\r\n================\r\nT3nd0 for SkyRe\r\nBethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit\r\n\r\n================\r\nVersion History\r\n================\r\nv 1.0(3/20/13) - Initial release.",
