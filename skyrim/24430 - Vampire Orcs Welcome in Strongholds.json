  "descriptionHtml": "I consider this a bug that I can\\'t believe Bethesda overlooked. I approached Narzulbur on my female orc knowing full well that I would be welcomed with open arms to take refuge behind their walls. Unfortunately, my female Orc is also a Vampire. The guard informed me I was not Orc-Kin and they would have nothing to do with me. Soon after, I set out to correct this injustice. Vampire Orcs Welcome in Strongholds (VOWIS) does just that. If it doesn\\'t work for you or you notice I overlooked something, Send me a message. I\\'m a lot more likely to see your plea for help in a message because I don\\'t check my mod pages often. ",
