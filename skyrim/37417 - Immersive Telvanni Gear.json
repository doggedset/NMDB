  "descriptionHtml": "[color=gold][size=4][u][b]Immersive Telvanni Gear:[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nI was frustrated to see that Telvanni robes were so weak in the Dragonborn DLC, A master wizard and enchanter has a useless robe? Come on...\r\nThis adds a few robes and shoes to Skyrim and Solstheim. Neloth sells them in Solstheim and a custom vendor does it in Skyrim. He is located in Dragonsreach.\r\nThere are two types of robes enchanted and unenchanted ones.\r\nTo be lore friendly the robes are expensive as they are quite rare (sacking of Mournhold...) so you will need to save up but the reward is great!",
