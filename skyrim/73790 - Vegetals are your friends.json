  "descriptionHtml": "First, I would say I made this mod for my druid character...As I was fed up with eating only apple cabbage stew, I decided to create real recipes...\r<br />Finally, I added some new ingredients, too, and crafting stations to go with, and a little shack...\r<br />So, this mod adds :\r<br />16 new harvestable ingredients for alchemy and cooking I have place by hand in the exteriors : \r<br />* Alkanet flower(from Alkanet Tree)\r<br />* Pollen (from Pollen Flowers) \r<br />* Sap (from Firefern) \r<br />* Mandrake root (from Mandrake)\r<br />* Hackelo leaves (from Hackelo)\r<br />* Boletus Malacatus (from Boletus)\r<br />* Amanita Boetica (from Amanita)\r<br />* Pink Lavender flower (From Pink Lavender Bush)\r<br />* Coffee Beans and Coffee Powder (from Coffee Trees)\r<br />* Marshmerrow tail (from Marshmerrow Tree)\r<br />* Crushed Ruby (from Ruby)\r<br />* Crushed Emerald (from Emerald)\r<br />* Crushed Sapphire (from Sapphire)\r<br />* Crushed Garnet (from Garnet)\r<br />* Blueberries bowl (from Blueberry Tree)\r<br />* Yam root (from Yam)\r<br />4 new harvestable ingredients from Solstheim :\r<br />* Ash Spine Heart (from Ash Spine plant)\r<br />* Ash Shroom (from Ash Shroom Tree)\r<br />* Muck (from Muck Sponge)\r<br />* SporePod&#39;s Spores (from Spore&#39;s Pods)\r<br />Some new harvestable vegetables : \r<br />* Paprika and Crushed Paprika Seeds (from Paprika Tree) \r<br />* Pumpkin (from Pumkin plant)\r<br />* Eggplant (from Eggplant Bush)\r<br />* Avocado (from Avocado Tree)\r<br />* Green Onion (from green Onion plant)\r<br />I was talking about new Crafting Stations, there are 5.\r<br />I first make a Grinder, to crush some ingredients like the gems (because my druid isn&#39;t using forge, I thought it was a good idea to use gems...)\r<br />Then, I made the Butter Churn active in some farms, and Also a Water Pump to have water to make tea or coffee...\r<br />And I also made a Drinking Station and a Cooking Station for no risk of bugs with the vanilla cooking pot.\r<br />I must say that those stations don&#39;t have animations because I didn&#39;t know how to make some, but it is acting like when your facing a vendor, sort of...\r<br />I tried to place them also in the cities and villages, but I am not sure in each one...\r<br />So, let&#39;s see the new recipes :\r<br />Beverages\r<br />* Coffee \r<br />* Marshmerrow Tea \r<br />* Canis Root Tea \r<br />* Tomato Juice \r<br />* Carrot Pumpkin Juice\r<br />* Milk Coffee \r<br />* Pollen Juice \r<br />Main dishes\r<br />* Fried eggs \r<br />* Veggie sausage \r<br />* Cheesy Toasts \r<br />* Veggies Stie-Fry \r<br />* Veggie Pancakes \r<br />* Hackelo Omelette \r<br />* Guacamole \r<br />* Avocado Sandwich\r<br />* Ratatouille  \r<br />* Veggie Stew \r<br />* Yam Bread \r<br />Desserts\r<br />* Blueberry cheesecake : Runspect\r<br />* Pumpkin Pie : Extra Food\r<br />* Pink  macaron : Melt in the Mouth\r<br />* Pink  Donut : Runspect\r<br />* Blueberry macaron : Melt in the Mouth\r<br />* Coffee cake : Melt in the Mouth\r<br />* Apple Galette : Melt in the Mouth\r<br />* Dumplings : Lolicept\r<br />* Madeleine : Melt in the Mouth\r<br />* Croissant\r<br />* And , last but not least, I made a little shack near the Heartwood Mill, with a little garden and lots of new plants in pots.\r<br />It is not navemeshed because I don&#39;t understand how to do it, but it is practicable for your character, if you&#39;re coming with a follower, \r<br />I suggest you to make him/her wait in the little stool in the garden ^_^\r<br />In this shack, you will find the Cooking Station, The Drinking Station and the Grinder, a lovely &#34;fishnet bed&#34;, some storages.\r<br />You can find too an alchemic laboratory and a foutain of science (because I thought it was more cute than the basic enchanting table...)\r<br />Two benches to take your morning coffee at a wonderfull place.\r<br />And, in the little Island in front of the shack, I place a Shrine of Kynareth ans a lovely Statue, just in case...\r<br />\r<br />I must admit I should ma not be lore-friendly...\r<br />\r<br />For Installing, I recommand the manual way, and to put the Meshes files in the\r<br />c: Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Skyrim/Data/meshes\r<br />And the textures in the\r<br />c: Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Skyrim/Data/textures\r<br />\r<br />I apology for my blurry English, it is not my native language...^_^",
