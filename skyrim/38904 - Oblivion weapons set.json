  "summary": "Adds all weapons from the Shivering Isles and Oblivion into Skyrim (except for bows and staffs)",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds 113 weapons from Oblivion into Skyrim.  To get the weapons, go to Riverwood and enter the Sleeping Giant inn, while inside, go right from the entrance and you should see a Riften style door. Enter that room and all the weapons should be there on tables in their sets.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nNone of the weapons are enchanted, but I did add 113 soul gems and an enchanting table so that you can enchant them how you like.\r\n\r\nIt is compatible with JTAGed Xbox 360s, if you don\\'t know what this is, don\\'t worry about it.\r\n\r\nIn a future update, I may add bows and arrows and I will look into adding the Knights of the Nine weapons.\r\n\r\nI did find a few weapons in the game files that I have no idea what they are actually called, so I didn\\'t add them.\r\n\r\nReport any bugs, or create a bug fix yourself/\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit this mod and redistribute. Just give me credit for the original mod and send me a link to your new and edited mod.\r\n",
