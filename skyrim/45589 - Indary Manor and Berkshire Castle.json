  "descriptionHtml": "Indary Manor and Berkshire Castle\r\n\r\nIndary Manor and Berkshire Castle are adoption, spouse and companion friendly.  They support the adoption of up to six children with the use of Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions.  Although that mod is not required it is recommended.  One thing this mod does require is all 3 DLC\\'s, Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn.   \r\n\r\nThere is also a new cave to explore which is right next to Indary Manor and you will have to travel through it to find Berkshire Castle.  It might not be safe to go exploring alone so you might want to bring along Munchkin who is probably the most vicious of Riekling warriors ever to exist.  He can be found just outside of Indary Manor.  The clutter in Indary Manor and Bershire Castle is static so you don\\'t have to worry about knocking items around.\r\n\r\nIndary Manor is located on the road East of Dushnikh Yal.\r\nBerkshire Castle is located...well you will have to find it.  It is impossible to miss it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n- Indary Manor and Berkshire Castle.\r\n- A vicious Riekling warrior companion.\r\n- A new cave to explore.\r\n- Adoption friendly.
