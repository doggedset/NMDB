  "summary": "This mod changes light settings to make interior spaces much darker.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever been exploring a cave and wondered \\\"Why is this underground cave so bright?!\\\" By default all locations in the game have ambient reflected light, so even if there are no torches or light sources, they\\'re lit up. I find this annoying on two fronts, 1: It\\'s distractingly unrealistic. 2: It removes any point to torches/light spells/nightvision.\r\n\r\nThis mod removes ambient light from virtually all locations by changing lighting templates. In short this means that if there is no light source such as a fire or brazier, an area will be pitch black. Finally there will be a point to carrying a torch! \r\n\r\nAreas with special lighting, or areas which are supposed to be other-worldly are not affected.\r\n\r\nI\\'d like to take this a step further and remove light sources from places they shouldn\\'t be. I.e. why are there lit braziers in the caves below Helgen Keep? Unfortunately doing so would be very time consuming, and I\\'ll need a list of locations with nonsensical lights before I attempt it. If you\\'d like to see this happen, forward me the names of locations which need lights removed. Once I\\'ve got a decent list, I\\'ll make a separate mod for removing them.\r\n\r\n[b]Requirements:[/b]\r\nUp to date Skyrim. No DLC required.\r\n\r\n[b]Do I need to restart?[/b]\r\nNope. You can apply it to your existing save :)",
