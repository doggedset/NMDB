  "descriptionHtml": "Imperial Report - Turdas 4th Seed. Captain Livitus, Skyrim Division.\r\n\r\nWe\\'ve got him. Ulfric Stormcloak the traitor. General Tullius struck perfectly, he didn\\'t even put up a fight. 5 or so other rebels were with him too. We met little resistance from these, and now we are headed for Helgen. The General wants swift retribution, not a long haul to Solitude.\r\n\r\nA strange encounter, just North of where we caught Stormcloak. A Native Nord, pretty, eyes like an ice wraith. Running, full pelt from Dibella knows what. Ran straight into our convoy. I didn\\'t trust her. Ordered the men to capture her. I\\'m sure she\\'s working with Windhelm\\'s Jarl. Hadvar seems to disagree, but then, he is not Captain is he? She goes to the block.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis is a save of my character Rachel. She is a Nord, and starts at Level 3, no quests completed. She\\'s been through Shriekwind Bastion, and gone to the Talos shrine with the dead preists and Thalmor, on the Road to riverwood. \r\nShe starts the game at destroyed Helgen, after hiding in a fireplace until it all died down.\r\nSome equipment has been dropped around the keep entrance if you want a little head start.\r\n\r\nMods Used\r\nCoolsims Hair\r\nBetter females by Bella\r\nBeauty faces by Neckros\r\nDetailed Lips\r\nBright eyes\r\nCBBE\r\nEnjoy!!",
