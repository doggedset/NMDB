  "descriptionHtml": "NO DLC REQUIRED&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Lish is a wandering warrior from High Rock who recently took work in the Silver Blood mine to pony up some coin to pay for new equipment. Then you walked in ... ;\r<br />\r<br />one handed weapons, two handed weapons, block, archery, and heavy armor are her strengths.\r<br />\r<br />light armor is her lesser attribute\r<br />\r<br />Combat style is very high offense.\r<br />\r<br />Perks: Savage Strike, Hack n&#39; Slash, Devastating Blow, Limb Splitter, Elemental Protection, Deadly Bash, Unhindered, Conditioning.\r<br />\r<br />***Lish likes her axes\r<br />__________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />She is fairly powerful, but balanced. I played with her extensively up to level 30 and she has saved my skin more times than I can count. So, I wanted you to see her skills.\r<br />\r<br />Set as essential, can be turned off in the console command if you wish.\r<br />\r<br />Max level = 81\r<br />\r<br />She can be found eating and drinking and being herself in the Silver Blood Inn in Markarth.\r<br />\r<br />###NOTE###\r<br />\r<br />Sometimes when you recruit her she will turn into a BRO and start partying. Just exit the Inn, then go back in. She should follow you without a hitch now.\r<br />\r<br />__________________________________________________\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />\r<br />Simply drag the contents of this folder into your Skyrim Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />If you can ignore the heavy handed behavior, Orc women can make you really happy. \r<br />\r<br />__________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Thanks, and have a grand adventure with this tough, bloodthirsty, dependable, life-saving and surprisingly beautiful orc woman.",
