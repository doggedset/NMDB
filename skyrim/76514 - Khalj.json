  "descriptionHtml": "KhaljÂ is an invulnerable Dragon Priest. If he seems overpowered let me know and I will balance him accordingly. The preset A.I. for dragon priests in Skyrim allows him to use destruction magic of a certain class based on the opponents weakness. For a frost dragon(testing phase results) he uses electric magic. And he uses frost magic for fire dragons and you can probably figure out the rest.\r<br />\r<br />[b]THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW\r<br />[/b]- he attacks NPCs if he is not following you, which is why he is located in the bedroom section of Breezhome\r<br />- use the download manually button\r<br />- this is the first mod I have posted, not the first I have created",
