FIND IT AT http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11847\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElSte17\\'s Be A Dragon Mod v 0.5 Beta\r\n\r\nNEW NEW NEW \r\nWATCH NEW VIDEO ====>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFfWGvDQenY\r\n\r\n*****UPDATE******: 3/1/12    Description and instructions have been shortened and made clearer.\r\n*****UPDATE******: 2/29/12 VERSION 0.5 BETA IS NOW HERE WITH TURNING AND ELEVATION CONTROL \r\n**************************************************************************************************************************************\r\nDescription:\r\nTurn into a dragon and fly around.  Go up, down, left, or right with the help of the console!\r\n\r\nThis mod is in its extreme beginnings, so feel free to give advice in the comments section.  Next version will hopefully contain hotkeys for the bat commands so that it feels more natural and you wont have to use the console.  \r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nMerge the Data folder into your Skyrim Data folder\r\n\r\ncheck the .esp file before starting game\r\n\r\nRead the readme or look at the instructions in this description!\r\n\r\n**************************************************************************************************************************************\r\nBAT FLIGHT CONTROLS ( for first time users you MUST complete the \\\"How it works\\\" process below before running these commands)\r\n\r\nStart flying = bat f\r\nFly Higher = bat l\t\t  *Note (with elevation commands, do not enter them too fast                    \r\n                           or your animation will freeze, let them play out before going higher or lower)\r\nFly Lower = bat o\r\nIntiate Right Turn = bat i\t\t*Note ( the command turns you at set amount, if you want to                                               turn faster or slower you can adjust the speed with the mouse looking up or down)   \r\nFly Straight Again = bat u\r\nInitiate Left Turn = bat y\r\nHover (stop moving) = bat j\r\nStart Moving = bat p\r\nLand (glitchy, take you to same spot every time) = bat m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it works: (not as long and hard as it seems )\r\n\r\npress \\\"`\\\" or \\\"~\\\" key to enter the console\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This mod works better with Jackalhead\\'s Master Shape Shifter mod.\r\n\r\nDo not save while flying.\r\n\r\nFollow these instructions step by step and it should work for you.\r\n\r\n1.  Install (recommended) MSS http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11601\r\n\r\n2. start skyrim and load a clean save \r\n\r\n3. Type in the console\r\nplayer.setrace dragon\r\n\r\n4. go to 3rd person view (as a dragon now) and open up the console and type:\r\nplayer.setallowflying 1\r\nplayer.setplayeraidriven 1\r\n\r\n5. close the console, (still in 3rd person) and save your game\r\n\r\n6. next load this game that you just saved\r\n\r\n7. if you have it and if you want, use the shapeshifter mod to turn into a different type of dragon, save. then load this file again\r\n\r\n8. go back to console and type this:\r\nplayer.setallowflying 1\r\nplayer.setplayeraidriven 1\r\nbat f\r\n\r\n9. close the console and you will take off\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Do not save your game while flying.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this works for you (in the comments section).  Enjoy\r\n\r\n**************************************************************************************************************************************\r\nWhat is coming up in the next few versions of the Beta?\r\n\r\n1. Main goal will be to add autohotkeys to the console commands so that you no longer have to type commands, you can simply press buttons\r\n2.  Fix so that you can land anywhere and not just in a set location.\r\n\r\nEndorsements are good encouragement for me.  Thanks everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n***PLEASE BACKUP YOUR SAVES BEFORE USING THIS MOD****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:  YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO HAVE JACKALHEAD\\\"S MASTER SHAPESHIFTER MOD INSTALLED IN ORDER FOR THIS TO WORK.  ALL THE TESTING WAS DONE WITH THIS MOD ACTIVE.  ALSO, THIS MOD SHOULD WORK FOR ANY OF\r\nDRAGON TYPES FROM HIS MOD.\r\n\r\nI take full credit for figuring out how to control turning and elevation :)\r\n\r\n\r\nPost suggestions, feedback, etc. in comments please. Please do not take credit for my breakthroughs, I would be happy to allow people to implement my mod into theirs so long as they ask me first and give me credit :)\r\nThanks\r\nCredit to Jackalhead and many other (soon to be credited) for all their help!",
