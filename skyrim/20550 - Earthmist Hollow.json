  "summary": "Cave house from the Skyre underground homes challenge, located in the snowy mountains.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The mod adds an underground house at the southern mountains of Skyrim, not far from Angi\\'s house or Bloodlet throne. The place is isolate and confident. \r\n You can travel to the map marker (pass icon). At the place you\\'ll find small  ruined stone circle with some useful additions to the house. The house itself lies deeper.\r\n Beyond the door lies a deep cave with touch of ancient nordic style. There are three main corridors in the cave, all open into large central area with mists and waterfalls.\r\n One of the corridors contains some crafting devices, another is reached by the stone bridge and has bed and alchemy area. The last part of the cave has bookshelves and an enchanting altar. You can get there through dark corridor between entangled vines (the wall near the entrance of the second area).\r\n\r\nCrafting possibilities:\r\n  - Chopping block outside\r\n  - Smelter in discrete cave\r\n  - cooking area in the ruins\r\n  - anvil, workbench and sgarpening circle in first underground area\r\n  - tanning rack near the spiral stairs\r\n  - alchemical device in the alchemy room\r\n  - enchanting device in the study\r\n\r\nImportant\r\n==================\r\n The plugin is partially companion-friendly. However, they cannot pass through vine doors despite navmeshes.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n==================\r\nBlary - books, shelves and other\r\nTony67 - scrolls shelves\r\nOaristys - various resources\r\nArtisanix - paintings\r\nHarvey2112 - used his GeneralStore as resource",
