  "descriptionHtml": "This is a lore-friendly, small, but very detailed player home made especially for the rogue/alchemist player (go figure). It is an underground house with some background history. \r<br />I originally made it for my &#39;goblin&#39; race character so it will have a goblin/orc trend to it, but i loved it so much, i wanted to upload it. \r<br />\r<br />There are two entryways, or as a rogue might consider them, escapeways, so you can ALWAYS stay on he run. \r<br />\r<br />Included in the house are:\r<br />Alchemy Table\r<br />Weapon Racks\r<br />Secret Switches\r<br />Weapon Plaques\r<br />Bed\r<br />Custom named storage containers\r<br />Cooking Spit\r<br />Bookshelves\r<br />Custom Music\r<br />and more...\r<br />\r<br />If you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it, then please endorse. Thanks.\r<br />",
