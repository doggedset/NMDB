The quests are puzzling and will sometimes leave you confused if you don&#39;t read properly, you might even end up in the wrong place and die&#33; The goal of the mod is to keep the player hooked for hours maybe even days with hundreds of new quests all with deep stories and great detail.)[/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][color=#ff0000][size=4][center]THIS MOD IS IN A VERY EARLY STAGE AND IS ONLY BEING RELEASED TO MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF ITS EXISTENCE AND TO POSSIBLY HELP ME WITH STORY LINES/BUG TESTING[/center][/size][/color][/font][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[center][/center][center][b][i]I&#39;[/i]m usually very active in the modding community, not always on Nexus but i&#39;m always doing something.
