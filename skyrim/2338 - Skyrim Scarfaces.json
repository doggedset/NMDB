  "descriptionHtml": "Retextures of the scars found in skyrim- Lore friendly and made to match with Npcs already in the game. These include Cuts, bruises and even Bite marks so you can even make a Gnawed on Nord.\r\n\r\nEach scar has been carefully placed on the face as to get the maximum coverage if used with beards, masks and other clothing that partially hides the face.\r\n\r\nAffects all races including beasts, which have their own scratch marks that are slightly edited.\r\n*note* Scars are affected by your characters skin tone and race (eg a deep cut appears red on a Nord and dark green on an Orc)\r\n\r\nTo Install simply unzip, then drop the texture folder into your skyrim Data folder.\r\nTo uninstall, go through your Character folder in Textures and delete any facedetail folders.",
