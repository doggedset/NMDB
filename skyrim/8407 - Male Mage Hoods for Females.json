  "descriptionHtml": "This is a really small change but one that I really wanted. Probably half of my female characters are mages and I have always hated that the female mage hood was so much uglier (to me) than the male counterpart, this mod simply gives female characters the hood that the males have.\r\n\r\nTo install just drop the included Textures folder and Meshes folder into your data folder.\r\n\r\nYou may do whatever you like with these files.\r\n\r\nEDIT: It seems my comments are borked, I guess send me a message if you have any issues.",
