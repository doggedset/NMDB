  "descriptionHtml": "---README---\r\n\r\nfor Dalls_Temple\r\n\r\nby DALL\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\n\r\n13/02/2013\r\n\r\nReligious wars are our reality and such they have their rightful place in Skyrim cosmos as well. Normally scale and actors are different and not related to anything we know but no-compromise hatreds and zealots / their actions are unfortunately same.    \r\n\r\nStory so far: While at Azura\\'s Shrine, you have discovered there something new - previously unseen. \r\n\r\nTemple is multi-category mod with added (realistic n tough) fighting Quest. It brings to Skyrim: new / previously unseen (interior) location, new powerful foes, four sets of arms n armors (remade n improved - Daedric Ebony gear, Black Studded / Leather, Psiijic Battle-Mage Armor Robes and Black Warlock Hooded Robes - new HD textures), two shops with rare items, new skill trainers, crafting facilities n loads of desirable loot options. If so inclined or in the need - you\\'ll find there new follower - Azura\\'s High-Priestess - Suvris (unique character).\r\n\r\nStart location - Azura\\'s Shrine. Azura\\'s Star Quest (in game) - state / phase non-consequential to this mod. \r\n\r\nThis mod is supplied with all for it necessary models/textures but it can be improved further with some other (my stand-alone) mods: \r\n\r\nRecommended additions:\r\n\r\nNoble_Furniture\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7564\r\n \r\nAlchemy_Workbench\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7866\r\n \r\nArcane_Enchanter \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4332\r\n\r\nTo install you need to navigate to your Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim - game folder and paste / drag n drop in it my Data (mod) folder. Allow overwrite!    \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like this mod, simply delete / remove my mod .esp (plug-in) as well as (check for names my unpacked mod) files from Data/meshes/ DallsGear together with textures from Data/textures/DallsGear. \r\n\r\nBugs/conflicts: none.\r\n\r\nNote on v1.1: New trainer and one more shopkeeper added - some minor fixes. For those of you who play game dark / very dark 10% lighter version of two main armors (Daedric n Black Leather) used in this mod added as optional extra. If needed install last.\r\n  \r\nUse:\r\nFree to use but if any files included (therein) are to be used for modding ask me for permission!\r\n\r\nImportant: For start - use save/s made somewhere other then Azura\\'s Shrine location.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and remember - if you find it fun - to come back and give your (to many all important rating validation) endorsement! \r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for really great game.\r\n\r\nPS. Is this mod worth your time? If you can still think for yourself and you are not afraid to try something else a bit more complicated and deeper layered - not found or represented in Nexus Top 100s mod shallows at all - it definitely is! I have been making game extending and retexture overhaul mods for last fifteen years - arguably quite successfully - which makes them all at least worth experimental try. In practice they represent - ten or more of single-purpose / different categories mods squeezed in one (DLC like) package. They were made to be permanent extensions n additions to my own game thus, they are safe n eminently useable but if not wanted - they and their content are very easy to remove without any harmful consequences to your saves.  If interested in other / similar (large-scale / multi-category) mods try - (my) Pine_Wood_Lodge, Arch_Mages_Tower, Proudspire_Castle and Princess. \r\n\r\n",
