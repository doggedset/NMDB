  "descriptionHtml": "This mesh was given to me by Senviro, one of the people who works on the Unique Beasts mod.  It was given on [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/558420-new-race-anubian/page__st__10]This[/url] thread for anyone who can do anything with it.  I\\'m no good with texturing or importing .nifs since mine always seem to break, so I am uploading it here in hopes that one of you might know what to do with it.  The Mesh is Senviro\\'s work - not mine.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, if anyone can do anything with this, I\\'d love to see it as a helmet or as a new race.\r\n\r\nThanks. \r\n\r\nI intend to use this in this mod, if I can get people to help me out with it - it\\'s a big project.\r\nhttp://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/560379-thebes-maybe-a-new-worldspace-and-setting/\r\n**Comments seem to not be working...  Perhaps related to the SkyrimNexus issues since last night.  Well, if they ever start working, please comment.",
