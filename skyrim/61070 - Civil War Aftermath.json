  "modName": "Civil War Aftermath",
  "summary": "Take the fight to enemy encampments all around Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I had a problem with the civil war for as long as I could remember. When entering an enemy encampment I could kill everyone except the commander, even after the war had been won. This bothered me a lot. Even when traveling the road I&#39;d be attacked by these butthole invincible guys, getting my jimmies all rustled and there was nothing I could do.\r<br />\r<br />This mod aims to change all of that: \r<br />[list][*]You can now go into enemy encampments and burn them to the ground as well as kill the commanding officer. (Literally wipe it off the map)\r<br />[/*][*]In some locations either General may use that camp as a symbol of their power.\r<br />[/*][*]Destroying a camp will earn the player money delivered by a courier on behalf of your side&#39;s general.[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />As of this time I have not tested this mod 100%. Many locations are not enabled unless you are far enough along in the story on one side or the other. I will rely on your feedback to help improve this mod.\r<br />\r<br />I am not aware of any conflicts as of yet. It might conflict with Civil War Overhaul, but it may also not&#33; Be sure to save, before installing the mod&#33; Safety first&#33; :D\r<br />\r<br />FAQ\r<br />Q: Why can&#39;t I burn down tents or kill commanders?\r<br />A: Because you need to join one side or the other in the Civil War questline. This was done to prevent you from breaking the questline accidentally.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Why can&#39;t I burn down my own sides tent or kill my own side&#39;s commanders?\r<br />A: Because again, they may have be essential to a quest. I may consider changing this later by adding additional checks.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Even though the title is aftermath, the description suggests I can download this during / before I begin the civil war. Is this correct?\r<br />A: You should be able to download it whenever. CWA is independent of the civil war itself (doesn&#39;t touch it at all), but some camps may not spawn until you are farther in the civil war.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Does it only edit the encampments or other areas in the game?\r<br />A: Only encampments.\r<br />\r<br />Additional questions I find others may ask will be added here in the future.\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/360983/?]Korodic[/url] (me) - original idea/development\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/11327063]djtalks[/url] - early tester",
