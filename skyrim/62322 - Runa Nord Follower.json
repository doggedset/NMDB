  "descriptionHtml": "_______________________________________________________\r<br />NO DLC REQUIRED\r<br />\r<br />Runa is a Nord Spellsword who can be found in Whiterun, descending from the guard tower outpost (as seen in the pictures)\r<br />\r<br />She can use all weapons (one handed or two handed), bows, crossbows, both heavy and light armor, and she knows only destruction and restoration magic.\r<br />\r<br />She has no perks, as I feel followers with perks tend to become greatly overpowered later in game.\r<br />\r<br />She is uncapped, so she will grow in power as you do.\r<br />\r<br />_______________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />DA FLUFF:\r<br />\r<br />Runa was born in Winterhold, but decided to travel to Cyrodiil when she became of age. She then realized just how expensive travel is to the Imperial City, so she became a guard after speaking with Commander Caius in order to earn herself some gold.\r<br />\r<br />Every now and then, Runa hears whispers in her sleep. These occasions are rare, but when she does hear them she recieves strange dreams of fire and ice, two opposing forces unable to best the other.\r<br />\r<br />Unbeknownst to any of the other guards, Runa has developed her latent powers of destruction as a result of her realization of her wonderful gift, and will often employ it in combat (if she has enough magicka reserved for it)\r<br />\r<br />However, Nord superstition stays her hand, so she will only use her magic with someone she trusts very well. She knows a single healing spell, taught to her by her mother who told her that although taken for granted, is one of the most important spells anyone can know.\r<br />\r<br />Runa is calm and forgiving, but dangerous when pushed into combat.\r<br />\r<br />________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Drag and Drop, then check the box under data files.\r<br />\r<br />I am also using Xenius&#39; High Quality Eyes mod, found here\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/498/?\r<br />\r<br />________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />DaveEscape",
