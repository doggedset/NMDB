  "summary": "A new sword, available from Belethor in Whiterun. Makes things glitch humorously.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a sword, purchasable from Belethor for some insane amount the game came up with. Uploaded mostly just for the fun of making things glitch. Bugs I\\'ve come across with this sword include: upon hitting someone, they will appear to lie down dead, however they will glide around and remain able to talk, etc.; upon hitting someone, they will melt into the floor and be frozen in a weird and humorous position, and remain able to talk, etc.; upon hitting a guard, the guard will fade out to about half transparency then suddenly fade back in and work like a follower in that they will follow you, attack those who you are in combat, etc., however if another guard sees this happen, they will chase you, and if a following guard sees you hit another guard, he will start following you; and many more bugs that crop up all the time. Also available from the Steam Workshop: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=87530579 . Anywho, enjoy ;)",
