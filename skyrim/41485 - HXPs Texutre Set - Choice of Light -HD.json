Everybody has a different Taste. A lot of People even dont like the Vanilla Skyrim.\r\nI also know that some of you dont like this too Realistic looking Textures but I like the Photographic Realistic look a lot,Thats where the more Deep 3D effect comes from.\r\nNext Release I will also try to make it more Gamefriendly if it is not already now.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nOnly Manual Install = Simply drop the Data Folder into your Skyrim Main Directory and Overwrite all Files to make sure this Mod works correctly !\r\nTo make this Mod Compatible with Skyrim Flora Overhaul and SMIM firts Install them and then at last my Mod and Overwrite all the Files!\r\nIf you are using Skyrim HD Install it First and then again Overwrite Files of it with my Mod !\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits to Nexus and Bethesda\r\n\r\nCredits to Tammy Sue and Ncrow for some Wood Texture\r\n\r\nCredits to all Texture makers in the World\r\n\r\nAll Textures were free to use and were found in Google Pics and modified by me only\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\nHXP[/center]",
