  "summary": "A small mod that allows you to sell CoT&#39;s new coins to select merchants.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very small addition to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51871/?]Coins of Tamriel V2[/url] which allows selling the new coins (silver and gold septims, new Nord coins, and new Dwemer coins) to merchants. It simply adds to a few form lists in order that the new items show up when trading.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve also changed the Coins of Tamriel names for coins to those used in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48195/?]Skyrim Coin Replacer Redux[/url], mostly for phonics. &#34;Harald&#34; and &#34;Dumac&#34; roll off the tongue easier than &#34;Alessia&#34; and &#34;Kagrenac.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Merchants that will purchase these coins:\r<br />- Innkeepers (septims)\r<br />- Blacksmiths (septims, haralds, and dumacs, EXCEPT Beirand in Solitude who will not accept haralds)\r<br />- Pawnbrokers/General Sellers (septims, EXCEPT Marise Aravel in Riften (food vendor, does not seem the type))\r<br />- Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun (septims)\r<br />- Lucan Valerius in Riverwood (septims; has a separate list)\r<br />- Peddlers (septims)\r<br />\r<br />My philosophy on which merchants to allow centered on those who would be likely to get use out of the coins. Innkeepers and pawnbrokers can expect to do deals with enough varied people that the coins would come in useful; not only that, large shipments can easily be taken care of in gold and silver. Blacksmiths can melt coins down for use in forging (especially jewelrymaking).\r<br />\r<br />All fences should purchase your coins as I believe they&#39;re all general sellers or blacksmiths. If a fence does not accept coins, please let me know.\r<br />\r<br />Street vendors (except a few who are specifically pawnbrokers, like Aval Atheron in Windhelm) should NOT accept the new coins.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is for the [b]script-free V2 version[/b] of the mod. It requires that mod&#39;s main file; it doesn&#39;t require the Dawnguard, Dragonborn, or Hearthfire patches but they don&#39;t conflict.\r<br />\r<br />I have not tested this mod with the other versions of Coins of Tamriel so I cannot vouch for how it will function with them. I use V2 personally because it seems the most complete version, as it adds the silver and gold septims as well as the Nord and Dwemer coins.\r<br />\r<br />Hopefully you&#39;ll be able to offload these ancient coins a bit easier, now&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]CREDIT TO[/b]\r<br />Force70 for Coins of Tamriel V2\r<br />Neovalen for Skyrim Coin Replace Redux",
