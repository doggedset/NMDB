  "descriptionHtml": "After working on a fairly quick little mod to learn the details of the Creation Kit first-hand (particularly changes since Morrowind\\'s kit like AI packages and navmesh), I decided, since I had it done anyway and there really wasn\\'t any reason not to, to upload it.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds two new NPCs to Whiterun (Flor Whitehand and Grizel), along with their house.  They don\\'t actually do anything but eat, sleep (unless they decide to skip it which they seem to sometimes), and go around town during the day.  There are no new quests or dialogue, so actually interacting with them is likely to be a bit of a disappointment... but they\\'re there, if that counts for anything.",
