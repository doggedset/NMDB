  "descriptionHtml": "I downloaded 552 mods from NexusMods.com, but arranging them manually is stupid.\r<br />\r<br />The uploaded archive contains 2 utilities with their source code, it will arrange mods into a single folder and give them proper names as they are on NexusMods.com.\r<br />\r<br />I could make a third utility to arrange the folders further into categories as per NexusMods.com but number of folders were manageable for me.\r<br />\r<br />After categorizing it into folders, you can easily use Wrye Smash to install category by category and make proper decisions.",
