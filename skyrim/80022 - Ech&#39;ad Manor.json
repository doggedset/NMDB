  "summary": "Ech&#39;ad is Hebrew for the word &#34;one&#34;, which is what I was aiming for. One house with everything I wanted.",
  "descriptionHtml": "So I got tired of player houses not having the feel I wanted for a home to use in-game\r<br />\r<br />Too isolated...\r<br />\r<br />garbage location...\r<br />\r<br />Too many load doors...\r<br />\r<br />too many glitchy mannequins...\r<br />\r<br />simply overall lacking a good feel...\r<br />\r<br />So I gave up trying to find the house I wanted and decided to build it instead. that being said this is my first shot at modding, I&#39;m pretty sure everything is the way it should be so it won&#39;t conflict with anything. The house is essentially the proudspire manor with a bit of internal remodeling (added/removed a few rooms and walls, included 3 working mannequins, smithing/forging/crafting/etc. stations, a vault with a good amount of gold and jems because I can, etc) and a location just outside if ivarsted. I play this with &#34;Realistic Aspen Trees&#34;, &#34;Skyrim Flora Overhaul&#34;, and &#34;JK&#39;s Ivarsted&#34; to give the enviornment around the home a better feel.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to my friend Arrowdemon for the 4K screenshots\r<br />\r<br />So I hope you enjoy&#33; :)Â \r<br />\r<br />P.S. Since I&#39;m new to modding there are a few features that probably should be added to this mod (like adoption/spouse friendlier, better navmesh around the manor grounds, etc.) that, if some who is better at this modding ordeal than I wanted to step up and add such features, let me know and we can get something rolling.",
