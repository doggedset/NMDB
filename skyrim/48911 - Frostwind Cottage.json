So, this adds a nice cottage in Winterhold that you can use with a something like Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions to move your kids and spouse near the Collage.\r<br />\r<br />As I didn&#39;t want to put some sprawling mansion in Winterhold (that just seemed odd), I remembered that in Bruma in Oblivion, the houses were constructed partly underground to help insulate them.  So, this has the majority of the house in a basement underground.  Tried to make it as lore-friendly as possible, but you still have lots of room and storage and displays.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k48/dubird/sigs/features_zps881e8193.png[/img]\r<br />- All crafting stations and full smithy\r<br />- Multiple displays, including mannequins\r<br />- Room for 2 followers\r<br />- Fully navmeshed\r<br />- 4 children beds for use with multiple adoption mods\r<br />- Lots of safe storage\r<br />- Lots of bookshelves\r<br />- Spouse and kid friendly\r<br />- Cleaned with TES5Edit\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k48/dubird/sigs/requirements_zps2f4b41c0.png[/img]\r<br />- Latest version of Skyrim\r<br />- Hearthfire\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k48/dubird/sigs/recommend_zps2cf42408.png[/img]\r<br />- A mod that allows you to set custom homes as homes for spouses and adoptions.  This was made for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249/?]Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions[/url], but should work with others.  Not required, you&#39;ll just have an unused room if you don&#39;t.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This shouldn&#39;t conflict with any other mod, unless it modifies the ruined farmhouse next to the inn in Winterhold.  I actually have this loaded with Agent of Righteous Might, and while it&#39;s really close to the building that mod adds, it works fine alongside it.  If you run into any mod that conflicts with it, let me know and I&#39;ll see if I can make a patch for it.\r<br />\r<br />",
