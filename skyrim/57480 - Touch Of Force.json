  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Georgia]\r<br />[size=3][img]http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c299/Infarock/tof-1.jpg[/img]﻿﻿\r<br />\r<br />     There are several spell mods out there that use the Unrelenting Force formula, but honestly, I wasn&#39;t really happy with any of them. I wanted something more powerful, something that would blow people away, literally.  [/size][size=3]So I created Touch Of Force. A single, stand-alone spell mod. It works along the same lines as Unrelenting Force, but with twice as much force and a chance to disarm and moderately damage opponents. [/size][size=3]Touch Of Force is a novice-level destruction spell that uses a minimal amount of magicka, so yes, it is a bit OP (of course, sending an opponent halfway to the moon with the palm of your hand is going to be OP no matter how you look at it :)[/size][size=3]\r<br />[/size][size=3]     The spell tome to teach you Touch Of Force can be found on a wooden table in the kitchen of The Bannered Mare (see screenshot). [/size][size=3]I&#39;ve also included an optional file titled &#34;Force Unrelenting&#34;, that will give the Unrelenting Force shout the same increased pushback as Touch Of Force. [/size][size=3]No mod conflicts should be expected, unless you use &#34;Force Unrelenting&#34; with any other mod that affects Unrelenting Force. Also, any mods that affect the Bannered Mares kitchen tables area.\r<br />[/size][size=3]\r<br />[/size][size=3]    The latest version of Skyrim is all that is required. For installation I recommend NMM or for manual, just drop the ESPs in your Skyrim data folder.[/size][size=3]\r<br />[/size][size=3]\r<br />Thank you very much for your time and I hope you enjoy the mod :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]T_yPcILcjy4[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[/font]",
