  "summary": "A small cottage on an island west of the Guardian Stones.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod for Skyrim. The cottage is located west of the Guardian Stones. I will be adding items to the house to practice with the CK. You might notice a few minor glitches with lighting and the door, but the Water Cottage should be fully functional.\r\n\r\nI would also like to apologize for my constant updates without warning. I\\'ll try to keep them more spaced out and include more fixes with each update so that you all are not bombarded with updates every time you start Skyrim up. Sorry for any bothers I caused to anyone. I\\'m still learning how to manage a mod properly. \r\n\r\n** With the newest update, you might want to disable the mod, save, reenable the mod, and load the new save to get the best experience. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdded with last update\r\n- Fixed the roof of Anise\\'s cabin\r\n- Fixed the bookshelves\r\n- made it so the note and dagger on the door will not move no matter what happens. Feel free to blast them both with magic and arrows! (You might need to disable the mod, save, and reenable the mod for them to be corrected.)\r\n\r\nWhat I\\'m working on\r\n- Adding more to the house\r\n- Adding more to the inside of the shack so it\\'s not empty\r\n- Adding more general functionality to the house and surrounding area\r\n- Adding a functional stable near the bridge (Currently it serves no purpose. Horses don\\'t use it.)\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to be able to do when I learn more\r\n- Add a small quest\r\n- Getting companions to utilize the house\r\n\r\nPlease let me know of any issues you have with my mod. If for any reason you decide to uninstall my mod, let me know why and if there\\'s anything I can do to make my mod useful to you. The feedback helps me better my mods.",
