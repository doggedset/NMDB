I assembled 4 other doors in Nifskope using Skyrim doors as a base and added them in the folder &#34;borrowed&#34;.\r<br />The animated roasted pig on a spit will cause some error messages in the Creation Kit but you can safely ignore them, the animation works. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO_UODqIt44\r<br />If you prefer a different roof texture, there are optional files included for the buildings which have the Whiterun Dragon Tile roof-texture. These files have the suffix _a.nif, for instance timberedTower01_a.nif.\r<br />\r<br />I added a demo esp which contains all objects so you can use it to drag the objects in the render window to have a look at them. And I placed some of the buildings near Serpent&#39;s Bluff Redoubt, west of Rorikstead to give you an impression of how they look in game, you can fast travel there.Note: THis demo is not a usable mod&#33;\r<br />I had no patience though to rebuild the castle or to build interiors with the kit as Castle Seaview is a gigantic puzzle :D.\r<br />If you need suggestions how to use the assets and you don&#39;t have Oblivion installed, I suggest to look at the screenshots in the Oblivion release thread. Additionally I added an optional file here with some screenshots of the Oblivion mod, made in game and in the Construction set. And use your fantasy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />LOD: There are no Lod nifs for Lod generation. To make the larger buildings visible from a distance, check the &#34;Is full LOD&#34; box for each reference, as can be seen in the demo esp.\r<br />\r<br />=========================\r<br />\r<br />Changes in version 1.1: \r<br />Replaced the collision for the woodenBalcony as the original collision could have caused crashes. Added a lighter wood texture to the woodenBalcony to match the look of the buildings better. Added the RtDoorSeaview as a non-animated door too.\r<br />\r<br />=========================\r<br />\r<br />Visit the Beyond Skyrim forums:\r<br />http://www.darkcreations.org/forums/\r<br />http://www.darkcreations.org/forums/forum/626-beyond-skyrim-projects/\r<br />They still look for talented modders who want to help with their projects\r<br />\r<br />=========================\r<br />Tools Used:\r<br />=========================\r<br />\r<br />Nifskope\r<br />NifUtils by Skyfox\r<br />Gimp\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />This is a modders resource.You may use the meshes for your own mods as long as you give credit and you do not charge money for it.\r<br />\r<br />You may use this resource in Skyrim Special Edition too. All files should work without problems.\r<br />\r<br />Do not upload to other sites.\r<br />\r<br />mr_siika has been away from modding for quite some time, and will likely not return to the forums.\r<br />Deeza from the Beyond Skyrim team was originally granted permission to port the assets featured in this resource, he can prove the permission, which I have seen too.\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Credits:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />mr_siika for his resources and for everything he has given to the TES community&#33;\r<br />The Niftools team for giving us Nifskope.\r<br />Skyfox from the Niftools team for his great tool NifUtils\r<br />The Beyond Skyrim Team\r<br />\r<br />[img] https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-g4MUjm_1RAU/U1u0h-aZoPI/AAAAAAAAF9o/seYIy8x73xs/s144/BS%2520-%2520Resources.png[/img]",
