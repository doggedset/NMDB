  "descriptionHtml": "It&#39;s me again, with yet another Vampire Home mod&#33; This is my second ever mod, and was originally intended as more of a testing ground for activators and such. It ended up turning into quite a nice lair that I&#39;m quite happy with. This very small lair is intended for a wizard type vampire who lives alone. Hidden behind a &#39;teleporter&#39; on the coast near Windhelm, Iceblood Lair has just about everything a wizardy vampire needs. Let me know if you have any problems or feedback, and I&#39;ll do my best to fix things quickly&#33; Hope you enjoy it. \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]This lair features:[/u][/b]\r<br />- One coffin for a vampire. \r<br />- Two mannequins. \r<br />- Two display cases. \r<br />- A bookshelf. \r<br />- An Alchemy crafting station with storage. \r<br />- An Enchanting crafting station with storage. \r<br />- A Blood Shrine in the basement that increases your Destruction Spell Damage by 10%, counts as feeding, but decreases your movement speed by 20% for 24 hours. \r<br />- A really big safe for treasures. \r<br />- A nice atmosphere, with vampire friendly dim lights. \r<br />- A bit of lore for the lair, which you can read in a journal on the writing desk. \r<br />- A teleport pedestal instead of a door. Simply activate the pedestals to go in and out of your home. No need to worry about vampire slayers kicking your door down&#33; \r<br />- Follower friendly (although they&#39;ll have to sleep on the floor) \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Future Plans[/u][/b]\r<br />I don&#39;t have any further plans for this mod, beyond fixing any bugs that pop up. This is intended for quite a specific type of character. Windhelm is very close by for all of your merchant, feeding and blacksmithing needs, and Hjerim would make a nicer family home anyway. \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Requirements:[/u][/b]\r<br />- A functioning PC \r<br />- A legit copy of Skyrim and the Dawnguard DLC \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Credits and Thank You&#39;s:[/u][/b]\r<br />- Blary and Oaristys for their excellent modders resources. \r<br />- Dragondude1029 and IsharaMeradin on the Nexus Forums for helping me make the custom door. \r<br />- Bethesda for the game. \r<br />- The Nexus team for the awesome site\r<br />- The many people doing creation kit tutorials for helping idiots like me.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Changes:[/u][/b]\r<br />V1.1 \r<br />- Edited the &#39;Notes on Iceblood Lair&#39; book to make it look a little neater inside.\r<br />- Changed the blessing given by the shrine. The bonus to destruction damage is now 10% (down from 20%), and the Slow effect is now 20% (down from 50%).",
