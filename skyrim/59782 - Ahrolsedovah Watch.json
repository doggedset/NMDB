  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://s30.postimg.org/iatbt7333/Untitled_2.jpg[/img]\r<br />Hey guys&#33; My name is PinkPotatoSack and I would like to thank you for checking out this mod. This is my first house mod, but please give constructive criticism so I can improve on what I already have. I decided to make a house mod which would be between Whiterun and Riverwood. (Sorry for making yet again another Riverwood house mod, but the exteriors were so easy to work with) I thought most of the abodes on the Nexus were amazing, and it was this that inspired me to make this. So, I decided to make my own home on the Creation Kit. Anyways, please enjoy what I have created, but if something is wrong, or if you don&#39;t like something, or if you want something to be added, please tell me in the comment section. I will be sure to check up on this mod regularly.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://s10.postimg.org/hxi65sqpz/Untitled_3.jpg[/img]\r<br />This house&#39;s name is &#39;Ahrolsedovah Watch&#39;. &#39;Ahrolsedovah&#39; means Whiterun in the Dragon language. The house has a great view of Whiterun, from the top of the house and the &#39;balcony&#39; accessible from the basement. The house features two floors and an outdoor smithy. There are weapon plaques and a mannequin inside, as well as a few chests and strongboxes for storage. Guards have been placed outside the home, as the home is made for Thanes of Whiterun, who deserve more protection. There are multiple statues throughout the house, as well as shrines to pray to. \r<br />\r<br />Regardless of the introduction I just wrote, here is a list of the features I have made available in Ahrolsedovah Watch:\r<br />[list][*]1 Mannequin (Will add more in future)[/*]\r<br />[*]4 Storage Chests[/*]\r<br />[*]2 Strongboxes[/*]\r<br />[*]4 Weapon Plaques[/*]\r<br />[*]3 Beds (2 Bedrolls and 1 bed)[/*]\r<br />[*]Bar (With stools and drinks)[/*]\r<br />[*]Dining Room[/*]\r<br />[*]Study[/*]\r<br />[*]Basement[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />There are no needed files for this. You should be able to play this mod without having any of the DLCs. You can run it with the SKSE Launcher or the original game launcher. Both are fine, just as long as you load the file first. The file should be able to work with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11370]Spouses Can Live Everywhere[/url] and I&#39;m going to see if I can get it to work with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249/?]Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions[/url].\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLING (WITHOUT NMM)\r<br />1. Download the file\r<br />2. Open the zip file\r<br />3. Copy the .esp file to your Skyrim/Data folder\r<br />4. Open the &#34;SkyrimLauncher&#34; application\r<br />5. Click on &#34;Data Files&#34;\r<br />6. Make sure &#34;AhrosedovahWatch.esp&#34; is loaded. I always uncheck then check the box (just in case), but you don&#39;t have to.\r<br />7. Click &#34;Play&#34;\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLING (WITH NMM)\r<br />*** IF YOU DO NOT HAVE NMM YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT HERE:  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager/?***\r<br />1. Click &#34;DOWNLOAD (NMM)&#34; which is in the top right corner\r<br />2. Let NMM do its thing\r<br />3. Play.\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re going to criticize my work, please don&#39;t hate on it and keep in mind that I only have access to Creation Kit, and that I&#39;m just starting. If you want me to do something, it would also be very helpful if you could tell me how to do it. Thanks&#33;",
