  "descriptionHtml": "This is the character that I most of the time play as. The face is somewhat dear to me....I cant get away from it no matter how many times I try to make a new face. It doesn&#39;t even make it any better that the face uses the basic sliders of character creation that I do not know why i like it so much. But... I do and I hope you guys come to like her too :)\r<br />The name Sharliah came about from my love of Karliah (my favorite skyrim character) &gt;_&lt; You cna always change the name though &#33;\r<br />\r<br />This is a save file and a preset file (and knowing most people on this site...most likely already know what to do with it)\r<br />But for those who don&#39;t, here is how to do it:\r<br />1. The save file will have an end called .ess ...place that file into your skyrim saved game folder..in mine its my documents/my games/skyrim/saves\r<br />2. the Chargen folder goes into your skse folder (you must have skse for a lot of things)\r<br />And that is all there is to know\r<br />\r<br />To get the look of her right, you should have:\r<br />1. UNP/UNPB/SEVENBASE body mods (idk if she will look the same on cbbe but you can try)\r<br />2. any skeleton mod that supports bbp if you are using bbp (shes just a face and a body) / make sure to have FNIS too\r<br />3. numenume elf ear by [b]numenume I use this for the elf ears :)\r<br />[/b]4. i made the face before installing race menu but since I made it into a preset in race menu, race menu is needed &#33; for the preset :)\r<br />5. Alternate start is needed since the save file starts you inside the alternate start room\r<br />6. Any texture works with this face however, to make her look like mine or in my pictures, you have to use:\r<br />Real Girls Realistic Body Texture for UNP UNPB and SeveNBase - WIP by [b]Zonzai and Seren4XX\r<br />[/b]7.The Eyes Of Beauty by [b]Gabriel Mailhot (but you dont need it...its just for nicer looking eyes :) )\r<br />[/b]That I believe is all that is needed for the save to work :)\r<br />\r<br />All credits go to the mod authors of all the mods I used for this character :) without them I wouldn&#39;t bee able to make her &gt;_&lt;\r<br />",
