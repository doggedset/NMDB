  "descriptionHtml": "I hate Maven BlackBriar so I made this.\r\n\r\nThis is an unmarked quest in the guise of a letter appearing outside the Whiterun Breezehome entrance (Whiterun player home) where it simply asks you to kill Maven BlackBriar.\r\n\r\nRead the letter to see how you gain your reward. I will not disclose any ways to do this easily unless people are having trouble doing this.\r\n\r\nThis is a game breaking quest IF you have not done any quests associated with Maven BlackBriar e.g. Thieves Guild, majority of Riften quests, Dark Botherhood ones & ofcourse parts of the Main story.\r\n\r\nI only suggest doing this is you absolutly hate Maven BlackBriar or have completed all quests associated with her. If Maven is made Jarl of Riften via the main storyline/Imperials win the Civil war then you may want to think extra hard.\r\n\r\nThis also edits Maven herself e.g. makes her un-essential & I think moves that special Script thing that prevents important NPCS from either accidently dying or dying from fighting.\r\n\r\nif Maven does not die I.e. goes to the floor struggling, \r\ntype this  in console; setessential 1336a 0",
