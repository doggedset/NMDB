  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][b]New Version:[/b]Â [/size][size=4][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/81182/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/81182/?[/url][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[s]THE NAME IS PRIEST IN THE GAME NOT PRIESTESS LIKE IN THE PHOTOS\r<br />The reasons why it is Priestess is because I&#39;m still running the older mod before I changed it.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s my second mod, Dragkol a DragonPriest follower to the game.\r<br />His voice is a male dark elf and he knows summon dragonpriest and all of the possible dragon priest spells. Lightfoot perk as well as perks related to DragonPriests. He levels with you. He also holds a copy of Konahrik he cannot equip.\r<br />\r<br />He is found in Whiterun at the Talos Shrine all day and night.\r<br />\r<br />Known bugs: He won&#39;t talk to you. I don&#39;t know exactly what causes this but it is possible that it is load order so put Dragkolfollower.esp above UFO if you have it.\r<br />You can also use him as a training post for skills as he won&#39;t put a bounty on you for attacking him. I recommend using tgm or tim mode so you won&#39;t die if/when he strikes back if you are low level.\r<br />\r<br />Other mods by me:\r<br />Delaney of the Pure Heart: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17988\r<br />Nikandros the Fallen: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=18251[/s]",
