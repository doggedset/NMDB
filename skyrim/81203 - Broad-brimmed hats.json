  "descriptionHtml": "A selection of broad-brimmed hats for player characters, based on Patrick Reece&#39;s Witchhunter Hat model (used by permission).  All can be crafted from leather at any tanning rack.  This is a stand-alone version, with additional textures, and does not replace any game files.\r<br />\r<br />KNOWN ISSUE:  Khajiit and Argonian character models use a very different head shape, which often conflicts with headgear.  Until I can find a way to eliminate serious clipping, these hats are not usable for such characters.\r<br />\r<br />In addition to the original Witchhunter&#39;s hat, the mod includes an assortment of new hats:\r<br />*Witchhunter&#39;s hat in black\r<br />*Black hat with a red cockade\r<br />*Brown hat with bear badge and feather\r<br />*Grey hat with wreath badge\r<br />*Imperialist&#39;s hat with Imperial Dragon cockade\r<br />*Inquisitor&#39;s hat with skull badge\r<br />*Inquisitor&#39;s hat in black\r<br />*Revolutionary&#39;s hat with French tricolor cockade\r<br />*Royalist&#39;s hat with Jagged Crown badge\r<br />*Swashbuckler&#39;s hat with lion badge and red feather\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />Add the Broad_Hat.esp and Broad_Hat.bsa files to the Skyrim Data folder, and activate.\r<br />VERSION 1.1:\r<br />Minor changes in appearance.  I think I&#39;ve corrected an alpha file problem with light and shadow.\r<br />KNOWN ISSUES:\r<br />There are minor conflicts with some hair styles.\r<br />CREDITS:\r<br />Patrick Reece&#39;s Witchhunter Hat mod (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5300/?):  used by permission, and with my thanks.\r<br />PERMISSION:\r<br />You have permission to use or adapt the resources in this module, for your own use or for release on the Nexus; but not to publish this material commercially.  Please give credit, to this mod and to Patrick Reece&#39;s Witchhunter mod.",
