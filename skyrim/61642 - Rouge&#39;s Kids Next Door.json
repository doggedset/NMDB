  "descriptionHtml": "Rouge&#39;s Kids Next Door adds a whole bunch of new kids to the game from all humanoid races. (Beast races may come in the future.) Most of the kids are adoptable and some are just there for those who use mods like Follower Live Package or Mixed Unit Tactics to override NPCs to be new followers. (Adoptable kids will will not be able to become followers through dialogue until they have been adopted, so non adoptable kids are there if you want them as followers without adopting.)",
