Please go to the [url=http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/324wma/skyrim_modding_contest_2_submission_thread/]submissions thread[/url] and check out all the awesome entries&#33;[/center][/i]\r<br />\r<br />Hello everybody&#33; This small mod is a voice-acted little dungeon I&#39;ve been working on and off for the &#34;Boss Battles&#34; modding contest. What could lie beneath the dusty sarcophagus lids?\r<br />\r<br />The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC, is fully navmeshed and has a handful of very lightweight scripts (courtesy of my [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58523/?]partner in crime[/url]), so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#1E90FF][center]== WHAT ==[/center][/color][/size]The new dungeon, a mysterious crypt west of Winterhold  aptly named [i]Icebound Crypt[/i], is a tiny two-cell affair, nothing huge. All containers in the new dungeon are safe and will not respawn, so it can be used as a player home if you so desire. Inside you may or may not find some new weapons, a whole buncha loot, and more. \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;d recommend you install [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47956/?]this[/url] mod by a certain [i]very talented modder[/i] to increase your enjoyment.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]Slightly spoilery super-duper awesome trailer below&#33;[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]pefizljH1xw[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#1E90FF][center]== WHERE ==[/center][/color][/size]To get started, head to Winterhold and read the note stuck to the entrance of The Frozen Hearth. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#1E90FF][center]== HOW ==[/center][/color][/size]To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#1E90FF][center]== FAQ ==[/center][/color][/size][b]- LORE&#33;&#33;&#33;1 NOT LORE FRIENDLY&#33;&#33; DUMB AND STUPID ARGH&#33;&#33;&#33;[/b]\r<br />- [url=http://i.imgur.com/NIXnCtS.gif]Indeed.[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]- TOO MUCH BUILD UP AND TOO LITTLE REWARD AUGH&#33;&#33;&#33;[/b]\r<br />- [url=http://i.imgur.com/ulMiiOj.gif]Indeed.[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]- I hate [thing] and [thing] and [thing]&#33; You should have done [thing] and [thing] instead&#33; And while you&#39;re at it remove [thing] and [thing] and add [thing] and [thing]&#33; And [thing] is NOT LORE FRIENDLY&#33; FIX THIS&#33;[/b]\r<br />- This isn&#39;t a restaurant. If you don&#39;t like something, use the console to disable it, remove it with the Creation Kit or TESEDIT, or sell it off. [url=http://i.imgur.com/XumZOt2.gif]In other words...[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]- I don&#39;t like the new crafting stations&#33; They make no sense or something&#33; Change them&#33;[/b]\r<br />- Nah. Using the same furniture every single time gets boring, and I was having trouble fitting everything in. [url=http://i.imgur.com/ymt1qd1.jpg?1]In other words...[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]- I&#39;m lagging all over the place&#33; Help&#33;[/b]\r<br />- There&#39;s a lot of stuff in the new dungeon. I optimized it with roombounds and the like, but, if you&#39;re playing on a coal-powered machine, you will definitively have some performance loss. Sorry.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- I hate everything being static&#33; I wanna pick things up&#33;[/b]\r<br />- First, the place is tiny and clutter would be flying around all the time. Second, it would also greatly hurt framerate to have so many little things moving around at once and the dungeon is already rather demanding. And third, it gives me much more freedom when it comes to decoration. [url=http://i.imgur.com/AYOKaDI.gif]In other words...[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Can I use some of these files on my own mod?[/b]\r<br />- A bunch of things I&#39;m using are already modder&#39;s resources, so just look around the credits tab to look for what you&#39;d like to use. If you cannot find the thing you want there, it probably means I made it myself. Feel free to ask if you&#39;re not sure.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Is this compatible with [mod]?[/b]\r<br />- If you have a mod that makes heavy changes to Winterhold, there could be issues, although my mod is as clean as I could make it. If you find any conflicts, please let me know so I can list them here.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- How come the mod looks different in my game than your screenshots?[/b]\r<br />- I am using several retextures in my own game and my own SweetFX preset, so results may vary.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- The mod is awful/glitchy/buggy/etc. I am going to uninstall it and I must let everybody know&#33;[/b]\r<br />- Sad to see you go~\r<br />\r<br />[b]- The mod sucks&#33;[/b]\r<br />- So does a vaccuum cleaner ;)\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][center][color=#1E90FF]FOR THE FULL LIST OF CREDITS, PLEASE CHECK THE &#34;CREDITS AND PERMISSIONS&#34; TAB [img]http://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/wub.gif[/img]\r<br />[/color][/center][/size]\r<br />[center][color=#1E90FF][/color][center][center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/donate/?mode=straight&id=2543917][img]http://i.imgur.com/V6qmsU9.png[/img][/url][/center][/center][/center]\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
