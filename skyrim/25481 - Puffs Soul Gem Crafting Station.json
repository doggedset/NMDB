  "descriptionHtml": "****************************************************************************\r\n* Soul Gem Crafting Station by Puff The Magic Dragon *\r\n****************************************************************************\r\n\r\n===========\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis mod adds a new crafting station to the Arch Mage\\'s Quarters, AFTER completing the College of Winterhold series of quests, which allows you to craft soul gem fragments into full soul gems.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the College of Winterhold series of quests, a courier races to you to deliver a letter. Turns out the Psijic Order wants to express their gratitude and is having a special gift delivered to your new quarters at the college.\r\n\r\nThere are already a plethora of mods of this sort in existence, but I felt most of them lacked something important - a dedicated crafting station for soul gems. Then I found Enhanced Soul Gems by Tasciovanus and liked that he had created a dedicated crafting station, but I saw room for improvement. I especially preferred the recipes from CS Soul Fragments to Soul Gems - Now LORECRAFT Compatible by Mush and I liked the idea of a dedicated unique model for the crafting station.\r\n\r\nThis mod combines these features with quest interaction (I\\'m not cool enough for a full custom quest yet) to make what I feel is a more complete soul gem crafting mod without any of the extra bells and whistles.\r\n\r\n\r\n================\r\nSpecial Features\r\n================\r\nUnique dedicated model for the crafting station. To use, activate like normal!\r\nYou can pick up and move the crafting station (hold E)!\r\nOr carry it in your inventory (activate while sneaking)!\r\nSo you can put this station in your preferred player home!\r\n\r\nRecipes as follows:\r\n1 soul gem fragment => 1 soul gem fragment: polished\r\n2 soul gem fragment: polished => petty soul gem\r\n3 soul gem fragment: polished => lesser soul gem\r\n4 soul gem fragment: polished => common soul gem\r\n5 soul gem fragment: polished => greater soul gem\r\n6 soul gem fragment: polished => grand soul gem\r\n6 soul gem fragment: polished + 1 daedra heart => black soul gem\r\n\r\nThe soul gem fragment recipes will only show up if you have said fragments in your inventory.\r\n\r\n============\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nRecommended NMM:\r\nClick and run!\r\n\r\nManual:\r\nExtract the files directly into your <game folder>\\\\Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n=============\r\nCompatibility\r\n=============\r\nThis mod touches nothing vanilla, so it should be compatible with any mod out there.\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\nNotes\r\n=====\r\nSince there are several types of soul gem fragments, it was necessary, as Mush so delicately did, to make an intermediate item that all the fragments get converted into. Otherwise you\\'d need a million recipes for any conceivable combination of fragments. I completely ripped off his \\\"polished soul gem fragment\\\" but left the polished at the end for easier sorting.\r\n\r\nKnown Bug\r\nWhen crafting soul gems, your enchantment skill will go up REALLY fast. This cannot be helped, it\\'s something in the algorithm Bethesda uses to calculate skill usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n===============\r\nVersion History\r\n===============\r\nVersion 1.0 - Version 1 - adds crafting station with quest interaction\r\n\r\n\r\n===============\r\nCredit goes to\r\n===============\r\nMush for his great mod that helped inspire me! [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19063]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19063[/url]\r\nTasciovanus for his other great mod that helped inspire me further! [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8545]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8545[/url]\r\n\r\nAll the users on the TES forums who helped me figure out some of this junk - that means YOU Mujuro!\r\nThe CS Wiki for all the tutorials and reference and the users who update and contribute to the wiki.\r\nBlender and all the users who\\'ve written wonderful tutorials for it.\r\nNifTools and the NifTools team and all the hard work they put into making such wonderful tools available.\r\n\r\nI know I didn\\'t use half these tools for this mod, but they still get credit cause they\\'re awesome.\r\n\r\nAnd many thanks to Bethesda for making such an awesome game and for making the creation kit that lets people like me with way too much free time modify the game.\r\n\r\nThanks to God for creating us all!",
