  "summary": "A highly customizable launcher for all of the main Elder Scrolls games (and now Fallout games too&#33;). It allows for one-click launching for vanilla games, modded games, and even launching with DOSBox for the older games. It supports a secondary executable launched by right+clicking a game as well, handy for your mod manager, or anything else.",

If you think this is amazing and awesome and the best thing in the world, by all means let me know&#33; I made it for the heck of it, and I uploaded it for the heck of it.  If you think this is stupid and horrible, that&#39;s fine.  It isn&#39;t for everyone.  But don&#39;t feel the need to come here and say so.  Just don&#39;t use it if you don&#39;t care for it.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]The UI looks like a 5 year old made it.[/size]\r<br />Again, not a question.  Believe it or not, I am in fact not a 5 year old, but a fully-functioning adult.  However, I am aware it looks bad, but it is a side effect of this being thrown together quickly with the intention of fixing it up later, which I am actively working on.  However, if it is so horrible then simply don&#39;t use it.  However, if you have constructive advice on how to improve it, please give it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]But Todd Howard didn&#39;t make all of these games&#33;[/size]\r<br />Yes, I&#39;m well aware, but does it really matter?  He was involved with a lot of them, and it is just a name, and a joke that got out of hand. \r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Now that you support Fallout games, the name Todd&#39;s TOILET doesn&#39;t really fit anymore because Fallout games aren&#39;t in Tamriel.[/size]\r<br />Yeah, I know, but renaming everything now would be very time consuming and introduce major complications I won&#39;t go into here.  If I feel particularly ambitious in the future I&#39;ll look into it, but for now, it will stay the same.  Fallout support is just a feature. \r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Credits\r<br />[/size][size=2]Big thanks to Nexus user bub166 for his help and input in building the original program&#33;\r<br />Big thanks to Nexus user TheSkoomaKat for their help and input improving the support for DOS-based games&#33;[/size]\r<br />The banner images for the game launch buttons are from [url=http://steambanners.booru.org/index.php]http://steambanners.booru.org/index.php[/url].  All credit for them goes to Bethesda for the logos contained within, and the talented people at that website who created the actual banner images.  \r<br />The likeness of Todd Howard&#39;s face belongs to Todd Howard and his mother/father alone.  I claim no ownership, nor responsibility for it.  \r<br />Anything else copyrighted in the program belongs solely to its creators, and I do not own it in any way.  The only part of this program that belongs to me is the actual code that makes it work.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]In all seriousness though, Todd Howard, you are awesome.  Thanks for making these amazing games&#33;&#33;&#33;[/size]",
