  "summary": "Adds an Unarmored skill into Skyrim along with its own perks and perk tree. Takes up one of the skill tree slots created by Skyrim Custom Skills main file. Now also compatible with Merged Thievery Skill.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]DESCRIPTION[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />This mod adds an Unarmored skill to Skyrim along with perks and its own perk tree. Although not technically dependant on it, this file REQUIRES the main [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56249/?]SCS - Skyrim Custom Skills[/url] files to work. [color=#e06666]Please visit the Main files&#39;s page for details about the mod&#39;s mechanics and installation instructions[/color].\r<br />\r<br />As of version 2.0, there is also a Lockpicking version which uses the perk tree slot created by &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21792/?]Merged Thievery Skill[/url]&#34; by LukeH. This version is &#34;standalone&#34; and does NOT need the main SCS file to work. Just download it and make sure it is loaded AFTER the Merged Thievery Skill mod in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]IMPORTANT UPDATE NOTE[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />If updating to version 2.0 from an older version, make sure you ALSO update to version 2.1 (or higher) of the Main file - bad things will happen otherwise...\r<br />Also, the [color=#e06666]Mage Armor perk has been removed from this skills perk tree[/color] because using the Lockpicking version of this mod would cause it to be both in vanilla Alteration tree and here. As of version 2.1, it is integrated into the Sorcery skill (as it should have been from the start).\r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]ABOUT UNARMORED[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />The Unarmored skill should make it easier for players not wearing any armor. It is raised by taking hits and running while unarmored. The idea is that you can dodge attacks, not that you have iron skin (although version 2.0 includes the very same perk :-D). It also adds perks that encourage you to wear poor (or rich) clothes. \r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]PERKS[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />Well Clad\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 0/20/40/60/80\r<br />While wearing clothes instead of armor, you have a 10%/20%/30%/40%/50% chance to avoid a melee or ranged hit.\r<br />\r<br />Pilgrim\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 20/40/60/80/100, Well Clad\r<br />While unarmored and bearing a staff, you can use your staff as lightningrod to increase your shock resistance by 20%/40%/60%/80%/100%.\r<br />\r<br />Traveller of the North\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 20/40/60/80/100, Pilgrim\r<br />Travelling the northern provinces just with a pair of shoes and a tunic has made you accustomed to their climate. While unarmored, your frost resistance is \r<br />increased by 10%/20%/30%/40%/50%.\r<br />\r<br />Traveller of the South\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 20/40/60/80/100, Pilgrim\r<br />Travelling the southern provinces just with a pair of shoes and a tunic has made you accustomed to their climate. While unarmored, your fire resistance is increased by 10%/20%/30%/40%/50%.\r<br />\r<br />Magus\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 60/80/100, Traveller of the North\r<br />While unarmored, your Magicka is increased by 50/100/150.\r<br />\r<br />Embrace Magic\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 100, Magus, NOT Defy Magic\r<br />Armor does not distract you while you are harvesting magical energies. While unarmored, you regenerate Magicka 200% faster but you are 100% weaker to magic. You cannot embrace and defy magic at the same time.\r<br />\r<br />Beggar\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 35, Well Clad\r<br />You look like a beggar. While wearing poor clothes, bandits will no longer bother to attack you and vendors will take pity on you and reduce their prices.\r<br />\r<br />Noble\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 40, Beggar\r<br />While wearing expensive clothes and looking important, no one will dare to oppose you: you will get more money for selling at vendors and intimidation attempts will almost never fail.\r<br />\r<br />Swift Swing\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 35, Well Clad\r<br />While unarmored, all your attacks are 10% faster.\r<br />\r<br />Light Swing\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 60, Swift Swing\r<br />While unarmored, power attacks consume 30% less stamina.\r<br />\r<br />Iron Skin\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 30/60/90, Well Clad\r<br />While unarmored, your damage resistance is increased by 20/40/60.\r<br />\r<br />Defy Magic\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 100, Iron Skin, NOT Magic Embrace \r<br />You defy magic and it just passes through your clothes without affecting you. You regenerate Magicka 50% slower but while unarmored, your magic resistance is increased by 50%. You cannot embrace and defy magic at the same time.\r<br />\r<br />Incorporeal\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 60, Well Clad\r<br />While unarmored, you become highly resistant to normal weapons. You take 90% less damage from weapons of the following material types: wood, iron, steel, draugr and imperial.\r<br />\r<br />Skinsmith\r<br />Requires: Unarmored 80, Incorporeal\r<br />Incorporeal also applies to Dwarven, Elven, Orcish, Glass and Ebony weapons - but only with half the magnitude and only if you have the corresponding smithing perks.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]CREDITS[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />Bethesda - for Skyrim and Creation Kit&#33;\r<br />The TES5Edit team - for TES5Edit, most of SCS was created with this sweet tool&#33;\r<br />Mator - for Automation Tools for TES5Edit, I could never have worked with skill trees the way I did without the script provided there&#33; \r<br /> ",
