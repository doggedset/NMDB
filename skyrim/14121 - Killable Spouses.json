  "summary": "Ever thought about killing your spouse, but didn\\'t want to because you were told that you wouldn\\'t be able to marry again afterwards?\r\n\r\nWell, now you can.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Y5BLY.png[/img]\r\n(While I\\'ll be referring to your spouse as \\'wife\\', it\\'ll work with husbands too)[/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/m331u.png[/img]\r\nDoes your wife\\'s food taste like garbage, is she nagging you, or is she just plain ugly? Whatever your reasons, I bet you\\'ve thought about killing your wife. I know I have, and if you agree this mod is for you. Until now, you weren\\'t able to marry again after you killed your wife, but now you can. This mod alters 2 existing quests and 1 existing Shrine.\r\n\r\n[b]Features:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Enables re-marriage functionality, before you marry anyone.\r\n[*]Enables re-marriage functionality, when you\\'re already married, but haven\\'t killed your wife yet.\r\n[*]Enables re-marriage functionality, when you\\'ve already killed your wife, by activating the Shrine of Forgiveness in the Temple of Mara.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Coming features:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][s]Enable divorce functionality.[/s]\r\n[*][s]No more bitching, just because you spit her in the face and broke her heart multiple times.[/s]\r\n[*][s]Multiple wives..[/s]\r\n[/list]\r\nThis mod will no longer be updated. v0.2b is and will be the last version of Killable Spouses. I\\'m currently developing a bigger overhaul that\\'ll include all the features.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/vU197.png[/img]\r\nNow you might think, it\\'s a new object, but it\\'s not. I simply used the already placed Shrine of Mara, and attached a litte script to it. Please note, that you can\\'t just go visiting any of the Shrines of Mara. It has to be the one in the Temple of Mara.\r\n\r\nBy default, the marriage quest is killed right after you say \\\"I do\\\" to your wife (even though you don\\'t mean any word of it), but this script will revive it, and by that action ensure the re-marriage functionality is enabled.\r\n\r\nYou only need to use this, if you\\'ve killed your wife prior to installing this mod. That said, the script won\\'t even run if you try.\r\n\r\nI also added a little message to let you know, that Mara has forgiven you your sins. :)\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/0S6PE.png[/img]\r\n[b]These instructions only applies to manual installation, obviously:[/b]\r\n\r\n1. Drag the folder \\\"Data\\\" into your main Skyrim folder (usually located at Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim).\r\n2. Confirm any overwrite/merge warnings (if asked).\r\n3. Make sure, the plugin file is selected in the \\\"Data Files\\\" list before you start the game.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, just delete the files. But remember to remove all of them!\r\n\r\nAnd, for your own sake, REMEMBER to backup your savegames before you use this mod. It\\'s still in beta, and as such I can not be held responsible for any damage this mod might do to your game (or wife). Use at your own risk!\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/DzkKj.png[/img]\r\nThis mod will conflict with any other mod, that alters the marriage quests. More specifically the [b]RelationshipMarriage[/b] and [b]RelationshipMarriageFIN[/b] quests. Furthermore, this mod depend on the following quests to be untouched:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]RelationshipMarriage\r\n[*]RelationshipMarriageBreakUp (not yet, but will as soon as the divorce functionality is implemented)\r\n[*]RelationshipMarriageFIN\r\n[*]RelationshipMarriageWedding\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/M7mEs.png[/img]\r\n[b]v0.2b (02/04-2012 GMT+1)[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Re-marriage functionality is now enabled for savegames where the wife is already killed.\r\n[*]Added the Shrine of Forgiveness script, in order to inject the functionality described above, into the game.\r\n[/list]\r\n[b]v0.1b (01/04-2012 GMT+1)[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Initial release.\r\n[/list]",
