  "descriptionHtml": "This patch enables the AP animations through new dialog for slaves captured using Paradise Halls.\r<br />No scripts were altered and very few dialog conditions were changed.\r<br />\r<br />For use with Paradise Halls 0.7.3\r<br />\r<br />Installation is simple, It&#39;s a single esp file. use wryebash or whichever file manager you like, or manually extract to your game data folder.\r<br />This will work for all previous captured slaves as well as any new slaves. There is one negative side effect currently, in that you need to work a bit harder to get the let&#39;s talk option for non slave playmates. I am in the process of finding a better solution there while also adding in dialog to command your slave to perform tasks similar to the companion options.\r<br />Any suggestions are of course welcome. and please report any bugs you find.",
