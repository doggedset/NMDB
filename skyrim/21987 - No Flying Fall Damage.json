NONSENSE I SAY.\r\n\r\nWhen birds land on the ground, are they met with the sweet embrace of death? Nay.\r\n\r\nThis mod fixes that nonsense!\r\n\r\nAs a Vampire Lord, if you are in your flying spell stance, you no longer take ANY fall damage. But only if you are flying!\r\n\r\nIf you are on the ground using your claws, you will die. This only affects the Vampire Lord form, and only in flying stance!\r\n\r\n= How!?! =\r\n\r\nThis mod, at run time, adds a perk to the player that checks\r\n1. If you are the player\r\n2. If you are in vampire lord form\r\n3. If you are flying in the lord form\r\n\r\nWhen those conditions are met, you take 0 fall damage. So much more sensible!\r\n\r\nIt also means this should work flawlessly, and not cause issues with anything. Since it doesn\\'t alter any existing scripts, spells, blah blah. \r\n\r\n= Credit/Permission =\r\n\r\nDanke Bethesda/Steam/Nexus\r\n\r\nYou may use this mod, translate it, gut it, merge it, blah, however you like. Just give credit where it is due!",
