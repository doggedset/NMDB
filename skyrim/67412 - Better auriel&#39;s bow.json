  "summary": "tired of a weak elven bow with an enchantment that can be easily surpassed by an enchanter with modest skill? Well, no more&#33; Auriels bow is now truly a weapon of the gods. The ultimate undead killing machine.",
  "descriptionHtml": "the bow now does fire damage on top of the original sun damage enchantment.\r<br />the bow is now lighter for sneak archers\r<br />\r<br />It now also does more base damage\r<br />\r<br />The bow will turn almost all undead (including draugr deathlords) with the exclusion of nightlord and nightmaster vampires\r<br />\r<br />it is now considered a silver weapon (for increased damage against undead)\r<br />\r<br />it also has the AOE explosion effect of dawnbreaker\r<br />\r<br />enchantment is now unlimited\r<br />\r<br />WARNING: this bow is overpowered. I made this for myself. I have a lvl 225 necromage vampire character.\r<br />\r<br />**Unique weapons should be powerful** it is lore freindly and the only reason is to not be game breaking in the eyes of bethesda\r<br />\r<br />this bow is not game breaking, even with full archery on novice difficulty it will only barely one shot a deathlord\r<br />\r<br />it is powerful in ways other than damage\r<br />\r<br />if you want to try out my character, you can find it here\r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66699/?",
