There is no .esp file so it will not go against your mod count. I didn&#39;t \r<br />\r<br />like the vanilla ones so I made these replacers. This mod is not for everyone but at least its an option. Very skimpy; shows \r<br />\r<br />a lot of skin, most likely not so lore friendly. Uses vanilla textures.\r<br />\r<br />I made this from a custom body shape based off my DMRA mods from Oblivion. Due to the low tollerances (.007) larger than the \r<br />\r<br />body, I most likely will not convert to any other body type. If somebody else wants to they can, just credit my work.\r<br />\r<br />mods in screenshots include:\r<br />\r<br />Hair: Apachii SkyHair female pack\r<br />Skin: Sporty Sexy Sweat, SG Textures Renewal CBBE\r<br />Eyes: The Eyes of Beauty\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/3664/updatesb.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Out of the gate I altered the female boots and gloves body slots to function correctly with these armors. They now only use \r<br />\r<br />the feet and hands slots respectively so as not to have invisible parts. This may cause issues in the wrists and shins if used with other armors.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4153/requir.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Dawnguard DLC\r<br />\r<br />Calientes CBBE body mod installed and running in your game.(textures)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Â \r<br />[img]http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/2482/installa.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Unzip Data file to a temporary location \r<br />Check folder paths and make adjustments if needed\r<br />copy/paste into Skyrim folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />\r<br />Delete the included dawnguardbody files and the boots and gloves\r<br />in the data_meshes_dlc01_armor_dawnguard folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/8579/creditslo.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Caliente for CBBE\r<br />Edhildil for the armor\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Tools used:\r<br />=======\r<br />Blender\r<br />Nifscope\r<br />GIMP 2\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to all above and to Skyrim Nexus.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/4562/usaget.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />If you want to use my meshes in your mod please give the proper credits listed in your mod readme/description.
