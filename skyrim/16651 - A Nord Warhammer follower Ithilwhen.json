Unfortunately, my scripting skill was not enough to manage a decent and stable script, so I was forced to use CM Companion Mod to have custom NPC  by my side, helping me in fighting Daedra. I was not too happy, but this was enough for me. Today, I am in condition to do my followers for Skyrim.  I like to share them with community. \r\nThis is one of them. \r\nI hope you can enjoy travelling Skyrim in good company. \r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis mod adds to the Skyrim Gameworld a female Nord Warhammer Warrior follower named Ithilwhen that can be found in Whiterun. \r\nShe can be married.\r\nThere are 2 versions: Not essential and essential.\r\nUse only one version!\r\n\r\nHelp, endorsement and screenshots are welcome.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nYou can find her in Jorrvaskr in Whiterun, and there she will come back once dismissed. \r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nShe has her own Class, as well her own combat style and in her inventory there are some money and arrows, a bow, some lockpicks and a new craftable and improvable weapon, the Daedric Warhammer of Firing Ithil. It requires Daedric smithing perk. This weapon is a little bit overpowered, and was developed to give her something more in combat situations. It is not a cheat weapon, but is stronger then basic Daedric warhammer. You are not forced to forge, improve and use it, you can simply leave it to her, or if you don\\'t like it, simply do not use or ignore it. \r\nPlease avoid comment on how strong it is, they are useless. \r\nAll these items will be useful to her and player, if liked. This was an attemp to redo my Oblivion\\'s Ithilwhen Companion, but Creation Kit resources are limited and was not possible to exactly rebuild her face. She is not so bad after all, I dedicated myself to obtain a good warhammer 2H warrior, not a Barbie doll. There are too many or them online in this moment, if you like Barbies you can simply download one of them an not Ithil. \r\nPlease avoid useless comments on how much beautiful or ugly she is.\r\n\r\nI use these mods to help functions of my followers:\r\n\r\n1) multFollowers0.4b; it is useful bo build a team of followers.\r\n\r\n2) CM Companion Level Mod; here is the link:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13790\r\nThis mod can make level up followers, keeping them ever in condition to help you.\r\n\r\n3)Ask Follower Skill; here is the link:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10675\r\nThis mod can make you know all abilities of your followers.\r\n\r\nI do not use UFO, if you use it you are doing it at your own risk.\r\n\r\nIn my system are installed these aesthetic  mods:\r\n\r\nCBBE V3 (standard body) and the hip texture compatability pack:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nBella\\'s Better Females version 3:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nCover Eyes (eyes 1 file):\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869\r\n\r\nJoseph Anthonys Lip Gloss for Better Females by Joseph Anthony\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13860\r\n\r\nNo More Blocky Faces by Xenius\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=30\r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t use this combination of mods, her look will be different from the look of the screenshots.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also download my other mods:\r\n\r\nA Breton Witchunter follower Samhair\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14686\r\n\r\nA Cute Redguard Follower Calypso\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13744\r\n\r\nA Nord Warrior Follower Shanya\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12893\r\n\r\nA Wood Elf Archer follower Glaween\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13258\r\n\r\nA Wood Elf Ranger follower Sharwyn\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15940\r\n\r\nA Woodelf Archer follower Cinthowen\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15198\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n\r\nI like very much Nexus Mod Manager, it is perfect for me. I suggest to use it, but....your choice.\r\n\r\nPick which method you are going to use for installation:\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Installation\r\n- = or = -\r\nManual installation \r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager installation:\r\nDownload the file with Nexus Mod Manager. Activate it. Done.\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\nPlace the zip file\\'s contents into your Skyrim/data folder to install and be sure to activate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing.\r\n\r\nNMM downloading problem.\r\nI have seen that in early hours after uploading a file, NMM can not give the possibility to download new files using the button \\\"download with manager\\\". An error message says that file do not exist. After one or two hours, the problem is automatically solved. I don\\'t know why this happens, maybe it is related to high traffic that Nexus server is forced to tolerate. \r\n\r\nIn this case, you can follow these instructions:  \r\n1) Download the file manually.\r\n2) Open NMM.\r\n3) Hit the black arrow located in the left high button and choose \\\" Add Mod from file\\\".\r\n4) Locate and select the file that you have downloaded manually. \r\n5) Hit \\\"open\\\" button.\r\n6) From Mod\\'s  list, select the created file and activate it. Done.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\nPick which method you are going to use for uninstall based on how you installed it:\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Uninstall\r\n- = or = -\r\nManual Uninstall\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Uninstall\r\nOpen Nexus mod Manager and deactivate the file EAIthilwhen. Done.\r\n\r\n\r\nManual Uninstall\r\n\r\nRemove the zip file\\'s contents from your Skyrim/data folder to uninstall and be sure to deactivate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing.\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n=======\r\n07/May/2012 Version 1.0 is the initial version of this file.\r\n07/May/2012 Version 1.1 Simplified A.I., slower speed. \r\n\r\nUpgrading from version 1.0: It is necessary to remove all items from inventory of Ithilwhen 1.0 before upgrading to version 1.1, then deactivate version 1.0 and activate version 1.1. If you do not follow the instructions, all itms in your inventory will be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nNone known.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nIf you decide to marry her, it is better to tell her where she can live with you BEFORE she leaves the temple in Riften.\r\nThis follower was developed to work with Multi followers, CM Companion Level mod and Ask Follower Skills. Running it with these mods means keeping it clear and bug free.\r\nThis do not means that it can\\'t be used under UFO;  I haven\\'t UFO, so I cannot say what can happen if you use it under UFO itself.\r\nTalking of load order, it is fundamental to run this file AFTER UFO itself, this can avoid best part of eventual problems.\r\nI can\\'t see any reason to develop a version specifically to run with UFO. If my files are clear without it, eventual problems are to be considered of UFO itself, not mine. \r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0, 2012/May/07 - Initial release.\r\n1.1, 2012/May/08 - Simplified A.I. to avoid CTD. Speed reduced to 100\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nYou can find me on TESNexus as eamico\r\nYou can send me an email here: eamico@tiscali.it\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\nThanks to TESNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\nThanks to Apachii for ApachiiSkyHair.\r\nSpecial thanks to Blackie for his CM New Companions mod that includes a top-notch detailed tutorial on how to create Skyrim companions without the face discoloration bug.
