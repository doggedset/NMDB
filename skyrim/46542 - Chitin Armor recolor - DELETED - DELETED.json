  "descriptionHtml": "Mostly this is up because I was unable to actually find any mods changing the appearance of the chitin light armor. Maybe I wasn't looking in the right place, I dunno. The chitin armor to me looked really ugly, which sucked cause Teldryn Sero is by far my favorite follower. So I recolored the armor.\r\n\r\nThis is in no way perfect. It was the best I could manage and better then it was before. Well in my opinion anyways. I know this isn't the most popular armor by a long shot but like I said its just here cause there's not much else so whatever.\r\n\r\nTo install just download and put it in the appropriate spot in the skyrim data folder.\r\n\r\nDragonborn required for obvious reasons.",
