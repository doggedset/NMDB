  "descriptionHtml": "Introducing Elena&#33; She&#39;s a nord follower that can be found in the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. She is fully voiced by the brilliant voice actress NAMEHERE with 2000+ lines of dialogue and (almost) completely quest aware. I highly recommend picking her up at the start of a new playthrough so you can get the full experience. She was designed to be the perfect friend/companion for the Dragonborn, because Skyrim is as lonely as it is cold sometimes.\r<br />\r<br />[center]BACKSTORY/STATS/PERSONALITY\r<br />\r<br />NAME: Elena Wind-Chaser\r<br />RACE: Nord.\r<br />WEAPON OF CHOICE: One handed swords, or daggers.\r<br />\r<br />QUICK BIOGRAPHY SYNOPSIS: (Most of the fun is getting to know it from her perspective&#33;)[/center]\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0 Includes:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Main Quest Awareness\r<br />[*]Her Own Quest\r<br />[*]All vanilla factions (The Companions, Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, College of Winterhold, Imperial army, Stormcloak army)\r<br />[*]Dialogue for 50+ various side quests&#33;\r<br />[*]Chatter + Banter\r<br />[*]Optional Romance Questline + married life dialogue (Open to female characters as well as male&#33;)\r<br />[*]Hearthfire support\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Coming soon:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Dragonborn + Dawnguard awareness\r<br />[*]Dialogue for every single side quest in the vanilla game\r<br />[*]Her own horse (for now the Convenient Horses mod should work if you need her to have one)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[size=5]REQUIRED[/size]\r<br />[size=3]Skyrim.esm + update.esm\r<br />the latest version of skse\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=5]RECOMMENDED\r<br />[/size][size=3]Convenient Horses[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]**Warning/disclaimer** I[/b] have not tested her out with any follower overhaul mods because I don&#39;t use them, so I&#39;m not sure if they are compatible with Elena or not.
