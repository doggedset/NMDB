  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\r<br />[size=8]Extinguished Daytime Fires and Lights[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=6][color=Blue]Update::[/color][/size][/center]\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]There is now a new mod Called Immersive Content - Realistic Outdoor Lights which is replacing this one. It is very much overhauled, have an MCM menu to control the light on/off time. Also have support for Dragonborn, Dawnguard and can now be used with exterior modules of ELFX, RLO and so on.\r<br />\r<br />Please have in mind that this mod is &#34;OVERHAULED&#34; so you might get bugs with an excisting savegame of this mod. I have not tested it widely, so i can&#39;t say it&#39;s a smart thing to do. New save game is probably best, or just try it anyway and tell me of your success :)[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]Mod Can be found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68454/?]HERE[/url][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][/center]\r<br />[center][size=6]What is it about?[/size][/center]\r<br />[center][size=4][color=orange]This mod adds more lanterns, Braziers and Torches around the land of skyrim, all these are scriptcontrolled and will change with the time of Day.\r<br />At night all lights will burn with the fire animation enabled, during day the fire will be disabled so in other words my mission is to make skyrim feel more realistic during day and night instead of fires burning bright 24/7.I also included the lightsources themselves in the script so fires and lights will go out at the same time.\r<br />\r<br />The main version turns all lights off at 06.00 am and turns back on again at 08.00pm.\r<br />There are 3 different settings available for you to choose from[/color]:\r<br />[color=orange]This mod only changes exterior lights, i have done so by hand in almost all of skyrim and i have one rules when i place lights and/or add them to the script:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=lightblue]If there are men or Mer present, there can be light, this to add realism.[/color]\r<br />[color=orange]Although i realize that i can have missed some places or made a bad descission on another you are welcome to give me feedback and i might consider changing it or adding lights if itâ€™s missing.\r<br />I have played with this mod on since i started and i enjoi building on it as i go forward, so in other words, this mod is not something i packed up in a few days, this mod have been worked on for a long time, i already planned it before the creation kit released, but was unsure how to approach it to begin with. Hope you enjoi the immersion this mod can give as well&#33;[/color][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=6][color=Blue]F.A.Q[/color][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q. I see that you have a scripted mod, will this script persist if i remove the mod?[/b]\r<br />A.  [color=lightsalmon]No, it will not persist after the removal of this mod.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q. Why is&#39;nt the mod on G.E.M.S anymore?[/b]\r<br />A.  [color=lightsalmon]I got a message from the author last year that my mod was to similar to two other very popular ones (claralux and LoS) and that it would be removed from the list because of that. Personally i think it&#39;s also because the mod is&#39;nt updated frequently enough. [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q. Why is&#39;nt the mod on steam workshop?[/b]\r<br />A. [color=lightsalmon]Simple, because people there are ungrateful shitheads, so i have actually removed all my mods from the workshop. Nexus ftw.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q. Why is&#39;nt this mod more popular?[/b]\r<br />A. [color=lightsalmon]I have done what i can do without forsaking the main goal of this mod, why it is&#39;nt popular i do not know, it could be that people do not understand what the mod does or they think it&#39;s to similar to claralux and lanterns of skyrim.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q. Does it affect performance much?[/b]\r<br />A. [color=lightsalmon]No, I built this mod With performance in mind, i have barely placed extra lights, in fact i even \r<br />    removed some for better immersion.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q. Why are you trying to copy claralux/lanterns of skyrim?[/b]\r<br />A. [color=lightsalmon]I&#39;m not, never even tried to, this mod was started long before any of them released, i offer a \r<br />    different type of exterior lighting mod that turns not just the lighting off during day, but also the\r<br />    flame animation will disable.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q. Are you saying that your mod is better?[/b]\r<br />A. [color=lightsalmon]No, first of all i made this mod for myself, it was&#39;nt before i had used it for many months i actually \r<br />    decided to share it with the rest, my mod is not better in any way, just different.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q. Ok, so the fires are turning themselves off, will you make guards who patrol light them With \r<br />    animation for more realism?[/b]\r<br />A. [color=lightsalmon]Boy, i wish i could. The thing is, im a 3d modeler, not a scripter, but if anyone wants to \r<br />    collaborate and have good scripting knowlegde i might consider trying to do exactly that, belive\r<br />    me, i have though of this exact thing when i started using the script, but my interest in scripting is \r<br />    not big and the few scripters i&#39;ve asked either does&#39;nt answer or is&#39;nt interested.\r<br />\r<br />    My only concern when it comes to having extra scripted NPC&#39;s like this is that they will bug and ruin \r<br />    the experience instead of become more immersive. If it would be implemented it would have to be\r<br />    in addition to the Automatic system.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]sOd9AdhVgaU[/youtube][youtube]gWY-LivGPGc[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Many things can be the cause of mod failure i suggest looking at this [url=http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Troubleshooting#tab=Mods_and_Savegames]link[/url] before you do anything else\r<br />\r<br />Downloading [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D6]BOSS[/url] and let it check load order for you, it will also detect dirty edits that is bad or specificly UTD&#39;s.\r<br />\r<br />Using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25859]Tes5Edit[/url] to clean out mods is a good way of getting sorted, learn it, endorse it, enjoi your game.",
