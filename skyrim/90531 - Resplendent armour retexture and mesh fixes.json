  "descriptionHtml": "[img]https://i.imgur.com/WvQS3vz.jpg[/img][b]\n<br />\n<br />INTRODUCTION &amp; SUMMARY[/b]\n<br />The resplendent armour is a beautiful armour put together by sarcasticshark: it has a very unique and elegant aesthetic, however I felt like it could use some improvements in order to be brought to the next level. This mod consists of a full retexture of the armour made from scratch in high resolution as well as a plethora of fixes for the meshes mainly consisting of clipping fixes, mismatching vertexes fixes and closing some open areas that permitted to see inside the mesh. Some of the meshes have been redone from scratch (inventory models) and now represent the actual armour with complete fidelity. I've put countless hours into this mod (really a lot ) and I hope you find the results worth it. I will say it right now: I couldn't improve the resplendent armour beyond this point even if I tried.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]LIST OF FEATURES[/b]\n<br />-new high resolution and detailed textures for the resplendent armour (tattered version and greatsword not included as I don't have any particular interest in those)\n<br />-two available versions: 4k compressed diffuse, 4k compressed specular and 4k uncompressed normal (this version provides the best look but it is very demanding); 4k compressed diffuse, 4k compressed specular and 2k uncompressed normal (this version looks very similar to the other one but it is better for performance and it is recommended for gameplay)\n<br />-a plethora of clipping fixes for the mesh (ie: cloth was clipping through the cuirass while performing certain animations, belt was clipping a lot through the cuirass, leather gloves were clipping through the metal hand protection while weapon and spell wielding, etc.)\n<br />-many mismatching vertexes fixes for the mesh; the meshes now also have less open areas that allow you to see their insides\n<br />-new uv maps for all the meshes that get rid of texture stretching\n<br />-new meshes for the inventory models that give an accurate representation of the actual armour\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]IN-GAME INSTRUCTIONS[/b]\n<br />Nothing: just go in-game and the resplendent armour will have a brand new look!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]REQUIREMENTS[/b]\n<br />MANDATORY\n<br />-Skyrim\n<br />-SKSE - Script extender v1.7.3 by Silverlock\n<br />-[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53996]HDT physics extensions v14.28 by HydrogensaysHDT[/url]\n<br />-[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77315]Resplendent armor and greatsword v1.3 by sarcasticshark[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]INSTALLATION[/b]\n<br />MANAGER\n<br />1)extract the files included in SKSE - Script extender v1.7.3 by Silverlock in your Skyrim folder if you don't already have it installed\n<br />2)install [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53996]HDT physics extensions v14.28 by HydrogensaysHDT[/url] with MO or NMM if you don't already have it installed\n<br />3)install [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77315]Resplendent armor and greatsword v1.3 by sarcasticshark[/url] with MO or NMM if you don't already have it installed\n<br />4)install this mod with MO or NMM and make sure to overwrite everything when prompted\n<br />MANUAL\n<br />1)extract the files included in SKSE - Script extender v1.7.3 by Silverlock in your Skyrim folder if you don't already have it installed\n<br />2)extract the files included in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53996]HDT physics extensions v14.28 by HydrogensaysHDT[/url] in your Skyrim&#92;Data folder if you don't already have it installed\n<br />3)extract the files included in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77315]Resplendent armor and greatsword v1.3 by sarcasticshark[/url] in your Skyrim&#92;Data folder if you don't already have it installed\n<br />4)extract the files included in this mod in your Skyrim&#92;Data folder and make sure to overwrite everything when prompted\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMPATIBILITY[/b]\n<br />This mod should be compatible with any other mod really...\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]CHANGELOG[/b]\n<br />v1.1\n<br />-improved the details and reduced the color vibrance of the cloth and the HDT skirt by remaking the diffuses and the normals\n<br />v1.0\n<br />-initial release\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]CREDITS[/b]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4920724]sarcasticshark[/url] for making the resplendent armour\n<br />Humus for his cubemap base\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1734939]billyro[/url] for his cubemap convertion tutorial\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2959649]newermind43[/url] for making the boots and gauntlets that were used in the original resplendent armour and that I modified\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3694709]JayMercer[/url] for making the helmet that was used in the original resplendent armour and that I modified\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/720137]singlebelong[/url] for making the HDT skirt that was used in the original resplendent armour and that I modified very sightly\n<br />Czano (myself, hehe) for making this mod\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]PERMISSIONS[/b]\n<br />Ask me for permission before re-utilizing the assets contained in this mod in any other mods\n<br />This mod is a Nexus exclusive only and you are not allowed to publish it on any other platforms\n<br />This is a free mod, it shall not be sold under any circumstances",
