  "summary": "Several types of meat can be cooked in Skyrim, but no steak. As a steak lover, I felt I had to change this! My first mod.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I decided I was tired of eating plain old cooked beef in Skyrim. I wanted steak! So, since a good steak is something you really enjoy, this new food item is a little different than normal. No salt pile needed. But you do need a Leek, Lavender, and Garlic plus Raw Beef. Perfectly seasoned and grilled, the steak does a quick 100 to Health, Stamina, and Magicka. And since steak is filling, it adds a regen bonus for each of them for one hour. My first mod, made so I can carry around just one food item I really like and make it easy to use in the midst of battle. Everything was done in CK, mainly wanted to see if I understood it well enough to make a consumable, a recipe, and effects.\n<br />\n<br />I hope you enjoy your steak.",
