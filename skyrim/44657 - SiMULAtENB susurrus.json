  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i44.tinypic.com/2rc23ux.png[/img]\r\n[size=1](This is my first mod/mod-like-thing/upload on this site, so constructive criticism is welcome!)[/size][/center]\r\n[font=georgia][size=5][i]what is it?[/i][/font][/size]\r\n[size=2][b]SiMULAtENB: susurrus[/b] is a SweetFX module-and-preset combo (it comes with all the necessary shaders and dlls!) created to mimic an ENB, for use on computers that -- for whatever reason -- don\\'t support an [i]actual[/i] ENB. It features soft pastelified* colors with an emphasis on reds, browns, and purples, giving everything a warm, dreamlike feel.[/size]\r\n\r\n[font=georgia][size=5][i]how do i use it?[/i][/font][/size]\r\nI\\'ve included a set of instructions for tweaking the injector settings in each of the .zip files; to install the package, simply copy the contents of the .zip into your [b]\\'Skyrim\\'[/b] (NOT your \\'Data\\') folder and go!\r\n\r\n[font=georgia][size=5][i]why did make it?[/i][/font][/size]\r\nBecause my computer is a butthead that crashes every time I try to use one.\r\n\r\n[font=georgia][size=5][i]compatibility & requirements[/i][/font][/size]\r\n[color=green]?[/color] YES! This [b]IS[/b] compatible with Climates of Tamriel, Enhanced Lights and FX, and any other weather/lighting mod you can imagine. In fact, I highly recommend them!\r\n[color=green]?[/color] YES! This module works on BOTH x32 and x64 operating systems! (I\\'m not sure about x86 though. Anyone want to offer a report?)\r\n[color=green]?[/color] YES! This preset IS compatible with any other game that supports SweetFX. (I can\\'t guarantee it\\'ll look all that good, though.)\r\n[color=red]?[/color] NO! You do NOT need to install SweetFX or the Configurator separately; they\\'re included! (I have, however, added a \\'SweetFX_Settings.txt\\' download if you have the newest version of the injector already installed and just want the preset.)\r\n[color=red]?[/color] NO! This is NOT compatible with any SweetFX .dll other than the MOST RECENT, because those .dlls do not support Gaussian or Film Grain effects.\r\n\r\n[font=georgia][size=5][i]other[/i][/font][/size]\r\n[i]Can I post this [s]Elsweyr[/s] elsewhere?[/i]\r\nSure, but link back to me please! c:\r\n\r\n[i]It doesn\\'t work![/i] \r\nI\\'m sorry! Make sure you copied the files into the [b]Skyrim[/b] folder, NOT the [b]Data[/b] folder. If everything is where it\\'s supposed to be, either your machine is way too old (in which case, how did you even get Skyrim to run at all on it?), or it\\'s an 86-bit or DX11 machine, which work [i]sometimes[/i] but are technically not supported.\r\n\r\n[i]I found a bug/inconsistency/incompatibility/your work sucks![/i]\r\nOkay! Tell me what you found and I\\'ll set about fixing it. (Except maybe that last one; your aesthetic preferences are beyond my control.)\r\n\r\n[i]Can I upload screenshots?[/i]\r\nI will make you so many sweetrolls if you upload screenshots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Yes, I\\'m aware that\\'s not an actual word.
