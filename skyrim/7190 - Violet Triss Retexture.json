  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Violet Triss Retexture[/b]\r\nby Cicattrix\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nIntro:\r\n\r\nTriss outfit fits better into my idea of fantasy, so, thanks to Fraper and Psyke, I use it a lot into my Skyrim.\r\nWell, while my sneaky archer and his companion enjoy the DeepBlack and BlackRed retextures made by Psyke, it happen that my new rogue assassin would be a purple lover. I have hopped that Psyke will give us some purple one day, but he was busy with some super-project of his and I havent dared to disturb him. Also, there is IcePenguin retexture, but thats pinky and too girlie for my taste and my assassin girl will be everything but not cute and nice. So, after a month I have lost my patience and I have started playing into PS (note that am just an amateur at it) and, to my surprise, I have got some results that turned to be acceptable.\r\nFrom this fooling around to the idea to share them it wasnt a too long way, although I didnt had this in my mind when I worked on them. So, take them as they are, and put a bit of salt on it. If you like it, enjoy it. If not, dont get too serious, is just an amateur work, made for fun and for the sake of experimenting. Dont judge me as hard as you will do with pros like Fraper and Psyke...  :p\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nFiles:\r\n\r\nThere are 3 color variants each with its own ”codename”, that will replace the ugly Glass armor set:\r\nINDIGO - a darker version, with the original [i]shine[/i] effect that you have seen on Psyke first releases.\r\nVIOLET - a more bright version, with the original [i]shine[/i] effect that you have seen on Psyke first releases.\r\nPURPLE - same as Violet, just that it uses the later version of Psyke _n.dds, so, it has no [i]shine[/i].\r\n\r\nThere are also available two hoods, using the monk model:\r\nIndigo - to match the Indigo outfit.\r\nViolet - to match the Violet and Purple outfits.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/2vimlvo.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nQ&A:\r\n\r\n1. Know from the start that this is a REPLACER FOR GLASS ARMOR.\r\n2. Dont worry, this mod will not replace any Triss color you already have, as it creates and uses its own folder called Violet into Raven folder.\r\n3. The hoods are packed separately, to not force you to use them if you dont want. They will replace Glass helmet and will also go into Violet folder.\r\n4. I suppose it is obvious that you can only use one color variant at once. The same goes for the hoods.\r\n5. ”Just color replacer?” I dont know, I feel like doing a sacrilege to Fraper and Psyke work. But if there will be enough requests I will oblige.\r\n6. ”Replacing an ”easier to get” armor?” Wouldnt be too easy to get it? And then, wouldnt be that armor too weak later? But DB set is another one that I think it deserve a replacement and that can be taken pretty fast in game.\r\n7. ”Standalone?” Hold your horses, I still havent unzipped SkyEdit yet. And there are already two excellently ones done by Fraper and Psyke. But, well, I may get some crazy idea and an interesting story one day...\r\n8. ”Why this shine/no-shine variants?” Just for fun, I am still unsure which I like more, so I switch them daily...\r\n9. ”Whats Indigo? Or Violet?”... check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_violet#Additional_variations If you dot have patience to read, just scroll at the end and look at the Shades of violet.\r\n10. ”Meh, your colors are ugly, exaggerated, striking or whatever...” Havent I told you already that I am an amateur and that I have no artist eyes like Fraper and Psyke?\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nThis is packed to be NMM friendly. If you wanna install it manually, unzip and copy the folders (Meshes and Textures) into your Skyrim/Data.\r\nIf you want get rid of it, just do the opposite or let NMM do it for you... :p\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nThanks/Credits:\r\n\r\nBethesda, for this impressive game called TESV Skyrim.\r\nCDProject RED, for \\\"The Witcher 2\\\" and its assets.\r\nFraper, for whatever wonder he did to gift us with this awesome outfit. --->http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5135\r\nPsyke, for his excellent retextures. ---> http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4708\r\nFraper and Psyke again, for allowing me to share with you this ”plaything” that I did with their files.\r\nNexus Team, because they have created a great family here.\r\nAll the other modders for spreading the share spirit and being an inspiration and making our game experience better.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal:\r\n\r\nAll models in this pack are copyrighted, and belong to their original authors and copyright holders.
