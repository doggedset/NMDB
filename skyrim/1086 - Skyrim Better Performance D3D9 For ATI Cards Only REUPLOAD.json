I WILL UPLOAD THE NVIDIA ONE AS SOON AS I FIND IT.\r\n\r\nI do not fully understand what this does \\'under the hood\\' as I am only re-uploading this file. Basically when you drop this file into the skyrim installation folder it can give you up to a 20fps boost.\r\n\r\nJust drag and drop the file into the skyrim installation directory for it to work. \r\n\r\nDo not slay me as I am not the original creator of this file. I take no credit what so ever. ",
