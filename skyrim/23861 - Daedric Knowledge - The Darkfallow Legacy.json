  "summary": "This mod is currently only a book, but I have plans to make an epic quest line involving most of the Daedric Artifacts, which I feel have too small a part in Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The long-term aim of this mod is to provide a better lore reason for seeking the Daedric Artifacts. While right now all I have done is added a book, I eventually want to add a quest that encompasses several of the Daedric Artifacts, and tells you much about the back story of them. However, I am currently quite new to the Creation Kit, so for now I am focusing on the books and journals. If anyone good at modding or scripting would like to help, simply contact me through either a comment, or a direct message.\r\n\r\nNotes on Alpha.01\r\n-At the moment I am still writing the Journal, and will be focusing on that. However, the Book of Daedric Knowledge has the Ebony Mail information in it, and is currently located at the same place as the Journal.\r\n-Both books located in Braidwood Inn, the tavern in Kynesgrove, a town south of Windhelm.",
