  "summary": "Clothing retexture of Sheogorath\\'s suit, made to look like a butler\\'s uniform.  Available at Radiant Raiment in Solitude.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A mod that adds a butler uniform retexture based on Sheogarath\\'s outfit. The outfit comes in a non-enchanted, and enchanted(+speechcraft) version, both of which are sold by Radiant Raiment in Solitude. \r\n\r\nI created this mod for those who wanted a butler uniform that could be given to a follower, or used by fellow Mod creators. In case anyone did want to suit up and make an impression when back in town, I added a couple of versions to the Radiant Raiment store in Solitude.\r\n\r\nI initially created this after hearing about how another mod-maker was looking for a butler outfit. So I decided to whip up a quick retexture and this is what I came up with. If anyone does want to use the resources from this mod in their own mods, please just include a note back to this mod. Thanks and happy modding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n-Unfortunately only available for male characters, as Sheogorath\\'s outfit only has a male 3D model.\r\n-Hands and forearms in 1st person view are low quality when equipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
