  "summary": "Adds a unique piece of Stormcloak Officer Armor.",
  "descriptionHtml": "===Lore===\r\n\r\nAfter the attack on Helgen many bodies will never be recovered, eaten, burned to ash to lost in the rubble of the city. One of Ulfric Stormcloak\\'s personal guard stayed behind to cover his retreat, but was snatched up by Alduin and thrown clear of the village. His badly burned and broken body landed in the river just west of Riverwood where the rapid current dragged him further down river.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing one of Ulfric\\'s personal guard he wore a unique set of Officer Armor. This mod places his corpse somewhere in the river between the Guardian Stones and the waterfall east of Riverwood. Keep an eye out as you walk down the path and you may see him.\r\nI\\'ve tried to keep the armor rating level friendly and now comes with the ability to upgrade at Smithing Table, same items needed as Banded Iron Armor and normal Iron armor to upgrade.\r\n\r\nModels are for male and female (still default ingame meshings)\r\n\r\nI recommend using it alongside Stormcloak Officer Armor Retex by Sasha the Creep\\'s mod. Makes the armor look much better and more, bear like. Will not cause any conflicts at all.\r\nFound here : http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8787\r\n\r\n===Technical Mumbojumbo===\r\n\r\nI\\'ve add it to the upgrade list. The armor rating borders between Banded Iron and Steel Plate armor. \r\n\r\nHoping to soon create a unique texture/mesh pack to go with this to give it a proper unique feel.\r\n\r\n===History===\r\n1.1b - Fixed Cuirass weight to reflect heavy armor instead of light\r\n1.0b - Added to upgrade list, removed enchanted version to allow early game upgrading\r\n1.0 - Initial Release Enchanted and unenchanted versions\r\n\r\n",
