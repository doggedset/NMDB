  "summary": "Tired of having male hands as a female character while wearing scaled armor? Not anymore!",
  "descriptionHtml": "So... I discovered a glitch. A very small one but a very ugly and immersion breaking one at that. So in the vanilla game, if you wear scaled bracers as a female, you\\'re hands get all fat and chubby and ugly and gross. This bothered me a lot, and for the few people who have noticed this bug, it will bother them too. So, I made this mod just for you, people who are bothered by this glitch! :D Rejoice! But anyways... Relish in the fact that you no longer have to have chubby hands while wearing scaled armor. If this mod causes any problems, or does not work, tell me, and I\\'ll see what I can do.",
