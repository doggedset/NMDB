  "descriptionHtml": "Behold&#33; The land of Skyrim, where only the bravest of warriors could possibly face 2 foot tall giants and live to tell the tale&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Misleading Enemies scales down the sizes of most &#34;boss characters&#34; or otherwise frightening enemies, to make them a bit less intimidating. Lets be real, who doesn&#39;t really run away in fear from hulking dwarven centurions? As much as we all enjoy posing as the mighty and fearless Dragonborn, we all wet ourselves from time to time, so I dedicate this mod to those of us who just need a little encouragement in battle.\r<br />\r<br />**WARNING: enemies are no less difficult, so you&#39;ll likely be fooled into entering a battle that you couldn&#39;t possibly win. But don&#39;t read this, because the whole point of this mod is to convince you that you actually CAN win, so GO YOU&#33;**\r<br />\r<br />List of Shrinkery:\r<br />-Dwarven Centurions\r<br />-Giants\r<br />-Sabrecats\r<br />-Bears\r<br />-Mammoths\r<br />-Dragon Priests\r<br />-Giant Frostbite Spiders\r<br />-Dragons\r<br />-Atronachs\r<br />-Hagravens\r<br />-Trolls\r<br />-Mudcrabs\r<br />-Nazeem, just because.\r<br />",
