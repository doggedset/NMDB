She was considered a runt, scavenger and pest by all the locals. They teased her and called her little crow. They compared her to this animal since she was a street rat scavenging for food all the time. Also it was to ridicule the hook shape nose on her face. Since she couldn\\'t be the prettiest she was determined to grow strong. Though they still call her little crow she isn\\'t so little anymore. She serves the village of Falkreath and the newly appointed thane. Now people only look on her with the utmost respect.\r\n\r\nSefonis - Housecarl of Winterhold\r\nBio - Sefonis came to Winterhold as a young girl. When first arriving she was awed by the city and was immediately drawn to the magical lights of the college. Though trained to be a warrior she quickly found herself spending time with the wizards and learned a spell or two. She was happy to see that the new Thane happens to be the new Archmage as well. She hopes that the Dragonborn will be able to help rebuild her city to it\\'s former glory.\r\n\r\nRanya - Housecarl of Dawnstar\r\nBio - Always a pessimist no matter the situation. Her sarcasm and dark outlook often keep others away from her company. It was no little surprise that the Jarl assigned Ranya to the new Thane in order to get rid of her. Little do they know how useful Ranya really is. People who make enemies with her employers often have accidents involving fire.\r\n\r\nJahnrik - Housecarl of Morthal\r\nBio - Trained to be a guard since childhood. He is loyal to Morthal and it\\'s people. Recently he has been seen studying with the local wizard. This has angered many of the villagers despite the fact that they have always liked Jahnrik. They believe the wizard and his magic means nothing but trouble to them.To quiet the townsfolk the Jarl has assigned Jahnrik to protect the newly appointed Thane.\r\n\r\nRecommended mods but not required.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27815]Fine Face Textures by urshi[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26145]Smooth male Body Normal Maps[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25211]Female Face Tattoo by TairenSoul[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25791]Male Face Tattoo by TairenSoul[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722]Eyes Of Beauty[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3574]Gizmodian Scars[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12933]Exstensible Follower Framework[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6953]Better FaceGen[/url]\r\n\r\n**** Instructions for neck seam/tear bug ****\r\n1.
