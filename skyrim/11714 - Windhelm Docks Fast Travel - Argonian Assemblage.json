  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a fast travel point to Windhelm Docks, right outside the Argonian Assemblage.\r\n\r\nI got tired of having to fast travel to windhelm gate and zone 2-3 times or otherwise having to run around the city and swimming through the icy water while struggling to climb out at the dock to get to my home after marrying Shahvee and moving in with the other Argonians.  \r\n\r\n[edit] Some people say they are having issues with this with DLC.  I have purchased all DLC and tested it and it works fine for me.  Try moving it further down in your load order.  Keep in mind this point is not automatic, you need to discover it first: the point is right in front of the Argonian Assemblage door.  \r\n\r\nThanks! :)",
