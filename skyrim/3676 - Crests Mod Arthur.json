  "descriptionHtml": "Family Crest Arthur:\r\n\r\nThis was a request from DarkestNinja to put his Coat of arms onto the Ebony Armor, and because the Crest looked so \\'Knightly\\' that i decided to change the Ebony Armor into a more knightly steel color with red and yellow cloth to match the coat of arms.\r\n\r\ntake a look at the screenshots and download if you like, unfortunately this is currently only a Male Version as it took quite a while, and i didnt want to do the female version straight after the male version... it will be available some point soon when this becomes a 1.1 version.\r\n\r\ndownload if you like it, endorse if you REALLY like it, comment with your feedback if you dont.\r\n\r\nas always my textures are available to use yourselves provided you ask permission beforehand and give me credit in any release, and of course send me a link so i can basque in the fact that my texture is involved...ahem. and of course, open to requests :)\r\n\r\nCallaghan04",
