  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=red]New [u]Version 1.4[/u] is up, see Changelog for details[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]DESCRIPTION:[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />The goal of this mod is to add some more life to the Lakeview Manor Exterior.\r<br />\r<br />This Mod adds a Dragon, which guards your estate and will attack your enemies.\r<br />There are also four main guards (Dayshift and Nightshift) which will guard you estate.\r<br />A Personal Guard called &#34;Selfur&#34; will guard your interior and can be recruited as follower.\r<br />To have a better view, some trees were deactivated\r<br />\r<br />To make it easier to build your home, there is also a merchant near the stables, where you can buy (most) of the needed\r<br />materials to build your home. If you don&#39;t have any money left, don&#39;t worry, there are some hidden &#34;Money sources&#34; which should help you out.\r<br />\r<br />There are also additional NPCs in the Inn between Pinewatch and your Manor, some of them can be used as follower.\r<br />\r<br />You can find more Details about the characters at [url=http://lvm.free-clan.org]lvm.free-clan.org[/url].\r<br />\r<br />NEW since version 1.4: an installer was added, which let you decide to install optional files:\r<br />\r<br />[b]Optional Files are:[/b]\r<br />[b]Bandits:[/b] They spawn after every cell reset (31 gamedays, without you entering the cell), this extra is meant to add some action to your manor.\r<br />[b]Goldshower:[/b] After every cell reset, it will be raining coin purses. You have to find them on your plot of land.\r<br />\r<br />All necessary files are included in version 1.4 and can be selected during installation.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]UPDATE/UPGRADE FROM v1.3 AND LOWER TO v1.4:[/b][/u]\r<br />[b][color=red]REMOVE THE OLD VERSION(S) OF THIS MOD BEFORE YOU INSTALL THE NEW VERSION&#33;[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]INSTALLATION:[/b][/u]\r<br />[b][color=orange]RECOMMENDED:[/color][/b]\r<br />1. Download and Install with Nexus Mod Manager - and select additional files (if you want to).\r<br />\r<br />[b]MANUAL INSTALLATION:[/b]\r<br />[b]NOT Recommended[/b]\r<br />1.

(Optional) move the content of the other folders into your Skyrim-Data directory (if you want to use them)\r<br />5. check the load order, First: FCOLVMLight.esp, Second: FCOLVMThiefs.esp, Third: FCOLVMGoldshower\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]A PERSONAL NOTE:[/b][/u]\r<br />Thanks for your Feedback&#33; - Suggestions and Feedback are ALWAYS Welcome&#33;\r<br />I have many ideas for this mod, many ideas to add in the future. There were also many great suggestions from you. \r<br />There is much more stuff I would love to add (I have a personal giant 2do list), but unfortunatley I am a noob when it comes to scripting, quests, conditions etc.\r<br />What I want to say is: Some suggestions and feedback from you require knowledge that I currently don&#39;t have.\r<br />So don&#39;t be angry, if I &#34;reject&#34; a suggestion, it&#39;s not your fault, it&#39;s mine. ;)\r<br />(Of course I will continue to learn new stuff, but that will take some time, and I&#39;d rather do stuff which I already know or is easy to learn, before I mess up the whole mod with something more complex like scripting)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]FAQs:[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q:[/b] Are there any special Requirements for this mod?\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Yes, you need the DLC &#34;Hearthfire&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q:[/b] I don&#39;t have the house built yet, has it any influence?\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Not really, the NPC&#39;s etc. are there and are already guarding your plot ;)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q:[/b] I can&#39;t buy Lumber from the Merchant\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Lumber still needs to be bought from your steward, or a sawmill near you.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q:[/b] The dragon sometimes has weird animations or gets stuck\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Since I haven&#39;t changed any animations at all, this is not a bug within the mod, but a general bug with the game.\r<br />But don&#39;t worry, if the dragon stucks, he usually respawns either when you leave/re-enter the place, or when new enemies spawn.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q:[/b] The Dragon Guard disappears\r<br />[b]A: [/b]That isn&#39;t a mod issue at all, it seems that dragon NPC&#39;s vanish sometimes.\r<br />Since 1.3 I&#39;ve edited the AI Package, to avoid that, but I can&#39;t guarantee that it will help.\r<br />However, there are some workarounds which can help:\r<br />\r<br />[u]WA#1:[/u] Leave the area (do some quests for some days), he might come back again\r<br />\r<br />[u]WA#2:[/u] open the console (be sure to be outside of your house&#33;), type [i]help &#34;dragon guard&#34;[/i], to get the Dragon&#39;s ID, type [i]player.placeatme &lt;ID&gt; 1[/i] - this will place &#34;a copy&#34; of the same dragon to your house\r<br />\r<br />[u]WA#3:[/u] disable the mod, open the game, SAVE the game, enable the mod again, load the previous saved SAVEfile\r<br />\r<br />These are some ways to get the dragon back, however, there is no guarantee that the dragon will stay.\r<br />There is nothing else I can do, it seems dragons are not meant to be used as a pet. :(\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q: [/b]I bought everything the merchant had, when is the next shipment?\r<br />[b]A:[/b] It&#39;s the same delay as for vanilla merchants: about 24-48 hours later, you can buy again.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q:[/b] Is it possible to ride the dragon?\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Yes, but you need the DLC &#34;Dragonborn&#34; enabled, and you have to finish the mission where you ride the dragon the first time.\r<br />After the mentioned mission you learn the shout &#34;Bend, Will&#34;, use this shout on the dragon guard.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q: [/b]Will you make this mod also available for the other manors in &#34;Hearthfire&#34;\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Probably, but there are currently no plans for that, only time will tell.\r<br />\r<br />[b]More Informations are available at [url=http://lvm.free-clan.org]lvm.free-clan.org[/url][/b].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]CHANGELOG:[/b][/u]\r<br />Changelog can be found in the Readme, or on Skyrim Nexus",
