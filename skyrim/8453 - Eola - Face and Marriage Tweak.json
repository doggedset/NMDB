  "modId": 8453.0,
  "modName": "Eola - Face and Marriage Tweak",
  "summary": "I can\\'t speak for many, but I fell victim to Eola\\'s seductive charm near instantaneously. It was love at first sight. Needless to say, I was severely disappointed when I found out that I couldn\\'t do much with her past the quest.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod, so I am very uncertain if this will work for anyone else. Please go easy on me if it doesn\\'t, and leave a comment; I\\'ll try to fix it. ;_;\r\n\r\nThings this mod is supposed to do:\r\n-Subtly change facegen data to be more attractive.\r\n-Add a Marriage faction.\r\n-Make Eola essential.\r\n\r\nThings this mod is not supposed to do:\r\n-Fail at one or all of the above things.\r\n-Crash your game.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n1. Really?\r\n2. Just extract to your \\\\Data\\\\ folder if it wasn\\'t obvious enough.\r\nIf you somehow don\\'t like/want the new facegen data, feel free to only use the esp.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n\r\nv0.3 - setrelationshiprank no longer required. Disposition now takes care of this. Thank you GoodfellowGoodspring!\r\n\r\nv0.2 - Completion of \\\"The Taste Of Flesh\\\" will now make Eola enable the marriage dialogue option. If you\\'ve already completed this quest, open console and do a \\\"setrelationshiprank player 4\\\" on her.",
