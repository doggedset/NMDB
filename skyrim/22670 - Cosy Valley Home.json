  "summary": "Adds a small and cosy shack to a hand-made and highly detailed valley landscape.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a player-home mod which adds a tiny wooden shack inside a custom-made and highly detailed valley world-space. \r\n\r\nAs with all my house-mods: The project objectives for this mod were:\r\na) Not be in Riverwood like 492,389,843 other player-house mods. \r\nb) Be small and basic to provide essential services and storage for characters of all levels.\r\nc) Be visually appealing and provide a cosy \\\"at-home\\\" feeling.\r\n\r\nHOME ENTRANCE IS LOCATED \\\"BEHIND\\\" FALKREATH. CHECK YOUR MAP FOR \\\"UNKNOWN CAVE\\\" IN THE VICINITY!\r\nNotes:\r\n- Enchanting and Alchemy tables with storage bags.\r\n- Single weapon  rack coming very soon.\r\n- Chests, drawers and shelves. Shelves currently do not function as bookshelves, but expect this to be fixed in the next (first) patch depending on feedback.\r\n- THERE IS NO NAVMESH. This will be added later down the line once I learn how to set one up.\r\n\r\nAnd that\\'s it. The point of this mod is to stay simple and clean. Nothing extravagant here. \r\n\r\nComments and criticisms are welcomed, and please check back regularly for updates! Any updates that affect containers will be made manual-download only and will come with a warning so you don\\'t have to worry about your gear going missing before you can relocate it.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This mod was largely designed to be used with the \\\"Skyrim Bigger Trees\\\" mod by xweto. While it is not required to use this mod, the valley will feel much less populated without it. It\\'ll allow more greenery on screen without hitting your framerate like adding more trees would.\r\n\r\nCheck it out here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17168\r\n\r\nHistory:\r\n\r\n1.0:\r\n-Release\r\n1.1:\r\n-Added a working bookshelf to the shack.\r\n-Added a working weapon rack to the cellar. Please note that the enchanting bag was moved and you should remove your items before updating to this version!\r\n",
