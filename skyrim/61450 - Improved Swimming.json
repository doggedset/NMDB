  "summary": "Improvements to the swimming implementation to try and improve immersion. Equipment and inventory items will now effect player speed and stamina drain while swimming in relation to carrying capacity.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u][size=4]OVERVIEW[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />While trying to make Skyrim a immersive experience using Frostfall and other similar survival mods I was rather frustrated by the way swimming seems to just be a afterthought when considering in game actions. Sure Frostfall added stamina penalties for jumping into freezing water but nothing stopped you from jumping into water in full plate armor carrying every item you&#39;ve tripped over along your journey. In warmer areas large lakes provided nothing but a minor time investment to swim across to the other shore while carrying it all.\r<br />\r<br />After trying out BetterSwimming and Duke Patrick&#39;s Armor Drowns to fix this I felt a little more inspired to make something similar but with a few more features and a MCM menu to allow users to tailor it to their play style.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=4]DISCLAIMER\r<br />[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />I&#39;ve only been writing mods for 4 days now so there&#39;s quite possibly some issues to be found so please report anything you find and I&#39;ll try to take care of it. Hopefully I&#39;ll find any as I&#39;m playing with this installed myself. Also new feature requests are quite welcome.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=4]FEATURES[/size]\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />- Speed and/or Stamina damage while swimming based on the current total weight of items in your inventory vs. your carrying capacity. Optionally you can chose to use your base actor value for carrying capacity so that the carrying capacity added by backpacks and pouches doesn&#39;t lessen the penalties. You are still having to carry all that weight after all.\r<br />\r<br />- Base speed and/or Stamina damage in addition to the variable portion based on items. Even swimming nude would take stamina so the base values are always applied regardless of items. If you don&#39;t want this then just set the value to 0.\r<br />\r<br />- Argonians don&#39;t have the base speed damage applied but only the variable amount to differentiate them as better swimmers than other races.\r<br />\r<br />- Waterbreathing spells and abilities stop health damage after stamina is depleted.\r<br />\r<br />- Stamina regen disabled while swimming.\r<br />\r<br />- Health damage after stamina is depleted while swimming.\r<br />\r<br />- Increasing camera shake when health is below 50%. Effect starts small and increases as health nears 0%.\r<br />\r<br />- Drowning sound with increasing volume when health is below 25%. Effect start small and increases as health nears 0%.\r<br />\r<br />- Optional adjusted weight for equipped armor items. The percent of weight used for equipped items is configurable for heavy, light, and misc armor based off keywords assigned to the items.\r<br />\r<br />- Status tab to report all current values the mod has calculated and is currently applying to the player.\r<br />\r<br />- Almost all options and values are configurable through the MCM.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=4]PLANNED FEATURES\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/u][/b]- Player sinking on no stamina to make staying on the surface more of a struggle than just not angling your camera down.\r<br />\r<br />- Better sounds for drowning based on if player is above or below the surface.\r<br />\r<br />- Disallow equipment changes while swimming but still allow player to drop currently unequipped items. If you want them back strip down after you get to shore and dive back in to get them.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=4]KNOWN ISSUES\r<br />[/size][/b][/u]\r<br />- Changing options while swimming could result in stuck damage to speed or stamina. I tried to make the mod first repair any damage that was currently applied prior to applying the new value in all cases but there&#39;s always the possibility something was missed. I haven&#39;t found a case where this is caused by this mod yet.\r<br />\r<br />- Damage being recalculated repeatedly even when user hasn&#39;t picked up or equipped a new item. I found some mods like to quickly add and remove a item to the player for some reason. Since this mod uses the OnItemAdd/Remove and OnEquip/Unequip events those can trigger this. Enabling debugging should show the item name being added and removed so I can try and work around this if you see it. Currently the mod just ignores events like this if the items are &lt;= 0.001 weight. Seems to work.... I&#39;m looking at you Fork of Damnation.\r<br />\r<br />- Carry capacity detection can sometimes be off if it&#39;s changed after the mod is initialized. This is fixed as soon as you change your inventory or add and item but currently the fix for this which seems to work is the initial recalculation of values happens 5s after game load which seems to fix it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=4]NOTES\r<br />[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />- Other mods may apply damage to your stamina regen or speed based on the amount of stamina the player currently has. Those will stack on top of what this mod already does so you may see harsher penalties as your stamina depletes. As for me... I like this. But if you don&#39;t you should be able to tweak the options to fix this for your play style.",
