  "descriptionHtml": "[b][center][color=#93c47d][size=5][img]http://i57.tinypic.com/2emq792.png[/img][/size][/color][/center][size=3][color=#b6d7a8]What is it? [/color]\r<br />[/size][/b]A small wooden cabin in the forests with everything from farmland and bookshelves to crafting tools and weapon racks. There&#39;s even a small note-driven quest that takes you into a cave I created in search of the house&#39;s previous owner for the key. I spent roughly 5 good full days working on this, so I hope it&#39;s pretty good.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8][size=3]How do I get it?[/size][/color]\r<br />[/b]Simple, read the note that was left on the porch of the house. It will tell you everything you need to know.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][color=#b6d7a8]Where is it?[/color]\r<br />[/b][/size]It&#39;s located off of a small path leading up to Ivarstead from the NW. I made an effort to assure the house was not in the mainstream Riverwood forests, yet still surrounded by beautiful evergreen forestry. Finding the house shouldn&#39;t be too difficult, but if you&#39;re having trouble, go to Ivarstead and head NW while looking for the house-shaped icon on your compass. Also, in response to multiple reports of the cabin still being too hard to find, I&#39;ve added a picture of the in-game map with the Forester&#39;s cabin included, so you may reference the image to help you find it if you so desire.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8][size=3]I think there&#39;s something wrong with it...[/size][/color]\r<br />[/b]There very well may be bugs with this. I am an amateur modder at best, so bear with me. Some bugs I am already aware of are:\r<br />[list][*][s]Light flickering in and around the house.[/s] (I think I fixed it in 1.1&#33;&#33;&#33; Please report any light flickering in the future)[/*]\r<br />[*][s]Possible pathing issues with AI in and around the house and cave.[/s] (I think I fixed it in 1.2&#33;&#33;&#33; Please report any pathing issues in the future)[/*]\r<br />[*][s][object] seems to be floating and/or out of place.[/s] (I fixed all known instances in version 1.2&#33;&#33;&#33; Please report any object issues in the future)[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Please report any bugs here on the Nexus website. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m capable of fixing any minor issues that come up. Any good amount of bugfixes I make will be released in a new hotfix update. As of Hotfix 1.2, there are no known bugs on my end.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][color=#b6d7a8]Compatibility[/color][/b]\r<br />[/size]It&#39;s just a player home mod. It should be compatible with anything and everything that doesn&#39;t change the remote mountainside cells I placed the house and cave on. I recommend the use of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045/?]My Home is Your Home[/url] by Volek, as this will allow you to assign any follower you acquire to any house you come along, even modded ones such as mine.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8][size=3]It seems like a mediocre mod, why make it?[/size][/color]\r<br />[/b]I know, it&#39;s nothing too special. I just really wanted to create a cool player home mod that my friends and I could enjoy. If you would like it as well, then feel free to download it. If you&#39;re looking for professional work, look elsewhere.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][color=#b6d7a8]I think this mod is...[/color]\r<br />[/b][/size]You&#39;re more than welcomed to leave your opinions and suggestions in a post here. I&#39;m really excited to hear what the general public thinks of my first mod ever. Less than a week ago, I had no idea how to use the creation kit, and now thanks to YouTube and Google, I have this mod&#33; So any feedback is greatly appreciated.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b6d7a8][size=3][b]Hey, this is actually pretty cool...[/b]\r<br />[/size][/color]If you&#39;ve tried my mod and enjoyed it, the best way of showing that appreciation is to simply hit that &#34;endorse&#34; button on the top of this page. As a beginner with no prior publicity or reputation, every comment and endorsement brings me that much closer to being recognized as a decent mod developer. Likewise, if you didn&#39;t enjoy it or feel it just isn&#39;t worthy of recognition, feel free to leave a suggestion or comment post here to help me get better, or simply move on and find a more professional mod. Remember, any and all feedback is appreciated.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#cc4125]*Updating to v1.2 hotfix[/color]\r<br />[color=#dd7e6b]This hotfix was rolled out to fix the flickering lights in and around the Forester&#39;s Cabin, as well as fix major object misplacements and correct pathing glitches. If the issues persist, please report it here. It is safe to update without any additional actions, as I did not alter any items such as the weapon racks or chests. Your currently stored items should be just fine, but you may want to back your save up just to play it safe.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#6fa8dc]*A huge thanks to everyone who downloaded and enjoyed the mod. I&#39;m thrilled to say we hit 100 unique downloads on day one&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#b6d7a8][size=3]Video Overview by Nozi87\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[youtube]hiTpGJqx8vs[/youtube][/center][/b]",
