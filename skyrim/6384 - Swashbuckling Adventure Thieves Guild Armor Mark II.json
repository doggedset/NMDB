  "descriptionHtml": "5/11/12  - Added a standalone version of this armor modded by Asharo, which doesn\\'t replace the Thieves Guild Leader armor! Thanks Asharo!! :)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a thief who raids many tombs, I have a need for the extra carrying capacity afforded by the Guild Leader armor, but really hated the dull dark brown aesthete of it. Yes, I know thieves aren\\'t supposed to attract attention, but I like to think of my thief as something of an adventurer type, so I decided to retexture the armor. I\\'ve brightened up the leather to a more Indiana Jones style tattered light brown, gave him a swashbuckling silk-threaded red shirt, restitched a lot of the armor bits, pockets, and padding, and added a variety of runic symbols and shiny bits and bobs befitting a rogue adventurer type. \r\n\r\nI\\'d previously uploaded a similar outfit a couple of days back, but it was a bit rougher than this version. I meant to update it, but I ended up deleting a file by accident, so I just started all over again, with new screenshots and the like. Consider this version 2.0!\r\n\r\nThis is my first stab at retexturing ANYTHING ever. Also, I\\'m well aware that \\\"realism\\\" would dictate my thief run around dressed in black rather than this more attention getting outfit. Realism would also dictate that me firing arrows into an enemy guards head would result in more than just a \\\"Huh? I must be hearing things.\\\" \r\n\r\nHopefully some of you folks will find this file useful. I\\'ve only a male version as I made this for my own entertainment and my character is, obviously, male! \r\n\r\nLike This?
