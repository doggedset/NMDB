  "summary": "Patch that adds a simple and immersive way to give Animated Dragon Wings to yourself or your followers by way of enchanting an item for them to equip.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is a patch for Anton0028&#39;s Animated Dragon Wings. It comes from my desire to have my followers (specifically my scale-brother Derkeethus) have dragon wings like I do.Â I know there is already a way to enchant a ring with the magic effect via console, but I wanted something a little more immersive and permanent. I created this patch which allows the player to make a set of rings with an enchantment version of Anton&#39;s wings spell effect. There is 1 ring for each of the different effects and they are used simply by equipping/unequippng the rings. This also works on followers and the effect can be dis-enchanted and put on any other piece of armor/jewelry. Furthermore, if the wings ever disappear off of a follower, you can simple take and give back the object to get the wings to reappear.\r<br />\r<br />----Requirements----\r<br />Anton0028&#39;s Animated Dragon Wings found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53271/?]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />----Installation----\r<br />Simply copy the DragonWingRings.esp to your Data directory and enable it in your favorite Mod Manager (I use WryeBash);\r<br />\r<br />----Load Order----\r<br />Make sure this mod is loaded AFTER Animated Dragon Wings.\r<br />\r<br />----Uninstall----\r<br />This *Should* uninstall cleanly by simply deleting the esp.
