  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k48/dubird/devart/skoomadealertitle_zpsd17699eb.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nI\\'ve downloaded a good skooma overhaul mod, but got frustrated at not being able to find it in game.  I thought there should be some dealers, so I made some.  I have a couple more towns to add to, and then I\\'ll work on the Skooma Den.  It should not conflict with anything that I know of, but if it does, let me know and I\\'ll see what I can do.  \r\n\r\nVersion 0.2\r\nAdded dealers to Windhelm, Whiterun, and camped outside Dawnstar.  The ones in Windhelm and Whiterun are indoors.  I\\'ve been playing with the AI packages to try and give them more to do than stand in one place, but I\\'ve yet to get them to change cells properly.  Going to read up on that again and see what I\\'m missing.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.1: First try\r\nDealers in Markarth, Riften and Solitude.  The one in Riften has more types of skooma available, because I figured that would be closer to the source.\r\n\r\nFuture plans:\r\n1. Add dealers to each major town.\r\n2. Add a skooma den (maybe more?)\r\n3. Add a skooma distillary, so you can buy from the source.\r\n4. If I ever get the hang of making quests, a quest to either be a dealer yourself, or wipe out the distillary for a bounty.",
