  "descriptionHtml": "What&#39;s going on guys?  This is my second mod, and as per request, it improves the long bow.\r<br />\r<br />It increases the speed to 1.5 (from 1.0) and increases the damage to 24 (from 6).  \r<br />\r<br />The improved bow&#39;s name is Marksman&#39;s Bow.  It can be bought in the Solitude Fletcher.\r<br />\r<br />This mod should be compatible with all mods.\r<br />\r<br />Possible glitch: Sometimes the Marksman&#39;s bow won&#39;t show the correct item necessary to temper it in the tempering menu.  To fix it just leave the grindstone, then come back.\r<br />\r<br />Also on the Steam Workshop at http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=252335342\r<br />\r<br />I would really appreciate suggestions, critiques, etc. Also if it doesnâ€™t work with a mod, please let me know. \r<br />\r<br />If you like this mod, please, leave a like. It helps get this mod noticed. \r<br />\r<br />Thumbnail and screenshots taken and edited by me.",
