  "descriptionHtml": "NO DLC REQUIRED&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Sollek is pure warrior;\r<br />\r<br />Archery, light weapons, heavy weapons and block are his biggest strengths\r<br />\r<br />Sneak, light armor and heavy armor are his lesser attributes\r<br />\r<br />Combat style is very high offense.\r<br />\r<br />Perks: Critical Shot, Savage Strike, Devastating Blow, Elemental Protection, Deadly Bash, Silence, Unhindered, Conditioning.\r<br />__________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />He is fairly powerful, but balanced. I play with many difficulty mods so this build is reflective of that; he is neither a pushover nor is he an unstoppable god of war.\r<br />\r<br />Set as essential, can be turned off in the console command if you wish.\r<br />\r<br />Max level = 81\r<br />\r<br />He is found eating, drinking, or cooking in The Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />__________________________________________________\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />\r<br />Simply drag the contents of this folder into your Skyrim Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />&#39;Course, you probably already knew that :)\r<br />\r<br />__________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Thanks, and treat him well&#33; \r<br />or Shout him off the Throat of the World, that works too.
