  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=#d5caa5][heading]Better Dwemer Spider Textures[/heading][/color][/b]\r<br /> \r<br />Get your Dwemer Spiders ready for their closeups with these brilliant and astounding new textures, built from the ground up from top-quality Dwarven Ingots and entirely too many Photoshop layers. Guaranteed to improve spider productivity by up to 42 percent&#33; *\r<br />\r<br />The vanilla Dwemer Spider texture is surprisingly scruffy, but it has served its purpose fairly well. In part, I think that&#39;s due to the spiders generally being found in dimly-lit locations.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s a clip kindly shared by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4051376/]Brodual[/url] with lots of before-and-after comparisons:\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]UeX9a-ccizk[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />I have added a few new details in areas that seemed to be needlessly plain, and the gemstone has been changed to more closely resemble a Soul Gem. The Dwemer animunculi seem to always use those as components. There&#39;s a few less-than-wonderful parts of the model that I didn&#39;t address as they would require reworking the mesh and its UV map. \r<br />\r<br />The textures are available in three resolutions, choose the one that suits your system&#39;s capabilities and your mechanical spider-quality needs:\r<br />2048-pixel pack: 25Mb \r<br />4096-pixel pack: 34Mb\r<br />4096-pixel uncompressed: 213Mb\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#d5caa5][heading]Installation[/heading][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Use the mod manager of your choice, or simply drop the data folder and its contents into your Skyrim main directory, choosing &#39;replace&#39; if neccesary. \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#d5caa5][heading]Credits[/heading][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />CGtextures.com for some of the metal and patina layers. \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#d5caa5][heading]Permissions[/heading][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />You are free to alter and redistribute these textures in any way you see fit. Please credit me for my work in any re-use of them.\r<br />\r<br />* Results may vary. Harmful if swallowed. Product will be hot after heating. May contain small parts.",
