  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSome things about Skyrim annoyed me... the Ancient Nord Armor was one of them. You went through all of these companions quests, did all these things for them and what was your reward? A variant of iron armor. Most people have graduated to steel or dwarven at this point so its useless. This changes that. The stats have been changed to something in between Ebony and Orcish, but you still need to complete the companions quests to be able to craft it and it still requires Daedric smithing to double the anount you can temper it. It\\'s a quick and simple buff, but I hope you all enjoy it.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPut the esp in your data folder and go.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBethesda, for making skyrim and its amzing creation kit.",
