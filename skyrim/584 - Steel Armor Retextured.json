  "descriptionHtml": "Just did some minor adjustments to the steel armor set. The vanilla version looks washed out and like some plastic trash that is screwed together.\r\n\r\nI changed the colors to be more like the color of worn steel, and removed a bunch of the screws. What are they screwed into, anyway? Screwing metal to leather and fur isn\\'t very practical.\r\n\r\nInstallation: Copy \\'Data\\' folder into your Skyrim directory",
