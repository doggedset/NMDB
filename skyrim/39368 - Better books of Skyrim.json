  "modName": "Better books of Skyrim",
  "summary": "This mod adds a series of new books to Skyrim. The books will range from fairy-tale to factual and purely fictitious propoganda.\r\nPlease note that this mod is still in early beta, and as such, is not complete. We aim to release between 200-1000 new books for Skyrim before Christmas.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I always felt there was room for a little more literature in Skyrim.\r\nThis mod aims to add a minimum of 200 new books to Skyrim, but we hope to get at least a thousand out before the end of the year. We will update this mod regularly, so keep checking back! I very much doubt this will be a mod that can ever be considered complete, since more people will submit work, constantly.\r\n\r\nWe aim to be lore-friendly and accurate, but we do also want to retain the feel of the original elder-scrolls books by allowing for a little bit of author bias (i.e, the validity of Talos as a God).\r\n\r\nThe books will be released under the following categories\r\n\r\n=========== FAIRY TALES =========== \r\nKiddies books and the like\r\n\r\n=========== PROPOGANDA =========== \r\n+ Stormcloak\r\n+ Imperial\r\n+ Various cults and orders of Skyrim\r\n\r\n=========== HISTORICAL =========== \r\nThis will cover lore and all things lore-based.\r\nCURRENT TITLES:\r\n\r\nThe Dwarf Myth\r\n\r\n=========== SCIENTIFIC =========== \r\n- Sub categories of:\r\n+ Neurology\r\n+ Racial Phylogeny\r\n+ Astronomy\r\n+ Engineering\r\n+ Mathematics\r\n+ Physics\r\n+ Biology\r\n+ Economics\r\n+ Geography\r\n+ Magic\r\n++ Alchemy\r\n++ All the respective fields of magic.\r\n\r\n=========== CRAFTS =========== \r\nThis will tie in with the science, and will be in-depth coverage of the skills behind craftworks (such as the methods of creating Daedric armour, and what makes Daedric armour so efficient).\r\n\r\n=========== RELIGIOUS =========== \r\n\r\nAll the books detailing cults and commands of the cults shall be published here.\r\n\r\nWe are also considering adding an erotic stories add-on (perhaps with some fancy watercolours or etchings), if there is any interest in this idea. Which we feel there almost certainly will-be. \r\n\r\nWe will be looking for translators, as we hope to reach the widest audience.\r\n\r\nWe are also looking for authors! Submit your work! We will review every single entry. \r\n\r\nPM me the content, and, if it passes the quality test, I will publish it the very next day.\r\n\r\nFOR THOSE WHO SUBMIT HIGH-QUALITY WORK, WE WILL BACKLINK YOUR PROFILES ON THIS PAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRENT AUTHORS:\r\nZak\r\nNordJitsu - http://tamrielfoundry.com/members/nordjitsu/ ",
