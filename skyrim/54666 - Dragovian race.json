  "summary": "DISCLAIMER: Slightly overpowered. This race, thought to be extinct, is one of the toughest races to kill.",
  "descriptionHtml": "EDIT: Thanks to all those who endorsed and to those who downloaded.\r<br />\r<br />The Dragovian race was almost destroyed in a battle with a great evil, however, a small band of warriors escaped the destruction that overtook the rest of their species. After years of the ship they escaped on was declared lost, a great hero found and awakened from their cryogenic sleep. \r<br />This race is just a modified Breton race, they are for the UNP body and have 500 hp and 100 in One Handed, 2 handed and magical arts. (You should probably Legendary the skills at 100, to get all the perks.) . Anyway, these mods I release will all make sense once my stories hit the net\r<br />\r<br />EDIT: Thanks to all who help me improve with suggestions in the comments.\r<br />\r<br />(Note to self: Finish story)",
