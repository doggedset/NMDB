  "descriptionHtml": "This is the Final message update I am leaving on here. If you have any issues with the mod or compatibility leave a comment I will try to help you. Im trying to gauge which mods are incompatible with this mod right now, its been 2 years since Ive worked on it and honestly I probably wont update this mod unless it needs it due to it being to my exact liking. I appreciate ALL of the support from the members who have downloaded and contributed to improving my mod :) \r<br />\r<br />I will be updating the compatible list when I get more information from users as I dont play skyrim anymore. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Non-Compatible Mods: \r<br />\r<br />*IN PROGRESS* \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/images/1991954-1355717026.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />New vid by Hodilton&#33;\r<br />[youtube]IvdfWhPseak[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Hoping to get this user some publicity, Heres his video :)\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]AENoc1atoWs[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Another Video by JohnnySQS (this one is in spanish, so its for spanish users)\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]8vK4boaB0TM[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Little Review by user sorafe :)\r<br />\r<br />&#34;I hardly ever leave comments but, I love this mod. This is the first grass mod I&#39;ve installed that affects my gameplay... sneaking through the grass never felt so rewarding.\r<br />\r<br />Really, that&#39;s the whole beauty of this mod to me, you just wanna disappear into a field or a large patch of grass off the side of the road and violently murder passers-by, dragging their corpses into the flowers and weeds so that they completely disappear.\r<br />\r<br />I used this on top of the Lush Grass mod and I haven&#39;t run into any weirdness or problems so far. \r<br />\r<br />Anyway, awesome mod. More than just a graphical enhancement, it&#39;s a gameplay improvement&#33;&#34;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />ENB USED IN PHOTO&#39;s\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28489\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />LITE VERSION OUT&#33;\r<br />\r<br />All Privelages are allowed, Include in any mod or anything; Make sure you give me Credit please\r<br />\r<br />Dense Grass by- Chewiemuse\r<br />\r<br />I only recommend using this mod if you have a high end PC or dont care about the Risk of loosing about 10-20 FPS\r<br />\r<br />To fix the Distance it renders you need to go into your SkyrimPrefs.ini (MAKE SURE YOU BACK UP) and change fGrassMaxStartFadeDistance= to 14000.0000, this will render the grass as far is it can in a Stable fashion.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Very simple to install\r<br />\r<br />Install Instructions:\r<br />\r<br />Either just upload through the Nexus mod client\r<br />\r<br />Or Move Dense Grass ESP to your Skyrim/Data Directory\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Anyone can edit this mod or use it in their compilation, I dont mind you dont need to ask.\r<br />\r<br />If you guys like Endorse :D",
