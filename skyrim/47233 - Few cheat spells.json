  "descriptionHtml": "Adds 4 spells to your character:\r\nToggleable invisibility\r\nToggleable stop time\r\nToggleable night eye\r\nDetect life for 5 seconds\r\n\r\nHighly recommend to use with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36328/?]Grimy Utilities[/url] so you can assign hot keys to these abilities without having to change spells or cast manually.\r\n\r\nFew notes about spells:\r\n\r\nInvisibility spell must be toggled on / off by casting the spell again. If you somehow lose the invisibility effect it will automatically recast so you can steal, hit, kill and do what you want without having to worry about losing invisibility. There is a small delay about 0.25 second when you lose the effect until it is reapplied but enemies shouldn't be able to detect you in that time.\r\n\r\nStop time effect must be toggled on / off by casting spell again as well. It isn't complete stop time but it slows time to 1% of what it normally is so you can easily outrun arrows or spells.\r\n\r\nNight eye effect must be toggled as well. I use [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8090/?]this mod[/url] to get rid of the blur effect on night vision as I don't like it.\r\n\r\nDetect life isn't toggled, it just casts detect life for 5 seconds. I didn't like to have it on all the time because I found it annoying. Vanilla detect life doesn't show undead, daedra or dwemer machines but this version shows all.\r\n\r\nThe spells are added to your character automatically. That's all, if you would like some more cool spells post your idea and I might make it if I have time. :)\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.1:\r\nFixed invisibility not reapplying sometimes.\r\nAlso changed how stop time looks.",
