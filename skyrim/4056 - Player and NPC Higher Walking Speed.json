  "descriptionHtml": "You (and also the NPCs) now walk 25% faster and run/sprint 5% faster too!\r\n\r\nI was tired of seeing my character walking WAY too slow for humanoid standards. I mean, I am a soldier capable of taking down a dragon by himself. I can keep a 24h constant run of around 10km/h without being tired. So WHY THE HELL CAN I ONLY WALK AT 3KM/H?\r\n\r\nThis mod is for people like you. Now your character will look like he\\'s walking, not dragging.\r\n\r\njust drop the file in your Skyrim\\\\Data folder and activate it in the \\\"Data Files\\\" in the game\\'s launcher.",
