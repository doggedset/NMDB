  "modName": "Enderal Sun Temple Quarters - Player&#39;s room and Order Armor",
  "summary": "Mod adds a small player&#39;s room to the Sun Temple Quarters.\r<br />Room is free to use after you&#39;ll gain access inside the Sun Temple (main quest).\r<br />All containers are safe and all items in the room belong to you including a full set of Order&#39;s heavy armour.\r<br />The room is last on your left as you enter the Quarters.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Even after you were sworn into the Order you didn&#39;t have place to stay on the temple grounds. Now you have&#33;\r<br />If you wanted a full set of Order&#39;s heavy armour but was disappointed by a blacksmith - this mod is for you&#33;\r<br />There is also a very convenient fountain with holy water to cure your diseases if you ran out of potions and can&#39;t find a priest in the middle of the night.\r<br />\r<br />I also fixed the Order&#39;s helmet (_00E_Order_Warden_HelmetAA) for elven-based races. \r<br />With this mod all our pretty elven ears are safely tucked under the helmet.\r<br />\r<br />Two cells names also were fixed for English version: Sun Temple Quarters and Sun Temple Bath.\r<br />If Enderal team or any other mod will fix all this stuff in the future, then any mod loaded after mine will override these changes, so no worries.\r<br />\r<br />You will find a full set of Order&#39;s heavy armour in a chest in your room.\r<br />All new items have new IDs, appropriate keywords and tempering recipes.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Order Armour - Heavy - steel plate:[/b]\r<br />Order Cuirass\r<br />Order Boots\r<br />Order Gauntlets\r<br />Order Helmet\r<br />Order Shield\r<br />\r<br />Order Cape - Clothing\r<br />Order Cape - Clothing - Enchanted (+30 resistance to all elements F/F/L)\r<br />Order Backpack - Clothing - Enchanted (+200 Carry weight)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Order Weapon - steel:[/b]\r<br />Order Swords (2)\r<br />Order Great Swords (2)\r<br />\r<br />Set of Order&#39;s heavy armour from the chest is worth upgrading but it will not give you any additional bonuses. \r<br />For that you will need Enderal original complete set of armour.\r<br />\r<br />No Enderal&#39;s IDs or navmeshes were harmed in the process of making this mod.\r<br />\r<br />There are two files in download section. They are identical and both up to date. \r<br />The only difference is that the optional file offers Enderal&#39;s vanilla system of handling enchanted and tempered items - tempering after enchantment is not allowed.\r<br />Main file offers Skyrim&#39;s system - you can enchant and temper afterwards as many times as your Handcrafting level allows.\r<br />You can upgrade from version 1.0 to 1.1 any time simply by replacing the ESP file.\r<br />\r<br />If you would like to be able to temper Enderal&#39;s vanilla items after enchantment - check out [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77364/]fix by Ratrace[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements[/b]\r<br />============ \r<br />Skyrim\r<br />Enderal\r<br />Enderal Launcher\r<br />\r<br />[b]Install[/b]\r<br />=======\r<br />Mod is safe to install mid-game. Load order doesn&#39;t matter.\r<br />\r<br />1. Drop all files from the archive into your Skyrim&#92;Data folder.\r<br />2. Start Enderal Launcher and check the SunTemple Quarters.esp file.\r<br />Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Uninstall[/b]\r<br />=========\r<br />Why would you? This small mod is very useful and will not affect your gameplay in any way.\r<br />Just put all unwanted items from the mod into the chest in the room, close the door and forget about it.\r<br />\r<br />This mod uses 1 vanilla Skyrim script (templeblessingscript) for the fountain to work.\r<br />Uninstallation of scripted mods is not recommended for Skyrim in general but if you insist:\r<br />\r<br />1. Remove all your personal items from containers in player&#39;s room in the Sun Temple Quarters.\r<br />2. Leave the cell (go outside). Save (do not Quick save). Exit the game. \r<br />3. Uncheck SunTemple Quarters.esp in Enderal launcher. Exit the launcher.\r<br />4. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.\r<br />5. Check if the line ClearInvalidRegistrations=1 present under [General] in your SKSE folder. (It should be there by default with Enderal) \r<br />6. Load your last save. Make a new save (do not Quick save) in a new slot. Play.\r<br />7. Do not complain that uninstalling this mod mid-game broke your saves. (Very unlikely but you’ve been warned&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Incompatibility[/b]\r<br />==============\r<br />None.\r<br />Any mod that alters the same space in the Sun Temple Quarters will conflict.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Known Issues or Bugs[/b]\r<br />====================\r<br />Player&#39;s room wasn&#39;t navmeshed on purpose. I decided not to mess with original navmeshes.\r<br />Absence of navmeshes in the player&#39;s room only means that you will have more privacy there. No one is going to wander in.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits[/b]\r<br />=======\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim\r<br />Thanks to Sure AI for Enderal\r<br />Thanks to modders for resources for Enderal and Skyrim\r<br />Thanks to TESNexus for the one-stop-shop resource for authors and players\r<br />Thanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator\r<br />\r<br />======================================================================\r<br />Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my native language, feel free to correct me.",
