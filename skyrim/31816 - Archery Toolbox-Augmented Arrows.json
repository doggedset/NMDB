  "modName": "Archery Toolbox-Augmented Arrows",
  "summary": "*Updated* Adds *16* special craftable arrows that have various offensive effects.  \r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE CHANGELOG:\r\nAdded 5 new arrow types that can be crafted.\r\nThese are taught through a new book called \\'Archer\\'s Toolbox 2\\'. A second book called \\'An Archer\\'s Obsession Vol. 2\\' that describes their effects is also added\r\n\r\nArrows added:\r\nSilver Arrow- deals damage to undead, werewolves, and ghosts for 3 seconds\r\n\r\nFrenzy arrow- explosion frenzies an area for 10 seconds\r\n\r\nAmplifier- deals massive damage to enemies below 50% health\r\n\r\nSapping Poison- deals poison damage and weakens one handed and 2 handed damage by 50% for 8 seconds\r\n\r\nDragon Torment- Forces dragons to land and prevents them from flying for 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nI also added a book called \\'Summon Ancestral Archer\\' that allows you to conjure a spirit archer as a greater power.  This archer is your ancestor and is the author of the books that teach you these arrows.  It comes equipped with barbed, sapping poison, and disarm augmented arrows, and a bow that drains stamina.\r\n\r\nThe new books are found on the floor of the tent inside Graywinter Watch, which is West of Whiterun.\r\n\r\nAdditional changelog:\r\n*increased amount of some of the arrows that are crafted from 5 to 10\r\n*increased Armor Piercing trigger chance from 50 to 75%\r\n*increaed AoE of earthquake arrow\r\n*modified name of arrows so they should be compatible with any CFM\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAdds 2 books that teach you to craft legendary augmented arrows at a forge that apply different effects on contact.  Book names are \\'An Archer\\'s Obsession\\', and \\'Archer\\'s Toolbox\\'.\r\n\r\nArrows included:\r\nBarbed Arrow-   does bleeding damage over time\r\n\r\nArmor Piercing-  chance to ignore armor\r\n\r\nFire Bomb-  delayed explosion that ignites and makes people run in fear\r\n\r\nIce Prison-  delayed explosion that freezes things in place\r\n\r\nSilence-  prevents casters from casting spells for a short time\r\n\r\nSmoke Bomb-  blinds in an area and slows movement speed\r\n\r\nDragon Poison-  damage over time poison to dragons\r\n\r\nDisarming Arrow-  disarms enemies if they are performing an attack\r\n\r\nRaise Dead-  raises a corpse to fight for you for a short time\r\n\r\nShort Circuit-  temporarily disables dwarven automatons\r\n\r\nEarthquake-  knocks down everything near where it strikes (including you)\r\n\r\nI personally enjoy playing skyrim as an archer/ranger type character.  I even found that when I did mage or warrior-type playthroughs that I would end up using archery in fights anyways.  I still like the magic system in Skyrim, but it is somewhat lost on me since I cannot commit to a pure mage.  I wanted to add elements of spells to archery besides the bland enchanting effects.  I also found it strange that enchantments were applied to bows, when it is in fact the arrows that damage the target and apply the effect.  The recipes to create these arrows will require fairly rare and unique ingredients. I did that because I love to go around and explore skyrim and collect as many things as I found, but I would very rarely find use for the rare items and would usually end up just selling them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod makes it so you will be cycling between different arrows in your quiver to fit the different fights.   Each one of these arrows specializes in a combat style or against certain types of enemies, so you will never be unprepared with your bow.  I aimed to make it so these are not overpowered, but still have great utility when used correctly.  Feel free to endorse if you enjoy this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere to find:\r\nInside Clearspring Tarn on the table where you find the Bow of the Hunt, you will see the 2 books next to it (see in images).  After you read the books you will be able to craft the arrows at any forge.  *Also, the books contain a bit of my own lore that gives the creation of these arrows a little history*\r\n\r\nInstallation: NMM or drag the .esp into your Data folder\r\nVersion 1.10 is the current file, it contains all 16 arrows\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is the first draft of the mod.  As far as I know this should be compatible with any other mod.\r\nI intend to expand on this in the future, any comments/questions/suggestions are welcomed\r\n\r\n",
