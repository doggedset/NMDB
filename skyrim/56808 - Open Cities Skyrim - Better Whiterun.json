However, most of city&#39;s open areas, completely lack any grass. This comes in contradiction with the ambudance of grass seen immediately outside the city&#39;s walls, and or, other cities of Skyrim. My mod comes to correct this.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][heading]MOD DETAILS[/heading][/u]\r<br />The mod does nothing more than just some subtle additions of hand-placed grass to the city of Whiterun, which greatly improves the city&#39;s immersion, without any noticeable hits to the performance (FPS). The mod is 100% compatibility with all the Open Cities Skyrim-compatible mods out there&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u]What my mod does:[/u][list][*] Makes the city of Whiterun have some more grass, like all the other hold capital cities of Skyrim. A lore-friendly mod that does not alter the natural tundra landscape of Whiterun.[*] Whiterun&#39;s landscape is now more lively and no longer barren.[*] The shrubs and grass are placed carefully, without breaking any immersion.[*] Is a clean mod.

[*]...contains no errors&#33;[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[u][u]\r<br />\r<br />[heading]MOD REQUIREMENTS[/heading][/u][/u]\r<br />This mod requires the [b][color=#00FF00][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8058/?]Open Cities Skyrim[/url][/color][/b] by Arthmoor to be installed. Although it can be used without the OCS, you won&#39;t see any improvements in the vanilla&#39;s games city of Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][u][heading]INSTALL[/heading][/u][/u]\r<br />Just place the .esp to the Skyrim/Data Folder and activate it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][u][heading]UNINSTALL[/heading][/u][/u]\r<br />Just deactivate/remove the .esp from the Skyrim/Data Folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][heading]LOAD ORDER[/heading][/u]\r<br />This is a Load Order Neutral Mod.
