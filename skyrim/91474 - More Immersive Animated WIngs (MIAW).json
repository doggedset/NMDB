  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][b][u][center]More Immersive Animated Wings (MIAW)[/center][/u][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Anton's Animated Dragon Wings [/size][size=5]is[/size][size=5] easily one of my favourite mods. To me, it is a necessary mod and makes my Argonians look far more like the Dragonborn I imagine. [/size][size=5]However, in my years of using it, there is one thing that always bothered me: [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/BjvZUWC.jpg[/img]﻿\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]So I decided to fix it. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]With MIAW, when you enter the 1st person, your wings will retract. When you go back to the 3rd person they will poof back out. No visual obstacles, no need to faff. Enjoy![/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]I use MIAW with Joy of Perspective, it should work with other camera mods. If you find any bugs then please report them in the bug forum. This mod [i]should[/i] work with anything. [/size]\n<br />[center]\n<br />[b][u][size=5]The How To[/size][/u][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]To use, just go to 3rd person, get your wings out and then get on with whatever it is you do in Skyrim. [/size]\n<br />[size=5]\n<br />If you install on a save that has multiple mutagens, I strongly advise getting and equipping the \"Ring of Dodo\" ASAP, without changing your camera state. It wouldn't be game breaking if you did, but there's a good chance that every wing you had a mutagen for would start responding to your camera state. The ring should be available to purchase at radiant raiment in solitude, but using console is much faster. Equipping the Ring of Dodo should be performed whenever you choose to change wings. After the ring is equipped, \"reset\" the wings you want by casting once or twice to get the new wings in 3rd person. Easy.\n<br />[/size][size=5]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17440][center]SE VERSION HERE[/center][/url][/size]\n<br />[size=5]\n<br />[b][u][center]Recommended Mods[/center][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64303]FNIS Flyer[/url] by fore\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][center]Credits[/center]\n<br />[/u][/b]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53271]Animated Dragon Wings[/url] by Anton[/size]\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6][i]\n<br />[font=Georgia]If you like my mods then please support them.
