It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han. It was briefly interrupted by the Xin Dynasty (9–23 CE) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han into two periods: the Western Han (206 BCE – 9 CE) and Eastern Han (25–220 CE). Spanning over four centuries, the period of the Han Dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history.[3] To this day, China&#39;s majority ethnic group refers to itself as the &#34;Han people&#34; and Chinese characters are referred to as &#34;Han characters&#34;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\r<br />\r<br />This is one of the swords fought with during this time, known as a Jian or &#34;Straight Sword&#34; it is considered the &#34;Gentleman of weapons&#34; out of the four main Chinese weapons, Jian, Dao, Gun, Qiang.\r<br />\r<br />****This sword maybe used and retextured, just please give credit due with the mesh*****\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*************************************The Miao Dao*****************\r<br />\r<br />This sword is based off of a Zheng Wu sword\r<br />http://www.zhengwusword.com/zw/miaodao.htm\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />From Wikipedia.com\r<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Miao Dao is a Chinese two-handed dao or saber of the Republican era, with a narrow blade of up to 1.2 meters or more and a long hilt. The name means &#34;sprout saber&#34;, presumably referring to a likeness between the weapon and a newly sprouted plant. While the miao dao is a recent weapon, the name has come to be applied to a variety of earlier Chinese long sabers, such as the zhanmadao and changdao. Along with the dadao, miao dao were used by some Chinese troops during the Second Sino-Japanese War.&lt;&lt;&lt;\r<br />\r<br />The Dao is considered the &#34;General of weapons&#34; out of the four main Chinese weapons, Jian, Dao, Gun, Qiang.\r<br />\r<br />****This sword maybe used and retextured, just please give credit due with the mesh*****\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*************************************Yanmaodao*****************\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />From Wikipedia.com\r<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Yanmaodao is a type of dao used as a standard military weapon during the Ming Dynasty and middle Qing Dynasty (1368–1800). The blade is straight until the curve begins around the center of percussion along the last 1/4 or so of the blade approaching the tip. The center of percussion is the point on the blade with the least vibration on hard contact, the spot on the blade that transmits the most power to the target in a hard chop. This allows for thrusting attacks and overall handling similar to that of the jian, while still preserving much of the dao&#39;s strengths in cutting and slashing.This type of sword seems to have lost its popularity with military and martial arts practitioners alike by the end of the 18th century.\r<br />\r<br />Yanmaodao almost invariably have straight grips, although downward-curved handles are depicted in Ming artwork. During the last century of Qing rule, curved grips became far more prevalent than straight.&lt;&lt;&lt;\r<br />\r<br />The Dao is considered the &#34;General of weapons&#34; out of the four main Chinese weapons, Jian, Dao, Gun, Qiang.\r<br />\r<br />****This sword maybe used and retextured, just please give credit due with the mesh*****\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;\r<br />BlazeLeeDragon\r<br />blazeleedragon@hotmail.com",
