  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#FFff00][size=\\\\\\\"8\\\\\\\"]UPDATE!!!! Working on finishing Drakespire Archmages Guild, then will fix the faction issue which causes fights to break out between followers and guards with this mod. Additional upgrades to match the Tower in Drakespire Archmages Guild will be added to make this a player home for an archmage character without the quest and NPC\\'s that come with Drakespire Archmages Guild. Stay Tuned...  :D[/size] [/color]\r\nRequires Skyrim Latest version[/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/38/drakespirekeepsunriseco.jpg/][IMG]http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/7534/drakespirekeepsunriseco.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][color=#FFff00][size=\\\\\\\"8\\\\\\\"]Drakespire Archmages Keep[/size] [/color]\r\nRequires Skyrim Latest version[/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n====================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#ADD8E6]Location\r\n========[/color]\r\nDrakespire itself is located south-east of Windhelm in the mountains above Kynesgrove. You can not access it though until you become Archmage of Winterhold.\r\n\r\n[color=#ADD8E6]Details\r\n=======[/color]\r\nDrakespire Archmages Keep is my answer to the dinky digs given to us by Winterhold College after completing the College Quest Line. Yes I was very let down by our rewarded living quarters after we saved the world.   \r\n\r\nThe Drakespire area itself comes with your own private Quarters, which has a shower and a bath. Your own private Trophy room with mannequins, and weapons cases. Your own private Carfting room and garden, with both Alchemy and Enchanting tables, an Armory with a Target Range, a Magical Emporium for all your arcane needs, a Dinning Hall with your own Chef and Bard (with Ale on Ice), A Concubine Chamber for those players sporting multiple wife mods, and of course, your own private balcony with a teleporter system to all the major holds.\r\n\r\n[center][URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/62/concubineschamber02.jpg/][IMG]http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/7539/concubineschamber02.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/center]\r\n\r\nDrakespire Keep comes with over 65 Mannequins, 40 weapons racks and a dozen weapon display cases. You\\'ll have plenty of space for all your followers and there equipment in one easy to use location. Your Keep also comes with an express lift to get you strait to your private quarters after a long day of slaying dragons.\r\n\r\nDrakespire Keep comes with 6 Elite Guards (Ebony Armor provided in thier barracks on the mannquins) that can all be used as followers and can be married. You also have access to a Blacksmith, Alchemist, Spell and Cook Merchant. Your Spell Merchant also doubles as a trainer in Conjuration at Master Level!\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"#ADD8E6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]So why make this Mod?\r\n===============[/color]\r\n\r\nThis mod is based off my other Mod \\\"Drakespire Mages Guild\\\". Drakespire Mages Guild is a very large Mod that comes with multiple quest, factions, numerous npc\\'s and a larger version of Drakespire Keep. Drakespire Mages Guild was my first Mod, and while in the process of updating it for the next version soon to be released, I thought I would take the time to create this seperate mod for players whom just want the player home without the quest, factions and numerous NPC\\'s, or whom just don\\'t have the rigs capable of pulling such a large Mod like Drakespire Mages Guild off. \r\n\r\nFYI -- I\\'m naming this files ShayksBAQ (Short for Shayks Better Archmage Quarters) to make it esier for those who may download both to recognize which file to delete. \r\n\r\n[center][URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/801/dinninghall.jpg/][IMG]http://img801.imageshack.us/img801/6990/dinninghall.jpg[/IMG][/URL][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#ADD8E6]History and Changes\r\n=======[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFff00]1.2 -- Fixed RANDOM ENCOUNTERS at home... really this time. Was not Location type doing it, was actually default package ck bug causing this, so I removed all default packages from NPC and gave them custom ones.\r\n    -- Equiped Armor on all Elite Guards.\r\n    -- Gave Guards more to do so they are not standing idle so much, Dinner Packages and Relaxing Packages. If they are not sleeping or at thier guard position, then you will find them in either the dinning hall of the Concubines Chamber.\r\n    -- Adjusted Navmesh to improve NPC movement thru-out the central tower.[/color]\r\n\r\n1.1 -- Fixed random encounters at home. (Was fun while it lasted)\r\n    -- Moved Dinning room fountain controls to the side of planter.(Looked to tacky on the front)\r\n    -- Replaced Bards stage to prevent navmesh bugging out and not letting bard walk up to top.\r\n    -- Added more clutter to Concubines Chamber.\r\n    -- Added weapons to Guards Weapons Racks.\r\n    -- Added more Greenery in Dinning, Concubines Chamber and Tower.\r\n    -- Added Sigil Stone (Hidden in Tower) for use with Target Summoner.\r\n    -- Fixed Elite Guard, now there are three for both day and night shift.\r\n    -- Locked all portals on Balcony, they now require same key as entrance doors.\r\n    -- Adjusted lighting within the Concubines chamber.\r\n    -- Fine Tuned Room Bounds to improve performance.\r\n\r\n1.0 -- Initial Release\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#ADD8E6][Required Files][/color]\r\nLatest version of Skyrim\r\n\r\n[color=#ADD8E6][Installation][/color]\r\nJust use NMM to install, or:\r\n\r\n1. Extract the files to a temporary location.\r\n2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.\r\n3. Copy files to (Skyrim install folder)\\\\\\\\Data\\\\\\\\\r\n\r\n[color=#ADD8E6][Uninstallation][/color]\r\nJust use NMM or remove the files manually.\r\n\r\n[color=#ADD8E6][Upgrading to New version][/color]\r\n[color=#CD0000][b][size=\\\\\\\"7\\\\\\\"]The same as with every other player home mod. Make sure to do the following so you don\\'t get upset if you loose something.\r\n\r\n1. Release any Elite Guard Followers.\r\n2. Remove All Items you want to keep from Drakespire Keep.\r\n3. Exit Drakespire Keep.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the above steps, then and only then, should you install the new version.\r\n\r\nFor moving a lot of items I recommend Ring of Boost Carry Weight found here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8520[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#ADD8E6]Known Issues or Bugs\r\n====================[/color]\r\n\r\nNone that I know of yet...... just let me know if you find any.  \r\n\r\n \r\n[color=#ADD8E6]Incompatibility\r\n===============[/color]\r\n\r\nThis will be incompatible with anything that uses exterior cell 38, 4 in the mountains just up the slope from the hunters camp above Kynesgrove.\r\n\r\nThis may be incompatible with mods that alter the cells in the holds due to the portals, but I tried to keep the portals out of the way and in unused areas to prevent conflicts.\r\n\r\nThis Mod will probably also conflict with any mod that changes the Archmages Quarters in the College, as this mod alters it too a little.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it means it will conflict with Drakespire \\\"Mages Guild\\\" Mod, so don\\'t use both!\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#ADD8E6][Compatabilities][/color]\r\nHopefully everything... yea I know, I\\'m still a dreamer.\r\n\r\n[Troubleshooting/FAQ]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Tools Used]\r\nSkyrim Creation Kit\r\n\r\n[Permissions]\r\nDO NOT simply alter this mod and repackage it as your own, give me a little credit if you do.
