  "descriptionHtml": "WHAT IT DOES\r<br />\r<br />It adds 6 new blunt weapons: 3 flanged knightly maces (one of them in 2 variants), and 3 morning stars, i.e., spiked maces. (That is the correct name, yes. Historically the morning star was a spiked mace, not a flail.) I didn&#39;t port the warhammer too, because the game already has better looking warhammers. Instead of that, you get a second and better flanged mace.\r<br />\r<br />The weapons are:\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Flanged Maces:\r<br />\r<br />- Flanged Mace 1 has six sturdy, narrow, almost triangular flanges, to help concentrate the impact on a very narrow surface. Actually, they&#39;re not even as thin as they look, as they&#39;re basically pyramidal shaped and quite a bit wider at the base. They won&#39;t bend easily on impact. It&#39;s the weapon used in the middle ages to crease plate armour joints, or even knock an enemy out through plate. This one also has a nasty bladed spike at the top, for when a thrust is the right move. Finishing the package is a rough woven handle, for maximum grip.\r<br />\r<br />- Flanged Mace 2 is a German late-gothic model, showing the shape that would evolve into the sceptre as the symbol of power, although it&#39;s not the most ornate of models from this age. It has 8 flanges, a somewhat less common configuration (6-flanged models were probably most common, followed by 7 and 4 flanges), but not ahistorical. With the advances in plate armour, which by now had gone from 40 pounds of iron in the 14&#39;th century war to 60 pounds of face-hardened steel in gothic plate, by now the flanges of many maces rely less on blunt impact, and more on having accute points to drive into armour. Same principle a behind a Lucerne hammer, really. It has a polygonal metal shaft, fluted on the lower part, both fairly common features on maces from this age, and a handle wrapped in black leather strips. The top spike is rather and sturdy, but quite functional and deadly.\r<br />\r<br />- Flanged Mace 2b is the same as above, only slightly shorter and with a thicker hollow shaft, and with thicker flanges. For people who were put off by the thin shaft on the other one.\r<br />\r<br />- Flanged Mace 3 is a pernach from the Kiewan Rus&#39;, circa 11&#39;th-12&#39;th century. They&#39;re probably the ones from which the flanged mace has spread to the rest of Europe. Out of the many models of pernachs, I chose a more elegant one, resembling a sceptre fit for a voievode (warlord.) It is top heavy and has thick flanges, capable of delivering crushing blows even through the armour reinforcements of its age. For this one, its 8 flanges is probably the most common configuration for a pernach, followed by the 6-flanged variant (shestopior.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Morning Stars:\r<br />\r<br />- Morning Star 1 has six rows of five sturdy spikes each, plus a thicker spike at the top for thrusting, and a sturdy metal shaft. Nasty piece of work, really. It has the same woven leather handle as Flanged Mace 1, for maximum grip.\r<br />\r<br />- Morning Star 2 has a steel ball with about 25 spikes, including the longer top spike, as a head, and a more traditional (for a Morning Star) wooden shaft. The shaft is a little thicker than the metal ones, to resist impact. The head is socketed on the shaft. The handle is wrapped in leather.\r<br />\r<br />- Morning Star 3 is a variant of 1, really. It has fewer spikes, which is to say it&#39;s actually the more usual design for that weapon, historically. They&#39;re sturdier spikes, though, for better effect against armour. It has a wooden shaft and a leather-wrapped handle.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />All 6 weapons can be crafted and enhanced like the normal steel ones. The only difference for immersion sake is that the ones with a wooden shaft need 1 firewood for the shaft instead of 1 iron ingot.\r<br />\r<br />All do a little more base damage than the Akaviri Katana -- chosen purely as a reference point for a powerful weapon that still uses steel as a material -- but swing slower, so they end up in the same ball-park for DPS. On the other hand, if you manage to sneak up to someone and bonk them upside the head, it&#39;ll make good use of that base damage.\r<br />\r<br />Note that this is not a comment on maces vs katanas, nor European weapons vs Japanese weapons. It&#39;s chosen purely as a point which can still be justified in game as possible with only steel, and high enough to make the weapon still competitive in the end game. It won&#39;t beat an ebony or daedric weapon, but you&#39;re not excessively penalized if you stick to it for the looks.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO GET IT\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s a locked chest in Movarth&#39;s Lair, in the room with the big dining table, tucked under the stairs. It&#39;ll be an easy lock, but still, bring a lockpick or two. You&#39;ll get sent there for a quest anyway, if you don&#39;t know where Movarth&#39;s Lair is.\r<br />\r<br />Or the easier way: if you can craft steel and have the ingots, then just craft them.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO INSTALL IT\r<br />\r<br />Extract the archive, with directories, in your Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO UNINSTALL IT\r<br />\r<br />Delete the .esm file from your Data directory.\r<br />\r<br />Delete the MoraelinsMaces directories in both your MeshesWeapons and TexturesWeapons directories.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />CONFLICTS\r<br />\r<br />It shouldn&#39;t conflict with anything.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />LICENSE\r<br />\r<br />I release this in the public domain. You can do with it whatever you wish. You can give it to a character in your own mods, retexture it, change it to something else, port it to another game, and generally anything you can think of.\r<br />\r<br />If you feel like giving credit, I would of course appreciate it, but if not, so be it. I&#39;m not going to hound anyone for having a mesh that kinda looks like mine.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />VERSION HISTORY\r<br />\r<br />1.05:\r<br />\tAdded the thicker Flanged Mace 2b)\r<br />\r<br />1.04:\r<br />\tAdded the pernach (Flanged Mace 3)\r<br />\tFlagged all of them as weapon type mace instead of sword, although I think it made no difference.\r<br />\r<br />1.03b\r<br />\tMade the Flanged Mace 2 about 10% larger\r<br />\r<br />1.03\r<br />\tAdded Flanged Mace 2\r<br />\tAdded the crate in Movarth&#39;s Lair, for people who can&#39;t craft\r<br />\tReworked Mace 1 again.
