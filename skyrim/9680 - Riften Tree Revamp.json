  "descriptionHtml": "This is the first of a series of mods that will add more trees and foliage to the major towns of Skyrim. Instead of going for a foresty look like other mods have, I\\'m trying to go for a more understated look, and also something that fits in with the surroundings.\r\n\r\nRiften was a slightly challenging one to do, due to the limited soil space for trees to actually look natural in. Most of the place is brick, after all. As such, I\\'ve stuck mostly to the backways of Riften, and added a few in the courtyard of the palace.\r\n\r\nThe next town will be Whiterun, so stay tuned for that!\r\n\r\nBug reports and general constructive feedback are welcomed, so if there\\'s a problem with the mod, or you just want to tell me to add more trees/bushes/shrubs, go for it!\r\n\r\nWARNING: This mod is more often than not going to be incompatible with mods that also add trees and other things to the towns, and the trees will likely clip into eachother, so don\\'t have this mod and another of the same type for Riften loaded at the same time!",
