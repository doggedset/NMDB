  "descriptionHtml": "[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40615]Included in Relics of Hyrule[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[i]This mod is no longer supported because of its inclusion in Relics of Hyrule. \r<br />Updates are very unlikely.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Rumors tell of gauntlets forged by citizens of a long-dead tribe that lived in the desert. These gauntlets were enchanted to allow the wearer to lift incredible loads, allowing the dwindling civilization to build shelters they desperately needed. A day came when a member of the tribe discovered while building that the gauntlets allowed him to swing weapons with ease, and he stole a pair of the gauntlets to use for his own devices. When it was discovered that one of the pairs was missing, the tribe panicked and hid the remaining pair deep in their temple, lest it be stolen as well. \r<br />It is said that the tribesman who stole the gauntlets reforged them into a more powerful form. He hid them in his castle, away from his minions, to keep them from rising against him. These gauntlets are said to be cruder in appearance and have warped from bearing weights put on them by the false king. \r<br />Once the civilization died out, the magic contained within both pairs of gauntlets eroded as the valley of time between their civilization widened. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Storytime is over. \r<br />The Silver Gauntlets can be found in Ragnvald, while the Golden Gauntlets can be found in Forelhost. And yes, the Gauntlets do not look like the Gauntlets you remember from Ocarina of Time, and yes, they do look different, for the reasons explained in my lame backstory. The Golden Gauntlets are based on Dragonscale gauntlets, and are intended to look like artifacts created by an evil and powerful warlock. My reasoning for keeping the dragonscale gloves on the gauntlets is that these things once carried enormous blocks of rock. Anything but dragonscales would have ripped. \r<br />\r<br />[youtube]sIfYvPkOqvo[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />The Silver Gauntlets are Light Armor with a base rating of 12, equal to Dragonscale Gauntlets, while the Golden Gauntlets are Heavy Armor with a base armor rating of 18, equal to Daedric Gauntlets.\r<br />Both of them fortify your attack strength, as well as your attack speed and carrying capacity. \r<br />Basically, the Gauntlets make two-handed weaponry actually useful&#33; \r<br />\r<br />There is a version available that fortifies Unarmed Damage in addition to all of that.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: Bethesda didn&#39;t do a terribly great job with sleeves of armors, so the Silver Gauntlets occasionally have massive gaps behind them when worn with armors like Glass or Blades armor. It&#39;s a problem I cannot solve, unfortunately. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Oh, and here are the exact locations in case you were wondering:\r<br />[youtube]UzONcUf7N7U[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />The Majora&#39;s Mask my Khajiit is wearing:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16235",
