  "summary": "Deliberately crude Weapons and shields made from gold and found on Draugr. Equipment can be improved to Elven quality, giving the player something to do with a level 40 smithing skill",
  "descriptionHtml": "ATTENTION! The gold equipment is MEANT to be crude and awful looking, because the pieces are ancient and made from the worst possible metal to make equipment out of...except maybe mercury. The Honed Gold equipment is meant to look as it does. Pretty dang cool.\r\nPlease read the description before ripping my throat out with unsolicited and harsh criticism! Thanks!\r\n\r\nArmor coming eventually! Enjoy the weapons for now!\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn Skyrim, just as in real life, you cannot make weapons or armor out of gold. As Minecraft teaches us, gold is heavy, soft and buttery, offering little in the way of protection or offensive strength.\r\nHowever, gold is usable for ceremonial weaponry, and who but a bunch of frozen mummies wouldn\\'t be stupid enough to use ceremonial weapons in battle?\r\n\r\nThat convoluted thought process is sort of behind this mod, which adds gold weapons and a  shield, all modeled after Ebony equipment. They\\'re weaker, heavier and slower than iron weapons, making them the worst weapons in the game except for a fork and knife.\r\n\r\nBUT! If you find one on a bearded Draugr lady, you can copy it, smelt it into gold ingots or keep it until you have a level 40 Smithing skill and the Elven Smithing Perk to reforge it into a Honed Gold version, a brilliant ivory piece equal to an elven weapon or shield.\r\n\r\nGold weapons have some advantages: because of their weight, they deal double critical damage and inflict more stagger than other weapons. They are also more valuable.\r\n\r\nHoned Gold weapons are equal to Elven weapons, but with added value, extra stagger and doubled critical damage. \r\nThey are craftable from a Gold weapon with the Elven Smithing perk and a level 40 Smithing skill, or from scratch with the Advanced Armors perk.\r\nBasically, they fill in a little gap in the Smithing tree without any extra perks!\r\nThe equipment will appear in forges under Draugr or Ancient Nord.\r\n\r\nGold weapons can only be found in Draugr Crypts, and Honed Gold weapons may be as well. They\\'re not terribly rare, but not as common as other things.\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense...\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nIncluded:\r\nGold and Honed Gold\r\nArrows, Bow, Battleaxe, Dagger, Greatsword, Mace, Sword, Warhammer, Shield\r\n\r\nArmor coming soon!\r\n\r\nIn the future I may modify the cubemaps of the equipment a little, to give them a more metallic sheen.",
