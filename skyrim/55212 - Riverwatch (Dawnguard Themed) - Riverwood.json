  "descriptionHtml": "Riverwatch (Dawnguard Themed) - Riverwood\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#FBB117]A small player home with a Dawngaurd (vampire hunter) theme - designed to use with a companion mod such as UFO or similar. Hearthfire & Dawnguard DLC required.[/color][/b] \r<br />\r<br />This player house mod is made by request and is shared by the requesters permission. It is designed to a players specific desires & tastes that may not suit other players.  \r<br />\r<br />As with my other house mods I keep them small, stylish & simple without lots of clutter and displays. I just upload them here to share with people, they are not designed for general populace and to suit all tastes, but are rather set out to specific styles & wishes (simple) . If you like them then cool, please enjoy -  if not then simply don’t download \r<br />\r<br />As stated this house mod is for the Dawnguard vampire hunter and has the DG banners and some basic DG equipment within the home. There is a one bed hut for a follower/guard and a double bed for a spouse - you will need [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14037/?]UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url] or similar and also [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045/?]My Home Is Your Home[/url] mods to make the follower/spouse live there. . Of course you don’t have to use any of them and just use it as a player home for yourself.\r<br />\r<br />There is a full smithing area outside and also wood chopping block and a few chickens. The whole of the outside has ‘idle’ markers to keep your companions busy and is navmeshed inside and out.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#FBB117]FEATURES.[/color][/b] \r<br />\r<br />Outside - crafting areas for smithing/tanning/smelting with unique storage meshes.\r<br />Outside -  hut and living area for one follower/guard \r<br />Outside  - your own pet Husky/dog with DG armor. \r<br />Inside -  Kitchen and unique alchemy & enchanting area all with unique storage meshes\r<br />Inside - bedroom/office/small library, again with unique storage meshes.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#FBB117]POINTS TO CONSIDER.[/color][/b] \r<br />\r<br />This is made to a SPECIFIC request from another player - will not suit all tastes.\r<br />Not designed for players who like to display - just simple storage\r<br />Not designed for lots of followers just the one and a spouse - NO CHILDREN.\r<br />Some basic DG armor and weapons are included within the house so the player can start a new game with some basic gear. (not lore friendly)\r<br />\r<br />I have only basic tested this mod but it has been tested by the person who requested it who has said he has found no issues with anything. If you download and use this please be aware of this and report any issues to myself (nicely please)\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]njl_QGl3Tqk[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />A HUGE thank you to izon87604  for this beautiful video\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#FBB117]PLEASE CHECK OUT MY OTHER HOUSE MODS[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54846/?]TREE LODGE[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54937/?]Orc Longhouse[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#FBB117] A HUGE THANK YOU TO THE FOLLOWING[/color][/b] whom I use in most of my house mods.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14133/?]FoodContainer Resource[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1505-strotis-ovens-resource/]Strotis Ovens Resource 1.0[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1591-strotis-kitchen-tools/]Strotis Kitchen Tools 1.1[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1440-general-stores-storage-resource-for-packrats/]General Stores[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1436-insanitys-paintings/]Insanity&#39;s Paintings[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1264-catering-by-lilith/]Catering by Lilith[/url]\r<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1480-static-armour-stands/]Static Armour Stands[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14134/?]OpenBooks Resource[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30599/?]Alchemy Clutter Resource[/url]",
