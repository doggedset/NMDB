  "descriptionHtml": "A remastered, updated version of X&#39;eera is available at [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84639][u][color=#0066cc]XG Followers[/color][/u][/url]&#33; Go get her there :)\r<br />\r<br />For long I wished to create a female Khajiit follower, mainly because there is none in Skyrim. Finally I got around it, and therefore I bring you X&#39;eera, a wanderer who will join you on your adventures if you so wish.\r<br />\r<br />X&#39;eera will level up with your character, up to level 100. She has a customised combat style: heavy-armored, 2-hand warrior, and though she prefers going melee, she is versatile enough to use bows if she&#39;s out of range from the enemy - she has all the corresponding perks for these. She also knows a few self-healing spells, should the need arises, plus, like every cat living up to the name, she has all the sneaking perks as well. Overall, X&#39;eera is not too fancy or overpowered, but useful and reliable upon instead.\r<br />Her inventory includes ebony crafted weapons, ammo and armour. Added a book as well so she can have something to do during her breaks xD\r<br />About her voice: it was not an easy choice, given the possibilities. I didn&#39;t feel comfortably either in giving her an elven voice, so I decided for a neutral, even human tone.\r<br />\r<br />Where to find her:\r<br />X&#39;eera has a fully working schedule in Riften. Right before dawn, this kitty leaves Haelga&#39;s Bunkhouse and goes to the docks to fish... no, I&#39;m kidding, she doesn&#39;t go fishing, but she actually works there - she maintains the boats and the overall dock area clean and functional. Roughly at early afternoon, she returns to the Bunkhouse where she takes her meals at the main area, and sleeps upstairs. So you will surely find her in one of these places.\r<br />\r<br />X&#39;eera is completely standalone, so you will not need any additional mods for her to work. Her [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii SkyHair[/url] style is included already in her file.\r<br />\r<br />Please let me know if you find any issues requiring attention. Have fun and Happy New Year :)\r<br />\r<br />....................................................................................................................................\r<br />\r<br />Credits and Special Thanks to:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii SkyHair[/url] for the hairstyle included.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3552857]Xannon98[/url] for his full support and help, screenshots, beta testing and for being awesome.\r<br />\r<br />....................................................................................................................................\r<br />\r<br />Change log:\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0\r<br />Initial release.\r<br />\r<br />....................................................................................................................................\r<br />\r<br />Legal/Permission: Contact-me by PM if you wish to include my mods into your own work.
