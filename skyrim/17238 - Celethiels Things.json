  "descriptionHtml": "I dislike the fact mages don\\'t have armor and disliked most robes except the Synod robes so I created the Mage Armor, and I also had Dwemer Urns and Pots pickupable. (except the one within the store in the Riften)\r\n\r\nThe second one is my second installment of it, which adds a katana blade within a known dungeon, i don\\'t know if it\\'s over ballanced or not... I also added an Arch-mage Armor that looked like the Thalmor robes, (i liked the thalmor Robes, and not the Archmage robes gee i can\\'t imagine why oh yes i can... The Archmage robes looked like some hedge mage...) \r\nYou\\'ll find it in the Archmages quarters, along with a different version of the Magus armor, and a Magus Hood.\r\n\r\nI am not telling you where the katana is however I will give you a clue:\r\n\\\"In Twilight the star sinks beneath the waters\\\"\r\n\r\nYou will need both esp files and place them in steam-steamaps-common-skyrim-data folder",
