  "descriptionHtml": "This is a compilation of mods that worked for me in boosting FPS in Skyrim. You can download my .ini files from this page and download the rest of the mods from their respective pages, make sure to give credit to the mod creators.\r<br />\r<br />-Custom config files (.ini) built up from alot (5+) of config files I found made by others. I compiled all these into one single config file that is fully customizable  and offers the most framerate boost. You can get these config files in the &#34;Files&#34; tab on this page.\r<br />To install this you need to replace the files usually found in &#34;Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim&#34;. \r<br />To change the FoV go on Skyrim.ini, press &#34;Ctrl+F&#34; and search for &#34;FOV&#34;, I already made it a bit higher so it makes up for the low resolution.\r<br />\r<br />-&#34;Colorful Lights&#34; mod by TRoaches. This mod removes shadows from your game, providing a huge framerate boost, although SOME lights will still produce shadows. http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10789/? \r<br />\r<br />-&#34;Remove Underwater Grass and other stuff&#34; mod by Cauug. This mod removes underwater grass because it is not being rendered most of times and it looks bad, providing a framerate boost and a more immersive underwater. On installation the mod also comes with the options to remove small underwater AND land rocks. So you get all these 3 options. http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55240/?\r<br />\r<br />WARNING: IN ORDER TO USE THESE MODS YOU NEED SKSE (Skyrim Script Extender). Get it at http://skse.silverlock.org/\r<br />\r<br />FOR TROUBLESHOOTING THESE MODS, PLEASE VISIT THE ORIGINAL POSTS BY CLICKING THE LINKS PROVIDED ABOVE.",
