  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i1161.photobucket.com/albums/q515/Dfac364/RRBlacksmithCover.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nOkay so this mod doesnt tie in much with discworld lore, it may be because i read too much but when I tried to come up with a name Mr.Burleigh and Mr.Stronginthearm are the only ones that came to mind.  Regardless this is still a pretty solid if rather small for the moment weapon pack of a crusades era inspired one hand sword, bastard sword, and shield, all balanced and made craftable simply by reading a copy of Burliegh and Stronginthearm\\'s Advanced smithing Recipes as can be found at the riverwood trader.\r\n\r\n================\r\nInstallation\r\n================\r\nMerge the downloaded data file with the steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\data folder \r\ndata file should contain the .esm file and a textures and meshes file\r\n\r\n\r\n================\r\nMod Includes\r\n================\r\n-Cuinas: bastard sword\r\n-Caldbolg: long sword\r\n-Hadron\\'s Shield\r\n-Book: Advanced Smithing Recipes\r\n\r\n================\r\nOther Great Mods\r\n================\r\n[url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17569\\\"]Militarize Solitude[/url]\r\n[url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17692\\\"]Legend of the Lost Sword[/url]\r\n\r\n================\r\nSpecial Thanks to\r\n================\r\nToo many people so ill just say everyone who has ever posted a tutorial or answered a question on the nexus \r\n",
