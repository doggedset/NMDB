Made him because my pack mules kept dying on me, or could barely get a scratch on a falmer.\r\n\r\nYou can find him chilling in The Bannered Mare in Whiterun, on the balcony with access thru the bedroom! Enjoy and please send feedback me way! I would truely appreciate it since this in my first mod! Working on his carrying load to be heavier and more colorful dialogue! ^_^\r\n\r\n\r\nPS....comes with his famous battle cries, so beware if wearing headphones!!! lol I almost jumped out of my seat the first time I heard him roar!
