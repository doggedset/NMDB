  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=4]\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/b][size=6][u][color=#f6b26b]Vale Horse[/color][/u][/size]\r<br />Like to ride you&#39;re own exclusive horse, &#39;that&#39; specialy horse for  Woodelves.\r<br />\r<br />Once an idea to make a mod out of it. Well...they sitting for years  in my folders and i am doing nothing with them. Hours of work and nobody can enjoy them. \r<br />The eyes & tail, the new g_dds  & n.dds textures are my own work. The main horse texture is created from  vanilla Vale Animals. \r<br />It is possible to make the spots glow like the vale animals becuase of the g.dds.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Insted to let them useless sitting and catch dust in my folders i put them up for you to use in your personal game or for a mod as long nothing of  the textures are included within the mod file itself .A Small link to here &  little credit for my work is apreciated. [color=#e69138][b]\r<br />(not sure what i can or not can do with vanilla edited textures from dlc&#39;s or if i can put them up as recourse)\r<br /> [/b][/color]\r<br />[color=#f6b26b]- Esp file is in the main file, Riften horse will be changed .\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Why can&#39;t i download it with my NMM ?[/color]\r<br />Because i don&#39;t play Skryim for years now and don&#39;t even whant to download the tool . I don&#39;t whant to make a horse mod for it.\r<br />[size=3]y[/size]ou realy need a littlebit of knowledge to add them to your own horse. Making the spots glow you need to add property to the  nif in Niftool.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you use a standalone horse mod,just rename them into the right dds file names and replace them. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#f6b26b]Textures:[/color]\r<br />eye.dds\r<br />eye_g.dds\r<br />ValeHorse.dds\r<br />ValeHorse_g.dds\r<br />ValeHorse_n.dds\r<br />ValeMainTail.dds\r<br />(used vanilla normal map for the tail)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f6b26b][size=3]Maby More[/size][/color]\r<br />I think i will add later on these textures to\r<br />\r<br />- Vale sadle with celtic leather parts\r<br />\r<br />A Tiger horse skin ( i know i love the impossible)\r<br />[img]http://i66.tinypic.com/21jzqiq.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />THIS UPLOAD IS NOT RESOURCE MATERIAL. \r<br />No one may assign, directly or indirectly, all or part of our creative rights or obligations to other modders without our written consent.",
