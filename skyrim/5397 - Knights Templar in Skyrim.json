  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/H1zcLJD.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n[center]Knights Templar mod by lukaluka94[/center]\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/yvknt0n.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n[color=red][b]*NOTE: NEW GAME WON\\\"T START WITH THIS MOD TURNED ON. Please turn it off, and turn it on again when you\\'re done with Helgen part. (when you leave the cave)*[/b][/color]\r\nThis mod adds Knights Templar faction, armors and companions to Skyrim. The reason I made this is because I like Knights Templar and I wanted to play as one in Skyrim. Faction is added in Helgen, and they occupy Helgen Keep for now. I added most of crafting tables in the keep, including a blacksmith to buy or sell your equipment. As I\\'m not really experienced in CK, I had to use what I had at hand. There are no quests for now, and maybe I\\'ll add them in future. \r\n\r\nThere are 7 new armors and 4 new helmets added to the game, from which 2 are heavy, 2 are light and last 3 are robes which were present in the old version of the mod. Armor stats are quite balanced now compared to the last version. Heavy armor stats equal to Ebony armor stats for example, so they are more suited for later stages of the game. All of the armors are craft-able/upgrade-able/buy-able. (Aside from Robes which are located in the chest in Barracks) If you think armors aren\\'t balanced or some stats need to be changed, please respond in comments section.\r\n\r\nOther then armors, there are new NPCs and Companions in the mod which can be found in Helgen. They don\\'t have dialogues and they don\\'t do much either, other then companions who fight by your side. They are also quite strong in the beginning of the game and their stats may change in future. Three of the new companions are:\r\nSir Walter the Honourable - He can be found in \\\"dining room\\\" in Helgen Keep.\r\nSir Pascal the Healer- He is in the Barracks, also in Helgen Keep.\r\nSir Anthon the Arrow - He is located in Helgen when you enter the \\\"fort\\\".\r\n[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Rke00TI.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\nPlease comment and give me your ideas on what I can improve, what I can change and most importantly, what I can add in future.  \r\n[color=red]Please enjoy and if you like it, please \\\"Endorse\\\" the file. I put a small \\\"Easter-egg\\\" in there, and let\\'s see if anyone finds it.[/color]\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/ANvPA1P.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n*INSTALLATION*\r\nJust copy/paste the \\\"Data\\\" folder located in KTIS folder, to your Skyrim main game directory, or download with NMM. This mod does not replace any original files.\r\n\r\n*UNINSTALLATION*\r\nJust delete the files you copied.\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/hgbjRIq.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\nThere are number of issues in the mod, and I hope I can fix them later. Please post any problems you encounter in the comments section. For now, known issues are:\r\n\r\n* Templar Flags don\\'t appear in Helgen Keep - I couldn\\'t find a solution to this.\r\n* NPC have no Markers assigned to them, and they might sometimes do stupid things as standing around and doing nothing.\r\n* Templar Great Helmet might not appear correctly on non-human characters. (I\\'ve noticed on Orcs) \r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/evEe4HY.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\nI\\'m no modeler, and I merely re-textured these armors which are included in the mod.
