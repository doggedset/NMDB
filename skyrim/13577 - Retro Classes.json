  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Skill Classes[/b]\r\n\r\nThis mod makes your life harder by disabling trainers and books (with the exception of crafting skill books) and slowing down your skill gains by applying a class based on your training that further slows down skills you have not focused on. If your training habbits change the game will reapply a more suitable class for you.\r\n\r\nYou may choose to balance this with gaining all perks you qualify for automatically, or simply use this to make training tougher in your game. The option to choose between game modes is presented when you gain your first skill point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]About the classes:[/b]\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of skill gaining speed and having the game select your class the skills are divided into three groups:\r\nCombat skills: Block, Heavy Armor, One-Handed, Two-Handed and Archery.\r\nStealth skills: Light armor, Sneak, Pickpocket, Lockpicking and Speech.\r\nMagic skills: Destruction, Restoration, Illusion, Alteration and Conjuration.\r\n\r\nNote that Alchemy, Smithing and Enchanting have no effect on the classes or vice-versa, they will not affect class selection and they will raise just like they do in vanilla Skyrim.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]Warrior[/i]\r\nGained by favoring combat skills over stealth and magic.\r\nLearns combat skills at 80% speed compared to vanilla, but stealth and magic skills only raise at 20% speed.\r\n\r\n[i]Thief[/i]\r\nGained by favoring stealth skills over combat and magic.\r\nLearns stealth skills at 80% speed compared to vanilla, but combat and magic skills only raise at 20% speed.\r\n\r\n[i]Mage[/i]\r\nGained by favoring magic skills over stealth and combat.\r\nLearns magic skills at 80% speed compared to vanilla, but stealth and combat skills only raise at 20% speed.\r\n\r\n[i]Rogue[/i]\r\nA mix of Warrior and Thief classes. Combat and stealth skills raise at 50% vanilla speed, while magic skills raise at 20% speed.\r\n\r\n[i]Spellsword[/i]\r\nA mix of Warrior and Mage classes. Combat and magic skills raise at 50% vanilla speed, while stealth skills raise at 20% speed.\r\n\r\n[i]Nightblade[/i]\r\nA mix of Mage and Thief classes. Magic and stealth skills raise at 50% vanilla speed, while combat skills raise at 20% speed.\r\n\r\n[i]Bard[/i]\r\nA jack-of-all-trades class that gains all skills at 40% vanilla speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks to QuietusPlus for making the original skill perks mod and taking the time to explain it to a moron, also to fg109 for answering stupid questions on the forums.\r\nYou can find QuietusPlus\\' Skill based perks (which the older versions were using) for Skyrim mod here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12773",
