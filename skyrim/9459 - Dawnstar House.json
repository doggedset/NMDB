  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Dawnstar House\r\nVersion: Beta\r\nDate: 2/13/2012\r\nAuthor(s): antonkr\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis mod adds Dawnstar housing to Skyrim. I felt like this bare snowy town had no retreat for Dragonborn so I decided to make this rather comfortable cabin for you to enjoy. The cabin includes a warm bed, a nice bookshelf to store all your books at,  a fireplace for your cooking, and a alchemy table for all your potion and poison making needs.  \r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nThe location of the house is right across from Khajiit tents a little bit outside of Dawnstar\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall (without NMM)\r\n=======\r\n1. Copy the .esp file to (install folder)\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n2. Check to make sure that it\\'s activated\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n1. Delete the .esp file from \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\nMake sure that you have all your stuff from the house if you do decide to uninstall. \r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nThe only known incompatability is if you are running Expanded Villages by Shade04rek, which has a house in the same spot. \r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nNavmesh is currently a bit buggy outside, but your companions should still be able to walk in and walk out of the house.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\nBeta, February 13th 2012 - Initial release.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nIf you have any issues please contact me through PM on Nexus, or email me. \r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nReadme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r\n\r\n",
