  "descriptionHtml": "=ID LIKE TO SAY TY FOR DOWNLOADING MY MOD I\\'M GETTING 1 DL PER 25 VEIWS! LOVE YOU ALL!!!=\r\nHjerim, located in windhelm is a large player house designed to display the various things you collect on your journey, raise a family and rest. I have taken these things into consideration when upgrading this house for example. Enough bookshelves to collect books, The dragon priest alter to display your collection of masks, a sewer system to connect your house to important locations around skyrim, i think theres enough room to display the good stuff you can find in skyrim if i need more space il upgrade it further also please provide me with your thoughts and feeling about my mod as it will help me to improve it.\r\nSome of the ideas i plan to implement:\r\n1. intergrade the house with the jails through skyrim and add some *break people out of jail quests*\r\n2. an option secret bed that moves and reveals an entrance to my real bedroom, a coffin.\r\n3. delete most of the original house clutter and add more expensive clutter, would even like to go as far as the clutter gets upgraded based on the dark brother quest line/thief\\'s guild quest line progression.\r\n4. id like to expand this to all of the original houses in skyrim, honeyside etc.\r\n5. finally id like to do something the hearth fire houses but at the moment they look very complicated to play with and scare me :s\r\n\r\n",
