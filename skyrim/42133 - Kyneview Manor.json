  "descriptionHtml": "Pack up your stuff, its time to move out of that old cave. Situated high up in the mountains northwest of Bleak Falls Barrow and just shy west of Whiterun makes this home a ideal location. With its beautiful valley view and great set up, this player home is a good choice. \r\n\r\nAll containers are custom, meaning I just didn\\'t slap 10 chests on the ground and said heres your storage. I custom made everyone. It has a great shop and a nice lab. I added a teleportation system to and from all major holds and its on the map. Hall of Valor is still under contruction but is still usable. Other plans are to add another room. Other then that, this home is fully functional and is put together very good. The lighting is nice, the look and feel isn\\'t over the top like so many other player homes out there. I will add updates for this home as I go. Followers, servants ect ect.\r\n\r\nCheck out my other mods, please endorse and send me feedback. \r\n\r\n",
