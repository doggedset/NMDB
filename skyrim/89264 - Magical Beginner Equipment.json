  "descriptionHtml": "Let's face it, if you play as a mage, you don't have the choice of a lot of equipment in vanilla Skyrim, especially at low levels, since robes and magical items are so expensive. This mod adds five sets of magical clothing, with 6 pieces each. A hood, robe, gloves, ring, amulet, and boots.\n<br />\n<br />Each piece costs a base 50 gold, so expect to purchase it for about 150 gold from merchants. You can buy them from the caravans, the general goods stores, and the mages at the College of Winterhold. Each merchant will have 6 random pieces.\n<br />\n<br />The sets are:\n<br />\n<br />Student - 10 Extra Magicka per piece\n<br />\n<br />Scholar - Spells cost 3% less per piece\n<br />\n<br />Mystic - Magicka regenerates 25% faster per piece\n<br />\n<br />Destroyer - Destruction spells cost 6% less per piece\n<br />\n<br />Summoner - Conjuration spells cost 6% less per piece\n<br />\n<br />The sets use vanilla appearances.\n<br />\n<br />No DLC required\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Also! I had to make it so that the custom enchantments don't have any cost. (In order to make them cost a base 50 gold.) So don't try to disenchant them to make enchanted items, because the created items won't have any extra value, and they won't give any enchantment experience either.\n<br />\n<br />This mod may conflict with any mods that change the inventories (merchant chests) of the previously mentioned merchants. It won't crash your game though. It just means that the inventories of one mod may overwrite the other, so feel free to take liberties.",
