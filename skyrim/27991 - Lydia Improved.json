  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod and I do hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\nMy name is Amoryenar, but you can call me Amor.  The location of this file is in question, but that\\'s not important.\r\n\r\nWhat is important is I finally edited Lydia.  If you remember, Lydia had hazel eyes and a manly face and stance.  This mod changes the stance from Male to Female.  It gives her blue eyes and a more rounded face.  Pink lips as well.  All in all it makes Lydia a prettier woman.\r\n\r\nNow, I realize that this is not to everyone\\'s standard.  That\\'s fine.  Just please, don\\'t comment negetively as I may report you for trolling.\r\n\r\nI\\'d love to see your screenshots of my mod in action!\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nIt is compatible with Dawnguard and Hearthfire.\r\nYou don\\'t need anything special, as it\\'s just a face improvement\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\nI used the SkyrimNPCeditor and only used the Skyrim.esm and the Update.esm.\r\nI would prefer you NOT to use my improvement as a base, but rather get the editor and change her to your liking.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nJust drag the BSA and the ESP to your Data File and Tada\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\nJust delete the HousecarlWhiterun.bsa and the HousecarlWhiterun.esp\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBethesda for Skyrim\r\nNPCeditor http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4554\r\n\r\nTo make her look just like the screenshots:\r\n(will link when I get them)\r\nLiFE - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26354\r\nCoverwomem look 3 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563\r\nMilkdrinker skin - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24318",
