  "summary": "Dark, but not pitch black.\r\nClimates of Tamriel and Bleak/Unbleak required.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Because they go great together, just couldn\\'t stand the nights being pitch black. That was mostly due to CoT using values for nights completely outside the vanilla range. Other ENB\\'s apart from the official CoT one might also work better now when it comes to night time. This is specifically meant for ENB users, if you don\\'t plan on playing CoT with ENB, don\\'t use it.\r\n\r\nStill not happy with the nights? The following are relevant variables in the Unbleak\\'s enbseries.ini, can tweak it to your liking if you want clouds and the nights to be just a little a brighter.\r\nColorPowNight (lower it)\r\nCloudsIntensityNight (increase it)\r\n\r\nI personally increased CloudsIntensityNight to 0.85 from 0.65 since I prefer my clouds to be more visible at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
