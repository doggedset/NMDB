  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][size=4]Prowler&#39;s Profit: Immersive Clues to the Stones of Barenziah v 1.0[/size][/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a number of handwritten notes into the game which give clues about how to find each of the Stones of \r<br />Barenziah.  The idea for this was suggested by Jaberkaty on the official forums who wanted a more immersive method of \r<br />searching for each stone and one that unfolds as you progress along the Thieves Guild quest path.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s a reasonable gold sink as well, for the many players (myself included) who grumble about the abundance of gold in the game.\r<br />I&#39;ve edited only vanilla assets.  Only one stone was moved (refer to the readme for details).  You shouldn&#39;t need to start a new game to use this mod but obviously if you&#39;ve already finished the No Stone Unturned quest, there&#39;s no point installing this mod until your next playthrough.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s possible for some of the holders of the notes to be killed and therefore those notes could be lost in your game.  If that \r<br />happens and you don&#39;t know where a few of the stones are, you could download a mod which adds questmarkers to the game for \r<br />the No Stone Unturned quest and turn on the markers. Here&#39;s one: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9385/?\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE:\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Prowler&#39;s Profit - Non quest compatibility V1.1 (NOTE UPDATE)[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />I have uploaded an additional .esp that is compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33530/?]Non quest locations for Stones of Barenziah[/url] by Globox68 which changes the locations of the quest-locked stones.\r<br /> \r<br />It won&#39;t be compatible with any quest markers mod, however as some stones have been moved.  There is a separate readme for this mod in the mod archive - ie it&#39;s not the one showing under the nexus readme tab above.\r<br />\r<br />Both .esps have been cleaned with TESVEdit.",
