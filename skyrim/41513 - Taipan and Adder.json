  "summary": "Taipan is a blade that a minor gods soul had been absorbed into it. The minor god Adder, had suffered the same fate.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Taipan and Adder is a mod that I made that is essentialy for people that play a sneaky type or dual wield daggers or just simply use daggers. So Taipan is a glass dagger that absorbs stamina and has a higher damage output than the regular glass dagger. Same with Adder however it absorbs health instead of stamina. Oh and Adder is an elven dagger. To obtain Taipan and Adder all you have to do is go to ustengrav which is the place the grey beards send you to get the horn. The daggers should be right under the \\'mysterious note\\'. Or you could craft them. Or simply use the console, type in\r\n\\'help taipan 0\\' or \\' help adder 0 and then type in the code ( player.additem xxxxxxxxxx 1 )",
