  "summary": "A simple voice over replacer I have done for Peryite, if you don't like it that's cool you can just uninstall it as there is no esp/scripts etc. It's similar to removing an independent SKSE file it won't effect your game after removal.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Inspired by the work of: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16352?tab=description]Hircine Restoration Project[/url] by Robbie922004 \n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17833?tab=files]SSE version[/url]\n<br />\n<br />I also agreed that the Adoring fan was in my game was also too much and decided to take my own spin on the Lord of Pestilence who I really like alot. My voice is nothing special, but if you want to listen to it in it's entirety you can find it [url=https://soundcloud.com/purgey/peryite-2]here [/url]before installing. Or a sample can be found in this video below:\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]vjWh0hJkSzk[/youtube]",
