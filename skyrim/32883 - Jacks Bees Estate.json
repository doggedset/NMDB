[/size] \r\n\r\n[size=3][color=red]Compatibility:[/color][/size] \r\n\r\nEverything that doesn\\'t overwrite the meshes or textures of bee hives.\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=red]Notes:[/color][/size] \r\n\r\n1) If you should use HD_textures_DLC_Fix_1_3b you will be asked to overwrite three files, choose yes (sorry but mine\\'s look relly better than those). :) \r\n\r\n2) I didn\\'t had all the time needed to test everything in real game but Havok tells me this mod shouldn\\'t be so bad after all. However please report issues if any, I will try to fix them, real life allowing.\r\n\r\n3) This mod also changes some \\\"effects\\\" which \\\"affects\\\" other istance in the game, more on the readme.\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=red]Relyability:[/color][/size] \r\n\r\nIt\\'s proven it will work until you decide to get rid of it. \r\n\r\n[/center]",
