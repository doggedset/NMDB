  "descriptionHtml": "Taken Veterans - Balanced Character Builds\r\n\r\nBamfa - Female Imperial Nightblade\r\nor Bamf - Male Imperial Nightblade\r\n\r\nBamfa is a bad-ass magic-flinging assassin. In combat, solo opponents fall to her devastating sneak-attacks. Groups of multiple enemies, under the spell of Bamfa\\'s expert tier Illusions, tear each other apart and Bamfa has only to clean up their mess--after enjoying the show.\r\n\r\nThis Neutral Evil creature of darkness is going to make the people of Skyrim wish dragon attacks and civil war were all they had to worry about. She believes everyone exists only as playthings for her pleasure--before, during, and after their deaths at her hand. No one and no thing is safe from her remorseless killings, which are often committed just to watch the victims die. Or, as Bamfa puts it, \\\"for practice\\\".\r\n\r\nChildren dislike her the moment she arrives in town, as if they already know they are soon to be orphans with a yard full of dead pets. Bar wenches are the only thing that ever gives her pause, making unsettling comments as if they too know Bamfa\\'s true nature.\r\n\r\nBamfa has 29 unallocated Perk Points, 220 Magicka (+50 Highborn), 220 Health, and 150 Stamina.\r\n\r\nBamfa\\'s Initial Skills:\r\n\tAlteration, Illusion, Sneak 75\r\n\tArchery, One-Handed, Light Armor 60\r\n\tConjuration, Restoration, Speech, Pickpocket, Heavy Armor, Two-Handed, Smithing, Enchanting, Destruction, Block, Alchemy, Lockpicking 15\r\n\r\n3*(75*76/2) + 3*(60*61/2) + 12*(15*16/2)\t\t\t\r\n= 15,480 [url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Total Experience Spent In Skills[/url]\r\n\r\nBamfa\\'s Spells:\r\n\tMagelight, Detect Life, Telekinesis, Waterbreathing, Detect Dead, Ebonyflesh, Paralyze\r\n\tClairvoyance, Muffle, Frenzy, Rally, Invisibility, Pacify, Rout\r\n\tSteadfast Ward, Close Wounds, Heal Other, Repel Lesser Undead\r\n\tBound Sword, Conjure Flame Atronach, Soul Trap, Bound Bow\r\n\t\r\nBamfa\\'s Powers:\r\n\tHighborn (+50 Magicka)\r\n\tHighborn (Fast Daily Regen)\r\n\tProwler\\'s Profit\r\n\t\r\nBamfa\\'s Shouts:\r\n\tThrow Voice (Zul Mey Gut)\r\n\tMarked for Death (Krii Lun Aus)\r\n\t\r\nBamfa\\'s Gear:\r\n\tEbony Dagger, Linwe\\'s Hood, Linwe\\'s Armor, Linwe\\'s Gloves, Linwe\\'s Boots\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n3.0 New Version (Dumped Speech & Conjuration)\r\n1.0 Old Version (Incl. Speech and Conjuration)\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhenever a character earns a rank, r, in a skill they gain r experience. When a character has 0 in all skills they have zero experience, and when they have 100 in all skills, at level 81.5, they have 90,900 experience. A character normally hits Level 30 at 15,865 Total Experience.\r\n\r\nTaken Veterans should look good with any texture or mesh mods you may use, if any.
