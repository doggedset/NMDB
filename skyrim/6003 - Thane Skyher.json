  "descriptionHtml": "Thane of Riften, WhiteRun and Markarth (with homes and stored loot).  Completed Thieves Guild, Companion and Mage College Quests.  Wife is Ysolda (lives her house).  Combat oriented (49) and high in all the violent badhaviors, Enchantment and Speech.\r\n\r\nNot chosen sides!!\r\n\r\nMods used (the mods are not the point), but you should be OK without them - except would use Riften Stable update or you may loose significant loot stashed there.\r\n\r\n-  Calientes CBBE\r\n-  Better Females by Bella\r\n-  High Quality Eyes by Xenius\r\n-  Killer Keos Skimpy Armor for CBBE\r\n-  Sky UI\r\n- Riften Stable 0 1 6 (by Shawk)\r\n-  other misc HD retextures\r\n\r\nThis is not a custom look, only vanilla from the mods above.  The value of this mod is the hours spent to get a strong character with a well established reputation and coin (no cheats) - and launch your end-game strategy.\r\n",
