  "descriptionHtml": "I was tired of the weak Atronachs ingame getting one shotted by every minor enemy on Master difficulty. Since I am a 100 Conjuration Charachter, I thought I&#39;d buff their health a bit.\r<br />\r<br />This buffs the Flame Thrall&#39;s HP to around 8000 (thats rly unbalanced atm) but it helps not having to reconjure them every minute. The amount of health might change (depending on what feedback I get) in later versions.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;",
