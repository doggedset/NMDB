  "descriptionHtml": "Feb 18: This feature is now included in the Unofficial Dragonborn Patch (ver. 1.0.1), so I recommend downloading the patch instead of this mod.\r\n\r\nDownload the patch here; http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31083\r\n\r\n=======================================================================================\r\nBethesda decided, for some unknown reason, to have the same music playing in the homes of Raven Rock as in Apocrypha and (at least it sounds like it) Castle Volkihar. I don\\'t agree with this decision.\r\n\r\nThis mod changes the music of those houses to be more hospitable and generic, using the same playlist that runs while exploring Solstheim. Not a very dramatic change, but at least I think it\\'s a change for the better.\r\n\r\nObviously, you\\'ll need the Dragonborn DLC to enjoy this mod. Hope you like it :)",
