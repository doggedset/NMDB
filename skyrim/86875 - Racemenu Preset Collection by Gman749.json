Always getting into mischief with her adopted sister, Kasia.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/7w0ZTaa.jpg[/img]\r<br />Kasia Akheton (Imperial)\r<br />\r<br />Age -21\r<br />Birthplace - Anvil, Cyrodil\r<br />Relatives- Father Rivus Akheton (deceased) mother Lucilla Akheton (deceased) Adopted parents Erland Stormhammer and Decima Ventius, adopted sisters Freya and Siv Stormhammer\r<br />Skillset- Dual-wield, one-handed, sneak, pickpocket\r<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/vDrqUz0.jpg[/img]\r<br />A war orphan surviving on the streets, Kasia was taken in by Erland Stormhammer at 8 years old. Growing up in a Fighters Guild, she quickly developed a mastery of swordsmanship and possesses an indomitable  (and reckless) fighting spirit, despite her small size. Adores her adopted sister Siv.\r<br />\r<br />Note: I included Kasia&#39;s tattoos but if you would rather not have them or dont want to download that mod, you can go to Body Paints in RaceMenu and slide her tattoos down to 0, otherwise more than likely her body will appear shaded purple&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/c9pvbYQ.jpg[/img]\r<br />Freya Stormhammer (Nord)\r<br />Age-30\r<br />Birthplace-Solitude, Skyrim\r<br />Relatives- Father Erland Stormhammer (deceased) mother Decima Ventius, sister Siv and adopted sister Kasia \r<br />Skillset- two-handed \r<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/8vWeUaA.jpg[/img]\r<br />Serious, pragmatic and physically imposing, Freya is quite different from her younger sister Siv. She feels burdened with carrying on her father&#39;s legacy as the older daughter, and has honed herself into a near-perfect warrior. Frequently butts heads with her brash little sis, Kasia who, along with Siv and family friend Jai, are employed in her startup mercenary guild, Stormhawk Company, which she operates out of Skyrim after her late father&#39;s guild was shut down along with all other Fighters Guilds in Cyrodiil as part of the White-Gold Concordat\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/MrjQ3Sm.jpg[/img]\r<br />Jai, or &#34;JJ&#34; to her friends (Bosmer)\r<br />Age -24\r<br />Birthplace - Valenwood\r<br />Relatives- Father, Lenoril, mother, Una, older brother Erthas, younger sister Syl \r<br />Skillset - Archery, one-handed\r<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/aWCC5X1.jpg[/img]\r<br />The bright, cheerful Jai is daughter of Erland&#39;s best friend Lenoril, and thus is intens",
