  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][color=#efefef]This is a guide to using a handful of simple scripts I have written in order to make a buildable-home, that also gives the player some options to customize the appearance of pillows, rugs, and other decorative elements.\r<br />\r<br />Included in the file is a pdf-guide (with screenshots), 4 scripts (and their sources) and a mesh of a generic toolbox that can physically be used to represent each buildable section of the home. \r<br />\r<br />Links to suggested reading is added at the bottom of the PDF. The nature of how I make these houses call for scripts and objects to be intertwined a bit, so it&#39;s definitely possible that I have forgotten some detail, or have not been entirely clear on some step. \r<br />\r<br /> Please leave feedback on anything that doesn&#39;t work, so I can fix it. [/color]\r<br />[color=#ff7700]\r<br />[/color][color=#ff7700]\r<br />Credits and further reading: [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#efefef]Darkfox127 home building tutorial: [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwBLWOe4o2o]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwBLWOe4o2o[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#efefef]Darkfox127 Unique Display Cases Script (not covered here, but very well made)[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM3pBqQ1Ai0]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM3pBqQ1Ai0[/url]\r<br />[/size]",
