  "descriptionHtml": "IMPORTANT UPDATE: Vendors changed. These plants can now be found in Whiterun at \\\"Arcadia\\'s Cauldron\\\", and in Solitude at \\\"Angeline\\'s Aromatics.\\\" There was a compatibility issue with my other set of house decorations. \r\n\r\n14 plants and flowers in various planters that can be purchased from vendors and placed in your home as decoration. \r\nArrange them in-game without using the Creation Kit! These were created using static objects & scenery, \r\nbut are entirely NEW objects that you can purchase and move around in-game. In some cases I combined multiple foliage models \r\nto create unique bouquets.\r\n\r\nCurrently, they can be found in Whiterun at \\\"Arcadia\\'s Cauldron\\\", and in Solitude at \\\"Angeline\\'s Aromatics.\\\"\r\n\r\nThere may be updates in the future which add additional plants and flowers\r\n\r\nHow to decorate your house without physics issues (this goes for ANY Skyrim object):\r\n01) Enter your house, drop all the items onto the floor (do so in batches of less than 10 for safest results).\r\n02) Save the game (still INSIDE your house).\r\n03) Load the game you just saved.\r\n04) BEFORE touching ANY object, exit your house then re-enter (very important).\r\n05) Now you can grab onto your objects and move them around how you want.\r\n06) If you accidentally pick an object up into your inventory, you\\'ll need to repeat the steps above before placing it where you want it.\r\nAnd there you have it. You can freely exit your house now, and everything will be just how you left it when you come back. \r\n\r\nWe all know that the physics in Skyrim can be unpredictable, so please leave feedback for items acting strangely.\r\n\r\nCheck out my other uploads for similar sets of items",
