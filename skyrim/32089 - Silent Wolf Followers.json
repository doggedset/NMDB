No more annoying breathing sound!\r\nMade by request, originally for my mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10694]Wolf Master[/url] but it should be compatible with other wolf follower mods. Only the breathing sound is removed, all other wolf sounds play like usual.\r\n\r\nI made 2 different versions:\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Wolves breathe silently.esp: makes all wolves breathe silently. \r\n[*]Wolf followers breathe silently.esp: makes all wolves breathe silently too, but only if you have an animal follower. So as soon as a Wolf follows you, he will stop making any breathing sound. When you dismiss him, he will make that sound again. Only downside is, he will also stop making the sound if you have another animal with you, but I guess you can live with that ;)\r\n[/list]",
