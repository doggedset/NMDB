  "summary": "A paintjob for the dark and dirty looking walls, floors and doors of the buyable House in Markarth. Changes all dwemer ruins too,  because they use the same textures.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Have you been dissapointed too after your first visit of your newly aquired home in Markarth? I changed the coloring of some textures to a warm brazen hue, and some to a cleaner grey hue. They match together well, and make the place brighter and much cosier (at least in my opinion).\r\nDrop the content of the zip.-file into you main Skyrim-Directory (Bethesda\\\\The Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\dungeons\\\\dwemerruins).\r\nDue to the fact, that the textures are -well, painted- they loose sharpness and appear cleaner, less gritty. So if you are looking for sharper, more detailed textures, these are probably not to your liking.\r\n\r\nThanks to all the people, who like them anyway, thank you for your endorsements and your uplifting, positive comments! I was quite happy, when I read them last night. Thank you very much!",
