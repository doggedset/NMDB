  "modName": "Roleplaying Abodes - Survivor Camp",
  "summary": "A camp fit for around 30 people to live in. Ideal for roleplaying in zombie mods, or simply having your followers on the road with you.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A relatively large camp within the Rift. It has a dozen or two tents, some of which contain several beds, or supplies. Most tents, however, are small and therefore have one bedroll inside. \r<br />\r<br />This was hard to do, and its quality is great, for the area used. There ARE points where tents and bedrolls don&#39;t look right... Even the large table, too. It is nothing that will ruin your experience, and it has been fully tested. It also comes with a set of armour, just like General Tullius&#39;, (Only belonging to a different General), but it is all heavy armour. Gloves, boots and body. This is part of the camp&#39;s backstory, you see. It also comes with two journals, for some lore about the camp, and what is going on. I heavily recommend this mod with a zombie mod, of which there are several. \r<br />\r<br />I will add a larger backstory to the camp, as well as an NPC for every tent (except one for the player) upon request.",
