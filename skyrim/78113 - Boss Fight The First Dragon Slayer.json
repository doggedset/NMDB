I stood atop my destination with my sword in hand. I heard a dragon roar from the blistering winds beyond. From the howling blizzard a dragon fell into view. It&#39;s body bloody and beaten. Its eyes glassed over as its life faded away. My opponent was dead, but not by my hand. As the torrents of icy winds parted, a figure came into view, and I prepared myself. &#34;You&#39;ll meet your end mortal,&#34; Shouted a dreadful voice from beyond. I rushed to engage my opponent, but I was easily blocked. A massive decaying man adorned in ancient nordic armor stood before me. His breath colder than death. His strength greater than anything I had ever encountered. My body began to trickle with pain as a surge of lightning coursed through my body. I felt my body begin to slip into Sovngarde. The man struck at me and his colossal blow sent me flying. I looked up with determination in my eye. The battle for the ages was about to begin. The Mighty Dragonborn vs the First Dragon Slayer.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds the powerful level 60 boss, known as the First Dragon Slayer, to the map. To find him, you must visit Riverrun&#39;s Inn the Sleeping Giant.
