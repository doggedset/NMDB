  "descriptionHtml": "An Imperfect  Re-Texture of Backsteppo\\'s Dragon Quest Sage Outfit.\r\nskyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9387\r\n\r\nIt\\'s for UNP, But I use CBBE in the images. I think it should look alright with any body. \r\n\r\nStandalone::\r\nCan be crafted under leather. Upgradable at the table with elves ears. \r\n\r\nUpdate:: I\\'ve added a new file wear the cape no longer takes up the amulet slot. Now you can wear your amulets with the cape. Lighting issues fixed, craftable under leather at the forge. \r\nChanged from clothing to light armor (more of a personal thing since I only use light armor). \r\nNormal maps were changed a bit.\r\n\r\nBacksteppo is M.I.A at the moment, which means that I haven\\'t got word from him about uploading the re-texture. But he seems to encourage people to do as they please with his work. So with that, I\\'ve decided to put this up for download. \r\n\r\nI edited the armor to be transparent so instead of just new textures, the mesh was edited to be transparent. So new mesh, new texture. You don\\'t need to download Backsteppo\\'s Sage Outfit. \r\n\r\nIssues\r\n=======\r\nThis re-texture has lots of flaws. It\\'s not perfect! Sorry!\r\n=======\r\nPermissions:\r\nDO NOT upload any of my works with out my expressed permission. Thank you. \r\nI do not give permissions to upload my works on Steam, whatsoever. \r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Backsteppo for his amazing armor and the freedom to edit them!\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9387\r\n\r\nThanks to LABTECH for putting a link on her amazing re-colors for the Sage Outfit! \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10710\r\n\r\nThanks to jacktthompson for creating a great fix for the lighting issue! (God knows I was having the worse time figuring out how to do that.) \r\n\r\nThanks to Nikinoodles for allowing me to use his edited sage cloak! \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12092\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who encourages me with nice words, thoughtful critiques and great suggestions! Without you all, this file would have remain a hot mess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!!",
