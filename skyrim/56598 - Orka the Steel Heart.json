  "descriptionHtml": "This is a replacer file for Borgakh the steel heart, a follower found in an orc stronghold west of solitude. \r<br />\r<br />She is graceful and Noble and loyal to the core, a great dependable follower who was seriously in need of a makeover. She is unlike any orc I have met in the game, ferocious in battle gentle in town. a nice change from the typical follower....\r<br />\r<br />I always enjoy the vanilla followers over custom made followers. I don&#39;t know if its just my old memories of console glory or im just nostalgic, but either way I felt that the original female warriors of skyrim deserved to shine like custom npc&#39;s\r<br />\r<br />Install\r<br />A very simple replacer file. it should work with any mod because it changes the original follower which can then be changed by any mods installed.\r<br />\r<br />Required Mods:\r<br />Apachii sky hair\r<br />The Eyes of Beauty \r<br />\r<br />NOTE: if you want them to look like they do in the pictures you need Better Females by Bella if you don&#39;t already, it adds some sultry makeup...\r<br />\r<br />the photos are using Caliente w/ bodyslider for the body, but that is just my personal preference it will work with any body type, to make the follower you always wanted.\r<br />\r<br />just extract the files to the skyrim data folder and that&#39;s it. super easy, super worth it.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy and be sure to check out my other follower replacers...\r<br />Alice\r<br />Ping Berlyan\r<br />Nija Lidia\r<br />\r<br />Go and hear her tragic tale for yourself...\r<br />\r<br />Thanks\r<br />Manny",
