Includes the Fos-Ro-Dah sound bit for added effect with a general focus on making the sound more rich. I\\'ve cleaned it up, spliced in the Morrowind theme, and made cut out the middle of Vanilla theme to be replaced by Main Dragon boss fight song. Additionally I added a few sounds and effects for extra flair.\r\n\r\nEdited with Audacity!\r\n\r\n1.Installation\r\n-Place the music folder in your Steamapps/Skyrim/Data folder\r\n\r\n2.Unistallation\r\n-Remove the music folder or the mus_maintheme.xwm file.\r\n\r\n3.Questions/Comments Let me know and if you like it Please Endorse!!",
