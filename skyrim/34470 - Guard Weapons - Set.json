  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds for each Guard in the Holds suited coloured Bows, Daggers and Swords.\r\nIn example, to the Whiterun Guard it will add: Whiterun Guard\\'s Bow\r\n                                                                      Whiterun Guard\\'s Dagger\r\n                                                                      Whiterun Guard\\'s Sword\r\nLook the screenshots and pictures to see how they look.\r\nThe Mod adds a retex of the Imperial Sword, too.\r\nFor now, there\\'s a Version with or without the logos on the handles of the Daggers and Swords.\r\nThe Bows of both versions are, different to my Mod \\\"Guard Weapons - Bows\\\", without the logos.\r\nThe Weapons are balanced and in the right colour of the hold.\r\nIn the Screenshots  where all colours are shown: from left to right or respectively from up to the bottom: Falkreath, Eastmarch (Windhelm), Pale (Dawnstar), Markarth, Riften, Solitude, Whiterun, Winterhold, Hjaalmarch (Morthal).\r\nCOLLECT ALL OF THEM!\r\n\r\nTo install the mod, use the NMM or copy all files into the Skyrim\\\\Data-folder, then make sure it is activated.\r\n\r\nBugs: -THIS MOD IS WITHOUT THE GERMAN-GUARDS-BUG OF MY SWORD- AND BOWMOD.\r\n         - A big bug is, that, if your character uses the Bows, the animations are not right.\r\n           But if the Guards are using the Bows, all works good.\r\n         - I\\'m not sure, but it can be that the Mod renames the Imperial Bow to \\\"Kaiserlicher Bogen\\\" or\r\n           the steel Dagger to \\\"Stahldolch\\\".\r\n           In this case, to fix that Bug, you can open the CK and rename it manually.\r\n          IF YOU NOTICE OTHER BUGS, WRITE IT IN THE COMMENTS.\r\n\r\nI\\'m very proud of that Mod, because I have not so much experience in Modding, so please be gracious.\r\nI\\'m in hope that you enjoy this mod. Endorse if you like it!",
