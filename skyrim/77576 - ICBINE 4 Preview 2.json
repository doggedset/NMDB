(and ELFX for interiors)\r<br />[b][color=#00ff00](if your pc is so weak that it cant even handle skyrim Reloaded, ICBINE4 WILL WORK ANYWAYS)\r<br />[/color][/b]\r<br />If you want to see the performance impact you can try the cinematic preset of [url=http://http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63839/?]ICBINE 3[/url], by my calculations it should be as demanding as that preset.\r<br />(I will make an even more performance friendly version anyways, so dont worry&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][color=#00ffff]\r<br />FOR THOSE WHO DONT KNOW, ITS NOT ENB, ITS A SWEETFX PRESET, SO IF YOU CAN RUN AN ENB, THIS WILL TAKE LITERALLY 0 FPS, AND IF YOUR PC IS SUPER WEAK, IT WILL COST VERY FEW FPS :)[/color]\r<br />[/b][/size][color=#93c47d]\r<br />[font=Verdana][size=5][b]PLEASE GIVE ME SOME FEEDBACK SO I CAN MAKE IT AS NICE AS POSSIBLE&#33;[/b]\r<br />[/size][/font][/color][/center][color=#45818e]\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[center][/center]",
