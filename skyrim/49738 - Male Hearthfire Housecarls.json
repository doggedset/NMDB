  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b]Eye Candy Hearthfire HousePeople[/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Introducing:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Falkreath[/b]\r<br />Housecarl: [b]Karrod[/b]\r<br />Karrod is a Redguard that was raised in the north. Having lived all his life in Skyrim he cannot help but talk and even think like a Nord&#33; This helpful Housecarl is more than willing to fulfill his mistress&#39; commands\r<br />Bard: [b]Llewelyn the Nightingale[/b]\r<br />After a visit to The Face Sculptor in Riften, Llewelyn returns with a more youthful look, but with the same eager disposition to please\r<br />\r<br />[b]Morthal[/b]\r<br />Housecarl: [b]Valdimar[/b]\r<br />A wig, a lifting and voila&#33; No more old dude Housecarl&#33; Say hello to the young version of Mr Valdimar the Nord.\r<br />Bard: [b]Soniron the Reformed[/b]\r<br />Once imprisoned for stealing young women&#39;s hearts, Soniron now seeks to redeem himself by becoming an honest labourer&#33; Just make sure to count your silver before leaving your house just in case.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Dawnstar[/b]\r<br />Housecarl: [b]Krogo[/b]\r<br />Few things say &#34;bodyguard&#34; and &#34;will smash you to bits&#34; like an orc, so Jarl Skald is proud to present the first Orc Housecarl ever&#33; He might be a bit silent sometimes, but that&#39;s because he is always vigilant. He does relax a bit if he is turned into a steward and chat you until your ears are full of Orc nonsense.\r<br />Bard: [b]Telvis the Pelvis[/b]\r<br />Who says the nords are the only good bards out there? Meet Telvis, the dunmer bard that will make you want to move your pelvis&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements[/b]\r<br />Skyrim latest version\r<br />Hearthfire\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?]ApachiiSkyHair[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Latest Release 1.1[/b]\r<br />\r<br />*Fixed* The FaceTint issue&#33; I forgot to fix Faendal&#39;s so he&#39;ll come next&#33; Fixed also Karrod&#39;s voice, even though he now talks as a Nord. Krogo doesn&#39;t talk much unless you make him a steward, then he can&#39;t shut up. And yes, I forgot to take a screen of Karrod.  \r<br />\r<br />[b]Release 1.0 [b]\r<br />This is totally my first attempt at modding and I already know there are a couple of issues, but I shall fix them as soon as I learn how to (or simply change what doesn&#39;t work for something that does). The mod is inspired by one of my favourite mods ever, the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17163/?]Hot Male Housecarls[/url] by urshi . There I was playing the Hearthfire DLC only to find a woman as housecarl in Falkreath. Unacceptable. So I went ahead and did this little mod here to change that. \r<br />\r<br />Since I also don&#39;t like the idea of female bards in my poorly constructed mansions with workbenches I always forget to remove I also changed them into male versions. One of them is a dunmer I think. I haven&#39;t really fleshed their stories yet so patience, all will come in good time. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Known Issues[/b]\r<br />Karrod (Rayya&#39;s replacement) Face is in a different tint. No idea how to fix this yet but I plan to google answers and have that fixed soon. Also he doesn&#39;t talk. Guess the only voice possible for male housecarls is MaleNord so I&#39;ll have to change it to that.\r<br />The Orc Follower. I don&#39;t even have the Dawnstar house yet so I don&#39;t even know if this worked or not but I changed Gregor into an Orc. I totally have to get around and see if that worked too.\r<br />The Bards. I should have visited my houses before getting here and uploading this, but I just wanted to share with the world. Is that so wrong? I modded this for fun, and half the fun is finding out if it worked or not",
