  "descriptionHtml": "Hi, I\\'m not a modder, I just like to mess around with CK. Today, I just want to try out with Apachii hair, very messy process. I received frequent warnings about TRI files which I have no idea what it is, and also trying out vampire stuff in the process. I upload it here because well, I\\'m a generous man, even more, I want to hear some feedbacks & suggestions so I can improve myself later on.\r\n\r\nMod description\r\nAdd a vampire combat-necromage in Windhelm cemetery. To me, I just think combat-necromage is just a spellsword that is conjuration & necromancy oriented, so is it actually even different between the 2 at all? I don\\'t know, please tell me.\r\nBy the way she\\'s 0.9 ingame measurement tall & very pale as a vampire should.\r\n\r\nRequired mod\r\n- Apachii skyhair\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\n- Covereyes (the eyes looked better that way)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4869\r\n\r\nReccommended mods\r\n- Coverwomen look 3\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563\r\n- No more blocky faces\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30\r\n- Better females by Bella\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\n\r\n- She\\'s in Windhelm ceremtary & should return there when dismissed\r\n- She knows raise zombie, reanimate corpse, summon dragonpriest & dremora lord.\r\n- She also knows unrelenting force, ice form & storm call, just trying to express that she\\'s shouty & chaotic XD\r\n- Scales with the player\r\n- Marked as protected\r\n- Got lightfeet perk & vampire muffle\r\n- She\\'s in vampire & necromancer faction\r\n- Can be married\r\n- At low level, she fights like a vampire with storm call, but she\\'ll start using other spells as her level progresses\r\n- I give her 5000 more mana so it should be enough for her to cast just about any spells for people with mods that can teach your follower spells.\r\n- Her vampire skills got 02 at the end, so I don\\'t know does that make her a permanent stage 2 vampire though\r\n\r\nInstallation \r\n- Extract the file to SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n- At higher levels, she keeps switching between conjuring spells, but usually she will conjure the right thing for the right stuff. I\\'m thinking about removing raise zombie or conjure dragonpriest though, do tell me if you want me to remove them.\r\n-When she uses Unrelenting force, Ice form & storm call, you won\\'t hear she shout because I can\\'t find female voice for that, sorry :( \r\n\r\nWhat I\\'ve learned\r\n- Whether it\\'s 1.6 patch or my CK keeps acting up, it\\'s messy when I\\'m using apachii hair because her hair is floating far above her head & I have to customize her head bald & got to check ingame to see did I get her looks right\r\n\r\nFuture plans\r\n- Stick to followers for a while until I\\'m ready to move to dungeons\r\n- Recheck some old works when I know how to use other mods resources for customizations\r\n\r\nUpdate history\r\n1.00 Initial release\r\n1.20 Decrease the multiplier to 1 so she won\\'t get to 80 that quick, thanks to samjax777 who pointed that out to me :)\r\n\r\nLegal stuff\r\nDo whatever you want with this\r\n\r\nMy other experiments\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19508/\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19424/",
