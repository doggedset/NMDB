  "descriptionHtml": "[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]DESCRIPTION[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />This mod adds an Sustenance skill to Skyrim along with perks and its own perk tree. Although not technically dependant on it, this file REQUIRES the main [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56249/?]SCS - Skyrim Custom Skills[/url] files to work. [color=#e06666]Please visit the Main files&#39;s page for details about the mod&#39;s mechanics and installation instructions. All versions of this skill also require &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26228/?]Realistic Needs and Diseases[/url]&#34; by perseid9&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />As of version 2.0, there is also a Lockpicking version which uses the perk tree slot created by &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21792/?]Merged Thievery Skill[/url]&#34; by LukeH. This version is &#34;standalone&#34; and does NOT need the main SCS file to work. Just download it and make sure it is loaded AFTER the Merged Thievery Skill mod in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />As requested by some, I have also included another standalone version which integrates some of my Sustenance perks into SkyRe&#39;s Wayfarer perk tree. Not all of them are included because there is a limited number of nodes a perk tree can handle. This version requires SkyRe_Main.esp and SkyRe_Survivalism.esp so it needs to be loaded after both of them in your load order. \r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]IMPORTANT UPDATE NOTE[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />If updating to version 2.0 from an older version, make sure you ALSO update to version 2.0 of the Main file - bad things will happen otherwise...\r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]ABOUT SUSTENANCE[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />Primary needs are a much sought for feature in TES/Fallout games. Unlike New Vegas, Skyrim doesn&#39;t manage basic needs by itself but with an almost limitless modding potential it isn&#39;t really a problem. However, I have always felt primary needs should be more integrated into the main game via a skill and improve over time (much like Survavilism is somewhat tied to the primary needs in FNV). \r<br />My favourite needs mod is &#34;Realistic Needs and Diseases&#34; by perseid9 (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26228/?). (I know many players are shifting towards iNeed recently but I am way too satisfied and familiar with RND features and functionality to do that myself just yet.) This mod requires you to have RND installed as it depends on it. It disables some settings in the RND MCM menu - instead, you get more user-friendly values by taking relevant perks. This skill is raised by eating and drinking (but not when you are already full), cooking and eating homecooked meals. \r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]PERKS[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />Indefatigability\r<br />Requires: Sustenance 0/30/60\r<br />It takes slightly/moderately/much longer for you to get tired.\r<br />\r<br />Digestion\r<br />Requires: Sustenance 15/45/75, Runner\r<br />It takes slightly/moderately/much longer for you to get hungry.\r<br />\r<br />Mushroom Enthusiast\r<br />Requires: Sustenance 50, Digestion\r<br />While sneaking, you can eat mushrooms to reduce your hunger.\r<br />\r<br />Strong Stomach\r<br />Requires: Sustenance 75, Mushroom Enthusiast\r<br />You can eat stale and raw food without any penalties.\r<br />\r<br />Cannibal\r<br />Requires: Sustenance 80, Strong Stomach\r<br />You can feast on humanoid corpses.\r<br />\r<br />Hydration\r<br />Requires: Sustenance 30/60/90, Indefatigability\r<br />It takes slightly/moderately/much longer for you to get thirsty.\r<br />\r<br />Rain Dance\r<br />Requires: Sustenance 40/80, Hydration\r<br />You can decrease your thirst by drinking raindrops while it is raining./ You also gain the power to summon rain once a day.\r<br />\r<br />Sea Creature\r<br />Requires: Sustenance 60, Rain Dance\r<br />Bottled seawater now decreases your thirst and doesn&#39;t cause any harmuful secondary effects.  \r<br />\r<br />Alcoholic\r<br />Requires: Sustenance 40, Hydration\r<br />You suffer reduced side effects from drinking alcohol.\r<br />\r<br />Liquid Bread\r<br />Requires: Sustenance 50, Alcoholic\r<br />Drinking common alcoholic drinks reduces your hunger.\r<br />\r<br />Rest And Meditate\r<br />Requires: Sustenance 20/40/60/80/100, Indefatigability\r<br />You should rest and meditate on what you have learned.
