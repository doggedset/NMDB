[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]This mod also alters the \\'Augmented\\' perks to be significantly more effective. [/b]\r\n\r\n-Level 1 of these perks now multiplies the damage of fire/frost/shock spells and weapon enchantments by 1.5x instead of 1.25x. \r\n\r\n-Level 2 of these perks now multiplies the damage of fire/frost/shock spells and weapon enchantments by 2x instead of 1.5x. \r\n\r\n[b]This greatly improves the effectiveness of your spells. [/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Lastly this mod adds three new perks to the Destruction tree: Pyromage, Cryomage and Electromage.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Pyromage[/b]: Doubles the effectiveness of your Fire-based spells and allows you acess to the \\'Inferno\\' spell.\r\n\r\n[b]Cryomage[/b]: Doubles the effectiveness of your Frost-based spells and allows you acess to the \\'Tundra\\' spell.\r\n\r\n[b]Electromage[/b]: Doubles the effectiveness of your Shock-based spells and allows you acess to the \\'Electrocute\\' spell.\r\n\r\n- These perks are unique in the fact that you may only choose one of them. Once you have chosen one, the others are locked from you.\r\n\r\n- The unique spells are added directly to your spell list upon taking the perk.\r\n\r\n- The perks require you to have a destruction skill of 100 and \\'Intense Flames\\' or \\'Deep Freeze\\' or \\'Disintegrate\\' respectively.\r\n\r\n-The new spells are master level concentration spells that deal 75 base fire/frost/shock damage per second. (It will be more like 300 by the time you get the perks however).\r\n\r\n[b]These three unique perks will provide you with a method to specialize your destruction in a way not seen before.[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy! :)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso try: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=173879347]A Tragedy In Black - Enchanting Remastered[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=184398713]Pyromage[/url]: a mod which adds a bunch of new and versatile spells for your Pyromancer character.",
