  "descriptionHtml": "IMPORTANT:\r\nI\\'m not a modder and in fact this is not my own (created from 0) mod. It\\'s a moddification of some companions mod, but I don\\'t even know which one...\r\n\r\nI uploaded it because of my wife. She fell in love in Mord-Sith faction from SOT by Terry Goodkind and this is some kind of help or maybe motivation for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/74220][b]durge13[/b][/url], because she wants to speed up his work on [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12998][b]Sword of Truth Loot[/b][/url] mod.\r\n\r\nShe downloaded almost all companion mods but when she found durges mod she just must to have few Mord-Sith companions in her team, so I downloaded NPC Editor and edited one of her hundreds companion mods.\r\n\r\nI changed hairstyles and some face elements and make few correct like for example adding Nyda and Raina to Mord-Sith faction, equip them M-S armor, agiel, add some perks (like dual something) and other thing to make them more M-S like.\r\n\r\nMy wife was satisfied from effect, but it will be much mor fun if you could find those two in M-S temple and maybe add some quests for them - I can\\'t do this and this is another reason of uploading this file.\r\n\r\nAnother one is that when I made those two my wife deleted all other companion mods and now i don\\'t know which one i edited :\\\\ So our big petition for all of you is to help us find the mother mod for those, which will enable us to contact with author to talk about permission / credits and possible help.\r\n\r\nThis mod need to work:\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168][b]ApachiiSkyHair by Apachii[/b][/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12998][b]Sword of Truth Loot by Durge13[/url]\r\nI\\'ve used also [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9249][b]Improved Eyes Skyrim by missjennabee[/b][/url]\r\n\r\nYou can find Nyda in Windpeak Inn. I don\\'t know where is Raina but you can \\'summon\\' her by using console -> help Raina -> player.placeatme Raina\\'s ID.",
