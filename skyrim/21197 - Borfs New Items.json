  "summary": "A small dash of flavor. Item recipes that are based on your characters... well, character. Items that require certain criteria to be met.",
  "descriptionHtml": "========= v0.2 =============\r\n- 2 summoning spells\r\n- More crafts\r\n- A new unique item-carrying mini-boss in Blackreach\r\n===========================\r\n\r\n========== v0.1 ============\r\n- Initial release\r\n- Added new food crafts\r\n- A couple new forge crafts\r\n- 1 new summon spell\r\n- 1 new script\r\n============================\r\n\r\nThese are new items that you can craft with vanilla ingredients. However, they only become available to you after certain criteria are met (people killed, days jailed, factions joined, etc...). So, the best way to play this mod is to install it and forget about it! The rewards\r\nwill appear in the cooking pot and blacksmith forge menus over time as you achieve greatness. \r\n\r\nAdds completely new forms to the game, so there should be absolutely no conflicts with anything. I test my mods at different spots in my mods load order and haven\\'t found any conflicts with all major mods. I made this thing for the fun of it and figured others might enjoy it too, so please don\\'t judge this to the same degree as you would a super mod! Thanks for viewing, and ***be careful with the Holy Grail***.",
