  "descriptionHtml": "White and Grey Royal Elven Set re-texture by CrimsonFairy\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Description\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />This mod is a re-texture of theRoadstroker&#39;s Royal Elven Set. I originally made a purple and blue one, but I got a few requests for a white and grey set. It kinda turned out to be more white and silver than white and grey but I actually like it like that. And I actually like it better than the first re-texture I did&#33; It still needs the original mod by theRoadstroker though.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m TERRIBLE at creating screenshots, so it would be nice to see some of yours&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Note: This was requested by a few people and I only did it because I ended up liking the idea. I&#39;m not doing any more re-textures for this mod, so please don&#39;t request anything else. If there is a problem with the texture then I&#39;ll fix it but I&#39;m not going to make the texture a higher or lower quality so please don&#39;t ask.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Requirements\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Just the original mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25083/]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Install\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Extract files from archive into Skryim data folder.
