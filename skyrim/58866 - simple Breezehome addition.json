  "summary": "I changed some minor things to make Breezehome more to my liking.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I changed Breezehome to fit my liking without going overboard like some other mods i saw. It may not be immersive to have an anvil in the bedroom but i don&#39;t mind.\r<br />\r<br />This mod can cause problems with anything that modifies the Breezehome cell in any way.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds an enchantment table, anvil, workbench and grindstone to Breezehome. (removing things like chairs and cupboards in the process&#33; see images)\r<br />\r<br />Also it removes the wall in the bedroom. I placed the weapon and shield rack on the opposite wall and replaced the table with a mannequin in the bedroom.\r<br />\r<br />Everything comes with the bedroom upgrade apart from the enchantment table which comes with the loft upgrade.\r<br />\r<br />There shouldn&#39;t be any bugs with this mod it&#39;s fairly simple. Feel free to leave comments, have fun :D",
