Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I also want to thank everyone that Endorsed, downloaded, commented on, made videos of, or simply just enjoyed this mod&#33; It means a lot&#33;\r<br />And of course a big thanks to the guys in the credits&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]*******[/size][/color][/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Ever felt like you were never really revarded for defeating Alduin and saving the entire world? ...And have you always wanted a massive \r<br />player home that was both highly detailed and well integrated in to the lore? Well, then this is the mod for you.\r<br />\r<br />Located in Sovngarde, the Halls of Dovahndor is the ultimate home for the ultimate Dragonborn. \r<br />\r<br />This mod has literally hours of exploration for those who want to delve into the details and uncover every secret. There are hidden locations, \r<br />secret paths, and the Underdepths, a massive hideout for your stealthy character.\r<br />\r<br />The mod also features a unique spell, allowing you to teleport to the Halls of Dovahndor from anywhere, along with several other unique items.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />(Currently, this mod does NOT require that you defeat Alduin. Therefor I recommend that you download this mod after you have done so)\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/d5Nps.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/XtRI2.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/raFuk.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />For centuries the ruins of mysterios gate stood dorment on the peak of the Throat of the World. Few know about it&#39;s existence and even fewer has seen it. No one really knows its origins, but there are several theories. Some say it was built by an ancient civilazation in an atempt to contact the gods, while others say it was builts by the gods themselves.\r<br />\r<br />Millenia ago the dragons named the gate Monahven Miraad, or the Gate of Mother Wind in the dragon tongue. This name was later adapted by the Greybeards, who made their sancturay on the mountain centuries ago. \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/hmfon.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />With the defeat of Alduin the World Eater, a portal opened. Since then both greybeards and dragons have tried to enter the gate, but none has succeded. Now the Graybeards believe that only one can enter the portal, the hero that defeated Alduin... Dragonborn&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/XtRI2.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/][img]http://i.imgur.com/3Tbm0.png[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/XtRI2.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102495024&tscn=1359576170][img]http://i.imgur.com/FHkqLHC.png[/img][/url]\r<br />If you like this mod and want to support it, then please visit [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102495024&tscn=1359576170]Steam Workshop[/url] and Rate it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/XtRI2.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/bo7Ef.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]5eUfyLY9phs[/youtube][youtube]-avQRnkEfLk[/youtube][youtube]WVFU0ks1Lyg[/youtube][youtube]ib6Ewl0WF_Y[/youtube][youtube]QgMbXsXupsA[/youtube][youtube]jKTG9DBk46E[/youtube][youtube]Njm3FsA_99E[/youtube][youtube]CptAJTLYJ7E[/youtube][youtube]FnP7agYiB34&[/youtube][youtube]9pH5GoAP8IA[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/XtRI2.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/nYUPj.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Gate to Sovngarde:[/b]\r<br />A new map location on the Throat of the world, &#39;Monahven Miraad&#39; or the Gate of Mother Wind, and the portal to the Halls of Dovahndor in Sovngarde.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]The Halls of Dovahndor:[/b]\r<br /> On the size of an in-game city, this home is arguably one of the largest out there.

But there&#39;s a catch, they&#39;re all hidden at different locations. Some Shrines, like Zenithar&#39;s Forge and the Tree of Kynareth might be easy find. But others, like Stendarr&#39;s Peak and the Altar of Arkay, might prove a challange. Can you find all nine shrines?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Teleportation Spell:[/b]\r<br />A unique teleportation spell, that instantly teleports you to Dovahndor.
