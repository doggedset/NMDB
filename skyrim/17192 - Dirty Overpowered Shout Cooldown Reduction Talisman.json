  "summary": "For those who like to shout more often...because they are cheating cheaters.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Essentially, this mod includes a talisman with faux-lore-friendly text, but let\\'s be frank here - it\\'s cheating. The talisman does not use weapon, armor, ring or amulet slots, so all normal equipment can be equipped as well.\r\n\r\nI found it tedious to continuously run back to a Talos shrine for the blessing, especially when using immersion mods that require sleeping and eat up hours of my in-game \\\"day\\\".\r\n\r\nI also don\\'t like wearing an Amulet of Talos as it prevents me from wearing super-sexy enchanted necklaces of my own.\r\n\r\nThe gaming gods took pity on poor gamers like you and me and created - [color=red] [font=\\\"Impact\\\"] The Dragonborn Talisman [/font] [/color] *flashing lights and sound effects here*\r\nWhat does it do? Well that is entirely up to you, my friend. Depending on which version you download, you can have:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]a talisman that grants a buff equivalent to a shrine blessing OR Amulet of Talos\r\n[*]a talisman that grants a buff equivalent to both a shrine blessing AND Amulet of Talos\r\n[*]a talisman that grants a buff equivalent to both a shrine blessing AND Amulet of Talos + 20%\r\n[*]a talisman that grants a buff equivalent to both a shrine blessing AND Amulet of Talos + 40%\r\n[/list]\r\nSo, you can choose between 20%, 40%, 60% or 80% (if you REALLY want this, why not TGM and run around with The Nerf Sword??) [img] http://i975.photobucket.com/albums/ae237/kaylo7/adjusting/NerfSword.jpg [/img]\r\nThinking myself hilariously funny, I named the enchantment Loquacious Thu\\'um, but of coarse you cannot see or appreciate my poor attempt at humor in-game.\r\n\r\nThe item is automatically added to your inventory upon loading the mod, as I didn\\'t want to edit any cells (I have my load order and mod compatibility to think about here!) It also doesn\\'t use up normal equipment slots, so you can wear all your shinies as well.\r\n\r\nThis talisman uses slot 60, so is compatible with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13133] Dwemer Goggles [/url], [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12092] Cloaks of Skyrim [/url], and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16438] Bandolier - Bags and Pouches [/url]\r\n\r\nI made this in a hurry, so I probably broke something in the process. If you don\\'t receive the item or it\\'s enchantment doesn\\'t match the download description, don\\'t add it with the console and move on - berate me instead. Tell me how sloppy my work is and that I need to fix my shoddy craftsmanship. Maybe throw in something about my mother to drive it home...\r\n\r\nHappy Cheating!",
