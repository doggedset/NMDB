  "descriptionHtml": "Places a sewer grate directly to the flagon behind the homes section on the left of riften from the main gate, it helps to get into the flagon without the cistern getting in the way, there is not much to it, but it is very useful to me, \\'cause I don\\'t have the time between jobs, and using the COC command has caused CDDs for me too many times, so this is my solution, enjoy",
