  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#ffe599][size=3]What does this do?[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />This mod fixes a couple of things that got on my last nerve.\r<br />\r<br />In vanilla Bound Bow gave you normal experience. Bound Battleaxe gave you normal experience. Bound sword gave you 10x experience&#33; The first part of this mod changes its Skill Use Multiplier to 1 like the other bound weapons. I believe this was a developer mistake and I will petition to get this change into the Unofficial Skyrim Patch.\r<br />\r<br />The other part of this reduces the experience gain of the Mage Armor spells by 20-75%. In my game Alteration was increasing WAY faster then other trees and the main culprits for this were the Mage Armor spells.\r<br />\r<br />Why not just use the Uncapper? The Uncapper isn&#39;t currently capable of tweaking the experience gain of individual spells, and there really were only a few spells that were giving too much.\r<br />\r<br />This file contains no scripts and is safe to install/uninstall at any time.\r<br />There is one merged file which includes both changes and separate files with only the Bound Sword fix or only the Mage Armor reduction.\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#ffe599][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This file will conflict with mods that change the following MAGIC EFFECTS (SPELL changes are fine)\r<br />BoundSwordFFSelf\r<br />BoundSwordMysticFFSelf\r<br />ArmorFFSelf0\r<br />ArmorFFSelf25\r<br />ArmorFFSelf50\r<br />ArmorFFSelf75\r<br />ArmorFFSelf100\r<br />\r<br />As far as I know very few mods mess with the actual magic effect of these spells, so there should be few conflicts.\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#ffe599][size=3]Installation[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />Download only one file&#33; Use NMM or an equivalent mod manager to install. If you want to install manually simply extract the contents of the Data folder to your ...Skyrim/Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#ffe599][size=3]Uninstallation[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />delete the following files (if present) from your ...Skyrim/Data folder\r<br />Reduced Bound Sword and Mage Armor XP.esp\r<br />Reduced Bound Sword XP.esp\r<br />Reduced Mage Armor XP.esp\r<br />\r<br />Mage Armor Experience Multipliers\r<br />Spell              XP Mult\r<br />Oakflesh      0.3\r<br />Stoneflesh      0.25\r<br />Ironflesh      0.6\r<br />Ebonyflesh      0.8\r<br />Dragonhide      0.4\r<br />\r<br />I will consider doing compatibility patches for stable mods only. If I do they may take a while because I want to make them fit the balance of the mod in question.",
