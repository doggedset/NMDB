  "descriptionHtml": "Perkus Maximus removes any form of Smithing enhancers which made me sad, because I like to make OP weapons.\r<br />\r<br />This small mod adds:\r<br />\r<br />Amphoe&#39;s Ambrosia (Improve smithing 100%)\r<br />Amphoe&#39;s Potion (Improve smithing 50%)\r<br />Warrior - An enchantment that boosts One-Handed, Block, and Armor rating.\r<br />Ring of the Warrior - Ring with said enchantment. Use console to get the enchantment.\r<br />\r<br />I was going to make a fortify smithing enchantment but decided not to because I was lazy.\r<br />\r<br />DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY MOD AND SHOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH EVERY MOD\r<br />\r<br />Common sense for load order. Just let LOOT do it.\r<br />\r<br />Â You should probably only use this if you want to boost your smithing and have PerMa, OR if you want my OP enchantment.",
