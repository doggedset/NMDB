  "summary": "Kinda self explanitory really, but its Soi-fon, from bleach... as a follower.\r<br />that picture. is not the follower. just so you know.",
  "descriptionHtml": "look, this is the first and perhaps only mod im ever gonna upload, so imma try and keep this short.\r<br />It is soifon. she is an assassin. i am not feeling eloquent because i just typed up a nice explanitory description and upon trying to upload it, the nexus said, &#34;error for you, try again kthxbai&#34;\r<br />i made this in about an hour and a half. using ECE and the CK.\r<br />this follower has no frills.\r<br />i suggest you find and use the Sui fon armor that was put up rather recently, as it makes sense to use it if you want this follower. its here on the nexus. somewhere.\r<br />if you arent using ECE, and apachii hairs, then this prolly wont work/look right if it does work.\r<br />my version of Ysolda, from whiterun is also in here, because i accidentally made them in one file.\r<br />they are both nekkid. this is because they are obviously nudists. or i felt like it would be a hassle to clothe them.\r<br />Soi fon is not anywhere in game yet, i have yet to decide where to put her. suggestions are welcome, just not in riften. fuck riften.\r<br />i will place her somewhere eventually.\r<br />i will continue to refine this character. suggestions are welcome, also if anyone knows where to get a better hair let me know. i will change it. or you can change it. its all good.\r<br />i dont mean to offend anyone, and if i balls something up, or violate some rule, or just end up stepping on etiquette, and act like a dick, it&#39;s not intentional. i apologize and will try to fix it.\r<br />i would give screenies, but im not sure how to on bootcamp mac windows. on a macbook pro, if anyone wants to tell me, be my guest. i will try to get some up. at some point in the nearish future.\r<br />i&#39;ll prolly update this sometime soonish anyway, but i dont have anything better to do right now. so there. have fun. and as a bonus, have an interesting video...\r<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxVcgDMBU94\r<br />one of the strangest things ive seen recently, but in an amusing way.\r<br />its not skyrim related at all.\r<br />",
