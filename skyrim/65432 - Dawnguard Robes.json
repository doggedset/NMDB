  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wanted robes to join the Dawnguard as a mage, but found their armor less than satisfactory for your spell-slinging needs? Look no further&#33; This mod adds a full set of enchanted Dawnguard robes for both male and female, beast races included. \r<br />\r<br />Adds robes, boots, a hood, and a pair of gloves&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Requires Dawnguard.\r<br />\r<br />A full set of enchanted robes can be found in Fort Dawnguard, in the alchemy/enchanting area. A full, unenchanted set can be crafted at a tanning rack with various combinations of linen wraps and leather strips.\r<br />\r<br />ENCHANTED SET - ENCHANTMENTS:\r<br />\r<br />[i]Hood: Increases your Magicka by 30 points [/i](The last thing you need is to be caught low on Magicka when fighting packs of blood-starved vampires.)\r<br />[i]Robes: +100% Magicka regen, restoration spells cost 17% less to cast[/i] (Ditto - these are similar to robes you can get at the College of Winterhold.)\r<br />[i]Boots: Sneaking is 25% better[/i] (Discretion is the better part of valor, and it&#39;s also the better part of not getting your neck chomped while you&#39;re crawling around underground without wearing armor.)\r<br />[i]Gloves: Restoration spells cost 15% less to cast[/i] (Same reasoning as the first two.)\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Extract contents of DawnguardRobesFull.zip, and copy them into your Skyrim/Data directory.\r<br />\r<br />GOING FROM 1.0 (no unenchanted set) to 1.1 (adds an unenchanted set):\r<br />\r<br />All you need to do is grab the &#34;DawnguardRobesV1 to V1-1&#34; file, and overwrite the &#34;Dawnguard Robes.esp&#34; in your Data folder with the new one from that file.\r<br />\r<br />CURRENT ISSUES:\r<br />\r<br />For some reason, I had issues applying the textureset to the female 1st person arms (basically means that light affects them weirdly - they&#39;re always dark and really shiny). I did a half fix for this, letting it default the female 1st person arms for this robe to the male 1st person arms. The difference isn&#39;t extremely obvious, and the mod functions perfectly well, but if someone knows a fix for this, I would be much obliged.",
