  "descriptionHtml": "Hello, everyone, SikSikSikki here, bringing you the Sik Companions Pack vol.1!\r\n\r\nIncluded are 9 new companions, some being faction related, all lore-friendly. Every character has names that are unique, yet still fit within their own race, as well as classes that fit well within lore!\r\n\r\nThe pack was made with the big companion overhauls in mind (especially Goulig, who can then use his 1H experience to duel-wield), such as UFO and the such and should very much be compatible with them (I use UFO personally, and they work fine together). That being said, they are not required and can be executed alongside vanilla Skyrim only if one wishes.\r\n\r\n**There seems to be a problem with some of the companions preferring fists over steel, and just as well Quorellius really doesn\\'t seem to want to play with the Dovahkiin. Trying to fix this**\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nValja Heaven-Sent\r\nLocation: The Bannered Mare in Whiterun.\r\nClass: Warrior (2h Specialist)\r\nRace: Nord\r\n\r\nFÃ¶rtegen Magic-Blood\r\nLocation: The Frozen Hearth in Winterhold.\r\nClass: Wizard (Destruction Specialist)\r\nRace: Imperial\r\n\r\nGoulig Yar-Grash\r\nLocation: Narzulbur in Eastern Skyrim (near Kynesgrove)\r\nClass: Berserker (1H Specialist)\r\nRace: Orc\r\n(is a member of the Narzulbur community)\r\n\r\nAldrimer Sniketyv\r\nLocation: The Ragged Flagon, beneath Riften.\r\nClass: Thief (1H specific)\r\nRace: Dunmer\r\n(Is a member of the Theives Guild)\r\n\r\nGal\\'ning of the Shadow\r\nLocation: The Ragged Flagon, beneath Riften.\r\nClass: Assassin (1H specific)\r\nRace: Khajiit\r\n(Is a member of the Dark Brotherhood)\r\n\r\nVierra Toulmyth\r\nLocation: The Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood.\r\nClass: Hunter (Missile, or Archer)\r\nRace: Breton\r\n\r\nAnarial Rahzen\r\nLocation: The Frostfruit Inn, Rorikstead.\r\nClass: Warrior (1H specialist)\r\nRace: Redguard\r\n\r\nQuorellius Vyral:\r\nLocation: Understone Keep, Markarth.\r\nClass: Spellblade\r\nRace: High-Elf\r\n(is definitely a member of the Thalmor, may not play well with Stormcloaks)\r\n\r\nTurns-The-Tides:\r\nLocation: Four Shields Tavern, Dragonbridge\r\nClass: Warrior (2h)\r\nRace: Argonian\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n3.0 Final - Gal\\'ning\\'s leveling fixed.\r\n\r\n2.5 - Aldrimer and Gal\\'nings punch everything, fixed.
