  "descriptionHtml": "Okay, lets give this a try. This is my very first mod. I never did any modding before so I have no idea if everything is going to work as I intended.\r\nI did this housemod because I couldn\\'t really find a playerhome I liked.\r\nPlease pm if anything seems weird or not working or if you have any tips how I could improve this mod. \r\n\r\nI think the water sound is too loud and I want to get the valve to turn on the shower but I havent figured that out yet.\r\n\r\nI hope you have fun trying it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is Ygrinheim.\r\n\r\nIt is a small farmhouse close to Whiterun (near the destroyed Watchtower), you should see the marker on the map. But be careful, a hagraven will be waiting for you. You have to find Sennas body and loot her to get the house key. The key to the small locked room in the house is in the strongbox next to the bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis house offers:\r\n\r\none double bed\r\none single bed\r\n4 bookshelves\r\n8 Weapon/Shield racks/plaques\r\nalchemy/enchanting table in the basement\r\nforge crafting outside\r\na bathroom\r\na small treasure storeroom\r\n\r\nall the containers/barrels should be save \r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to \r\nBlary (Book Sets/Potion Set/ Food Containers)\r\nEldiabs (Book shelves/ Weapon racks/plaques)\r\nIthlia (Pillows/ Perfume)\r\nDarkrder (Paintings)\r\nOaristys& Tony67 (Diner Sets/ Baskets of Apples/ Scrolls/ Jars/ Dishes)\r\n",
