INFORMATION ON THE MOD           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod places a cart for fast travel in each hold capital that doesn\\'t already have \r\none.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod is for people who like to role-play, and feel that fast traveling is unrealistic \r\nunless there is an in-game reason that it can happen.  (Like if there is a carriage that you can pay \r\nto ride.)  This mod adds four carriages to the four hold capitals that did not originally have them.  \r\nSo now you can travel by carriage to and from all nine of the major towns in Skyrim, and can travel \r\none-way to six small settlements.\r\n\r\n\t   The hold capitals that were missing carriage service in the base game:\r\n\r\nDawnstar\r\nFalkreath\r\nMorthal\r\nWinterhold\r\n\r\n\t   In addition to taking you to the hold capitals, the carriages can take you to these small \r\nsettlements, although you cannot hire a carriage at these locations:\r\n\r\nDragon Bridge\r\nIvarstead\r\nKarthwasten\r\nRiverwood\r\nRorikstead\r\nShor\\'s Stone\r\n\r\n\t   The carriage drivers use voiced dialog from the original game and function just like the\r\noriginal drivers at the towns that already had them.\r\n\r\n\t   The NavMeshes have been edited so that actors will walk out around the new carriages \r\ninstead of bumping into them and getting stuck walking against them.\r\n\r\n\t   This is InAComaDial999\\'s attempt to get this mod working after David Brasher abandoned it.  \r\nReally, all credit should go to him, I just modified one script and repackaged it all. \r\n\r\n\t   So if you don\\'t like unexplained fast travel that feels like cheating, then this may be \r\na good mod for you.  It will make traveling between towns faster and easier, but still let you walk\r\nto and from locations that are in the middle of nowhere.\t   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n2. Installation                           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   If you were using an older version of the mod and updating, you will need to install the \r\nloose files from the \\\"Alternate Loose Files Installation\\\" version rather than using the .bsa.  \r\nOr else you could use the .bsa file and go delete the script carriagesystemscript.pex from your \r\nscripts directory.  The reason why you must do one of these things is that loose files override .bsa \r\nfiles.  There is a problem with script carriagesystemscript.pex in the old versions, and you need to \r\nremove that script for the .bsa to work, or else install the good version of that script by doing the \r\nalternate loose files installation. \r\n\r\n           Extract (decompress) the .esp and .bsa file to your Skyrim directory.  \r\n(It will be something like *Installation directory*\\\\Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data)\r\nMark the box next to the \\\"Cart in Each Big Town\\\" plugin in your mod manager.\r\n \r\n           Alternately, extract someplace else.  Then move the .esp and .bsa file to Skyrim\\\\Data.  \r\nMark the box next to the plugin in your mod manager.\r\n\r\n\t   Place this mod in your load order after the Unofficial Patch if you use it, otherwise the \r\npatch will break the traveling to small towns added by this mod.\r\n************************************************************************\r\n3. Version History    \r\n************************************************************************\r\nV 1.8  7/23/12  Added face-gen data for the new carriage drivers.\r\n\r\nV 1.7  5/10/12  The Rorikstead-Riverview error came back.  (Don\\'t ask me how.)  Fixed it again.\r\n\r\nV 1.6  5/1/12   Made it so you can be overencumbered and still fast travel by carriage. \r\n\r\nV 1.5  2/16/12  Fixed Rorikstead-Riverview error in 1.4 and modcleaned it.\r\n\r\nV 1.4  2/16/12  Travel to small towns added by InAComaDial999.  Abandoned use of BSA archive.\r\n\r\nV 1.3  2/15/12  Removed travel to small towns due to BSA packaging issues.\r\n\r\nV 1.2  2/14/12  Identical to the incorrectly packaged version 1.1.  The packaging error broke travel\r\n\t\tto the small settlements.\r\nV 1.1  2/13/12  Added carriage service to six small settlements.  Attempted to fix a rare big where \r\n\t\ta horse can stand beside the cart instead of where it belongs.\r\nV 1.0  2/8/12   Initial release.   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n4. Conflicts, Known Issues, and Troubleshooting\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   The pricing is a bit erratic.  I am not sure how to predict when it will cost 50 Septims \r\nand when it will cost 20 Septims to travel between hold capitals.  The price to travel to a small\r\nsettlement is pegged at 20 Septims.\r\n\r\n\t   The carriage drivers added by this mod have lore topics for nearby towns, not the \r\ntowns they are in.  The vanilla Skyrim voice acting was not done for the four towns, so it can not\r\nbe included in this mod.\r\n\r\n\t   The new carriages are not disabled and enabled in synch with the civil war quests.  So \r\na carriage could be present during a battle.  Oh well.  Civilians do sometimes find themselves in \r\nbattle zones.  \t    \r\n************************************************************************\r\n5.
