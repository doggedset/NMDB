  "summary": "Steinthorr is a former Imperial soldier who has taken to encamping himself on the ridge just opposite of the Imperial Camp in the Pale Hold of Skyrim. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Steinthorr is honorable, stern, and at times very outspoken on his view of the civil war that is going on in Skyrim. He is in all senses of the term a nord imperial soldier. His hatred of the Thalmor, and those allied with them will become apparent within a short time-frame. \r\n This mod is to add this former Imperial soldier as a dynamic follower to the game. \r\nAdditionally, I did voice this character myself with a quality microphone, and the recording software in the CreationKit.   \r\n Note: This is only v.1.0, and in future updates more content will be added including, but not limited to: Steinthorr\\'s brother, who is a guard in Whiterun. \r\n== Little fact about the name Steinthorr: It is a conjunctive of the two names Stein (stone) and Thor (thunder) in the Norwegian tongue. ==\r\n Lastly, please give any feedback that will be helpful in making this NPC/Follower mod the best it can be.
