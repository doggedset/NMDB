  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4]BIOGRAPHY\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]Miraak is the primary antagonist of The Elder Scrolls V: Dragonborn, the first of all known Dragonborns (according to himself, the locals of Solstheim, and Hermaeus Mora) and a dragon priest.  Miraak is a very arrogant and rash individual, believing that his Dragonborn heritage sets him above his former dragon masters. Upon meeting the Last Dragonborn, he can claim that, (unless the main questline has been completed, in which case Miraak will grudgingly state admiration for the Dragonborn) compared to him, they have only killed a &#34;few dragons&#34; and do not yet know the true power of a Dragonborn, such as himself. He also believes himself above the servitude of Hermaeus Mora. Miraak is also a being that desires power, willing in the past to bind himself in servitude to Hermaeus Mora in order to gain forbidden knowledge and power.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]Despite, or perhaps due to, his arrogance, Miraak is shown to be a very powerful individual as he was not only able to defy the Dragons he served but he was also able to devour many of them before his defeat as a total of twenty-one different Dragon skeletons can be found both around and within his temple.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]Miraak proves to be fiercely independent and seems to be motivated solely by his lust for power. This can be seen not only through his initial betrayal of the Dragons at the height of their power, but also through his resistance to the effects of Apocrypha as it is said that all those who venture there become prisoners of their own thirst for knowledge and are unable to leave, whereas Miraak appeared unaffected.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]During his final battle with the Dragonborn, he claims that Hakon and the other ancient Nord heroes wished to use him to slay Alduin, but he chose not to for his own reasons. However, should Alduin have already been defeated upon meeting him, he will claim that he could have killed the World-Eater himself, a further sign of his arrogant nature.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][img]https://s4.postimg.io/6qe73finx/image.jpg[/img][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ffd966]Miraak Slot 9[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=3]For Racemenu users you can try to import the FaceGen[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=5]Requirements:\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]SKSE[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://skse.silverlock.org/[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Enhanced Character Edit by ECE team [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12951/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]The Eyes Of Beauty by Gabriel Mailhot as LogRaam [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]ApachiiSkyHair by Apachii [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]ECEE - RANs Enhanced Character Edit Enhancer by RAN46  [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35713/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=5]Recommended (Optional):[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Player Voicesets by ChizFoShiz [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51387/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Combat Music - Rock and Classic RPG by Lipe [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74072/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]XP32 Maximum Skeleton - XPMS by xp32 [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26800/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]SkySight Skins - Ultra HD 4K and 2K - Male Textures and Real Feet Meshes by fadingsignal [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58443/?[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=3]Download manually and extract the slot file to your Documents/My Games/Skyrim/CME_save[/size]\r<br />[size=3]Start Skyrim and go into the character creation menu. [/size]\r<br />[size=3]Load slot number, Slot 15. [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]JsRueTzug-M[/youtube][/center]",
