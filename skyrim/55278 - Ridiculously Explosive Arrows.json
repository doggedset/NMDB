Or maybe some that open a rift in the space-time continuum?\r<br />\r<br />How about a fork with the power of a Fus Ro Dah?  Or maybe just something to finally wipe that smirk off Nazeem&#39;s face for good?\r<br />\r<br />This is the mod for you.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is my fifteenth or sixteenth mod, but my first time uploading to Nexus, so let me know if I did anything wrong.  This mod already has over 3,500 subscriptions on Steam, but I figured even more people will get a chance to, well, destroy everyone if I uploaded to Nexus as well.  Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Steam Workshop Version:\r<br />\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=272199093\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />What this mod does is adds nine new types of magical arrows, the Fus Roh Bow, a not-so-magical bow, edible battleaxes, and two extremely overpowered dining utensils.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-==== Arrows ====-\r<br />\r<br />Explosive Arrow - Goes boom.\r<br />\r<br />Very Dangerous Arrow - Very large boom.  Will launch NPCs flying.\r<br />\r<br />Senselessly Violent Arrow - When you really want someone gone.\r<br />\r<br />ICBM - Will most definitely make people get gone.  Along with their hometown.\r<br />\r<br />Gravity-defying ICBM - Because why the hell not.\r<br />\r<br />Painstakingly Slow Gravity-Defying ICBM - Gives you time to run.\r<br />\r<br />Time-warp Beam - Opens up a rift in space-time.  It kills stuff too.\r<br />\r<br />Fairly Sharp Arrow - How much damage?  Over 9000&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Actually Dangerous Time-warp Beam - Ten times the damage, ten times the fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-==== Weapons ====-\r<br />\r<br />Fast bow - No longer known for it&#39;s length, your standard stick with a string now allows you to dispense chaos faster.\r<br />\r<br />Shiv of Mass Destruction - It&#39;s back.  Kills stuff dead.  And sends them far far away.\r<br />\r<br />The Tines of Power - Pretty much the same as the shiv.  Only more powerful.  And it&#39;s a fork.\r<br />\r<br />Horseless Headless Horseman&#39;s Headtaker - Pretty much yeah.\r<br />\r<br />Fus Roh Bow - A bow with the power to... you know what a Fus Ro Dah does.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-==== Food And Stuff ====-\r<br />\r<br />Edible Battleaxes - Get 300% of your daily orichalcum&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Cyanide Flavored Bread - I like to live life dangerously.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-==== Disclaimer ====-\r<br />\r<br />Not lore friendly.  Probably.  That is all.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-==== Requirements ====-\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />The guts to click &#34;Subscribe&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-==== Incompatibility ====-\r<br />\r<br />None that I know of.  Possibly incompatible if it changes the area immediately around Warmaiden&#39;s.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-==== More Awesome Stuff ====-\r<br />\r<br />Learn to Fly\r<br />[url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=267025231[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Teleportation Spellbooks\r<br />[url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=251054733[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Lakeview Manor Expansion\r<br />[url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=261946753[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Sniper&#39;s Crossbows\r<br />[url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=263121743[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-==== Update Log ====-\r<br />\r<br />1.0 - Original\r<br />\r<br />2.0 - Added edible battleaxes, more arrows, more bows, cyanide flavored bread, TF2 references, more fun, removed Herobrine.\r<br />\r<br />2.1 - Added a third care package with additional ammo, the Actually Dangerous Time-warp Beams, and locked chests to keep out nosy guards.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-==== Suggestions for Maximum Awesome ====-\r<br />\r<br />- Make a save or two before you go on a killing spree.  Ironically though, you could come into quite a few inheritances if you don&#39;t.\r<br />\r<br />- Use in tandem with Teleportation Spells to get in and out really fast *poof* &#34;What are you doing here milk-drinker?&#34; *shoots arrow and disappears* &#34;Aww snap...&#34;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Links:\r<br />\r<br />Dawnguard Infiltrator Expansion\r<br />[url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=263971922[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Outside the Box&#34; Expansion\r<br />[url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=270225219[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-==== FAQ ====-\r<br />\r<br />Where is all this stuff you&#39;re talking about?\r<br />\r<br />In a new chest immediately beside Warmaiden&#39;s, on the side next to Breezehome\r<br />\r<br />Stuff from the update is in a second chest right next to it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Why do all the arrows have &#34;EA&#34; in front of their name?\r<br />\r<br />It stands for &#34;Explosive Arrows&#34;.  It&#39;s there mostly to keep everything conveniently organized and pretty in your meticulously organized inventory ;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Is this mod particularly useful?\r<br />\r<br />NO&#33;  The point isn&#39;t to be useful, it&#39;s to be fun.  That&#39;s the point of video games, in my humble opinion.  Not for achievements and glory in a false world, but fun.  More power to you if you can manage to get something accomplished with an ICBM though.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Are there any particular reasons I should get this?\r<br />\r<br />Well, if you&#39;re looking for specifics... If a guard takes a mildly explosive arrow to the knee he won&#39;t be up for Haelga&#39;s Bunkhouse anymore... I&#39;ll leave any more terrible (read: good) ideas up to you to come up with.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Can the arrows be crafted?\r<br />\r<br />That may be added in an update.  But honestly, you get 1000 of each type of arrow.  I really hope for your sake that you won&#39;t need more than that.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Is this mod dangerous?\r<br />\r<br />To you, no.  You&#39;re the Dovahkiin, you do what you want.  To everyone else...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Some people wanted to know how much damage the explosions do.  So here they are:\r<br /> I put the last digits in parentheses because I don&#39;t believe it lets you have 4 digit damage :(\r<br />\r<br />Explosive Arrow - 50\r<br />Very Dangerous Arrow - 100\r<br />Senselessly Violent Arrow - 150\r<br />ICBM - 100(0)\r<br />Gravity-defying ICBM - 100(0)\r<br />Painstakingly Slow Gravity-Defying ICBM - 100(0)\r<br />Time-warp Beam - 100(0)\r<br />Fairly Sharp Arrow - 999(9) \r<br />Actually Dangerous Time-warp Beam - 999(9)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />For everyone who can&#39;t find it, let me repeat myself:\r<br />\r<br />Where is all this stuff you&#39;re talking about?\r<br />\r<br />In a new chest immediately beside Warmaiden&#39;s, on the side next to Breezehome\r<br />\r<br />Stuff from the update is in a second chest right next to it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Have fun&#33;",
