  "descriptionHtml": "I made this mod as a request, so if it doesn\\'t seem \\\"balanced\\\" to some people, that\\'s because it isn\\'t supposed to be.This mod changes the haggling perk in the speechcraft tree to only have 1 rank instead of 5, while at the same time increasing the bonus of rank 1 from vanilla\\'s crappy 10%, up to 60%. Enjoy.\r\n\r\nThis mod probably won\\'t be compatible with any other mod that changes the haggling perk, but I don\\'t think there are too many of those.",
