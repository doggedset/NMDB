  "descriptionHtml": "So first of all, thanks alot L0rd0fwar, really helped us out. Now skyrim looks so much nicer. \r\n\r\n----- Dont download if you dont own Witcher 2 and Dragon age 2----\r\n\r\nI wasnt too happy with his replacements and the textures of the armors. So here\\'s what I\\'ve done:\r\n\r\nLeather armor -> Iorveth MALE ONLY why? I thought I looked rough and cool, it fitted the leather great imo. What have I done? Tweaked colors, changed the badges to skyrim symbols.\r\n\r\nNordplate armor -> DA2 warden armor why? Plated metal armor? Couldnt be anything else :P What have I done? Removed the stupid yellow things, removed chainmail (it was too much metal imo) and added some red details.\r\n\r\nThieves guild -> Geralt MALE ONLY why? Looked very fitting, a little bit nicer than the old ones, so they can blend in more easily. What have I done? Tweaked colors, removed fancy stripes on the pants.\r\n\r\nWolf armor -> Mage Hawk Champion MALE ONLY Why? I thought it looed fearsome and really fitting the werewolf theme with the fur and the spiky armor. What have I done? Tweaked colors, added blue details. ",
