  "descriptionHtml": "Ever feel like some of the artifacts in Skyrim can&#39;t match regular enchanted gear late-game? This file aims to fix that, at least for Wuuthrad. Now, in addition to its standard Elf damage bonus, it saps health and stamina from the target. Its base attributes have also been modified, giving it higher stagger, increasing its attack speed slightly, lowering its reach slightly, and making it heavier.",
