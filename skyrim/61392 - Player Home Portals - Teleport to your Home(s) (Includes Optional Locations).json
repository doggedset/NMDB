  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff0000][size=5]MrDanSG1&#39;s Player Home Portals - Version 1.2[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Due to my characters usually owning all the vanilla player houses and storing different items in each house, it became quite a chore to transport goods between each of them. As I am a mage 90% of the time, I designed five spells to teleport my character to the respective houses. They were designed purely for personal use but I thought I would offer it out to the community as they have proven rather useful for my own game. I realize there are more advanced teleportation spells out there but I would like to make this a one stop shop for all the key home locations in the game and many more besides. Having esp&#39;s that can be mixed and matched will allow you to customize the mod to your liking. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=5]What The Mod Does [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Firstly do not let the amount of files put you off, they are all very small and are designed to compliment one another without penalizing people for not owning certain DLC&#39;s. Please take the time to choose the right files to suit your individual preference. Each spell will teleport you to an interior location; thereby reducing load time.\r<br />\r<br />The mod currently presents four main esp files:\r<br />\r<br />PHP - Vanilla Houses; Spells \r<br />PHP - Vanilla Houses; Lesser Powers \r<br />\r<br />PHP - Hearthfire Homes; Spells \r<br />PHP - Hearthfire Homes; Lesser Powers \r<br />\r<br />The spells will appear in your magic/powers menu like this:\r<br />\r<br />PHP - VANILLA HOUSES:            \r<br />Portal to Breezehome        \r<br />Portal to Hjerim            \r<br />Portal to Honeyside            \r<br />Portal to Proudspire Manor                \r<br />Portal to Vlindrel Hall\r<br />\r<br />PHP - HEARTHFIRE HOMES:\r<br />Portal to Heljarchen Hall\r<br />Portal to Lakeview Manor\r<br />Portal to Windstad Manor\r<br />\r<br />Each file contains a simple esp that adds a spell tome in each of the stated player houses. These tomes teach your character either the spell or the \r<br />lesser power depending on which version you choose and will teleport you to the inside entrance of the stated location. Take care to choose the right files. If your character does not use magic then you will want to download the lesser power versions. vice-versa, if you are a mage you will want to download just the spell versions\r<br />\r<br />Please be aware I have placed the books within the houses on purpose, you still need to buy  the house and Furniture in the normal manner. In the case of the Hearthfire homes; they need to be partially built in order to see the relevant tomes.\r<br />\r<br />All spells are scripted to allow followers to be transported with you. This has been fully tested and works just fine. For sorting purposes all spells are in \r<br />the novice alteration category and are organised with the &#39;Portal to *****&#39; to appear alphabetically in the menu. The lesser Powers are likewise sorted. All spells have a cost of 12 magicka to use (this may vary race to race) and they take 1.5 seconds to cast. Lesser powers are exactly the same without the charge time and can be used an unlimited number of times. You have my apologies if you wanted the magicka cost/charge time differently, but I am working on a MCM menu to configure these figures.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=5]Update - 20/12/14 [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />There is now two new esp&#39;s named:\r<br />\r<br />&#39;PHP - Guilds and High Hrothgar; Spells&#39;\r<br />&#39;PHP - Guilds and High Hrothgar; Lesser Powers&#39;\r<br />\r<br />I realized that quite a lot of players count the four main vanilla guild bases as &#39;homes&#39; so I included a spell/lesser power version. High Hrothgar was\r<br />included purely for convenience. These spells/lesser powers will teleport you to the stated locations below.  Each tome is located in the relevant location e.g. Portal to Arch-Mage Quarters is in (you guessed it&#33;) the Arch-Mage Quarters&#33; Locations have still been added to the images section on the mod page on the nexus website.\r<br />\r<br />The spells will appear in your magic/powers menu like this:\r<br />\r<br />PHP - GUILDS AND HIGH HROTHGAR:\r<br />Portal to Arch-Mage Quarters\r<br />Portal to Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary\r<br />Portal to High Hrothgar\r<br />Portal to Jorrvaskr\r<br />Portal to Thieves Guild\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=5]Update - 21/12/2014 [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />There is now a further two optional esp files named:\r<br />\r<br />&#39;PHP - Inns & Holds; Spells&#39;\r<br />&#39;PHP - Inns & Holds; Lesser Powers&#39;\r<br />\r<br />These two files offer the character the option to teleport to every major hold in the game as well as every vanilla inn. Several of my characters have home bases in certain inns and I am sure other players do the same. This is what led me to create this update. There are only two exceptions to the inns that can be traveled to. The first being &#39;The Retching Netch&#39;, this is due to it being a Dragonborn DLC location and I do not want to force you to \r<br />own the DLC for the sake of teleporting to one inn. The other exception is the &#39;The Stumbling Sabrecat&#39;. This is because the inn has been attacked by bandits and it offers no services, I therefore did not offer it as an option to teleport to.\r<br />\r<br />The spells will appear in your magic/powers menu like this:\r<br />\r<br />PHP - INNS & HOLDS\r<br />Portal to Braidwood Inn\r<br />Portal to Candlehearth Hall\r<br />Portal to Dawnstar\r<br />Portal to Dead Man&#39;s Drink\r<br />Portal to Falkreath\r<br />Portal to Four Shields Tavern\r<br />Portal to Frostfruit Inn\r<br />Portal to Markarth\r<br />Portal to Morthal\r<br />Portal to Moorside Inn\r<br />Portal to New Gnisis Cornerclub\r<br />Portal to Nightgate Inn\r<br />Portal to Old Hroldan Inn\r<br />Portal to Riften\r<br />Portal to Silver-Blood Inn\r<br />Portal to Sleeping Giant Inn\r<br />Portal to Solitude\r<br />Portal to The Bannered Mare \r<br />Portal to The Bee and Barb\r<br />Portal to The Drunken Huntsman\r<br />Portal to The Frozen Hearth\r<br />Portal to The Winking Skeever\r<br />Portal to Vilemyr Inn\r<br />Portal to Whiterun\r<br />Portal to Windhelm\r<br />Portal to Windpeak Inn\r<br />Portal to Winterhold\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=5]\r<br />Update - 13/01/2015[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />In version 1.2 I made some changes to the way the files are packaged. Now within every archive you will find two esp&#39;s. The spell version & Lesser power version of a particular type e.g. PHP - Vanilla Homes will contain the spell version and the lesser power version of the esp along with the scripts. Please make sure on installation that only one of the esp&#39;s are active&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This update introduced Dawngaurd locations to the mod. Locations added:\r<br />\r<br />Portal to Fort Dawngaurd\r<br />Portal to Castle Volkihar\r<br />\r<br />Tomes can be found within the specified location (check the images section on Skyrim Nexus)\r<br />\r<br />This update also introduced a Legendary Edition file that has every individual esp merged together into one. If you do not want this the other files will remain on the site as optional ones.\r<br />[color=#0000ff]\r<br />[size=5]Tome Locations[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />You will be able to find the relevant spell/lesser power tome in the house it is relevant to e.g. Portal to Breezehome will be found on the desk in Breezehome. All tomes are placed in very obvious locations. All locations are still uploaded as screen shots in the images section on the mod&#39;s nexus page. This applies to the Dawngaurd spells/powers also.\r<br />\r<br />Because of the way the Hearthfire Homes start off you may not see the tomes straight away. Once you have a basic house built then the tomes will appear on the floor right where you enter.\r<br />\r<br />The only exception to this is the &#39;Inns & Holds&#39; file. Because there are a lot more spells/lesser powers on offer, I have put them in a custom chest \r<br />located near the roof of the guard house in Whiterun (on the left just as you enter, reachable by steps). The chest is named &#39;PHP - Inns & Holds&#39;. Check the images section for a screen shot of the chest&#39;s location. This file is in a chest so you can quickly choose the spells you want. I would still recommend visiting all the inns/holds first to avoid breaking immersion, this is your choice however.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff]***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />Just a quick note here for new players, you cannot buy Hjerim until the conclusion of the Civil War Quest-line. For most players this is usually near the\r<br />end of the game as it has several consequences which I will not mention for obvious reasons. Apologies to the  seasoned Skyrim player for stating this.\r<br />[color=#0000ff]***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]Installing The Mod  [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Manually:\r<br />\r<br />1) Choose either the spell or lesser power version esp and drag and drop it into the Skyrim Data folder (do not install both)\r<br />2) Drag and drop the scripts folder into the Skyrim Data Folder \r<br />\r<br />Mod Organizer:\r<br />1) Install using Nexus Mod Manager (NMM) or Mod Organizer.  \r<br />2) Before you start playing please ensure that only one of the two esp&#39;s are selected   \r<br />\r<br />I would highly recommend the second option for beginners unless you know what you are doing. Using Mod Organizer makes it incredibly easy as installing it manually allows you to only select the esp you want to use.\r<br />\r<br />Note - please make sure the scripts are installed correctly, the spells will not function without them.                                                                     \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]Mod Requirements [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />All the files require the latest version of the Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) to be downloaded and installed.\r<br />\r<br />The only other files that has an extra requirement is the &#39;PHP - Hearthfire; Spells.esp&#39; and &#39;PHP - Hearthfire; Lesser Powers.esp&#39;. These files naturally \r<br />require you to own and have installed the Hearthfires DLC.\r<br />\r<br />Update 1.2 introduced Dawngaurd files, this naturally requires you to install the DLC\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]Known Conflicts [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />+ Any mod that changes or edits any of the player houses may lead to the spell tome books not appearing in the right places or maybe not at all.\r<br />\r<br />+ Teleporting away from any scripted events in-game will either lead to a CTD or damaging your save(s) beyond repair, you have been warned&#33;\r<br />   I cannot accept any responsibility should this happen to you. \r<br />\r<br />+ This is very minor but it is worth mentioning all the same; just be aware on teleportation that the game does not auto-save.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]Copyright[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />If other authors would like to use any of my files in their work please feel free to contact me (I&#39;m a nice guy, honestly&#33;) Otherwise please don&#39;t upload this mod to other sites or re-upload it here without permission.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]Plans For The Mod Going Forward[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />There are other aspects I would like to improve on in the next version and other optional files, including:\r<br />\r<br />+ A recall spell that will allow you to teleport back to the previous location where you cast the portal spell.\r<br />\r<br />+ Custom casting effects, sounds and actually a portal you can step through. Any help with that  would be appreciated.\r<br />\r<br />+ A customizable MCM to alter casting times and magicka cost to suit player preference. I realize it can be rather immersion \r<br />breaking to teleport away from a fight for example.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]My Other Mods[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4][size=2]Modder Display Compendium - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62732/?\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color]A modders resource containing a collection of custom built displays that can be easily inserted into your own mods\r<br />\r<br />Downreach Reborn - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61780/?\r<br />\r<br />A unique player home for storage and displaying all the unique items found in Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />",
