  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]Description[/size]\r<br />\r<br />I modded Oblivion for several years, and my favorite body was the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/42185/?]DMRA (Double Melons Round Ass) body[/url], most of my mods were conversions of outfits to fit that body. Skyrim of course has brought us Bodyslide, which automates much of that process.\r<br />\r<br />I created this new preset based on the Oblivion DMRA body. It ranges from smaller than DMRA at it 0 weight, to notably larger at 100. Oblivion style DMRA can be found right around 70~75% weight.\r<br />\r<br />For Details on the character, textures and outfits used in these screenshots please see [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71551?]Calina RaceMenu Preset[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Installation\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/b]Unzip the file and drop into your Skyrim/Data folder. Or install using whatever mod-manager you prefer. Should work fine with Mod Organizer and Nexus Mod Manager. Wrye Bash BAIN won&#39;t like it because it doesn&#39;t contained recognized file paths, but if you use BAIN with Bodyslide you presumably know your way around that issue\r<br />\r<br />After installing, open up Bodyslide and select &#34;DMRA Enhanced&#34; from the Preset dropdown. Rebuild your body and clothing meshes. Should work with both CBBE and Unified UNP bodies.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Uninstallation\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/size]Remove &#34;DMRA Enhanced.xml&#34; from this path:\r<br />Skyrim&#92;data&#92;Caliented Tools&#92;Bodyslide&#92;SliderPresets\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]History\r<br />\r<br />[/b][size=2]11/24/2015 - 1.0 - Initial Release\r<br />11/26/2015 - 1.1 - Fixed typo in the folder structure\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Credits[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Bodyslide - Caliente\r<br />UNP Body - dimon99\r<br />Unified UNP Body - [/size][/size]BringtheNoise\r<br />DMRA Body - Mktsang, Alexscorpion, HellKnight, Speedbuster, Edhildil, Coronerra, nabernas\r<br />Dark0ne and Nexusmods Staff\r<br />Bethesda",
