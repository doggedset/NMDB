Not a big mod, hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n~You will know her by the pickaxe on her belt~\r\n\r\n*Ingrid is voiced by my wife =)\r\n\r\nI posted the following in the attached discussion:\r\n\\\"So, I\\'ve looked into it, and I haven\\'t found a way (yet) to duplicate the player\\'s model. In the mean time, I am working to add more sculptures for Ingrid to carve! The other options will unlock once you\\'ve completed a large side-quest (i.e. become Arch-mage, join the Nightengales, become Harbinger of the Companions)\r\n\r\nI don\\'t have an ETA, but just thought I should let everyone know what\\'s up!\\\"",
