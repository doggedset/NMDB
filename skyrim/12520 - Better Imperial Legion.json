  "summary": "I thought their equipment was somehow weird. Why the hell do archers use shields??? And why do the Generals use the norma heavy armor instead of the Generals Armor?? I changed it!\r\n\r\nSorry, this changes the names of the soldiers to their German names. Will try to get some time to fix it...",
  "descriptionHtml": "ATTENTION: This mod isn\\'t supported by me anymore.  There won\\'t be updates, nothing... I wanted to do a real overhaul for the imperial side, but It\\'s not possible with only NPC Editor. I have the CK but it\\'s not working on my computer and TESVSnip should cause problems, I heard.\r\n\r\nFirst of all: I don´t think this could really be called a mod. I used two idiotproof programms to make it. Anybody could make this, but downloading this saves much time ;)\r\n\r\nI´ll do the same for stormcloaks soon, so it gets balanced again.\r\n\r\nChanges to Imperial Courier: Should now ALWAYS use the lightest imperial armor instead of changing between studded and light.\r\nChanges to Imperial Legate: No bow and arrows and improved stats for heavy armor and one-handed\r\nChanges to Imperial General: No bow and arrows and using General Tullius´ armor\r\nChanges to Imperial Soldier: Wears heavy armor\r\nChanges to imperial Archer: Does always wear studded armor and doesn´t use a shield anymore.\r\nHis light armor and archeryskills have been increased\r\nHadvar: He´s now wearing heavy armor from the beginning. He doesn´t wear a helmet, but I guess he will if you join the Legion after siding with him when escaping Helgen, because his inventory gets reset I gess.\r\n\r\nnew 1.1: General Tullius won´t use a bow now. I thought a General shouldn´t be an archer.\r\n\r\nOh and: If you have ideas, feel free to post them!\r\n\r\nNote: This does not change the GUARDS! there´s another mod that does this.\r\n\r\nI´ll keep improving this. I´m pretty sure I haven´t got all Soldiers I wanted to edit. I´ll need to test around a bit.\r\n\r\nProgramms used:\r\nSkyrim NPC Editor to edit the NPCs\r\nTESVSnip to make it ONE esp",
