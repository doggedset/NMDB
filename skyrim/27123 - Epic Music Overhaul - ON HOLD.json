And I always thought with right songs it could be so much better. I’ve tried several music overhaul mods but none of them fit my taste. So I decided to make my own.\r<br />\r<br />This compilation is the biggest music mod on Nexus yet. It replaces pretty much all vanilla songs and adds 170 new ones.\r<br />\r<br />-All major cities got their own unique music.\r<br />-There is a big difference in what kind of music plays at different times in different places. At night it is calm and relaxing, at day – magical and chanting. In snow zones it’s… chilly.\r<br />-A lot of ambient and creepy tracks for dungeons and dwemer ruins.\r<br />-Fights against dragons now feel more epic due to carefully chosen dramatic songs.\r<br />-You won’t hear ambient combat music when fighting weak enemies, it will only start in fights against trolls, predators and other strong foes. I also tried to make combat music to be as much unobtrusive as possible.\r<br />-You’ll hear songs from Lineage 2 (which I consider to have one of the best soundtracks and it fits perfectly for Skyrim), Gothic series, Vanguard: Saga of Heroes, Lord of the Rings, Narnia, Conan, Game of Thrones and many others great games and movies. Word EPIC doesn’t mean that drums and vocal chants everywhere. Music fits surroundings and I’m sure you wouldn’t feel desire to turn music off.\r<br />These are few examples of tracks to give you a taste:\r<br />\r<br />[b]Riverwood:[/b] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyinKrk87XQ\r<br />[b]Windhelm:[/b] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om_BKWttz18\r<br />[b]Day in the wilds:[/b] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfSnm4Kxyfo\r<br />[b]Night theme:[/b] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpTtYph_krA\r<br />[b]Dragon Fight:[/b] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyzTWnFzFaM\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Epic Skyrim Soundtrack compilation was made with the help of mod called Personalized Music (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13286).
