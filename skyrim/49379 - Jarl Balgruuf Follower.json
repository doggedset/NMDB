I go by too many names\r<br />\r<br />Description:This small mod allows you a &#39;Jarl Balgruuf clone&#39; as a follower in Skyrim. He resides in the Throne Room of Dragonsreach and is affectionly labeled &#34;Balgruuf the Lesser&#34;\r<br />He looks the exact same as Balgruuf. He is simply cloned into a follower friendly state. However, try not to keep him hanging in Dragonsreach. You&#39;ll be seeing double.\r<br />\r<br />He is dressed in his Jarl attire with a Steel Sword. Still, feel free to outfit him however you see fit. If you want him to wear Steel Plate Armour like he did in the Civil War, I stashed some in a Wardrobe in the Jarl&#39;s display room. I imagine most of you giving him Ebony or Daedric anyway so have fun.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:Simply load into Nexus Mod Manager.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:Delete the mod from NMM. Its the same old process\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: No DLC, Just Skyrim at 1.9.\r<br />\r<br />Change Log:What&#39;s there to change?\r<br />\r<br />Future Updates:What&#39;s there to update?\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues:None. I have actually packaged the FaceGen data so theres no grey-face.\r<br />While there are no gameplay issues with Balgruuf, its still very awkward to have those two in the same room.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />JARL BALLIN&#39;\r<br />BALLIN&#39;\r<br />BALLIN&#39;\r<br />JARL BALLIN&#39;\r<br />SWAG\r<br />HOLLA IF YOU NEED ME&#33;\r<br />",
