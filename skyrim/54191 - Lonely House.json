  "descriptionHtml": "[size=14][b]Description[/b][/size]\r<br />A small house located in northwestern Falkreath hold.\r<br />\r<br />Envisioned as a home that could fit in completely with the vanilla game. Only base-game resources used, with the Hearthfire version supplementing the vanilla with a few additions.\r<br />The aim was cozy, livable, and useful. Only the smallest farmhouse model was used, which meant creativity with set pieces was used, instead of adding on more space. For the most part, when you have a house, you have to work with the space you have.\r<br />Emittance has been set, lending to an atmospheric quality.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Important version information:[/b]\r<br />The no Hearthfire version is exactly what you see in the screenshots. What you see is what you get.\r<br />The Hearthfire version has full Hearthfire construction implemented. [i]However[/i], because i have little to no scripting experience there is something very important to note. The trigger to allow you to purchase wood from lumber mills is tied to the beginning of the Hearthfire building quest. Once you&#39;ve purchased your first plot of land in the Hearthfire expansion, you can purchase lumber. Until then, you can&#39;t build this home, unless you give yourself the wood through console commands. Additionally the lumber for home construction is invisible in your inventory.\r<br />To that end, i&#39;ve uploaded an optional version with an NPC that sells all the Hearthfire construction materials by the Falkreath lumbermill. However, again, i am not at all any sort of experienced with scripting, so this solution is haphazard: the npc is a normal merchant who stocks those items. Lumber now shows up in your inventory, which can be immersion breaking if you think of it as actually carrying all that wood.\r<br />So you have to weigh your options. I&#39;d really very much like to just implement an NPC with a dialogue option to sell wood for gold, exactly like the normal Hearthfire lumber purchase system is set up. However, i just don&#39;t know how to do that. Any help would be appreciated in that regard.\r<br />\r<br />[size=14][b]Installation[/b][/size]\r<br />Install via NMM or your favorite mod manager, or install manually by simply putting the .esp in your data folder.\r<br />To uninstall, take all your stuff out of the house, and then uninstall. No scripts to confound things in the no Hearthfire version. The Hearthfire version&#39;s scripts shouldn&#39;t leave any remnants.\r<br />\r<br />[size=14][b]Future Plans[/b][/size]\r<br />I aim to keep this pretty simple. There will be no quests associated with this mod ever. Just a simple house that&#39;s been abandoned that you have found. After exhausting this list, i&#39;ll probably end development and call it done. To add anything else would go against the spirit of the mod.\r<br />[ul][*]Eventually i&#39;d like to work in a custom housecarl/steward. At this point, that&#39;s pretty much it. But i don&#39;t know how to work with NPCs and dialogue and all that, so unless i get some help that&#39;s just not going to happen.[/ul]\r<br />\r<br />[size=14][b]Compatibility/Issues[/b][/size]\r<br />It should be compatible with just about whatever you can find. There are only scripts in the Hearthfire version, and they&#39;re simple scripts tied to new, invisible items. Additionally, i&#39;ve placed the small house in an area that i&#39;m pretty sure has been used by absolutely no mod before. Compatible with everything, we&#39;ll say.\r<br />Has gone through bugtesting, havok testing, navmesh testing and been cleaned with TES5Edit. Should be good to go in version 1.0.\r<br />I tried to be thorough, but i&#39;m only one guy. So let me know if you find any bugs&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=14][b]Features[/b][/size]\r<br />[i]Hearthfire construction featured in the Hearthfire version[/i]\r<br />[u]Interior:[/u]\r<br />5 Weapon racks\r<br />1 Shield rack\r<br />1 Cooking pot\r<br />1 Oven (HF)\r<br />10 Storage containers\r<br />4 Custom bookshelves\r<br />1 Bed\r<br />Plenty of idle markers\r<br />[u]Exterior:[/u]\r<br />1 House\r<br />1 Bench\r<br />1 Tanning rack\r<br />1 Rug\r<br />1 Garden (HF uses garden planters)\r<br />A few idle markers\r<br />[u]Cellar:[/u]\r<br />1 Workbench\r<br />1 Grindstone\r<br />1 Alchemy table\r<br />1 Enchanting table\r<br />9 Storage containers\r<br />Just one idle marker\r<br />\r<br />[size=16][b]Other information[/b][/size]\r<br />My ENB is [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23765]Skyrealism&#39;s vanilla preset[/url].\r<br />I won&#39;t be uploading a map marker screenshot to the main images, because i want to preserve the feeling of a small abandoned house that you stumble upon. That being said, another user has uploaded a screenshot of the map marker, so if you can&#39;t find it, or otherwise just want to rush to the house, you can check the user images tab.\r<br />\r<br />I made this house as something that i myself would want to use, and it is very special to me to know that other people like it also. So thank you for using my mod.",
