  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'m not a big vampire fan by any means. When I started Skyrim life as a vampire though it seemed that everything was bass-ackwards. The vampires got weaker when they fed and stronger without feeding? It just seemed wrong to me. \r\n\r\nThis mod sets vampires up in a more lore friendly manner. Stage 1 vampires are now the strongest and get weaker in higher stages. The longer you go without feeding the weaker your powers and stats get. At Stage 4 your vampire powers as well as your health, stamina, and magicka are crippled so going a long time without feeding is a bad idea. This also adds a \\\"Master Vampire Cloak\\\" to the game which can be found in the Riften Hall of the Dead on a coffin shelf. Just keep in mind this is still a work in progress so some things might be missing/incomplete.\r\n\r\nBugs: None reported yet.\r\n\r\nConflicts: None reported yet.",
