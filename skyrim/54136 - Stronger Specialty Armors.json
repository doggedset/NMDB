  "descriptionHtml": "Changes I use in my game. There&#39;re mods like this out there, but they cover only some of the pieces modified here, so why not share it with the community? \r<br />\r<br />-------------\r<br />Ancient Nord Set now provides the protection of Steel.\r<br />\r<br />Falmer Armor Set changed to 28/13/13/11 (main piece/gloves/gauntlets/helmet) from 31/12/12/10, in order to differentiate it from the new Ancient Nord values.\r<br />\r<br />Wolf Armor now provided same protection as Dwarwen, and has the appropriate price.\r<br />\r<br />-------------\r<br />Imperial Heavy Set main piece and shield how provide Banded Iron protection. Still weak (since you can get in from the very beginning), but now it&#39;s not strictly the worst heavy set in the game.\r<br />\r<br />Imperial Light main piece is now 24 (from 23).\r<br />\r<br />Imperial Studded and Stormcloak Cuirass main pieces are now 26 (from 23, equivalent to leather main piece).\r<br />\r<br />Unused in vanilla, but used in some mods, Stormcloak sleeved cuirass is now 27. \r<br />\r<br />Stormcloak Fur Boots are now 6 (from 5), since they look re-inforced. \r<br />\r<br />Stormcloak Officer Set is now equivalent in protection to Gilded Elven Armor (with the helmet providing 1 protection point more, since bear heads are cool).\r<br />\r<br />-------------\r<br />Penitus Oculatus Set is now equivalent in protection and weight to Scaled Armor.\r<br />\r<br />General Tullius&#39; cuirass is now 35 (from 31).\r<br />\r<br />Ulfric&#39;s outfit now provides protection of 32 for main piece and 10 for boots and bracers. Saratje&#39;s Ulfric Clothes for Females mod integrated.\r<br />\r<br />Roggi&#39;s Ancestral Shield, the only favor item that can be still in action after retreival (since Roggi is a potential follower), now has Banded Iron Shield graphics, is Light Armor (to correspond to poor Roggi&#39;s class), has the weight of 5 and provides protection of 22 (slightly more then Elven shields). \r<br />",
