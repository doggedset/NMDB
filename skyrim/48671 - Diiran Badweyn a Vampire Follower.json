Due ugly face morph in vampire race, i decide to set his race in creation kit become RaceNord not RaceNordVampire. So basicly he is human but i add vampire Attribute like poison resistant, frost resistant increase 50%, fire resistant decrease -50%, Disease Resistant, sun damage, and Nightstalker&#39;s Footsteps. i also add drain health and raise zombie spell.\r<br />** his eyes may be little different between this eyes in version and eyes on some screenshot. most screenshot taken on BETA test and use different eye texture. That texture mod was take down from nexus before this follower mod have change to release. So i make eye texture who almost similiar to previous eye texture. ",
