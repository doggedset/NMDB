  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=5][b]\r<br />This mod is officially on hold. [/b][/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />Current part list:\r<br />Leather, Six variations (gloves, gloves 2, fancy boots, pleated boots, fur-top boots, short-boots, foldover boots, imperial boots, imperial bracers, hard leather helmet, imperial helmet, leather hood, leather hood 2, leather cap, brigandine sleeved, brigandine sleevless, and three leather jacket variations.)\r<br />\r<br />Metals, Four+ variants (imperial vambraces, shin boots, helmet and armor, stormcloak helm, iron &#34;dragonborn&#34; helm, companions jawbone helm, basic steel helm, steel plate gauntlets, boots, helmet, and armor, nordic cuffed boots and gauntlets, both steel armors, chainmail shirts and hoods, scalemale brigandines sleeved and unsleeved.)\r<br />\r<br />In the future I intend to bring in more Witcher ports, with separate textures and several metal variants. As well as much needed shields&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />SURVEY HERE: [url=http://kwiksurveys.com/s.asp?sid=h9gbjqcx2he242k460209]clack\r<br />[/url]\r<br />The best help you can give me is better direction. This initial survey will\r<br /> help me. It&#39;s a purely information oriented survey, so don&#39;t expect me \r<br />to make any money off it or anything. If anything it probably makes \r<br />money for the people hosting it. I didn&#39;t feel like paying for one or \r<br />two surveys so sorry about that.\r<br />\r<br />Even better though would be meshing. Contact me if you&#39;d like an if not dedicated, a decent texture \r<br />artist to make variants of your work, off of remeshes or all new meshes.\r<br /> All I ask is mesh usage for this mod with credit given in entirety.\r<br />\r<br />NEW Update: Uploading the last bit of work I&#39;ve done so you can at least \r<br />have shields. Be forewarned of oddities like test armor and my as of yet\r<br /> unseparated Fist of the North Star armor pieces. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/images/473095/?](that jagi helmet is bad-ass though...)[/url]Â There are also some minor armor build glitches. Meaning the model is set up \r<br />wrong and the skinny mesh is the buff one and vice verse. This isn&#39;t \r<br />widespread though.\r<br />\r<br />Last UPDATE: Changed my envmaps, changed some textures, added some stuff, and finally got some stuff craftable. The \r<br />barest implementation of my new crafting system is taking place. It will\r<br /> be an optional file that requires you to make rings and scales before \r<br />you make your armor, and will involve them for fixes and crafting. I&#39;ve \r<br />also equalized two leather colors. Black, and work-glove tan. Please \r<br />tell me which you all think should stay, and which one should become \r<br />ivory leather. (ala Assassin&#39;s Creed 2 and other sources. leather that&#39;s\r<br /> a dullish white) several tones. It&#39;s almost all craftable, with a test \r<br />cell to try it out, called &#34;tf_armorzone&#34;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />But it&#39;s not done. I&#39;d like all your help to guide me in where this needs to go. What\r<br /> colors are good, what might work as alternates, good varied \r<br />screenshots, etc. Anyway, until then, I&#39;ll be slowly building a good \r<br />descriptive page for this, as well as my own screens and improvements. \r<br />Thanks, and good luck&#33;\r<br />\r<br />And don&#39;t worry too much. This mod has been at least tested by a team of two for months. It&#39;s just that two \r<br />aren&#39;t much compared to a broader array of people with more varied \r<br />perspectives.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/57755-1-1411942705.gif[/img]",
