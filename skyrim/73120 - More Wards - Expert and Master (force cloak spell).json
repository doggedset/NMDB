  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][color=#1e84cc]INTRODUCTION[/color][/size]\r<br />This mod is not finished yet, and still needs some balancing, so if you feel that the spell is overpowered or if you find some bugs, please tell me in the comments.\r<br />\r<br />Also, I want to point out that I&#39;m still a beginner, especially with scripting and the papyrus language, so feel free to give\r<br />me any tips or suggestions, in particular on the script.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=3]DESCRIPTION[/size][/color]\r<br />The purpose of this mod is to complete the ward system of the game by adding the missing spell for expert and master mages.\r<br />The 2 new spells added are:\r<br />\r<br />-Superior Ward\r<br />\r<br />-Force Cloak\r<br />\r<br />Superior Ward will act just like a normal ward except it is more powerful.\r<br />\r<br />When it comes to the master spell, that I called Force Cloak, I wanted to do semething different: all the ward spells works by channeling, and that means that If I were to add a master channeling ward, you couldn&#39;t have done much with it other than defending, since the spell would require both of your hands. Having said that, I decided to add a non channeling spell, like dragonhide, that basically works like a ward, negating incoming spell damage at the cost of your ward health. In other words the spell will let you create a shield around you that will absorb a certain amount of spell damage and will break when depleted.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The 2 spells can be obtained just like any other spell in the game, and that means that to get Force Cloak you&#39;ll need to complete the ritual restoration quest.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=3]OPTIONAL FILES[/size][/color]\r<br />The mod also includes some optional files (wich still need some testing) for compatibility with Better Wards.\r<br />The two mods don&#39;t conflint but if you won&#39;t use those you will end up with two almost identical spell, since better wards&#39; greater ward will become just as powerful as my superior ward.\r<br />I&#39;ve also included an optional patch that will double the magnitude of the master spell that will work (at least, I think) well with mods that add magic scaling, since the magnitude of the spell is handled within the script and thus cannot be direcly affected by those kind of mods.\r<br />Anyways, if you want a balanced game don&#39;t use the double magnitude, because, from what I&#39;ve tested, it&#39;s pretty op.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=3]TECNICAL STUFF[/size][/color]\r<br />here is the math I used to make the spell. Feel free to criticize if you feel there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing or I could improve.\r<br />\r<br />                            Magnitude - vanilla            Magnitude - Better Wards           \r<br />\r<br />&gt;Lesser Ward                    40/s                                      50/s    \r<br />  \r<br />&gt;Steadfast Ward               60/s                                       75/s     \r<br />\r<br />&gt;Greater Ward                  80/s                                     100/s     \r<br />\r<br />&gt;Superior Ward                100/s                                     125/s    \r<br />\r<br />&gt;Force Cloak*        120/s * 30s = 3600                    150/s * 30 = 4500\r<br />\r<br />           \r<br />*the duration of force cloak is 30s so I thought that if you were to use a magnitude 120 ward for 30s you would use (120*30) magicka.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=3]BUGS[/size][/color]\r<br />&gt;I&#39;ve noticed that when you are fighting 2 or more magical enemies, sometimes the force cloaks script seems to fail to calculate both of the incoming damage. Maybe it&#39;s because the way the scripts works or it&#39;s just my impression, in any case I will have to do further testing to verify this.\r<br />&gt;Currently force cloak doesn&#39;t protect you against cloak spells, like flame cloak.\r<br />&gt;If you cast the spell while the the effect is acrive, the spell and the effect will dispell (and that means that it&#39;s toggable, so even if it wasn&#39;t intended to be like this, it could still be useful for someone)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=3]FUTURE PLANS\r<br />[/size][/color]&gt;Balance Force Cloak\r<br />&gt;Improve the spell sounds adn effect\r<br />&gt;(hopefully)Fix any eventual bug\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=3]CONCLUSION[/size][/color]\r<br />Also, I wanted to point out that I&#39;m still a beginner, especially with scripts and the papyrus language, so feel free to give me any tips or suggestions.\r<br />\r<br />I apologise for my english (which is not my first language as you might have guessed) or if I haven&#39;t been clear with the description of the mod.\r<br />\r<br />Finally, if you are interested here it is the awesome and highly underrated [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7337/?]enb[/url] that I&#39;m using.\r<br /> \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=3]CREDITS[/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4958207]renketsu0[/url] the author of better wards\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/848320]XunAmarox[/url] for his very clear guide on how to create Fomods\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/71983]mysty[/url] the author of better magic, for part of his script which I used as a reference to create mine (and I&#39;ve also learned alot in the process)",
