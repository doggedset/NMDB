  "descriptionHtml": "Dwemer Alchemiluminescent Torches!\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\nThis is NOT my mod! I was kindly given permission by the creator/author Imperator3 to upload this translated version to SkyrimNexus. \r\n\r\nDescription-\r\nBored of running around with vanila torches? Tired of throwing magelights and candlelights up everywhere when exploring dungeons? You\\'re in luck, \\'cause have I got the mod for you! \r\nThis mod adds seven different colors of once lost Dwemer Alchemiluminescent Torches! Now you can \r\nraid those dungeons in style with a color that fits your character\\'s mood or fancy!\r\n\r\nIncludes-\r\nEight stand-alone, (kind of lore-friendly) Dwemer Alchemiluminescent Torches!\r\n\r\nDwemer Alchemilume (RED)\r\nDwemer Alchemilume (ORANGE)\r\nDwemer Alchemilume (YELLOW)\r\nDwemer Alchemilume (GREEN)\r\nDwemer Alchemilume (BLUE)\r\nDwemer Alchemilume (PURPLE)\r\nDwemer Alchemilume (WHITE)\r\n*NEW Dwemer Alchemilume (VT) - VT, stands for Vanilla Torch.\r\nBasically the new torch is just a dimmer version of the white torch.\r\nIt\\'s got the same brightness and radius as a vanilla torch, but doesn\\'t emit the same light.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can retrieve these lights in a chest inside Mzulft Storage Wing on the trail to the Dwarven Ruins of Mzulft.\r\nAlternatively, you can add these to your inventory by accessing the console by clicking the tilde key (~`)\r\nand entering in help \\\"alchemilume\\\" 4, with or without quotations (it doesn\\'t really matter) \r\nand then entering player.additem xxxxxxxx 1 (I\\'m sure most of you already know how to do this)\r\n\r\nInstallation-\r\ntake the .esp file along with the meshes and textures files and extract & drop it into your steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data folder.\r\n*NEW Thanks to volvaga0 I\\'ve now got this NMM compatible. I apologize for the inconvenience it\\'s caused.\r\n\r\nUninstallation-\r\ndelete GS.esp from your steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data folder\r\ndelete 1AGS folder from steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data/meshes folder\r\ndelete 1AGS folder from steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data/textures folder\r\n\r\nCompatibility-\r\nAnd I\\'m 99% sure that there is no in-compatibility with this mod, \r\nunless you have something that changes the storeroom to the Dwemer Ruins of Mzulft, which I doubt.\r\nTorches for Realistic Lighting doesn\\'t have any effect on these from what I\\'ve been told. \r\nIf you do find anything, leave a comment or PM me.\r\n\r\nNotes!\r\n-Basically, the alchemilumes act as torches. You can block with them, and bash with them.\r\nWhen you bash with them, they set fire to your enemy just as vanilla torches do.\r\n\r\n-You\\'ll find guards all over Skyrim walking around with these, I don\\'t know what causes this.\r\nI\\'m no modder, nor a CK whizz, so I don\\'t know how to change this. Currently learning more\r\nabout the CK, so I may implement changes depending on whether I get the go-ahead from Imperator3!\r\n\r\n-The lights are pretty bright, and are great for mods that darken nights and dungeons!\r\nIf you do find these TOO bright, I\\'ve just added in a new torch that has the same brightness and radius as a vanilla torch!\r\nAgain, it\\'s basically a dimmer version of the white torch, but has the same brightness and radius as a vanilla torch.\r\n\r\n-THIS IS NOT MY MOD. I was very kindly given permission to upload this to SkyrimNexus by the mod\\'s author and creator Imperator3 from modgames.net\r\n\r\nCredits/Shout outs!\r\n\r\n-the ACTUAL author Imperator3 for creating this mod, and kindly letting me upload and share with SkyrimNexus!\r\n-volvaga0 for helping me sort out this NMM compatibility nonsense.\r\n-Bethesda for having such awesome game series!\r\n-SkyrimNexus for showing me how much fun it is to modify games, I\\'m probably not switching back to console gaming ever, lol!",
