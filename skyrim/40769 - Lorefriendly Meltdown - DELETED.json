  "summary": "Turn ordinary junk and rubbish into useful crafting ingredients!",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a crafting overhaul mod which allows most, if not, all miscellaneous items, and vanilla weapons and armor to be melted down into ingots and other crafting ingredients. I have added a condition so these items only show up if you have the items to melt down. I\\'ve tried to make it so this can\\'t be abused, so you can\\'t get all the ingots or leather pieces you used to craft the item. Also, I\\'ve added conditions to the Dwarven Scrap recipes so they only show up if you have the items.\r\n\r\n!WARNING!\r\nIt is possible to melt and disassemble the items your wearing. As far as I know, there is no way to avoid this. However, most unique armors I have left out due to this, so you won\\'t end up accidentally melting a Daedric artifact.\r\n\r\nLeveled Enchanted items are not added, due to the fact that there are so many of them, and that I don\\'t have the time or patience to make recipes for all of them.\r\nDaedric items are excluded due to the face that they are made with a ritual of sorts, and aren\\'t easy to melt.\r\nDragon items are excluded, as the only thing that could be made out of them are small bits of ebony, or bonemeal. I think you couldn\\'t get the dragon bones back, as they are organic items, and can\\'t be easily reshaped and reused.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions of items I\\'ve missed, or comments on the existing one\\'s, feel free to add a comment.\r\n\r\nAs this mod only contains and edits crafting recipes, it can be installed and uninstalled without worry. Also, as it only has new crafting recipes, except for the dwarven scrap, it is compatible with everything that doesn\\'t affect the dwarven scrap recipes. If the mod does affect the dwarven scrap recipes, load this before that mod.\r\n\r\nYou can edit this mod as you see fit.",
