They are craftable with the ingredients for head, cuirass, boots, and gauntlets for their respective type (note the ingredients are the ingredients with my other mod Item Stat Overhaul: Armor and Weapons http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=79111625).\r\nI made these so you call wear whatever armor, or lack thereof, that you wish while still having a good armor rating.\r\n\r\nAlso on Steam http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=90170577",
