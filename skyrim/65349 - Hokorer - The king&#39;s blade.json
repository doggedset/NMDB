  "descriptionHtml": "This here is a weapon i worked on all day.  It&#39;s called Hokorer also known as the king&#39;s blade.  I tried make it look like this sword http://duello.tv/assets/italian-longsword.jpg?464d46 but instead my model appeared to look like this, and yes the textures, they&#39;re not good.  I&#39;m so sorry but i&#39;m not good at making textures :( but hey i&#39;m learning this stuff.  So how do you get this blade?  Well you&#39;ll have to craft it, go to the skyforge it has to be the skyforge not any forge but the skyforge.  You will need two gold ingots, four steel ingots and one leather strip.  So enjoy this blade.\r<br />\r<br />Fun fact: the name for the blade was so hard to come up with.\r<br />\r<br />there is one problem with this though, it&#39;s a part of the crossguard.  It will show a black spot, i&#39;m sorry for that.  I don&#39;t think i can fix it, other than that the weapon is good so far.\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t upload this on another site.",
