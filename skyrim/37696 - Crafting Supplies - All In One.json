This mod contains spoilers, if you have not completed the Dragonborn DLC please do not read further, unless you don't care about spoilers in which case, continue. \n<br />\n<br />This mod adds a chest near the smelter at the Blacksmith's in Ravenrock (the first place you visit).\n<br /> The chest contains 1000 of each item needed for Smithing, Alchemy and the all new Staff Enchanting.\n<br />\n<br />The new items throughout Solstheim can be hard to obtain in vast quantities and endlessly searching for them can detract from the whole experience, this mod allows you to forget about that and enjoy Solsteim without needless tresure hunts.\n<br />\n<br />The chest will restock every time you open it, no more waiting (unlimited supplies).\n<br />\n<br />P.S. \n<br />It might not be obvious given the name \"Dragonborn Supplies\" but this mod requires the DLC \"Dragonborn\", it's not called \"Dragonborn Supplies\" because it has anything to do with you, the Dragonborn. And I said Dragonborn 4 times, now 5 in one sentence.[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=125246170]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/37696-6-1478095884.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />This mods adds a sack to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun with 1000 of each type of food, including Fruit &amp; Veg, Meat, Wine and more.\n<br />There are 2 version of this mod, the standard version that requires no DLC and the Hearthfire Edtion which includes Hearthfire food items and obviously requires the Hearthfire DLC. \n<br />\n<br />The sack will restock every thime you open it, no more waiting (unlimited supplies).\n<br />\n<br />NOTE: This mod may conflict with any other mods that edits the interior of the Bannered Mare. \n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/37696-7-1478095884.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Manual:\n<br />Download any of the main file you want to use,\n<br />unzip the file and drop the .esp(s) and .bsa(s) into your Skyrim Data Folder located here:\n<br />Local Disk(C:)Program Files/Steam/Steam Apps/Common/Skyrim/Data\n<br />\n<br />Nexus Mod Manager:\n<br />Press 'Download With Manager' button.\n<br />Open NMM and activate them, if you have more than one of the 'Supplies' mods, when asked to upgrade say no,\n<br />the NMM doesn't recognize them as individual mods.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/37696-8-1478095884.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Delete the .esp(s) and .bsa(s) from your Skyrim Data Folder located here:\n<br />Local Disk(C:)Program Files/Steam/Steam Apps/Common/Skyrim/Data",
