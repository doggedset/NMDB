  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3753/9805603843_f407bd88e1_o.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5514/9805553026_aab7e8ccc2_o.png[/img]\r\n[size=2]This mod morphs the lovely Snow White Crown by Anton0028 into a Circlet. \r\nIn the past I was asked about that Mod pretty often, and most of the time I\\'ve tried to explain how you can get the circlet with a small use of Nifskope. This mod is for all people who dont even want to touch Nifskope or another mesh-editing-program. I hope you have fun with it and enjoy it as much as I do. I also changed the textures a little, made them look more darker and not so shiny. \r\nThe little stone in the middle of the circlet still changes color, as the original mod! Images are very welcome!\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This is made for female characters. Male character can use the crown too, but it will look totally different![/size]\r\n\r\n[youtube]l7nypEmNXp8[/youtube]\r\n[size=1]Thanks so much for the great video![/size]\r\n\r\n[size=2]\r\n[img]http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2872/9805520415_f338277305_o.png[/img]\r\n1. [b]INSTALL THE MAIN MOD[/b]. Without it, it won\\'t work. \r\nYou need to download the original [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37710/?]Snow White Crown by Anton0028[/url] first. Easy installation via NMM.\r\n\r\n2. Install my Mod. \r\na) Easy installation with NMM. Click \\\"Yes\\\" on any overwriting-questions.\r\nb) Manual installation. Extract the files, copy them from the folder and paste them into your own -> Data -> textures / meshes -> Anton-Mods. \r\nAgain agree on the overwriting.\r\n\r\n3. Deinstallation or changing back to the original Snow White Crown: \r\na) Easy way with NMM. Just deinstall. \r\nb) Manual deinstallation: get the original files from Anton and let them overwrite again.\r\nc) Get rid of the whole mod: just delete the folders and the Snow White.esp\r\n\r\nEnjoy! If you have any issues, please let me know!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2806/9805520525_334cb44d78_o.png[/img]\r\n\\\"You can create the crown in any forge if you have appropriate ingredients. (Topic: Jewelry)\\\"\r\n- Quote by Anton\r\nIf you\\'re a lazy lass you can use console ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7392/9805525665_d10df2f463_o.png[/img]\r\nAll the credits go straight to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/437824/?]Anton[/url], who is a very talented and creative modder for making this wonderful crown. \r\nCheck out his other stuff too!
