  "summary": "Adds two mead halls to the Whiterun area.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod Simply adds a few NPCs, a Faction(There will be a quest to join it once I learn how to make/edit quests), and the Mead Halls. \r\n***********POSSIBLE SPOILER*****************\r\nI plan to add a world space for the quest, probably just a duplicate of the \\\"Mind of Madness\\\" or \\\"Sovengarde\\'. Also, it should be noted that these Mead Halls are duplicates of the Jorvasker Mead Hall and the Whiterun castle, as I liked both of them and wanted to make my own home in them.\r\nThis is my first mod, so please criticize the hell out of it. Nothing good came from baby-ing someone.",
