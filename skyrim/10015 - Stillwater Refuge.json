  "descriptionHtml": "This plug-in adds a new playable house near Darkwater Crossing.\r\nThe house includes a living room, a bedroom with fully operating bookshelves and weapons displayers, an alchemy/enchanting lab, a basement and a secret treasure room accessible via a false cabinet in the living room.\r\nInto the basement there is also a secret door that leads to the Stillwater Abyss.\r\nThis is a system of two very deep caves linked by an underwater tunnel. In the first one there is a camp-site for underground studies. The second cave is the perfect habitat for a Nirnroot plantation.\r\n\r\nNote that the house is fully Navmeshed and all containers are safe and non-respawning.\r\nThis project is a work-in-progress, so further optimizations and modifications will be added constantly.\r\n\r\nFor all your questions you can e-mail me at: Dark_Angel__90@hotmail.it\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n\r\n    Weapon Plaques fixed: now they display your weapons correctly.\r\n    Added a Map Marker for Stillwater Refuge enabling Fast Travel to this location.",
