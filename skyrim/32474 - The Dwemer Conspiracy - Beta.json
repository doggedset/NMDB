  "descriptionHtml": "I\\\\\\'ve started using the Creation Kit a week ago and this is my first effort.\r\nIt\\\\\\'s a small world-space island with one dungeon, nothing fancy, no quests, some enemies.\r\n\r\nChances are I will not finish this mod as I seem to have \\\\\\\"done it wrong\\\\\\\" in creating the world space which prevents me from creating the LOD (or at least I was unsuccessful in creating it).\r\n\r\nI\\\\\\'m sure that someone talented can \\\\\\\"fix it\\\\\\\" or expand on it rather quickly.\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n\r\n-Island is accessible via the NPC \\\\\\\"Captain Sverwin\\\\\\\" at the Solitude docks\r\n-Custom objects/npcs/dungeon references are prefixed AAI or AAAI\r\n-non-cleaned up NavMeshes\r\n-Tower Dungeon Hub is expandable with multiple doors that are currently locked and don\\\\\\'t lead anywhere\r\n-Theres ~10 books around detailing the history and events of the island (fan fiction alert)\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit, expand and play with the content as you see fit (just give credit if you are using it wholesale).",
