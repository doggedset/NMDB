It looked kind of boring before. This will spice it all up :)\r\n\r\nRequirements: Skyrim\r\n\r\nConflicts: It modifies the vanilla wench dress and boots. so it will overwrite anything else that changes the wench- dress and boots.\r\n\r\nLocation: Bar wenches throughout skyrim. or simply use the console code for it (000D191F for the dress and 000D1921 for the boots) .\r\n\r\nPermissions: You\\'re allowed to use this texture in whatever mod you want just credit me for it.\r\n\r\nCredits and thanks: thanks to skyrim for not crashing too many times while looking at the dress in game during the creation phase.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n/Wolbryne",
