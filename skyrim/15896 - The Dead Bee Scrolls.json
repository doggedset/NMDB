It takes the player through a new dungeon complex filled with enemies, traps, and new treasures.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.4: Fixed quest pointer and added in a few things.\r\n\r\nIf anyone finds any bugs that my testers and I missed, please feel free to comment, or send me a message.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy my mod, please rate it. More dungeon and quest mods are to come!\r\n\r\n\r\n[youtube]arjcXS9sJV0[/youtube]\r\n\r\nThank you Player Two, also known on the Nexus as manualdegauss, for making this great trailer!\r\n\r\nAnd a special thanks to Hellcat5, for helping me with some details(I love details) and for his vast assistance to the modding community in general.
