  "summary": "I always have sufferd with low FPS in skyrim with max 30-40fps in crossfire.\r\nA Small but efective way for more FPS in Skyrim is ...\r\n\r\nWhen ingame press CTRL-ALT-DEL for taskmanager, then CANCEL and you go auto. back in game with 30FPS MORE !!! works all the time on my system, but when you go fast-travel witch map then you must do CTRL-ALT-DEL + C",
  "descriptionHtml": "My system :\r\n\r\nAsus Maximus IV GENE-Z\r\nIntel Core i7-2600k CPU O.C. 4,6GHz\r\n16GB DDR3 1600MHz\r\n2x AMD Radeon HD 6970 2GB ( running in crossfire with Ati driver 12.1 preview )\r\nscreen resolution 2560x1600\r\nWindows 7 64bit\r\n\r\nI tested following :\r\n\r\nSettings in skyrim :\r\n\r\nEverything on ULTRA ( except AA on 2 samples - because on this high resolution i don\\'t see a difference) & (AF on 4 -16 samples don\\'t make a difference in performance to my system, so your choice).\r\nResulotion 2560x1600\r\n\r\nSettings CCC :\r\n\r\nWith driver 12.1 ( all settings in CCC op default - application controlled ) triple buffering on.\r\nNo user defined application profile needed because i only have Skyrim on system ;-) but you can make one offcourse if you want.\r\n\r\nAMD CrossfireX - Enabled !\r\nOverdrive is Disabled\r\n\r\nTest 1 - i disabled vsync in skyrim.ini with iPresentInterval=0 under [Display] for testing only with fraps.\r\nStart the game WITH the 4GB PATCH from here !! and i get 35-45 fps all the time in towns, after CTRL-ALT-DEL + Cancel i get 80-120FPS !!! wow ... played for 30min. in town with these steady FPS.\r\n\r\nThen map travel to grass/tree sections and i was again on 30-40 fps, after the CTRL-ALT-DEL + Cancel i get back 70-110FPS !!!\r\n\r\nWorks very good here, hoping for the future for a patch so that we don\\'t need to do Ctrl-Alt-Del anymore.\r\n\r\nAfter testing i played hours without problems so that will fix the FPS drop for me until there\\'s a better solution.\r\n\r\nI also set vsync back on because i hate screentearing, but everything keeps running @ steady 55-60fps\r\n\r\nAll that with MANY HD Graphical Mods from here and also the post Process Injector installed !!\r\n\r\nI also include my own skyrim.ini and SkyrimPrefs.ini files that i use now for playing.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: works also for Single cards - but the fps+ is very minimal, i only get 5 frames more in single-card setting.",
