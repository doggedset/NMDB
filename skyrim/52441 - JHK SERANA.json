  "descriptionHtml": "My modification of Serana, requires Apachii Sky Hair. Removes her necromany and replaces her hair.\r<br />\r<br />You may get the dark face bug with this. I&#39;m really loading this in to Nexus as an easy way to share it between my systems. I will probably not try to fix the dark face bug as I have tried before with my other mod but failed and it&#39;s just easier to fix it in the CK once you download the mod. Sorry for the inconvenience. Again, I&#39;m really more sharing this with myself as I now have 2 laptops and a desktop that I use for Skyrim, but I thought I would throw it up on Nexus in case anyone else might be interested. Feel free to use the mod as you see fit.",
