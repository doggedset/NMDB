  "descriptionHtml": "[img=center]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/51344-1-1392944067.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />This mod simply adds the character [color=#436163]Dar&#39;Shan[/color] into the Skyrim world to use as a follower. This mod uses only vanilla assets, so it&#39;s nothing special, but it&#39;s something I found myself enjoying. \r<br />\r<br />I should mention this before anything else: [i]this is my very first plugin.[/i] If you find and inconsistencies or errors in anything, please let me know&#33; This is mostly for you, after all, and I want to make this the best I can.\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=#436163]The Character[/color][/heading]\r<br />The character himself is from a friend of mine.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#436163]Dar&#39;Shan can be found in Falkreath, just wasting some time in Dead Man&#39;s Drink.[/color] He&#39;s got plenty of perks to fit his lore, including [color=#436163]Ranger[/color] and [color=#436163]Green Thumb.[/color] He levels with the player, but starts around level 10, and is essential so he can never be killed. He starts with an Imperial bow, a steel sword, 160 steel arrows, and an elven dagger. [color=#436163]He prefers bows, one-handed weapons, and light armor[/color] and is efficient in all of them. He switches between the two combat methods when necessary; bows when enemies are far away, one-handed when they&#39;re up close.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]However, as a warning, he does stay where you dismissed him, so you may want to dismiss him in a town or somewhere else where you know you can find him better.[/color] This does mean that he&#39;ll hang around in your home if you dismiss him there&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://25.media.tumblr.com/25462d5f92a8dfc0100d22f68ab6956a/tumblr_mvcjsu6T0P1sl0qaqo1_500.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=#436163]Required Files[/color][/heading]\r<br />None, except [color=orange]a copy of Skyrim and Update.esm[/color] (which you should already have if you use Skyrim in conjunction with Steam).\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=#436163]Recommended Mods[/color][/heading] \r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36913/?]MFVM - More Follower Voices Mod Plus Khajiit Marriage[/url] by Mysticentity [i][color=grey](Dar&#39;Shan should be eligible for marriage, but will have no real dialogue for the marriage dialogue options.
