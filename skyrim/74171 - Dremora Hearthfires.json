  "summary": "Another build-your-own-home mod, but with a difference. Once you&#39;ve constructed all the furnishings, you&#39;ll get a spell to summon a Dremora Housecarl&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "In my earlier Hearthfires mods, I&#39;ve moved away from the standard formula of house building provided in the DLC itself. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64038]Orc Hearthfires[/url] had you build an Orc Stronghold instead of a conventional manor house. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69061]Argonian Hearthfires[/url] cleared out an underground ruin with an underwater entrance and furnished it as a home. And in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71553]Khajiit Hearthfires[/url] you didn&#39;t build the house, but a wagon. The associated house was built for you, once the wagon was complete. This mod continues that, in being as much a summoning mod, as a home-building one.\r<br />\r<br />A number of Dremora were stranded in Tamriel when the gates were closed at the end of the Oblivion Crisis, so they&#39;re aware of the events that have ensued since that time. When the player is hailed as Dragonborn, they see an opportunity to gain respect in his or her service, and make contact with an offer. If the player will rebuild an old Nordic Tower into a suitable residence, they&#39;ll provide a summonable Dremora Housecarl to guard it, and the player, in the true housecarl manner.\r<br />\r<br />The old tower isn&#39;t easy to reach, which is a further test of the player&#39;s fitness to have Dremora assistance, so it would be hard to get timber delivered there. Logs sufficient to construct everything will appear when the player starts construction. Ores, and other building materials that can easily be carried, are the player&#39;s responsibility.\r<br />\r<br />Unlike the Hearthfires DLC homes, you don&#39;t have to construct the whole building, but you will be adding a roof, repairing floors, and building a viewing platform with a great vista. There isn&#39;t a great deal of room, so adoption etc. aren&#39;t supported. You do have a complete set of crafting stations, so this is a viable base of operations for any adventurer who&#39;s prepared to use fast travel. At the edge of the map, you won&#39;t want to walk home every day.\r<br />\r<br />Once you have completed enough of the furnishing to make the place into a usable home, you&#39;ll find a spell tome that offers you a choice of spells to summon your housecarl. The housecarl can be male, or female, according to the player&#39;s choice. Their skills will depend on the player&#39;s own, so a player that has more Magicka than Health or Stamina will summon an Archer; a player with a higher Archery skill will summon a fighter, and everyone else, a Mage. If the player&#39;s skill/attribute balance changes as the game progresses, they may get a different type of housecarl the next time they summon. The spell has no magicka cost, and the duration of the summon is 999 days, like the elemental thralls.\r<br />\r<br />The female housecarls will also wear either regular or skimpier outfits according to your selection of spell. Be careful where you summon, or they might not have an outfit at all&#33; \r<br />\r<br />More information can be found [url=http://ghastley.org/Skyrim/Docs/DremoraHearthfires.html]here[/url]. A copy of these pages is included with the mod.\r<br />\r<br />---\r<br />\r<br />Versions 1.1 and 1.2 were bug-fixes.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.3 just adds a shrine, so you can cure diseases at home. It is added with the bedside tables, so if you already made those, it will be there in your game.\r<br />\r<br />---\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility: The letter from the Kyn is sent when you have been &#34;outed&#34; as dragonborn, so any mod preventing that will be incompatible.
