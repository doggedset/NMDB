  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]Dawnguard required! Hearthfire optional, but recommended.[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nAfter nearly a week\\'s work I\\'m finally done with my handmade Playerhome and the first mod I\\'m uploading.\r\nFully equipped with mannequins, weapon plaques, kitchen with an oven, blacksmith, enchanting table and alchemy lab and several bookshelves with enough space to store all books you might find on your journeys.\r\nAlmost all lights provided and some other things are per script time controlled.\r\nThe Lakeside Residence is located at Lake Ilinalta. Just take the southern road out of Riverwood, heading towards the Guardian Stones. You can\\'t miss it.\r\nThe key to the residence is hidden somewhere close to the main gate. Take a look around, it\\'s nearby.\r\n\r\nI\\'d rather not talk to much. Just look at the pictures and if you like what you see, give it a try! \r\nShould you come across any bugs or failures of any kind, please let me know so I can fix them immediately!\r\nIf you have any questions, just pm me and I\\'ll answer as soon as I can.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend [url=skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10891] Unlimited Bookshelves [/url]to use the full potential of all the shelves in this Playerhome.\r\n\r\nYou are not allowed to upload my mod anywhere else without my permission!\r\n\r\n[u]For all those that have difficulties finding the key: Take a look at the textfile included in the download.[/u]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[youtube]_YS4qUCJvkg[/youtube] [youtube]IRS1Ys1Bpls[/youtube]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]Troubleshooting[/u]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]If you experience vanishing walls/rooms, update to the latest version. If the problem persists, please contact me.\r\n[/list]",
