  "modName": "Erin - Battlemage Follower",
  "summary": "Cute female Breton battlemage to follow you around. **Requires apachii hair** ",
  "descriptionHtml": "I had been looking for a follower that fits my play style and had a certain aesthetic. So instead of searching and searching, I decided to make one. I know there are plenty of excellent follower mods out there, and I have many of them, but it\\'s nice to have one more to your liking.\r\n\r\nErin can be found in the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun. I decided to put her there instead of one of the more clogged up inns to make it easier for the player. \r\n\r\nI\\'m pretty new to the mod world so she\\'s not going to be full of unique scripts that make her do back flips at your beck and call. She does, however, perform well as a follower as intended. I\\'d love feedback and/or constructive criticism. \r\n\r\nSpells: (All left hand cast only) Sparks, Fire Bolt, Ice Spike, and Oakflesh. \r\nI kept the spells simple to minimize spread and aoe that can cause problems for you and other friendlies in the fray. She casts from the left hand to keep her right hand free to swing her sword.\r\nNote: if you teach her new spells they won\\'t be bound to a certain hand.\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s the difference between a Battlemage and a Spellsword? They both favor 1h weapons, heavy armor, destruction, and restoration. The difference is that the battlemage favors melee in close combat while the Spellsword favors magic. They still use both frequently so it\\'s only a small difference. I personally prefer the battlemage.\r\n\r\n[b]Changelog:[/b]\r\n\r\n1.1 Now stand alone. [u]No longer requires Apachii Skyhair.[/u]\r\n\r\n1.0 Initial release. Requires [url=/mods/10168]Apachii Skyhair 1.5full[/url] with the added 1.3 female hair. (I\\'m sure most of you do anyways) You must have both in order to prevent ctds. \r\n\r\n[b]Compatibility:[/b]\r\n\r\nThis mod should be compatible with any follower mods such as [url=/mods/14037]UFO[/url], [url=/mods/12933]EFF[/url], etc.. I personally use EFF (Extensible Follower Framework) \r\n\r\nI used [url=/mods/2666]CBBE 3.2.3[/url] body and face textures to get the look in the screen shots. [u]While it shouldn\\'t be required, your version of Erin may differ from mine if you use something else.[/u]\r\n\r\n\r\n",
