New Beta Has general stores in it. (You will crash without it) No DLC Required. ATM. Must have your Skyrim Up to date and be a Legal Version.

So I was looking for a new player home and came across some other mods I liked. (See credits for details). Wanted to keep the description as short as possible. So I liked them so much I asked the authors if I could make a Larger Castle mod using their mods with mine. They said yes and here we go with my second release of Castle Draco High Hrothgar Edition. A player home with all you will ever need. Now, With auto sorting on the Great Forge and SO MUCH MORE&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][u][b]----Auto Sorting-----[/b][/u][/color]\r<br />   First off, I didn&#39;t make the scripts nor do I fully understand the scripts for the auto sorting. How the sorting works the armor can be sorted with the Dragonbone armor dummy. Weapons have to be manually sorted by placing the items in the weapon sorting rack not sure why the sort all doesn&#39;t work for weapons. The unburden option lets you sort all crafting supplies. It will take some learning to get use to but it is the best sorting system I have seen so far.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][u][b]-----HOW TO Get the Castle. ----[/b][/u][/color] \r<br />\r<br />   [color=yellow][u][b]Complete The GreyBeards Start Quest For The Guardain Golem to give you the Key&#39;s.[/b][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />You must complete the quest and be welcomed as the Dragonborn to get the key from the Golem.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][u][b]Please endorse IF you like.[/b][/u][/color] \r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][u][b]----Features In Castle Draco High Hrothgar Edition version.----[/b][/u][/color] \r<br />Player Home Castle \r<br />Lots of storage \r<br />Lots Of Mannequins \r<br />Lots Of Chest \r<br />Lots of Easter eggs (Look around their is lots to find) \r<br />Treasure Vaults Locked for balance Can be picked master difficult. \r<br />Manniquin Vendors\r<br />Manniquin Staff\r<br />Stone Golem Guards\r<br />MInes\r<br />Custom Sounds\r<br />Shrine to One True God with Custom Blessing\r<br />Children rooms 70 percent done WIP\r<br />Front (Feel it is missing something)\r<br />Better AI for guards and merchants\r<br />Custom Textures Done to my best at this time.\r<br />New Teleport Spell to help you get around.
