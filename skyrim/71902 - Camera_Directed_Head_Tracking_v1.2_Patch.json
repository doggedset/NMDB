  "descriptionHtml": "The camera directed head tracking mod was throwing lots of messages into the Papyrus log about calling SetLookAt() against a none value as seen below.\r<br />\r<br />[12/10/2015 - 09:56:48PM] Error: Cannot look at a None target\r<br />stack:\r<br />[ (00000014)].Actor.SetLookAt() - &#34;&lt;native&gt;&#34; Line ?\r<br />[HeadTrackQuest (54000D63)].HeadTrack.OnUpdate() -Â \r<br />\r<br />My assumption is this call is supposed to clear headtracking which can be done by calling it against the PlayerRef instead. So this patch is just a tweak and recompile of the HeadTrack.pex script with that change. Seems to have fixed it for me and didn&#39;t require any special steps beside dropping the script into the directory.",
