  "summary": "A skeleton that makes males appear buffer in all armors",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is more slight than anything else, but I like it so I figured I would upload it. It basically makes males buffer by modding skeletons. Only works for males.\r\n\r\nInstallation: Merge the data folder with the existing one. If it asks you to replace skeleton.nif, it WILL conflict with a mod that you currently have downloaded. But it will only conflict in the sense that it will change the appearence. I can\\'t see it doing any more than that.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: None that I know of.\r\n\r\nThats kind of it. enjoy!",
