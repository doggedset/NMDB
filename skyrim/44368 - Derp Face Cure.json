  "descriptionHtml": "becouse no one is giving me feedback telling me if the latest version of this mod, the &#39;Legendary Derp Face Cure&#39;, works if you dont have the Skyrim Legendary Edition, the fully completed version of this mod will not be uploaded to the steam workshop, becouse of the small off chance of it crashing your game if you dont have all of the 3 DLC.\r<br />\r<br />after hours of work, this mod is finally finished, this is a texture bug fix for a mod named &#39;Lizards of Skyrim&#39; and what that mod does, is turn every playable race in the game into a argonian.\r<br />\r<br />However, the Lizards of Skyrim mod simply turns every NPC into a argonian, the NPC&#39;s have not been turned into a argonian manually, rezulting in some pepole looking a bit wierd, i have called this phenomenon: &#39;derp face&#39; however, not to be confused to by &#39;derpY face&#39;, just derp face.\r<br />\r<br />what this mod will do, is it will turn NPC&#39;s who have the &#39;derp face&#39; dissease, into normal looking argonians, however, in order to fix this dissease, i need to change every derp faced NPC manually, and im telling you, it took a **** long time.\r<br />\r<br />what the &#39;Derp Face Cure&#39; mod does:\r<br />\r<br />-change the face complexity, so it looks like that of a normal argonian, instead of being all wierd and shiny.\r<br />-change the skin collor, so the head has the same color as the body, and not a brown head, and a green body.\r<br />\r<br />what the &#39;Legendary Derp Face Cure&#39; mod does:\r<br />\r<br />-exactly the same as the normal version\r<br />-removes the hair of 2 Dawnguard DLC NPC&#39;s, that of Searna and that of Valerica (trust me, i had to)\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />current list of places cured from the derp face dissease:\r<br />\r<br />(this mod was initially only ment to be on the steam workshop but uploaded here after it was requested)\r<br />\r<br />main release 18-9-2013\r<br />1) Whiterun\r<br />2) Riften\r<br />3) Sollitude\r<br />4) Windhelm\r<br />\r<br />update 19-9-2013 added:\r<br />5) Riverwood \r<br />6) Falkreath\r<br />7) Ivarstead\r<br />\r<br />update 20-9-2013 added:\r<br />8) Markarth\r<br />9) Left Hand mine\r<br />10) Shor&#39;s stone\r<br />\r<br />update 21-9-2013 added:\r<br />11) Morthal\r<br />12) Rorikstead\r<br />13) Dawnstar\r<br />14) Dragon brige\r<br />15) Winterhold+collage of Winterhold\r<br />16) Darkwater crossing\r<br />17) Red Wave (ship in sollitude docks)\r<br />several misc NPC&#39;s\r<br />\r<br />update 21-9-2013:\r<br />18) hopefully all orcish strongholds.\r<br />updates from here on will only add pepole i find spread around the world, and will not be mentioned.\r<br />\r<br />update 28-9-2013 added:\r<br />ALL non DLC NPC&#39;s.\r<br />this mod is now done, ill start working on a fix for the DLC&#39;s another time...\r<br />for now, enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />13-10-2013\r<br />Derp Face Cure now also avadable here on the Nexus&#33;\r<br />\r<br />but for pepole interested on the steam workshop download, here it is:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=179574138[/URL]Derp Face Cure on the steam workshop[/url]\r<br />\r<br />update 24-10-2013 added:\r<br />all DLC NPC&#39;s, this mod is now truly done, and i should not need to ever look back at it again.\r<br />\r<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />&gt;&gt;REQUIRES&lt;&lt;\r<br />\r<br />the standard &#39;Derp Face Cure&#39;
