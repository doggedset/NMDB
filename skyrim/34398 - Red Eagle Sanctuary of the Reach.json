  "descriptionHtml": "I made this plugin for my game to add a little depth to a boring area in the Reach. I added a Dwemer ruin inhabited by the Bretons that were kicked out of Markarth. They are civilized and wear normal armor & clothing (though some do have facial tattoos). They do business with the Forsworn and anyone else that do not come to fight them. The Sanctuary is located right by &#34;Deep Folk Crossing.&#34; It&#39;s got a map marker and you can fast travel.Â \r<br />\r<br />There is a Dwemer starter house for free; a mine that has gold & ebony ore; a large Dwemer underground area to explore; a smelter, workbench, tanning rack, forge, alchemy and enchanter.\r<br />\r<br />This is a work in progress but very playable. The ruins & inhabitants will grow in time. Merchants, mine, Tavern & bed rental will be coming as time permits.\r<br />\r<br />This plugin has been cleaned with TESVEdit.\r<br />Navmesh checked and follower friendly.\r<br />\r<br />Installation........................................................................................................\r<br />\r<br />NMM should work just fine.\r<br />Manual install: unzip and drop Mesh/Texture and ESP files in Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Any problem let me know.\r<br />\r<br />Bugs: none I know of \r<br />\r<br />Update 2.0-sanctuary size is increased even more and more NPC&#34;s added. Gold & Edony mine added.\r<br />\r<br />Credits: \r<br />The Nexus\r<br />Developers of TES V Edit\r<br />Bethesda",
