  "descriptionHtml": "[b]\r<br />Gabrielle[/b] is found at Dead Man&#39;s Drink in Falkreath. Not too far from the dark brotherhood&#39;s sanctuary. \r<br />\r<br />Info/spec: \r<br />#1 She is marriable \r<br />#2 Non essential NPC (should die) \r<br />#3 She is leveled to your character (ranging from level 15 to 999)\r<br />\r<br />Without disrupting the game quests and avoid rendering save files asunder. Closest thing we can have to the original is a clone, a replication. While it is not original. As in her. Only difference in this case of Gabriella, is that she is not dead. \r<br />\r<br />To be bound together, now and forever. \r<br />\r<br />(Textures and Meshes directories have been included to avoid a character appearance bug. That causes the head of the NPC to not match the body.)",
