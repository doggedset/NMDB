I thought that day &#34;i&#39;ll add a staff that turns everything into a fish&#34;.\r<br />Why i thought that is still mysterious.\r<br />Why Fishes? Because Fuck You, that&#39;s why.\r<br />What exacly the Fisherize does? &#34;A blast from Fisherize that turns everything into a fish. Well except those pesky dragons, Ah&#33; and daedras... they&#39;re bitches you should know it. Anyway they will suffer the rage of the fish with a explosion effect&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />I also added a cape of Fishes that swims arround you and steals life from the foes.\r<br />\r<br />Well i was saying something about the staff... \r<br />What do you call a fish with no eyes?… Fsh.\r<br />\r<br />Ah hell yes so i was getting crazy with this fishy topic and i wanted to make a gigant fish that gives you a mission to obtain the staff.\r<br />\r<br />That wasn&#39;t possible but this mod removes [u]some[/u] usual slaughterfishes and replaces it with a gigant version of them...\r<br />\r<br />Also adds a cave full of angry spirits that are defending the Fisherize.\r<br />\r<br />What do you call a big fish who makes you an offer you can’t refuse?…The Codfather.\r<br />\r<br />We will upload it on steam too click the image to go to the file [/size][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=206888378][img]http://cdn4.store.steampowered.com/public/images/v5/globalheader_logo.png[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]What do you call a Shark with a rocket launcher?… Anything he tells you to.\r<br />Still with doubts about what this shit is?
