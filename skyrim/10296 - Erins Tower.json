  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new home for keen adventurers! Consisting of a big cave various buildings in dwemer architecture, a fully equipped dwarven armory with lots of mannequins and weapon plaques for all your collecting needs!\r\n\r\n______________\r\nTo get access the entrance be on the lookout south of Whiterun at the foot of the mountains facing south towards the great Plains. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that remains after that, is to fight your way through the dungeon.Be careful; Some encounters inside the dungeon might be pretty hard for unexperienced adventurers!\r\n\r\n______________\r\nIn future versions I might add a quest surrounding the events of Erin\\'s absence. Also please feel free to recommend things that might be interesting as additions. \r\n\r\n______________\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\n1. unpack ErinsTower.rar\r\n2. copy the .esp file into your skyrim/data folder\r\n3. at startup select \\\"erin\\'s tower.esp\\\" in the menu \\\"data files\\\"\r\n\r\nhave fun! and be shure to leave me a comment here!\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nMelioth\r\n\r\n",
