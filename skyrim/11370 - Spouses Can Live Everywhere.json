  "descriptionHtml": "Ver: 0.9.1 BETA\r<br />\r<br />Cathegory: Followers and houses\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />Author: Amgepo, Emma\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: This mod does not cater for Hearthfire children, as this would require making the mod dependant on the Heartfire DLC&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />--------------\r<br />\r<br />With this mod, you can settle down with your spouse wherever you want - in houses added by other mods, a vanilla shack, a dungeon or even on the road. Yes, if your spouse annoys you, you can even send him/her to live in a prison or under a bridge... The options are unlimited, and your spouse will have the same AI-packages and vendor features as in vanilla homes.\r<br />\r<br />Still, the main purpose with this mod is of course to make spouses live in houses from mods the same way they do in vanilla houses.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />How does it work?\r<br />----------------------\r<br />\r<br />A new lesser power (Mark New Home) will be added to your character&#39;s Spells list. You activate it from the spells list, and you cast it with the z-key (like a shout).\r<br />\r<br />Each time you use the &#34;Mark New Home&#34;-power, the place you are in will be set as a potential new home for your spouse (a message in the upper left corner will confirm that it worked). \r<br />However, you should also talk to your spouse. When you ask your spouse to move to a new place, a new option has been added that allows you to say that you have a new home to share with him/her. \r<br />\r<br />If you choose this option,  your spouse will go to live in the place you have selected with the &#34;Mark New Home&#34;-power. \r<br />If you have forgotten to cast the power before talking to your spouse, he/she will, if not in following-mode, wander off to the default-destination which is the Temple of Mara in Riften. \r<br />However, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Once you have told your spouse that he/she is supposed to live in your &#34;new home&#34;, he/she will automatically relocate to any place where you cast the &#34;Mark New Home&#34;-power.  \r<br />\r<br />So, if you miss your lifetime companion and is currently in a far away location, you can still cast the &#34;Mark New Home&#34;-power, and the spouse will travel to you. (If you are far away from him/her the travel can take some time, though - spouses aren&#39;t very fast in their movements).\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Changelog:\r<br />0.9: Initial beta release\r<br />0.9.1: A little fix, increasing the AI radius to make spouses interact better with huge homes.\r<br />\r<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />French version available [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62029/?]here[/url]",
