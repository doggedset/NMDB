  "descriptionHtml": "I thought that the BEAST Races in Skyrim should look like Beasts, so I changed the Skeletonbeast.nif. First I wanted to change the complete Body (what should have looked better) but 3ds Max only exported a .nif file with wrong bone mapping.\r\nIf someone knows how to change the malebody.nif and export it correctly, please tell me how to.\r\n\r\nThe .esp is there because I made the Skeleton smaller to make the legs bigger (It doesn\\'t look really good ...) and I needed to make the Body bigger again (changed the scale of ArgonianRace, ArgonianRaceVampire, KhajitRace and KhajiitRace skeleton).\r\n\r\nThere are more than one file, because I changes the Collision Box to fit to the new Body. If you have problems, download the other on please.\r\nThe third and fourth file is a smaller Body, so if you think your character is too big download this one.\r\n\r\nAnd one thing: The Arms are longer, so maybe you arms stuck somewhere while sitting somewhere. And the weapon draw looks a bit strange too, and I hope the weapons are correctly sized.",
