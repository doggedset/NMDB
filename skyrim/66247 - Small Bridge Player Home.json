  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a small player home underneath the bridge of Whiterun. Easy to access and easy to learn where the key is after reading a soggy journal on the doorstep. Find the key and gain a new home with storage space and a bed.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my first mods, and was made to learn the process of using the creation kit. Please save your game before using the storage spaces (although they should be safe) and let me know if anything is wrong.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INSTALLATION:\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extract to the data folder and make sure its checked from the Skyrim launcher.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO REQUIREMENTS:\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than an up to date Skyrim.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONFLICTS:\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should only conflict with other mods that use the same space. (Whiterun bridge and a small spot by the river opposite Riverwood).\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also run JK&#39;s Writerun and this does not conflict with it.",
