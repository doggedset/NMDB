  "modName": "Instant Camera POV switching",
  "summary": "Eliminates the \\\"slow zoom in/out\\\" effect when switching POV and mounting/dismounting horses.",
  "descriptionHtml": "IMPORTANT NOTE: This was a very early \\\"hack\\\" mod made before the Construction Kit was released. Due to possible game patches/updates, this may or may not work for your game.\r\n\r\nI found it really annoying that if I was zoomed out in 3rd person for exploring, then ran into enemies and pressed F to switch to 1st person, the camera would ever so slowly zoom in to my character before I was back in 1st person. Similarly, when dismounting a horse to engage in a fight the camera took it\\'s sweet time to get back to where it belonged. These tweaks will do 3 things:\r\n\r\n1. Pressing F will now instantly switch between 1st and 3rd person POV.\r\n\r\n2. Pressing F while in 3rd person zoomed-out mode will instantly switch to 1st person POV.\r\n\r\n3. When mounting and dismounting a horse, the camera POV will switch instantly (You\\'ll still see the mount/dismount animation, but there is no delay before or after while the camera \\\"flies\\\" to the correct position).\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n*Updated to v1.1 to fix game not remembering 3rd person camera position.*",
