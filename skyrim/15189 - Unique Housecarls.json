  "descriptionHtml": "===Information===\r\nThis is an update of my original mod Diverse Housecarls. I have decided to start over new because this is a new plugin, rewritten from the start. Its basically the same but should cut down any issues caused by the recent updates of the game.\r\nI found my housecarls not working properly, glitching out and freezing in attack positions since the update so an update to the original wasnt an option.\r\n\r\n---Not compatible with Better Followers---\r\n\r\n===Description===\r\n\r\nThe aim of this mod is to add lore friendly variations to all the housecarl followers. I was fed up with each of them being basic clones of each other, same loadout, same skills same everything!\r\nSo I revised them all, all their combat skills and styles, armor, stats and spells.\r\n\r\nMarkarth : Argis : Dwarven Armor & Weapons : 1 handed combat, sword and board.\r\nRiften : Iona : Leather Armor : Steel Weapons, dual wielding & ranged.\r\nSolitude : Jordis : Steel Plate : Steel Sword & Spellsword Combat\r\nWhiterun : Lydia : Leather Armor : Steel Sword and Nightblade combat (same as Irileth)\r\nWindhelm : Calder : Iron Banded Armor : Steel Greatsword & 2handed combat style\r\n\r\nI\\'m hoping this will make each housecarl a little more interesting and useable. Mine mostly sit around the house doing nothing because one is as good as the other.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please feel free to leave feedback and suggestions. ",
