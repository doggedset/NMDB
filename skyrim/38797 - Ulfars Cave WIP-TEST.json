  "summary": "Test for my new dungeon I am making.",
  "descriptionHtml": "To access the dungeon either log in to a character or at the main menu press ~/` key next to the 1/! key and to open the Console Command type in COC Ulfarscave. It should work.\r\n\r\nAll this is right now is a layout and lighting for the dungeon I am making.\r\nWhat I\\'d like people to help with is to look at all the lighting and keep in mind that I made this with RLO, ULO, and CoT being used and recommend to use them. The lighting looks fine for me but for those who don\\'t use those three mods let me know.\r\n\r\nAlso look for Popping Textures or bugs or glitches please. (I have looked and believe all is fixed).\r\n\r\nAny other feedback would be nice!\r\n\r\nThe download is manual. Just download the file and put it in your Data folder for skyrim with the rest of your mods.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37846/? ULO\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30450/? RLO\r\n(MAKE SURE TO GET THE COMPATIBILITY PATCHS FOR RLO AND ULO)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17802//? COT",
