  "summary": "Replaces the Serpentine Dragon\\'s mesh with the Dragonborn DLC with the Ancient Dragon\\'s instead.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Well, this is a pretty simple mod really so I\\'ll keep this short: This mod replaces the Serpentine Dragons added to the Dragonborn DLC with Ancient Dragons (mesh only). It goes without saying that you need the Dragonborn DLC for this mod to work.\r\n\r\nSerpentine dragons are the blue dragons with what looks like a super incredibly low res texture, no horns, and a much more smooth skin - I hate how they look personally, and thus... this mod.\r\n\r\nAll I\\'ve done is replaced their mesh with the Ancient Dragon\\'s mesh from the Skyrim bsa. It\\'s a simple mod. There shouldn\\'t be any problems. It should be compatible with any texture replacers you may be using for ancient dragons as well, so if has a different texture then that\\'s probably why.",
