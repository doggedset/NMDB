  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/7020/falkreath.png[/img]\r<br />The War of the Five Kings just began. Eddard Stark was unjustly accused of treason against the kingdom was executed. King Robert Baratheon died in a accident during a hunt. Robb Stark, the son of the former Hand of the King, has declared war to the Kingdom and currently leads his troops to the West. He teamed up with Stannis Baratheon, this one having discovered that Joffrey Baratheon was the result of an incestuous relationship between Cersei Lannister and her brother, Jaime Lannister. Many houses have jumped at the opportunity to ally with the king Joffrey to have benefits, while others have declared their independence. Westeros is divided. But further east, the descendant of an ancient royal line seeks to regain his kingdom. Some even say that she has dragons ... \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img842.imageshack.us/img842/3687/x9z0.png[/img]\r<br />- Now Skyrim is Westeros, with the cities and locations from the books and series. Windhelm is now Winterfell, Solitude is Casterly Rock, Whiterun is King&#39;s Landing, Winterhold is Castleblack, etc...\r<br />- Even some Map Markers icons have been changed to fit with the place. For example, Winterhold aka Castleblack&#39;s icon is now a Fort icon, while Dawnstar aka White Harbor&#39;s icon is a Ship icon.\r<br />- Armors and weapons from the show (and some inspired  by description of the books) have been bringed to the game.\r<br />- Factions and Guilds have been changed.  You can join the Stark side or the Lannister side, and even join organisations like Maester&#39;s Citadel, Faceless Men or Golden Company.\r<br />- Npcs have been changed, with Ulfric now being Robb Stark or General Tullius being Tywin Lannister. There are even new followers, like Beric Dondarrion, Anguy the Archer and Thoros of Myr &#33;\r<br />- Quests and items have been renamed. However, not all quests objectives have been changed, the quest conversion is still WIP.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/2645/sonsofskyrim.png[/img]\r<br />* Possible crash when equiped Lannister Armor\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img203.imageshack.us/img203/4816/5rwg.png[/img]\r<br />First, download and extract files to your SkyrimData folder.
