With this mod, you won\\'t have to run all the way up to Dragonsreach just to enchant your items. \r\n\r\nVersion: 1.2\r\nAuthor: WarriorG0el\r\n\r\nI love clear feedback, good or bad! Let me know if there\\'s anything else you\\'d like to see in this mod, or any bugs that I can fix.\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n1.0 (Release) - Added Enchanting Table to Breezehome.\r\n1.1 - Added 2 Common (Filled) soul gems to the enchanting table. Confirmed rare random alchemy satchel spawns on alchemy table.\r\n1.11 - Fixed bug where soul gems and stands would appear before alchemy lab was purchased.\r\n1.12 - Fixed bug where a second Enchanting table was appearing in the Breezehome bedroom whether decorations were purchased or not.\r\n1.2 - Added some mood lighting to the candles.\r\n\r\nThanks very much!\r\n\r\nOther WG Mods:\r\n\r\nItem Rewards For Bounties:  Adds a random leveled item as a reward upon quest completion, and changes bounty rewards to 250 gold for Bandits/Forsworn, 500 gold for Giants and 750 gold for dragons. \r\n\r\nUndying Companions: Makes all companions essential, meaning they cannot die by friendly or hostile damage. Exceptions: Erandur, Cicero and Eola.\r\n\r\nEnhanced Alchemy XP - Slightly increases Alchemy XP gain rate (20%) to balance with other skills such as Smithing. Still balanced, more fun.\r\n\r\nImproved Imperial Racial Abilities - Changes Voice of the Emperor ability to a +10 Speech bonus for people like me who never use Voice of the Emperor when they roll Imperial characters.\r\n\r\nGIANT Animals - Makes all animals, plus trolls, 3x bigger than normal. Just subscribe and walk around Skyrim - it\\'s GREAT for kicks.\r\n\r\nVisible Slaughterfish - Makes only slaughterfish 3x bigger so you can see them more easily.\r\n\r\nEvil Slaughterfish - Makes slaughterfish much more dangerous: 3x damage, 2.5x speed, 3.1x attack chance and 2x health.\r\n\r\nSkyscraper Giants - Makes giants 3x bigger.\r\n\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/WarriorG0el/myworkshopfiles/",
