  "descriptionHtml": "Make your flame and storm atronachs fight up close, no more hiding behind you.\r<br />\r<br />Melee Atronach reduces the magicka available to flame and storm atronachs, they will continue to cast spells but will now use their full range of abilities. You can expect your atronachs to inflict more damage, protect you better, and put on a better show.\r<br />This mod adds a lesser power to the player called &#34;Atronach - Ranged&#34; for temporarily boosting magicka, restoring old behaviour.\r<br />\r<br />Atronachs summoned by NPCs are not affected.\r<br />Contains a number of bug fixes for atronachs. \r<br />\r<br />Install\r<br />=======\r<br />Put MeleeAtronach.esp and MeleeAtronach.bsa in your data folder\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall\r<br />=========\r<br />Remove MeleeAtronach.esp and MeleeAtronach.bsa from your data folder\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts / Load Order\r<br />======================\r<br />Melee Atronach changes the entries for atronachs and the flame atronach race, it should be loaded after anything that changes these. Anything that changes spell costs for all NPCs will break Melee Atronach.\r<br />\r<br />Contact\r<br />=======\r<br />Please post any issues you have on the comments page, that way I will never see them and never fix the problem. Whatever you do, do not use the contact uploader button on nexusmods, you wouldn&#39;t want to actually get a response. Another terrible idea would be to email me at al.durand@gmail.com, that would save you from having to register on the nexus forums. \r<br />\r<br />License\r<br />=======\r<br />To the extent possible under law, Alexander Durand has waived all copyright and related or neighbouring rights to MeleeAtronach.
