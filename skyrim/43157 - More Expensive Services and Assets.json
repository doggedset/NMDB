  "modId": 43157.0,
  "modName": "More Expensive Services and Assets",
  "summary": "Increased the cost of inns, carriages, horses, houses and furniture.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This very simple mod does just what it says on the tin: increase the costs of assets and services in Skyrim to be on a somewhat more realistic level. There are boatloads of mods out there that attempt to solve the issue of gold being worth nothing by making trading with merchants harder, but this throws the economy way out of balance in terms of realism, resulting in silly things like a potion being worth more than a house.\r\n\r\nWith this mod, I made the following changes to services:\r\n\r\nInn Room: 150g\r\nCarriage: 250/400g\r\nSellsword Hire: 1000g\r\nHorse: 2500g\r\n\r\nI also substantially increased the price of houses and furniture. Purchasing all of a houses upgrades should cost just shy of half the houses purchase price.\r\n\r\nBreezehome\r\n\r\nPurchase Price: 15000g\r\nAlchemy Lab: 1500g\r\nBedroom, Kitchen, Child\\'s Room: 1000g\r\nLiving Room, Dining Room, Loft: 750g\r\n\r\nHoneyside\r\n\r\nPurchase Price: 20000g\r\nAlchemy, Enchanting: 2000g\r\nBedroom, Kitchen, Child\\'s Room: 1500g\r\nPorch, Garden: 1000g\r\n\r\nVlindrel Hall:\r\n\r\nPurchase Price: 25000g\r\nAlchemy, Enchanting: 2500g\r\nBedroom, Kitchen, Child\\'s Room: 2000g\r\nLiving Room, Hall: 1500g\r\n\r\nHjerim\r\n\r\nPurchase Price: 40000g\r\nArmory: 5000g\r\nAlchemy, Enchanting: 2500g\r\nBedroom, Kitchen, Child\\'s Room: 3000g\r\nLiving Room: 2000g\r\n\r\nProudspire Manor\r\n\r\nPurchase Price: 50000g\r\nAlchemy, Enchanting: 4000g\r\nBedroom, Child\\'s Room: 3500g\r\nLiving Room, Kitchen: 3000g\r\n Patio: 2500g\r\n\r\n\r\nHearthfire Manors:\r\n\r\nLand cost: 35000g\r\nMain Hall: 7500g\r\nSmall House: 5000g\r\nEntrance Hall, Single-Story Wings: 2500g\r\nBalcony Wings: 3000g\r\nTower Wings: 3500g\r\n\r\nNote that the costs for all but land only apply if you choose to furnish the home through a steward; it\\'s free to build the furniture yourself.\r\n\r\nHearthfire Extras:\r\n\r\nCarriage: 5000g\r\nChicken: 250g\r\nCow: 1000g\r\nLogs: 1000g\r\nStone: 500g\r\nClay: 200g\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you need a place to stay while saving up for a house, remember that the Alchemy Shack near Ivastead can serve as a free starter home; the nightstand next to the bed is a safe storage container.\r\n\r\nThis mod changes only global variables and will not conflict with mods that change the function of things; such as horse mods or follower mods, unless they happen to alter the price globals as well. If in doubt simply load my mod BEFORE theirs, worst case scenario is that my prices will be overwritten by theirs.\r\n\r\nI believe that this mod will only work on a new game. Sorry for any confusion I caused.\r\n\r\nSuggested Mods:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34612//?]Kryptopyr\\'s Trade and Barter[/url] - Fully customizable mod that changes all things related to merchants. Complements my mod very well!\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24758//?]Svartberg\\'s Increased Bounty and Guild Rewards[/url] - Allows you to actually make a living as a hero instead of a peddler.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25029//?]Perseid\\'s Inns and Taverns[/url] - Allows you to use any inn as a temporary home while saving for a house.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28329//?]Manaflow\\'s Travel Mounts[/url] - Make horses worth the investment!",
