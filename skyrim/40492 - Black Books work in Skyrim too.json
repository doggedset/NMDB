  "modName": "Black Books work in Skyrim too",
  "summary": "Makes the Black Books from Dragonborn work in Skyrim as well.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I find it strange that you can only reach Apocrypha from Solstheim.  This mod changes that, so the Black Books work from Skyrim as well.  Why would you want that?  [s]STORAGE.  There are many containers in Apocrypha, and I believe they are all safe.[/s]  Access to the Dragonborn perks without having to travel to Soltheim first, as well.\r\n\r\nThis mod replaces a single script, DLC2BookDungeonControllerScript.  All I did was comment out a few of the lines that check to see if you\\'re in Apocrypha or Solstheim, so now it is assumed that if you\\'re not in Apocrypha, then you\\'re good to go.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:  Because this is just a change of a script, NO ESP IS REQUIRED.  Just unzip and drop the PEX file in your skyrim/data/scripts folder and you\\'re ready to go.  The other file is the source code, showing the changes I made (the lines that start with double-semi-colons), and you can just ignore it.\r\n\r\nOr just use NMM. \r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION:  Delete the script from your skyrim/data/scripts folder.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:  Dragonborn.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25068//?]Placeable Statics[/url].  Apocrypha makes a pretty interesting player home.  Rather short on furniture and equipment, but all that can be added with Placeable Statics.  I\\'m sure Hermaeus Mora makes an exciting roommate, as well.\r\n\r\nBUGS: Report them as you find them!\r\n\r\nPICS: If you do make your player home on Apocrypha, please share some pics!  I\\'d love to see what chaos I\\'ve influcted on ol\\' Hermaeus.",
