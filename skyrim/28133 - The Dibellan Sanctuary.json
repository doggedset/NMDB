  "descriptionHtml": "Are you a worshipper of Dibella? A believer in the dibellan arts? Did not the temple in Markarth accept you? Well, then this house might just be for you.\r\n\r\n==============\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThis is a player home, based on dwemer architecture and Dibella as theme. It\\'s a house equipped with most things you need. Only thing you might miss is the smithing gear, such as Anvil, smelter, tanning rack and grindstone.\r\nOtherwise, it got plenty of storage, a few weapon racks, alchemy table and enchanting tables. It also got a cooking pot, fiest table, plenty of food and potions for most of your needs. \r\n\r\n=============\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n=============\r\n\r\nJust simply unzip the file, and drop the \\\"Dwemer home main.esp\\\" in your data folder, check the box in \\\"Data files\\\" in the Skyrim launcher.\r\n\r\n==============\r\nCOMPATIBILITY\r\n==============\r\n\r\nShould be compatible with any mod that does not alter the same area\r\n\r\n==========\r\nLOCATION\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThe house is located on the north shore or the lake between Falkreath and Riverwood.\r\n\r\n==========\r\nEND NOTE\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThis is my first ever mod in the Creation Kit, and my first experience using it. I will try doing a bug fix if necessary.\r\nAnd for any grammatical errors or misspellings, sorry, I\\'m 100% Swedish.\r\n\r\n===========\r\nVERSION 1.1\r\n===========\r\n\r\nBasically fixed some navmeshing, removed the tree clipping on the house exterior, and turned two chests the right way. Any problems, please report! Removed old version. If you downloaded the first version, take anything you have in house, before switching to this one, just in case!\r\n\r\n============================\r\nREVIEW VID FROM OTHER USER\r\n============================\r\n\r\nReview by MrBiggenGaming\r\n[URL=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTZlT_ZuPig]MrBiggenGaming[/URL]\r\n\r\n[youtube]wTZlT_ZuPig[/youtube]",
