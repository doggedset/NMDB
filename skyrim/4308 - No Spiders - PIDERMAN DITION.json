  "summary": "A model, texture, and sound replacer for all spiders in Skyrim.  For those who are arachnophobic, or just want to try something a little weird.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Unlike the other spider replacer, this one has been weighted to the spider\\'s skeleton.  All animations should function properly for the most part, though it looks weird as hell.  The arms and legs have been rigged (roughly) to four of the spider\\'s legs.  Sounds have been replaced with recordings from the \\'Baman Piderman\\' web series.  A loading screen model replacer is also included.\r\n\r\nAudio may be a little buggy with low volume for some sounds.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nCopy the data folder in the archive to your Skyrim folder.\r\nIn the launcher, ensure that \\'Load Loose Files\\' is checked.",
