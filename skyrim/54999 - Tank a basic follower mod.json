  "descriptionHtml": "Description:Please Read&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Tank is a basic follower mod that i have decided to create. He is Not custom voiced but is very good at fighting. I have tested him out a little more this time and seems to work better. I use Skyre so i&#39;m not sure if he will die as often as some Skyre players. Please tell me :D.\r<br />\r<br />Instillation: I highly recommend NMM as it is how I installed this.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation: Dismiss Tank and uninstall the mod.\r<br />\r<br />Location: You can find him in Riverwood. I felt that Faendal and Sven weren&#39;t very good starter followers. He is very tough for the beginning but once it gets to the dragons i&#39;m sure you will need to give him better armor.\r<br />\r<br />Known issues: None so far. If you have any issues, please let me know and I will try to fix them as soon as i can.\r<br />\r<br />Acknowledgements: Sinzora helped me when I needed it. Nothing was taken from Sinzora during this mod.\r<br />\r<br />I have made this great mod as well http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56243/?\r<br />\r<br />[Color=turquoise]#TweakTeam[/color]\r<br />\r<br />",
