  "descriptionHtml": "This mod organizes both sides of the Civil War&#39;s equipment to better suit armies and what&#39;s said ingame.\r<br />\r<br />Most of the mod is focused towards to the Imperials because Stormcloaks didn&#39;t really have much to fix aside from separating bows to make the archer role a spawn and giving the Stormcloak officers their helmets While the Legion had no one bar Officers and Hadvar in Heavy even though practically everyone is saying otherwise.\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda&#39;s classifying the Imperial Armor you get from being outfitted.\r<br />Heavy:    Imperial Helm, Imperial Boots, Imperial Shield, Imperial Bracers and  Imperial Armor\r<br />Medium: Imperial Light Helmet, Imperial Light Boots, Imperial Shield, Imperial Light Bracers and Studded Imperial Armor\r<br />Light:     Imperial Light Helmet, Imperial Light Boots, Imperial Light Shield, Imperial Light Bracers and Imperial Light Armor\r<br />\r<br />To Simplify\r<br />Heavy = Infantry. Medium = Archer/Marine. Light = Scout/Courier. \r<br />Cavalry = Heavy with the full Helm. Officer/Legate = Heavy with Officer Helm.\r<br />\r<br />Stormcloaks don&#39;t have much in terms of equipment organisation with only really Officers and then everyone else. But did sort out the Archers getting their own Ai instead of everyone getting the same weapons and ai and also created a shield so they could wear Ulfrics banner on their shield.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Quotes regarding certain Imperial armours within the game. \r<br />Imperial Light Armour. \r<br />&#34;For your sake, I hope you took that armor from a dead Imperial scout...&#34; Stormcloaks Sided Guard \r<br />&#34;Judging by your armor, I&#39;d say you&#39;re an Imperial scout. If so, well met.&#34; Imperial sided Guard \r<br />&#34;Light armor for scouting detail&#34; Beirand. \r<br />Imperial Heavy armour reference. \r<br />&#34;Legion soldiers gleam like fresh fallen snow and clank like a kitchen. They head this way, we&#39;ll know it.&#34; Stormcloak Soldier. \r<br />&#34;This armor is damn heavy&#34; Imperial Soldier \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The Imperial Legionnaires will now be equipped (listing armor and weapons)\r<br />Infantry: Imperial Armor, Imperial helmet, Imperial Boots, Imperial Bracers, Imperial Sword, Imperial Shield and Steel dagger,\r<br />Archer: Studded Imperial Armor, Imperial Light Boots, Gauntlets and Helmet, Steel Dagger, Steel Arrows, Imperial Bow and Imperial Sword.\r<br />\r<br />Those that appear in the Scout encounter/Courier\r<br />Imperial Light Helmet, Armor, Boots, Gauntlets and Shield, Imperial Sword, Steel arrows, Imperial bow and steel dagger.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Choose one ESP you only require one.\r<br />[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Things changed.[/size][/b]   (Readme will contain the changes related to the version you have downloaded)\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/elderscrolls/images/8/82/TESV_Banner_Legion.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff0000]Imperial Legion[/color]/ East Empire Company Mercenaries[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Light Armour replaced with Heavy on General Tullius. (He&#39;s the General he should be wearing the best armour available and he&#39;s better skilled with heavy then light) \r<br />Leveled lists for Imperial Solders and Guards allowing Heavy Armour and Imperial Studded to be chosen with their corresponding role. \r<br />Imperial Light moved to Imperial Couriers and the Legionary&#39;s in the scout encounter. \r<br />The armour that the Legionary&#39;s wear will determine what weapon they use for example if they spawn in heavy armour they will be using the Imperial sword and Imperial heavy shield but if they spawn in Imperial Studded they will be using a bow. \r<br />\r<br />The Soldiers using CWImpeialSoldierGear have been given a new Leveled list CWSoldierImperialGearNotGuard/Archer to avoid any comparability issues with Guard equipment and to keep the weapons tied to the soldiers armor. \r<br />The Castle Dour guards have been added Imperial Heavy. Tight space would be bad for fighting with bow&#39;s. \r<br />Fort Commanders have been given Imperial Heavy with Officer Helmet so they look like the commanding officer of the fort. \r<br />\r<br />Hadvar has been added Imperial heavy with no helmet to better explain from going from Imperial studded to Imperial heavy the next time you see him. \r<br />Tullius has had an Imperial Shield added a General going around without a shield during a Civil War just asking for a Sniper to take him out.\r<br />The Legates have been had their bow&#39;s removed and shields added. Rikke keeps her Steel sword but has an Imperial Shield instead of Steel one.\r<br />The Cart drivers in the opening have been given heavy armor due to their proximity to the General and that they stay near him later in Helgan. \r<br />The Prison Guards of Dawnstar, Windhelm, Riften(When the Imperials have taken over) and Solitude have been given heavy armor and those with the key have been given the no helmet version unless there is only one version then the will all wear helmets like Windhelm for example.\r<br />\r<br />Renamed the guards at Castle Dour to &#34;Castle Dour Guard&#34;. (Only in &#34;Imperial Legionary&#39;s Organised&#34; file not in the others)\r<br />East Empire Company Mercanary&#39;s have been given their own outfit.  (Not in &#34;Imperial Legionary&#39;s Organised Just Soldiers&#34;) \r<br />Dragon Bridge guards have been added Imperial gear to suit their names of Imperial Soldiers. (Only in &#34;Imperial Legionary&#39;s Organised&#34; not in the other two  files) \r<br />Imperial Bodyguards now wear only full heavy. (Rexus will have full Imperial heavy. For a guard of a *Spoiler* he seemed under armoured)\r<br />The Imperial Soldiers have been a given its own outfit to help avoid the Heroic Imperial(Immersive Armors) appearing on the non-command Legionaries.\r<br />Marines/EEC Merc have their own Leveled list gear.(i.e CWSoldierImperiailGearMarines) It will decide between 1h with bow and 1h with shield.\r<br />Imperial Battlemages now spawn. Battlemages use Apprentice level spells from the Schools of Alteration, Destruction, Conjuration and Restoration. Battlemages should spawn more often then Stormcloak Spellswords but less the Imperial Archers and Legionnaires.\r<br />Imperial Soldiers have had some renaming allowing for Imperial Legionnaires, Imperial Archers and Imperial Scouts to appear.\r<br />\r<br />The Legion now has its own captain spawning. The Imperial Praefect uses Imperial Heavy with either a steel greatswords or Imperial Sword with Shield.\r<br />The Imperial Legion has had their racial and gender diversity to better suit what is said in the Lore and ingame(Morrowind not Oblivion since that is the Imperial Watch) the Races of Bosmer, Altmer and Orsimer will only appear in one role but\r<br />The Imperial Controlled forts will now have mounted patrols starting from said fort to a city or settlement within the same hold. The mounted NPC is called an Imperial Equite. \r<br />Fort Sungard has an extra patrol that is on foot but double the size of normal patrol to emphasize the danger in the Reach for the Imperial Legion considering the Reachs Terrain with Forsworn and the Stormcloak Rebellion. \r<br />\r<br />Imperial Quartermasters can now appear in different genders and races. (races being all humans and orcs)\r<br />Fort Commanders and the Imperial Praefect have been given the voice of Commander and a racelist which chooses their gender.\r<br />Khajiit and Argonians have been added to a new character list that works for Forts and military camps while also being added to the scout encounter. They will appear in Medium with heavy shield at forts and camps to show some form of light infantry. (Skyrim&#39;s civil war battles always seem to be sieges and the encounter with Imperials and Stormcloaks look more like two patrols and just encountered each other)\r<br />Patrols from Greymoor to Whitewatch tower and Dunstad to Agnas Mill have been added.\r<br />\r<br />[img]https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/80/ac/c3/80acc3139d4a3b4d6a105b8cbff151e3.jpg[/img]\r<br />[b]\r<br />[color=#0000ff]Stormcloaks[/color][/b]\r<br />Stormcloak officers have had they weapons specialized and been given the outfit of their armour with the head piece.\r<br />Stormcloaks that spawn with a one hand and a shield will have a chance to have a Stormcloak shield. (just a duplicated and renamed Windhelm Guard shield. They needed at least a shield with their symbol on it.)\r<br />Stormcloak Spellswords will now spawn for the Stormcloaks. The Spellswords use Apprentice level spells from the Schools of Alteration, Destruction, Illusion and Restoration. Spellswords should not spawn as much as Imperial Battlemages.\r<br />Stormcloak Soldiers have had some renaming allowing Stormcloak Archers and Stormcloak Scouts to appear.\r<br />Stormcloaks have had their own Captain added to the spawns for Civil War encounters. (Fyrir was from a friend since I know more about the Romans then the Norse) \r<br />\r<br />Non-Garrisoned(Cities) Stormcloaks have been given their own leveled lists and one of those two an outfit so they will equip a shield at camp and forts.\r<br />Patrols have been added to the Stormcloak controlled civil war forts. Due to what the Nords are based on the Stormcloaks get less mounted patrols and more patrols on foot. (Greymoor, Dunstad and Sungard are the only forts with a mounted patrol. what would have been a mounted patrol elsewhere is now a foot patrol for the Stormcloaks)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />That which counts for Both\r<br />Imperial and Stormcloak Soldier corpses will now actually have weapons. Seemed a bit odd to die without their weapons scavengers can&#39;t have been there if they still have their armour.\r<br />NPC&#39;s race spawn chosen by the leveled races have been altered to give the correct AI in the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloak spawn so those that spawn with a bow favor ranged fighting compared to their melee loving counterparts.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Things that are currently being worked on.[/b]\r<br />Scout patrols\r<br />Patrols to borders.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Things possibly Subject to change\r<br />[/b]*None just yet*\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]The Leveled lists. Altered or Added[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Created a ArmorImperialHeavySetNoShield for the cart drivers so they do the checklist animation during the games intro since them wearing a shield wouldn&#39;t let the animation play. Rexus also uses this.\r<br />CWSoldierImperialGearNotGuard: Created so the Imperial Soldiers gear choosing their weapons won&#39;t conflict with the Imperial Holds that didn&#39;t rebel and compatibility to any mod that has guards using CWSoldierImperialGear)\r<br />CWSoldierSonsGearSoldier: Used by the Stormcloak Soldiers really just has the bow and arrows removed so the AI actually works with their equipment.\r<br />CWSoldierSonsGearArcher: made for the Archers that spawn on the Stormcloaks side.\r<br />LitemSoldierSonsShield: Added *Stormcloak Shield.\r<br />CWSoldierImperialGearArcher: Created to give the Archers their arrows without having that one arrow just spawning and infinite arrows for all.\r<br />CWSoldierImperialGearMarine: same as notguard but Imperial weapons are removed for the one below this is choosing its weapons\r<br />LItemSoldierImperialMaineWeaponAny: Choses from the below for the Marines weapons\r<br />LitemSolderImperialMaine: Allowing for the Maines to have a varied equipment(1h and shield/1h and bow)\r<br />OutfitSoldierImpeiralArcherMedium: Leveled list for same name just with armour type listed on it same for the three below this.\r<br />OutfitSoldierImperialArcherMediumNoHelmet Same as above\r<br />OutfitSoldierImperialHeavy Same as above\r<br />OutfitSoldierImperialHeavyNoHelmet Same as above\r<br />CWEImperialCaptainWeapons: Imperial Captain Leveled Lists\r<br />CWEImperialCaptain1handShield: Same as above\r<br />CWESoldierImperialGearCaptain: Same as above\r<br />LItemSoldierSonsWeaponAnyCaptain: Stormcloak Captain Leveled Lists.\r<br />LItemSoldierSonsWeapon1hCaptain: Same as above\r<br />LItemSoldierSonsWeapon2hCaptain: Same as above\r<br />LItemSoldierSonsGuardWeapon1hCaptain: Same as above\r<br />LItemSoldierSonsShieldCaptain: Same as above\r<br />CWSolderSonsGearCaptain: Same as above\r<br />CWESoldierSonsGearOneHanded: allows for the Stormcloaks with the outfit that allows for shields to have onehanded weapons to go with it,\r<br />CWESoldierSonsGearTwoHanded Same as above but with the use of twohanded weapons and no new outfit.\r<br />*check Item Created for what this is.\r<br />\r<br />Reverted (i.e Outdated and removed changes)\r<br />\r<br />CWSoldierImperialGearNoTorch/NoTorchNoBow: removed the Imperial weapons so the armour would determine the weapons.\r<br />ArmourImperialHeavySet/NoHelmet: Added Imperial Sword and Imperial Heavy Shield. \r<br />ArmourImperialStuddedSet/NoHelmet: Added Imperial Bow and Steel Arrows. \r<br />ArmourImperialLightSet: Added Imperial Bow, Steel Arrows, Sword and Imperial Light Shield. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Outfits Added or Altered.[/b]\r<br />ArmorImperialCavalry: Outfit for the Imperial Equites.\r<br />ArmorImperialMarine: One of the EEC Merc&#39;s Outfits\r<br />ArmorImperialMage: Used on the two in Helgen and on the Imperial Battlemages.\r<br />ArmorStormcloakMage: Used on the Stormcloak Spellswords\r<br />OutfitListSoldierImperial/NoHelmet: Removed Light Armour and added Heavy armour. \r<br />OutfitListSoldierImperialOfficerTullius/NoHelmet: Removed the light armor gauntlets and boots and added the Heavy versions of them.
