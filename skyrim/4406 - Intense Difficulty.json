  "descriptionHtml": "***INSTALLATION***\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager (NMM) Installation (www.skyrimnexus.com/content/modmanager):\r\na)  Download through NMM, and activate there.\r\nb)  Follow as from 3) below\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\n1) Unzip the files to a directory of your choosing.\r\n2) Move the ESP file \\'Intense Difficulty 2x\\' into the Data directory of your Skyrim installation (located inside the steam folder, under steamapps/common/skyrim).\r\n3) When starting Skyrim, click on data files, and make sure the \\'Intense Difficulty 2x.esp\\' is checked.\r\n4) Run Skyrim!\r\n\r\nOnly activate one plug-in at a time! See the file list below for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n***BASICS***\r\nIncreases the multipliers to make master significantly more difficult.  Really, ideally used if you want to use the game to it\\'s utmost; ie, exploiting alchemy, enchanting, and smithing to get high-end equipment.\r\n\r\nIf you like it, take a look at my other mod - PISE: Pluto\\'s Improved Skyrim Experience - which aims to create a more difficult gameplay through AI changes, spawn changes, and overhaul the way the game plays while retaining the regular Skyrim feel - without requiring exploits of any kind.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1269\r\n\r\nI will not be integrating this into PISE, as it goes against what I feel the game should be.  Nevertheless, some people were interested in this, and it was a quick change once I found the variables.\r\n\r\n***FILE LIST***\r\nMain files:\r\nIntense Difficulty 2x.esp -  Twice the difficulty of master.\r\nIntense Difficulty 4x.esp -  Four times the difficulty.\r\nIntense Difficulty 8x.esp -  8 times the difficulty.\r\nIntense Difficulty 16x.esp - 16 times the difficulty (are you crazy?)\r\nIntense Difficulty 32x.esp - 32 times the difficulty (heh, no way.)\r\n\r\n***CHANGELOG***\r\nv1.0 Initial Release",
