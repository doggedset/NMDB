  "descriptionHtml": "This small mod adds five new treasure maps for the player to find and loot. The maps are poorly hand-drawn and unintentionally meant to look like they were hastily scribbled down by someone hiding their treasure in a rush.\r\n\r\nIf you find a treasure map, remember that you need to read it for the loot container to actually spawn. They will not appear in the world otherwise.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve included a seperate file, _clumodSpoilers.txt which contains all the locations of the treasure maps if you\\'re struggling to find them. I would only recommend looking at this if you\\'re only interested in the loot though!\r\n\r\nEach loot container has randomly generated levelled loot in it.\r\n\r\nNew items:\r\nTreasure map XI\r\nTreasure map XII\r\nTreasure map XIII\r\nTreasure map XIV\r\nTreasure map XV\r\n\r\n[youtube]GEnZPXjMLYk[/youtube]\r\n\r\nThis mod does not require any DLC.\r\n\r\nThere are no currently known compatibility issues, if you have any specific concerns please tell me and I will investigate.\r\n\r\nTo install this mod, download the .rar and use the nexus mod manager. Or you can drop the .esp and .bsa files into your Data directory if you don\\'t use the mod manager.\r\n\r\nCreated by mackam08 aka IrksomeBadger.
