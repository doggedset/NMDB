  "summary": "A modders resource for symmetrical Deadric armor and helmet",
  "descriptionHtml": "I like many people dislike asymmetrical armor and after tinkering around in a few 3D modeling programs i was finally able to make the armor symmetrical while keeping the textures intact. I have also done the same thing to the helmet to make it a matching set. The daedric armor glow is a separate thin object and is by default a symmetrical object so i saw no reason to do anything to it or include it. All the original texturing is intact and works with out issue as seen in the images. the objects are exported in .OBJ format for easy importing. I have also included .JPG versions of the helmet diffuse maps and normal maps for easy application. Remember to convert it to the proper .DDS format before attempting to add it to your files. I have set full permissions i only ask that i be credited for making the armor symmetrical and not for the original design. **This is a Modders Resource**\r\n\r\nAnyone who makes this into a proper mod please send me a link :)",
