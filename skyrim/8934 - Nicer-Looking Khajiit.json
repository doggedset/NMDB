  "modName": "Nicer-Looking Khajiit",
  "summary": "Tweaks every Khajiit in the game to look better and not so smashed-faced and chihuahua-eyed.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Every single khajiit in the game has been tweaked by hand to look more like a tiger or bobcat in facial structure and not some wide-eyed Chihuahua monstrosity.  Only Kharjo had his facial hair changed, all other NPC\\'s are intact, just their nose/eyes/face have been changed with in-game sliders and honestly, it makes a world of difference.\r\n\r\nOh, this mod also makes Kharjo and J\\'Zargo Essential, and increases Kharjo\\'s level cap to 75.  Just because.\r\n\r\nScreenshot has the CoverKhajiits mod installed, I highly recommend getting that in addition to this mod.\r\n\r\nAlso available on steam workshop - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=9711",
