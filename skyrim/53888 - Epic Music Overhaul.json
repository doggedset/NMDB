If you read the description, you will very likely save yourself quite a bit of time.\r<br />\r<br />Step 2: Install with or without mod manager.\r<br />\r<br />Step 3: Using the WHAT&#39;S THIS DO?  WHAT&#39;S THAT DO?  sections of the description to guide you, place the music you want to use in the appropriate folders(data/music/EMO/) using the [b]exact[/b] same naming convention the placeholders already found in the folders are using.  All new tracks added in this manner MUST be in xwm format.  TIP: in windows, if you select all the files you want for a certain category, then right click to rename them to the category per the placeholder, it will automatically name all the files the correct way.  then you just need to place them in the appropriate folder.  You can only have 20 tracks per folder, and they must be named in 1, 2, 3, 4... sequential format up to 20, just as the placeholder tracks are(you are supposed to overwrite/delete them).\r<br />\r<br />Step 4: Delete ALL unused placeholder tracks once all of your tracks are in place.  This will prevent long periods of silence in your game.\r<br />\r<br />IF YOU ARE UNINSTALLING\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s all good, you might use the script cleaner to clean out the scripts, but it shouldn&#39;t matter much.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]APOLLO&#39;S OBJECTIVE MOD ASSESSMENT[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Script weight.........................Low\r<br />Installation Difficulty...............Very High\r<br />Modding Skill Level Required......Medium\r<br />Game Difficulty Increase...........N/A\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]TABLE OF CONTENTS[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />I.

The variety of situations will be expanded in future updates, but for now the variety is more than enough to stagger you.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5][color=orange]INTELLIGENT COMBAT MUSIC[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />No, the name of this is not funny, because I couldn&#39;t think of a better way to put it.  Combat music in vanilla is run by a drunk stupid guy inside your computer who is using weights and pulleys to make sound come out of your computer&#39;s sound box.  This guy gets confused easily.  \r<br />\r<br />In Vanilla, combat music starts when an enemy decides that it is in combat with you, and ends either when the hostile dies, or when the game feels like it 10 minutes later.  In EMO, Combat music starts and ends more intelligently.  Combat music will not start until the hostile is in combat with you, AND you are within the user-configurable distance, AND you have line of sight to the hostile.  Until all of those conditions are met, combat music will not start.  Combat music will begin to end as soon as you are out of range of the hostiles, or they no longer know where you are.  The game will wait the length of one update period, and if the conditions are still not met, combat music will end.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]4xgx4k83zzc[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][b][size=5]MCMS EVERYWHERE[/size][/b][/color]\r<br />As a member of the Epic Gameplay Overhaul family, EMO has an MCM which will allow you to tailor your experience by selecting the maximum distance combat music will play, the minimum level an enemy must be to trigger combat music, the update times, or turn off the combat music AI entirely.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]I STILL DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND - WHAT IS THIS AND WHAT DOES IT DO?[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Epic Music Overhaul allows you to personalize your Skyrim experience with new music that you can add in to a wide variety of situations.  It also makes combat music play more intelligently.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]KNOWN ISSUES/INCOMPATIBILITIES[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Please visit [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52487/?]the EGO bug tracker[/url] for a list of all known issues and incompatibilities associated with this mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />&#34;I don&#39;t like your description.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]-EJ6PeVnzCk[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />&#34;How is this different from Personalized Music?&#34;\r<br />First, Personalized Music does not have the intelligent combat system.  That&#39;s kind of a big deal.  Secondly, EMO is far superior to Personalized Music because PM gives you more variety by editing the locations themselves to use playlists that PM selected or created.  This can easily cause compatibility issues with quite a few mods, such as audio overhauls, weather overhauls, and others that might need to use that form.  EMO instead takes the current vanilla systems and adds conditions to new tracks and old tracks to achieve the same effect - which makes EMO compatible with nearly everything except mods which edit existing music tracks or types(and those can usually just have their new music pulled from it and put into the appropriate EMO playlists, and voila&#33; it will all work the same).  This means that EMO is less flexible than PM(which is why you don&#39;t have the Temple specific or College of Winterhold-specific music playlists....in this version), but will run much better and with less issues with other mods, and will allow for much greater variety in music than PM could ever hope to accomplish.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;How is this different from Smarter Combat Music?&#34;\r<br />Smarter Combat Music is a great idea for a mod,so great, in fact, that I decided to do it myself.  The problem with Smarter Combat Music is that it actually turns off normal combat music and manually substitutes its own once conditions are met.  This would be an excellent idea if Bethesda had given us enough tools to succeed in making our own playlists, which they did not.  Because the mod manually adds music, it can definitely cause issues with other music currently playing, and apparently has other bugs associated with it that I&#39;m not well-versed in.  EMO is different because it doesn&#39;t actually turn off combat music, it instead sets up conditions under which combat music can occur, and when combat music is normally called but doesn&#39;t meet the proper conditions, it plays two silent tracks instead, which apparently don&#39;t duck the existing track, effectively making combat music not start until I tell it to, even though it TECHNICALLY has already started.  Essentially, the difference is that I make a less obtrusive edit to the way the game functions - I go with the flow and edit it from there instead of completely removing the existing function and attempting to supplant it with my own - which makes this mod less prone to the issues Smarter Combat Music was facing.  Props of course go out to verteiron for helping me understand the issues he was having so I didn&#39;t go off on a wild goose chase when I first started developing this idea.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;You didn&#39;t fix this part of the music experience which is just AWFUL.  EXPLAIN YOUR OVERSIGHT.&#34;\r<br />Unfortunately, Bethesda(which is my new swear word, by the way) didn&#39;t give us a lot, or really ANY options in the music department.  I can&#39;t even use a script to find out what music type is currently playing.  Furthermore, I can&#39;t even access the code which causes combat music in the first place, or many other types.  PERIOD.  Everything I&#39;m doing here is aworkaround of a workaround, and many fixes for many issues are simply IMPOSSIBLE, because I have no code to use to fix them.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;So what music do you use?&#34;\r<br />Obviously due to the sheer amount of variety it would take me a long time to tell you, seeing as how I have the playlists about 50% filled in my game(that&#39;s a gig of music by the way).  I&#39;m currently in the process of filling out my music into the new categories(I used to use Personalized Music), then I&#39;ll begin typing out my playlist for you, but it&#39;ll take a while.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Why does music end so quickly?  It keeps stopping in the middle of combat&#33;&#34;\r<br />If you find that EMO is removing combat music too often and too quickly, then consider changing the max distance and the update time in the MCM menu.  Longer updates = less reactive system.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Why doesn&#39;t combat music restart once it&#39;s removed?&#34;\r<br />This is a limitation of the engine.  If you leave combat unnaturally(where my script takes you out of combat), then return before the game thinks you&#39;ve left combat, then combat music will not start back up, because the game thinks you&#39;re still in combat and isn&#39;t calling the music anymore.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]WHAT&#39;S THIS DO?  WHAT&#39;S THAT DO?[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Here are what all of the playlist folders do(when/where the music plays)\r<br />\r<br />Combat:\r<br />\r<br />Animal - when the game designates the current combat target as an animal by keyword\r<br />NPC - when the game designates the current combat target as an NPC by keyword\r<br />Undead - when the game designates the current combat target as an Undead by keyword\r<br />Dragon - when the game designates the current combat target as a Dragon by keyword\r<br />Vampire - when the game designates the current combat target as a Vampire by keyword\r<br />Dwemer - when the game designates the current combat target as Dwarven by keyword\r<br />Vampire Lord - when the player is a vampire lord and is in combat\r<br />Werewolf - when the player is a werewolf and is in combat\r<br />Karstaag - Plays during the fight with Karstaag\r<br />Dawnguard Boss - Played when dawnguard boss music should play\r<br />Dragonborn boss - played when dragonborn boss music should play\r<br />Civil War - plays when civil War music is scripted to play(ie. during sieges)\r<br />All - plays in all other situations.  THIS DOES NOT PLAY IF ANY OF THE ABOVE COMBAT MUSIC IS PLAYING.\r<br />\r<br />Castle:\r<br />Imperial Castle - plays in Castle Dour\r<br />Stormcloak Castle - plays in the Palace of the kings\r<br />Other Castle - Plays in All other castles\r<br />Castle Volkihar - Plays in Castle Volkihar\r<br />\r<br />Dungeon:\r<br />\r<br />Apocrypha - plays in Apocrypha\r<br />Falmer Valley - Plays in the Falmer Valley\r<br />Blackreach - plays in Blackreach\r<br />Fort Imperial - (untested) plays in imperial-controlled forts\r<br />Fort Stormcloak - plays in stormcloak-controlled forts\r<br />Dwemer - plays in dwemer ruins\r<br />Cave - plays in &#34;Cave&#34; type dungeons\r<br />Ice - plays in &#34;Ice&#34; type dungeons, Bloodlet Throne is a good example of this.\r<br />Fort - plays in forts not controlled by a civil war faction\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: the above categories are EXCLUSIVE.  For example, if you are fighting an NPC and you have no music in the NPC folder, THEN NO MUSIC WILL PLAY.  If you are in blackreach, but you have no music in the blackreach folder, NO MUSIC WILL PLAY.\r<br />\r<br />Explore\r<br />\r<br />Eclipse - plays during an Eclipse\r<br />Solstheim - plays on Solstheim\r<br />Solstheim Night - plays on Nights in Solstheim\r<br />Forest Fall - plays in all forest fall designated areas(riften area, I believe)\r<br />Forest Pine - plays in all &#34;pine forests&#34; (riverwood area)\r<br />Forest Night - All forests at night\r<br />Mountain Night - Mountains at night\r<br />Mountain - Mountains during the day\r<br />Night - plays in nearly all exterior cells including solstheim at night, this includes towns\r<br />Snow - plays in &#34;Snow&#34; areas\r<br />Snow night - Plays in &#34;snow&#34; areas at night\r<br />Soul Cairn - Plays in the soul Cairn\r<br />Sunrise - plays during the morning hours in most exterior locations\r<br />Sunset - plays during dusk hours in most exterior locations\r<br />Tundra Day - Tundra during the day\r<br />Tundra night - tundra during the night\r<br />\r<br />Miscellaneous:\r<br />\r<br />Level Up - played on level up, or when that music type is called\r<br />Skills Menu - played while accessing the skills menu\r<br />\r<br />Town:\r<br />\r<br />Markarth - plays in Markarth during the day\r<br />Riften - plays in riften during the day\r<br />solitude - plays in solitude during the day\r<br />Whiterun - plays in whiterun during the day\r<br />Windhelm - plays in Windhelm during the day\r<br />Tavern A - I forget which taverns this is - I think it&#39;s the ones in the main towns?  let me get back to you on this.\r<br />Tavern B - See above\r<br />Night - plays in towns at night\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]fCrghE5P2ek[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]REVIEWS[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />No reviews yet.
