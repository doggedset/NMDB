There is no quest associated with this version.\r\n\r\n8/2/12: Added optional version where Zamfir\\'s shop is in Riften.  There is no quest associated with this version\r\n\r\nWHAT THIS MOD DOES:\r\nZamfir’s Mystical Archery Arsenal is a mod that gives you an alternative to using traditional ranged magic, and lets you imbue ranged weapons with magic that rivals that of traditional offensive magical powers.  Zamfir is a venerable sage and warrior from Hammerfell who has had the secrets of mystical archery passed down through his family for generations.  He now runs a shop outside Whiterun where he sells the wonderful and deadly arrows that he creates with his magic.  If you are lucky and willing to venture out on a quest to help Zamfir, then he may just teach you his secrets as well.  Once Zamfir’s knowledge is yours, you will be able to forge his arrows at the smithy, and there will be no stopping you once Zamfir’s arsenal is yours to command (actually Zamfir does not guarantee your survival even with his weapons but there is a 30 day money back guarantee on all his bows).\r\n\r\nEACH ARROW AND QUIVER has a distinct texture based on the glass arrow and quiver.  The texture for each arrow should at least somewhat resemble the effect of the arrow.  For example, an arrow of fire will be orange, red, or yellow, while an arrow of frost will be blue.  \r\n\r\nHOW TO GET ZAMFIR’S WEAPONS\r\nA. QUEST EDITION\r\n1)\tSimply buy them from him.  Zamfir runs a wonderful shop outside Whiterun where he sells his arrows as well as a number of other odds and ends, and many ingredients that go into forging his arrows.  \r\n2)\tForge them yourself.  Zamfir’s knowledge does not come for free.  If you are willing to help him out on a short quest, he may reward you by imparting his knowledge to you, giving you the option of making his arrows at the forge.  If you want the recipes with which to forge his arrows, you will need to get his book.\r\n\r\nB. NON-QUEST EDITION (choose shop location - Whiterun, Riften, or Falkreath)\r\n1) Simply buy them from him\r\nor\r\n2) Buy Zamfir\\'s book from him.  Read the book to see what ingredients you need to forge the arrows.  You must have the book on your person to be able to forge them.  Fortunately, due to the amazing magics imbued within its pages, the book is weightless so it won\\'t affect your inventory.\r\n\r\nZamfir’s weapons come in three general categories.  In general, the more powerful the arrow, the more knowledge in smithing and archery you will require to forge it, and the more expensive it is to buy.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nONLY CHOOSE ONE FILE!  You cannot have multiple Zamfir\\'s shops installed.  Zamfir will not stand for competition!\r\n\r\n*PLEASE use NMM to make it easy on yourself and in case you want to uninstall.  This mod has custom scripts, voices, meshes, textures, and more so uninstalling manually might be a pain in the arse.\r\n\r\n1)\tUse NMM\r\nOr\r\n2)\tManual Install: drop the “data” folder in your Skyrim folder and choose to merge any folders it asks you to.  It will not ask you to overwrite anything in vanilla or other mods you may have installed.  \r\n\r\n*NOTE that in testing, sometimes right after installing the mod, Zamfir fails to give you the opportunity to do the quest when you first meet him.  I have no idea yet why this is, but if it happens to you, simply save your game, quit Skyrim, restart Skyrim, load your saved game, and voila! Problem solved (don’t know why this works but it does).\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION:\r\n        1) Use NMM\r\n              Or \r\n       2) delete what you installed out of the /data folder in the following folders:\r\n\tMESHES/weapons/zamfir\r\n\tMESHES/magic\r\n\tTEXTURES/weapons/zamfir (just delete the whole “zamfir” folder\r\n\tTEXTURES/effects/gradients\r\n\tSCRIPTS and SCRIPTS/source\r\n\tSOUND/voice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIER ONE: \r\nMinimum Smithing Skill Level of 20\r\nMinimum Archery Skill Level of 30\r\nMust have completed Zamfir’s Quest to learn his secrets\r\n\r\nTIER TWO:\r\nMinimum Smithing Skill Level of 30 \r\nMinimum Archery Skill Level of 40\r\nMust have completed Zamfir’s Quest to learn his secrets\r\n\r\nTIER THREE:\r\nMust have the “Arcane Blacksmith” perk\r\nMinimum Archery Skill Level of 50\r\nMust have completed Zamfir’s Quest to learn his secrets\r\n\r\n\r\nTIER ONE ARROWS\r\nREQUIREMENTS: \r\n* Smithing 20 \r\n* Marksman 30\r\n* Must have completed Zamfir’s Quest\r\n\r\nArrow of Fear (Has a chance to cause your enemy to flee)\r\nArrow of Chaos (Frenzy – has a chance to cause your enemy to attack any other NPC)\r\nArrow of Headknock (Has a chance to inflict great force and knock and enemy off their feet)\r\nArrow of Illumination (When it strikes an enemy, the enemy will remain illuminated for a period of time)\r\nArrow of Magicka Damage (Causes regular and magical damage to your enemy)\r\nArrow of Reanimation (Has a chance to reanimate the dead npc it hits to fight for you)\r\nArrow of Revelation (Very slow-moving light to reveal surroundings)\r\nArrow of the Serpent (Poisonous Arrow)\r\nArrow of Undead Turning (Has a chance to turn undead)\r\n\r\n\r\nTIER TWO ARROWS\r\nREQUIREMENTS: \r\n*Smithing 30\r\n*Marksman 40\r\n*Must have completed Zamfir’s Quest\r\n\r\nFirebolt (Launches a deadly firebolt that will explode on contact and light your enemy on fire)\r\nFrost Arrow (Launches a deadly frost projectile that will inflict frost damage on your enemy)\r\nLightning Arrow (Launches a deadly lightning bolt; can be drawn and fired with lightning speed)\r\nArrow of Paralysis (has a chance to paralyze your enemy)\r\nArrow of Soul Trap (casts soul trap on body it hits, and if within a certain time, when the npc dies their soul will fill your soul gem provided you are close enough in proximity)\r\n\r\nTIER THREE ARROWS\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\r\n*Arcane Smithing Perk\r\n*Marksman 50\r\n*Must have completed Zamfir’s Quest\r\n\r\nFire Rune Arrow (Sets a fire rune where it lands and explodes for tremendous damage when triggered)\r\nFrost Rune Arrow(Sets a frost rune where it lands and explodes for tremendous damage when triggered)\r\nLightning Rune Arrow (Sets a lightning rune where it lands and explodes for tremendous damage when triggered)\r\nArrow of Wildfire (Oil Fire Bomb – will spread flammable oil over area where it lands to inflict terrible burn damage on your enemy)\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nThe Nexus Community and Staff\r\nBethesda\r\nPhotoshop\r\nNiftools team for Nifskope\r\nCreation Kit\r\nBellyache for much, much help with everything, playtesting, feedback, images, main banner",
