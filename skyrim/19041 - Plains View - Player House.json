  "modName": "Plains View - Player House",
  "summary": "A fairly large, comfy home located outside Whiterun",
  "descriptionHtml": "Version History:\r\nv1.2 - Removed the amulets from the Enchanting/Alchemy loft. One of the was advancing a quest.  Replaced them with vanilla amulets so you can enchant them.\r\nv1.1 - Added a bunch of statics to the interior and exterior to make the home more homey.  Changed the interior lighting to make it a little brighter.  I didn\\'t mess with any of the containers so any stuff you have stored should be safe.\r\nv1.0 - Original version\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at a house mod.  \r\nThere are a lot of great player house mods, and I\\'ve used several of them, so I created Plains View to try to give back to the modding community.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve always liked the Jarl\\'s Longhouses so I overhauled the White Hall from Dawnstar to be used as a player house.\r\n\r\nThere isn\\'t any quest attached - all you have to do is walk in and use it.  It\\'s got a map marker and can be fast travelled to.\r\n\r\nPlains View is located just outside Whiterun and features:\r\n- all crafting workstations - including a smelter (outside) and cooking area - with a nearby chest next to each - the enchanting and alchemy tables have a satchel for soul gems and ingredients and the blacksmith anvil has a satchel attached to the wall (may be easy to miss) for gems and jewelry\r\n- 4 mannequins\r\n- 3 display cases and weapons racks\r\n- 4 weapons plaques\r\n- an dining area\r\n- master bedroom\r\n- follower bedroom\r\n- a small reading area\r\n- a sitting room so you can enterain your guests after dinner\r\n\r\nAll the containers are set to not respawn so they should be safe.  The renamed containers are duplicates of the PlayerHouseChest and TreasAlchemySatchelRare so you shouldn\\'t have any problems with the items I\\'ve preloaded showing up in the vanilla game containers.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 adds:\r\n- a lot of statics to make the home more homey both inside and outside.\r\nInterior:\r\n- a throne area on the first floor to meet with your guests and discuss the current and past Skyrim issues\r\n- Display busts for Dragon Priest masks\r\n- A lot of wall coverings and rugs\r\n- A table and wall shelves on the enchanting/alchemy loft with some loose potions and soul gems\r\nExterior:\r\n- A pavilion where you can sit and enjoy a picnic or just watch the world go by\r\n- A livestock pen with a few cows, goats and chickens\r\n- A wood chopping area\r\n- A well\r\n- Banners of some of your worst friends or best enemies hanging on the walls\r\n- A dragon skull mounted above the door\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n- For some reason followers won\\'t exit out the door - they enter just fine.  They spawn somewhere down the road but catch back up in seconds\r\n- It\\'s a little foggy inside.  I applied the FarmLightingTemplate to the cell and even though I unticked all the interior effects it\\'s still there.  It\\'s not bad though.  If anyone knows how to get rid of it let me know.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve placed the house exterior away from any Civil War markers and spawn points, but I haven\\'t done any of the Civil war quests so there might be an issue there, but I doubt it.\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\nAny mod that places anything in the same area outside Whiterun.\r\n\r\nInstall/Uninstall:\r\nDownload using the Download with Manager button and activate it in the NMM \r\nor\r\nManually download the .esp file, place it in the ...\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data directory and activate the mod in the Skyrim launcher.\r\nUninstall - delete the .esp from the Data directory.\r\n\r\nAny feedback is welcome.",
