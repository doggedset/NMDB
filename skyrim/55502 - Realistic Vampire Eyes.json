  "summary": "As the title states this is a vampire eye texture that I made, which should hopefully be semi-realistic.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[heading]Description[/heading]\r<br />  After many months of browsing Nexus and numerous other sites I decided that all the vampire eye textures were too bright and cartoonish, or I just didn&#39;t like them. So I thought I&#39;d try to make a texture more to my liking, that would fit into Skyrim. The eyes are for all races except from Khajiit and Argonians, so please keep that in mind. My skills are limited so I used the icy blue eyes as a base, increased the resolution, and tweaked most of it.(Credit to Bethesda&#33;)  So this is the result, I hope you like it&#33;\r<br />[heading]Installation[/heading]\r<br />  It&#39;s very easy to install, just make sure that eyevampire_01 and eyevampire_02 are in Data/Textures/Actors/Character/Eyes. Simple as that&#33; There should be no problems or conflicts as this is just a texture, unless you already have something that alters vampire eyes.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Change Log[/heading]\r<br />A glowing version of the eyes is now available.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]The mods used in the screenshots are:[/heading]\r<br />\r<br />DYNAVISION Dynamic Depth of Field\r<br />Grass on Steroids\r<br />Darker Caves, Dungeons, Ruins, Towers, Nights\r<br />XCE-Xenius Character Enhancement\r<br />Final Younger Characters\r<br />Vanilla Hair Variety Plus\r<br />Black Mage Armor\r<br />Snow White Vampires",
