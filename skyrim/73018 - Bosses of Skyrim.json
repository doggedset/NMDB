  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]Bosses of Skyrim[/u]\r<br />[/b]\r<br />As I have played Skyrim throughout the years, I have always felt like a god. By this, I mean that every AI to challenge me in the game doesn&#39;t exactly feel like an intimidating type. Yes, you do get the OP boss at the end of every dungeon and get that one very difficult dragon every now and then but that boss feel doesn&#39;t really kick in for me within Skyrim. As a huge fan of RPG games I feel that bosses weren&#39;t exactly a big thing in Skyrim, I never got that feel of saving up my potions and spending every ounce of gold in preparation to fight them... \r<br />\r<br />So with this mod, I have changed that. I have made bosses based on the sets of armor in the game. For example, the Daedric warrior, the Dragon warrior etc. They are all located in certain locations throughout Skyrim, in dungeons, caverns etc. But to keep the feel of not knowing what is coming when you delve into a certain dangerous location, I will not give away the locations of these bosses. ",
