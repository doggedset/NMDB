  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]With the release of Twins of Meridia I now consider this mod Obsolete, Twins has the same improvments as this one.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />**PestiX also has a mod done in German http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19334  His mod was out before mine, so take alook at it first the only difference between ours is, the enchantment being unlimited or not**\n<br />\n<br />Uploading this per a request from a friend,and also for others who like the sword but maybe not the hassle of carrying a bunch of soul stones with you,or the lack luster performance at high levels,esspecially on master difficulty.\n<br />\n<br />And if your like me, who likes to use just one sword for your entire \"career\"  that looks cool,this might be for you to.\n<br />\n<br />Mainly this mod does just a few simple things, nothing fancy really.\n<br />\n<br />1: Increases Dawnbreakers damage to Daedric Sword level (it IS a Daedric articfact after all)\n<br />\n<br />2: Lets you improve it at the grinding stone fully (To Legendary quality),It will still take the Arcane Blacksmith perk as it is enchanted.\n<br />\n<br />3: Removes the Enchantment's \"cost\" basically so it will never need to be recharged.\n<br />\n<br />Installation: Just unzip it and add it to your Data folder like any other mod (manual download only)\n<br />\n<br />Recommended Mods: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2518  I personally like this one for dawnbreaker the runes add flavor to it",
