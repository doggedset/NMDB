  "descriptionHtml": "Made a quick mod for my own personal use but figured I might as well post it for anyone who wants to use it.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n  Adds in blacksmith crafting tables and smelters for city blacksmiths who were for some reason missing them in the first place.  I found it frustrating when I went to the local blacksmith to forge a new sword only to find that I would have to fast travel back and forth just to find a smelter to melt down all of the ores i collected from my adventures, then make my way back only to find that the blacksmith didn\\'t even have a grindstone to sharpen it!\r\n  Well fret no more, as I made sure to put at least one smelter in all cities and in any towns that had a blacksmith (Riverwoood apparently is the only town that has an incomplete blacksmith).\r\n\r\nChanges Made:\r\nRiften \t        - Smelter\r\nSkyforge      \t- Smelter, Workbench, Tanning Rack\r\nDawnstar\t\t- Workbench, Grindstone\r\nSolitude\t\t- Smelter\r\nFalkreath\t\t- Smelter\r\nRiverwood\t\t- Smelter\r\n\r\nBugs/Incompatabilities:\r\nNo bugs that I\\'m aware of yet\r\nDetailed Cities by Dex, there will be duplicate crafting tables (smelter, etc) for the Skyforge and Riverwood.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
