  "descriptionHtml": "Hello everyone. This mod is something I did just to shake the rust off. I am happy to see that the Creation Kit hasn\\'t really changed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions on what you might like to see added just let me know and I might add them.\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism is always welcome but please, keep it civil.\r\n\r\n-Description-\r\nThis is a modification of Breezehome in Whiterun that I did for myself. Like I stated above, this mod is just a warm-up but I may change a few things around in the future.\r\n\r\n-Features-\r\nAdded a safe to the Bedroom Upgrade. (A small present is inside the safe)\r\nAdded a few extras to the Kitchen Upgrade.\r\nChanged a few containers to non-respawn. (they were marked as respawnable in the Creation Kit).\r\n\r\n-Versions-\r\n1.0 - Initial Release\r\n\r\n-Credits-\r\nBethesda for making another great game.\r\nThe Nexus Team for giving us a place to upload our mods.",
