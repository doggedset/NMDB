  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Times New Roman][color=#1e84cc][b]Hi everyone of the Nexus&#33;[/b]  [b]Simdrew1993 here&#33; [/b]Today I present to you Princess Zelda she is the Princess of the sacred land known as Hyrule from [/color][color=#93c47d]The legend of Zelda series[/color][color=#1e84cc]. She possess&#39;s the Triforce of Wisdom granted by the 3 mystical Goddesses, Din, Nayru and Farore. This package includes 3 versions of Zelda. [/color][i][b][color=#f1c232]Twilight Princess Version [/color][color=#7f6000]Brunnete[/color][/b][/i][color=#1e84cc], [/color][b][i][color=#8e7cc3]Classic [/color][color=#ffe599]Blonde[/color][/i][/b][color=#1e84cc], and [/color][color=#a61c00][b][i]Dark Mistress Zelda[/i][/b][/color][color=#1e84cc] for if you want to play Zelda in an evil style. All can be downloaded for Racemenu and ECE both whichever is your preference. I may adjust the presets later on if I ever find it all needs more tweaking. I originally created her for ECE then later ported her over to Racemenu as well. With ECE&#39;s last update many of my ECE-CME Preset slots have been having problems where it loads the wrong hair for some reason may have something to do with the latest updates who knows. It only started doing that recently but lately it&#39;s been working find again. If you have any problems please let me know in the comments section.[/color][color=#93c47d] [b][center]\r<br />[size=3]Please endorse her if you like my work&#33; Plus comments are welcome. You are free to take videos and screenshots also and share em&#33; I&#39;d love to see them&#33;\r<br />[/size][/center][/b][/color][size=3][color=#1e84cc] [/color][color=#ff0000]Enjoy&#33; [/color][color=#f1c232]^_^\r<br />[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][size=4]NOTE:[/size][color=#3d85c6][size=3] There are no required mods besides ECE or Racemenu whichever you use, those mods are just my recommended mods for her look...you can read my credits listing for more details on how I made her and which mods to use. [/size][/color][/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#bf9000][size=5][b][i]Follower of Link, Zelda and Ganondorf hopefully coming soon sometime this year TBA, no promises yet it&#39;s only planned. Link ECE preset page will also be updated, and final version will be added along with an ECE version and a blonde version for those with preferences. [/i][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Face was constructed in Enhanced Character Edit as a CME Preset then saved, I modeled her face off of her Zelda Twilight Princess appearance worked extremely hard on sculpting it, she is in slot 4, 12, 13, then I exported her face for Racemenu, unfortunately in Racemenu I was unable to get her tints completely the same as ECE took me long enough though to get them pretty close, since Racemenu uses a completely different tinting system it&#39;s hard to replicate 100%, although she still looks great. Probably one of my best creations by far&#33;[/size]\r<br />[img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/Beautiful%20Princess%20of%20Hyrule_zps4ggloui6.jpg[/img]\r<br />[size=3][img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/enb%202014_12_17%2019_42_31_48_zpsgrzpgr5j.png[/img][/size]\r<br />[/font][img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/TroubledPrincess_zpswnvedvbf.jpg[/img][font=Times New Roman][size=3][img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/SideView_zps98vel0e2.jpg[/img][/size]\r<br />[size=3][img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/PrincessofHyrule_zpsun3q7gm8.jpg[/img][/size]\r<br />[size=3][img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/BeautifulDayatOasis_zpssjorru4f.jpg[/img][/size]\r<br />[size=3][img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/Zelda%20of%20Hyrule_zpseyscojwr.jpg[/img]\r<br />[img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/PrincessZeldaSkyrim_zpsevq8mk2k.jpg[/img][/size]\r<br />[size=3][img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/ClassicVersion_zpsfmxun3ny.jpg[/img][/size]\r<br />[size=3][img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/enb%202014_12_17%2022_36_07_74_zpsom3amkwe.jpg[/img][/size]\r<br />[color=#f1c232][img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/enb%202017_02_23%2007_21_39_60_zpsnaxpxeut.jpg[/img]\r<br />My story for Zelda is short but simple....[/color]\r<br />[color=#f1c232]Princess Zelda was with Link when a wave of dark energy swooped her away pulling her into a dark vortex, a portal which led to Skyrim. Ganondorf was trying to summon her with his magic in his efforts to capture her once again after he was resurrected by a drop of the hero&#39;s blood, let&#39;s just say that all went wrong, now Zelda finds herself in the country of Skyrim unsure of how to get back to Hyrule she must face many new challenges. Whether Skyrim is Hyrule in a future, or Hyrule is somewhere else....who knows.[/color]\r<br />[color=#f1c232]As Zelda ventures through Skyrim she seeks to do good deeds, help those people and show the power of the Hylian Royal Army by her grace and divine will. She wanted to make Skyrim a better place, she was angry at the Empire for what they did to her for the near execution. Although she would forgive, Zelda doesn&#39;t like to do battles much although she has had training. She uses the Hylian Royal Sword or her magic. Princess Zelda usually has an escort of at least 4 guards or more in my playthrough, in order to stay protected from dangers of Skyrim. Zelda see&#39;s that Skyrim is a land filled with corruption, it is filled with chaos, civil wars, dragons, it is a land that needs purified of it&#39;s evil. It deserves Zelda&#39;s leadership to return to it&#39;s roots. [/color]\r<br />[color=#f1c232]Best Roleplay for being Zelda, would be that your usually good. But she also can become a Ninja such as Sheik to hide herself, or take on some other identity to protect herself from being found out by Ganondorf...No doubt he may also be in Skyrim searching for her or conquering Hyrule who knows.... [/color]\r<br />[color=#f1c232]She would dislike the dark brotherhood and thieves guild as they stand against Justice. [/color][size=3]on the other hand Dark Zelda would love them&#33;[/size]\r<br />[size=3][img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/enb%202015_07_16%2014_25_10_23_zps7we1rz9z.jpg[/img][/size]\r<br />[color=#cc4125][size=3]Dark Zelda&#39;s Story: Dark Zelda was on the hunt to find new territories for Ganondorf once he returned in preparation for another attack on Hyrule in the near future until she stumbled across Skyrim and its borders although it&#39;s unknown how she got there she is incredibly dangerous and will do whatever she deems necessary to rule the lands.  Playing as Dark Zelda in her playthrough would be about making all the wrong choices same for Ganondorf, Dark Link and any other bad guy. As her, your goals would be to turn Skyrim into a wasteland. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Dark Zelda&#39;s Attire Recolor of Overmind5000&#39;s clothes coming soon&#33; Overmind5000&#39;s Tiara as well just haven&#39;t got pictures of the finished product yet. \r<br />[/size][/b][/color][img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Online/Princess%20Zelda%20Skyrim%20-%20Simdrew1993/ScreenShot44_zpssqpr28yw.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][color=#9900ff]You can download JKalenads version of her Royal Sword from Relics of Hyrule here:  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40615/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40615/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Or You can download Zelda&#39;s Royal Sword here in this Zelda megapack by diegoforfun:[/color][/i][/b][/font]  [url=https://www.sendspace.com/file/7r2br2]https://www.sendspace.com/file/7r2br2\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/url]For Zelda&#39;s clothes I included a couple batch (bat) files for the Jarls clothes, primarily I have her wear Toryggs clothes for brunette they look nice, or Jarl clothes for , and for Dark Zelda she has her own I made from the original clothes.
