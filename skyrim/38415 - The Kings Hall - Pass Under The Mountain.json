For those that have downloaded it and wish to continue playing, the overhauled mod will be available on this site and on the Steam Workshop. I will be removing this mod in due course.\r\n\r\nThe definitive version is names \\'Morsel - The Cursed Halls\\' and will be available on here and Steam Workshop.\r\n\r\nApologies to everyone and thanks for supporting me. I felt this was the right thing to do incase the changes messed peoples games up. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\nLionbush ",
