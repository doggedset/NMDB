  "descriptionHtml": "This is a Mod of mine that has been on the Steam workshop for quite some time so I decided perhaps I should Upload it here on the Nexus and here it is...\r<br />\r<br />Scions of the Night&#33;&#33; Tired of hearing a weak mortal claim to be superior, when in truth they are nothing to you but food? Do you view the Thalmor as Inferior? perhaps you have a taste for Elven Blood? Maybe you think the thalmor need to learn how low on the food chain they actually are? if so then this mod is for you, This mod replaces the cattle inside castle Volkihar with new Thalmor cattle for your vampire clan to feed off of.Â \r<br />\r<br />If you really must know, I got the idea to make this mod because I was using my Vampire Lord, one day and this here Thalmor agent claimed that &#34;I was a dog and he was the master&#34; (And he said that to an Immortal undead being who devours dragons for a living) and I quote......\r<br />\r<br />if this Vampire Lord who just happens to be the Mythical Dragonborn of legend is a dog then this Thalmor agent must be dog food.",
