  "descriptionHtml": "The aim of this mod is to make the Disintegration Perk more realistic and more enjoyable.\r\nSince I play as a Mage, it was very annoying for me to disintegrate all what was in my way even with Sparks...\r\nWell, not anymore!\r\n\r\nThis mod removes the disintegrate Perk from low level shock spells (sparks and lightning bolt) and cloak. High level spells weren\\'t changed, so if you want to disintegrate an annoying troll, just use chain lightning or thunderbolt! \r\n\r\nThe effect was also removed from dragons, dwarven automatons, dragon priests (since they disintegrate on their own) and mammoths (because I don\\'t know how to add huge ash piles).\r\n\r\nHave fun! If you have any suggestion leave it in the comment section below\r\n\r\nThis shouldn\\'t conflict with any other mod. I just edited the perk for those particular spells",
