  "modName": "Aduri Sarethi as a Follower",
  "summary": "I always felt bad for Aduri Sarethi when I went to Sarethi Farm and she said how she wants to get out more, so now you can take her out on adventures with you&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "When you collect Crimson Nirnroot and bring it to Avrusa Sarethi (or perhaps you just stumbled upon Sarethi Farm) you&#39;ll notice a younger Dunmer with nothing to say other than a few repeating sentences. She and Avrusa say how she&#39;s a free spirit and wants to get out. I really wanted to recruit her as a follower and hoped there was a mission to do so, but, nothing. \r<br />So, I made my own mod for it. \r<br />You dont really have to do anything to get her to like you, I dont even think you have to do the Crimson Nirnroot quest, as far as I know you just walk up to her, and can recruit her. You can also marry her. I haven&#39;t set any weapons or clothes on her, but I did set her to &#34;essential&#34; so you dont have to worry about her dying or anything. If you have any ideas as to how I could make the mod better, just let me know&#33; Im always open to improving my mods. cx",
