  "descriptionHtml": "=========================\r<br />Better Fitting Steel Helms\r<br />=========================\r<br />\r<br />By Kraeten\r<br />\r<br />=========================\r<br />Description\r<br />=========================\r<br />\r<br />Like many of you I&#39;m sure, I found the steel helms to be extremely poor dimension wise for male humans and elves. The helmets appeared almost twice the size they should be. In an effort to fix this problem and make the helmets look as attractive as the rest of the steel armor I replaced the male helmet with the female equivalent. The end result is a helmet that looks much more like the original concept art, and not the bloated mess that appeared in the vanilla game. Due to the largeness of Argonians, Khajiits and Orc male heads, this mod doesn&#39;t affect their steel helmet meshes. \r<br />\r<br />(((A note to elven characters, you may need to adjust the length of your character&#39;s nose if it&#39;s sticking out pretty far as this helmet may clip a little otherwise. )))\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Installation Instructions:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />To install this plug-in unzip the downloaded file and extract the data folder within. Drop data folder into main skyrim installation directory. To uninstall, simply delete BetterFittingSteelHelms.esp and BetterFittingSteelHelms.bsa.\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />This is a Nexus exclusive, please don&#39;t upload this mod elsewhere.\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Credits:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;d like to thank ttl269 of the NifTools Forum for indirectly assisting me when he discussed helmet meshes.
