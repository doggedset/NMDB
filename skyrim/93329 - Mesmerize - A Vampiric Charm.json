You will need Dawnguard for this mod, because I accidentally used it in the making. It is compatible with \"Sacrosanct\" but doesn't need it, I don't know about other vampire overhauls.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a spell tome called \"Mesmerize\" which can be bought (or pickpocketed) from Sybille Stentor in solitude. You will need Dawnguard for this mod, because I accidentally used it in the making. It is compatible with \"Sacrosanct\" but doesn't need it, I don't know about other vampire overhauls. \"Mesmerize\" is basically \"Vampire's Seduction\" in spell form, and can be cast as much as you want. It is affected by Illusion's \"Dual Cast\" perk. I recommend [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80159]Sacrosanct[/url] with this mod.\n<br />I tried to make so you had to be a vampire in order to buy the tome from Sybille Stentor, but I didn't succeed. The spell only hits one target, and in some cases with Sacrosanct you need to activate the target quickly if you wish to drain, if the option to drain doesn't pop up, cast the spell again and activate the target very soon afterwards.\n<br />This is my very first mod, I hope you like it, and please enjoy.",
