But do you dare challenge him and his minions?\r\n\r\nRich loot awaits if you can tumble through the chambers so maybe it is worth the risk.\r\n\r\nA small place to discover for those with an adventurer kind of spirit.\r\nLevel 30-40 and up is recommended. :O)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling:\r\n\r\nJust drop the file into your data folder or rely upon ModManager (NMM).\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibilities:\r\n\r\nThe mod slightly modifies the landscape near one of the shrines on the road to High Hrothgar\r\nbut it does not spoil anything else. Hopefully. If it does, please report me (it shouldn\\'t anyhow)\r\n\r\nDawnguard DLC is required.\r\n\r\nConstructive comments and bug reports are always welcome! :O)",
