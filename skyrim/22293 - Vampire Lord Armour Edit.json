  "descriptionHtml": "This is a really small texture edit of the vampire lord armour, which I made out of personal preference. I feel the metal pendulum should look independent of the cloth (leather?) behind it, so I did that. Then, it seemed natural to even up the back to match. That&#39;s all.\r<br />\r<br />Just in case it bothers some people, the screenshot makes the back look almost revealing. I never looked at it from that angle before, but I checked and nothing is revealed, Bethesda kindly shrouded that part of the texture in darkness, and unless you make impossible angles with the camera you won&#39;t be able to see up there, not that there is anything revealing or &#34;naughty&#34; to be seen.\r<br />\r<br />I may make a slightly different version with the extra ornamental back piece, if there is a request for it.",
