  "summary": "Simple facelift and name change for Jenassa.  Based off an old D&D Frost Mage character.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve always liked Jenassa, but never really cared for her looks.  Most of the replacers I&#39;ve found for her didn&#39;t appeal to me, so I set out to make my own.  As I was going over some ideas in my head, my wife showed me a box of all our roleplaying stuff that had been back of the closet for over a decade.  As I looked at the old and forgotten characters, it hit me:  I&#39;ll recreate my wife&#39;s drow frost mage.\r<br />\r<br />In addition to giving Jenassa a facelift, I changed her name to that of my wife&#39;s original character.  She&#39;s still stealthy and shouldn&#39;t trigger pressure plate traps, but her entire combat has been reworked to make her more of caster than a melee/archer.  She comes with a multitude of ice spells, made essential, and scales with the player&#39;s level.  I had a lot of fun using her, even if I took a few accidental ice spikes in the rear end.  If you like it, please endorse.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />ApachiiSkyHair - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?\r<br />The Eyes of Beauty - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722\r<br />\r<br />Recommended: (to look like the screenshots)\r<br />CBBE female body replacer - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666\r<br />Better females by Bella - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2812 (no makeup version)\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Use NMM or simply drop the .esp and the .bsa files into the Data folder. It&#39;s that simple.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />Use NMM or simply delete the .esp and the .bsa files from the Data folder. It&#39;s that simple.\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts:\r<br />If you&#39;re using UFO (Ultimate Follower Overhaul - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14037), make sure this mod is loaded AFTER UFO, or you&#39;ll get the discolored vanilla head bug. It may just be doing this on my machine, but I don&#39;t have the slightest idea why it happens.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to the Nexus modding community, you guys make it possible to enjoy playing the same games over and over and over...\r<br />\r<br />Special Thanks to FalmerBane.  After using many of his beautifully done replacers, it inspired me to make some of my own.",
