  "descriptionHtml": "When I found Reachwind Eyrie, I instantly wanted to make it my home, and was disappointed when I found I couldn\\'t, properly, with all my crap that I\\'d collected. So quite simple, I modded it to have what I wanted.\r\n\r\n[size=+1]Information[/size]\r\nReachwind Eyrie is a dwemer tower located in the south-west of Skyrim: southeast of Markarth and north of Dushnikh Yal. This mod turns it into a fairly basic player home, with new storage containers, decoration, etc. There are no major changes to the game, i.e. no sprawling underground areas etc, as I wanted it to be world friendly.\r\n\r\n[size=+1]Features:[/size]\r\nTower exterior: \r\n- Lavender, thistle, dragonstongue, gourds and deathbell plants have been added\r\n- grindstone and tanning rack under tree\r\n- general detail added\r\n\r\nMain tower:\r\n- 4 new non-respawning containers\r\n- 2 weapon plaques\r\n- 4 weapon racks\r\n- a player-owned bedroll for sleeping\r\n- a Shrine to Kynareth on the balcony\r\n- cooking pot\r\n- new shelves, banners and other detail\r\n\r\nVault:\r\n- 7 non respawning chests\r\n- three weapon plaques\r\n- three weapon racks\r\n- 2 mannequins\r\n\r\nThe vault is locked at first, the key is on the balcony.\r\n\r\n[size=+1]Credits:[/size]\r\n - me (Ben Talbot) /ai74 / Lyrian\r\n - I\\'ve just noticed another mod that does the same thing, albeit it better and on a larger scale, which uses a lot of the same models etc - I had no idea it existed and copied nothing intentionally.",
