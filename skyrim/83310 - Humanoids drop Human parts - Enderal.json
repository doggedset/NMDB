  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]Did you ever wonder why human flesh and hearts are so hard to obtain? Well, wonder no more&#33; This mod allows you to loot human flesh, human heart and bone meal from dead bandits, brigands, highwayman, enemy soldiers, wild mages... Human flesh and human hearth are good ingredients for characters built around alchemy. \r<br />I didn&#39;t add this feature to any NPC who is essential, or has anything to do with Enderal main quest, and to peaceful NPCs such as workers, miners and blacksmiths. Also, i added this to Half-Aeterna, because I think that they and humans should have same &#34;entrails&#34;.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]INSTALLATION\r<br />[/b]Just drag and drop &#34;Data&#34; folder from archive in your Skyrim directory, or install archive with your favorite mod manager. To uninstall, just delete &#34;Human parts.esp&#34; from  your &#34;Data&#34; directory. For using Enderal together with Mod Organizer, see this [/size][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C74LjT96pr0][size=3][b]TUTORIAL. \r<br />[/b][/size][/url]\r<br />[size=3]CREDITS[/size]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=3]To Bethesda, ofc.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]SureAI for masterpiece called &#34;Enderal&#34;\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]To mod author Rokenian. Why? I opened his mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11617/?]&#34;Humans Drop Human Parts&#34;[/url] in TES5Edit to figure out how to make this one (but I didn&#39;t modify any of his work).[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[size=3][size=3][b][color=#ffffff][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80795/?]I recommend mod &#34;Enderal - Alchemy made useful&#34; by Alex Ducey.[/url][/color][/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b]PERMISSIONS\r<br />[/b]Well, I doubt anyone would want to change this (this is very small and simple mod), but if someone want to modify it, just send message to me and do what you want. And keep it on Nexus, for sake of convenience.\r<br />[/size]",
