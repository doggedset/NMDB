  "descriptionHtml": "Two Handed Animations redone\r\n\r\n\\\"Although large, measuring 60-70 in/150-175 cm overall, it was not as hefty as it looked, weighing something of the order of 5-8 lbs/2.3-3.6 kg.\\\"\r\n\r\nsource: http://thearma.org/essays/2HGS.html\r\n\r\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIm curretnly completely reviewing this mod - meaning from the scratch (Im also planning on expanding to all melee weapon types)\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some RL issues have arisen and I have to take care of them so my work on this, and all other projects is alot slower than I hoped for in the first place... I`m sorry for the delay :) Once Ill get my s**t together, ill return in full force, tho I cant promise when It`ll be ready for release - assuming by the time noone else did animation mod of  (imo) similar or higher quality.\r\n\r\nKeep the ideas flowing :) I got lots of inspiration (and will) from you guys ... and ... Thank you for you patience ;)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- This is really basic mod that changes some animations for Two-Handed GREATSWORDS\r\n  to animations from their one-handed counterparts... Combat now IMHO seems somewhat more\r\n  fluid and less like drunken apes fighting with sticks\r\n\r\n- This is not a final version... some animations are a littlebit off (bwd power attack, power atack right), however   I still thought that they looked alot better then original ones\r\n\r\n- THIS MOD ONLY WORKS FOR TWO-HANDED SWORDS\r\n\r\n- I originally created this for my personal use, however it seemed solid enough so I shared it with you ;)\r\n\r\nYou can find video at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiekyNpONss\r\n\r\n!!Simply extract to your /data folder!!\r\n\r\nCredits: Bethesda for creating animations\r\n\t Me (Plzaxbb) for fiddling with it\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso - if you dislike sprinting animation, you can easily remove it by deleting the following file:\r\n\r\nSkyrim/Data/Meshes/actors/character/animations/2hm_sprintforwardsword.hkx\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy ;)",
