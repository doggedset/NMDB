  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Tahoma][color=#fce5cd][color=#ffff00][b][size=6]More NPC Pocket Money[/size][/b][/color]\r<br />[i]by Ouka[/i][/color][/font][/center][font=Tahoma][color=#fce5cd]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Courier New][color=#cfe2f3][size=5][b]Description:[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />Very simple mod that adds a little bit of pocket money to NPCs. This is in addition to any pocket money they already have in the vanilla game.\r<br />\r<br />It comes in three flavors:\r<br />[color=#ff7700][b]Standard[/b][/color] is how much money I feel the various NPCs might have if they&#39;re in a shopping or tavern-hopping mood based on the value of gold in the game. Expected ranges of money involve a few hundred gold for middle-class folk, and up to the low thousands for rich people.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][b]More Money[/b][/color] is roughly double that much (high hundreds for middle-class, several thousand for rich folk).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][b]Less Money[/b][/color] is about half of Standard, ranging from just a little bit more than vanilla up to the low hundreds for middle class and high hundreds for rich people. This is the version I recommend if you aren&#39;t using mods like [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35305]Your Market Stall[/url] or you just want NPCs to have a bit more money in general.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Tahoma]I actually really made this mod for the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35305]Your Market Stall[/url] mod, but this is stand alone and doesn&#39;t require that. The problem was there wasn&#39;t a lot of people buying any of the more expensive items (like rare armors and gems) because they didn&#39;t have enough money, making it sorta meaningless to even display those items in your store.\r<br />\r<br />This is also ideal for thief-type characters, if you like pickpocketing NPCs in towns for example.[/font]\r<br />\r<br />The amounts added are pretty random despite the expected ranges I said up there. For example, you might see among middle-class people that one person has 45 gold and the other has 216. A rich person might have 471 gold and another might have 1203. I don&#39;t like extremely predictable values so I tried to keep everything fairly random. Mathematically it&#39;s possible for them to spawn with 0 additional gold, though highly unlikely.\r<br />\r<br />This might affect some merchant gold. Maybe. It depends on if they use the pocket money leveled list too. It might also affect certain containers that use the same pocket money leveled lists that NPCs use.\r<br />\r<br />This should not affect dungeon chests, bandits, etc., so you won&#39;t be getting rich off of a dungeon run without selling your loot off to NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Courier New][color=#c9daf8][size=5][b]Installation:[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />Pick one of the flavors you like.\r<br />[/color][/font][color=#fce5cd]\r<br />NMM should be able to install it easily.\r<br />\r<br />Manual installation involves simply unzipping the file (use [url=www.[b]7[/b]-[b]zip[/b].org/]7-zip[/url]) and extracting it into your Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Tahoma]They overwrite each other and are safe to swap around even in mid-game, but you might not notice any changes if you load a save in an area where the NPCs have already spawned.[/font] I recommend installing the mod while you&#39;re not inside or even near a town or village.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Courier New][color=#c9daf8][size=5][b]Uninstallation:[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />Just deactivate/delete the file. Note that NPCs that have already spawned with the money might not lose that money until they respawn or the area resets.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Courier New][color=#c9daf8][size=5][b]Known Issues:[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />NPCs that you&#39;ve already met might not get the new money until they refresh, which is dependent on your game settings. I believe the default for towns is 10 days.\r<br />\r<br />You can force them to reset their inventory via console commands. With the console open, click on the NPC and type &#34;resetinventory&#34;. Note that it&#39;ll also refresh of any other things they had in inventory, including their clothing, and they&#39;ll lose any new items they may have taken since their last inventory refresh (like if they bought something from you).\r<br />\r<br />It also affects any container that uses the same money loot table as the NPCs, however, so you might be finding a lot of money in some boxes especially in homes. One confirmed example is the hunter start in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/?]Live Another Life - Alternate Start[/url], where the sack by your campsite is obviously using the NPC leveled list and may end up with a few thousand gold coins in it. In any case, the fact that you&#39;re using this mod means you&#39;re okay with that anyway lol.\r<br />\r<br />No other issues with starting a new game or entering a town for the first time.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Courier New][color=#c9daf8][size=5][b]Compatibility:[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />Should be compatible with anything that doesn&#39;t remove the vanilla pocket money leveled lists from NPCs. Mods that edit them such as adding or removing other items in the same leveled list are okay.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#c9daf8][size=5][b][font=Courier New]Recommended Mods:[/font][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35305/?]Your Market Stall[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38118/?]Become a Trainer[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Courier New][color=#c9daf8][size=5][b]Permissions:[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />Don&#39;t re-upload anywhere. You&#39;re free to edit this mod for personal use of course in case you don&#39;t like my settings, but don&#39;t re-upload without my permission.[/color]",
