  "descriptionHtml": "Eliza Avenicci lives with her parents in Whiterun, Warmaidens is were she conducts her business, buying and selling anything and with a 25,000 gold limit she can take just about anything you have picked up. Along with this, she also sells items that you cant buy anywhere else such as explosive arrows and a spell that makes you invisible anytime you want by pressing \\\"Z\\\" (default). \r\n\r\nShould not have any issues with other mods as she is a new character. Just make sure to sell your gear before buying as there is a cap of about 30k before it bugs out. This file is also available on Steam Workshop and does NOT require any DLC.",
