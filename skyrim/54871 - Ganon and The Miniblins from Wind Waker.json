  "descriptionHtml": "A project that a friend of mine and I came up with&#33;  Ganon and his Miniblins from Wind Waker.  All resources are completely fan-made, no ported assets.\r<br />\r<br />Out in the middle of the Ocean near Dawnstar is a tower jutting out from the sea...go up it and fight the legendary Ganon.  He is no push over.  Unless you force push him over.  But I wouldn&#39;t recommend that, since it takes out all the fun&#33;  He&#39;s level 100 and conjures an army of Miniblins so he&#39;s quite a challenge for any player, but I have faith in you that you can do it.\r<br />\r<br />He drops unique loot and also a tome that lets you conjure his Miniblins for yourself, I recommend using conjuration mods with it otherwise you&#39;ll only summon two at a time...they&#39;re way more fun in a group.",
