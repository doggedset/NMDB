  "summary": "A simple female dual wielding follower mod.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a follower named Verera to the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. She is specialises as a Theif meaning that she is best in light armour with one-handed weapons and bows. If given two one-handed weapons she will dual wield them. She levels with the character starting from 10 upwards. She is also marriageable. \r<br />\r<br />Installation: Simply place the .esp into your &#34;Skyrim/Data&#34; folder\r<br />\r<br />This mod was made using vanilla assets and thus does not require any other mod to function at its best. \r<br />\r<br />If you find any issues concerning this mod please leave a comment and if I can I will get right on it. \r<br />\r<br />This mod has been on Steam Workshop for quite some time and I never got round to adding it to the nexus. Regardless it&#39;s here now. Enjoy.",
