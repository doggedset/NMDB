  "descriptionHtml": "---README---\r<br />\r<br />for DALLs - Proudspire_Castle\r<br />\r<br />v2.0\r<br />\r<br />06/11/2012\r<br />\r<br />Proudspire_Castle is big n complex - multi-category mod with added fight Quest. In nut-shell, it gives you: new (world) location with big n Lordly Castle, new (potential) followers, free to have n own horses, various skill trainers, new items, new shops n merchants with money, new arms n armors, crafting facilities n recipes, Adventure (fight) Quest with challenging foes and lore-friendly extension of game story.\r<br />\r<br />Story so far: You have received formal invitation from your (long time lost relative) Lord Erik who would like to see you - his next of kin - some time soon.  \r<br />\r<br />His hereditary (Freehold) Lands and Mighty Proudspire Castle are located in Haafingar snow-cowered mountains - on map up and left of (town) Solitude. \r<br />\r<br />List of everything made and provided there would be very long and probably of small interest to most but you might be interested to know that Proudspire Castle (your new noble Home with the family crest) is living and breathing Fortified Realm (medieval castle with all appropriate trimmings) well-worth careful n through re-search. Castle (Guards) Garrison and house-hold servants have unique arms and armors as well as (to Proudspire Tower Quest related) intruding foes. Most of those (armors) you&#39;ll be able to craft / buy or win in the battle. If your loot bag is full or your marital skills are too low, Castle (Master Level) trainers and merchants who buy n sell loads of useful stuff might prove very useful. And finally, if you like vigorous sword practice and love Vampires n likes ;) - expect a bit of fun in my recapture (Proudspire Tower) Quest. Dawnguard (DLC) and human naked bodies (female/male nude models) - not required but recommended.  \r<br />\r<br />This mod is supplied with all for it necessary models/textures but it can be improved further with some other (my stand-alone) mods: \r<br />\r<br />Recommended additions:\r<br />\r<br />Ebony_Weapons\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5500\r<br />\r<br />Black_Iron\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22992\r<br />\r<br />Noble_Furniture\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7564\r<br /> \r<br />Alchemy_Workbench\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7866\r<br /> \r<br />Arcane_Enchanter \r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4332\r<br />\r<br />Cooking_Spit_n_Real_Fire\r<br />\r<br /> http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8068\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim_Faces_NPCs\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18760\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim_Nords\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/973 \r<br />\r<br /> \r<br />\r<br />To install you need to navigate to your Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim - game folder and paste / drag n drop in it my Data (mod) folder. Allow overwrite&#33;    \r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t like this mod, simply delete / remove my mod .esp (plug-in) as well as (check for names my unpacked mod) files from Data/meshes/ DallsGear together with textures from Data/textures/DallsGear. \r<br />\r<br />Bugs/conflicts: should be none.\r<br />\r<br />Note on v1.1: Some minor fixes and Proudspire Castle Guards now have (craft-able) steel shields and helmets (new textures). Otherwise same as v1.0.\r<br />\r<br />Note on v2.0: New n enlarged Castle interior (three new levels/locations) with added fight (Proudspire Tower) Quest. New NPCs (actors), armors, weapons, craft recipes, skill trainers, merchants, item storage n loot. Numerous other additions and some necessary fixes. If old user - remember to empty all display (weapon) racks in Main Hall Basement - prior to installation of this version&#33; \r<br />  \r<br />Use:\r<br />Free to use but if any files included (therein) are to be used for modding ask me for permission&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Important: For start - use save/s made somewhere other then my Proudspire Castle and Solitude (Exterior) Gate / Stables location&#33; Saves made in Solitude (inside city walls) should be fine for this purpose. \r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for really great game.\r<br />PS. Is this mod worth your time? If you can still think for yourself and you are not afraid to try something else a bit more complicated and deeper layered - not found or represented in Nexus Top 100s mod shallows at all - it definitely is&#33; I have been making game extending and retexture overhaul mods for last fifteen years - arguably quite successfully - which makes them all at least worth experimental try. In practice they represent - ten or more of single-purpose / different categories mods squeezed in one (DLC like) package. They were made to be permanent extensions n additions to my own game thus, they are safe n eminently useable but if not wanted - they and their content are very easy to remove without any harmful consequences to your saves.  If interested in other / similar (large-scale / multi-category) mods try - (my) Pine_Wood_Lodge, Arch_Mages_Tower, Temple and Princess.",
