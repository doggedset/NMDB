  "summary": "Have you ever walked around Skyrim, found the perfect location for your next home/dungeon/whatever, then spent ages trying to find that location in the CK? Yeah, me too. Very simple mod which adds a magic book which tells you what cell you&#39;re in when you read it. Obviously targeted at modders and not at players.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever walked around Skyrim, found the perfect location for your next home/dungeon/whatever, then spent ages trying to find that location in the CK? Yeah, me too.\r<br />\r<br />So what you do is you load this mod. Open the console. Type &#34;help modder&#34;. This will show a book called &#34;A modder&#39;s proposal&#34;. Add this book to your inventory. Now every time you read this book you will get a messagebox telling you what cell you&#39;re in. Just the numbers, you should now be able to find it quickly in the CK if you sort the cell view window by coords. Ridiculously simple, and possibly only useful for simpletons like me who don&#39;t like scrolling endlessly around in the render window trying to find that spot.\r<br />\r<br />Probably will give nonsense results when read inside, it&#39;s for external cells. Will work for any external worldspace (Tamriel, Blackreach, Whiterunworld, your custom worldspace).",
