  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ffa07a]Cleaned with Tes5Edit V3.0.31[/color]\r<br /> \r<br />[b][color=#ff8c00]Description/Features[/color][/b]\r<br /> \r<br />[b][color=#ff8c00]I&#39;m uploading this as is, as it was never really intended for anything other than personal use. If you have any issues, please let me know and I will fix them to the best of my abilities.[/color][/b]\r<br /> \r<br />If you haven&#39;t built the manor yet, the house will be completely empty except for a desk in the main bedroom that has the Stone of Barenziah on it.\r<br />You still need to purchase everything from Falk Firebeard as you would normally. I linked everything in the house to the existing xmarkers, so when you buy the living room you will also get other parts of the house. Purchase the alchemy room to furnish the housecarl bedroom etc. \r<br />The armory will not be accessible until you buy the Enchanting room. The reason for this being that the mannequins lost their minds when I linked them to an xmarker.\r<br /> \r<br />If you have the manor already, be sure to take everything out of the house first, BEFORE you install this mod.\r<br />\r<br /> ```````````````````````````````````````\r<br />[b][color=#ff8c00]Quick update 2014/03/14[/color]\r<br />I&#39;ve uploaded a new zip file containing two files. They both fix a stupid mistake on my end, namely invisible chairs. My humble apologies for this. There is a version with the spiders on the stairwell, and one without. Please choose only one and copy the .esp to your data folder. Overwrite. \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff8c00]Quick update 2013/10/27[/color][/b]\r<br />There seems to be an issue with the kitchen wall/fireplace, but it also seems to be random. I have uploaded a new esp that duplicates that specific wall and puts it in exactly the same spot. This should fix it. \r<br />I have also gotten rid of the old staircase, so there should be no phantom walls popping up.\r<br />The wall that sometimes block the children&#39;s room is a [i]vanilla bug[/i]. If you have that issue, open the console, click on the wall and type disable.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff8c00]Quick update 2013/11/14[/color][/b]\r<br />There is now a second optional .esp for those who is missing a wall in the living room.\r<br />\r<br />````````````````````````````````````````\r<br />\r<br />This is my second attempt at modding Proudspire. The first one was a total bust, but I like the house so I gave it another go.\r<br />I did not add working taps and showers and washbasins and and and... Not because I don&#39;t think they are cool, but simply because I never use them.  \r<br />A lot of time was spent testing this mod to make sure that the wife and kids behave, and I am happy to say that all is well this time around. \r<br />I made it according to my own tastes, but I&#39;m sure there are at least a few other people who will enjoy the changes I&#39;ve made. \r<br />All storage containers are set to not respawn, so you can store away your loot safely anywhere in the house.\r<br /> \r<br />The biggest structural changes:\r<br />[color=#ffa07a](Please, if you don&#39;t like the idea of the outside not matching the inside, then this is not for you. That being said, the changes are not so extreme that you would feel like the inside stretches to the Bards College)[/color]\r<br />[LIST]\r<br />[*]The staircase is wider (Like the one in the Bards College)[/*]\r<br />[*]The children&#39;s bedroom is bigger by half of the original Hearthfire bedroom[/*]\r<br />[*]The main bedroom is bigger by half as well (of the original bedroom)[/*]\r<br />[*]The kitchen moved to directly beneath the children&#39;s bedroom and is also the same size. [/*]\r<br />[*]The area in front of the two bedrooms upstairs is slightly bigger[/*]\r<br />[*]There is a &#34;bedroom&#34; for Jordis SwordMaiden[/*]\r<br />[/LIST]\r<br />The house [i]is not [/i]littered with clutter.
