  "descriptionHtml": "This is not actually a mod - just a retexture of the waterskin from Realistic Needs and Diseases mod. \n<br />Why? Because I saw someone say they didn't like the checkered look of the original, and I was already messing with textures, so... why not? \n<br />Here you go, a full-leather waterskin. Enjoy. :)\n<br />\n<br />EDIT (03.03.2018) - Now also works for Campfire\n<br />I didn't realize that the waterskin dangling from the backpack uses a different texture than the one seen in inventory. My bad! Thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/41591805]Wyllowynd[/url] for pointing it out! :)\n<br />\n<br />(I don't use iNeed so I can't be 100% sure, but judging from  [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/41591805]Wyllowynd[/url]'s comment, the Campfire uses it's own mesh when working with iNeeds, so this retexture should work just fine for all your iNeeds).",
