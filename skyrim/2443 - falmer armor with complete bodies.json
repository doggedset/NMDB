  "descriptionHtml": "falmer armor is a rare heavy armor (so far, I have found two instances of it, in game).  Bethesda\\'s stock implementation of this armor did rude things to the bodies of the people wearing it.  (It neutered the men and destroyed the hips of the women.)\r\n\r\nOther than fixing the bodies themselves, this is all the work of some creative person that worked for Bethesda.\r\n\r\nNote that this mod does not provide any new textures, it uses the textures you already have installed.\r\n\r\nHistoric aside:  Comments were originally broken on this mod.  They have been fixed.  I do not know if any community focus on this mod would have developed had comments been possible from the start.\r\n\r\nBased on thepal\\'s female mesh and TheGal\\'s male mesh",
