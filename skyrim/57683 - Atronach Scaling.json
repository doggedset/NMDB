  "summary": "Enables conjured creature&#39;s level and damage scaling.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Mod description:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Edited values for various Skyrim, Dawnguard and Dragonborn summons to enable their [u]scaling with player level[/u]. Not all creatures scale in a 1:1 ratio, some of the weaker ones scale with 0.75 of player level - meaning, when you&#39;re level 20, they will be 15.\r<br />Changed health/magicka/stamina offsets on some of them in order to make them [u]less squishy[/u] compared to Dawnguard summons.\r<br />Added custom perks to [u]scale destruction spell damage[/u], [u]melee damage[/u] and [u]marksman[/u] (archery) damage for conjured creatures. The only summon who didn&#39;t get any of those custom perks is the Dremora Lord who already has plenty of melee perks by default.\r<br />What those perks do is add a multiplier to their spell magnitude (if using spells) or attack damage magnitude (if using weapons). As your conjured creatures rise in levels, their primary attack skill rises as well - which boosts their damage.\r<br />\r<br />Main file contains one .esp which requires Skyrim + DLCs. Older 1.1 version contains three separate .esp&#39;s for people with one or no DLCs.\r<br />The archive also contains a readme file with all the changes. Or click the readme tab right here on Nexusmods to see all the creatures which were covered by this mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Main file requirements are:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />AtronachScaling.esp\r<br />- requires Skyrim, Dawnguard, Dragonborn\r<br />\r<br />[b]\r<br />Old version file requirements are:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />AtronachScaling.esp\r<br />- requires Skyrim + Unofficial Skyrim Patch\r<br />\r<br />AtronachScalingDawnguard.esp\r<br />- requires Skyrim + Dawnguard\r<br />\r<br />AtronachScalingDragonborn.esp\r<br />- requires Skyrim + Dragonborn\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Install via NMM, or manually by copying the three .esp files into your Skyrim/Data folder.\r<br />To uninstall, banish or wait until your summons expire; save and exit game; deselect the plugins or remove them from your Skyrim/Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility:\r<br />[/b]\r<br />Compatible with Smaller Atronachs mod ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9052/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9052/?[/url]).\r<br />Compatible with any mod that adds new spells, but doesn&#39;t modify default conjuration spells. Unfortunately any new summons won&#39;t be affected by this mod.\r<br />\r<br />Incompatible with any mod that directly changes the actor values for player summons. \r<br />What the hell does that mean? For instance, Empowered Magic mod scales summons as well (to a lesser degree) and my mod would overwrite those changes. [b]BUT&#33;[/b], Empowered Magic changes many conjuration perks and has multiple summoning options, some of which will exist without conflict with this mod - and will not be affected by it at all&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Recommended mods:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I greatly recommend using SkyTweak ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33395/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33395/?[/url]) and Deadly Dragons + Deadly Monsters ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3829/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3829/?[/url]).\r<br />SkyTweak allows you to configure many game aspects in a clean MCM menu, and all of its settings have explanations and suggestions. Use it to enable magic scaling for other spell schools (including conjuration to enable improved necromancy scaling).\r<br />Deadly Dragons + Deadly Monsters allows you to increase dragon and enemy attributes + damage, spell damage and defense. Use it so you don&#39;t feel overpowered too soon.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Permissions:\r<br />\r<br />[/b]If anyone wants to make further edits, feel free to do so, just put this mod in your credits.\r<br />The mod has been uploaded only to the Nexus, please don&#39;t upload it to other sites or Steam.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits:\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Bethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r<br />\r<br />Also, whoever endorsed this first - whooooooaaaaa&#33; Never expected that, and not so soon&#33; That feeling of joy was amazing&#33; I don&#39;t know who you are, but you get credit as well, &#39;cos that joy made me scour the creation kit for better ways to make this little mod better&#33;\r<br />OMG, 2 endorsments now&#33;&#33; Well shiver me timbers, that&#39;s 2 more than I ever expected.\r<br />\r<br />[b]\r<br />Future updates:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I still don&#39;t know many things about the Creation Kit. As I learn about new things and possibilities this mod might get further updates to make it even better.\r<br />Of course, suggestions are welcome, encouraged even&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Change log:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />v1.0\r<br />- Level scaling enabled.\r<br />\r<br />v1.1\r<br />\r<br />- Changed level scaling ratio to be more consistent across summon types.\r<br />- Added custom perks to scale summon&#39;s damage as their primary skill increases (Destruction, One-handed, Two-handed or Archery). Their damage will increase from 1.00 skill magnitude at 1 skill to 2.00 skill magnitude at 100 skill; potent thralls will scale up to 2.25.\r<br />- Changed some health/magicka/stamina offsets to increase or decrease those attributes.\r<br />\r<br />v1.1a\r<br />- Combined three .esp files into one.\r<br />- Added an additional custom perk which is active only when summons are above level 50 and have reached 100 skill point in their primary skill. It further scales their damage by a factor of 1.5 and stacks with the previous damage scaling perk. It was made specifically with Deadly Monsters in mind and increased enemy health. It will be overpowered otherwise&#33;\r<br />\r<br />v.1.2\r<br />- Combined three .esp files into one.\r<br />- Changed how the perk works (amazingly, there&#39;s actually a multiplier that will scale with every single skill point&#33;) so now each level your summons will become a little bit stronger.\r<br />- Found out that if you want to use the Empowered Magic mod - go ahead, but if you take the transfusion perk then anything from this mod won&#39;t affect your new summons.",
