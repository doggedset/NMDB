  "descriptionHtml": "INTRODUCTION:\r<br />\r<br />Now you can play as Kirby in Skyrim. To play as Kirby, select from the list of races in the character creation menu and select Kirby, just don&#39;t mess with anything other than gender and name. If you don&#39;t want to start a new game to play as Kirby, just open up the console with &#34;~&#34; button on your keyboard and type ShowRaceMenu. If you polymorph after changing characters using this cheat, it will cause you to go back into the last race you were. If you wanted to be Kirby again, just type in the cheat again and pick him.\r<br />\r<br />Race is based off of the Nord race, so all attributes from the nord race are in the Kirby race. When you equip armor, it won&#39;t be visible but you will still get the effects of the armor. Also people in game may think you&#39;re naked, even if you&#39;re wearing clothes.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Check the mod under Data Files after starting up Skyrim, or in Nexus Manager. To install manually, download from Nexus and extract into the Skyrim Directory.\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALL:\r<br />\r<br />Before you uninstall, please make sure you switch to a vanilla race(ex: Nord) before uninstalling the mod, or else it will crash your game every time you open that saved file.To uninstall manually, uncheck the mod from the Data Files on the Skyrim pop-up menu. Then delete KirbyMod.esp from Data directory, and delete all related files from the meshes and textures directories if necessary.\r<br />\r<br />CHANGE LOG:\r<br />\r<br />3/8/17: Mod was released\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS:\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim belongs to Bethesda\r<br />Kirby belongs to nintendo\r<br />sfm model from:Â https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=104512876\r<br />",
