  "summary": "So you got letter from Calcelmo that he wants dwarven artifact, but you disenchanted it and can\\'t complete quest?",
  "descriptionHtml": "Calcelmo in Markarth gives quests occasionally to buy dwarven artifact from you. Often times it happens that they have so good enchants, that you have disenchanted them (arsorb life and fortify alchemy to name a few i came across). But when you go deliver the quest, your only dialog option is \\\"Actually, I\\'m not sure I have it anymore.\\\".\r\n\r\nThis mod makes a minor change in this quest dialog, and makes \\\"Sure. Take a look.\\\" always available, by removing its visibility condition. Meaning that you can complete the quest, without actually having the item, for measly 100 gold or so (hardly immersion braker or cheat). Clean quest log is what we all want! Obviously the \\\"Sure. Take a look.\\\" will only show while on the quest, not afterwards. This is a quest that can appear several times per character, appearing in Misc-quest journal.",
