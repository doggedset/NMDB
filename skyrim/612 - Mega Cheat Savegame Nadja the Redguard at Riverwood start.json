  "descriptionHtml": "Mega Cheat Savegame Nadja the Redguard at Riverwood start (no quests done yet) All skills, perks, gold, lockpicks, super armor/weaps. I recommend playing this at hardest difficulty and only if you already finished the game in standard difficulty without cheats. \r\n\r\nShe hasn\\'t done anything yet, but Nadja has full dragonplate armor/shield, daedric sword/bow/arrows(20K), all skills at 100 with all perks. She\\'s moves 4 times faster than normal. She also has 9999 magicka/health/stamina. She has 2Million gold, 20K lockpicks. 20k grand soulgems black/white, and 20k potions of prolonged invisibility. Shout delay set to 0.  I didn\\'t add the shouts and spells because it\\'s more fun to discover them one by one. Max carryweight set to 200,000!\r\n\r\nNote: I have a few plugins installed so you might get a warning about missing objects the first time you load the save if you don\\'t install them but I think it can be ignored or you can install them if you prefer.\r\n\r\nNote: If you click on (required files) link to the right, you will get a quick link to the mods mentioned below although they\\'re not really required just recommended.\r\n\r\nI have the following mods installed:\r\n- more zoom in eagle eye archery and less stamina\r\n- nude female body  (by the pal)\r\n- get all arrows back from corpses\r\n- more revealing glass/wolf/fur/forsworn armor\r\n- enhanced eyes and high elf eye replacement\r\n- high rez roadsigns\r\n- increased jumpheight\r\n- no intro movie\r\n- texture blockiness fix\r\n- younger faces\r\n- enable lockpick with arrow keys",
