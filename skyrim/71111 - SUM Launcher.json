  "summary": "A script to run SkyProc jar files",
  "descriptionHtml": "Basically some users, and myself, of SkyProc mods have had issues running the .jar file that needs to be ran after installation. After looking into it, some people recommended right-clicking and running with cmd (command prompt). It did not work so I found that you needed to run it with Admin cmd. After trying to help a buddy of mine I decided to make this little executable script that starts cmd as admin, changes the directory to where the jar file is located, and launches the jar file. Since I have it I might as well share it with the community.\r<br />\r<br />For use with these mods (there may be more, these are just the ones I know of):\r<br />Dual Sheath Redux http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34155/?\r<br />ReProccer http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28467/?\r<br />SUM (If you use multiple mods that need this done use this one and it does all of them at the same time) http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29865/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Usage:\r<br />1. Unrar the file.\r<br />2. Right click the .cmd file and select edit\r<br />3. Check if the third to last line contains the install directory to your SkyProc Patcher jar file, if it doesn&#39;t go ahead and change the directory to the correct install path\r<br />4. Exit and save\r<br />5. Run the .cmd file and use the SkyProc Patcher as per their instructions ",
