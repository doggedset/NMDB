Together with his Wife Juna, they live in Solitude.\n<br />Juna is a Member of Stendarr and a stronge Mage, Ragnar is high rank Soldier from Solitude who became a Paladin later in life.\n<br />Their Sons, Thoralf and Fynn live thei[/size][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3]r own life.[/size][/font][size=3] Fynn, the youngest one uses magic like his Mother, so he made his way to the College of Winterhold.\n<br />The older Brother Thoralf is more like his father, he used to be a Soldier aswell, but then he joined the fight against the Vampires.\n<br />(P.S. Juna knows magic well, that's why she looks younger XD)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />In order to work, you'll need Relationship Dialogue Overhaul. Fynn uses a normal Vanilla Voice, Thoralf and Ragnar need the Mod in order to follow you.\n<br />Juna is not able to follow you, she's only there to complete the Family. :P\n<br />No body or skin texture/mesh is included, so you can use whatever you have.\n<br />\n<br />I tried something new this time, giving the Characters different Factions, Voices and Ragnar is a Trainer for Block.\n<br />Non of them starts at a very high level, also they level with you.\n<br />Fynn from 3 - x\n<br />Thoralf from 4 - x\n<br />Ragnar from 5 - x\n<br />\n<br />Thoralf and Fynn are both young and strong, ready to get married.. :P\n<br />Ragnar is married to Juna.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/TjBBsCB.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />-[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74568]Relationship Dialogue Overhaul[/url] is Required\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/QAwti7T.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />-Follower Overhaul Mod like EFF, AFT, UFO is recommanded\n<br />[url=https://www.vectorplexus.com/index.php?/files/file/10-sam-%E2%80%94-shape-atlas-for-men/]-SAM - Shape Atlas for Men[/url] is recommanded for the Men to have a great way to make them look individually\n<br />-The Eyes of Beauty is recommanded to make Fynn's and Ragnar's eyes look like mine\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cfe2f3][b][img]https://i.imgur.com/kvnGMsN.png[/img][/b]\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311]KS Hairdos - Renewal[/url] by Kalilies Stealthic Khaos and Shocky\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79735]Salt and Wind - Rough Hair for KS Hairdos[/url] by Jasper \n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722]The Eyes Of Beauty[/url] by Gabriel Mailhot as LogRaam\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73605]Ixum's Tattoos[/url] by Ixum\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84400]Immersive Warpaints and tattoos[/url] by Reptileye\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624]RaceMenu[/url] by Expired\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40494]NPC Nif Scope[/url] by Turulo\n<br />Skyrim by Bethesda\n<br />Creation Kit by Bethesda\n<br />[color=#cfe2f3]\n<br />\n<br />[/color][b][color=#cfe2f3][img]https://i.imgur.com/NWM2B00.png[/img][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84941]Dx's Follower - Thor[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/87886/?]\n<br />Dx's Preset - Redguard Mihail - SAM[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86542/?]Dx's Follower Pack - Real People - SAM - SOS - Better males[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88749/?]Dx's Follower Pack - Demons - SAM - SOS - Better Males[/url]﻿[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/89491]\n<br />Dx's Presets - Elves - SAM[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90516]Dx's ClefJ's Villages[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90638]Dx's Follower - Freston Family[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/91562]Dx's Logga Siblings - Orc Followers[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/91703]Dx's Elf Squad - Male Elves Follower\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/92708]Dx's Better Men of Skyrim[/url][/size][/font]",
