  "descriptionHtml": "***LOOONG Overdue update needed for this mod - so sorry about this&#33; This *should* not interfere or crash the Collage of Winterhold quests anymore&#33;*** -  Dec 2013 - Report any..thing?\r<br />\r<br />Experimenting with the various Nordic, Imperial and otherwise Building designs, I thought I have a go at created my very own Mountain fortress.\r<br />\r<br />Its suituated ontop of a lone Mountain that is far west of Whiterun and is basically a skeleton of a Fortress right now.\r<br />\r<br />It is currently a modder&#39;s resource to further expand upon. It uses the designs of High Hrothgar, Ancient Nordic temples, Windhelm and Imperial fort designs aswell as The College of Winterhold tower... It may also have Solitude thrown in someplace but I forget.\r<br />\r<br />It has a very similar interiors based on the High Hrothgar interior but I am making lots of edits to it so it has a veriaty of features to begin with. There are also interiors based of existing ones but tweaked about and ripe for decoration. They are all unowned.\r<br />\r<br />I will add storage areas soon.\r<br />\r<br />The history of this Fortress that it was intentionally to be another Nordic crypt but the Nords who were to be buried here were lost at sea so another Nordic family bought the place but decided to move into the place. Over time, it saw many owners and keepers so now it is up for graps.\r<br />\r<br />Its not exactly lore-friendly interms of &#34;oh look&#33; There is a honking great big castle  on a mountain&#33; Lets ignore it for a thousand years and go about our business untill we move it&#33; Oh My&#33; It looks fantastic despite it&#39;s age&#33;&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Its just another player home. I will add a Boss guy you will have to kill in order to properly move into it&#33;",
