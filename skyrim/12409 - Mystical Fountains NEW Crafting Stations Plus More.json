  "descriptionHtml": "I found an unused furniture object in the Creation Kit, the \\\"Disenchantment Font\\\" and thought it looked awesome! So I came up with an idea for a whole new crafting station, the Mystical Fountain! Comes in multiple skill varieties with UNIQUE Crafting keywords and even a nonspecific keyword! Also includes Mystical Colorful Lights, Sample Recipes for all fountains including potions and armor! All neatly tucked into an easy access warehouse cell!\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\n- Detailed Custom Re-texture of the Disenchantment Fountain texture\r\n- New Warehouse for testing and easy access when modding: aaMysticFountainWarehouse\r\n+- Use console code \\\"COC aaMysticFountainWarehouse\\\" (without quotes) to enter warehouse\r\n- New Potions and Poisons made at the various fountains\r\n- Various New Recipes for items in in this mod\r\n- Easy to find Crafting Keywords and associated skills\r\n+- Unique Fountain for each skill option!\r\n+-- \\\"CraftingMysticalFountainKYWD\\\" General, Not tied to any skill\r\n+-- \\\"CraftingMysticalFountainAlchKYWD\\\" Alchemy\r\n+-- \\\"CraftingMysticalFountainAlterKYWD\\\" Alteration\r\n+-- \\\"CraftingMysticalFountainConjureKYWD\\\" Conjuration\r\n+-- \\\"CraftingMysticalFountainDestructKYWD\\\" Destruction\r\n+-- \\\"CraftingMysticalFountainEnchKYWD\\\" Enchanting\r\n+-- \\\"CraftingMysticalFountainILLUSKYWD\\\" Illusion\r\n+-- \\\"CraftingMysticalFountainRestKYWD\\\" Rest\r\n+- Simple change of keywords to mix and match any existing recipes!\r\n- Various Items you can make or use to test things out are laying around the room!\r\n- Custom Colorful Lights set up as suggested light sources to use with the Mystical Fountains or just by themselves!\r\n- Released as MODDER\\'S RESOURCE available for anyone to use as long as you ASK ME for permission and give me credit, as well as Bethesda for their original model and this great game!\r\n\r\nNEW UPLOAD: An alternative file that adds a NEW \\\"Arcane Fountain\\\" in the Arcanaeum, as well as improving the library lighting! The Arcane Fountain is flagged with all the keywords and as such is able to use any recipe created using the CraftingMysticalFountain keywords! Note: I will not release a file with the Arcane Fountain and no Arcanaeum lighting edits, as this was the original idea and the most logical In-Game placement I could come up with. :D\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\nBethesda Softworks\r\nTheNexus\r\nAnd of course, praise be to the divines! :D",
