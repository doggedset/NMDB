Because I removed those construction items once my manor was finished, they were utterly useless now and I wanted to make some free space there.\r<br />Plus my npcs/ followers sometimes tried to get over the grindstone/ workbench so they got stuck on them, now when these items are moved more to the right the npcs no longer stumble over them.\r<br />\r<br />You will need to remove the drafting table, chest, carpenters workbench manually in game by opening the console, select each item and type &#34;markfordelete&#34; then save and load again.\r<br />But make a back-up save first in case you delete the wrong item.\r<br />Just beware that when uninstalling this mod the drafting table, chest, carpenters workbench will not return, you use &#34;markfordelete&#34; on them so they are gone forever.\r<br />\r<br />[color=ORANGE][b]~~~~~~Installation:~~~~~~[/b][/color]\r<br />* Always make back-up saves before trying new mods.\r<br />* Make sure you are far away from Lakeview manor before installing.\r<br />* Nexus Mod Manager: download the .ESP file and activate it to install.\r<br />* Manual: open the 7zip file, then drag and drop the .ESP file into Skyrim&#39;s Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[color=ORANGE][b]~~~~~~Uninstallation:~~~~[/b][/color]\r<br />* Make sure you are far away from Lakeview manor before uninstalling, wait 40+ days.\r<br />* You can deactivate and uninstall from Nexus Mod Manager, or manually delete the mod.\r<br />\r<br />[color=ORANGE][b]~~~~~~Extra:~~~~~~~~~~~~[/b][/color]\r<br />* To let [b]wait time[/b] go faster, open console and type &#34;TFC&#34;, one day will pass in a second now instead of waiting for every single hour to pass, when done type &#34;TFC&#34; again.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f9cb9c][size=1]Disclaimer:\r<br />In case Nexus website shuts down and/or I am no longer around, then you can upload/convert this mod to other websites for the purpose of FREE redistribution.
