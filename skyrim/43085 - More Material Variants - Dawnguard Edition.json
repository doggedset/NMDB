  "summary": "More Material Variants aims to expand the use of an armour style beyond the point where it would normally become obsolete. This is done by creating more material variants of your favorite armour, with each variant having better stats to reflect its stronger material. ",

Well More Material Variants is a solution to the problem which arises once your favorite armor is no longer strong enough for your needs. At this point you have to decide whether or not you want to keep your good looking armor or move onto something which doesn\\'t look as nice. Well with this mod I aim to remove this decision by making More Material Variants of each of your favorite armors. So far I have only MMV\\'d Dawnguard Armor but if it proves popular enough I will do more.[/center]\r\n\r\n[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/43085-3-1380385295.png[/img]\r\n[center]Each armor set has its own texture and improved stats. All of the armor pieces can be crafted and tempered.\r\nThis mod adds the following material variants to Dawnguard Heavy Armour:\r\nDwarven\r\nOrichalcum\r\nEbony\r\nDaedric\r\n\r\nIt also adds the following material variants to Dawnguard Light Armour:\r\nElven\r\nGlass \r\nEach of the light armor cuirasses you can be crafted into three variants: Sleeveless, no pauldrons and single pauldron.[/center] \r\n\r\n[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/43085-4-1380385296.png[/img]\r\n[center]The armour can be crafted, providing you have the relevant smithing perks, or it can be obtained from Gunmar in Fort Dawnguard. You will need to be of a high enough level in order for them to appear in his shop though.[/center]\r\n\r\n[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/43085-5-1380385296.png[/img]\r\n[center]This mod only requires Dawnguard.[/center]\r\n\r\n[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/43085-1-1380385313.png[/img]\r\n[center]If you enjoy the mod please endorse, if this mod proves popular enough I may MMV more armor types.\r\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or bugs please let me know in the comments.[/center]",
