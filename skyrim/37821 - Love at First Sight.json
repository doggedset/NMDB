  "descriptionHtml": "[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/xbDPWdF.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds some more marriage options into Skyrim, as I felt there was not enough choice in the vanilla game. Currently, this mod adds 3 new marriable NPCs into the game, who can be found in inns, and converts one existing NPC (Hroki) so she is a candidate for marriage. Currently, one of the included NPCs is also a follower, and was supposed to be a mage, however she always uses her bow, and I do not know how to fix this. if anyone does, please PM me. This is a BETA release, which is why there are so few NPCs. Please tell me if the mod works well, and I will add many more, and convert some NPCs by request very soon. Currently only includes female NPCs, but if someone requests it, I will add male NPCs too. In the screenshots, I am running CBBE, including the Facial Texture pack, so the NPCs may not look exactly like in the screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE: I will no longer be working on this mod, due to real live events that prevent me from having the time to mod or play the game at the moment.",
