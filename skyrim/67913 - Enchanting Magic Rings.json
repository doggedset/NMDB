  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve recently started playing with more mages, and I was pretty frustrated that enchanting only worked for removing the magicka cost, rather than helping boost the power of the spells. Sure, I could use potions, but it would be nice for equippable gear, or even boost the spell power with reducing the cost on armor, for example. \r<br />\r<br />I searched through the Nexus, and couldn&#39;t find anything that would help me boost my Destruction or Restoration power, so I buckled down and made my first mod. \r<br />\r<br />I made 8 rings to boost each school of magic (and speechcraft, since in game objects that help with that are unenchantable), in the various ways available through the Creation Kit. Each ring itself is fairly weak, giving only an increase of 5 points/percent, but the point of them aren&#39;t to have powerful rings, but to use them for enchanting your own gear. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />From the Read Me\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Simply Drop the .esp in your Data Folder, or open the archive in NMM.\r<br />\r<br />Rings are accessed through the console for now, just search for\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Alchemy Ring&#34;\r<br />&#34;Alteration Ring&#34;\r<br />&#34;Conjuration Ring&#34;\r<br />&#34;Destruction Ring&#34;\r<br />&#34;Enchantment Ring&#34;\r<br />&#34;Illusion Ring&#34;\r<br />&#34;Restoration Ring&#34;\r<br />&#34;Speech Ring&#34;\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod, so is probably pretty rough. I&#39;m open to suggestions, and if anybody wants to make a quest to get  the rings, or something, just shoot me a message. Please ask if you wish to use them in another mod. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE (7.20.15)\r<br />\r<br />Restutitor Orbis added crafting recipes, and has allowed me to upload his edit. It is in the optional section, and the rings are now craftable using a lesser soul gem and a silver ingot at the tanning rack.",
