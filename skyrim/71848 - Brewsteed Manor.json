I took me a while to make and I hope you guys can use it as a template for your own player home.\r<br />\r<br />This was a player home I was working on before Fallout 4 was announced. When Fallout 4 got announced I got distracted because I wanted to prepare for the next gen Creation Kit.\r<br />\r<br />Everyone is allowed to use this in their player home creations. I would love to see this player home finished but I didn&#39;t have the time to finish it. Sorry if it looks bad that I put unfinished work on the Nexus. I really wanted people to have this player home mod and I didn&#39;t prepare for Fallout 4 to be announced so quickly xD\r<br />\r<br />So feel free to use this in your creations. I give all permission for use in other projects.\r<br />\r<br />If you manage to finish it, I would love to see it&#33;",
