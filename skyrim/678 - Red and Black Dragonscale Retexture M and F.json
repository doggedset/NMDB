  "descriptionHtml": "I always thought the original Dragon Scale armour looked a little dull, and didn\\'t really go with anything. so I decided to retexture the whole thing to make it look a little more.. interesting.\r\nThe scales themselves are now a deep red while the underarmour has been darkened to a near black colour. However, the horns and metal have been left the same, I figured it looked alright as it was.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve only done red and black for now, but if you have want to see some different colours, feel free to leave a request and I\\'ll get on it :)",
