They were located near the ratway, and had very few members. As time went by, they could not find anymore members, and most of them died off from old age... and dragon attacks. Before the last died off, he went and found a little boy and stole him from his family. Obviously the family was sad, buuutttt they got eaten by a dragon.\r<br />\r<br />   &#34;The boy grew older and learned to fight. He didn&#39;t get the Nightingale armor until he turned 18, and that was the year the last of the Official Nightingales died. He did not die of old age though, he died because of a bandit ambush. Furious, the boy put on the armor and killed all the bandits. Even though that was not his real father, he was treated well.\r<br />\r<br />   &#34;He set out to kill many bandits, and he did. His armor was ripped, broken, everything to make it look like he faced a great war and won. Before his final day til Sovnguard, he assembled the new generation of Nightingales. Final, on his final day, he hid his armor in hopes that a true warrior would find it. He hid it where only a true adventurer would find it. He died in front of all his comrades, and his armor has not ever been found... until now.\r<br />\r<br />   &#34;A search party of Nightingales went and found the armor, and kept it so that only a true warrior would get it. They have never touched it since...&#34;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />============================================================================================\r<br />\r<br />[size=30][b]INSTALLING:[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Different Skyrim Way(Other then Steam)[/b]:\r<br />1.
