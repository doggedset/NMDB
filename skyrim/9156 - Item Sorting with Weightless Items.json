  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Item Sorting with Weightless Items[/b]\r\nby saige\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[b]What this Mod does[/b]\r\n\r\nThis mod basically combines my version of an Item Sorting mod plus a Weightless item mod into one ESP file. My load order was getting larger as new mods are released so I really needed to cut down some ESP files. With the release of the CK, I decided to make one for myself that suited my tastes and released it for anybody else that might be interested.\r\n\r\nCurrently this mod works as follows;\r\n\r\nPotions and poisons have been renamed to be grouped together so that they\\'re easier to find. Player made potions should match their loot/bought versions. Such as Potion of Healing. All potions including player made now weight 0. Also note that special potions/beverages still retain their original name. Here\\'s an example of their sorting:\r\n\r\nEsbern\\'s Potion\r\nFortify: Sneak II\r\nFortify: Magicka Regen IV\r\nPotion of Invisibility III\r\nPotion of Healing\r\nPotion of Healing I\r\nPotion of Healing IV\r\nPoison: Weak to Fire III\r\nPoison: Stamina Damage V\r\nResist: Frost [Ice Wraith Essence]\r\nResist: Shock IV\r\n\r\nAll Soul gems now weight 0 and have been renamed per the following:\r\n\r\nSoul Gem Azura: Azura\\'s Star\r\nSoul Gem Azura: The Black Star\r\nSoul Gem I: Petty\r\nSoul Gem II: Lesser\r\nSoul Gem III: Common\r\nSoul Gem IV: Greater\r\nSoul Gem V: Grand\r\nSoul Gem VI: Black\r\n\r\nMost Smithing items now weight 0 (this also includes Dragon Bones, Firewood, Leather and scraps) and have been labeld per the following:\r\n\r\nOre: \\\"Type\\\"\r\nIngot: \\\"Type\\\"\r\nGem: \\\"Type\\\"\r\nHide: \\\"Type\\\" (This includes pelts and other hides such as Dragon Scales and Chaurus Chitin)\r\nSmelt: \\\"Type\\\" (For the Dwemer items that are smeltable. These items are a quarter of their original weight. ie Weighed 20, now 5)\r\n\r\nAll Miscellaneous Quest items now weight 0 and use the \\\"Quest:\\\" Label. This will also make them easier to spot. Please note that quest weapons and apparel are not included so they have no change to either name or weight. Also note that some radial miscellaneous quest items are done at random and may not have a quest label (such as the bard instrument quests). Unique items will instead use a \\\"Unique:\\\" label and also weight 0. Here\\'s an example of their sorting:\r\n\r\nPantea\\'s Flute\r\nQuest: Curious SIlver Mold\r\nQuest: Diamond Claw\r\nQuest: Fragment of Wuuthrad\r\nUnique: Moth in a Jar\r\nUnique: The Dancer\\'s Flute\r\n\r\nAll miscellaneous and other clutter items will just use the \\\"Misc:\\\" label. For the large part their weight has not been touched. However some clutter items that are used by other crafting/armor mods (such as Charcoal) have had their weight made to 0 but they will still be labeled with \\\"Misc:\\\". For example:\r\n\r\nMisc: Charcoal\r\nMisc: Dwemer Pan\r\nMisc: Fork\r\nMisc: Lockpick\r\nMisc: Plate\r\n\r\nAll books, notes and letters have had their weight changed to 0. For the large part their names remain unchanged with the exception of skill books, so they\\'re easier to find, and spell tomes. Here\\'s an example for how they appear:\r\n\r\nRacial Phylogeny [Restoration]\r\nSpell Tome [Alt I]: Candlelight\r\nSpell Tome [Dest II]: Lightning Rune\r\nSpell Tome [Rest II]: Fast Healing\r\nThe Black Arrow, v2 [Archery]\r\n\r\nAll food has a weight of 0 and has been relabeled to either have \\\"Beverage:\\\", \\\"Cheese:\\\", \\\"Cooked:\\\", \\\"Fruit:\\\", \\\"Raw:\\\", \\\"Sweet:\\\" or \\\"Veg:\\\". For example:\r\n\r\nBeverage: Alto Wine\r\nCheese: Mammoth Bowl\r\nCooked: Salmon Steak\r\nFruit: Green Apple\r\nRaw: Pheasant Breast\r\nSweet: Sweet Roll\r\nVeg: Leek\r\n\r\nArrows have had no weight change but have been relabeled to:\r\n\r\nArrow: \\\"Type\\\"\r\n\r\nFinally, while no change has been made to their names, Scrolls and Alchemy Ingredients all weight 0.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\n\r\nVery easy, either use NMM to download and activate the plugin. Otherwise drop directly into\r\n\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data \r\n\r\nand activate the plugin via the Skyrim Launcher under Data Files.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[b]Mod Load Order[/b]\r\n\r\nThe ESP file can go anywhere.\r\n\r\nHowever make sure that if you\\'re using any other mods that also modify the stats for items that they go after in the load order so their changes work. Don\\'t forget to use a bashed patch if necessary. For example:\r\n\r\nSkyrim.esm\r\n<------- \r\n<------- other esp files\r\n<------- \r\nItem Sorting with Weightless items.esp\r\nSoul Gems Differ.esp\r\n<------- \r\n<------- other esp files\r\n<------- \r\nBashed Patch.esp\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[b]Compatibility[/b]\r\n\r\nThis mod works fine with SkyUI, Categorized Favorites Menu and Crafting Mods.\r\n\r\nThis mod will not work with any other mods that modify the same items such as other sorting or weight mods. However you can put a mod that changes an item (such as soul gems) below in the load order and it should take that mods changes but you will lose the name sorting and the weight changes from that item. Otherwise I highly recommend you do a bash patch to get everything working smoothly.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[b]Known Issues[/b]\r\n\r\nHopefully there isn\\'t any, but if there are any mistakes or problems feel free to post and I\\'ll fix it as soon as I can. Suggestions also welcome.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[b]Credits[/b]\r\n\r\nWhile I made this from scratch I like to thank;\r\n\r\nHeadBomb for the first item sorting mod\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2730\r\n\r\nValdacil for his sorting mod\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4873\r\n\r\nAnd finally Wolferoo for his weightless mod\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1622\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[b]Permissions[/b]\r\n\r\nI don\\'t mind what you do to the ESP file as long as you give me credit and link back to this page if it still exists.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[b]Version History[/b]\r\n\r\n1.00 \r\nInitial Release",
