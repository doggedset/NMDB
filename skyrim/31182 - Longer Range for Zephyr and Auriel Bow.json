  "descriptionHtml": "====================\r\nLonger Range for Zephyr and Auriel\\'s Bow\r\nV 1.2\r\nBy Khrada\r\n====================\r\n\r\n====================\r\nDescription\r\n====================\r\nI have not realized how pathetic Zephyr is when it comes to range until recently. Its range is only on par with regular hunting bow because they have the same speed.\r\nAuriel\\'s Bow is even more pathetic, although it should be the bow that shoots arrow to the sun, it also has the same range as hunting bow.\r\nNow this is changed by setting the speed to appropriate values, and then attaching a script that gives out bonus speed when the bow is equipped.\r\nOne minor downside of the mod is Zephyr now shoots a little bit slower than vanilla speed, because 0.75 (speed for Dwarven bow) multiplied by 1.3 (30% faster) isn\\'t 1 (the vanilla value), I doubt anybody will be able to tell the difference, though.\r\n\r\nUpdate: This mod is now updated to reflect the latest [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23491/]UDGP\\'s[/url] change regarding Auriel\\'s Bow. Just place this mod under UDGP and you will be fine.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nFeature\r\n====================\r\n- Zephyr and Auriel\\'s Bow both have longer range now, while retaining their fast draw speed.\r\n- Zephyr\\'s range is now identical to Dwarven bow, and Auriel\\'s Bow to Daedric bow\r\n\r\n====================\r\nRequiremnt\r\n====================\r\nSkyrim, Make sure your game is up to date! (1.8.151.0.7 when the mod is created)\r\nDawnguard DLC\r\n\r\n====================\r\nHow to Install\r\n====================\r\nDrop both .bsa and .esp files in your data folder, enable them and you\\'re set!\r\n\r\n====================\r\nHow to Uninstall\r\n====================\r\nI would recommend you not to remove it, since the mod involves script and scripts are known to leave footprints and still trying to execute them after they\\'re removed.\r\nIf you really want to remove it, however, I would suggest you to sotre Zephyr and Auriel\\'s Bow away, disable the mod, and never use them again. But there will be no guarantee that your game will be okay afterwards.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCompatibility\r\n====================\r\nAnything that makes changes to Zephyr and Auriel\\'s Bow will conflict with this mod.\r\nUDGP, with its change being incorporated into the mod, being the sole exception to the issue.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nKnown Issue\r\n====================\r\nNone so far.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nPermission\r\n====================\r\nFeel free to look at the mod and alter any values as you see fit.\r\nLet me know before hand if you want to use it on anything else.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCredits & Thanks\r\n====================\r\nBethesda for creating this game, and the Creation Kit.\r\nNexus for hosting countless wonderful mods, which inspired me",
