  "descriptionHtml": "Howl of the Pack is a werewolf howl, that summons two werewolves to your aid. The Unofficial Skyrim patch, and the unofficial Skyrim legendary edition patch change it to one. I am not sure if this was intentional or not, but it&#39;s a change I personally disagree with. After all the description of the effect says &#34;brothers&#34; not brother. So I am fairly sure summoning two not one was intentional not a bug. This reverts the Howl to its original purpose, so it once again summons two pack members. \r<br />\r<br />Requires Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch",
