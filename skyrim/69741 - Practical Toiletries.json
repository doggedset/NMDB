  "summary": "Adds wooden buckets along with wash basins.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This file adds to the interior cells of every home or other such place of dwelling (longhouses, palaces, keeps) a wash basin accompanied by a wooden bucket. They are meant to be chamber pots/lavatories for the people of Skyrim. There may be multiple instances of them in each separate room of a home. They are purely aesthetic and don&#39;t have any other function that to perhaps add some realism. \r<br />\r<br />Only vanilla buildings are altered.\r<br />\r<br />Lastly. In addition to adding buckets and basins, there&#39;s also been something done to the inns of Skyrim. There will also be draped across the entrance to the rooms a banner of the Hold in which the inn is located. The Four Shields Tavern will have the red Solitude wolf banner over it. The Moorside in Morthal will have banners with the green swirly thing going on. The Braidwood Inn will have the blue bear banners. You get the idea&#33;\r<br />\r<br />In my experience, folks who&#39;ve played TES games always wonder how the citizenry &#34;does their business&#34;. Perhaps this can help answer that.\r<br />\r<br />Well...here you go.\r<br />\r<br />EDIT: I changed the name to what I originally wanted to call it but only remembered until just now.",
