  "descriptionHtml": "Improved Familiars\r\nAuthor: SubRosa_Florens\r\nVersion: 1.1\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nFamiliars are woefully underpowered in Skyrim. They have the stats of a starting wolf (i.e. 2nd level creature), but the magicka cost to summon them in twice that of a Flame Atronach (7th level creature). So I beefed up the stats to the Familiar to 6th level, and dramatically reduced the magicka cost. They are still an early level summons, but will at least not get 1-shot killed by other low-level creatures now. Nor will they chew up your magicka with little to show for it. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nSimply copy the Improved Familiars.esp file to your Skyrim\\\\data folder. When you start Skyrim, select the Improved Familiars mod. \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n1.0 -\r\nOriginal Release\r\n\r\n1.1 -\r\nFixed bug of Familiars being invulnerable in Skyrim version 1.6",
