  "descriptionHtml": "[size=+1][color=#D3D3D3]About[/size][/color]\r<br />A simple mod to hopefully help make the draugr a little less annoying and a little more frightening, while trying to not deviate from the lore. Currently, this is accomplished by making their &#34;aware&#34; sounds deeper, and by making their footsteps more quiet in order to make their approach harder to detect.\r<br />\r<br />[size=+1][color=#D3D3D3]Installation[/size][/color]\r<br />Simply install the archive using your favored mod manager utility.\r<br />\r<br />[size=+1][color=#D3D3D3]Uninstallation[/size][/color]\r<br />Simply uninstall the archive using your favored mod manager utility. Since these are just audio files, they won&#39;t break your game if you remove them.\r<br />\r<br />[size=+1][color=#D3D3D3]Compatibility[/size][/color]\r<br />Will be incompatible with other mods that change draugr sounds. Will not be game-breakingly incompatible with anything, as far as I know.\r<br />\r<br />[size=+1][color=#D3D3D3]Known Issues[/size][/color]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] The new aware sounds might sound stupid to your ears. They are likely also currently too deep relative to the other sounds.\r<br />[*] The footstep sounds might be too quiet if you are not using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43773/?]Audio Overhaul for Skyrim[/url]. I&#39;m not sure.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[size=+1][color=#D3D3D3]To Do[/size][/color]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Change all of the other draugr voice sounds.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[size=+1][color=#D3D3D3]Permissions[/size][/color]\r<br />Feel free, if you are someone with more motivation than myself, to take these files and add to them by changing the other draugr sounds.\r<br />\r<br />[size=+1][color=#D3D3D3]Credits[/size][/color]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Bethesda, for the excellent game, and for the original audio files, which I have simply tweaked in Audacity.\r<br />[*] Even though he does not ask it, the creator of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15034/?]Skyrim User Interface Silencer[/url] for his &#34;silent&#34; sound, which I am using as an optional for the &#34;alert&#34; growl noise.\r<br />[/list]",
