  "modName": "Hearthfire Basement mod",
  "summary": "A small basement addon with tons of storage and all the crafting stations in one place. Hearthfire and Dawnguard compatable.",
  "descriptionHtml": "-This was built using some Hearthfire addon Items.-\r\n -Works with Dawnguard but not required-\r\n \r\nThis first release is during a major change on the steamworkshop version. The mask busts in the main area are temporary and should NOT be used they will be deleted with the next update. Use the busts in the Trophy Room cell instead.\r\n\r\nSteamworkshop - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=104536873\r\n\r\nThe entrances to the basement are in each of the 5 starting homes, the 3 Hearthfire homes, the Ragged Flagon and one in the Arch-mage Quarters. I added a trap door on the floor in each area that require a key (Ragged Flagon you pick the lock) you get either when you buy the home or in the case of the Hearthfire homes when you get the first room built. \r\n\r\nA small basement style mod that has:  \r\n \r\nStorage -\r\n Mannequins - 48 (19 Female)\r\n Weapon Racks - 138\r\n Weapon Plaques - 24\r\n Shield Display - 68\r\n Large Weapon Display Case - 12\r\n Dagger Display Case - 30\r\n Chests - 14 / Satchels - 2 / Strong Box -2\r\n Safes - 15 \r\nBooks - 2200+ (enough)\r\n \r\nCrafting- All in one room \r\nAlchemy Table\r\n Enchanting Table\r\n Smelter\r\n Forge/Skyforge\r\n Tanning Rack\r\n Sharpening Wheel\r\n Armor Bench\r\n Cooking\r\n \r\nAll 13 Stones and 10 Shrines.\r\n \r\nBusts for all 10 masks(9 Dragon Priest masks and also the wooden mask)\r\n Claw Pedestals for Holding the 10 Dragon Claws.\r\n \r\nNot much for followers to do there but follow you at least they do that much.. stupid followers.\r\n \r\n10 exits-\r\n 5 to the player houses(Breeze, Honeyside, Hjerim, Vlindrel, Proudspire) key required \r\n3 to the Hearthfire homesteads(Lakeview Manor, Heljarchen Hall, Windstad Manor) key required\r\n Arch-Mage Quarters - key required\r\n Ragged Flagon - Master level lock that can be picked.\r\n \r\nThere are mods like this already but most are much larger than what I wanted in a house addon. Eventually I\\'ll put in more clutter and junk to fill the empty space but for now its ok I think. Also considering adding a merchant or maybe a follower(really doubt the follower).\r\n \r\nThis is my first shot at a mod so a few things might need to be tweaked but any suggestions or helpful info would be great. Oh yeah there\\'s also a bear.\r\n (Lite Version- http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=108316450)\r\n \r\n----To Do\\'s----\r\n Set up jewelry displays\r\n Training Room \r\n...\r\n ....\r\n Something with followers for followers... bleh\r\n \r\n---KNOWN BUGS---\r\n The 4 weapon racks at the back of the room hang some weapons upside down.(possible skyim bug)\r\n Mannequins do that cool duplicate item trick and wander some(skyrim bug not the mods fault)\r\n \r\n",
