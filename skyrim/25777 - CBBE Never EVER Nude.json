  "descriptionHtml": "This is a bra and underwear retexture that I\\'ve been using for my CBBE girls once I found out that Caliente\\'s nevernude option wasn\\'t really never nude.  I like my sexy armor replacers, but I don\\'t really like staring at my character\\'s naughty bits every time she swims nor do I want her walking around with her boobs hanging out.\r\n\r\nMy solution?\r\n\r\nPut simply, I just painted underwear on the model!\r\n\r\nI saw a few other mods here on the nexus that did something similar to mine, but there weren\\'t any simple ones of just a bra and panties.  So, I set out to make my own set that would A: Look good, and B: Be unobtrusive.  \r\nHere\\'s the result:\r\n[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v435/wendera_jade/TESV2012-10-2103-21-18-13.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThere are examples of how it looks like with armor on in the images tab!  Check them out.  I made triple extra sure that all the lines match up and the edges are as straight as possible!  Obviously there\\'s a little squiggle here and there, but I would have to alter the mesh itself to fix that and not only am I too lazy to do so, it wouldn\\'t be a user friendly retex if I did.\r\n\r\nAnyway, there are two different files I uploaded.  One is a ready made texture that you can simply put right into your skyrim directory and BAM!  Done.  I\\'m fairly sure that NMM will be able to handle it just fine!  This texture uses Navetsea\\'s skin texture which is [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6554]here[/url].  If you\\'re using a different texture, then this will make a neck seam.... Which is where the second file comes in to play!\r\n\r\nThe second file I uploaded is a PSD that you can use for whatever CBBE skin you want.  You\\'ll simply need to copy and paste that skin into the PSD.  The file is already properly named so simply save it as a DDS file and place it wherever it needs to be!  You can also change the bra color etc. if you want.  If you do something really cool, upload an image!  I wanna see!!!\r\n\r\nWARNING!!\r\nThe CBBE mesh itself has raised nipples!!  This retex does [b]not[/b] change that!\r\nAlso, in case it wasn\\'t obvious, this retex is for the CBBE mesh!",
