  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE:\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 is out now, the Vanilla file with no other changes apart from the no borders line.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nThis is an .ini file to replace the original Skyrim.ini file (seen as \\'Skyrim\\', you don\\'t see the \\'.ini\\' part).It goes in My Documents/My Games/Skyrim. It is tweaked to remove the borders that prevent you from leaving Skyrim. Have fun! :)  (if you go too far, you start falling through the ground, just use the console for this, type in \\'tcl\\' (without the \\') to enable no-clip mode.\r\n\r\nInstall note:\r\n\r\n(default)\r\n1. Go to My Documents\r\n2. Then to \\'My Games\\'\r\n3. Then to \\'Skyrim\\'.  In that folder there should be a file called \\'Skyrim\\'. (you can open it with notepad)\r\n4. Make a back-up to be safe, then replace it with the file from the .rar you just downloaded.\r\n5. DONE! :) Run the game, pick a direction and keep going. Remember that to keep going even after the ground isn\\'t solid anymore, use the console and the \\'tcl\\' command.\r\n\r\nLegal:\r\n\r\nI made this in literally 2 minutes, if that. Anyone can use it without any need of giving credit. :)\r\n\r\nDon\\'t forget to endorse ;)\r\n\r\nTo those who know how to tweak the .ini file, here\\'s the command:\r\n \\\"bBorderRegionsEnabled=1\\\"  You need to change the 1 to a 0, then add it last under the \\'General\\' part of the file.
