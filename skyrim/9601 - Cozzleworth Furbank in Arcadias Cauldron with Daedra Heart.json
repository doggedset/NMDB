  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guys!\r\nThis is my first mod for Skyrim, so i decided to make a NPC character for Arcadias Cauldron. I always though that shop was to lonely and bear. This will later be the start of a quest, but at the moment its just an NPC. I know that lots of you wont download this because its not super amazing or a quest, so I added a Daedric Heart into his inventory, as a little incentive to download it! Great fun if you can get it!",
