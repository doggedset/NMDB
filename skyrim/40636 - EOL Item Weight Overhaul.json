  "descriptionHtml": "For those who like added realism, this mod is for you.\r\n\r\nKey features;\r\n*All item weights modified to pounds (lbs) and changed to realistic levels\r\n*All race default carrying limits and starting stats modified to realistic levels\r\n*Weapon offence recalculated using mass and swing speed\r\n*Armour defence modified to reflect resilience of materials\r\n*Armour classification (light/heavy) changed where necessary\r\n*Weapon swing speeds modified to reflect new weights\r\n*Gold coins now have weight\r\n*Dawnguard weapons are now Silver\r\n*Circlets are now wearable with hoods\r\n*Cultist & Dunmer robes disenchanted\r\n*Most legendary items can be disenchanted\r\n*Pickaxes are now 2-handed\r\n*Item recipes adjusted to fit new item weights, materials and appearance\r\n\r\nMaterial conversions\r\n\r\nCorundum = Chromium\r\nDwarven = Brass\r\nEbony = Obsidian\r\nMoonstone = Aluminium\r\nOrichalcum = Bronze\r\nQuicksilver = Mercury\r\nDaedric = High Carbon Steel\r\nDragonbone = Ivory\r\nStahlrim = Diamond\r\n\r\nNB: You\\'ll need to start a new game for the stat changes to take effect, or try using the console commands to change race and back.\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP and my first mod, so any constructive feedback would be appreciated.\r\nI also have a Dragonborn mod to go with it contained within the same .rar file. I know it says Hearthfire but in fact that\\'s the Dragonborn mod. I\\'m still working on Hearthfire.\r\nBoth Mods are compatible with all official DLC. They will not, however, affect any items introduced using unofficial DLC. Please do not use this mod with others that affect item weights or it may crash the game.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\nRegards, EOL.",
