  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff0000]\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4][size=5]3/13/16: Future Update[size=4]-[/size][/size]\r<br />I just realized the first person textures are set wrong.... because I finally got into my game, low and behold, wrong colours popped up. So that will be corrected within the next two weeks should I have a spare moment. Also, additional earth tone colours will be added. Most likely a brown or creme, perhaps a lighter less saturated blue, and one other colour to be determined still. I&#39;d like to think I would be adding a different fur colour option, but depends on how I am feeling once I get into it. Plus, I am working on several mods at the moment I want to get out first. \r<br />________________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />Long story short: These were promised to be released some time ago, before the Ciri DLC outfit. Just now getting to them. Four bright colours to start with. I will not guarantee others, but if more follow they will be more toned down. I have yet to touch the Yennefer DLC outfit. Those will be earthtones once I get started.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is for 4 sets in bright colours for the Witcher 3 Yennefer Default, Originally imported for Skyrim by zzjay.\r<br />\r<br />These are standalone for UNP/Vanilla bodies. No weight slider support, which is how the original meshes were created.\r<br />I will not create weight sliders or body slides. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Craftable under leather, or use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64905]AddItemMenu[/url] Mod and item search under Vengerberg.\r<br />\r<br />Items are listed in crafting/inventory menus as Vengerberg. There are a few Yennefer outfit mods now for Skyrim. This is to avoid any confusion between the other mods and bypass any similar files names which could cause issues.\r<br />\r<br />They are listed as such:\r<br />\r<br />Vengerberg Black Fur \r<br />Vengerberg Brown Fur\r<br />Vengerberg Grey Fur\r<br />(these require leather and wolf pelts)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Vengerberg Blue Outfit, Gloves, Boots\r<br />Vengerberg Blue Stripes Outfit, Gloves, Boots\r<br />Vengerberg Grey Outfit, Gloves, Boots\r<br />Vengerberg Red Outfit, Gloves, Boots\r<br />(these items require only leather)\r<br />\r<br />Vengerberg Pendant\r<br />(requires leather and iron ingot)\r<br />\r<br />Craft under leather, upgradeable and enchantable.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#3c78d8][size=4]Installation:[/size][/color]\r<br />Install via NMM or MO. \r<br />Or if you prefer to manually install, then by all means...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#3c78d8][size=4]Requirements:[/size][/color]\r<br />None. But if you find the shoes hovering over the ground, or sinking below it, \r<br />you may want to use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36213]HDT HighHeels System[/url] to correct the offset. \r<br />That&#39;s not a guarantee that anyone will have this issue. Just a note of precaution in the event it happens. \r<br />HDT Heels fixes all&#33;[/center]\r<br />[center][color=#3c78d8][size=4]Credits:[/size][/color]\r<br />CD Projekt Red for their original meshes/textures/concepts. All original meshes/textures are intellectual\r<br />property of CD Projekt Red.\r<br />Zzjay for the original import from Witcher to Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#3c78d8][size=4]Permissions:[/size][/color]\r<br />If you want different sizes on the original textures from zzjay, you must contact her. I will not authorize these textures \r<br />for body types other than UNP base/Vanilla/CBBE base.\r<br />\r<br />This may not be uploade to other sites. It stays with Nexus only&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Contact zzjay if you wish to use assets from the Yennefer outfit in your own mods.[/center]",
