  "summary": "A stone&#39;s throw from Riften, a small shack previously occupied by an alchemist and her warrior husband with a magnificent viewing deck.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The second in my (hopefully) series of tiny homes, this one-room house offers basic amenities geared towards alchemists or a starting warrior. Renovated by a doting warrior husband for his alchemist wife, the previous occupants have met with an uncertain fate - some details may be found in the wife&#39;s journal located in the shack. Skyrim is a dangerous place, after all...\r<br />\r<br />One of the most striking features is the viewing deck which together with its elevated location makes for stunning vistas - spend time gazing out over the valley or at the stars and moons, or watch the sun rise over the mountains in the morning. Chairs provided, bring your own mead&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]knt3Cy7uNAw[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]\r<br />[list]\r<br />- alchemy station and cooking pot inside-  tanning rack, sharpening wheel, and chopping block outside- 2 chests and a weapons rack- growing beds for plants (inside and out)- close to Riften, yet in a secluded location- navmeshed (finalized this time&#33;) & item-safe- note the interior never resets, so if you harvest the plants they will be gone. If anyone knows a workaround that would be great. The exterior should reset on the default schedule (10 days/240 in-game hours) if you don&#39;t enter the cell within that time (which resets the timer)- made with and for 100% vanilla Skyrim, should play well with DLC and other mods- find it yourself using the mapmarker or the map screenshot, or if you&#39;re the impatient type coc tinyalchemisthut/tinyalchemisthutexterior[/list]\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />For the first in the series, see [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25631/]Tiny Tree Home[/url], aimed at nature lovers, wood elves, and people in need of a hideout (thieves, perhaps :P). For the latest, grab [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25886]Tiny Mage Tower[/url], for mages, book lovers,and people who enjoy convoluted buildings.\r<br />\r<br />Dev notes:\r<br />- wanted to build a treehouse, but inspiration struck and it turned out differently :)\r<br />- actually less tiny than I thought it would be\r<br />- still pretty small though\r<br />- the Bethesda-authored navmeshes surrounding the cell were actually pretty dicey\r<br />- did some minor landscaping because trees were in the way of the view\r<br />\r<br />I hope you like it.",
