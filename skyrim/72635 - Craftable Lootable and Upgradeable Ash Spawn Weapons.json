  "summary": "Ever wanted to have your own Ash Spawn weapons? Well, now you can&#33; With the magic of modding, you now don&#39;t have to use the console to have Ash Spawn weapons&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds 3 types of usable ash weapons:\r<br />-Ash Spawn War Axe\r<br />-Ash Spawn Battleaxe\r<br />-Ash Spawn Sword (unused)\r<br />You can craft any of them with your spare heartstones, and upgrade them with the same. They come enchanted, as they were in their unaltered form. The sword is new, and does a little more damage than the war axe. It&#39;s unenchanted, but if you want an unenchanted version of the axe/battleaxe there are mods available for that.",
