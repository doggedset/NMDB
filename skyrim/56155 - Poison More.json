  "summary": "This mod allows the poison to last as many hits as the number of poisons you consumed. If you consume 3 poisons, the poison will last for 3 hits for instance. It takes into account Concentrated Poison like perks, such as the ones added by Poison Skills Enhanced. So if the perk allows the poison to last 5 hits instead of one, if you consume 2 poison",

If you consume 3 poisons, the poison will last for 3 hits, if you consume 4 poisons, the poison will last for 4 hits, etc .\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#4F6128][b][size=4]How to use[/size][/b][/color][/center]\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*]Just click on the poison you want to use as you would normally do.\r<br />[*]Select how many and voilà&#33; A notification at the top left corner will show up saying how many poisons were consumed and how many hits the poison will last for. \r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />Do note that it&#39;s important that you don&#39;t hover your mouse over other potions/poisons during the process. Don&#39;t click on a poison, and before answering the &#34;how many&#34; question, hover the mouse over another poison/potion and then press ENTER. \r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#4F6128][size=4][b]Demonstration[/b][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />[center][youtube]OpdA2bDPhJk[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#4F6128][size=4][b]Installation[/b][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />You can either:\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*]Use Nexus Mod Manager, for quick and easy install OR\r<br />[*]Download it manually, in which case you&#39;d need to unzip first, then put the .esp inside skyrim&#39;s data folder, the .pex inside the data/scripts folder, and the .psc under data/scripts/source.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[center][color=#4F6128][size=4][b]Uninstallation[/b][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />The steps below applies not only for my mod, but any script based mod. Believe me, deactivating a script based mod is not the only thing you need to do.\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*]Deactivate my mod and save your game.\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53045/?]download this tool[/url].\r<br />[*]Open PDTWrapper.exe.\r<br />[*]Click on &#34;Select ESS&#34; and load your save. Don&#39;t worry, the tool creates a new save instead of overwriting your original one in case something bad happens.\r<br />[*]Click on &#34;Load Papyrus Section&#34;. This may take a while.\r<br />[*]Go to &#34;Script Data&#34; and filter for &#34;PoisonMore&#34;.\r<br />[*]Right click on what you found. It should show a filter called &#34;PoisonMorePlayerScript ( [script_name] )&#34;\r<br />[*]Click on &#34;Remove Instances&#34;, &#34;Remove Script References&#34;, &#34;Remove Unattached Instances&#34;.\r<br />All of the steps after the first one are necessary because even after deactivating a script based mod, your save games retain information about it and that can cause problems. The extra steps make your save clean again.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#4F6128][b][size=4]New features/improvements[/size][/b][/color][/center]\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*]The user does not  have to assign a mod key anymore. Instead, he just needs to click on the poison as he would do normally.\r<br />[*]The user does not have to configure the WAIT variable anymore, since the script can now handle the poison confirmation messages automatically.\r<br />[*]The mod doesn&#39;t require skyUI anymore, as there is nothing for the end user to configure.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />To see bug fixes, please check the change log\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=4][b][color=#4F6128]Compatibility[/color][/b][/size][/center]\r<br />The only incompatibility that I can find is to use a mod that removes the poisoning confirmation message. This mod should be compatible with and take into account any mod that changes the Concentrated Poison perk or adds many levels to it, such as Poison Skills Enhanced (e.g. if you have a perk that allows the poison to last 5 hits instead of one, if you consume 2 poisons it will last for 10 hits).\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#4F6128][b][size=4]Currently known issues[/size][/b][/color][/center]\r<br />Below is listed a few issues that I know of but could not fix yet, due to the intrinsic way the mod works and game engine things out of my control. I tested the mod thoroughly for bugs, and only even released the first version after I thought there were no more of them. While working on the second version however, I&#39;ve found more, so if you find any issue not listed here or the change log, please report them to me. My intention is to make this mod as flawless as possible.\r<br />\r<br />[list=1][*]If the user tries to poison an already poisoned weapon, the &#34;how many&#34; message box still shows up.\r<br />[*]After using the mod the user might not be able to scroll on the potions tab any more. The workaround is to simply click on the potions tab again.\r<br />[*]After clicking on a poison the &#34;How Many&#34; box doesn&#39;t gain focus and the user has to click twice on the box to be able to use the slider with the mouse(with the MOUSE, if the user wants to use with the arrow keys and press ENTER there is no problem). \r<br />[/list]\r<br />[center][size=4][b][color=#4F6128]FAQ[/color][/b][/size][/center]\r<br />Q- I see a message box quickly appearing and disappearing,what&#39;s that?\r<br />A- It&#39;s the poison confirmation message. Since you are already asked how many poisons you want to consume, I figured it would be best to automatically say &#34;yes&#34; after that. You don&#39;t need 2 confirmation messages. If you have only one poison, it also automatically says &#34;yes&#34; to the confirmation message.\r<br />\r<br />Q- The mod simply stopped working for me. I click on the poison, nothing/weird things happened. What&#39;s going on?\r<br />A- I don&#39;t know. Somehow my mod can become corrupted, something external to it can interfere with its variables and functionality. For now, follow the uninstallation steps and reactivate my mod afterwards.\r<br />\r<br />Q- What is this weird potion named &#34;»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»&#34;?\r<br />A- The weird potion named &#34;»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»&#34; is a dummy potion used to fix two glitches, that you can read about in the change log.\r<br />\r<br />Q- What if I consume the dummy potion by accident?\r<br />A- That&#39;s very unlikely, since it will always be the last potion in the tab, but you can simply close and open your inventory again, that the potion will come back.\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=4][b][color=#FF0000]Requirements[/color][/b][/size][/center]\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*]Latest skyrim patch\r<br />[*]Latest [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]skse[/url]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=4][b][color=#4F6128]Thanks[/color][/b][/size][/center]\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*]Skse folks, who made my life much easier\r<br />[*]Chocklymon for the Profile Manager, I used it to make sure I wouldn&#39;t mess up with my original save while testing my mod.\r<br />[*]Laufknoten2 for his Nord level 11 savegame, I also used his savegame because I didn&#39;t want to touch or see my original save lol(I know I just needed the profile manager but for some reason it gave me more comfort :p).\r<br />[*]flexcreator, for his awesome [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53045/?] savegame cleaner tool[/url].\r<br />[*]Everyone who supports this mod via constructive comments and endorsements&#33; It shows me that my work is appreciated and encourages me to make it better&#33;\r<br />[/list]",

If the user used a poison(by clicking on it for example), hovered the mouse over another poison, then the poison which has the mouse hovered on would be used to poison the weapon instead.\r<br />The user&#39;s weapon would also have the number of poisons hits from the first selected poison.\r<br />\r<br />4.
