  "descriptionHtml": "IF YOU LIKE THIS MOD ENOUGH, PLEASE ENDORSE IT OR LEAVE A COMMENT. IT HELPS ME KNOW I\\'M ON THE RIGHT PATH OF MOD MAKING.\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN VERSION - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12407 - by Gluzdir\r\n\r\nA home built into an island in the sky. \r\n\r\nTo get to the castle you must purchase \\\"Spell Tome: House in the Sky\\\" by one of the mage vendors. Farengar in Whiterun is one of them. It costs approximately 15,000 Septims to purchase. If you don\\'t want to spend that much you can always open up the console and type in the item code for gold. I won\\'t give you the code here as it is easy to look up and some who have resisted looking it up to maintain realism in the game may not appreciate it.\r\n\r\nOn the exterior it includes:\r\n-Natural garden area on one of the islands\r\n-Home on the large island\r\n-Landing pad (for future mods that someone may make that involve one flying creature or another          that the player is allowed to mount)\r\n\r\nThe interior includes:\r\n-Bedroom\r\n-Bookshelves\r\n-Weapons racks\r\n-Weapons/Shield racks\r\n-Mannequins\r\n-Smithing section\r\n-Alchemy/Enchanting tables\r\n-Cooking pot\r\n\r\n-----1.0a-----\r\nFixed the teleport spell, hopefully. added a script folder to the rar so that when you add it to the data folder, it should be placed in there.\r\n\r\n------AUTHOR\\'S NOTE-------\r\nThis mod will probably not be navmeshed considering the spell only teleports only the player to the island. First thing I would like to work on is figuring out how to make the entire island move around the map so that it always has a good view. Also after that task maybe make it so that the island can be transported to certain locations depending on which climate you like most.\r\n\r\nAlso I would like to give a special thanks to DarkenDe for allowing me to use the spell script he created that allowed me to make the teleport spell to the island.\r\n\r\n",
