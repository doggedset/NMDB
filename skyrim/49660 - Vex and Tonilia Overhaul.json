  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb281/Syn_gaia/Skyrim/VexandTon_zps5bb9b04b.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[color=royalblue][size=7][U][B]Vex and Tonilia Overhaul[/B][/U][/SIZE][/Color]\r<br />\r<br />Have you ever looked at NPCs and thought that their appearance just didn&#39;t fit? I&#39;m sure we all have. So I started a new game, joined the Thieve&#39;s Guild and realized that I just didn&#39;t like the looks of Vex or Tonilia much. I searched Nexus for a mod that changed that, but didn&#39;t come across one I favored. I wanted to fix that and this is what I came up with.\r<br />\r<br />[color=royalblue][size=5][B]Vex[/B][/SIZE][/Color]\r<br />\r<br />Spicy, sassy, and sometimes mean, Vex needed an appearance that suited her personality. She is also stealthy and a master at blending in with the shadows. This is suited to my personal likings  and I hope you guys will like her too.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb281/Syn_gaia/Skyrim/Vex_zps0a27912d.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[color=royalblue][size=5][B]Tonilia[/B][/SIZE][/Color]\r<br />\r<br />Pretty much that same as Vex, except she is a fence. She will sell and buy stolen goods, is tough, and has an attitude to match.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb281/Syn_gaia/Skyrim/ca98114c-47d3-40ae-b0d2-12d1e3e62e27_zps2ca74820.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=royalblue][size=6][B][U]About their looks[/U][/B][/SIZE][/Color]\r<br />\r<br />The changes made to them are few, yet drastic. Their eyes, lips, and facial structure have been altered. Their hair is standalone (Apachii), but I didn&#39;t make any changes to their skin textures, makeup, body, ect. Why? Because everyone has their own preferences for those types of things. Some like CBBE, Better Females, ect. \r<br />\r<br />I use the mods Coverwomen, UNP and Long Eyelashes. \r<br />\r<br />Now added pictures of what they will look like for those who use SG Skin Texture Renewal as their skin textures&#33;\r<br />\r<br />If requests come in for a complete standalone version that makes such changes to them, I may consider uploading those versions. (For example I would make standalone versions of them that use UNP body and coverwomen instead of your default mods.)\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]No other mods are needed for this.[/Color]\r<br />\r<br />Recommended Mods but not Required:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?]Apachii Sky Hair[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3563/?]Coverwomen[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?]Eyes of Beauty[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35267/?]SG Female Texture Renewal[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27783/?]Long Eye Lashes[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?]UNP Dimonized Body[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[B][U]Credits:[/U][/B]\r<br />\r<br />Apachii Hair: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?\r<br />Coverwomen: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3563/?\r<br />UNP Body (Adult Content): http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?\r<br />Long Eyelashes: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27783/?\r<br />[/center]",
