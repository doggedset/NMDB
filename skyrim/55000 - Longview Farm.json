  "summary": "Longview is a seperate worldspace with an island that is a farm, perfect for alchemists or just anyone who wants a nice farm&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Longview[/b] is a seperate worldspace accessed by a tablet located at the solitude docks (Check images for a picture of its exact location). This worldspace is simply an island with a decent sized farm on it. It has plenty of cabbages and potatoes for anyone who needs them, plus a few other plants at the gardens. One thing I will warn you about is, the house isn&#39;t too special, its just a simple farmhouse. I did my best to give you plenty of storage around the house. Below I will give a full list of features&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Also, if you guys have any suggestions or bug reports, pm me and i promise a response within hours.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#FF0000]I am currently making a new version of this mod where you actually build the farm, please stay tuned, the first release is expected in only a day or two.[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#FFFF00]Features[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />-Seperate Worldspace\r<br />\r<br />-Fireplace and certain lights can be turned off/on via lever.\r<br />\r<br />-Teleport Spell (Can be found either at the solitude docks on the crate next to tablet, or inside the house on the bed)\r<br />\r<br />-Decent sized farm, over 200 potato plants&#33; Potato&#39;s&#33; :D\r<br />\r<br />-Has a pool, so, uh, enjoy?\r<br />\r<br />-4 Small Gardens each with different plants/flowers\r<br />\r<br />-Livestock pen with a couple cows, and 5 or 6 chickens for meat.\r<br />\r<br />-You also have 2 farmers that work for you, the male one can sell you some products, and if you dont like them walking around I did NOT set them too essential so you can kill them.\r<br />\r<br />-There is also a hidden easter egg (Not finished yet&#33;, I will finish it if this mod gets more than 50 downloads)\r<br />\r<br />-Beautiful Landscaping\r<br />\r<br />-Fully Navmeshed exterior and interior\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#00FFFF]===Notes===[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />-To access the Island, go to the Solitude docks, and look for the small rowboat and you will see a log with a tablet on it. Click on the tablet, but first I recommend picking up the teleport spell book on the crate next to the log.\r<br />\r<br />-The wheat field is oddly nav-meshed.\r<br />\r<br />-The house is not suppose to be super awesomely high tech, its a farmhouse....\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#5FFB17]===Compatibility===[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />I can&#39;t see any problems with this since its a separate worldspace. The only thing I can see having a problem is if something changes the solitude docks. If anyone finds another mod that does, PLEASE pm me&#33; I will fix it asap.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#FF0000]===Requirements===[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Nothing is needed except Skyrim.esm, Update.esm, and the latest patch.\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re using the Hearthfire edition, its the same as above plus the hearthfire DLC",
