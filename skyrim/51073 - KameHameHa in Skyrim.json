  "summary": "KameHameHa in Skyrim&#33; This insane spell does not replace anything else and has its own custom sound effects. The book for the spell is found on the floor in the first room of Dragonsreach.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Just as Master Roshi once taught Goku this amazing ability, so too can you learn it from Roshi&#39;s journal. The book is found on the floor in the first room of dragonsreach and is worth 10,000 gold (but don&#39;t sell it, you only get it once). The spell is very OP (250 damage base), but it takes 10.1 seconds to charge up. While charging up the spell, a sound of Goku doing the same is played, and continues when you&#39;re casting the spell. It relies on the novice destruction perk and costs 10 magicka per second to cast. Just simply download the mod and add it to the mod manager and you&#39;re golden&#33; I suggest putting it low in your load order so that the books placement in dragonsreach doesn&#39;t conflict with other things.",
