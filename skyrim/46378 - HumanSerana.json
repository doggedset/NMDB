  "summary": "Gets rid of that annoying lingering vampire traits that hang around after Serana is cured. Including: complaints about sunlight, hooded while the sun is out, vampire drain spell, and the hideous half human half vamp eyes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Times New Roman][size=4]For anyone out there who actually decided not to become an all powerful vampire lord, [i]and[/i] decided that you like Serana as a follower [i]and[/i] never offended Serana during the main quest [i]and[/i] decided to get her cured, this mod is for you!\r\nFor anyone else who now realizes that their life can never be complete without a human Serana at their virtual side [color=#0066cc](especially now that you can use this mod to shake to last of the vamp out of her!)[/color] you can use this magical console command to bend her to your will![/size]\r\n\r\n[color=#99ff00][size=5]setstage DLC1SeranaCureSelfQuest 10[/size][/color]\r\n[size=3]This console command is not necessary for the mod to work.  It only forces Serana to go cure herself.  A day or two(game time) after using this command Serana will be at fort dawnguard and will be cured.  Do not use this console command until you have completed the main questline of the dawnguard dlc[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3]ok, so maybe I should tell you what this mod actually does.  After Serana is cured of vampirism she is no longer weakened by sunlight and all that great stuff, but she has a lot of vampire behavior that gets very[/size] [size=3][b]annoying[/b][/size][size=4], very[/size][size=6][b][color=#ff3300] quickly[/color][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4]So I made this mod fix all that crap. This mod also gives Serana a few other spells and perks to work with along with a boost in magicka so that Serana will be an actually pretty good mage follower.  Plus it's only fair since I'm taking away her drain spell.[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][size=6]WARNING[/size]\r\n[size=4]Once you has activated this mod Serana will gain all the attributes listed whether she has been officially cured or not so do not activate this mod until you have cured Serena unless you want to completely mess up the story.  If you do activate this mod before Serana is cured it isn't a big deal. You can deactivate the mod at any time and Serana will return to being a vampire.[/size][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3]This mod will:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]keep Serana from putting her royal vampire armor hood up when the sun's out\r\n[*]remove vampire drain from Serana's spell list and add conjure flame atronarch and chain lightning\r\n[*]adds twin souls perk and adept destruction perk\r\n[*]gives her an 80 point magicka boost\r\n[*]get rid of Serana's random dialogues complaining about the sun.  That's right, you are reading this text correctly.  I got her to finally [/size][size=4][b]freaking [/size][size=6][color=#cc0000]SHUT UP[/color][/size][/b]\r\n[size=3][*]and lastly this mod will get rid of the [color=#cccc33]gross yellow human eyes[/color] glitch and replaces them with much nicer green eyes.[/size]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][center]COMPATIBILITY[/center][/size]\r\n[size=3]Obviously this mod will clash with any other mods that use Serana or her HoodedOutfit Object.  It shouldn't crash anything, but Serana's appearance and dialogue could be different depending on the load order of the plugins.  Other than that this mod has no compatibility issues with anything.  No scripts, no worries.[/size][/font]",
