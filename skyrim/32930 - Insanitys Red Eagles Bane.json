Like many other unique weapons in Skyrim, these don\\'t come with a unique visual appearance, well until now that is. What this replacer does is gives the two swords a unique appearance, they both have a more fitting look for the legend behind them. The swords share the same design but have a few small differences.\r\n\r\nThis is purely a replacer and does not touch the weapons stats or enchantments.\r\n\r\nThe models and textures are completely new, the textures are also high resolution (2048x2048).\r\n\r\n=================\r\nInstallation\r\n=================\r\n\r\n1. Extract the contents of the ZIP folder into your Data folder\r\n2. Make sure the Insanity\\'s Red Eagle\\'s Bane.esp is checked in the Launcher\r\n\r\n=================\r\nUn-Installation:\r\n=================\r\n\r\n1. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod\r\n2.
