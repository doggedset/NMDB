  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/0Hh1nLC.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />&#34;War has always been the grand sagacity of every spirit\r<br />\r<br />which has grown too inward and too profound;\r<br />\r<br />its curative power lies even in the wounds one receives.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />-Nietzsche\r<br />\r<br />Your character can now receive visual wounds on their body. These wounds are weapon specific, so if you&#39;re sliced with a dagger, expect many minor cuts. If you&#39;re hacked with an axe, you can expect your character to sport rather large gashes.\r<br />\r<br />The armor you are wearing is also a factor. If you&#39;re wearing heavy armor and get hit with a warhammer, you can certainly expect a few bruises and broken ribs.",
