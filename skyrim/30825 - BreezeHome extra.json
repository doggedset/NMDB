  "descriptionHtml": "This is my very first mod. I added a door in side BreezeHome that takes you to a place that has everything u need in it. It has a smiting room, Alchemy room/Enchanting room, Kitchen, Bed Weapon racks and lots of chests. Im pretty proud of my first mod. Im still updating it so i will try to keep up with it. The is on glitch there is a weapon rack floating next to the rest of the racks and u cant use it but besides that everything works. The two spells r amazing. The teleport spell takes you to the secret room when ever you want from where ever you want and the Ultra spell Does 2 kinds of fire damage, frost, shock and for fun paralyze. it will kill anything with one j=hit for the most part. it all depends. Both spells r located in the Room next to the big chest buy the bed on the table. Let me no how i did and if theirs glitches i can fix and anything u want added.",
