  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#f1c232][b]Q. What does &#34;Guards Use Vanilla Open Helms&#34; actually do?[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Guards now use open-faced helmets present in the original game. Most guards use hide helmets. Guards from Hjaalmarch use Imperial helmets. Guards from The Reach use scaled helmets. Guards from The Rift use leather helmets. Stormcloaks still use the original Stormcloak helmets.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232][b]Q. Is this mod compatible with other guard-based mods?[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />The mod should be compatible with almost any guard-based mod. I specifically only modified the helmet objects and not the guards themselves so that this would be the case. Simply load this mod after the other guard-based mods that you use.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232][b]Q. Where does this mod need to be in my load order?[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />The mod only changes the guard helmet objects, so pretty much anywhere in your load order is fine unless you have other mods that change the guard helmets, in which case this mod should be loaded later in the load order.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232][b]Q. Can I suggest improving the mod by doing x, y, or z?[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />I would be interested in any suggestions. Please contact me via nexusmods.com, or e-mail me using the address firstname@lastname.me.uk (using my first and last names).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232][b]Q. Can I report a bug?[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />The mod is very simple and should be completely bug free. If you do experience problems then please contact me via nexusmods.com, or e-mail me using the address firstname@lastname.me.uk (using my first and last names).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f1c232][b]Q. Do you have any other mods?[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />I have a mod called &#34;PRUFEI&#34; ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54375/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54375/[/url]) which prevents smelting of equipped and favorite items in compatible mods. One of these compatible mods is &#34;Elementary Smelting&#34; ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54378/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54378/[/url]) which enables smelting of practically any craftable metal item in Skyrim, Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn. Additional files for Elementary Smelting also permit the breakdown of dragonscale-based armors and leather armors.\r<br />\r<br />I also have a mod called &#34;An Anvil Is Not Enough&#34; ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54536/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54536/[/url]). The mod is a very simple immersion/realism fix. There are two main changes. Firstly, the game is altered such crafting items requires a full forge (an anvil by itself is not sufficient). Secondly, the use of smithing apparatus now requires the necessary tools (hammer, tongs and shovel).",
