  "modName": "Enchantable and Upgradeable Unarmed Strikes",
  "summary": "This mod adds several new options for unarmed enthusiasts.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This adds several tiers of enchantable and upgradable unarmed weapons to the game. \r\n\r\nHand Wrap Tiers:\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\r\nLeather\r\nIron\r\nSteel\r\nOrcish\r\nElven\r\nDwarven\r\nEbony\r\nDaedric\r\nDragon\r\n\r\nA leather handwrap and an ingot of the desired material is required to craft these. You can buy the basic leather handwraps from Belathor in Whiterun, or craft them yourself.\r\n\r\nClaw Razor (Khajit only) Tiers:\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\r\nIron\r\nSteel\r\nOrcish\r\nElven\r\nDwarven\r\nEbony\r\nDaedric\r\nDragon\r\n\r\nA bottle of Elswyer Epoxy and an ingot of the desired material is required to craft the claws. Elswyer Epoxy can be purchased from Belathor in Whiterun or crafted at a cooking pot using Horse Hide (glue was once made from horse hooves) and Bonemeal (it reacts with the glue and makes it stronger).\r\n\r\nBUG NOTES:\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\r\nIt should be noted that due to the way that Skyrim handles unarmed weapons, these can not be poisoned. They have no models. I\\'ve attempted everything I can think of to give them a model, but it ends up creating all sorts of silly floating gloves that don\\'t move when viewing your character in 3rd person, and they don\\'t show up in 1st person, so there\\'s no point. They will also disappear when dropped from your inventory.",
