The design as some may recognise is from the genius McFarlane, creator of Spawn. This Shield is based off that used by \\'Bluetooth\\' the Viking from the Spawn Dark Ages Series.\r\nIt can be crafted at any crafting forge and requires the steel smithing perk. \r\nThe stats make it roughly on par with the Glass Shield. It is in the light armour class with slightly more protection at the cost of slightly more weight.\r\n\r\nStats:\r\nBase Armour Rating: 30\r\nWeight: 8\r\n\r\nAlso find my viking spawn axe here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14066",
