  "descriptionHtml": "I looked around for houses with adoption ability and the most are super, big fancy houses for the badass dragonborn and they all are amazing, but I&#39;m cottage kind of person. So now I will start making small family houses near towns with factions or main storylines and Riften really needed one.\r<br />\r<br />Thieves may dislike the fact they need to be thanes to get honeyside. Or some may want something near Riften and live simple. So I made a small house for a family of four near snow-shod farm across the river from Riften main gate. There is nothing or anything that will let you show off your things in this house. It can be cramped sometimes and not the prettiest house, but I hope you found it cozy enough for you. \r<br />\r<br />This my first house mod so please if you found a bug or have any advice of any kind don&#39;t be shy and comment about it&#33;[size=4]\r<br />\r<br />It has:[/size]\r<br />Master bedroom downstairs.\r<br />All crafting stations: enchanting in the master bedroom, alchemy as soon as you enter, and blacksmithing back of the house outside with a wood chopping block and a cook pot outside and inside. \r<br />An armorstand that can store armors with a chest next to it for weapons in the master bedroom.\r<br />A room for two kids. I tested it and the kids go to sleep.\r<br />A bookself&#33; A container with a bookset as a model not that one with scripts.\r<br />Tweaked lighting to fine with RLO.\r<br />A map marker named fisherman cottage.\r<br />The biggest wall mounted slaughterfish.  \r<br />A trash barrel named trash near the stairs.  \r<br />\r<br />[size=4]The new DLC version will replace the kids to a room for one follower.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]If you disliked getting the house for free:\r<br />[/size]Many players hate getting a free thing and that is understandable, so if you liked the house just go to the many respawning barrels of Riften and throw your gold there. I will not add a key or scripts soon.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]This House need hearthfire[/size]&#33; No hearthfire= CTD when loading a save&#33; To move your family you need [b]Hearthfire multiple adoptions by [/b]TMPhoenix[b] http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249/?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Mods used:\r<br />[size=2]Tamriel Reloaded - Textures and Parallax.\r<br />[/size]Static mesh improvement. \r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />DBM Resources for the chest.\r<br />Insanity For the armorstand and windowboxs.\r<br />Blary for the bookset\r<br />Lilth for her things.\r<br />Bestheda for Skyrim.\r<br />Stroti for the pot oven for oblivion and Tamira for bringing them to Skyrim.",
