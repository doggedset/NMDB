  "descriptionHtml": "Here is my first follower mod&#33; :) \r<br />\r<br />Alexander is a follower based on the Roman style of combat: A true legionnaire, he fights with a Gladius and a tower shield.\r<br />\r<br />This follower is found inside the inn at Dragonbridge. Let me know if you find any problems&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Next Update: I will be adding a quest and experiment with adding a custom voice, I&#39;ll hopefully have the voice recordings finished by this weekend.\r<br />\r<br />Future Plans: \r<br />As this is my first companion mod, he is somewhat simple (being made by the CK to run with vanilla Skyrim). I will be updating him and adding more sophisticated material in the future. I also plan to add a custom voice at some point.\r<br />\r<br />I have another companion on the way. This time it will be a female standalone follower with a custom voice&#33;",
