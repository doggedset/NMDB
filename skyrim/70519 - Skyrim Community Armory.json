Of curse I get permission from the authors before adding the mods and I just have to say thank you to those who have let me use their mods. There are many new weapons and amours added to the game and they are (should) all be added to the level lists. This was done by using the program lootifiaction, without this program non of this would of been possible. After that I check each mod for errors in TES5Edit and then use the merge plugin to merge them all together. Then I just put all the files together and there you go&#33; \r<br />\r<br />I hope to be adding way more mods to this collection and maybe even add more stuff the just weapons and amours, but for now its a great start. The goal of this project is to really combine less popular and smaller mods together, so that way not every has to go through the process of adding 100+ items to the game. \r<br />\r<br />If you would like to submit a mod you have created, just leave a comment or pm me with a link to the mod with permission to add the mod. Then I will add it and add you to the credits list&#33; The only catch is that you must be the original mod creator of the mod&#33; That way no rules are broken and no one has their feelings hurt.\r<br />\r<br />Last but not least, I don&#39;t know how much I will be updating this, maybe once every couple days or most likely once a week&#33; So please submit your mods so I can keep adding new great items to skyrim that was made by you guys&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]What does this project do:\r<br />[/b][/size][size=2]This project currently is focus on combining community made Skyrim weapon and amour mods in to one easy download&#33; All (I hope all) items have been added to level list and can be found in the world of Skyrim&#33; There&#39;s many new items added and all of which are lore friendly and not over powered&#33; Maybe (most likely) in the future I will add a separate download for those items not so lore friendly for that one not lore friendly play through. Other then every thing I just said, its simple, lots new weapons and amour, added to level list, and easy download&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I plan on adding a whole lot more mods to this project and I cant wait to see what it will turn in to&#33; Thanks for having a look and may you all enjoy the many new items the Skyrim Modding Community has made for us all&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]What&#39;s Added:[/size][/b]\r<br />First off, this mod adds a lot of new weapons and items and I will do my best to explain how many there are&#33; First off there are 151 (hope I added up right) base weapons and amour pieces, plus a full amour set, added to the game. These are the he base models for these items and next we have a couple of variants of a couple of these bases which is around 18 (may be more), so make the base bigger, small, town handed, and even shorter. So these items are all independent from each other, meaning you will find these all I the world by them selves. Next and for now last, you have enchanted variants of all the weapon and amours, which can well, be anything. You could find any of the items with a random enchant on it&#33; This in its self is another new item, just setting in the level list waiting to be found. So how many enchanted versions are there? Well all of the new weapons and items have all, or close, to the enchants you could put on it. So there&#39;s a lot of enchants and well there is a possibility you could find any of these weapons or amours with anyone on it.\r<br />\r<br />So overall around 170 new weapon and amour pieces added and each one has a random percent chance of getting a random enchant from 100+ combinations and such.  \r<br />\r<br />I know a random enchant may not sound like much, but it use to be a really huge hassle to make them even appear in the level list and with lootifiaction its now possible&#33; So please trust me its a big and cool deal&#33; \r<br />\r<br />P.S. The number of weapons and amour pieces will be updated as the mod is updated, but it may not be right away, just give it some time.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Suggested Application if you want to add a mod to this project:[/b] [/size]\r<br />Mod Name:\r<br />Link:\r<br />Are you the original Author:\r<br />Do you give permission for this mod to be added:\r<br />Would you like other weapon and amour mods you make to be adding in the future:\r<br />Is it ok if I use one or two pictures from the mod page on this page:\r<br />\r<br />P.S. Pictures will be added soon and please feel free to submit some too&#33;[/size]",
