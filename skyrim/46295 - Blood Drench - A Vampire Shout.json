  "summary": "A small mod which uses the visuals Vile Vapors shout used by the Afflicted in a new shout used by vampires.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Credit goes to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/7714041]RognvaldTheWise[/url] for the request/idea.\r<br />\r<br />NEEDED: The color effects for these are still green. Until they&#39;re red like they&#39;re supposed to be, this will still be marked as beta.\r<br />\r<br />A shout so strong, your throat rips open and you spew blood. So, RognvaldTheWise had the idea to give vampires a new power. The power would be such that when you used it, it cost health and stamina to spew blood on your opponents. In exchange, anyone hit with the blood would run in fear (or disgust) for awhile. Powers didn&#39;t work out, so it&#39;s a shout (and that actually kind of makes sense). It doesn&#39;t have a recharge time. It will, however, be unavailable if your timer is already running just like with every other shout.\r<br />\r<br />This may or may be a bit overpowered as it works up to level 60 for 60 seconds.\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll get the shout very shortly after becoming a vampire, and you&#39;ll lose it if you&#39;re cured.",
