  "descriptionHtml": "While I was putting together the lists for enchanted Light Bonemold, I discovered that Bonemold Armor has enchanted versions, only enchanted bonemold shields were actually in levelled lists. Also, there may have been a light version planned, as there is a cuirass that fortifies Light Armor, despite Bonemold being Heavy Armor. \r\n\r\nLong story short, this mod integrates enchanted Bonemold Armor into the game, so you can find that cuirass and other cool, already-enchanted pieces of my favorite armor set! \r\n\r\nThis mod probably already exists!\r\n",
