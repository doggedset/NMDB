I have combined the vast houses of Morninghood Manor, the outdoor detail of Gleaming Falls and Glorious Ravine the plucked expert skills from learning over time. \r<br />\r<br />I do hope you enjoy this mod and i wish you a great adventure. \r<br />\r<br />---RECOMENDED MODS----\r<br />\r<br />-Climates of Tamriel V3: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17802/?\r<br />-AmidianBorn Landscape textures: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37865/?\r<br />\r<br />---Optional Files--\r<br />RealVision ENB with Sub surface and Depth of field enabled. &lt;--- for people wondering about my screenshots. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />List of features:\r<br />\r<br />-Hand crafted landscape from scratch with great attention to detail and optimisation.
