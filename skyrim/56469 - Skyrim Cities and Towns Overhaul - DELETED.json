I will be doing each city/town individually with (V0.1) being the first release for each of them and then (v0.2), (V0.3) and so on as they get updated until they reach (V1.0) which I will then consider as the finished product and then obviously after (V1.0) any bugs/fixes or lil things I want to add will just be lil updates. Once all the cities/towns have been released as (V0.1) then this main mod page latest version will change to (V1.0) to show that they are all released however all the cities/towns will keep their individual version next to them in the description. So basically this is not a finished product and is a work in progress and hope to all of you who download enjoy my work and if possible leave me some feedback or suggestions for later updates.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: Screenshots are not from this mod as it is a work in progress but don&#39;t be afraid to try it out and help the development of this mod.\r<br />\r<br />- CITIES -\r<br />\r<br />- Markarth - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- Riften - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- Solitude - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- Whiterun - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- Windhelm - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- Dawnstar - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- Falkreath - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- Morthal - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- Winterhold - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- TOWNS -\r<br />\r<br />- Riverwood - (V0.1) is released\r<br />\r<br />- Dragon Bridge - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- Ivarstead - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- Karthwasten - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- Rorikstead - not yet completed\r<br />\r<br />- Shor&#39;s Stone - not yet completed\r<br />[line]\r<br />[img]https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/10270824_10152402965709189_6646931807125246817_n.jpg[/img]\r<br />[line]\r<br />Use NMM to install or if your doing it manually then just copy the file(s) downloaded here and place them in your skyrim data folder and make sure you have activated the .esp(s) in your Skyrim Launcher.\r<br />[line]\r<br />[img]https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/10291794_10152402965374189_2040155054134122673_n.jpg[/img]\r<br />[line]\r<br />Just deactivate in NMM or delete the .esp(s) in you Skyrim data folder.\r<br />[line][/center]\r<br />",
