This will allow you to use the bows without them breaking your game. I put a pic of a normal elven bow up so you could see a direct comparison.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the valenwood war bow was pretty easily crafted fairly early on, sold for around 5k and did about half as much again as a normal elven bow.\r\n\r\nI changed all of that to vanilla specs for everything, so this allows you to craft the bows but makes them exactly the same costs and stats as vanilla bows are.\r\nI also got rid of the weird NPC in the drunken huntsman that sold the 6k gold bows...\r\nBows appear under each and every smithing perk with the exception of daedric.\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\nValenwood War Bow is now under Ebony smithing.\r\nMammoth Bows are under Dragonbone smithing.\r\nKhajit Bow is now under Dwarven - I needed a dwarven bow and the Khajit bow true to its\\' name needed a home ;)\r\n\r\nI find this useful so thought I would share.\r\nAny problems/issues or inconsistencies tell me.\r\n\r\nIf you think you are going mad because wasn\\'t this up to version 1.101beta ? You\\'re not going mad (at least for this reason), I reverted it back to 1.0 because there weren\\'t any problems with that.\r\n\r\nSince then howiego08 has decided to allow anyone to mod better bows as long as they give him credit, so I will be working on a new stand alone version of this mod soon[tm].",
