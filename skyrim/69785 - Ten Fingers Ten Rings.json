  "descriptionHtml": "This mod uses the &#34;unnamed&#34; slots for the player.\r<br />\r<br />DESCRIPTION\r<br />***********\r<br />This adds ten new rings to the game that can be enchanted and worn, [color=#ffff00][b]HOWEVER THEY WILL NOT BE VISIBLE ON YOUR FINGERS.[/b][/color]\r<br />They have been integrated into the WhiterunWarmaidensBlacksmithChest container&#39;s leveled list and will be found on bandits in later versions.\r<br />They have names like &#34;Right Hand Index Finger Ring&#34; to compensate for the player slot abuse that Bethesda has a habit of using in their games. (there were 18 armor slots for Morrowind, there are only 7 for Skyrim). You can wear one ring on each finger, and can still wear one normal ring.",
