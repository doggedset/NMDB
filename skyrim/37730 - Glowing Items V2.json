I&#39;ll do something about it later. I&#39;ve set the range at 1200, so it should fill a medium sized room. you need to wait a few seconds between explosions, so the aliases can be emptied and refilled with items.\r<br />\r<br />The books in the one picture are glowing because of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10012//?]Unread Books Glow[/url]. since that mod works better then anything I could do I&#39;m not doing books.\r<br />\r<br />Manual Install\r<br />Put the esp and Scripts folder in the Data folder and check the box in the launcher to \r<br />\r<br />enable the mod.\r<br />\r<br />Manual Uninstallation\r<br />Uncheck the esp in the launcher and delete any script the has aaaaglowing.\r<br />\r<br />Bugs\r<br />Items that have problems glowing.\r<br />Poison bottles: some don&#39;t glow and others only the stopper glows.\r<br />Deathbell: Only the underside glows.\r<br />Gourd: the leaves don&#39;t glow.\r<br />Leek: Looking down from the top doesn&#39;t glow.\r<br />\r<br />if the items don&#39;t glow try typing stopquest in the console with ` with one of the quests below related to the item you are trying to make glow.\r<br />after that type startquest with the same quest you just stopped.\r<br />\r<br />aaaaglowingaliasArmor\r<br />aaaaglowingaliasContainers\r<br />aaaaglowingaliasFood\r<br />aaaaglowingaliasGems\r<br />aaaaglowingaliasGold\r<br />aaaaglowingaliasIngredients\r<br />aaaaglowingaliasJewelry\r<br />aaaaglowingaliasOreIngots\r<br />aaaaglowingaliasPelts\r<br />aaaaglowingaliasPoison\r<br />aaaaglowingaliasPotion\r<br />aaaaglowingaliasWeapons",
