  "descriptionHtml": "Replaces the cloth textures of the Requiem added Guard Plate Armors. I expected someone else to make a similar mod, since many people were quite dissatisfied with the old textures, but since no one has, I decided to improvise . \n<br />\n<br />I tried to make the colors of the robes match the ones in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42404?tab=files]Frankly HD Stormcloak and City Guards[/url], which I recommend if you want the light and plate guard armors to match better.\n<br />\n<br />I haven't really done much other than a bit of color tweaking in GIMP and adding the hold emblems to the robes. Most of the work was done by MonkeyKong in HighRes Mage clothes colored Robes and Hoods, whose textures I've edited.\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36310/]HighRes Mage clothes colored Robes and Hoods[/url]",
