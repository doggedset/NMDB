  "descriptionHtml": "=====================\r<br />Brief Description:\r<br />=====================\r<br />\r<br />Experiment Pack 1 is a modder&#39;s resource containing furniture, trophies, display items, clutter and a large static library developed during the creation of The FPI Gallery for Console Decorators.\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Details:\r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />Experiment Pack 1 from the Fuzzy Physics Institute research labs contains approximately 350 items developed during the creation of The FPI Gallery for Console Decorators.\r<br />\r<br />The majority of the items are from a large library of Bethesda assets that were turned to statics during that project. Had I had such a library available to me, it would have saved me many hours. Perhaps other new modders will benefit by not having to stop in the middle of doing something creative just because they need a static tomato or pitchfork. Perhaps even more experienced modders, who have already created their own libraries of statics, will find something that will save them a couple of minutes of hunting down a Bethesda asset and changing it.\r<br />\r<br />The remainder of the items are unique static creations, including clutter items, a few pieces of furniture, variants on the standard bug jar, tabletop and wall display cases, trophies from Dawnguard and Dragonborn, food and tableware mashups, and a large collection of static banners with the textures and meshes tweaked to remove holes. Please see the additional documentation for some notes regarding the setup and usage of certain items in the Pack.\r<br />\r<br />=========================\r<br />Installation (Manual):\r<br />=========================\r<br />\r<br />1) Extract the contents of the archive to the Skyrim Data folder.\r<br />2) Use the assets in your projects.\r<br />\r<br />============================\r<br />Un-Installation (Manual):\r<br />============================\r<br />\r<br />1) Remove the assets from your projects. \r<br />2) Delete the files installed by Experiment Pack 1.\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Incompatible:\r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />None known\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Known Issues:\r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />None known\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Change log:\r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />2013.09.29 - Initial Release\r<br />\r<br />2014.10.04 - Version 1.1 Release\r<br />\r<br />    1) Restored missing mesh folder containing the mesh for the Baker&#39;s Table.
