  "descriptionHtml": "So I&#39;m sure that pretty much everyone who ever picked up all 3 words for the fire breath shout was as disappointed as me. This is why I went to all this trouble?&#33; So I could sneeze a little flame at my enemies?\r<br />&lt;br/&gt;\r<br />&lt;br/&gt;I felt cheated, obviously.
