  "descriptionHtml": "Wild Peace Amulet \r\n\r\nThis amulet is a sacred artifact of Kynareth, wild beasts\r\nwill be at peace with the wearer.\r\n\r\nSame as the Voice of the Sky effect except its constant.\r\nFound at the bandit camp site at the Riverwood/Helgen crossroads.\r\n\r\nI happen to enjoy leisurely riding my horse from point A to B while\r\nadventuring across Skyrim and nothing is more annoying than constantly\r\nhaving wolves, skeevers, bears and sabercats attack me or my horsie, while\r\nhacking wolves every 10 seconds is a great way to help level up it can be\r\na real pita later on, this mod solves the issue.\r\n\r\nThere are of course many other methods to achieve this, but this is mine.\r\nCall it a cheat if you want, I call it peace.\r\n\r\nOther than spiders this mod will keep the roads generally safe for horse travel, most monster spawns are away from the main roads so...have fun.\r\n\r\nNo requirements, made with latest patch 1.8\r\nInstall with NMM or manually.\r\n\r\n(02/05/13)\r\n\r\nShad",
