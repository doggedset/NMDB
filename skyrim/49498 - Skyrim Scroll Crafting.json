(Optional) (See post for more details)[/color] \r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b][color=yellow] FAQ: [/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Q: How do I craft scrolls? \r<br />A: To craft a scroll you will need an Ink Well and a Quill in your inventory. These items will not be removed upon Scroll Crafting. You&#39;ll also need a minimum of 1 Paper Roll and 1 Charcoal. You also need to have the required perk introduced in Scroll Crafting v3\r<br />\r<br />Q: Help&#33; I used the Inscription Table but I can&#39;t craft any scrolls. \r<br />A: Unless you have both an Inkwell and Quill in your inventory at the time of using the Inscription Table, the list will only display &#34;Paper Roll&#34;. You also need to have the required perk introduced in Scroll Crafting v3\r<br />\r<br />Q: Where is the &#34;Inscription Dungeon&#34;? \r<br />A: It&#39;s located at the College of Winterhold. There&#39;s a trap door on the opposite side of the College where The Midden is located, as seen in the screenshot. \r<br />\r<br />Q: Is there any new scrolls? \r<br />A: Yes&#33; Version 2 adds 10 new scrolls to the game. More information is available under details for v2. \r<br />\r<br />Q: Does this mod require anything else? \r<br />A: Nope. Just download with NMM and double click to install. Or download manually and move the ScrollCrafting.esp to your Skyrim&gt;Data Folder. \r<br />\r<br />Note: This is my first mod. I spent quite a bit of time on it plus tons of testing to make sure everything works as it should. Any feedback or suggestions is welcomed.",

      "changelogHtml": " Scroll Crafting Version 3.0 Changelog \r<br />\r<br />With this update, I&#39;ve made quite a few changes to further enchance and make Scroll Crafting more unique on its own.The biggest change is the introduction of new perk system. In order to keep balance within the game, and avoid crafting master level scrolls over and over, each teir of scrolls now requires a perk. The perk is based on the level of the scroll.So for example; Novice and Master level scrolls need their corrisponding perk.\r<br />\r<br />The perks can be found within the Enchanting Skill tree. I&#39;ve lowered the level required for more balance. So you won&#39;t need level 100 Enchanting for Master level scrolls.Crafting Scrolls will advance your Enchanting perk, so you won&#39;t need to worry about grinding your enchantment skill just to\r<br />craft scrolls. \r<br />\r<br />Another big change (for me personally anyway) is the new Inscription Table. It&#39;s no longer a simple Enchanting table. It&#39;s completely unqiue to Scroll Crafting and I hope you just like the new look. I&#39;ve also added the remander of scrolls that were\r<br />originally left out. There&#39;s now a new total, including the ones I made personally, of 85 scrolls to craft. Scroll Crafting Lore Friendly Optional Patch (Nexus Only) has also been updated with all of v3 changes. As before, only have the .esp active of the version you&#39;d like to use. Having both active could cause some serious issues. \r<br />\r<br />I really hope you\r<br />guys enjoy the new update. As always, keep those suggestions and feedback coming.
