  "descriptionHtml": "Part 2 for Castle Dour is now ready&#33;  - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50910/?\r<br />\r<br />Check out my other mods:\r<br />\r<br />1 - True Clandestine Nightingale Hall - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35994/?\r<br />\r<br />2 - The Game - Thalmor plot of murder, betrayal and espionage (part 1) - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48233/?\r<br />\r<br />I have always wondered why the leaders of the two main factions had so little in the way of personal defense in the middle of an all-out war.  You show up to the Jarl&#39;s doorstep and only a couple of guards stand between you and ending a civil war with one swift stroke of a poison dagger.\r<br />\r<br />Although it&#39;s true that both Tullius and Ulfric are &#34;essential&#34;, and the guards wouldn&#39;t stop you from approaching anyway no matter how many I put in there, my mod nonetheless tries to add a bit more realism and immersion by offering more &#34;protection&#34; to each leader.\r<br />\r<br />Specifically, this mod will add a dozen NPCs to the Palace of Kings:\r<br />\r<br />8 elite guards;\r<br />2 elite archers;\r<br />2 named &#34;heroic&#34; NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />The base level of the NPCs is from 50 to 60, and will defend any of their faction&#39;s guards or leaders as any other guard would - so if you plan on winning the civil war, you will either have to be quite the badass Dragonborn, or bring a small army - the latter of which I feel is more realistic.\r<br />\r<br />It seems silly how one player can just charge into enemy HQ and single-handedly win a civil war.  The old &#34;invincible hero&#34; cutting through dozens of guards almost nonchalantly gets pretty old, if you ask me.\r<br />\r<br />This is only part 1 of the mod - it adds NPCs to the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm.  Part 2 will fill up Castle Dour.\r<br />\r<br />Any comments, suggestions or bug reports are welcome.\r<br />\r<br />Please not that I have uploaded two versions - one with Cloaks of Skyrim enabled (you need this mod for it to function), and one without - it is completely independent and requires nothing.\r<br />\r<br />Stay tuned for part 2&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Credit:\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Cloaks of Skyrim&#34; by Noodles - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12092/?\r<br />\r<br />From his Permission section: &#34;If you just wish to use one of the cloak meshes for an armour/clothing/companion mod, then go ahead. You have permission to use the resources for anything along those lines.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t think he&#39;d have any issues with me borrowing a few of his cloaks, however if you are Noodles and do not wish me to use your mod as a master file, let me know.",
