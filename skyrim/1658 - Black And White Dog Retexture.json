  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Black & White Dog Retexture 1.0 Final[/b]\r\n\r\nJust made a simple touch up to the original bethseda dog texture since i \r\nthink the original looks like crap with the coloring.\r\n\r\nSo i \r\n-Darkened the dog texture added some white/greyish spots to make it look a tad more interesting. \r\n-Changed to eye to one from a nordic sled dog. \r\n-Removed the black cracks in the paw (don\\'t know why they were there, looked like shit). \r\n-Brushed up some areas on the skin to remove some of the unconsistency in the texture.\r\n-Also got rid of the black line across the middle of the dog from face to tail (where the texture mirrors), big immersion breaker for me personally there.\r\n\r\nAnd i have not used any SHARPEN FILTERS !!!!!! Amazing right?\r\n\r\nHope some of you will enjoy it!\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\nJust drop the Data folder in your main Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\n[b]Uninstallation[/b]\r\nRemove file dog.dds from Skyrim/Data/Textures/Actors/Dog/\r\n\r\nCheers!",
