  "descriptionHtml": "I DON\\'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE MY DESCRIPTION PRETTY.  \r\n\r\nAdds 4 new perks,  three to the 1h tree and one to the archery tree.   I play using combat realism perks and uniform arrow damage, I\\'ve thoroughly tested the effects and they don\\'t seem to be broken or OP but if anyone playing without combat and realism mods finds them to be game breaking please let me know so I can modify the damage multipliers and values\r\n\r\nI\\'ll get pictures up when my wife can take screenshots :D\r\n\r\n============================================================================================\r\n\r\nThe perks:\r\n\r\nMijin Gakure:  significantly increases crit chance and damage for one handed weapons if your HP drops below 15%\r\n\r\nKeen Edge 1 and 2: Adds marginal limb damage, a little crit chance and a small amount of damage to one handed attacks\r\n\r\nAmanokakoyumi:  Deals greater bow damage and has a chance to disarm enemies of the same sex who are below 50% HP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpcoming\r\n\r\nZashin: 100% decapitation forward moving power (sweeping) attack for enemies under 5% HP\r\n\r\nutsusemi: Light armor perk enemies have a 75% chance of missing attacks if you are under 1% HP\r\n\r\nYukikaze: 15% chance to deal 250% damage with two-handed attacks, or cause stagger 30% of the time\r\n\r\n===========================================================================================\r\n\r\nMain File # 2\r\n\r\nTachi 0, 20, 40, 60, 80:  Deal progressivly more damage in general and to limbs with Great-Swords.\r\n\r\nSodegarami:  The same buffs as Testubo but for some reason any time I try to add a perk description and only a description it results in a strange bug that blanks out 75% of the new perks.  I\\'ll address it in later versions.  Does not include the stagger modifier that Testubo has and only affects War-Axes \r\n\r\nTestubo:  Deal progressively more damage with War-Hammers as well as occasionally stagger opponents with ranks 3,4 and 5.\r\n\r\nTachi Ran:  Increases crit chance and damage with Great-Swords  (eventually, when I resolve the issue with Sodegarami I would like to add the need to have some skill in smithing to obtain this perk since it feels more realistic and authentic)\r\n\r\nSutoraiki Tsuru:  Gives a tiny boost to bash damage with 2h swords.\r\n\r\nSakura Shield:  Enhances blocking with 2h swords, roughly a 10-15% decrease in sustained damage depending on your armor.\r\n\r\nKaishakunin:  Essentially the same as the vanilla skill \\\"Devastating Blow\\\" but with a very minor increase in decapitation rates.   (I\\'m still working on making an AoE decapitation which procs off of enemy health % but a minor boost is good for now until I can figure out what is causing the bug with Sodegarami)\r\n\r\nThe other few perks that have been renamed are only renamed to keep in with the Samurai theme.\r\n\r\nThis file works perfectly fine as it is right now, the only problem is a missing description on one of the perks, nothing else is effected.   Every time I try to fix the problem something else worse occurs. \r\n\r\n============================================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a note,  I\\'ve noticed that mods that alter the perk trees can get finicky when multiple mods affect the same trees.   I had other mods that changed the archery tree and when used in combination with this mod, the first one took precedence. \r\n\r\nIf the mod isn\\'t working try disabling any other mods that add perks.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve fixed the spelling mistakes in the perk descriptions (I think) and fixed a \\\"small\\\" little bit of a bug caused by the marksman perk.  \r\nEverything should function as planned.   I\\'m sorry that this was such a process, this is my first time actually uploading a mod, hopefully no one will remember this little... *cough* ahem... when I upload future mods.\r\n\r\nIf you have downloaded this mod and you\\'re wondering why it isn\\'t working and you come back and see this, please just download the 2.0 version.  it works perfectly with all of my mods and by itself so now I know the only issues could be possible mod conflicts.",
