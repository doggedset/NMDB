  "descriptionHtml": "Updates:\r<br />\r<br />*10th, June 2014.\r<br /> I&#39;m back&#33; Version a2.1 is live&#33; This version simply adds more furnishings to the alchemy area. It&#39;s still  \r<br /> not perfect, but I&#39;m done for now, and felt like publishing the progress as a way to show that I am \r<br /> still working on this mod, and can&#39;t wait to get it finished.\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />My main reason for making this mod is to create a small homestead for the Dragonborn. I have always felt like the in-game homes aren&#39;t fit for the mighty Dovahkiin, and the Hearthfire homes are too time consuming to build, and frankly aren&#39;t very appealing to me. I have searched for hours for a house mod that suits my needs, and has an appealing look and layout so I decided to make my own. I wanted something with a lot of the features from the Hearthfire DLC, but I find that there are too many tough choices and quickloading for not enough of a reward in the expansion.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />*Skyrim\r<br />*Hearthfire DLC\r<br />\r<br />Recommended Mods:\r<br />*[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8655/?] Static Mesh Improvement Mod [/url] \r<br />*[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/607/?] Skyrim HD 2K Textures [/url]\r<br />*[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27043/?] Enhanced Lighting and FX [/url]\r<br />*[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26851/?] More plants and recipes for Hearthfire including Dawnguard and Dragonborn plants [/url]\r<br />\r<br />Completed Features:\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Work in Progress Features:\r<br />*Conservatory with over 40 planters\r<br />*Dedicated alchemy area\r<br />*Dedicated enchanting area\r<br />\r<br />Planned Features:\r<br />*Mid sized home\r<br />*Full smithy\r<br />*Apiary and fish hatchery\r<br />*Kitchen\r<br />*Courtyard with training dummies\r<br />\r<br />Notes:\r<br />*This is my first mod, and I hope to get better at it so I would really appreciate any and all\r<br /> feedback and constructive criticism you have.\r<br />\r<br />*I have absolutely no idea if this mod will cause performance issues for people. I get some\r<br /> stuttering while in the garden, but I am using very intensive mods so I don&#39;t know how it will affect\r<br /> other peoples&#39; performance.\r<br />\r<br />*This is a personal-use mod so I will change and add features as I see fit, however like I said I&#39;m\r<br /> looking for feedback so please don&#39;t hesitate.\r<br />\r<br />*Cell names are as follow. (Conservatory)&#34;aaaplayerhomeconservatory&#34;, (Alchemy and\r<br /> Enchanting)&#34;aaaplayerhomealchench&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />*If you don&#39;t like this mod please don&#39;t just tag as NSFW.\r<br />\r<br />*If there&#39;s something you don&#39;t like about the mod please state it in the comments and be\r<br /> descriptive. If you just tag as &#34;not lore-friendly&#34;, or &#34;unrealistic&#34; that doesn&#39;t help me improve the \r<br /> mod much. Lore-friendliness and realism are two things I would like to maintain in this mod, but \r<br /> saying only that my mod is neither of those things doesn&#39;t tell me what the offending aspect is.",
