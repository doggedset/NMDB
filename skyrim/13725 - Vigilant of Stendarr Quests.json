INFORMATION ON THE MOD           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod makes the Vigilant of Stendarr a joinable faction and adds quests.\r\n\r\n\t   To start the mod, go to the Hall of the Vigilant which is on the west side of the road \r\nleading south from Dawnstar.  Go down the stairs behind the shrine and talk to Heinrich about joining.\r\n\r\n\t   The Vigilant of Stendarr have some rather strong beliefs and are rather particular about \r\nwho they will let join.  They will only accept you if you don\\'t have a bounty, if you have never \r\ntrafficked with daedra (completed any daedric artifact quests,) if you are not a vampire or werewolf,\r\nand if you do not belong to any organizations that secretly harbor werewolves.  (If you don\\'t want to \r\nplay with these restrictions, you can download the patch.)\r\n\r\n\t   The mod is fully voice-acted.\r\n\r\n\t   When you join the faction, you can use the beds, eat the food, and take supplies that you \r\nneed from the headquarters of the order.  You will be given an outfit you can wear.\r\n\r\n\t   This version contains seven quests.\r\n\r\n\t   It is sort of a shame that the original game did not make the Vigilant of Stendarr into a \r\njoinable faction with lots of quests. \t   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n2. Installation                           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n           Extract (decompress) the .esp, .esm, and .bsa to your Skyrim directory.  (It will be \r\nsomething like *Installation directory*\\\\Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data)\r\nMark the boxes next to the Vigilant of Stendarr Quests .esp and .esm in your mod manager.\r\n \r\n           Alternately, extract files someplace else.  Then move the .esp, .esm, and .bsa to \r\nSkyrim\\\\Data.  Mark the boxes next to the .esp and .esm in your mod manager.\r\n************************************************************************\r\n3. Version History    \r\n************************************************************************\r\nV 1.5    7/14/12   Repackaged because of a missing werewolf script file.\r\nV 1.4    5/1/12    FUZed to see if it helps the few people with dialog not working on their computers.  \r\n\t\t   BSAed.\r\nV 1.3    4/15/12   Seven quests total.\r\nV 1.2    4/8/12    Restructuring of dialog voice types.  Five quests total.\r\nV 1.1    4/2/12    Editing of quest start condition structure.  Four quests total.\r\nV 1.0    3/25/12   Initial release. Three quests   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n4. Conflicts, Known Issues, and Troubleshooting\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   Skyrim is not as reliable for mod usage as Oblivion was.  In Oblivion, if a mod worked\r\nright, it could generally be used and work right on any computer.  But with Skyrim, there are lots of\r\nreported cases where mods that work right for almost everyone else do not work on particular computers.  \r\nNo explanation has been found.  So if this mod does not work on your computer, but you have installed \r\nit right, then you should just give up and go play another mod.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod will likely conflict with other Vigilant of Stendarr mods. \r\n\r\n\t   This mod is compatible with the Vigilant of Stendarr-related mod \\\"Quest No_Mercy\\\"\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12024\r\n\r\n\t   The difficulty level of this mod is such that you may not be able to complete some of the\r\nquests at a low level or may need followers.\r\n\r\n\t   The philosophy of this mod project is generally opposed to the use of quest markers and \r\nprefers verbal and text instructions instead.\r\n\r\n\t   The quests are not always built in the ideal fashion because the scripting is not working.  \r\nBecause of this, the plans are sometimes having to be changed and simplified.\r\n\r\n\t   The team lead is a real jerk, doesn\\'t know anything about managing people, and doesn\\'t know\r\nmuch about modding.\r\n\r\n\t   The questcoder/scripter has no idea what he is doing and is making a big mess.\r\n\r\n\t   The voice actor doesn\\'t have a good voice and doesn\\'t know how to act.\r\n\r\n\t   The dungeon-builder is a lazy good-for-nothing who has submitted very little work so far.\r\n\r\n\t   The project has only just begun, yet it is falling apart.  The modders all hate each other.  \r\nThe stress of realizing that Skyrim is vastly much harder to mod than Oblivion is taking its toll. \r\nEveryone is threatening to leave the project.  We are not sure how many more quests will be built.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod still needs more testing under a variety of operating conditions.\r\n\t\r\n\t   If you locate a bug, contact David Brasher on TES Nexus so that the situation can be\r\nexamined and can hopefully be fixed. \r\n************************************************************************\r\n5.
