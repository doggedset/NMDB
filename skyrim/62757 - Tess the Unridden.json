  "descriptionHtml": "Tess The Unridden\r<br />Author: Twisted Master\r<br />\r<br />Her name was not always Tess the Unridden. Her birth name was Uthgerd the Unbroken.\r<br />Uthgerd the Unbroken was a lonely girl. Loving to adventure through Skyrim, but not wanting to go it alone.\r<br />Then one day she got an idea. If I change my name and dispostion, maybe people will like me more.\r<br />Then I would be alone no more. Alas Tess the Unridden was reborn. And so the story continues.\r<br />\r<br />I have always believed that rather than add more to Skyrim, why not just improve what&#39;s there already.\r<br />And this is true of followers too. Skyrim + DLC gives you about 15 - 20 in game followers.\r<br />Though they are lacking in looks, character, and abilities.\r<br />But all that can be fixed. And Tess is but one example.\r<br />The reason I&#39;m sharing this with the Nexas community is because she has recieved so little, much needed,\r<br />attention from the community.\r<br />Now since I already had Lydia as a Battlemage, I was still lacking a combat assassin type.\r<br />So Tess is set up as a missile combat assassin thief. This filled in the gap between other followers.\r<br />She is set essential.\r<br />She can be married.\r<br />She duel wields daggers.\r<br />She comes with duel daedric daggers, daedric bow, daedric arrows, cure poison potion, cure desease potion,\r<br />restore all potion, food and drink, and more bits and pieces.\r<br />Her relationship with player is as an ally.\r<br />She is also an ally and cousin of Lydia, an ally of Rayya, and ally of Serana.\r<br />She has a complete AI Package that includes: 3 eat times, 1 sleep package, 1 master package, and 1 sandbox current\r<br />location package.\r<br />She has the needed spells and perks relevent to her Specilizations.\r<br />\r<br />Regarding load order: This is always how to do follower mods. First Load your follower control mod (UFO, AFT, etc). Second load any and all custom non game followers.\r<br />Last load any modified vanilla game followers (Such as Tess). This is so game followers can recognize custom non game followers.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />Skyrim.esm, update.esm, dawnguard.esm, dragonborn.esm, and hearthfires.esm\r<br />SG Hairs by Hello Santa: http://pan.baidu.com/wap/link?uk=3574985185&shareid=2204221951&third=0\r<br />******A note here: Hello Santa Hairs comes with an ESM and an ESP. In order to load both as master I had to convert the ESP to a ESM.\r<br />I made no other changes to it and have included that ESM only in this mod. You still need to download SG Hairs and replace their\r<br />ESP with this ESM.\r<br />\r<br />Whats included in this mod:\r<br />UNP Body by DIMONIZED: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?\r<br />Tattoos for UNP female body by: candymanXXL: www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7834/?\r<br />SGHairPackAIO.esm (This is the ESP file from SG Hairs changed to an ESM, needed to do this because can only add ESM&#39;s as masters). Just copy/paste to your Skyrim data folder. Then go in data folder and delete the ESP.\r<br />TessTheUnridden.esp\r<br />meshes\r<br />textures\r<br />Images of Tess\r<br />\r<br />A big thanks to:\r<br />Hello Santa: http://pan.baidu.com/wap/linkuk=3574985185&shareid=2204221951&third=0\r<br />candymanXXL:\r<br />www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7834/?\r<br />DIMONIZED UNP Body:\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?",
