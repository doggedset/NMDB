Shortest duration is 2.5 game hours. Longest duration is 10 game hours.\r<br />      Conjuration experience is gained when the fire pit is summoned.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[size=3][color=#ff7700]Important information:[/color]\r<br />[list][*]The spells are novice level and are available wherever Conjure Familiar may be found.  That means any merchant that sells Conjure Familiar can also sell these spells. Any loot location that could have Conjure Familiar could also have these spells. Please use Wrye Bash to ensure that the leveled lists are appropriately merged.\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Care should be taken when casting these spells.  They will snap to the navemesh but that does not mean that they won&#39;t clip with nearby objects.  Flat surfaces are best. Slopes are not good.\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]The fire pit will disappear when the cell it is in is detached.  This was done to prevent the fire pit from not clearing out and potentially bloating save games.\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list][/size]\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3]Permissions:[/size][/color]\r<br />   Open source.
