  "summary": "This mod adds the armor of the mighty Duke Vampire, dissapeared during a revolt ,inside Castle Volkihar, \r<br />involving Lord Harkon and Valerica.\r<br />",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hi folks, the other day i made this armour for personal use and i though, why dont sharing it? well there it is.\r<br />\r<br />The mod contains the Duke Vampire set (armour, gloves, boots, hood) which is a variation of the royal vampire set (new color, new pauldron, less skirt, less cape...)\r<br />Its temperable and supports all races. (see pictures) to upgrade it you need leather and a daedra heart.\r<br />Its only for male characters (since i think the royal vampire armour looks cool on female characters) but female characters can still use the hood, gloves and boots.\r<br />There is no body slider, sorry...\r<br />\r<br />The set has similar stats to the glass set.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The chest containing the armor can be found somewhere in Castle Volkihar.\r<br />If you can&#39;t find it, the location is at the end of the Readme.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Have fun and remember to endorse if you liked it  :)\r<br />\r<br />-Requirements-\r<br />Dawnguard DLC\r<br />\r<br />-Installation-\r<br />Drop the Data folder into your:  SteamApps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />-Credits-\r<br />Bethesda for doing CK and Skyrim\r<br />L0rd Of War for importing the Witcher 2 Armors\r<br />Hood mesh:  AmethystDeceiver http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5696/?\r<br />Mr. Dave for his help duirng the process, man you are so damn pro :D http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12060/?\r<br />\r<br />You cannot sell or redistribute this mod to other pages.",
