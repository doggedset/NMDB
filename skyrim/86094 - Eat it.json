Our character can eat dragon souls, so why he couldn&#39;t eat a broom for example? Or any ingot? Or troll skull? Such a diet for noble hero.\r<br />Â Now, if you as me have endless loot in your pockets, just find cookpot and make something tasty.\r<br />\r<br />ps. if you use mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30726/?]Dine with followers[/url], your food will appear in the plate, like on my screens.",
