  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a Retex of the Dwarven Shield. I really like the Dwarven Armor Set, espacially the Shield, but in my opinion it is to \\\"clear\\\" (like the Ebony Shield too). I decided to make an old and worn out looking Version of the Shield, and after hours of \\\"work\\\" i just made it :) \r\n\r\nThis is one of my first mods. It was a personal mod, but since it took me hours to finish, i decided to share it with you. Maybe iÂ´ll make some other \\\"worn out\\\" Mods to some shields, let me know what you think about this one.\r\n\r\nInstallation :\r\n\r\nJust copy the files into your Skirim Data Folder.\r\ne.g. skyrim folder/Data/\r\n\r\nTo uninstall just delete them.",
