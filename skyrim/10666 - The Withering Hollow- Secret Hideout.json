  "descriptionHtml": "Hey everyone!  This is my first Skyrim mod, so I\\'m still a beginner, but I wanted to share my ideas with the rest of the community and possibly get some feedback!\r\n\r\nI\\'m not sure if anyone feels the same, but I\\'ve always been inspired by secret hideouts in very secluded locations.  As you may all already know, there are a few handful of places like that already, but they are either already owned, or they require that you finish a whole guild line.  My point is that there are no secret niches we can call our \\'own\\'.\r\n\r\nThere should be a new map marker located just slightly north of Falkreath, and it should take you to an oddly stationed tent under a waterfall, which shelters a hidden trapdoor.  Make sure to look around carefully before entering the dwelling!  There is a story that goes with the body parts lying around.\r\n\r\nInside, you\\'ll find a nice fireplace with a cooking pot, an alchemy table, as well as an arcane enchanter and a bed.  There is a secret passage way within the secret niche, but I wonder spoil it!\r\n\r\nAnyway, the purpose of creating this mod was so that I could whet my modding abilities and learn the basics.  I hope you all enjoy, and please leave comments and feedback!\r\n\r\nFor those without mod manager, simply download the .rar and extract the content into the data folder in your skyrim directory.  There should just be a witheringhollow.esp\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nDownload the latest Withering Hollow version!  There is now a storage chest in the Foul Pit, and a few edits have been made.  Brandov Haelstrom from the diary can be found inside.\r\n\r\nFUTURE UPDATES:\r\n-additional interiors\r\n-the rest of the craft tables\r\n-more intricate detail\r\n\r\nIn the future, I may improve Withering Hollow and add onto the story line that goes with it.
