  "modName": "Imperial Law",
  "summary": "This mod adds a new weapon called \\\"Imperial Law\\\", to the Abandoned Prison.\r\nThe weapon itself is an Iron Warhammer with crazy stats. No retexture or anything, just something\r\nunique.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Not only has the weapon been added, this mod adds a small little story of how the Hammer got there in the first place - it ties in with the story of the prison so it\\'s all Lore-Friendly. There will\r\nbe a small journal on the ground next to the Hammer, as well as a potion, a helmet and a knapsack.\r\nI always thought that this prison needed something special at the end, because it\\'s a very unique\r\nDungeon in a scenic location. Something was missing, so that\\'s why made this mod, to try and fill\r\nthe gap.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATS\r\n\r\n\r\nBase damage of 20, Absorb Health 15 points for 3 seconds - it has a small amount of charge because it\\'s pretty OP.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nUse the Nexus Mod Manager, because it\\'s easy, ok?",
