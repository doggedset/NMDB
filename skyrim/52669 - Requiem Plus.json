  "descriptionHtml": "[color=orange][heading]About[/color][/heading]\r<br />Requiem Plus adds several quality of life fixes which are completely optional to Requiem, some are off by default. All of this is managed from Requiem Plus&#39; MCM Menu in game. I made this mod and learned CK in a weeks period, and I admit I have not playtested it very much. \r<br />\r<br />However I believe it to work properly, and I&#39;ve gone over my own mod with TES5Edit / CK and made sure I have no dirty edits. I am a programmer, and this was a fun project. Some of the fixes are no brainers, like giving Horses regenerating health, other fixes are more heavy handed and are off by default. Pick and choose what you want.\r<br />\r<br />For stuff like my Invisible Entity fix, I scripted a new replacement entity that is still a challenging fight, but at the same time much more visible. It shares the exact same loot tables which the Invisible Entities do, and if you don&#39;t like them you can turn them off.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][heading]Features[/color][/heading]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Spell Tome Fix - Adds missing spell tomes to vendors for spells that are only available in multiple choice perks\r<br />\r<br />[*]Invisible Entity Fix - Replaces the invisible entity mobs found in Soul Cairn and a few other places with easier more visible Soul Torn entities, these mobs should still prove challenging. Adds an ash corpse to both entities, even if the fix is turned off.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Healing Horses Fix - Adds passive HP regeneration to all horses, normally horses permanently accrue damage.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Grindy Crafting - When off you will receive a 2x XP bonus to all crafting skills, when on it goes back to Requiem rates. This is still much lower than default Skyrim&#39;s rates.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Jumping Penalty - When off you will not receives a penalty to stamina when pressing space, when on it defaults to Requiem behaviour.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Sneak Immunity - Allows you to bypass Sneak Damage negation found on almost all high level mobs in requiem, normally many creatures will reduce all sneak damage to a 1.0x multiplier, this removes that mechanic.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Dual Wield Sneak Attack - Allows you to perform sneak attacks while wielding two weapons, this fix was not added with balance in mind, so it will make the game easier.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Cheats [Cheater&#39;s Kit] - Outfits your character in uber badass highly mobile gear, I used it to test various questlines and move around faster. I left it in, use it if you want to cheat... or test.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][heading]Reddit Discussions[/color][/heading]\r<br />While crafting this mod I made several posts on [url=http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem]/r/skyrimrequiem[/url], some of the more interesting posts are below.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ll fix the formatting of this later...\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/200lus/requiem_extended_invisible_entity_fix/]Invisible Entity Fix - Writeup from when I first added the feature during playtesting.[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/1zx5ta/requiem_extended_day_2_mod/cfyd2st]Is this compatible with the unofficial Requiem patches?
