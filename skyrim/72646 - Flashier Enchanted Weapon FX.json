  "modName": "Flashier Enchanted Weapon FX",
  "summary": "a mod that add effects to your enchanted weapon making it look immersive AF, and lore friendly AF, \r<br />very awesome if you have many enchanted weapons with fire,etc",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][font=Comic Sans MS][color=#00ff00][size=4][u]Ever wished that your magic dragon-killing sword looked a bit more, well, magical? \r<br />\r<br />At the very least a sword of burning fire ought to have actual flames on it. \r<br />\r<br />In fact the Skyrim engine doesn&#39;t allow using EffectShader forms to add particles to weapons - they have to be made outside the CK and imported as NIFs - which I assume is why I&#39;ve never yet seen a mod to sort this out. \r<br />\r<br />This is my shot at the problem, using what art assets I could scrounge from the existing game data.\r<br />\r<br />The most common weapon enchantments are supported, but some of the effects work better than others. YMMV&#33; \r<br />\r<br />No DLC required. Do whatever you want with this mod. but with the permission of the author&#33;[/u][/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />\r<br />if u want to decrease the effect, go edit skyrimprefs.ini in your C:&#92;Users&#92;PCname&#92;Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim folder , then edit this line,\r<br />[Particles]\r<br />iMaxDesired=xxx  default should be 750, can be increased for more effects.\r<br />\r<br />(warning) it will also affect ingame particles like dragon fire breath, anything related to dust,smoke,snow,fx effects.\r<br />\r<br />Credits to the owner of this mod : http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056242479/\r<br />i dont own full credits of this mod, i asked him a permission to upload this awesome mod on nexus which he already uploaded on steam workshop",
