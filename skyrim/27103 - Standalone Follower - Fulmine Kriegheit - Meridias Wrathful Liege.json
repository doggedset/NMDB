  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6]\r\nATTN: This file, and my other standalone follower mods have been discontinued in favor of a page that hosts all of them as one mod, along with updates/new followers/etc.\r\n\r\nThat mod page can be found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38042//?\r\n[/size]\r\n\r\n[Heading]Name: Fulmine Kriegheit\r\n\r\nRace: Breton\r\n\r\nEye Color: Red\r\n\r\nLocation: Arcadia\\'s Cauldron\r\n\r\n[/Heading]\r\n\r\n[Heading][Center]Important Notice!\r\n\r\nAfter talking with a Moderator, I\\'ve come to the conclusion that I should change Fulmine\\'s Armor Set. Any further changes can be viewed in the Change Log.[/Center]\r\n\r\n[/Heading]\r\n[B][COLOR=Red]Download Instructions:[/COLOR]\r\n\r\nThrough Nexus Mod Manager (Recommended)\r\n1.

Extract the Contents (BSA and ESP) to the Skyrim Data Folder\r\n3. Done! Enjoy Your new companion\r\n\r\n[COLOR=Red]Notes:[/COLOR]\r\nAll of my followers are created with Master Difficulty (Or Higher through Mods), and for later game in mind . That being said, if they seem broken/OP early on, or on low difficulties, that\\'s why.\r\n\r\nAs always, my follower\\'s are completely standalone, unless stated otherwise. I put a lot of work into their backgrounds, so I hope you take the time to read them :3\r\n\r\nI\\'ve recently made the switch to Amazing Follower Tweaks (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15524) upon updating my game, and I haven\\'t looked back. I highly recommend trying it out alongside my followers. Remember to place the followers below AFT on the load order.\r\n\r\nThis follower has a special mace and shield: The mace shares the same abilities as Dawnbreaker (though, in mace form as she\\'s a mace wielder), and her shield has the Ysgramor Shield enchantment.\r\n\r\nPlease, leave comments, and endorse if you enjoy playing with my mods!\r\n\r\nIf there are any bugs or glitches, let me know and I\\'ll gladly fix them ASAP to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n[COLOR=Red]Changelog:[/COLOR]\r\nVersion 1: Initial Release\r\n\r\nVersion 2: Change of armor to avoid issues/Change Morality to allow all crimes. (I won\\'t judge you :3 )\r\n\r\nVersion 3: Realized the method I used had perks stacking up way too high, so, fixed that/Changed Path to Radiance\\'s description/Added a copy of Path to Radiance and Meridia\\'s Blessing to the same location as Dawnbreaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]Background:[/Color]\r\n\r\n\\\"... I warned them about the vampires...\\\"\r\n\r\nFulmine stands in the wrecked remains of the Hall of the Vigilant. Around her lay countless bodies, many of which were fully drained of blood.\r\n\r\nShe sighs; \\\"Can\\'t say they didn\\'t have it coming to them considering the current state of affairs... I don\\'t understand why they could have thought my message was in jest... Well, its a bit too late for that, isn\\'t it Meridia?\\\"\r\n\r\nThe Daedric prince of life speaks solemnly. She knew of the outcome long before it came to pass.\r\n\r\n\\\"Well, what are you waiting for? There are those who need my cleansing light. You shall provide it, correct?\r\n\r\nFulmine simply replies, \\\"As you will. Though, I request the allowance of burial rights.\\\"\r\n\r\nThe voice returns; \\\"Make it quick. We must show these undead the wrath of the living.\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"And I\\'ll need to stop in Whiterun for supplies. Hopefully Arcadia won\\'t mind me borrowing a few things.\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"If you must. However, as I said; Make it quick.\\\"\r\n\r\nFulmine\\'s eyes light up into a fierce red, a sign that her latest mission has begun...\r\n\r\nFulmine looks up at the sky. \\\"As you will, my liege.\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]Description:[/Color]\r\n\r\nFulmine is a young, strong-willed woman who has been called upon by Meridia, the daedric prince of life and Lady of Infinite Energies, to deal with disturbances in the cycles of life and death.
