  "summary": "This mod adds gates to the wall entrances in Riverwood.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Riverwood always seemed too exposed to me. Maybe it\\'s because Helgen had the same walls... but with actual gates in them, not gaping holes. So I added two gates to the town, one to the front entrance, and the other - you guessed it - to the rear, complete with torches to give the place some light. Ta-da! The Gates of Riverwood!\r\n\r\nNote: Should only conflict with mods which alter the walls of Riverwood (moving them or something like that). I also had to move the low stone fence and a couple of rocks a foot or so out of the way in order to prevent massive clipping; I don\\'t think you\\'ll notice anything ugly, though.\r\n\r\nPlease subscribe on Steam Workshop for faster, easier updating!\r\n\r\nv.1.0: (02/11/12)\r\nFirst release.",
