  "summary": "Hate that Stalhrim/Nordic armor looks fantastic, but wastes all that time you spent leveling up your Smithing skill so you could fashion yourself the best Daedric Armor available in the game? Well, now you don&#39;t have to give it up; this mod makes a special set of Stalhrim/Nordic weapons and armor that is better than the Daedric set&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/V0ICmGW.png[/img]\r<br />(image credit goes to user _Robbie from Reddit - and wherever they obtained the image)\r<br />\r<br />**** SORRY I HAVEN&#39;T HAD MUCH UPDATE ON THIS MOD GUYS. I GRADUATE IN ONE WEEK THOUGH AND AM REALLY EXCITED TO GET BACK TO MODDING, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS PEOPLE LIKE ME MORE THAN EVER. THANKS FOR BEING SO AWESOME. I LOVE YOU ALL&#33; *******\r<br />\r<br />Change Log:\r<br />V1.22\r<br /> - There was an issue (thanks for bringing it to my attention the1fallen3angel) with the Nordic Cuirass model not referencing the right texture, so it did not display in game. I have (to the best of my knowledge) fixed this in this version.\r<br />V1.2\r<br /> - Split the mod into two options (see Description below for details)\r<br />V1.1 \r<br /> - Changed the title of mod - its broader in scope than just the Stalhrim craftables\r<br /> - Added the Nordic carved craftable set to the list of infused craftables (cuz I think it looks bad@&#036;&#036;)\r<br /> - Still working on texturing and creating an appropriate quest\r<br /> - If the community has recommendations on armor or weapon sets they want infused, just request them in the comments and I will try to get to them\r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />Description\r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />This mod allows you to craft (or use the command console to obtain) the Nordic and Stalhrim weapon and armor sets, but infuse them with Daedra hearts in order to make them stronger than the Daedric quality items. Crafting requires the same items that would be needed to craft the base armors, with the addition of a Daedra heart or two. See below for specifics on what this mod does for the texturing of the armor and weapons.\r<br />\r<br />**This mod has been broken into two parts: Infused Armor and Weapons & Infused with Textures\r<br />\r<br />Infused Armor and Weapons: base mod that allows craftable Nordic and Stalhrim weapons and armor that is of better quality than the Daedric weapons and armor.\r<br />\r<br />Infused with Textures: the same as the base mod, but with a sample re-texture of JUST THE NORDIC ARMOR SET (for now). I will stress again that I am new with texturing, and you may not like this (I&#39;m not wholesomely a fan myself yet). The Daedric armor and weapons use a special &#34;glow&#34; mesh in their .nif, and then color-process it in game. I am trying to figure out how to do this so that I can implement that method in the next version, but it will take some time.\r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />-Most recent Skyrim and update (obviously)\r<br />-Dragonborn DLC\r<br />-For crafting, you need the necessary quests completed in Solstheim to access Stalhrim craftables\r<br />-Of course, the Daedric Perk to craft Daedric craftables&#33; \r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />Changes (to the base class)\r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />Armor\r<br />-Makes the rating (armor) a typical 1 or 2 points higher than the Daedric class\r<br />-It also adjusts the value to be a fraction higher than the value of Daedric as well\r<br />-Some uses of &#34;Gauntlets&#34; didn&#39;t fit pretty in the item screen; so now they&#39;re &#34;Gloves.&#34; They still have an armor rating, though.\r<br />-Nordic Daedric Armor now comes with a &#34;Custom&#34; texture set\r<br />\r<br />Weapons\r<br />-Makes the rating (damage) a typical 1 or 2 points higher than the Daedric class\r<br />-Adjusts the value to be a fraction higher than the value of Daedric weapons\r<br />-&#34;Greatsword&#34; didn&#39;t fit well in the item screen; so its now a &#34;G-Sword.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Crafting\r<br />-Daedra Heart required for crafting (at least 1 for most items)\r<br />-Daedric Smithing Perk Required (may change if highly requested)\r<br />\r<br />Tempering\r<br />-No changes on how the base classes are tempered\r<br />\r<br />Otherwise, all the other pre-requisites and conditions apply for creating and obtaining each set. Traits like reach, critical rating, speed, weight, etc. were not adjusted from the base values of each set (most of which are consistent throughout the other weapon and armor classes anyway).\r<br />\r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />Installation/Uninstallation\r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />You can install/uninstall using NMM. This mod contains no scripts, and should not bloat your save in any way. They are custom textures and meshes, and are dependent on nothing. Personally, for thoroughness, I prefer to make sure all relevant files are deleted manually, which I outline how to do below.\r<br />To install manually: extract the contents of either downloadable .zip file into the Skyrim/Data directory, and be sure to make the plug-ins active using either NMM or the Skyrim Launcher.\r<br />To uninstall manually: Delete the relevant &#34;Infused&#34; mod plug-in from your Skyrim/Data directory, and the following meshes and textures folders:\r<br />   meshes/dlc02/nordiccarved/ and /nordicshield/ (all files with &#34;better&#34; in title)\r<br />   textures/dlc02/nordiccarved/ and /nordicshield/ (all files with &#34;better&#34; in title)\r<br />\r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />Suggestions\r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />I know many of you are concerned about textures and capped armor ratings - the texture issue is addressed above in the description. As for capped armor ratings:\r<br />Yes, many have pointed out that this (and other armors) goes well beyond the armor cap the game sees. If you feel this is the case and is unnecessary, well...then don&#39;t download it? You could probably consider it &#34;completionist&#34; or whatever, but armor cap or no armor cap, by end-game I like to know I&#39;ve got the BEST possible armor and damage rating possible, with little to no &#34;god&#34; tweaks. Just how I feel about it, and I thought maybe others in the community might feel the same way, and that&#39;s why I decided to share it in the first place.\r<br />If you have any more suggestions or critiques on how or why this does not seem to fit with the game, please enlighten me on how and why you feel it should be so, and perhaps recommendations on how to make it better.\r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />From the changes listed above, as long as no mod conflicts with adjusting any of those, as far as I&#39;m aware it should be compatible with the multitude of mods out there. If you find it to conflict with an existing mod, please let me know in a constructive and informative way, and I will get to work on a fix ASAP.\r<br />\r<br />Updates:\r<br />This mod has gone a while now without having been updated. As addressed in some of the notes, you are free to take this mod and use it however you please if you need something done and don&#39;t want to wait. I am currently still strapped with school, and I&#39;ve got a drum kit restoration project I&#39;m also working on. My next plan is to try and get some kind of texture together for the Stalhrim armor as well as all of the weapons (I think the Nordic ones could look pretty sweet). Thanks for downloading and endorsing&#33;",
