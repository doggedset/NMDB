The discussion thread on this page has been disabled. Thanks.[/url][/color][/b][/center][/u]\r\n\r\n[b]Update 1.1:[/b] The crafting recipes for Spriggan Sap, Honeycomb, and Candle Lanterns will only appear if you have at least one of the components in your inventory, to help clean up crafting menu clutter. The Troll Fat recipe will continue to display at all times.\r\n\r\nA classic returns! This mod is an add-on for Wearable Lanterns that allows you to pick up and use the [b]1400+ Candle Lanterns[/b] found throughout Skyrim. The Candle Lanterns can also be [b]crafted[/b] by combining Candles (made from honeycomb, spriggan sap, or troll fat), and a Lantern.\r\n\r\nCandle Lanterns burn for 8 minutes* by default before burning out. When it burns out, it will return an empty Lantern to your inventory. You can add more candles to your lantern by clicking Candles in your inventory, provided you have crafted some (see below).\r\n\r\nThe candle lantern was the first incarnation of the primary lantern used in Wearable Lanterns, but was phased out in favor of the oil burning Travel Lantern. I\\'m glad to finally be able to bring it back into the game as a functional item.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b][color=#FBEC5D][size=5]Refilling Your Candle Lantern[/size][/color][/b][/center]\r\n\r\nYou can click on Candles in your inventory to add more candles to an empty lantern while out adventuring. You do not need to use a forge to combine them.\r\n\r\n[center][b][color=#FBEC5D][size=5]Features[/size][/color][/b][/center]\r\n\r\nWhile I strove to make Candle Lanterns of the North as feature-rich as possible, in some cases, not all Wearable Lantern features could be implemented at this time.  Here is a breakdown of features supported by Candle Lanterns:\r\n\r\n[b][color=#FF0000]NO[/color] - Modifiable Brightness\r\n[color=#FF0000]NO[/color] - Dimming\r\n[color=#00FF00]YES[/color] - Drop Lit Lantern\r\n[color=#00FF00]YES[/color] - Auto-Drop (according to setting)\r\n[color=#00FF00]YES[/color]* - Requires fuel\r\n[color=#00FF00]YES[/color]** - Follower Support[/b]\r\n\r\n* You can alter the duration of Candle Lanterns by typing the console command [b]\\\"set CandleLanternDuration to X\\\"[/b], where [b]X[/b] is the number of [b]minutes[/b] you would like your candle lantern to last. A very large number would make your candle lantern\\'s duration effectively unlimited. I opted for a shorter duration by default because of how plentiful these lanterns are throughout Skyrim, and to incentivize using other light sources. Light sources used by followers last forever.\r\n\r\n** Follower support is not as fool-proof as other lanterns in Wearable Lanterns. Ordinarily, Wearable Lanterns actively prevents you from giving your follower more than one lantern. Here, I instead simply print a warning if I see that you have given a Candle Lantern to a follower that already has a lantern or a torch. MAKE SURE to only give your follower ONE LIGHT SOURCE (lantern, torch) to ensure the best behavior.\r\n\r\nFollowers will not automatically put away Candle Lanterns when sneaking.\r\n\r\n[center][b][color=#FBEC5D][size=5]Crafting Recipes[/size][/color][/b][/center]\r\n\r\nThe following crafting recipes have been added to Forges:\r\n\r\n[b]1x Candles - Requires 1x Spriggan Sap\r\n2x Candles - Requires 1x Troll Fat\r\n4x Candles - Requires 1x Honeycomb\r\n\r\n1x Candle Lantern - Requires 1x Candles + 1x Lantern [i](NOTE: You can also combine them by clicking on Candles in your inventory)[/i][/b]\r\n\r\n[center][b][color=#FBEC5D][size=5]Respawning[/size][/color][/b][/center]\r\n\r\nAfter 7 game days, any Candle Lanterns you have taken will respawn, so you don\\'t have to worry about doing permanent damage to the atmosphere of the game just because you wanted to take a lantern. It will also turn back on any lights and effects it turned off when it was taken.\r\n\r\n[center][b][color=#FBEC5D][size=5]How It Works[/size][/color][/b][/center]\r\n\r\nI have used the Find-Replace function of the Creation Kit to replace every candle lantern static object with a new activator that looks exactly the same. This will allow you to pick up the hundreds of Candle Lanterns located in every house, dungeon, city, bandit camp, and everywhere in between.\r\n\r\nWhen you pick up a Candle Lantern, my script tries to find and turn off a nearby light object known to be used by Candle Lanterns. This is done on a best-effort basis and may not always work. For instance, the lights attached to lanterns in most cities will not turn off when you take the lantern, because they have an Enable Parent (for Civil War stuff).\r\n\r\nIt will also attempt to turn off any glow effects that it finds on a best-effort basis.\r\n[center][b][color=#FBEC5D][size=5]Installation[/size][/color][/b][/center]\r\n\r\n[b]PICK ONE:[/b]\r\nRegular Version\r\nDawnguard Version\r\n\r\nUse the version that matches your Wearable Lanterns installation. If you use the No BSA version of Wearable Lanterns, use the No BSA version of Candle Lanterns of the North.\r\n\r\nIf you opt for the No BSA version of Wearable Lanterns and/or Candle Lanterns of the North, you may get a message warning you about overwriting the following files:\r\n\r\n_WL_lampgeneric01.dds\r\n_WL_lampgeneric01_n.dds\r\n\r\nThese are OK to overwrite. They are simply a copy of the lantern textures that are packaged with Wearable Lanterns. For compatibility reasons I needed to redistribute them with this add-on as well.\r\n\r\n[center][b][color=#FBEC5D][size=5]Uninstallation[/size][/color][/b][/center]\r\n\r\nWaiting 8 days to be positive that all light and glow effects are turned back on is probably a good idea.\r\n\r\nAfter that, you should be able to just uninstall it directly. I have tested a save game that had Candle Lanterns of the North installed, I uninstalled it, and when reloading that save game, all of the static lantern objects were right back where they were. Your experience should be the same.\r\n\r\n[center][b][color=#FBEC5D][size=5]Requirements[/size][/color][/b][/center]\r\n\r\n[b]REQUIRES Wearable Lanterns 2.2 or newer.\r\nREQUIRES Skyrim 1.7.7.0 or newer.[/b]\r\n\r\nLoad order should not matter, but it\\'s probably a good idea to load this after Wearable Lanterns.\r\n\r\n[b]DO NOT[/b] use both the Regular and Dawnguard version of this Add-On. Use one or the other.\r\n\r\n[center][b][color=#FBEC5D][size=5]Known Issues[/size][/color][/b][/center]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] I do not forcibly prevent you from giving your follower more than one lantern when one of those lanterns is a Candle Lantern. I do print a warning to the screen.\r\n\r\n[*] Followers will not automatically put away Candle Lanterns when sneaking. I almost don\\'t consider this an issue since it incentivizes using better light sources.\r\n\r\n[*] The timer for the duration for Candle Lanterns is global; by that I mean, the timer does not follow the individual lanterns themselves. If you use a lantern for 6 minutes, and drop it, and get another one, it will not last 8 minutes (by default), it will last 2. The one you dropped (or any other you acquire) will then in turn last another 8 minutes. The timer only runs when you have a Candle Lantern equipped.\r\n\r\n[*] Some lights emitted by Candle Lanterns in the world, when picked up, may not go out. This is especially true in cities. This is normal behavior (see \\\"How It Works\\\", above).\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[center][b][color=#FBEC5D][size=5]Troubleshooting[/size][/color][/b][/center]\r\n\r\n\\\"I equipped a candle lantern, but I played a strange arm animation and/or I teleport somewhere.\\\"\r\n\r\nMy script(s) failed to run OR you do not have Wearable Lanterns 2.2 installed, which is required. Verify that you are using Skyrim version 1.7.7.0 or newer. Also verify that you are not using Script Dragon, which has been known to cause certain events in my mods to fail to trigger. If you continue to experience this behavior (you play a \\\"table pick up\\\" animation when equipping a Candle Lantern), roll back to an earlier save before you installed the Candle Lanterns of the North add-on and try using the No BSA version instead, which has assisted many with script execution problems such as this.\r\n\r\n[center][b][color=#FBEC5D][size=5]Compatibility[/size][/color][/b][/center]\r\n\r\nIncompatible with mods that edit the candle lantern static objects found throughout Skyrim.\r\n\r\n[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://SkyrimGEMS.com/images/badge_featured_sm.png[/img][/url][/center]",
