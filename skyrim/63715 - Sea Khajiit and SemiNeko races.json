  "summary": "Just a Mod of two simple races. I&#39;m aware of a few problems with SemiNeko but I don&#39;t know how to fix them. As Far as I know Sea Khajiit is problem free but it will reset a few of your stats so write them down and fix them with console commands after changing to the Sea Khajiit race&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "Sea Khajiit: This race is basically a Khajiit just it can be either Blue, or a darker black than usual khajiit in the game. However it also has a small boost in starting stats&#33; There is a small boost in health regen, Carryweight is set to 500, health starts at 75, magicka starts at 75 and stamina starts at 75. I made it a little bit shorter than normal races just because I wanted at least a small difference in looks.\r<br />SemiNeko: Well..... This Race is basically a breton body with a khajiit head and tail. There are a few problems with it. You cant change the eye color, can&#39;t give it scars, and can&#39;t give it hair. (I&#39;m so sorry about that, I currently don&#39;t know how to fix it) It has the powers of both the Khajiit and the Breton, it&#39;s health is starting at 75, and carryweight is set to 350.Â ",
