  "descriptionHtml": "For all of you that hate lockpicking and wish it was just gone! This mod completely removes the difficulty of lockpicking after unlocking the Novice Lockpicking perk. What this mod does is it sets the lockpicking multiplier of the Novice perk to 100 instead of 2, therefore the sweet spot is the entire lock and all you have to do is turn the lockpick, not move it around at all.\r\n\r\nIn the picture, the sweet spot of the lock is the blue bar.\r\nPlease note that that bar is not part of my mod, it is another mod called Lockpick Pro that can be found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/219//?\r\nLockpick Pro is not required.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions, I encourage you to post them in the comments because I will be expanding this mod over time.",
