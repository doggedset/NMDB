  "modName": "Ulfric Stormcloak - Allow Shouting",
  "summary": "Have you ever been thinking why Ulfric Stormcloak never used a single dragon shout? Do you want to hear why? Bethesda. That\\'s the answer. Have you ever been thinking why is Ulfric Stormcloak shouting like a master with this mod? Do you want to hear why? Me, Modger99. That\\'s the answer.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my second mod from my \\\"Simple, but useful mods\\\" series, which should be the fastest Skyrim mod ever made. The ONLY thing I have done since I loaded Creation Kit was, that I added Ulfric Stormcloak a perk called \\\"AllowShouting\\\" and teached him \\\"Fire Breath\\\". \r\n\r\nBefore this mod, Ulfric had two shouts: Unrelenting Force and Disarm in his inventory, but he missed a perk allowing him to shout the world apart. Great work once again, Bethesda (applause).\r\n\r\nSo here we are. Even if you see Ulfric in combat only three times in the whole game, this mod is still useful, as you can now see Solitude Guards flying away without completing the Ustengrav quest.",
