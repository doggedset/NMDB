  "descriptionHtml": "This is the beginning work for my teleportation spell.  Once the spell is learned, you can teleport to any of the player homes in the game as well as the inns, taverns, guild halls, sanctuaries, etc,.  \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that you shouldn\\'t teleport to a place you haven\\'t been or do not know, and if you do so you do so at your own risk.  For instance, if you teleport inside a home you do not own you will be locked in since you will not have the key.  You can simply use the console to unlock the door there after or you can teleport to another location to fix this as in all situations.  \r\n\r\nThe main reason for this spell is to move to an interior cell so you can save time (in-game world time vs. fast traveling) as well as being able to quickly get to a location if you\\'re over burdened because you\\'re carrying too much stuff, or if you\\'re close to being killed and would like to get away in a hurry.  Please note that if you DO end up teleporting away from an area that locks you in, you may never be able to get back into that area (without using the console to clip through).  ",
