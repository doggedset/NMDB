  "descriptionHtml": "Nym, The Green Seer\r\nIncluding level 1, 5, & 10 saves.  From level 5 onwards, it includes many \\\"flavor\\\" items, to add character.  A great starter build, enjoy.\r\n\r\nIf you like this save, try my others.  Just type \\\"Archetypes\\\" in the search field.\r\n\r\nPlease leave a comment and/or endorse.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBackground- \r\n\r\n...around a quiet campfire:\r\n\r\nThe firelight flecks in faint streaks across Nym\\'s stern yet statuesque features.  She tears away the last hunk of meat from her kill and tosses the bone to her patient and waiting companion.  The beast snaps the morsel like a twig and sets to work on the sweet marrow within.\r\n\r\nAcross the flames, upon a stump, sits the ill-kept armor and drying skull of a bandit, who Nym takes to talking toward, \\\"It is taught in Valenwood that we should consume only the meats of our kill, and harm not a fibre of any plant under the protection of Y\\'ffre.\\\"  She picks some gristle form her teeth with a fingernail, \\\"yet I consider your kind a weed... have I gone against the pact?\\\".\r\n\r\nHer orange eyes gleam with sudden jubilance, \\\"no, no... this forsaken wilderness is not of Y\\'ffre, not any more.  I will bring his ways, though.  I will heal where there has been harm.  And it begins with you.\\\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCharacter traits:\r\n\r\nNym is an adherent of the Green Pact, and as such, may be reticent to chop wood, or harvest plants.  However, she has no qualms with the hunt, and will utilize blood and bone... fire and stone.  She is not concerned with the future, nor the past, as her\\'s is the god of \\\"the now\\\".\r\n\r\nWhile the Green Pact only seems to apply to the forests of Valenwood, she probably won\\'t be used to harvesting plants, so alchemy is out.  However, like most Bosmer-- she will happily use the forestry/flora derived products of others.\r\n\r\n",
