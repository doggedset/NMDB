To know if it worked or not they sure be marked with a green aura glow symbol on their body, I havent tested it out filly but i should work.. \r<br />\r<br />Earth Mother Spriggan Comes with a Dark Spriggan Spray and the Burnt Spriggans comes with a normal firebolt.\r<br />\r<br />Both are resisted to poison by 100% and are resisted to damage by 50 points. Burnt is weak to frost by 25%\r<br />\r<br />They also will have voices when attacking, getting hit and dying so it wont be silence.",
