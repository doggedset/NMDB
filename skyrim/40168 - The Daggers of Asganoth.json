It is extremely effective against the undead and was used by the the tribes of the Lost City to mutilate their corpses, in hopes that they did not return. \r\n\r\n\\'Lungahrot\\', the Blade of Leeches can be found in an Orcish loot chest in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary dining hall or an Orcish loot chest in the Ragged Flaggon. It was used by the shaman of the falmer tribes to sacrifice the old and frail, as to please their gods. \r\n\r\nEach dagger has a beautiful custom retexture and special abilities.
