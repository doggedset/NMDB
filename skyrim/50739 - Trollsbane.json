  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a warhammer that much like the name suggests, is effective against trolls. After all, the head of the weapon is a trolls skull. Trollsbane can be found in the bandit leader chest inside Halted Stream Camp, just north of Whiterun. The weapon is leveled, so the damage and strength of the enchantment will vary. The weapon can be upgraded with bone meal. \r<br />\r<br />I thought of doing a set of &#34;Barbarian&#34; weapons, and this was basically the test weapon.\r<br />\r<br />*Note: If you&#39;ve recently been in Halted Stream Camp and killed the bandits, I would suggest waiting until they respawn to get Trollbane.
