  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][b][center]CGR&#39;s Ethereal Night Sky[/center][/b][/size]Update: 11/2/16 -- I will not be installing the special edition of skyrim as I&#39;ve been unimpressed with the screenshots and I don&#39;t want to take the risk of corrupting my save files.  However if the filepaths and filenames are still the same, then there is no reason why my retextures won&#39;t work&#33;  If you have problems let me know, or if the filepaths are different and you know what they are, let me know that too.  (Also if you have the special edition and this still works for you, I&#39;d like to know that too&#33;)  Thanks everyone&#33;  :)\r<br /> \r<br />------\r<br />\r<br /> [size=4]Lore states that the stars are holes in the envelope surrounding the planets that allows Atherius to shine through, but vanilla sky was filled with small tiny stars that were barely visible.  There are a lot of high density starfield retextures out there, but I wanted something that made me believe the power and light of Aetherius was shining down on me, so I created this.\r<br /> \r<br /> This mod is meant to make you feel small and insiginifigant as you travel around at night.  It&#39;s meant to make you say &#34;WOW&#34; and want to stand and stare at the night sky all night. It was created from several of NASA&#39;s photos from the Hubble telescope (they fall under public domain) lovingly stitched together and manipulated by me.  It went through several incarnations and testing phases before it settled on this. [/size]\r<br />[size=4][b] \r<br /> [size=5]What does this mod do?[/size][/b]\r<br /> \r<br /> CGR&#39;s Ethereal Night Sky is a quality retexture of the starfield and nova for Skyrim.  [size=4]This mod only changes the skystars.dds and skyrimgalaxy.dds files.  These are the starfield and the arm of the galaxy/nova that appears in the sky. \r<br /> [/size]\r<br /> \r<br /> [size=5][b]This mod is NOT:[/b][/size]\r<br /> \r<br />  It does NOT affect the position, movement, or appearance of the constellations.  There are retextures of the constellations available, I use [url=http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fmods%2F55613&t=N2NjMmE4OThhZTA3ZTBhZjViOGRkYWRmN2E0MDljMTFkNTBjM2ZmMCxLRWpDVHFKeg%3D%3D]Skygazer - Constellations HD 2K (with nebulae)[/url].\r<br /> \r<br />[size=5][b] Does it conflict with other mods?[/b][/size]\r<br /> \r<br /> This is a simple retexture and as such should not be affected by any other mods.  It will only &#34;conflict&#34; with other retextures of the same two files, so if a mod affects those, then you may not see my textures.  Mods that change colours or saturation may alter the way that it appears, however.\r<br /> \r<br /> Confirmed to be working with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17802/]Climates of Tamriel[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22274/?]Predator Vision[/url], see screenshots for how it looks under the different visions added by that mod. I run [url=http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fmods%2F32064&t=NTBkZDRiN2U2M2Q1ZGUxNzNkNTg5YWJlZjI1NWY3NTAxMzhkOTc0MCxLRWpDVHFKeg%3D%3D]Immersive Saturation Boost[/url] so the colours you see in my screenshots are what it looks like with that mod.\r<br /> \r<br /> [size=5][b]Please note:[/b][/size]\r<br /> \r<br /> There is a seam in the sky, but it is not really that noticable because I spent two days adjusting the texture so none of the big bright stars were cut off. That was the best I could do, since the seam cuts the textures in half no matter what size they are.  The screenshots do have the seam in some of them so as you can see it&#39;s not that noticable unless you know what you&#39;re looking for (or the big stars are cut in half).\r<br /> \r<br /> [size=5][b]Reccomended mods to go with:[/b][/size]\r<br />  [/size]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=4][url=http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fmods%2F55613&t=N2NjMmE4OThhZTA3ZTBhZjViOGRkYWRmN2E0MDljMTFkNTBjM2ZmMCxLRWpDVHFKeg%3D%3D]Skygazer - Constellations HD 2K (with nebulae)[/url] to retexture the constellations[/size]\r<br />[*][size=4][url=http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fmods%2F30272&t=NTgxMWMzOTI4MDAzODlhZGI2MDg4YTg0ZTQ0N2Y3MjIzYTIxYWQxYSxLRWpDVHFKeg%3D%3D]Insanitys Moons[/url] to retexture the moons[/size]\r<br />[*][size=4][url=http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fmods%2F53971%2F&t=NDFjNTc3MzRjNWEzNDFlNWNkYmMyMzJlNDBiZmZiMTIwZjViMDVkMyxLRWpDVHFKeg%3D%3D]AURORA [/url]to retexture and remesh the auroras[/size]\r<br />[*][size=4][url=http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fmods%2F56279&t=YTA5YWNkYjRlNTRjNDg5MmMwODY2OTc4OTJkYjFjNzY4NmY2YTUxOSxLRWpDVHFKeg%3D%3D]Ethereal Clouds[/url] to retexture the clouds[/size]\r<br />[*][size=4][url=http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fmods%2F56877%2F&t=MDU4NzZiMmQ4NTk0MTJhOTk2YmU5ZWIyNWNiZmY3ZTY0NmIyNTAxMixLRWpDVHFKeg%3D%3D]Skysight - Simply Bigger Trees[/url] to make the trees bigger, and my intended effect of feeling insignifigant and tiny more pronounced[/size]\r<br />[/list][size=4]\r<br /> [b][size=5]How to install:[/size][/b]\r<br /> \r<br /> [/size][list=1]\r<br />[*][size=4]unzip the folder[/size]\r<br />[*][size=4]drop the textures folder into your data folder[/size]\r<br />[*][size=4]if prompted, select to overwrite old files[/size]\r<br />[*][size=4]boot up skyrim and enjoy&#33;[/size]\r<br />[/list][size=4]\r<br /> [b][size=5]How to uninstall:[/size][/b]\r<br /> \r<br />[/size][list]\r<br />[*][size=4]delete the skystars.dds and skyrimgalaxy.dds files from data&gt;textures&gt;sky[/size]\r<br />[/list][size=4]\r<br /> \r<br />[size=5][b] Special Thanks:[/b][/size]\r<br /> \r<br /> My alpha tester, you rock my socks.\r<br /> My beta testers, you know who you are. :)\r<br /> Bethesda for Skyrim\r<br /> NASA for space\r<br /> My mom for encouraging my creativity\r<br /> The modding community for being awesome :)\r<br /> \r<br /> If anyone has any issues or problems please contact me.  [/size]\r<br /> ",
