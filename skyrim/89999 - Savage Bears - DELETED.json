This replaces all vanilla bears in game[/size]\n<br />\n<br />   If you're like me and have been disappointed in the vanilla bears of Skyrim then this mod is for you.   [size=3]After comparing lots of pics, paintings and sculptures, of different bears, and working in the confines of the vanilla mesh, I softened most of the hard edges and enlarged the torso and back of the vanilla mesh, to give it a more realistic, ferocious and savage appearance.   These are the savage bears I've always wanted to see in the game. [/size]\n<br />[size=3]Hope you like them as much as I do.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]This is my first mod and [/size]I'm open to any feedback or constructive criticism, but keep in mind that I have a full time career and I'm in college part time, so it maybe a while before I can respond to any questions or comments. Please be patient with any questions or concerns and I will respond as soon as I can.\n<br />Thank you[/center][center]﻿[color=#00ffff]\n<br />[/color][/center][center][size=4][b][color=#00ffff][Mod Compatibility][/color]\n<br />[/b][/size][size=3]Should be fully compatible with any texture mods for bears.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]Will be coming to Skyrim Special Edition Soon!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff][Recommended Mods][/color]\n<br />[size=4][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86559]Better Bears[/url]﻿[/size][size=3][color=#1e84cc] [/color][color=#ffffff]by [/color][/size][/b][size=3]aviform[/size]\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />[/size][color=#00ffff][size=4][b][Installation]\n<br />[/b][/size][/color][size=3]Recommend using Nexus Mod Manager \n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/center][center]﻿[/center]",
