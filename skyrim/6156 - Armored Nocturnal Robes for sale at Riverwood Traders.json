  "descriptionHtml": "\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]\r\nSmall amendment >> make sure that you already have the variant (textures & meshes) that you want to use before activating this esp. I\\'ll tell you why, when I rebuilt it and tested it to make sure that it worked, it was with just the default game textures & meshes, after I made sure that it was being sold at Lucan\\'s, I put my preferred model back into my game. After I did that every time I approached the Riverwood Trader cell I would ctd ... to fix it I had to open SkyEdit and \\\"update\\\" my files so that it would point toward the new files I added so it\\'s saved in memory. \r\n\r\nNOW FOR SALE AT LUCAN\\'S RIVERWOOD TRADING POST\r\n\r\nTHIS IS AN ADD-ON USING THE DEFAULT NOCTURNAL ROBE MODEL ... so whatever body texture/mesh combo you are using it will work ... also whatever Nocturnal Robe mod you use will work ... it is up to you to decide on the variant you want. The only new thing this mod does is make the robe \\\"armored\\\".\r\n\r\naddy for 1st person fix\r\n\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3727\r\n\r\nthere was another fix named \\\"1st_Person_View_fix_by_TomMalufe\\\" but I can seem to locate it!\r\n\r\nAnd for all of you that don\\'t know the Default Nocturnal Robe was never meant to be playable.\r\n\r\nIt was brought out into the light by all of the wonderful modders in this and probably other modding hubs.\r\n\r\nInstallation is just drop the armored nocturnal robes.esp into your Data folder then make sure you activate it for it to work.
