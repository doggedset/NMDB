  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]Description[/b][/u]\r\nMakes the Gauldur Amulet much more powerful by increasing the amount of health, stamina and magicka received when wearing it. The legend says that it is so powerful that it made the three brothers mad and killed their father to get it, and that they used the amulet to become really powerful. I felt that 30+ in each attribute was a bit weak, so I increased it. Once the CK is out, I\\'ll find other ways to make it true to the legend!\r\n\r\n[b]There are two versions available:[/b]\r\nLegendary Gauldur Amulet: Increases the attribute gain by 100.\r\nSlightly Legendary Gauldur Amulet: Increases the attribute gain by 50.\r\n\r\n\\\"Long ago, the Archmage Gauldur was murdered by his three sons, who stole his amulet of power and divided it among themselves. Once the three sons divided the amulet among themselves they began on a rampage around Skyrim. This attracted the attention of the High King of Skyrim. So the king sent a group of battlemages to kill the three sons.\\\"\r\n\r\n[b][u]Installation[/b][/u]\r\nExtract to your Skyrim Data folder. (...\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim)",
