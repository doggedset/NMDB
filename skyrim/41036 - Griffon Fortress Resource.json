You\\'ll find approximately 107 meshes in this resource, which is comprised of castle walls, towers, interior walls, pedestals, and a griffon statue. Since the stairs were designed for Oblivion characters, you may need to use collision planes for NPC\\'s to use them smoothly. You can find the original file below. \r\n\r\nGriffon Fortress: http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/14830/?\r\n\r\n=========================\r\nTools Used\r\n=========================\r\nNifskope\r\nNifUtils by Skyfox\r\n3DS Max\r\n\r\n=================\r\nPermissions:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis is a modders resource.You may use the meshes for your own mods as long as you give credit and you do not charge money for it.\r\n\r\nDo not upload to other sites without express permission. \r\nmr_siika has been away from modding for quite some time, and will likely not return to the forums. Deeza was originally granted permission to port the assets featured in this resource, and it is on his behalf that I converted these. Should anyone have further questions, feel free to private message me. Be sure to check out the Beyond Skyrim project where this resource will be utilized, at Dark Creations. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.darkcreations.org/forums/forum/119-beyond-skyrim/\r\n\r\n=================\r\nCredits:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nmr_siika for his resources and for everything he has given to the TES community!
