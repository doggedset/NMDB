  "summary": "Crops are owned - taking crops is stealing.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wonder why no one in Skyrim cares if you steal their crops? Well I did, and I decided to do something about it. This isn\\'t the fertile Niben Valley. This is harsh, desolate Skyrim. Those farmers depend on their crops for their livelihoods, and to sustain them through the long, brutal Skyrim winter. Do you think they\\'re just going to sit around and gawk while some milk-drinker strolls along, harvests all their crops, and walks off with them? Of course not!\r\n\r\nNow crops are owned. Taking them is stealing. You get a fine of about 1 gp per crop stolen, assuming you get caught of course. As a side-effect, crops no longer sway in the breeze. I don\\'t think I\\'ll notice or care. (This is because Skyrim considers them \\\"trees\\\", and trees don\\'t have ownership, so I had to replace them with a new, different \\\"flora\\\" object that just looks the same. Only trees sway in the breeze - flora (mostly mushrooms) do not.)\r\n\r\nThe main things I changed are crops (wheat, potato plants, cabbages, leeks, and gourd clusters), and also dead fish and chicken nests. I didn\\'t change flowers; I thought about it because some flowers are worth a lot of money (and also deadly), but very few flowers look like they were planted on purpose, even the ones in cities. I also didn\\'t set ownership on the random gourd cluster plopped down somewhere all by its lonesome; only the ones near others, in what is clearly a garden/crop field. Let me know if I missed anything, which I probably did.\r\n\r\nI also set ownership for some food barrels and sacks around various farms/inns, etc.\r\n\r\nIn OCD-like fashion, I scrolled through the entire list of exterior cells, with a filter set, to make sure there wasn\\'t a crop field anywhere in the game I was missing. I\\'m pretty sure I got them all now. They only ones I excluded were ones outside dungeons, abandoned shacks, etc. So I think the only crops I may have possibly missed would have to be unorthodox crops like nirnroot or snowberries or whatever. Therefore, as I\\'m fairly confident my original intent is finally complete, I dub this v2. There may be a few missed things here and there, and I may continue to do containers and food barrels, but I have no firm commitment to being as thorough about that as I was with crops.\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t change anything with the dialogue where certain people will offer to pay you money for crops. Because I don\\'t really care about that. Presumably, you can still sell them crops that you got somehow, but maybe not stolen crops. I\\'m not sure. If being a freelance field hand is a vital part of your Skyrim experience, maybe this mod isn\\'t for you.\r\n\r\nInstallation: It\\'s just an esp. Figure it out.\r\n\r\nPermissions: It\\'s a fairly simple series of CK changes. Do what you want with it. Give me credit, I guess. It did take me a whole several hours.",
