  "descriptionHtml": "PROUDSPIRE MANOR BUG FIXES.ESP\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nA simple mod that fixes bugs with Proudspire Manor. This is not an overhaul mod, so it does not change the design in any way. Fixes the housecarl bedroom, bed ownership (spouses should no longer sleep in the basement), weapon racks, duplicate chairs, flickering texture issues, and more. See below for details.\r\n\r\nREGARDING THE 1.5 RELEASE\r\nThis mod *has* been tested with the 1.5 release, and everything appears to work correctly (even the downstairs weapon racks). I do plan to update the mod to back out my downstairs weapon rack fix, leaving Bethesda\\'s fix as the default, but I cannot do that yet as there appears to be some compatibility issues with the current version of the Creation Kit.\r\n\r\nBUG FIXES\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3\r\n\r\n1. Housecarl bedroom fix changed to be consistent with how housecarl bedrooms are awarded in other houses. Now the housecarl bedroom will be upgraded when the player becomes Thane of Haafingar (Solitude). Players who are already thane simply need to exit and then re-enter Proudspire Manor in order to trigger the bedroom upgrade. IMPORTANT: See Release Note #1 if you need to retrieve items from the bedroom due to this change!\r\n\r\n[Note: Thanks to Blakrajder from the Skyrim Nexus, who discovered the proper solution and provided the fix.]\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2\r\n\r\n1. Fixed flickering textures in player bedroom, stairwell.\r\n2. Door to patio now requires the Proudspire Manor key rather than the Solitude Fletcher key.\r\n3. Fixed weapon rack in the basement so that players can place weapons in any of the five slots. The rack may still not let you add five large two-handed weapons (such as bows), but this is something common to all weapon racks (prevents weapon model clipping).\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n\r\n1. Fixed duplicate chairs in the dining area next to the player bedroom. Only noble chairs appear after upgrading.\r\n2. Fixed backwards chest in player bedroom.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n\r\n1. Housecarl bedroom in the basement now displays as designed when the player purchases the Bedroom upgrade (see screenshot above).\r\n2. Housecarl bed ownership now set properly. Spouses should no longer sleep in the basement.\r\n3. Eliminated flickering textures on the wall next to the mannequins in the basement.\r\n4. Cobwebs in the basement no longer display after upgrades are purchased.\r\n5. Straw piles in the basement no longer display after upgrades are purchased (no more floating straw piles).\r\n6. Moved lavender on the alchemy table in the basement so it spawns in a better place if you have Crafting Satchels installed.\r\n\r\n!!! WARNING !!!\r\nIf you are storing anything in the barrels or bags in the housecarl room in the basement, remove those items and save your game before installing this mod. The furniture in that room will change if you have purchased the Bedroom upgrade, and once it does you will lose any items stored there.\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY\r\nTested with Crafting Satchels, Dovahkiin Hideout, and Proudspire Manor Expansion - Armor and Weapon Displays. May be incompatible with other Proudspire Manor overhaul mods.\r\n\r\nUPDATES\r\nBug fix requests are welcome. I plan to update this mod as necessary.\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\nThanks to Blakrajder of the Skyrim Nexus for discovering the proper fix for the housecarl bedroom, and for providing the fix. If you are a Nexus user, please send him a kudos.\r\n\r\nRELEASE NOTES\r\n\r\n1. IMPORTANT!! Remove any items you are storing in containers in the housecarl bedroom and save your game before installing this update! If you were not able to do that, DO NOT PANIC! You can retrieve items stored in the bedroom by re-installing version 1.2.1 of the mod from http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=31377. After you install this version, load up your most recent save game, remove the items from the housecarl bedroom, save your game, and then upgrade the mod again. \r\n\r\n2. There are two small flickering textures at the top of the stairs if you look up at the roof, but I cannot fix these because they are a bug within a single mesh (SMdAStaSol02) and are not the result of two items overlapping.\r\n\r\n3. There are also two small flickering textures at the bottom of the stairs that I cannot fix because they are a result of textures snapping together which I cannot move without creating holes in the environment.\r\n\r\n4. Investigating whether or not the CK will allow me to fix the problem of items placed by the player scattering when entering the manor. So far I have been unable to find a way to prevent this from happening; it may require a fix from Bethesda. However, if any of you can help to fix this problem, I would gladly make any required change(s) and give you credit for the fix.\r\n\r\n5. Investigating the possibility of modifying the default AI package for Jordis the Sword-maiden so that she will use the housecarl bedroom in the basement.",
