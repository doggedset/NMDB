  "descriptionHtml": "Hello there guys and girls, welcome to Egruel\\'s Magic part 1!\r\n\r\nTo start this mod you will need to go to the Drunken Huntsman. Once you are there you will find a book and a key on a table where the vendor/salesman sells his goods, take both and read the book, you are on your way to your journey.\r\n\r\nEgruel Fien is a unique mage, a wood elf not really accepted by his brothers and sisters. He is probably dead when you find the book as he scheduled the book to be sent to skyrim around 150 years later after he wrote it.\r\n\r\nThese spells range from summoning a chicken the a huge fire explosion to summoning a giant.\r\n\r\nSpell List:\r\nConjure Chicken\r\nStreams of Ice Spikes\r\nEgruel\\'s Arrows\r\nSteam Spray\r\nBlerrasm ( Lets you cast destruction spells with no cost for 10 seconds )\r\nIgnition ( Fire Explosion )\r\nIcy Thrust ( Push Back and Frost damage )\r\nShock Fu ( Lightning that looks like it came from the skies in your hands )\r\nConjure Hagraven\r\nIced Bodies ( Freezes people within a distance of where you hit the spell at )\r\nCooling Blast ( Blast of cold )\r\nConjure Giant\r\nConjure ??? ( This is a surprise, you will see ;) )\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\nWith the spell \\\"Egruel\\'s Arrows\\\", when you pick up an arrow created from the spell, you will get a CTD, As far as I know there is no fix for this so you just shouldn\\'t pick up the arrows.\r\n\r\nWell, go and have fun! Please endorse if you like this mod!",
