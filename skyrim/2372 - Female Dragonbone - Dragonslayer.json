  "descriptionHtml": "First attempt at modding anything. This is a retexture of the female dragonbone plate armor. The main changes are replacing the leather textures with dragon skin, in an attempt to portray a more accurate version of armor made from the carcass of a dragon.\r\n\r\nI will update with the rest of the armor i.e. helmet, gauntlets and boots.\r\n\r\nI have included two versions of the armor. The only difference is the color of the metal braces for the armor. I wanted the armor that requires 100 smithing to be fashioned out of something better than pot iron, so I recolored the metal to look more like dwarven metal. Not everyone will share my preference, and if you like the rest of the retexture but not the metal color you have the alternate version in the file. \r\n\r\nThere is also a highlight on the dragon script on the armband. Until a new NifSkope version or the creation kit releases, I can\\'t find a way to add a glow map to this model, so the highlighted script is a stand-in.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is only the female armor, since it\\'s my first try and I am playing a female character in Skyrim currently. I can complete the set with the male armor as well, but only if there is enough interest.\r\n\r\nCredit to Sarahb360 for the dragon textures I used for the patchwork dragon textures in my retexture. If Sarahb360 wants me to remove them from these files, please let me know and I will immediately.\r\n\r\nInstall: drop the folder into your skyrim/data folder.\r\nUninstall : delete skyrim/data/textures/armor/dragonbone/dragonbonearmorf.dds",
