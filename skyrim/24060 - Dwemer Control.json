  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i47.tinypic.com/24q7382.jpg[/img]\r\n[u]Description:[/u]\r\nDwemer Control is a mod that allows you bring new dwemer followers to life each with a different purpose ranging from: Combat to Utility.\r\n\r\nSpiders are able to be made after finding \\\"Aicantar’s Diary\\\" and \\\"A Scholar\\'s Journal\\\". To activate the spider you can either use the Quick Summon power or you place it on the ground and then deploy it.\r\n\r\nThe spiders have been sorted into three different categories:\r\n[u]Combat:[/u] These automation\\'s are the most straight forward but least versatile.\r\nBasic – A abnormal spider that has decided that you are its master.\r\nAdvanced – A magically enacted spider, resistant to weapons and with sharper claws.\r\nMicro-Centurion – The pinnacle of hand to hand fighting, these Micro-Centurion\\'s are more than a match for giants and their larger cousins.\r\n\r\n[u]Magic:[/u] After careful experimenting Aincantar has discovered spider imbued with  powerful magic attacks and cloaks. There is one for each of the styles of destruction magic: Fire, Frost and Shock.\r\n\r\n[u]Other:[/u] There have been a few unusual spiders created, nobody is sure if they were created by the long lost dwarves. \r\nStealth: An unholy cesspool of magic resulted in a silent poison spewing spider \r\nAnti-Mage: Nobody is sure how it came to be or its true potential but one thing is certain. Mage\\'s run!\r\nWabbajack: The mad god certainly had a little bit of fun or maybe you are just crazy.\r\n\r\n[u]Planned Features:[/u]\r\nRework the stealth spider into a \\'skill booster\\' and a poison spider\r\nAdd spiders that boost the players skills\r\nAdd a system to give the automation\\'s boosts (health, speed, combat healing etc.)\r\nNew MicroCenturion:\r\nDwarven Overlord\r\nStorage Spider\r\n\r\n[u]Version Notes[/u]\r\n.4 Release notes:\r\n\r\nBug Fixes:\r\nActually removed Breton for Whiterun\r\nCorrected a few recipes\r\nCorrected core names\r\nFixed the activate script giving players the wrong cores\r\n\r\nAdditions:\r\nNew quick summon spell (and select)\r\nNew activation menu\\'s for the spider (Pick-up, give item, nothing.)\r\nNew activation menu for the cores (if you still use em :p)\r\nLaid the groundwork for a new \\'power up\\' system.\r\nCompatibility with Gulogulo\\'s Nature of the Beast II follower commands\r\nMechanical Healing spell (and tome)\r\nBase spells and books are auto added\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherNotes:\r\nCode has been cleaned up, d irty refernces removed, unused code removed etc.\r\nI know that the fire and frost spiders aren\\'t working correctly. It is something Bethesda has done in a recent update :/\r\n\r\n[u]Installing:[/u]\r\nMerge into your data folder or download with NMM\r\n\r\n[u]Uninstalling:[/u]\r\nUninstall with NMM or just delete the DwemerControl files\r\n\r\n[u]Notes:[/u]\r\nThis mod is intended to be compatible with  Gulogulo\\'s Nature of the Beast II(as of .4), it shouldn\\'t interfere with anything else.\r\nBig thank you to Ducey for helping me along with the basic development!\r\n\r\nI need someone to do some modeling for me. Send me a message if interested.\r\n\r\nI also work on TAGamingMaxed\\'s Imperial Ranger Corps \r\n[u]Credit:[/u]\r\nWickeworks: Aicantar’s Diary and A Scholar\\'s Journal \r\n\r\n“I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success....Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.” - Nikola Tesla.",
