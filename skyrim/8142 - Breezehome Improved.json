  "summary": "Adds chests, crafting tools, weapon plaques and much more, which in turn makes Breezehome a more efficient home.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=\\\"#FF8C00\\\"]Description:[/color]\r\n\r\nThis mod improves numerous aspects of Breezehome, found in Whiterun. I\\'ve added numerous chests, a full crafting station featuring all the necessary tools for a blacksmith and more weapon plaques. Certain elements of the layout found in Breezehome have also been rearranged, such as a more apparent kitchen space. The home also received some decorative elements. This is not a total conversion mod as I am sticking with the general theme and price value of the home. It only increases efficiency of the home.\r\n\r\nIt also includes a small fix with the lighting and shadows near the fireplace.\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#FF8C00\\\"]READ THIS IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO LOSE YOUR BOOKS: Before installing remove all the books you have in the bookshelf that is near the large fireplace at the entrance of your home. A small bug with the CK forced me to recreate the bookshelf. \r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading to 1.0 remove the books as well as the bookshelf is still being replaced.\r\n\r\nIf you did not READ THIS AT FIRST and are furiously trying to write up a comment on how your books are frozen, WORRY NOT. Simply deactivate the mod and go back in game and remove the books and activate the mod after that.\r\n[/color]\r\n[color=\\\"#FF8C00\\\"]READ THIS IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO LOSE YOUR POTATOES: Before installing remove any items you have in the Cupboard at the north end of the house, since the Cupboard is re-positioned to make room for the crafting tools. You can store your items back in the Cupboard once you installed the mod.\r\n\r\nEverything else is safe to handle with.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#FF8C00\\\"]Features:[/color]\r\n\r\n- Increased number of chests\r\n- Increased number of weapon plaques\r\n- Increased number of weapon racks\r\n- Increased number of bookshelves (you can store up to 72 more books now)\r\n- Increased number of other storage (barrels, sacks, a safe, jewelry box)\r\n- Crafting tools (grindstone, anvil, tanner, workbench)\r\n- Enchanting Table (comes with a snazzy rug!)\r\n- Weapon display cases\r\n- Slightly modified layout (the cupboard replaces useless shelves and actually creates a visible kitchen area at the entrance)\r\n- Small decorations (like a big mounted bear head for you hunters out there!)\r\n- Fixed shadows and lighting near fireplace area\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#FF8C00\\\"]Compatibility:[/color]\r\n\r\nIs not compatible with any mods that changes the layout/adds items/removes items from Breezehome. It is however compatible with the Dovahkiin\\'s Hideout trap door under the stairs.\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#FF8C00\\\"]Installing:[/color]\r\n\r\nSimply place the \\\".esp\\\" file into your /Data folder and check it in your Skyrim launcher when you launch the game. Please read the description regarding your items in the cupboard and bookshelves if you haven\\'t yet! You should also most likely have Breezehome fully furnished and upgraded before installing the mod.\r\n\r\nIf the weapon plaques or anything isn\\'t displaying a prompt, exit and re-enter your house and it will work.\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#FF8C00\\\"]Uninstalling:[/color]\r\n\r\nBefore removing the \\\".esp\\\" file from your /Data folder please remove everything from the newly added storage items (cases, chests, bookshelves) in your house. Disable the \\\".esp\\\" in the Skyrim launcher and delete the \\\".esp\\\" afterwards.\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#FF8C00\\\"]Author\\'s Notes:[/color]\r\n\r\nIf there are any issues do tell in the comments section, as well as any suggestions or general feedback. The mod is complete and I might update it later on based off feedback. Perhaps the next stage should be improving outside of the house? Who knows!\r\n\r\nThank you for viewing and downloading my mod! Really appreciate it as well as any endorsements!\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#FF8C00\\\"]Change Log:[/color]\r\n\r\n1.0\r\n\r\n- Added display cases\r\n- Added bookshelves\r\n- Replaced with a more fitting bed\r\n- Decorated Alchemy/Enchanting room\r\n\r\n0.6\r\n\r\n- Added Enchanting Table and Enchanter\\'s Satchel\r\n- Moved Grindstone to support Dovahkiin\\'s Hideout\r\n- Added Safe near Alchemy/Enchanting station\r\n- Added Jewelry Box in bedroom\r\n\r\n0.5\r\n\r\n- Increased number of chests\r\n- Increased number of weapon plaques\r\n- Increased number of other storage (barrels, sacks)\r\n- Crafting tools (grindstone, anvil, tanner, workbench)\r\n- Slightly modified layout (the cupboard replaces useless shelves and actually creates a visible kitchen area)\r\n\r\n",
