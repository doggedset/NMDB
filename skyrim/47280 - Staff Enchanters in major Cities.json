  "descriptionHtml": "In short only Major cities house staff crafting tables, these aren't placed in any of the players homes vanilla/Hearthfire/Dawnguard, this about minimal convenience.  They do not sell Heartstones you have to gather them yourself. \r\n\r\nThis mod is open to anyone edit it how you like, I made it for myself because I didn't want to have to steep so deep into the Main Quest just so I could make a staff. I'm just sharing it.  \r\n",
