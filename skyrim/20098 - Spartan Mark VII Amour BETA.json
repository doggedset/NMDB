I only released this because enough of you requested to atleast try ti while  figure out how to make it work right. So do enjoy.\r\n\r\nOh and to all those \\'Lore Purists\\'. I understand that you like to keep thing Lore-Friendly. This, obviously, does not fit into that. However, if you don\\'t like it. Then Bugger Off. You don\\'t have the right to judge what people want to put in there game. You don\\'t have to like it, sure. But if there are people who like this, then so be it. Don\\'t fill my comments section with hate towards it.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\nForgot to say this.\r\n\r\nTo get it in-game, you have to open the console and type \\'help mjolnir 0\\'\r\n\r\nThen type player.additem [insert armour code here] 1",
