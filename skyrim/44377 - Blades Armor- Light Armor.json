  "modName": "Blades Armor- Light Armor",
  "summary": "Took the Blades armor and turned it into light armor",
  "descriptionHtml": "If you\\\\\\'re like me and you enjoy wearing the Blades Armor, but your heavy armor skill is at around 70 and your light armor skill at 30, well then this mod will suit your needs. \r\n\r\nI simply took the normal Blades armor and changed it to light armor, so it SHOULD raise your skill. (If it doesn\\\\\\'t, let me know, I haven\\\\\\'t actually gone into battle while wearing it yet)\r\nIt has all the same stats as the Glass armor, in terms of weight and armor effect, so the set isn\\\\\\'t worth as much protection as the heavy set, as to be expected.\r\nYou can find 5 complete sets of Blades light armor in Sky Haven Temple, in the chest in the room directly across from Alduin\\\\\\'s Wall. I\\\\\\'ve also added a few extra sets of heavy Blades armor, in case you wanted to compare, or wanted some for your follower, or whatever, etc. \r\n\r\nThe Light Blades Armor is also craftable at smithing forges, after you have the \\\\\\\"Steel Smithing\\\\\\\" perk, and can be found under the \\\\\\\"Misc\\\\\\\" category, in case you\\\\\\'re somewhere like Riften and don\\\\\\'t feel like going all the way to Sky Haven Temple, you can also craft it. \r\n\r\nI think that\\\\\\'s all, if you run into any bugs or some sort of problem let me know and I\\\\\\'ll fix it. \r\n\r\nI can easily make simple mods like this, so feel free to make requests!\r\n\r\nThe pictures used here are my own screenshots and so the armor rating may vary depending on your skill!",
