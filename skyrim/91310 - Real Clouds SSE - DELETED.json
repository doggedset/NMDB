This mod also adds 3d lightning strikes both \n<br />up close and in the distance.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/vDQN5Fcl.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=============================================\n<br />[size=4]-Details-[/size]\n<br />=============================================\n<br />\n<br />This pretty much does what it says on the tin.\n<br /> These clouds are real 3D objects which will react to the current weather. \n<br />You can touch them, fly through them, fly over them, fly under them, drink them when they rain on you \n<br />(you can see rain in the distance)\n<br />....THE SKY'S THE LIMIT :D\n<br />\n<br />Clouds are controlled by a script which will give the cloud layer a random \n<br />height and coverage based on the current weather type. There are also \n<br />chances of 'extreme' events, such as 100% coverage at a low height, \n<br />or even no clouds at all. \n<br />In addition to regular clouds, you will also encounter rain clouds which dump their load off in the distance.\n<br /> Rain clouds also double as fog at close distances as the rain effect \n<br />can look like fog up close. Realistic lightning has also been added both\n<br /> up close and in the distance. \n<br />\n<br />[size=3][u]Features:[/u][/size]\n<br />• Pseudo-volumetric clouds •\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />• Distant rain effects •\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />• Clouds react to weather, (low dense coverage during fog/rain/snow, sparse high coverage for clear weather) •\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />• Random variation to cloud coverage and altitude to maximize weather diversity •\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />• Blends perfectly with Skyrim's already existing cloud and sky textures. •\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />• 'In cloud' camera effects. •\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />• full compatibility with pretty much everything (including other weather mods) •\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />• Real 3d distant and close up lightning •\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />• And all this with no noticeable performance hit! :D •\n<br />\n<br />Please feel free to leave any comments suggestions or questions in the comments.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/dlx2fIGl.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />=============================================\n<br />[size=4]-Install-[/size]\n<br />=============================================\n<br />\n<br />1. Extract the files to a temporary location.\n<br />\n<br />2. Copy files to Skyrim Special Edition folder\n<br />\n<br />3. Use your favorite mod-manager or the in-game mods tab and check \"RealClouds.esp\"\n<br />\n<br />4. Play the game :)\n<br />\n<br />=============================================\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]-Uninstall-[/size]\n<br />\n<br />=============================================\n<br />\n<br />1. Un-check \"RealClouds.esp\" in a mod-manager or the in-game mods tab.\n<br />\n<br />2. Delete Real Clouds.esp and all the files related to this mod\n<br />\n<br />=============================================\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]-Updating to a New Version-[/size]\n<br />=============================================\n<br />\n<br />1. Uninstall the old version.\n<br />\n<br />2. Install the new version.\n<br />\n<br />3. Start the Game :D \n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/WsHgMtCl.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=============================================\n<br />[size=4]-Compatibility-[/size]\n<br />=============================================\n<br />\n<br />Other Mods:\n<br />This is compatible with pretty much everything. Even other weather mods, \n<br />this will not replace or overwrite anything from other mods. Please \n<br />note, this mod was designed to run with the vanilla weathers. It will \n<br />still function with mods such as climates of tamriel (not fully tested) .\n<br /> however you will get the best experience with vanilla weather. \n<br />\n<br />=============================================\n<br />[size=4]-Known Issues or Bugs-[/size]\n<br />=============================================\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Occasionally you will see clouds suddenly disappear or appear in the sky. \n<br />Unfortunately I have not yet found a way to fix this. However, It is not\n<br /> noticeably during normal game play; It is only really apparent when \n<br />directly looking at the sky for a period of time.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Sometimes clouds will flicker when the camera is moved past an area of high cloud\n<br /> coverage. So far I'm not sure how this can be fixed, however I will \n<br />investigate, and if anyone can help then it would be appreciated :)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/1QcRTW9l.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />=============================================\n<br />[size=4]-History-[/size]\n<br />=============================================\n<br />\n<br />2.00, 01/04/2014\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-Lightning\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-MUCH BETTER PERFORMANCE\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-A more realistic cloud model\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-Improved weather detection\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-Custom world space support\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-COT compatibility\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />- More balanced cloud coverage.
