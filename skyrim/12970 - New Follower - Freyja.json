A particulary \\\"overpowered\\\" follower.\r\n\r\nTo start off, locate the Book in Belethor\\'s shop in Whiterun.\r\n(pictures show location)\r\nThat should provide everything you need to find your new follower.\r\n\r\nThe book, titled \\\"The Old Guard\\\" gives you a glimpse into what your new follower will be like, aswell as a short back story.\r\n\r\n(sorry, i tried to make this a quest, but that\\'s way over my head at this time)\r\n\r\nOk, it\\'s been out for a while, so new pics have been uploaded, feel free to add any of yours :)",
