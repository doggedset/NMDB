However, it is guarded by a powerful guardian.\r<br />\r<br />Do you have what it takes to face the guardian and take the sword for yourself?\r<br />\r<br />You will find Ildthand south of Ivarstead. It is a Dwemer dungeon.\r<br />\r<br />Near it, you will also find the body of Marcus, a misfortunate young adventurer who attempted to claim the mighty sword. You will find a note on his body that has been written in his last dying moments.\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t hesitate to leave me your feedback.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;",
