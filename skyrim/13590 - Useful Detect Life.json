  "summary": "Fix Detect Life to act like Oblivion",
  "descriptionHtml": "Skyrim\\'s version of Detect Life is useless and annoying.\r\n\r\nUseless: the whole point of the spell is for stealthy characters to be able to find enemies to avoid/kill. Having to use a continuous-cast spell means no stealth AND being held almost immobile while sneaking.\r\nAnnoying: because of that, you end up in a retarded loop of \\\"cast for 1 sec, move for 5 secs, repeat forever\\\".\r\n\r\nIt\\'s just absolutely crap. In Oblivion, it was THE spell for thieves. In Skyrim, it\\'s not worth using at all. So this makes it work like it did in Oblivion.\r\n\r\nSpell level and base cost are unchanged, so it takes about 150 Magicka to cast at 50 skill, and half that with the Adept perk. Duration is 60 seconds. It\\'s still \\\"Skyrim-style\\\" as far as targets go, meaning only \\\"living\\\" creatures: that change, unlike the others, actually kind of makes sense so I left it that way.\r\n",
