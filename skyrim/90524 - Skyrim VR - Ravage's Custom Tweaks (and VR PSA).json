I mostly just find workarounds within the game and change stats for balance or reallocate existing resources. So... basically I'm a nobody, but want to offer the quick-start option for porting from Regular (Initial Release w/ DLC) TESV to TESV VR. And to hopefully grab the ears of the above mentioned modding talent in the hopes they migrate some mods into the VR format.\n<br />   ﻿This is more of a foot-in-the-door PSA, but I do have changes that I'm working the bugs out of which will be available for download when I know they work more smoothly. Right now the download is just the txt files and base custom ini needed to get the show going, see below instructions to find out where they need to go.\n<br />\n<br />[b]The Mod Enabling Process\n<br />[/b]   ﻿Ret-conning my original statement: Despite the Regular Skyrim format of plugins it is infact [u]Special Edition[/u] plugins that users are reported working. My TXT and INI tweaks still apply.\n<br />   ﻿And without further banter, See how to make stuff actually work below:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f4f4f4][b]***Ways to get SKSE/SE SKSE working*** [/b]\n<br />   ﻿Check Silverlock.org! the A-Team is on the case![/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4][b]Before doing any of the following: BACK UP YOUR CORE .ESM FILES (both data folders)[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Texture/Mesh Enabling[/size]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]0. Skyrim VR uses the same resources to work as the vanilla game (not Special Edition in realtion to .esms)\n<br />1. Texture and Meshes that are replacers without esps can be used in Skyrim VR the same way Fallout 4 mods get to work in F4 VR.\n<br />2.  ﻿Go to \"Documents -&gt; MyGames -&gt; Skyrim VR\" and create \"SkyrimCustom.ini\"\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿[Archive]\n<br />   ﻿bInvalidateOlderFiles=1\n<br />   ﻿sResourceDataDirsFinal=\n<br />\n<br />2b. Save, close.\n<br />3. Just dump the files and they work, was the first thing I got working.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4].ESM/.ESP Enabling[/size][/b]\n<br />Again: Core ESMs made in Regular Skyrim will be rejected by the program, Users have experienced success with some Special Edition modded plugins.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]1. Go to \"Users -&gt; *username* -&gt; AppData -&gt; Local -&gt; SkyrimVR\"[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]2a. Create \"DLClist.txt\" and add the following[/color]\n<br />\n<br />   [color=#ffff00]﻿Dawnguard.esm\n<br />   ﻿Hearthfires.esm\n<br />   ﻿Dragonborn.esm\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]2b. Save, close[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]3a. Create \"Plugins.txt\" and add the following ([/color][color=#ff0000][b].esm must be in this order[/b][/color][color=#ffff00])[/color]\n<br />\n<br />   [color=#ffff00]﻿*Skyrim.esm\n<br />   ﻿*Update.esm\n<br />   ﻿*Dawnguard.esm\n<br />   ﻿*Hearthfires.esm\n<br />   ﻿*Dragonborn.esm\n<br />   ﻿*SkyrimVR.esm[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]2b.

Use the Plugins.txt to enter the plugins in proper load order and they'll work. I'm running about 15 different SE ESPs right now flawlessly.\n<br />   ﻿Special Edition plugins are reportedly working. I have yet to try anything physic related since [color=#00ff00]Script Extender[/color] is required.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Working Regular/Special Edition Skyrim NON-ESP mods[/b]\n<br />   [color=#ffff00]﻿-Raw inject texture packs and meshes[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Working [s]Regular[/s] [u]SPECIAL EDITION[/u] Skyrim ESP[/b]\n<br />   [color=#ffff00]﻿-Currently: any Special Edition ESP that does not require Script Extender, Physics or FNIS[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Conclusion[/b]\n<br />   ﻿Well That's how to get the everything working. It's the same steps used to get F4 VR working too if anyone is recognizes it. It seems my initial assumption that SE was compatible was correct even though I jumped the gun and differed to Regular skyrim because of the ESM format in the data folder. MY BAD! Thank the comment and reddit posters!\n<br />   ﻿The easist way I'm able to mod is by dragging ESMs back and forth into the regular skyrim data folder to use the creation kit. You'll get a new error message for the VR component integrated into the ESP but ignore it and the editor will proceed. If you have the base creation kit program files as a separate entity, drag and drop them into VR folder and it [i]should [/i]work (haven't tried it). Just a game of hot-swapping files. Modding off the SE ESM might prove easier.\n<br />\n<br />[b]EXTRA, EXTRA! TWEAKING APPEARANCE! [color=#ff7700](NEW INFO 2018.04.14)[/color][/b]\n<br />   -﻿R-Click \"Properties\" the .exe and checkmark \"override DPI compatibility\" to \"application\".\n<br />   -﻿For the SkyrimPrefs.ini DON'T turn buseTAA to 0 thinking it'll make your image sharper, it will... BUT it will make all your menus freak out.\n<br />   ﻿-Documents&#92;MyGames&#92;SkyrimVR&#92;SkyrimPrefs.ini - adding the following could improve in-game sharpness (using super-sampling), this is the procedure used for F4VR and as the engines are virtually similar, these work. Simply ADD the following to the respective sections. Sharpness/resolution is ultimately limited to the hardware limits of your VR headset. This will reduced granularity but it will only sharpen images so much, I have personally noticed the bigger difference in closer objects than I have farther objects. (good differences)\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿-[i][b][color=#ff0000]BACK UP YOUR ORIGINAL INI FILE[/color][/b][/i]\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿-NOTE1: fRenderTargetSizeMultiplier is the supersampling, 1.0 is default, (i have heard going as high as 3.0 possible on a gtx1080 card)\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿-NOTE2: the following settings can be changed, but this was the given setup for a 2.0 supersampling that I found.\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿-NOTE3: This cannot be altered while the game is active\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿-STEP1: You need to disable \"advanced supersampling\" in the steam VR settings under \"developer\"\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][Display][/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]iLocation X=541[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]iLocation Y=83[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]fTAAPostSharpen=0.72[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]fTAASharpen=1.0000[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]fTAAHighFreq=0.8000[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]fTAALowFreq=0.5000[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]fTAAPostOverlay=0.72[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffff00][VRDisplay] [/color][b][color=#ff7700][i]-This is not already present in the INI, just create this section[/i][/color][/b]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]fRenderTargetSizeMultiplier=2.0 [/color][b][color=#ff7700][i]-This is the super sampling[/i][/color][/b]",
