  "summary": "A small but functional settlement overhaul for Enderal's 'Frostcliff Tavern'.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Georgia][color=#00ffff][size=6]~Frostville~[/size][/color][/font][/center][center]\n<br />\n<br />I had imagined Frostcliff Tavern to have a few more homes around itself- after all, the tavern is filled with villagers, and there are no nearby settlements anywhere to be seen in the Frostcliff Mountains. Rather, none that aren't filled with monsters and atronachs. \n<br />So, I've solved one issue - purely aesthetic - by adding static buildings on the exterior. **No Interior Zones added!\n<br />However, what I have done is this: \n<br />- 1 new Frostville guard.\n<br />- 3 new exterior NPCs; a bard, child and a Blacksmith vendor. Nice ambient lute playing to go with them! \n<br />- Several buildings, including a ruined chapel and external smithy. The Myrad tower has been moved up a bit.\n<br />- No current player home; one may arrive later.\n<br />*Frostcliff Tavern Interior has not been edited.\n<br />\n<br />It isn't much, but hopefully it adds so much more to your Enderal experience for Frostcliff Tavern to at least look like a proper settlement!\n<br />The earlier version of my work has been hidden- can be given upon request. The two are not compatible. \n<br />Only one .esp to drop into your Data folder.[/center]",
