  "descriptionHtml": "As requested by @Deathshead964 (at NEXUS) I made a female Thalmor follower. \r<br />Her name is Virlene. She is modded to be part of the Thalmor, \r<br />so if you attack the Thalmor in her presence she will most likely try to kill you. \r<br />Like my other Thalmor follower Aernil, \r<br />You can find her in the Winking Skeever Inn in Solitude. \r<br />She doesn&#39;t trigger traps, she levels with the player and you can marry her. \r<br />She is skilled in Destruction,Conjuration,Alteration and Sneak. \r<br />\r<br />If she has darker face than the rest of the body try This: open the console click on the NPC with the issue and type setnpcweight 100 and hit enter.\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t hesitate to make mod requests.
