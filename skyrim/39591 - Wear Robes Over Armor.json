  "descriptionHtml": "As a man who prefers the *far* superior Morrowind, I was often disappointed that in later games one couldn\\'t wear robes over armor. Perhaps they would rip, but I think my character is smart enough to drape a piece of cloth over his platemail. \r\nOr maybe he isn\\'t, the Dragonborn seems to have brain problems... \r\nAt any rate, this mod will allow you to wear your robes, over your armor. You might consider it unbalanced, but I\\'m not listening to you. \r\nThis mod only applies to VANILLA robes. Dragonborn patch can be download, when asking to upgrade choose no.\r\n\r\nUnderstand any non-vanilla robes can\\'t be worn over armor. \r\nMods that modify robes themselves will also conflict, though texture robe mods will not. \r\nFinally, yes the robes will clip with armor, more or less depending on the robe, the armor, and your skeletal frame. However, it\\'s not that outright horrible to look at, so really, just suck it up and live with it, or don\\'t download it, you baby. ",
