  "descriptionHtml": "[color=blue][size=18][b]Shadowfax horse texture![/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[b]DESCRIPTION[/b]\r\nThis is my humble attempt at adding Shadowfax to Skyrim, bringing two of my favorite fantasy worlds together.  Shadowfax is a noble white horse, ridden by Gandalf the wizard.  This replaces the texture of Frost (but maintaining its other properties) from a quest in Riften, as well as the Palomino horse from Solitude.\r\n\r\n[b]INSTRUCTIONS[/b]\r\nSimply copy and past the textures folder into the Data folder of\r\nyour Skyrim install directory. Usually: C:\\\\Program Files(x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\r\nTo uninstall, simply delete the horse02.dds and horsemanetail02.dds files contained in the directories.\r\n\r\n[b]DISCLAIMERS/NOTES[/b]\r\nDamnit, Jim, I\\'m a doctor, not an artist!\r\nThis is my absolute first mod to any game! Being such, I welcome any feedback, and this is an ongoing project that I hope to improve.  I still don\\'t fully understand how to fix the normal map, so that is probably my first goal (it is too shiny in my opinion).\r\nUse this at your own (although minimal) risk!\r\n\r\n[b][size=12]Enjoy! And please give feedback![/size][/b]",
