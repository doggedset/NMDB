  "descriptionHtml": "A mystical Dwemer tower of mysterious origin once found, will become a welcomed peaceful home for any powerful Magi.\r\n\r\nThis new player home is specifically designed with the Mage-type in mind, brought to you from the minds of RavenNight Designs.\r\n\r\nThere is a courier quest set to this home to guide our heroes to it. However, this IS My first ever attempt at any type of quest modding, so please, leave a comment and let Me know if I\\'ve messed it up, and if you know how, how to fix it. LoL\r\n\r\nRate, comment, endorse and/or donate, or any combination of the sort is greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\n____________________________________________________________\r\nVersion History:\r\n\r\nv1.0 - Initial release.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________",
