  "modName": "Remove NPC Armor and Shirt Script v1",
  "summary": "Didn\\'t see the point of having a Nude mod and not being able to see most of the goods so... I created this little script to remove the top half of selected NPC\\'s clothing or armour. ;D",
  "descriptionHtml": "This script will remove the top half of an NPC\\'s clothing or chestarmour. Eg: shirt, cuirass, dress, etc...\r\n\r\nIt will [b]not[/b] remove gloves, boots, shields, knifes etc, only clothing around the chest (unless it is a full body piece, then it will remove all).\r\n\r\nIt will remove the clothing item indefinitely, or until you re-equip the NPC manually with a console code and such.\r\n\r\nUnless you have a no underwear mod or nude mod, you won\\'t be able to see cheeky bits.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTo [b]install[/b], simply place the undresstop.txt file in you skyrim Data folder. Then when ingame, bring up the console (~), click on the NPC you wish to undress, type \\'bat undresstop\\', hit enter and close the console.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTo [b]uninstall[/b], delete the file.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n[b]Notes:[/b] I have only tested this script on a few NPC\\'s and so far it has worked great, even removing the armour from town guards. It is possible that I may have missed one or two pieces, if this is the case, simply add the console ID of the piece to the comments section and I will update accordingly.\r\n\r\nI know most ppl will use the ScriptDragon method to achive the same results, however as it currently requires an update, this will have to do for now :D\r\n\r\nAlso plan on making a few more, mostly that remove gloves, boots, etc for selected NPC\\'s. But that\\'s for later..\r\n\r\n[b]--UPDATE--\r\nI have uploaded a redress BAT which will redress the NPC in 000d191f (tavern clothing). To use this bat, simply click on an NPC and type \\\"bat redress.\\\"[/b]\r\n",
