  "descriptionHtml": "While visiting Dawnstar, my character was surprised that the only grindstone was located outside of the Inn and the town had no armor crafting table.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing this with Rustleif and pointing out how the weapon and armor quality in Dawnstar would be greatly improved by the addition of a grindstone and armor crafting table, Rustleif agreed to apply for a loan from the Blacksmith Guild.\r\n\r\nRustleif is pleased to announce that the loan was approved and that he has purchased and installed a new grindstone and armor crafting table next to his forge.  He hopes that the increased quality that he is able to produce will help him quickly repay the loan.\r\n\r\nInstallation: \r\nNothing special, place the ESP file in the Data directory and enable it.\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\nThis will conflict with anything that modifies the Dawnstar03exterior cell.",
