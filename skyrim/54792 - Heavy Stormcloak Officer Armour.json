  "summary": "Simply changes the Stormcloak Officer Armour set to heavy armour and increases the armour rating and weight of it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is a mod that alot of people have waited for as far as I can tell. I have searched all over for a mod like this, and couldn&#39;t find any suitable for my taste. The creation of Heavy Stormcloak Officer Armour does not entail anything cosmetic, only rating, armour class, weight changes. I uploaded this for the sheer happiness that comes from finding a mod that you were looking for and couldn&#39;t find anywhere else, like me. I thought I might as well create my own mod instead of looking all over.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Steps:\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;1. Download and install anyway you would like\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;2. Enable it in the checklist of mods to run in the Skyrim launcher (I have already tested this mod for functionality and it works just fine, no need to use console commands to spawn it because thats what I did)\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;3. Have FUN&#33; :D",
