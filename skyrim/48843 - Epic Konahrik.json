  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE PLAN: I&#39;m hoping to add a mechanic to this mod that addresses the description of the enchantment as well as making it so that the player must use the Skyforge to &#34;merge&#34; the masks together. Makes it seem a little more immersive, as well as less of a cheat item. I&#39;m taking opinions on what people think should be the required smithing level and any required perks.\r<br />\r<br />Simple mod that makes changes to the Konahrik mask. After all the work it took hunting down all eight of the Dragon Priests, I felt that Konahrik had a very weak enchantment. So I set upon the task of taking all the enchantments of the masks and combining them all into Konahrik, while retaining it&#39;s own original enchantment.\r<br />\r<br />Once you have collected all eight masks, traveled to Labyrinthian and used the wooden mask to acquire Konahrik then you will truly be a Dragonborn of untold power.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m still testing this mod, but the effects should stick. Check your active effects menu and ensure that the following enchantments are in effect:\r<br />\r<br />-KONAHRIK-\r<br />Konahrik&#39;s Privilege\r<br />\r<br />-HEVNORAAK-\r<br />Resist Disease, 100 pts\r<br />Resist Poison, 100 pts\r<br />\r<br />-KROSIS-\r<br />Fortify Lockpicking, 20% better\r<br />Fortify Archery, 20% better\r<br />Fortify Alchemy, 20% better\r<br />\r<br />-MOROKEI-\r<br />Regenerate Magicka, 100 points\r<br />\r<br />-NAHKRIIN-\r<br />Fortify Magicka, 50 pts\r<br />Fortify Destruction, cost 20% less\r<br />Fortify Restoration, cost 20% less\r<br />\r<br />-OTAR-\r<br />Resist Shock, 30 pts\r<br />Resist Fire, 30 pts\r<br />Resist Frost, 30 pts\r<br />\r<br />-RAHGOT-\r<br />Fortify Stamina, 70 pts\r<br />\r<br />-VOKUN-\r<br />Fortify Conjuration, 20 pts\r<br />Fortify Illusion, 20 pts\r<br />Fortify Alteration, 20 pts\r<br />\r<br />-VOLSUNG-\r<br />Waterbreathing, 20 pts\r<br />Fortify Barter, 20 pts\r<br />Fortify Carry Weight, 20 pts\r<br />\r<br />All of the following effects (if active) should show as &#34;Konahrik&#34; rather than their respective masks.\r<br />This does not add Dragonborn mask effects. Only vanilla masks are added to Konahrik.\r<br />Furthermore, the wooden mask effect has not been added to Konahrik either.",
