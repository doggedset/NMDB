  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE:\r\n\r\nSince I can\\'t add the music file I wanted to add due to nexus rules, you\\'ll have to find a wav/mp3 of a song you like, and convert it with MultiXwm (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3159).\r\n\r\nThen after installing the mod, you\\'ll have to replace the file called \\\"mus_mount_01\\\" with the one you create with MultiXwm. Make sure it\\'s called the same way (\\\"mus_mount_01\\\") and the extension is the same (\\\".xwm\\\").\r\n\r\nWhat id does:\r\n\r\nIt plays a specific music file you convert to xwm whenever you mount a horse. You could see it as some kind of \\\"horse radio\\\". When you dismount, it ends the music and goes back to the usual Skyrim bgms.",
