  "descriptionHtml": "Don&#39;t want to smith up the awesome rings of Ultravision, don&#39;t have the components or time to hunt them down? Then this is the mod for you. It places one of each ring in a chest next to Alvor&#39;s house in Riverwood. Chest doesn&#39;t respawn so don&#39;t lose them or you&#39;ll have to smith them. :D \r<br />\r<br />This mod requires johneh87&#39;s Rings of Ultravision ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14609/ ) to work and this mod has to go after his mod.
