  "modName": "Four new taller horses for different player types",
  "summary": "I made this mod bacause there are different player types like assassins, warriors and hunters and I wanted to make horses who fit.",
  "descriptionHtml": "&#33;&#33;&#33;Enhanced Horse Skins by Shogun3d is needed if you want the white or new grey skin. If you don&#39;t have this mod the horses will have vanilla skins for example the white one will be palomino. LINK: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/596/? &#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Location: All four horses are located at the Whiterun Stables and are free to ride.\r<br />\r<br />About the horses:\r<br />-Gallahad: He&#39;s my favorite. He&#39;s tall and pretty and perfect for warriors or kind of decadent players ;). He&#39;s the white one/palomino. He&#39;s the second fastest.\r<br />-Missandre: She&#39;s perfect for kind of normal players. She&#39;s the grey one and not that tall. She&#39;s the third fastest.\r<br />-Staadnau: She&#39;s pefect for nature friends or hunters because she has no saddle (I love this detail). She&#39;s the smalest and slowest but though faster and taller than normal horses. She&#39;s the brown one.\r<br />-Dante: He&#39;s probably the most badass horse of all. He&#39;s the Shadowmere skinned. &#34;But why not using Shadowmere instead?&#34; BEEECAUSE Dante is faster, much taller (what makes him look even more badass and demonic) and you don&#39;t have to finish any questline. He&#39;s the fastest of all and it&#39;s great fun to ride him.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33; :3\r<br />",
