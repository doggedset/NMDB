  "summary": "Makes Dead Thrall more convenient to use.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This tweak does three things:   \r\nFirst, it makes Dead Thrall castable with one hand, instead of two.  \r\nSecond, it reduces the cast time to zero.  \r\nThird, it reduces the cost to cast it to one.\r\n\r\nIt essentially just overpowers Dead Thrall.\r\n\r\nThis is my first tweak, that is why it is so simple\r\n\r\nnote:  I will attempt tweaks on other spells and weapons upon request.  I\\'m a beginner but i can still do a few things here and there.   If you have a request, just post it in the comments with what spell you want, and what you would like tweaked. ",
