As you run, you think about the gruesome day the drunk stormcloak soldier barged into your house, raped your mother then killed her. The thought sends shivers up your spine so you think good thoughts, like the time your emotionally fragile father finally allowed you to go adventuring. Suddenly, you fall right into a trapper\\'s wolf trap. The bear kills the trappers but now you are trapped in the cage but fortunately, a guard  came, killed the bear and freed you from the trap.",
