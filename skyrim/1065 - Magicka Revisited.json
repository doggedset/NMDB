  "summary": "Rebalances magicka usage and destruction magic damage",
  "descriptionHtml": "If you downloaded 1.0 you need to delete MagickaRevisited.esp from your data folder when installing 1.15. (If you downloaded 1.10, download 1.15 instead. 1.10 had the wrong MR esp.)\r\nBecause of the naming scheme change (which won\\'t happen again) you will probably lose Augmented Flame/Frost/Shock 3 if you had any of them. You can readd them by opening the console with ~ and typing exactly:\r\nhelp \\\"Augmented\\\" 4\r\nto get the perk codes for use with player.addperk xxxxxxxx. The ids are xx0581e7 - Flame 3, xx0581eb - Frost 3, xx058201 - Shock 3.\r\nAlso enchanting boost from 1.0/vanilla is not retroactive. Old enchants will not benefit.\r\n\r\nI looked around and tried out some of the various magicka system modifiers, but didn\\'t like them nor the large number of files I had to use.\r\nSo I learned about all the various esp entries and made my own.\r\nAlso, if I\\'m a master level destruction mage, with robes instead of armor, and at least 8 (more like 20, that\\'s almost half the reasonable number of perks [50] before leveling takes ages), I sure as hell expect to fry a damned town guard in two and a half seconds.\r\nOverall, this makes magicka a viable (in my opinion) skillset instead of being a potion chugger or spellblade.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\nEnchanting:\r\n\tEnchants are about x1.6 as powerful as vanilla.\r\n\t\r\nMagicka:\r\n\tBase magicka cost changed from x0.65 to x1. (Spells cost about x1.54~ of vanilla)\r\n\tNPC magicka cost changed from x0.5 to x1. (Vanilla NPC\\'s originally had a large reduction in magicka cost as well.)\r\n\tMagicka cost % reduction per skill level increased from 0.0025 to 0.0045. (at 100 skill from 25% magicka cost reduction to 45% reduction)\r\n\tIn-combat magicka regen multiplier increased from 0.33 to 1.\r\n\r\nDestruction:\r\n\tNovice:\r\n\t\tPerk magicka reduction at 65% \r\n\t\tFlames/Frostbite/Sparks base damage reduced to 5/sec.\r\n\tApprentice:\r\n\t\tPerk magicka reduction at 60%\r\n\t\tIncreases destruction magic damage by 25%\r\n\t\tFirebolt/Ice Spike/Lightning Bolt base damage reduced to 16.\r\n\tAdept:\r\n\t\tPerk magicka reduction at 65%\r\n\t\tIncreases destruction magic damage by another 35%\r\n\tExpert:\r\n\t\tPerk magicka reduction at 55%\r\n\t\tIncreases destruction magic damage by another 50%\r\n\tMaster:\r\n\t\tPerk magicka reduction at 60%\r\n\t\tIncreases destruction magic damage by another 60% (x4 damage total)\r\n\tOther:\r\n\t\tAugmented Flames/Frost/Shock now 3 point perks, add +25%/+45%/+65%. (x3 damage with 3/3 augmented perks, x12 all destruction damage perks)\r\n\t\tRune limit increased to 8 up from 1.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\nDual Casting changes. Use only one of these. \r\nNote that they affect ALL trees dual casting, not just destruction. (candlelight/shield spells get duration boost, wards get strength boost, calm/etc get level affect boosts, and so on. Pretty much any buff gets a duration boost and any damaging/level cap affected(calm) thing gets damage/level cap boost.)\r\n\r\nChanges in Powerful Dual Casting:\r\n\r\n\tDual casting effect increased from x2.2 to x6.66.\r\n\tDual casting time multiplier increased from x1 to x2.5. (dual casts take a longer amount of time to cast)\r\n\tDual casting magicka cost multiplier increased from 2.8 to 4.\r\n\r\nChanges in Faster Dual Casting:\r\n\r\n\tDual casting effect decreased from x2.2 to x2.\r\n\tDual casting time multiplier decreased from x1 to x0.75. (dual casts take a shorter amount of time to cast)\r\n\tDual casting magicka cost multiplier decreased from 2.8 to 1.5.\r\nFaster dual casting trades more impacts for less mana efficiency and requiring aiming more often. The damage outputs are roughly the same. \r\n\r\n\r\nV1.00 - \r\n\tOriginal mod.\r\nV1.10 - \r\n\tMoved dual-casting to separate files and rebalanced it. \r\n\tIncreased enchanting. \r\n\tRebalanced magicka costs and damage boosts.\r\nV1.15 -\r\n\tFixed correct esp.",
