  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u][color=#ff00ff][font=Georgia] [/font][font=Comic Sans MS][size=5]PART 2 IS NOW AVAILABLE TO DOWNLOAD&#33;[/size][/font][/color][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]Here I have included all of the coins I have quickly re-textured for the enjoyment of myself, didn&#39;t know I would get such a good reception for the first Henry VI Groat I uploaded so I have uploaded everything I use.I am sharing because other people may enjoy these quick re-textured coins for Skyrim. These include coins from the Celtic tribe of Dobunni all the way up to George III. Like I said previously in another file, these textures aren&#39;t the best you have seen but are good enough for me, they do look good in game but with some minor graphic problems and I do mean minor&#33; These are real coins that people used back in the day, real pictures were used and nothing made up. If you, like me enjoy history and want some more historical coinage in the game then this is for you. Feel free to download the file which will contain all the coins I have done so far and pick and choose what you would like to use.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]  I will be doing a lot more in the future as there are many coins to choose from so just keep on the look out. I haven&#39;t really seen any other &#39;&#39;Mods&#39;&#39; that have these coins so this is why I decided to do some myself. I am a complete Amateur at &#39;&#39;Modding&#39;&#39; so please be wary that the quality may not be up to scratch like most good modders, just so I am covering my back&#33; [/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00] [/color][color=#00ff00][u]Included in the file is (Not in order to the pictures):[/u]\r<br />1.
