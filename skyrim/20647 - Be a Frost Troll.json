  "descriptionHtml": "Carrying on from Gorf the Frost Troll companion (now known as Creature Companions) mod i decided it would be more fun to become the Frost Troll. Its not a perfect mod, but its got the basics including melee combat. No magic support at this stage however.\r\n\r\nTo be this troll simply select him in the race menu, or alternatively enter in the console:\r\nplayer.setrace gorfraceplayable\r\n\r\nTo explain my brief summary as above, what you can do is move, attack (with a couple of power attacks), and kinda jump attack, im really not sure what to call it. Items don\\'t equip very well, and weapons end up near your troll parts but never mind that, you\\'re a troll - you don\\'t care what happens down there. But seriously having magic equipped will disable your attacks, and equipping weapons changes damage accordingly. Armor i dunno, didn\\'t test damage against character. \r\n\r\nI recommend 3rd person for the best troll experience. However hold down your sprint key and then scroll into first person and you move much quicker. I think. \r\n\r\nEnjoy but play with caution, occasional bugs and crashes could occur. \r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nFix:\r\n18/07/2012: I have added a new file that should fix the 3rd person camera. Just drag and drop the \\\"Meshes\\\" folder into \\\"Data\\\" folder. Some overwrite of troll skeleton could occur for some people. This should not affect other gameplay at all.",
