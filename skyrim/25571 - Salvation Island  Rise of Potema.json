  "modName": "Salvation Island  Rise of Potema",
  "summary": "Potema has returned! A mysterious island has apeared on the lake by Falkreath.  Talks of prophecy coming true... whispers of undead legions rising!   Cities and towns are in ruins and people are dying everywhere! The only hope to survive is Salvation Island where the Psiijic Order and Blades have mobilized a defense.",
  "descriptionHtml": " This is my first mod but i have huge plans for it!!! So far i just have the Island i just started modding on elder scrolls a week ago.  I\\'m working on putting together a modding crew so i can expand this to potential i want it to be.  This is definitely still in Alpha stage. I plan on completely redoing the Skyrim cities and changing the enemy units models and textures to match an undead apocalypse. \r\n\r\nThere will be allot of planned quests. Example: Quarantining cities and towns and organizing an army to fight the undead legion. Plan on replacing dragons with Potema so as to have random confrontations with her until the final battle.  I may have just found a texture modder who will be a huge asset because i want to add new uniforms and monsters.  Salvation Island Blades will be an elite group which i will dedicate to my clan hence the name Z.D.C    Z.ombie D.efense C.orps.  Will have to defend Quarantine crews while they go through towns and burn infected corpses as well as rescue survivors.\r\n\r\nPlan on adding convoys that need protecting as well as undead convoys that need intercepting.\r\n\r\nLike i said i\\'m still learning and this is in Alpha.  Enjoy the screenshots and i welcome advice and help.    \r\n\r\n",
