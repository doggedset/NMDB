  "modName": "Breezehome Overhaul",
  "summary": "-Redesigned Breezehome in Whiterun completely\r\n-Added many storage and crafting utilities and Asthetic home decoration\r\n-NO magic house (small outside look with huge area inside), Thane\\'s personal npcs\r\n-Expanded the home WITHOUT any trap doors, all rooms in one cell \r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "I personally don\\'t like trap doors and unrealistic magic houses and I also love breezehome in Whiterun so I created this mod and share it on nexus.\r\n\r\nThis mod redesigned breezehome in Whiterun into a much larger house with a basement extension. Unlike mods with trap doors this house pur everything in one cell so you don\\'t have to get a loading screen for every single room in your house.\r\n\r\nThis house is also not monster size so you can quickly assess any tools in the house without too much running.\r\n\r\nMany detail decorations added to make your life in breezhome a better experience.\r\nI also added a lot of display and storage items in the house in a scattered manner so you don\\'t get a boring straight line of chests or mannequins. All containers are not respawn items EXCEPT the flour bag and the alchemy pouch.\r\nNew npcs added to make the house more lively and personal house guards for the great dragonborn. There is a room with two children beds intended for adoption in HF (not tested)\r\n\r\nA no npc version is added for those who like it\r\n\r\nThanks for your download\r\n\r\nFor those who need to update the file simply over write it mannually for choose update file on nexus manager.\r\n\r\nPlease report any bug NOT LISTED HERE to me. I will try to fix them.\r\n\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nHere is a video a gentle soul made for the mod. Thank for the great introduction of my mod by the video producer Brodual.\r\n\r\n[youtube]9YDHUivYbDo[/youtube]\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nPlace all files in data folder of this mod in the the data folder of the game or use Nexus download manager.\r\nIf you have items stored in your house in a saved game TAKE THEM ALL OUT BEFORE INSTALLING THIS MOD.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nTake out all your stored items in Breezehome and remove Better Breezehome.esp and Better Breezehome.ini\r\n\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\n\r\nTested with DG and HF. It is not dependant on skyrim update.\r\n\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n\r\n-House upgrades may not work properly, You may or may not get the option to upgrade your house after purchase. But everything in the pictures should be in place properly either way.\r\n\r\n-If you install this mod after you purchased breezehome and have previously entered it you will see items from your old house spawn all over the place in this new house. These items will disappear once you play the game with the mod for sometimes (They will cause no trouble). \r\n\r\n-Lydia may not appear immediately in the new house, because she have to reset to her new location. Again give it some in game days and she will appears again. \r\n\r\n-If there are two Lydia appeared which seem to be the case for quite a few users, you can use console command to \\\"kill\\\" one for now. I will try to find a \\\"cleaner\\\" solution for it in the future.\r\n\r\n-Pet fox may get attack, if it happens let it be killed or simply kill it. I wanted to make a unique pet for the house so I tried to use a fox which by default is an enemy so it may get attacked by guards.\r\n\r\nAll known problems caused by this mod (except aesthetic) can be fixed through some console commands if you don\\'t mind using the console. You guys are smart enough to figure out the detail on what command to use =p\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
