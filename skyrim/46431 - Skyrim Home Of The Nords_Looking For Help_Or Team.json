  "descriptionHtml": "Skyrim has a pretty decent storyline, although the characters are very stale especially compared with the mod Immersive NPC's. I have a very rough idea of how I want this mod to progress and will be looking for help from anon who likes the idea. \r\n\r\nVersion 1=All Main Quest NPC's voice acted with new lines(and existing lines) with Real EMOTION!\r\nVersion 2= '' same thing done to Faction Characters\r\nVersion 3= '' plus same thing done to DLC's\r\nVersion 4= '' All Misc NPC's\r\n_____________________________________________________________\r\nVersion 4= ' (If possible) Add, and synch body language into the new dialog.\r\n\r\nI have zero modding experience myself and am desperately looking for people to help out this project, from coding, to packaging, to voice acting. I am looking more for a team/ individuals who would like to contribute there experience. I intend to be the leader of the project as far as what direction it heads. The job I will be doing for now is listening to all the dialogue and providing each character with an interesting background that holds true to that character an is lore friendly. If you are interested in the idea of his mo please message me, if you have any questions leave them in the comments.",
