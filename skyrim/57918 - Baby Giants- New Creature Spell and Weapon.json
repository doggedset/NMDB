This mod adds a new creature, location, spell, and weapon. \r<br />Features: \r<br />-Baby Giants \r<br />-New Location \r<br />-Conjure Baby Giant \r<br />-Giant Slayer \r<br />\r<br />Lore: \r<br />There were some rebellious young giants who were contatcted by Molag Bal. They then snuck out of their giant camp and created an altar to Molag Bal. They have been worshipping him since. \r<br />\r<br />Just requires Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />I reccomend you be at least level 20. It is a tough fight, They do the same damage as regular giants, they just have less health. \r<br />\r<br />They are located near Solitude, the map marker is visible. \r<br />\r<br />Please report any bugs.",
