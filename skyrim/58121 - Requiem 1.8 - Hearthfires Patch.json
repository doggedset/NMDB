  "summary": "A patch to make Hearthfires compatible with Requiem 1.8. Based on Azirok&#39;s patch, but does not require it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a temporary patch to make some of the content of the Hearthfires DLC, namely the added Housecarls, fall in line with Requiem v 1.8&#39;s changes to the Vanilla housecarls. (special hold-specific armor, added perks, rebalance).\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />Latest Version of Skyrim\r<br />Hearthfires DLC\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281/?]Requiem version 1.8[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[u]Install[/u]: Install this mod like you would any other. It&#39;s just an esp.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Load Order[/u]: Load this after Requiem, but before any bashed patches, etc.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Update/Uninstall[/u]: This mod doesn&#39;t add or modify scripts, so if any other patches come out, feel free to uninstall this one or update with another.\r<br />\r<br />[u]What the mod does[/u]: This mod changes the three Housecarls (Gregor, Rayya, Valdimar) added by the Hearthfires&#39; DLC. It alters their default outfit to a helmetless version of the Hold Steel Plate Armor guards wear in Requiem v1.8, which the housecarls in the 5 major holds also have. It also rebalances their stats to be in line with Requiem 1.8&#39;s Housecarl stats, and rebalances them when necessary.\r<br />\r<br />[u][i][b]NOTE:[/b][/i][/u] In keeping with the Requiem style, I decided that for the sake of standardization and since it seemed to be Bethesda&#39;s initial intention to make Valdimar a Battlemage; his skill set as well as his starting weapon make him more suitable to the Heavily Armored Battlemage archetype. As such, this will override the Unofficial Hearthfires Patch&#39;s changes to his skills. For balance reasons, Valdimar no longer has Mage Armor spells, Heal Self (Rank III), and his Turn Undead got a nerf from Rank II to Rank I. Leave feedback if you think I should change this, though as I stated earlier this patch is merely temporary until azirok releases his. Speaking of which...\r<br />\r<br />[b]Thanks:\r<br />[/b]azirok - for making/compiling the Requiem Patches at [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54562/]Requiem - Patch Central\r<br />[/url]This patch is built using his patch as a basis. If he would like this updated patch, I will gladly take this page down and send the file over to him for Patch Central. The guy&#39;s busy with work; as a modding community we should all help each other out.\r<br />\r<br />ogerboss, xarrian, and Kazekage1 for their work on Requiem. Thanks for making Skyrim less of a hack and slash and more of an actual role-playing game again.\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda, for the Game, DLCs, and modding tools associated with them.\r<br />\r<br />You, the modder, for downloading this patch. :)\r<br />\r<br />[b]History:\r<br />v1.01 - [b]Added required perk ranks, I had them set to rank 0 when they should have been Rank 1. Shoutout to tyrthyllanos for catching this&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />v1.0[/b] - Initial release.",
