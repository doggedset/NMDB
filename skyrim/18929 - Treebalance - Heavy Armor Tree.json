  "summary": "Improves the Heavy Armor perk tree so it makes a bit more sense.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[font=verdana]Heavy Armor\\'s perk tree mixed its defense and utility perks together and required some odd prerequisites. This is a small change to that.\r\nAlso available on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=77272635]Steam Workshop[/url].\r\n\r\n[list][*]Fists of Steel\\'s requirement was dropped to 20 to make it available earlier for unarmed builds, and those who do not wish to use unarmed no longer have to spend a perk on it to unlock anything else.\r\n\r\n[*]Cushioned\\'s requirement dropped to 30 to get it out of the way sooner. Its effect was changed from -50% fall damage to -95% fall damage. You\\'ll still need Ethereal Visage to jump off a mountain, but Cushioned should at least be useful now.\r\n\r\n[*]Tower of Strength was moved to the other side of the tree (between Cushioned and Conditioning) and I\\'ve included a [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11887/]bugfix[/url] so it actually does something. It now correctly gives you a 50% chance to ignore stagger. I\\'ve also included a fix for Force Without Effort so that it drops stagger chance and stacks with Tower of Strength.\r\n\r\n[*]Matching Set was corrected to give a 25% bonus as it reports (it was erroneously giving 20%) and now works with ebony armor sets as well. It also no longer requires a helmet.\r\n\r\n[*]Reflect Blows now requires a heavy armor chest piece and no light armor. Cushioned requires heavy armor boots and no light armor. Well Fitted no longer requires a helmet.[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]Light Armor Tree[/color]\r\nA small optional pack for Light Armor now also exists. It doesn\\'t actually touch the tree structure itself (so it\\'s compatible with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19867]Ridin\\' Dirty[/url], for example), instead just slightly modifying a few of the perks to better match how I\\'ve set up their Heavy Armor counterparts.\r\n[list][*]Matching Set was corrected to give a 25% bonus as it reports (it was erroneously giving 20%). It also no longer requires a helmet.\r\n[*]Deft Movement now requires a light armor chest piece and no heavy armor. Wind Walker requires light armor boots and no heavy armor. Custom Fit no longer requires a helmet.[/list]\r\n[/font]",
