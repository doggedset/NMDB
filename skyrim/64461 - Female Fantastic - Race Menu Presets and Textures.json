  "summary": "Texture sets, presets and other resources for making beautiful female characters or customizing your followers.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ffff00]\r<br />Thanks for all your endorsements and images.. it is nice to see that you like my work.\r<br />\r<br />Just to be clear: I use the term texture set or texture pack for the combined textures, normal maps, etc. All you need into one archive. Just install it as another texture mod and your PC (your character) will use it.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Description[/u][/b]\r<br />Let me start by stating the obvious: beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The last couple of weeks I have uploaded images of my characters and they were highly appreciated. That is the reason I am sharing these resources: I hope to make other Skyrim players happy.\r<br />\r<br />I like female characters and the presets I have made are a couple of my favorites. They are also my personal taste. But, the beauty of Skyrim is that you can use my presets and change them to your liking. These texture sets and presets are a way to help you: this mod aims to give you more information on building your own female character. See it as a starting point.\r<br />\r<br />There are so many very good mods on the Nexus. I have been making lots of female characters based on these mods. Sometimes combining them, sometimes blending them. Tne combinations are endless and not every combination works. I say that for every good character I have made, I have ten that I end up not using. So, another reason for this mod is to save you a lot of trial and error.\r<br />\r<br />I cannot take credit for all the very good mods I have used in these texture packs. Please look at the work of the original authors (see Credits section). They have my highest appreciation and thanks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Why only UNP/SevenBase/Nord?[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />I have used CBBE a lot. It was my body type of choice for a long time. But, at the moment I have switched to UNP based bodies (UNP/SeveNBase). I think almost all textures and armors are available for UNP and/or sevenbase. And, since you now can adjust the body scales in Race Menu using the plugin of the XP32 skeleton, there is no longer a need for me to use Body Slide. It also saves me a lot of hassle and followers are also easier to tweak.\r<br />\r<br />Why only the Nord females? I just like the structure of the faces. That is, I can really make every character I want and with the other races I feel myself limited to their respective facial structures (meshes). Mind you, I have seen images of very beautiful elves. On another note, it would take me too much time to make these texture sets and presets for other races and body types. These characters have evolved over the last months in what they are now. I have a full time job and mod Skyrim for a hobby. With this mod, presets and description I hope to enspire you to make your own customizations for your own body type. And of course let us enjoy them, either through pictures or new mods&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Required Mods[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />[url=http://www.tumblr.com/search/ks%20hairdo&#39;s]KS Hairdo&#39;s 400[/url] (not on the Nexus)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?]The Eyes of Beauty[/url] \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62639/?]Empyrean Warpaints[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30411/?]Brows[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Very Recommended Mods[/u][/b][/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20343/?]\r<br />RANs Eye Reflection Extender[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13457/?]Face Light[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Installation[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />Install the required mods. They play an important role in the appearance of the presets. You can do without them, but you&#39;ll end up missing eyes, hair or other features.\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][size=2]The characters all have two files: the archive with the textures/meshes and the Race Menu preset.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Just install the texture archive using a mod manager or extract it to your Skyrim data directory.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Extract the preset to the Presets folder of RaceMenu and import it in Skyrim. Some characters have more than one preset.[/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Notes:\r<br />[list][*]This mod is for UNP based Nord females only (see above).[/*]\r<br />[*]You can only use one texture set at a time, unless of course you add them to a custom race or follower.\r<br />[*]Every texture set contains a small text file listing the used items.\r<br />[*]For some reason Race Menu doesn&#39;t always select the right complexion. My Raven and Jessie presets will look better with complexion 3. Select it after loading the preset.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Previews[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />If you want to preview the characters, take a look at these videos or view my images (by following my profile).\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]DpKN1NBfA0o[/youtube][/center][center][/center][center][youtube]kbdSP9T9I7Q[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Experimenting[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />For me, I like the freckles of Fair Skin. The mature skin texture of Maevan. The goose bumps of HHaleyss. You get the point. The important part is to experiment. Sometimes your character comes to life when you find the right combination.\r<br />\r<br />If you can... use Mod Organiser. In my opinion this is a mod user&#39;s best friend. You can install a mod. Move it to change the order. Delete it. Enable only specific files. All without reinstalling other mods or Skyrim entirely. I can switch to another look in seconds by only disabling/enabling the required mods. This has let me to very beautiful combinations, of which I have created my characters. Often I make a good looking character in Race Menu, but then experiment with all the texture mod packs or make new ones. \r<br />\r<br />If you have never used Face Light, try it. It is awesome: your characters face will come to life. I always use it on my female characters.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Appearance[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />I think I have some 50+ different appearance mods. This can give surprising results. A texture mod can look awful on one character, but compliments another. The appearance of your character mostly depends on the following layers that make up the skin:\r<br />\r<br />[u]Textures (.dds files)[/u]\r<br />These are the base textures of your skin: the base colors, moles, etc.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Normal maps (_msn.dds files)[/u]\r<br />See this layer as a fine sculpting texture. It can give your character more muscles or a six pack. But, for me the most important is how it effects your characters face. In this respect I think it is equally, it not more, important than the textures themselves.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Specular maps (_s.dds maps)[/u]\r<br />I am sure you have seen pictures of sweaty bodies. Well in Skyrim they are the specular maps. They affect the finish of your skin: shine, sweat, goose bumps, no shine, etc.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=3]ENB[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />If your computer can handle it, use an ENB. It is probably the best thing you can do to enhance you character and Skyrim. A tip for getting better performance is to disable Depth of Field and Ambient Occlusion. They almost always have a big impact on your frame rate. I use a modified Somber 3 ENB in my Video&#39;s.\r<br />\r<br />There are a lot of settings that can affect the look of your character. I will show you two sections of my enbseries.ini. But, keep in mind that changing these settings in your own ENB profile may lead to other results. This is because many other settings my interact with them.\r<br />\r<br />This is part of the environment section (only the specular.. lines). They change the shininess of objects in Skyrim, thus also that of the skin:\r<br />\r<br />SpecularAmountMultiplierDay=1.142\r<br />SpecularAmountMultiplierNight=1.32\r<br />SpecularAmountMultiplierInteriorDay=1.132 \r<br />SpecularAmountMultiplierInteriorNight=1.132\r<br />SpecularAmountMultiplierSunrise=0.0\r<br />SpecularAmountMultiplierSunset=0.0\r<br />SpecularPowerMultiplierDay=1.15\r<br />SpecularPowerMultiplierNight=1.5\r<br />SpecularPowerMultiplierInteriorDay=1.15\r<br />SpecularPowerMultiplierInteriorNight=1.15\r<br />SpecularPowerMultiplierSunrise=0.001\r<br />SpecularPowerMultiplierSunset=0.001\r<br />SpecularFromLightDay=0.05\r<br />SpecularFromLightNight=0.05\r<br />SpecularFromLightInteriorDay=0.05\r<br />SpecularFromLightInteriorNight=0.05\r<br />SpecularFromLightSunrise=0.0\r<br />SpecularFromLightSunset=0.0\r<br />\r<br />This is my entire subsurface scattering section. They change the way light interacts with the skin layers:\r<br />\r<br />[SUBSURFACESCATTERING]\r<br />IgnoreWeatherSystem=true\r<br />EnableTextureAlpha=true\r<br />Quality=0\r<br />Radius=9.0\r<br />Amount=0.35\r<br />EpidermalAmount=8.0\r<br />SubdermalAmount=6.0\r<br />EpidermalDiffuseSaturation=0.88\r<br />SubdermalDiffuseSaturation=0.66\r<br />EpidermalMix=0.05\r<br />SubdermalMix=1.0\r<br />SubdermalTranslucency=0.1\r<br />SubdermalPhase=0.69\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3][u]Customizing Followers[/u][/size][/b]\r<br />Many follower mods have their texture files in a separate directory. You can use the texture packs of this mod and give those followers another appearance too. Just overwrite the files in the directory of the follower.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]HDT Bounce and Sway[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />I have included a custom HDT Bounce XML in the files section. I based this on the Bounce and Jiggles file from knightmare077. His work was awesome, but I wanted a more &#39;mature&#39; sway of the breasts. Like the file from knightmare077, the tweaking of the XML took a long time, but the resulting movement is great. There is only one side note: sometimes armor has a big movement of its own which adds to the breast movement. If you have many of such armors, then you might not want to use this XML.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=3]Credits[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />HHaleyss - Fair Skin Complexion\r<br />betterbecause - BI Phenotypes\r<br />EcthelionOtW - Seductive Lips HD\r<br />Maevan2 - Mature Skin\r<br />xs2reality - Sporty Sexy Map - Athletic muscle mod\r<br />Luminalion - Adorable Face\r<br />Diethardt - Better Makeup for SKSE\r<br />zzjay - Women of Skyrim Normal Maps\r<br />knightmare077 - HDT Bounce and Jiggles\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]My Other Mods[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]In collaboration with VRDaphni[/b][/u]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73017/?][img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/73017-0-1454076683.png[/img]\r<br />Kaylin - Follower[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]ZwabberdieBo:[/b][/u]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63680/?][img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/63680-1-1426617149.png[/img][/url][/b][/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63680/?]\r<br />Born Dragon Skin[/url]",
