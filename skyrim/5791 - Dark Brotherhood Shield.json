  "descriptionHtml": "This is a retexture of the hide shield in skyrim. I made it for my character and thought; why not share it! If I can make one other person happy with it, it\\'s worth it :)\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod ever. I made it to match the Triss Armor Retextured mod, which replaces the Dark Brotherhood armor. To be enchanted and improved to your liking.\r\n\r\nPlease leave a comment (and maybe, if you like it, an endorsment :) And as said, I am a total noob at modding so please don\\'t go \\\"Oh you should have made it HQ and do this and that\\\" cause frankly, that\\'s all beyond my skill xD\r\n\r\nPaste in skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\hide\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\n-Make it stand-alone\r\n-Increase value and armor rating\r\n-requests?
