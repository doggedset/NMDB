  "descriptionHtml": "To use the house you have to get into Blackreach; you will then be able to use the house as you please. \r\n\r\n\r\nI will be adding more to this mod, I intend to add a spell that will allow you teleport there with an alteration spell ( I would already have this done but I am a noob at making mods so I have no idea what to do). I also want to create a small quest to obtain this spell before hand so you can get reep the benefits of this house early on in you game. I will take any request or advice into consideration.",
