  "descriptionHtml": "SKSE is NOT required\r<br />\r<br />Review, thanks to [i]Xuul[/i]\r<br />[youtube]Pyqk_DNOPCo[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If zombies are smart enough to use a sword, why don&#39;t use them for some routine tasks? True necromancer would never carry a pickaxe in his life.\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]Leave all the work to dead. Undead mine ore, clean your house and entertain people around.[/color] Doesn&#39;t change any vanilla spells. Should be compatible with everything (including mods related to necromancy)\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]yRPingjin3E[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Farming and collecting plants\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]PDb-JqwKyN8[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[b]How to gain the “Undead Wish” ability?[/b]\r<br />Activate the Ritual Stone. You will receive the spell only if you have (Conjuration &gt; 35)\r<br />\r<br />Use the spell for the first time and you will have the ability to access zombies inventory anytime. \r<br />In order to serve you, undead should have necessary tools. If you have a dead body, place the correct items first\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=yellow]Miner: [/color] [/u][/b]Place a pickaxe into a dead body\r<br />\r<br />Once you activate  “Undead Wish”, all miners around will start mining if they have a vein nearby. If there is no vein, they will wait until they cross one.\r<br />\r<br />Now you don’t have to mine ore yourself anymore (this is the primary goal of this mod, it’s the very reason why it was created in the first place), the dead will do the job for you and you can perform less boring activities while they are busy.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=yellow]Housemaid: [/color][b][u] [/u][/b][/u][/b]Place a broom in the inventory before raising a zombie\r<br />\r<br />“Undead Wish” will force zombies to start sweeping. If you relax in a chair while zombies around are cleaning the house, you will get the stamina regeneration bonus.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=yellow]Waiter: [/color][b][u][b][u] [/u][/b][/u][/b][/u][/b]\r<br />Requires the following items:\r<br />[list][*]Alcohol\r<br />[/*][*]Platter\r<br />[/*][*]Silver Goblets (the little ones, the ones that are polished)\r<br />[/*][/list]\r<br />The alcohol is consumed when you cast the spell. \r<br />The more goblets - the more people around will get their drinks\r<br />\r<br />If you allow someone else to take the first drink, you will receive the “Fortify Speechcraft” and “Fortify Stamina” bonuses.\r<br />\r<br />To stop the process - access the inventory, remove the required items (platter should be enough). The service will stop eventually by itself.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=yellow]Picker: [/color][b][u][b][u] [/u][/b][/u][/b][/u][/b]\r<br />Requires a basket. Not all baskets can be used and not all baskets will have the animation\r<br />\r<br />Zombie will collect all the ingredients he encounters for a small period of time (you need to recast the spell after that). Try to walk slowly as the process takes time (every time is processed within few seconds to keep the immersion)\r<br />\r<br />The process will be stopped with time. However, you can just remove the basket from the inventory and zombie will be ready for another activity \r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=yellow]Farmer: [/color][b][u][b][u] [/u][/b][/u][/b][/u][/b]\r<br />No special items needed, but you need to stay close to the farm (the Hoe item should persist at farm). You can actually help farmers in Skyrim by extending the existing fields (new plants will remain forever)\r<br />\r<br />Zombies can&#39;t plant new seeds in a random place, all they can do is clone the existing vegetables and flowers. Every object can be cloned only once, so the balance and challenge remains.\r<br />\r<br />I would like to keep this mod as simple as possible, since it&#39;s not my priority.",
