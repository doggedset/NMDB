  "summary": "This mod adds a basement to the Temple of Kynareth which was designed after seeing Hothtrooper44\\'s Paladin Armor. Basic, lore friendly and includes a back story of how the Temple of Kynareth came to be.\r\n\r\nPerfect for any Paladin or follower of Kynareth! :)",
  "descriptionHtml": "After downloading Hothtrooper44\\'s Paladin Armor I loved the idea of having a character that was completely dedicated to being a paladin, especially with the Dawnguard DLC. My character being a follower of Kynareth, I thought it would be a good idea to make the temple more interesting and more worth your while spent there by simply adding a basement to display your most prized paladin armor. \r\n\r\nThe mod also comes with a backstory of how the Temple of Kynareth came to be. It should make those lore thirsty players out there content anyway. ;)\r\n\r\nThe mod itself doesn\\'t come with Hothtrooper44\\'s Paladin Armor because that would be stealing! However you can download it here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20836\r\n\r\nMAKE SURE YOU ENDORSE HIM!\r\n\r\nI would also recommend this mod too by \\'Wannsa\\' if you want to make the Temple of Kynareth that bit more pretty: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5638\r\n\r\nAGAIN, DO NOT FORGET TO ENDORSE HIM IF YOU DOWNLOAD!\r\n\r\nThe mod also contains two unique weapons to which you will learn who they belonged to (so long as you read the journal that is). It also contains a set of steel plate armor which also belonged to the person in the back story. I felt that this vanilla armor was the closest to looking like a paladins armor than anyother vanilla equipment in the game. :)\r\n\r\nI will say not I am not an excellent modder, but I just know the basics of the Creation Kit to satisfy my own ideas. It is completely companion friendly and should of course be bug free. Its only a sweet and simple little mod. I thought however other people enspired by Hothtrooper\\'s Paladin Armor would perhaps enjoy this mod too. So enjoy!",
