It has no associated quests but the endboss carries a unique mask. The enchantment on the mask, covered by the flavor text, is 20% fortify shout, 50% fortify health regeneration, 20% fortify magic resistance. Due to some pathing mistakes, enemies will come at you like you&#39;ve stolen their sweetroll. It is doable but probably not with a naked lvl1 character. \r<br />\r<br />This requires both Dawnguard and Dragonborn.",
