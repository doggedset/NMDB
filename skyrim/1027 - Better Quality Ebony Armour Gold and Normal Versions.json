  "descriptionHtml": "[size=\\\"5\\\"][color=\\\"#ADD8E6\\\"][b]New Updates:[/b][/color][/size] I update this texture pack often (almost daily) so you may want to track this file if you like the texture changes that I am making :D\r\n\r\n-Added gold version male textures and new pictures of the gold version for males :D\r\n[url=\\\"http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/images/1027-2-1322106951.jpg\\\"]Back[/url]\r\n[url=\\\"http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/images/1027-3-1322106951.jpg\\\"]Side[/url]\r\n[url=\\\"http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/images/1027-1-1322106949.jpg\\\"]Front[/url]\r\n\r\n-Uploaded a new screenshot of the ebony shield vanilla and after my tweaks. I have overlayed the original shield texture with two 4096x4096 steel textures to give it a better look, also created a new normal map for it. \r\nTake a look at the screenshot and comment please. [url=\\\"http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/images/1027-1-1322064070.jpg\\\"]Shield Comparison[/url]\r\n[b]Note:[/b] I have not uploaded this yet as I want to retexture/edit the rest of the ebony weapon textures and upload them all at once.\r\n\r\n-Added the male textures for the ebonymail armour. The download includes my modified normal textures for the ebonyarmour head, gloves, and boots.\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"5\\\"][color=\\\"#ADD8E6\\\"][b]Old Updates:[/b][/color][/size]\r\n-Added Black Armour with Gold Trim for male textures. This is a WIP (work in progress) I am not entirely happy with the gold trim at the moment (seems a little bright still). Please leave feedback on this texture in the comments, need your feedback to make it better. \r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Normal Male Version Added! See Screenshots :D (looks a bit better than female version, so I might redo female version)\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"5\\\"][color=\\\"#ADD8E6\\\"][b]Description:[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nEbony armour is my favourite model in Skyrim, and I was disappointed that the designs on the armour are not very visible, and the armour seemed a bit dull. \r\n\r\nThese textures make the designs on the armour stand out and takes the grey layer that the armour seemed to have on it, causing it to look dull away. Also added a gold version...\r\nSee pictures\r\n\r\nCurrently only changed the female textures, will work on male ones if people like/want to see them because at the moment I don\\'t need them for myself and there are a lot of other textures that need to be fixed :]\r\n\r\nMay add a silver version if people request one or any other colour for that matter.\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"5\\\"][color=\\\"#ADD8E6\\\"][b]Installation:[/b][/color][/size]\r\nDrop the data folder into your skyrim directory.\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"5\\\"][color=\\\"#ADD8E6\\\"][b]Terms and Conditions of Use:[/b][/color][/size]\r\nIf you want to change these files and then upload them again or use them in a different mod please give me some credit :]",
