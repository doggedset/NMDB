  "descriptionHtml": "You MUST have the latest version of Skyrim, Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn in order for this mod to work&#33;&#33;\r<br /> \r<br />This is a small cottage located next to the road in-between Whiterun and Riverwood. The house is on the cliff with an amazing view of Whiterun.\r<br />The main house has a kitchen, master bedroom, child bedroom, and library. The basement in the main house has an armory, storage area, smithing, alchemy, and enchanting area. There is a farm outside that has planting spots like those found in Hearthfire homes, and a spa area. There is a guest house that you can \r<br />comfortably leave 3 followers in.\r<br /> \r<br />This mod is compatible with the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249/?]Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions[/url] by TMPhoenix. You can up to 2children in this mod. I highly recommend it.\r<br />I&#39;ve also used a lot of custom static meshes so if there&#39;s something that you cannot pick up, that&#39;s likely why. I know that it&#39;s weird to have some things static and some things not, but I personally don&#39;t mind it. I assume that the only mods that are non-compatible are mods that modify the cells the house is located in.\r<br /> \r<br />[size=5][b]Features[/b][/size]\r<br /> \r<br />83 Containers (ALL Safe)\r<br />42 Weapon Racks\r<br />6 Shield Racks\r<br />9 Mannequins\r<br />8 Bookshelves\r<br />4 Small Weapon Displays\r<br />1 Large Weapon Display\r<br />6 Beds (1 Master Bed, 2 Child beds, 3 Follower beds)\r<br />Cooking Pot\r<br />Oven\r<br />Butter Churn\r<br />Anvil\r<br />Sharpening Wheel\r<br />Tanning Rack\r<br />Workbench\r<br />Alchemy Table\r<br />Enchanting Table\r<br />Shrine of Dibella, Talos, Mara, Stendarr, and Julianos\r<br />2 Chickens, with nests\r<br />Apiary\r<br />7 Plantable Soil Spots\r<br />Guard Dog, Thor (follower)\r<br />TONS of Idle Markers for Family and Followers\r<br /> \r<br />[b]NOTE:[/b] I have a lot of various graphics mods in my game,so the mod might look a little different if you have different graphic mods than I do. Also, in the photos I realized a little late that I have weapons, armor, books, and quest items on display that are not in the actual mod. All of the bookshelves, weapon racks, and mannequins are empty. \r<br /> \r<br />[b]Resources Used:[/b]\r<br /> \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/?]ModdersResource Pack[/url] by Oaritys and Tony67\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14133/?]FoodContainer Resource[/url] by Blary\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14135/?]BookSets Resource[/url] byBlary\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30602/?]IngredientsWall Art[/url] by Blary\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14136/?]PotionShelfResource[/url] by Blary\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42362/?]OpenBooks Library[/url] by stoverjm\r<br /> \r<br />[b]Install[/b]:\r<br /> \r<br />I really recommend using NMM to install the mod.\r<br />--or--\r<br />Extract the files into your Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE 5/23/15: I wanted to thank those who downloaded, endorsed, and gave feedback&#33; It means a lot to me&#33; I looked at the bugs you guys listed and I&#39;ll be working on fixing them. As a temporary fix for the Openbooks Library textures missing, installing the Openbooks mod into your Data folder seems to fix it.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE 6/25/15: I recently had my hard drive crash on me, and I had lost everything on my computer, including my mod files. It&#39;ll take longer than I thought to fix and unfortunately now I have to redue everything. I&#39;m sorry for those waiting for an update.\r<br />\r<br />UPATE 11/10/16: I want to say thank you to all the support that you guys have given this mod&#33; Unfortunately I&#39;m not going to be updating the mod on this version of Skyrim. I do however, plan to update and upload it for the Special Edition when I have time to do so.",
