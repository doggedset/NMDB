  "descriptionHtml": "Riverwood Player House\r\n\r\n======UPDATE 1.1=========\r\n\r\nMucked around with the Navmesh stuff and made it so that now any companions or followers will follow you inside.\r\n\r\nTo install update 1.1, replace the current \\\"RiverwoodHouse.esp\\\" file with this updated one.\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a player house just to the southwest of Riverwood.  It is geared toward the warrior type mostly, \r\n\r\nbut still contains all the amenities including alchemy lab and arcane enchanter.\r\n\r\nOutside on the patio area is a forge, grinding wheel, workbench, tanning rack, and a chest to keep items you \r\n\r\nmight want handy for those items.  Also outside on the other side of the house is a smelter.\r\n\r\n\r\nInside are the following:\r\nMain floor...\r\n4 mannequins\r\n16 weapon racks\r\n2 bookshelves (3-shelf type)\r\n2 placques (each holds two swords and one shield)\r\n2 chests (non-respawning)\r\n\r\nDownstairs main room...\r\n1 placque (holds two swords and one shield)\r\n4 more placques (shield only)\r\n7 more mannequins\r\n16 more weapon racks\r\n1 bookshelf (3-shelf type)\r\nArcane enchanter\r\nAlchemy lab\r\n2 chests placed conveniently near enchanter and lab (non-respawning)\r\nSome counters and tables for loose items\r\n\r\nDownstairs anteroom...\r\n2 bookshelves (3-shelf type)\r\n\r\nDownstairs main bedroom...\r\n3 bookshelves (3-shelf type)\r\n2 safes\r\n1 strongbox\r\n1 chest\r\nwardrobes and nightstands (all non-respawning)\r\n\r\nDownstairs guest rooms (2)---each containing...\r\n1 bookshelf (3-shelf type)\r\n1 wardrobe (non-respawning)\r\n1 nightstand (non-respawning)\r\n\r\nDownstairs kitchen (huge)...\r\n1 cooking pot (for cooking)\r\n1 icebox which respawns\r\nA mess of other stuff related to kitchens.\r\n\r\nI did not place a map marker because the Riverwood map marker is so near as to make another marker redundant.\r\n\r\nThe house suffers just a tad from the \\\"Tardis syndrome\\\", but it\\'s not noticeable unless you are specifically \r\n\r\nlooking for it.\r\n\r\nInstalling and uninstalling:\r\nThe mod itself is only one .esp file so installation is just a simple drag-and-drop into your \\\"...skyrim\\\\data\\\\\\\" \r\n\r\nfolder.  To uninstall, delete it.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nA big thanks to Andrew Clements for assists on the kitchen and getting the bookshelves to work properly.\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\nNo permissions or credits are necessary; So feel free to use this however you want.  All of the content of the \r\n\r\nmod is actually in the game already.  I just duplicated and re-arranged things to make this mod.",
