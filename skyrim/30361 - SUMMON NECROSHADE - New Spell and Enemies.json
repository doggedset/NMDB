  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wanted to play a necromancer but don\\'t feel like running around looking for dead bodies?  Introducing the Necroshade!  This handy conjuration will do all the dirty work, reanimating the dead to fight at your side, leaving you free to do other necromancer things, like catch butterflies... er, \\\"deviously trap vile insects\\\".\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a Expert level Conjuration Spell \\\"Summon Necroshade\\\" that will raise the dead to fight for you.  It also adds a variety of Shades to the dungeons of Skyrim and alters the vanilla spell \\\"Conjure Familiar.\\\"\r\n\r\nRequirements: Skyrim, latest update.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1/25/2013: v1.1 is out.  Added a master level spell \\\"Summon Ancient Shade\\\" which permanently conjures an Ancient Shade, he will raise dead, summon his own Necroshades, and cast shock spells.  The Spell Tome has been added to the shade drop list, keep hunting shades until you find one.\r\nv1.1a is identical to v1.1 but I\\'ve removed the change to the familiar, howl away wolf lovers.  Use only one file.\r\n\r\nPlans: Right now I\\'m experimenting with quests and dialog, in the future I may add a short quest to obtain the master spell.  I\\'m still seeking feedback on balance, also feel free to suggest new locations for Shade spawns.\r\n[img]http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/023/2/c/1_by_stickyninjaz-d5sg0ct.png[/img]\r\nThe Necroshade can raise 2 very powerful dead bodies, but it only makes use of Twin Souls about half the time, Skyrim AI isn\\'t always the brightest. The default duration without any perks is 5 minutes, that way the Necroshade wont disappear while it\\'s zombies are still alive.  It will also cast Lightning Bolt so it has something to do when there\\'s nothing to reanimate.\r\n\r\nThe Spell Tome to learn Summon Necroshade is found as random loot from dead Shades, the only guaranteed drop is in Ustengrav (where you go to retrieve and return the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller) just be prepared for a fight.\r\n[img]http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/023/8/2/2_by_stickyninjaz-d5sg0ce.png[/img]\r\nI changed the Familiar because I was bored of the wolf spirit and its a better fit with the new shades, it\\'s an easy change in the CK and I can make a version without it if it bothers people.\r\n\r\nShades can be found in a handful of dungeons (mostly Draugr tombs) there\\'s one in the Whiterun Hall of the Dead, the rest you\\'ll have to find on your own.  Shade variations scale in difficulty, most encounters should be about on par with boss level Draugr (seeking feedback on balance).  \r\n[img]http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/023/4/f/3_by_stickyninjaz-d5sg0c9.png[/img]\r\n[img]http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2013/023/8/e/4_by_stickyninjaz-d5sg0by.png[/img]\r\n[img]http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/023/c/0/5_by_stickyninjaz-d5sg0bp.png[/img]\r\nCredits: Bethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit, the Nexus community for inspiration.\r\n\r\nPermission: This is a Nexus exclusive, do not upload any part of it elsewhere.
