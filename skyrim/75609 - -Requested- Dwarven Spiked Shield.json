Okay then here we go....\r<br />My name is Alkarath a noob-ish mod developer... or somthing like that.\r<br />I started modding begin 2016 with no prior knowledge, and taught myself most of modding by failing miseribly countless of times, watching tutorials and bothering experienced modders with questions.\r<br />This is my second mod and like i said it is of lower quality than what i am capable of doing.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[About the Mod]\r<br />\r<br />I finished this project within one day, granted i invested in multiple new programs to make mods i&#39;d figure it would not be that bad of an idea to practice a bit. So killing 2 birds with one stone, (Not really i&#39;d never do that... those poor birds) i decided to make a requested shield.\r<br />The shield can be crafted at any forge with dwarven smithing.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[Dwarven Spiked Shield]\r<br />\r<br />Value: 150\r<br />Type: Light\r<br />Weight: 3.0\r<br />Armor: 15\r<br />Recipe:\r<br />Steel ingots: 2\r<br />Leather strips: 5\r<br />Temper:\r<br />Steel Ingot: 1\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you want me to make a slightly bigger version and/or one with better stats tell me in the comments, as right now the stats and size are based upon the requested ones.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[Programs used]\r<br />\r<br />3dsMax 2015\r<br />Quixel suite 2\r<br />Photoshop CC 2015\r<br />Nifskope\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Hope you enjoy&#33;",
