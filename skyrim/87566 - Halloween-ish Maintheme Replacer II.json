  "descriptionHtml": "[center][u][i]Hey there,[/i][/u]\r<br />here we go, Intro Replacer for the month of October. \r<br />A little halloween-ish track, fitting for those dark and gruesome days of the year.\r<br />[s]Muhahahah[/s](insert evil laugh)....\r<br />\r<br />[i][u]Disclaimer:[/u][/i]\r<br />I&#39;m sure a lot of you guys are probably saying, why in the Hell would anybody want to replace Skyrim&#39;s Soundtrack&#33;?\r<br />And you are actually 100% right. In fact i couldn&#39;t agree more.\r<br />What Jeremy Soule wrote for this Game is nothing else, but a Masterwork&#33;\r<br />But, even the greatest Tune out there can get a bit too familiar, if you hear it a 1000 Times.\r<br />And since this Mod will only replace the Intro Song, i thought i&#39;ll give it a try.\r<br />\r<br />Here is a Link to my Youtube Channel, for those who care.\r<br />\r<br />https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6y_H_0vomknkEM-SbgGVOQ\r<br />\r<br />As always, enjoy the game everyone. You&#39;ll hear from me.\r<br />\r<br />P.S. Since some of you asked me, i will turn this Series into a mod that actually adds\r<br />my music to the existing one, once i have writen enough. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/center]",
