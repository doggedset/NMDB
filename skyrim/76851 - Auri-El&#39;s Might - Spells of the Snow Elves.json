  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds two new spells centered around Auri-El, or Auriel. They can be found on the body of Arch-Curate Vyrthur, and are powerful, so as to reflect the might of a god. The spells and their effects are listed below.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][u]Judgement of Auri-El[/u]:\r<br />This spell inflicts a base sun damage of 300 to undead targets within a set range. The explosion will cause any remaining undead to flee for 120 seconds. It costs 974 magicka to cast.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Strength of Auri-El[/u]:\r<br />This spell heals a living ally for a base amount of 300. This will also heal them for a base amount of 300 points of Stamina if you have the respite perk. It costs 371 magicka to cast.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I plan on adding a spell that summons one of the priests of Auri-El as a familiar. I also have other plans to add several other spells to this set in due time. If you would like to suggest some spells then I would love to hear them. I am accepting ideas for any of the 5 schools of magic, but they must be centered around Auri-El or his disciples.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Suggested Mods:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54059/?]Snow Elf Race - The True Falme[/url]r by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5197798/?]Hallgarth[/url] to further your role-playing experience.",
