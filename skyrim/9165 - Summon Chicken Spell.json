  "descriptionHtml": "== Change Log ==\r\n\r\n1.0 : added the spell.\r\n1.1 : added appropriate sound on casting and a neat fire shader so that your foes know that it\\'s not a regular pet.\r\n1.2 : fixed the archive so that the script is correctly included. I even put the source file!\r\n\r\n== Summary ==\r\n\r\nAllows the summoning of a horrible hellbeast, a cold killer... The unholy deadly chicken. This gallinaceous can kill those who attack it by convincing them mentally that they don\\'t deserve to live.\r\n\r\n== Where can I get the spell ? ==\r\nThe book that teaches the spell can be bought randomly in spellsellers\\' shops, and a copy is at the Sleeping Giant Inn, at Riverwood. It\\'s an Expert Conjuration Spell, so you may not be able to cast it. \r\n[b]If you just want the spell without hassle or restrictions, open the console and type :\r\nplayer.addspell 02001d8f[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n== Final note ==\r\nIt\\'s a cheat mod, born from a joke with a friend, so don\\'t expect too much from it. It was merely an excuse to learn Papyrus with a simple script. If I managed to make you laugh, my objective is complete. :)\r\nI don\\'t think I will update it, but if you have any idea to improve it, I would be glad to implement it!\r\n",
