So of course they show no behaviour like attack, fly, eat, rest or the like. Their only purpose is to add to the atmosphere. \r<br />\r<br />=============================\r<br />\r<br />There are male and female duck meshes and one mesh for the swans. \r<br />Each of them comes with 2 different animation paths (I used the salmon animation paths as a base for these).\r<br />\r<br />In the CK you can add them as activators or as flora (indeed flora, like the salmon and the coin purse ...)\r<br />\r<br />Simply drop them on the water surface but make sure that you don&#39;t place them on mist or fog markers or they will float in the air. \r<br />\r<br />=============================\r<br />New in Version 1.1:\r<br />\r<br />Ducklings\r<br />Duck family (= female duck with ducklings moving around) \r<br />Duck&#39;s nest\r<br />Duck&#39;s egg\r<br />\r<br />Reduced movement speed for all objects\r<br />\r<br />=============================\r<br />Credits: \r<br />\r<br />Kaizit (=Stesha) for making the models and textures\r<br />The Niftools team for giving us Nifskope.\r<br />Skyfox from the Niftools team for his great tool NifUtils\r<br />Bethesda for the TES games \r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />\r<br />This is a modder&#39;s resource.You may use the meshes and textures for your own mods as long as you give credit to the authors, including a link to this resource and you do not charge money for it.\r<br />\r<br />Do not upload to other sites.\r<br />\r<br />=================",
