  "descriptionHtml": "WHAT IT IS: \r\n\r\nThis mod includes a fairly good sized tomb called Gravkammir and a short quest. I won\\'t bother spending any time explaining what\\'s in the tomb or what the quest involves since you\\'d probably rather experience it for yourself than read about it :) \r\n\r\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND IT: \r\n\r\n-Gravkammir can be found by following the road southeast past Valthume. \r\n-The questgiver can be found at the small farmhouse on the northeast end of Rorikstead, just behind the wheatfield. \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCHANGES \r\n\r\nAPRIL 18: \r\n-Moved the entrance of Gravkammir so it doesn\\'t conflict with the entrance of Arkngthamz. Thanks to NoOneSpecial for pointing that out. \r\n-Uploaded a different screenshot which shows the new location. \r\n\r\nJUNE 12: \r\n- Changed Otah to a Warlock \r\n- Changed Mordram to Ranged \r\n- Increased difficulty of the boss encounter \r\n- Fixed items that couldn\\'t be picked up \r\n- Added more clutter and detail to some areas \r\n\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time working on this mod so I hope you all enjoy it. Any feedback is welcome and would be much appreciated! Let me know if you find any issues and I\\'ll do my best to fix them. \r\n\r\nNO DLC REQUIRED \r\n\r\nPlease endorse if you enjoy! \r\n\r\nAlso available on the Steam Workshop.",
