  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b]Psiijic Master Outfits\r\nVersion 1.2[/b][/center]\r\n\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\n1. Description\r\n\r\n\tI really liked zackdip\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1854]Psiijic Re-Skin several versions[/url] textures for\r\n\tthe Psiijic robes. However they were replacers for the vanilla Psiijic robes, which I would like to keep intact as much as\r\n\tpossible, they were only obtainable through the console and only one could be active at once.\r\n\r\n\tThis mod fixes that by making all of zackdip\\'s versions available through crafting(smithing) without replacing vanilla textures\r\n\tand even adds leather versions of each. The hoods don\\'t use the circlet slot so feel free to use circlets with them.\r\n\r\n\tNOTE: The Black, Blue, Red and Yellow sets had the same boots textures so don\\'t be alarmed when you don\\'t find blue, red or\r\n\tyellow boots. Just take the Black (Leather) Psiijic boots and you\\'ll be fine. Same goes for Black and White gloves. Also I\r\n\tam not good with textures at all so don\\'t bother asking me to make retextures. If someone is willing to make some be my\r\n\tguest, although, if you use zackdip\\'s files as basis you should ask him.\r\n\r\n\tAlso if you like the textures please endorse zackdip\\'s file since it\\'s his work, I just compiled them into a non-replacer mod.\r\n\r\n[b]There is a French translation [url=http://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/skyrim/mods/armurerie/armures/armure_psijic.php]here[/url][/b]\r\n\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\n2, Installation\r\n\r\n\t2.1 Manual Installation\r\n\r\n\t\ta.

Sorting\r\n\r\n\tThese files should be placed in the same order you place other mods that add items and clothing or armour. \r\n\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\n4. Known Issues\r\n\r\n\t-The elven ears slightly pop out of the sides of the hood. It\\'s a mesh issue. The hood might need a bit broadening up to fit the ears but it\\'s not something I can do and it might make it look even stranger. be my guest in fixing the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\n5.
