  "descriptionHtml": "Illusory Shapeshift\r\n===============================================================\r\n\r\nThis mod adds some very powerful new spells to the game. The caster becomes invisible and summons an alias for a periode of time.\r\nThese spells are perfect to escape complicated situations or to lure all enemys in one place while sneeking into an advantage position.\r\nThe problem with normal shapeshift is, if you\\'re a bear, you\\'re a bear! \r\nLooks cool but is increadibly hard to balance in combat, as every werewolf will know. So this is another approach.\r\n!!All spell require Illusion level 50!!\r\n\r\nYou can obtain these spells by crafting the spell tomes.\r\nThis is done at the tanning rack by using the following ingredients:\r\n- 1 Roll of Paper\r\n- 1 Filled Grand Soul Gem\r\n- 1 Nirnroot (for Invisibility effect)\r\n- the essence of the alias (eg Sabrecat: 1 Sabrecat pelt, 1 Sabrecat eye)\r\n\r\nIf u r lazy u can buy em at Drevis Whatshisface, the illusion guy at college.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummons:\r\n- Bear\r\n- Sabrecat\r\n- Spriggan\r\n- Hagraven\r\n- Mammoth\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This is just a peak on one of the features of my upcoming mod \\'Black Magic\\', a counterpart to \\'Black Alchemy\\':\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10329\r\n\r\n\r\nAs usual, compatible with everything.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n-\tCopy file to skyrim/Data folder manually or via mod-manager.\r\n-\tActivate file via launcher or mod-manager.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n-\tDeactivate file via launcher or mod-manager.\r\n-\tDelete file from skyrim/Data folder manually or via mod-manager.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\nJoe316\r\n\r\n",
