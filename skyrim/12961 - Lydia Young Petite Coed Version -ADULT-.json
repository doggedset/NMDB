  "summary": "My version of Lydia, not everyone\\'s taste but if you like petite cuties have at it! Updated 06/11/12. I increased her weight on slider to 45 so that she may work a little better for those using ADEC, UNPB AND CBBE with BBP. She should work with all bodies now, perks and spells also adjusted. ",

(She is still an A-B cup though and still petite!!!)\r\nHair: Ranger/Hunter and Spartan versions use \\\"Hair packs of TES IV Oblivion\\\" and Classic and Earthy versions use \\\"ApachiiSkyHair\\\"\r\nPetit at 45 Weight and Height .97 Nord Skin-tone #2\r\nFace: *Bella Female Faces: Makeup 1 with optional Bella\\'s No Shine and No Shine by Glosstech for her body. (really removes those seams!)\r\nEyes: *Natural Eyes by nevenbridge and *RANs Eyeliner Replacer by RAN46\r\n[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[b]::::Obliivion Hair Pack Fix::::\r\nFix for those having issues with Oblivion Hairs: \r\n\r\nWhen using \\\"Hair packs of TES IV Oblivion\\\" you need the older files: Hair Pack 1 dot 1 and Hair Pack ESM file 1 dot 1 (do not use the others) I found this is the only working version as far as being able to make them work with my PC and NPC\\'s. Load order is very important. You must have the Oblivion hairs installed first and then install ApachiiSkyhair. If you do not have them in the right order you will get a hairline clash on the first 7 to 9 Oblivion hairs. I would recommend that you save both files to your PC/Downloads because who knows if the author will come back and wipe out his mod files one day. Also do not mess with PART TWO of his hair packs!!! Please just use the two files mentioned above! \r\n\r\nInstallation: Install the TESIV Hairpack through NMM and download the ESM into your Downloads file and unzip it. (The reason for this is that when you have finished the manual portion of this install the NMM will work for removal.) Then download the file manually place the ESM file into your Skyrim Data folder. I truly believe that you still need the ESM even if you aren\\'t modding characters. (At least with his mod). I would also make sure that the esp is in your plugin list. \r\nYou need to go back and install the Hair Pack portion of his mod manually. The reason for this is that the author did not path these files to textures and meshes he only zipped all the folders together (He should have removed the NMM option and just stated that these needed to be installed manually). If you create characters you still need to have Oblivion Hairs file folder in the meshes main folder. (When you click on meshes in the Data Folder you should see a folder that says Oblivion Hairs. You should also see a folder in your main Skyrim Data file that says Oblivion Hairs)\r\n\r\nJust make sure you copy and paste each folder so that it rests next to the Apachii Hair file in both your Skyrim Data Meshes and Textures folders. Try your game now! I haven\\'t had any issues since I figured this out. \r\n1. C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\\\\hair\r\n2. C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\hair\r\n\r\nNote: You cant run Apachii, Oblivion and Fallout hairs at the same time (too many hairs for the game to handle). It could also possibly break your game[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color= RED][size= 3]If you are having neckline issues please remember to make sure you set her weight and height via console so that she appears properly. I. E. Click on her then type in console, setnpcweight 45 and setscale .97... This is typical when you are changing an in-game characters physical attributes. You will  also need to restart your Skyrim game for the weight/scale changes to take effect.[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[b][color= Ghostwhite][size= 2]\r\nAs always thank you for checking out my mods and if you like her please please please endorse her! :)\r\n\r\nFalmerBane[/b][/color][/size]",
