  "summary": "Ever wanted to look like the Dragon Born from the trailers? But the armor wasn\\'t protecting well or weapons where doing nothing to enemy npcs? ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod. Armor and weapons are found in Bannered Mare in Whiterun, you will need to steal them too. Sword and shield are to the left of the hearth. Armor is up the stairs to the left. A wall did disappear but it\\'s not game changeing. V.2 the armor has the same stats as dragon bone. V.2 armor is in your room at the Bannered Mare. 2 swords available one is regular, the other only dismembers on kills. V.2 is now all heavy armor.\r\n\r\nWarning:( V.1 is recommended for people who want a heroic experience only. The Armor Rating is 100 on all items, all items have an enchantment.)\r\n\r\nInstallation: Just download and copy it to C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data make sure the box is checked to load before running game.\r\n\r\nBugs: V.1Not sure of any bugs yet(besides the invisible wall). Shouldn\\'t conflict with \r\nDawnguard or any mods.   \r\nV.2 No bugs at all.",
