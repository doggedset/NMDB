  "descriptionHtml": "Seeing that there was interest in Triss\\'s armor I thought of creating a character based on Triss.\r\nThis is the closest we can get to a Triss look like character with the vanilla character creator,so until some mods with new eye shapes or hair styles comes out,it\\'s the best it can get.\r\nThe race chosen is obviously a Breton,and the save is very early on the game,so you can skill up your character the way you want.\r\nWhen mods with new assets come out,and if some of those new assets can be used to make Skyrim\\'s Triss look more like Witcher\\'s Triss,I will ask permission to use them so I can update the file \r\noffering a more look alike character.\r\nUntil then have fun! :D\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nPlace the save file at your Skyrim saves directory.\r\nIt usually is in Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Saves\r\n\r\nRecommended mods:\r\nCoverwoman\r\nAOF Believable Hair -Female and Male",
