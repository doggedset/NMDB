  "descriptionHtml": "*Endorse if you like ^.^ :D*\r\n\r\n**Version Update 2.0** Simply delete the old file and replace with the new one, also it does not work with mpdoughts http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8819 as they both do a replace on the nord hero bow : the primary difference is that mine edits the dmg values as well\r\n\r\n**Main Info Section**\r\nI always felt that the Nord Hero Weapons weren\\'t as up to snuff as they should be based on what you had to accomplish to be able to get them\r\n\r\nSo rather than them having the same damage ratings as Elven weapons, I have up-scaled em to ebony quality\r\n\r\nmain reason I\\'ve done this is because they are my favourite weapon types but I didn\\'t want to make them more powerful than ebony , daedric or dragon bone (obviously I could upload different versions of the weapons with varying damage levels)\r\n\r\nI have also reduced the weight of each Nord Hero weapon by 2 points\r\n\r\nadded 4 images showcasing the default bow and sword (they have been upgraded to legendary but you get the idea) and images showing the upscaled version of the bow and sword\r\n\r\n_______*Notes*__________\r\nThe different textures on the weapons are from Trassk\\'s  REAL Nord Hero Weapons Retex http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20791/\r\n\r\n______*Compatibility*_________\r\nShouldn\\'t conflict with anything as its only a replacer for the Nord hero weapons and it shouldn\\'t effect the quest \\\"Silenced Tongues\\\" in Volunruud .\r\n\r\nNot compatible with mpdoughts http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8819 as mine and his mod are both replacer files, while his simply edits the noise level on the bow (which is an error on bethesda\\'s part), I also edit the damage values to ebony quality (version 2.0 now includes the silent nord hero bow)",
