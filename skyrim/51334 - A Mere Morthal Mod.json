  "descriptionHtml": "This mod aims to give the city of Morthal a more distinct look as well as adding a few new features. \r<br />\r<br />I changed the textures of the buildings in Morthal to make them look as if the were made of stone. Also, it seemed strange to me that every house had a fireplace but none of them had a chimney, so I added some. And moreover I wanted to make the Jarl&#39;s house and guard house look a bit more fortified.\r<br />\r<br />Included so far:\r<br />- Retextured all buildings and interiors\r<br />- Added a few new buildings (Towers, General Store) with interiors\r<br />- Added chimneys to the rooftops\r<br />- Fortified the Jarl&#39;s Hall and the Guardhouse\r<br />\r<br />Planned:\r<br />- A few new NPCs (Primarily for the store)\r<br />\r<br />Known issues:\r<br />- Stone texture on the roofs underside\r<br />\r<br />The mod is currently in a very early development stage and therefore I strongly advise against using it in your normal gameplay yet.",
