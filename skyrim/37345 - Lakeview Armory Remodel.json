  "summary": "(Another) Remodel of the armory in Lakeview Manor. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Cleaned with TES5Edit 3.0.30\r\nFully navmeshed\r\n\r\nUse only if you built the armory on the east wing of Lakeview Manor. The other two options won\\'t work.\r\nPlease remove all your stored stuff from the armory before installing this mod.\r\n\r\nThis changes the armory slightly. The layout is similar to the vanilla one, with a few changes.\r\n\r\n- Removed the Grindstone, Workbench and Tanning rack\r\n- Added 3 mannequins, so there are 8 in total\r\n- There are two weapon racks with five slots each\r\n- Four weapon plaques, two normal and two that can take a shield\r\n- Plenty of storage (in my opinion) with 6 chests and 4 wardrobes. There\\\\\\'s an empty barrel as well.\r\n- Four dagger displays and 2 weapon display cases.\r\n- Wood floors\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nDrop the esp in you data folder\r\n\r\n[B]Requirements:[/B]\r\n\r\nHearthfire\r\n\r\n[B]Compatibility:[/B]\r\n\r\n\r\nWill clash only with something else already on that wing. You can install it even if you have built everything in the armory. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know of any oddities outside on the armory roof. The furniture there is also replaced.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda\r\n\r\n",
