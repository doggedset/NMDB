Three of them are the major constellations, known as the [b]guardians[/b]. These are the Warrior, the Mage and the Thief. Each of the guardians protects its three charges from the thirteenth constellation, the Serpent.\r<br />\r<br />When the sun rises near one of the constellations, it is that constellation&#39;s season. Each constellation has a season of approximately one month. The Serpent has no season, for it moves about in the heavens, usually threatening one of the other constellations. \r<br />\r<br />Which constellation were you born under?\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/14551534-1406889285.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/56644-1-1407042314.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />The Apprentice&#39;s season is Sun&#39;s Height. Those born under the sign of the Apprentice have a special affinity for magic of all kinds, but aren&#39;t healthy and not agitated as well.\r<br />\r<br />The Apprentice offers a slightly risky option for mages who find themselves running out of magicka too frequently, or for battlemages who don&#39;t want to lose armor protection for magicka regeneration from mage robes.\r<br />\r<br />The Apprentice is located at the middle of Hjaalmarch and Haafingar.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/14551534-1406872031.png[/img] [color=lightblue][b]Gift of Magnus[/b][/color]\r<br />Gives 100 extra points of magicka and recover magicka 50% faster, as health and stamina recover 25% slower. \r<br />\r<br />[right][i]&#34;Today the Apprentice shall serve you at the forge of destiny.&#34;[/i][/right]\r<br />\r<br />[i]NB: The Apprentice stone was the most arguably best given effect for a quick death against spellcaster. When in combat, magicka is always regenerate like a crap, although you&#39;re already wearing the most expensive mage robes. Now, how about the weakness to magic? Will it be reduced?[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/56644-2-1407042315.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />The Atronach, or the Golem, is one of the Mage&#39;s charges. Its season is Sun&#39;s Dusk. Those born under this sign are the natural sorcerers with deep reserves of magicka, but they cannot regenerate magicka as usual.\r<br />\r<br />The Atronach benefits of two of the best combination between huge magicka pool and passive spell absorption with a drawback of halved magicka regeneration.\r<br />\r<br />The Atronach is located at the far south of Eastmarch.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/14551534-1406872031.png[/img] [color=lightblue][b]Arcana Corruption[/b][/color]\r<br />Gives 150 extra points to magicka, 30% spell absorption and -50% magicka regeneration.\r<br />\r<br />[right][i]&#34;Today the Atronach shall aid you with your appointed burden.&#34;[/i][/right]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/56644-3-1407042315.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />The Lady is one of the Warrior&#39;s charges and her season is Hearthfire.
