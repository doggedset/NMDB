Weight: 100 Height: 1 Level: 1(hoping to change that soon)\r\n\r\nNot custom voice acted.\r\n\r\nOn the northernmost edge of Skyrim exists a mountain tribe renowned for producing fearsome Bandits. Wielding greataxes and known as warriors, these men and women learn to harness their inner-beasts and translate that power to unbridled savagery on the battlefield.\r\nIn former times which saw war waged ceaselessly in Tamriel, the warriors featured prominently on the frontlines of battle. With the arrival of peacetime, however, their art has descended into the shadows of obscurity, where it remains to this day. ",
