  "summary": "turn your mountains of useless jewels into enchanted gems for your mage playthrough: \r<br />the geode binder lets you use your enchanting skills to turn jewels into wardstones, or shields that cast a ward, and then enchant it further to give resistance to magic and magicka boosts.",
  "descriptionHtml": "yes, this is exactly like my other geode binder mod, only I got rid of the soul gem fragment spells and made this altar focus solely on wardstones.\r<br />\r<br />[b]what this mod does:\r<br />\r<br />It adds a geode binder: a small altar found in hela&#39;s folly, a shipwreck found next to yngvild, with the scavenger deekus who you eventually kill for a dark brotherhood side quest.\r<br />\r<br />the binder lets you craft 6 variations of gems, each with 5 potential enchantments, for a total of 30 enchanted gems, and one more hidden gem\r<br />\r<br />to craft the gems:\r<br />\r<br />you will need one ore, one jewel and one filled petty soul gem for the most basic gems. example:\r<br />\r<br />Ruby Wardstones require: one ruby, one corundum ore, and one filled petty soul gem.\r<br />Sapphire wardstones require: sapphire, moonstone ore, one filled petty soul gem.\r<br />amethysts require amethyst, oricalchum ore, filled petty soul gem...... you get the picture.\r<br />emeralds require malachite, diamonds require quicksilver, and garnets require iron.\r<br />\r<br />[/b]what they do:\r<br />\r<br />they&#39;re basically shields that give no protection other than a ward and one more enchantment. example\r<br />the amethyst wardstone gives a 10 point ward and a 5% resistance to shock. obviously this is a weak enchantment because it is the weakest variant.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]the higher your enchanting skill, the further you can improve the enchantments.[/u][/b] eventually you will need stronger filled soul gems and at the highest variant, you will need a flawless gem.\r<br />\r<br />the jewels will appear in the crafting menu if you have the high enchanting skill and the required crafted jewel\r<br />example:\r<br />\r<br />amethyst wardstone will appear only if you have the required ore, petty soul gem, and a normal amethyst.\r<br />amethyst bauble is the stronger form, will appear if you have a lesser soul gem, a normal amethyst, the amethyst wardstone, and enchanting skill of 25 at least.\r<br />amethyst aegis is the next stronger form, requiring the same as before, only you need a common filled soul gem and enchanting skill of 50...\r<br />amethyst auspices will require enchanting of 75 and a greater soul gem\r<br />the final one: lustrous amethyst auspices requires 100 enchanting, and grand soul gem\r<br />\r<br />[b]Why I made this mod?\r<br />\r<br />[/b]imagine you are a mage, running low on magicka, fighting another mage who keeps blasting [b]you with fire spells. well, with the ruby wardstone, for example, you get a minor ward free of magicka cost, and some fire resistance. \r<br />I mean think about it: this mod is basically shields for mages. boom. and seeing as there is no such thing a warding staff, this is the next best thing.\r<br />\r<br />besides, the real reason behind this mod is to give a use to all those jewels you find. eventually, by the end game, you will have all these jewels, all these soul gems, and nothing to do with them. this mod lets you waste them, so go nuts XD[/b]   \r<br />\r<br />[i]if you&#39;re good at modding and wanna mess around with this mod, preferrably to give new look to the wardstones, and a new animation for when you block with them, be my guest.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />spoiler, for those who just dont care, I made a hidden jewel that can be crafted. it requires an ebony ore, a black soul gem, 100 enchanting, and the sigil stone to just be in your inventory. it&#39;s pretty powerful, but I balanced it out with a negative magicka regen effect.",
