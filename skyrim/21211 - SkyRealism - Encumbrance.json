Also, send me a PM to contact me quicker if you have problems.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Overview[/heading]Have you ever wondered how the Dragonborn can run around carrying around dozens of weapons, suits of armor, and hundreds of potions...yet when they pick up a flower, they suddenly move at half speed?\r<br />\r<br />I do.\r<br />\r<br />This mod applies bonuses and penalties to the Dragonborn&#39;s speed in 10% increments, based upon their total inventory weight and their warrior skill totals. This is based on the assumption that physically active characters are stronger, and thus able to carry more without being slowed down. This mod is intended to be used in conjunction with the other [color=#87CEEB]Sky[/color][color=#C3B091]Realism[/color] mods that I will be releasing. \r<br />\r<br />[b]LYCANTHROPY: [/b]Werewolves in Beast Form have greatly increased strength, resulting in them being able to run slightly faster.\r<br />\r<br />[b]VAMPIRISM: [/b]Vampires in Vampire Lord form have had all penalties and bonuses completely removed, since they levitate.\r<br />\r<br />Speeds are as follows:\r<br />[list][*]120% speed at 0 units of weight with all skills set to 15.\r<br />[*]100% speed at 80 units of weight with all skills set to 15\r<br />[*]80% speed at 160 units of weight with all skills set to 15.\r<br />[*]60% speed at 240 units of weight with all skills set to 15.\r<br />[*]120% speed at 0 units of weight with all skills set to 100.\r<br />[*]100% speed at 200 units of weight with all skills set to 100.\r<br />[*]80% speed at 400 units of weight with all skills set to 100.\r<br />[*]60% speed at 600 units of weight with all skills set to 100.\r<br />[*]Penalties that reduce you to below 50% speed will cause you to fall over.[/list]\r<br />[heading]Requirements, Installation, and Load Order[/heading][b]REQUIREMENTS: [/b]This mod requires the following other to mods be installed.\r<br />[list][*][url=http://skse.silverlock.org]Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE)[/url][color=#888888] by [b]Ian Patterson, Stephen Abel and Paul Connelly[/b][/color]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.elderscrolls.com/skyrim/add-ons]Dawnguard[/url][color=#888888] by [b]Bethesda Game Studios[/b][/color] (Dawnguard Edition Only)[/list]\r<br />[b]INSTALLATION: [/b]Nexus Mod Manager has (incorrectly) decided that any mod beginning with SkyRealism is the same mod. When installing SkyRealism mods, it may display a message saying: &#34;A different version of SkyRealism - XXX has been detected. The installed version is XXX, the new version is XXX Would you like to upgrade? Selecting No will install the new Mod normally.&#34; You should click &#34;No.&#34;, so that it will install the mod normally. It may give you warnings that certain files will be over-written. You should select &#34;Yes to all&#34; so that it will update any existing files to the latest versions.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Credits and Thanks[/heading]Thanks to Cordsnwires, Elys, Dogtown1, Dragten, Hothtrooper44, Ironman5000, Is this display name taken?, JaySuS, Nikinoodles, Nivea, MECR, Merilia, PrivateEye, theRoadstroker, and Tupii for giving me permission to use their mods as master file requirements for my own mods.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to T3nd0, Cordsnwires, and jjc71 for the suggestions, guidance, and support. Thanks to trainwiz, wobbuvahi, and David Brasher for making the mods that kept me hooked on Skyrim long after it should have lost its appeal. \r<br />\r<br />[heading]Compatibility, Issues, and Troubleshooting[/heading]This mod will conflict with any other mod that (stupidly) assumes the speedmult variable will be 100 at all times.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][b]WARNING:[/b][/color] Make copies of your save files before installing this mod&#33; After uninstalling this mod, you may need to use the following console command to repair changes to existing savegames:\r<br />[code]player.forceav SpeedMult 100[/code]\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Change Log[/heading][b]v1.5:[/b]\r<br />Base Strength increased from 50 to 100. All skill factors set to 0.25, except Heavy Armor (0.5). Movement speed penalty has been reduced by 25%. This should make the game substantially easier at low levels.\r<br />\r<br />[b]v1.4:[/b]\r<br />Strength is now determined by BaseActorSkill instead of ActorSkill, in order to prevent duplicate speed penalties when using this mod in conjunction with SkyRealism - Feast and Famine.\r<br />\r<br />[b]v1.3:[/b]\r<br />Removed encumbrance bonuses and penalties for vampires in Vampire Lord form. \r<br />Greatly increased strength for werewolves in Beast Form.\r<br />\r<br />[b]v1.2:[/b]\r<br />Removed encumbrance effects while mounted. Script now runs once per second to detect player mounting a horse (since there is no OnMount event).\r<br />\r<br />[b]v1.1[/b]\r<br />Encumbrance conditionals have been fixed. It is now possible to reach 120% speed again.\r<br />\r<br />[b]v1.0[/b]\r<br />Converted entire mod over to utilizing spell effects to manipulate the SpeedMult variable. You can now see your penalties and bonuses in the Active Spell Effects section of your spells listing.\r<br />\r<br />[b]v0.3a[/b]\r<br />Fixed a bug preventing script from deactivating when mod was removed.\r<br />\r<br />[b]v0.2a:[/b]\r<br />Added base Strength factor so that the Dragonborn doesn&#39;t feel so weak at level 1:\r<br />SkyRealismEnBaseStrength = 50.0\r<br />\r<br />[b]v0.1a:[/b]\r<br /> Added factors used to calculate Strength based on skills as follows:\r<br /> SkyRealismEnHeavyArmorFactor = 1.5.\r<br /> SkyRealismEnLightArmorFactor = 0.5.\r<br /> SkyRealismEnBlockFactor = 0.5.\r<br /> SkyRealismEnTwoHandedFactor = 0.2.\r<br /> SkyRealismEnOneHandedFactor = 0.1.\r<br /> SkyRealismEnMarksmanFactor = 0.1.\r<br /> SkyRealismEnSmithingFactor = 0.1.\r<br /> Added factors used to calculate Encumbrance based on Strength as follows:\r<br /> SkyRealismEnUnencumberedSpeedBonus set to 20.\r<br /> SkyRealismEnEncumberedSpeedPenalty set to 40.\r<br /> Script added that applies an Encumbrance modifier to SpeedMult, updated whenever the player gains or loses an inventory object.
