This will take longer due to the testing needed. \r\nPlease report any bugs that may occur.    \r\n\r\nWarning: \r\n\r\nThe pets do NOT have a set home location. When you tell them to leave they will stay at that spot. It allows you to put them in your homes or wherever you want. Just remember where you left them! \r\n\r\nMods alter the game, (by design).\r\n\r\nIf you uninstall a mod without dismissing the follower from that mod the game will still think you have a follower and you will be unable to hire another. \r\n\r\nIt is a good practice to make a save before trying new mods and/or save without any of the mod components attached to your character, i.e. Followers, Armor, Zones, Quests, Spells. \r\n\r\nCommand Console: Dismiss Follower (set playerfollowercount to 0)\r\n\r\nChange Log: \r\n11/17/12: 1.0.0; Initial release.\r\n11/23/12: 1.1.0; Added Spirit House.
