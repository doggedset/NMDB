  "descriptionHtml": "Feral Battleaxe\r\n*Quick note: The screenshots I provided feature many different mods, all of which are authored by people other than myself. I only intend to showcase this axe, and not the other mods. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy first serious attempt at a weapon, and I think I\\'ve finally worked out most of the bugs. My knowledge of this stuff is only very basic. \r\n\r\nFeral Battleaxe\r\n-Unique blend of the Headsman axe (blade) Iron battleaxe (handle) and steel war hammer (three rings below blade). \r\n-Requires skyforge to craft, under Elven. \r\n-Requires many ingredients\r\n-Temperable\r\n-Enchantable\r\n-Eleven stats clone. \r\n-Given its shorter length than other battleaxes, the swing speed has been increased slightly. \r\n\r\nI am in part hoping to gain some experience by providing it to people other than me, to help weed out bugs I may not notice, feed back would be super appreciated.
