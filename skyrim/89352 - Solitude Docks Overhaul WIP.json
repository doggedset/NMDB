  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Looking for a partner to get this finished[/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod is designed to make the Solitude docks more interesting and lively.\n<br />\n<br />This mod was Launched on an other Modding site but I feel it can do better here. It's not exactly they kind of mod this other community focused on.\n<br />\n<br />So now I'm bringing the 1.7.0 to Nexus!\n<br />\n<br />About this Mod: \n<br />\n<br />adds 7 new NPCs (including me)\n<br />\n<br />A new faction at the docks\n<br />\n<br />Greatly expanded docks\n<br />\n<br />A new building (The Salty Spriggan)\n<br />\n<br />Expanded the skooma line and reworked some of the existing skooma bottles for diversity\n<br />\n<br />Added a whole new line of \"smoked\" meats and cheeses with new effects and prices\n<br />\n<br />Added a smoke house in the basement of the Salty spriggan.\n<br />\n<br />This version has the most complete nav mesh to date for the docks.\n<br />\n<br />The people of the docks don't really buy into the war and politics that follow. It is neutral ground (or umm Neutral Dock)\n<br />\n<br />The way I see it in the midst of a war places that transport and house goods will thrive! Some things may get misplaced or skooma may happen to find its way a lot easier with all focus on the war.\n<br />\n<br />The Salty Faction:\n<br />Is neutral with the player (until you give them a reason not to be.\n<br />\n<br />Attacking Salty Faction will put you on the wrong side of the law.\n<br />\n<br />Salty faction kill Thalmor, Vampires and Necromancer on escape\n<br />\n<br />NPC: \n<br />Amber the Regent-\n<br /> Me! I run the spriggan sell/ buy and later will rent beds. \n<br />\n<br />El-\n<br />Collage of Winter hold expelled aptitude for alchemy, relaxed and keeps to himself. Some say he is Kin to the current Arch Mage and that may be the reason he was expelled from the university, others say it was because he was openly searching for alternative Skooma recipes.\n<br />\n<br />Kilo-\n<br />Redguard orphan raised by Orcs, ironically both his actual parents and adopted parents were killed by the Thalmor and both times he managed to escape. Amber found him in the reach and took him in and he has never left he side.\n<br />\n<br />Meela-\n<br />An upbeat little Bosmer girl that for some reason is wearing a Psijic robe. She just showed up at the Docks one afternoon and was given the basement of the Spriggan in exchange for her secret of cooking food with an irresistible flavor.\n<br />\n<br />J'Rea &amp; Ra'Keshna-\n<br />2 kahjiit women that camp on the beach.\n<br />\n<br />Ja'Rea is a local resident of Skyrim who ran into Ra'Keshna during her adventures grave robbing.\n<br />\n<br />Ra'Keshna is from Bravil and has been studying the events of the Oblivion Crisis for most of her life.\n<br />\n<br />She believes that the Oblivion crisis and the rise of dragons in Skyrim is not a coincidence. So she came to investigate \n<br />\n<br />She believes that the Thalmor played a direct hand in Mankar Cameron's actions during the Oblivion crisis to deal a fatal blow to the Empire and the same is about to happen in Skyrim. She wears a Mythic Dawn robe as a reminder of all the people who died and as a slap in the face to the Thalmor.\n<br />\n<br />Griffen and Kingston-\n<br />One believes in the empire the other believes in Skyrim. But serve as guards in the spriggan to keep the peace. They are childhood friends and both agree that protecting life is better than taking it even if they do not agree on the future of Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />About me: I am no good with quests or dialog (yet) so if someone likes the mod and wants to lend a hand to get it finished I would be very happy.\n<br />\n<br />I need to get these NPCs on an AI schedule and all dialog options working. I need to add a few more NPCs to run the stalls on the Tri Dock.\n<br />\n<br />What's to come:\n<br />V2.0 NPCs will be nerfed and most made non essential.\n<br />\n<br />More clutter\n<br />\n<br />Fix spriggan lighting.\n<br />\n<br />More fine tuning to Nav Mesh\n<br />\n<br />AI packages for NPCs and dialogue.\n<br />\n<br />There's a lot to get done\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />If anyone wants to help I would be very happy to share the credit.\n<br />\n<br />New ideas welcome too.\n<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<br />V1.8.1\n<br />\n<br />New Heavy Water weapons exclusive to the Salty faction. (I know about the normal issue on the 2h axe and dagger, looking for a fix) New wold space Shimmer Death Grotto (inaccessible) for now. New Shield \"Shield of the Dragonborn\"(Testing phase) hidden in a Morrowind barrel. East Empire Co Balcony Upgrade. [img]https://www.loverslab.com/resources/emoticons/wink.png[/img] Cleaned up with TES5Edit. NPCs Needed and made non essential, quest items removed. Enjoys!",
