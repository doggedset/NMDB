  "descriptionHtml": "I'm sure many of you have heard of the mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40607]Undeath[/url]﻿ by Antioch08. It adds a questline involving stopping the emergence of a lich, and provides the opportunity to become one yourself. However, while the questline doesn't begin until level 30, it just shows up in the journal out of the blue without warning.\n<br />\n<br />I personally found this immersion-breaking, so I made this plug-in to \"fix\" it. With this plug-in, the Undeath questline will begin through a letter from Illia, delivered after completing the quest \"Repentence\" and the usual level 30, as opposed to being thrown at you.\n<br />\n<br />This obviously requires Undeath, and from what I can tell, should work with lich overhauls just fine. So long as the first quest in Undeath isn't touched, it will play fine with this plug-in.",
