I'm just gonna throw the set [b]I [/b]made away because they are so much better!!!\"\n<br />No. I don't. Because let's be honest, those sets are a bit... well a tad... who are we kidding, they [/size][color=#00ffff][size=4][b]suck[/b][/size][/color][size=3]!\n<br />\n<br />Most the sets' items have only one enchantment which you can get a better one even at level 50 enchantment.\n<br />\n<br />This mod's intent is to change the overall usage of the items from the various crime guilds - The Thieves Guild, The Dark Brotherhood &amp; The Nightingales.[/size]",
