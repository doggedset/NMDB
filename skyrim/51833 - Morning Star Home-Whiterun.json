  "summary": "A new home in Whiterun behind the Talos Statue. Lots of storage, mannequins, and weapon shields racks. All three dlc is required. TMPhoenix mod compatible.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is Morning star, a player home that is compatible with TMPhoenixs script for allowing custom homes to be compatible for adopting.\r<br />\r<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoSBwNiPDY\r<br />\r<br />My mod is the second, also check out his other videos as well.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]Requirments\r<br />[/size][color=#ffffff]Dawnguard- for some decorative resources and alchemy storage, and shrine.\r<br />Dragonborn- for decorative resources and alchmy storage.\r<br />Hearthfire- For adoption, and furniture.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#cc0000][size=3]CHANGELOG::::::::PLEASE READ:::::::Remove all items before updating:::::FROM Version 1&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][color=#ffffff][size=4]8.0:::Normal and Light Fix\r<br />[size=2]Redid the both interior stairs to accustom the stone walls, retweaked the walls and made sure all plaques are in order, added a sconce outside for night time. Updated the light fix since many are using other light source mods, so I dimmed them down.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Vamp-7.0\r<br />[size=2]-Added a few more torches and fixed jail cell door, I swear everytime I feel its all set something moved for no reason at all.[/size]\r<br />Vamp-6.6\r<br />[size=2]Added a couple quick things, map marker, and torches outside.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />6.5::: Vampire Overhaul fix::::\r<br />[size=2]-started from scratch with the vampire theme,moved to Morthal. I experienced freezes during my game and FPS loss. So I took the normal Morning Star and redid the vampire theme again and is working now.\r<br />Only bug may be the children runawaying to Whiterun outside but have not fully tested. You can only download one file even though in two separate locations. Redid the deck and now looks more lovely. Check screen shot.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=2]6.0::::New Vampire Overhaul::::: (Disabled, My game froze at certain points)[/size]\r<br />[/size][/color][size=2]-Moved The home from and cleaned up whiterun, New Location is near Morthal, east of Movarths lair (Check Screenshots)\r<br />-Old version is outdated with minor tweaks as holes in the walls, and décor placement\r<br />-Blood splatters are deleted (Giving credit to user ashleyclark, for this, thanks for the support)\r<br />-Changed the childrens coffins back to beds as kids were not using them, when sleeping.[/size]\r<br />-Changed the keys up a bit, the jail key now works the trap door in Dragons reach that is still there as a secret entrance. The secret door key in the Amory has been moved, and now works for the jail door as well. (Check new screenshots for new location)\r<br />-Removed door to Companions hall as house moved&#33;&#33;\r<br />-Added the key to Movarths Lair as well its in the room with the last vampire before leaving. In a strongbox (Check images)\r<br />----Bugs,\r<br />1) Right now a weapon plaque where companions hall door was is not working, I might replace.\r<br />2) When asking the children to play, I think they run all the way to whiterun, as I only followed her to Morthal during testing. This is due to the house location ref I believe which I got to change at some point. I played with it and fixed stuff but needs more testing. \r<br />3) Also with the house move, you still cant download the normal version as I did not Upload a separate cell for the armory. I renamed the cell 000morningstarVampire, but not the armory cell. So you will receive a CTD.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]5.5[/size]\r<br />-Fixed up wall décor placements with new walls. \r<br />-Added a chandelier to the kitchen\r<br />-Added a ramp to the bath house to fix gap between floors\r<br />-Also did the same for the vampire theme as well\r<br />\r<br />5.0\r<br />Vampire theme added as a main file.\r<br />-Changes beds to Coffins\r<br />-Changes to lighting with a red tint\r<br />-Added Gargoyles inside and outside of home\r<br />-Added Blood splatters throughout the home.\r<br />-Changed living room fountain into Molag bal shrine\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]My Other Mods:::::\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36517/?]Head Under Head gear[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48619/?]Starburst- A player Horse[/url][/size][/color]\r<br />[/color][/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58671/?]Blood-Stalker Cave (Hideout)[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54403/?]Barbarian Camp[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Recommendations:\r<br />Pretty Male and female mannequins, by Sandrniks- if used will make HALF the mannequins female instead of all wood male.\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21117/?\r<br />\r<br />Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions by TMPhoenix- For allowing the custom home to be compatible for adoption. *Just to let you know only two children can be adopted and have the beds, you can adopt more, but the others will not use the beds, as they are owned by the first two.\r<br />\r<br />Lots of Storage, plenty of shield racks and weapon racks.\r<br />A separate cell for the armory with a secret door.\r<br />Daedric corner in armory.\r<br />An alternate way to the east side of Whiterun, that goes through Dragonsreach Dungeon.\r<br />A bathhouse/ steamroom.\r<br />Followers beds, &#34;recommended to use my home is your home mod&#34;\r<br />\r<br />To get inside, there is a strongbox on the right of the house, scale the wall, to find it inbedded in the boulders. (Master Locked)\r<br />\r<br />The traditional way is to go through the dungeon, if you have to go to jail, turn left to the dead end to find a strongbox, this key will unlock the jail way to the armory.\r<br />\r<br />In the jail is a strongbox with the secret door key, which will unlock two doors, one being the trap door in the dungeon, the other a secret door in the armory.\r<br />\r<br />There is another main key for the front door and pool side, inside the house if you go the jailside way. Right next to the front door and coat rack. In the strongbox.\r<br />\r<br />Plus a storage key for two safes and wardrobes in the armory.\r<br />\r<br />BUGS:\r<br />None really except for mannequin issues, but if you go outside and then back in they will reset, plus use some of the mannequin fix mods out there too. This only happens if you wait, or save and load you game the next save in the house.\r<br />\r<br />Heimskr the loud preacher, BECAME SILENT, which tome was a blessing not a bug haha.\r<br />Had this happen when I was in a current save, but ever since then it seems to a okay, so I hope there is no issue.\r<br />\r<br />One more, I forgot, the Dragonpriest masks work with the busts except the middleone. It works but for some reason it won&#39;t show on the bust itself. No idea why, I pulled a few hairs on this one, haha.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to TMZPhoenix for help with making this compatible and help with his readme file.",
