  "descriptionHtml": "Skyrim Backupper is a user friendly open source 390+ lines of code batch script which allows anyone with a Windows machine to manage their Skyrim saves with speed and always have a recent backup available if your saves becomes corrupt.\r<br />The main thing about Skyrim Backupper is that it is very fast and organized. No more will you have to navigate to your save folders and copy paste etc and make several backup folders every now and then. Just start the software, tell it to make a new backup, pick a backup slot and you&#39;re done.\r<br />\r<br />You can of course have several full saves backupped at once from different periods of time if you wish. \r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod EVER and my first serious batch project, so be nice :)\r<br />In batch you are quite limited to graphical design, but I&#39;m trying my best to push it to its limits.\r<br />\r<br />Functions\r<br />Can backup all your save files (obviously) to a &#34;Backup slot&#34;. There are several Backup slots to save your save files inside so you&#39;re not limited to one complete backup.\r<br />\r<br />Can edit those slots and remove existing backups or replace them with new.\r<br />\r<br />Can instantly start using one of the backup slots if your game were to corrupt or loose your saves.\r<br />\r<br />Installation\r<br />Simply put the folder SkyrimBackupper located in the zip on your desktop and you&#39;re done&#33; Open the folder and launch the bat file and you will have several options of what you&#39;d like to do.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements\r<br />None&#33; Only a windows PC.
