  "descriptionHtml": "Long ago, in the misty wastelands of Photoshop, a texture pack was created, using a file from Mr. Dave\\'s texture resource as a base. Its mission: to create cleaned-up, renovated Dwarven architecture. Its problem: a busted graphics card that prevents its creator from playing Skyrim or modding.\r\n\r\nYour assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to go forth and use this texture pack, which doesn\\'t deserve to languish in anonymity just because I don\\'t know how to dust a computer. Please note that I\\'m only an amateur texturer myself, and cannot give tutorials or advice on how to swap these textures for the originals in NifSkope.",
