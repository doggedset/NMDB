  "summary": "This mods fixes the unproper transformation back to normal after the race has been changed via showracemenu. This occurs as a wrong headmorph.",
  "descriptionHtml": "My mod from the Steam Workshop\r<br />\r<br />Problem:\r<br />Should you ever think about changing your race via the console the werewolf tranformation back to human maybe will be broken.\r<br />This occurs because you will always tranform back into your very first race (at the Companions quest) and not your current one.\r<br />Your head will be a mess&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Solution:\r<br />This mod simply contains an altered script which saves the current race directly before the transformation to a werewolf, every time.\r<br />\r<br />This fix is not contained in the Unofficial Skyrim Patch because it does not cover up cheats (showracemenu).\r<br />\r<br />Imcompabilities:\r<br />Anything which alters the PlayerWerewolfChangeScript will be broken by this mod&#33; I believe many werewolf mods out there will have that script changed.\r<br />\r<br />Content:\r<br />One ESP and one BSA. The BSA holds the script.\r<br />Nothing else will be edited&#33;",
