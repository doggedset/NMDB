Please inform me of them in the comment section.\r\n\r\ncoming later: map markers, LIlith\\'s Reaver (Improved), completely new weapons(bow, warhammer, rapier) \\'n stuff!\r\n\r\n======================================================================================\r\nDescription:\r\n------------\r\n*you should uninstall the lilith mods included in this one if you have them installed*\r\n*Mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit*\r\n\r\nThis mod contains my following mods:\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n(check them out to see pictures of them and their variations)\r\n\r\nLilith\\'s Disemboweler - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14906]Link[/url]\r\n\r\nLilith\\'s Sickle - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22368]Link[/url]\r\n\r\nLilith\\'s Carver - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22930]Link[/url]\r\n\r\nLilith\\'s Obliterator - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23733]Link[/url]\r\n\r\nLilith\\'s Slayer - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24079]Link[/url]\r\n\r\nThis mod is a compilation that adds about 90 different weapons (5 base models) and a new armor set (retexture) into the world of skyrim. Unlike on the standalone versions there\\'s an unmarked quest to obtain the weapons which features 5 new locations. Some of these locations are quite hard in their own way so entering the second new location is not recommended under lvl of 30. \r\n[color=red]IF YOU DON\\'T HOWEVER REMEMBER TO SAVE BEFORE THAT. YOU WON\\'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT UNLESS YOU COMPLETE THE PLACE. \r\n\r\nALSO TAKING FOLLOWERS WITH YOU IS NOT RECOMMENDED. I\\'VE NOT TESTED THE LOCATIONS WITH THEM. \r\nALL THE DUNGEONS AND LOCATIONS ARE VERY DARK. GET A TORCH OR 10 / MAGELIGHT or you are in trouble.[/color]\r\n\r\nThe File Size:\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe file is nearly 300 MBs unpacked. Why?\r\n\r\nWhen you have 90 weapons with different mesh files (that are about 2Mb each)+ the meshes for the clutter items it\\'s not a miracle it takes so much space. In addition to the mesh files there are also the textures that are 2048x2048 for all weapons. Everything inside the rar is required for the mod to work. \r\n\r\nWeapons and Armor:\r\n------------------------------\r\nAll the weapons are meant for end game meaning their damage is quite high. The added armor set equals daedric plate armor in terms of defense. The hood included allows the player to use a circlet at the same time (the hood is for both male and female whereas the armor is only for females unfortunately) This is why the locations add a bit of challenge so that the weapons are not given to you for free. \r\n\r\nThere are 3 versions of all the weapons: weathered, basic and ancient = technically the esp contains 130+ weapons\r\n\r\nYou will find the weapons in chests at the main dungeon. All of them are weathered and you will need to fix them to get the basic version. This fixing is done through crafting at a custom forge inside the dungeon (you will find it easily). Because not everyone has smithing I made it so you don\\'t need a perk for crafting them. Once you have the basic version of the weapon you can make it \\\"ancient\\\" which has a glowing blade and a separate shine as well. \r\n\r\nMost of the weapons have an abbreviation at the end of their name to indicate which variation it is of the base model. \r\n\r\n1h= 1-handed\r\n2h= 2-handed\r\nnosheath=doesn\\'t have a sheath\r\n1h2e= 1-handed double-edged\r\nhal = halbert version\r\n\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\nSome small changes have been made to weapon names. The Lilith\\'s Sickle is now named Lilith\\'s Reaper. Mainly because scythe=/=sickle\r\n\r\nThe Unmarked Quest:\r\n----------------\r\nOriginally this mod was not meant to have a quest at all but all my previous mods just in one esp. However people requested a quest of somekind and I decided to give it a try.\r\nWhile making this I had to learn how to make interiors, use lights, effects and all sorts of stuff which is why making this took so long. In addition to the immense amount of clicking I had to do to add all those weapons ingame. Still don\\'t expect too much. Getting it to the point it is now took me a long time and to be honest I rather concentrate on making more weapons for the set instead of making a \\\"real\\\" quest. If you are stuck in the quest just check out the pictures in the image-section.\r\n\r\nStill the quest offers a better way of getting the weapons and creates perhaps some role-playing value as well. \r\n\r\nThe quest itself starts near Dragon Bridge in Abandoned Home. Search carefully to get clues where you need to go next. \r\n\r\nConsole:\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIf you are lazy and don\\'t wish to do the \\\"quest\\\" you can just use the console to get the weapons. \r\n\r\nType \\\"help lilith 4\\\" to get the IDs for the basic version or \\\"help ancient 4\\\" to get the IDs for the more powerful versions.\r\n\r\nAfter this use the \\\"player.additem *id* *amount* -> player.additem 00023a56 2 for instance.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
