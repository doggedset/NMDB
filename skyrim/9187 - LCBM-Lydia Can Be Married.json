  "modName": "LCBM-Lydia Can Be Married",
  "summary": "This mod fixes the bug where Lydia can\\'t be married.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The reason why you can\\'t marry Lydia in vanilla Skyrim is because in the \\\"potentialmarriage\\\" faction, Lydia is set as -1 while everyone else is set as 0. Some thought it was because she\\'s a housecarl but the other housecarls CAN be married. Why? Because they are set as 0. This mod just changes Lydia to 0.\r\n\r\nHow to install:\r\nExtract the .zip folder using your favourite program, 7zip, winrar etc.\r\nDrag and drop the .esp into Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\nStart Steam, start Skyrim and then go into \\\"Data Files\\\" and tick the box next to the .esp.\r\nPLAY!",
