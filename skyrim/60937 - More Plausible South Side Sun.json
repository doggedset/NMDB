  "modName": "More Plausible South Side Sun",
  "summary": "Make it so the sun is lower on the horizon and towards the south (instead of slightly north in vanilla Skyrim), like it would appear in northern regions.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Just a really simple change to move the fSunYExtreme from 40 to -200 per request of someone on Reddit. This moves the sun from slightly north to south and lower to the horizon. Skyrim is a northern region, so the sun should be south at midday and lower in the sky. This mod just does that.\r<br />\r<br />Note that this mod doesn&#39;t make Skyrim&#39;s outside shadows 100% realistic with respect to the sun&#39;s position, as the world map light source is hard coded to go linear from east to west during the day and west to east during the night.\r<br />\r<br />For some reason, my ENB&#39;s sun rays do not work with mod, this may occur for you too.\r<br />\r<br />You can install or uninstall this mod at any time. It only alters that one game setting.",
