  "descriptionHtml": "Just on the northern coast of Lake Ilinalta, a humble fishing shanty was built with the intention of selling live bait and tackle, but for reasons unknown the place is left abandoned. \r<br />\r<br />Perfect for your fish-harvesting needs as salmon and various lake fish are kept within tanks here. There is also a cooking pot available to cook the fish in. Just don&#39;t cut yourself on the Dirty Filet Knives available here. \r<br />\r<br />This shack does reset, so don&#39;t store your gear in it&#33; Purely for aesthetics. \r<br />\r<br />Check out my other mods on my workshop page in Steam&#33;",
