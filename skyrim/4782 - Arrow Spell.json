  "descriptionHtml": "Well well Dovahkiin, you think you\\'re too good for a bow now, eh? WELL YOU ARE! With this spell, you are now able to shoot arrows out of your hands. After installing the mod, in skyrim open up the command and type, help \\\"hand 0\\\" or  \\\"help  hand arrow 0\\\") and use the page up/down until you find it, then use the player.addspell xxxxxxx command to add the spell to your magic inventory.\r\n\r\nNote: Ok, the update adds 3 more spells, one is the normal rapid fire one, the other one allows you to shoot 1 at a time. The other two are the same as the first two, except with A LOT more damage (as someone requested in the comments.)\r\n\r\nUpdate: Ok, modified the arrows, you can\\'t pick them up anymore, so you don\\'t have to worry about crashing the game. Also, I reduced the magic costs for each of the spells, so that you can actually have some fun with them in this game.",
