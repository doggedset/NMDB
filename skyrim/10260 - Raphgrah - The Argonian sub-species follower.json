  "descriptionHtml": "My first properish mod!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n[[[Backstory]]]\r\n\r\nThe lands of Argonia were allways a mysterious place, now they have become even more so with the sighting of a new sub-species of Argonian that are noteably smaller than the average Argonian. The Raphgrah. These little fella\\'s do not follow the hist, but instead the La\\'hsar\\'da (Which Translate the Flying lizard slayer) They have come to find the Dragonborn (or La\\'hsar\\'da in their tounge) and protect them with their lives as the Dragonborn is seen as their god.\r\n\r\nI know it isnt lore friendily but oh well!\r\n\r\nThis is version 1.1 and they currently-\r\n\r\n-Have a set of orcish armour each without the helmet\r\n-Have an orcish war axe each\r\n-Have 350 hp\r\n-Respawn\r\n-3 of them\r\n-Will fight\r\n-Will level with player\r\n-Have a special artifact at the alchemists shack which if in inventory they follow, and if not, they stop. The Raphgrah can be found at the alchemists shack too.\r\n-2 Unique npc\\'s. One in castle dour and the other at the Palace of the kings.\r\n\r\nIn future version i will add-\r\n\r\n-Unique RaphGrah\r\n-Leveled items\r\n-Other stuff\r\n\r\nLog\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n-Initial release\r\n\r\n Version 1.1\r\n-Artifact found at Alchemists shack which if in inventory, they will follow, if not, they will stop following.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2\r\n-First 2 Unique Raphgrah\\'s\r\n- So, the Unique Raphgah\\'s, I have some pretty interesting things planned for them. The most interesting Feature will most likely be that they have different relationships with each other. This is not finished yet so don\\'t expect them to flip out on each other",
