  "summary": "Re-texture of the glass set with lunar/stardust patterns to enhance the look. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Added a new texture to the glass set in skyrim, every detail of the armor has been made-over with lunar/stardust patterns, which (in my opinion) enhances the look. The set is enchanted with health, magicka/magicka, and stamina boost. You can also craft this yourself at the forge under the normal circumstances of glass smithing, and it should be temperable. This is my first mod, so feedback is gladly welcomed. Male version only available at the moment.",
