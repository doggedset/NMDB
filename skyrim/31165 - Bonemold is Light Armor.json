  "summary": "Exactly what the title says.",
  "descriptionHtml": "In TES3, Bonemold was classed as a medium armor which puts it someplace between heavy and light. Since the medium armor class does not exist in TES5, Bethesda decided to round up to heavy. That\\'s all well and good, except my Dunmer character specializes in light armor and since I\\'m a huge fan of the Redoran, I really wanted to be able to use their armor set with him.\r\n\r\nThis mod very simply changes Bonemold from a heavy armor to a light armor. Compared to other light armor, it is about as protective as Scaled Armor, and I have changed the weights in so that each piece is three times heavier than its Elven counterpart.\r\n\r\nThe guards that wear Bonemold were classed to be more proficient in Light Armor to begin with, so you don\\'t have to worry about putting them at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThis mod will probably be incompatible with the various overhauls once they update to encompass Dragonborn.",
