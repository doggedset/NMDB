  "descriptionHtml": "Everyone loves Pinup Poser by Halofarm.  As I play I come up to situations that can be a great photo op and either I cant remember which number is my favorite pose or just end up rumaging through all of them which takes forever. So I just took pics of each pose with a reference number to each on the Idle lists. so now you can have pics to look through for your photo ops which makes it super fast to pose your characters.\r\n\r\nExtraction:\r\nMake sure to extract as folders, cause the pictures are seperated by folders describing each Idle pose.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\npictures have names like 2-10.jpg , the first number is the pose group and the second number is the pose under that group.\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense lol \r\n\r\nAnd big thanks to Halofarm for Pinup Poser.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17174\r\n\r\nEnjoy your faster posing ",
