  "descriptionHtml": "Tired of drinks not benefiting your mage character? Well no longer!\n<br />\n<br />This mod allows you to take ale, nord mead, wine, and alto wine and craft them into a unique arcane beverage that will restore your magicka when consumed. The weight of the new beverages is .1 to make it in line with the lighter potions mod. The monetary value is unchanged, and the magnitude of magicka gained is 12 instead of 15 to balance the fact that the new beverages don't reduce magicka regeneration by 30% for 30 seconds.\n<br />\n<br />You can craft them at any cooking station.Â \n<br />\n<br />No DLC is required.",
