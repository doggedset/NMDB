  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will allow Elemental Fury to work on enchanted weapons, bows, unarmed, and will properly apply to your offhand when dual wielding. This is the Elemental Fury Fix by tesnexus8 with Richgars suggested dual wield fix. Tesnexus8 has been busy so I decided to upload an updated version for those that have been waiting. I simply followed Richgars instructions with my own personal download of tesnexus8\\'s mod. The mod works great for me, though I will admit I haven\\'t tried to use elemental fury with unarmed yet. However dual wield, bows, and enchanted weapons all work well with the shout in my experience. Thanks should go to the other two. I wouldn\\'t know how to create either of these mods from scratch. I just know how to change obvious values and occasionally follow instructions from other users.\r\n\r\nJust uploaded another version that is nerfed. You may be like me and noticed that you were a \\\"little bit\\\" overpowered with your amazing enchanted weapon enhanced by elemental fury; so I changed the Attack Speed Increases per word. The old values were 30/50/70% per word. I changed them to 12/25/40%...and trust me you\\'ll still do wonders using the shout! I guess it really needed the nerf. I felt this was a fair balance with the changes added by the \\\"fix\\\"\r\n\r\nONLY DOWNLOAD ONE .ESP\r\n\r\nInstall: Unzip rar and place .esp into Skyrim data folder. Tick the box next to .esp in the Skyrim Launcher or with NMM\r\n\r\nUninstall: Unmark and delete the .esp",
