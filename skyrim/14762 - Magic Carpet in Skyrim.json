  "descriptionHtml": "Magic Carpet - Elderscroll V: Skyrim Mod\r\n\r\n-by electionis\r\n\r\n======= Description ==========\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a magic carpet in Skyrim.\r\n\r\nWhen mounted, it can transport you from A to B with lightning speed. (15 times faster than a horse)\r\nSorry, you cannot fly upward yet. But while on it, you will definitely feel like flying and sometimes you do \\\"fly\\\".\r\nThink of it as a transportation vehicle, more efficient than walking or horse riding.\r\nFast travel is too fast and all \\\"black\\\" with loading screen animations, but magic carpet riding is breathtaking and fun.\r\nIt\\'s up to you how you travel, but isn\\'t it nice to have an extra option to do that?\r\nIf you agree, you might like this mod.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: Oh, this mod requires high-end PC, so if your system crashes or your graphic card gets fried using this mod, I am not responsible. You\\'ve been warned.\r\nIf you\\'re afraid, don\\'t download this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n======== How it was made ===========\r\nMy original intention was to create a pilotable magic carpet on which you can fly whichever direction you like. (up down left right etc..)\r\nbut I could not accomplish that due to my lack of modding experience with script.\r\nSo I had to settle for a regular horse. I simply turned a horse into a carpet. \r\nAnd voila! The first Skyrim Magic Carpet!  \r\n\r\n========= Features ===========\r\n1. Unique 17th Century Turkish rug design\r\n2. You can summon it using  Magic Carpet Summon Spell everywhere, even in indoors.\r\n3. The carpet automatically follows you, but not too close. \r\n4. If you happened to summon a number of carpets by mistakes or by intention, \r\nyou can send carpets to Oblivion using Magic Carpet Banish spell. \r\n\r\n\r\n======== Install ==================\r\nDownload\r\nUnzip\r\nDrop meshes + textures + scripts+MagicCarpet.esp inside your Data folder.\r\n\r\n=======Requirements=================\r\nnone, just install it and ready to go.\r\n=================================\r\n\r\n\r\n======== What to do in game ===========\r\n\r\n* Learn the spells (See screenshots for location)\r\n1. Fast travel to The Guardian Stones. (on the way to the Riverwood from Helgen)\r\n2. Head for Riverwood for 5 secs.\r\n3. You will see waterfalls on your left.\r\n4. Jump carefully from the rocks or go around to the ground to get to the bottom of the waterfall.\r\n5. There are 3 things: Magic Carpet Summon spell tome, Magic Carpet Banish spell tome, a Note.\r\n8. Read the note. And KEEP it.\r\n9. Learn the spells.\r\n\r\n* Using the spells\r\n1. Magic Carpet Summon spell enables you to call as many carpets as you like. (Conjuration)\r\n2. Once summoned, Magic Carpets will follow you wherever you go as long as you keep the Magic Carpet NOTE in your inventory. If you drop it, the carpet will go back to the location where it was summoned last time. Sometimes it takes time to follow along, but eventually they will be always behind you, ready for service.\r\n3. If they bother you, you can always banish them with Magic Carpet Banish spell.\r\n4. They do appear after fast travel even if you banished them. This is not a bug.\r\n\r\n* On the carpet\r\nPilot the carpet just as you do with a horse.\r\nCarpets will fly only horizontally for now. If you want to fly higher, fly to nearby terrain which is higher level than now and keep pressing \\\"W\\\" so that you can maintain the current altitude.\r\nYou will get the hang of it soon and you will know what I mean.\r\nIf you stop pressing \\\"W\\\", you will fall and your altitude will be 0. (on the ground)\r\n\r\n\r\n==== uninstall =======\r\ndelete the MagicCarpet.esp file.\r\n\r\ndelete the following folders and file in your Data folder\r\n\r\nmeshes\\\\actors\\\\magiccarpet (folder)\r\ntextures\\\\actors\\\\magic carpet (folder)\r\nscripts\\\\SHorseSummonScript.pex (file)\r\nscripts\\\\BansihEverythingTeleportSCR.pex (file)\r\nscripts\\\\source\\\\BansihEverythingTeleportSCR.psc (file)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n====Known issues=======\r\n\r\n1.
