  "summary": "A perk that negates the penalties applied to vampire lords whilst the sun is out.    ",
  "descriptionHtml": "I grew tired of having the rather extreme nerf that is applied to vampire lords whilst the sun is out, so I searched the Nexus for a mod that would remove said penalty, but only found mods that removed the penalty if you are wearing a hood, or some sort of wearable item. So I decided to create what is in my opinion a more believable way of removing the penalty applied to vampire lords. This mod adds a perk to the vampire lord perk tree named &#34;Vampire Lord Mastery&#34; it is only acquirable after you have gotten the Night Cloak perk.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements - Of course it requires Dawnguard.\r<br />\r<br />Installation - Simply use NMM, or place the esp into your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility - Most likely will conflict with mods that alter the vampire lord perk tree.",
