Within this zip folder contains 2 .INI files that have been heavily modded to give players an extremely large boost to your FPS on moderate to low performance computers. I run a lot of mods on my rig, about 67 to be exact. I made these INI files to aid low/moderate performanced computers while keeping your mods still performing smoothly. These files should run just fine with any heavily modded skyrim. These INI files are NOT meant for high performance computers, and should not be used by any means. These particular INI files are also encouraged to work with other FPS boosting mods you&#39;ll find around. Or they can be used by themselves with Shadow Remover, but Shadow Remover is 100% needed&#33;  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Along with removing a large portion of shadows with Shadow Remover, these INI files do the following to your skyrim game and playthrough:[/center]\r<br />- Disables dust/sand effects\r<br />- Smooths and removes excess graphics from interior water\r<br />- removes 3rd party shadows from objects\r<br />- removes facial shadows from npcs\r<br />- removes 3rd party shadows from trees/rocks\r<br />- Smooths resolution on all outdoor objects/trees\r<br />- Smooths resolution on all indoor objects/furnishes \r<br />- Unlocks skyrim&#39;s minimum resolution and set to 525 x 1025\r<br />- Excess/Breakable spiderwebs have been disabled graphicly (major FPS boost to spider caves)\r<br />- While in First Person, player&#39;s bodily shadows are completely removed\r<br />- 3rd party Shadows from brazer&#39;s removed\r<br />- 3rd party Shadows from candles/lanterns/etc removed\r<br />- Texture resolution of armor/weapons reduced\r<br />- Dragon Shout &#34;ripple&#34; effects are removed\r<br />- Indoor/outdoor bloom graphics removed\r<br />- Sunbeams have been smoothed (No more sharp/unrealistic sunbeams)\r<br />- Enchantment effect resolutions smoothed \r<br />- Some Main Quest/Daedric Quest special effects have been smoothed/removed\r<br />- Makes sure skyrim uses the correct amount of 4GB RAM when playing\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />--How to use the Skyrim FPS Booster & Softener--\r<br />\r<br />Step 1: Open your the folder containing your INI files in &#34;documents/my games/skyrim&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Step 2: Drop both the Skyrim.ini and skyrimpref.ini from the .zip into your folder.\r<br />\r<br />Step 3: Click &#34;Yes&#34; when asked to overwrite.\r<br />\r<br />Step 4: You can now play skyrim with your new FPS boost. Have fun&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][b]YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE THE SETTINGS FROM &#34;SHADOW REMOVER&#34;&#33;&#33; ITS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU&#33;&#33;[/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][i][u]--WARNING&#33;--[/u][/i][/b][/center]These INI settings are used for older computers and/or computers with moderate to low performance. Graphics within the game will be smoothed, especially water graphics. Like some indoor Water graphics, dust/sand effects, and spiderwebs have been disabled. So you might notice things like Arvel in Bleak Falls Barrow to look like he is floating in the air. The graphics have been extremely tweaked and smoothed, to give you a HUGE boost to your skyrim game and playthrough. \r<br />\r<br />The INI files provided has boosted heavily modded skyrim games as well, and the large boost to performance prevailed flawlessly. Also important&#33; If you change ANY of your settings ingame or through the Skyrim Options, your boosted INI files will be lost and deleted from the folder; replaced with your new changes.\r<br />\r<br />And as always before using any graphic mod/ini, back up your Saves and INI files just in case you dont like the changes.",
