  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Version 1.1[/b]\r<br />+Hearthfire and Dragonborn connected houses\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Version 1.0[/b]\r<br />+Skyrim houses connected tunnels\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Story:\r<br />Before the Dragonborn owned the houses, another family lived there, a family of sorcerers. They used magic to connect their houses, allowing them to move quickly between places. However, with the coming of dragons, they dissapered, leaving those houses empty and tunnels standing.\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />This mod allows the player to access a secret underground cave that connects all available houses in Skyrim. Doors can be unlocked with their appropriate house keys or with the &#34;unlock&#34; command.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Extract the files in the zip archive into the &#34;data&#34; Skyrim folder.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />Delete mod files (Make sure your last save isn&#39;t in the added cave)",
