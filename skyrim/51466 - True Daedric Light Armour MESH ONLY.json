  "summary": "Tried time and time again to get this armour out of Blender and into CK (ARGHGH the brain). Its a basic mesh but I think it has potential",
  "descriptionHtml": "The Armour itself is supposed to be a mix of Daedric Flesh (Daedric Heart) and Daedric Metal. It isn&#39;t miles from the original but there is a significant difference in the shape and weight. It is a base mesh with Materials but with no weights or textures. The mesh itself is designed for body type UNP B.2 and is only sized for a weight_0 body, so some tweaking might be needed for other body types. I consider this a &#39;Skimpy&#39; amour, but that might only be because the regular Daedric Armour is a full suit.\r<br />\r<br />Work In Progress.\r<br />\r<br />Not sure if any additional info is needed.\r<br /> If you intend to use it feel free just give me a link and props for the mesh.",
