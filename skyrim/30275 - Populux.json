  "descriptionHtml": "[heading] IT\\'S ALIVE! [/heading]\r\nOkay, so I\\'m not dead anymore and neither is the mod, in fact I\\'m feeling a lot better these days and am finally modding again; so Populux is back up and running. I hated having to leave it when I did, as it was still such a tiny thing and I have much bigger plans for things to come, so you can expect an update by this weekend (maybe small, maybe huge, it depends how much I get done :P ).\r\n\r\nOh and thanks to everyone who said they like it, without your encouragement I probably would have just left this well alone, but your support makes everything that little bit better.\r\n\r\n[heading] IMPORTANT NOTE [/heading]\r\n\r\nNEW (well, swapped around a bit) TEXTURES AND AMBIENT SOUND!\r\n\r\nIf you have previously downloaded the merged version of this mod, it\\'s reccommeded to delete it and re-install due to minor navmesh problems contained in the merged version. For now, all settlements will be uploaded separately until the merging issue can be resolved.\r\n\r\n[heading] What Is Populux? [/heading]\r\n\r\nI daren\\'t say that Populux is anything special, or that it\\'s going to be the most downloaded file in the history of Skyrim modding, it\\'s just a simple solution to a simple problem. Have you ever wandered through the towns and cities of Skyrim and said to yourself \\\"Man (or woman, if you have the requisite biology) this place seems so small...\\\"? If so then you, like me, thought that the designers done goofed on an important detail of immersion.\r\n\r\nYes, settlements in Skyrim are an immense step up from the cut and paste similarity of Oblivion (and we can thank the awesome BannanaSplit for making Better Cities) but I always thought they lacked scale, to me Whiterun seems like two houses a farm and a palace; hardly a traders metropolis. So Populux sets out to crowd things up a bit, not by expanding settlements beyond their boundaries, just putting in more. More houses, more buildings, more vegetation (and soon more people). Populux is designed to make a city a city.\r\n\r\n\r\n[heading] How Does Populux Work? [/heading]\r\n\r\nBy doing as little as possible. My goal wasn\\'t to fill city walls to the brim with as much stuff as I could find, but to seemlessly place things here and there that add to the general believability of the world around you. Buildings have been placed in logical spaces, places that people in a setting like Skyrim would actually build; i.e. empty plots of land, rather than jutting out of a city wall. Plants and trees have been placed here and there where they would/could actually grow; there are lots of mods that overhaul settlements, and whilst many of them are truly stunning, there seems to be trend for shoving a forest in the town square: it looks nice, but it\\'s not for me.\r\n\r\nMy guiding principle during design has been to make changes so fluid that one almost fails to notice them.\r\n\r\nNote: At this stage, there are no new interiors or NPCs, this will change in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n[heading] Will Populux Blow Up My Computer? [/heading]\r\n\r\nPerhaps... I really don\\'t know how explosive your PC setup is. But if you mean will it tax CPUs and lag gameplay down to a crawl, it shouldn\\'t. I\\'ve done testing on my mid-range machine on the highest settings, and all I got was the occassional stutter. I don\\'t see why it should cause any major problems unless you have a metric ton of mods, in which case testing may be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n[heading] Does Populux Conflict With Ultra-Mega-Mod X? [/heading]\r\n\r\nI really have no idea. Mod conflicts are always a possibility, and one could envision obvious conflicts with mods that alter settlements or their immediate surrounding area. Other than that, you\\'ll have to try it and see. If there are conflicts with major/popular mods, I\\'ll be happy to look at modifying Populux to be compatible.\r\n\r\n\r\n[heading] Anything Else? [/heading]\r\n\r\nI\\'m not too blessed in the imagination department, so any feedback of ideas are heartily welcomed, as well as bug reports or \\\"There\\'s a big floating donkey glitch at XYZ\\\". \r\n\r\nAs for the future, the only completed settlements at the moment are Whiterun and Solitude, but I fully intend to do all the settlements in time, I\\'d just rather release them one at a time to allow people to use them earlier; plus it allows mixing and matching with other settlement mods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[heading] Current Settlements [/heading]\r\n\r\nWHITERUN\r\nThe major additions to Whiterun are:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]5 new stalls in the plains district (with merchants and wares to follow).\r\n[*]13 new houses in the plains district.\r\n[*]2 new houses in the wind district.\r\n[*]A new silo on the Grey-Mane estate.\r\n[*]Expanded cemetary.\r\n[*]Complete smithing equipment at the Skyforge.\r\n[*]Various foilage added around the city.\r\n[*]Various decorative items added around the city.\r\n[*]16 new houses outside the city walls.\r\n[*]Expanded Pelagia farm.\r\n[*]Expanded Chillfurrow farm.\r\n[*]Expanded Battle-Born farm.\r\n[/list] \r\n\r\nSOLITUDE\r\nThe major additions to Solitude are:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]3 new stalls in the market district (with merchants and wares to follow).\r\n[*]18 new houses in the residential district.\r\n[*]A memorial to Martin Septim in the market district.\r\n[*]8 new houses (some intended for coming businesses) in the market district\r\n[*]Various foilage added around the city.\r\n[*]Various decorative items added around the city.\r\n[*]15 houses outside the city walls.\r\n[/list] \r\n\r\n[heading] IN THE NEXT EXCITING EPISODE OF POPULUX! [/heading]\r\n\r\nI\\'ve not decided on weather to move on from solitude or add NPCs and interiors first... oh, and more work on the port... seriously, they call that a port? It\\'s barely a dock, the place is supposed to be the major shipping area for all of Skyrim...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[heading] Changelog [/heading]\r\nWhiterun 1.1.2\r\n-Corrected minor navmesh issues.\r\n-Added a small garden to Breezehome.\r\n\r\nSolitude 1.1.3\r\n-Added the ouskirts.\r\n-Added various decoration around the city to help houses blend in.\r\n\r\nSolitude 2.0.0 (because why bother with any updates in between? :P)\r\n-Added new textures to buildings for eye candy.\r\n-Added lighting to new buldings.\r\n-Added formal gardens to the Blue Palace.\r\n-Upgraded and expanded the market district.\r\n-Added various decoration around the city to help houses blend in.\r\n-Added ambient sound to the interior.\r\n-Minor bug fixes for object placement.",
