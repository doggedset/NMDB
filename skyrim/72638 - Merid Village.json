A cloud of many, many questions.\r<br />\r<br />What happened to them? \r<br />Why did they leave the original village? \r<br />And what secrets do they keep as there are Vigilants of Stendarr still watching them? \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />There are several npcs, two followers, some books and journals that may bring some light upon the facts described previously. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
