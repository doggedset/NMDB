  "modName": "Odin - A Simple Follower Mod",
  "summary": "A simple follower that has a tendency to shrink an inch when seated. Uses a Daedric Battleaxe to slaughter his enemies and likes to insult you when you try to start a conversation. He is also an inch taller than everybody else, so you can use him as your personal muscle.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Do you dream of having someone insult you occasionally? Do you want someone who is a inch taller than everyone else? Do you want to kill this follower in return for a Daedric Battleaxe? Well dream and want no longer, with the all new follower Odin&#33;\r<br />\r<br />He was once a humble lumberjack, cutting wood to use on the fires that his town needed for warmth in the freezing nights. This was his dream life, giving wood in return for praise. But this was soon going to end. One day, whilst he was cutting trees in the forest, like he always does, a giant roar erupted from the town below. He rushed to the town, grabbing his axe and helmet for protection. As he arrived at the burnt entrance of the town, an enormous dragon flew from the clutter of destroyed houses. Odin rushed through all the houses, looking for survivors, but there were no signs of life left in the town.\r<br />\r<br />Odin now seeks vengeance upon the dragon that killed his town, his wife and child and most importantly, his dream. He takes the axe he used in his past life and crafted armour made from the finer days of creation. Odin want justice. Odin wants the dragon. Odin wants you.\r<br />\r<br />Find him. Seek him out. He needs your help to find all the dragons in the land and slay them all, for mankind&#39;s sake.\r<br />He is located in the Four-Shields Tavern in Dragonbridge.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Manual Installation:\r<br />[/u][/b]1.
