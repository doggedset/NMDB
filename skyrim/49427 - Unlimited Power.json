  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a few spells and powers that have sound effects from Revenge of the Sith, the Movie. Since everything new in this mod is sound based, there are no pictures. Sorry about that.\r<br />\r<br />Firstly, there is a new lightning storm spell that has the charge up sound replaced with Palpatine&#39;s Unlimited Power. \r<br />\r<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_DqV1xdf-Y\r<br />\r<br />Second there is a power that is usable as many times a day as you like. It gives you a health boost, frightens nearby NPCs, and your character will say this \r<br />\r<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD5wWA75skc\r<br />\r<br />Finally you can now express your terrible despair with a mass destruction spell that will play the iconic NOOOO, from Darth Vader. \r<br />\r<br /> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWaLxFIVX1s\r<br />\r<br />You don&#39;t need anything else, and the spellbooks are found at the Riverwood Blacksmith in a barrel.
