  "descriptionHtml": "Hate nasty smell from what left of your enemies? Not a problem! Because now it is gone! With new \\\"No Steaming Ash Piles\\\" mod! No steaming - No smell!\r\n\r\nThis mod is part of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32775]Legendary Dawnbreaker[/url]\r\n\r\nPLEASE ENDORSE if you like it! :)\r\n\r\nOriginal ash piles with blue steaming effect were completely not good for me. So after searching on Google and obviously Nexus and not founding such mod decided to make one myself.\r\n\r\nGreat along with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1838]Ash Pile Retex[/url]\r\nYou can use \\\"no glow\\\" version to get rid of both steaming and glowing.\r\n\r\nNote: Screenshots made with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1838]Ash Pile Retex[/url] mod. It is essential to get really good look of ash piles.",
