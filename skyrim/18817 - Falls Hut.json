The Interior is decorated and highly detailed.  It is located in the West of Riften, you can travel there immediately after activating the Mod. The House is fully navmeshed, so Followers or even your Spouse can live with you. This house has nothing special, it convinces with details and cozyness. It is perfect for those who want to play Skyrim fairly and lore-friendly.\r\n\r\n[size=+2][color=black]Installation[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nI HIGHLY recommend to use NexusModManager to install. Its the easiest way of installing it.\r\nBut if you want to install it manually, drop the .ESP and the .BSA in your Skyrim Data Folder, then activate them in NMM or Steam.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=+2][color=black]Deinstallation[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nIf you have installed it with NexusModManager, deinstall it by double-clicking on the mod\\'s name.\r\nIf you have installed it manually, delete the FallsHut.esp in your Skyrim Data Folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=+2][color=black]Known Issues or Bugs[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nRight now, there are no Issues or Bugs, I\\'m living in it myself and everything works fine for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=+2][color=black]Improvement & Updates[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nI\\'ll update my Mod everytime I change something, and this is quite often. If you have suggestions how to improve, feel free to share them in the Comments or send me a PM.\r\n\r\nUpdate Idea is to add a traveling merchant, which will provide you food and supplies once a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=+2][color=black]History[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nXBox 360 Release!
