Â It is separate because it can delete weapons in the basement if user\r<br />forgets to retrieve items, leave house, save.\r<br />\r<br />Please RATE this mod.\r<br />Rev 1.2   No transition to the armory.\r<br />This home is for the adventurer that likes to keep her found gear and put it on display.\r<br />\r<br />This is a fix and add on mod to an original mod. That mod had added modest number of mannequins,\r<br />alot of wall mounted weapon racks, a forge,smithy, sharpening wheel, crafing table, tanning rack.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Fixed: All weapon racks in the basement from the original mod.\r<br />Wall textures in basement.\r<br />\r<br />You do NOT need the original mod. If you have the original mod by agoon66 please remove all items\r<br />in the basement. ALL items you care about from the mannequins, weapon racks, chests, etc.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />ADDED: Basement:\r<br />Dagger racks with activators\r<br />Large display racks that use the activators\r<br />More mannequins (13 total in the basement)\r<br />More weapon racks.\r<br />\r<br />Upstairs:\r<br />Dagger racks in bedroom with activators\r<br />Extra weapon rack for mages.\r<br />\r<br />A few more bookshelves for the second floor.\r<br />Tweak on the door transition.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />\r<br />To avoid the loading limitations of skyrim, and to avoid crash to desktop, you can safely add two mods at same time.\r<br />Any more will probably crash your desktop. Please see nexus forums for loading order.\r<br />I am using a mod file that allows me to load more than two mods that modify houses / towns/ cities. It is called\r<br />Skyrim Performance Mod. I have not crashed since I loaded that mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS:   Agoon66\r<br />The NEXUS location for his file:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8286/?tab=2&navtag=/ajax/modimages/?user=0|:|id=8286 ",
