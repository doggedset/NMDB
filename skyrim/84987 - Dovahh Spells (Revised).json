I thought of adding this to my old mod\r<br />page itself but the newer version has more changes and requires the DLC too. So\r<br />posted as a new mod. Again for easy find all spells contain a prefix Dovahh.\r<br />\r<br />Also all spells have been revised and compiled as an single esp. Spell Books are added\r<br />so you can now learn from them and it is put in a chest at Helgen the cell in\r<br />which you enter with Hadvar. Video on working will be added soon.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][color=#ff7700][size=4][center]SPELLS[/center][/size][/color][/b][/u]\r<br /> \r<br />[b][size=3]Dovahh Chaos[/size][/b]- This spell will cloud the judgement of the opponents. But unlike the fury spell this does not\r<br />have any resist value and act on any opponent.
