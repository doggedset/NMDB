  "descriptionHtml": "[center][u][b][size=6]\r<br />\r<br />Tactical Healing Redux\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/b][/u]This Mod offers four new Healingspells only to the Player. \r<br />Each of this Spells has its own unique Spellmechanics, and therefore is valuable for different Situations or Characterbuilds.\r<br />\r<br />The four Spells will be available from Beginning, you can buy them from Merchants, which sell Novice Restorationbooks. \r<br />They will grow equally in Power and Cost, and also a better Version of them will be unlocked, as the Player levels up in Restoration. \r<br />You can rebalance Power and Cost of this Spells ingame.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Basicly this Mod is compatible with everything, because it just adds new Stuff to the game.[/u]\r<br />One exception: 5 Spelltomes are added to 3 small leveled Lists, so you can buy it.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[i]\r<br />The Goal is not to provide an MMO-like Playstyle, where Healingmanagment is a Main-Task. \r<br />With default settings most Characters will not have the Magicka to cast many of this spells in short time, \r<br />though it can be setted to play like this. \r<br />You may only use one or two spells, if the others are not fitting to your Playstyle ... important for me was to have options[/i] :)[i]\r<br />\r<br />[/i]If you want to use a Version of this Mod, which comes with its custom Perktree and full Perkdescriptions, try\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73304/?]Tactical Healing 1.01\r<br />[/url]\r<br />[i]\r<br />[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][u][b]Description[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />[size=4][u][b]1. The four new Healingspells are all Novicelevel[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />[i]- Novice Restoration Perk does not reduce Magcika-Cost 50% to new Spells\r<br />- They will not get cheaper when you level up in Restoration\r<br />[/i]\r<br />[size=4][u][b]2. Perks:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Expert, Master\r<br />- Each of the Mainperks in Restoration will [b]add 25%[/b] of Baseamount to [b]Spellpower[/b] and [b]Spellcost[/b][i] (only my 4 new Spells)\r<br />[/i]- All except Masterperk will unlock a new [b]Spellfeature[/b][i] &gt; See Spelldescription (Pictures & Ingame)[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[i]- This will [b]basicly not conflict with other Mods[/b], which might edit Perks or Perktree\r<br />&gt; as long as the 5 Mainperks are somehow around, it will work, no matter if they are changed by another mod[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]3. New Spells[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2][i](Do not worry because of some German Words in the Pictures, in your Game it will be your language, \r<br />&#34;Novize&#34; = Novice,Â  &#34;Kosten&#34; = Cost)[/i][/size][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=4]Close Wounds[/size][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]HoT: You cast it once, then it will heal you over time.
