  "descriptionHtml": "Amulet of Shouting: This is modified version of the Amulet of Talos, which gave 20% time reduction on using shouts. This amulet; however can let you have even less time for the next time you project a Thu\\'um.\r\n\r\n{[:What it REALLY does:]}\r\nAmulet of Talos: 20% less time needed for another shout.\r\nAmulet of Shouting: 70% less time needed for another shout.\r\n\r\n{[:Location:]}\r\nNote, you need the console activated for this mod.\r\nThe amulet is in the \\\"qasmoke\\\" testinghall, right in front of you when you enter.\r\nTo get to the \\\"qasmoke\\\" room, you need to press the ~ key, then type\r\n\\\"coc qasmoke\\\" without the \\\"\\\" \\'s, or brackets.\r\n\r\n{[:Compatibility:]}\r\nThis should work with any mod, unless it removes the qasmoke room, or the EnchReligiousTalos enchantment, which this is based off of. (Who the heck would do that?) Also something which would change the mesh of the Amulet of Talos mesh, but that isn\\'t really a problem. \r\n\r\nNote: Ingame in the active effects tab, it says that the enchantment still gives 20% less. I\\'m just a nuub with the CK, so I dunno how to change the desc. But I assure you, it\\'s 70%!\r\n\r\n{[:Credit:]}\r\nBethesda, for Skyrim, and the creation kit.\r\nUhhmm.. That\\'s really it.\r\n\r\n\r\n~[Saku]~ ~[L]~",
