  "descriptionHtml": "[u][size=4]Armor and Weapons Perks Redone[/size][/u]\r\n\r\nI see a lot of complaints that Skyrim gets too easy because people can stack bonuses until they have ridiculously powerful weapons and armor. In fact, people even stop improving their weapons and armor just to keep the game from getting to easy.\r\n\r\n[b][size=3]This mod reduces damage and armor rating bonuses by 50%, (exception of item set bonuses, reduced from 25% to 15%)[/size][/b]",
