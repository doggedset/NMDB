  "descriptionHtml": "hi friends! :)\r\n\r\njust see the screenshot for what this mod does. Sorry for the not so perfect screenshot, but\r\nid didnt find a better place in the short time, but i guesss you can see how much better it is,\r\ndespite the shadow. just email me if you think this needs better previews. It also looks WAY better ingame - trust me. :)\r\n\r\ni made this mod to give something back to the great nexus community.\r\nmy name is calav3ra, and you can get in contact with me by emailing \r\nto: jonnyhope AT gmx DOT net. my personal website is found under:\r\nhttp://www.calav3ras.de/ but it isnt much related to skyrim at all.\r\n\r\ni look forward to see this mod incorporated into modpacks, as there\r\nare too few at the moment. please ask me via email if you want to \r\nincorporate it into your own modpack, as i want to keep track where\r\nit goes with.\r\n\r\ni know this isnt the most perfect mod, but i\\'m no artist, and i find \r\nthe mod sufficient to get rid of the 90\\'s style pixelated look and\r\nlook pretty nicely.\r\n\r\nps: i also made the mod \\\"improved castironpots\\\".\r\n\r\nINSTALL: As always: drag or copy the \\\"textures\\\" folder into \r\nyour Skyrim\\\\Data folder!\r\n\r\nThanks for listening.\r\nLets make Skyrim greater each day! :)\r\n-------------------------------------\r\ncreation date: 12/12/2011\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n",
