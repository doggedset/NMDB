  "descriptionHtml": "\r\nThis is a very small mod for those, who doesn\\'t like any of the rock & mountain textures in other mods, but find the original game\\'s rock and mountain textures disappointing.  As you may or may not know, the High Resolution update from Bethesda didn\\'t include any texture updates for the mountains, so here is an attempt,  an overhauled texture pack of the 2 textures and 2 bump maps used throughout the game. \r\n\r\nUpdate: \r\nIncluded a DXT1/DXT5 compressed version of the 4096x4096  resolution version. \r\nIf you want to save space or the others are too large for the video card. \r\n\r\nUpdate: \r\nIncluded a DXT1/DXT5 compressed version of the 2048x2048 resolution version. \r\nIf you want to save space or the others are too large for the video card. \r\n\r\nNote:\r\nChoose only 1 file! \r\nIf you want it lighter and take up less space, then choose a compressed (DXT) file.\r\n\r\n 4K most detail with the uncompressed taking up more room.\r\n\r\nWhile the 1K , 2K are slightly less detailed and less space requirement, easier on the CPU+Graphics Card. \r\n\r\nThere is a good balance to be found for every kind of computer out there.  If you ask me, I\\'ll go with the DXT 2K or uncompressed 2K. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThe 4K version uncompressed may r@pe your computer ! :P  Recommended only for those, who have the top-of-the-line hardware with SLI cards,  top CPU and plenty of Video Memory+ System Memory! \r\nYou have been warned, although if you dare, you may be able to run it, for nothing else but to check it out! \r\n\r\nI recommend the 2K version for most people.  I also included a 1K version, which may sound silly, since the game original files are 1K, but perhaps there is some gain in clarity and visuals,  by using uncompressed and sharpened textures. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI utilized 3 different photo editing programs, trying to re-create sharp, but not distorted high resolution textures (2) as well as a  sharpened and corrected normal maps with them. \r\n\r\nThis small mod only modifies 2 textures and can be used with any type of other mods.  No models were touched, so it works with every mod modifying any aspects of the rock models (meshes). \r\n\r\nI\\'m sure everyone has their favorite texture pack they like to use, and there are tons of mods modifying the rocks and mountains, since it\\'s only 2 textures. And yet, it\\'s hard to find a lore-friendly texture beside the original (vanilla) , which seems to be great, if it wasn\\'t for the low resolution aspect of it.  Updating the entire game world to a high resolution texture and leaving the rocks as they are, can be a sore spot for the eyes, but at the same time, most modders made their own texture, which may not be the perfect color or combination and still sticks out like a sore thumb.  Whoever is not satisfied either way, here are 4 textures, give it a try.  These are 4K and 2K textures, go any lower and unfortunately the textures start to get distorted on the mountains. So you need a fairly powerful computer to run this (at least 1 GB of Video Ram, Quad core CPU, 4GB of RAM recommended by me) , so this may chug very slowly on a basic laptop or a 6 year old Desktop. \r\n\r\nI will put up some comparsion shots later, although I dislike making them, because they are a pain in the butt (loading/unloading the game with save points ) and then editing them, takes as much time as much It took me making this mod.
