  "descriptionHtml": "I was really excited when I found out that Dawnguard added uncorrupted snow elves, and equally disappointed when I saw that they were pasty and white, rather than being covered in a bluish frost as they had previously always been described. I decided that once it came out on PC, I would set out to fix that. And I have done exactly that.\r\n\r\nWhile this keeps the vanilla resolution, this isn\\'t just a recolor, it also adds new detail to make their skin seem more like frost or ice. Unfortunately, the snow elves use the default male normal maps, so as of now they won\\'t actually have any shine to them, bu future versions may fix that.",
