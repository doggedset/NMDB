Also new version have support for localization help popup.\r<br />[/color][/color]23 feb 2016: updated binaries (ENBSeries 0.303), removed previous fix for microstuttering, because world map mouse control don&#39;t word by vertical axis, game is absolute satan sent mess.[/color][/color]\r<br />22 feb 2016: updated binaries (ENBSeries 0.303), added fix for microstuttering, some physic and scripting behavior bugs. It always enabled from now.[/color]\r<br />20 feb 2016: updated mod config, added new file with setting based on tests by users, with better performance.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />// DESCRIPTION\r<br />//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />First of all, previous ENBoost for Skyrim with detailed description of [MEMORY] category is here:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38649/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38649/[/url]\r<br />ENBoost is a patch for memory limitations of the game, some optimizations and other fixes.\r<br />In new version 6.0 I&#39;ve added [THREADS] category to enblocal.ini configuration file to apply\r<br />fixes to multithreading code, which is one of the most buggy thing of game engine. Because\r<br />I don&#39;t have sources, the cost of these changes is performance and stuttering, which in their\r<br />turn depends from CPU, OS and some other software installed (overlays, screen captures, etc).\r<br />\r<br />Because of negative performance impact when two new variables enabled, it&#39;s better to activate\r<br />them only when you have non loading game (saved in too &#34;heavy&#34; place or too many mods) or\r<br />actions in the game leads to crashes (like i have with some dialogs of the new followers). To\r<br />disable (but keep memory setting only), set DatasyncMode=0 and PriorityMode=0 in enblocal.ini.\r<br />\r<br />Tested and developed on 22 Gb mods pack with various environment and body texture/models\r<br />modifications, including SKSE plugins. Loading saved games created with it have 40% chance\r<br />to get random crash on load in the tested place and 100% chance of crash in another two. With\r<br />new ENBoost these places loaded fine 20 times in a row and I used preset, which is published\r<br />here. But because of different rigs and &#34;density&#34; of mods and their CPU usage, implemented\r<br />several modes with different level of stability, some of them probably not much playable, but\r<br />may help to load game and resave it again in less stressful place for the engine and scripts.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]At this moment DataSyncMode=2 with PriorityMode=3 where tested\r<br />by users as the most performance efficient and stable setting[size=4].[/size][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]WARNING&#33; Some game bugs and glitches occurs when your PC is running\r<br /> relatively long[size=4], so re[size=4]booting PC is highly recommended (ever[size=4]y 2-4 hours\r<br />[size=4]seems okay[/size][/size])[/size][/size].[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />// REQUIREMENTS\r<br />//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />SOFTWARE\r<br />ENBSeries 0.303 or NEWER binaries (older do not have memory patches), donwload\r<br />it from [url=http://enbdev.com]http://enbdev.com[/url]\r<br />\r<br />HARDWARE\r<br />OS:\r<br />Patch work with both x86 and x64 OS, but to see full potential i advise to\r<br />run Windows Vista/7 x64. Less effective will be with x86 versions of XP/Vista/7.\r<br />Windows 8 and Windows 10 from users reports have limitations of available video\r<br />memory, while some Windows 7 users have much more available, so it&#39;s the best OS\r<br />for modded Skyrim at this moment, especially for videocards with more than 4 Gb VRAM.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />// INSTALLATION\r<br />//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />If you already have configured memory setting, keep your enblocal.ini and only copy [THREADS] section\r<br />of downloaded file to your old one.\r<br />If you don&#39;t have ENBoost or ENBSeries, install it by instructions at old mod page (link above), then replace\r<br />old enblocal.ini with new.\r<br />[size=4][b]DataSyncMode[/b][/size] have the range of 0..2 at this moment, this is not boolean variable. Value=0 disables patch\r<br /> [size=4][b]PriorityMode[/b][/size] have the range of 0..4 at this moment, this is not boolean variable. Value=0 disables patch\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />// ISSUES\r<br />//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />Same as for old versions of the ENBoost, plus even lower incompatibility with &#34;crapware&#34;. Even\r<br />software which worked fine with ENBoost/ENBSeries previously, may crash or act not as expected\r<br />with some of values set under [THREADS] category of enblocal.ini.\r<br />\r<br />Another very important kind of issues may happen are scripts and physics behaviors modified,\r<br />if you&#39;ll find such bugs with strict dependency from certain value of [THREADS] parameters, post\r<br />that info in comments to warn users. Some bugs may looks like abnormal behavior you already know,\r<br />but in fact they are exactly the same as designed to be, because of fixes applied. In this case please\r<br />report your finds too in comments.\r<br />\r<br />Changes made to [b]skyrim.ini[/b] and [b]skyrimprefs.ini[/b] regarding more threads affecting stability and\r<br />performance in bad way, so it&#39;s recommended to restore default values.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Steam beta[/b] (reported at 22 feb 2016) leads to stuttering and low fps with ENB, so disable it.\r<br />\r<br />[b]EnableUnsafeFixes[/b] shows up some strange game bugs, while elliminating others, if you have\r<br />any new issues (like not working vertical axis of world map), set it to false and check again.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Crash in exteriors[/b] happens (as reported by user) when using some old NVidia driver with tripple\r<br />buffering enabled. Update to new one and disable tripple buffering.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Crash[/b] before or after Bethesda logo may happen by following reasons:\r<br />1) No DirectX Runtime Standalone installed. Download at M&#036; web site.\r<br />2) Crapware (check ENBoost 5.0 description about this), antiviruses, Steam overlay, NVidia GeForce Experience.\r<br />3) OneTweak mod (as reported by user) disabled Bethesda logo causes crash.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />// CREDITS\r<br />//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r<br />Boris Vorontsov (aka ENB)\r<br />\r<br />You are free to use, share or sale without notice of any copyrights.
