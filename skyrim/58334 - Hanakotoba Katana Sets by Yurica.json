  "descriptionHtml": "Hanakotoba Katana Sets by Yurica\r<br />\r<br />The kimono is here: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58333/?]Kisetsu Kimono for UNP by Yurica[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[i]~*~ Description ~*~[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Hello all ^_^\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a set of katana which includes a set of daisho (a set of katana with the shorter one as decoration, pls see screenshots), a tachi (one-handed without the shorter one as decoration) and an odachi (two-handed).\r<br />\r<br />The weapons are same level as &#34;Daedric&#34; and can be crafted in the forge under &#34;Daedric&#34; category, they can also be improved in the grinding wheel as usual.\r<br />\r<br />[i]~*~ Optional Skeleton ~*~[/i]\r<br />\r<br />I found the original weapon position for katana is very strange... So I have modified [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26800/?]XPMS[/url] skeleton position placement, the position you see in the screenshot is the new position. I did not rotate the katana upside down (like how it should be) for compatibility issue, but overall it is better than original placement.\r<br />\r<br />The skeleton is available for download as optional file, please follow the instruction of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26800/?]XPMS[/url] installation and then replace it with the optional skeleton of this mod (remember to backup your old one first&#33;&#33;), I suggest to use a custom race with it.\r<br />\r<br />oh, and the skeleton is for female character only :P\r<br />\r<br />[i]~*~ Installations ~*~[/i]\r<br />\r<br />1 - Extract the files to a location.\r<br />2 - Place the extracted &#34;meshes&#34; and &#34;textures&#34; folders into your skyrim/data.\r<br />3 - Place the yurica_daisho.esp file into skyrim/data.\r<br />4 - Activate the .esp.\r<br />5-  Install the optional modifided XPMS skeleton if you want the weapon placement as in the screenshots.\r<br />6 - Enjoy and please don&#39;t forget to endorse if you like the mod, thank you & please come visit me on yurica-skyrim @ tumblr ^_^\r<br />\r<br />[i]~*~ Others ~*~[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Please kindly contact me if you have any questions or needs permission, thank you very much&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[i]~*~ Credits ~*~[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Thanks Mr. xp32 for XPMS :D",
