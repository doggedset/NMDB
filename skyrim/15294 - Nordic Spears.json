Anyhow that doesn\\'t mean I won\\'t be looking at my inbox on this website.\r\nIf you want to use my mod as a ressource [color=red][u]please send me a message for me to grant you the authorisation to do so.[/u][/color]. In some way it will help me to track the use of my mod and maybe offer some help if I return some day.\r\n\r\nNordic Spears (by P3dr0)\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/596968056821786426/A2C7EB5E52DE8E334BAF3AF256AE3CB8744CA3C6/[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n--- DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nAdds spears to skyrim.\r\nCustom HD textures and models.\r\n\r\nThese weapons have a slightly longer reach, speed and critical stats than other 2H weapons.\r\nTheir base damage is between battleaxes and warhammers. nothing too overpowered.\r\n\r\nPlayer Character and NPCs currently wield these as battleaxes and the weapons benefit from the 2H/battleaxes perks too.\r\n\r\nThey can be crafted and tempered at any forge with simple components (ingots, wood and leather strips).\r\nI\\'d also like to add them to bandits and hunters through leveled lists but I\\'ve got no idea of how to do that... \r\nCrafting them requires appropriate smithing perks.\r\n\r\nFor now the mod includes the following :\r\n# Iron\r\n# Steel\r\n# Orcish\r\n\r\nI\\'m currently Working on the dwemer one and I\\'ll most likely add Elven, Glass, Ebony and Daedric spears later.\r\n\r\nWant to throw these ? Take a look at Madrilous\\' mod wich include my model as [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14176]throwable weapons[/url]\r\n(install both mods if you want to swing and throw playstyles)\r\n\r\n\r\n--- UPDATES\r\n\r\n04/16/12 :\r\n- 1st version\r\n\r\n\r\n--- KNOWN BUGS\r\n\r\n# They do not fit on weapon racks\r\n\r\n\r\n--- CREDITS\r\n\r\n# Bethesda - Skyrim and it\\'s assets\r\n\r\n\r\n--- CHECK OUT MY OTHER MODS\r\n\r\n# GAME OF THRONES - House shields : [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13663]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13663[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to give me feedback either on the mod or on its description.\r\nPlease rate this mod if you use it :)",
