  "descriptionHtml": "PROGRESS REPORT Jan 11, 2015\r<br />\r<br />Well it&#39;s 2015 and I should probably release the patch. I fixed the minor NPC merchant speed problem months ago but I never bothered to upload it before now. There aren&#39;t really any noticeable changes. It&#39;s more of a fix for OCD reasons.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: The patch does NOT work with the light version (3.3b).\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />PROGRESS REPORT September 28, 2014\r<br />\r<br />I know it&#39;s been a year since I said I would patch it, but to be honest I havne&#39;t been able to find much time for modding. I&#39;m in between StarCraft2 and Mass Effect 3 most of the time now.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ll be realeasing patch 3.31 as a manual replacement for the main .esp file, as well as a couple of add-ons: 1) Karthspire fix beta, 2) Seperate quarters for Delphine / Esbern. They will be seperate .esp files so users can choose to load them or not.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ll post a revised load order when I upload 3.31\r<br />\r<br />Thank-You everyone for endorsing this mod so far\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />PROGRESS REPORT March 12, 2014\r<br />\r<br />PHEW&#33; Has it been 6 months already? I&#39;ve fianlly gotten my modding materials back in order after a huge system build, and I plan on releasing a patch for some minor issues, such as slow motion walking by some of my NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />PROGRESS REPORT Oct 1, 2013\r<br />Uploaded the immersion-friendly version of the 3.3 update. Like it&#39;s predecessor (3.200), it only has the Blacksmith merchant. You can access it via the files section listed as &#34;3.3b&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />PROGRESS REPORT Sept 30, 2013\r<br />With the temple main area pretty much finished, I&#39;m going to move into cleaning up the Karthspire area, most likely with cleaning up the cave area first. Nothing too fancy, just mopping up the bushes and dirt mounds, then the world area of Karthspire redoubt itself. I&#39;ll be putting it into a separate .esp file so once again, users have a choice whether to activate it or not, and will probably include it in the pack as part of 3.31 or so.\r<br />Also, a user has put up the possibility of a separate bedroom for Delphine and Esbern. I have also started with that project, and more than likely include it in a fresh release of 3.31.\r<br />P.S. I know Uthgier and butters walk in semi-slow motion lol. I&#39;ll have it fixed for 3.31 :)\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE September 29, 2013&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m pretty satisfied with how far things have gone, and have finished (fingers crossed) version 3.3\r<br />\r<br />The main file, &#34;Sky Haven Temple M&M3.esp&#34;, will ad the following\r<br />- Sky Haven Temple Private Quarters, entrance located just outside the sleeping area.\r<br />- A forge, alchemy table (by Esbern&#39;s desk at the alchemy merchant), enchanting table (in armory), worktable (in armory), sharpening stone (in armory), and a smelter (at main entrance).\r<br />- Various additional containers\r<br />- The mead barrels in the temple now also function as containers\r<br />- Weapon racks and plaques. As well, the 6 vanilla weapon racks on the left side wall of the crafting room have been fixed and are now useable.\r<br />- Additional light sources, &#34;Sky Haven Torches&#34;, which can be turned on or off at will.\r<br />- A Ceiling for the main hall (switch located at the Sky Haven table), which will allow for different lighting conditions without vanilla lighting errors. It can be closed or opened at will.\r<br />- 3 Mannequins (2 at main staircase, 1 in private quarters)\r<br />- Merchants as follows:\r<br />    Kiara, a blacksmith. She sells and restocks blade equipment as well.\r<br />    Butters, a drinks merchant\r<br />    Galloway, a books and spells merchant\r<br />    Uthgier, an alchemy merchant\r<br />    H&#39;orran, a GOLD-DUMP merchant\r<br />- Gets rid of the rubbish piles and rock heaps left on the temple floor. (You&#39;d think Delphine would clean up after the place better, with her being a former innkeeper&#33;)\r<br />- Various generic NPCs named &#34;Blade Recruit&#34; around the place so it won&#39;t look so dead.\r<br />- Practice courtyard gets a cleanup and it&#39;s own map marker\r<br />- Ceiling holesin the sleeping area now plugged.\r<br />- You can now use fast travel from inside Sky Haven Temple.\r<br />- The temple gets it&#39;s own unique custom background music (Composed by Noah Potter)\r<br />- The Blades sheath fix from &#34;Shank&#39;s Blades Sheath Fix&#34; integrated and included.\r<br />\r<br />Activating the 3 other .esps in this .zip will activate the following changes.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Essential Blades.esp&#34;\r<br />   - Self-explanatory, but to re-iterize, makes your Blade Recruits essential characters.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Grandmaster Delphine.esp&#34;\r<br />   - Health and Stamina buff\r<br />   - Makes her a bit older to fit her background history more appropriately\r<br />   - Changes her bow and arrows to Ebony type\r<br />   - Alters the quest script for &#34;Blade in the Dark&#34; so may not be compatible with mods that also alters that quest.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Kickass Esbern.esp&#34;\r<br />   - Health and Magicka buff.\r<br />   - Gives Esbern a more &#34;epic&#34; hairstyle, but nothing too silly\r<br />   - After he arrives at the Sky Haven Temple, he gets Blades armor instead of remaining in civilian clothes.\r<br />   - Alters the quest script for &#34;The Throat of the World&#34; so may not be compatible with mods that also alters that quest.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />For all the immersion / lore enthusiasts, I will also be releasing a light version, which will contain the following only\r<br />-Sky Haven Temple Private Quarters\r<br />-Changes to the Temple (cleanup, crafting, containers, extended lighting options)\r<br />-3 Mannequins (2 at main staircase, 1 in private quarters)\r<br />This light version will contain none of the other changes that the standard version will carry, so it will be completely compatible with other mods.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Once I release version 3.3, you will have to uninstall any previous version of &#34;Sky Haven Temple M&M&#34; from your data folder before installing it. Make sure the following files are no longer in your data folder before installing version 3.3\r<br />\r<br />Sky Haven Temple M&M.esp\r<br />Sky Haven Temple M&M.bsl\r<br />Sky Haven Temple M&M.bsa\r<br />Sky Haven Temple M&M2.esp\r<br />Sky Haven Temple M&M2.bsl\r<br />Sky Haven Temple M&M2.bsa\r<br />Sky Haven Temple M&MLight.esp\r<br />Sky Haven Temple M&MLight.bsl\r<br />Sky Haven Temple M&MLight.bsa\r<br />Sky Haven Temple M&M3.esp\r<br />Sky Haven Temple M&M3.bsl\r<br />Sky Haven Temple M&M3.bsa\r<br />Sky Haven Temple Merchants.esp\r<br />Sky Haven Temple Merchants.bsl\r<br />Sky Haven Temple Merchants.bsa\r<br />Sky Haven Temple Redux.esp\r<br />Sky Haven Temple Redux.bsl\r<br />Sky Haven Temple Redux.bsa\r<br />\r<br />These are the filenames of all my previous versions which have been released in the past either here on Nexus or on Steam Workshop. Being mutually incompatible, they will not be compatible with version 3.3 either.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thank-you for reading this &#34;TL;DR&#34; post. :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />It is BEST to use this mod on a NEW GAME, but you can still see this mod&#39;s effects during any stage of the main quest. If you don&#39;t want to start over, loading a save game made before starting the quest &#34;Alduin&#39;s Wall&#34; is acceptable.",
