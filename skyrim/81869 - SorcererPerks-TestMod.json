  "descriptionHtml": "My second mod and I&#39;m still trying to get things right. Again I hope the intern language is english and that the mod works, since I cant test it myself.\r<br />\r<br />So what is this mod supposed to do? It&#39;s simple. It should adds afew perks to Enchanting so that up to 10 enchantments become possible. Also this mod adds perks to Conjuration so up to 10 summons can be done.\r<br />I guess there are already mutiple similiar mods but like I said I am still a beginner. Also I am not sure if this mod is lore-friendly or not.\r<br />\r<br />If you are brave enough to download I hope you write a little post afterwards so I can learn if things work out or not. Also I am glad for bug reports. Once I read them I see what I can do, but that may take some time.",
