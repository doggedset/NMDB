  "descriptionHtml": "Howdy Folks!\r\nThis is a simple retexture and blood decal fix of a few of [url=http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/40660 ]Lazarus89\\'s Steel Swords from this Oblivion mod [/url]\r\n\r\nI\\'ve given the swords new names as you\\'ll see in the screenshots. The Champion sword now swings at normal speed and all the swords have been edited to be in the skyforge steel or glass range in terms of damage.\r\n\r\nall swords can be crafted with steel smithing and upgraded with arcane blacksmith\r\nAlso, the swords are all one-handed. I just have the 1h weapons on back mod to show the scabbards better.\r\n\r\nInstallation - You should know the drill by now, extract to your data folder in the skyrim directory and overwrite when prompted, or simply activate in NMM.\r\n\r\nUninstall - Just delete the applicable files\r\n\r\nCredits - Lazarus89 did all the hard work :D\r\nLancelotx999 for the Skyrim port\r\nbackstept (that\\'s me) retexture and blood decal fixes",
