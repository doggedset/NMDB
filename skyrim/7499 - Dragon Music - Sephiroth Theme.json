  "descriptionHtml": "Hey, I decided since some people think the dragon fighting music could be better, I decided to turn the battle music into the Sephiroth battle music from Kingdom Hearts 1.  Pretty much every time you fight a Dragon, his theme will be played instead of the normal Dragon music, for those who aren\\'t familiar with what a music replacer will do.  I do not own this theme, Sephiroth, or any Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts characters.  Those all belong to Square Enix.\r\n\r\n~Let me know if you like this mod, because I will gladly make a Kingdom Hearts one with more than one theme so you can enjoy many.  I aim to please.",
