  "summary": "Periods of silence to break up music",
  "descriptionHtml": "The music of Skyrim is fantastic, but the weak point of the game is that there\\'s virtually no break in it.  This mod changes that by adding periods of silence for most circumstances.  This gives us a break from the music, and adds to the ambiance of locations (especially dungeons).  This will not otherwise interfere with the music tracks in the game.  \r\n\r\nCREDITS: \r\n=======\r\nSkyrim changed the way they had music set up from the previous 2 games.  Therefore, the simple <drag-n-drop> method no longer worked.  So, thanks to No_Aardvarks_Allowed\\'s mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13286/? which stripped out the folder-tree.  I simply used his mod and inserted the tracks of (90 second) silence.  \r\n",
