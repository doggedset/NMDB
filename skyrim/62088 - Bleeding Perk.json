  "descriptionHtml": "Waraxes and battleaxes have perks &#34;bleeding&#34;: for Battleaxe &#34;Limbsplitter&#34; for waraxes &#34;Hack and slash&#34;, respectively. However, in the original, these perks are useless little more than full. Especially if you&#39;re playing on Legendary difficulty level, the effect of this perk unnoticed. In the original, the Daedric waraxe inflicted some 18 units damage on 3 rank ofÂ &#34;Limbsplitter&#34; perk.\r<br />So I significantly increased the damage from bleeding in perks &#34;Limbsplitter&#34; and &#34;Hack and slash&#34;\r<br />So, if earlier, the same Daedric Battleaxe applied 12, 15 and 18 units damage by 1, 2 and 3 Ranks &#34;Limbsplitter&#34;, now it gets 45, 70 and 85 units of damage.As you can see, the damage from bleeding was significantly increased, and now perks demand. Most likely you will even enjoy a walk with axes.\r<br />\r<br />In the original battleaxes and waraxes and was applied the same damage from bleeding. Now the battleaxe will do more damage from bleeding than araxes.\r<br />\r<br />Also I corrected the duration of the effect. Now there will be sharp jumps in time steps at different ranks. In the original, for example, the orcish waraxe deals 1 damage for 4 seconds. This is when the first rank &#34;Limbsplitter&#34;. 2 rank duration of 4 seconds perk, too, but at rank 3 has increased the duration of the perk right up to 8 seconds. I fixed the duration of the perk of different ranks in different types of weapons.\r<br />\r<br />There is yet another misunderstanding, which I corrected. Perk does not affect the Nordic, Stalhrim and Dragonbone weapons. Since Dragonbone weapons are the most deadly weapon in the game, and add-ons, and then bleeding it causes the strongest - 90 damage for 8 seconds on the 3rd rank.\r<br />Sorry for my English. I&#39;m russian.",
