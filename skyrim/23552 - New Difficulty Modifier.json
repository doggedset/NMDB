  "summary": "Want to play on Master Difficulty where you do a quarter of the damage of the enemy, but not get 1-shot because an archer caught you off guard? Then this mod might be for you. *Also taking requests*",
  "descriptionHtml": "The problem I ran into while playing on Master Difficulty on most characters is that at low levels I had to be extremely cautious when doing dungeons. That lead to way too much sneaking and hiding around corners while waiting for alerted enemies to go back to normal. I had to pick off one guy at a time so that I wouldn\\'t be taking on 3 or more enemies at a time that could slice through me like butter. I enjoy the challenge of doing less damage, but I don\\'t like being spread on toast.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, at high levels on Master Difficulty I could just 1 shot anything I came across because with maxed out Blacksmithing and Enchanting I could make a bad ass Daedric Bow and have 4 pieces of Fortify Archery gear. Nothing could stand a chance. So now I\\'m the one doing too much damage.\r\n\r\nVanilla Difficulties are as follows:\r\nNovice: You do 2x damage and take 50% less. (Ratio 4:1)\r\nApprentice: You do 1.5x damage and take 25% less. (Ratio 2:1)\r\nAdept: You do normal damage and take normal damage. (Ratio 1:1)\r\nExpert: You do 25% less damage and take 1.5x more damage. (Ratio 1:2)\r\nMaster: You do 50% less damage and take 2x more damage. (Ratio 1:4)\r\n\r\nMy New Difficulty settings are as follows:\r\nNovice: You do normal damage and take 75% less damage. (Ratio 4:1)\r\nApprentice: You do normal damage and take 50% less damage. (Ratio 2:1)\r\nAdept: You do normal damage and take normal damage. (Ratio 1:1)\r\nExpert: You do 50% less damage and take normal damage. (Ratio 1:2)\r\nMaster: You do 75% less damage and take normal damage. (Ratio 1:4)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the damage ratios stay the same. Ultimately this should smooth out huge damage incoming early in game, and the huge out-going damage later in game.\r\n\r\n***Added Optional File for more of a challenge. Don\\'t use both files at once.***\r\nNovice: You do 2x damage and take 75% less damage. (Ratio 8:1)\r\nApprentice: You do 1.5x damage and take 50% less damage. (Ratio 3:1)\r\nAdept: You do normal damage and take normal damage. (Ratio 1:1)\r\nExpert: You do 50% less damage and take 1.5x more damage. (Ratio 1:3)\r\nMaster: You do 75% less damage and take 2x more damage. (Ratio 1:8) \r\n\r\nI figured this type of mod is easy enough that I will take requests. Enjoy.",
