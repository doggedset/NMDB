  "descriptionHtml": "Player Shack V1.2\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nHello there, this is a pretty basic mod I created just to see what I can do with the CK. \r\n\r\nThis mod is a small abandoned shack that is located west of Whiterun, south of Labyrinthian. This place should be automatically located on your map and ready to fast travel there if you wish. This shack features four storage places and nearly every crafting bench (no woodchopping). It is a nice free home for anyone to enjoy, this shack also features no loading to interior cells, it is all out in the open which is a good way to fast travel and walk a few steps to drop off your things and use the many crafting tables available. This is also fully NavMesh\\'d so your followers will still be able to follow right behind you perfectly fine!\r\n\r\nThis place features:\r\n- A bed\r\n- Four storage containers, two of them labelled being a \\\"Potion Barrel\\\" and a \\\"Soul Gem Bag\\\".\r\n- Alchemy table\r\n- Arcane Enchanter\r\n- Tanning rack\r\n- Workbench\r\n- Anvil\r\n- Smelter\r\n- (NEW) Grindstone\r\n- (NEW) A small garden next to the workbench to harvest some flowers\r\n\r\nIt is a nice little place to live if you do not want to live in one of the cities of Skyrim. This mod was going to be more of a personal use mod but I decided just to release it just incase anyone else wants to live in a similar place like this.\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n-------WARNING!------\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\nBefore updating this mod I advise you remove all your items from the containers as they might disappear!!!\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------\r\nV_1.0\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n- Initial release\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nv_1.1\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n- Added a smelter and an anvil outside next to the shack\r\n- Created NavMesh for the shack (seems to be working good for me with Lydia)\r\n\r\n\r\nv_1.2\r\n------------------\r\n- Added a grindstone\r\n- Added a small flower garden with random generated insects near the workbench\r\n- Moved the smelter and anvil (the grindstone is up there too) on a newly added ledge next to the shack which has some extra fencing around. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@@@KNOWN ISSUES@@@\r\n\r\nLuckily Dawnguard DOES NOT confilct with this mod as far as I know and NavMesh is working perfect for me, any issues I may have missed with compatibilty with others mods and such give me a shout!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------\r\nInstallation\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nUnzip the folder and add the .esp file in the skyrim data folder. People using NMM, just let it do its thing and then activate.\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________\r\n\r\nAny problems with this mod please let me know. If you can think of ways I can improve this mod to make it feel better then please do suggest it, I would be happy to hear.",
