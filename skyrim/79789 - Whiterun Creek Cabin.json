  "descriptionHtml": "A cabin outside of Whiterun, near Chillfurrow farm. Includes a dungeon-like area attached to the basement which I plan on expanding upon soon.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;**PLEASE NOTE: This is my first mod. I have little idea on how to fully use the Creation Kit. Criticism is appreciated, honestly.** \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;For a fast way into the cabin just type coc WhiterunCreekCabin in command. \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;This is a work in progress, you will come across a spot in the dungeon where it just stops. I just want opinions on what Im doing wrong so its not as hard to fix in the future. \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Installation should be straightforward, just drag and drop in data folder.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;PS: One of my biggest concerns is how to rename a door so that it actually says Whiterun Creek Cabin instead of just Storage Marker. Help would be appreciated. ",
