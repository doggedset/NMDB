  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to the Elonian Isles - Alpha 0.01\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138]Updates[/color][/b] - \r<br />In making the mod available at such an early and undeveloped state I am hoping to get some feedback on the lay of the land, proportions and the areas that have been designed so far. So if you have feedback  \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138]About[/color][/b] -\r<br />This mod will add a lore-compliant new land, rich in detail and atmosphere.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138]About the Author [/color]- \r<br />[/b]This mod marks my first experience with the creation kit, and while landscaping and game design have come easy, programming has always been one of my weaknesses. Therefore I hope you bear with me as the people, quests and scripts form a little slower than the natural world around them. ",
