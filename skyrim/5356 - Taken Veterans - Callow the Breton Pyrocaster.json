  "descriptionHtml": "Taken Veterans - Balanced Character Builds\r\nCallow - Female Breton Pyrocaster\r\n\r\nAllow me to introduce you to Callow, a level 30 Breton Mage highly skilled in Destruction, Alteration, and Conjuration. Callow feels called to deliver judgement upon the evildoers of Skyrim. Judgement as in death, and death as in by righteous, cleansing fire.\r\n\r\nThis Lawful Neutral bringer of justice lists among her few likes \\\"Obeying Orders\\\", \\\"Following Rules\\\", and \\\"Silent Nods of Assent\\\". Among her numerous dislikes are \\\"Bad-Boys and Rebels\\\", the \\\"Undead\\\", and \\\"Public Displays of Affection\\\". Motivated soley by the rules of society and expectations of others, Callow knows little joy in life. But if you look quickly enough and closely enough, after she\\'s sent a pleading bandit flying, screaming in flames, off a high cliff, it is said, you may just get to see her smile. Briefly.\r\n\r\nIn combat, Callow uses Fire themed spells, bringing down as much damage onto the scene as she can afford, as fast as she can, then picking off the survivors one by one. \r\n\r\nShe has a thin skin, however, and without active Alteration spells and perks, will die quickly in direct engagements.\r\n\r\nCallow comes with 29 unallocated Perk Points, \r\n300 Magicka (+50 Highborn), \r\n190 Health, and \r\n100 Stamina.\r\n\r\nCallow\\'s Initial Skill Ranks:\r\n\tAlteration 100 \r\n\tSneak, Destruction 75\r\n\tConjuration, Speech 60\r\n\tRestoration, Illusion, Enchanting, Light Armor, Heavy Armor, One-Handed, Two-Handed, Block, Smithing, Alchemy, Pickpocket, Lockpicking, Archery 15\r\n\r\n\t1@100\t2@75\t2@60\t13@15\r\n1*(100*101/2) + 2*(75*76/2) + 2*(60*61/2) + 13*(15*16/2)\t\t\t\r\n=15,970 [url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Total Experience Spent In Skills[/url]\r\n\r\nCallow\\'s Starting Spells:\r\n\tBound Sword, Conjure Flame Atronach,  Soul Trap, Bound Bow, Conjure Dremora Lord\r\n\tFire Rune, Firebolt, Fireball, Flame Cloak, Incinerate, Wall of Flames, Fire Storm\r\n\tFast Healing, Steadfast Ward, Close Wounds, Greater Ward, Heal Other, Circle of Protection\r\n\tMagelight, Detect Life, Telekinesis, Waterbreathing, Detect Dead, Ebonyflesh, Paralyze, Equilibrium, Dragonhide, Mass Paralysis\r\n\t\r\nCallow\\'s First Shout:\r\n\tFire Breath\t(Yol Toor Shol)\r\n\t\r\nCallow\\'s Additional Abilities:\r\n\tHighborn (+50 Magicka & Daily Fast Regen)\r\n\tResist Fire 50% (Dunmer Heritage)\r\n\t\r\nCallow\\'s Pyrocasting Gear:\r\n\tCirclet of Eminent Alteration\r\n\tExpert Robes of Destruction\t\r\n\t\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n3.0 Best version.\r\n2.0 Callow is more powerful still\r\n1.1 was given slightly increased offensive power over version 1.0, at the cost of drastically reduced capabilties in support skills.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhenever a character earns a rank, r, in a skill they gain r experience. When a character has 0 in all skills they have zero experience, and when they have 100 in all skills, at level 81.5, they have 90,900 experience. A character normally hits Level 30 at 15,865 Total Experience.\r\n\r\nTaken Veterans should look good with any texture or mesh mods you may use, if any. The mods used in the screenshots include:\r\nFace Textures (Female): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3563]Coverwomen[/url]\r\nFace Textures (Male): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=26]Detailed Faces[/url]\r\n\r\nLook in the discussions area for the batch commands allowing you to make a veteran out of a character you\\'ve created yourself!\r\n\r\nMore Info:\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Experience Table[/url]\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimCharBatch]Tips on making your own veterans[/url]\r\n\r\nDrop a Taken Veteran save game in your Saves folder and load it up.
