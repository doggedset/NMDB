  "descriptionHtml": " They said it couldn\\'t be done. They laughed at me and called me insane. But I ask you...whos laughing now? Ha, ha ha, hahahahahahahhaha! ~cough hack~\r\n  I figured all green dragons would get boring after a bit, so I added some color to the flying bastards.  While I can only spawn an Elder dragon to test out the mod, rest assured the most common dragons are indeed green. Ice are Cerulean, Earth is Brown, etc. Even the bones are Creeperized. Enjoy.\r\n Credit goes to CyK for the flash of brilliance.\r\n To install, simply stick the \\\"textures\\\" folder in your \\\"Data\\\" folder and play.",
