Ingenue\r\nAll other voices ... Brewskie\r\n\r\nIf you would like to voice some of the characters in Lamplight please visit the Voice Actors thread at the mod\\'s web site: http://lamplight.pcgamingnetwork.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=19\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe premise of the mod is to create a new guild of Bandit outlaws. They are all over Skyrim but where do they come from? What\\'s their story?\r\n\r\nI hope to answer those questions, er... at least make something up :)\r\n\r\nLamplight - The Bandit Guild is now in beta. This means that the heart of the story and quests are now going to be created.\r\n\r\nTo read the story line there will be a special post at the mod web site link above.\r\n\r\nEven though the mod is in beta nothing is finalized, including the lighting, buildings or anything else. Anything can change as it is being developed.\r\n\r\nThe mod starts with a visit to the Southern entrance to the town of Lamplight where a group of bandits are at guard.\r\n\r\nThe player is informed that they are not welcome and will attack of the player doesn\\'t leave.\r\n\r\nAs the player walks away he is confronted by \\\"Scurrvy\\\" who gives the player instructions on how to get in to Lamplight.\r\n\r\nOnce the player follows the instructions given by Surrvy the bandits guarding the entrance will have disappeared. This is only temporary as there will be a new confrontation with these bandits in the next release of the mod (Beta 3)\r\n\r\nYou can get in to Lamplight after the initial quest. If you would like to see most of the characters that will later be in the quests within Lamplight go in to the Tavern. BTW...you can disregard the dragon sitting on the Tavern...he will be in one of the quests later in the game.\r\n\r\nRemember, the more input I get from the people using the mod the better I can make it. So please give me your thoughts!\r\n\r\n/****************/\r\n/* Gaming Notes */\r\n/****************/\r\n\r\nWhile the bandits greet the player as I intended they sometimes take a while to actually walk up to the player. I am working on finding a solution to this.\r\n\r\nWhen the initial greetings are finished the player finds themselves in a certain place. I left the door unlocked so you can get out and into lamplight. The next version will be 1st quest for the guild.\r\n\r\n/****************************/\r\n/* Conflict With Other Mods */\r\n/****************************/\r\n\r\nToo early to know. But unless some other mod is using the same space in Tamriel there should be no problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n/****************/\r\n/* Known Issues */\r\n/****************/\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you discover any problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n/****************/\r\n/* Installation */\r\n/****************/\r\n\r\nCopy lamplight.esp, lamplight.bsl & lamplight.bsa from the downloaded archive to your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n/****************/\r\n/* UnInstall */\r\n/****************/\r\n\r\nIf you have an earlier version of Lamplight please delete the following folders before installing this version.\r\nHopefully this will be the last change in installation methods.\r\nBefore you uninstall please leave the interior of Lamplight Town, if your character is now there, and create a save point.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall delete the following files from the Date folder:\r\n\r\nlamplight.esp\r\nlamplight.bsl\r\nlamplight.bsa\r\n\r\n\r\n/*************/\r\n/* Changelog */\r\n/*************/\r\n\r\nInitial scenes to get the player started complete.\r\nHundreds of touch ups on the exteriors.\r\n\r\n\r\n/*********/\r\n/* To Do */\r\n/*********/\r\n\r\nNow that the mod is in beta the quest making and story lines will begin.\r\n\r\n/***********/\r\n/* Credits */\r\n/***********/\r\n\r\nMajor credit goes to Ingenue who did the scripting and quest building for the intro. Ingenue is a quest maker extraordinaire!\r\n\r\nIngenue was also the voice of Pengae\r\n\r\nLots of help and tips from:\r\n\r\nJustinOther\r\nh4vent\r\nAlexander J. Velicky\r\nAmethyst Deceiver\r\n\r\nAnd as always, the great help you can get at these web sites:\r\n\r\nBethsoft forums: http://forums.bethsoft.com/forum/184-the-creation-kit/\r\nSkyrim Nexus: http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/forum/419-skyrim-modding/\r\nTES Alliance: http://tesalliance.org/forums/\r\n\r\nIf I have overlooked others who has specifically helped it was completely inadvertant.
