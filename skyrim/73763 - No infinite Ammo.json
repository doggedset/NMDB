  "descriptionHtml": "Hi everyone&#33;\r<br />First of all sorry for my English and mistakes, which i will commit. If you fond some let me know and i will improve it ;)\r<br />I was always desgusted when in fight NPC use bows, but them ammo has never ends. \r<br />You probably know this event:\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Story\r<br />DDovahkiin: &#34;I have super deadric arrow. And i going to kill these Bandits in the tower.&#34; \r<br />(You&#39;re sneaking, then aiming to bandit, and at least you shooting)\r<br />Bandit Boss: (He get some demage, but not much) &#34;You are dead right now.&#34; \r<br />(he stay on the top of tower, equip long bow and Your&#39;s deadric arrow and he start shooting to you when you kill another bandits by your&#39;s BIG AXE or something else)\r<br />Suddenly your health drops to half, you go heal by potions or spells, you see that you have a dedric arrow on your knee but you go back to fight. Then you get the second arrow, this time on the second knee. \r<br />D: &#34;Hey this is my deadric arrow too, WTF man i shoot you only once&#34;\r<br />B: &#34;hahahahaha You,re like my cousin&#39;s cat....&#34; - or some else nerdy text\r<br />That was the last what you say, because on this moment you get a special gift - third deadric arrow and you fall down form the walls. \r<br />All skyrim crying because of your&#39;s dead.\r<br />Aludiun, Wampires, Ancano, and more Rule/destroy the world, people is skyrim kill chickens&#33; \r<br />because bandit can multiply arrows on the middle of fight.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Ini Tweak\r<br />What it is?\r<br />\r<br />A super pro top secret informations, about your skyrim. Only God and informatiks can understand it.\r<br />As we know informatiks aren&#39;t helpful on that kind of situations but God sometimes send a messages to immortal people.\r<br />One of them contains: \r<br />[Combat]\r<br />bForceNPCsUseAmmo=1\r<br />\r<br />What it mean?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />b - it is probably a letter, no it is DEFINITELY a letter&#33;\r<br />Force - it is about StarWars and midichlorians, you need a Force to do something in skyrim.\r<br />Force is everywere, so if you are a jedi knight you will have easier.\r<br />NPCs - &#34;Non Player Characters&#34; Dont ask it is too hard, even God don&#39;t know.\r<br />Use - It is probably about using force\r<br />Ammo - I have no idea what it is... There isn&#39;t any guns in Skyrim so who need ammo?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />What it do?\r<br />This is a simple setting on Skyrim.\r<br />It make that every NPC have limited arrows and he can use it all.\r<br />So when dragon atack the city, guards will shoot to him, but after a few minutes they will be only runing around the city and don&#39;t know what to do, because dragon is flying and them dont have arrows to shoot him.\r<br />For me it is really immersive and add a lot of fun to game.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />How to use it?\r<br />It is no so hard...\r<br />\r<br />First of all be patient, possessed and clear your mind.\r<br />\r<br />There is two ways:\r<br />First: download this mod and install it (the archive contain two magic files: *.esp and *.ini)\r<br />Secound: open &#34;My documents&#34; next go to &#34;my games&#34; catalog, then &#34;skyrim&#34; catalog and at least open &#34;skyrim.ini&#34; by notebook and under the [Combat] title paste it:\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />bForceNPCsUseAmmo=1\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you dont have [Combat] title, simple create it.\r<br />\r<br />The full road to this file:\r<br />\r<br />(Disc,where you have installed skyrim):/Documends and settings/(name of your account)/My documents/my games/skyrim/skyrim.ini\r<br />On 90% it is:\r<br />\r<br />C;/Documends and settings/User/Mydocumenys/mygames/skyrimskyrim.ini\r<br />\r<br />For disable change 1 to 0.\r<br />It is all\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Difficulties\r<br />\r<br />This tweak have a small trap:\r<br />\r<br />Some NPC have only a few arrows so they beame totally unless.\r<br />For example: Dwemer Ballista have only one arrow... bolt... whatever, and after single shot this top technology machine cant do nothing. It will stay or run away.\r<br />\r<br />So i created his is really small, frendly and fully compatible mod (Compatible with DLC&#39;s and mods), which make that NPC have a little more arrows than in vanilla Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Example:\r<br />City guards have 50 arrows. \r<br />Dewmer Balistas have 10 bolts\r<br />Bandits have 30 arrows.\r<br />Special archers NPC have 100 arrows\r<br />inc.\r<br />\r<br />(I&#39;m open for sugestions)\r<br />\r<br />Now you can use your head in fight vs archer.\r<br />&#34;Rush hard&#34;\r<br />You can run with big sword or something else, to him and try kill him.\r<br />&#34;Camp&#34;\r<br />Or you can hide using shield or terrain and wait for out of arrows your enemy.\r<br />&#34;Archer fight&#34;\r<br />He shoot you, you shoot him and will see which will die first.\r<br />Yours companions also have limited arrows so you must sometimes give it them if you want they use bows/crossbows.",
