  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][b]DESCRIPTION   \r<br />\r<br />[/b][/size][size=3][b]Jorrvaskr is home of Companions. And the warriors of Companions are training so hard. For completing a simple they are traveling the other side of Skyrim. And in the end of the day. They earn a relax I think. But wait.. Jorrvaskr garden is not so good :(Â \r<br />\r<br />[/b][/size][font=Comic Sans MS][b]So this is why I made this mod. Enhanced Jorrvaskr Garden makes Jorrvaskr&#39;s garden much better. This is an early version. In other versions I&#39;m going to make it better.\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/font][b]IMPORTANT: MOD IS IN ALPHA STATE. AND THERE IS SOME BUGS. BUT THIS WILL NOT EFFECT YOUR GAMEPLAY.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim[/b]",
