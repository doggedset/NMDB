  "descriptionHtml": "Existing spells like Firebolt or Icy Spear are now affected by gravity.\r\nMakes the game slightly more difficult until you master the physics, but much more fun.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve altered only projectiles types, so we should be compatible to most other mods. Range and speed altering mods (like Longer Range) should be loaded before this one, they could overwrite something. It\\'s quite stable, i\\'ve played about 30 levels with this mod before it has been made public. ",
