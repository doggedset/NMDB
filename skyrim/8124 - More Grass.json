Making for some more scenic and beautiful scenes!\r\n\r\n                                                       ---INSTALL---\r\n\r\nDrop the file into the data folder and activate it in the launcher! yes, it is really that simple! To uninstall simply un-check the file in the launcher and delete MoreGrass.esp from the data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    ---OTHER NOTES---\r\n\r\nThis will most likely be a relatively large toll on your system. Running a 9800 GT with a few other graphics mods reduced my FPS, newer systems should not take much of a FPS hit.\r\n\r\nThe file is also hosted in the Steam Workshop by me! \r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=8256\r\n\r\nIf you like it feel free to endorse, upload your own images, and comment!",
