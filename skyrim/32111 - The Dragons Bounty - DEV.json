The mod is currently in its earliest stages of development but I have high hopes and lofty aspirations for it. The end goal is for it to be a fully voice acted story driven quest line that fits the lore and overall feel of Skyrim 110%.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/N5ubLgu.png[/img][img]http://i.imgur.com/o07wTwa.png[/img][img]http://i.imgur.com/zJLtSya.png[/img][/center]\r\nTherbjorn, a true blooded Nord, was once a terror on the high seas. Merchant ships from Hammerfell to Black Marsh feared his mighty ship, the Fyrdraca, the Fire Dragon. However, Therbjorn was betrayed when his first mate, a Dunmer called Drosil, lead a mutiny that left Therbjorn without a ship. His beloved ship in the hands of a usurper, Therbjorn spent many years chasing after it, but always Drosil remained one step ahead of him.\r\n\r\nFinally, tired of the chase, Therbjorn settled down in Dawnstar where he met a kind young woman named Valeria. The two fell in love and Therbjorn gave up his life of pillaging, plundering, and pirating. As chance would have it, however, not long after the two married a great storm happened upon the Fyrdraca just as it was sailing past Dawnstar. It smashed the vessel upon the rocks and sunk it there.\r\n\r\nThe next day while fishing, Therbjorn discovered it, though he could hardly believe it. Sure enough, there lay his ship in ruins. Many of the surviving crewmen had already fleed but many remained. Drosil, it turns out, had decieved them all in to believing Therbjorn was dead and discovering their old captain still lived they quickly drove Drosil far in to the hinterlands and returned to Therbjorn.\r\n\r\nNow with a crew and the remains of a ship Therbjorn decided to seek absolution for his former life of crime and commissioned the shipwright of Dawnstar to rebuild the Fyrdraca so he and his loyal men could seek to rid Tamriel of sea raiders, pirates, and brigands.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Therbjorn is quickly running out of funds and helping hands. And this, my friend, is where you come in...\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/N5ubLgu.png[/img][img]http://i.imgur.com/QKlzxq7.png[/img][img]http://i.imgur.com/zJLtSya.png[/img][/center]\r\nCurrently, it\\'s just me working on this mod. Unfortunately I don\\'t have nearly enough know-how, time, energy, and resources to do it all on my own. For this reason I am now seeking to recruit like minded individuals willing to take on some of the workload and bring their knowledge, experience, and perspective to the project.\r\n\r\nPrimarily I am looking for individuals skilled in scripting and quest creation. In addition I am also in need of several voice actors. Finally I would also be quite happy if I had one or two people capable of modeling, skinning, etc. Anyone who has any experience in group projects like this would also be greatly appreciated. If you are interested in filling any of these roles please feel free to contact me. Send me a PM, tell me a bit about yourself, your skills, etc. and we can work something out.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/N5ubLgu.png[/img][img]http://i.imgur.com/hAWiuVR.png[/img][img]http://i.imgur.com/zJLtSya.png[/img][/center]\r\n-Fully voice acted dialogue.\r\n-Several hours of gameplay.\r\n-Customizable/managable ship and crew.\r\n-Customizable/managable island hideout/town.\r\n-Visit the nine provinces of Tamriel and beyond!\r\n-Many new items.\r\n-Immersion, role play, and lore oriented.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/N5ubLgu.png[/img][img]http://i.imgur.com/d3tXejz.png[/img][img]http://i.imgur.com/zJLtSya.png[/img][/center]\r\nCurrently in development.
