  "descriptionHtml": "[color=pink]\r<br />&#34;It&#39;s a bad mutha...&#34; \r<br />&#34;Shut yo&#39; mouth&#33;&#34;\r<br />&#34;Just talkin&#39; &#39;bout the escape shaft&#33;&#34;\r<br />\r<br />My first level design mod, built because as a mostly-friendly werewolf, I thought it might be nice to be able to make my way out of my home when the moons are high without the unwanted side-effect of causing widespread panic or pitchfork-wielding mobs in the city.\r<br />\r<br />When I started making this, it was just going to be a tunnel from under Hjerim to outside the city. But then I got addicted to making tunnels. So I added another one that provides access to the Palace of Kings. But then I thought the Dunmer might start complaining about how racist I am if I didn&#39;t provide the Gray Quarter with access to these tunnels, so I did that too. \r<br />\r<br />Located conveniently near the river and out of sight of most townies, it&#39;s the perfect get-away for werewolves, vampires, or well, just about anyone. \r<br />\r<br />This is not a storage mod or house expansion mod. There&#39;s a few amenities and surprises, though. The only thing changed in vanilla locations is the addition of trap-door access in out of the way spots and slight shuffling of things around them (see screenshots). No containers were moved, so items stored in Hjerim should be safe.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Features[/u]\r<br />Underground Access to New Gnisis Corner Club, Palace of Kings and Hjerim.\r<br />3 weapon display plaques \r<br />An Armory Chest for storing big stuff\r<br />A functional shrine to Talos\r<br />2 Bedrolls \r<br />A whole strongbox for storing little shiny stuff\r<br />A small respawning flower garden with Deathbell,Nightshade,Jazbay, Dragon&#39;s Tongue and Cotton flower. \r<br />Follower Friendly (fully navmeshed)\r<br />Mostly Werewolf Friendly\r<br />Vampire friendly too&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Notes:[/u]\r<br />-It is marked as a public area. Meaning you CAN be persued through these tunnels. However, the narrow space makes for hilarity when being chased by more than a couple of NPCs. (Found this out while test driving werewolf form through the tunnels. Had a wild hair and used the Palace of Kings exit. Had Ulfric and the whole throne room chasing me through the tunnels.)\r<br />-Keep that in mind when you have followers with you. Sometimes they will get caught up in the shaft sections, but for the most part I&#39;ve found they follow with no problems. And even if they do decide they don&#39;t want to go that way, walking back near to them will generally kick start them into following again. \r<br />-The trap door access under the Palace of the Kings may require you to jump to enter it. This is by design. :3\r<br />-No known mod conflicts at this time.\r<br />-Some lighting mods may make these tunnels very dark. Screenshots are with vanilla lighting.\r<br />-Bigger werewolf models might have to do some wiggling to get through the stair/tunnel section under the Palace of Kings. I have no problem, but it occurs to me that all werewolf may not be created equal.\r<br />\r<br />Comments and constructive criticism welcome. I hope some of you find it as useful as I do. [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][u]Updates[/u]:\r<br />[1.03]\r<br />-Added ambient music to further enhance the escape shaft experience.\r<br />-Fixed the floating coals under Palace of Kings.\r<br />-Fixed doorway under Palace of Kings.\r<br />[1.02]\r<br />-Fixed the weapon plaques Under Hjerim. They will now faithfully hold their prizes close to the wall instead of letting them float in the middle of the room.\r<br />-Added an Armory Chest to Under Hjerim.\r<br />-Added a little more decoration to Under Hjerim, lest it be outdone by the other two undercity access points. \r<br />[1.01]\r<br />-Fixed annoying clipping issue with Under Palace of the Kings Door by totally removing it. :P\r<br />-Added more ambient sounds to enhance the escape shaft experience.\r<br />-Fixed an error on the ghostly caretaker&#39;s note.\r<br />-Made the ghostly caretaker more interesting by giving her things to do, including a re-enactment of her final hours every day. Tragic&#33;\r<br />-Added a candle under Hjerim, for those with lighting mods that might make it too dark. \r<br />[1.00]\r<br />-Launch Version\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=cyan][u]Installation:[/u]\r<br />Drop esp into data folder, enable and enjoy&#33; Or&#33; Use the NMM&#33;\r<br />To uninstall, disable and delete&#33; Or&#33; Use the NMM&#33;\r<br />[/color]",
