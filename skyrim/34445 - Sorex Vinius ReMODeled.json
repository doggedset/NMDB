  "descriptionHtml": "Hi guys. I am a long time lurker on the Nexus and after being relatively disappointed by what was available for the husband characters out there, I finally decided to do it myself. I am not a modder by any means, but I was happy enough with my results and I thought I\\'d share it with others who might be looking for the same. \r\n\r\nI have only changed Sorex\\'s appearance. The only mod that is required is Apachii\\'s SkyHair for males. To make things simple I used only vanilla eyes and resources. The ENB used in the screenshot (simple for now, I just spawned him and took a quick one) is UNBLEAK by Trustinall and can be found here (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24828).",
