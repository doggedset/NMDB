Due to more popularity then I anticipated from my wallpaper set I\\'ve decided to make a menu re-placer out of 26 most popular pictures from that set! All the photos in this pack are my Scenic images taken across Skyrim, from sweeping vistas to dark caverns, this main menu re-placer is sure to bring your drab start screen to life! \r\n\r\n-All images are unedited HiRes screenshots taken in game with over 150 mods enabled at one time to give these re-placers the most immersive feeling I feel I can reach\r\n\r\n-This is not your average Menu Re-Placer that just has a bunch of scantily clad women! I pride myself of being a photographer both in game and in real life, so these photos are more artistic then some of the other menu-re-placers you\\'ll find around the Nexus.
