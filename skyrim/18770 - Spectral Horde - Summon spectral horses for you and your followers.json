If you didn\\'t use such a mod so far, go and get UFO, it\\'s absolutely perfect for playing with followers)\r\n[*] [b]Choose between 18 distinct spectral effects [/b] (ingame configuration)\r\n[*] [b]Incorporate the effect of your horse [/b] (this is optional, watch the video to see it in action)\r\n[*] [b]Don\\'t worry about your horses when fighting[/b] (they will automatically be desummoned) \r\n[*] [b]Ingame configuration[/b] (opens up when reading the book)\r\n[*] [b]Choose between a broad range of speed options[/b] \r\n[*] [b]Optional: Waterwalking for spectral horses[/b]. With version 1.6 of Skyrim, this feature now works as it should.\r\n[*] [b]Optional: Infinite Stamina for spectral horses[/b]\r\n[*]  [color=#99CCFF][i]New:[/i][/color] [b]Finally, you can apply the spectral effect to you AND your followers[/b] (fully controlable by a lesser power). While this effect is purely visual, it can even become useful in some situations. For example consider the case, when your followers cannot be seen well in the dark, then it will help to prevent you from attacking them instead of the enemy.\r\n[*] [color=#99CCFF][i]New:[/i][/color] You can deactivate the spectral horse for the player, so that you can use any horse you like while your followers still get spectral horses.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#cccccc] [size=18]INSTALLATION[/size][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] As usual, download manually, extract into your data folder and activate the esp and bsa or use the mod manager of your choice.\r\n[*] Update instructions (v1.1.0): When updating from 1.0.2, just replace v102 with v110 and play. Users updating from versions below 1.0.2 have to perform a clean save before installing 1.1.0.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#cccccc] [size=18]HOW TO USE[/size][/color]\r\n[list] \r\n[*] You need to buy the book \\'The Spirit of the Horde\\' from Urag gro-Shug at the College of Winterhold. By reading it, you obtain the Spell \\'Summon Spectral Horde\\' which allows you to summon a horse for you and (at second use, if you\\'ve chosen more than one horse in the configuration dialogue) the horde for your followers. When mounting, you incorporate the spectral effect of your horse (if you didn\\'t deactivate this option), which can be chosen in the configuration dialogue (that popups when reading the book).\r\n\r\n[*] [color=#99CCFF][i]Version 1.1.0:[/i][/color] You only need to buy the \\'The Spirit of the Horde 3rd Edition\\' from Urag\\'s Shop to get all new features. By reading this book you can (optionally) get two new lesser powers, which allow you to apply and fully control the spectral effects also on you and your followers (Auto-Incorporation of the player when mounting is now an option). \r\n\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[color=#cccccc] [size=18]COMPATIBILITY[/size][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Ready for Skyrim 1.6, but you only need 1.5 to get all features. \r\n\r\n[*] In order to allow your followers to ride, you\\'ll need a mod which adds this functionality, preferably [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037][color=#cccccc][i]UFO[/i][/color][/url], but it also works with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11193][color=#cccccc][i]Horses for Followers[/i][/color][/url]. I added an optional file for compatibility with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15524][color=#cccccc][i]Amazing Follower Tweaks[/i][/color][/url].\r\n\r\n[*] The only change in the Skyrim world is the inventory of Urag\\'s shop. Thus it should be compatible with any other mod, including horse mods. In the case that you cannot find the added book, please tell me. \r\n\r\n[*] [color=#99CCFF][i]Notice:[/i][/color] For those worrying about peformance and running background scripts: This mod focusses on keeping the code as simple as possible, without using any recurring listening events (no RegisterFor(Single)Update + OnUpdate etc...) such that conflicts with other mods are very unlikely and performance should only be affected by the use of the graphical effects, not by overdone scripting. \r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#cccccc] [size=18]ISSUES[/size][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Sometimes one of your followers can fall into the ground, when you desummon the horde while your followers are mounted. If this happens to you, then just call him or her to relax and he or she will step out of the ground again.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#99CCFF] [size=18]UPDATES[/size][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] 0.9 - First release\r\n[*] 0.9.5 - Added an option to switch the incorporation effect on and off. \r\n[*] New optional file: Support for \\'Amazing Follower Tweaks\\'. (Sorry, the first version had an issue, which is now fixed)\r\n[*] 1.0.1 - Fixed two issues, added more options and features (toggle waterwalking, toggle infinite Stamina, more speed options) AND changed the default setting for the incorporation effect to OFF, since it probablty is too fancy and extending it to followers would be quite buggy.\r\n[*] 1.0.2 - Fixed an issue, which caused your horse to vanish when attacked and riding while the incorporation effect is switched off.\r\n[*]  [color=99CCFF]1.1.0[/color] - Now the spectral effect can be applied to your followers, too. The effect is fully controlable by using the new (optional) powers (Auto-Incorporation for the player when mounting is now optional). Moreover this adds an option to deactivate the spectral player horse (so you can use any regular horse, while your followers profit from spectral horses). See changelog for more details.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#cccccc] [size=18]PLANS[/size][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Usability: I want to get better control on followers when mounted, but perhaps this needs UFO to be more responsible to horses...\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#cccccc] [size=20]CREDITS[/size][/color]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Brokunn - This was greatly inspired by the mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9534]Conjure Rideable Ethereal Horse Spell[/url] by Brokunn. Thanks a lot to Brokunn for his idea.\r\n[*] Gopher - for the idea of getting a complete horde of spectral horses ([url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/507]Skyrim Mod Sanctuary[/url], [url=http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE36E33A53254841A]Let\\'s play[/url])\r\n[*] fLokii - for the ultimate follower overhaul ([url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO[/url])\r\n[/list]",
