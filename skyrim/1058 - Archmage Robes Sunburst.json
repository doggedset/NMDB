  "descriptionHtml": "I just got my Archrobes in game and while I like the look I honestly wanted something more arrogant and gaughty. I mean hey, I\\'m the archmage. I call it Sunburst as it kind of reminds me of the sunburst effect on numerous Gibson guitars.\r\n\r\nThis is my very fist mod I\\'ve ever done for any game so if it sucks I\\'m sorry in advance :) Honestly though unless you just don\\'t like colorful stuff I think it\\'s pretty neat.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\nTo install all you need to do is extract the file to your Data folder for Skyrim.\r\n\r\nPlease leave comments and let me know what you think. Be nice it\\'s my first :)",
