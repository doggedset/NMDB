  "descriptionHtml": "Hey all :)\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a New Medieval Style Village Outside Solitude Inspired by The Witcher. I made this mode Because I felt the outside of Solitude was unbelievably empty. The buildings are from another mod called Syerscote. Made by the Great [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4286516]samv96UK[/url]. If it wasn&#39;t for him/her giving me permission to use his meshes, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to Post this mod at all&#33; Thanks again man&#33; :)\r<br />\r<br />The features of this mod are:\r<br />\r<br />- An Entirely new Town outside solitude.\r<br />- New Entrance leading into Solitude. Walk the the Lower class of Solitude then Enter the Upper Class.\r<br />- New NPC&#39;s that have their daily and Night time activities. (They are still currently called &#34;Prisoner&#34; I will Rename them soon)\r<br />- A new Tavern called &#34;the Lazy Horse Inn&#34; that the NPC&#39;s go to at night time. (still needs a Barman) \r<br />- New crowd sounds for the town and tavern (Currently having issues with the sounds not turning off at night.)\r<br />\r<br />There is currently no collision on the buildings, so you can walk through them. :/ I will fix this by adding collision markers.\r<br />\r<br />Future Plans\r<br />\r<br />- Create shops\r<br />- Named NPC&#39;s\r<br />- Make all houses enterable\r<br />- Tweaks\r<br />\r<br />OF course there are bugs. And i plan on fixing them ASAP.
