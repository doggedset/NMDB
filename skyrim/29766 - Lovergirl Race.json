  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i46.tinypic.com/716wig.png[/img]\r<br />&#34;Once in a blue moon, one is born into Tamriel with the blessing of Dibella upon her. Avatars of Dibella are gifted with unsurpassed beauty, as well as a silver tongue. Even the most steadfast of hearts cannot resist being swayed by the fair maidens dubbed &#39;lovergirls&#39;.&#34; - [i]Yngvar the Singer[/i][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDEAD][size=2pt][b]Note:[/b] This race is based on an old version of Enhanced Character Edit (v0.86). Lovergirl Race is not compatible with kapaer&#39;s Character Making Extender by default. They can be made compatible with one another, but the new sliders will make my presets useless. If you wish to use CME, I recommend making the switch to ECE. I will provide detailed instructions in the near future if you [i]really[/i] want to use Lovergirl Race with CME.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Description:[/b][/color] Lovergirl Race is based on Enhanced Character Edit and currently features four female presets based on my followers Charlotte, Nina, Scarlet, and Violet. I was frustrated that ECE&#39;s assets acted as replacers for in-game NPCs. Therefore, headparts used by Lovergirl Race point to meshes, textures, and tri files in a separate directory, leaving vanilla NPCs alone. More presets may be added in the future as I create more followers. My current followers have been uploaded as a separate mod; [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29789]Lovergirls[/url].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Race Features:[/b][/color]\r<br />Dibella&#39;s Whisper (Power) - Calms nearby people for 60 seconds.\r<br />Dibella&#39;s Aegis (Active Effect) - Grants a 20% resistance to magic.\r<br />Four female face presets.\r<br />CharGen morphs including Eye Depth = Eye Tilt and Jaw Forward = Nose Width from ECE.\r<br />52 eye color combinations from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12951]ECE[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722]The Eyes of Beauty[/url].\r<br />17 scars from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3574]Gizmodians Scars[/url].\r<br />10 tattoos/warpaints from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25211]Female Face Tattoo Warpaint[/url].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Requirements:[/b][/color] Lovergirl Race requires Skyrim v1.8.151+. If you have a skeleton_female.nif using BBP or similar in meshesactorscharactercharacter assets female, you must overwrite the body meshes that come with Lovergirl Race with ones that are BBP-compatible. Neglecting to do this will likely result in CTDs.\r<br />\r<br />In the Main File archives, I&#39;ve left out the optional RaceCompatibility scripts for USKP, UFO, and Better Vampires. If you have these mods installed, you&#39;ll need to install their compatibility scripts from the All-in-One package located [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24168]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Installation:[/b][/color] Download the relevant main file and extract the contents to your Data folder. Enable RaceCompatibility.esm and Lovergirl Race.esp in your mod manager. In order to fix the vampire gaunt face, I highly recommend downloading azarathkhan&#39;s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22477]No Vampire Sunken Face for ECE[/url] mod and extracting the femaleheadchargen.tri file to meshesBSnakeLovergirl Racefaceparts.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Upgrade Installation:[/b][/color]\r<br />If you&#39;re upgrading from v1.0.0 to v1.0.1 (Dawnguard), please delete the old &#34;Lovergirl Race DG.esp&#34; file from your Data folder. It has been renamed to &#34;Lovergirl Race.esp&#34; due to compatibility with my released followers mod. The side effect of this is that the game will no longer recognize your race and it will revert to Nord - your face will be missing. I apologize, but there is no way to fix this without starting a new game. I previously recommended using the &#34;playersetrace Ygnordrace&#34; command, but you will lose your face again upon loading your save. Your stats/perks will likely mess up as well.\r<br />\r<br />However, there is a way to retrieve your face data for use in a new save. This requires some work in the CK. First, load your save with the missing face. Export your face data using the &#34;spf name&#34; console command without quotation marks. This will create a .npc file in your Skyrim installation folder.\r<br />\r<br />Next, open Lovergirl Race.esp in the CK and duplicate one of the race presets. You can find these in the Object Window by typing &#34;LovergirlFemalePreset&#34; in the Filter. Click the Character Gen Parts tab, click Import, and select your created .npc file. Click OK, search for YgNordRace, click the radio button next to Female, switch to the Preset NPCs tab, drag and drop your new preset into the list, and click OK. Save the esp file and you should now be able to retrieve your face data upon starting a new game.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Customization:[/b][/color] You can use whatever face, complexion, body, eye, scar, and warpaint mods you desire by overwriting the files in meshesBSnakeLovergirl Race and texturesBSnakeLovergirl Race. Make sure to overwrite existing files using the same file name, else your new assets won&#39;t be recognized by the race. Do not change the femalehead.nif in meshesBSnakeLovergirl Race or the tri files in meshesBSnakeLovergirl Racefaceparts, else you may experience strange chargen morphs. Lovergirl Race uses your skeleton_female.nif in meshesactorscharactercharacter assets female in hopes of providing BBP support.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Compatibility:[/b][/color]\r<br />Lovergirl Race works with the latest Enhanced Character Edit (v1.05), but it is incompatible with old versions of ECE&#39;s YgNord race (v0.86) due to the way they are both scripted. If you experience CTDs with both races enabled, you must disable EnhancedCharacterEdit.esp in your mod manager in order to use this race. This race (along with most custom races) is also incompatible with the Skyrim NPC Editor. Belua Sanguinare Revisited currently does not work with this race (nor with ECE&#39;s YgNord, coincidentally).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Recommended Mods:[/b][/color]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33226]Precache Killer[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9557]Alternate Start - Live Another Life[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29624/]RaceMenu[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28978]Pretty Motion Package[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13173]numenume elf ear[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14205]Calyps Animal Ears - Craftable Headwear[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]F.A.Q.:[/b][/color]\r<br />Q: My hair/color/morph sliders won&#39;t change.\r<br />A: Finish character creation, wait a bit for your quests/mods to load, and then use showracemenu in the console.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Skyrim keeps crashing when I set my race to Lovergirl.\r<br />A: Change your Nord sex from male to female and then switch to Lovergirl. Make sure you&#39;re in a relatively empty interior cell. Install the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33226]Precache Killer[/url] or disable some hair mods in your mod manager.\r<br />\r<br />Q: My character&#39;s eyes are raised like unholy zombies.\r<br />A: These are the vanilla eyes. They show up on Lovergirl Race due to the Racial Compatibility script dynamically adding the race to all human formlists. Please ignore these eyes, which will be on the left side of the eye color slider.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Garan Marethi keeps calling me a mortal after I receive Lord Harkon&#39;s gift.\r<br />A: This has been fixed in Lovergirl Race (Dawnguard) v1.0.2. If you&#39;re upgrading from v1.0.1, please load a save before receiving Harkon&#39;s gift. Open the console and enter &#34;StopQuest LovergirlRaceController&#34; without quotation marks. Then enter &#34;ResetQuest LovergirlRaceController&#34; and &#34;StartQuest LovergirlRaceController&#34;. You may need to close the console and open it again after typing each command. Proceed to receive Harkon&#39;s gift - Garan Marethi should now recognize you as a vampire. Thanks to christmaskfc and TMPhoenix for their help in pinpointing and solving this issue.\r<br />\r<br />Alternatively, a roundabout solution is to use the console command &#34;player.setrace ygNordRaceVampire&#34; without quotation marks or become bitten by a vampire.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I can&#39;t transform as a Belua Sanguinare Revisited vampire using this race.\r<br />A: This is also an issue with ECE&#39;s YgNord race, which this race is based off of. A comment has been left on BSR&#39;s mod page; please wait until the author can help pinpoint the problem.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Some of the scars look incorrect or they barely show up.\r<br />A. This is currently being looked into.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I upgraded to v1.0.1 (Dawnguard) and my face is missing.\r<br />A. Unfortunately, you must start a new game. You can retrieve your facial slider values by following the instructions in the Upgrade Installation section above.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Uninstallation:[/b][/color] Delete the Lovergirl Race folder in DatameshesBSnake and DatatexturesBSnake. Delete Lovergirl Race.esp from your Data directory. Then delete the LovergirlRaceController.pex script from your DataScripts folder. Keep the RaceCompatibility.esm if you plan to use other custom races that rely on it. If not, delete the esm file and associated scripts from DataScripts. Note that uninstalling Lovergirl Race may result in errors if you&#39;re using the followers Scarlet or Violet from my soon-to-be-released Lovergirls mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFDAB9][b]Thanks and Credits:[/b][/color]\r<br />Thank you so much to the following authors for granting me either express or free-to-use permissions to use their assets:\r<br />\r<br />RAN46, tktk\r<br />A&K Team\r<br />caliente\r<br />dimon99\r<br />LogRaam\r<br />Gizmodian, Xenius\r<br />TairenSoul\r<br />Expired6978\r<br />TMPhoenix\r<br />\r<br />Thank you to all of the beta testers for helping me work out the mod&#39;s kinks.
