  "summary": "This, dare I say, could actually replace your keyboard and mouse&#33;&#33; Its a very detailed controller layout for the Xbox 360 controller.",
  "descriptionHtml": "***************** UPDATE ***************\r<br />I have made another mod which lets you use the Keyboard as well as the xbox 360 controller simultaneously. This is as perfect as it gets for VAC users&#33;&#33; It is also good for people without VAC because this allows you to use more hotkeys than the 360 controller lets you.\r<br />\r<br />What i did is:\r<br />1. only map the button &#34;End&#34; to the left button using Xpadder\r<br />2. Go to skyrim settings menu and turn xbox 360 controller ON\r<br />3. Set the push to talk key in VAC to &#34;End&#34; and set the mode to &#34;Arm&#34;\r<br />So when you&#39;re in game, just tap the left button and say something that you set in VAC and it will execute the command in the game&#33;\r<br />\r<br />For eg. I told VAC to press &#34;p&#34; when i say &#34;Magic&#34;. So when im in game and using my 360 controller, VAC presses the button &#34;p&#34; to open up the magic menu.\r<br />PS. &#34;p&#34; is the button for quick access to the Magic menu when using keyboard (if you didnt already know.)\r<br />\r<br />Here is the mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30913\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />***************** NOTE *****************\r<br />As far as i know, you need Xpadder version 5.7 for this profile to work. I will include my controller image and the profile in the download.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />****Which file to download?****\r<br />I have uploaded a new file named &#34;TWEAKED Skyrim Xpadder Xbox 360 Controller&#34;. This configuration is for people that want just a button to press to make them either walk or run instead of pushing the left stick a certain percentage. \r<br />So in this configuration, you press the LEFT D-Pad button in order to either walk or run. This is a toggle button. \r<br />\r<br />If you want the original config, please download the main file, not the optional. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />• To install the controller image, click on the little controller icon to the top left, select \r<br />   &#34;Open&#34;, then select &#34;XBOX 360 For Windows.xpaddercontroller&#34;\r<br />\r<br />• To install the controller config, click on the other little button on the same row (icon \r<br />   looks like a piece of paper with writing), and click on open and select \r<br />   &#34;Skyrim (Xbox360 Controller).xpadderprofile&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Some cool features:\r<br />- You can walk or run depending on how much you push the joystick in any direction. \r<br />- Reduce mouse sensitivity when using Bow and Arrow for more accurate shooting.\r<br />- Ergonomic layout\r<br />(i literally just made it, so ill keep adding features if i can)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Okay so here goes...\r<br />\r<br />1. The left joystick is for movement (mapped to &#34;W,A,S,D&#34;). \r<br />    The speed at which you move depends on how much you push the stick.\r<br />    - If the stick is pushed less than 65% of the threshold (sounds  like a lot but it isnt), then you \r<br />      walk slowly\r<br />    - If the stick is pushed more than 65% of the threshold you start running (this is NOT \r<br />      sprinting&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />2. Press down the left stick to crouch, and press again to get up (mapped to &#34;L-Ctrl&#34;)\r<br />\r<br />3. The right stick is to look around (mapped to mouse). It has reasonable sensitivity so it wont \r<br />    feel odd or slow. You can change it if you like by pressing the little wrench icon next\r<br />    to the RIGHT STICK and choosing &#34;mouse settings&#34; at the bottom. Move the sliders to adjust\r<br />    sensitivity.\r<br />\r<br />4. Press the right stick to change between First and Third person (mapped to &#34;F&#34;).\r<br />\r<br />5. Press the &#34;Y button&#34; on the 360 controller to JUMP (mapped to &#34;Spacebar&#34;).\r<br />\r<br />6. Press the &#34;X button&#34; on the 360 controller to sheathe or draw weapon/spell (mapped to &#34;R&#34;).\r<br />\r<br />7. Press the &#34;A button&#34; on the 360 controller to interact with people/objects (mapped to &#34;E&#34;).\r<br />\r<br />8. Press the &#34;B button&#34; on the 360 controller to open the CHARACTER MENU (mapped to &#34;Tab&#34;)\r<br />      - When you press this button, the controller config changes to better suit controlling the \r<br />        character menu. This sends you to SET 3. The controls are as follows:\r<br />         • Left Stick: W,A,S,D\r<br />         • Right stick: Mapped to mouse\r<br />         • D-Pad: Mapped to Arrow keys (up,down,left,right)\r<br />         • Start button: Exits the character menu and brings you back to default playing controls\r<br />         • Back button: Use this button if you CANT JUMP while playing the game. This is because\r<br />                               you have to press the &#34;B button&#34; on the 360 controller for a reason other\r<br />                               than to access the character menu and you are stuck in this\r<br />                               configuration.\r<br />         • A button: Mapped to &#34;E&#34;. Use this to equip/unequip items. You can also press either\r<br />                          left or right triggers to equip them to the corresponding hand.\r<br />         • X button: Mapped to &#34;R&#34;. Use this to drop or store an item.\r<br />         • B button: Mapped to &#34;Tab&#34;, this takes you back to default playing controls. (make sure\r<br />                          you can jump, if you cant, then press the BACK BUTTON). This has the same \r<br />                          effect as pressing the START BUTTON.\r<br />         • LEFT trigger: Mapped to &#34;RIGHT mouse button&#34; \r<br />         • RIGHT trigger: Mapped to &#34;LEFT mouse button&#34; \r<br />\r<br />9. LEFT trigger: Mapped to &#34;RIGHT mouse button&#34;. Use this to block with a shield, or strike with\r<br />                      the left hand weapon, or block with a two handed weapon, or power strike \r<br />                      (punch) with a bow. \r<br />\r<br />10. RIGHT trigger: Mapped to &#34;LEFT mouse button&#34;. This sends you to SET 5 while held to \r<br />                         reduce the look sensitivity for more accurate arrow shots. Use this to fire \r<br />                         an arrow, or strike (or power strike) with a two handed weapon, or strike\r<br />                         with a right hand weapon.\r<br />\r<br />11. START button: (mapped to &#34;Esc&#34;) Brings you to the pause menu where you can change\r<br />                          settings, view quests and check achievements. \r<br />\r<br />12. BACK button: This opens up the MAP (mapped to &#34;M&#34;). This sends you to SET 2. \r<br />                        When viewing the map, here are the controls:\r<br />                            • Left stick: Use this to move around the map (mapped to &#34;W,A,S,D&#34;)\r<br />                            • Right stick: Use this to control the cursor (mapped to the &#34;Mouse&#34;)\r<br />                            • D-Pad: Use UP and DOWN to zoom IN or OUT of the map \r<br />                                        (mapped to &#34;Mouse scroll wheel&#34;)\r<br />                            • B button: Use this to return to gameplay. This closes the map \r<br />                                             (mapped to &#34;Esc&#34;)\r<br />                            • START button: Use this to return to gameplay. This closes the map \r<br />                                                   (mapped to &#34;Esc&#34;)\r<br />                            • BACK button: Use this to return to gameplay. This closes the map \r<br />                                                  (mapped to &#34;M&#34;)\r<br />                            • LEFT trigger: Mapped to &#34;RIGHT mouse button&#34; \r<br />                            • RIGHT trigger: Mapped to &#34;LEFT mouse button&#34; \r<br />\r<br />13. LEFT bumper: Hold this bumper to sprint (mapped to &#34;L-Alt&#34;)\r<br />\r<br />14. Right bumper: Use this to shout (mapped to &#34;Z&#34;)\r<br />\r<br />15. D-Pad UP: Use the UP button on the d-pad to go to the favourites menu. This sends you to \r<br />                   SET 4. This button changes the controls. These are the following controls:\r<br />                        • Left stick: Mapped to W,A,S,D\r<br />                        • Right stick: Mapped to the mouse\r<br />                        • D-Pad: Mapped to the arrow keys. Use this to move through the Favourites\r<br />                                    list.\r<br />                        • A button: Mapped to &#34;E&#34;. Use this button to Use/Equip the item\r<br />                        • B button: Mapped to &#34;Tab&#34;. Use this button to close the favourites menu\r<br />                                         and return to game.\r<br />                        • LEFT trigger: Mapped to &#34;RIGHT mouse button&#34; \r<br />                        • RIGHT trigger: Mapped to &#34;LEFT mouse button&#34;\r<br />\r<br />16. D-Pad Right: Mapped to &#34;Caps Lock&#34;. Use this button if your character is moving very slow \r<br />                       even when you have the left stick pushed all the way in any direction.\r<br />\r<br />17. D-Pad Down: Mapped to &#34;T&#34;. Use this to issue the WAIT command. Use left stick to specify  \r<br />                       the amount of time to wait, and press &#34;A button&#34; to wait.\r<br />\r<br />THE END&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*****************KNOWN PROBLEMS AND FIXES*****************\r<br />\r<br />1. If your character CANT JUMP, press the BACK BUTTON\r<br />\r<br />2. If your character starts walking very slow even though you are pushing the stick all the way, \r<br />   then press RIGHT D-PAD. I have no idea why this happens, but i found pressing \r<br />   the Caps-Lock button fixes this so i mapped the RIGHT d-pad to Caps-Lock.\r<br />\r<br />3. If you cant use Xpadder while playing Skyrim, just run Xpadder with admin rights. It should fix\r<br />   this problem.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please let me know of any other problems you encounter and ill fix it and re-upload the file, thanks :)\r<br />Ask questions if you&#39;re having any trouble.\r<br />And let me know if i&#39;ve missed something.",
