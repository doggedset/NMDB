  "descriptionHtml": "v2.0 Changelog\r<br />----------------------------\r<br />- Subtitles changed to that of Trololo&#39;s as opposed to Ragnar the Red&#39;s\r<br />- Some dialogue changed\r<br />- Mikael renamed to Mr. Khil\r<br />- Mikael&#39;s model changed\r<br />\r<br />You may have noticed this has slight pauses in the song. This is because Ragnar the Red was in 6 parts, so I split Trololo into 6.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]A9lRVEjusHE[/youtube]\r<br />(Version 1.0)\r<br />\r<br />If someone could change Mikhael&#39;s model to one that looked a bit more like the Trololo guy, I would really appreciate it. Also, if someone could do a good deep russian accented voice, I would like to change all Mikael&#39;s audio files\r<br />\r<br />If you can do one or more of the above things just comment and we will sort sommat out",
