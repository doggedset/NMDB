(right before the stairs to where the yarl place is)\r\n\r\n*Both NPCs are Essential meaning they will not die, only be knocked out for a short time if they lose all their health.\r\n\r\n*This is now the base of a new mod i will be making, i will update this mod as i go with the new one as well as they will be similar in the sence of armors and textures.\r\nVersions:\r\n.01a - companions can be hired separately, not together unless you have another mod allowing you more than one companion.
