These creatures have been entirely taken over by their beast, they can no longer become human and as such have adapted to the inhospitable northern climate developing denser white coats to help them camouflage among the fallen snow.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I noticed that since the release of Dragonborn werebears haven&#39;t got much love in the modding community so I decided to take up the challenge.\r<br />\r<br />This mod requires Dragonborn to work[/size]",
