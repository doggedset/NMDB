  "summary": "Did you find the werewolf to look weak and a little like something on a little kids show?",
  "descriptionHtml": "     Right now, the werewolf looks like an enlarged skeever, with long arms. It looks so weak that Braith can take it out. So basically you are trading your soul to Hircine for an improvement to polymorph skeever, which isn\\'t that bad if you want people to fight instead of run in terror. Bethesda created all of these stories and in then left out the goodies. This is intended to be a fix. Right now it only modifies the skeleton of the werewolf but I am hoping to expand.\r\n      You may not take this mod and post it to another site or using assets from this mod without my permission and you must site my work.\r\n\r\n The things this mod does right now to the werewolf is:\r\n      Make arms bigger (Slightly so you don\\'t have ape arms, not my intent.)\r\n      Gives it bigger ears (A wolf\\'s got to hear)\r\n      Makes the legs bigger (Something has got to explain their speed)\r\n      Bigger Pads (They jump on mouse feet, Bethesda)\r\n\r\nFuture plans:\r\n     A completely new model ( I will need some tutorials to do this if you know how)\r\n     New stats and height changes (Optional file, planing to use the Dragonborn DLC to do this)\r\n     New Sounds (They sound like motors and they don\\'t huff and puff)\r\n     New Textures (Using More Wolf-Like Werewolf Skin right now)\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n     Bethesda\r\n     Foxcraft7 for the texture http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29452\r\n    (if you see your mod in the pictures than tell me and I will add you to the credits)",
