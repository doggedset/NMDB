(2012)[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=88d3d4]This mod adds 205 Easter Eggs to the Nine Holds. See how many you can find! [/size][/center][/color]\r\n\r\n[b][size=3]The Golden Egg Treasure Hunt has finally arrived. Find it here![/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16831]Golden Egg Treasure Hunt[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=3]After Holiday Note[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nI Hope everyone had a great Holiday! I will be working on this mod until next year to add all sorts of new features.\r\n\r\nThis mod will be kept active here on Nexus and I will be working on it slowly until next year to add the new features. If you wish to participate in the beta testing and get a sneak peak at next years version be sure and check back often.\r\n\r\nI am also working on a new off-season mod called \\\"The Golden Egg Treasure Hunt\\\" which will be similar to this mod but with added features like lore telling about each egg when found. Also there will be unique potion-like effects when eggs are consumed, and it will be much more wide spread. Keep your eyes peeled for that release shortly after May 1st 2012.\r\n\r\nI hope everyone enjoyed the Easter Egg Hunt. Thanks for downloading and all of the support!\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=3]Information[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThere are twenty-five eggs in each of the major cities (Markath, Riften, Solitude, Whiterun, and Windhelm) and twenty in each of the smaller holds (Dawnstar, Falkareth, Morthal, and Winterhold). All the eggs are outdoors and within city limits. There are a total of forty-one of each of the five egg types equaling two-hundred and five eggs!\r\n\r\nThe eggs are worth 500 gold each and can be sold to vendors for profit. They can also be used as Alchemy ingredents! Each of the five egg types has different Alchemical effects.\r\n\r\nBe sure and bring along a friend too with the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11575] Eternal Bunny Pet[/url] mod!\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=3]Other Related Mods[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17776]Riftwood Bunny Breeders[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11575]Eternal Bunny Pet[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16831]Golden Egg Treasure Hunt[/url]\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=3]Misc Info[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nVirtual Easter Egg - A virtual Easter egg is an intentional hidden message, in-joke, or feature in a work such as a computer program, web page, video game, movie, book, or crossword.\r\n\r\nReal Easter Egg - Easter eggs are special eggs that are often given to celebrate Easter or springtime. The oldest tradition is to use dyed or painted chicken eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=3]Installation[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nNMM\r\nJust download and install using the Nexus Mod Manager like normal.\r\n\r\nManual Install\r\nExtract the .7zip folder and place the .esp file into your /Data folder in you Skyrim Directory. Be sure the textures and Meshes are placed in their proper locations as well Data/meshes/plants and Data/textures/plants.\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=3]Version Information[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0. Please report any inaccessible eggs or other bugs and I will fix them ASAP\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 - Fixed inaccessible eggs.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2 - Adjusted the physics on the eggs so they should not be kicked around by NPCs any longer and should remain where I placed them until picked up. This should finally resolve all the inaccessible egg issues.",
