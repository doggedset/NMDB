  "descriptionHtml": "IMPORTANT: To install this mod, simply go to your skyrim directory (usually C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/SteamApps/common/Skyrim), go to the Data folder, and drag &#34;ballbuster.esp&#34; there. This is just a dupe of the original skyrim Ebony Sword, but with extremely increased damage. This was incredibly simple to make, and with a little common sense, anyone should be able to learn how to d this. This mod is for the players who have completed the skyrim main missions, and are not planning to make the game easy. I do not recommend this mod for new players, or for players who have not completed the main missions, because with this mod&#39;s added sword, you can pretty much hit anything living in skyrim and kill it. To get this sword, you simply press ~, or whatever your console button is, and then type &#34;help ballbuster&#34;. This should bring up an item called Ballbuster, with an ID along with it. Now, to get this in your inventory, you could either type &#34;player.placeatme (the ID)&#34;, or you could type &#34;player.additem (the ID) (amount)&#34;. Both of these commands should work, and should get you to your enjoys of killing. This mod does not contain any texture replacing files, and only uses the vanilla textures. WARNING: You may need SKSE for this mod. You can download SKSE here: http://skse.silverlock.org/.",
