  "descriptionHtml": "This is.. by far.. the dumbest.. quite possibly.. coolest.. mod I have ever made.  I bring to you &#34;Nord, it&#39;s what&#39;s for DINNER&#33;&#34;. \r<br />\r<br />GAMESPOT&#33;  I&#39;m ready for my spotlight&#33; \r<br />\r<br />CHECK OUT MY OTHER MODS ON STEAM WORKSHOP&#33;\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlburgers/myworkshopfiles/?appid=72850]Owlburgers&#39;s Workshop[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[img=http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/607/9f01.png][/img]\r<br />\r<br />What this mod brings:\r<br />\r<br />Two new weapons:  Cannibal Fork and Cannibal Knife, smithable at any forge.  They are dwarven level weapons that can be smithed without needing dwarven smithing.  However, to fully temper them you&#39;ll need dwarven smithing (they are dwarven material after all).\r<br />\r<br />Two new cloth pieces:  Cannibal&#39;s Hat and Cannibal&#39;s Tunic.  They are made under dwarven like the weapons but cannot be tempered.\r<br />\r<br />One ring:  Ring of NOM NOM NOM allows you to FEAST upon your victims.  Eat up, that corpse isn&#39;t going to eat itself.\r<br />\r<br />[img=http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/607/9f01.png][/img]\r<br />\r<br />Hahaha I love this mod, even if it&#39;s possibly the dumbest one on steam.  ENJOY&#33;",
