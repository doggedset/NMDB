  "summary": "NOW WITH CASTING ANIMATIONS AND SHORT VIDEO. Sorry no videos atm but trust me it\\'s better than vanilla and best I can do at the moment with just monkeying with bethesda\\'s bsas. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is the same as my previous Magic Idle Run and Walk animations now with tweaks to casting charged one handed spells and an optional levitate animation for firestorm (the defaults are pretty goofy imho). I know there is still work to be done but until the CK is out it\\'s as best as I can motivate myself to do. \r\n\r\nI will try to get a video uploaded of this and my firestorm spell change and if anyone knows the name of the particle effect used when a dual cast aimed spell is fully charged you would be my hero. My next goal is to make charging more powerful dual cast spells result in that cool body glow either from the thunderstorm charging effect or lightning cloak effect.\r\n\r\nLastly the reason I am uploading this as a new file is because somehow the comments got borked on the last one and I would love to see people\\'s feedback since it seemed many liked it.\r\n\r\nEdit: THE COMMENTS BUG STRIKES AGAIN\r\n",
