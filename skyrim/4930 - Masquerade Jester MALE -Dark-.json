Obviously :)\r\n\r\nCredits to me for distribution please! \r\n\r\nAnd have fun with it!\r\n\r\nI\\'ve always been a fan of drawing/masquerade stuff. Haven\\'t seen one put up yet.\r\n\r\nSo if there\\'s any issues with the skin, please let me know!\r\n\r\nTHIS IS THE MALE VERSION - Search Masquerade Jester FEMALE -Dark-\r\n\r\nAlso I am an Imperial Vampire, so I have a KILLER SUNTAN...
