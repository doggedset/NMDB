  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to my Bromjunaar Sanctuary mod.\r\n\r\n--Reason For This Mod--\r\nI looked around the nexus and found other mods editing the Bromjunaar Sanctuary, but none of them seemed to really fit with me. They were either too drastic or not drastic enough. So I made my own and decided I would upload it. \r\n\r\n**No DLC or other mods required**\r\n\r\n**Features**\r\n-Many new items to suit my taste of what the sanctuary should have been\r\n-All crafting is available\r\n-Improved lighting\r\n**Note: I use Enhanced Lights and FX -- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043/?\r\n\r\n--Installation--\r\n1. Download the file\r\n2. Extract the esp into your Skyrim Data folder\r\n(Folder location default: C/Program Files (x86)/Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim/Data)\r\nOr use NMM.\r\n\r\n--If the mod doesn\\'t work, check your data files from the Skyrim Launcher or Nexus Mod Manager (NMM) and make sure that BromjunaarSanctuaryReborn.esp is checked. \r\n\r\n--Feel free to leave comments, suggestions, or requests.",
