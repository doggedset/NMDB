  "modName": "Replace Nightingale Blade with a Stealthy Katana",
  "summary": "This replaces the Nightingale Blade with the Blades Katana, which was also retextured to give a more stealth feeling.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This sword replaces the Nightingale Blade, sheath and all! I felt that the Nightingale Blade was too.... amateur for such an elite group like the Nightingale, so I went ahead to make a replacer.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This retexture also replaces the texture of the Blades Sword so they will look the same. \r\n\r\nFor just a retexture of the Blades Katana, refer to my other mod:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3712#\r\n\r\nTo get this weapon, go to your console by hitting the \\\"~\\\" key. Then type in:\r\nplayer.additem F6527 1\r\n\r\nThis mod is best used with:\r\nNightingale Prime: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1896\r\nBlades Sword Damage Increase: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2362\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like to retexture this, you are welcome, just credit me!\r\nIf anyone has any suggestions to future color textures just mention it. I am also planning to make this a standalone when the CK comes out, giving it stats that contribute to a light armored/stealth/thief/archer gameplay style.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS-----------------------------------------------------\r\nJust copy \\\"textures\\\" into the data folder in your Skyrim directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits: Inspiration for the blade part was from ababuobi.
