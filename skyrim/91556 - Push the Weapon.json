  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds the unique weapon, Push. Featuring a custom enchantment that staggers enemies 25% for 6 seconds, with the ability to stagger multiple enemies at once. It features a unique custom texture with embossed writing; based on the words push, shove,force in Japanese katakana. It's base damage is higher then the original Akaviri Katana. The damage goes up depending on your One Handed Skill and Perks.\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]hBKb4-85Rp4[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />I tried to balance the weapon as best I could, with it's damage, the stagger amount, weight and the time it takes for the enchantment to run out.\n<br />\n<br />To clean the blade, simply sheath and equip another weapon just like any other weapon in Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />With it's own story, wield this weapon of the dead hero Sir Delacroix throughout your adventures in Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />Found in a grave near Refugee's Rest, east of Windhelm and on the border of Morrowind.",
