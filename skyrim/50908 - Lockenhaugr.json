  "descriptionHtml": "Hi everyone&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This contains my first two dungeon mods, Halthrak&#39;s Hideout and Lockenhaugr.\r<br />Here is a short description of them:\r<br />\r<br />Halthrak&#39;s Hideout\r<br />------------------\r<br />- A previously abandoned small Nordic dungeon located east of Whiterun along\r<br />the river.\r<br />\r<br />- Easy difficulty, suitable for characters of all levels.\r<br />\r<br />- This was my first delve into the Creation Kit.  As such, it is an extremely\r<br />simple and short dungeon, lasting no more than about 5 minutes.\r<br />\r<br />Lockenhaugr\r<br />-----------\r<br />- This is in an ancient burial tomb, located just east of Morthal near the\r<br />mountains.\r<br />\r<br />- It is of moderate difficulty, but suited for characters of all levels.\r<br />\r<br />- Lockenhaugr provides roughly 15 minutes of play time.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please feel free to rate and comment on either dungeon.  If you encounter any bugs, please let me know.  Hope you enjoy&#33; ",
