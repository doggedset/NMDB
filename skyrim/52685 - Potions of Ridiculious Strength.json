  "descriptionHtml": "Do you like making one-shot kills on dragons? Are you tired of using the Fortify Restoration potion exploit to give your gear &#34;God Like&#34; stats? Or gathering ingredients for said potions? Well Look No Further... \r<br />\r<br />For through the magic of the Creation Kit, too much caffeine, not enough sleep, and extreme boredom, I&#39;ve added 400 of each Uber Blacksmith/Enchanting Elixirs to to a Strong Box in QASmoke\r<br />that improve weapon upgrades and the strength of enchantments by 1000% \r<br />\r<br />Now if you&#39;re not one to use such items, like looking around for ingredients, spending your hard earned Septims on substandard potions, or are just a plain glutton for punishment...
