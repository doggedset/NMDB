This means they will now drop as Random Loot!\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluded:\r\nV1.1\r\nAncient Nordic Light Armor (Skyforge Armor) Can be crafted at the Skyforge only!\r\nWolf Light Armor (Non-Craftable) Can be purchased from Eorlund Gray-Mane at the Skyforge.\r\n\r\nV1\r\nDeadric Light Armor and Shield\r\nDragonPlate Light Armor and Shield\r\nDragonScale Heavy Armor and Shield\r\nDwarven Light Armor and Shield\r\nEbony Light Armor and Shield\r\nElven Heavy Armor and Shield\r\nGlass Heavy Armor and Shield\r\nIron Light Armor and Shield\r\nOrcish Light Armor and Shield\r\nSteel Light Armor and Shield\r\nSteel Plate Light Armor and Shield\r\n\r\nNot Included (and reasosn why):\r\nHide (Hide is soft)\r\nLeather (It\\'s made of Leather, can\\'t get much heavier)\r\nStudded (There was only one thing)\r\n\r\n======================\r\n2.
