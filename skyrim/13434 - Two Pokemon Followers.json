  "modName": "Two Pokemon Followers",
  "summary": "This mod expands upon my Roselia mod by adding another pokemon, Misdreavus, and addressing several problems that limited the combat efficacy of these companions.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Install Directions: just put the .esp in your Data folder, and the Scripts in your\r\nData/scripts folder, and it should be good to go.\r\n\r\nWhat this mod does:\r\nThis is very simple. It adds two \\\"pokemon\\\" animal follower, one named Roselia\r\n(she looks like a tiny Spriggan) and the other Misdreavus (looks like a ghostly little girl) at the Drunken\r\nHunstman in Whiterun. These followesr will learn spells as the player levels up, and will maintain\r\nthe four move limit as per pokemon standards. They can also be evolved into Roserade/Mismagius,\r\nwho do not learn new moves, but use more powerful versions of the moves they learned \r\nas Roselia/Misdreavus.\r\n\r\nHOW THINGS WORK:\r\n1) Getting Roselia/Misdreavus: Very simple, walk up to them in the Huntsman and say Roselia/Misdreavus, I choose you!\r\n2) Getting new moves: When the player hits a level that Roselia/Misdreavus would learn a move at\r\n you\r\ncan walk up to Roselia/Misdreavus and say \\\"Hey Roselia/Misdreavus, what\\'s up?\\\" and they will begin her dialogue\r\nfor learning a new spell. At this point you will have four slots to choose from\r\n(the first slot is automatically filled by Absorb at the beginning) to fill with the \r\nnew move/spell.\r\n3) Evolving Roselia/Misdreavus - pay 1000 gold to Prof. Hist and Roselia/Misdreavus will automatically\r\nevolve into Roserade/Mismagius. The Shiny Stone is for Roselia and the Dusk Stone for Misdreavus.\r\n\r\nCRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOTES:  The dialogues for learning new moves do NOT tell you\r\nwhat move is being learned, or what moves are alread in what slot. I suggest\r\nwriting down what moves are in each slot, as otherwise you may forget the wrong \r\nmove by accident. Also it may be a good idea to keep a copy of the table below on hand. This I believe will not be possible to fix due to the nature of the Kit until the script extender.\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure you know what levels you will get a new move on, and do not surpass this level before trying to gain a move. Attempting to gain a new move while you are not at the correct level will cause the Pokemon to forget the spell in that slot, but not gain another spell. I am working on this.\r\n\r\nRoselia MOVE LIST:\r\nLevel   Spell           Effect\r\nStart\tAbsorb\t\tAbsorbs 4 HP/sec\r\n4\tGrowth\t\tFortifies Magicka Regen by a factor of 4 for 20 seconds\r\n7\tPoison Sting\t13 points of damage/sec for 3 seconds\r\n10\tStun Spore\tBasically its Unrelenting Force. I can\\'t get her to cast this though. Hopefully I can fix this soon.\r\n13\tMega Drain\tAbsorbs 8 HP/sec\r\n16\tLeech Seed\t5 points of damage/sec for 100 seconds.\r\n19\tMagical Leaf\t60 pts of damage\r\n22\tGrassWhistle\t1 second paralysis (this is better than it sounds, as the one second does not include the time it takes for the enemy to fall down and stand back up again)\r\n25\tGiga Drain\tAbsorbs 16 hp/sec\r\n28\tToxic Spikes\t16 Damage/sec for 20 seconds\r\n31\tSweet Scent\t3 second paralysis\r\n34\tIngrain\t\tHeals 24 HP/sec for 10 seconds\r\n37\tToxic\t\t60 poison damage/sec for 3 seconds\r\n40\tPetal Dance\t24 damage/second constant cast spell\r\n43\tAromatherapy\tRestores 110 pts of health in an area\t\r\n46\tSynthesis\tRestores Roselia to full health (basically)\r\n\r\nMISDREAVUS Move List\r\nStart\tGrowl - Drains 66 Points of Stamina on Target\t\r\nStart\tPsywave\t- Does 1-3X Player\\'s Level (randomly) 80% of the time (at Level 50 Mismagius can do up to 225 damage for 75 mana)\r\n5\tSpite\t- Drains 50 Points of Magicka\r\n10\tAstonish - Deals 30 Damage and has a chance\r\n14\tConfuse Ray - Causes a brief Frenzy\t\r\n19\tMean Look - Roots the enemy to the ground (by diminishing his carry capacity by 300)\t\r\n23\tHex - Deals 50 Damage\r\n28\tPsybeam\t - Deals 65 Damage and has a 10% chance of frenzying\r\n32\tPain Split - If the enemy has twice or more the amount of HP as Misdreavus, they both have their health\\'s changed to the average\r\n37\tPayback\t - Deals 100 Damage\r\n41\tShadow Ball - Deals 80 Damage and has a 20% chance of eliminating magic resistance\r\n46\tPerish Song - Kills all Enemies around\r\n50\tPower Gem - Deals 70 Damage for a low mana cost\r\n\r\n\r\nAll spells are 1.5 times as powerful when Roselia/Misdreavus evolves into Roserade/Mismagius.\r\n\r\nInformation about Roselia/Misdreavus:\r\n\r\nRoselia is a Grass/Poison type pokemon. More information can be found about them here:\r\nhttp://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/\r\nI used Roselia for a number of reasons, but mostly it was because there was already \r\na Skyrim base creature (a Spriggan) that bore a physical resemblance to the pokemon.\r\n\r\nMisdreavus is a ghost type pokemon. More info here: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Misdreavus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey does not evolve as a function of them level, but when given a Shiny Stone.\r\nThis can be purchased from Prof. Hist in the Drunken Huntsman. (NOTE: This isn\\'t an\r\nactual buyable object, it simply causes a script to run that \\'evolves\\' Roselia/Misdreavus\r\ninto Roserade/Mismagius)\r\n\r\nAny help or suggestions for the mod are appreciated, just drop me a message on Skyrim nexus.\r\n\r\nCHANGES SINCE ROSELIA:\r\nPokemon now actually gain stats (skill levels, perks, and values like Health/Magicka) as you level up.\r\nPokemon moves have a cooldown period, forcing them to use different spells rather than spam one.\r\nObviously, Misdreavus is now here.",
