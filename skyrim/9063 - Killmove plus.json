  "descriptionHtml": "KillMove + takes killmoves to the next level, new animations and better camera with in game tweak able settings!\r\n\r\nTweaked KillMove requirements.\r\nRemoved last enemy requirement, now you can get KillMoves with multiple opponents around!\r\n\r\nNew animations introduced with KillMove +.\r\n»3 new for one handed sword, in vanilla there was 6 + decap, now there is 9 + decap.\r\n»1 new for one handed axe, in vanilla there was 2 + decap, now there is 3 + decap.\r\n»1 new for one handed mace, in vanilla there was 2 + decap, now there is 3 + decap.\r\n»1 new for dualwield, requires axe or sword in right hand, in vanilla there was 1 (required dualwielding swords/daggers) + decap, now there is 2 + decap.\r\n»1 new for battleaxe and warhammer, in vanilla there was 1 + decap, now there is 2 + decap.\r\n\r\nCurrent stuff taken out, was deemed to buggy with the new feature, will be fixed in time.\r\n»The good old ordinary backstab, it has some problems working with the new Killmovechance.\r\n\r\nCamera tweak able options.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDefinable first person camera.\r\n»Option 1: you won\\'t be forced out of 1st person to watch the KillMoves, and if you play in 3rd person, you will not get forced into 1st person, the only exception is KillMoves on Dragons and the stomp with onehanded sword/dagger, they will always happen in 3rd person (standard).\r\n»Option 2: vanilla cam, the ordinary old trusty first person cam that bethesda launched the game with.\r\n»Option 3: No first person kill cam at all!\r\n»Use the console command \\\"set Forcekillcam to x\\\" replace the \\\"x\\\" with the number of the option you like, so either 1, 2 or 3, read over the Q.A if you don\\'t know how to activate the console.\r\n»If you set the \\\"Forcekillcam\\\" to any other value beside the mentioned ones, you will simply have no first person killmoves.\r\n»If you are unsure what the current value of \\\"Forcekillcam\\\" is then you can open the console and type \\\"help Forcekillcam\\\".\r\n\r\nDefinable if you want to have a new third person Killcam.\r\n»Option 1:Normal killcam like in vanilla (standard)\r\n»Option 2:New third person Killcam.\r\n»Use the console command \\\"set Killmovecam to x\\\" replace the \\\"x\\\" with the number of the option you like, so either 1 or 2, read over the Q.A if you don\\'t know how to activate the console.\r\n»This is currently a better optimised camera for the animations (you won\\'t get out of view) but there only is 1 so far.\r\n»You can check the value of the \\\"Killmovecam\\\" by writing \\\"help Killmovecam\\\" into the console.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nKillmove tweak able options.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDefinable if you don\\'t want the player to be killmoved.\r\n»Option 1: The player can be killmoved (standard).\r\n»Option 2: The player cannot be killmoved.\r\n»Use the console command \\\"set Killmoveonlyplayer to x\\\" replace the \\\"x\\\" with the number of the option you like, so either 1 or 2, read over the Q.A if you don\\'t know how to activate the console.\r\n»If you set it to something else beside then the mentioned 2 options, you will only have a very buggy game, be warned!\r\n»You can check the value of the \\\"Killmoveonlyplayer\\\" by writing \\\"help Killmoveonlyplayer\\\" into the console.\r\n\r\nDefinable what the chance is to get a killmove.\r\n»The command goes from 1 to 100, the lower the value the less chance to get a killmove, the higher the value the better chance to get a killmove, this per click of the mouse, so 1 click = \\\"x\\\" to get a killmove.\r\n»The standard value of Killmovechance is 20.\r\n»You still have to hit hard enough to kill the enemy for the Killmove to trigger.\r\n»Even with the value 100, it is not sure to get a killmove, blame bethesda :P\r\n»Use the console command \\\"set Killmovechance to x\\\" replace the \\\"x\\\" with the number of the value you want, so minimum a value of 1 and a max value of 100, read over the Q.A if you don\\'t know how to activate the console.\r\n»You can check the value of the \\\"Killmovechance\\\" by writing \\\"help Killmovechance\\\" into the console.\r\n»This cannot be disabled by the time being.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFuture plans.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThese are the things i\\'m thinking about adding, nothing is sure, whether i find time for it or if i can do it.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n»Killcam for projectils?\r\n»Menu for deciding the chances for the KillMoves for triggering?\r\n»Better killcams?\r\n»Configurable ini file instead of having punch in the values for every restart of the game.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.A\\'s\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nQ:I can\\'t decapitate the guards, gore is just flying out of their helmets!\r\nA:There seems to be some trouble with the standard guard helmet and decapitation.\r\n\r\nQ:But i will die with multiple enemys around me if get a KillMove!\r\nA:The enemy can\\'t hit you during the animation, the only time they can hit you are when the animation is over and you are just standing there, that is currently something i\\'m trying to solve, the problem is the killcam, not the animation.\r\n\r\nQ:I just got one hit from full health by a bandit, i\\'m wearing full daedric and i have over 200 health, your mod sucks!\r\nA:The KillMove trigger doesn\\'t count in the armor rating, so if they can hit you hard enough, you can potentially die from the weakest opponent.\r\n\r\nQ:My character just walked outside the camerviewangle and brutally murded the enemy, i\\'m sad i couldn\\'t watch it :(.\r\nA:The KillCam doesn\\'t follow your character when the animation is played, i haven\\'t been able to fix it yet, however i\\'m trying.\r\n\r\nQ:The animation just stopped in mid action, what is up with that?\r\nA:There is a reason they have been left out of the game by Bethesda, however if the animation keeps bugging out, drop a comment and maybe i will end up removing it if it causes too much trouble gameplay wise (remember to describe the animation).\r\n\r\nQ:I don\\'t like the new animations, can i get the old mod that just removes the requirement?\r\nA:Yes you can download it at the Nexus, if you look at the download tab and then look at the bottom of the site, there you can find the old files \\\"Killmove plus v2\\\" and \\\"Killmove plus v1 Only player\\\".\r\n\r\nQ:I don\\'t see any new animations, you lied!\r\nA:The new KillMove animation i have added only works on the playable races (Bosmer, Dunmer, Imperial etc.).\r\n\r\nQ:This looks exactly the same as the mod by OVMProductions, you thief!\r\nA:Yes they look the same, because we use the same animations that bethesda cut from the game, my mod also offers more control over the killmoves, he just adds the cut animations, but be sure, nothing was stole from either of us, it was in the game in the first place.\r\n\r\nQ:Can you make xyz animation, it would be really cool you could!\r\nA:I would love to, but sadly i cannot, the animations i have added so far already were in the game, however they were locked so you couldn\\'t do them.\r\n\r\nQ:I have set Killmovechance to 100, why don\\'t i get them all the time?\r\nA:There is a lot more requirements that also has to be fullfilled before you can trigger it.\r\n\r\nQ:What happen to the old Killmoverandom?\r\nA:It is not used anymore and i\\'m using Killmovechance now, explanation is long, just know it was the better.\r\n\r\nQ:How do i activate the console?\r\nA:The console can be accessed in-game by toggling the \\'tilde key\\' (the actual key can be ~, º, ¬, |,^, \\\\, §, ², etc.. depending on your keyboard layout), found near the \\\"1\\\" key on most keyboards, if you need more help on the console then beside what is written there, go to - http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Console.\r\n\r\nQ:Nice videos!\r\nA:I haven\\'t made the videos, they all made by fans, you can find the name of them at the video page.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSelfish link to my other mods.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8324]Sweeping Weapons[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Update.[/b][/size][list]\r\n[*][b]NEW - 17/2/2012[/b] Merged Killmove + player cannot be killmoved and the Killmove + with tweak able Killmoveonlyplayer, Killmovechance and new camera option.\r\n[*][b]OLD - 16/2/2012[/b] Fixed bug on the player KillMove plus v5 - player cannot be killmoved, and added tweak able first person camera, to the Killmove +.\r\n[*][b]OLD - 15/2/2012[/b] Added 4 new animations and upgraded the killcam.\r\n[*][b]OLD - 14/2/2012 [/b]New version of KillMove plus and KillMove plus - player cannot be killmoved, this one adds 3 new animations, i had planned to add all the extra animations that was just laying there, but a sudden computer crash stopped that -.- so you get this for now.\r\n[*][b]OLD - date ?[/b] Had some problems with triggering the KillMoves, remade the file so there shouldn\\'t be any problems now, Thanks goes to darbasc and johnchi, for finding the bugs.\r\n[*][b]OLD - date ? [/b]New file! This one should make it so only the player can do the KillMoves, but beside that, it does the same as the other KillMove plus - this is in beta currently, needs more testing, i haven\\'t been able to get KillMoved myself with it yet, and i\\'ve been trying hard!\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nThanks goes to xPr0metheus and Arsenalrobert for the videos.",
