Absolutely not&#33;. What makes this one different?. Well, I know they are mods to make children followers, to make them wear armor, to make them fight, to make them killable, to be able to pickpocket, to loot them...But they are not compatible with each other, because they edit the same stuff. This mod unifies all those features.\r<br />\r<br />I FORCED CHILD BODY MESHES TO PREVENT NUDITY. This can make custom body armors to have a seam on children, if you have installed armor replacers.\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=9][color=RED]DESCRIPTION[/color][/size][/center]\r<br />[list][*]Fully voiced children follower dialogues, with their original voices.[*]You can make any child your follower, even some adults. Only orphans will give you the follow me dialog, to be more lore-friendly. The others are activated with a provided spell.[*]They can now fight, no matter if they are followers or not[*]Every single child is pickpocketable, killable and lootable.(killable only on fighting version)[*]They can wear armor and weapons.[*]They will level with you.[*]Lore-friendly. They will still behave like children. [*]They will not report your crimes.[*]Plugins for popular NPC mods.[*]Modular easy installer.[*]Children can be killed only by the player.[*]Plugins for Inconsequential NPCs and Interesting NPCs added(not needed to be compatible, currently outdated).[*]Plugin for Requiem the Roleplaying Overhaul and similar mods.[/list]\r<br />[u][b][color=red]TWO FLAVOURS&#33;&#33;:[/color][/b][/u]\r<br />[list][*][color=Yellow][u]Fighting version:[/u][/color]Full, all features enabled.In certain situations, they might flee because they are children...Babette will never flee. Sometimes they wont do what you have told them(with follower mods like AFT depends on that mod)They wont run to the other end of the map to aid someone.[*][color=Yellow][u]Non fighting version:[/u][/color]they will flee and hide when combat starts. Not killable children and non fighting followers. The rest of the features are enabled.[/list]\r<br />[u][b][color=red]MODULES (available on both fighting and non-fighting VERSIONS):[/color][/b][/u]\r<br />You can select wich options you want at install time(modular installation):\r<br />[list][*][color=Yellow]Resources file(core)- Spell to make anyone your follower.

So if those mode are updated, you can still use this plugin, if they dont remove a NPC who is a child.[*]As a rule of thumb, if you choose an option in the installer you cant change it later on in a save  who has already seen my mod. Well, you can, but weird stuff can happen. Read the installation notes in the installer and choose wisely.[/list][u]LOAD ORDER:[/u]\r<br />Place the esps after requiem. The Requiem plugin, if used, goes the last one.[color=#ff0000][u]\r<br />[/u][/color][u][color=#ff0000]UPGRADING\r<br />[/color][/u]See changes before updating, maybe you dont need  or want to update. \r<br />As a rule of thumb, if you choose an option in the installer you cant change it later on in a save  who has already seen my mod. Well, you can, but weird stuff can happen. Read the installation notes in the installer and choose wisely.IF UPGRADING FROM 2.2.1 to 2.2.2\r<br />The only change is a patch for REQUIEM ROLEPLAYING OVERHAUL, so you dont need to update if you do not use it.\r<br />[color=RED][u]IF UPGRADING FROM 2.2 to 2.2.1[/u][/color]\r<br />Delete manually ONLY the inconsequential plugin and make a new save. Then install new version of my mod. Load previous save and play.\r<br />[color=RED][u]IF UPGRADING FROM 2.0 - Clean save of required mods:[/u][/color]\r<br />The installer will prompt you to install a new additional plugin to provide standalone voices, at the second install step. You now have two options.\r<br />1)Keep MFVM - More Follower Voices Mod Plus Khajiit Marriage by Mysticentity. In this case you dont select my voices plugin.\r<br />2)Install standalone voices plugin of my mod, either vanilla of multiple followers mods version. In this case you NEED TO uninstall MFVM and make a CLEAN SAVE of MFVM mod. There is no need to clean save my mod, just update it.\r<br />[color=RED][u]IF UPGRADING FROM 1.6 - Clean save needed:[/u][/color]\r<br />Dismiss all followers.\r<br />Save(save 1) and quit the game.\r<br />Uninstall the mod and MFVM - More Follower Voices Mod Plus Khajiit Marriage by Mysticentity (only if you want my standalone version of child voices)\r<br />Load save 1, wait 1 minute and save again (save 2). Then quit the game.\r<br />Install new version of my mod. \r<br />Load save 2.\r<br />Save again(save 3).\r<br />Done.\r<br />Im sorry for this inconvenience, but i changed a lot of things and a clean save from previous versions is required.\r<br />[color=RED][u]USAGE:[/u][/color]\r<br />[list]Just talk to them and they will follow you.[*]Go to Honorhall Orphanage and take the spell tome from the table(look at the pictures for location).

Also, there is a plugin available to add their children to this mod´s features, but it is not needed.[*]It should be compatible with any other mod, except for those that edit child races or their dialogues. Obviously if it messes with the SAME children, its not compatible, at first sight.[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=9][color=RED]BUGS, working on a fix[/color][/size][/center]\r<br />[*]if a kid should have the dialog and it does not, cast the spell. \r<br />[list][*]Aventus Aretino clone does not offer follow me dialog.
