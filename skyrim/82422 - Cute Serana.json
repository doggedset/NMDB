  "descriptionHtml": "Hi everyone&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This is my first skyrim mod and while most of the work that went into it was spent on debugging the creation kit I am still rather happy to share the result, even if it may only interest very few people since I mainly created this mod for myself and it is based on my personal taste.\r<br />\r<br />Since I liked the general appearance of Serana the mod doesn&#39;t turn her into a completely different looking character but merely performs a few adjustments to her face to make her look a little bit younger and cuter. This also means that the mod does not require any other mods apart from the Dawnguard DLC naturally. However depending on whether or which facial texture replacers you&#39;ll be using the final result will look different from what you can see in the screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />Anyway, hope you&#39;ll enjoy it&#33;\r<br />~Eomolch",
