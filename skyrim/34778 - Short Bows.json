  "summary": "I got tired of not having short bows in the game so I made this mod to add them",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds 9 new \\\"Short Bows\\\" to the game. They are slightly smaller than the normal long bow and have custom textures. Their range and weight have been reduced their damage is custom and might be slightly higher than the normal bow of that material but again they have reduced range. All are craftable and have been added to the leveled lists. This is my first weapon mod please go easy on me but also let me know if there are any issue. Thank you and I hope you enjoy. I will be adding images soon\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n\r\n0.2 Fixed mesh issues where all bows appeared as normal long bows",
