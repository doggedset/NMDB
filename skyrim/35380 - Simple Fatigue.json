  "descriptionHtml": "As the name says, this mod creates a simple fatigue effect based on your actions.\r\nSince I started using Gopher\\'s excelent [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29476]Pumping Iron[/url] mod I wanted something that forced me to sleep from time to time.\r\nThere are a few fatigue mods out there that handles injuries or modifies stats, but I wanted something simple that only handled the fatigue so I made this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=#bb9900]FEATURES:[/color][/b]\r\nThis mod will monitor your activities, if you are just standing idle your fatigue will increase very slowly but if you are sprinting you\\'ll get fatigated faster.\r\nYour fatigue will increase more or less depending if you are:\r\n- Standing\r\n- Running\r\n- Sprinting\r\n- Sneaking\r\n- Encumbered\r\n- In combat\r\n- With your weapons drawn\r\n- It\\'s night time (20pm - 6am)\r\n\r\nFatigation comes in 5 stages:\r\n- Not tired\r\n- A bit tired\r\n- Tired\r\n- Very tired\r\n- Exhausted\r\n\r\nEvery stage gives you a penalty to the Stamina regeneration.\r\n\r\n[b]Why it only affects the stamina regeneration?[/b]\r\nFirst of all, because as the title says: It is a simple mod.\r\nAnd second because the mod calculates how much time it requires for you to get fatigated based on your stamina and the [b]Base hours to total fatigue[/b] setting, so it made sense that it affected the stamina only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=#bb9900]SETTINGS:[/color][/b]\r\nEvery configurable setting is pretty self explanatory and comes with an explanation of what it does in the MCM menu, the only one that may require a deeper explanation is [b]Base hours to total fatigue[/b]:\r\nThis value represents the base hours upon which the fatigue calculations will be made, depending on what Timescale you play you may think that you are getting fatigated too quickly or too slowly, this value will help you control how much faster/slower you get fatigated. One way to say it is that it allows you to adjust the \\\"difficulty\\\" of the mod.\r\nFor those that are curious I play with a Timescale of 8 and have this setting set to 24. You\\'ll have to adjust it to suit your tastes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=#bb9900]CONFIGURATION:[/color][/b]\r\nIt is [b]strongly recommended[/b] that you have [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3863]SKYUI[/url] 3.0 or later so you can configure every aspect of the mod with an MCM menu.\r\n[b]The mod by default starts disabled, you need to activate it to start getting fatigated[/b]. If you don\\'t have SKYUI you can activate the mod by typing in console:\r\n[i]set FatigueActive to 1[/i]\r\n[i]zSimpleFatigueQuest.Start()[/i]\r\nIf you want to know if the mod is active you can type in console [i]set FatigueDebug to 1[/i], you\\'ll see notifications from time to time with your current fatigue, set it to 0 again to stop those notifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=#bb9900]UNINSTALATION:[/color][/b]\r\nTo uninstall the mod go to the MCM menu and deactivate it, this will reset your fatigue level to 0 and will remove any fatigue effects from your character. You can activate/deactivate the mod at your will.\r\nIf you don\\'t have SKYUI then... go get it, seriously. Or type in console:\r\n[i]set FatigueActive to 0[/i]\r\n[i]zSimpleFatigueQuest.Stop()[/i]\r\nAlthought this will not remove any of the fatigue effects that you may have until you deactivate the .esp, that\\'s why it\\'s recommended to have Skyui.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=#bb9900]CHANGE LOG:[/color][/b]\r\n[b]v1.1[/b]\r\n- Fixed bug with fatigue not increasing when using Wait function\r\n- Added variations for werewolves:\r\n[list][*] If you can become a werewolf, night time doesn\\'t affect your fatigue\r\n[*] While you are in werewolf form all the values increase at half the speed\r\n[*] After turning back to human form you\\'ll receive a fatigue hit[/list]\r\n- Added variations for vampires:\r\n[list][*] If you are a vampire, night time doesn\\'t affect your fatigue but day time does if you are not in an interior\r\n[*] While you are in Vampire lord form all the values increase at half the speed\r\n[*] After turning back to human form you\\'ll receive a fatigue hit[/list]\r\n- Adjusted fatigue recovery while sleeping: you need around 10 hours with 150 stamina and around 16 hours with 350 stamina\r\n\r\n[b]1.0[/b]\r\n- Initial release",
