  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;m not revealing the location of this armor, as it would ruin the whole purpose. But I will tell you that to start, go to your house and look for your bed. It should have the same note on it regardless of what house you have, as long as it isn&#39;t hearthfire and it&#39;s in skyrim. Find your way to all the pieces of the armor by solving the puzzles and what it&#39;s asking. The armor is a simple untextured glass armor for now. I am looking for someone to make a unique texture or mesh for me, considering I have no experience with that. It would be much appreciated. It&#39;s called jesterbane because it has the same enchantments as Cicero&#39;s Armor.",
