It is very easy to find. I think It is automatically on your map. :) (Could someome confirm?)\r<br />It has no blacksmith forge or anything, as space is limited and i aimed for a Fishing sort of theme.\r<br />Although inside it has an Alchemy Lab and Enchanting Table, double bed, fireplace and soup cooking..\r<br />\r<br />I also like the touch of the deck, thought it was quite cute to get some level in Falkreath :)\r<br />\r<br />Bugs: None yet&#33; Please tell me if you spot or have any recommendations&#33; Thank you&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />DoodleBugRain\r<br />\r<br />",
