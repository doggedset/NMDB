  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][font=Courier New][color=#00ff00][size=6]~Verden Se~[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />[color=#00ff00](The World&#39;s Watch)[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Immediate Note: This shares the same location as my previous Black Stallion Lodge; the two are not compatible. \r<br />\r<br />I did love that earlier lodge of mine, but I wanted to expand on it a little more, and it eventually became something almost completely different. Lore-wise, it belonged to a supporter of the Blades, wealthy yet hiding from the eyes of those who started persecuting anyone affiliated with them after the Great War. Eventually, the Thalmor caught him, executed him, and set him against the elements as a warning to those who would support the Blades and Talos-worship. \r<br />\r<br />This new home is locked, but can be picked to be used as a home; [color=#00ff00]Its key[/color], and a note, are at the base of the former tenant down the road a bit. It comes with many unique static features, as well as a new Ancient Akiviri Katana based on Lord Harkon&#39;s sword model. The house comes with the usual crafting amenities, sans blacksmithing tools or garden (Perhaps later). It is small, but not terribly so; a great starter home on your way to Whiterun and your quest to save Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />Thank you MrAbubu for this video&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[youtube]ycZi4-Tbqr4[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]Admirable Features:[/color]\r<br />- Cleaned with Tes5Edit\r<br />- Unique Akaviri Katana\r<br />- Dawnguard static resources + unique lighting\r<br />- Hearthfire adoption-friendly and amenities\r<br />- Four guest beds for followers or family\r<br />- 2 bedrooms, a landing, and a dining area\r<br />- Heavy amount of storage space\r<br />- Beautiful location next to a waterfall\r<br />- Close to Riverwood for their blacksmith\r<br />- [color=#00ff00]Thanks to Darkrider[/color] for their static wall painting resources&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]Installation and Troubleshooting:[/color]\r<br />- Three files; one esp and a Mesh and Texture folder to go into your Skyrim &gt; Data folder.\r<br />- It is located just north of [color=#00ff00]Riverwood[/color], across the bridge.\r<br />- The door to the cabin is locked only with an Adept setting in case you can&#39;t find the key;\r<br />- The key is in a knapsack at the base of the skeleton further up the trail, along with the sword. \r<br />[color=#ff0000]\r<br />Incompatabilities:[/color]\r<br />- Any mod that places objects in the Riverwood Bridge cell. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />My thanks to everyone who tries this one out&#33;[/center]",
