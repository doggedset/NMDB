  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes the strange bowl like models used in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33253/?]Herbal Tea[/url] by GustavL to proper teacups. There are also teapots and flagons as options. \r<br />\r<br />If you want you can check out my own tea mod which is mainly designed around role-playing and is less bonus oriented - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63889/]Canis Root Tea[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][size=5]\r<br />Requirements:[/size]\r<br />Skyrim\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33253/]Herbal Tea[/url] by GustavL - This mod will do nothing without this&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=3][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/size]\r<br />It obviously overrides the textures from Herbal Tea. It should be compatible with everything.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][size=4]Credits\r<br />[size=3]Herbal Tea is made by GustavL. No part of the mod is redistributed.\r<br />Thank you to Stroti and Tamira for the teapot model and textures.[/size][/size][/size]",
