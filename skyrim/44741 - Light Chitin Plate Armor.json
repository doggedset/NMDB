  "descriptionHtml": "I made a new set of cuirass and gauntlets that look exactly like heavy chitin armor. I made this for myself, so its going to have a higher rating than most light armor. But mostly, its because in my search for perfect armor, I wanted to match the light and heavy chitin armor to take advantage of light armor perks. Hope you guys enjoy and tell me if there\\'s a problem.\r\n\r\n",
