  "descriptionHtml": "Tired of feeling like you\\'re getting your ass handed to you while playing as a werewolf at mid to high levels?  Well this mod may be just what your looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is this mod?\r\n\r\nThis mod\\'s aims were to be a highly compatible and conflict free Werewolf enhancement for Dawnguard that is both fun and well balanced.   I kept the scope small intentionally and it is currently feature complete with no new features planned, only bugfixing should any be found.\r\n\r\nRequirements: Latest version of Skyrim, and Dawnguard\r\n\r\nFeatures:  \r\n\r\n-New updated perk tree, with improved versions of Dawnguard perks as well as new additions. \r\n     -Full Moon Rising: While the moon is high your beast form is more powerful\r\n     -Thick Hide: Improves your defensive rating\r\n     -Beast Blood: embracing your beast blood gives you increased abilities in both forms\r\n     -Brutality: highest perk that gives you enhanced speed for a short time after you feed on      \r\n      your enemies allowing you to brutally savage through a host of foes.\r\n\r\n-Improved Stamina , Attack and defensive rating at all levels but still very balanced.  (Werewolves should kickass, but not be unstoppable)\r\n\r\n-Improved Health Regeneration\r\n\r\n-Werewolf Vision for all times of the day while in werewolf form.  See the world through the eyes of the wolf.\r\n\r\n-You can now change into a werewolf any time you want, but it doesn\\'t have a return to human form.  \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nRecommended installation is to just use NMM.    You can also manually install it but seriously why would you want to.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibilty:\r\nThe mod has been tested extensively and is very stable with a large mod list (as I have).  It adds 1 script and changes perks spells and abilities for werewolves and adds it\\'s own version of abilities where possible.  It will not be compatible with any other werewolf enhancing mods that also change the werewolf spells, effects, or abilities, but other than that it should be compatible with anything. \r\n\r\n\r\nIts been cleaned with TES5Edit and was created with the latest version of the Editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any issues, and please endorse if you like the mod. Thanks for trying it out, I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.\r\n\r\n",
