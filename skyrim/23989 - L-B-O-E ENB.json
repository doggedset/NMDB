  "descriptionHtml": "Hi, thanks for checking out my ENB config! This is my first ENB and first upload to the Nexus, so feel free to give suggestions on ways to improve the mod page or the ENB itself.\r\n\r\nDays are bright and interiors and nights are dark and moody, so make sure to keep some torches handy!\r\n\r\nLBOE stands for Little-Bit-Of-Everything, and I\\'ve called my ENB that because I didn\\'t have any particular feel in mind when making it, and because some aspects would make it a vibrant \\'fantasy enb\\' while others give it an almost cgi and realistic feel\r\n\r\nThis ENB is based off of the ObbliviENBloom config by JohnChi and is designed to be used with Project Reality - Climates Of Tamriel, but can be used without it. \r\n \r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\n1. This mod runs off of ENB Series v0.119 so you must first download the binary files at http://enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0119.htm and extract every file from the \\'WrapperVersion\\' folder to your root Skyrim install folder (where TESV.exe is located). \r\n\r\n2. Download my ENB and extract all files to that same root Skyrim folder. Overwrite files when asked.\r\n\r\n3. Open your SkyrimPrefs.ini file located in your \\\"My Documents\\\" folder and make sure these lines are set\r\n\r\nbFloatPointRenderTarget=1\r\nbDrawLandShadows=1\r\nbTreesReceiveShadows=1\r\n\r\n4. Download and install Climates of Tamriel and choose default options.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I have my brightness set at 6 notches from the right as this achieves the best balance of colour vibrancy and lighting ON MY SCREEN. Your screen may be configured differently so be sure to mess around with the brightness until you find what works for you. \r\n\r\nChange log:\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0\r\nRelease\r\nVersion 1.0.1\r\nReduced fire saturation\r\nAdded performance version for those who were struggling to run the ENB\r\nVersion 1.1\r\nUpdated both versions to better suit the latest version of Climates of Tamriel\r\nVersion 1.2\r\nMinor tweaks to both versions.  \r\nMajor improvement the appearance of fog at night for both versions.  \r\nLight bokeh depth of field now enabled by default and letterbox effect removed.  \r\n\r\n",
