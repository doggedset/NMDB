  "summary": "This mod removes the models of the craftable Jewelry, so they are invisible and won&#39;t cause any clipping issues with your armor, etc.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Did it ever bother you, that all those necklaces and rings have clipping issues with your armor?\r<br />Well, it bothered me.\r<br />\r<br />Because of this and the fact, that i was unable to find any mod which replaces the models of the existing jewelry, I decided to create my own little &#34;mod&#34;, which removes the models of the craftable Jewelry.\r<br />\r<br />Now they are invisible and won&#39;t cause any clipping issues. YAY&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]INSTALLATION:[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Install with NMM or drag and drop the .esp-file to your Skyrim data folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]REQUIREMENTS:[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />None.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]KNOW ISSUES/INCOMPATIBILITIES:[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />The player is able to wear multiple amulets and rings at once. Looking for the cause of the problem at the moment.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />P.S.: I&#39;m sorry for any possible grammar mistakes.",
