  "descriptionHtml": "Ornhamir is a medium-size Nordic ruin located some ways north of Riverwood along the river. Just follow the road north of Riverwood until you reach the waterfall, jump over the river and you should see some stairs leading to the entrance.\r\n\r\nSome of the notable dungeon features:\r\n* Plenty of hidden items, just look around!\r\n* Several secret rooms with more substantial rewards.\r\n* A new, custom boss NPC.\r\n* You aren\\'t the only intruder here, as the Draugr will be busy fighting off some other invaders.\r\n* The dungeon should be beatable at almost any level, however watch out for some unleveled enemies.\r\n\r\nThis is my first dungeon mod, which took a bit more than a week of work. I\\'d appreciate any feedback on difficulty, level design, item/reward balance, etc. I\\'ll make balance tweaks if neccessary, but probably no changes to layout as I\\'d rather save the effort for another project.",
