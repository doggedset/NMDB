  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />\r<br />This is a simple bug fix for users who used &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24258/?]Quest for Umbra[/url]&#34; by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2375235/?]Debdut[/url] .  It solves a problem where the College of Winterhold&#39;s doors to the \r<br />Arcanaeum will not activate even for NPCs.  I decided to release this because I dealt with this problem far longer than I thought I&#39;d have to.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />* Skyrim V. 1.9.32.0.\r<br />* Any mod that does not alter the College of Winterhold.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />* Use NMM.\r<br />* Manually decompress the &#39;Data&#39; file folder to .... (installation path)&#92;Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />Notes:\r<br />\r<br />This mod simply deletes all the old entrances for the Arcanaeum and replaces them with new ones.  The alternative to my solution was to script edit content from the &#34;Quest for Umbra&#34; mod, and after I made an attempt it did not solve the issue either because I made an error or because the mod was so outdated and had some kind of conflict. It&#39;s important to do the following for this to work right.\r<br />\r<br />1. Install mod.\r<br />2. Load Skyrim.\r<br />3. Go to the College of Winterhold, and open a door to the Arcanaeum.\r<br />4. Save your game.\r<br />5. Uninstall this mod. (You can delete the files).\r<br />6. Reload Skyrim and exit the Arcanaeum.\r<br />7. Celebrate with gusto.\r<br />\r<br />It should also be noted that this fix may interfere with a portion of Skyrim&#39;s Main Quest.  So if you&#39;re in the middle of it while dealing with this issue, then I suggest using the entrance to the Arcanaeum from the Hall of Elements.  Also, this can be used to fix entrances to the Arcanaeum even if &#34;Quest for Umbra&#34; is not the culprit, I would follow the above procedure even so.\r<br />\r<br />&lt;&lt;&lt;Credits&gt;&gt;&gt;:\r<br />Bethesda  -  For making Skyrim\r<br />The Nexus - For allowing me to host my indulgences.",
