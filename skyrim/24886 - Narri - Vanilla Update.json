  "summary": "Minor update to Narri to fix her inability to serve at Dead Man\\'s Drink in Flakreath, among other improvements.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Narri is apparantly broken in Vanilla - she didn\\'t serve in the Inn as was intended so I fixed that. While I was at it I made her marriable as she might consider this a viable way out of the town and improved her looks a bit. She was kind of hard looking, so softened up the face a bit and gave her longer hair. Nothing huge or glamerous, just making her a more viable NPC and fixing some broken bits.\r\n\r\nAs she doesn\\'t own anything besides her vending and a bed to sleep in at the Inn. On marrying her it would be advisable to have her move in with you (unless you want her to keep serving at the Dead Man\\'s Drink).",
