  "descriptionHtml": "UPD: added savegame from very beginning so you can use this character from level one.\r\nUPD2: She\\'s even looks better with \\\"No more blocky faces\\\", \\\"better lips\\\" and \\\"better eyes\\\" mods.\r\n\r\nThis is my first upload so don\\'t judge mo to hard =)\r\nSo to be honest i think i\\'ve managed to create one of the cutes characters( without mods ofc) in Skyrim and i want to share it with you guys. Her name is Lara and she\\'s a bounty hunter of 23 lvl. \r\nHer main skills:\r\nDualwield\r\nLight Armor\r\nSneaking\r\n\r\nSo basically she is some kind of contract killer who\\'s interested in wealth and don\\'t care too much about other people.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve tryed to avoid a lot of quests in the game and spent the most of the time just running around and doing random quests(To be honets this is how TES games meant to be played IMHO ). I\\'ve done about 3-5 quests in the main storyline, about 7+ quests for The Dark Brotherhood and about 4 quests for the theif guild. I\\'ve never bought any houses, got married, used any companions. \r\n\r\nBonus: I hide all my stuff in Delphia\\'s secret place in Riverwood",
