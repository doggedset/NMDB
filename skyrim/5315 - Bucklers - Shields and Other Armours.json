It\\'s time for another mod by yours truly. If you have ever been playing Skyrim and found a new shield or armour peice and thought \\\"That would look so cool to wear but I can\\'t because it\\'s Heavy Armour and all my points are in Light Armour\\\" or \\\"Man, my assassin gets his ass kicked a lot. I really wish I had a small shield to use instead of this other dagger.\\\", then this is the mod for you.\r\n\r\n[youtube]aNW4q0QfVTM[/youtube]\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Conflicts/Bugs:\r\n-None at this time.\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s new in 2.2?\r\n-A little bit of bug fixing.\r\n-Fixed Targe of the Blooded to have Bleeding Damage (15 points for 3 seconds)\r\n-Fixed Light Targe of the Blooded to have Bleeding Damage (10 points for 3 seconds)\r\n-Fixed Heavy Buckler of the Blooded to have Bleeding Damage (10 points for 3 seconds)\r\n-Fixed Buckler of the Blooded to have Bleeding Damage (5 points for 3 seconds)\r\n\r\nNote: I HIGHLY recommend manually uninstalling any and all previous versions of this mod and manually deleting all associated files before installing 2.2. You don\\'t have to. It shouldn\\'t affect your game any but just to help keep your install folder as clean as possible you should manually delete files that were installed by older versions.\r\n\r\nPlans for future release as of 02/11/2012:\r\n-Add variant shields to leveled lists and vendor lists. - 0% Complete\r\n\r\nNOTE: If anyone knows how to add items to the leveled lists please contact me. I have no idea how to do it and for the life of me I can\\'t figure it out on my own. Thank you in advance.\r\n\r\nWhat this mod does:\r\nIt adds forgeable and upgradeable Buckler\\'s, Light Shields, Light Armours and Heavy Armours.\r\n\r\nRemember: If you use it, Endorse it! Don\\'t be a leeching D-bag like all those bums always asking for a few coins. Feedback is always nice but that doesn\\'t mean you can be a dick about it! Constructive criticism is different from being a trolling dick.\r\n\r\nWhat is added:\r\n-Bucklers-\r\nBuckler\\'s are a type of small, lightweight shield used primarily in combat to provide manueverable protection for the body from the hand and forearm. They are extremely lightweight and manueverable. That being said all bucklers weigh about half of what the normal shield does in-game and also require only half the material to forge them so to balance them out and not make them overpowered I cut the armour rating in half as well as their value. Most of these use the vanilla mesh which has been reduced about 40% in size. Some have been turned to one side to keep true to the lore that they are designed to protect the hands and forearm. If you don\\'t like how they look, don\\'t forge them. Forge the Light Shields instead.\r\nAvailable Bucklers:\r\n-Blades\r\n-Daedric\r\n-Dragonplate\r\n-Dragonscale\r\n-Dwarven\r\n-Ebony\r\n-Elven\r\n-Glass\r\n-Hide\r\n-Imperial\r\n-Iron\r\n-Banded Iron\r\n-Orcish\r\n-Steel\r\n-Buckler of Solitude\r\n-Buckler of Ysgramor\r\n-Buckler of The Blooded\r\n-Spellbreaker Buckler\r\n-Buckler of Winterhold\r\n-Buckler of Sithis\r\n\r\n-Heavy Bucklers-\r\nSame thing as Bucklers but they have Armour Rating, Weight and Value equal to the Light Shields.\r\nAvailable Heavy Bucklers:\r\n-Blades\r\n-Daedric\r\n-Dwarven\r\n-Ebony\r\n-Iron\r\n-Banded Iron\r\n-Orcish\r\n-Steel\r\n-Heavy Buckler of Solitude\r\n-Heavy Buckler of The Blooded\r\n-Heavy Buckler of Ysgramor\r\n-Spellbreaker Heavy Buckler\r\n-Heavy Buckler of Winterhold\r\n-Heavy Buckler of Sithis\r\n\r\n-Light Shields-\r\nPretty much the exact same thing as vanilla Heavy Armour shields except converted to light armour. They only require 75% of the original materials to forge and they weight less but because they are light armour they offer less protection than a heavy steel shield and you can\\'t sell them for as much.\r\nAvailable Light Shields:\r\n-Blades\r\n-Daedric\r\n-Dwarven\r\n-Ebony\r\n-Iron\r\n-Banded Iron\r\n-Orcish\r\n-Steel\r\n-Light Shield of Solitude\r\n-Light Shield of Ysgramor\r\n-Light Shield of The Blooded\r\n-Light Spellbreaker\r\n-Light Shield of Winterhold\r\n-Light Shield of Sithis\r\n\r\n\r\n-Shields-\r\nPretty self-explanatory, I added some new shields. The Heavy Armour kind. Gods only know why anyone would use these big, bulky things but, whatever, they\\'re here if you want them.\r\n-Shield of Winterhold\r\n-Shield of Sithis\r\n-Heavy Hide Shield\r\n-Heavy Elven Shield\r\n-Heavy Glass Shield\r\n\r\nForgeable Heavy Armours:\r\nBasically, these are Light Armour versions of the existing vanilla Heavy Armours. Stats have been altered to match the changes.\r\n-Hide\r\n-Leather\r\n-Elven\r\n-Glass\r\n-Blades\r\n\r\nForgeable Light Armours:\r\nThese are Light Armour versions of existing vanilla Heavy Armours.Stats have been altered to match the changes.\r\n-Iron\r\n-Steel\r\n-Dwarven\r\n-Ebony\r\n-Daedric\r\n-Blades\r\n\r\nI have fully tested this mod and can say with 100% confidence that you CAN forge and upgrade all of these shields and armours. The unenchanted shields you will be able to enchant. The enchanted ones you will NOT be able to break them down and learn the enchantment. The only other thing you can\\'t do is buy them from vendors that you haven\\'t sold them to or find them as loot. BUT the CK is coming out at the end of the month (supposedly) so hopefully this\\'ll be fixed long before Valentine\\'s Day. You\\'ll be able to get your true love something epic! A kick-ass, life-saving shield.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n-Manual-\r\n1. Download\r\n2. Unzip to Skyrim/Data\r\n3. Overwrite\r\n4. Profit\r\n\r\n-Nexus Mod Manager-\r\n1. Download\r\n2. Activate\r\n3. Overwrite\r\n4. Profit\r\n\r\nInspiration:\r\nThis started out as a simple \\\"Hey, let\\'s do something stupid but, maybe, kind of cool at the same time\\\" type of mod but you guys loved it so I just kept expanding it.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBethesda - For Skyrim, despite my initial thoughts otherwise, it\\'s actually one of the best games I\\'ve played.\r\nYouTube - For showing me videos of real bucklers and giving me the idea to start this mod.\r\nmalufenix - Without your music, I probably would\\'ve broken my computer multiple times.\r\nand last but definitely not least, me - Because, well, I\\'m the s**t.\r\n\r\nWow, you\\'re still reading this? Well, you get a special reward. You get to go to my profile page and check out my other mods.\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=2253779",
