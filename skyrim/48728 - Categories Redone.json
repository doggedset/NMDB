  "descriptionHtml": "Compatibility Notes:\r<br />----------------------------\r<br />It should work with everything.\r<br />\r<br />General Notes:\r<br />-------------------\r<br />There are three items in immersive armours that cant be sorted atm and they are Redguard cape, Seadog cape and Seadog eyepatch so they will appear under Misc. \r<br />\r<br />This is due to skyproc not having the biped slots i need so when skyproc is updated i will sort that out.\r<br />\r<br />If you are using mods that have SPIKE.esm then add a rule to boss to sort Categories Redone.esm after it so that my mod sorts everything into the right category and you dont end up with weird things happening.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to everyone that endorses my mod.\r<br />\r<br />Install:\r<br />---------\r<br />Pretty much straight forward, drop the esm into your Skyrim Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />For the Compatibility patch drop the folder into your data folder, then go into the folder and run CRCompatibilityPatch.jar to make the patch.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall:\r<br />-------------\r<br />Like the install, just remove the esm.\r<br />\r<br />Bugs:\r<br />-------\r<br />None that i know of.\r<br />\r<br />Change Log:\r<br />-----------------\r<br />v1.3\r<br />------\r<br />Four new categories (Hats,Clothing,Gloves and Shoes) and an updated patch for better sorting.\r<br />\r<br />Patch v1.2\r<br />---------------\r<br />With the new patch, Immersive Armors works properly with my mod so no more out of place categories lol. Clothing will appear under Misc until i finish sorting those. Enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />v1.2\r<br />-----\r<br />Forgot to redo some of the labels so they were showing up as all caps, this fixes that.\r<br />\r<br />v1.1\r<br />-----\r<br />Add two new categories &#34;Arrows & Bolts&#34; and &#34;Staff&#34; (Suggestion by ADragonCalledGeorge)\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />----------\r<br />Thanks to DienesToo and MongoMonk from the official skyproc thread for helping with the skyproc patcher code.",
