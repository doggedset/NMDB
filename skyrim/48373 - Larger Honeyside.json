  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will enhance Honeyside, the ugly and little house from Riften.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATION: This is version 1.0 from my mod, and there will be many bug fixes and additions for the house. Meanwhile, the Enchanting Room is empty, so you will have to buy the child's bedroom to furnish that area. The enchanting table is in the alchemy area.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: This mod will improve the house, adding a Living Room (the vannila house didn't had a living room), a Kitchen, a Dinner Room (different from the vanilla house, there will be a Kitchen area and a Dinner area), an Alchemy and Enchanting Room, a Bedroom, a Blacksmith area and a Bathing Area.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOWN BUGS: Sometimes, items will spawn in the middle of the house. To fix that, just take the items and drop (or store) them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at modding, hope you all like :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
