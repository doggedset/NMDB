  "descriptionHtml": "[center][/center]    I plan on still updating and Progressing through My preset with you guys. So you can have a somewhat first hand look at how I change and evolve my preset. Don&#39;t forget to vote if you like the preset.Thanks guys. This page has reached just over 1,600 downloads and has a beautiful 69 endorsements. I never thought so many people would have been interested in my preset. Thank you all for your support.\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][size=6]\r<br />[/size][/font]    I use to have a sister nicknamed Suki and I made this preset out of inspiration of her. I lost my sister two years ago . As I was making this ENB I was thinking of her. It&#39;s vibrant, natural/&#34;realistic&#34;, and full of life like how she use to be. So I took great care with making natural colors for skies for certain times of the day that look really natural and wonderful. The sun colors are very fitting as well. I did my very best to make the ENB work with the weathers that Vivid Weathers offer. Rainy days will look wet and cool. Snow is difficult to work with as I do not know how to code. But I did my best to compensate with the GUI with balancing out snow weathers. Interiors are amazing as well, that&#39;s why I recommend using ELFX. I used NLVA enb depth of field and fire settings. I added some files from from Dahaka enb as well. Like the bloom effect and dirt lens files I have here for you guys to enjoy. To get a good feel for what this ENB offers just summon a flame atronach or cast a thunder bolt spell. See how Kbloom effects (from rudy&#39;s enb) make the lighting seem more realistic giving lighting and fire attacks that RAW POWER feeling . Note that the chain lighting spell has REEEAAALLLYYYYY strong bloom effects for some reason. Good things it&#39;s instant lol. I made this with a lot of effort and love. I hope you guys like it. Enjoy. \r<br />\r<br />[b][i]I&#39;m aware the &#34;suki&#34; in some languages mean Bit&#036;@es lol[/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />(Who ever is reading this and you have some questions about SSE port or want to use what I already have set up read the sticky notes)\r<br />\r<br />                  [size=6] Weather, Lighting, ENB Series & Recommended Mods[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />                              (Install weather and lighting in the order I have here. Will probably be updated occasionally)\r<br />Download latest enb files [url=http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.html]here[/url]..Only put Host.exe and d3d9.dll file into your skyrim directory folder. Then install my enblocal.ini, enbseries.ini, and enbseries folder into your skyrim directory as well.\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />[/size][size=5]You guys will need to Install [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73937/?]Vivid Weathers[/url]. Deactivate Esp. [/size][size=6]Use vivid weathers 1.39[/size][size=5]. New file 1.51 has an odd sunglare that is not the way I want you guys to see the sun with my preset. I just downloaded the new update and had no idea that&#39;s what the sun ended up looking like. Sorry guys.[/size]\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />\r<br />[/size]Next install a lighting mod (If you want screenshots like mine then Install everything ELFX comes with EXCEPT for weathers esp). I made this preset while I was using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27043/?]ELFX[/url] (Highly recommended) but I am sure other lighting mods should work along side with this preset. Not sure if it will make things too bright or too dark. Just start testing and see how it is. Be sure to use any patches from other texture mods that requires an ELFX patch. If your game is crashing it is more than likely because ELFX is conflicting with something.\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />[/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60603/?]Unofficial ELFX & SMIM fps patch[/url]. Does not pertain to above ELFX description. There are other mods that require different patches if anything. Not much, but a few.\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />[/size]Then install [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75346/?]Natural Lighting Vivid Atmospherics[/url] esp and make sure it is below the lighting and weather mod in your load order.\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />[/size]Install [url=http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1499]Mindflux&#39;s Partical Patch[/url].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> USE [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80696/?]Customizable Lights[/url]&#33; You Will need it to brighten and get more range from torches and the candle light spell. I don&#39;t wanna read any complaints about its too dark and you don&#39;t even have this mod installed. Trust me it helps.\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />[/size] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48938/?]Watercolor for ENB and Realistic Water Two[/url] is now compatible with update. It&#39;s almost essential to use it with my enb\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />[/size]You guys might like my preset with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24810/?]Morning Fogs[/url]. It makes the atmosphere look much more scenic. Give it a try.\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />[/size]I would recommend using the mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58424/?]Remove smoke[/url]. I used it during the making of my preset. And it will also save a few frames. Worth using.\r<br />\r<br />Do NOT use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65959/?]Little Things[/url] with this ENB preset. Thanks to CyborgArmGirl..and us breaking our heads over why her skyrim was looking so yellow. She finally figured out that the &#39;Atmosphere&#39; retexture turns my preset into a yellow toned mess. But the other texture mods like WEBS and DUST are perfectly fine. Just not ATMOSPHERE (as stated in that mods description to be weary of what ENB you are using because it may change the color and look)\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59721/?]DYNDOLOD[/url]. If using DYNDOLOD, when installing it make sure to set the landscape brightness to -8 or -10 so it doesn&#39;t look too bright on your LOD. IF you don&#39;t know how to install it check out Gamer Poets youtube tutorial on how to install DYNDOLOD [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_5MWqeHIzw&t=2111s]here[/url]. I know it&#39;s a long video but if you go part by part with it you will install DYNDOLOD correctly&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27563/?]Wet and Cold[/url] is also a great mod to have if you don&#39;t already. It fits really well with the way my rain and snow weathers look. Really makes you feel like its wet and freezing. I would not recommend using the frost effect though. It looks great in the day but as it gets darker it just looks like your covered in glitter lol.\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />[/size]I use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80648/?]Skyrim Textures Redone - Enhanced Night Sky[/url] The no nebula version works wonderfully with minty&#39;s shooting stars mod. \r<br />\r<br />Minty&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15506/?]Lightning During Thunder Storms[/url](it is compatible with Vivid weathers so far as I can tell. I have yet to run into anything weird or funky) and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25022/?]Shooting Stars[/url] Is a great compliment to my enb settings of the night sky.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62425/?]Embers HD[/url] is a great compliment to my Preset. There is a choice with more orange embers which I think is a nice touch.\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />[/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4910/?]Dramatic Clouds[/url] work very nicely with my preset. \r<br />[color=#6aa84f][size=6]\r<br />[/size][/color]                                                                                                               \r<br />[color=#6aa84f][size=6]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][color=#6aa84f][size=6][center]SKGE ENB Installation[/center][/size][/color]                                                                                        [b][u][color=#6aa84f]SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS[/color][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- SKSE plugin\r<br />- Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library Redistributable Package 2015 x86\r<br />- Latest version of DirectX 9.0c (June 2010) - use a redistributable version (not the web installer).\r<br />- Latest Skyrim version 1.9.32.0.8\r<br />[font=Arial]\r<br />\r<br />[/font][b][u]RECOMMENDED SKYRIMPREFS.INI SETTINGS[/u][/b]\r<br />fShadowDistance=7000.0000  (I have tested for 5000 and it works fine.

Mind you have a heavily modded game with dense grasses and thousands of trees in skyrim.)\r<br />But my system will be different to many of yours.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I did make a lite version as well. Saves maybe 4-6 frames and looks almost as good as the full version. (check the images)\r<br />Pretty much if you can run Rudy or NLVA enb then you can run this with no issue.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size]Changing dirtlens effect. There is a seperate folder in the archive named &#39;LensMaskChoices&#39; and inside are a few sub-folders with lens effects I have ready for you guys. Follow these steps and have fun.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />1. So you are going to want to Choose a Lens Mask you like from the options I provided. (or any lens mask you may have already. This process is very easy)\r<br />\r<br />2. Move said lens mask into The Enbseries Folder that is in your Skyrim directory folder (NOT data folder)\r<br />\r<br />3. And finally overwrite the lens mask with the one you want. That should be it&#33; enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size]My Specs.\r<br />[size=2]\r<br />[/size]GPU: msi GTX 1070\r<br />CPU: AMD 8350 black edition\r<br />RAM: 8gb stick of ram\r<br />Motherboard: an ASUS I can&#39;t remember for the life of me.
