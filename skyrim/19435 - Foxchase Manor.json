  "descriptionHtml": "Foxchase Manor is an attempt at a \\'realistic\\' player home. \r\nLatest version fixes grey face and adds extra houses to village.\r\nIt is situated near Whiterun by Redorans retreat\r\nLooking through all the player homes on Nexus none of them seem \\'home-like\\' enough for me. Either they are huge castles or little cottages or the \\'Lore\\' has been mutilated.\r\nSo, no huge \\'Trophy Room stuffed with rows and rows of display cases and weapon racks mannequins etc. This is a home rather than a museum, somewhere that has been there for years and years slowly maturing.\r\nOne Mod I did like was \\'Lances\\' Expanded Whitewatch\\' I liked the idea of a location re-used for a different purpose many years after the builders had abandoned it.\r\n\r\nA Curtain Wall, Tower and lookouts, Gates,  Main Hall, Kitchen, Staff quarters and a realistic number of bedrooms. In the Cellars a Crafting area with Smithing, Enchanting and Alchemical facilities. There is a small display room a Brewery and a relaxing \\'club\\' for the guards and staff. In the grounds a Guardhouse with it\\'s own access to the cellars. Staff consists of a Cook, Housekeeper and several guards plus a Dog.\r\nAll containers in the Manor and basement are player owned and non respawning so they are safe storage.\r\n\r\nIn the village is a Blacksmith, Store and an Inn plus several Farmhouses with the appropriate NPCs.\r\n\r\nMap marker shows as a Town.\r\n\r\nV1.4 Reworked Navmesh and restored two deleted Meshes. Cleaned Mod withTESVedit.\r\nIncluded a BSA File to fix the Grey Face Bug.\r\n\r\nV1.31 I deleted a main ceiling panel in the main hall when I made the last update. IF you are playing it look up and you will see a big square of the \\'Void\\'\r\nThis patch replaces the missing panel.\r\n\r\nV1.3 Bugfix and interior changes\r\nRecleaned the Mod and reworked some more Navmesh and some misplaced items etc.\r\nIf thare are still any problems with CTF while using other mods then I am afraid I am at the limit of my skill to fix them.\r\nIf anyone else wants to have a look and work on it please do.\r\nReworked some of the Weapon Racks to stop them displaying long weapons and staffs  upside down.\r\nMade the whole of the ground floor out of stone rather than wood in the side rooms and passageway to kitchen. Re-designed access to first floor to allow for a bigger Housekeeper bedroom. All containers are still there a couple have been moved a bit.\r\n\r\nV1.2 Bugfix\r\n\r\nWeapon Racks and Wall Plaques work as they should, they no longer keep your weapons.\r\n\r\nV1.1 Bugfix\r\nUninstall V1 before activating V1.1\r\nFixes mistake in Marker Name\r\nFixes some Navmash errors at the road junction and in front of the Main Gates.\r\nFixes gaps under the rock facess outside the walls to the West.\r\nFixes Mammoths sometimes trying to walk through the houses.\r\nFixes Navmesh problem with connection to some world cells\r\nGrounds some floating trees and plants\r\n\r\nStill problems with some of the Weapon racks, They are all the same item duplicated but some of them work and some don\\'t, they take your weapon but won\\'t give it back while the slot next to them is ok. Wall plaques are the same, some work and some don\\'t. Mannequins and cabinets are OK.\r\nIf anyone has any idea why please let me know!\r\n\r\nBefore you update to the new version remove anything you have placed in containers in the Manor, they will be lost.\r\n\r\nCheck out my other Mods\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36061/?]Complete Solitude [/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37874/?]Ultimate Whiterun [/url]",
