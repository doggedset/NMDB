  "summary": "This simple mod allows you to pick a vampire &#34;race&#34; from character generation. Only works for vanilla races.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Basically, this makes the Vampire versions of races into choosable races during character creation. By ticking the &#34;Playable&#34; flag on the xRaceVampire &#34;races&#34;, and recreating all of the presets for each race, I&#39;ve made it so that you should be able to pick a vampirism-enabled race of your choosing and play as a vampire from the start.\r<br />\r<br />This took a lot longer than it should have. :P I&#39;ve also removed the red vampirism marks from vampires&#39; faces. I&#39;ll upload a version that&#39;s closer to vanilla if there&#39;s any demand.\r<br />\r<br />Let me know if you find any problems or if the mod simply doesn&#39;t work.\r<br />\r<br />Requires Dawnguard&#33;",
