He raised the walls and clad the falling terrain down to the sea level with &#34;chunks of walls&#34;.\r<br />I took care of the city area and hired a lot of workers, carpenters and smiths to join in and start a rebuild of Winterhold.\r<br />All new NPCs have daily routines like visiting the inn, eating outside of their workinggrounds, standing guard,  hammering on the walls and &#39;patroling&#39;\r<br />Some new guards are placed on the city walls.\r<br />This is also based on the Tropical Skyrim idea by Soolie.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda Softworks for creating wonderous games.\r<br />Thanks to my friends on the nexusmods.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22018/]Tamira&#39;s awesome plants[/url] contribute largely to the good tropical look&#33;  \r<br />NB&#33; You&#39;ll need [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33017/?]Tropical Skyrim by Soolie[/url] to get the tropical environment&#33; \r<br />\r<br />-This mod works [u]without[/u] Tropical Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda Softworks for creating wonderous games.\r<br />Thanks to my friends on the nexusmods.[/size][/color]",
