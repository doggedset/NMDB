You only need to do this when you want to change the values of the property.

Just drag the package (which is a normal ZIP file) into Wrye Bash&#39;s Installers tab. However, the package is only a normal ZIP file, so if you know the game&#39;s mod file structure, install it manually.[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[*]Change your settings within the game in Sky UI&#39;s MCM or check the settings in &#34;DataIni&#34;. If you change any of it, execute your changes by typing in the console {bat &#34;inikuerteeGoldAdjustment.ini&#34;} without the brackets.[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[*]Activate the mod.[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[/list] \r<br />\r<br />[center][size=7][color=#ff9900]Uninstall[/color][/size][/center] \r<br />\r<br />[list=1] \r<br />\r<br />[*]In the console, type &#34;SetPQV kuGAQ uninstallNow True.&#34; Or with Sky UI&#39;s MCM, set the uninstallNow toggle to True then exit the menus.[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[*]Wait for a message confirming the uninstallation. Save the game.[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[*]Deactivate the mod with Wrye Bash. If you installed this manually, simply delete all the files you installed.

Or with Sky UI&#39;s MCM, set the resetNow toggle to True then exit the menus.[/*] \r<br />[*]When it resets it will ask you either reset all of its data or continue with the current data. Resetting all its data will remove all your configurations and set the mod as if you have first installed it.[/*] \r<br />[*]You can check all the mod&#39;s data by typing {SQV kuGAQ} in the console. You can check if your configurations were set in the mod properly with this.[/*] \r<br />[*]If you find that your changes (with the command SetPQV or from executing the INI) does not appear in the mod, check the command again for spelling errors. Then try again.[/*] \r<br />[*]If you find that resetting (with resetNow) and uninstalling (with uninstallNow) don&#39;t seem to work, the mod may have been suspended. It is best to simply start-over (i.e. reinstall the mod) after a &#34;clean&#34; save.[/*] \r<br />[*]Creating a clean save: \r<br />[list=1] \r<br />\r<br />[*]If you can, uninstall the mod from the console with {SetPQV kuGAQ uninstallNow True}.[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[*]Wait for the mod to confirm the uninstallation. It may take a minute. If no confirmation appears, then simply continue to the next step.[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[*]Save the game manually from the console by typing {save uninstalledMod}.[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[*]Uninstall all the mod&#39;s files (*.ESP, *.PSC, *.PEX) from the game folders. Make sure that none of the mod&#39;s Scripts are left. A mod manager like Wrye is best used for this.[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[*]Load the &#34;uninstalledMod&#34; save.[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[*]Save the game manually again from the console by typing {save cleanSave}. Because all of the mod&#39;s files were removed, all of its data will be &#34;zeroed&#34; in this game.[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[*]Play from this game.[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[/list][/list] \r<br />\r<br />[/*] \r<br />\r<br />[*]As a last resort, you can also enable script logging and investigate it and/or send it to me.

This is sometimes not enough time - causing the MCM to report that the mod was not found. In this version, the MCM allows the mod to return its &#34;ping&#34; in 5 minutes. That&#39;s an excessive amount of time for this function. However, the mod not being able to ping the MCM back within that time suggests that the mod has truly stalled. It may need to be restarted from a clean-save.[/*]\r<br />[size=5][color=#ff9900]0.7, 10 July 2013:[/color][/size][*]Tweak: Enabled the adjustment of potions via userNewPotionsFactor.[/*]\r<br />[*]Tweak: Reprogrammed the finding of containers, coin purses and actors.[/*]\r<br />[*]Tweak: You can now change user settings before the main quest is at stage 5 (e.g. before leaving Helgen).[/*]\r<br />[*]Tweak: The main package and the MCM can now be merged manually (with TES5Edit). Removing the reliance on GetFormFromFile () from the MCM discovery code made this possible. In this new version, SendModEvent () is used by the main package and the MCM to &#34;ping&#34; each other.[/*]\r<br />[size=5][color=#ff9900]0.628, 30 April 2013:[/color][/size][*]Tweak: Recompiled the main mod with Skyrim&#39;s 1.9 patch and the MCM component with SkyUI&#39;s 3.4 patch.[/*]\r<br />[*]Bug fix: The previous version would silently fail at random times without any errors.[/*]\r<br />[*]Compatibility: Woodpiles and Barrels and More Oh My: Containers with &#34;wood pile&#34; in its name are ignored by my mod.[/*]\r<br />[*]Compatibility: Gold from the Dark Brotherhood recurring quest contacts, who pay you in advance, are now adjusted.[/*]\r<br />[size=5][color=#ff9900]0.623, 12 February 2013:[/color][/size][*]Bug fix: Mannequins and Bookshelves were presenting their &#34;invalid item&#34; pop-up messages.[/*]\r<br />[size=5][color=#ff9900]0.622, 12 January 2012:[/color][/size] [*]New feature: Gems are adjusted. Amethysts, emeralds, garnets, rubies and sapphiers are adjusted to 50%. Diamonds are not adjusted. Change these adjustments by setting userNewGemAmethystFactor, userNewGemDiamondFactor, userNewGemEmeraldFactor, userNewGemGarnetFactor, userNewGemRubyFactor and userNewGemSapphireFactor.[/*] \r<br />[*]New feature: Soulgems and Lockpick are adjusted. Petty, lesser and common soulgems are adjusted to 25%. Greater, to 50%. Grand to 75%. Black soulgems are not adjusted. Lockpicks are adjusted to 50%. Change these by setting userNewSoulGemsPettyFactor, userNewSoulGemsLesserFactor, userNewSoulGemsCommonFactor, userNewSoulGemsGreaterFactor, userNewSoulGemsGrandFactor, userNewSoulGemsBlackFactor, userNewLockpicksFactor.[/*] \r<br />[*]Tweak: Containers you put gold into (including those that are used by NPCs to store your items - e.g. Delphine before you infiltrate the Thalmor embassy) or NPCs you give gold to will not be gold adjusted.[/*] \r<br />[*]Tweak: Reworked the OnItemAdded () and OnItemRemoved () events to minimise spam from the game when a very many number of items are added or removed by the game. E.g. When Delphine takes all your inventory before you infiltrate the Thalmor Embassy.[/*] \r<br />[*]Tweak: Better handling of While...EndWhile loops when the game first loads or when the mod is uninstalling.[/*] \r<br />[*]Tweak: Removed the internal code for OnMenuMode since it is not required.[/*] \r<br />[size=5][color=#ff9900]0.613, 18 August 2012[/color][/size] [*]Tweak: Sometimes the gold you loot from containers or the ground near the time a quest is completed is taken as Quest gold. This version ensures that only non-looted gold are counted as Quest gold.[/*] \r<br />[*]Bug-fix: Gold was being adjusted when you are sent to jail. This version disables the adjustment of gold while in jail. It is restarted once you are out.[/*] \r<br />[size=5][color=#ff9900]0.61, 1 June 2012:[/color][/size] [*]Bug-fix: This will not affect followers or horses that you own anymore. This allows you to give them gold.[/*] \r<br />[size=5][color=#ff9900]0.6, 18 May 2012:[/color][/size] [*]Bug-fix: The invisible token now has no equipment slot. Previously, some NPCs would try to equip the token causing their heads to disappear. Thanks for the heads up, hulebjoern&#33;[/*] \r<br />[*]Tweak: This mod doesn&#39;t bug-out the prologue mission anymore. However, it doesn&#39;t actually start in-game until after you escape from Helgen.[/*] \r<br />[size=5][color=#ff9900]0.51, 15 April 2012:[/color][/size] [*]Bug-fix: Chests in player-owned cells of factions that the player is a member are safe from this adjustment. Compatibility: Actor Flight Or Fly: Gold from live actors that have yielded are adjusted.[/*] \r<br />[/list] \r<br />\r<br />[center][size=7][color=#ff9900]Credits[/color][/size][/center] \r<br />\r<br />kuertee in http://www.bethsoft.com/bgsforums/ \r<br />\r<br />[center][size=7][color=#ff9900]Tools Used[/color][/size][/center] \r<br />\r<br />Creation kit - http://www.creationkit.com \r<br />\r<br />[center][size=7][color=#ff9900]Licensing/Legal[/color][/size][/center] \r<br />\r<br />You can do whatever you want with this mod but all I ask in return is that you give me credit.
