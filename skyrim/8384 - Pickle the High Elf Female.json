  "descriptionHtml": "Hello everyone this is my first upload to Skyrim Nexus\r\n\r\nI was going to put it on the Steam Workshop, but I didn\\'t see a section for Saves, so I\\'ll put it here.\r\n\r\nThe save is located just outside of the starting cave, having gone with Hadvar, the Imperial.\r\n\r\nThe only skill I used was Lockpick whilst in the starting area to get the starting mage robe, and I only used it once.\r\n\r\nI did not use any fighting or magic skills what so ever. I just stood there and let Hadvar kill everything as to not advance the character at all. I didn\\'t even sneak!\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think of her in the comments and certainly endorse if you like her!\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit the name, as obviously not everyone is going to like the name Pickle!\r\nuse \\\"showracemenu\\\" whilst in-game to rename her.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n1. Use 7zip or Winrar to extract the .ess save file\r\n2. Place the save file into the ../Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Saves folder\r\n3. Alternatively, if you use Skyrim Save Game Manager - create a new folder called Pickle (or whatever you want to name this character) in the ../Documents/My Games/Skyrim/TESVSGM/ folder and place the .ess file in that folder! Open the save game manager and click File->Scan for new profiles and it should show up there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only mod I have installed right now that would affect how the character looks is:\r\n\r\nOfficial Bethesda Skyrim High-Rez Texture Pack",
