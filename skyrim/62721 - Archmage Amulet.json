  "summary": "A unique amulet with the same enchantment as the Archmage&#39;s Robes. It cannot be worn at the same time as the robes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "An amulet with the enchantment from the Archmage&#39;s Robes (Skein of Magnus)\r<br />\r<br />I was unhappy with the existing mods that attempted to do this, primarily because I felt that the Archmage deserved a unique amulet. Some of the alternatives also allowed multiple copies of the enchantment to be active at the same time, making the combinations overpowered. This mod addresses both issues, with a unique amulet mesh and a script to prevent simultaneous wearing of the robes and the amulet.\r<br />\r<br />The amulet (and the unhooded version of the robes) will be found on a table in the Archmage&#39;s Quarters after you become Archmage. If a player has already completed the quest-line before installing this mod, they can just drop the robes and pick them back up to achieve the same result.",
