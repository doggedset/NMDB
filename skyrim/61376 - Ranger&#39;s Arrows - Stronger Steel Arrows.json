  "descriptionHtml": "Phew-- I don&#39;t know anything about mods or making mods but I am learning. Slowly. This mod is just a new arrow with the steel arrow look. I rp as a ranger and I&#39;m always disappointed with having to use obnoxious and flashy bows just to be able to take down a deer in one hit. I found a mod that makes the hunting bow stronger, which was great but I couldn&#39;t find any steel arrow type mods that have a quiver to match the hunting bow.\r<br />\r<br />So I did a little googling and the Ranger&#39;s Arrow was born. I&#39;m working on making them craftable, but I keep breaking things when I try right now. (Practice makes perfect right?)\r<br />\r<br />The Rager Arrows deliver[b] 24 damage[/b], versus the 10 that the original steel arrow delivers. This is the only change made to the arrows.\r<br />\r<br />100 Arrows can be found in Solitude by the blacksmith on one of the boxes. (See Images.) They can also be added by console for now. As soon as I know how to make them craftable I will update this mod. \r<br />\r<br />To install, run the mod manager or extract the mod to your data folder. \r<br />[b]\r<br />I STRONGLY recommend this mod: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53299/?]Improved Hunting Bow[/url][/b]",
