To marry him just simply get a Amulet of Mara from the Priest in Riften (If you have one already and there is no option to marry him go to Riften and talk to the priest because you must talk to the priest to unlock the features of marrying people in Skyrim!) and once you are wearing it talk to him and you should see an option like \\\"Interested me?\\\" etc...\r\nTo have him follow you just choose the action \\\"Follow me. I need your help\\\"\r\n\r\n[color=orange]How to install:[/color]\r\nInstall the file and copy/cut it into the Skyrim Data file\r\n",
