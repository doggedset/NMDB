  "summary": "Adds a letter in Breezehome that gives you a spell to teleport you to a room. I didn\\'t put in a two-way teleporter spell, so the door that leads out goes to whiterun.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Now I know the room is empty, but if anyone likes it I\\'ll add doors to each city as a sort of fast travel room. This was the first mod I have ever made, I know the teleport sets you in an odd direction. If anyone has any ideas to upgrade on or found any bugs message me.",
