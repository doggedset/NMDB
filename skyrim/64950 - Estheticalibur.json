  "summary": "Sick of running all over skyrim chasing Easter eggs only to be disappointing with lackluster or imitation Excalibur&#39;s. Well Now you can have the real thing, and one knockoff.  \r<br />",
  "descriptionHtml": "I have made this from scratch, it is not a retexture and it is more mesh than texture. It has one version with a sound modification &#34;soul eater&#34;\r<br /> fans Will enjoy it and the rest will go mad. The other one is normal \r<br />sword sounds for those who are faint of heart. I named it estheticalibur\r<br /> because mmoxreview inspires me to be a better modder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Location:\r<br />\r<br />Talos in whiterun should have both versions by his feet.\r<br />\r<br />console names are:\r<br />\r<br />excalibur(with sound effects)\r<br />and\r<br />estheticalibur without and slightly less stats.\r<br />\r<br />Added forge:\r<br />Under Daedric\r<br />-2 Gold Ingot\r<br />-2 Silver Ingot\r<br />-5 Leather Strips\r<br />-1 Steel Sword (For Estheticalibur)\r<br />-1 Estheticalibur (For Excalibur)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thank you everyone for your support. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />My pledge:\r<br />There is no oath of modders, though I feel there should be. For me I will pledge to the community that nothing I ever create for modding \r<br />will be charged. There is no excuse for profiting of the collective work\r<br /> of others. I am grateful I have been given then the tools and education\r<br /> to make something I created possible to use within skyrim. I enjoy the \r<br />fact that I get to leave a part of myself in the world. I do this for my\r<br /> own artistic expression, but when others enjoy it It makes me feel \r<br />wonderful, this is not a job or occupation. If I wanted that I would be \r<br />part of a team creating games or indie games. With that said donations \r<br />are always welcome for all modders I am new to this in skyrim but have \r<br />been part of the homebrew/ mod scene for a long while now. Thank you \r<br />everyone for your support let us keep mods free so everyone can enjoy \r<br />them as the works of art and expression that they are.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />                                                   Donations:\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=U26MNHU8AEU4U]https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=U26MNHU8AEU4U[/url]",
