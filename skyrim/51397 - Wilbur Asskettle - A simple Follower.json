He comes along with his own set of Ebony armor of which he will equip upon you making him your follower (if he does not, then open is inventory and remove one piece and he should wear it then just give him back the piece you took) and you only require to give him some sort of weapon for him to demolish his foes.[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]\r<br />[B][I][COLOR=#7030a0][SIZE=4]\r<br />[/SIZE][/COLOR][/I][/B][B][I][SIZE=4][COLOR=#ff0000]QUEST IS BEING WORKED ON[/COLOR][/SIZE][/I][/B][B][I][SIZE=4][COLOR=#ff0000]\r<br />[/COLOR][/SIZE][/I][/B][B][I][SIZE=4][COLOR=#00b050]Where did the idea come from?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/I][/B][B][/B][B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#ffc000]Simple answer to this.
