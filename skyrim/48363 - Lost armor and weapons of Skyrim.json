  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Times New Roman][size=6]Lost Armors and Weapons of Skyrim\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=2]NOTE: THE BOUND WEAPONS [/size][size=3]WILL [/size][size=2]DISAPPEAR IF YOU UNEQUIP OR DROP THEM&#33; YOU [/size][size=3]MUST [/size][size=2]EQUIP SOMETHING OVER THEM IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM IN YOUR INVENTORY&#33;\r<br />[/size][/font][/center]So I thought it was about time to update this mod. \r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re new to this mod, my aim is to basically make every possible unplayable or rare armor, clothing, or weapon in Skyrim easily accessible. I&#39;ve done this by adding all of the items into the back room of Warmaidens in a large coffin, and on some tables. You can unlock the chest by getting Ulfberth&#39;s house key. Either pickpocket him or kill him for it. If everything comes up as stolen, just use the console command &#34;setownership&#34; and you should be able to take everything without getting in trouble. \r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Here&#39;s a list of what I&#39;ve added with this mod:\r<br />[/size] - Executioner&#39;s Armor\r<br /> - Equipable Bound Weapons (Battleaxe, swords, and a bow. I could not get the arrows to work properly. Sorry.)\r<br /> - Dremora Armor Set (Basically just Daedric Armor, only you can now take it off the corpses of Dremora. I also gave the armor half stats, and half value and made it light armor.)\r<br /> - Giant&#39;s Club\r<br /> - Various Thieve&#39;s Guild Variant Armors\r<br /> - Karliah&#39;s Armor (Female only)\r<br /> - Summerset Shadow&#39;s Armor (Basically just thieve&#39;s guild armor)\r<br /> - Mercer Frey&#39;s Armor set (Guildmaster&#39;s armor. Only now you can loot it off of him)\r<br /> - Nocturnal&#39;s Robes and hood (Female only)\r<br /> - Tsun&#39;s armor and boots\r<br /> - Psyjiic Robes\r<br /> - Various Jarl Clothing\r<br /> - Green Tropical-Looking Robes\r<br /> - Red and White Robes\r<br /> - Grey Robes\r<br /> - Gilded Wristguards\r<br /> - Short-Sleeved Shrouded Armor\r<br /> - Child Clothes (If you decide to play as a child)\r<br /> - Arm Bandages\r<br /> - Ulfric&#39;s Gag\r<br />\r<br />If you have the previous version of this mod already installed, delete (playable_armors) and drop the new file in.\r<br />Thank you for your download.",
