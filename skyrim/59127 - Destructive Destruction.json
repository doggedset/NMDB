  "descriptionHtml": "A small mod which adds an incremental damage scaling to the Destruction school; output increasing with skill and at higher rates for higher mastery levels. (The most cost-effective spells were the lowest level? What the heck was up with THAT, Bethesda?)\r<br />\r<br />Obviously, you&#39;ll want to put this very, very late in the load order, since it affects the Destruction perk tree, and only the Destruction perk tree.\r<br />\r<br />I honestly don&#39;t recall the exact increments at the moment, but I *think* it&#39;s a 1% per Destruction Skill Point for the first perk, 2% per point for the second, 3% for the third and so on. To ensure that cost effectiveness is higher for the top-level spells than for the bottom rung.",
