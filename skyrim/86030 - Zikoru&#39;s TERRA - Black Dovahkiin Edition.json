  "descriptionHtml": "[b]GENERAL INFO:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />One of the most popular weapon mods for Skyrim SE is currently the (wonderful) Zikoru Swords Collection, but unfortunately not all the swords were included in the port and with author Zerofoxer expressing no further interest in adding the lost swords, I feared all was lost. Instead of endlessly searching the nexus for a replacement of my favorite sword, I decided to take it upon myself to port over this wonderful retexture of Zikoru&#39;s TERRA. This sword is a REPLACER of the original sword found in Zerofoxer&#39;s port, meaning it does not require the original, but will replace it when used.\r<br />\r<br />[b]DESCRIPTION:\r<br />\r<br />[/b]The sword itself is a longsword featuring a Valyrian/Damascus steel rippled pattern in full 2048x2048 textures. The sword&#39;s hilt and scabbard are both colored a deep black, with the longsword having the word &#34;Dovahkiin&#34; inscribed down the center of the blade in the dragon language. Comes in both one-handed and two-handed variants.\r<br />\r<br />[b]STATS:\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Base Damage - 17\r<br />Damage per Second (DPS) - 17\r<br />Speed - 1.0\r<br />Reach - 1.0\r<br />Weight - 11\r<br />Value - 1100\r<br />\r<br />[b]CONTACT INFO:\r<br />\r<br />[/b]If anyone has any questions, comments, or complaints, feel free to leave them in the comments section and I will get back to you as soon as I see them&#33; This is my first (public) port so it may or may not have issues, so bring any and all of them to my attention so I can fix them ASAP. If you would like to request any other ports feel free to comment or DM me. I mostly deal with weapon and armor ports (as well as petty thievery and drunken brawls) but I&#39;ll be willing to try mostly anything as long as it isn&#39;t too complicated. \r<br />\r<br />[b]CREDITS:\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Zikoru for the original content ",
