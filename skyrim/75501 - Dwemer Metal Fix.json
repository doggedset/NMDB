  "descriptionHtml": "So you&#39;ve just looted Calcelm-- whatever his name is... his &#39;museum&#39;... and you&#39;re puzzled(or just plain annoyed) to why the scrap metal is hogging your carry capacity value?[b] SO WAS I&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[/b]All this mod does is simple corrects the weight values of the smeltable scrap metals you find, it does ONLY that, doesn&#39;t make leather weightless or anything else weightless for that matter... just makes dwemer metal smelting more &#39;realistic&#39;... well... smelting does have a tendency to &#39;burn off&#39; impurities and the end result is lighter metal... but you&#39;d be as annoyed as I would be if solid dwemer metal was to weigh anything above 5.\r<br />\r<br />I care not for endorsements because I&#39;m not an active modder... but hey, if you like the fact that this mod doesn&#39;t rename anything and add randomers names in the existing names of ingots and other crap just to make the mod developer &#39;popular&#39;.. consider getting this mod known. &lt;3",
