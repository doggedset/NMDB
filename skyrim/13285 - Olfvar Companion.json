  "descriptionHtml": "This mod, my first one that I\\'ve uploaded to the Skyrim Nexus, adds a companion named \\'Olfvar\\', who resides at The Sleeping Giant Inn located in Riverwood.\r\n\r\nOlfvar is equipped with Dragonplate Armour, which cannot be removed from him, and a Daedric Greatsword, which is swappable with other weapons. He is like any other companion and you can store your items, tell him to wait here, or instruct him to go home. He\\'s quite powerful, and is extremely useful for tanking. He has a default bow, which I never put on him but for some reason he draws sometimes, but you can always store another bow into his inventory, unless you just want to leave him like that.\r\n\r\nOlfvar has the normal dialogue options, and should be at The Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood, sitting on a chair near where the bards usually sing. He may, or may not be overpowered, but he does have a great amount of health. Still, he\\'s useful with good armour and weapons.\r\n\r\nInstallination Instructions:\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nExtract OlfvarCompanion.esp to your Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/Data folder. Launch Skyrim, click \\'Data Files\\', and check \\'OlfvarCompanion.esp\\'. It should already be checked for you anyway, but it\\'s worth looking at.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nDelete the ESP file you extracted to your Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/Data folder, and it should be deleted.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, or bugs are showing up with the mod, please comment or send me a message, and I\\'ll get to fixing it.\r\nEndorse my mod, please :)/\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBethesda Softworks - for producing the game \\'Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\\'\r\nSteam - the gaming engine.\r\nCreation Kit - Skyrim\\'s mod creation program.\r\nAnd me, ozzy561, for assembling the mod.\r\nVIEW, DOWNLOAD, ENDORSE.",
