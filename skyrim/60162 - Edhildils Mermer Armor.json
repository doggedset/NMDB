  "descriptionHtml": "Edhildils Mermer Armor\r<br />Author: Edhildil\r<br />08,26,2014\r<br />ver1\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/1236/descriptionn.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Background:\r<br />\r<br />The Mermer are Sea Elves or Mer-elves that live in the Deep and are very seldom if ever seen. Little is Known about the Mermer, the rumours are just a faint murmer.(duh). The last known sighting was 200 years ago during the end of the Oblivion crisis (The Tritons of Cyrodiil), but they were corrupted and tried to kill the 7th Champion of Cyrodiil.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is armor I originally made for Oblivion from The Tritons of Cyrodiil. The pieces are modular and will fit with each other so you can mix and match.This is not really a lore friendly mod. The shoes use HDT High Heels system. The outfit is created from a specific custom body shape made from CBBE based on DMRA from Oblivion. This is skimpy so expect a lot of skin.\r<br />\r<br />I did not weight it to BBP or TBBP on purpose because the animations made the breasts look like cones and was horrible&#33; \r<br />\r<br />The world model for the armor pieces looks like a fishegg, and acts like one. That means if you drop one of the items it will look like a fishegg and it will look like a fishegg in your inventory. Why? Because it is funny.\r<br />\r<br />Pieces include:\r<br />\r<br />Bikini with seaweed, shells, and starfish. (secondary Bikini with just shells and seaweed)\r<br />Gloves with claws and kelp skin\r<br />Pauldrons made from conches\r<br />High Heel Shoes with seahorses\r<br />Barnacles on the body for added protection\r<br />Crab Backpack (+100 to weight Carry&#33;)\r<br />Octopus Mask (Underwater breathing&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />You may have to apply the High Heels effect via MCM features.\r<br />\r<br />Location:\r<br />See Screenshots. Its deep in the ocean and you will have to swim for it. About 15 feet west of the lower sunken ship in a shallow cave in Pilgrims Trench. Once your get the items from the chest put on the breather so you won&#39;t drown and die. You may want to save before you take the dive,in case it takes to long to find. Its very deep, but ive found it without a waterbreathing potion.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />mods in screenshots include:\r<br />\r<br />Hair: Apachii SkyHair female pack\r<br />Skin: Sporty Sexy Sweat, SG Textures Renewal CBBE\r<br />Eyes: The Eyes of Beauty\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]MQS-9DpKS1k[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/3664/updatesb.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4153/requir.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Calientes CBBE body mod installed and running in your game.(textures)\r<br />\r<br />HDT High Heels system\r<br />\r<br /> \r<br />[img]http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/2482/installa.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Unzip Data file to a temporary location \r<br />Check folder paths and make adjustments if needed\r<br />copy/paste into Skyrim folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />\r<br />Delete Data_meshes_armor_edhildil_mermer folder\r<br />\r<br />Delete Data_textures_armor_edhildil_mermer folder\r<br />\r<br />Delete Edhildils Mermer Armor esp. file\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/8579/creditslo.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Caliente for CBBE\r<br />Edhildil\r<br />Edhildil, Apachii, and DonMichael71 for the heels \r<br />Seedbuster AKA A Type 2 for inspiration (Double Melons body)\r<br />Acdale for inspiration (Acdale made HGEC rounder butt mod)\r<br />\r<br />Special thanks to Vatiwah for the great video&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I made DMRA for Oblivion because of Speedbuster and Acdale&#39;s contribution.
