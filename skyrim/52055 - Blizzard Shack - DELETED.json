  "descriptionHtml": "Blizzard Shack is a shack located at Blizzard Rest (see screenshot)\r<br />\r<br />I designed the shack for an assassin or mage type character, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be for that kind of character\r<br />\r<br />The shack has a single bed  next to a bedside table that can be used for storage as well as a wardrobe. I have have added a chest called &#34;trophies&#34; for an assassin who likes to collect trophies after he or she kills the target. I put 8 weapon plaques on the wall to display your weapons and i added 4 barrels outside the house. There are shelves with potions and ingredients as well as an alchemy table with a satchel on it. The front door is not a  load door so no waiting as you enter, and i choose a secret wardrobe as a door for this way on the outside you have a solid door and a jail door on front of it for a more secure look and i added no windows as it is sort of a hideout",
