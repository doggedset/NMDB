  "summary": "This mod is simply a showroom for all your best stuff.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I made this for myself, not as a player home, but as a showroom for all my stuff.  I may in the future make a home and add this to it, but for now I figured I could go ahead and share it.  I\\'ve never modded before and as far as I can tell everything is working properly.  The showroom includes many manniquins, weapon racks, display cases and bookshelves.  I made a simple entrace to the showrrom through a trapdoor inside of Breezehome.  If you like it I\\'d love to see someone include my showroom in one of their player home mods, just give me a little credit.  Hope you like it and let me know how I can impove lighting, layout, etc...  \r\n\r\nUpdated v1.1.  The door now works.  Must have been a conflict before.  Thanks for the help in fixing this!\r\n\r\nUpdate v1.2 - Added navmesh and fixed door.\r\n\r\nUpdate v1.3 - Changed the encounter zone, hope that prevents things from disappearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nStopped supporting.  This was my first mod so there will probably be bugs.  Use at your own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to ohiogramps for helping me fix things and make this mod more functional.  ",
