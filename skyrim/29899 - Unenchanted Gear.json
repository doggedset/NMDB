  "descriptionHtml": "This mod allows you to craft unenchanted versions of unique weapons and armor after you have acquired them. In some cases you can create the alternative item as well if you had two choices. Also includes an alternate light armor Emerald Spellbreaker.\r\n\r\nAll items are duplicates and none of the original files are edited.  If I left any really cool items out, let me know.  I didn\\'t include the base armor from the various guilds because you would just replace it a few quests later.  Some of the leather items were put into the scale category so they can be double improved with smithing perks.  You don\\'t need smithing perks to create them, just complete the required quest for it to be added to your list.  The recipes are generally the same as a similar basic item, plus an extra component related to the specific item.\r\n\r\nMost of the items can be crafted immediately after acquiring them.  Some, like the Nightingale armor and weapons won\\'t be available until you become a true Nightingale by returning the Skeleton Key.  Here\\'s the list:\r\n\r\nArchmage Robes\r\nArchmage Hooded Robes\r\nArchmage Boots\r\n  --  Become the Archmage\r\n\r\nKeening\r\n  --  He won\\'t be needing it anymore. \r\n\r\nJester Clothes, Hat, Boots, and Gloves\r\n  --  Ask Cicero...nicely?\r\n\r\nNightingale Blade/Bow\r\nNightingale Armor\r\n  --  Become a true Nightingale (Darkness Returns)\r\n\r\nAncient Shrouded Armor\r\n  --  Regular shrouded just won\\'t do (Breaching Security)\r\n\r\nBlade of Woe\r\n  --  Must be given freely or opted out completely (no picking pockets)\r\n\r\nChillrend\r\nThieves\\' Guild Master Armor\r\n  --  Become the thieves guild leader\r\n\r\nThalmor Robes\r\nThalmor Hooded Robes\r\n  --  Take it from the source (Diplomatic Immunity)\r\n\r\nWuuthrad\r\nShield of Ysgramor\r\n  --  Lead the Companions\r\n\r\nDawnbreaker\r\nEbony Blade\r\nEbony Mail\r\nMace of Molag Bal\r\nMehrunes Razor\r\nMasque of Clavicus Vile\r\nThe Rueful Axe\r\nSpellbreaker/Emerald Spellbreaker\r\nSavior\\'s Hide\r\nVolendrung\r\n  --  Complete the appropriate Daedric quest; however you want.\r\n\r\nThese are all base unenchanted items, no changes other than the Ebony Blade.  I fixed it to be two handed and upped the damage a bit.  The Emerald Spellbreaker is a retextured version of the regular Spellbreaker.  I wanted a light armor version with the existing enchant.  It\\'s the only item that uses up the original to create it.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.1:\r\nGhostblade\r\n  --  Ansilvund holds the answer\r\n\r\nDrainspell Sword, Axe, and Bow\r\n  --  Fully explore Labyrinthian\r\n\r\nMystic Dawn Robes\r\nMystic Dawn Hooded Robes\r\n  --  Finish assembling Mehrune\\'s Razor first\r\n\r\nAlso added an unenchanted version of the Emerald Spellbreaker.  Not sure why I didn\\'t include that to begin with...oops.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.11\r\nPsiijic Outfit\r\n  --  Maybe the Archmage robe isn\\'t for you\r\n\r\nGreybeard\\'s Outfit\r\n  --  To become a Greybeard you must first meet their leader \r\n\r\nAlso adjusted the weights of the clothing to be consistent.
