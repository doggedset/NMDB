I went with Hadvar and he is wearing Imperial light armour.",
  "descriptionHtml": "When you load this save you will be just outside Helgen Keep. He will be wearing Imperial light armour, a Iron sword and a long bow (also arrows). I alson went with Hadvar but that dose not make to much difference. \r<br />\r<br />To install just drop the saves into your saves folder located:\r<br />This PC/Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Saves.\r<br />\r<br />If any one has any ideas to make this save better, please message me. \r<br />\r<br />Required Mods:\r<br />NorthBorn Scars By Northborn: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49279/?",
