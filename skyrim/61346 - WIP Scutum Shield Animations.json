  "descriptionHtml": "Replaces vanilla shield animations with ones appropriate for shields with horizontal central grip. Examples of such shields are the famous Roman Scutum and other iron age shields before the Völkerwanderung period\r<br />\r<br />You can find some of these shields in these mods:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60287/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60287/?[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10740/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10740/?\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32988/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]If you use any of the mods listed above along with the animations in this mod, you would notice that the shields are rotated at a wierd angle when you block. This is due to the fact that Jedo_Dre had rotated the shields in his mod to suit vanilla animations. [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]I&#39;ve uploaded a quick [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/download/1000141619]patch[/url] to fix this issue under Jedo_Dre&#39;s permission.[/color] [color=#ffff00]You can find it in the Files tab under the heading &#39;Optional Files&#39;.[/color] Textures are not included in the patch so please make sure you already have Jedo_Dre&#39;s mod installed beforehand. I&#39;ve also changed the collision models of these shields so they do actually block arrows now (most of the time anyway). Please note that this is just a &#39;quick fix&#39; which I used for testing my animations. I don&#39;t really play the game much so please let me know if you spot any issues as I don&#39;t have time to pick them out myself\r<br />\r<br />I DO NOT recommend using these with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60784/?]Open Ward Shield Stance[/url]. Different style and time period.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][b]Warning: [/b][/color]These animations are designed as a modder&#39;s resource for total conversion mods that don&#39;t yet exist, and will look odd with some of the existing shields from vanilla Skyrim, like the Dwarven shield for example, which will now be held horizontally. This is due to the fact that in vanilla Skyrim, shields all have vertical grips. If this bothers you, you can rotate the shields in Nifskope by 90 degrees although the handgrip will no longer fit the hand. Here&#39;s the how-to:\r<br />\r<br />1. Unpack Skyrim - Meshes.bsa in your Data folder using a bsa unpacker.\r<br />2. Find the mesh files (in nif format) of the shields that annoy you. Open them up in Nifskope\r<br />3. In Nifskope, click on the model to select it. Then right click and select rotate under the transform option.\r<br />4. Rotate the shield by approximately 90 degrees ANTICLOCKWISE. Remember to save when you finish.\r<br />5. Place it in your data folder as a loose file using the same file path as in Skyrim - Meshes.bsa",
