  "summary": "Turn Whiterun into a Archery Practice Field with \\\"Whiterun Archery Targets\\\"\r\nFor Role-Players and for Archers looking to improve their skills.\r\nTargets are placed in strategic locations.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/lMobr.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/VDFhU.jpg[/img]\r\nAs witnessed during several dragon attacks to the city of Whiterun, few townspeople are capable with a bow and arrow. Because Archers are key to bringing down a dragon, the Jarl has decided to place Archery Targets around the town for residents to practice their skills.\r\n\r\nThe Jarl has decided to place targets in only the lower half of Whiterun to \\\"test the waters\\\". If the targets gain large approval from the townsfolk, then the Jarl may consider adding extra targets to the other parts of Whiterun. In fact, he may spread the word of it\\'s effectiveness to [b]other cities.[/b]\r\n[b](So if you like this mod, please endorse or leave supporting comments for future expansions!)[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/zwyiK.jpg[/img]\r\nThis mod adds a total of 10 targets.\r\nIt is for role-playing characters who enjoy the challenge of striking a bulls-eye on a hidden target several hundred feet away. For characters who know exactly where their arrow will hit before they release. For people who savor the thunk of arrow on wood.\r\nIf you enjoy using the bow in Skyrim, or are Wood Elves at heart, then this mod is for you.\r\n\r\nSome targets are more obscure than others, and I have tried to have a mix of both challenging and simpler targets.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/7H1qU.jpg[/img]\r\nIT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to use [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9558]City Forests and Landscape V2 Trees.[/url] I have maximized compatibility with this mod so the targets integrate seamlessly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/GRsB0.jpg[/img]\r\nPlease drop the downloaded .ESP inside your Skyrim Directory under \\\"Data\\\".\r\nMake sure \\\"Whiterun Archery Targets - KDC.esp\\\" is ticked in the NMM, or under \\\"Data Files\\\" in the Skyrim Launcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/ul6O9.jpg[/img]\r\nRemove \\\"Whiterun Archery Targets - KDC.esp\\\" from your Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/iN2qb.jpg[/img]\r\nv1.0 First Release. 10 Targets.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Xh7EH.jpg[/img]\r\nThis will be my FIRST mod that I have ever released.\r\nThis mod was built with the CK released by Bethesda.\r\nIf you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to post them.",
