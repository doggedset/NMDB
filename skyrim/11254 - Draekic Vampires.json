  "descriptionHtml": "Draekic Vampires\r\n  \r\nby Draeka\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Powers!  New Factions!  New Abilities!  Vampires overhauled!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for checking out my mod!\r\n\r\nThis mod is intended to work alone and NOT with other Vampire mods.  Combine with other Vampire mods at your own risk.  This mod makes changes to default abillities for vampires and completely removes the use of the default vampire quest and its associated script.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n-Replaced:  Stages 1-4 of Vampirism are now new Stages of 1 & 2.  Stage 2 now occurs after 3-4 days of not Feeding and in essence replaces Stage 4.  This includes a bunch of new changes, read on.\r\n\r\n-Removed:  \\'Blood-starved\\' vampires will no longer be hated and killed as a Global Event.  \r\n\r\n-Removed:  Vampire Drain spell(s).\r\n\r\n-Changed:  Factions have been edited in this mod to reflect specific NPCs that will kill any Stage Vampire on sight.  Such as the Vigilants of Stendarr.  However Wolves, NPC Vampires and NPC Vampire Thralls are now friendly and will aid the PC Vampire in battle (only during Stage 1).  They are still attackable (in case you need to kill one for a quest).\r\n\r\n-New Abilities:  Supernatural Strength, Undead Lungs\r\n\r\n-New Feeding:  Bite (for sleepers) and Quick Bite (for awake NPCs while sneaking)  ~BETA\r\n\r\n-New Powers:  Summon Greater Minion, Undead Eyes, Hypnotism(was Seduction), Celerity, Life Stealer, Ghost Form, Bat Form(BETA)\r\n\r\n-Changed:  Vampires now suffer -90 HP/MP/STM in the daylight at Stage 1.\r\n\r\n-Changed:  Vampires now suffer -190 HP/MP/STM in the daylight at Stage 2.\r\n\r\n-Changed:  Vampires have -100% to their HP/MP/STM regen rates in sunlight (both stages).\r\n\r\n-Changed: \\'Sanguinaire Vampiris\\' will now cause Vampirism after only one day of incubation.  Be careful fighting Vampires they\\'ll make you sick... >:)\r\n\r\n-Unchanged:  Champion of the Night and Nightstalker\\'s Footsteps are still vanilla.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nChange Log:\r\n\r\n02/19/2012-Stage 2 Vampirism now removes all Vampire Powers.  Powers return when you Feed.\r\n\r\n02/19/2012-Someone left their clothes lying around on the floor at the Sleeping Giant Inn...\r\n\r\n02/19/2012-All Vampires should now have Celerity during Stage 1\r\n\r\n02/19/2012-Removed Summon Lesser Minions (it will return as something different and be stage 1)\r\n\r\n02/22/2012-Reduced the speed mult for Celerity.  Was overpowered.\r\n\r\n02/22/2012-The Count Stravokov suit is meant for male characters but females that wear it should now have the proper textures showing.\r\n\r\n02/22/2012-Life Stealer has had its magnitude increased and slight increase in its special effect.  It now has no cost to cast . It is now only LeftHanded.\r\n\r\n02/25/2012-New Vampire Eyes have been added to the \\'humanoid\\' races.  Khajiit and Argonian are excluded. This includes most Vampire NPCs.\r\n\r\n03/03/2012-Celerity now lasts 1 second and is faster (its visual effects have been altered slightly)\r\n\r\n03/03/2012-Undead Eyes has had its Detect Life removed (its visual effects have been altered)\r\n\r\n03/03/2012-New Lesser Power:  Ghost Form!\r\n\r\n03/03/2012-New \\'Quick Bite\\' feed option.  While Sneaking press \\'E\\' near an NPC.\r\n\r\n03/16/2012-Ghost Form has been modified.  Its use improved.\r\n\r\n03/16/2012-Life Stealer has been changed.  It drains less health but now also drains Stamina and slows the target down briefly.  It has also been given a spell cost.\r\n\r\n03/16/2012-New Lesser Power:  Bat Form (outside only)\r\n\r\n03/16/2012-Quick Bite and Bite now both cause damage on the victim.  Every bite will hurt your target for 35HP.  This CAN kill your target so becareful.  This has been added because it will be part of the Vampire Siring proccess to be added in the next update.\r\n\r\n03/16/2012-Fixed Stage 2 Sun Damage.  It will now properly reduced 190 points from each stat.\r\n\r\n03/23/2012-The bug to Life Stealer has been fixed by removing the \\'Slow\\' effect.\r\n\r\n03/23/2012-Bat Form should be a lot less buggy when you turn it off.\r\n\r\n03/23/2012-Quick Bite has had further bug fixes.  It also will no longer work on \\'everything\\'.  That was never intended.  It should hopefully work on only on the playable races (which includes of course NPCs like Forsworn) but also on other Vampires.  Quick Bite is still receiving work.\r\n\r\n03/23/2012-Lots of bug fixes to Bite, Quick Bite and other powers and including curing vampirism.\r\n\r\n03/24/2012-Quick Bite should no longer freeze the player on rare occasions when the animations for it fail.\r\n\r\n03/24/2012-Bat Form now works only at night.  Some additional small bug fixes.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nInstallation:  \r\n\r\nThis mod is an overhaul for Vampirism.  It may not work with other Vampire Overhaul mods.  Use this mod only with a character that is not already a vampire and does not have the disease \\\"Sanguinaire Vampiris\\\".\r\nConsole command to Infect:  Player.AddSpell 000b8780   <---- (repeat until percentile integers stop showing.)\r\nConsole command to Cure:  setstage 0005C625 200\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n\r\n-If new abilities aren\\'t showing after the mod updates wait around to Stage 2 (3 days) and then Feed.\r\n-You might see doubles of the vampirism effects/abilities/powers in the Magic menu.  Feeding should fix this (or waiting 3 days to stage 2).  This is due to an inherent bug with Skyrim.  \r\n-Bat Form is in a beta release.  It will receive future updates.  Also, do not spam Bat Form.  DO NOT cast Ghost Form while in Bat Form.  If you do cast Bat Form again to hopefully fix the errors that may occur.  Celerity works with Bat Form (no known errors).\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPlanned Features:\r\n\r\n-New Vampire Perk Tree (not under construction yet)\r\n\r\n-New Feed abilities or spells (released)\r\n\r\n-New vampire transformations (released)\r\n\r\n-New Vampire siring (under construction)\r\n\r\n-New Vampire skin color, eyes, weapons, armor and quests (under construction/released)\r\n\r\n_New Faction Ambushers:  Witch Hunters, Vigilants of Stendarr, Knights of the Nine and The Order (under construction)\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nDraeka - Creator\r\n\r\nRedwood Elf - Aid\r\n\r\nrmbackslash - Tester/Scriptor/QAQC/Vampire Siring specialist\r\n\r\nCorellan - Tester/Scriptor/QAQC\r\n\r\nRandomNoob - Tester/Aid\r\n\r\nporroone - Aid\r\n\r\nPlanteur - Tester/Aid\r\n\r\nFulkren - Tester/Artist/Aid\r\n\r\nVerdur - Tester/Fan\r\n\r\nCheshire Steak - Tester/Fan\r\n\r\ndracula468 - Tester/Super-Fan\r\n\r\n******************Thanks for stopping by!
