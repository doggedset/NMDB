  "descriptionHtml": "Be Aware that there will always be some degree of clipping because the hood is so big and floppy. I&#39;ve been wanting this for awhile now but haven&#39;t found anything similar to this mod. Caliente&#39;s bodyslide 2 mod allowed me to create this. I&#39;ve uploaded the .nif file for those who do not want to use bodyslide. cheers.",
