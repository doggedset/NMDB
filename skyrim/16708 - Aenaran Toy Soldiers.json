  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][size=18pt]Aenaran Toy Soldiers[/size][/b][/center]\r\n[center][i]Miniature Mayhem![/i] [/center] \r\n\r\nYouTube Links: [url=http://youtu.be/LXYUe9_n7Pw]Hero Fight[/url] * [url=http://youtu.be/xgojuiIaryg]Whiterun Invasion[/url] * [url=http://youtu.be/R4xroE3m-ds]Large Battle[/url]\r\n\r\nThis mod is inspired by the entertaining [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12476]ColloseusXs Toy Soldiers[/url]. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3185490]ColloseusX[/url] is an avid gamer so I\\'m guessing his attention is elsewhere right now as his last update was almost two months ago. I\\'ve had much fun playing around with his mod but I\\'ve had ideas for more since it first came out. Last weekend I decided to get my own going.\r\n\r\nAll units are Conjuration spells--one spell for each faction. The spells are found in a chest in Whiterun. Head into Dragonsreach, go into Farengar\\'s library and there\\'s a chest sitting on the table.\r\n\r\n- Factions: Stormcloaks, Imperials, Thalmor, Forsworn, Skeleton, Dwemer\r\n- Standard Units: each faction has a Melee, Ranged, and Caster\r\n- Hero Units: heads of each faction. Stormcloaks have Ulfric, Imperials have Tullius, Dwemer have Steam Centurions, etc\r\n- Exotic Units: Dragons (Frost, Fire, Undead)\r\n- Summoning Arch: summons 1-3 Standard Units every minute or so.\r\n- Custom Spells, Items, and Armor: This mod won\\'t affect the items you use. And other mods won\\'t affect the Toys.\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]== Next Up! =====[/color]\r\n- More Factions:  Draugr, Bandits, Vampires, and More!\r\n- More Exotics\r\n- Arch Settings: Allow the player to customize how the Arches summon\r\n- Balancing: tweaking of health, damage, and abilities\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]== Future Plans =====[/color]\r\n- Custom Arena with Player-defined teams\r\n- Themed Toy World with a variety of environments for your Toys kill eachother in\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]== Known Compatible Mods =====[/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10740]Roman Armor and Weapons for Imperial Legions[/url]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]== [ Requirements ] =====[/color]\r\nNone, other than the game itself\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]== [ Installation Instructions ] =====[/color]\r\nFor simplicity\\'s sake use a mod manager like [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/content/modmanager/]Nexus Mod Manager[/url]. \r\nFor manual installation place \\\"AenaranToys.esp\\\" and \\\"AenaranToys.bsa\\\" into your Skyrim/Data folder. Be sure \\\"AenaranToys.esp\\\" is checked in the Data Files portion of the Skyrim launcher.\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]== [ Uninstallation Instructions ] =====[/color]\r\nDelete \\\"AenaranToys.esp\\\" and \\\"AenaranToys.bsa\\\" from the Skyrim/Data folder or deactivate it in your mod manager.\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]== [ Incompatibility ] =====[/color]\r\nEverything is uniquely named so there shouldn\\'t be too many conflicts. We\\'ll see! Can run with the original Toy Soldiers no problem.\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]== [ Known Issues ] =====[/color]\r\n- Dragons are grounded and don\\'t grant souls. Yet there\\'s an internal issue with registering hits. Summoning too many dragons will lower your FPS until I can figure this out.\r\n- The Skeleton Hero\\'s shout hits anything in its path. If summoned near other NPCs (it loves guards) they\\'ll get fiesty.\r\n- Ulfric\\'s Fus Ro Dah can sometimes push Toys under the floor or into walls.\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]== [ Credits ] =====[/color]\r\n[url=http://www.YouTube.com/ColloseusXReturns]ColloseusX[/url] for being awesome.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3499460]ABABZ[/url] for great testing and feedback!\r\nBethesda Softworks for creating another excellent TES game.\r\nAll the helpful people on the forums at [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/]BethSoft.com[/url] and [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/forum/419-skyrim-modding/]NexusMods.com[/url].\r\nNetFlix for streaming [i]Murder, She Wrote[/i]. JB Fletcher\\'s murder-solving hijinks are pleasantly distracting.\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]== [ Licensing ] =====[/color]\r\nThere are currently no new assets associated with this mod.
