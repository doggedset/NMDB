  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][color=red]Skeever on the Barbie[/color][/size]\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Change Log[/b][/size]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]2013-04-02: version 1.0b released, added as optional file. Changed skeever loot table to be compatible with ZombieMaster98\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34178]Live Off The Land Skyrim Overhaul[/url] mod. Must be loaded after \\'Live Off The Land\\' for compatibility.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\nThis is a simple mod that expands the usefulness of that disgusting little creature we all know and love, the skeever. The mod adds two new recipes and slightly modifies the skeevers themselves.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Skeever Changes[/b][/size]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]All skeevers, including Venomfang skeevers and pre-placed skeever corpses, have a small chance to drop one Charred Skeever Hide. This chance is slightly higher than the chance to drop gold and low-level gems and jewelry.\r\n[*]Spider sacs that contain skeever corpses have the same chance to hold one Charred Skeever Hide in addition to the tail. \r\n[*]Spitted skeevers on campfires give one Charred Skeever Hide and one Charred Skeever Meat. \r\n[*]Spitted skeevers read \\\"Carve Charred Skeever\\\" instead of \\\"Harvest Charred Skeever\\\".[/list]\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Recipes[/b][/size]\r\nThese two recipes can be created at any [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Cooking_Place]cooking spit or pot[/url] you come across.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Charred Skeever Hide: Requires 3 Skeever Tails and 1 Fire Salts. Weight is 0.5. Recipe listed under \\'Misc\\'.\r\n[*]Charred Skeever Meat: Requires 2 Skeever Tails and 1 Salt Pile. Weight is 0.5, restores 5 health. Recipe is listed under \\'Food\\'.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\nObviously the main point of this mod is to increase the availability of Charred Skeever Hides. Alchemy shops [i]very[/i] rarely sell them and collecting them from campfires all over Skyrim is a pain. Skeever Tails make decent poisons, but Charred Skeever Hides make great healing potions. Requiring several tails as well as Fire Salts to create one hide makes them less scarce but not effortless to build up a quantity.\r\n\r\nAs for the Charred Skeever Meat, I included that as a joke. There\\'s only one known Charred Skeever Meat in the game (in Raldbthar Deep Market), and it\\'s worthless. So I said what the heck. Bumped up the health restore slightly and created a recipe. It\\'s still pretty worthless since I didn\\'t increase the value, so you\\'d be pumping 8 gold worth of ingredients into a 4 gold recipe for 5 health. But if you want to make them, knock yourself out. :)\r\n\r\nThis mod also works great together with ZombieMaster98\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34178]Live Off The Land Skyrim Overhaul[/url] mod. He\\'s put a lot of work into enhancing the Hunter and Alchemist experience of Skyrim. You\\'ll need the \\'compatible\\' version of this mod in order for it to work with ZombieMaster98\\'s, but they do work nicely together. Go check out his mod.\r\n\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Installation[/b][/size]\r\n1) Download with NMM and activate.\r\nor\r\n2) Unpack the RAR into your main Skyrim folder (the .esp is in a \\\\Data\\\\ folder).\r\nMake sure the .esp is checked under Data Files, and run [url=http://code.google.com/p/better-oblivion-sorting-software/downloads/list]BOSS[/url] just to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Uninstalling[/b][/size]\r\n1) Deactivate in NMM.\r\nand/or\r\n2) Delete \\'Skeever on the Barbie.esp\\' from your \\\\Data\\\\ folder.\r\n\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Known Issues[/b][/size]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]\\'Crafted\\' Charred Skeever Hides do not stack with regular hides. They are listed as \\'Food\\' in your inventory due to being make at a cooking pot. Otherwise they behave like normal Charred Skeever Hides (and do stack in the Alchemy Table interface). If anyone knows how to fix this, feel free to PM me.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Conflicts/Incompatibilities[/b][/size]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]This mod should work on all versions of Skyrim, since it only modifies vanilla assets and doesn\\'t call on any other .esm file. \r\n[*]ZombieMaster98\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34178]Live Off The Land Skyrim Overhaul[/url] mod: conflicting loot drops for skeevers. A compatible version has been added under Optional Files. See change log for details.\r\n[*]Could conflict with any other mod that changes: DeathItemSkeever, CharredSkeever, TreasSpiderWebSacSkeever (I don\\'t know of any other mods that change any of those, but those are the ones to watch for in TES5Edit.) \r\n[*]Recipes shouldn\\'t conflict with anything as they have unique Editor IDs.[/list]\r\n\r\n====================================================\r\n\r\nIf you have any comments or questions, feel free to leave them.\r\nEnjoy.\r\n",
