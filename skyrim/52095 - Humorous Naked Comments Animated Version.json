  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=4]Animation Versions...NOW AVAILABLE&#33;[/center][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=red][center]HUMOROUS NAKED COMMENTS[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][center][color=yellow]Male and Female Versions Available[/size][/center][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][center]***READ [color=red]WARNING[/color] BELOW BEFORE STARTING A NEW GAME***[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=yellow][u]Description[/size][/color][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]This mod changes some of the NPC &#34;naked&#34; comments to be more &#34;flattering&#34; or &#34;funny&#34;, rather than &#34;rude&#34;.  There is a version designed for a male character and a version for a female character.  Only the comments of the opposite sex are changed for each version, so don&#39;t worry about male NPCs &#34;hitting&#34; on you if you stroll around nude as a guy...they will still tell you to get dressed or tell you how stupid you are for being naked.  I assume you would only want to hear the new dialogue from the opposite sex.  If you want comments from both male and female NPCs...use both versions.\r<br />\r<br />No new lines of dialogue are added with this mod.  All of the new &#34;comments&#34; are existing lines of dialogue that is said for another &#34;event&#34;.  I took the lines of dialogue that followers say when &#34;seeing an impressive view&#34; and swapped them out for the nude comments, so you&#39;ll occasionally still hear your followers make these comments when traveling throughout Skyrim.  Not every type of voice had this type of dialogue though, so the ones that didn&#39;t, I had to find a substitute.  For the female&#39;s reactions, I used the &#34;comment on entering with a drawn weapon&#34; dialogue, so now it sounds like they are referring to your &#34;tool&#34; as a weapon, when they tell you to &#34;put it away&#34; or something.  For the male&#39;s reactions, I used the &#34;comment on a dragon being killed&#34; dialogue as a substitute for seeing a naked woman...more of a shock value...OMG&#33; reaction.  In addition to changing the NPC&#39;s remarks, I increased the frequency of how much they say them.  Now, practically every NPC will comment on the fact that you are nude, instead of just the occasional remark, like in the vanilla game.  \r<br />\r<br />Also, this mod is not intended to increase &#34;immersion&#34; or add to the realism of the game, so don&#39;t bother messaging me about how this is ruining the game.  It is a &#34;joke&#34; mod...to be taken lightly.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=red][center]Animated[/color][color=yellow] Versions add the following effects...[/color][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]- If you use the Male Version, females will either point at you or &#34;stare/study/examine&#34; you as they comment.  The females that refer to your &#34;tool&#34; as a &#34;thing&#34; or &#34;weapon&#34; will point.  The ones that &#34;admire&#34; you, will stare/study/examine you.\r<br />- If you use the Female Version, males will either clap, dance, or point at you as they comment.  I tried to make it as &#34;immersive&#34; as possible.  Most males will clap, but drunks, younger males, and soldiers will dance.  High Elves will point at you.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][center][u]**All animations are Skyrim &#34;default&#34; animations.

IT WILL NOT WORK.  I do not know why it doesn&#39;t, it just doesn&#39;t.  I found this out the hard way.  I spent 2 days trying to get it to work on a new game, and finally gave up.  If you plan to start a new game, drag the .ESP file out of your DATA folder before you start.  Once the game is started, you can activate it.  I waited until I reached Helgen Keep for the first time to activate it, and it works fine.[/size]",
