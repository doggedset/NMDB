  "modName": "Nirnroot Manor - A Functional Home",
  "summary": "A unique player home designed with storage and display in mind. It is located just outside of Riften on the main road. This house is compatible with Hearthfire Multiple Adoption Mod by TMPhoenix and supports 6 children.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I found most homes in Skyrim to be lacking as far as display and storage are concerned. I wanted something functional (hence the original\r<br /> name) and visually pleasing. I placed the home outside of Riften as I didn&#39;t want to mess around in the town. \r<br />\r<br />The armoury has 10 mannequins with a weapon rack, plaque, and display for each. Numerous custom player storage containers are scattered throughout the home. The latest update comes packed with over a dozen new NPCS, including several master trainers. Please note that there are 3 secret rooms [one per floor] hidden throughout the house. See if you can find them all.\r<br />\r<br />This mod was cleaned using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/?]TES5edit[/url] \r<br />\r<br />----------------\r<br />Instructions for moving your family in (changing homes)\r<br />\r<br />1. Make sure you have [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249/?]Hearthfire Multiple Adoption mod by TMPhoenix[/url] installed. \r<br />2. Go inside and cast Bless Home spell\r<br />3. Talk to either your spouse or kids, and tell them to move to the new home.\r<br />\r<br />Hope this helps :)\r<br />----------------\r<br />\r<br />I can&#39;t believe that my mod has been downloaded over 250 times. Thank you to everyone who has been willing to give a first time modders project a chance. I hope you enjoy using my mod as much as I enjoyed creating it. Thank you to AtomicNewt for being my top QC guy and fountain of support. \r<br />\r<br />Huge thanks to those who came before me, and documented their journey.
