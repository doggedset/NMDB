  "descriptionHtml": "Looking to have a pretty character in game? Well look no further. Here is Lessa. A woman brought into Skyrim after her family was brutally murdered by the Jarl of her hold. She survived 12 years before getting her revenge and killing him. No here she comes to skyrim. The imperials tried to kill her along with Ulfic Stormcloak only to discover she is Dragonborn. And not just any dragon born but she legitimately has half the blood of a dragon in her.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy and thanks for checking her out. \r<br />\r<br />Here is the link for the mod required to give her horns and the textures on her face. http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72416/?",
