I originally was going to do this for my own character, so I’d have little bases everywhere, then I decided to upload it.\r<br />\r<br />It’s actually been connected to the player house exterior, and occupies the space where the garden used to be, the thief barrel has been moved forward, not deleted.\r<br />\r<br />The main thing I hate is loading screens, even worse with many graphical enhancing mods installed, so I like homes with no loads whenever possible.\r<br />\r<br />It contains:\r<br />\r<br />•\tWorkbench\r<br />•\tAnvil\r<br />•\tSharpening Wheel\r<br />•\tBed\r<br />•\tEnchanting Table\r<br />•\tAlchemy Table\r<br />•\tCooking Pot\r<br />•\t15 Various Safe Storage Containers\r<br />•\t2 Weapon Plaques\r<br />\r<br />It also contains a Recipe for a poison which causes 20 damage per second for 5 seconds. You need to cook it. I’m experimenting with poisons right now, so it may be too strong/weak for some at the moment.\r<br />\r<br />Then we have Assassin’s Arrows which are modified Nord Hero Arrows. They can be crafted at an anvil or forge. I plan to add a custom appearance to them as soon as I can, for now, they just have these buffs:\r<br />\r<br />•\t26 Damage\r<br />•\tIgnores Normal Weapon Resistance\r<br />•\t5000 Speed (default 3600)\r<br />•\t0.10 Gravity (default 0.35)\r<br />•\t80,000 Range (default 60,000)\r<br />•\t2.5 Impact Force (default 1.0)\r<br />•\tSilent Detection Level (default Normal)\r<br />\r<br />This makes these arrows powerful and silent, perfect for assassinations. They travel at greater speeds, are lightweight, thus stay in the air longer before falling, coupled with an increased range and improved impact force.\r<br />They may be too powerful at the moment though, so they may be adjusted or have increased requirements to craft to balance it out.\r<br />\r<br />Anyway, it’s up to you if you like this, any feedback is welcome. You’ll find the key on top of the thief cache outside the hideout.\r<br />[center][img]http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/7272/79284864.png[/img][/center]",
