THIS STATEMENT OVERRIDES ANYTHING IN THE PERMISSIONS POPUP THAT IS AVAILABLE ON NEXUS THAT CONFLICTS WITH THIS STATEMENT.\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t really like the rain in the vanilla game, so I altered the texture. This one is 4x larger than vanilla (but still has a very small filesize). It allowed me to do a few extra things to it that just make it look better in the game than if it were smaller. Hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\nIf you like, check out my other files!\r\n\r\nDragon Reskins: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9888\r\nDragon Auras: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9815 \r\nOrcish armor color fix: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10720 \r\nSnow Retex: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11063",
