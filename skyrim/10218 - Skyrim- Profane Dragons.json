  "summary": "Make the dragons cuss up a storm!",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod replaces most of the dragon roars and growls with senseless profanity. The inspiration came from an Amnesia mod that changed the monsters\\' sound effects with that of a guy screaming at his cats.\r\n\r\n==Installation==\r\nSimple. Copy and paste the sound file into your Data files directory (or the files in the Sound file, if you already have the Sound file.) Then booya, installed dragon cussing mod.\r\n\r\n==Credits==\r\nObviously I can\\'t take credit for everything. So I feel obligated to give credit to:\r\n-The guy cussing at his cats: Provided one heck of a funny (and perfect) video for sound effects.\r\n-Blue2Scripter: I do believe this is the original person who ripped the sound effects for Amnesia. Many thanks for those glorious sound effects. =D\r\n\r\n\r\n==Modding==\r\nIf you want to modify this, go for it. Please let me know about it obviously over a PM because I\\'d like to know about it. Credit... eh, give it if you want.",
