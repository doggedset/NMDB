  "descriptionHtml": "[size=32][u][b]Afheim Hall[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=20]By: Ironlion45[/size]\r\n\r\nVersion: 1.05\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Description:[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nAlheim Hall is a player home designed according to a philosophy of being lore-friendly, immersion-friendly, and natural-feeling.  It is a large, complete player home, but not too huge, with plenty of storage and display options that are integrated in a natural, realistic way. \r\n\r\nThis house seeks to be a large, manner-esque house, with a somewhat rustic feel. I also wanted to avoid making it too overpowered.  There aren\\'t any cheat items inside, though there are a few loot goodies and easter eggs.  \r\n\r\n[b][u]Setting:[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nAlfheim Hall was once the home of a prosperous land owner and cattle magnate.  Something dreadful seems to have happened to him, as you will discover when encountering his journal outside the building.  The journal should provide clues about where a key to the manor might be.  \r\n\r\n[b][u]Installation and Removal:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nSimply copy the file alfheim.esp to your /Data folder in Skyrim\\'s directory. \r\n\r\nTo uninstall, after saving the game outside of the house and it\\'s cell, simply delete the esp.  \r\n\r\nI recommend that you use the fixes listed in the \\\"Known Issues and Fixes\\\" section.\r\n\r\n[b][u]How to Use This Mod:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nAlfheim Hall can be found on your mini-map, located in the hinterland Northwest of Whiterun (not far from the gates).\r\n\r\nto gain access to the house, either perform the mini-quest indicated by the former occupant\\'s diary, or just hit \\\"~\\\" to open the console and type \\\"coc alfheim\\\" to get inside.  A key to the front door will be on a desk.  \r\n\r\nIn either case, entering the house could be dangerous for a low-level character (hint, hint). \r\n\r\n[b][u]Mod Features:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n-A spacious, but not ridiculously overpowered, player home worthy of the Dragonborn!\r\n-Complete crafting facilities (smelter is outside because of the smoke).\r\n-Four weapon display cases.\r\n-Four Dagger display cases.\r\n-Two large and one small weapon rack.\r\n-Five interactive bookshelves to store a maximum of 240 books.\r\n-Five Armor Dummies placed in aesthetically pleasing locations around the house.\r\n-Several weapon plaques and weapon/shield plaques.\r\n-Fully decorated including clutter, with high attention to detail.\r\n-Companion quarters for users of the UFO mod (see below)\r\n-A Small vegetable garden, a modest flower bed, and a mushroom patch.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Recommended Mods:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nUltimate Follower Overhaul ---> Allows multiple followers and the ability to let followers relax inside the home.\r\nSpouses Can Live Anywhere ---> You want to take your significant other with you, right?\r\nFXAA Post Process Injector ---> Stunning visual enhancement with little to no performance hit.  Alfheim really looks best with it. \r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17817]Markarth Plus - Trees and Ruins[/url]  The best visual enhancement of Markarth out there, with this mod the city looks great.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Known Issues and Fixes:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[b]1) Grass is floating in midair around the house[/b]\r\n\r\nThis is a bug with Skyrim itself, but is resolved with the following fix:\r\n\r\nOpen up both Skyrim.ini and SkyrimPrefs.ini and at the bottom of the [Grass] section add/alter this:\r\n\r\nbAllowLoadGrass=0\r\nbAllowCreateGrass=1\r\nbDrawShaderGrass=1\r\n\r\n[b]2) My followers are just standing there[/b]\r\n\r\nThis is due to the infamous navmesh bug.  However, the latest beta patch actually fixes this (and adds cool mounted combat!).  So if you want the followers to wander the house, just opt-in for the latest beta patch on steam. \r\n\r\nAlternatively: save, quit, restart the game.  The navmesh will work again until you leave the interior and return.  \r\n\r\n[b][u]Release History:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n1.05 6/1/2012\r\n-Errant tanning rack re-added to workshop\r\n\r\nv1.04 1/6/2012\r\n\r\n-Fixed errant rotation of an interior section introduced in 1.03\r\n\r\nv1.03 31/5/2012\r\n\r\n-Caulked some gaps between the floorboards\r\n\r\nv1.02 31/5/2012\r\n\r\n-tweaked weapon plaques to make them easier to use\r\n-made the master bed player-owned\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.01 28/5/2012\r\n\r\n-First released version\r\n\r\n[b][u]Special Thanks To:[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nAmaunator_the_Revealer, for being my guinea pig\r\nBethesda, for this amazing game\r\nAll of you for your support and encouragement",
