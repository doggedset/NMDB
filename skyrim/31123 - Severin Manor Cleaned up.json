  "descriptionHtml": "My first ever mod! Have you ever thought that Bethesda has a thing for Barrels and haystacks? Ever wondered why your house in Raven Rock looks like a barn? With this mod your new house in Raven rock has been un-cluttered and moved around . Barrels and haystacks, Large sacks and pots are all removed. Also the weapon racks and mannequins have been re-positioned. 4 new mannequins have been added/ \r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress.\r\n\r\nThis is also my first Mod so there WILL be bugs. I will try to hammer these all out but my modding experience is shallow.\r\n\r\nKnown errors\r\n\r\nMannequins moving about = leave and re-enter house.\r\n\r\nLighting = Working on it (Think of it as an energy-saving option for your rooms)\r\nAny others = Let me know.\r\n\r\nFuture plans = \r\nMore mannequins.\r\nMore weapon racks.\r\nMore rooms.\r\nFollowers.\r\nI am open to suggestions. \r\n\r\nThanks for having a look !\r\n\r\nDisclaimer = Do  what you want with this but Add my name to your version. \r\n",
