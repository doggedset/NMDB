  "descriptionHtml": "***REQUIRES USKP***\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\"Silver weapons are especially effective against ghosts, the undead and werewolves.\\\\\\\"\r\n\r\n- Loadscreen text\r\n\r\nThe Unofficial Skyrim Patch changes one particular loadscreen, taking into account the presence of werebears in the Dawnguard expansion. The new loadscreen says \\\\\\\"lycanthropes\\\\\\\" - a more general term is just what we\\\\\\'re crying out for, right?\r\n\r\nWhat can I say? I\\\\\\'m capable of being psychotically anal about this kind of thing. Lycanthrope means \\\\\\\"wolfman\\\\\\\" - so it isn\\\\\\'t a more general term at all. Besides, I\\\\\\'m not wild about Greek roots in a Nordic-themed mystical fantasy game.\r\n\r\nSo I changed it. To wereforms. And now I can sleep at night, and so should you.\r\n\r\n==COMPATIBILITY==\r\nShould be compatible with everything. Just make sure to load after the USKP.\r\n\r\n==WARNING==\r\nIf you haven\\\\\\'t got the Unofficial Skyrim Patch:\r\n\r\n1. Don\\\\\\'t use this, it\\\\\\'ll crash your game\r\n2. What the hell is wrong with you?\r\n\r\n==UNINSTALLATION==\r\nJust delete lickawhatnow.esp or deactivate it in your mod manager.",
