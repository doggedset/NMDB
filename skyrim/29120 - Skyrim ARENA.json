  "descriptionHtml": "**************************************************************************************************************************************\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING !!!\r\n**************************************************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nSkyrim developers have already worked on the Arena and might be releasing it in a DLC in the future. If you have Creation Kit installed in your system, you\\'ll be able to see the Arena, it\\'s called the WindhelmPitWorldspace. In the game open the console and type \\\"coc windhelmpitentrance\\\" (without the quotes) and you will teleport to the vanilla Arena. However that Worldspace is not connected to Tamriel. So it\\'s a incomplete structure. I hope they release the Arena DLC soon.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, many of us modders have tried to simulate the Morrowind or Cyrodiil Arena through our mods; I have also taken a venture.\r\n\r\nMY MOD IS INCOMPLETE. I want to do the following things in my mod-\r\n1. Scripted fights\r\n2. Single one-on-one fights (Player vs scripted Opponents)\r\n3. Group fights (your Combatant group vs Opponent group)\r\n4. Wager on fights (a betting system)\r\n5. A rank system to climb up the Arena ladder ending in a fight to become the Grand Champion\r\n6. NPCs like Owyn in Oblivion to make DialogueViews\r\n7. Blacksmith, Apothecary, Spell Merchants, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you play my mod, you\\'ll see that I\\'ve already created the Arena Bloodworks. I\\'ve also created a Blacksmith forge, some stalls, a bar, etc inside the Bloodworks. And I\\'m SURE I\\'ll be able to complete the mod.\r\n\r\nI\\'m uploading this incomplete file because, scripting takes a hell lot of time, testing is even more frustrating. I want to get some support from the nexus users, and by \\'support\\', I mean Endorsements. If I see that my mod is gaining interest then I\\'ll proceed with the mod. Otherwise it will be total waste of my time.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the mod.",
