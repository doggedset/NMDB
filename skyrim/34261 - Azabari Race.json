  "descriptionHtml": "AZABARI\r\n \r\nLore\r\n \r\nThe Azabari are the people of a small lost village somewhere in the deserts of Elsweyr. Their community was established many years ago when a mixed group of explorers, both Nord and Redguard, were scouring the desert in search of a mythical treasure said to buried somewhere nearby. The group set up camp in the desert, but they ended up staying much longer than they planned. Generations passed and people continued to live there. After a few hundred years the Azabari gave up on their ancestor\\'s goals. They couldn\\'t even remember what they were searching for. Many of them disbanded all over Tamriel after this. Few people remained in their village in Elsweyr. \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nDescription\r\n \r\nThis mod adds a new, lore-friendly, playable race to the world of Skyrim. Having livved in the hot desert for hundreds of years, the Azabari adapted to the climate, and now they boast a high fire resistance because of it. The Azabari are also really good blacksmiths and excellent warriors. Their highest skills are Smithing, One-Handed, Block, and Light Armor, as well as destruction magic, though it has only one purpose in their society.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThe Azabari may not be very good mages, but there is one spell they\\'ve perfected. While most powers are used in the same method of a shout, the Azabari has a spell. Once a day they can summon a powerful blast of flames to incinerate their foes.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nFeatures\r\n \r\nThis custom race has;\r\n ?+10 One-Handed\r\n ?+10 Smithing\r\n ?+5 Block\r\n ?+5 Light Armor\r\n ?+5 Destruction\r\n ?A Powerful Spell\r\n ?+35% Fire Resistance and 10% Frost Resistance\r\n \r\nIt is compatable with any mods that affect Nords. For instance, the Apachii hair mod affects the Nords, so it also affects the Azabari (As Evident in Screenshots).\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nMod Reviews\r\n None. Feel free to make one.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nInstallation\r\n \r\nTo install, simply extract the plug-in into your Skyrim data folder. NMM and similar programs should be able to install this, but if you wish to install it manually, the folder locations are as written below;\r\n \r\nIf Skyrim is not installed through Steam, your skyrim directory should be;\r\n C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\\\\Data (If using a 64x Windows OS)\r\n C:\\\\Program Files\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\\\\Data (If using a 32x Windows OS)\r\n If Skyrim is installed through Steam, your Skyrim directory should be;\r\n C:\\\\Games\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim",
