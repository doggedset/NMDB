NOW THE SAME AS SSE![/size]<br />[/color][/b]<br />[font=Palatino Linotype][size=3][size=3][b]Say hello to Professor Benjamin Doon, the one and only elderly male follower. He is quite possibly the most irritating and cantankerous old goat you'll ever likely to meet. Tempted? You should be.[/b]<br /><br />[youtube]2ypGD_83vYA[/youtube][/size][/size][/font]<br />[size=2][/size][color=#ffd966][youtube]4Ok0sja7nsA[/youtube]<br /><br />[size=3]Question:[/size][/color][color=#efefef][size=3][b] [/b][i]Why would anyone on the nexus like to have an elderly male follower?[/i][/size][/color]<br /><br />[color=#ffd966][size=3]Answer: [/size][/color][i][size=3]If it's okay for Luke Skywalker, then it should be okay for you.[/size]<br />[/i]<br />[size=3][i]Yes, say goodbye to all those scantily clad female companions with no back story and the slim possibility of romance, and say hello to Benjamin Doon, whom admittedly really just complains a lot. But hey, at least its different. Go on, give him a try. You'll probably regret it, but at least you'll be able to stand among friends and say that \"you are really trying.....\"[/i][/size]<br /><br />[color=#ffd966]You want this mod. Why?[/color]<br /><br />[color=#6d9eeb][b]Firstly:[/b][/color][size=2] Because its fun and will distract you from your otherwise bizarre obsession with rubber bands that make bracelets..[/size]<br /><br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Thirdly[/b][/color][size=2], hey what happened to secondly?[/size]<br /><br />[b][color=#6fa8dc]Fourthly[/color][/b][size=2]. It's okay, I found [/size][color=#6d9eeb][b]Secondly[/b][/color][size=2] hiding in the shrubbery. Apparently it thought that if you couldn't see it, then it couldn't see you. Clearly its delusional.[/size]<br /><br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Fifthly[/b][/color][size=2], gosh, how did we get so far ahead?[/size]<br /><br />[b][color=#6fa8dc]Sixley[/color][/b][size=2], oh come on there's no such word! Get on with it.[/size]<br /><br />[color=#6fa8dc][b]Secondly[/b][/color][size=2]. How predictable, I'm always ignored.[/size]<br /><br /><br />[size=3][b][color=#ffd966]Who is Benjamin?[/color] [/b]<br /><br />Benjamin is a some what bitter sweet old Story Bard whom currently resides at Solitude Bards College. The only problem is, he can't stand them! Aside from his dislike of people in general, he considers himself as \"actually quite fun to be around\". Think Oscar Wild meets Uncle Monty from Withnail &amp; I, and you may just get him.[/size]<br /><br />[size=3][color=#c27ba0]Ability:[/color] In a fight, Ben is fairly nifty for his age. Also, if you ask him nicely, he may read you the odd book or two. Fully voiced with over 1300 unique and annoying lines of dialogue[/size]<br /><br />[size=3][color=#c27ba0]Likes:[/color] pubs, idiots and a good book.[/size]<br /><br />[size=3][color=#c27ba0]Hates:[/color] bards, idiots and you quite possibly.[/size]<br /><br />[size=3]Ben can be found upstairs in the Bards College in Solitude. [/size]<br /><br /><br />[size=3][b][color=#ffd966]What's new in Version Two[/color][/b] (oh, that rhymed)<br /><br />[/size][list][*][size=3]Over 1300 lines of annoying dialogue.[/size][/*]<br />[*][size=3]A Quest that is mind-bogglingly easy and yet hard.[/size][/*]<br />[*][size=3]30 books for Ben to read for you.[/size][/*]<br />[*][size=3]And Absolutely nothing worthwhile like New spells, shouts or equipment (not true with 2.2).[/size]<br />[/*][/list][size=3]<br />Additional 2.2:<br />[list][*][size=3]Ben is Standalone (meaning you can have more than one follower)[/size][/*]<br />[*][size=3]A brand new weapon compliments of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58523/?]Darren83[/url] (see video in comments section)[/size][/*]<br />[*][size=3]Ben has been tweaked to be a little less over powering.[/size][/*]<br />[*][size=3]Tweaked a bit of his dialogue to be even more area aware.[/size][/*]<br />[/list][/size]<br /><br />[b][color=#00ffff]S[size=3]o what's new? Okay tell me now..[/size][/color][/b][size=3]<br /><br />[i]Okay, calm down my fine furry friend. Ben has been revamped from the ground up whilst still remaining true to his original character. [/i]<br /><br />[color=#00ffff][b]Great! What does that add?[/b][/color]<br /><br />[i]Basically I've added a bit more dialogue.[/i]<br /><br />[color=#00ffff][b]Is that it? [/b][/color]<br /><br />[i]Erm, no! I've added a quest too.<br />[/i]<br />[color=#00ffff][b]Oh okay, a quest. So what does that add?[/b][/color]<br /><br />[i]Erm, a bit more dialogue. Hey, but its funny![/i]<br /><br />[b][color=#00ffff]Listen, Trainwiz is funny, I know my funny mate. Why should I even humour you?[/color][/b]<br /><br />[i]Humour you? Oh, I see what you did there. Very good. Well, in my defence, I think its funny. Just my opinion.<br />[/i]<br />[b][color=#00ffff]Ha! Your opinion is but a drop in the ocean on the Nexus mate. Don't try and sell me your inferior product![/color][/b][/size]<br /><br />[i][size=3]Sell you?! Hang on a sec, firstly, like all mods here, this ,although painstakingly crafted, is free. Secondly, everyone has the right to dream, to be part of something important. I stand my ground. Everyone can make mods! No matter how big, small or insubstantial. Whether it be a mod the adds shoes or a mod that increases the size of an NPC's bust. All mods are welcome![/size]<br /><br />[size=3]There I said it. You can take your elitist Nexus snobbery and stick it. This is a funny mod![/size][/i]<br /><br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=3]Is it female?[/size]<br />[/color][/b]<br />[size=3]...give me strength.[/size]<br /><br />[b][size=4]<br /><br />[color=#f6b26b]THE REAL READ<br /><br />[/color][/size][/b][size=3][b][color=#ffd966]COMPATIBILITY [b][color=#ff0000]PLEASE READ!!! [/color][/b][/color][/b][/size]<br /><br />[size=3][color=#f4f4f4]Ben has been tested to work alongside [b][color=#3c78d8]Alternative Start -[/color][/b][/color][b][color=#3c78d8]Live Another Life [/color][/b]and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?]Amazing Follower Tweaks[/url]<br /><br />Note: The latest version is now the same as the SSE version. All bugs have finally been ironed out!<br /><br />However, If you do note any other bugs, Please let me know of any issues in the comments section<br /><br />Thanks[/size]<br />[color=#ffd966][size=3][b]<br />First time Installation[/b][/size][/color]<br />[size=3]<br />[i]Oh Cmon, do you need me to tell you?. You are a veteran gamer.. you've beaten all kinds of games..although, let's face it, your Flappy Bird score makes you blush whenever your 9yr old nephew enters the room... [/i][/size][i][size=3]Well okay then...if you insist.[/size][/i]<br />[size=3]<br />[list][*][size=3]To Install use [b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager/?]Nexus Mod Manager[/url][/b] or the swanky new [b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/?]Mod Organizer[/url][/b] and put the kettle on whilst they perform their magic. Or if you prefer just manually install. The latter probably won't allow you to put the kettle on, so choose wisely if you're particularly thirsty.[/size]<br />[/*][*][size=3]Un-install as above with the same kettle options.[/size]<br />[/*][/list][/size][size=3]<br />[b][color=#ffd966]Updating<br /><br />[/color][/b][/size][color=#ff0000][b]NOTE: LATEST VERSION IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ESP! BE SURE TO UNINSTALL ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS![/b][/color]<br />[size=3]<br />Quests use little things called \"quest aliases\" which really go wrong if you aren't using a clean save. So because this update features lots of aliases, you will have to install cleanly. <br />[/size]<br />[size=3]1. Load up your save with Ben, nick all the good loot of him and dismiss him.[/size]<br />[size=3]2. Move to a new location (cell) where Ben isn't and save your game.[/size]<br />[size=3]4. Quit Skyrim and un-install Ben V1[/size]<br />[size=3]5. Start up game again, Load your save, it will complain, but once loaded, save again.[/size]<br />[size=3]6. Quit game and install Ben V2.[/size]<br />[size=3]7. Load your game, and then head back to the bards college in solitude. Hopefully Ben should be there waiting to begin a new and exciting adventure with you.<br /><br />[b][color=#ffd966]Uninstall<br /><br />[/color][/b]Walk away and pretend it never happened...<br />Or just use your mod manager<br /><br /><br />[/size]<br />[size=3][b][color=#ffd966]About Ben's Quest.[/color][/b]<br /><br />[color=#6d9eeb]If you're reading this far, you are a thorough and beautiful being and therefore deserve success in life[/color] [/size]<br /><br />[size=3]This isn't a quest as such, it doesn't require you to do any running around, battling monkeys or creeping around a darkened back passage. Quite simply its randomly triggered by certain insignificant actions. [/size][size=3]Your actions will eventually affect Ben's personality. [/size][size=3]There are 4 stages to him:[/size]<br />[size=3]<br />[list][*][size=3]Jolly[/size]<br />[/*][*][size=3]Grumpy[/size]<br />[/*][*][size=3]Dark[/size]<br />[/*][*][size=3]Contented.[/size]<br />[/*][/list][/size][size=3]<br />The quest will also unlock or remove certain book readings along the way.[/size]<br /><br />[size=3]All stages are triggered by random activities which hopefully will be a real bugger for you to find. All I can say, is that when you're not distracted my your mindless hacking and slashing, listen to Ben. He will give you clues...[/size]<br />[size=3]Okay, that's just annoying. I'll give you the first one...<br /><br />Ben likes a drink.[/size]<br />[size=3]<br />[b][color=#ffd966]About making this mod[/color][/b][/size]<br />[size=3]<br />Ben is really just a character from my [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwCQFBMFwCY]Carry On Skyrim[/url] quest mod. I just thought he would actually make a rather entertaining follower, and so after reading Deck 16's marvellous [url=http://deck16.net/post/22645519500/making-a-unique-voiced-follower-in-skyrim-part-1]tutorial[/url], I put him out there fairly quickly. Given the amount of positive feedback and also because follower mods are becoming more fashionable, I thought that it would be prudent to Update him before proceeding further on with the Carry On Skyrim quest mod. He is after all the only thing I've produced thus far, and you never know, I may be hit by a bus tomorrow and never complete my quest mod.. [/size][size=3]I really hope you don't drive a bus for a living![/size]<br />[color=#ffd966][size=3]<br />About me.[/size][/color]<br />[size=3]<br />I have been playing Elder Scrolls for a fairly long time (hmm, Morrowind). Since the release of Skyrim I have enjoyed so many brilliant mods made by people far cleverer than I, and it never crossed my mind to try and make a mod myself until I had a very silly idea, Me? Make a mod?.. <br /><br />But here's the thing, as I discovered for myself, anyone can make a mod if they really want. All it takes is an idea and perseverance. Inspired? I hope so. However, when you do get that idea, I can recommend no better place to help you on your way than here on the nexus. The nexus forums are full of wonderful people whom are always willing to lend their experience and expertise. All you need to do is ask (just do it politely). Personally I'd like to thank all those who helped this struggling half wit with his irritating and persistent questions.[/size]<br />[size=3]<br />Additional.<br /><br />It took a little effort to update Ben as a Standalone Follower and I couldn't have done it without the help of others. You can read all about our efforts [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/2191799-creation-kit-follower-avoiding-conflicts/]here[/url] and theres a nice tutorial [url=http://skyrimmw.weebly.com/skyrim-modding/setting-up-a-custom-follower-framework-skyrim-modding-tutorial]here[/url]<br />If you do manage to get through to the end of our discussion, you'll note that I promised that I would upload the source to all of Ben's scripts. This I have done. I hope that this helps any whom are looking to make their own follower.<br /><br />Of course, if it does., don't forget to say thanks to all involved.<br /><br />Personally I'd like to say a Special thanks to [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/4995004-matthiaswagg/]Matthiaswagg[/url], [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/1730967-caithe/]Caithe[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58523/?]Darren83[/url], Mofakin and bojanni.<br /><br />Also like to say cheers to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58720/?]Terso[/url]. Thankyou for your continual nagging. Sometimes we need to be pushed;)<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/274/274-1505685822-728179196.gif[/img]<br />               [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/skinnytecboy/][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/274/274-1505684910-1372045995.gif[/img][/url]   [/size][b][color=#76a5af][url=https://twitter.com/SkinnytecboyMA][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/274/274-1505684920-360961828.gif[/img][/url] [/color][/b]   [url=https://www.facebook.com/SkinnytecboyMods-296403687448100/][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/274/274-1505684876-775272578.gif[/img][/url][size=3]<br />[/size][size=3]<br /><br />[color=#ffff00]MY OTHER MODS:[/color]<br /><br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61016/?]Carry On Skyrim: M.H.A.R.P.H.I.N.<br /><br />[/url][b][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65427/?]Carry On Skyrim: Another Free Follow[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65427/?]er<br /><br />[/url][url=https://www.paypal.me/skinnytecboy][size=3][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/274/274-1505684863-1097204249.gif[/img]<br />[/size][color=#ffd966]It's always nice to receive kind words or an endorsement and it's equally nice to receive donations.
