I tested this pretty thoroughly, so there shouldnt be any leftover items that show up even with this installed. Note that I did add Lorecraft book requirement for Dawnguard\\'s crossbows, but I did not place them anywhere in the world (they are random drops) and they still have vanilla requirements as well.\r\n\r\nInstalation instructions:\r\nUse NMM and make sure that this plugin is loaded after core Lorecraft.\r\n\r\n",
