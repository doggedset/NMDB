  "summary": "119 separate batch files that range from things like mass skill leveling to acquiring all non quest-related words of power or spells; vampire lord and werewolf abilities, food and drink, ingredients, human/monster/dragon spawning or weapons for disenchanting. Also included are scaled-down, non over-powered files.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#FFD700][size=15]What Is This...?[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />[center]This is not really a &#34;mod&#34; in the conventional sense... it is a rather large compilation of [i]batch files[/i] that I made myself. Batch files are nothing more than simple .txt documents that you may use in the game to execute hundreds of console commands at once. They can have very powerful effects on your game and can speed up gaming considerably. [/center]\r<br />I have [size=3][b]119[/b][/size] separate batch files that I cobbled together myself. Initially this started out as just something I did in my spare time for my own game play, but then it evolved and I decided to publish it in a mod. All you have to do is click download (Nexus Mod Manager really IS preferred, but you can do it manually if you choose), and everything I have is located in one simple file called &#34;BFG&#34;. Located C:Program Files (x86)Steam--&gt;steamapps--&gt;common--&gt;Skyrim--&gt;Data\r<br />\r<br />Included in &#34;BFG&#34;, are all the files, as well as a couple word documents that organize everything alphabetically. You may print these off if you like, that&#39;s what they&#39;re for. No other work is required. In-game, simply punch [color=#FF0000][b][size=3]bat &#34;BFG/FILENAME&#34;[/size][/b][/color] --with quotes and slash, into the console and the file will be activated.\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[size=3][b]Note: I regret to say that I am officially done batching. This was fun and I had hoped to continue to make more but sadly life has gotten busy and there is just no time anymore. Thank you to everyone who&#39;s shown love; I appreciate all the endorsements. I give full permission to anyone who wants to take my batches and include them in their own content. SEE YOU ALL WHEN THE ELDER SCROLLS 6 COMES OUT&#33; Happy gaming&#33;~[/b][/size]\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#000080][size=20]So what does this batch file mod offer?[/size]\r<br />[size=10]Everything.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#008080][size=2]Well, almost.[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFA500][size=5][b]Here&#39;s the breakdown:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]Contains a printable Microsoft Word document that categorizes and contains a description for each batch file contained in this mod.\r<br />[/list][list][*]Contains a printable list of QUEST ID&#39;S that can be used in conjunction with the console command:  player.movetoqt QUESTID (This will essentially teleport you to the next quest marker)\r<br />[/list][list][*]Full support for both Nexus Mod Manager installation and Manual Installation.\r<br />[/list][list][*]Weapons and armor of most varieties for each faction, alloy, type, category, and player archetype.\r<br />[/list][list][*]One enchanted item from each magic-effect type that may be disenchanted at an Arcane Altar.\r<br />[/list][list][*]One of each ingredient to eat and learn the effects from--or hundreds of them&#33; Your choice&#33;\r<br />[/list][list][*]Any item ever possibly needed for normal gameplay: ingredients, building materials, smithing materials, food and drink, dragon priest masks, arcane clothing and equipment, gems and coins and flowers and body parts, ...[i]sweetrolls[/i]?

Most of my batches are capable of running even with a [b]heavily[/b] modded game; just keep in mind that if you spawn tons of items in one location, for example, you&#39;ll likely crash it.  ;-) [/center][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#FF0000][size=15]Will this sh*t break my game?&#33;[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=20][color=#000000][b][u]No[/u][/b][/color][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Many of my batch file effects are either temporary or completely reversible and [size=5][b][u]all[/u][/b][/size] have been carefully crafted so as not to risk breaking any quest lines or game saves. [size=5][b][u]Nothing[/u][/b][/size] has been recklessly added that will corrupt your game and I use them myself on all my playthroughs. \r<br />\r<br />[i]So I urge you all to download the file and see if you like them&#33;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=10][color=black][b]---Installation---[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Recommended:[/b]  \r<br />Use Nexus Mod Manager to install. Folder will appear in DATA as &#34;BFG&#34;. No other work is needed. To use in-game, type [color=#FF0000][b][size=3]bat &#34;BFG/FILENAME&#34;[/size][/b][/color]  --Use quotes.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]If downloading manually:[/b]\r<br />Download the zip file, extract with Z-Zip, and read the text document in the README file entitled, &#34;Manual Download Special Instructions&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=10][color=black][b]---Uninstallation---[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]With Mod Manager:[/b] Uninstall from Nexus Mod Manager. \r<br />[list][*][i]Done and done. All files will be cleanly removed.[/i]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b]Manual:[/b] In Program Files (x86)--&gt;Steam--&gt;Steamapps--&gt;Common--&gt;Skyrim folder, highlight all of my .txt files [as of version 2.5, all manual version batch files will start with the letters &#34;BFG&#34;] and then delete the files from your folder. \r<br />[list][*][i]Note: As of version 2.5, I now have a fully-supported Manual Version. All files in this version will begin with the letters &#34;BFG&#34;. This ensures that they may easily be searched for and removed from the Skyrim folder with minimal effort or risk. By using the manual download option, however, you will not be alerted to any changes or updates in the mod as you would be with Nexus Mod Manager installed.[/i]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[size=6]\r<br />[/size][center][color=#cc0000][u][b][size=6]THIS PART IS VERY IMPORTANT&#33;[/size][/b][/u][/color]\r<br />Seriously they won&#39;t work without it[/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />All my batch files are based on only the original version of Skyrim plus the three official plug-ins released: DG (Dawnguard), HF (Hearthfire), and DB (Dragonborn). No custom mods or content included.\r<br />\r<br />Please note: The only prerequisite to using these batch files effectively is that your official plug-ins or expansions are listed first and in this order:\r<br />[b]1)SKYRIM (Obviously)\r<br />2)UPDATE (Bethesda Update; doesn&#39;t affect the load order in-game but should be right below Skyrim)\r<br />3)DAWNGUARD\r<br />4)HEARTHFIRES\r<br />5)DRAGONBORN[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Any custom content you have installed won&#39;t matter, so long as it&#39;s placed after DRAGONBORN in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re missing one of the official plug-ins a lot of these will still work but batch files such as &#34;ingredients&#34; or &#34;BrotherhoodOfTheMoon&#34; will partially fail if the item/perk codes are not executed in the proper order. No negative impact on saved game integrity, but you&#39;ll only get part or none of the batch file&#39;s effects. For example, you can&#39;t get DRAGONBORN ingredients if you don&#39;t have DRAGONBORN installed, or it&#39;s in the wrong order. The vanilla Skyrim ingredients will still work, but you&#39;ll get error messages for the rest. I&#39;ve noted all the files with a &#34;DG/HF/DB&#34; to indicate which of these files are affected by the order of expansion packs. THESE ARE NOTATIONS ONLY&#33; Don&#39;t include them in the console command. I&#39;ve excluded them from the quotations for this reason.\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][color=#000000][size=4][color=#ff0000][b]If you&#39;re using any of [size=5][u]The Unofficial Patches[/u][/size], place them all below Dragonborn[/b][/color] (or whatever your last official expansion is) in your load order. [i]Programs like BOSS or LOOT may try to place The Unofficial Patches directly underneath their associated expansions[/i], but if you do not correct this then my batch files simply will not work. Placing The Unofficial Patches below all of the expansions should have little impact. [color=#ff0000]The patches should still be effective. [color=#000000]If someone finds that this is not the case, drop me a comment and I&#39;ll consider publishing a USKP version to accommodate load orders.[/color]\r<br />[/color][/size][/color]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#000000][b]DISCLAIMER:[/b] Using batch files is exactly the same as executing hundreds of console commands&#33; Console commands have a potential to corrupt questlines, screw up saved games, or do otherwise really funky stuff. Make backups of all your saves before using&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve done my best to restrict and minimize the game-crushing cheats like the &#34;WordsOfPower&#34; batch file and &#34;Grandmaster&#34; batch file, each awarding shouts and spells, respectively.[/color][/size] \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I also encourage everyone to visit the &#34;qasmoke&#34; cell--which is Skyrim&#39;s tester cell and has virtually every single item in the game in there. Simply punch in the console &#34;player.coc qasmoke&#34; to get there and something like &#34;player.coc riverwood&#34; to get out.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve also included in my README file a method for making your own batch files in case there are people out there just starting to play Skyrim or otherwise don&#39;t know how.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />For NMM DOWNLOADS: To execute in-game, type: [color=#FF0000][size=4][b]bat &#34;BFG/FILENAME&#34;[/b][/size][/color]   \r<br />For MANUAL DOWNLOADS: To execute in-game, type [color=#ff0000][size=4][b]bat FILENAME[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />---&gt;Swap out the FILENAME part with the actual file&#39;s name\r<br />---&gt;Include quotes and slash for NMM DOWNLOAD version\r<br />\r<br />[color=##000000]Example of using these files in-game; bring up the console command and type in:\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Nexus Mod Manager Installation[/size][/b]\r<br />[list][b][size=3][*]bat &#34;BFG/Grandmaster&#34;\r<br />[*]bat &#34;BFG/CriminalImmunity&#34;\r<br />[/size][/b][*][b][size=3]bat &#34;BFG/DragonsToFight&#34;[/size][/b]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b][size=4]Manual Installation[/size][/b]\r<br />[list][b][size=3][*]bat BFGGrandmaster\r<br />[*]bat BFGCriminalImmunity\r<br />[/size][/b][*][b][size=3]bat BFGDragonsToFight[/size][/b]\r<br />[/list][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][i][color=#000000][size=30]DON&#39;T FORGET TO ENDORSE IF YOU LIKE&#33;&#33;&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=15]It may just be a simple mod to you, but I put a lot of work into it and had an intense focus on functionality and detail for the benefit of others, not my own.\r<br />\r<br />My thanks to those who have already endorsed.
