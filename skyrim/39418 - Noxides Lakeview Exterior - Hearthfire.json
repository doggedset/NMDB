They are very simple. They cannot be followers and you cannot marry them. There are plenty of those mods available, so I\r<br />didn&#39;t bother.\r<br />They will just patrol around the house and in their &#34;chill&#34; time they will either sleep or sit around the pool.\r<br />Armor wise they just wear a modified version of the Whiterun Guard Armor. It&#39;s blue and they do not have shields. \r<br />Between the four of them they carry a bow, a mace, a longsword and a normal sword. All ebony. \r<br />When there are unwanted guests they will attack. They are essential so they are quite tough.\r<br /> \r<br />[u][b]You need the main file (Lakeview Gardens) installed for this to work.  [/b][/u] \r<br />To install, copy the contents of the Guardhouse zip to your data folder. Overwrite the esp.\r<br />You should only use one esp. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />                                                  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\r<br />\r<br />[b]Quick Update 2013/09/01[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve uploaded an esp that takes away the quarry, as for some reason it&#39;s started to show up for some users. This changes nothing except take away the quarry completely. (Pickaxe and loose stones included)\r<br />[b]If you don&#39;t have issues with the quarry, you do not need this.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][font=georgia,serif][size=8][color=#008000]V2.0 Update Lakeview Gardens[/color][/size][/font][/b][/center]\r<br />[center] [/center]\r<br />\r<br />Firstly, the name change is purely to avoid confusion. It is an updated version of Lakeview Exterior, which is now considered the old version.\r<br />If you have Lakeview Exterior and you want to use this one, please delete the old bsa and esp and use the bsa and esp from V2.0\r<br />For installation, see below.\r<br /> \r<br /> \r<br />This version was started from scratch, after it was pointed out that there were issues with lumber-buying quests and stewards stripping and running into the animal pen and milking the horse.\r<br />Thank you to Darknite and Torneach for pointing a finger at me and shaking their heads. \r<br /> \r<br />The lumber issue has been resolved. You can now buy lumber as intended without any trouble. I moved the pile to the other side of the manor wall. Feel free to disable it if it&#39;s in your way. It shouldn&#39;t be. Outa sight, outa mind. \r<br /> \r<br />The clay deposits have been removed. As has the quarry. (There is a quarry a few meters away at Pinewatch)\r<br />Drusilla will sell you clay if you are really too lazy to find a different clay mine.\r<br />\r<br />[LIST]\r<br />[*]Lakeview Underground is bigger. So is the jacuzzi. The layout is pretty much the same though. I added two mannequins and some towels. [/*]\r<br />[*]I replaced the lights with Japanese lamps. It&#39;s not lore-friendly, I know, but it doesn&#39;t look out of place. [/*]\r<br />[*]Drusilla has had a bit of a makeover. She is prettier (in my opinion anyway) and the issue with her gold not respawning has been fixed. I have tested this many times over. [/*]\r<br />[*]There are now two beds, so she has a choice. Spoiled brat.[/*]\r<br />[*]The pool outside is slightly bigger, but not much. [/*]\r<br />[*]Added some more plants[/*]\r<br />[*]Added torches to the two main entrances as well as lights (the same Japanese ones) to the two roads leading to the Manor.\r<br />These lights and torches will turn on at 18:00 in the evening and turn off at 06:00 in the morning. [/*]\r<br />[*]The grass is a different texture. It&#39;s more aesthetically pleasing than before. [/*]\r<br />[*]I removed the Necromancer Altar by the lake. Most mods that puts something different there should be compatible, but I am not 100 percent sure of this fact. [/*]\r<br />[/LIST]\r<br />The rest has remained pretty much unchanged. You&#39;ll notice the stream is a little different, and if you fall into the waterfall chasm you&#39;ll have to do some rock climbing to get out.\r<br /> \r<br />Let me know if you encounter any strangeness please. \r<br />Enjoy.\r<br /> \r<br />\r<br />[center][b][font=georgia,serif][size=8][color=#006400]Description[/color][/size][/font][/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This mod started out as a small play area for the children, took on a life of its own, and turned into a full blown remodel of Lakeview Manor&#39;s exterior.\r<br />This mod is not littered with clutter. You [i]won&#39;t[/i] find a 289 barrels and 436 miscellaneous sacks and 94 wallmounted goat heads. \r<br />It&#39;s called a manor. Manors have large open spaces. That was the idea behind this mod.\r<br />It was designed around  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37715//?]Lakeview Manor Interior[/url] , but any combination of rooms is compatible.\r<br />  \r<br />[center][b][font=georgia,serif][size=8][color=#008000]Features[/color][/size][/font][/b][/center]\r<br />[center] [/center]\r<br />\r<br />[LIST]\r<br />[*]Two actual walkways on the sides of the manor. No more falling off the cliff on one side and walking into the mountain on the other.[/*]\r<br />[*]A wall surrounding the entire property.[/*]\r<br />[*]A waterfall in the front yard surrounded by grass and plants and palm trees. A creek runs through the property wall (a grate, not the actual wall) and all the way down to the lake.[/*]\r<br />[*]The creek runs parallel to a low-walled road from the lake to the manor.[/*]\r<br />[*]A similar road leads up to the manor from the main road coming from Falkreath.[/*]\r<br />[*]A pool in the back with wooden decking. [/*]\r<br />[*]If you have children, they will sit with their feet in the water, lie on the deck, play some nice (silent) music for you on their drums and lutes.[/*]\r<br />[*]Also in the back is a gazebo and a small fire pit with chairs surrounding it. [/*]\r<br />[*]On the other side of the pool is a new building called Lakeview Underground. Nothing really fancy. It goes ... underground... into a bar. There is also a jacuzzi in there. [/*]\r<br />[*]Drusilla might not be the prettiest NPC in Skyrim ( I suck at creating them) but she will sell you a bunch of crap and you can also get rid of some of that junk you carry around. [/*]\r<br />[*]She works from 08:00 until 22:00 and then she will sleep in the little back room for a few hours.[/*]\r<br />[*]There are four weapon plaques and three Hearthfire Trophy pedestals.[/*]\r<br />[*]Plenty of markers to keep the NPC&#39;s occupied, including the Housecarl. You&#39;ll see her wandering outside the gates to make sure you and your family are safe.[/*]\r<br />[*]As mentioned, the kids will now sandbox in the back, and not in the front of the manor.[/*]\r<br />[*]The available chests and barrels are all set not to respawn, so you can safely store your loot in them[/*]\r<br />[/LIST]\r<br />[center][b][font=georgia,serif][size=8][color=#008000]Requirements[/color][/size][/font][/b][/center]\r<br />[center] [/center]\r<br />Hearthfire. \r<br /> \r<br />[center][b][size=8][color=#008000]Installation[/color][/size][/b][/center]\r<br />[center] [/center]\r<br /> \r<br />Copy the BSA and ESP into your Data folder. Or use NMM.\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#a52a2a][i]This is very important. Please read carefully and follow these steps even more carefully. [/i][/color]\r<br />I made massive changes to the landscape and if you don&#39;t follow these steps, your manor will be surrounded by weirdness. Floating grass being one of the culprits.\r<br />[LIST]\r<br />[*]If you have a spouse and / or kids, move them somewhere else first. Anywhere but Breezehome, as Breezehome is too close to Lakeview (I&#39;ve heard rumors that [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37229//?]Honeyside[/url] is quite a cool place )[/*]\r<br />[*]When they are all safe in the other house, quit the game.[/*]\r<br />[*]Start the game [color=#b22222]without my mod[/color][/*]\r<br />[*]Make a clean save (not a quicksave)[/*]\r<br />[*]Quit the game[/*]\r<br />[*]Start the game [i]with my mod [/i]loaded [/*]\r<br />[*]Make another clean save.[/*]\r<br />[*]Quit and start again.[/*]\r<br />[/LIST]\r<br />I know it&#39;s tedious but it&#39;s the only way. It could also be beneficial if you wait a day or two. Or fast travel to Volkihar and back a few times. It sounds stupid but this &#34;settles&#34; all the new stuff.\r<br /> \r<br />To uninstall, simply delete my BSA and ESP.\r<br /> \r<br /> \r<br />[center][font=georgia,serif][b][size=8][color=#008000]Compatibility[/color][/size][/b][/font][/center]\r<br />[center] [/center]\r<br />[center] [/center]\r<br />The road at the bottom, by the lake, clashes with Talos Island - Reborn. Thanks to Arkayn71 for pointing that out to me.\r<br />This mod will not be compatible with any other mod that does the same thing, in other words, no other exterior modification. I did not touch the Necro Altar at the bottom though, and I am using the fishing dock.\r<br />Any mod that changes the altar should be compatible.\r<br /> \r<br />[center] [/center]\r<br />[center][b][font=georgia,serif][size=8][color=#008000]Permissions & Credits[/color][/size][/font][/b][/center]\r<br />[center] [/center]\r<br />[center] [/center]\r<br />Feel free to change whatever you want, but please [color=#b22222]do not [/color]upload to other sites.

It doesn&#39;t matter what mod you make, it takes time and it takes effort and patience. Big up to all of you. Respect.[/*]\r<br />[*]Cipscis and M3rvin for the lighting scripts[/*]\r<br />[*]Tamira, your plants are awesome and I know we shouldn&#39;t ask, but can you animate them?[/*]\r<br />[*]Tamira (again)  and Walery Nowak [url=http://archive3d.net/?a=download&id=d6687cc7]Walery Nowak[/url] for the rocking horses.[/*]\r<br />[*]Stroti for his Rustic Furniture[/*]\r<br />[*]Insanity for the towels, lamps and rugs[/*]\r<br />[*]Gentester[/*]\r<br />[*]Artisanix for his Painting Frames meshes[/*]\r<br />[*]Oaristys & Tony67.
