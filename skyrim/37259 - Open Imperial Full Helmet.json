  "descriptionHtml": "This is a remodeled Imperial Full Helmet I made based on the original Bethesda meshes, because it annoyed me that I could not see my character&#39;s face while wearing one of the best looking helmets in the game. That said, this model lets you see your char&#39;s face behind the visor but leaves the general style untouched imo.\r<br />\r<br />This includes just meshes, no textures, so it should be compatible with every retexture mod.\r<br />.esp is required to change the equipment slot the helmet uses, so your head is not removed when you equip it.\r<br />\r<br />Argonian models are delayed until I have more time again. Thanks for your patience.\r<br />\r<br />Update 0.9.1\r<br />Khajiit added, but leads to problem with elven ears clipping through the helmet. So if you don&#39;t plan on using it on Khajiit, stay with v0.9. [s]There also seems to be an CTD issue, in this case revert to v0.9 untill I can fix this.[/s]\r<br />I could not reproduce the CTD, so i assume it&#39;s not from this mod (alone).\r<br />\r<br />v0.9\r<br />For now just the human/elven version, no Argonians and Khajiit. When wearing this helmet on an Argonian/Khajiit it will not be displayed (and your hair will vanish). I will add meshes for beastraces later on maybe.\r<br />\r<br />The textures in the ingame screenshots are Paddyy&#39;s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8717]HQ Textures[/url]",
