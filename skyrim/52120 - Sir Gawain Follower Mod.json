  "summary": "Adds the Breton follower, Sir Gawain, located in Dragonsreach, with modified equipment.",
  "descriptionHtml": "My first mod - please enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />First off, the things this adds:\r<br />1. The Breton follower, Sir Gawain, who can be recruited at Dragonsreach\r<br />2. The modified Silver Sword, Galatyne; benefits from the Steel Smithing perk\r<br />3. The Galatine enchantment, which is unique to Galatine itself (in other words, can&#39;t be disenchanted); 30 points Fire Damage and especially effective against undead\r<br />4. The perk &#34;Sunchild,&#34; also unique to Gawain, which reduces damage by 90% from 9 AM to 6 PM\r<br />5. The necklace &#34;Giramphiel,&#34; which has Fire Resistance 100%; Gawain literally can’t be hurt by fire while he’s wearing it \r<br />This changes:\r<br />1. Silent Moons enchantment now targets health, so it isn’t useless. Or it should. Let me know if there’s trouble\r<br />\r<br />V1.1: Fixed a mistake I made in the Sunchild perk. Should be accurate, now. Sorry for the mixup.\r<br />\r<br />V1.2: Optional second version of the file, where the Sunchild perk isn&#39;t quite as powerful: only reduces damage by 30% rather than 90%.\r<br />\r<br />Installation should be easy; either use NMM or paste the .esp file into your Skyrim/Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve done some minor testing, and it seemed to work fine. It should also be compatible with all versions of Skyrim (as long as your patches are up to date) and just about any other mod - because it is a very simple mod. However, as I haven&#39;t yet tested it with any of the DLC or any other mods, you might have problems. But you shouldn&#39;t.\r<br />\r<br />Have I said that it&#39;s a simple mod, yet?\r<br />\r<br />At any rate, Gawain should prove very useful. He&#39;s sturdy and his level is capped at 150, and his sword is probably a little overpowered. To be honest, as a character, he&#39;s probably a bit too strong, but since I&#39;m used to playing on high difficulties, I created him with that in mind.\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re playing on lower difficulties, even just on Normal, he&#39;s probably too strong to take along, but if you&#39;re playing on higher difficulties, his knowledge of every player-available fire spell will definitely be useful.\r<br />\r<br />Anyway, Gawain should be just the beginning. I&#39;m making plans for a large scale Arthurian mod, one that should be about as big (content-wise) as one of the DLCs. I’ll need lots of help to get it done, though, so if you’re interested, drop me a line.\r<br />",
