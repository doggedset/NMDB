  "descriptionHtml": "Shadow Ranger Gear by Natterforme\r\n Version: 1.0\r\n Date: 12/13/2012\r\n Category: Weapons and Armor\r\n Recommended: Skyrim Mod Manager\r\n Author(s): Natterforme\r\n Source: \r\n  \r\nDescription\r\n ===========\r\n This is a Nexus Exclusive. This adds a set of equipment intended for role players and archers! \r\n \r\nLocation\r\n ========\r\n All pieces of the set can be crafted at the crafting forge and can be tempered at the proper upgrading areas. The armor is stand alone and will not replace any vanilla armors.\r\n \r\nDetails\r\n =======\r\n \r\n THIS IS A NEXUS EXCLUSIVE! NO STEAM SUPPORT WILL BE OFFERED AT THIS TIME! IF I FIND THAT THIS HAS BEEN UPLOADED TO STEAM WITHOUT MY PERMISSION I WILL NOT BE LENIENT TOWARDS THE UPLOADER(S). YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!\r\n \r\n This mod adds several items to the game. The set includes a cuirass, gauntlets, boots, and two hoods. Orcs can only use the hood without the mask. Khajits and Argonians can not use the hood. The pieces can be worn by both genders and are gender unique. The Light armor version is equivalent to Glass and can be found under the Glass category and the Heavy Armor version is equivalent to Ebony and can be found under the Ebony category. The Light armor version needs the Glass Smithing perk to craft and the Heavy Version needs the Ebony smithing perk to craft. The pieces need leather to upgrade. They both need large amounts of leather and leather strips to craft. This is to offset their high level stats and value.\r\n \r\n This armor mostly uses retextures of the high-res textures where applicable and are located in a seperate folder. They should not be affected by retexture mods.\r\n \r\n If you go into the CK, you will see that there is a Forest Shaman version of the forms. These can not be crafted and their files are not included. This may change in the future, if and when I get the retextures to a quality that I am comfortable with. There may or may not be a cape in the future.\r\n \r\n You are encouraged to use Frankdema\\'s Nordic Ranger outfit or the Nordic Hunter armor set. They go great with companions!^^\r\n \r\n\r\nInstall\r\n =======\r\nEither throw the folders into your Data directory or use the Nexus Mod Manager to do it for you.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n =========\r\n Either use Nexus Mod Manager to remove the files or manually remove them from you Skyrim/Data folder. \r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n =======\r\n I plan to upgrade and improve this mod over time as I fix bugs, think of new ideas, become more adapted to the CK, and so on. Be sure to check back in once and a while for updates. Be sure to completely uninstall any previous versions of this mod before upgrading though.\r\n \r\nI will not take responsibility for corrupted save games or lost save games. Get into the habit of backing up your saves to protect your game data. Ignore at your own risk!\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n ===============\r\n This mod should not be incompatable with any other mods to my knowledge. However it is always a possibility so please let me know about it if you experience a conflict.\r\n \r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n ====================\r\n \r\n There are no known issues at this time. Please exhaust all possible avenues of mod confliction before reporting a bug or an error. To be fair, I do mess up occassionally and make mistakes, but many problems are often the cause of the mod user, and not the mod maker. Also, be sure to give a complete explaination of your problem so that I can more adequetely address the issue when you find one.. Screenshots are highly recommended in this regard.\r\n \r\n \r\nHistory\r\n =======\r\n 12/13/2012 Version 1.0- Initial Release\r\n \r\nContact\r\n =======\r\n You can find me on the Nexus Forums here as Natterforme.\r\n \r\nCredits\r\n =======\r\n Thanks to Frankdema, for making the Nordic Ranger Armor set, the spiritual companion to this armor set! :D\r\n Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\n Thanks to SkyrimNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\n Thanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\r\n Thanks to all of you who have encouraged me and have supported me since I first put up screenshots of my work back in December 2011 and January 2012.\r\n I thank you all for your patience with me^^.\r\n Thanks to God for creating us all.
