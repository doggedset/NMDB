  "descriptionHtml": "In love with Mjoll but put off by her shadowy sidekick?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Aerin Restraining Order is a simple mod that stops Aerin, self-righteous, smile-wearing,\r<br />stalker/creep extraordinaire, from following Mjoll the Lioness around Skyrim after she is\r<br />married to the player. Instead, he will remain in his house in Riften and go through the same\r<br />daily routine that he would if Mjoll were your active follower.\r<br />\r<br />This mod will be incompatible with any that change Aerin&#39;s AI packages directly, but should\r<br />work fine with anything that changes Mjoll the Lioness.\r<br />\r<br />Also check out MrPingy&#39;s mod at http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11899\r<br />He, too, wants to banish that creep to the void.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation\r<br />-------------\r<br />Extract AerinRestrainingOrder.esp to your Skyrim&#92;Data folder. For Steam, this is: \r<br />\r<br />Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;data\r<br />\r<br />Copy/paste works fine too. So does clicking and dragging directly to folder.\r<br />\r<br />Version 0.1 is the current version. It has tested OK and bug-free.",
