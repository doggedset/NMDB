  "descriptionHtml": "This beautiful home includes an all expense paid trip to Oblivion.  Activate the portal, defeat the Daedra and help Uthastyr recover the stone.  Requires Hearthfire and Dawn Guard.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first quest so I expect there are several bugs I did not find.  Please put them in the comments and I will correct them.\r<br />\r<br />Fast travel to any town to get the quest from the courier.\r<br />\r<br />The house is lovely.  It includes a forge, stables, outdoor food storage, a plantable garden, a fishery, cooking, baking, enchanting and alchemy crafting stations.  There are three bedrooms and each allows the theme to be changed by clicking a button beside the door.  You can add the Custom Family Home by VitchRazor to move your spouse and kids here.  There are also custom display spaces for the Dragon Priest masks, the Divine&#39;s amulets, dragon claws and the thane reward weapons (equip the weapon and place on the shield).  A few of the bookshelves have been resized for the smaller books and there are journal shelves in the bedrooms.  Almost forgot, there is a bath and you can turn off the water.\r<br />\r<br />As for Oblivion, without spoiling it, be prepared to fight. You don&#39;t need to kill the tavern patrons, they will ignore you, Uthastyr has the house key and look behind the large tent for a shortcut.\r<br />\r<br />Thank you to Icehunter for helping test the quest, making suggestions and finding a few bugs.\r<br />",
