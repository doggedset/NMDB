  "descriptionHtml": "I reduced the resistances for poison, disease, fire, lightning, and frost to be half their values with the exception of the lowest level one which is reduced to 2/3.  In my opinion it is far too easy to hit the max resist cap.  I did not touch magic resist as I believe it to be in line with balance.  I jhave not tested it with craftable enchants, just those items that come with the enchants already on them (loot, bought, rewards).\r\n\r\nThe different levels of gear had the following enchantments (frost, lightning, and fire)\r\n(old->new)\r\n15->10\r\n30->15\r\n40->20\r\n50->25\r\n60->30\r\n70->35\r\n\r\nResist disease and poison\r\n(old->new)\r\n50->15\r\n100->30",
