  "descriptionHtml": "[color=2CB4BE][u]Description:[/u][/color] [color=84DC85]Saved games I\\'ve put together with unique characters and their interesting back-stories. They each have their own regular save (for those that just like their appearance) and an alternate start (for bored RPers). Some quests are disabled or already set as done, for the sake of RP location and so you\\'d still be able to continue with the main quest. Lots of love and thought went into them so please, enjoy! Thank you Wyatt14 for your brilliant ideas for both male characters :)\r\n\r\nI\\'d also like to apologize for the quality of Rulf\\'s screenshot. I didn\\'t realize it looked like THAT. It will be fixed later though. I assure you, he is a handsome devil :) <------(Deleted all her screenshots like an idiot)\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6331]A Character with Character[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7193]A Character with Character II[/url]\r\n[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=2CB4BE][u]Saved Games and BATS?:[/u][/color] [color=84DC85]I\\'ve provided optional bat files for certain characters that can be used via console to tweak your gaming experience and so it fits their background and specializations a little better. Just certain perks so they\\'re not OP or anything.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=2CB4BE][b][u]Characters[/u][/b][/color]\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb12.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] Meli \r\n[Race/Sex] Orc Female[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035]Ever since Ghorbash returned from his travels and told tales of his adventures in Skyrim (with enough coaxing and Ale of course), Meli grew bored of Dushnikh Yal. She longed for something more than just stronghold guard. One night, while everyone retired to the longhouse, she left, saying her goodbyes to Arub as she took Chief Burguk\\'s horse.\r\n\r\nShe heard the Jarl of Whiterun was rewarding anyone who was brave enough to go into Bleak Falls Barrow and retrieve the Dragonstone. Adventure awaits! [/color]\r\n\r\n[color=F4F15C][b]Note:[/b] The alternate save starts off outside the gates of Dushnikh Yal with a horse accompanying you. If you download the esp (in the optional files), the horse\\'s name will be Godspeed and also have the same stats/factions/ai behavior as Shadowmere but no saddle. Godspeed is a wild horse lol. Otherwise, its just regular old Karinda who you can either ride as is, or delete with the \\'markfordelete\\' command in the console. If you\\'re an immersion junkie like I am, I recommend you keep the horse and ride all the way to BFB. She\\'s equipped with a Hunting bow, steel arrows, and two Orchish Daggers. [/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb11.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] Rulf \r\n[Race/Sex] Nord Male[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035]Like the famed Ulfric Stormcloak and Tiber Septim, he too learned the The Way of the Voice. Left at High Hrothgar at a very young age, Arngeir acted as his mentor. He and the others knew the boy was special as he learned the shouts and history of the Thu\\'um quickly. His  desire to learn soon became curiosity. He learned of their leader and some of his history and quickly began to question the Thu\\'um and why Arngeir was quick to anger when he would ask of a shout that was rumored to be created by men. He grew tired of their secrets and left.\r\n\r\nYears later, he became a wanderer and would take up bounties once in a while. It began to circulate that a man took on gangs of bandits unarmed and shouted them away. He happen to be walking by Whiterun\\'s stables when he overheard Skulvar talking to his son about the Jarl\\'s housecarl and a good handful of men gathering by the Western Watchtower to slay a dragon.\r\n [/color]\r\n\r\n[color=F4F15C][b]Note:[/b] Rulf starts off in front of Whiterun Stables. He is already equipped with three shouts (Ice Form, Unrelenting Force, Fire Breath), steel armor, and has all Armsmen perks. I highly recommend downloading \\\"Unarmed Combat\\\" by Eldiran. Nothing\\'s more fun than being able to punch a dragon in the face :D[/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb9.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] Marcus \r\n[Race/Sex] Dark Elf Male[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035] Once a lowly woodsmen, Marcus was deemed worthy enough to be spoken to by Lord Dagon. He now serves as an agent and is always found meditating near his shrine. One day the daedric lord spoke to him, telling him of the approaching World-Eater. Arming him with his razor and heavy armor, he commands him to enter a barrow and retrieve an etched stone for the court wizard Farengar.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=F4F15C][b]Note:[/b] Starts at the Shrine of Mehrunes Dagon. You are armed with daedric armor, Mehrunez Razor, another daedric dagger, and the ability to conjure a Dremora. You also have the perk and magicka points (200 magicka) to enable this ability.[/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb10.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] Viktoria \r\n[Race/Sex] Breton Female[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035]Left with her great aunt Anise to help her gather ingredients, Viktoria suspected there was more to the old woman then she let\\'s on. She never lets her play with the other children and forbade her from going into her cellar. The only time she left was to deliver ingredients to Dragonsreach. As her aunt was napping in front of the small shack, she grew curious and snuck into the cellar.[/color] \r\n\r\n[color=F4F15C]Note: Starts off in the cellar of Anise\\'s Cabin. She is equipped with health and invisibility potions. Use them wisely. Also recommend \\'Summon Animal Pets\\' by Volek. Just for help.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=2CB4BE][u]Mods Used:[/u][/color] [color=84DC85]In each rar I\\'ve included a Readme with a list of mods used so you can get their exact appearance as in the photos. Also so this description wouldn\\'t become TL;DR. I\\'ve also include installation and bat instructions. If there are any issues or you need help, send me a quick pm :)[/color] \r\n\r\n[color=2CB4BE][u]Credits:[/u][/color] [color=84DC85]Thank you Bethseda for letting my imagination run wild :)[/color]",
