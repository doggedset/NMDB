  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u][font=Arial][size=4]Description:\r<br />[/size][/font][/u][/b]Welcome to Skytech ENB. This ENB is meant to give users a visually pleasing experience. This mod is in early stages and therefore does not provide the performance that you may expect. You may notice drops from 10-40 fps depending on your system. I will provide performance options in the future. While testing this ENB, I used quite a few graphical mods such as W.A.T.E.R. and Skyrim 2k Textures. I have a list at the end of this submission of the suggested mods. Download them in that order and install them in that order replacing anything when asked to.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][u]Installation:\r<br />[/u][/b][/size]The installation is not very complicated. Simply open up the archive and drag and drop all of the contents into your skyrim folder. Open the internet browser of your choice and go to http://enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0264.htm. Scroll down to the bottom and click the download button. Open up the archive and go into the wrapper folder. Drag and drop the d3d9.dll into your skyrim directory. You should be able to open up the game and see a notification at the top left of your screen. If there is no notification, check that you did everything right. If it still doesn&#39;t work, leave a comment telling me and I will help you.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=4]Effects:\r<br />[/size][/u][/b]ENBs can provide a long list of effects but how the effect is optimized is more important. Skytech ENB uses almost all of the effects but all of them are optimized for the best visual experience. Here is a list of all of the effects used:\r<br />\r<br />Bloom\r<br />DOF\r<br />AO\r<br />Adaption\r<br />Detailed Shadow\r<br />Sun Rays\r<br />Sun glare (Disabled by default) (Not recommended due to some issues with power)\r<br />Sky Lighting\r<br />Image Based LIghting\r<br />Reflections\r<br />Soft Particles\r<br />Particle Lights\r<br />Sub-Surface Scattering\r<br />Water\r<br />Underwater\r<br />Cloud Shadows\r<br />Volumetric Rays\r<br />Mist\r<br />\r<br />That is a lot of effects to optimize and that is why this ENB is only in early stages. I am having trouble with the sun glare currently so I do not suggest using it. This ENB will always be receiving updates so much sure you check it every once in a while.\r<br />\r<br />Please endorse if enjoy this mod and leave a comment if you have more thoughts.",
