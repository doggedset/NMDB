  "descriptionHtml": "**** This mod is now obsolete.  New version at: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35612 ****\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Notes:\r\nNew version (v2_2)\r\nNew version uploaded.  I noticed some books were behaving strangely and found I had accidently duplicated a bookshelf so there were two occupying the same space.  This meant that some books could not be retrieved and would be in the way of books being displayed.\r\nI would advise clearing out the house, deleting the mod and then installing the new version.  If you just upgrade to the new version then you may find you have some books in the library that cannot be picked up.\r\n\r\nAlso added in an extra bookshelf so capacity is now 324.\r\n****\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\nI love to collect and display items within Skyrim but no other home quite felt right for me for a variety of reasons so I made this one.\r\n\r\nThis home is located East of Ivarstead by following the road at the north of the village.  There is a picture showing the location in the screenshots section.\r\n\r\nFrom the outside you can see what looks like a pleasant wooden home built into the side of the mountain.  Higher up, you can see a structure jutting out of the mountain.\r\n\r\nUpon entering you find that the wooden exterior is just the start of the house as it connects to the hallways and chambers of an ancient complex.\r\n\r\nThere is only one load door which leads to a cavern.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me with any requests or suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n40 Mannequins.\r\n85 Custom Made Weapon Displays.\r\n35 Shield Displays.\r\n270 Book Spaces (unless using the unlimited bookshelves mod).\r\nDisplays for Dragon Claws, Dragonpriest Masks, Larceny Items, Insect Jars and various other unique items.\r\n\r\nKitchen Garden with a variety of plants.\r\nAlchemy Garden with a variety of ingredients.\r\nWorkshop with crafting facilities.\r\nCooking Facility.\r\nAlchemy & Enchanting facility.\r\nCavern with more ingredients including harvestable soul gems.\r\n10 Shrines.\r\n\r\nA variety of containers for most needs.\r\nTeleport system for quick and easy navigation.\r\nTimed exterior lights.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThis is my first mod and although I think I have set everything up properly so that the containers and displays will not respawn, I can\\'t absolutely guarantee this.  I\\'m using the house myself though.\r\n\r\nI personally don\\'t like internal load doors so made this with a minimum.  This does mean though that the interior cell is very large and although this works great on my system, I have no idea how it will perform on others.  If it causes a lot of problems, I may be able to make one that is more conventionally split up.  I\\'ll see how it goes first though.\r\n\r\nThe ligthing isn\\'t great in places but I did my best.  I\\'m only using the original skyrim lights also, so it\\'s untested with anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nI\\'ve used some modding resources from here, so credit must be given to:\r\n\r\nArtisanix for Paintings and Frames http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17423\r\nBlary for Ingredients in a Jar Resource http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30601\r\nBlary for FoodContainer Resource http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14133\r\nChickenDownUnder for Harvestables http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15108\r\nElinen for Hoddminir Water Plants http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29486\r\nTamira for New Plants v1.2 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22018\r\n\r\nFinally, enormous thanks must go to Sjogga for the: Dragon Claw Script and instructions which I was also able to adapt for other displays; the Azura/Black Star Script; the Teleport Script from their lovely Dawnspire home (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20751); and just general friendliness and helpfulness.",
