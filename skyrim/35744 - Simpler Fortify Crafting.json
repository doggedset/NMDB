  "descriptionHtml": "Fortify Crafting effects are much less hassle and much better balanced with this mod. You\\'ll never need an crafting set, just one item per skill. Also, you\\'ll never have to go back-and-forth between Alchemy and Enchanting to make the absolute best gear.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Don\\'t have Fortify Alchemy or Fortify Smithing gear equipped when you start or stop using this mod, or you\\'ll break your alchemymod and smithingmod values. Also, if you use \\\"I\\'m a Hero, Not a Businessman\\\", put it below this in the load order.\r\n\r\nThe specific changes made by this mod are as follows:\r\n- Fortify Alchemy and Fortify Smithing enchantments are twice as powerful but are non-stacking.\r\n- The Alchemist perk grants a 25% bonus per rank (instead of 20%).\r\n- The best crafted Fortify Crafting items are just as strong as the best generic Fortify Crafting items.\r\n- Crafted Fortify Smithing potions are no longer far more powerful than generic Fortify Smithing potions.\r\n\r\nThis mod can also be found on Steam Workshop at [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=143654147]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=143654147[/url].\r\n\r\nIf you find any bugs or issues, please note them in the comments so I can promptly address them.",
