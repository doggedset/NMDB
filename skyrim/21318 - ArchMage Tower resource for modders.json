Other levels are labolatory. Still much to do in this place but good modder might find this recource usefull\r<br />\r<br />First this tower was made for someone as a request. Favor for favor or at least feedback but this person did ignore me at the end and since I did spend so much time on this thing I think someone else should be able to use it and appriciate my work. \r<br />\r<br />I preffer to work on other type of interiors so this one wont be of any use for me. Still lots of work on this tower to make it nice place but if youre skilled mod creator you find this place grea addition to your work\r<br />\r<br />If you like you can also use those\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15949 My uncompleted project which most likley I wont ever complete\r<br />\r<br />and\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13964 Fell free to use any interior I made here ;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you like my work why not try playing my mods? This one is so far my most succesful one in Skyrim (NOT modders recource)\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18421",
