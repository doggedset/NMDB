  "descriptionHtml": "A simple mod I made. This is a very simple side quest, An encampment of imperial soldiers of 50 were sighted by a stormcloak scout, find the scout and learn the details of his findings. If you are on the side of the stormcloaks then I invite you to download this mod, and if your are still neutral, why not give it a try. However, you can\\'t kill the imperial commander, guess you left him alive to go back and tell the story of your bravery against the imperials. lol\r\nPlease make a backup on your save before using this mod as I\\'m not sure if it does affect the storyline or not. \r\n\r\nThe scout is headed towards Riverwood, he\\'s not far from the entrance, find him along the road.\r\n\r\n\r\nIF you need a No Bounty mod, go to http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11773#content and download Halver\\'\\'s mod. \r\nThanks to Misterpoint for the link.",
