Fairytales are for children.[/center]\r<br />[center]You sit down on the other side of the room hoping the man finishes soon.[/center]\r<br />[center]As everyone listens to him in awe, you cannot help but hear the rest of the story.[/center]\r<br />[center]What catches your interest is the name of the inn this whole tale is about. The Fourshields Tavern.[/center]\r<br />[center]Would it worth your time to check the place out?[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/34800-1-1365971044.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]Galen is a Redguard and a werewolf. He got infected young and could not dominate the beast within for so long.[/center]\r<br />[center]He killed whoever got in his way, couldnt differentiate friend from foe.[/center]\r<br />[center]People noticed and rallied to hunt him down - they even found him and wounded him badly. He could escape, but barely.[/center]\r<br />[center]A man followed the mob then the signs of the bleeding Galen. By the time he found him, he was already human again and on the verge of death.[/center]\r<br />[center]The man nursed him back to life and invited him to his family.[/center]\r<br />[center]It took Galen a long time but finally he showed up in Whiterun. That was the time he realised the man was Kodlak Whitemane.[/center]\r<br />[center]He stayed, but never mingled with the town&#39;s people. He was but a whisper in the wind.[/center]\r<br />[center]The Companions taught him how to control the Beast more or less, he even found love - a young girl who just joined the legendary group.[/center]\r<br />[center]All was well until at a full moon Galen couldnt escape in time and the girl was following him. She stood there frozen while he turned and in her shock, she couldnt even escape.[/center]\r<br />[center]He told only to Kodlak what happened - he was sympathetic but also grieved for the girl.[/center]\r<br />[center]That was the last time anyone of the Companions saw Galen.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please, if you decide to go and look for Galen, take good care of him.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/34800-1-1365971627.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]-= Good to know =-[/size]\r<br />\r<br />He starts with Banded Iron Armor and a Skyforge Steel Greatsword.\r<br />He is essential and you can marry him.\r<br />He can transform to werewolf by command.\r<br />Be aware that letting him turn in public, will get you a 1000 gold bounty and people will also attack you.\r<br />When he changes back to human form, he will be undressed (this means he will wear only his undies or nothing depending on the body meshes you are using).\r<br />Also, if his &#34;wolfish&#34; dialogue lines do not show up right away, make a quicksave-quickload and they&#39;ll be there.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ff0000][b]Galen is translated to Russian thanks to AlexDranzy, you can find it here:[/b][/color]\r<br />[/size][url=http://tes-game.ru/load/skyrim/kompanony/galen/46-1-0-8553][size=4]Russian translation by AlexDranzy[/size]\r<br />[/url]\r<br />[center][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]-= Recommended =-[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34438]Subtle Male Skeleton by Earrindo[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11371]83Willows WHITER TEETH 4all[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13779]Heart of the Beast - Werewolf Sound and Texture Overhaul by NsJones[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12687]Tales of Lycanthropy - Werewolf Overhaul by Brevi[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27815]Fine Face Textures for Men by Urshi[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25249]Alvhilde - Nord Werewolf Huntress - Follower Mod by Alex Silvestre[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=6]-= Thank you =-[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center]Thank you, my dear friends for the help, time and advices and the amazing shots you created&#33; :)[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2689072]zzjay[/url],[/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/4216491]clethcleth[/url],[/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/4184206]urshi[/url],[/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/5095661]Alex Silvestre[/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]-= Installation =-[/size]\r<br />\r<br />After the extraction of the file just copy the files into Data folder.
