  "modName": "Warfighter Armory",
  "summary": "A medium sized mod with plans for expansion after initial release. Provides a number of pieces of equipment ranging from retextures, model edits, and down right new meshes. As of the first version, a customized Ranger light armor set is here, along with a viscous tomahawk, buckler, and two small, retextured bows. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "===Version 2.00\r\n==New Crusader armor! Based on standard templar design, this set will give light armor fanatics a new, armored choice to wear. Standard helmet also has a retexture called the Bloodletter! (No female compatability as of yet, though you can still wear the helmet and the armor if, you know, don\\'t want any boobs, and who would want that!?)\r\n==Added Female compatibility with original Ranger Armor set, minus the hood, which still needs a model edit (WIP)\r\n==Black versions of cloak and hood added, though depending on the ENB you use, you might not notice a big difference.  \r\n=Remaining issues:\r\n-No Blood Effects for Tomahawk (Does anyone have a good tutorial for this?)\r\n-Female hood still needs changes.\r\n-Bloodletter version for the main Crusader armor still WIP.\r\n-Crusader armor needs weight slider support, kinda looks a bit wimpy.\r\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Do you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\n========================================================\r\n\r\n Warfighter Armory\r\nBy: MaesltromDesign (AKA KnightOfAmmo), check out my deviantart: http://knightofammo.deviantart.com/\r\n========================================================\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nBe prepared for mediocrity with a measure of badassery. I have spent the last few days painstakingly drinking soda and looking at memebase, idly modding this mod into Skyrim, shamelessly scrapping models and textures together with bits and piece of my own imagination and as my first mod, i hope you are as happy as i am with it. Enjoy :P\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i433.photobucket.com/albums/qq55/KnightOfAmmo/WarfighterArmory.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a modified set of thieves guild armor i\\'ve dubbed \\\"The Ranger\\\", with the top shoulder pauldrons removed and some packs and pockets removed and add where need to give you that lean, badass hunter/ranger look while not appearing to be caring a keg under your curiass as the original model suggested. Along with new curiass, boots, and bracers, i\\'ve included a evergreen style cape and hood for those who like a little bit of green to go with their black, instead of the nightingale black with the nightingale black (Which was a little drab IMO)... Oh, and there\\'s more! Including two darker retextures of the steel and long bow (and a damage boost to equal the Ebony bow), i\\'ve built my own custom Tomahawk model for my mod! Okay... so you can\\'t throw it. It\\'s still pretty cool. Like, at least 20% cooler (if you know what i mean).\r\n\r\n--Armor craftable at any forge, all of it upgradable. Reguires Advanced Armors perk.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i433.photobucket.com/albums/qq55/KnightOfAmmo/WarfighterArmory2.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n========================================================\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n Place the \\'Data\\' folder in your Skyrim install directory. Usually in your program files under Bethesda, unless you have the steam version.</center>\r\n\r\n========================================================\r\n\r\nFuture Expansion:\r\n--Hood that is pulled down.\r\n--Different color styles on request.\r\n--More custom weapons.\r\n--Crusader style armor (a mix of light and heavy armor).\r\n--Custom bow meshes (Extremely hard to implement, have no idea why...).\r\n--Female versions as well as weight slider compatibility.\r\n--More, non-fufu jewlery (Think shark teeth necklaces and dragon bone rings).\r\n--And stuff... I guess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions? Post in the comments!",
