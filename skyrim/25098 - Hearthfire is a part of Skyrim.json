  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'ve played a little bit of Hearthfire now and it really bugs me to see that all of these cool items like milk, butter,new breads and pies aren\\'t included in the original game. So I\\'ve worked a bit with my project and here are the results:\r\n\r\nI added 4 ovens into the game\r\n\r\nEvery tavern now has the new items like milk, butter, breadloafs, pies and wine\r\n\r\nSome randomly picked houses also have these items so that it feels like they were in Skyrim from the very beginning\r\n\r\nEnjoy, hope you all feel that Hearthfire is a little more active part in Skyrim",
