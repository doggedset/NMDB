  "summary": "Gives Red Eagle&#39;s Bane/Fury a makeover, changing both to Daedric Swords. Also removes the old effects, replacing them with Absorb Health, and extra damage to Nords and Imperials.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was always a little disappointed with the vanilla versions of Red Eagle&#39;s sword. It seemed strange to me that it would be an Ancient Nord Sword for starters, given that the Nords and Imperials are the Reachmen&#39;s enemies. So I changed it to a Daedric Sword, which feels more like something the Old Gods of the Reach would bestow upon their champion.\r<br />\r<br />As a Daedric Sword, it is now tempered with an ebony ingot, and requires the Daedric Smithing perk to get the full effect of tempering.\r<br />\r<br />I also changed the effects. The base sword now has an Absorb Health of 5 points, and the Upgraded version an Absorb Health of 10 points. The Upgraded sword has also been renamed Red Eagle&#39;s Vengeance, and does an extra 1.5 times base damage to Nords and Imperials - the oppressors of the Reachmen. This includes Nordic and Imperial vampires.\r<br />\r<br />I have also included an optional 2 Handed Sword version of the mod. Note that this will not work with the normal - one handed - version of this mod. Only select one or the other, based on whether you want a one or two handed sword.\r<br />\r<br />Version History:\r<br />1.0 -\r<br />Original Release\r<br />\r<br />1.1 -\r<br />Increased the number of charges the swords have.",
