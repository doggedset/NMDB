  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z103/journeytoavalon/RealisticLightingBannerSmall.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z103/journeytoavalon/Introduction2.png[/IMG]\r\nI\\'ve tried almost every ENB preset available, and it has cost me hours and hours of searching and tweaking.\r\nIn the end none of them was really what I wanted. Most of the ENB presets are way too oversaturated, washed\r\nout, too bloomy, have to much contrast... and so forth.\r\n\r\nI ended up seeing that vanilla Skyrim\\'s lighting isn\\'t all that bad, except for a few things:\r\n- Too light, overexposed nights, which are almost completely desaturated which makes flames and other light sources\r\n  look white and really weird.\r\n- Just overall too much desaturation going on.\r\n- Contrast is crushed in certain scenes.\r\n- Dungeons are too light.\r\n- Torches give bright white/yellow light, which looks like it\\'s light from a lightbulb instead of flames.\r\n\r\nThis combination of 2 very good other mods and my ENB 113 preset fixes all of these things, and subtly changes the\r\nlighting in Skyrim for the better. It keeps the overall feeling the game has and should have, and adds up to that.\r\nNo oversaturation, no whistles and bells. No Nonsense, Just Realistic Lighting.\r\nThis mod, unlike almost all other ENB presets, doesn\\'t ruin the fog distance and thus doesn\\'t make the LOD all weird\r\nduring foggy or snowy weaher!\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z103/journeytoavalon/modincludes2.png[/IMG]\r\n- An ENB 113 profile with godrays activated in the standard version.\r\n\r\n- Abilty to choose for SSAO and/or DoF as well.\r\n\r\n- \\\"No Tint and Desaturation\\\" - Less Tint version (75% of original tint) by Laicus\r\n   available at: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/648\r\n\r\n- \\\"Creepy Dungeons\\\" by Rednaolrac, for realistic, real DARK dungeons, without any fake lights.\r\n   available at: hhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12808\r\n\r\n- \\\"Warmer Torches\\\", which fixes the color of the lighting that torches emit, by me\r\n\r\n- \\\"Brigher MageLight\\\", which enlarges the radius of the magelight spell somewhat, to compensate the darker dungeons. \r\n\r\n- \\\"Cple Light Source Fix\\\" by Cple, which fixes the placing of light sources in quite alot of the interiors and dungeons. Not all though.\r\n   available at: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=8683&searchtext=\r\n\r\n- \\\"Whiterun Lighting Fix\\\" by Daemonjax. Fixes that the lights around Whiterun had incorrect settings which caused them to appear to \\\"pop in\\\".\r\n   available at: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12357\r\n\r\n- \\\"Zfixed Lights\\\" by ZoCks, also fixes misplaced lights is the game.\r\n   available at: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11696\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z103/journeytoavalon/installation2.png[/IMG]\r\n- Go to http://enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0113.htm and download ENB v113 for Skyrim. Install the files into the Skyrim root directory.\r\n- Extract the archive of my mod and navigate into the folder.\r\n- For the Standard version, with just Godrays and no SSAO and/or DoF, open the \\'- Standard (Just Godrays)\\' folder,\r\n  select everything in the folder, copy/cut it and paste it in your Skyrim root folder (where TESV.exe is). When asked to overwrite, click Yes.\r\n- For additional SSAO/DoF, open the corresponding folder, select the enbseries.ini, copy/cut it and paste it in the\r\n  Skyrim root folder. When asked to overwrite, click Yes.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z103/journeytoavalon/uninstallation2.png[/IMG]\r\n- To uninstall the mod, remove all enb related files and the d3d9.ddl file from the Skyrim root folder and remove\r\n  the \\'LessTint.esp\\',\\'Further Dark Dungeons for ENB\\' and the \\'Warmer Torches.esp\\' files from the Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n- For additional SSAO/DoF, open the corresponding folder, select the enbseries.ini, copy/cut it and paste it in the\r\n  Skyrim root folder. When asked to overwrite, click Yes.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z103/journeytoavalon/knownissues2.png[/IMG]\r\n- ENB is known to cause some drop in framerate. The Standard version is the least performance heavy version, while\r\n  the Godrays + SSAO + DoF is the most performance heavy. At this point, nothing can be done about this.\r\n- ENB 113 still has the issue that the LODshadowfadedistance is somehow less far then normal, which results in minor\r\n  shadow popin. Again, this lies in the coding of ENB, and at this point nothing can be done about this.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z103/journeytoavalon/specialthanks2.png[/IMG]\r\n- Rednaolrac for the Creepy Dungeons mod.\r\n- Cple for the Cple Light Source Fix mod.\r\n- Daemonjax for the Whiterun Lighting Fix mod.\r\n- ZoCks for the Zfixed Lights mod.\r\n\r\nI included their mods just the make things easy for you, and I completely respect their work. I take absolutely\r\nno credits for these 2 mods, all credits go to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
