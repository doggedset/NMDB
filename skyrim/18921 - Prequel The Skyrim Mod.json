  "descriptionHtml": "Ladies and gentlemen,  boys and girls of ages 15 and up, I\\'m proud to present to you...\r\n\r\nPrequel, the Skyrim mod!\r\n\r\nI can\\'t believe that this thing is finally finished (or at least at a state where I\\'m happy to release it).\r\n\r\nI want to thank ErisAnima (over on DA) for helping to test this mod during it\\'s development.\r\n\r\nAs for what this mod actually does, it adds a spell to the game to summon some of the Prequel cast, Gro-upp as a replacement to the Skyrim thief npc and the amulet of silence.\r\n\r\n<s>installation wise, do not try to install the zip file directly as it is here on DA. you\\'ll need to open that zip file up and extract it\\'s contents and then install the \\\"install this file.zip\\\" file. you\\'ll also need to copy the included folder into your \\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Actors\\\\Character\\\\FaceGenData\\\\FaceTint\\\" folder, or your computer\\'s equivalent. once all that\\'s done, load up skyrim and enjoy.</s>\r\n\r\nupdated installation instructions found within the zip file.\r\n\r\nthe new spell can be bought at dragonsreach or found on the dragon priest by sovengard and the amulet of silence can be bought at dragonsreach for a price that reflects it usefulness.\r\n\r\nRight now, my main concern is weather it will work properly on other people\\'s computers.\r\nIf it does, but people find bugs or have suggestions, let me know and I\\'ll try to rectify them/ consider implementing suggestions.\r\nIf for some reason it doesn\\'t work, I\\'ll put some more forehead shaped dents into my desk and see if I can get it working.\r\n\r\nEnjoy :)\r\n\r\nalso, install this:\r\nuse this http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2097\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> before updating the mod, remove the previous version from skyrim, run the game and re save any active saves that utilised this mod. this way there should be no conflict between content from the two different mods</b>\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.1:\r\nreformatted the mod to .esp (should make things easier for everyone)\r\nedited spell description to update as necessary\r\nbuy-ables (spell tome and amulet) should now be, well, buy-able...\r\nmade the face colour more stable (hopefully)\r\n\r\n<b>if currently running version 1.1,  you only need to update the esp file to upgrade to 1.2</b>\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.2:\r\nAdded a \\'donations\\' chest to the arch mage\\'s quarters beneath one of the tables. You\\'ll need a key to get in. Guess who has it... (I was going to up a big pile of gold in the room, but even a small pile would crash the game :()\r\nAdded Katia\\'s axe. found at the sky forge. \r\nAdded cheapest mead <sup>tm</sup>. Can be bought from the drunken huntsman. I\\'d advise against drinking the stuff with enemies around...",
