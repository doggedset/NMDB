  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION:\r<br />This mod replaces the Dawnguard husky barking with blank sound files.  You will still hear all the other sound effects from the dog, such as sniffing, panting, growling, etc.  They just will not sit there barking incessantly anymore while trying to talk to someone or sneaking.  \r<br />\r<br />REQUIRED:\r<br />Needless to say, this requires the Dawnguard DLC.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />Simply extract and drop in Skyrim data folder or download and install with NMM.",
