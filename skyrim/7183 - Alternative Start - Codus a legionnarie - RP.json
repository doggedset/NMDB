  "summary": "On the way back to Solitude Codus and his men come across a challenge most would run screaming from.  But no challenge is to great for the Imperial Legion!",
  "descriptionHtml": "Growing up in Anvil during the great war has impressions on a persons life.  One of those impressions is a hate for the Aldmeri Dominion.  After taking Anvil they treated its residents like trash.  As soon as he was of age, Codus signed up in the Imperial Legion to teach those snobby elves a lesson.  Now Codus finds himself squashing a nord rebellion in Skyrim.  Legate Rikke has sent orders for him to report back to Solitude.  On the way there Codus and his men decided to stop by Whiterun for supplies.  As they neared Whiterun they came across a watchtower under attack.  Running to the city guards aid Codus and his men quickly realized that this will be no ordinary fight.   Too bad for this dragon that Codus has got his armor, sword, shield and legion training.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative start save.  His skills are:\r\nAll magic skills are at 0\r\nSpeech is at 20 for giving orders to his men\r\nLight Armor is at 30 since every good legionnaire should be proficient in all types of armors\r\nAll other sneak skills are at 0 because the legions exist to protect the people not steal from them\r\nOne handed, block and heavy armor are at 40 since these are Codus\\'s preferences\r\nTwo handed is at 20 from basic legion training\r\nArchery is at 30 because of the intense archery training legionnaires go through\r\nSmithing is at 20 since legionnaires have to sharpen their own swords every once and a while\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nAOF Believable Hair-Female and Male- (I used this to boost the hair quality in the screenshot)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4307\r\n\r\nXCE - Xenius Character Enhancement (I used this to boost the characters looks in the screenshot)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356\r\n\r\nRecommendations: (I, of course, recommend the mods I used above along with these)\r\nWeapons of the Third Era\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3871\r\n\r\nVarious Guards Outfit for Every City TS Edition \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6770\r\n\r\nA Quality World Map - With Roads\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4929\r\n\r\nCompelling Treasure Maps\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6907\r\n\r\nDeadly Dragons\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3829\r\n\r\nDFB Companion Bow Visible\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6520\r\n\r\nDovahkiin Hideout\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6032\r\n\r\nFirewood For Sale\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5653\r\n\r\nI Put A Spell On You - More Enchanting Options \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3313\r\n\r\nJaySuS Swords \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1002\r\n\r\nLord Armor\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5853\r\n\r\nMidas Magic - Spells in Skyrim\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3413\r\n\r\nNPC Bartering\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6802\r\n\r\nPhenderix Magic Evolved - 144 New Spells\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5898\r\n\r\nPricier and Heavier Pelts and Hides \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7039\r\n\r\nQuick Tomb Looting\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6591\r\n\r\nSkyrim Performance PLUS\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6387\r\n\r\nSkyrim Nordplate Enhanced\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6804\r\n\r\nWars in Skyrim IV - Dark Rainbow is back-\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6176\r\n\r\nWitchers Blades\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6253\r\n\r\nBugs/Issues\r\nIf there are any problems feel free to voice them in the comments section which I will try to check back often",
