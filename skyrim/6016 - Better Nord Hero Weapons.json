  "summary": "A small stat buff for the Nord Hero weapons.  The \\\"Better\\\" esp makes the weapons more poweful than Daedric, the \\\"Balanced\\\" esp makes them slightly less than ebony.  3rd option, strike fast or strike hard!",
  "descriptionHtml": "In vanilla Skyrim, the nord hero weapons have the same stats as the honed ancient nord weapons.  I didn\\'t like that after going through the Companions questline, the weapons you can make have the same stats as weapons you can find on random draugr.  So, they get a small damage tweak.  The weapons that are affected are as follows:\r\n\r\nNord Hero Sword\r\nNord Hero Greatsword\r\nNord Hero War Axe\r\nNord Hero Battle Axe\r\nNord Hero Bow\r\n\r\nnote:  the only thing that has been edited with these weapons are their damage.  Their weight, speed, range, and meshes/textures have remained untouched.  All 5 weapons have had +5 added to their damage.  Not a huge gain, but hopefully enough to want these weapons over their Honed counterparts.\r\n\r\n2nd note:  I\\'ve now uploaded a balanced version, which makes them slightly less powerful than their ebony counterparts.  You can only have 1 esp active at a time, DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN ONE ACTIVE! \r\n\r\n3rd note:  There\\'s now a faster version, which keeps vanilla damage, but increases the speed of all weapons.  Thanks again to Sushisquid for his input, and feedback is always welcome.",
