  "summary": "Fixes Stable Masters and Carriage Drivers dying with the Wars in Skryim mod.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I noticed when using the Wars in Skyrim mod that out-of-city NPCs tend to die randomly. I noticed this when the Carriage master at Whiterun was dead, as well as the Stable Master. I couldn\\'t find a mod to fix it, so I just made one myself.\r\n\r\nThis mod is a super-simple NPC mod that simply edits all the Stable Masters and Carriage Drivers to \\\"Essential\\\", meaning they can NOT be killed.\r\n\r\nJust for information\\'s sake, here\\'s a total list of NPCs that are affected:\r\n\r\nCarriage Drivers for Whiterun, Windhelm, Riften, Markarth, and Solitude.\r\nCedran- (Markarth Stable Master)\r\nGeimund (Solitude Stable Master)\r\nSkulvar Sable-Hilt (Whiterun Stable Master)\r\nHofgrir Horse-Crusher (Riften Stable Master)\r\nUlundil (Windhelm Stable Master)\r\n\r\n[b][color=RED]WARNING TO MODDERS/DOWNLOADERS[/color][/b]\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod I have ever done, and I don\\'t know very much about the Creation Kit or modding in general. I looked up just as much as I had to, because I needed it for my gaming stream. While I have not experienced any problems, that doesn\\'t mean this might not SOMEHOW break your entire game. As with all mods, please back up your saves and anything else you deem essential before installing this file. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions...Frankly I won\\'t be able to answer them. Again, I\\'m a total n00b at this, and if you come to me with some random error message, I\\'m just going to throw up my hands and say \\\"Sorry dude, guess the mod doesn\\'t work for you!\\\". \r\n\r\n[b]INSTALLATION:[/b]\r\n\r\nNab the file and put it in your Skyrim Data folder. It\\'s very easy.\r\n\r\n[b]DISTRIBUTION[/b]\r\n\r\nThis is such a tiny mod, I really don\\'t give a crap what you do with it. Open Source, w/e.",
