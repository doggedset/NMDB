  "descriptionHtml": "Much like my \\\"Slightly Boosted Arch Mage Robes\\\" mod (http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5264) this mod was designed for those people who wish to wear the unique gear but still want to enchant their way to a 100% reduction in cost for certain spell schools.\r\n\r\nSpecific Changes:\r\n\r\nMorokei - Removed Light Armor attribute turning it into clothing so it can be worn while using the Mage Armor perk bonus from Alteration. Upped the Magicka Regeneration from 100% to 125%. This was because according to UESP (http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Priest_Mask#Dragon_Priest_Masks) the mask isn\\'t even technically considered an artifact because other helmets of recovery also have 100% Magicka Regen.\r\n\r\nNahkriin - Removed Light Armor attribute turning it into clothing so it can be worn while using the Mage Armor perk bonus from Alteration. Upped Destruction and Restoration fortification from 20% to 25%. As mentioned above this is simply so it can be used in conjuction with 3 other items enchanted to 25% in those schools to equal 100% (aka Free Casting in those schools).\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION: Just extract the rar it into your Skyrim/Data and you should be ready to go. If not make sure it is checked in the \\\"Data\\\" section of your skyrim launcher.\r\n\r\nHope you Enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
