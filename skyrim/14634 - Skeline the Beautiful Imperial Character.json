  "descriptionHtml": "An Imperial with maxed out skills and levels and isn\\'t bad to look at either. Plus this is an alternate start as she is not dragonborn\r\n\r\nBackstory: Skeline used to work in the imperial city at the King and Queen Tavern. During this time she was taught by an assassin named Hashrin who was a master of all skills after finding the Ohgma Infinium. Therefore Septimus Signus (a resident in the imperial city at the time) thought that Hashrin was getting to powerful and stabbed him in the chest with a dwarven sword, then ran off to Skyrim with the book. When Skeline next went to see Hashrin for training all she saw was a half dead man with a dwarven sword next to him, he then muttered the name \\\"Septimus Signus\\\". Skeline then picked up the sword and followed his tracks to Skyrim. Septimus may have gone crazy after that and may not even remember what happened but Skeline, does.\r\nI Know Dramatic ( I\\'m not the best at writing backstories )\r\n\r\nInstalling Place Skeline.ess and Skeline.ess.bak into your C:\\\\Users\\\\(Your User)\\\\Documents\\\\my games\\\\skyrim\\\\saves\r\n\r\nTo get what you see in the screenshots you will need these mods:\r\n\r\nPretty Face Pack by tktk1 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7887\r\n\r\nApachii Sky Hair by Apachii - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\n\r\nCaliente\\'s Body Mod (CBBE Curvy edition) by Caliente - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=8685\r\n\r\nCaliente\\'s Vanilla Armor Mod by Caliente - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12273",
