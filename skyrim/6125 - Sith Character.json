  "descriptionHtml": "my interpretation of a skyrim-sith character. feel free to change him using the \\\"showracemenu\\\" command. He has a two handed variant of the red lightsaber if you need it. I \\'psb-ed\\' this character, meaning he has all spells shouts and words (sorry if i ruined it for you). i also gave him relatively good clothes/armor stats, he is level 5 i believe and has just talked to Gerdur. he has the upgrade enchated weapons/armor perk (sorry again). Enjoy!\r\n\r\nRequired mods:\r\n\r\nMagicka Sabers by Lord Haun \r\n\r\nrecommended mods:\r\n\r\nJoO Jedi Robe by xxxNEOxxx\r\n(for a possible jedi character)\r\n\r\nBe a better mage with unique spells by concept 83\r\n(for fans of conjuration)\r\n\r\n--read various mod descriptions for info as to using them\r\n\r\n",
