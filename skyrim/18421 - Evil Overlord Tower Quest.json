IT MEANS A LOT TO ME\r<br />\r<br />EVIL OVERLORDS TOWER \r<br />Is perfect base of operations for evil character. But to get this tower you need to defeat current overlord which is very strong. But even after getting his tower you still need to find his artifacts to get his power as well. Mod is follower freindly since your followers can follow you to you HQ and have their special small bar where you can leave them (I tryed to make this HQ look as much as the Overlord tower from game called Overlord 1)\r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />I cannot continue work on this mod cuz lack of time and ideas. So if anyones interested in continuation of this mod please tell me\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------------\r<br />About Mod Interiors\r<br />----------------------------------------------\r<br />Tower is made from 5 parts\r<br />-Main hall (Portal to Skyrim, Doors to Tresure room, Overlord Quaters and Follower Room)\r<br />-Overlord Quaters (Crafting workshops, Werehouse for materials and small garden and shrine)\r<br />-Follower Room (Bar where you can leave you followers and sell stolen goods)\r<br />-Tresure Room (Mannequins, Weapon and shields displays, book cases and biiiiiig Vault for gold)\r<br />-Dungeons (Mostly for decoration since I cant do scripting) They were requested a lot\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------------------\r<br />Mod features\r<br />--------------------------------------------\r<br />-Quest to take over overlord tower and after that get artifacts to get overlords powers as well (Its not normal quest. You need to follow clues to complete it. You meet first clue when you go to Dragon Reach. Assasin will have the note. Bounty letters with clues to artifacts are located in Whiterun in bannerd mere)\r<br />\r<br />-9 Followers (Demon, Werewolf, Ghost, Assasin, Fanatic and Vampire, Headless Knight, One of your mistresses and Khajit) (IF YOU PLAY AS EVIL CHARACTER)\r<br />\r<br />-14 followers (10 protectors which are very strong, Kuroi Orb, Khajit and headless Eddy plus 1 mistress follower) IF YOU PLAY AS A GOOD CHARACTER\r<br />\r<br />-Snack for vampire in HQ\r<br />\r<br />-Special enchantments in overlord armor (MAY NOT WORK SO SAVE OVERLORD ARMOR)\r<br />\r<br />-Bounty hunting for 16 powerful enemies (Bad guys)\r<br />\r<br />Bounty hunting for 11 Powerfull servants of Overlord but they dont like each other (Good guys)\r<br />\r<br />-Portals to all provinces from the tower once you take it over\r<br />\r<br />-Summon able minions. Best to play with unlimited conjuration mods if you want more than 1 XD\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------\r<br />BONUS Dark Orb Underground\r<br />---------------------------------------------\r<br />Remaked version of Dark Orb Guild mod what makes their base in Blackreach. Its like extra city in Blackreach with few shops and patrols all over the place to protect you. If Dark Orb members die then they wont respawn. So better protect them if you want them to serve you longer (Followers are essential)\r<br />\r<br />-11 Bosses \r<br /> *Bleakfalls\r<br /> *Thalmor Embessy\r<br /> *Behind Whiterun where Bandits camp\r<br /> *Near Riften. At fort where they keep Pit Wolves\r<br /> *Markarth underground city\r<br /> *When you go to dvemer ruins while you wanna get Elder Scroll\r<br /> *Ratway Vaults\r<br /> *The place where you learn that Companions are werewolves\r<br /> *The big cave where Falamer live. Its on Riften territory near Windhelm territory\r<br /> *??? (In ruins but you have to find out yourself. There are 2 bosses and they the strongest ones)\r<br /> *???\r<br />\r<br />(Also 5 of the bosses got parts of Assasin outfit (Nightgale outfit but for assasin and sneaky players) and his weapons)\r<br />\r<br />-Many new followers in Blackreach and most of the taverns\r<br />-New items\r<br />-New spells\r<br />-New food\r<br />-New shop keepers\r<br />-Freindly Blackreach. Now you will have additional patrols to help you there\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------\r<br />BONUS esm GreyFaceFix\r<br />---------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />-It does remove ugly grey faces from my NPC. So follower Khajit for Example will be looking like a tiger now rather than gray cat :) ALso girls in this mods will look a little better. If you have any questions please PM me. Took me a while but I managed to find a good toturial how to avoid grey faces in Skyrim NPC creation\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Requierments\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Skyrim 1.4 or better\r<br />\r<br />Best to play with unlimited conjuration (Optional)\r<br />I also suggest mods like Wandering Nazguls and Daedric Agents so you wont fell too strong or lonley in this dangerus world\r<br />\r<br />-------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Mod History\r<br />-------------------------------------------------------\r<br />v5\r<br />-Version for good players.

For good ones those heroes would be followers to collect in Scalet Tavern but you would have to save them from being killed by evil forces\r<br />\r<br />Sugesstions would be appriciated ;) Except those for new interiors. I dont want make tower too big\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------------\r<br />My requests\r<br />---------------------------------------------\r<br />-If you like this mod please endorse so I know if its worth to continue.
