  "descriptionHtml": "A dark and realistic cave I made, as I give a break from Sungarde.\r\nWARNING: This mod is not compatible with any mod that changes the landscape in the area between Largashbur and Dark Tower.\r\n\r\n                                  ****\r\n\r\n  There is an old tale in Riften about a character named king Hraasil, the seventh son of a seventh son who usurped the throne some generations ago. According to the original story, which has been sung by the bards throughout the rift, he was a vampire who killed and drank the blood of his three brothers and three sisters to seize the control of the realm.It is told that Hraasil embalmed their bodies and hid them with some of his private treasures in a cave close to a river, in the west of the hold. Although the existence of the cave was confirmed, nobody has ever found a trace of Hraasil´s brothers´tomb and his treasure. \r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\nFEATURES\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n                              \r\n Hraasil Cave is supposed to be like many real-life caves: dark, wet and full of rocky formations (stalactites, columns and travertines).   \r\n\r\n There is a barrel at its entrance: pick up the torches, you will need them (the cave is VERY dark!). Most of the cave is natural, with scarce human traces on it--- I added some bedrolls, you can go there whenever you need a place to sleep. Nice for vampire and undead characters!\r\n\r\n Only the most clever cave explorers will be able to find the secret tomb where King Hraasil´s treasure was hidden. But watch out: there may be something nasty there, much worse than the spiders and mudcrabs!\r\n\r\n NOTE: Hard to find? The barrel outside the cave provides a tip!\r\n**********************************************************************\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n - Extract the \\\\\\\"Data\\\\\\\" folder to your \\\\\\\"The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\\\\\\\" Folder\r\n\r\n - Add a check to \\\\\\\"Hraasilcave.esp\\\\\\\" to activate the mod--- and play!\r\n\r\n To find Hraasil Cave start from Riften and head to southwest. I included a screenshot with its location here.\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\nUNREALISTIC HRAASIL\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\n In case you like my cave´s design but you don´t rock the darkness, there is an alternative file in the \\\\\\\"UNREALISTIC\\\\\\\" folder. It is the same cave, the only difference is that you can see everything, no torches required unless you use a mod that makes vanilla caves darker. To use it, just replace Hraasilcave.esp with the one contained in that folder.\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\nKNOWN BUGS/ISSUES\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\n  Companions will not follow you into the cave (a common bug in new dungeon mods). YOU SHOULD REPORT ME ANY BUG YOU FIND!\r\nYou may use and redistribute this mod or any of its parts since you give the right credits.\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\nCHANGELOG:\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\n-Fixed two small cracks at cave entrance\r\n\r\n-Improved cave clutter\r\n\r\n-Fixed Hraasil unrealistic bug that makes it dark\r\n\r\n-Increased amount of gold in treasure",
