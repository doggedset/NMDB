  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first public mod release, so enjoy. I’m not so great at taking screenshots of the weapons in game. If you have any skill at this I would appreciate it if you could take a few screen shots of the weapons in game and post them up on this mod’s page. \t\r\n\r\nUpdate 7/15/2012\r\n\r\nVerson 1.1 update\r\n\r\nAdded a new sword called \\\"Dawn Breaker\\\" 1 handed under Diadric Smithing. Can be crafted at any forge and also improved aswell.\r\n\r\nAlso upped the damage on other weapons slightly seeing as the materials to craft them were higher end so I felt it was only fitting to up the stats a little.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts on the damage increase .\r\n\r\nThis File so far adds 3 Weapons\r\n\r\n1x Branch of the God\\'s, Polearm *2hander uses 2handed axe animations that work out well with kill moves after playing around with the model for a few tries*\r\n\r\n1x Cutting Moon Kama. Can be Dual Wielded or used as single weapon instead of a pair.\r\n\r\n1x Assassin Blade *fist weapon for thrusting and slashing.\r\n\r\nI probley need to tweak the stats but let me know what you guys think is a good place to get them too im working on another model atm as well.\r\n\r\na\r\n\tTools used for the mod: \r\nPhotoshop,3DS Max,Niftools, Creation kit.\r\nShout out to the people that enjoy the mod and the nexus community.\r\nBethesda for the game and the tools \r\n\r\n\r\nI\\'m not sure what all to write in this section but this I hope will do for now.",
