  "summary": "Changes the height of the third person camera for the \\'dragon\\' race , so it is no longer in the floor upon changing. Could be useful for filming or just fun.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a third person camera to the dragon skeletal mesh. This gives the illusion of changing the height of the third person camera for the \\'dragon\\' race, upon changing. Works for most angles, however, the dragon tends to disappear closer to horizontal angles. Uses loose files.\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure how to change to the dragon race, just makes sure the console is enabled. Press the console key(`or~ depending on keyboard layout) and type in \\\"player.setrace dragon\\\" (without the quotes).\r\n\r\nPlease do not claim this idea as your own, it was just something I stumbled upon that happened to work.\r\n",
