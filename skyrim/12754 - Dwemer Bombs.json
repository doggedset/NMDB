  "modName": "Dwemer Bombs",
  "summary": "New Dwemer Bombs. This mod adds new bomb types ranging from fire, ice, electric, poison, paralysis, force, and holy. You can learn how to create them with the new perks or buy them from Markarth or traveling merchants. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "* Check out the videos*\r\nThis mod adds Dwemer Drop Bombs able to be crafted or bought from merchants(Markarth & Khajiit). It also adds 11 new perks. Dwarven Mechanics branch (smithing), Dwarven Templar (restoration) & Dwarven Biobombs (alchemy). Can be dropped from horses!\r\n\r\nSpecifically you can create fire, ice, electric, poison, paralysis, force, and holy bombs. Each have seven different grades ranging from weak to very strong. \r\n\r\nThere are 11 new perks added.\r\n-Dwarven Mechanics 1-5 (gyro bombs)\r\n-Dwarven Advanced Mechanics 1-3 (dynamo bombs)\r\n-Dwarven Master Mechanics (centurion bombs)\r\n-Dwarven BioBombs (adds poison and paralysis bombs)\r\n-Dwarven Templar (adds holy bombs)\r\n************************************************************************\r\nBomb Grade Strengths - Price (larger price bigger boom!)\r\nCenturion (strongest)\r\nDynamo (Strong) - Each have 2 grades, check price for difference of strength\r\nGyro (Weakest) - Each have 4 grades from weakest to strongest Price holds strength differences\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there was not an area where a description could easily be added directly to the item -not in the title- but I will likely add a Dwemer Bomb Crafting cook book for a more detailed description in future versions. \r\n**************************************************************************\r\nThese bombs can be crafted or bought. When you drop them make sure to get away or nudge them forward so you will be out of range of the explosion! \r\n\r\nAs a gift, there is a bundle of Force Bombs in Dragon\\'s Reach.\r\n\r\nNeed dwemer crafting supplies, visit Markarth or Khajiit merchants. Smiths now have tongs and hammers needed to create gyros and dynamo cores... \r\n\r\nAlso try out Bomb Bowling! Drop, nudge and roll and see if you have what it takes to be a Master Bomb Roller!\r\n\r\nThe No Perk Tree Version -\r\nThis is the same as the above but does not add a perk tree or branch as to not overlap any other mods you currently have. It still requires you to have Dwemer Smithing, Alchemy for poison/paraslysis, and Restoration for holy - but only their novice levels. \r\n\r\n",
