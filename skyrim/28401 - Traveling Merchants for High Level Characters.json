  "descriptionHtml": "At this point use the new merchant MCM mod.  This file is obsolete.  That mod hits what I was trying to achieve.  The only difference is this mod adds followers (all female) that will buy and sell to you.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nBubinga\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple mod.  Just an esp that adds a few traveling merchants to the game that have more gold than the vanilla merchants.  Some travel, so you have to find them.  They all run on different schedules and travel to different towns.\r\n\r\nThis mod is something I wanted in my game.  I made it and have been using it so I also figured I would share it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt adds 5 merchants to Skyrim each with 10,000 gold.  The merchants are standalone so the other vendors in the game will not be affected.  There\\'s one in Whiterun that walks around and hopefully keeps busy and another in Windhelm.  Let me know if you see them standing around like they have nothing to do!  The other three travel from inn to inn.  You can bump into them on the road inbetween towns as they travel to and fro.  I have.\r\n\r\nThere is also an optional download in which the merchants will have a Vanilla gold limit.  1,000 gold each.\r\n\r\nI purposely made it so its tough to bump into more than one so it wouldn\\'t break the game too much, but it\\'s a relief when you do find one and can unload a few more items.\r\n\r\nThey are all able to be followers and will trade with you while you travel.  It works very well with Amazing Follower Tweaks.\r\n\r\nThis mod will not work with any mod that changes the spaces where they start.\r\n\r\nOpen Cities is definitely not compatible as well as any mod which modifies their spawn areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements:  ApachiiSkyHair\r\n\r\n",
