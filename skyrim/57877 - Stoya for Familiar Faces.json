  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve updated the file for FF 1.1.3 - Her game is also now finished, so she is the dragonborn and everything else, she is also now a vampire and is wearing [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49939]Lustmord Vampire Armour[/url], unless you don&#39;t have that installed in which case she will be nude likely.\r<br />\r<br />Warning : will likely be nude without whatever mod I have my characters wearing. these are my characters I still play with, and I use cool armors from nexus modders which is why I share them, because I don&#39;t have the patience to get heavely into modding, so I do this to give back.Furthermore: I don&#39;t know if body type or textures make any difference if you have them installed or not so I will just list what I used to create them. My game isn&#39;t heavily modded, mostly I like armors and followers.\r<br />- I use xp32 maximum extended skeleton\r<br />- Unp BBP body\r<br />-Apachii skyhair\r<br />-sg textures and eyebrows\r<br />\r<br />INSTALL MANUALLY - readme is in the folder, it&#39;s very simple\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Old Version-\r<br />-Red Head Freckled Blue Eyed Level 57 Nord\r<br />-an epic archer\r<br />-two handed and block and sneak\r<br />-was never much for the magic\r<br />-Werewolf/Stormcloak/ hasn&#39;t yet went after Alduin\r<br />-despises Thalmor\r<br />-likes to sit by the tree in whiterun and stare at the stars\r<br />-enjoys sneaking through dungeons, loves it when she&#39;s killed   someone who didn&#39;t even know she was there.\r<br />-Her best friend in Skyrim during her game are Sofia and Sighne\r<br />-She uses Sword of Tongues and Great Sword of Tongues, the only  mod weapons in her inventory.\r<br />-Apachii Sky Hair\r<br />-Dragonbone Barbarian Armor ( which gives her a fuller figure as I  opted for UNP Skinny for my game install because I prefer little  bewbz, but I like her in this armor )\r<br />-Ultimate Assortment, she likes to wear earings\r<br />-She&#39;s also a fan of Fecklemania, and no more blocky faces\r<br />- I dunno if it matters or not but I use XP32 maximum skeleton\r<br />- obviously Familiar Faces is required at the time I uploaded this I was using Familiar Faces 1.0.5.  \r<br />\r<br />So, besides the hair and freckles she&#39;s pretty much vanilla made, very first time/try character I&#39;ve spent most my time playing as. Familiar Faces is great to allow me to be able to share her so easily as I am a little lazy atm for creation kit. I was pleasantly surprised to see as a follower she tends to stay out of your way unlike most followers, and will use her bow from strategic places as in screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Recommended Mods :\r<br />Dragonbone Barbarian Armor ( I imagine she&#39;s be unclothed without this installed )\r<br />Frecklemania\r<br />Sword of the Ancient Tongues\r<br />Apachii Sky Hair\r<br />No More Blocky Faces\r<br />XP32 Maximum Skeleton\r<br />Dimonized UNP Skinny Body",
