  "descriptionHtml": "Changes a few landscape and plant textures so they have summer hues instead of the default autumnal colours.  This is a personal project and may not be to everyone else\\'s tastes, but I hope someone out there gets some enjoyment from it.  Also the LOD for basic ground is still orange as I can\\'t work out how to change it, so it will cause some contrast.\r\n\r\nYou can use any of the textures as they are just Beth\\'s originals with the hues changed.\r\n\r\nTo install: Extract the Zip archive to your data folder.\r\n\r\nI discovered after making this that there is already a mod out there that does something similar called \\\"Summer in Skyrim\\\".  SIS seems to have greenified everything more extensively and I actually prefer it.  It can be found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2818&navtag=file/images.php?id=2818&tab=3",
