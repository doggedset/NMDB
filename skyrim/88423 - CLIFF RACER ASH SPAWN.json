  "descriptionHtml": "Stupid joke mod.\n<br />\n<br />While Cliff Racers may be extinct in Vvardenfell, the mantle of a really annoying enemy that seems to be lurking around every corner and just won't die enough seems to have been passed down to the Ash Spawn.\n<br />\n<br />This mod retextures the Ash Spawn with a god-awful Cliff Racer texture, and replaces all sounds (including footsteps) with Cliff Racer noises.\n<br />\n<br />Ash Spawn weapons are also retextured to (vaguely) look like Cliff Racer wings, so that'll probably affect any \"usable Ash Spawn weapons\" type mods. If that matters to you.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />EEOOOOUUU WWWWA MEEUUUOOOOO",
