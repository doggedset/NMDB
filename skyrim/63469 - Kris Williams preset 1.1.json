  "descriptionHtml": "===DESCRIPTION===\r<br />This mod is a racemenu preset for the female nord (your character MUST be a female nord) that includes the very close likeness of the lovely and gorgeous Kris Williams from the hit SyFy channel reality shows &#34;ghost hunters&#34; and &#34;ghost hunters international.&#34; She is probably the most famous and desirable female cast member of the &#34;ghost hunters&#34; reality television franchise and has been featured in several notable &#34;sexiest 100 women in the world&#34; lists throughout the years and was even once interviewed on playboy radio.\r<br />\r<br />Most people (especially men) would agree that Kris was one of the most stunningly beautiful women on all of reality television, unfortunately she decided to leave the show after ghost hunters international was cancelled in 2012. Which essentially means that millions of heterosexual men will miss seeing her.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]===INSTALLATION===\r<br />[b]Step 1.
