  "descriptionHtml": "2/11/2013 Lord Banewrath Sunblade\r\n\r\n      This mod adds a brand new hammer to the skyforge weapons set! The weapon is sold by the skyforge smith and can be upgraded. the hammer is a brand new model with a new custom texture to fit skyrims steel weapon set. This is a lore friendly weapon and could pass for something that was included in the stock game. \r\n\r\n  To install just drag and drop the esp and bsa to your data folder and to uninstall delete those two files. Check out my other mods. You may see something you like.\r\n\r\n    You may not alter or use my models in other mods without permission. You may translate the mod to your language\r\nand upload it to your national modding site. ",
