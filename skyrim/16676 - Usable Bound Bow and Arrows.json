  "summary": "This is a simple mod i made... It simply Adds Usable Bound Bows and Arrows o.o this is 1 of my 1st few mods and i havent rlly looked to see if some one else has made this mod but this 1 is rather simple just drag and drop into your skyrim/data and it should work",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my 1st mod so be gentle lol this mod adds a new bow and a new set of arrows wich as the title sais its the bound bow and arrows these are craftable at any forge the bow is under deadric and the arrows are under misc o.o warning these weapons are slightly over powered moreso focused on the mid lvl range 10-30 they are rather strong so i made it so that the materials to make the ammo and the bow are hard to come by o.o such as to make 50 arrows u need 5 firewood and 50 void salts o.o granted ik void salts are hard to come by but dont forget that i give u a starter 1000 arrows lol so i hope u guys enjoy this mod and i will be uploading more soon :) (i will also be adding all bound weapons to this mod in future updates\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />if u have any problems with the mod or suggestions plz leave a comment and i will reply shortly im ussualy on this sight every day stalking for new mods lol  and if ur having troubles finding the bow and arrows read the read me lol\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts: if u have a breeze home mod that the creater coppied the player chest that the game gives u then u might have a duplicated amount of arrows as i simple copied the player chest so any breezehome mod that has several player chests in the home will most likely have the bow and 1000 arrows stashed in it lol.... do not fear i will put up a patch for this soon it just depends if i feel like gettig on CK but if u like that many bows and arrows (depending on the amout of chests) then feel free to keep the original version",
