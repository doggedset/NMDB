  "summary": "An enormous bath-house complex beneath Whiterun filled with female followers and some of their servants. This mod has 26 followers in it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "UPLOAD YOUR PICS IF YOU\\'VE TAKEN ANY, PLEASE AND COMMENT/ ENDORSE AND WHATEVER...\r\n\r\n[SIZE=5][B]2/2/13:[/B] So I tested out the mod on my own game and it seemed to run perfectly fine. I did find that a lot of the followers were in the spa, which is to the left of \\\"The Deep End\\\" if you go into it from the foyer where you enter from Whiterun. If you could please be a bit more specific about what is going wrong in your game then that would be helpful![/SIZE]\r\n\r\n2/2/13: I have read the replies from you guys concerning the followers not spawning and I think I know what the problem is. It might be that the mod has not been updated to the most recent patch, I will try doing so and seeing if it works. Sorry about this!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 7/30/12: Elmanouche was nice enough to let me use his/her body types for some followers in the current version. These body types are applied only to three new followers so don\\'t worry about a follower you liked getting a new body type.\r\n\r\nElmanouche\\'s body mod is here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8873/\r\n\r\n7/21/12: 21 Endorsements! Yay!\r\n\r\n7/9/12: Added new version of main file (not foggy), that has the face data of the followers.\r\n\r\n7/9/12: Because there have been complaints about CTD errors and face bugs I have uploaded a version that has increased fog to spare your GPU. Will fix the head bug in the main version soon.\r\n\r\n7/9/12: Version 3.0 is here. The HQ now holds 26 followers in total, has blackreach access, a forge, an armory, and a luxury bedroom complex. Also, be on the lookout for secret passages, try near the statues.\r\n\r\n7/9/12: Okay so I just have to finish up a few more things for V. 3.0 and it will be all set. There are some preview images up right now.\r\n\r\n7/8/12: The next update will include werewolf and vampire followers and since Amazing Follower Tweaks allows for the followers to fight as werewolves I\\'m adding it to the list of required mods in preparation for the next update.\r\n\r\n7/6/12 (not at 3AM): >10 endorsements? Booyah! Thanks people!\r\n\r\n7/6/12: Yay! 1000 Downloads! Thanks people!\r\n\r\n7/2/12: Just about finished with version 2.0. Should be up in a few hours hopefully.\r\nEDIT: The mod is up and hopefully running bug-free. Any issues, please leave a comment.\r\n\r\n6/29/12: Ok, after a lot of confusion since this is my first mod. I believe that I have successfully updated this to version 1.2 where the character\\'s faces should be the right colors and look the right way. *Whew* If there\\'s any problems then just leave a comment.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease comment and endorse if you like this. I would really like to know if this sucks or doesn\\'t or whatever.\r\n\r\nThis was totally inspired by the mod: Bathing Beauties or Beefcake - Luxury Suite by Migal\r\nLink: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11427\r\n\r\nBecause who doesn\\'t like admiring the female form with the addition of a pool?\r\n\r\nWhat is the point of this mod?:\r\n-The same one as Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball: Look at the pretty girls.\r\n-To give you a place to use ASX a whole lot ;p.\r\n-To add a pool to the game.\r\n\r\nWhat do I need for this to run correctly?:\r\n- You will need apachii sky hair: \r\n---> http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\n- I strongly reccomend using \\'Amazing Follower Tweaks\\' since the mod works very well with that one in particular but it shouldn\\'t be mandatory.\r\n---> http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15524\r\n\r\nDoes this include nude mods?:\r\n-No it does not, if you do not have any already downloaded then the characters will not be nude. I personally use CHSBHC-BBP with modified body types and textures that I can\\'t quite remember the names of.\r\n\r\n-I feel this is the best way to go so that people can use whatever nude mods they want with this mod, because I\\'ll admit that the way the girls look in the pictures is un-realistic but it\\'s a fantasy game so who cares?\r\n\r\nVersions:\r\n-One with the girls (standard)\r\n-One without the girls\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n1.) Download the file you want.\r\n2.) Extract the esp into your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n3.) Fill in the check box for the mod in the Game\\'s Launcher.\r\n4.) Done.\r\n\r\nUn-installation:\r\n1.) Find the esp and delete it.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n-CTD on load (Moving the mod up in the load order should fix this)\r\n-Discolored Faces (Should be fixed in 1.2)\r\n-May cause a CTD during the quest where you return Esbern to Riverwood.\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\n-Build Your Own Home\r\n-LC Become King of Riverhelm",
