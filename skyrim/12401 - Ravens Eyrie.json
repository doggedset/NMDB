After renovating, she named it Raven\\'s Eyrie. \r\n\r\nRaven\\'s a bit eccentric, living in her tower in the wilds near Solitude. Most of her neighbors are quiet, once she assured them that she doesn\\'t believe in Talos. And, since they ended up being some of her biggest clients, it\\'s a good thing she\\'s just down the road from them.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n--------\r\nIf the hints given in the description weren\\'t enough, ask me privately. Raven\\'s Eyrie isn\\'t hard to find...\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\nSkyrim updated current update.\r\n\r\nFuture Additions\r\n----------------\r\n- Add the basement.\r\n- Give the player a quest that deals with what can be found below ground. \r\n- Voice acting to Raven.\r\n- Make lighting more realistic. \r\n\r\nVersion History\r\n---------------\r\n1.0 Initial Release\r\n1.1 Hopefully fixed the disappearing tower bug\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs and Conflicts\r\n------------------------\r\nnone current",
