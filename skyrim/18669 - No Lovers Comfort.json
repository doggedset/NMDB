  "descriptionHtml": "In short, this mod prevents you from getting bonus experience from Lover\\'s Comfort buff. \r\n\r\nI play with reduced levelling mods, so I don\\'t like any bonus experience, and I didn\\'t find any mod removing this single buff. \r\n\r\nPlease note I\\'m in no way a modder, and couldn\\'t figure how to prevent the buff to be cast on the player. I just switched its duration from 8 to 0 hours. (For this reason, you\\'ll still get the message about getting the buff, but you won\\'t see it in the active magic effects tabs). \r\n\r\nINSTALLATION: just drop the .esp in your \\\\skyrim\\\\data folder and enable it. Load order shouldn\\'t matter. ",
