  "descriptionHtml": "Hey everyone. I got tired of using the \\\"setessential\\\" command every time I started a new game so I made this and figured I\\'d share it with everyone.\r\n\r\n-Description-\r\nThis is just a small mod I made that makes all companions essential because I hated it when my companions would rush in and get brutally slaughtered... :P \r\n*Also a few non-companion NPC\\'s are affected as well*\r\n\r\nAnyway here is my current list of affected characters\r\n1. All Housecarls\r\n2. All members of the Companions\r\n3. The College of Winterhold companions\r\n4. All Hirelings\r\n5. All Miscellany Followers *not including dogs*\r\n6. All members of the Khajiit caravans\r\n\r\nI\\'ve only checked the essential boxes for each character and have not changed anything else.\r\n\r\nIf I\\'ve missed any important NPC or you would like to one added just put them in the comments section.\r\n\r\nOh and I know there are probably a couple of these already on the site so please leave those comments to yourselves. Thank you.\r\n\r\n-Version-\r\n1.0 - Initial Release\r\n1.5 - Added Blacksmiths *had this on the wrong mod description*\r\n\r\n\r\n-Credits-\r\nBethesda - Skyrim and the Creation Kit\r\nNexus Team - Giving modders a home :)",
