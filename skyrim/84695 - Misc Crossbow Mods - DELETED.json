  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]Description\r<br />[/u][/b]This is a few mods i made to enhance crossbows for Skyrim. There&#39;s a few mods out there that do similar things so there&#39;s nothing new or revolutionary here but i still won&#39;t play without these mods in my mods list.\r<br />You&#39;ll need the Dawnguard DLC to use any of them.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]CrossBow Leveled Lists\r<br />[/u][/b]This mod adds crossbows and bolts to some leveled lists to integrate them into the game naturally.\r<br />\r<br />[b]changes[/b]\r<br />Most city guards now carry the basic version of the steel crossbow as well as some steel bolts.\r<br />Some bandits with high leveled loot may have a basic steel cross bow and bolts or a basic dwemer crossbow with some dwemer bolts.\r<br />Some weapon or general merchants may now have either dwemer crossbows/bolts or steel crossbows/bolts.\r<br />Some dungeon chests may have basic steel/dwemer crossbows or bolts.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Things not changed\r<br />[/b]No changes to the crossbow stats were made.\r<br />You cannot find any enchanted or enhanced version of the crossbows outside of what was already there. To gain enhanced crossbows you still must complete the Dawnguard radiant quests given by Sorine. \r<br />\r<br />All of these are set around 10% chance on par with all other loot items meaning you&#39;ll find them every once in a while but not enough to break immersion. \r<br />\r<br />The mod has no scripts so it&#39;s safe to install-uninstall at any time.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Unlock all Crossbows\r<br />[/u][/b]This mod removes the special requirements for the crossbows. You can now make steel/dwemer crossbows at any time as long as you have the corresponding smithing perks unlocked. This mod makes it possible to craft the enhanced version of the crossbows as well. You&#39;ll need a normal version for the corresponding crossbow first to make an enhanced version.\r<br />\r<br />In addition i added crafting recipes for bolts. Normal steel and Dwemer crossbow bolts can be made in batches of 24 (exactly like arrows) and the enchanted versions (Fire, frost, and shock) can be made in batches of 10. \r<br />\r<br />All items can be crafted at the smithy forge and upgraded at the grinding wheel. \r<br />\r<br />This mod contains no scripts and can be installed-uninstalled at any time.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Ebony Dwemer Crossbow\r<br />[/u][/b]This one actually started off as a simple re-texture but i eventually made a standalone version of the crossbow.\r<br />It&#39;s a version of the enhanced Dwemer crossbow crafted in the ebony smithing section. Aside from being a couple of points higher in damage it&#39;s also much lighter. It can be crafted at any time assuming you have the Ebony smithing perk.\r<br />\r<br />In addition it has custom bolts. The bolt stats are made to work with the mod ABT (Arrows and Bolt Tweaks 50% preset). I religiously use this mod so i adjust any of my arrow/bolt mods to match. The ebony bolts can be crafted in batches of 24 and are 50% faster then vanilla bolts but the exact same speed as ABT&#39;s 50% preset.\r<br />(Note ABT is NOT required to use this mod, the stats are simply adjusted to match what you&#39;d expect when using ABT)\r<br />\r<br />They also do a couple more point of damage then the standard Dwemer bolts. There are no versions of the enchanted ebony bolts just the single one.\r<br />\r<br />No scripts are included in the mod so it&#39;s safe to install/uninstall at any time. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
