I will do it myself when I have the inclination and the opportunity.[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />I'm sorry if this decision disappoints you, but I would like to be responsible for my own mod pages and how the mods behave in the game. \n<br />\n<br />I have no idea how my mods for Oldrim will work in SSE, even after conversion, and I want to have a proper handle on that [i]myself [/i]before I put them out there for other people to use in their games.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Thanks,[/size]\n<br />[b][font=Georgia][color=#B45F06][size=3]Auri[/size][/color][/font][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Details\n<br />=======\n<br />This mod replaces Durnehviir's meshes and textures with those of Zerofrost's Thanatos dragon, which was originally an Odahviing replacer. This mod can be used alongside Zerofrost's original mod, so you could technically have TWO Thanatos dragons in your game at once!\n<br />\n<br />Or, if you like Zero's Behemoth Odahviing, you could have both Thanatos and Behemoth simultaneously.\n<br />\n<br />There are two options: one for the regular striped version and one for the copper skin.\n<br />\n<br />ZEROFROST GRANTED ME PERMISSION TO USE THESE MESHES AND TEXTURES. I didn't make them, I just renamed them. ;)\n<br />\n<br />Install\n<br />=======\n<br />1. Extract the files to a temporary location.\n<br />2. Copy files to SteamSteamappscommonSkyrimData\n<br />\n<br />Uninstall\n<br />=========\n<br />Delete meshes and textures added by this mod.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Incompatibility\n<br />===============\n<br />Any mod that alters Durnehviir's meshes and textures.\n<br />\n<br />Known Issues or Bugs\n<br />====================\n<br />Durnehviir still has his particle effects, but now it looks less like dripping slime and more like he's losing his scales. :P It's barely noticeable, so I don't see it as an issue.\n<br />\n<br />History\n<br />=======\n<br />1.0, 2013/05/03 - Initial release.\n<br />\n<br />Contact\n<br />=======\n<br />Leave a comment or send me a PM.\n<br />\n<br />Credits\n<br />=======\n<br />Thanks to Zerofrost for the original Thanatos meshes and textures, as well as giving me permission to use them.\n<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\n<br />Thanks to SkyrimNexus for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\n<br />Thanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\n<br />\n<br />Tools Used\n<br />==========\n<br />7-Zip - http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=15579\n<br />NIFSkope - http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope\n<br />Readme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\n<br />\n<br />Licensing/Legal\n<br />===============\n<br />(Copy-pasted from Zerofrost's original mod)\n<br />\n<br />\"I don't want any part of this mod being modified and/or used in other mods and games without my consent.\"\n<br />\n<br />As this mod uses Zero's work, please respect his wishes.",
