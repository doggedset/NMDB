  "descriptionHtml": "I was originally going to do a full, from scratch Telvanni tileset based on the meshes from Dragonborn, however due to several factors I won\\'t go into, I am going in a different direction and will not be working on Telvanni architecture any longer. \r\nAs such, I have no reason to horde the meshes I did finish and present them here as a modders resource for folks wanting to make more elaborate Telvanni towers or cities. I apologize for the paucity of the selection, I didn\\'t do as much as I had hoped to do, but I know the fine folks here will find some use for them.\r\n\r\nDragonborn is required for textures, the textures included are amateurish transition textures used exclusively on the shelf fungus pod mesh. \r\n\r\nAll meshes and textures can be used freely as long as I am credited as the creator of the meshes. \r\n\r\nhappy mushroom farming!",
