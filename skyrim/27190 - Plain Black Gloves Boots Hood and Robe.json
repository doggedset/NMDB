  "descriptionHtml": "There are now black gloves, black boots, black hood and black robes.\r\nAll items are ready for enchanting.\r\n\r\nCrafting requirements: \r\nGloves Require 1 Leather, 1 Leather Strips.\r\nBoots Require 1 Leather, 2 Leather Strips.\r\nRobe Requires 1 Leather, 1 Leather Strips and 5 Tundra Cotton.\r\nHood Requires 2 Leather Strips, 3 Tundra Cotton.\r\n\r\nNothing amazing just a retexture of Bethesda\\'s in-game Gloves, Boots, Apprentice Robe and Hood.\r\n\r\nThere are some clipping issues with the gloves and hood which was present in the original. In fact the hood is actually a problem with ONE of the hairstyles in the game - is there for all the mage hoods. If anyone could fix that, I would happily update and release a fix for the original brown ones as well.\r\n\r\nLike I said, there\\'s nothing special about this but the outfit \\\"works\\\" and is good for when you\\'re low level but don\\'t want to look really stupid... as mages\\'s do at low level usually ;)\r\n\r\nPlease Endorse if you find it useful.",
