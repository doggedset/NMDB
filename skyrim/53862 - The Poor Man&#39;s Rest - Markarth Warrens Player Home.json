  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=red][b]The Poor Man&#39;s Rest - Markarth Warrens Player Home[/b][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />[i]&#34;You don&#39;t want to be here. No one wants to.&#34;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />But sadly, you don&#39;t have a choice. The Warrens in Markarth is where you go if you can&#39;t afford a bed, food or even clean drinking water. The Silver-Blood family has finally cleared out one of the rooms after a rock collapse, leaving another room free for a dirty beggar or a coal-stained laborer. Garvey has lost the key somewhere though... \r<br />\r<br />This mod simply adds in a small room for the player in the Warrens. It doesn&#39;t have everything a Dovahkiin desires, but it does has everything a poor man needs to survive a night in  Markarth. This is great for people who are playing a beggar or poor character, or for people who just want a free bed in Markarth without all the bells and whistles.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Full Features:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />* Two beds, both player owned\r<br />* Storage chest\r<br />* Alchemy table\r<br />* Unique clothing (head and arm bandages) for humanoids and Bosmer\r<br />* Cooking pot\r<br />* And completely free\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Installation[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Just download and drop the file into your data folder.\r<br />Or just use the NMM. \r<br />To uninstall, just remove the file. \r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]====[b]Compatibility[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Compatible:[/i]\r<br />Pretty much everything. I have not yet found a mod that edits the Warrens.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Incompatible:[/i]\r<br />Anything that changes or adjusts the blocked off room in between Cosnach and Eltry&#39;s room\r<br />\r<br />color=darkorange]=====[b]Permissions and Credits[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />This mod is not to be uploaded anywhere but the Skyrim Nexus. Please report to me if you see this anywhere else.\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating a great game and letting us fiddle with it. \r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Thanks for reading and check my page for more mods&#33;[/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7065334/?tb=mods&pUp=1 ] [IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/2dryws3.png[/IMG][/url]",
