  "descriptionHtml": "hi guys\r\n\r\nso the idea of the damage-dealing shield pleased me but it was too weak to be useful, so i decided to \\\"upgrade\\\" it. And i also did a little repainting on the HD texture provided by bethesda to make the shield black (so now it matches with my armor :p)\r\n\r\nIt can seem too overpowered but i\\'m using it with my lvl 50 character with master difficulty and it\\'s not gamebreaking at all.. If you want it less powerfull just ask, it\\'s not very long work...\r\n\r\nWHAT IT DOES:\r\n\r\n-The enchantement is *much* more powerful, now it deals 50 damage for 4 seconds instead of 3 damage for 5 seconds...\r\n-Recolors the shield in black (optional, the original texture is provided if you prefer the original)\r\n-This mod only change the enchantement, not the [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Targe_of_the_Blooded]location of the shield[/url]\r\n\r\ni know it isn\\'t much but mb someone there likes this shield as much as i do. if you have anything to say, good or bad, feel free to pm me.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I added a few variants of the [dmg*time].esp that speak for themselves (20x5 is 20 damage for 5 seconds). BUT i haven\\'t tested them all (too long/too boring) so if there\\'s a problem just yell and i\\'ll fix it! ",
