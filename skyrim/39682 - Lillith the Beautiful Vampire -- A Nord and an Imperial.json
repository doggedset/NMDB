The source of her Vampirism was being bit at an age of 18 after being captured by an elderly vampire. She was off in the forest picking berries as her mother and father -- young and in love smiled as she skipped and held hands -- when all of the sudden they were attacked in broad daylight! Fear shot through Lillith\\'s eyes and confusion was brought upon her father as he pulled his sword from his seethe still carrying it from his days as a Blade. And attempted to thrust it forward at the vampire, but he had not reacted quickly enough and his throat was torn open and his wife\\'s chest ripped into a big gaping hole. The Vampire hadn\\'t noticed the girl and brood on the idea of taking her under his wing standing there for a long-long while. Eventually he approached the little distraught girl and took her into his arms and dashed off to his castle to raise her as his own. Which brings us to the present day of Lillith\\'s life when she approaches you offering her services for an unknown reason, you of course graciously accept and allow her to follow and protect you. \r\n\r\n[color=red]\r\n____________________________________________________\r\nVersions:\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n[/color]\r\nV.1.1\r\n\r\n[color=grey]\r\n____________________________________________________\r\nTo-Do-List:\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n[/color]\r\n1) Add catch-phrases\r\n2) Get a Female Voice Actor\r\n3) Develop a Quest Line\r\n4) Turn this mod into a Quest\r\n5) Re-vamp for more awesomeness\r\n\r\n[color=orange]\r\n____________________________________________________\r\nUpdate(s):\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n[/color]\r\nNone so far\r\n\r\n[color=grey]\r\n____________________________________________________\r\nInstallation(manual):\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n[/color]\r\n1) Install the Required mods to skyrim\r\n2) Download the Lillith Zip\r\n3) Extract the folder to your desktop\r\n4) Go to your Skyrim Data Folder\r\n5) Drag & drop the .esp into there\r\n\r\n[color=red]\r\n____________________________________________________\r\nRequired/Recommended Mods:\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n[/color]\r\nRequired -- \r\n1) [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666/?]CBBE body[/url]\r\n2) [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url]\r\n3) [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589/?]Natural Eyes[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=red]\r\n____________________________________________________\r\nCredits:\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n[/color]\r\nBody - Caliente - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666/?]CBBE body[/url]\r\nHair - Apachii - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url]\r\nEyes - nevenbridge - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589/?]Natural Eyes[/url]\r\nDesigner - AlduinV3\r\nCreation Kit - Bethesda\r\nSupport - Enoomnai\r\n[color=orange]\r\n____________________________________________________\r\nLocation:\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n[/color]\r\nLillith is located inside the Four Shield Inn, in Dragonsreach. \r\n[color=grey]\r\n____________________________________________________\r\nNote(s):\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n[/color]\r\nI plan to be having a buddy help me start working on the quest part of this mod soon, seeing as I am still fairly new to modding, I asked for his aid.
