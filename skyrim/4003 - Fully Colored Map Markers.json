  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]Description[/size]\r\n\r\nFully colored all the map markers except those undiscovered locations. You can see a great difference from the map after you reach the location.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your suggestions. Especially some ideas are really appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\nSorry for my English. :) Some colors I am not sure how to describe. But you can see them in the newly uploaded pictures.\r\n\r\nBtw, I haven\\'t edit any gfx files, so these new icons will not display on compass. I will try to make this surport showing on compass in the future version.\r\n\r\n\r\nv2:\r\nRed: Dragon Lairs (the color of fire)\r\nBlack: Caves (no light or less light)\r\nGrey: Tombs and Ruins (the color of stones)\r\nSea blue: Lighthouses and Ships (the color of sea)\r\nCambridge blue: Towns and Palaces\r\nDeap bule: Holds\r\nAmber: Stables, Houses, Windmills and Mines\r\nWine red: Shrines (the color of Oblivion)\r\nDeep brown: Watch Towers, Gaint Camps and Orsimer Camps\r\nBrown: Dwemer Ruins (the color of part of the walls)\r\nDeep Green: Natural Sightseeing (the color of nature)\r\nBeige: Doors\r\nWhite: Imperial and Stormcloak Camps\r\n\r\n\r\nv1:\r\n[s]All the holds use blue.\r\nPalaces and town use blue green.\r\nUnderground locations such as tombs, ruins and mines use orange.\r\nPasses and graint camps use green.\r\nCaves and caverns use deep green.\r\nSmall villages, windmills and stables use yellow.\r\nDragoin Lairs, shrines and guardian stones use red.\r\nWatchtowers and all kinds of forts ues brown.\r\nLighthouse and boats use purple.\r\nMoreover, doors use steel green.[/s]\r\n\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\n[size=5]Recommandation[/size]\r\n\r\nI strongly recommand everyone to use Skyrim Compass Tuner with my mod together. The latest version 2.0 can be used to disable and enable any map marker on the map, which make the locations much easier to be found.\r\n\r\nHere is the link: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=912\r\n\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\n[size=5]Installation[/size]\r\n\r\nExtract the map.swf to your Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\interface, overwrite files if asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5]Uninstallation[/size]\r\n\r\nJust remove it.\r\n\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\nI was inspired by Colored Map Makers mod. So I wanna still give a credit to Forsaken32!\r\n\r\nFeel free to leave your comments and hope you guys like it :)\r\n\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\nQ&A\r\n\r\nQ: Will this be compatible with 3D Map mod?\r\nA: Yes, because this mod has nothing to do with skyrim.ini.",
