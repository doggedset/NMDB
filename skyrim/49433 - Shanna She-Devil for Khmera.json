  "descriptionHtml": "[size=8]BRAND NEW TEXTURES&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/description.jpg[/img]\r<br />This outfit was inspired by the comic book, Shanna She Devil, published by Marvel Comics. Yes, there are forsworn skins and fur outfits already in Skyrim. But not like this.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/location.jpg[/img]\r<br />In the depths of Pinewatch Bandit Sanctuary&#39;s secret treasure room lies arguably the sexiest cavegirl outfit you&#39;ll ever see this side of Tamriel.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/installation.jpg[/img]\r<br />Unrar the archive and place in &#34;Data&#34; folder. If you have any conflicts or issues with any aspect of your game upon installing this mod, please uninstall using the same method, but backwards.\r<br />\r<br />Please be aware this outfit is for the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48406/?]Khmera[/url] body style, which is a UNP-based body. It is compatible ONLY with a UNP-type skin textures such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30181/?]Navetsea UNP[/url],  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32986/?]Mature Skin[/url], etc. The outfit is not for CBBE, Pandora, and Ladybody-type bodies, as they use a different UV to map their textures.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/credits.jpg[/img]\r<br />I must thank my friend and fellow artist Hongyu for his help and permission to use parts of his model [url=http://www.daz3d.com/hongyu-s-bikini-for-v6]&#34;Hongyu&#39;s Bikini for V6&#34;[/url]currently available for Poser/DAZ3D. \r<br />\r<br />I also wish to express my gratitude to Bethesda for the original models used to create the subsidiary parts of the costume.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/permissions.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />You may not upload, or distribute any parts of this Skyrim mod without the expressed permission of myself and any other authors who have contributed to the creation of this mod.
