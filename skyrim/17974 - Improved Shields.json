  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]Improved Shields, Version 0.9a (Beta)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Improved Shields&#34; is a small, simple mod that fixes the problem of static bashing damage by scaling it as is done with other forms of combat in Skyrim. Bashing damage depends on a character&#39;s block skill and the type of shield equipped. An adjustment to lower the amount of stamina used for bashing is also included, five percent regardless of skill or player level.\r<br />\r<br />This mod attempts to replicate the Weapon Damage Formula as well as possible in the interest of balanced combat. Currently, shield bashing damage with &#34;Improved Shields&#34; scales one percent per level. It is determined according to the following formula: [i]damage = bashing base damage * (1.01 * skill) + shield base damage * perk effects[/i] where &#39;perk effects&#39; only applies if the character has Deadly Bash, and &#39;shield base damage&#39; is comparable to a mace&#39;s base damage - or half of a shield&#39;s armour rating.\r<br />\r<br />Future plans for the mod:\r<br />-Scale stamina use for bashing to block skill\r<br />-Make damage determined by armour rating a seperate variable from damage determined by shield material (currently packaged as &#39;shield base damage&#39;)\r<br />-Remove enchanting limitations from shields to include offensive spells activated on bash\r<br />-DOUBLE SHIELDS\r<br />\r<br />[b]This mod is currently in BETA but fully usable. Input on eveness of combat mechanics and bug reports (ex.: missing scaled base damage for certain shields) are appreciated.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />RELEASE NOTES\r<br />31/05/2012 - v0.9 original release\r<br />01/06/2012 - v0.9a fixed bug, damage modifiers did not apply correctly\r<br />27/03/2014 - v0.9b perks are now passive and don&#39;t require scripts, damage modifier simplified, stamina modifier packaged into BetterBash perk",
