  "descriptionHtml": "Version 1.4 added (Delete or overwrite the old file)\r\n\r\n• Added the Werewolf transform power to Dovahkiins Savage Beast.\r\n• Three items to choose from including original hood and two rings.\r\n• Cleaned up all descriptions.\r\n• New File mirror added.\r\n• Password removed for convenience.\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3 (Old Update)\r\n\r\n• Specific ring request (Hircine\\'s) added.\r\n• New item added called Dovahkiins Savage Beast. \r\n• Slight adjustments to the new ring shout recovery rate, around 75%. \r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nCraftable items with zero Shout recovery time\r\nI\\'ve made a mod called Dovahkiin Eloquentia to allow you to reduce Shout recovery times to nothing basically giving you continual shouts. This mod doesn\\'t need console commands or a .bat file to use and doesn\\'t change anything else. The items can simply be equiped and unequiped like anything else in the game. Only one of the the crafted items will be needed for the full effect, so I\\'ve given the player the choice of a ring as well as a hood incase you don\\'t want to change the way your character looks.\r\n\r\nIn game requirements\r\nYou only need to have the Archane Blacksmith perk in smithing to be able to craft these items, plus the materials which are freely available. The reason I did this was so you won\\'t be overpowered when you start a new game, you will still have to play the game to a certain level in order to get the items. \r\n\r\nThe Crafted items, the item names and needed mats \r\nSilver ring - Dovahkiins Silver Tongue - 1 x Silver bar\r\nSilver ring - Dovahkiins Savage Beast - 1 x Silver bar\r\nHood - Dovahkiins Blessing - 1 x Leather\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\nJust like most other mods all you have to do is extract the .esp file to the Skyrim data folder. For me thats C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data . When you start Skyrim just make sure that the \\'DovahkiinEloquentia\\' is checked in your data files and your good to go. To delete the file just go back to your Skyrim data folder and delete the DovahkiinEloquentia.esp\r\n\r\nAs far as I know this is the first Mod to allow you to reduce shout recovery times to zero with a crafted item. \r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think and if I\\'ve missed anything.... First Mod so feel free to comment on how I can improve it etc.\r\n\r\nEnjoy",
