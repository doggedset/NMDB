  "summary": "A small mod that adds a new Dark Elf follower to the game. He can be found in the Sleeping Giant Inn.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Lythis, a Dark Elf Nightblade follower, can be found in the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. He is equipped with full leather armor, except for the helmet, which has been replaced with a brown hood. He can use either his two daggers, bow, spells, or whatever you decide to give him. Note that he is good with one handed weapons, light armor, bows, and spells. So make sure that you only give him items that fall under that category. He also does not have much of a moral standing, so you can have him attack NPC&#39;s, steal things, or just pick up that item that&#39;ll definitely not trigger any traps.\r<br />\r<br />He only uses vanilla dialogue, which I do not plan to change at the moment, due to how it is not possible for me.\r<br />\r<br />Also, the mod is in beta at the moment, so there is some bug fixing and balancing to be done. If you find a bug, or want to even suggest something, email me at schrecknj@gmail.com.\r<br />\r<br />I do plan on making more mods, some larger and some smaller than this one. But this one is my first, so any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. Emphasis on &#34;constructive&#34; part. Please do not send any hateful messages.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
