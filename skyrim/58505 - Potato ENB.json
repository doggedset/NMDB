  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://puu.sh/bQ4BS/aa7ff353df.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Potato ENB is an ENB that I(Örvar &#34;Wheeze&#34; Arnórsson) made for myself and I&#39;m releasing it now in order to celebrate me getting 4000 followers on my [url=http://www.twitch.tv/wheeze202]twitch channel[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Not much effort has really been put into the ENB, no ENB out there really suited me so I decided to make my own. The general idea is that it&#39;s very performance based, no fancy ambient occlusion, AA, sun rays etc. And it basically keeps a vanilla look to the game but just compliments the lighting, no drastic stylistic choices.\r<br />\r<br />And if you are wondering about the name: I just don&#39;t really care about the name and I named it the first thing that popped into my mind.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]In order to install just download the original ENB from [url=http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.html]ENBSeries[/url] and extract the d3d9.dll file from the Wrapper version. Put all downloaded files and the d3d9.dll into your skyrim folder.[/b]",
