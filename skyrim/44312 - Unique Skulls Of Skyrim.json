  "descriptionHtml": "Scattered across Skyrim are a highly desirable and collectable collection of 875 Skulls. Hidden in plain sight, no one seems to know where they came from, although there may be a clue on a decapitated skeleton in the Midden Dark. \r\nYou may find them in ruins or dungeons or mines or in the abodes, habitations and on the persons of the good and bad people and creatures of Skyrim. Some may be scattered high in the mountains or in the wilds. \r\nBeautifully defined and each one unique they make a fine adornment to any Dovahkiin player home.\r\n\r\nIdeal for any stage of play through. A scavenger Hunt of epic scale. \r\n\r\nThis mod is compatible with all other mods, and is not demanding on your computer. \r\n\r\nNo DLC required. \r\n\r\nAs usual I recommend the mod \\\\\\'Unlimited Bookshelves\\\\\\', which will make it easier to place these wicked Skulls neatly on the shelves ;) \r\n\r\nThey can be divided clearly into five collections or other collection variables of your choosing, but these main five groups are in prescribed areas as follows:\r\nThe Dunlain Collection are found in the easiest to find places, in the city centres in plain sight. \r\nThe Black Collection are located upon persons (for pick pocketing or more merciless methods), \r\nThe Green collection are situated in more far out places. \r\nThe Blue and red collections for slightly more locatable skulls, but more far out than the Dunlain collection\r\n\r\nI have also created a space to display them you an find it here on the nexus or on steam: Dovahkiin Sanctuary. \r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=180415260 \r\n\r\nI have added a book by request in the Midden Dark which lists the skull names, it is with the Green collection. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has a problem with the textures try thinking with your eyes and not a technical mind. If you take a paper and blot a shape by folding it does not the spaces define the shape, although simple it\\\\\\'s an art. None of the skulls have see through bits.\r\n\r\nHappy hunting.",
