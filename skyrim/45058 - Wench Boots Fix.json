  "descriptionHtml": "There was something bugging me in vanilla Skyrim: I play an unarmed/unarmored build, as a Khajiit bard, and I happened across some boots that looked completely perfect for the character - the ones that show up in your inventor as long, lace-up knee boots, listed in the Creation Kit as being part of the bar wench outfit. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately Bethesda hates casual crossdressing, and when applied to male characters these boots turn into a pair of Redguard boots instead. This mod corrects that. It\\'s horribly petty and I\\'ve only ever seen one person ever asking for it, but hey. Three minutes of work in the Creation Kit, and no possible conflicts given it\\'s just a simple model switch.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there\\'s some minor clipping due to differences between male and female body meshes, but with no real knowledge of modelling I can\\'t really fix that.
