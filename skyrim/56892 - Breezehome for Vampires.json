  "summary": "A simple mod that changes Breezehome to be fit for a vampire.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod replaces the double bed in the upstairs of Breezehome for a coffin, for people who like to play as vampires, and also adds three interactive blood kegs that can be used to get blood potions.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility: [/b]Unlikely to be compatible with any other mods that change the layout of Breezehome.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation: [/b]Make sure that before you install you have bought all the upgrades for Breezehome, except for the alchemy lab / child&#39;s bedroom (it doesn&#39;t matter whether you have bought that yet or not).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Updating to version 1.1: [/b]Uninstall the old version via NMM, then install the new one, making sure you are not in Breezehome when you do these steps.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installing Update 1.3 (1.2 is now obsolete): [/b]Download the update, activate it in NMM, and when asked if you want to update choose &#39;no&#39;. Then when asked if you want to overwrite the esp &#39;Breezehome for Vampires&#39; select &#39;yes&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Note: [/b]If you notice a vase on the ground floor clipping with the blood keg, just remove it (pick it up, you don&#39;t even need to use the console). Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t remove that one in the CK, but it may not be a problem for you. Also you may find two random cups on the first floor next to the low table - just remove those too, for some reason I couldn&#39;t get rid of them either.\r<br />\r<br />REQUIRES DAWNGUARD&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u]To those using version 1.1 or above, READ THIS - VERY IMPORTANT&#33;&#33;[/u]\r<br />There are a couple of things I was unable to do myself in the creation kit (I tried, dunno why it didn&#39;t work :s ) so you will have to do these few things yourself when you install the mod.\r<br />1) The weapon plaque on the wall behind the double bed (now a coffin) clips with the new upright coffin it&#39;s been changed to. You&#39;ll have to open the console to remove it. There are three parts to the weapon plaque, each part you click on first type &#39;disable&#39; to make sure you&#39;ve selected the right thing, then type &#39;markfordelete&#39;.\r<br />2) I couldn&#39;t figure out how to make the corpse &#39;dead&#39;, so you&#39;ll have to kill her youself. She&#39;s very low levelled so should be easy, then you can position her body across the table. (This is irrelevant for versions 1.2 and up as the corpse has been replaced with a thrall)\r<br />3) For some reason the bloody silver ewer keeps jumping of the shelf, so you&#39;ll also have to reposition that. I had it on the top shelf next to the bloody silver goblets.\r<br />That&#39;s all, enjoy&#33;",
