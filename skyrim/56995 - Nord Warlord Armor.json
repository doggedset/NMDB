  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][size=5]==Nord Warlord==﻿\r<br />[/size][/b][/center]\r<br />[b][size=4][center]== Description ==[/center][/size][/b]\r<br />A early Nord-inspired armour, made out of vanilla pieces and some Witcher 2 assets (thanks to LordOfWar). Fully weight-slidered, and for both genders. The cuirass is the same for both genders, as I went for a more manly sort of look. It has some nice warm pants, however image 3 is before they were added. Keep warm in the frozen wastes&#33; If you would like to use this in your mod, please contact me first and get permission.\r<br />\r<br />The set includes a cuirass, gloves, boots, a helmet and a cape. All pieces can be crafted at a forge once steel smithing is unlocked. The stats are around ebony.\r<br />\r<br />There are two esps included, one with just the armour, and one with leveled lists included. USE ONE ESP ONLY.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4][center]== Installation ==[/center][/size][/b]\r<br />Unzip into data files or install using Mod Organizer.[center][b][size=4]== Changelog ==\r<br />[/size]   ﻿Version 1.0, release\r<br />[/b][b][size=4][/size][/b][/center][b][size=4][center]== Credits ==[/center][/size][/b]\r<br />Thank you to Bethesda for a great game.\r<br />Thank you to CD projekt, the makers of Witcher, and LordOfWar for importing their work and properly rigging it for Skyrim.\r<br />I wish I could play their great games, but my computer isn&#39;t good enough : (\r<br />\r<br />[i]\r<br />Please endorse&#33;[/i]",
