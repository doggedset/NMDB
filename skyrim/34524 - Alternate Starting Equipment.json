Now this heavy armor choice was usually the heavy Imperial set, but that didn&#39;t bother me much at the time. \r<br />\r<br />Lately, however, I have wanted something that didn&#39;t have a factional bias to it (no mater how much the game doesn&#39;t care), in addition, I got sick and tired of having to go to Riverwood right away when playing a mage (and I almost always play a mage of some kind) to get any additional spells beyond the starting &#34;Flames&#34;, &#34;Sparks&#34;, and &#34;Healing&#34; plus &#34;Conjure Familiar&#34; if you&#39;re a Breton and &#34;Fury&#34; if you&#39;re an Altmer. So I decided to make one more to my current tastes.\r<br />\r<br />I tired to keeps things reasonable and balanced for a starting player. With that in mind, this mod adds a chest, labled &#34;Confiscated Items&#34;, to the cage in the Torture Chamber at Helgen. Inside the chest is a complete set of Iron Armor (same armor value as Imperial Heavy armor) minus the shield, since there is an Iron Shield nearby already. Also, a set of light armor made up of Studded Armor, Fur Shoes, Fur Bracers, and a Fur Helm (same armor value as Imperial Light armor) plus a Hide Shield. \r<br />\r<br />Under the counter are three spell books. These are &#34;Oakflesh&#34;, &#34;Conjure Familiar&#34;, and &#34;Fury&#34;. If you are playing a Breton or Altmer, one of those books won&#39;t do you any good, but the &#34;Sparks&#34; book put there by the devs doesn&#39;t help a Dunmer either. There are no mage styled clothes since all you have to do is pick a novice lock to get a mage robe and hood (plus the &#34;Sparks&#34; spell tome) in the same room. \r<br />\r<br />I decided not to add any weapons since, by the time you exit the starter dungeon, you should have at least one weapon to suit your needs and desires.\r<br />\r<br />Just in case you have a &#34;Starting Equipment Mod&#34; that you prefer, I have made an alternate version that only adds the three Spellbooks.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Install\r<br />=======\r<br />Place the plugin, &#34;AlternateStatingEquipment.esp&#34; (or &#34;AlternateStatingEquipment-OnlySpells.esp&#34; depending what version you are using), in your &#34;Skyrim/Data&#34; directory. Use NMM or the Skyrim Launcher to activate the mod. Use only one version or the other.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall\r<br />=========\r<br />Remove the plugin, &#34;AlternateStatingEquipment.esp&#34; (or &#34;AlternateStatingEquipment-OnlySpells.esp&#34;), from your &#34;Skyrim/Data&#34; directory.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts\r<br />=========\r<br />The only mods that will conflict with this one will be ones that add items to the same locations that the chest and spellbooks occupy.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues or Bugs\r<br />====================\r<br />None at this time.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />=======\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r<br />Thanks to the Nexus for the a one-stop-shop resource for mod authors and players.\r<br />This mod was done by me, because I wanted it.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks",
