  "descriptionHtml": "I have always hated the master illusion spells in Skyrim. They were disappointing. \r\n\r\nThis is a simple mod that changes the master Illusion spells to ranged AoEs instead of AoEs centered on the caster. In turn though, the ranges have been reduced. The ranges are 3/5 of what they used to be(used to have ranges of 250, now has ranges of 150). The Call To Arms spell has been untouched. You probably won\\'t need it ranged anyway. \r\n\r\nPlease tell me what you think of the mod in the comments, and report any bugs that you find. \r\n\r\nKnown Issues: \r\n\r\nThe spells equip in both hands just like they are supposed to, but the casting animation only shows one hand casting. If anybody knows how to fix this please help me out.",
