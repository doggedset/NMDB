  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve merged the esp files from Alrock10&#39;s compound bow collection and tweaked a few things here and there in the crafting menu to be more lore friendly. \r<br />\r<br />11/29/14  Important: Consider this mod COMPLETE. 2.0 is the final version. Thank you to everyone who has downloaded and endorsed this mod.\r<br />\r<br />Also, I have added an optional .esp file for compatibility with most sorting mods out there. They will now be displayed as &#34;Compound Bow- xxxxxx&#34; and  &#34;Bow- xxxxxx Recurve&#34; as well as &#34;Arrow- Black Dragon.&#34; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE 2.0:\r<br />1)  Incorporated descriptor fix into main esp. Messages about &#34;critical chance&#34; will no longer display. Player enchantments will.\r<br />2)  Added Alrock10&#39;s two recurve bows to the collection after obtaining permissions. Optional file is now a merge for Alrock10&#39;s original mod ONLY , unedited and untweaked. \r<br />\r<br />Full credit goes to Alrock10 and the contributors to his mod. Original mod here: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35051/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35051/[/url]\r<br />Recurve mod here: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48635/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48635/[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Please take the time to visit his mod page to endorse and get the original files if you need them, but please endorse the original mod.\r<br />\r<br />Changes and tweaks to the original collection:\r<br />1)  Merged the 10 (or was it 11 ?) esps into one file.\r<br />2)  Removed the &#34;invisible&#34; bows in the Predator file that just didn&#39;t show up in 1st or 3rd person. Salvaged the Predator bow.\r<br />3) Tweaked the crafting materials, requirements, and damages to give the remaining 9 bows and arrow set separate tiers of crafting and damage as well as more lore friendly. See below.\r<br />\r<br />Tweaks:\r<br />All of the original bows were under the Dwarven menu in crafting and could be crafted at any time. Damage output was mostly uniform. \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve distributed these bows throughout the material requirements, changed the crafting material requirements to fit and match the visuals as closely as possible, and added perk requirements to make them more lore friendly. Damage output now scales with the equipment class they are in.\r<br />\r<br /> Listed per perk requirements. Fully Enchantable.\r<br />\r<br />Wood ------ Wood Compound Bow. 20 damage base. Can be crafted from the start. \r<br />Steel---------Simple Compound Bow: 25 base damage\r<br />Elven---------Bow Zingler : 30 base damage\r<br />Dwemer------Metal Compound Bow: 30 base damage                                   \r<br />Orcish--------Carbon Fiber: 40 base damage\r<br />Advanced----Predator: 40 base damage                                             \r<br />Glass---------Dragonskin: 50 base damage, 2x critical hit chance\r<br />Ebony--------Ebony Compound Bow (simple metal in original): 50 base damage, 2x critical hit chance        \r<br />Arcane + Ebony------ Elder Compound Bow: base damage 70, 3x critical hit chance\r<br />\r<br />Added with 2.0.\r<br />Dwemer----- Dwemer Recurve Bow: 30 base damage\r<br />Elven-------- Recurve Elven Bow: 40 base damage\r<br /> \r<br />\r<br />Black Dragon Arrows------Smithing of 50 or higher. 24 base damage\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />OPTIONAL file is a merge of the original file for Alrock10 and those who want it.
