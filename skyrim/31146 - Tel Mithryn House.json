  "descriptionHtml": "A new house added in Tel Mithryn, it\\'s yours. The other one you get isn\\'t really yours. You just have access to it, but the Steward uses it. It\\'s pretty much the steward house but redone with a double bed and some other stuff. It also edits the area around Tel Mithryn and edits the Navmesh, so your followers can use the House. I made it kind of bare so you can decorate it. Anyways, enjoy!\r\n\r\nAlso, if anyone knows scripting, I would like this house to be accessible once you become a member of House Telvanni, so if anyone can help me with that please tell me.\r\n\r\nAll containers are safe to store stuff in.\r\n\r\nNot compatible with any mods that alter the exterior of Tel Mithryn, I can however, make one that is, but it won\\'t include Navmeshes for compatibility.\r\n\r\nRequires Dragonborn.",
