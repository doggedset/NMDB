  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=Yellow]Comments and suggestions are welcome. Please endorse if you like it.[/color] [/heading]\r\n[color=Red]I will update this this summer[/color] \r\n\r\n[font=\\\"Arial\\\"]What i\\'ll try to do next:[/font] \r\n-Divide all the smithing tree into 3 or 4 branches:\r\n1. Weaponsmithing\r\n-Will include previous perks for weapon smithing and a perk to learn new shematics for weapons only.\r\n-Maybe more perks\r\n2. Armorsmithing\r\n-Will include previous perks for armor smithing and two perk to learn shematics for light armor and heavy armor.\r\n-Maybe more perks\r\n3. Arcane blacksmithing\r\n-Add more levels, making it looking like:\r\nLvl 1: Can improve enchanted items but 50% less\r\nLvl 2: Can improve enchated items but 90% less\r\n-Maybe more perks\r\n4. Smelting and Mining\r\n-A perk to mine faster\r\n-A perk to get more ore from mining\r\n-A perk to get more ingots from refining ores like: Lvl 1: 2ingot/3ore and Lvl2: 1ingot/1ore\r\n-Maybe more perks\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n-Maybe add crafting recipes found in books to make already enchanted armor.\r\n-Also when you begin to smith you don\\'t know how to craft armor or weapons so to get the recipies you\\'ll need at least 20 in smithing.\r\n-I\\'m planning to make a version for people who use skill uncappers\r\n-I\\'m planning to make it more balanced (Cause it ain\\'t balanced that much :P)\r\n\r\n[color=Yellow]You have something you\\'d like me to add to this list?
