  "descriptionHtml": "Features. \r\n\r\nNew Location: Squire\\'s Den\r\n3 New Followers:  Ray, Jakob, Panza \r\nRadiant quests: Bounty quests\r\n\r\nFollower Traits\r\n\r\nRay\r\n\r\n-Bard:  You can place her in your house and she will take requests.  She will also play the Lute, Flute, and Drums like all other bards.\r\n-When entering a new region she will check for local bounty quests for you and offer them in dialog.\r\n-Paladin fighting style (sword, board, healing, and defensive spells)  \r\n\r\nJakob\r\n\r\n-Brute: You can Brawl with him.\r\n-When entering a new region he will check for local bounty quests for you and offer them in dialog.\r\n-Prefers Two-Handed combat and has learned a shout to disarm his opponent.  \r\n\r\nPanza\r\n\r\n-Stealth:  She is trained in stealth combat and can give you a few pointers.  \r\n-When entering a new region she will check for local bounty quests for you and offer them in dialog.\r\n-She will not set off traps and is fond of ranged attack.  \r\n  \r\nSquire\\'s Den Includes: \r\n\t-Inn, Merchant, Blacksmith\r\n\t-Trainers; One-handed, Archery, Blacksmithing, Sneak \r\n\t-Crafting; Blacksmith, Alchemy, Enchanting\r\n\t-Safe Player storage; The empty barrels and chest around the crafting tables.\r\n \t-Pleasant atmosphere \r\n\r\nWarnings/Conflicts \r\n\r\n1.  Ray does not have a set home location.  If you ask her to leave she will stay at that spot.  This allows you to place her in your home as a Bard.  \r\n\r\n2.  This may conflict with mods that alter player homes.  I changed the stats of player homes to make them an Inn (This allows Ray to play free of charge).  This effects the homes in, Whiterun, Winterhold, Riften, Markarth, Solitude, and the Arc-Mages loft.  I use most of the popular mods out there, but I can\\'t check them all.  Please be advised.    \r\n\r\n3.  I\\'m Just One Guy.  If you find any bugs please let me know in a civilized manner and I will try my best to fix the problems.  If you tell me how awful of a person I am and how you\\'re going to kick my dog, I\\'m just going to ignore you.     \r\n\r\nFuture Plans:  Mod specific quests and Dialoged.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy, please rate and comment. \r\nAny feedback is appreciated. \r\n\r\nThis is my first mod to Nexus, I have made a few for the Steam Workshop, but did not feel they were up to Nexus standards.  I\\'m still new at this but I just wanted to give back to the community.  \r\n\r\n1.0.1 Update: No longer needs Dawnguard to run.  \r\n1.0.2 Update: Bug Fixes\r\n-Fixed an Issue where \\\"Bounty Quest: Bandit\\\" was not being given as an option  in Squire\\'s dialog. \r\n-Cleaned up dialog for Ray.   \r\n",
