  "summary": "Chadeaux my favorite follower:)",
  "descriptionHtml": "Chadeaux was my first male player character under the name of Aries. He\\'s a heavy hitter with a sword (he comes with a daedric sword of sparks and daedric bow of sparks) and a decent archer.He also is a marriage option as well. This was a request from my peers and my first published mod:} So please be gentle on me:) I\\'ve tested repeatedly on my computer with zero issues, hopefully it runs as smoothly for you:)\r\n\r\nThere are a few must have mods for this, just for the look to be correct you should have the following mods...\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488 BetterMales Beautiful Nudes and Faces, use the Younger Faces Merged with Men by Geonox. For the body use the same BetterMales mod FavoredSoulMeshes body of your choosing.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13076 Cute Eyes 115X Makes the iris in the eye bigger to escape the tiny eye look.\r\n\r\nInstallation: \r\nNMM installation is recommended now that it works:)\r\nManual, put the Chadeaux.ESP file in your skyrim/data file. The textures and meshes files drop into the Skyrim/Data file in textures and meshes. Hopefully you know the drill:) Open the Nexus Mod Manager to make sure the plugin is active and if you are running UFO make sure Chadeaux plugin is after UFO in the load order.\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\n NMM simply just delete mod.\r\n Manual, Delete Chadeaux.esp file from Skyrim/Data file. Delete Chadeaux.esp in Data/textures/actors/character/FaceGenData/FaceTint file. Delete Chadeaux.esp from your Skyrim/Data/Meshes/Actors/Character/FaceGenData/FaceGeom file. Win.\r\n\r\nChadeaux can be found in Jorrvaskr in Whiterun on the main floor.\r\n\r\n************ Don\\'t forget Immersive Armor:) Chadeaux needs his favorite Armor:)******************\r\n                        [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19733] Immersive Armor by Hothtrooper44[/url]\r\n                                                                          [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/e2fKl.jpg[/IMG]\r\n               \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.0a file: I\\'m adding for those of you that aren\\'t running UFO or other follower customization        mods that allow you to change the armor of your followers. I put Chadeaux in just clothes. This file also doesn\\'t require the ApachiiSkyHair mod now.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n Version 1.1  : I removed the ApachiiSkyhair Parent Masterfile from this mod so it should run with out it.\r\n Version 1.1b This file removes the 30 level cap on Chadeaux. IF YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED THE PREVIOUS FILE ( 1.0 or 1.1 )TAKE WHAT EVER ARMOR OR OTHER THINGS YOU HAVE GIVEN HIM, DISMISS HIM FROM YOUR PARTY THEN SAVE. YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE A SAVE WITHOUT CHADEAUX MOD ENABLED TO RESET THE PREVIOUS 30 CAP TO WHAT EVER YOUR CHARACTER IS. ENABLE CHADEAUX MOD AND MEET HIM BACK AT JORRVASKR.\r\n\r\nARIES SAVE GAME\r\n\r\nOptional: I posted a save game for him under the name of Aries as that is his player character name. I have him at the point of the game where you run for cover after the chopping block in Helgen. I highly recommend using these mods for results like the pictures:\r\n[http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14539] Flans Eyes For Skyrim by DarNilavu\r\n[http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13970] Wyldtats Warpaint Edition by Wyldsong\r\n[http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/download/26469] Younger faces merged with Men by Geonox \r\n[http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488] and Better Males FavoredSoulMeshes body of your choice.\r\n Installation: Un-zip file and put Aries Save in Documents/MyGames/Skyrim/Saves file. \r\n\r\nSharpshooter\\'s Extreme Graphics Vision ENB used in all of the pictures",
