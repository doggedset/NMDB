  "descriptionHtml": "Old Kingdom Manor is a player home that is situated outside the city of Whiterun not far from the stables.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Master bedroom for the player.\r\n- Room for the included companion, Hayley Vas Boom & a housecarl, Delia Well-hide.\r\n- Many storage chests and safes.\r\n- Several Mannequins (or wax figures as I call them).  Two of which, are for helmets/circlets only.\r\n- A cellar with a smithing forge, workbench, sharpening wheel, tanning rack, and more.\r\n- Customized Ancient Draugr Armor by Therminblack which I modified to fit a custom body preset of mine.  Female only. (ARMOR IS RECOMMENDED FOR ADULT PLAYERS ONLY.  DISPLAYS NUDITY)\r\n\r\nHow to Acquire:\r\n\r\nNo special steps at the moment, just walk right in.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n- I\\'d HIGHLY recommend installing XP32 Maximum Skeleton ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26800 ) for use with \\\"Hayley\\'s Ancient Draugr Armor\\\" included in my mod because it uses breast and butt bones which will probably crash your game if you don\\'t.  For the butt bones to work, I think you\\'ll also need a mod like LeCid\\'s \\\"TBBP animation of Dragonfly with butt bounce\\\" ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34713/? ) because the animations support the butt bones.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE THE INCLUDED ARMOR.  IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE THE ARMOR, BE SURE TO USE OPTIONAL FILE #1, \\\"No Draugr Default\\\"\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n- 5/29/13: Uploaded two new esp versions; \r\n     1) \\\"No Draugr Default\\\" removes the included armor from Hayley as her default armor.  This is to avoid any crashes for people to don\\'t have the necessary skeletons.  \\\"Hayley\\'s Ancient Draugr Armor\\\" still exists in the game though.  You can find it in the big chest by the front door, if you decide later you wan\\'t to install the skeleton and use the armor.\r\n\r\n     2)  \\\"No Residents\\\" removes Hayley and Delia from the world and releases ownership of their beds so that the player may move in his/her own followers.\r\n\r\nNOTE: DO NOT ACTIVATE MORE THAN ONE (1) VERSION OF THE ESP FILE.  CHOOSE EITHER THE ONE IN THE MAIN FILE OR ONE OF THE TWO OPTIONAL VERSIONS.\r\n\r\nStill to come:\r\n\r\n- Quests related to the home and it\\'s residents, Hayley and Delia.\r\n- More decorations.\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\n\r\n- Outside of the home near the back, you may experience followers or other NPC not being able to proceed through a certain spot.  That is because the navmesh outside the home near the rear has a fairly big gap.  For some reason, this sometimes happens to me when creating or editing vanilla Skyrim exterior navmesh.  If I ever find a solution, I will surely fix it.  For now, just try to get your follower to run around the house in a different direction, which they will probably do anyway by default.  Just a heads-up.\r\n\r\n- If any mannequins (wax figures) are out of place, just equip them with something and in most cases, this will move them back to where they belong.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\n- Thanks to Therminblack for letting me modify his Ancient Draugr Armor for my mod.\r\n- Thanks to KillerKeo as my mod includes his skimpy barkeep clothes.\r\n- And a thanks to Navetsea as well, I think. lol.  I know I had references to the Navetsea skin textures in my mod and I don\\'t remember if any of the characters are actually using the skin still.  But if they are, credit to Navetsea.",
