The glass bottles are 20% transparent.\r\n\r\nThey are textured (by DVAted) to match with the Sabre Cat Gear Mod Pack, but you can use them with any other armor you see fit.\r\n\r\nThey come in two weight versions with differing models\r\n- Light - Traveler (FCW +50)\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/12583-2-1331682714.jpg[/img]\r\n- Heavy - Survivor (FCW +100)\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/12583-1-1331682713.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nEach with the 3 fur-colors, though unlike the Sabre Cat armor, these bags require bear pelts:\r\n1. Normal (brown/orange - for the woods huntsman - requires Bear Pelt)\r\n2. Snow (white - for the polar players - requires Snow Bear Pelt)\r\n3. Puma (black - for friends of the shadows - requires Cave Bear Pelt)\r\n\r\nOther ingredients include such items as horse hide, goat hide, leather, leather strips and even torch and woodcutter\\'s axe for the heavy version.\r\n\r\nThat\\'s pretty much it!\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy your new custom backpack in your travels!\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n\r\nUpdate History:\r\n- NEW! v.2.0 - by popular demand: \r\n> set the backpack on body-slot 47 for better compatibility with other mods \r\n> replaced the steel war-axe with a woodcutter\\'s axe on the equiped and world model\r\n> replaced deer hide ingredient with horse hide to avoid elk/moose/stag confusions\r\n> renamed the black backpack from Puma to Black (since Puma\\'s are not black)\r\n\r\n- v.1.0a - fixed blue glow thanks to Nivea\r\n- v.1.0 - Initial Release\r\n_________________\r\n\r\n[u]Requirements and Conflicts[/u]: None anymore. Feel free to report and post suggestions. If you don\\'t like something, please provide constructive criticism. If you don\\'t like anything, please keep your thoughts to yourself.\r\n\r\n[u]Bugs Reported so far[/u] \r\n- Purple glow? FIXED! thanks to Nivea.\r\n- Steel War-Axe doesn\\'t get recognized in the forge? FIXED! You don\\'t need it anymore. The new release uses the woodcutter\\'s axe! GO OUT THERE AND CHOP WOOD! \r\n- Deer Hide doesn\\'t get recognized by the forge? FIXED! You don\\'t need it anymore. Replaced it with Horse Hide. Can\\'t find horse hide anywhere? You haven\\'t looked hard enough. They can be found at almost all general goods merchants, traders and vendors, especially the Khajiit caravans. Also dead horses can be found near giant camps (or on their barbecues) and you can loot them.\r\n_________________\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nDo not upload this mod anywhere without specific permission from the authors.
