  "descriptionHtml": "First and foremost, this mod is posted with permission of the original author, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/813611/?]neovinci[/url].\r<br />\r<br />---\r<br />\r<br />This is a BodySlide conversion for his amazing [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48077/?]Selene Armor[/url], which is required. This file only contains the bodyslide data, not the raw armor files. You can download it [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48077/?]here[/url]. This conversion uses [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?]Caliente&#39;s CBBE[/url] as the reference body, which you can get [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />What&#39;s inside? Why create another BodySlide? I have some different styles of the main armor piece that you may enjoy. let&#39;s review them together.\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Boots and Bracers. Only one option for each, and self explanatory.\r<br />[*]Armor, no HDT.\r<br />[*]Armor, full HDT; breasts and butt.\r<br />[*]Armor, HDT, breasts only. Jiggle-physics is as only as time, but I find the butt physics to be a bit much, so this is jiggle boobies only.\r<br />[*]Armor, Special breasts HDT and butt HDT. What is special breasts HDT? I painted the breasts weights onto the shirt area not held down by the corset, to make it a very, very small bit more realistic. Recommended with push-up enabled, this setting is pretty good for juggy characters.\r<br />[*]As above, but no butt HDT. I included this for the reason stated above, I think the butt HDT can be a bit much.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Because this armor covers the entire body and shows no skin, the reference body is not actually copied into the armor when it&#39;s exports from BodySlide, so there should be very little, if any, clipping issues. The collar is very high, so sometimes the lower chin can clip through that, but I don&#39;t find it to be noticeable unless you&#39;re looking for is specifically. I may release an update if I can find a good way to fix this.\r<br />\r<br />And that&#39;s about it. Enjoy&#33; Feedback or bug reports welcome.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Addendum: I filled out a thank you&#39;s section, but it was truncated I guess? So:\r<br />Thanks for neovinci for this armor.\r<br />Thanks to Caliente for the CBBE body and for the awesome BodySlide tool.\r<br />Thanks to Nexus Mods as always.\r<br />And thanks to Bethesda for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.",
