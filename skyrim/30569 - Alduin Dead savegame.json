I have no idea. I reuploaded the file so the correct name displays.\r<br />     After playing through the game many times, I wanted to have a save with Alduin dead. I turned on god mode, gave myself daedric armor, and plowed through the main story. The character, Seriana is level 3 and no perks used. When you start, you will be able to assign perks, and health/stamina/mana points as you please. \r<br />     To make the save I did not use any mods, no SKSE, and the only thing done is the main story line. I killed as little as possible, so you can go back to the dugeons and battle through them.\r<br />     Hearthfire and Dawnguard were installed on the play through but it should still work without them.",
