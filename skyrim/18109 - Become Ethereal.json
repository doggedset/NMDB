Once using the spell it only wears off with a load game or mod uninstall.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION~\r\nAdds a brand new spell to the game that gives you ghost visuals.\r\nComes with a little back story on a note located on top of the book.\r\nSpell Tome can be found in Farengar Secret-Fire\\'s bedroom in Dragonsreach.\r\nFor the longest time I have wanted to look like a ghost. Sure there is that philter in the quest that gives you the appearance for 30 seconds, but I wanted to have a ghastly appearance and roleplay as the first Dragonborn reborn into Skyrim.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0~Mod Base\r\nVersion 1.2~ Fixed issue to were collision was turned off.\r\n\r\nCredits-\r\nBethesda for Skyrim and Creation Kit",
