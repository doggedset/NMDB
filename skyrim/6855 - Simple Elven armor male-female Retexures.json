(These are all the files required)(just follow the file path)\r\n c;\\\\program files\\\\the elder scrolls v skyrim\\\\data\r\n\r\nUninstallation (Manual):\r\n- Remove the textures, \r\n\r\nI did not make any of these retextures; what i did was edit their file path locations so that they only replace the files i want for to suit my opinion they suit; subsequently this will also change any npc that has elven armor which makes them look better--see pics. \r\n\r\nHave not had any bugs/issues but if there are comment, i am new to modding so dont expect miracle fixes.\r\n\r\nComment, endorse its all good, All THANKS GOES TO Sabor and Elefish \r\n\r\nYou may use this mod so long as you mention it origins and creators. \r\n\r\nMy other lore friendly mods;\r\n\r\nThieves Guild Regular Armor Retextures \r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6407\r\n\r\nSimpler Jewel Craft pack and ideal changes \r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6188\r\n\r\nSimpler Dragonbone Weapons Pack \r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6027\r\n\r\nSimple Nordhero Universal Quiver replacer \r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6595\r\n\r\nRecommendations;\r\nPants for leather armor (looks better) see Dude wheres my pants - Leather Armor by Nivea\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5027 ",
