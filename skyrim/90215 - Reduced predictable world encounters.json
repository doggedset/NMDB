  "descriptionHtml": "An attempt at reducing the frequency of certain \"road encounters\". The affected encounters should appear 1/5th as often. \n<br />\n<br />Affected encounters:\n<br />Orc looking for a good death\n<br />Talsgar the Wanderer\n<br />Alik'r false accusation\n<br />M'aiq the Liar\n<br />Drinking companions\n<br />Afflicted refugee headed to High Rock\n<br />Headless Horseman\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This is the kind of mod that is hard to test, but I've had multiple playthroughs reaching 30+ with this installed, and I've had [s]0 crashes[/s] few crashes during that time. And M'aiq the Moron has only rarely shown his face. However, I consider this experimental, as I am no expert on the workings of Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Load order:\n<br />Safe to load anywhere\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Requiem players: This forwards changes from Behind the Curtain (orc encounter), but doesn't require it to be installed.",
