  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Introduction\n<br />============[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Once there was an assassin, his name was Arkanfel. \n<br />\n<br />A member of the Dark Brotherhood and for his crimes committed against his own he was banished to a remote point in Skyrim, never to leave unless called by the Night Mother herself. Years have passed and he felt all but forgotten, until he woke from a most disturbing dream one night.\n<br />\n<br />The Exile has been called, and he has left for one final contract.\n<br />\n<br />His home and everything within has been left behind, and is open to anyone willing to make the journey to claim it.\n<br />\n<br />The Exiles Tower awaits.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Description\n<br />===========[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Name: The Exile's Tower.\n<br />\n<br />A small single person dwelling.\n<br />\n<br />Home Includes:\n<br />\n<br />~ Bedroom\n<br />~ Storage (Multiple, various)\n<br />~ Alchemy, Enchanting areas\n<br />~ Cooking pot\n<br />~ Forge, Grind wheel, Workbench and tanning areas\n<br />~ Armour mannequin and weapon displays/racks\n<br />\n<br />There is also an artifact display present within the tower, it does not cover all items, but I felt it was a nice addition.\n<br />\n<br />There are multiple and various storage areas and containers within the home, \n<br />identfiable by their name when you hover the mouse over them.\n<br />\n<br />Weapon racks, bookshelves, armour storage, food stores etc... Plus a few other misc storage items.\n<br />\n<br />Many of the items are fixed in place to prevent clutter flying around the \n<br />cell, but not everything. I have made efforts to avoid placing anything \n<br />moveable in areas that are likely to result in them being knocked down \n<br />or shifted by a passing player.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Location\n<br />========[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Arcwind Point.\n<br />\n<br />The home has it's own map marker - status: always activated.\n<br />\n<br />This means you can fast travel to it from first installation if you so wish. The marker is visible around the Arcwind Point area, it's a tower ruin marker.\n<br />\n<br />Image of the location on the map is included in this download.\n<br />\n<br />Location notes:\n<br />\n<br />As with my (and many other home) mods - you may encounter creatures or enemies outside, this is something I did not encounter myself during my building and testing, but I am aware that any mod that adds additional creatures, combat zones or similar mods can increase the chance of such encounters, I hope it does not become an issue for people, but I felt people should be aware it might happen.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements:\n<br />============[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The official update ESM, and the officla DLC: Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Install\n<br />=======[/b]\n<br />\n<br />1.
