  "modName": "BTB Whiterun Outskirt",
  "summary": "Changes the road from Whiterun stables to Whiterun main gate.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Introduction:\r\nI have always felt that whiterun was too small and therefore I\\'ve tested mods like ICP, 7K whiterun etc but non of them did what i wanted. That was when I thought: why don\\'t i learn to use the CK and create my own mods?\r\n\r\nMod description:\r\nBTB Whiterun Outskirtchanges the area from Whiterun stable up to the front gate but will expand to include the iteriors of Whiterun. The mod adds 6 houses, 9 npcs and 3 merchants. while it might seem like the houses is boring att first I would recomend exploration of the addsd houses. Every house whould be fully navmeshed and the npcs should have full shedules.\r\n\r\nConflicts: \r\nThis mod might conflict with battle for Whiterun due to a market stall and the new wooden gate but I havent tested it and therefore it might be a good idea to install it after battle for whiterun.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n1.Back up your data folder\r\n2.Extract the file with 7zip or winrar\r\n3.Copy everything into your data folder if asked to merge click yes \r\n4.Activate WhiterunWalls .esp in launcher\r\n5.Start up your game\r\n\r\nCompatibility \r\nThis mod WILL conflict with any mod which changes the rpoad up to Whiteruns gate theesse mods include \\\"Whiterun outskirt market\\\", \\\"7K Better Whiterun\\\" and \\\"ICP Immersive Cities Project\\\" but there is probably more mods which will cause conflicts\r\n\r\nFuture plans: \r\n1. Change the interior of Whiterun.\r\n2. Start on an other city.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBethesda Softwork for Skyrim, the Creation kit and official HD texture pack\r\nNebuLa1 for Skyrim 2k texture pack (textures used in picture due to me being lazy and didn\\'t want to change my load order)\r\njjc71 for Climates of Tamriel (the sky which is seen in the pics commes from CoT)\r\n",
