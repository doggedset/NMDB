  "descriptionHtml": "[b][b]Update July 31th, 2017[/b]\r<br />[/b]Anyone who wishes to port this mod to Skyrim Special Edition has my blessing to do so.[b][b]\r<br />[/b]\r<br />Description[/b]\r<br />The purpose of this mod is to increase immersion by making animal loot more realistic. It ensures that animals no longer carry gold or jewelry, and it slightly increases the number of antlers, horns, tusks, claws, legs, and/or toes you can harvest from them. In example, deer no longer drop gold or jewelry, and you can harvest two antlers from them instead of just one.\r<br />\r<br />- The following animals no longer drop gold or jewelry: Bears, chauruses, cows, death hounds, deer, elk, frostbite spiders, goats, horkers, foxes, mammoths, mud crabs, skeevers, sabre cats, and wolves. You may however still find gold or jewelry in slaughterfish.\r<br />\r<br />- Animal loot quantities have been adjusted as follows: Bears drop 3 claws, deer and elk drop 2 antlers, giants drop 3 toes, goats drop 2 horns, horkers and mammoths drop 2 tusks, and mudcrabs drop 3 legs. Formerly, these animals only dropped 1 of each.\r<br />\r<br />Note that this mod may be considered a very minimalist version of Xion209&#39;s excellent [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8075/?]Realistic Wildlife Loot And Recipes[/url], which I&#39;ve been using up until recently and fully endorse. The only reasons why you may want to use my mod instead of his, is that mine has significantly increased compatibility with other mods while also being fully compatible with all languages. If you&#39;re interested in a larger overhaul, and have no compatibility issues, then his mod will likely be the best option for you.\r<br />\r<br />Many thanks to the esteemed [url=http://trollberserker.deviantart.com/]Trollberserker[/url] for the mod image.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements[/b]\r<br />This mod requires the official Dawnguard and Hearthfire DLCs.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Configuration notes[/b]\r<br />If you&#39;re using Wrye Bash, then &#39;Realistic Animal Loot.esp&#39; should be assigned the bash tags DELEV and RELEV, because it removes some loot items while also increasing the amount of other loot items.\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s a slight conflict with Skyrim Redone (SkyRe) because it adjusts giant frostbite spider loot, specifically frostbite venom. For this reason, if you use poisons and wish to keep the SkyRe-edit, place &#39;SkyRe_Main.esp&#39; after &#39;Realistic Animal Loot.esp&#39; in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />[b]My other mods[/b][list]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47272/?]Consistent Vignar Gray-Mane[/url]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48193/?]Ulvhild - Nord Housecarl for Lakeview Manor[/url]\r<br />[/list]",
