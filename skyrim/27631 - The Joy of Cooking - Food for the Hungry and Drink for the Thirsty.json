  "summary": "Food heals, mead restores stamina and wine/dessert foods restore magicka on levels comparable to potions. Makes cooking and collecting food/drink more worthwhile.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hello!\r\n\r\nI always felt that food and drinks in Skyrim, while a lot of fun, just weren\\'t worth my time because of their negligible effects. This mod seeks to correct that by tweaking the magical effects of food and beverages to make their health/stamina/magicka restoration bonuses greater, to the point where various foodstuffs are just as powerful as potions. To give you an example, a venison chop restores 100 points of health, Black-Briar Mead restores 75 points of stamina, and Alto Wine restores 100 points of magicka. No new effects added except to raw foods (drain 75 stamina when consumed) and San\\'s Spiced Wine (now resist 75% of frost damage for 30 seconds once you drain the bottle).\r\n\r\nEnjoy! ",
