Two arrows is ok with me, one is not. The damage just becomes drastically higher than any other form of enemy damage once you have high armour.  This is my attempt to bring it closer to balance. \r\n\r\nAlso note: I use DUEL w/ ASIS among other enemy mods, if you don\\'t experience overpowered archers this mod is not for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod is a personal tweak i made for balance in my own game, but i know some others may find it useful for theirs.  It comes with two seperate changes, one that edits arrows(specifically the better ones) to a lower damage, and another that edits the perk tree.\r\n\r\nThis is not made for everyone, clearly players that prefer to use a bow all the time may find these changes not to their liking. But perhaps they feel OP\\'d as well and would like a little Nerf. ( you\\'ll also notice i left some arrows alone.. those that just want to use the arrow tweak can then select those arrows for their character and do the full damage they always did )\r\n\r\nI did a full playthrough after making these changes in my testmod, and it worked out pretty well.  Some forsworn or falmer could still almost one shot my character at full health, but i\\'m pretty happy with it.  Archers are still to be feared, but it should cause a bit less frustration/rage.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\nArrow Tweaks\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nType : vanilla : change\r\n\r\nIron : 8 : 8\r\n\r\nSteel: 10 : 9\r\n\r\nAncient Nord Arrow : 10 : 10\r\n\r\nBound Arrow : 24 : 24  ( can\\'t think of any enemies who use this )\r\n\r\nDaedric Arrow : 24 : 15\r\n\r\nDwarven : 14 : 11\r\n\r\nDwarven Centurion : 20 : 11 ( big culprit of OHKO for me )\r\n\r\nDwemer Bolt 1 : 10 : 5\r\n\r\nDwemer Bolt 2 : 15 : 10\r\n\r\nEbony : 20 : 15\r\n\r\nElven : 16 : 11\r\n\r\nFalmer : 7 : 4  ( i was shocked it was already only 7 dmg )\r\n\r\nForsworn : 7 : 4\r\n\r\nGlass : 18 : 12\r\n\r\nNord Hero : 24 : 24\r\n\r\nOrcish : 12 : 11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\nMarksman perk changes\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nOverdraw - now increases in increments of 15% instead of 20% \r\n( just a small change, reduces the strongest perk by 25% however )\r\n\r\nCritical shot - Reduced the extra damage of the crits/ Raised chance to crit\r\n( big culprit of the OHKO, with this change the crits still take place,and more \r\n\r\noften, but it\\'s chance to OHKO is lessened )\r\n\r\n1 - 10% chance to crit increased to 20%\r\n\r\n2 - 15% chance to crit increased to 30%\r\n  - Extra crit damage 25% to 5%\r\n\r\n3 - 20% chance to crit increased to 45%\r\n  - Extra Crit damage 50% to 10%\r\n\r\nBullseye - Reduced paralyze chance to 5%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nother suggestions\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSPERG - perk overhaul, the heavy armor tree has a perk that reduces arrow damage by \r\n\r\nhalf.  Also has a perk to block paralysis.  I haven\\'t yet tried it myself since i\\'m \r\n\r\nworried about it breaking some of my enemy mods and I like ASIS perks added to \r\n\r\nenemies. \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24445\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\nMy Mods:\r\n--------------------------\r\nStrong Odahviing And Durnehviir\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33559/\r\n----------------------------\r\nArchery Changes for DUEL:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33627/\r\n-------------------------------\r\nSEX - Strong Enemy Xtreme:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33589/\r\n-------------------------------",
