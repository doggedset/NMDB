  "summary": "A modern, office secretary-esque outfit for CBBE Bodyslide. Does not come with shoes, so maybe get a high heels mod or something to go with it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a modern secretary style outfit to Skyrim, for CBBE Bodyslide. Obviously, this is not lore friendly, and only for females. It does not come with shoes of any sort, so if you want those, you'll have to search for a fitting pair somewhere else. If you want my personal recommendation, I find most of Frankyfrank's shoes to look good with this outfit, such asÂ [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/89613]these pairs.\n<br />[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />I didn't make the model, and I don't know who did; the original author seems to have dropped off the face of the Earth along with all of their mods, but if they have any concerns relating to this file I would like to personally encourage them to contact me about it.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Seeing as how this is a CBBE Bodyslide file, you'll have to build the meshes in Bodyslide before you use it if you don't want your character's body to morph when putting the outfit on. As for acquiring the outfit, it does not appear anywhere in the game in any containers or anything; you must spawn it in via the console. If you don't know how to do that, type in \"Help Secretary\" and you should get an item code which you can then use in the additem command.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to comment and I'll get back to you when I can.",
