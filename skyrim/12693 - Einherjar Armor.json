[/heading]\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n[i]Description[/i]\r\n\r\n\\\"Those who were chosen on the fields of the slain were called in Asgard the Einherjar. For them Odin made ready a great Hall. Valhalla, the Hall of the Slain, it was called. Five hundred and forty doors had Valhalla, and out of each door eight hundred Champions might pass. Every day the Champions put on their armor and took their weapons down from the walls, and went forth and battled with each other. All who were wounded were made whole again, and in peace and goodly fellowship they sat down to the feast that Odin prepared for them. Odin himself sat with his Champions, drinking wine but eating no meat.\\\"\r\nThe Children of Odin part III - The Witch\\'s Head: 4, the Valkyrie - Padraic Colum\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a fully standalone set of lore-friendly Heavy & Light Armor with 8 variants to the game (currently male only). It is craftable through the \\\"Advanced Armor Smithing\\\" perk, or for the lazier amongst you, can be obtained from a chest near the bar in the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood\r\n\r\nVariants are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Einherjar Armor - Standard Edition, features a dark accent and various trophies \r\n2. Einherjar Armor - True Nord Edition, features a lighter accent and a unique necklace with trinkets generously donated by the Thalmor\r\n3. Einherjar Armor - Standard Edition, bones sold separately\r\n4. Einherjar Armor - True Nord Edition, not a bone in sight\r\n5. Einherjar Armor - Standard edition, light armor version\r\n6. Einherjar Armor - True Nord edition, light armor version\r\n7. Einherjar Armor - Standard edition, light & boneless version\r\n8. Einherjar Armor - True Nord edition, light & boneless version\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n[i]Installation[/i]\r\n\r\nNMM: Under \\\"Mods\\\" tab, select \\\"Add Mod from File\\\", active, done - easy as pie :)\r\n\r\nManual: Drag and drop the \\\"Data\\\" folder into your Skyrim directory where \\\"TESV.exe\\\" is located, merge when prompted, then activate the .esp via either the launcher or NMM\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n[i]Requirements[/i]\r\n\r\nYou\\'re going to need Fur Hoods HD by Northborn to make sure all textures display properly; get it [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3201] here [/url]\r\n\r\nNot a requirement per s√©, but as this armor utilizes vanilla assests, it should benefit from whatever texture replacing mods you may or may not be running\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n[i]Compatibility[/i]\r\n\r\nIncompatible with \\\"tartan stormcloaks\\\". The textures cause a \\\"black sleeve issue\\\". Use the vanilla ones instead.\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n[i]Future Plans[/i]\r\n\r\n- Female support (still too much of a WIP to be released right now; that being said, equipping this armor as a female character is fully possible, it will simply equip the male version, resulting in a really weird and bulky looking lady)\r\n\r\n- Rextexture the gold chain to match the new brooches\r\n\r\n- High resolution fur pieces\r\n\r\n- Additional differentiation between the four main versions\r\n\r\n- More customizeability with individual pieces (A.K.A. the [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=36660] \\\"Tailor Maid\\\" [/url] approach)\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n[i]Changelog[/i]\r\n\r\nv1.1: Light armor versions added.
