  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/52190-1-1395254320.png[/img]\r<br />[font=Garamond][b]OUT NOW&#33;&#33;&#33;[/b]\r<br />[color=yellow][size=7][b]Vol. 1:[/b] Outfit Studio + NifSkope[/size][/color][/font][/heading]\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Georgia]\r<br />[size=5][b][color=orange]Hi there...[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />Being a long time Skyrim mods user, I&#39;ve always wanted to create my own mod... Skyrim mods was to me an appealing platform to bring my ideas to fruition. I just wanted to create my first mod, be it insignificant or in poor taste... but I just couldn&#39;t find the key to creating a mod from scratch. For someone who has never even heard of modding games before being introduced to Skyrim, getting to know how to mod his game and troubleshooting it to make it work, in itself is a solid piece of knowledge on how mods work... for someone like that to understand how to create his own mods requires a larger piece of the whole. It was at times like these, when you fumble on the first steps, that you come across some nifty tools around the internet that slipstreams you past some of the hard stuff. It can provide the confidence needed for level 0 modder to play a hand at modding. This is the essense of this tutorial... an effective use of [b]what is available right now[/b] to taper down the learning curve.\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=orange]What&#39;s in Vol. 1?[/color][/size]\r<br />[b]Bodyslide and Outfit Studio[/b] is one such tool that helps you convert armors (and clothing) without the hassle of learning 3d modelling and animations. I have used several body mods both male and female. While switching male bodies usually was smooth, since most bodies usually don&#39;t deviate much from the vanilla version (or is it because I didn&#39;t care enough to notice), the difference between female versions are so drastic, that errors and annoyances were guaranteed. Well, [i]Outfit Studio to the rescue...[/i], now you can convert armours between body mods (female) with ease.\r<br />I found this during the process of switching from UNPB to SevenBase... even though 7B boasts a huge selection of vanilla armor re-placers, the little that is available for UNPB is just awesome. So, I wanted to port my favorite ones from the UNPB over to 7B. Normally I&#39;d spend Hours in NifSkope, trying to tweak the outfit bit by bit till it fit the body I needed, I&#39;ve done that before, with a success rate of about 50%. But with Outfit Studio, the whole process just takes like 20 minutes and is almost always a success.\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />The tutorial here right now, and the many that may come, are mere documentation of my efforts towards the end of understanding it, and only came to be because of some wonderful people as mentioned below.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b][color=orange]Credits & Thanks[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=orange]For Vol. 1[/color][/b]\r<br />This work is largely somebody else&#39;s work, and is thus a mere documentation of my experience. Therefore, this work and myself owes its thanks to these wonderful people...\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3330686]Caliente[/url]: For the versatile tools [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49015]Bodyslide and Outfit Studio[/url].
