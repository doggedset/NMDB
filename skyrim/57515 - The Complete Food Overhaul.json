  "summary": "A re mastery of the food offered in Skyrim, this mod aims to increase the usefulness of food",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is a Nexus-version of Food Overhaul:Complete \r<br />\r<br />The goal was to create a mod that makes food a viable source of health/magika replenishment, without making it to overpowered. Potions will still be better than food, but since food is so widespread, it may be wiser to eat instead. Among simple improvements to health/magika gain, additional effects have been applied to give other types of food some other uses i.e. Carrots increase Marksmen and so on. Not only are there food improvements, the ability to craft Skooma and the Phantom/Ghost potion is available. \r<br />\r<br />Installation: Navigate to your steamapps/common/skyrim/Data folder, and drop the ESP in the data folder. ",
