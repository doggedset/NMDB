  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=4][i][/i][color=#ff0000][i][color=#ffffff]According to “a 2007 study by a Navy research-advisory committee,” it was determined that “Marines typically have loads from [b]97 to 135[/b] pounds.” [/color][/i][/color][/size][/center][size=4][color=#ff0000]\r<br />[size=5][b]True Realistic Item Weights[/b][/size][/color][size=5] is a Tes5edit/MXPF patcher that will provide you with realistic and (almost) accurate weights for all [color=#ff0000]items in-game.[/color][/size][/size]\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4][size=6]Supports SE, LE and all Skyrim mods without exception&#33;[/size]\r<br />[/size][/color][center][i][size=5][size=4]Works just great with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72896/?]True Medieval Economy[/url] and some hardcore carryweight mod, like [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83816/?]Realistic Capacity[/url] or [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13247/?]Encumbering loot[/url][/size][/size][/i][/center][size=5]\r<br />[color=#ff0000]List of features:[/color]\r<br />[size=3]- Once you run patcher, it will create plugin TRIW.esp that will reweight ALL game items in pounds according to their real-life counterparts.[/size][/size][size=3] Patcher is 100% configurable, so if you don&#39;t like one of my decisions, you can easily change it.\r<br />- All perk, enchantment, potion, ingredient, Steed Stone carryweight bonuses are divided by 5. (Campfire and Wet&Cold backpacks carryweight bonus is not touched, but Bandoliers are touched)\r<br />- Wine now comes in standard 750 ml bottles, ale and mead - in 12 oz/300-350 ml bottles (just think of the smallest typical beer bottle you can buy in your country).\r<br />- Weight of bottles is included in the total weight of beverage, so alcohol now is considerably heavier.\r<br />- Soups and stews are carried in earthenware pottery, and it also makes them much heavier.\r<br />- However, most food is still left same as before (if you are using CACO. If you are not, it will also be heavier).\r<br />- Heavy armor isn&#39;t touched. Light armor cuirass is two times heavier, other light armor pieces are left same (sneak bonuses are adjusted, so game balance isn&#39;t changed&#33;)\r<br />- Weapons are 3 times lighter than before (weight of scabbard included).\r<br />- Clothing is heavier, and all jewelry and gems (same as magic scrolls) now weigh [i]almost nothing.[/i]\r<br />- Books have different weights depending on their size (Book Covers Skyrim and Legacy of the Dragonborn is supported, except non-vanilla books. Non-vanilla books will have weight of 1.5 lbs no matter what is their world size. Nothing game-breaking as actually weight for most of books is 1.5 and only minority of books, like Biography of Barenziah, has weight of 2.5.\r<br />- Hides and Pelts now are quite heavy (Hunterborn supported)\r<br />- Cowhide and horsehide are VERY heavy\r<br />- Campfire and Campfire-based tents are 3 times heavier.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=3][b]Required mods:[/b][/size][/color][size=3]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/?]TES5Edit[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68617/?]MXPF - Mator&#39;s xEdit Patching Framework\r<br />[/url]\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Not technically required, but VERY recommended.

If disabled, your weapons will have weights like 3.0 or 3.5 instead.\r<br />4) if you want to setup your own modifiers or exact weights, like a weight for your lockpicks or empty wine bottles, change them in following lines. \r<br />Everything here is very self-explanatory and does not require any programming experience.\r<br />5) Load all your mods in tes5edit\r<br />6) Select one of your mods, press right mouse button and select &#34;Apply script&#34;. Choose True Realistic Item Weights.pas. Press &#34;Apply&#34;.\r<br />7) When prompted, enter name of new patch file &#34;TRIW&#34;.\r<br />8) Wait\r<br />9) If you encounter a problem while patching, read sticky post\r<br />10) Play&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]FAQ\r<br />[size=3][color=#ffffff][color=#ff0000]Q: This mod will not change base carryweight?[/color]\r<br />A: No, I decided to leave this to a player. Just use one of carryweight mods I mentioned above or a console command &#34;player.modav carryweight 60&#34; etc. Maybe I will add it later as an optional feature, however I&#39;m not sure how it will affect NPCs.\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Q: Why is light armor cuirass heavier?[/color]\r<br />A: Because it isn&#39;t similar to your favorite leather jacker. It is basically made of very thick and durable animal skin (fur, hide, leather), chainmail (Stormcloak/guard), or quite thin metal (Elven, Scaled, Glass). Typical medieval short chainmail has weight of something like 7 kg(15.5 lbs)&#33; Boots, helmets, shields and gauntlets are still left the same, sprint/sneak settings are edited, and heavy armor is still A LOT heavier, so it&#39;s not a real problem.\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Q: Compatible with Requiem?[/color]\r<br />A: Yes.\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Q: Where must I place TRIW files in load order?[/color]\r<br />A: Put TRIW.esp at the very end of your load order. Rebuild patch every time you change your modlist&#33;\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Q: I am also using True Medieval Economy, which patcher I should run first?[/color]\r<br />A: It doesn&#39;t really matter, but run TRIW first and TME second simply to have smaller TRIW.esp file.\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Q: One of items now has weird weight, or something else doesn&#39;t work as intended[/color]\r<br />A: Maybe I overlooked something, please write about it at the discussion tab.\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Q: How I am now supposed to carry a tent while travelling?[/color]\r<br />A: Buy a horse and use one of these horse mods. Actually, that&#39;s what [url=http://legioneromana.altervista.org/content/tents-roman-camp?language=en]Romans were doing.[/url][/color][/size][/size][/color][/size]\r<br />[size=3]Or just use a bedroll from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72220/?]Tentapalooza [/url][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]Credits[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=4]matortheeternal for his help and the miraculous MXPF.\r<br />Google...
