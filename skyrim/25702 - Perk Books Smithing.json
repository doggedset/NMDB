  "descriptionHtml": "Adds books to the game that give the player smithing perks when read. However, you still need to have the skill to learn.\r\n\r\nI always wondered how after crafting 16324 Iron Daggers you suddenly know how to forge daedric armor and weapons. So I created this Mod to add a realistic way to learn smithing. \r\n\r\nThese Books may be found in various locations as well as purchased from different blacksmiths.\r\nAll of them may appear as a reward near the end of each of teh major quest lines (depending on your level), as well as the following:\r\n\r\nSteel Smithing: Purchasable from (nearly) every blacksmith, may be found as leveled Item.\r\n\r\nElven Smithing: Sold by Arnskar ([spoiler]Blacksmith of the restored Theives Guild[/spoiler]), may be found as leveled item in Thalmor locations ([spoiler]Thalmor Embassy, Northwatch Keep, Thalmor Headquarters of Castle Dour[/spoiler]).\r\n\r\nDwarven Smithing: Sold by the dwemer specialist [spoiler]Calcelmo[/spoiler], may be found as leveled item in some dwemer ruins ([spoiler]Alftand, Avanchnzel, Blackreach, Bthalft, Nchuand Zel, Raldbthar[/spoiler]).\r\n\r\nOrcish Smithing: Purchasable after [spoiler]doing a favor quest for one of the orc strongholds[/spoiler].\r\n\r\nAdvanced Smithing: Sold by [spoiler]Eorlund Gray-mane[/spoiler], found inside the falkreath [spoiler]sanctuary[/spoiler], sold by Vanryth ([spoiler]Merchant of the restored Theives Guild[/spoiler]), found during the Main Quest [spoiler]inside Sky Haven Temple[/spoiler].\r\n\r\nGlass Smithing: May be found as leveled item in Thalmor locations ([spoiler]Thalmor Embassy, Northwatch Keep, Thalmor Headquarters of Castle Dour[/spoiler]).\r\n\r\nDaedric Smithing: In/near some daedric shrines ([spoiler]Meruhnes Dagon, Vaermina, Mephala, Molag Bal[/spoiler]).\r\n\r\nDragon Smithing: Found during the Main Quest [spoiler]inside the Hall of Valor[/spoiler].\r\n\r\n\r\n [COMPATIBILITY & CONFLICTS]\r\n\r\nThis Mod is compatible to all mods that modify vanilla perks, perk trees, merchants ect.\r\n\r\n [VERSIONS]\r\n\r\n[CHANGE LOG]\r\n\r\n1.2:\r\n- Reworked book locations by using leveled lists.\r\n\r\n1.1:\r\n- Script additions\r\n- Added Custom Texture for Dwarven Smithing\r\n- Added Images to Daedric Smithing, Dwarven Smithing, Elven Smithing and Glass Smithing\r\n\r\n1.0:\r\n - Initial Release\r\n\r\n [LINKS]\r\n\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=104778829]Steam[/url]\r\n\r\n [NOTES]\r\n\r\nStill need to create unique models or book contents.\r\n\r\n [FOR MODDERS]\r\n\r\nFeel free to use my mod in any way you want, including changing, rewriting or using parts of it.
