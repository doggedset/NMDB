  "summary": "The Aim is fixed on the third person view and the first person view!!!\r\nFirst of all sorry for my bad English, This mod adds several weapons that can be made at any forge, you can use to be thrown anywhere.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Now the aim third and first person mode is fixed!!!\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nAdds throwing knives and axes to the Skyrim armory. You can combine the weapons with others, because they are one handed.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\nYou can forge the weapons at any forge.\r\nOnce equipped you just have to attack like with every other weapon. \r\nThe projectile will be shot in the direction you are pointing.\r\n\r\nThere are 5 different knives\r\n\r\nDamage\r\nIron Knife :\t         6\r\nSteel Knife:\t 7\r\nElven Knife:\t 10\r\nOrcish Knife:\t 8\r\nDwarven Knife:\t 11\r\n\r\nThe ammo isn´t a weapon it just supplies infinite ammo (for the specific material eg. Steel ammo for Steel knife and Dwarven for Dwarven kinfe, so if you have two different throwing knifes equipped you can only supply infinite ammo for one)\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod so do not be mean to me... \r\n\r\nTo fix the aim I had to change the mod so that the used ammo can´t be recovered, but I am working on that. Thanks to Althalos and DaMuncha on the Creation Kit Forums for discussing the script and Neon on Steam for testing the Mod. I had to change the damage of the knives as well, so please tell me if it is too low or too high, with numbers please. \r\n\r\nHere is the link to the CK forums, if Someone wants to take a look and maybe try to improve it:\r\n\r\n\\\"Throwing Knives Mod Help\\\" \r\nhttp://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1353688-throwing-knives-mod-help/page__fromsearch__1\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\nThere are some bugs when unequipping a weapon in one hand while the throwing knives are in the other hand. To solve this you just have to unequip ithem, and then reequip them. Apparently there\\'s a conflict with \\\"deadly combat\\\", which makes impossible to throw the knives.\r\n\r\nI fixed the \\\"resisted knife impact\\\" bug\r\nthe damage is this way now:\r\n\r\nTotal Damage = (Basic Knife Damage * 1.5) + (Player One-Hand Skill - Target Damage Resist / 2)\r\nTotal Sneak Damage = (Basic Knife Damage * 1.5) + ((Player One-Hand Skill)*3 - Target Damage Resist / 2)\r\n\r\nnote: the basic knife damage always affects the target, but the additional damage will only affect the target if the subtraction is greater than 0\r\n\r\nIf you think this formula is wrong, you can propose one to improve the balance \r\n\r\nHope it works for you, and feel free to improve the mod and continue with this idea. \r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\nGlass Knife\r\nEbony Knife (2 Rounds)\r\nDaedric Knife\r\nShurikens (5 rounds)\r\nElven Axe (40% to knock down a enemy)\r\nOrcish Axe (40% to knock down a enemy)\r\n\r\nRemoved the sheathe animation\r\nNow the projectiles spin in the air after shooting\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks To:\r\nRandomNoob - For his help with the scripts and other things that I did not understand about the editor\r\nEnok2u and Brodual - for their video reviews\r\nDesasterous - for his *help* with the English description\r\n\r\nI keep this comment because he helped find a solution for a problem with the mod:\r\n\r\nGhostOfSierra1171\r\njust in case this is helpful to anyone: if you are using a bashed or merged patch, leave this mod [or any mod that uses scripts really] out of the patch. That means when you make the patch make sure you uncheck the box next to \\\"Throwing Knives\\\" in your mod list before you make/update the patch. In skyrim bashed or merged patches tend to mess with mods that use scripts and can make them work improperly or even not work at all.\r\n\r\n[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://SkyrimGEMS.com/images/badge_featured.png[/img][/url][/center]\r\n\r\nSorry that i am not updating, it is because I was working in this other mod, if you have time take a look:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14060",
