  "descriptionHtml": "Pankraz from dragon quest V ds/ps2 (I think it was ps2), now in skyrim as a big oath with big muscles and is about a arm length bigger than an average nord. You can find him in the banneredmare. Dont mind the pictured of his hair not black, a hair mod did that...\r<br />\r<br />                       [color=#ff0000][size=6][u]Pankraz&#39;s stength\r<br />[/u][/size][/color]He is a level 27 and is quite strong. I put him up against uthgerd the unbroken and he destroyed her (I was level 1 back then though...) so in the early games he will be great, I don&#39;t know if he gets stronger by you leveling up but he is as big as a giant(nearly), what is there to worry about?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]BUGGGGSSS );\r<br />[/size]\r<br />Pankraz sadly only protects you if... someone attacks him first or.. you use the command to get him to attack someone otherwise he just has his weapon drawn running around like a lunatic.",
