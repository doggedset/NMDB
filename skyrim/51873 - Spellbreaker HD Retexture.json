  "summary": "This is my first mod and my first retexture :D.\r<br />The images that i posted are not great but if you would try the mod out you would get a much better result.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is something i made because i did not like the other mods for spellbreaker i found on the nexus. \r<br />There shouldn&#39;t be any compatibility problems with any mod, except mods that change spellbreaker textures ore mesh. \r<br />But if you have a problem with my mod just ask and i will try to help as best as i can.\r<br />I added a glow map to the spellbreaker that means that it has a glow effect but doesn&#39;t not emit light like a torch.\r<br />If someone dose not like how it looks like with the glow map i Can make a version without it.\r<br />The textures are all 2048x2048 but sinc its only one shield there will not be any performance drops.",
