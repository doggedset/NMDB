  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r\nNear the Riften south gate you can find teleport stone to Dayspring Canyon (Fort Dawnguard). During the Second Era this stone was used by Jarl of Riften to visit his vampire son. And now you can use this ancient way to have a quick access to Fort Dawnguard.\r\n\r\nThis mod will be useful for those who avoid to use fast travel but hate run to Fort Dawnguard for hundred times. And now you can travel to Riften by carriage and then use stone to teleport to Fort Danguard. Have fun!\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nUse NMM or manually place .esp file into skyrim data folder\r\n\r\n",
