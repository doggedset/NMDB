  "descriptionHtml": "[right][/right][right][/right][center]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/i8j9brN.jpg[/img]﻿﻿[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]I made this house mod for my own character and his companion. It's decked out with specific nods to their stories and personalities, but I decided to share it here because I thought others might enjoy it too. I still think it could be fitting enough for a wide variety of characters. However, a common theme you'll notice is that there's alcohol all over the place, (99 bottles of mead on the wall, 99 bottles mead~) and even a micro-brewery outside, so it's pretty perfect if you're playing a drinky character.\n<br />\n<br />The main room includes a bar, a kitchen with some stocked food storage containers, and a cozy lounging area by the fireplace. Behind the bar are both a trapdoor to the basement bath, and the stairs up to the candle-lit loft bedroom with a treasure hunting/mapping study desk. There is not much in the way of gameplay amenities though. It has no enchanting table, no alchemy lab, no anvil, no workbench, no grinding wheel, and no smelter, because why would it? I never thought it was realistic for humble abodes to have all these things, so I didn't include them. In fact, it doesn't even have a cooking pot over the fire because it threw unwanted shadows all over the room. So, just wanted to be clear, [b]I'm emphasizing form over function with this house. [/b]90% of the reason I made it was to have a place to take pretty screenshots in.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Location:[/size]\n<br />[/b]It's inside the river bend near Cradlecrush Rock, on the road from Whiterun to Windhelm. The area near the road is changed significantly, just follow the road towards Windhelm around the corner and look for a small opening on the left, that's the path to the yard. No key or mini fetch quest necessary, just waltz right in. You can also use \"coc honeyfrostretreat\" or \"coc honeyfrostretreatexterior\" if that's more your speed.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Recommended Mods:[/size]\n<br />[/b]Mods that I used while making and testing this house, so these will make it looks closest to how I intended.[b]\n<br />[/b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8655/?]SMIM[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/607/?]Skyrim HD 2K[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/?]Noble Skyrim[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5712421/?tb=mods&amp;pUp=1]EVERY GAMWICH TEXTURE EVER[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58980/?]Fences of Skyrim[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55699/?]Immersive Fallen Trees Mod[/url] (adds something to the background of the house, clips mildly with the rock wall but it looks fine imo)\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68782/?]Enhanced Landscapes[/url] (again, adds to the backdrop, it is conflict heavy in nature so if you pass on it I understand)\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Known Conflicts:[/b][/size][u]\n<br />Pretty much anything that occupies the same vicinity will conflict, here are some examples:[/u]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22369/?]Oblivion Gates[/url] - There's some gate remnants in that spot in the overworld, it will clip through a part of the porch.
