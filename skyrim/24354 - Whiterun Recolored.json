Download after downloading the main file.[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/24354-1-1348099715.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nGreetings modders!  This retexture mod is the product of my desire to make Whiterun a bit warmer and sharper, without installing a lot of ENBs...so I went and sharped and recolored the existing textures.  I am so pleased with the final result, that I have decided to share them with you all.  Enjoy!\r\n\r\nPlease note, any other additions besides the textures, are not my own.  I used \\\"Beautiful Whiterun\\\" by MorninJerky for the added foliage and clutter.  So I really recommend that you download that one first!!  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12110]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12110[/url]\r\n\r\nAnd if you really want a more foresty feel, you can also download \\\"Whiterun Trees\\\" by elderfan201 [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8240]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8240[/url]\r\n\r\nI\\'ve used both in the past, and they don\\'t clash with each other...at least not as far as I can tell.  \r\n\r\nAlso, another one that I see a lot of people use, that works even more perfectly, is this City Forests! [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9558]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9558[/url]  I just downloaded it and I am blown away by the result!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you like my texture edits, please let me know, and I\\'ll see about editing some other towns or cities.  :D\r\n\r\n",
