  "summary": "-WIP- Victoria is a blood thirsty vampire lord. She has both the dragon and the blood scrolls so you don\\'t have to go throught the tedious quests. She\\'s also in the Dark Brotherhood",
  "descriptionHtml": "Victoria is in the Dark Brotherhood, the quest line is not finished because Victoria isn\\'t the listener. She will have the dragon and the blood Elder Scrolls so that way you don\\'t have to go through the annoying quests to get them. Victoria hasn\\'t interacted with the main quest, so that way you don\\'t encounter any dragons or the guards talk about the dragonborn. Remember, Victoria came before the dragonborn. The legend of the dragonborn is still considered a legend. \r\n\r\nRequired mods:\r\nAlternate Start - Live Another Life by Arthmoor - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9557\r\nApachiiSkyHair by Apachii - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\nCalientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- by Caliente - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r\nLustmord Vampire Armor by AmethystDeceiver - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25852\r\nBetter Vampires by Brehanin 5_7 by Brehanin - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9717",
