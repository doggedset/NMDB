  "descriptionHtml": "This is the very beginning of a mod that aims to expand upon the culture of the Reachmen as shown in Skyrim&#33;  \r<br />\r<br /> I&#39;ve always been a bit disappointed with what we see of them-- the Reachmen kind of remind me of the ancient Celts, but almost the only taste we get of them is the Forsworn, who are essentially an extremist terrorist group.  They are all clad in the same kind of furs --which is uneconomical and unlikely lore-wise-- and there are few non-hostile but still traditionally-oriented Reachmen in the game.  At the moment, I&#39;ve partially fixed the clothing/armor problem with some leveled list work + some new items (trews using the in-game prisoner rags model).  In the near future I plan on adding small non-hostile Reachman settlements out in the wilds of the Reach, with merchants and ideally a custom-voiced follower or two. \r<br />\r<br />2/2/17:\r<br />-Added several variants of trews + added them to leveled lists\r<br />-Scrambled up the Forsworn leveled lists with some vanilla items\r<br />\r<br />[b]FUTURE PLANS[/b]\r<br />1. Non-hostile Reachman villages\r<br />1a. Custom-voiced follower\r<br />2. More clothing?",
