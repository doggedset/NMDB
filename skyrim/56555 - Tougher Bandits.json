  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][b]Version 1.0[/b][/size] \r<br />Level 1 Bandit HP has been increased from 35 to 100 (This only affects the very first bandits, all other bandit types have not been modified at all).\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Version 1.1[/b][/size] \r<br />Update Level 1 bandits also had a hidden perk which cut their damage in half (causing them to do negligible damage, ugh).  The perk was removed and now they deal normal damage, like normal people.\r<br />\r<br />The story behind this mod:\r<br />\r<br />1) As soon as I started a new game, my character could kill bandits with 3 strikes while bandits would kill me with 30 strikes (On Adept).  Bandits felt too weak to be humanoid.\r<br />\r<br />2) In order to give Bandits the dignity of being mighty humanoids, I gave them the same HP the player starts out with, and they now deal the amount of damage they are supposed to (Now they have a fighting chance).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Should I use this mod?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Please do try it out.  Bandits are much more fun when they deal the same damage as other human NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />[b]What gameplay changes should you expect from this mod?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Fighting many bandits at once will not be as easy as killing wolves or skeevers.  They are proud humanoids&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Weak bandits have been promoted to formidable foes at early levels, and nasty henchmen at later levels (They are much harder to &#34;finish off&#34; while fighting higher tier bandits with their new increased HP, and they also now deal X1 damage instead of X0.5).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Do you plan to do something else?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I also released a small mod which changes the Health, Stamina, Magicka and Carry Weight of all ten races in Skyrim, and give those stats to bandits of that race as well.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56660/?]\r<br />Unique Races and Bandits[/url]\r<br />\r<br />I first released this mod for the 100 / 100 /100 vanilla setup because I don&#39;t want to force people to change their stats in case they just wanted &#34;Tougher Bandits&#34;,  I will release that mod as an alternative.",
