  "descriptionHtml": "Well after a testing a little with other INI uploaded and ones I had uploaded a little while back, I noticed FPS could be bad sometimes, removed some settings didn&#39;t do as they were expected/didn&#39;t work or had no impact. \r<br />\r<br />Well I got back into Skyrim, fixed them, had someone who apparently has a great and stable set up send me some INI files, with few settings they copied they didn&#39;t have my default over to them. Tested them got great fps, tweaked a few things, and added comments and I would say they are better overall on everything. \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ll list a few things to check out and that you may want to do. \r<br />\r<br />[size=3]P.S If you use a ENB and have a GTX 980 these INis SHOULD work fine for you off the bat[/size]\r<br />[size=3]P.S2 If you don&#39;t use a ENB remember to edit them, you can safely use Skyrim launcher to do so. But be careful it may reset a few things [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][heading]&#34;[/size][color=#ff7700]I use an ENB what should I change?[/color][size=4]&#34;[/heading][/size]\r<br />[size=2]1. The gamma, it may need adjusted depending on your ENB\r<br />2. BenabledFXAA=1 unless you use other options from drivers to do this you can turn it off. \r<br />3. Change these \r<br />iMaxAnisotropy=1\r<br />iMultiSample=0\r<br />4. \r<br />[/size]Whatever else is listed on ENB page.\r<br />5. [color=#ff0000][size=4]If you don&#39;t use an ENB turn the above setting on or up. Or just get an ENB :D[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][heading] &#34;[color=#ff7700]Whats so special about these INIs than others?[/color] [/heading][/size]\r<br />1. Nothing at all, seriously, they are INI files anyone can make them and edit if they know how, and use Google to find out what each one means.\r<br />2. It removes obsolete lines people still have in their INIs like background which I have found has 0 impact on me whatsoever and others have said the same\r<br />3. Everyone is lazy, okay I&#39;ve done a fresh install many times recreating INIs is boring no one likes typing when you have Skyrim in front off you \r<br />\r<br />[size=4][heading]&#34;[color=#ff7700]Okay I&#39;ve download the INIs now what?[/color]&#34;[/heading][/size]\r<br />1. Once downloaded make a back up of your old INIs located in Documents/My games/Skyrim\r<br />2. There are certain settings you may need to edit depending on what flora mods you use and any graphical mods such as RCRN or ENB and some others.\r<br />3. Its important that you always edit the GPU device line to the one you use or the game will CTD on startup.\r<br />4. SKSE INI can be installed with NMM\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][heading] &#34;[color=#ff7700]Whats with the SKSE INI files?[/color]&#34; [/heading][/size]\r<br />1. I have two SKSE INI files one for 1.7.1/2 and one for SKSE 1.7.3\r<br />2. SKSE INI 1.7.1/2 includes memory patch, tattoos fix, and the invalidregistration that takes time to do but isn&#39;t 100% to work either but helps with save bloating\r<br />3. SKSE INI 1.7.3 includes same as above except for the new features, when you load a save it will tell you what ESPS/Ms are missing since last time, it will also tell you what master file is missing when you CTD. Great for fixing issues. \r<br />\r<br />[size=4][heading]&#34;[color=#ff7700]You said something I may have to change? Well what are they?[/color]&#34;[/heading][/size]\r<br />1. \r<br />This is mainly for non ENB users, you may want to edit the shadow settings if you find them off, I think they are fine however others have opinions.\r<br />2.\r<br />iMaxGrassTypesPerTexure=15 ;change depending on what grass mods you use\r<br />iMinGrassSize=70 ;change depending on what grass mods you use\r<br />Change both of these lines depending on what mods you use, either its SFO only or SFO + UG or SFO + UG + Verdant. \r<br />3.\r<br />[Imagespace]\r<br />bDoDepthOfField=1\r<br />iRadialBlurLevel=2 \r<br />you may want to edit these depending on what ENB you use or RCRN etc. \r<br />4.\r<br />sD3DDevice=&#34;NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980&#34; \r<br />this line needs changed to your own card. \r<br />5. \r<br />You may want to change AA and AF for non ENB users or RCRN users. \r<br />iMaxAnisotropy=1\r<br />iMultiSample=0\r<br />6. \r<br />You may want to turn on Vsync if you don&#39;t use it through ENB or through nvidia control panel \r<br />iPresentInterval=0 \r<br />set to 1.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][heading]&#34;[color=#ff7700]What do you recommend to use since I don&#39;t want to mess with Ugrids?[/color][/heading][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59721/?][size=4]DynDOLOD&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;[/size][/url]\r<br />This mod is amazing for what it does for LOD. Sure its not perfect, sure you cannot see Solitude from Whitrun but it evens it up and fixes a lot that made the game stutter like mad to pause to render crap  in. I would advise suing this with SFO 2.3+ for an amazing tree lod.\r<br />\r<br />its an easy process it just takes time for it too run. Follow on mod install instructions and read it. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][heading]&#34;[color=#ff7700]Some random notes[/color]&#34;[/heading][/size]\r<br />\r<br />1. Never edit papyrus or leave its logging enabled when you don&#39;t use it. I wouldn&#39;t recommend editing its settings unless you need too\r<br />2. Ugrids can cause issues be careful when putting it up",
