  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes the Races to resemble their former Morrowind style Glory.  They each have abilities, weaknesses and powers that truly make them unique.\r\n\r\nI will have a list for the differences eventually but I wanted to get it up now so that old school TES fans can use it right away.  If you MUST know, well, you could either google it, or I believe you have the Creation Kit too pal... Nuff Said\r\n\r\nWARNING: Designed for NEW characters... as far as I know the game will not retroactively update stats so you will not see the benefits/withdrawals for certain races, sorry but thats just the way it is.  Of course there ARE ways around it using the console if you are \\\"Console Savvy\\\"",
