  "descriptionHtml": "Made this sun for a new worldspace I\\'m working on then realised it actually looks good(at least, I think so) in Skyrim as an overall replacer. It\\'s probably not to everyone\\'s taste, but cookies for you if you like it too.\r\n\r\nA point worth mentioning: some weather/lighting mods either use their own, unique sun textures or come with new ones that overwrite the vanilla textures. This mod won\\'t work with the former and will overwrite any files provided by the latter. Use your brain and make backups before installing, if concerned by this :P",
