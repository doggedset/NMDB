This is just a small plugin to boost its usefulness while (hopefully) not making it game breakingly powerful.\r<br />\r<br />Changes to Auriel&#39;s Bow  are as fallows:\r<br />Weight is now equivalent to that of an Elven Bow, while damage has been set to that of a Daedric Bow. Value has been quadrupled to 4000.\r<br />\r<br />I have also alter the enchantment on Auriel&#39;s Bow to have infinite charges.\r<br />\r<br />Changes to Sunhallowed/Bloodcursed Elven Arrow are as fallows:\r<br />Boosted damage to equal that of Daedric Arrow.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]Install[/color][/heading][list=1][*]Extract &#39;Better Auriels Bow.esp&#39; into you Skyrim data folder.\r<br />[*]Start the Skyrim Launcher and place a check mark next to &#39;Better Auriels Bow.esp&#39;.\r<br />[*]Have fun playing Skyrim.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green]Uninstall[/color][/heading]Delete &#39;Better Auriels Bow.esp&#39; from your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=red]Incompatibility[/color][/heading]Mods that make changes to Auriel&#39;s Bow.\r<br />Mods that make changes to Sunhallowed/Bloodcursed Elven Arrow.
