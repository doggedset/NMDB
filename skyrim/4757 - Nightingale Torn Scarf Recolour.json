This will remain as is where is\r\nand not grow into a larger project that looks like a ripoff.\r\n\r\nSorry! if you want other work that should done by/at the will of AlphaDragoon & InfiniDragon\r\nAfter all the torn scarf is theirs\r\n*******************************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a recolour I did of the Nightingale Armor set done by AlphaDragoon & InfiniDragon\r\nAll credit for models and textures goes the that modder. I just loved the Torn scarf and didn\\'t\r\nwish to be the man/woman in black.\r\n\r\nIt will be able to be used to recolour the \\\"Armor Dovahkiin and Forest Elves\\\" if you wish to recolour something stand alone and not over write the Nightingale set\r\n\r\n\r\nThe orginal  mod by AlphaDragoon & InfiniDragon is the following link: (respect great artists)\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3765&navtag=file/images.php?id=3765&tab=3\r\n\r\nI like the look of a Legalos recolour and loved the HD textured and desided to use my low end self tought skill to recolour the torn scarf texture.\r\n\r\nI\\'m sure if the likes of  AlphaDragoon or Psyke23 got hold of these they\\'d do a far better job.\r\ntheres no hood or Cape version I was asked for the files and put them here as is where is, no warrenty or returns the PSD files are there as well.\r\n\r\nIf I got this wrong I\\'m sorry and will pull the file if requested to",
