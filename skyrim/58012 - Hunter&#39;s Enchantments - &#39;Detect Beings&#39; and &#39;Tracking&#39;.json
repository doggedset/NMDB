  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]Hunter&#39;s Enchantments[/size]\r<br />This mods adds two new enchantments to help assassins, thieves and hunters.\r<br />[size=3][u]Requires SKSE.[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Detect Beings[/size]\r<br />Similar to Detect Life but as an enchantment and also showing undead beings.\r<br />I made it so creatures hiding, like Draugr in tombs, are not visible to not ruine the surprise, those are only shown when necoming active.\r<br />There&#39;s also a distinction between agressive and friendly beings. This is just an indication, some beings only become agressive once they see you.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Tracking[/size]\r<br /> Helping to track your pray. When you hit a creature with a waepon with this enchantment, it&#39;ll get a glow that can be seen through walls. The glow will stay visible much farther than Detect Beings.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you like it, let me know if something&#39;s broken&#33;",
