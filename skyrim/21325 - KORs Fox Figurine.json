  "descriptionHtml": "There is not much to say about this mod, and I\\'m not one to drag out a long speech promoting it, so here it goes;\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*] This is a Skyrim version of my Fox Figurine mod for Oblivion [url=http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/38126/?tab=2&navtag=/ajax/modimages/?user=0|:|id=38126] (here)[/url].\r\nThe figurine has havok/collision, so it can be moved and dropped where you\\'d like it to be.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*] It adds a mold to Mercer Freys house, by his plans. With this mold you can smelt 1x Silver Ingot into 4x Fox Figurines by using any forge.\r\nAlternativly you can open up the console and write \\'help fox\\', locate the code for the mold and/or figurines, and write \\'player.additem [the code]\\'.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b]How to install?[/b]\r\nAfter opening / extracting the content of the .zip, move the folders into their respective places, as in the Skyrim game-folder. Then activate the mod with the Skyrim launcher or mod manager of choice.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b]Can I use this mesh and / or texture in my mod?[/b]\r\nSure, why not, use it for whatever you can think of, but please write down my name in the \\'thank to\\', \\'mods used\\' etc of your description :)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*] A request from me however, is that when you steal something really cool, and decide to leave a figurine behind, I would love it if you took a screenshot of your glorious heist!\r\n[/list]",
