  "descriptionHtml": "Rolly has been trapped inside Nchuand-Zel and has finally powered itself down. While assisting Calcelmo in Understone Keep at Markarth, the Dragon Born can find and reactivate Rolly who will happily follow and help by carrying all that extra gear the Dragon Born may be lugging around.\r\n\r\nA dwarven sphere which follows you around and helps hold up to 2000 weight worth of your goodies. Rolly can be found in Nchuand-Zel under Markarth, it will just start following you when it sees you. Rolly wont fight and attacks go right through it. Rolly has a summon spell which allows you to call it to you along with all the gear you stashed on it, never loose your important gear again!\r\n\r\nIt\\'s AI package is a simple follow the player style and so it shouldn\\'t interfere with other followers or follower mods. Rolly is also set to not affect the stealth meter and has LightFoot so it shouldn\\'t set off floor traps.\r\n\r\n***UPDATES***\r\nIf you need to update, I recommend removing your stored gear off of Rolly before updating to a newer version to avoid possible losses.\r\n\r\nUpdate 5/25/2012\r\nQuick fix, forgot to add in the waiting script, all good now.\r\n\r\nUpdate 5/26/2012\r\nMade it so you have to find it and activate it through a dialogue option. This will stop Rolly from instantly appearing next to you when you fast travel and have not found it yet, it also makes it more in line with the story. It\\'s now considered a ghost so attacks go right through it, I\\'ll make an optional killable version if people want that.",
