  "descriptionHtml": "        Well, this is actually the first time that I use Creation Kit to actually make a Mod on my own, so there might be some problems in this Mod, but I will fix them, so please report if you see any bugs.\r\n        This Hideout has two parts: Upper Slave Hideout; where you can rest, but not quite finished yet, and Underground Jail; where you can place your slaves, and they won\\'t escape.\r\n       \r\n\r\n        Ps. the NPCs you see in the images that I uploaded might be different from yours, this is because I used some Mods to improve the looks of NPCs, the MOD however, do not need that in order to run.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nThanks layam for making this nice MOD.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29886//?\r\n\r\nand Emotika which gave me the idea of this MOD.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33462/?",
