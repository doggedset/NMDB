  "descriptionHtml": "===================\r<br />= Leveled List Adder&#33;=\r<br />===================\r<br />\r<br />Our community friend &#34;SIGMALOG&#34; has made a leveled list of the jewelry, get it here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30393\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />UPDATED 19th of January 2013:\r<br />You can now forge Gemmed amulets from Ebony, dragonbone and mixture of gold and silver. Also, in addition to the Chaos Ring, you can now craft a sort of &#34;counter part&#34; for it, the Ankh of Life.\r<br />\r<br />f you like shiny stuff in general, check out my Treasure Crafting mod as well&#33; :D\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23924\r<br />\r<br />UPDATED  6th January 2013:\r<br />I added a new version of the Chaos Ring with unique textures etc. You will need to reach mastery of all the mage skills, excluding enchanting to be able to craft it. Once you do, it&#39;ll show up under the jewelry section.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATED\r<br />Added flawless diamond rings for all material types.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATED\r<br />Added Flawless gem variations of the various gem types for the rings.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATED\r<br />Should now work with custom races.\r<br />\r<br />This mod expands the jewelry crafting to Dwarven, Orcish, Elven, Glass, Ebony, Daedric and Dragonbone. Each material requires their respective smithing ability, so you&#39;ll need Daedric Smithing in order to make daedric rings and amulets.\r<br />\r<br />The prices of the items are quite balanced, so this is not a cheap &#34;get rich quickly&#34; kind of exploit. For instance, daedric amulet is valued 480 gold, but requires 1 ebony ingot and 1 daedra heart with total value of 400 gold.\r<br />\r<br />Just extract the contents of the zip to your: Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;Data so that the data -folder in the zip &#34;overwrites&#34; the data folder in your skyrim folder. Then enable the mod from your Skyrim launcher under Data Files.",
