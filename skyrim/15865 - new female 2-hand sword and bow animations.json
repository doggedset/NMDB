  "descriptionHtml": "*** this mod was originally made for my own game to my own personal tastes if you think it sucks/looks gay/have a burning hatred for a guy named person123456789 please move on ***\r\n*** This doesn\\'t work with NMM. I\\'ve never used NMM before and will probably never learn how to set it up. ***\r\n\r\nupdate 04/30/2012: bow draw animation now notches arrow, 2h sword running animations\r\n\r\n[youtube]Kl8xURH8hCs[/youtube]\r\n[youtube]c42cYzrastc[/youtube]\r\n\r\nThis replaces:\r\n- 2-hand sword idle, turn, and running animations\r\n- bow idle, turn, drawn idle, drawn turn, and arrow draw animations\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions are in the readmes in the respective archives.\r\n\r\nIf you do not want your men acting strange while holding a 2h sword or a bow, you should probably get  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14871]PC Exclusive Animation Path by Raestloz[/url]. I have included a .esp setup so that all vanilla race females use the custom animation folder from this mod, but if you want to use it please refer to Raestloz\\'s original mod link for troubleshooting/conflicts/etc., also be sure to load his .esm before this .esp. \r\n\r\n***note Raestloz\\'s mod does not currently redirect some attack animations, as such some animations files will need to be installed to the vanilla animation folders instead (yes the males will look weird when they use those animations) ***\r\n\r\nBow animations recommended to use with: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1370]Casual bow animations by jaj123[/url]\r\n\r\nAnimations are made from scratch (uses some vanilla parts).\r\nSpecial thanks to Animation Tutorial for 3DsMax by xp32 and aeon. \r\n\r\nThere will probably be many clipping/weird issues due to different body/skeletons people use, please post ss and comment to let me know.\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]For the people asking about clothes:[/b][/size]\r\nClothes used by me in images are most likely not found on nexus. Everything is downloaded from other sites/ported from oblivion/ported from other games. Everything is also edited by me so the body proportions are thinner and longer. Do not ask me for clothes because first of all I most likely do not have copyrights to distribute them, and second of all you will not probably not want them because they clip with everything that isn\\'t made specifically for myself and are beyond anorexic in proportion by nexus standards. Besides all that it would also be too time consuming to get the files together for each individual one for dl.\r\n\r\n[b]tldr: I\\'m not going to reply to inquiries about clothes anymore.[/b]",
