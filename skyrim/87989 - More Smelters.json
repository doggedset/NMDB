  "summary": "Adds additional to specific bandit camps around Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "You know the drill, you just cleared Halted Stream Camp and your pockets are filled with very heavy ore, weighing you down. Where is that smelter when you really need it?! \n<br />\n<br />Well, look no further. This is a very simple but (hopefully) useful mod that adds smelters to three locations I really thought needed them. It was silly that they weren't there in the first place, but Bethesda seems to have a habit of leaving out smelters, even in large cities. I think this is a logical step, because the bandits and Forsworn are obviously smithing, but how are they doing it without smelters? \n<br />\n<br />Now you can find smelters in Embershard Mine,  Halted Stream Camp, and Karthspire Camp. If anyone has any additional location suggestions, feel free to make them and I will add them to the list. Happy Smithing!",
