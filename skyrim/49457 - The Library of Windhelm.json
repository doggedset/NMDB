I thought I would like to combine my passion for house mods and new locations into a new mod. I also included some of my first selfmade scripts. I hope you like what I did here and you enjoy the mod as much as I enjoyed it to create it.\r<br />The mod is fully integrated into the actual game and offers something I always missed at the oldest city of Skyrim. You can use the library of course as a house, as you always can with my mods. The quest is really short, so be not to harsh with me. It was my first quest mod ever. You don&#39;t have\r<br />to worry about the scripts. They are all checked by me and other programmers and are save to run.\r<br />I hope you enjoy the backstory and the hidden treasure that comes with the mod&#33;&#33;\r<br />Yes there is a artifact (BIG THANKS to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2931683/?]RonnieMagnum[/url]) hidden&#33;&#33; Try to find it.\r<br />As always you will find of course the heavy level of deatil and also some nice lightning.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0066ff]Start the quest[/color]\r<br />Just wait for the courier to come.
