  "descriptionHtml": "change de nightingale hood into a dark faceless hood!  ( no eyes and no face )\r\nwork on male and female! (tested both)\r\nall the credit go to gmahadhika because i took his texture to make the mod. the job ive done is quite simple but i made it because I did not find anything similar.\r\n\r\nalso, there is a minor imperfection. because i just blackened the texture, it is possible to see the black face from certain angles and some time when in front of certain light sources it is possible to see some dark reflect of the mask in the hood. in overall its pretty good\r\n\r\n-installation: just put the texture folder in skyrim/data/ directory!\r\n-uninstallation: just remove the file in the nightingale folder in the skyrim/data/texture directory!\r\n\r\nnot my first mod but its my first published mod.\r\nso enjoy",
