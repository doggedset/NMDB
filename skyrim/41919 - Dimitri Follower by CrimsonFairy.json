  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#990000][size=5]Dimitri by CrimsonFairy[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />[size=4]Description[/size]\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />I&#39;ve had a lot of people ask me about him, so I decided to hoard him to myself no longer. :P That&#39;s right, as hard as it is to give away my favorite custom follower I&#39;m releasing him anyway&#33; Because I love these people here and I can be greedy no longer. T^T But do take care of him&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4](Short Background)[/size] Dimitri was raised by his brother Jasper in the Falkreath hold where he mastered the arts of archery and stealth. Dimitri remained in that part of Skyrim for most of his life, even after his brother went off on his own. He often hunts in the surrounding forests of Falkreath and lives in the Dead Man&#39;s Drink. His arrogance, boastfulness, and sometimes humorous but annoying wittiness keeps him from making friends with the local folk, but he usually gains the ladies attention despite all that. He can also be mischievous, cheerful at times, and underneath his mask of callousness (though he denies it constantly) he does care for people.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4](Perks)[/size] He mainly just uses archery. He has perks in archery, one-handed, light armor and sneak.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4](Location)[/size] You can find him at the Dead Man&#39;s Drink in Falkreath. But if you are using the version for users of Interesting NPCs then his location will be at the guard Barracks in Falkreath.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4](Other stuff)[/size]Â I was planning on giving him some dialogue, but I can&#39;t since I have no time for modding anymore, so hopefully the description above provides enough to at least get an idea of what Dimitri&#39;s like.\r<br />\r<br />Dimitri is also a part of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/images/227805/?]The Mercenary series[/url] by me. You might be interested in reading it if you want to know more about his personality and story. I never finished it but the third has a little about Dimitri in it.\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Note from Author (This section isn&#39;t important regarding this mod, so you can skip it if you want.)\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />This will most likely be the last mod I release here on the Skyrim Nexus... I just don&#39;t have time for modding like I used to and I&#39;m not as in to it. Maybe I&#39;ll come back for the next Elder Scrolls game, but for now I&#39;m retiring from modding. It has been so fun, and I&#39;ve learned so much and had a lot of fun. I&#39;d like to thank everyone who ever gave me advice and helped me out, even with the smaller things like pointing me in the direction of a tutorial, and for putting up with me when I still couldn&#39;t figure things out. ;D I also want to thank everyone who has ever left a kind comment on one of my mods, it really did encourage me during modding. ^^ I&#39;ll still be around to monitor my mods and release necessary updates but I just won&#39;t be releasing any completely new mods. Dimitri will be my last released follower, and I hope you all enjoy having him in your game as much as I do.\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />[size=4]Requirements/Recommended[/size]\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />[size=4]Required:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />The standalone male version of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/?]ApachiiSkyHair[/url].
