  "descriptionHtml": "Cleaned, Reset Female Nord - Completed Main Quest - Imperial Victory\r<br />\r<br />I uploaded a female character last year that was a Nord who had completed the Main Quest, Dragonborn Main Quest and Dawnguard Main Quest.\r<br />\r<br />This is another character, but without the Dawnguard or Dragonborn quests.  I BELIEVE this character will work for plain, vanilla game with only the High Resolution pack installed.\r<br />\r<br />The Save Game has been cleaned with Script Scalpel (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53045/?) \r<br />\r<br />She is a Nord. She chose to fight with the Imperials and has executed Ulfric Stormcloak.\r<br />None of the major sub quests are done.  She has killed Grelod the Kind and been invited into the Dark Brotherhood, but has not gone to the door yet.  She has not joined the Companions, has never been a werewolf or a vampire.  She has been invited to join the Thieve&#39;s Guild, but has not started &#34;Taking Care of Business&#34; yet.",
