  "modName": "Dawnstar Sanctuary Invisible Nightmother Fix",
  "summary": "A simple fix for an issue I ran into. Hail Sithis&#33; bugged on me and I was forced to complete with console commands. This prevented the Nightmother from appearing in the sanctuary. This mod was the quickest and easiest way to fix it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I am not a pro modder by any means, but I was able to fix an issue I had with the Nightmother spawn in DS Sanctuary. Recommended you DO NOT install until the bug happens, and remove if you start a new game. I won&#39;t really hurt anything, but the first time you step into DS Sanctuary the Nightmother will already be there. Simply removed the &#34;initially disabled&#34; option from her coffin to make her reappear. I did not find much on this glitch, but then again I do have a heavily modded game. Though I would throw this out there if anyone else had this issue.",
