  "summary": "a castle with a rich intense story.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Wolfpack was founded by Kyle. Soon after lead by Faloan. While Kyle and Evander are running it in the background. The story will have deceptive and a unique attachment of loyalty and trust that you will get from followers to come. First we will release the castle for you to enjoy then we will add the npcâ€™s short after. All I have to say is, be prepared for an amazing story that you will love. This is our first mod so criticism is welcomed. And we are open to ideas from anyone. ENJOY :)",
