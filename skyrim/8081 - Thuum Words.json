I\\'ve written them by hadn in about two hours, so it won\\'t be surprise if I\\'ve mistyped something.\r\n\r\nP.S. It\\'s my first mod ever, so don\\'t be too harsh on me especially if what I\\'ve done is pointless. I\\'ve done it mostly because I felt like it\\'s fun way to learn some new words.\r\n\r\nP.P.S. I think I\\'ve forgotten to upload the file yesterday. So I uploaded it now. Sorry",
