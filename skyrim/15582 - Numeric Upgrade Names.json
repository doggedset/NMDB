  "modName": "Numeric Upgrade Names",
  "summary": "Replaces weapon/armor upgrade names with numbers",
  "descriptionHtml": "Overview:\r\nJust a very basic mod that changes how upgraded items are named. Some items\\' names were getting too long to fit comfortably in the limited amount of space, so I replaced the words with a simple D&D styled number system. Unfortunately, this does not remove the parentheses.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n+1 :: Fine\r\n+2 :: Superior\r\n+3 :: Exquisite\r\n+4 :: Flawless\r\n+5 :: Epic\r\n+6 :: Legendary\r\n\r\nPlanned Updates:\r\nNone needed, and should work for all game versions, save for future patches which potentially add more ranks. Highly unlikely.\r\n\r\nConflicts and Compatibility:\r\nShould be perfect for all versions of the game, and will conflict only with mods that alter the 12 GMST strings I\\'ve modified.\r\n\r\nHistory:\r\n1.0 :: Initial release, contained unnecessary junk data\r\n1.1 :: Fixed, cleaned\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf for some reason somebody beat me to this, as my search for similar mods was brief at best, I apologize and will remove mine as soon as it\\'s brought to my attention.",
