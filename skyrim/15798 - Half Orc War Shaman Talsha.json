  "summary": "Female Half Orc Companion",
  "descriptionHtml": "Talsha is the offspring of an Orc Shaman and a Nord Warmaiden. Though she respects the heritage given to her by her mother; Talsha chose to embrace the Orc side of her ancestry and follows the ways of the Orcish tribes while still respecting the laws and customs of the Nords. \r\n\r\nShe was designed with weaker characters and ranged characters in mind (she is tank oriented in her ability). I also designed her to be a capable companion for new characters (which is why her location is in Riverwood). \r\n\r\nShe will mainly use melee, but will also summon a spirit wolf (mainly to act as an aggro sink for enemies) and has the ability to turn undead (though she will often chose to fight them in combat which was done so on purpose to reflect her Orc mentality in combat).\r\n\r\nYou can find her in The Sleeping Giant Inn of Riverwood.\r\n\r\nThis companion will appear nude when you first meet her. This was done so that she will wear any clothing as well as any armor you give to her. I know it is immersion breaking and I wish there was a way around it but this currently the only solution to allowing people to use both clothing and armor mods on companions that I\\'m aware of.\r\n\r\nShe will also auto level from level 8 to level 80, and her perks and skills revolve around Two Handed, Light Armor, Heavy Armor, and minor usage of magic. She comes with an Orcish warhammer just in case you adopt her at a low level and don\\'t quite have the resources to provide her with a decent weapon yet. \r\n\r\nLike all of my other companion mods; Talsha will loiter around in the area that you dismiss her once you tell her you want to part ways (drop her as a companion). So if you can\\'t find her after you ask her to leave your service make sure to go back to where you left her. I set her AI up this way so that you can leave her in a convenient place and she won\\'t wonder off (you can also have her stay behind in one of your houses until you want her to tag along with you again). Remember that ALL of my companion mods have this feature.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This mod must have the following mod in order to work correctly:\r\n\r\n:::Apachii Sky Hair:::\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\n\r\nIf you have issues with hair colors turning dark when near light sources; download the vanilla hair option on Apachii\\'s page and that should fix the issue.\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\nPlace the zip file\\'s contents into your Skyrim/data folder to install and be sure to activate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing. Ensure that the Apachii Sky Hair ESP and ESM are ABOVE Talsha\\'s data files in your load order (I\\'d recommend placing Talsha\\'s files dead last in the load order so there are no conflicts).\r\n\r\nRecommended (but not required) mods to get her as she appears in the screen shots:\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFeatured outfit mod: \r\nRemodeled Armor CBBEv3 (Hide Armor from this mod is shown)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13004#\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCBBE V3 (standard body) and the hip texture compatability pack:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nBella\\'s Better Females version 3:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nCover Eyes (eyes 1 file):\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Blackie for his CM New Companions mod that includes a top-notch detailed tutorial on how to create Skyrim companions without the face discoloration bug. Get his mod and tutorial (contained in the mod) here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11669\r\n\r\nThe work around I found for the bug with Bella\\'s face mod (the bug involving women looking like they have faint beard stubble on their jawline and chin) is to use the standard Better Faces Version 3, and then apply the \\\"No Shine\\\" option available on her mod page.\r\n\r\nSpecial note: All of my future companions after Divada, Taja, Viin, and Kyia will be made using the Better Females by Bella mod. I switched to another mod set for faces previously due to a bug I couldn\\'t resolve (the issue with females having faint male beard stubble on their faces while using Bella\\'s). I have resolved that issue, so I\\'ll be going back to Bella\\'s for my projects from now on. You DO NOT have to switch to Bella\\'s if you use Envision faces and RANs Headmesh (what I used previously) OR if you use other face mods. All of my companions should work with other face/body mods and vanilla setups unless specifically mentioned in the description.\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy taking Talsha with you on your adventures.\r\n\r\nI recommend a manual install of this mod (read me included in the zip file). Install with Nexus Mod Manager at your own risk.\r\n\r\nThe ENB I use (which is why there\\'s a difference in screen shots as opposed to previous companion releases) is Cinematic Lighting ENB which you can check out here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4142\r\n\r\nRemember to endorse files from the Nexus if you like them...it\\'s a small notion of thanks that all modders appreciate. Thanks for taking the time to look over my mods and I hope you enjoy them.\r\n\r\nNote to other modders: Feel free to use any of my companions to compliment/show off your mods if you like my work. If you have custom armor or weapons, feel free to use any of my companions to model them for you. I\\'m a firm believer that modders working together equals more mods for all of us to enjoy.",
