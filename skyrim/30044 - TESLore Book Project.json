  "summary": "Adds a few books based around really good essays over on reddit.com/r/teslore. Books added over time, check back for new books! ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever thought to yourself \\\"I wish there were more books interesting books in this game?\\\" Have you ever wondered how a mage would cast spells without hands? How Mundus is structurally similar to the human nervous system? Have you wanted to sing a song dedicated to the Skyforge? Ever wanted to know why the Dwemer kept the Falmer in Blackreach? What an expedition to various realms of Oblivion would be like? Well I got them all! \r\n\r\nThis is a compendium of various good posts on the phenomenal reddit.com/r/teslore board, all imported into Skyrim as skillbooks. The mod will be updated fairly regularly, and with fresh new content each time it does. All the books are added to book clutter lists, so they will be found wherever books show up. In addition, if you want to add a sense of adventure, they have also been added to Urag gro-Shub\\'s list of books to find. \r\n\r\nHappy hunting! \r\n\r\nCurrent Book List: \r\nBooks are all added to book clutter lists and Urag gro-Shub\\'s book-fetching list. Some books are added to certain vendors. Use your logic to find them.\r\n\r\nFor example: New Words by Clan Mother Raphaarmi, a book about the Khajiit creation myth, is sold by the Khajiit caravans.\r\n\r\nPhase 1 Books\r\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/4920479/TESLore%20Book%20Project/Phase%201%20book%20list.txt\r\n\r\nPhase 2 (The Books Strike Back)\r\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/4920479/TESLore%20Book%20Project/Phase%202%20book%20list.txt\r\n\r\nFuture Book List (Subject to Change)\r\nEach new phase will have 9 books in it. Just so I can have more regular updates.\r\nPhase 3 (Return Of The Books)\r\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/4920479/TESLore%20Book%20Project/Phase%203%20book%20list.txt\r\n\r\nAll posts taken with permission from the authors. \r\n\r\nIf you want to suggest books added in the future, stick \\'em in the comments. No guarantees, but they might get in. I will only take stuff from /r/teslore for now. ",
