  "descriptionHtml": "Birk Bassison is a slightly taller that average Nord NPC from a poor farmer family. He can be found in Rorikstead. He is a potential husband as well as a battle mage, specialising in destruction and conjuration (though not necromancy).\r\n\r\nHe starts out at level 40, and will level up with the player.\r\n\r\nIf there are any problems let me know and I will see if I can fix it.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who may be wondering, the robes are part of a comprehensive clothing retexture mod which is not required.
