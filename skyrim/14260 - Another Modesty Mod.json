  "summary": "Replaces underwear with a modest Minor Clothes outfit, and substitutes some of the revealing armors and outfits for more modest alternatives.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Replaces underwear and some revealing outfits with more modest alternatives. In particular:\r\n\r\n1) Stealing clothes from a person or dead body no longer leaves them in their underwear. Now, they have a nice set of miner clothes under their clothes!\r\n2) Some NPC types have traded their low-cut dresses in for ones with a higher neckline.\r\n3) Forsworn Armor, Bandit Armor, and some Hide Armors have been replaced with a full Hide Armor Cuirass (the stats should be the same as before, only the appearance should be different)\r\n\r\nKnown bugs:\r\n1) Khajiit will appear to have a human torso/arms/legs under their clothing or armor. This is a side effect of giving them the Miner Clothes outfit, and I don\\'t currently know how to fix it. =(\r\n\r\nIf you find a good fix for the known bugs, or find another bug or another instance of immodesty that needs modding, please let me know! Thanks =)\r\n\r\n\r\n(thanks to the author of this other modesty mod -- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3681#content -- for, though I have not tested that mod, the description reminded me of a lot of armors/clothings that needed replacing)",
