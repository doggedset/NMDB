  "descriptionHtml": "Rakasha is a boss level Khajiit bandit follower.  He wants to retire someday and buy an island.  But for now he has decided to follow the Dragonborn in search of treasure and adventure.  He&#39; levels at 1.15x to 95 and his mastery of the great sword is amazing.  Now Includes a fear inducing tiger growl when attacking.  Rakasha decapitates staggered opponents instead of waiting for them to get up.\r<br />\r<br />Rakasha requires nothing more than Skyrim with the official update.  But he likes MKT textures and Bulky Skeleton found elsewhere on Nexus.  Because who wants a weedy looking tiger bandit companion&#33;   Images show Rakasha with these mods (I think)  Muscular Khajiit Textures http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim /mods/40043/  and  Bulky Skeleton for Beast Race http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61132/\r<br />\r<br />Rakasha has his own combat style and adds some kill move animation tweeks but he should be compatible with everything.   Tested with EFF, Jeek Half-Dragon and a bunch of other mods, so far I&#39;ve had no mod compatibility problems with him. \r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll find Rakasha in Honningbrew Meadery.",
