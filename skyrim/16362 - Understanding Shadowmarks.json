  "descriptionHtml": "Thanks for your interest in this mod.\r\n\r\nFirstly, this mod would not have been possible without the invaluable help of Balok from\r\nthe Official Elder Scrolls Skyrim Modding Forum who guided me on the first step of using primitives in the CK.\r\n\r\nOfficial Forum WIP Thread\r\nhttp://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1370675-ideawipneeds-help-understanding-shadowmarks/\r\n\r\nThis post will be separated into sections to better explain my intention with this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nMod Description:\r\n=============\r\nWhat is a Shadowmark?\r\nhttp://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Shadowmarks_%28Marks%29\r\nShadowmarks are symbols utilized by the Thieves Guild, so that buildings throughout Skyrim can quickly be \r\nidentified by Guild members as to their potential usage. The symbols are usually carved next to the building\\'s doorway. \r\n\r\nWhile there are Shadowmarks all over skyrim, i always don\\'t remember what each \r\nmark stands for and have to keep referring to the Shadowmark ingame book for reference.\r\n\r\nSo i got to thinking if there is a way to somehow make it so that if a shadowmark \r\nis activated, there will be a text appear eg: \\\"Shadowmark: Loot\\\" LOL call me a lazy thief :D\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat this mod does:\r\n==================\r\nPlayer can go near the Shadowmark, and there will be a message \\\"Activate Strange Symbol\\\".\r\nUpon activating, a message box will say \\\"Shadowmark: XXX\\\" where XXX denotes the information of the shadowmark. Eg: Shadowmark: Loot\r\n\r\nThere are currently no pre-requisites required to do this. Just walk up to a Shadowmark and activate it.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate Log:\r\n==========\r\nv1.1 - \r\nLargest Update so far:\r\n- Did some minor shadowmarks position adjustments and added some Shadowmarks that i missed out in Whiterun in v1.0\r\n- Completed ALL known Shadowmarks in Skyrim. Below is a more detailed list of Shadowmarks edited in v1.1:\r\n\r\n- Shadowmarks in CK Tamriel Worldspace are completed. (Actually theres only 1 shadowmark found)\r\n- Shadowmarks in Windhelm are completed\r\n- Shadowmarks in Markath are completed\r\n- Shadowmarks in Riften are completed\r\n- Shadowmarks in Solitude are completed\r\n- Shadowmarks in Dwemer Ruin Irkngthand are completed\r\n\r\nv1.0 - Initial Release (City of Whiterun Added)\r\n\r\nvAlpha - Proof of Concept\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs/Incompatibilities:\r\n============================\r\n1) This mod will not provide the same functionality for custom shadowmarks that may be added by other mods. \r\nPlease let me know if such a mod exists and i\\'ll see what i can do to make it compatible.\r\n\r\n2) I may have done some minor shifting of the default shadowmarks positions but nothing game breaking. \r\nIt should still be very compatible with all mods out there, even those that change the textures of Shadowmarks.\r\n\r\n3) Have not really extensively tested out every single Shadowmarks so there might be some that I might have left out, or not work correctly. If you do find one, I would appreciate it if you could take a screenshot of it together with a short description where this errant shadowmark can be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Upgrades/Expansion\r\n=========================\r\nI plan to make it such that only players who have read the Shadowmark ingame book AND finished the quest \\\"Taking Care of Business\\\" will be able to see the meaning of the Shadowmark. Players who did not fulfill these 2 conditions will see a message stating \\\"This strange symbol is unfamiliar to you\\\".\r\n\r\nMy current scripting skill is very novice and the above function is kindda hard to implement.\r\n\r\nIf you are able to help me in anyway especially in the scripting, it would be very much\r\nappreciated. I will certainly credit you in this mod if it ever releases :)\r\n\r\nPlease kindly provide your comments or participate in the forum thread at\r\nhttp://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1370675-ideawipneeds-help-understanding-shadowmarks/ if you wish to assist.\r\n\r\nI seek your kind patience as i am very new to Skyrim Modding and even more noobish at scripting,\r\nso this mod might not be finished as soon as i want it to be. RL also intrudes sometimes :D\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n======\r\nBethesda Game Studios - For bringing us the best RPG of this generation.\r\n\r\nBalok - For his guidance in providing me the first steps in the creation of this mod.
