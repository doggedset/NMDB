Read this ===================\r\n\r\nHow to add alpha and a body to the MESH:\r\nOpen ***BODY***_0.nif and ***MESH***_0.nif in 2 windows. Copy the MESH main node name(txt) to BODY\\'s main node name. Copy the branch from BODY that contains the body (NiTriShape, not the main node) and paste it in the main MESH node. If you get errors, you need to copy whatever\\'s missing from the BODY to the MESH main node AND copy paste the txt name from the BODY.\r\nThen you add the NiAlphaProperty to the NiTriShape that contains the armor/clothes AND add the reference to that alpha in NiTriShape by changing Ref from \\'none\\' to whatever number your alpha has. Your alpha will become linked, otherwise it\\'ll be sitting under the main node and won\\'t do you any good.\r\nDefault Skyrim alpha settings are: flags 4844, threshold 128 which means no blending and the alpha is either on or off.\r\nTo add alpha to the texture: open *.dds with DXTBMP.exe, add alpha channel and save.
