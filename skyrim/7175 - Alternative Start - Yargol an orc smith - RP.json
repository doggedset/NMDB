  "summary": "Having lived a life secluded from society in his mountain stronghold of Narzulbur, Yargol takes his first steps into society while tracking a dragon.  ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Narzulbur has been Yargol\\'s home since his birth.  He was a good blacksmith like all orcs but then raised above his kinsmen and became the local smith of Narzulbur.  After advancing his black smith skills as far as he could in his stronghold he turned to magic to make his armor more powerful.  He soon became the local enchanter too.  Even though his skills would make him a excellent crafter, his true dream is to be a dragon slayer.  When a dragon is seen flying overhead traveling west, Yargol asks the chief permission to leave.  The chief grants permission.  The chief then gives Yargol a set of orcish armor and lays out some weapons on the table.  He then tells Yargol that dragons are mighty beings and tangling with one on your own is suicide.  He tells Yargol he must get help from Whiterun\\'s jarl to slay this beast.  Yargol is then faced with the hardest choice of his life, should he take the two war axes or the battleaxe.  Lucky for him he wont have to, since you, the player, take over and make the choice for him.  \r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nAOF Believable Hair-Female and Male- (I used this to boost the hair quality in the screenshot)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4307\r\n\r\nXCE - Xenius Character Enhancement (I used this to boost the characters looks in the screenshot)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356\r\n\r\nRecommendations: (I, of course, recommend the mods I used above along with these)\r\nWeapons of the Third Era\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3871\r\n\r\nA Quality World Map - With Roads\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4929\r\n\r\nCompelling Treasure Maps\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6907\r\n\r\nDeadly Dragons\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3829\r\n\r\nDFB Companion Bow Visible\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6520\r\n\r\nDovahkiin Hideout\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6032\r\n\r\nFirewood For Sale\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5653\r\n\r\nI Put A Spell On You - More Enchanting Options \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3313\r\n\r\nJaySuS Swords \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1002\r\n\r\nLord Armor\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5853\r\n\r\nMidas Magic - Spells in Skyrim\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3413\r\n\r\nNPC Bartering\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6802\r\n\r\nPhenderix Magic Evolved - 144 New Spells\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5898\r\n\r\nPricier and Heavier Pelts and Hides \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7039\r\n\r\nQuick Tomb Looting\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6591\r\n\r\nSkyrim Performance PLUS\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6387\r\n\r\nSkyrim Nordplate Enhanced\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6804\r\n\r\nWars in Skyrim IV - Dark Rainbow is back-\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6176\r\n\r\nWitchers Blades\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6253\r\n\r\nVarious Guards Outfit for Every City TS Edition \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6770\r\n\r\nBugs/Issues\r\nIf there are any problems feel free to voice them in the comments section which I will try to check back often",
