  "descriptionHtml": "New expert level conjuration spell Conjure Lurker, obtainable via Dremora Merchant (Black Market power from Dragonborn DLC) to make it more balanced. Conjures a Lurker for 60 (120) seconds to fight for you, works with Twin Souls and you can have two of them, he autolevels and is based on common Lurker with upgraded attack, didnt use Lurker Vindicator as template as he is way too strong, not that this one is weak :) Since Lurkers are rather large be careful where you summon them.\r<br />\r<br />Also Dremora Merchant now has 10.000 gold instead of 2000 in order to make him a more viable merchant. 2000 is nearly useless for trading.\r<br />\r<br />WARNING - It does not work properly with Unofficial Skyrim Patches (fails nearly every time), I dont know why, flags in the spell are correctly set and I tried moving the esp up and down in the load order but nothing helps, I will try to find a solution and update the mod if I find it. If you know of a fix send me a pm or write in the comments please :)\r<br />\r<br />Spell works perfectly normal with regular Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim 1.9\r<br />Dawnguard\r<br />Dragonborn\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Unpack the archive to Skyrim/Data.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />\r<br />Delete ConjureLurker.esp",
