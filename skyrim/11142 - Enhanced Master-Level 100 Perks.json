  "modName": "Enhanced Master-Level 100 Perks",
  "summary": "This mod adds a special effect to all of the level 100 perks.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Every single level 100 perk (besides Daedric smithing) is enhanced with an additional effect. This mod also removes precursor perk requirements. If you have 100 points in  a skill, you should be able to get the master perk. The highest alchemy perk is completely changed, however, to increase potion selling prices. All the effects are listed in the pictures. This may override or be overriden by other mods. If anyone has any suggestions or bugs please tell me.",
