  "descriptionHtml": "This mod was made for Wizard Hats by sirwho at Skyrim Nexus.\r<br />It Retextures the Brown, Green, Grey, Red, White and Yellow hats to match some of the rustic \r<br />textures of Blanket Scarf Retexture Earth Tones Edition by Jasper, and the two mods are meant to be \r<br />used together. \r<br />It&#39;s a pretty crude retexture so don&#39;t expect the names to describe the colors they&#39;re matching up with properly. lol\r<br />I avoided tampering with the Beige, Black and Blue variants because they&#39;re made to go with\r<br />commonly worn mage npc sets. \r<br />The other hats are only assigned to Court Wizards, and can be removed from them with this method: \r<br />&#34; Simply go into TES5Edit. Expand the esp and go to the &#34;Outfits&#34; section. It will list the court wizards outfits with their names in them. Right click on them and select &#34;Remove&#34;.\r<br />Close TES5Edit, make sure in the pop up screen the esp is selected and only the esp. Un-tick &#34;back-up Plugins&#34;.\r<br />Done. This eliminates the court wizard outfits while keeping the rest of the mod intact. &#34; \r<br />- rentak\r<br />Credits: \r<br />Jasper on Skyrim Nexus for providing the wonderful textures, and retexture for the Blanket Scarf that inspired this.\r<br />Sirwho on Skyrim Nexus for making the wizard hats. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Heres a guide of which Wizard Hat matches which Blanket Scarf:\r<br />Wizard Hat Brown - BlanketScarf 1\r<br />Wizard Hat Green - BlanketScarf 7\r<br />Wizard Hat Grey - BlanketScarf 16\r<br />Wizard Hat Red - BlanketScarf 2\r<br />Wizard Hat White - BlanketScarf 20\r<br />Wizard Hat Yellow - BlanketScarf 5\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />----------------\r<br />Installation: \r<br />Download and install Wizard Hats by sirwho at Skyrim Nexus.\r<br />Drag the Data folder into your TESV.exe folder. \r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />Remember where you put the textures and remove &#39;em lol.\r<br />Or re-install the Wizard Hats mod. ",
