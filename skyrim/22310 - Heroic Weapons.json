  "descriptionHtml": "Heroic Weapons provide the Nord Hero look as a &#39;&#39;cosmetic&#39;&#39; alternative for higher tier weapon crafting. The weapons must be crafted at the Skyforge, and require Ancient Nord (Draugr) weapons as components. They do not require completion of the Companions questline, however.\r<br />\r<br />There are three tiers of weapons available to craft: Heroic weapons are equivelent to Glass; Improved Heroic weapons are equivalent to Ebony; and Superior Heroic weapons are equivalent to Daedric. The Improved and Superior recipes require the higher quality Honed Ancient weapons as components.\r<br />\r<br />Includes recipes for:\r<br />\r<br />Arrows\r<br />Battleaxe\r<br />Bow\r<br />Greatsword\r<br />Sword\r<br />War Axe\r<br />\r<br />Also includes a fix for the Nord Hero Bow, allowing it to be tempered.\r<br />\r<br />These weapons are designed for use with the Heroic Armor sets, http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=19008333",
