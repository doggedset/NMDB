Simple, quick, magic.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nThe player will first see the Magic Box near Honningbrew Meadery outside Whiterun. \r\n\r\nUpon activation you will also meet it\\'s creator.\r\n\r\nMap location in mod folder/images.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nAdds 2 new spells to the game. One that lets you summon a Magic Box, the other that lets you open it\\'s inventory without having to do anything else than cast a spell. Access and summon your Magic Box from anywhere in Tamriel, summon multiple Magic Boxes, different boxes, same inventory. Simple, quick, magic.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n1. Copy the .esp file and Scripts folder to (install folder)\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n2. Start Skyrim Launcher, click \\'Data Files\\', place a checkmark beside the .esp file.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file.\r\n2. Delete the .esp file from (install folder)\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nNo incompatibility issues.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nThe chests will spawn underneath the player facing the same way. This is semi intentional as it allows precise placements for however you want it to look and I couldn\\'t get it to work with target locations.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0, 3/24/2012 - Initial release.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nYou can find me on the official Bethesda forums as \\'PR0 6AM3R\\'\r\nYou can find me on the Nexuses as \\'PR0 6AM3R\\'\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to everyone in the modding community for helping me when I needed it.\r\nThanks to Bethesda for a great series of games.\r\nThanks to SkyrimNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop for modders and players.\r\nThanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator.\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nCreation Kit\r\n7-Zip - http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=15579\r\nReadme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nYou can do whatever you want with this mod but all I ask in return is that you give me credit if you distribute any part of this mod.
