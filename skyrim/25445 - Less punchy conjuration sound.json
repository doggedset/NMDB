  "modName": "Less punchy conjuration sound",
  "summary": "This mod simply reverses the vanilla conjuration-sound and lowers its volume, too. \r\n\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "I thought it\\'d be nice not to sh*t my pants every time i conjured whatever thingy. I am most certain others had a similar idea already, however, this is my version of it. If there are others having a patent pending, go ahead and sue me for not using google properly :-P\r\n\r\nI edited the File \\\\sound\\\\fx\\\\mag\\\\conjure\\\\mag_conjure_fire.wav, reversed the file, and lowered the volume. From what i can hear ingame it blends in pretty well, but i must admit that i have not yet tested it during harsh battles. I guess it should work fine though. \r\n\r\nFor installing this mod simply download it with NMM and hit activate/deactivate\r\n\r\nAlternatively just plant the file mag_conjure_fire.wav into the data\\\\sound\\\\fx\\\\mag\\\\conjure folder or remove it in case you want to deinstall. \r\n\r\n",
