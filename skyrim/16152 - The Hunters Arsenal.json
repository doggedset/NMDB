  "descriptionHtml": "A set of forest camo hunting gear. Creates a new set of leather armor, hunting bow, and iron dagger, all re-textured with different shades of green to give them that foresty feel. To be clear, this does NOT re-texture ALL items, just this specific set. It should also be compatible with all vanilla races.\r\n\r\nThe new gear also has and increased armor/damage amount, and a corresponding increase in value.\r\nIt also replaces the generic hunters armor and weapons with the new gear. I mean, they\\'re hunters right? Shouldn\\'t they have hunting gear too? The answer is yes. Yes they should.\r\n\r\nThe gear can be found at \\\"Hunter\\'s Rest\\\" to the North West of Falkreath. It\\'s inside a chest inside the cabin. Look at the pictures if you don\\'t know where to go. Or if your really lazy, pull up the console (~) and type \\\"imabigfatlazybum\\\"\r\n\r\nAlso available on the Steam Workshop. Check the mirror tab for the link.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, comments or suggestions please let me know!\r\n\r\n\r\n========================================================================================\r\n\r\nv1.0-\r\n\r\nInitial release\r\n\r\nv2.0-\r\n\r\nRecreated the textures (should be darker, havent updated pictures yet)\r\nAdded special versions of gear with appropriate enchantments.",
