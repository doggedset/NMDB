  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://www.wizards.com/magic/images/cardart/TSP/Vesuvan_Shapeshifter_640.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Check out Jackal&#39;s other mod: \r<br />[color=#ff7700][font=Comic Sans MS]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8784/?[/font]\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Ok so its been a long time since i have done anything with skyrim (let alone played it) and have sorta looked back into it, but I still do not know if I want to spend the time needed to keep this updated, plus i would have to reinstall skyrim :P... at some point in time i may come back to this but for now it&#39;ll have to wait for my life to slow down a lil. Also this has been changed back to beta, b/c it hasnt been updated for a while an there is a ton more stuff that can be done.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=red]THIS IS NOT MY WORK, I GOT PERMISSION FROM AbPocalypse (Jackalhead) TO POST THIS MOD ON THIS SITE, IN NO WAY CAN THIS BE REPOSTED ANYWHERE ELSE WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM AbPocalypse (Jackalhead), DOING SO WILL MAKE AN INSTANT REPORTING EMINENT REPORTA.[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Watch the videos and most questions will be answered, If you want to fly WEREDRAGON mod is a good mod for that.\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=5]///////This mod adds spells that will allow you to transform into many of the creatures of skyrim.///////[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Remember to update skyrim, or will not work.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Right now you have to use console command &#34;coc unownedcell&#34; to get the spells, but maybe I can convince Jackal to either let me or he does it himself, to move it to a shop or something like that.\r<br />\r<br />The exe file is optional, but if you do not use it you have to use console &#34;bat r&#34; and that should change you back.\r<br />\r<br />All you lvls and stats should stay the same, but if not PM me and I will start a Buglist for Jackal.\r<br />\r<br />At some point I will add a list of the available transformation spells.\r<br />\r<br />[color=blue]Remember if you like it, endorse it[/color]\r<br />\r<br />///Master Shape Shifter by Jackalhead///\r<br />/////////jackalhead@live.com////////////\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-- 1 Important Thing to Remember While Playing Master Shape Shifter 2.8 --\r<br />\r<br />In order to get the spells you must go to Lord Jared&#39;s Hideout in forsaken cave.  The fast way to do this is\r<br />&#39;coc unownedcell&#39; in the console command.  Once there, go down the stairs in front of you to the daedric worship\r<br />shrine.  Next to the bloody bowl of skulls will be a chest loaded with polymorph spell tomes.  Take whichever\r<br />ones interest you and leave the rest.  Do not use PSB to get the spells or for some reason you won&#39;t be able to\r<br />use the monster&#39;s shouts (such as if you become a dragon, draugr or afflicted).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][size=5]DO NOT TRY TO JUMP WHILE A DRAGON, U WILL CRASH, it is trying to fly when you do that, and normally it has a lot of script to do this and this mod does not enable that script. WEREDRAGON has flying capabilities and so does a few other mods. If you want to fly you need to get one of those.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Also I do not know how to make it so you are behind the dragon and not under it. If some one could tell me It would be greatly appriciated (This might be from me installing another mod so if no one else has had this problem, then I will have to find out which mod did that)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />-- How to Install --\r<br />\r<br />1. Extract the Room.esp file, Meshes, Textures and Scripts folders into your Data folder.  Click Yes to All, if \r<br />asked to overwrite. ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR SCRIPTS FOLDER BEFORE REPLACING ITS CONTENTS&#33;\r<br />\r<br />2. Extract JackalheadPolymorph and the BAT files to your main Skyrim directory.  The bat file is called r.txt.\r<br />\r<br />3. Run the AutoHotKey Installer and check yes in all three boxes.  \r<br />\r<br />4. Once that is installed and before each time you play, run the JackalheadPolymorph.exe file you put in your \r<br />Skyrim directory.  While this is running in the background the following hotkeys will have their described \r<br />affects in game.  \r<br />\r<br />   F1 - While in polymorph form, this will instantly shape shift you back to your original self.\r<br />      Do not use this in normal form, unless you want a bunch of worthless staves called\r<br />      &#39;polymorph human form&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />For about 20% of the beta testers, there were issues with the autohotkey &#39;F1&#39; not shape shifting them back to \r<br />their normal form. If this is the case for you, try reinstalling autohotkeys and making sure that all three \r<br />check boxes are checked in the installer. If this still doesn&#39;t resolve it, you can use the console command \r<br />bat r&#39; to shape shift back to your default form.\r<br />   \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Links:\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIjRGd88mVM[/youtube]  [move][b][color=orange][size=5]Check it out[/size][/color][/b][/move]\r<br />\r<br />Be sure to read the readme file to know how to install this mod correctly&#33; Enjoy. :]\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------­---------------------------\r<br />Tutorial To Make Your Own Shape Shifting Spells:\r<br />\r<br />http://jaredbangerter.hubpages.com/hub/How-to-Play-as-Monsters-In-Skyrim:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------­-------------------------\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />ABSOLUTELY NO USE OF THS MOD ANYWHERE ELSE WITHOUT AbPocalypse&#39;s (Jackalhead) PERMISSION&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />DEVELOPER:\r<br />\r<br />Jackalhead - Mod Creator\r<br />\r<br />ReaperzKing - Updates\r<br />\r<br />BETA TESTERS:\r<br />\r<br />Elste17\r<br />Voom101\r<br />Spartan1849\r<br />Kridlekid\r<br />Skyes666\r<br />Hejpadig\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />REMEMBER TO BACK UP ALL SAVES BEFORE YOU INSTALL ANY MODS",
