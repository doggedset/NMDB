  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod on Nexus. Go easy on me if I forgot/screw up something. \r\n\r\nThis mod adds a none-replacer retexture version of the ancient nord armor. More specifically, it adds one armor fitted for all race, gender and size, and this armor is offered in 4 favors: Ancient, heavy version of the armor, Light, light version of the armor, Powered, heavy version of the armor with enchantment pre-chosen by me, and Ascended, which is the light version with enchantments.\r\n\r\nThis armor is not found anywhere, but it can be crafted by anyone at any forge. No perks requirement, not even for tempering the enchanted versions. \r\n\r\nList of enchantments: \r\nBoots - 30% faster movement speed \r\nGauntlets - 30% more damage with destruction magic and one-handed weapons\r\nArmor - 25% magic resistance\r\nHelmet - 150 % regen of both stamina and magicka\r\n(you CAN disenchant the item, but not re-enchant them back on another item. So yeah, don\\'t break your toys for nothing)\r\nIf you want a speed enchantment you can put anywhere, check this mod out: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8160\r\nIf you want a fortify  destruction damage enchantment you can put anywhere, check this mod out: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14210\r\n\r\nOn the subject of armor rating: Since the ancient nord armor (which is the original version) kind of sucks, I decided to double the armor rating for the heavy version. For the light version, I kept the rating as is, but halfed the weight.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, I play and balance in expert. So yeah, some of you might find it a tad OP. \r\n\r\nThe recipe is in-game, just check at the closest forge under the \\\"daedric\\\" category. \r\n\r\nDon\\'t be shy, leave a comment, leave an endorsement if you like the mod. \r\n\r\nRemember, report every bugs related to my armor. \r\n\r\nUPDATE 1.9: Added two colors, green and blue, because why the hell not. I may just add a better glowing effect, and changing the colors gave me a reason to open GIMP again. \r\n\r\nI highly suggest you modify your color of runing yourself if you can/want. Customization is always awesome. Sure, it wont be lore-friendly anymore, but who cares?\r\n\r\nAs always, enjoy.\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\nInstallation: take the \\\"draugr\\\" folders in the zip and put them in the respective \\\"armor\\\" folder.\r\n\r\nskyrim > data > textures/meshes > armor > [draugr folders goes here]",
