  "summary": "Adds a new world Vanaheimr to the game inspired by on Tamriel and Nordic lore gathered mostly off of Wikipedia. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Since Talos had ascended to godhood all of the portals between Tamriel and Vanaheimr have been lost. However since the birth of the dragonborn a gateway has been opened that may lead to the mythical world itself. It is said that the faithful pilgrims of Talos who follow his footsteps will be admitted into the world in which only the dragonborn can gain mastery.\r\n\r\naccording to Norse mythology there are nine worlds all linked together through an immense tree. Vanaheimr is home to the less famous gods and goddesses. \r\n\r\nThis is my first published mod and it is still in its infancy. Suggestions and comments are appreciated. \r\n\r\nMost recent version features\r\nDetailed worldspace with LOD\r\nunique climate and sea\r\nNPCs and Merchants\r\nUnique Merchant that will sell dragon soul gems\r\nmany interiors are still unfinished\r\n\r\nPlans for the future,\r\nfinish interiors and add others\r\nadd other worldspaces reflecting norse mythology\r\nimprove optimization for worldspace\r\nadd more unique NPCs and followers\r\nadd new shouts to wordwalls\r\npossibly add dragons if I can get around the buggy AI\r\nadd questline that ties everything together",
