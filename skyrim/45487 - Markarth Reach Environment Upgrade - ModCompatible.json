  "descriptionHtml": "Markarth Reach Environment Upgrade - ModCompatible \r<br />\r<br />Modifies the harsh landscape surrounding the Markarth Area known as the reach with much more details and gives a feeling of wilderness. Adds more Trees, Bushes, Grass, Mushrooms, Waterfalls, Light Sources and fills the empty screen with hundreds of new objects. Provides some stunning views. \r<br />\r<br />This is a WIP Mod. Modifies Markarth down the Valley until Karthwasten. Karthspire Camp and the Lost Valley as well. \r<br />\r<br />My Recommandation is to use the following mods, but it is not mandatory; these mods add new Textures, which look so much better than the Original ones:\r<br />\r<br />All Screenshots (before/after) contain the following mods; credits to the Creator of these Mods:\r<br />- HiRes DLC for Textures by Bethesda\r<br />- Skyrim Flora Overhaul Regular Edition v186 by Vurt\r<br />- LOD regular Edition by Vurt\r<br />- Hi-res Pines for all versions by Vurt\r<br />- GKB Green Trees Ga-Knomboe Boy (contained within the Mod from Vurt); not to be installed seperately\r<br />- Reach Grass Alternative version by Vurt; install these Textures at your own choice, as it changes especially the grass for the Reach Area; but they look way better than the ones from Bethesda as seen in the screenshots; default grass does not show a real difference and is boring&#33;&#33;\r<br />- W.A.T.E.R - Water and Terrain Enhancements Redux by OpticShooter\r<br />- Birds of Skyrim by Qasiemo\r<br />- FXAA Tool with Tonemapping to modify Saturation, Gamma, Exposure, Bleach Bypass and Defog Power Values; one can of course use an alternative (ENB), at your own choice.\r<br />-For better view change the field of view angle: FOV 80-90 gives a great feeling, and does not make seasick as well (at least my opinion)...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-V3.9 mod is not compatible with Hroldan Nightgate and Sawmill Villages Mod that modify the same areas and objects. This file will not be updated in the future any longer. But it is still available for download.\r<br />\r<br />-V4.1 is compatible with the following mods:\r<br />-Hroldan Nightgate\r<br />-Sawmill Villages\r<br />-Nyrikki\r<br />-Better City Entrances\r<br />\r<br />V4.2  is compatible with the following mods:\r<br />-Immersive Settlements: Karthwasten. For compatibility use MarkarthReachExpEnv-SkyrimBridgeCompatible)&#33;&#33;\r<br />-Skyrim Bridges (note: use the right file for compatibility: MarkarthReachExpEnv-SkyrimBridgeCompatible)&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Note:\r<br />Only the File MarkarthReachExpEnv-SkyrimBridgeCompatible.rar is compatible with the Mod Skyrim Bridges, as it (re)-moves some colliding objects. So if you are using the Mod Skyrim Bridges then download this File. For all others, download the original File, as it contains more Objects, which otherwise would be missing.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I removed pillars and other objects which had collisions. This file will be updated in the future. \r<br />\r<br />Reach Area has been further modified and improved. A sort of petrified forest with Rock Pillars has been added to the upper Karth River. The James Bond Rock in the Khao Phing Kan National Park in Thailand was my archetype. Bethesda has done a great Job by modeling this object. Looks Cool&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Have Fun&#33;&#33;\r<br />",
