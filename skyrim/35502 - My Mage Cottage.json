  "summary": "Small cottage, with a magical atmosphere, safe containers, follower friendly, all crafting tables and devices available for different character types",
  "descriptionHtml": "I wanted a home that has a romantic ambience and would also fit my personality as a mage. Sure, I\\'m the Arch mage of the college, but I really don\\'t want to live there. If you are looking for a beautiful, but simple home, this may be the mod for you! I was looking for a step up from a shack, but definitely not a palace.\r\n\r\nRequirements: \r\n-Skyrim (No DLC\\'s)\r\n-Game updated to 1.9+\r\n\r\nSuggested mods (to have it look like the pictures - I really love these mods!):\r\n-Immersive Saturation Boost \r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=128490856&searchtext=immersive+saturation+boost\r\n\r\n-Improved Interior Lighting (For Realistic Lighting Mods)\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=13434&searchtext=improved+interior+lighting\r\n\r\nLocation: Across the River from the Solitude Lumber Mill (the night picture is of me looking right at it, you can see it right from the front door!)\r\n\r\nWhat you Will find:\r\nSafe Storage\r\nAlchemy Table\r\nEnchanter Table\r\nSmelter\r\nChopping block\r\nForge (outside)\r\nCooking Spit\r\nNavmeshed for NPC\\'s (follower friendly)\r\nIn my opinion, a great atmosphere for a player that is great for someone wants ambience, beauty, small consolidated home, and space to add your own expansions to this mod; have fun!\r\n\r\nWhat you will NOT find:\r\nA nifty quest to get the key (sorry, this is my first mod ever-maybe later?)\r\nOver-powered items \r\nTons of displays and Mannequins\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\nThis is my first shot at Navmesh, so it is friendly but not perfect. If anyone has ideas about changing that, let me know! I used great tutorials to figure it out, but I know other people are better than I am at that! http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/topic/4656-ck-basics-lesson-1/\r\nAlso, I do not know if this works with all/any ENB\\'s, as I do not use one myself.\r\n",
