With this patch you can run both mods without any conflicts. Nightgate Inn can now be entered with both mods active. Let me know if there are still problems.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/9OjP4rl.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]bHTqsGRs04E[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]It was a late, cold night that I had rode up to Nightgate Inn..Hungry and tired. I was needing a warm place to rest my head, but there was a terrible blizzard outside that my horse would be forced to stand in&#33; This is where the idea came from. \r<br />\r<br />This is just a small mod that adds different stables behind the inns of all the smaller cities (Sleeping Giant Inn, Braidwood Inn, Deadman&#39;s Drink, Four Shield&#39;s Tavern, Moorside Inn, Windpeak Inn, Vilemyr Inn, Frostfruit Inn, and the Frozen Hearth) and to the two random inns on the map as well (Nightgate Inn and Old Hroldan Inn).\r<br />\r<br />This mod is perfect for players that use Frostfall or a realistic needs mod or for people who just enjoy roleplaying in the game&#33; Immersive Stables adds realistic and unique stables behind inns just as there would be in medieval times. For realism, Skyrim definitely lacked certain things. And to me, leaving your horse outside in the rain, cold, snow, or whatever just wasn&#39;t very... realistic. The civilians of Skyrim talk about the cold and losing loved ones to the icy bite it leaves behind, so wouldn&#39;t that also include animals?\r<br />\r<br />As of right now, the stables are all free to use. Many medieval inns didn&#39;t charge for stable use, just the rooms and food. The stables are all located on the backside of the inns and most have plenty of room. The colder the climate, the warmer the stables look. So if you&#39;re needing a place to sleep for the night and you&#39;re near an inn, don&#39;t forget to put your horse safely in the stables out back&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]What this Mod Does[/size]\r<br />[color=royalblue]\r<br />--&gt; New building structures that all have unique designs.\r<br />--&gt; Plenty of hay for comfort and warmth.\r<br />--&gt; Immersive clutter - Pitchforks, buckets, troughs, hay, lanterns, shovels, ect.\r<br />--&gt; Neat and small, to prevent taking up too much space and minimize conflicts with other mods while doing it&#39;s job.\r<br />--&gt; Some hay beds in the stables with enough room.\r<br />--&gt; No performance loss. :)\r<br />--&gt; Cleaned with TES5 Edit.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />How to Install/Uninstall\r<br />1) Use NMM or another mod manager\r<br />2) Install Manually by dragging and dropping the file into your Skyrim Data folder\r<br />3) To Uninstall - Delete the esp file &#34;Immersive Stables - Vanilla Edition&#34; from the Data folder or uninstall using mod manager\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]My Other Mods:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52794/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/UDBMqrI.jpg?1[/img]\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58991/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/4Kc98Lq.png[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65577/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/gfMf4fG.png[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71701/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/uWko0aw.png[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79172/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/5p2llPf.png[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60965/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/jsmk8zg.png[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80582/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/HG6mmRF.png[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74543/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/v3xIBWp.png[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71665/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/EPDf4ST.png[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59071/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/cTYyako.png[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52391/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/cBokF2y.png[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Changelog:[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Version 1.2 Update[/b]\r<br />Fixed those pesky floating carrots\r<br />Moved the stable bed in Rorikstead to the other side. Hopefully no more grass from other mods will be sticking through.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Version 1.1 Update[/b]\r<br />\r<br />New version up&#33; Fixed minor bugs, cleaned with TES5Edit, and added more immersion to the stables. The stables now also have lanterns in safe places, more shovels, pitchforks, and buckets that cannot be picked up or knocked over. If you have any more bugs to report, please let me know&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Thank you for downloading my mod and I hope you like it. :)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Known issues:[/b]\r<br />Snow coming through the walls of certain shelters\r<br />Mods that add flora may cause the stables to be blocked or collide with them. To fix this, simply open the command box (with the tilde key) and disable any trees or plants that may be in the way. SFO has some grass/bushes that grow inside the stables that cannot be disabled.\r<br />No Snow Under The Roof causes a pile of snow to appear inside the Nightgate Inn Stable. Can be disabled. (apparently the pile of snow covers the door to the basement as well).\r<br />Incompatibility with mods that make changes to similar areas.",
