  "summary": "This enb is settled in Visuals and Graphics because its based on my previous enbs. \r<br />It is dark and atmospheric. I used a style which had good feedback and boosted it up with newer and more subtle effects. On top of this, it has great performance even on mid-spec systems ",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][i]The guy who brought you\r<br />Heartless Kinetao ENB\r<br />bitterSWEET ENB\r<br />and\r<br />Aliaris ENB[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][i][b]Revink ENB[/b][/i][/size][/center]\r<br />Most enb presets are colorful and bright. They try to give a natural feeling. Some focus on photorealistic visuals, dark shadows, bright lights. And a few presets impress with unique bloom shaders, complex depth of field etc. .\r<br />\r<br />But this does not try to line up with those. It is dark, greyish and unwelcoming like Skyrim itself.\r<br />\r<br />This dark enb preset is based on the heartless kinetao and utilises redone shaders. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />okay, this enb uses the 132 binaries from enbdev.com\r<br />[url=http://enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0132.htm]here you go[/url]\r<br />\r<br />open up the wrapper version and drop the d3d9.dll file into your skyrim main folder. \r<br />My preset goes there as well. Copypaste the content of the &#34;Revink ENB&#34; folder.\r<br />\r<br />And that´s it",
