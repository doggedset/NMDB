  "descriptionHtml": "[Game]\r\nSkyrim\r\n[Mod Name]\r\nGold Worth Something\r\n[Author(s)]\r\njaked11\r\n[Contact Info]\r\nj.dodd@gmx.us\r\n[Version]\r\n1.2\r\n[Change Log]\r\n1.0 - First uploaded version\r\n1.1 - Ingot splitting now integrated to work with ALL mods that add crafting. Added banknotes to human loot.\r\n1.2 - Creates a workaround if you are experiencing crashes exiting the vault.\r\n1.3 - Now correctly displays \\\"Denarii\\\" in vendor and inventory instead of saying \\\"Gold\\\".\r\n\r\nFuture Plans: \r\n\r\nChanging the weight and values of all armor and weapons (already done a few such as elven armor and silver weapons)\r\n\r\nFixing the weight of the coins to more realistic values\r\n\r\nsmall bug fixing (ie things like no quest marker)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Description]\r\nFEATURES:\r\nA new quest (although rather short)\r\nA different view on ingots and metal\\'s values and weights\r\nA brand new currency and three new coin types\r\nA few new items\r\nAn imperial forge similar to the skyforge (new crafting possibilities for imperial items and stronger items for imperial faction)\r\n\r\nThis mod is a general overhaul of Skyrim\\'s currency and crafting system. The new currency you will spend and use on items is no longer acutal gold; in the crisis of the war with the Aldmeri Dominion the empire has used so much gold to fuel the war they have transferred to a paper money system. You now pay with imperial bank notes. You will still find coins in the world (copper, silver, and gold coins) but they can no longer be traded with directly. Instead they must be sold for banknotes depending on your Speech skill, like any other item. Copper has the least value at 3 banknotes, silver with 15, and gold with 30. They are not tradable at every merchant, for instance an alchemist. What would an alchemist need with precious metals? Instead they can be sold at anyone who sells metals like blacksmiths and any trader who buys miscellaneous items. There is also a new \\\"Precious Metals\\\" merchant visiting Whiterun at Dragonsreach, the Jarl\\'s castle. He buys only coins, suspiciously. I don\\'t want to give away spoilers about the new quest so all I will say is this is where you start. The quest also provides an alternate means of transfer from coin to note.\r\n\r\nThis mod also alters values and weights of all ingots. I began this mod altering only gold (hence the name), but expanded it to all metals. They are much more heavier to add some realism and values are changed. I based my changes on rarity and real life models of prices and weights of the real metals related to each other. On metals that are purely fantasy within skyrim, I chose the nearest metal possible in real life. I figured the weights on the size of an average ingot, and the weight per gcm3. My reference page if you would like to see: (http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/125Adensitygold.html) The weights given in the mod are exactly HALF of my actual results. Now, when crafting, ingots must first be melted down into MOLTEN metal. One ingot yields THREE (3) portions of molten metal. You then can craft your armor and weapons at a forge without using an entire ingot, for example a dagger will cost much less of an ingot (one portion) than a whole sword would (maybe 2 to 3 portions).\r\n\r\nORE is also reweighted and revalued. The ore is slightly heaver than the melted version will be. I figured the rock and heaviness of an unrefined metal and the impurities of such should make it heavier.\r\n\r\nThis mod also adds an IMPERIAL FORGE to the game in Solitude, the imperial capital. Its function is similar to the skyforge of the companions. You now can no longer forge imperial items just anywhere; they now must be done at the imperial forge with IMPERIAL STEEL, a special mix of molten metals and steel, creatable at any forge if you are in the imperial faction (side with the Legion in the Civil War). This also adds forgable Penitus Ocalatus armor for higher level imperial players needing better imperial armor, and adds a new weapon, the Reinforced Imperial Sword, a retextured imperial sword infused with ebony. I also added an imperial gold mine south of Markarth, possibly for new civil war quests later. But for now it is an imperial gold mine that works prisoners to mine the gold.\r\n\r\nThis is my first major mod that I have uploaded to the nexus so please be kind with your criticism. I respect constructive comments and suggestions but I will not toleratre \\\"hurr durr your mod sucks\\\". I mod for myself and this is why this is my first uploaded mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Required Files]\r\nThe latest version of Skyrim.\r\n[Installation]\r\nInstall the easiest way using the Nexus Mod Manager (recommended), or install manually by extracting the files into Skyrim\\\\Data.\r\n[Uninstallation]\r\nSimply uncheck the esp file and delete any textures involved with my mod (all in textures\\\\jaked11)\r\n[Known Issues]\r\nNothing major at the moment. Please report any bugs you encounter here on the nexus.\r\n[Incompatabilities]\r\nMost likely any mods that alter the loot leveled lists that involve gold. I recommend using Wrye Bash\\'s (Wyre SMASH for Skyrim) patching tool to get around this is you run into any incompatibilities.\r\n\r\n[Troubleshooting/FAQ]\r\nIf you have any questions please feel free to email me at j.dodd@gmx.us or comment here on the file.\r\n\r\n[Tools Used]\r\nSkyrim Creation Kit\r\nSkyrim Readme Generator V6 by DarkSaber9000 (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17182)\r\n\r\n[Permissions]\r\nYou can use this mod for any purpose (add ons, better textures, etc), just please do not reupload without my permission, and shoot me a link of your related mod so I can see it.",
