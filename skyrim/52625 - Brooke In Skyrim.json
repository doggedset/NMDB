  "descriptionHtml": "Brooke started life in Fallout 3 and now she finds Skyrim. But does she know how she got here?\r<br />\r<br />Brooke is a follower who can hire normally but she also has a back story which I hope to develop further. The back story chat options will appear after hiring her. (If they don&#39;t then it&#39;s the dialogue bug from the creation kit. Save, quit to menu and load the game again and it will fix it and the dialogue will be there) You should see &#34;What&#39;s your story then?&#34; in your options.\r<br />\r<br />You can find her at the inn in Rorikstead\r<br />\r<br />Version 4.5\r<br />\r<br />Hair and face issue fixed\r<br />\r<br />Version 5\r<br />\r<br />Taken the disarm spell off her as I found it caused problems with other companions. In a game I was playing she accidentally disarmed Lydia which Lydia didn&#39;t take kindly to and the pair launched into a vicious fight which ended in Lydia&#39;s death&#33; I have replaced the disarm shout with some harmless a healing spell and some restoration perks. She shouldn&#39;t be able to do any damage with those. \r<br />\r<br />Brooke is marriable and the next update should also increase the dialogue options for and add more to her back story\r<br />\r<br />Version 6 \r<br />\r<br />Further changes to her looks due to the grey face issue hitting me, to fix it I had to change the name of the plug in file. \r<br />\r<br />Added a bit more dialogue to her back story\r<br />\r<br />6.5\r<br />\r<br />The disarm shout had somehow crept back in which gets annoying as she keeps disarming the player and in one example she disarmed Lydia which resulted in a fight and the death of Lydia&#33; Added healing spells and restoration perks as a substitute. \r<br />\r<br />I have tested Brooke with the Amazing Follower Tweaks mod and she works fine",
