  "descriptionHtml": "Expands on the Orc brow horns, including adding in some chin morphs, and giving the females horn selections as well. All under brow in the character creation menu, just as they are with the vanilla male Orc.\r<br />\r<br />There was some concept art for Skyrim that had Orcs with horns on their chins, and I liked the concept of it. I also felt that the females not having horns, but the males having them was slightly odd. Why can&#39;t the female Orcs look more brutish too?\r<br />\r<br />7 female brow horns -Â 2 extra male.\r<br />3 female chin horns and 3 male (with chipped and unchipped versions for the male)\r<br />\r<br />I may add more horn styles in the future.",
