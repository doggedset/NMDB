But feel free to do so yourself and upload it to the nexus with a link back to the original. \r<br />\r<br />[size=xx-large]___[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Either through NMM or manually, unpack the archive into your skyrim directory, activate the plugin in the launcher. \r<br />You&#39;ll find them all in a dwarven jewelry box in either the Arch-Mage&#39;s Quarters in the College of Winterhold, or in QASmoke on a table. About the same place as the containers for my piercing mod were. But they are fully compatible and won’t be replacing each other, so don’t worry about that if you have both of them installed.\r<br />All of the files take up body slot 44 and won&#39;t be replacing any vanilla helmets or circlets or other headwear your character has equipped, it may possibly replace items from other mods though.\r<br />\r<br />[size=xx-large]___[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility issues[/b]\r<br />\r<br />To avoid this conflicting with other mods I had installed that add cloaks and amulets and scarves and etc etc, I didn&#39;t want it to take up more than one body slot. Meaning you can&#39;t have a crown equipped along with my piercings since they both take up slot 44 or any other mod that adds items to body slot 44. With a bit of nifskope you can make it happen though.\r<br />You&#39;ll find instructions [url=http://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/Customising_an_outfit_in_Nifskope_for_beginners]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Also note that these are 100% dependent on what flora textures you use. They will work perfectly with vanilla though.\r<br />\r<br />[size=xx-large]___[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Special Thanks[/b]\r<br />\r<br />- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/4369338]DaMiriam[/url] for her beta-testing and image contributions.
