  "descriptionHtml": "Kelli - A level 1 Breton fresh out of the cave.\r\n\r\nThis character took me a several weeks to make... only because I was trying my hardest to find a way to get the red color of hair that I wanted.  I was so happy when I finally found a way (non mod) that I had to share it.\r\n\r\nSeveral mods in effect here (listed below)... I recommend you download and install them, however, I think the hair color will transfer no matter what mods you have installed.  I have included save files with two shades... I realize the screenshot of the darker red looks brownish, but it is redder in the game.  I thought it might be my game settings so I included the bright red version too.\r\n\r\nThis is the method for getting the red hair and a few other saturated colors:\r\nhttp://www.gameskyrim.com/true-red-hair-t163651.html  <scroll down the forum til you find the instructions, kudos to forum user Rhysa Hughes for that lovely workaround using PC console commands)\r\n\r\nMods:\r\nNo More Blocky Faces by Xenius\r\nBetter_Females by Bella\r\nCovereyes by MrLenski\r\nCoolsim Hair Pack by newermind43\r\nCoolsims Hair Retexture (wild version) by Bloodysunday  (3 versions, all nice)\r\nTriss Armor Retextured (Dark Brown version) by Psyche23 (based off original mod by Fraper)\r\n",
