He later Settled down near Falkreath, where he found his true love Sehren, a gorgeous Breton woman. Sehren bore two children, Chelsea (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28188/), and Katherine.\r\n   \r\n     Thanus\\'s old buddy from the war, Andreif, the father of Alvhilde (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25249/), Hadn\\'t heard from Katherine\\'s family in a while...  Thats because in 4E 180, a 750,000-gold bounty was put on Thanus\\'s head for being a deserter. As a consequence Katherine\\'s house was raided by bandits looking to make some cash, ultimately leading to the demise of her parents. \r\n\r\n       The two young girls survived and were divided amongst the rabble in Skyrim. It is now 4E 201, and Katherine resides in Whiterun, at The Bannered Mare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8498/8299587304_f74911a34f_z.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n  This Mod is Standalone, Nothing should be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8363/8298536883_085eaf6f59_z.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n     [u]WARNING This mod Contains Nudity[/u]\r\n   If anybody feels objective, please PM me.\r\n    I will then remove the part that shouldn\\'t be here, or give you proper credits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8077/8298537081_1fd0b30e1a_z.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nDimon99 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/537675 For Body Model\r\n\r\nNavetsea http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/496662 For Body Texture\r\n\r\nLogRaam http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/308756 For Eye\\'s\r\n\r\nRAN64 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1713099 For Hair\r\n",
