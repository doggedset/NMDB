  "descriptionHtml": "It\\'s a small house... maybe more just a shack in the trees in the volcanic tundra. And when I say small I mean really tiny. It contains:\r\n- 1 bedroll (single)\r\n- 2 sacks\r\n- 1 backpack\r\n- 1 chest\r\n- 1 cooking pot\r\n- 1 hunting bow\r\n\r\nOn the roof is a small terrace with a chest 2 chairs a table and a few bottles of mead.\r\nDon\\'t blame me for \\\"agh it\\'s so tiny maaan\\\"\r\nIt is supposed to be small. It\\'s not a giant manor or castle (those will follow soon) It\\'s a hunter\\'s shack and a hunter doesn\\'t need much.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the shack on the trees is at the bottom of the tree that holds the shack. If you don\\'t find it wait till night. There\\'s a candle next to the trapdoor.\r\n\r\nSorry for not using map markers. I just don\\'t know how to place and edit one.\r\n\r\nQuestions or problems? Message me.",
