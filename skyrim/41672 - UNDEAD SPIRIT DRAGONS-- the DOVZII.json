  "descriptionHtml": "The DovZii: A good fifteen minute battle ensues when these Undead Spirit Dragons fly overhead. They use every dragon shout in the book on you. They try their utmost to bring you down. They are relentless. They and the Dragon Priests who have summoned them are found in lonely desolate places such as abandoned forts or old Nordic tomb sites. \r\n\r\nThey have been summoned by a newly resurrected Dragon Priest cult to Skyrim as unwilling and furious pawns. This insulting situation has them rather peeved, so everyone in their path suffers their retribution. \r\n\r\nThe Dragon Priests are none too friendly either. \r\n\r\nWill they kill you if you are lower level? Yes, repeatedly. \r\n\r\nWill they interfere with your frivolous quests? Yes, as much as they can. Turn off the mod if they are too much for you at some particular quest line. \r\n\r\nDo they die? Well, they put up a fight, and they regenerate health points in battle; they might skulk away halfway through the battle to regenerate and come back for more if you don\\'t finish them off properly once you engage in the fray. Then they die and give you treasure and dragon souls. And don\\'t forget admiration and glory, the locals always go all...misty eyed when you do that. A week later, they are likely to respawn in the same spot. \r\n",
