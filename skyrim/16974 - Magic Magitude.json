  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=limegreen][i]Remember to Endorse if you like this mod[/i][/color][/b]\r\n\r\nA mod originally created for personal use. I\\'m releasing this file to the public as small way to give back to the community. I will consider suggestions and requests, so please comment.\r\n(Yes, \\\"Magitude\\\" is the intentional spelling of the mod name.)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[b]=Description=[/b]\r\nThe aim of this mod is to make magic much more powerful and useful in Skyrim. I\\'m sure some will see this as \\\"overpowered\\\", but the reason playing a pure mage in Skyrim is so difficult is because magic is weak in general compared to other available options.\r\nThis mod only covers the destruction school so far...\r\n\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Destruction:[/color][/i] Destruction magic was seriously lacking damage. A one handed sword deals more damage with a normal swing than expert level destruction spells after awhile, and swinging that sword in such a way can be done repeatedly but doesn\\'t cost the player anything. Destruction damage has been increased, but spell cost is only reduced by 25% to provide some since of balance.\r\n\r\nDefault: Cast (Novice thru Master) level Destruction spells for half magicka.\r\nMM: (Novice thru Master) spells are more 50% more powerful and 25% easier to cast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Destruction Mastery:[/color][/i] This new perk offers players a rather large boost to destruction magic along side other destruction perks, as well as a small boost to magic potency across all magic schools. The idea is that as the mage grows accustom to using Destruction magic, the mage\\'s magicka becomes more powerful in general, which increases the power of other spells. \r\n\r\n::Gradual Version:: Spells from all magic schools are (5/15/30/50/75)% stronger while destruction magic is (10/30/60/100/150)% stronger.\r\n::Standard Version:: Spells from all magic schools are (15/30/45/60/75)% stronger while destruction magic is (30/60/90/120/150)% stronger.\r\n::Requires 20/40/60/80/100 Destruction skill::\r\n\r\nNote: Advancing in Destruction Mastery requires you to learn every destruction class spell for that rank first. Mastery 1/5 learn all novice spells, Mastery 2/5 learn all apprentice spells, etc...\r\n(Limitations wouldn\\'t allow me to add all this to the perk description)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Destruction Dual Casting(3/3):[/color][/i] This adds another level to the original Dual casting perk that gives the ability to dual cast. This perk will improve the efficiency of dual casting Destruction spells.\r\n(2/3)Dual casting cost is reduced by 25% for Destruction spells. ::Requires 30 Destruction::\r\n(3/3)Dual casting damage is increased by 25% for Destruction spells. ::Requires 50 Destruction::\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Battle Mage:[/color][/i] Increases magicka regeneration in combat by 50/100%. A true battle mage knows how to regenerate magicka quickly in high stress situations.  ::Requires 60/80 Destruction::\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Rune Master(2/2):[/color][/i] Adds another level to the Rune Master perk. The player will be able to place as many runes as their magicka allows. Place multiple runes in one spot to pile on damage, place runes throughout your dungeon escape routes to weaken and kill enemies in pursuit, place runes in strategic areas before entering a boss fight, or even use runes as breadcrumbs to find your way back home, you decide. ::Requires 80 Destruction::\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Intense Flames:[/color][/i] Fire spells burn the target for 10 seconds, damage per second is equal to 10% of that spell\\'s base damage. This effect stacks if another fire spell is cast. Casting multiple fire spells is a great way exploit this new perk effect for tons of extra damage. The stronger the fire spell, the higher damage is dealt over 10 seconds. Enemies will still flee when health is low, but the fire damage effect will likely kill them while they flee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Deep Freeze:[/color][/i] Frost spells now have a 25% chance to freeze the target. The amount of time the target will remain frozen depends on the frost spell used. When using the Frostbite spell, this chance is reduced to 5%. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Voltage(Disintegrate):[/color][/i] Shock spells have a 50% chance to either stagger or knock the target over depending on the spell cast. Enemies will still be disintegrated when health is low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Aura:[/color][/i] This new perk aims to make Destruction Cloak spells more useful. At rank 1, Fire, Frost, or Shock spell cost is reduced by 50%. At rank 2, Fire, Frost, or Shock spell damage is increased by 50%. If you were to cast Flame cloak with both ranks of this perk, all fire spells would cost half as much magicka and deal 50% more damage. This also applies to master spells.... ::For rank 1, you\\'ll need Intense Flames, Deep Freeze, Voltage, and a destruction skill of 75. For rank 2, you\\'ll need a destruction skill of 95::\r\n\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Alteration:[/color][/i] Though the alteration tree was okay for the most part, I decided to add a few things to the perk tree to encourage pure mage gameplay. In the default game, the player was forced to wear armor with their mage character or suffer a swift death during a surprise attack by the enemy. Here are a few things to help keep your mage characters alive and less frustrating to play.\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Alteration Mastery:[/color][/i] Alteration spells last 20/40/60/80/100% longer. Magicka is increased by 20/40/60/80/100 while not wearing armor.\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Reinforcement:[/color][/i]: Maximum health is increased by 25/50/100 when flesh spells are active.\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Survival Flesh:[/color][/i]: While not wearing a cuirass or helmet, armor rating is increased by 30/40/50 in combat.\r\n\r\n[i][color=limegreen]Mage Armor:[/color][/i] Armor rating is 25/50/75 and protection spells like stoneflesh are twice/2.5/three times as strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]=Installation=[/b]\r\nInstall with NMM or drop ESP file into Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\n[b]=Known Issues=[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]=Compatibility=[/b]\r\nThis mod isn\\'t compatible with mods that alter the destruction and/or alteration perk tree.\r\nIf you\\'re using a mod that alters other perks, loading this mod after said mod will only overwrite changes to the Destruction and/or Alteration tree.
