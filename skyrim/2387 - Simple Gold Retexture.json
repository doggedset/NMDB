  "descriptionHtml": "NOTICE: For some reason nexus will not allow me to comment or use the messenger system. However, It has come to my attention that the textures are not showing up in game for some people please provide feedback on whether this a rare case or is a common issue.( Remember to check, load loose data files) When I am at my home computer I will provide an update that attempts to remedy this, reduces the file size and makes the mod compatible with the nexus mod manager. Thank you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a simple mod I made to improve the standard gold coin texture. The vanilla version had some ugly pixelation. A simple fix for those who know how to retexture items but alas most do not know how. Provides an improved normal map and 4x resolution image of the gold coin.\r\n\r\nInstall Info\r\n\r\nUnpack the folder to the data/textures/clutter folder ( you most likely will have to create this on your own). \r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n\r\nDelete the files from the folder in which you placed them ",
