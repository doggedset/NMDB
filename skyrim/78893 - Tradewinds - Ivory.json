  "descriptionHtml": "Adds Ivory luxury Items that can be crafted from Mammoth and Horker Tusks for your merchant or hunter character. I am working on adding workshops to Whiterun and Dawnstar where Ivory items will be bought and sold, but for now I wanted to offer the lite version for those who want a more resource driven economy and industry experience in Skyrim, or who want a better reward for hunting mammoths.\r<br />\r<br />Crafting:\r<br />Polished Ivory - 1 Mammoth tusk or Horker Tusk\r<br />Ornamental Ivory Claw - 2 polished Ivory\r<br />Rough Ivory Flute - 1 Ivory\r<br />Ivory Horn - 1 polished Ivory and 1 steel ingot\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />It occurred to me while playing EU IV that Skyrim has a TON of ivory, and that precious resource is barely exploited in game, now your profiteering poacher or hunter can polish those tusks into the luxurious decor that dazzled the colonial world.\r<br />\r<br />",
