  "descriptionHtml": "So, don\\'t expect greatness. If you\\'re looking for brilliant art, I urge you to look at my other mods and not this one. For most of this stuff, it\\'s pretty standard enlarge and toss some filters on it until it looks halfway decent. I think it\\'s usually an improvement, especially on the heavy falmer stuff, but it\\'s not the official source art, so take it with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, in a few cases (the Moth Priest robe, the vampire commoner clothes, and SPOILER the dwemer aetherium stuff) I was able to source from the official high-res pack. These are LEGIT \\\"high-res\\\" and goddamn I spent a while on all the little flower knobs on the SPOILER dwemer crystal shield.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you like it. If you enjoy some other texture replacers that seem to be popular, MY FILTERS ARE EVEN BETTER. BOOYAH.",
