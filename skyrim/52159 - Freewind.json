Otherwise some npcs wont update package, clutter flies about and other issues.\r<br />\r<br />0.21:\r<br />Brüno is very sensitive and got offended by my mean words. We patched things up though and he will once more grace us with his golden voice.\r<br />\r<br />0.2:\r<br />Reworked AI. Reworked npc templates. Fixed many navmesh bugs. Little decoration changes. Had stern conversation with Brüno about hospitality. Added bed, see if you can find it.\r<br />\r<br />0.1:\r<br />I don&#39;t know what happened. There are merchants, all kinds of crafting stuff and a few bandits. Maybe in the next version, I add bed.",
