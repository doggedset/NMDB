  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/37302-2-1372159192.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/l1nnzL0.jpg[/img]\r<br />Succubi, those sexy demonical entities. \r<br />Who could think that they would be part of our life ? Facts have given us the proof that they may exist in our world.\r<br />\r<br />A shopkeeper named Nikitaa was the only one able to tell us about them.\r<br />This is what she said :\r<br />&#34;Known in the past as a Daedra Seducer, Dark Seducer, or Mazken. Their appearance corresponds to their name: beautiful young women, naked or nearly so. Some have wings on their back, and they can materialize at will. They describe themselves as being &#34;Daedra without&#34; a Lord, so they can switch allegiances at will. The Mazkens act in service to a lot of the Daedric Princes, including Azura, Mehrunes Dagon, Meridia, Nocturne, Sanghin, and Sheogorath, by serving as private soldier, messenger, or even more generally as guards or even mistresses.\r<br />\r<br />During the Battlespire Assault, Imago Storm judged them impulsive and undisciplined, and was opposed to their integration of the Mazkens into the ranks of the Legions of Mehrunes Dagon, including the promotion of Faydra Shardai at the rank of General of Dagon.\r<br />\r<br />Although &#34;Modern&#34; Maskens were being seen during the events of Oblivion, 200 years ago, these &#34;succubus&#34; are part of the native race of Faydra Shardai recognizable by their wings. But nobody knows how they arrived in Skyrim...&#34;\r<br />\r<br />This story is about Lucretia, one among them, a reddish skinned one.\r<br />Some say that she had been a true support of the Hero of Kvatch in Cyrodiil, but well it must have been another Ma&#39;iq&#39;s lie.  How could it be possible ? Well, daedric powers seems to be so powerful, so who knows ?\r<br />\r<br />What is sure about her, is that she will be a part of your story, and you&#39;ll have to encouter her in the Hall of Dead. \r<br />\r<br />[center][size=4]Embrace your destiny as a dovhakiin and let her go with you to live your epic adventures &#33;[/size][/center]\r<br /> \r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/vKedykG.jpg[/img]\r<br />[size=5][color=#bb5f69]Features[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Loving sexy characters ? Even if it is&#39;nt lore-friendly ? Well, this follower is for you &#33;&#33; Lady Lucretia is a follower using weapons to fight.\r<br />\r<br />[left]Her fighting style is close to a spellsword character, BUT she can also uses dual wield style or 2handed weapons. She has got some perks helping when using those weapons \r<br />Behind her charming look, she is able to defend using Flames, or Succubus Drain. But she is a dangerous fighter. And because she was the favourite of Sanghin, she has recieved her weapon\r<br />(equivalent to an imperial sword)\r<br />[/left]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120311052422/elderscrolls/images/thumb/1/10/MAGINVFireballArt.png/100px-MAGINVFireballArt.png[/img][img]http://i.imgur.com/JJoBK3y.png[/img][img]http://i.imgur.com/x4cPTC5.png[/img][img]http://i.imgur.com/JApptlI.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Lucretia, like other succubi prefers wearing some sexy clothes, so, her default outfit includes the armor of seductress from Nikitaa. You can marry Lucretia, but don&#39;t forget that she is a succubus and she loves lust &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />http://imgur.com/gBWM4hC\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#bb5f69]Location[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[img=right]http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/837/7l35.jpg/[/img]\r<br />This mod is my first one.
