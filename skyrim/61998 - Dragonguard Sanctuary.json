  "descriptionHtml": "[u]What is this?\r<br />\r<br />[/u]A small player-owned home in Solitude. Currently decorated in a fairly generic way, as it wasn&#39;t made for any particular style of character. I made this to match my ideas for a home, which means a home that is secluded, small/cosy, with plenty of storage and functionality. Features:\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]Combined living/bedroom[/*]\r<br />[*]Combined forge/armory[/*]\r<br />[*]Study/library room[/*]\r<br />[*]Alchemy/enchanting room[/*]\r<br />[*]And a shrine to the daughter of twilight... Always one of my preferred daedra.[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />A reasonable amount of storage can be found in the living room. Various other containers and weapon/armor racks can be found throughout the home. All containers should be non-respawning.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Where is it?\r<br />\r<br />[/u]Solitude. Can be accessed by finding your way up and behind Angeline&#39;s Aromatics. Starts unlocked, although you will have to find a few keys to access each room inside.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Still to do:[/u]\r<br />\r<br />For all intents and purposes the home functions properly. A few things I still want to do are:\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]Tidy up positioning of objects in each room.[/*]\r<br />[*]A bit more clutter/decoration.[/*]\r<br />[*]Fix the bookshelves in the study (for some reason only the top shelf on each works, and at a reduced capacity).[/*]\r<br />[/list]",
