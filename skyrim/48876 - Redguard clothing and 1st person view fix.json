  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple mod that fixes a few issues with the Redguard clothing set. The fixes include the following:\r<br />\r<br />-First person view fixed for both Redguard outfits (male and female)\r<br />-Added Nazir&#39;s Redguard outfit to Radiant Raiment in Solitude \r<br />-Added Gilded Wristguards as well to Radiant Raiment since this is probably the only bracers that work with this outfit with the least amount of clipping.\r<br />-Made Gilded Wristguards clothing since they where mostly bugged anyways as far as category and stats went. \r<br />\r<br />I mainly made this mod for myself, but I wanted to share this since there is no fix for the Redguard outfit 1st person view. This mod should serve anybody well who wants to play an alteration warrior with some of the baddest clothes in Tamerial&#33;   \r<br />",
