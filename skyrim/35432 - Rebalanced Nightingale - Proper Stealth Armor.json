  "modName": "Rebalanced Nightingale - Proper Stealth Armor",
  "summary": "Replaces Nightingale Armor with something I found far more appropriate for a stealth agent of Nocturnal.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I know there are about 15 other Nightingale armor tweaks out there, but none of them quite had things the way I liked. This mod replaces the multiple \\\"leveled\\\" armor sets with a single set (in other words, you no longer get stuck with low-level gear if you finish the Thieve\\'s Guild early).\r\n\r\nI. Description - Basic:\r\n\r\n - *This only modifies the Nightingale Hood, Gauntlets, Cuirass, and Boots; not the weapons.*\r\n\r\n - I adjusted the weight of the armors to weigh less when appropriate, reduced their armor rating, and of course overhauled all their enchantments. See below and screenshots for full descriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Description - In-depth:\r\n\r\n - Hood:\r\nFortify Speechcraft 10 points. This modifies both Barter and Persuasion.\r\nFortify Sneak 20 points\r\nResist Frost 20 points\r\nImmune to Poison\r\nImmune to Disease\r\n\r\n - Gauntlets:\r\nStamina regenerates 15% faster\r\nResist Frost 20 points\r\nFortify Stamina 25 points\r\nFortify Archery/Marksman 25 points\r\nFortify One-handed 25 points\r\nFortify Pickpocket 50 points\r\nFortify Lockpicking 50 points\r\n\r\n - Cuirass:\r\nFortify Sneak 20 points\r\nStamina regenerates 50% faster\r\nResist Frost 50 points\r\nFortify Stamina 50 points\r\nFortify Carry Weight 100 points\r\n\r\n - Boots:\r\nWaterwalking\r\nFortify Carry Weight 10 points\r\nResist Frost 20 points\r\nFortify Stamina 25 points\r\nFortify Sneak 25 points\r\nFortify Pickpocket 50 points\r\nMuffled movement\r\n\r\n - Masque of Clavicus Vile - OPTIONAL File:\r\nPersuasion enchantment increased from 10 to 20\r\nBarter enchantment increased from 20 to 25\r\nRegenerate Magicka enchantment stays the same: 5\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. \\\"Inspiration,\\\" or the justification behind these changes. Ignore this if you don\\'t care about the lore.\r\n\r\n - Hood:\r\nThe fabled hood of the Nightingales would be pretty damn intimidating, so I added the +10 Speechcraft bonus. The face-covering mask of one of the top three thieves of Tamriel should also provide complete immunity to Disease and Poison. The default Illusion buff\\'s existence is simply dumbfounding, so I removed it.\r\n\r\n - Gauntlets:\r\nThey\\'re Nocturnal\\'s gifts to her agents of mischief; they should provide excellent buffs to both Lockpicking and Pickpocketing. They provide an Archery/Marksman bonus and a One-Handed bonus to help the Thief when killing becomes necessary. Their daedric perfection lends them incredible warmth that increases the wearer\\'s dexterity through Frost Resistance, Stamina, and Stamina Recharge buffs.\r\n\r\n - Cuirass:\r\nThis work of perfection supports the Agent\\'s body in all the ways it should, providing a large Carry Weight bonus, heavy Stamina bonuses, and Resistances to the harsh climates of Skyrim (Frost).\r\n\r\n - Boots:\r\nA perfect thief is able to approach and scout their quarry from any angle, including the sea (Waterwalking). These Daedric gifts don\\'t allow for the wearer to trip or fall, allowing the Agent to carry more items more efficiently (Carry Weight buff) and never make a noise they didn\\'t intend (Muffle, Sneak, Pickpocket buffs).\r\n\r\n - Everything:\r\nAll the armors are lightweight and provide very little protection, as the Agent is expected to stay in the shadows, out of harm\\'s way. Each piece of armor provides Frost Resistance so the thief can face a variety of hardships as they traverse the land (this comes from my use of Frostfall - highly recommended). Most of the armors provide Sneak bonuses, because their innate Daedric nature and black color should intrinsically help the Agent blend into the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Optional File:\r\n - Since the Hood now gives a bonus to Speechcraft (Barter + Persuasion bonuses), I\\'ve included the option of a more powerful Masque of Clavicus Vile so the unique item doesn\\'t become totally vestigial.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Installation:\r\n - Use Nexus Mod Manager or drop the files (below) in your /skyrim/data/ folder, then enable them by clicking \\\"Data Files\\\" from the Skyrim Launcher.\r\n - The 1 file (or 2 if you use the Optional one) below are located in the /data folder of the zip archives:\r\n\\'Rebalanced Nightingale - Proper Stealth Armor.esp\\' and \\'Rebalanced Nightingale - Proper Stealth Armor - Clavicus Vile Optional File.esp\\'\r\n - To avoid possible problems with most mods you should unequip any items you plan on modding before you load your saved game with the mods enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Uninstallation:\r\n - Delete \\'Rebalanced Nightingale - Proper Stealth Armor.esp\\' and \\'Rebalanced Nightingale - Proper Stealth Armor - Clavicus Vile Optional File.esp\\' from your /skyrim/data/ folder or uninstall with Nexus Mod Manager. You should unequip the armor before uninstalling just to play it safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Upcoming:\r\n - If it\\'s requested, I\\'ll add an optional version of the boots (perhaps craftable) that doesn\\'t have the Waterwalking enchantment. ...or I may just add it anyway if I have time.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Bugs and Compatibility\r\n - No bugs. Will work with any mod that doesn\\'t change the Nightingale Armors. Is compatible with all Nightingale **Weapon** mods; if there are issues then it must be a conflict borne from their mod, not mine. Post your issue anyway and someone or myself will try and help.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. Enjoy.\r\n - I know this mod is very simple, but I hope it benefits a few people who were looking for a particularly... focused(?) Nightingale replacer. Let me hear what you think.",
