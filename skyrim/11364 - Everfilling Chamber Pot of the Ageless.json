  "descriptionHtml": "So while I was playing Shivering Isles I happened across a funny bit of dialogue with the Mad God Sheogorath. He said, \\\"And if you don\\'t, I\\'ll swallow your soul and vomit it into the Everfilling Chamberpot of the Ageless.\\\" I thought, wow, a chamber pot that\\'s like a soul gem! And since it\\'s \\\"everfilling\\\" it would have to be able to be replinished!\r\n\r\nSo here you go! Sheogorath\\'s lost artifact! The Everfilling Chamber Pot of the Ageless! It works exactly the same as the Black Star artifact. It can be found in Pelagius\\' Wing in the Blue Palace next to the Fireplace. You will have to either start, or have finished, the quest \\\"The Madness of Pelagius.\\\"\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n",
