I\r\nIf someone could make this work for everyone please do! And post it!\r\n\r\nAlso this is my first ever mod, so forgive my noobidity please ;)\r\n\r\nOriginal Post:\r\n\r\nAdded an alpha layer of transparency to the Ebony Armor to give it some cleavage!\r\nHaven\\'t tested it yet, so I\\'m not sure how well transparencies work, so let me know if it works.\r\nIt\\'s only for the female characters, of course. I\\'m on a mission to make Skyrim gear sexy without being sleazy XP\r\n\r\n*First image shows the texture used with the white area being the transparency.\r\n*Second image is the underlying alpha; not sure what it does, but I think it\\'s when it\\'s reflecting light.",
