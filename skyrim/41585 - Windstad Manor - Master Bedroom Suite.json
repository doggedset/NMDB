  "modName": "Windstad Manor - Master Bedroom Suite",
  "summary": "This changes the bedroom wing of Windstad manor into a full master suite including a bathing area.",
  "descriptionHtml": "After redoing the Lakewood bedroom, I was asked if I could do the others as well.  I\\'ll eventually get to Heljarchen Hall.\r\n\r\nThis mod removes the additional beds, and basically everything else, from the original bedroom. The only bed is a double bed for the dragonborn & his/her spouse. I tried to make the lighting as natural as possible. The only light sources are the candles, 2 chandeliers and fireplace.  There is a pelt on the floor with two bowls in front of it.  There is a \\'dog laying\\' marker on the pelt.  Your dog can\\'t actually eat/drink from the bowls but it\\'s the thought that counts right?  \r\n\r\nSeveral people made suggestions on the Lakeview Manor mod that I tried to incorporate into this room.  I put running water in the bathtub.  I think the sound file for it is a bit loud but I couldn\\\\\\'t figure out how to reduce it, then again, I have new speakers so it could just be me.  I changed the bed to the non-canopy version too.  All the storage in the room is safe.  \r\n\r\nNOTE:  I took the screenshots & realized the chandeliers weren\\'t visible.  I have corrected that so you will have 2 imperial chandeliers (because I was sick of goat horns).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod was cleaned with TES5Edit 3.0.30\r\n________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY:\r\nSince this ONLY alters the west wing, there shouldn\\\\\\'t be any issues with other mods unless they alter the west wing of Windstad Manor.\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\n0) Install the mod using NMM or manually (put the .esp & .bsa in the data folder). DO NOT ACTIVATE IT\r\n1) BUILD THE BEDROOM WING. Do NOT furnish it in any way.  If you do not build the bedroom, then you will have no walls, floors or ceiling, just furniture floating in a blue void.\r\n2) Remove the workbench (do not furnish the room in anyway, you CAN furnish the exterior). \r\n3) Exit game & activate the mod. \r\n4) Enjoy!\r\n\r\nI don\\'t know how it will work if you\\'ve already furnished the bedroom so you\\'ll just have to give it a shot. \r\n____________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\r\n\r\n- A legitimate copy of the game as \\\"Update.esm\\\" is a master file. \r\n- Update to the latest patch (on my Lakeview version, someone mentioned their walls,floors & ceiling disappeared but was fine after they updated)\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL:\r\n\r\nRemove the .esp & .bsa from your data folder or use NMM :)\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nOTHER STUFF:\r\n\r\nPlease don\\'t upload this elsewhere. Past that, if you want to use this in your mod (as a Windstad Manor bundle or whatever), feel free. Just give credit :) \r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nCREDIT:\r\n\r\nI used InsanitySorrow\\'s Bath Towel resource found on TES Alliance.
