My mod is classic one, means in package you get dds files to replace originals, i used real girls body here. If you dont like that body type i am not making mods for any other just avoid this mod if you dont like it. All of this is made in gimp soo you can do your own tattoos if you dont like mine. If i get some like maybe il post some gimp dds tutorial and do mods by request but for now this is it. Enjoy guys... :D\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE&#33; version b&w 0.9 is here, hope you like it\r<br />Credits:\r<br />all tnx to Zonzai for real girls body texture and  Seren for face normal maps\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36425/?",
