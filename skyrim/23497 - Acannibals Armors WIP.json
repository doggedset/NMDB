  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guys, So I just started going through Nightasy\\'s Tutorial maybe... 2-3 weeks ago? Anyways, I\\'ve got 1 male and 1 female armor put together, and plan on making many many more. Problem is, as I\\'ve found out, I\\'m pretty much garbage at texturing, don\\'t have adobe, and happen to be a perfectionist. So basically i\\'m looking for someone who really enjoys texturing, to make some textures for all the armors i\\'m making, I\\'m totally open for suggestions on armors and i\\'ll give credit where it\\'s due. I just hate texturing so much, I can\\'t get anything done once I get to that stage. Anyways, just message me or comment if you want to help.\r\n\r\nP.S., how do they look so far?",
