  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18187861/CombatCaster/CCIntro.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][B][SIZE=4]Combat casting feature[/SIZE][/B][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[B][SIZE=2]Introduction[/SIZE][/B]\r<br />Brace yourselves, fellow magic users. \r<br />If you are here, to unravel secrets of combat casting, you have come to the right place&#33; Though not everyone will survive the process, unlimited power in combat magic will be your reward, if you master the art.\r<br />\r<br />Common magic user is weakling, fearful and nervous in battle. Which has, as you might have noticed, often unfortunate consequences. Mages and wizards, who are more used to their potion mixing and scroll scribing, constantly forget to release their charged spells, making unnecessary delays between casting or fumbling completely, while they are shaking in midst of combat.\r<br />\r<br />If you submit yourselves to rigorous training in almost forgotten art of combat casting, you shall prevail&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[B][SIZE=2]Description[/SIZE][/B]\r<br />Did you ever wonder, why, if you want to cast multiple Fireballs in foe direction, you have to click mouse and hold for spell to charge, then release the mouse button to let the Fireball fly, then rest your hand a bit, and then do this freaking thing again? I did.\r<br />\r<br />Add to the mix, that you have 2 hands, each can have spell with different cast time equipped. And that you have to move around while doing these crazy click clacks on your mouse. Recipe for disaster&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Some might say that it is such way to add some skillz to the casting. Well, if they think, that overcoming cumbersome user interface equals skillz, then this mod is not for them. I prefer that difficulty comes from tough encounters, not from terrible UI, which does not allow you to do what you want in convenient way.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;So, what&#39;s the solution?&#34;\r<br />&#34;Combat casting&#33;&#34;\r<br />&#34;Alright, but what that crap does?&#34;\r<br />&#34;It casts your equipped spell as long as you hold mouse button down... and as long as you have magicka to cast it.&#34;\r<br />&#34;Oh... okay&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][B][SIZE=4]Magicka regeneration feature[/SIZE][/B][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[B][SIZE=2]What this feature does[/SIZE][/B]\r<br />Allows for magicka regeneration while casting spells - details bellow\r<br />\r<br />[B][SIZE=2]Why I made it[/SIZE][/B]\r<br />Little rant coming... magicka regeneration sucks. For two reasons... first one is that combat regeneration is weaker than out of combat regeneration - by 67%. Second one is, that if you happen to be casting or channeling, your magicka regeneration is zero no matter what. Now, there might be some apologists, who will tell that&#39;s okay and should be that way. And same people then go and enchant their gear with lower magicka cost enchants instead of magicka regeneration.\r<br />\r<br />Depending on your caster preferences, the way it is by default might be okay, or might be horrible. For example, if you cast some utility spells before combat / throw some heavy cost nukes and then join the fray with a sword, no big deal, 33% regen kicks while you hack em. If you conjure some elementals and then pick your nose and let your magicka regenerate, okay too. If, on the other hand you are actively casting spells entire combat or god forbid channeling something, prepare wagon of magicka potions, because that is the only regen you get.\r<br />\r<br />[B][SIZE=2]What this mod does - details[/SIZE][/B]\r<br />This mod is not tackling with default combat magicka regen nerf, so this stays compatible with mods that change it. But, if you don&#39;t have any other mod that handle that and you still want stronger combat magicka regen, check optionals\r<br />\r<br />What the mod does, is adding ability to player, which kicks in when in combat and casting same time. This ability regenerates magicka at the combat mana regen rate (not exactly, but near it). If you have solid regen gear, you will be able to channel some spell indefinitely, or longer time at least. If you cast few heavy cost spells, difference is not that big (total casting time is short), If you cast many lower cost spells, difference is very noticeable.\r<br />\r<br />Since version 1.1, there is also an option to enable magicka regeneration while casting out-of combat. You can choose between using Combat regeneration rate, or Full regeneration rate.\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][B][SIZE=4]Requirements[/SIZE][/B][/color]\r<br />Skyrim\r<br />[URL=http://skse.silverlock.org]SKSE[/URL]\r<br />[URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3863]SkyUI[/URL]\r<br />\r<br />[B][SIZE=2]Installation and uninstallation[/SIZE][/B]\r<br />Just enable features you want in mod configuration menu.\r<br />For combat casting feature to work, you need to remap your Left Hand and Right Hand actions from mouse buttons to keyboard (I used Home and End keys for that) in Skyrim Controls. Wait, wait, wait... don&#39;t throw Fireballs on me yet. If that would mean that you cant actually use your mouse to casting spells, I would never come with such ridiculous requirement. In fact, you can still use your mouse buttons for casting and mod will translate it to these keys itself. Just keep in mind, that to your mouse buttons to work, you need to set  Combat casting feature to true after remapping.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation is same process in reverse. Turn off features of mod in configuration and remap Left Hand and Right Hand back to your mouse buttons (if you used Combat casting feature).\r<br />\r<br />[B]For 1.1 version or older, if you do not use SkyUI[/B]\r<br />You will need to use console to activate features you want. For regeneration while casting in combat, you need to add spell &#34;CombatCasterRegen&#34; to player. For regeneration while casting out-of combat, you need to add spell &#34;CombatCasterOOCRegen&#34; to player and you need to set global variable &#34;CombatCaster_OOCRegen&#34; to 1 (for combat regen rate) or 2 (for full regen rate). If you don&#39;t know how to do that, you should rather install SkyUI before you break something. For uninstallation, remove spells you added to player, no need to change global variable.\r<br />\r<br />[B][SIZE=2]Compatibility[/SIZE][/B]\r<br />Prety much everything, worst case scenario is double regen while casting if some of your other mod does the same thing.\r<br />\r<br />[B][SIZE=2]Optional files[/SIZE][/B]\r<br />There are two optional files which raises combat magicka regen from 33% to 50% or 66%. These files are standalone, you don&#39;t need the main file for them to work. When installing with NMM, choose No when asked if it is upgrade for CombatCaster mod.\r<br />\r<br />These files are not compatible with mods, that alter same settings. In case more mods changes it, the one lower in load order wins (if they are changing this value via SKSE, they win anyway).\r<br />\r<br />[B][SIZE=2]Videos[/SIZE][/B]\r<br />Here is video made by misalen, featuring version 1.2EXP\r<br />[youtube]k3t4rbe-hDI[/youtube]\r<br />Thanks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[B][SIZE=2]History[/SIZE][/B]\r<br />v1.3\r<br />[LIST]\r<br />[*]stable version, no feature change from v1.21EXP\r<br />[/LIST]\r<br />v1.21EXP\r<br />[LIST]\r<br />[*]if you enable Combat casting feature without remapping your Left hand and Right hand action first, it will disable itself in game to prevent unexpected behavior\r<br />[*]scrolls are now working, they are casted manually thought, they are not used so often so it&#39;s not big deal\r<br />[*]SKSE returns 0 casting time for few spells, for some reason (like Conjure Familiar), if that happen, spell is now casted manually\r<br />[*]configuration is split into pages\r<br />[*]combat casting feature has some quality of life settings now:\r<br />[*]you can choose you preferred casting method (Manual or Autocast)\r<br />[*]you can set keybind for switching preferred casting method in game\r<br />[*]you can choose modificator, which will change casting method for currently casted spell, when holded\r<br />[/LIST]\r<br />v1.2EXP\r<br />[LIST]\r<br />[*]experimental Combat Casting feature\r<br />[/LIST]\r<br />v1.1\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Added Out-of Combat regeneration while casting - You can choose between None (Default), Combat or Full to determine, which regeneration rate should be used.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />v1.0\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Initial release\r<br />[*]Option to enable magicka regeneration while casting in combat\r<br />[*]Statistics about regeneration rates in configuration menu.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />Thanks everyone&#33; If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to post them.
