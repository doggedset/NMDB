  "summary": "This mod let you craft a Volendrung at a forge with Daedric Smithing Perk.",
  "descriptionHtml": "   I like the looking of Volendrung in game, but I always was very very dissapointed of his low damage as for warhammer of such type and lack of opportunity to enchant it. Also I do not want to use mods, that give me the possibility to create all daedric artefacts; I need only Volendrung.\r<br />\r<br />   So I have created this mod. Now you can create Hammer of Might at a forge from 10 ebony ingots, 2 daera hearts and 5 leather strips. The stats of warhammer (speed, reach) are the same as vanilla Volendrung has. I only have increased the damage. The warhammer do the same damage as vanila dragonbone warhammer and can be improved with one ebony ingot. Also you can enchat hammer, if you want.\r<br />\r<br />Installation\r<br />   Just put the esp-file in Skyrim/Data and activate it in launcher.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you will engoy this little mod.",
