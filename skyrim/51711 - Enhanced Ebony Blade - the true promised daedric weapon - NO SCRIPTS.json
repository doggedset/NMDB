  "summary": "The real daedric Ebony Blade  that Mephala has promised you. More damage. Upgradable. Again useful at high levels.\r<br />More in line with description: kill your enemy while he smiles at you. NO SCRIPTS INVOLVED.\r<br />Tired of that annoying useless blade? Dissapointed about Mephala lying to you? Try this.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Note to self, ignore this all of you: In requiem version of the mod, remember to esmify requiem before opening with ck to prevent corruption. Ck does not see ESP as requirements otherwise because it sucks.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />NORMAL, OVERPOWERED AND LORE-FRIENDLY VERSION&#33;\r<br />Tired of that annoying useless blade? Dissapointed about Mephala lying to you? Maybe you will like this.\r<br />I made this mod according to this(SPOILERS in this link):[url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Admonition_Against_Ebony] Notes found with Ebony Blade[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=7][color=RED]DESCRIPTION[/color][/size]\r<br />The real Ebony Blade Mephala promised you. Now its more in line with how the book and the daedric lord describes it:\r<br />&#34;Its power is without equal,  to kill while your victim smiles at you&#34;(extracted from the description book found with the blade). \r<br />Its supposed to be a feared, and a specially powerful daedric artifact. But it is an useless, low level daedric weapon. Seriously, bethesda? Let me fix that\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=RED]What this mod does:[/color][/size]\r<br />-You can now attack and your victim wont do anything. If anyone watches you attacking, they will defend your victim and treat you as a criminal, just like before, and guards will attempt to arrest you, but NOT YOUR VICTIM. Your victim wont treat it as an attack...be sure no one watches you and he/she will look at the sky thinking about the meaning of life while you kill him/her. This applies to the 3 versions.\r<br />-Presented on three flavours, normal, overpowered and lore-friendly version. I increased base damage, and the enchant damage, but only enough to be overpowered in the overpowered version. It also has crit damage, it didnt before. \r<br />-Its upgradable at the grindstone wheel (sharpen), so its again useful at high levels (technically, sharpening the blade is not lore-friendly, but it feels like a necessary change so i added a lore-friendly version without this)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=RED][size=7]STATS(THREE VERSIONS)[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=green]-&gt;NORMAL version:[/color]\r<br />Base damage increased by 4.\r<br />Added 7 crit damage (it had no critical damage in vanilla game)\r<br />The enchantment was 30 damage at full level, now its 50.\r<br />It has the same damage as the daedric greatsword, plus the absorb life enchant. \r<br />Its upgradable at the grindstone wheel \r<br />\r<br />[color=green]-&gt;Optional OVERPOWERED version patch (for players who play with increased difficulty)[/color]\r<br />Base damage increased by 13\r<br />Added 12 crit damage (it had no critical damage in vanilla game)\r<br />It deals more damage than the daedric greatsword (16 the daedric, 24 this one)\r<br />The enchantment was 30 damage at full level, now its 50.\r<br />Its upgradable at the grindstone wheel\r<br />\r<br />[color=green]&gt;Optional OVERPOWERED REQUIEM version patch (for players who play with REQUIEM in legendary and other mods that increase difficulty such as deadly dragons, deadly monsters, dragon combat overhaul...)Without a lot of aforementioned increased difficulty mods, this version is absolutely overpowered and ruins the immersion. WARNING&#33;&#33;&#33; USE ONLY ONE PATCH, NOT BOTH.\r<br />[/color]Made for Requiem version 1.8.11\r<br />Added Requiem´s daedric keyword (so it penetrates armor like the other daedric weapons)\r<br />Increased item value to 96000\r<br />Base damage increased even more\r<br />It can now be enchanted\r<br />Added 18 crit damage \r<br />It deals more damage than the daedric greatsword (24 the daedric, 35 this one)\r<br />The enchantment is now 90 damage at full level.\r<br />Its upgradable at the grindstone wheel\r<br />\r<br />[color=green]-&gt;LORE-FRIENDLY version:[/color]\r<br />NOT upgradable at the grindstone wheel---&gt;this makes it lore friendly.\r<br />Base damage increased by 8. \r<br />Added 10 crit damage (it had no critical damage in vanilla game)\r<br />The enchantment was 30 damage at full level, now its 50.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=7][color=RED]INSTALLATION[/color][/size]\r<br />If using the overpowered patch, when Nexus mod manager asks for update say NO, and if it asks to overwrite say YES.\r<br />Place  the overpowered patch(if used) AFTER the main file in load order.\r<br />If using the requiem overpowered patch you can place the main file before requiem, but the requiem overpowered patch must be placed AFTER requiem and AFTER this mods main file.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=7][color=RED]COMPATIBILITY[/color][/size]\r<br />-Compatible with everything, even mods that alter perks like sperg, skyre...\r<br />-Obviously, similar mods that alter the same sword are redundant, and not compatible.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />NO SCRIPTS ADDED OR CHANGED&#33;\r<br />If someone wants an enchantable version, i will add it.\r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods:\r<br />Requiem. Its a pain in the *** to find compatible mods for it, or the patches for each of them but once configured...im in love with it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][font=Tahoma][color=Blue]Do you like my work? take a look at my other mods:[/color][/font][/size]\r<br />[color=BLUE][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51536/?]Npc clones - Follower and marry[/url][/color]\r<br />[color=BLUE][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52065/?]Children Followers -FULLY VOICED- they fight -pickpocketable-[/url][/color]\r<br />[color=BLUE][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51535/?]Multiple Marriages-Spouse Dress Up-SPANISH VOICES- version 121[/url][/color]\r<br />[color=BLUE][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51287/?]Teleport to and between all player homes and mark-recall locations[/url][/color]\r<br />[color=BLUE][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51711/?]Enhanced Ebony Blade - the true promised daedric weapon - NO SCRIPTS[/url][/color]",
