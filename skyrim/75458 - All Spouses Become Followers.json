  "descriptionHtml": "This is my second mod I&#39;m uploading to the Nexus. I hope you enjoy&#33;\r<br />[color=#ff0000][b][color=#ff7700]Please note this mod requires Hearthfires&#33;\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Please read the section &#34;Warnings and Precautions&#34; before using&#33;[/color][/color][/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][b][u][size=4]Description[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b][size=3][color=#ffffff][size=2]After marrying an NPC in-game, I found it kind of lame and heartbreaking that you have basically sentenced them to life in whichever home you send them. I know there are mods out there that allow for your spouse to actually work a store stall outside the home during the day, and at least one I can think of that allows them sandbox about town, but that still seems... lacking.\r<br />\r<br />I want to be able to take my spouse with me on my travels. Maybe take them for a walk around a lake, introduce them to other friends, let them see the world. And most importantly, let them share in your life as [i]the Dovahkiin.[/i] Have them witness when you take down powerful enemies, when you save someone&#39;s life, let them be an actual companion to help you save Skyrim&#33;\r<br />\r<br />With all this in mind, I have made this simple mod that turns any NPC into your follower [u]during[/u] the wedding ceremony; After the ceremony they will have all the follower options.Â  All I did was add one line of code to the wedding scene script. [i]This mod does not work retro-actively; If you&#39;re already married it will do nothing.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][color=#ffff00][size=4][size=3][size=4]Installation[/size]\r<br />[/size][/size][/color][/b][/u][color=#ffff00][size=4][size=3][color=#ffffff][size=2]\r<br />Back-up your save&#33;\r<br />Install using the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57044/?]Mod Manager\r<br />[/url][/size][/color]\r<br />[/size][/size][/color][/size][/color][/size][/color]OR For manual install:\r<br />\r<br />1) Unzip/Extract &#34;SpouseBecomesFollower-(numbers).7z&#34;\r<br />2) Select &#34;SpouseBecomesFollower.esp&#34; AND the &#34;Scripts&#34; folder.\r<br />3) Drag and drop/cut and paste into your &#34;Skyrim&#92;Data&#34; folder.\r<br />4) Agree to merge folders.\r<br />5) Activate the ESP on your Plugins list.\r<br />\r<br />[b]When To Install:\r<br />\r<br />[/b]If it&#39;s not obvious, you should install this mod before you are married. Any stage of the Quest before walking into the Temple of Mara to begin the &#34;wedding scene&#34; should be fine. However, as is the case with -any- mod, I strongly suggest you install before starting a new game, with a &#34;fresh&#34; or &#34;clean&#34; save.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][u][color=#ffff00]Requirements\r<br />[/color][/u][/b][color=#ffff00][color=#ffffff]\r<br />[/color][/color][/size]This mod requires:\r<br />[u][b][color=#ff7700]Skyrim.esm\r<br />Updates.esm\r<br />Hearthfires.esm[/color][/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=4][color=#ffff00]Compatibility[/color][/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod is [u]not [/u]compatible with any mods that alter the Quest\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffe599]RelationshipMarriageWedding[color=#ffffff] (Form ID: 0007404E)\r<br />\r<br />This includes mods that changes or expands on the wedding ceremony itself. If requested, I will see what I can do about &#34;patches&#34; for other mods, but your best bet is to contact the author of the other mod; This one is very simplistic and easily integrated, and those authors will have a much better idea of how to handle it than I.\r<br />\r<br />Although this was made with the Vanilla marriageable NPCs in mind, this mod -should- be compatible with any user-created NPC (as long as they can be married.) In most cases, user-created NPCs are already followers, so it&#39;s not an issue. But for the few that are not, there shouldn&#39;t be any problems.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=#ffff00][size=4]Uninstalling:[/size][/color][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Uninstalling any mod that alters scripts during an active game/save is [b][i]never[/i][/b] a good idea. I highly recommend against it. However, \r<br />\r<br />It can be removed:\r<br />Using the Mod Manager\r<br />\r<br />OR, if you installed manually, deleting the following files:\r<br />\r<br />SpouseBecomesFollower.esp (Located in &#34;Skyrim&#92;Data&#34;)\r<br />QF_RelationshipMarriageWeddin_0007404E.pex (Located in &#34;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Scripts&#34;) (&#34;Weddin&#34; is not a typo.)\r<br />QF_RelationshipMarriageWeddin_0007404E.psc (Located in &#34;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Scripts&#92;Source&#34;)\r<br />\r<br />(a note - you may have to replace &#34;QF_RelationshipMarriageWeddin_0007404E.psc &#34; with the one found inside the &#34;Source&#34; folder of &#34;[u]Scripts.rar[/u]&#34; under &#34;Skyrim&#92;Data&#34;. This shouldn&#39;t be necessary, but it -may- help if you have issues uninstalling.)\r<br />\r<br />Again, I can&#39;t be sure what sort of things may happen if you uninstall during an active save. Papyrus is very touchy.\r<br />Uninstalling before a new game will not cause issues.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][b][u][center]Warnings and Precautions[/center][/u][/b][/size][/color][/color][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*][size=2]This is my first mod that involves any kind of scripting. While I have tested this mod under many circumstances, and I am confident in it&#39;s stability (otherwise why would I post it?) I can&#39;t say for certain what sort of bugs or hang-ups might arise. As you should do before installing any new mods, regardless, [u][i][b][color=#ff0000]BACK UP YOUR SAVES&#33;&#33;[/color][/b][/i][/u] I have had this mod running in my game for many, [i]many[/i] play hours and have not come across any bugs. If you do, please report them to me and I will see what I can do to work around or fix the issue.[/size]\r<br />[*][color=#f9cb9c][size=2]Not All Marriageable NPCs Are Combat Ready or Essential&#33; [/size][/color][size=2]This means that your spouse may very well die in combat if you&#39;re not careful. An easy way to get around this is to use the console command &#34;setessential&#34;. Go [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Console_Commands_(Skyrim)]here[/url] for more information. You could also simply send them home before you go off on dangerous adventures.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[*][size=2]Some NPCs might not have &#34;safe follower voices&#34;. [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/964801-modder-reference-for-follower-voices/]Check out this thread for more information.[/url][/size]\r<br />[*] [size=2]Using the Creation Kit, you can make all kinds of tweaks to an NPC, such as Health, Fighting Style, Inventory, Confidence, Aggression, etc to make your spouse of choice a more viable combat partner, if you wish. Maybe you want them to be weak and afraid? It&#39;s your game. However, for more information on these tweaks [url=https://levelskip.com/rpgs/Hot-to-Turn-Your-Skyrim-Character-into-a-Follower]check out this guide[/url][/size][size=2] on making a custom follower/spouse as a guideline to editing an existing NPC.[/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[u][b][color=#ffff00][size=4]Credits and Special Thanks[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />I would like to thank the contributors to both the Creation Kit and Skyrim Wikis.
