  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]Ohraahriohri bla bla bla bla... Ohraahriohri bla bla bla....Â Ohraahriohri bla bla bla bla\r<br />\r<br />Seriously, WTF is that&#33;? It&#39;s one of the most disappointing and unimmersive things you can find across ALL Skyrim world. Even with a lot of npcs mod, your taverns will not EVER seems so crowded. And also, why they always repeat the same senseless words???\r<br />\r<br />The porpouse of this mod is to REMOVE TOTALLY this abomination.\r<br />\r<br />If you haven&#39;t any idea of what i&#39;m talking about, you&#39;re simply deaf. Aside from jokes, if you&#39;re so inattentive try to enter in a tavern (i suggest the Winking Skeever or Bannered Mare) around 10 PM o&#39;cloack. Put to 0 the music volume and to 100 the effects one. And finally you will understand what i&#39;m blabbering about. It can be called the &#34;crawded mess&#34; or whatever we can call it. And if EVEN NOW you still don&#39;t understand what i mean, you can watch this video:\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]ValCDBiYAt4[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t need to do all this mess and already know what i&#39;m talking about... well seriously, YOU ARE STILL HERE? Hurry and download the mod&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The archive contains 4 audio files that replace the vannila&#39;s ones. They are silent and empty like the head of the idiot that suggested to put this sound inside/outside a desolate place. You can install the mod simply putting it in the data folder or (HIGLY RECCOMENDED) using a mod manager for easily install/uninstall. The mod don&#39;t contains esps, bsas and ABOVE ALL SCRIIIIIPTS. This is the reason why its version is FINAL.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to update/share this s**t, feel free to do. I write this because... well i don&#39;t know even why. I can&#39;t imagine the porpouse of doing it... outside a sudden madness.[/size]",
