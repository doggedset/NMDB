  "descriptionHtml": "Note: There is now an optional file with all the voice files in WAV format so you can see if you like them before installing the actual mod.\r<br />\r<br />Night Mother Voice Replacer\r<br />---------------------------\r<br />Let&#39;s face it, someone needs to give the old gal a cough drop.  Gods, Cicero, what do they pay you for?  Too busy oiling her down to notice that she&#39;s got a bad case of laryngitis...\r<br />\r<br />Anyways, no one likes the creepy vanilla night mother voice so I whipped up a replacer.  I think this is the only replacer so far that does this, easy to install; just drag and drop into your Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />I did rewrite some of the dialogue as well to suit my own tastes, but it doesn&#39;t vary much from the vanilla.  A few wording tweaks so the voice would sound better.  One noticeable change is that I added a little variety to the recurring quest lines and I removed all reference to &#34;gold&#34;.  I always felt that it was odd that the Night Mother, Matron of Death, would be so mercenary.  Instead I have replaced the &#34;accept his gold&#34; parts with more religious/dark references like &#34;The Void hungers for yet more souls&#34; etc.  I feel these changes are justified and lore friendly, I suppose that originally the Dark Brotherhood was primarily religious in nature and took contracts for those purposes, but over time pecuniary interests necessitated accepting payment for contracts.  The Night Mother should be above such base interests however.\r<br />\r<br />Didn&#39;t play the entire DB questline with this, but I did work my way through to make sure I could confirm the lines would play correctly.  Though I did use Refuzer to make the .fuz files and it said everything was ok.\r<br />\r<br />I highly recommend the female Cicero mod and the Sicarius armor replacer mod if you play the DB questline.  There&#39;s also a DB Forever non-recurring mod if you don&#39;t want the random quests to keep popping up for the Dark Brotherhood forever even after you&#39;ve finished everything.\r<br />\r<br />I was a bit tempted to use a British voice, heh heh.  &#34;Tea and biscuits in the Void with Sithis, dearie?&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Hope you like it.\r<br />\r<br />-mel\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Tools Used\r<br />----------\r<br />Refuzer\r<br />https://text-to-speech-demo.mybluemix.net/\r<br />http://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-wav",
