  "descriptionHtml": "So you\\'re riding along on your costly steed when all of a sudden the screen shakes and you hear a loud roar... A Dragon! With Steel in hand you dismount your horse ready to take the beast down... But what\\'s this? Your Horse now suddenly thinks he is Dragonborn and charges towards the Dragon, blocking your line of sight only to meet his demise almost immediately. Before you can even get in range of said Dragon to land a hit.\r\n\r\nHow about when you\\'re out hunting with your faithful Dog and instead of your thoughts being on the hunt, they are on whether your dog is going to get itself killed.\r\n\r\nSound Familiar?\r\n\r\nThis mod understands that Animal Companions are costly to the new adventurer aswell as often a complete annoyance (Shadowmere in particular!) and so it aims to compensate for this by making horses less aggressive (Horses will now run a short distance away from fighting) and marking your Horses aswell as Dog Companions as essential so as to avoid any unwanted and frustrating deaths.\r\n\r\nThis mod will conflict with other mods that impact Horses and/or Companion Dogs, other than that there should be no problems. Please let me know if you find any.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n==============================================\r\n\r\nV1.0\r\n-Makes Companion Dogs as well as Player Owned Horses essential\r\n-Makes Horses less aggressive",
