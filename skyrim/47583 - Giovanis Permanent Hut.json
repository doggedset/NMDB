  "summary": "A home between homes for the Dragonborn, left by an ancient Mage named Giovani, who saw the future, and left it to the one who could unlock the door... somehow.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This started off as my idea of what the inside of a hut from the spell Leomund&#39;s Tiny Hut from Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Ed, would be like. But then, realized that certain features were more than what the spell offered, let alone the hut isn&#39;t permanent.\r<br />\r<br />So, I eventually spun off the idea and created &#34;Giovani&#39;s Permanent Hut.&#34; A book is strategically left next to the Book Of The Dragonborn in the Helgen torture room that will leave a vague clue as to how to get in, and it&#39;s purpose.\r<br />\r<br />As I have Dudestia&#39;s multi-marage mod, and Amazing Followers Tweeks, I designed the lower inner chamber with multiple beds and furniture for the npc&#39;s left within, to sandbox about. Feel free, if you wish and have the know-how, to re-arrange the bottom level how you wish, and or add stuff to the upper level.\r<br />\r<br />Hearth Fire IS required.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Xander9009 for providing the script necessary for my little story behind this hut to make sense. =^_^=\r<br />\r<br />P.S.\r<br />\r<br />Feedback is appreciated.",
