Skipable version will be fixed as well.\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Credit: All credit goes to Brady Wold, Ramin Djawadi, and Roland Studio HD for creating this. And Game of Throns check the show out on HBO. Any later things like skipable will be added by me alone.\r<br />                               ",
