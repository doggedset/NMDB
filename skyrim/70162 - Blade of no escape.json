  "summary": "This is a neat sword (random choice) that does about 400+damage, restores 25health on hit and is quite OP, can one-hit giants dead",
  "descriptionHtml": "I think I used an imperial sword or maybe a steel sword, can&#39;t remember. \r<br />\r<br />It does more than 400Â  damage and I consider it a cheat item.\r<br />It also recharges player with 25 health each hit/s (successful hits obviously)\r<br />\r<br />Once you have downloaded this with nmm, start your game, go to a forge.\r<br />Any normal forge, it uses a couple of iron ingots to make, the first upgrade \r<br />can be done for minimal resources too.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first attempt at a mod, I am not going to update this.\r<br />I actually made it as an experiment to see if I like using creation kit.\r<br />I keep this weapon on me in game, but don&#39;t actully use it unless I feel its\r<br />the only way to progress. you can use it as much as you like tho.\r<br />\r<br />You may not steal my work in anyway, You will be smited in one way or another.\r<br />If you wish to edit this mod, mention me in your credits, download and enjoy.\r<br />If this mod causes bugs, I don&#39;t need to know. My Skyrim is fully up to date and legit,\r<br />and it works fine there, so it should work fine anywhere (unless you&#39;re a pirate game player,\r<br />in that case just leave, don&#39;t touch my stuff).",
