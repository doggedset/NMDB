Installation & Compatibility\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=#1E90FF]Description[/color][/size]\r\n Enhanced Smithing Tree changes dramaticaly the smithing tree progression.Perks require the generic steel, scale and plated armors\\' perks in order to be unlocked, instead of armor perks that have nothing to do with each other ( like dwarven requirement for orcish smthing ).\r\n\r\n The perk tree also is no longer separated in light/heavy armor branches.All perks require directly or indirectly the Steel Smithing or Advanced Armors perks, and they\\'re now the center of the tree.\r\n\r\n A new perk, Preciouscraft, allows the construction of jewelry ( wich now require it to be crafted ) and silver weapons ( wich have been given tempering as well ).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=#1E90FF]Perks[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n• [size=2][color=#B0C4DE]Steel Forging[/color][/size]\r\n Construction of steel weapons and armor is no longer a challenge.Steel knowledge allows for further understanding of smithing.\r\n- Requires: 20 smithing;\r\n- Improves steel tempering by [color=#6495ED]50%[/color];\r\n- Improves iron tempering by [color=#6495ED]15%[/color].\r\n\r\n• [size=2][color=#FFA500]Dewmer Replication[/color][/size]\r\n Although the secret of creating dwarven metal was lost with the Dwemer, one may use the scrap metal left by the Dwemer in order to recreate their weapons and armor.The heavy weight of the metal makes Dwemer weapons more effective than weapons of harder materials.\r\n- Requires: 30 smithing and [color=#B0C4DE]Steel Forging[/color] perk;\r\n- Improves dwarven tempering by [color=#6495ED]50%[/color].\r\n\r\n• [size=2][color=#FFD700]Merethic Forging[/color][/size]\r\n Coming mostly from raw moonstone, elven weapons and armor were mainly used by Altmer forces.The secret of crafting it was guarded by the elves, until the betrayal of Ulvul Llaren brought it to the rest of Tamriel.\r\n- Requires: 30 smithing and [color=#B0C4DE]Steel Forging[/color] perk;\r\n- Improves elven tempering by [color=#6495ED]50%[/color].\r\n\r\n• [size=2][color=#C0C0C0]Preciouscraft[/color][/size]\r\n Because Silver and Gold are rare materials, blacksmiths quickly learned how to work them for profit.The creation of jewelry is an art by itself.\r\n- Requires: 40 smithing and [color=#B0C4DE]Steel Forging[/color] perk;\r\n- Improves silver tempering by [color=#6495ED]50%[/color];\r\n- Allows creation of silver & gold jewelry as well as silver weapons.\r\n\r\n• [size=2][color=#778899]Advanced Metallurgics[/color][/size]\r\n Deeper knowledge on smithing allows the creation of armor using plated and scaled techniques, as well as mixing multiple materials.\r\n- Requires: 50 smithing and [color=#B0C4DE]Steel Forging[/color] perk;\r\n- Improves scaled and plated tempering by [color=#6495ED]50%[/color].\r\n- Improves steel tempering by [color=#6495ED]15%[/color].\r\n\r\n• [size=2][color=#008000]Volcanic Smithing: Malachite[/color][/size]\r\n Commonly found in Morrowind on the volcanic island of Vvardenfell, Glass is a sister-metal of Ebony.Bearing no relation to the common glass used in windows, Malachite is oftenly mixed with other materials to give it the right strength.\r\n- Requires: 70 smithing and [color=#778899]Advanced Metallurgics[/color] perk;\r\n- Improves glass tempering by [color=#6495ED]50%[/color].\r\n\r\n• [size=2][color=#696969]Volcanic Smithing: Ebony[/color][/size]\r\n Said to be the crystallized blood of the gods, ebony is one of the hardest materials of Tamriel.It\\'s mastery allows construction of ebony weapons and armor, and may futurely be mixed with Daedra hearts.\r\n- Requires: 80 smithing and [color=#778899]Advanced Metallurgics[/color] perk;\r\n- Improves ebony tempering by [color=#6495ED]50%[/color].\r\n\r\n• [size=2][color=#559B2F]Orichalc Mastery[/color][/size]\r\n Famous for being used mostly by Orcs, orichalcum is melded with iron to prevent it of becoming brittle.The first orichalc weapons were used by the Yokudans during the Mythic Era.\r\n- Requires: 50 smithing and [color=#778899]Advanced Metallurgics[/color] perk;\r\n- Improves orcish tempering by [color=#6495ED]50%[/color].\r\n\r\n• [size=2][color=#F4A460]Dragon Harvesting[/color][/size]\r\n Allows the construction of Dragon equipment through the use of dragon bones or scales.Dragon craft is extremely rare mainly due to the lack of living dragons for ages.\r\n- Requires: 100 smithing and [color=#778899]Advanced Metallurgics[/color] perk;\r\n- Improves dragon tempering by [color=#6495ED]50%[/color].\r\n\r\n• [size=2][color=#DC143C]Daedric Understanding[/color][/size]\r\n Daedric smithing consists of the mixing of ebony, a rare and valuable metal, with the core of daedric creatures -
