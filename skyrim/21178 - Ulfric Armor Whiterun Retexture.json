  "summary": "Ulfric\\'s clothes converted to a light armor as a \\'Noble Nord Light Mail\\'. Retextured with subtle Whiterun colors, fit for a Thane of Whiterun.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first and probably last mod. It\\'s just yet another Ulfric Armor mod, though with a slight and very subtle retexture to blend in with Whiterun\\'s colors. I play a Nord \\'Noble\\' character of Whiterun -- or that\\'s how I view myself at any rate:p -- so I felt I needed an appropriate armor. Ulfric\\'s clothes fits perfectly for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s craftable and upgradable (with a corundum ingot). Requires the \\'advanced smithing\\' perk, and is in that regard roughly similar to the scaled armor.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is not a standalone armor piece, but Ulfric\\'s clothes as armor, because I was lazy I guess. So he will also be wearing this.\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t make Ulfric\\'s boots and gauntlets craftable as I don\\'t like the looks of them. Instead I recommend using scaled boots and gauntlets, as well as a Whiterun Guard\\'s Helmet.",
