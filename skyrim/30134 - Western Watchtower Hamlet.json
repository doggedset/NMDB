  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/s8comoY.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />* All constructive criticism will be gladly welcome&#33; Please suscribe, rate and comment if you like it&#33;\r<br />** This mod does not conflit with Mirmulnir&#39;s attack during the main quest. Villagers will not intervene (Guards still do).\r<br />*** This mod should not conflict with any other mods other than ones that would modify the Western Watchtower.\r<br />\r<br />A cozy little village at the Western Watchtower, which adds an Inn, a Player&#39;s House (meant for early game, not a mansion&#33;), Merchants and Villagers as well as crafting equipment. All completely navmeshed and follower friendly.\r<br />\r<br />The village does not conflict with dragon attacks (Mirmulnir or others). It reduces the battlefield around the watch tower, but gives strategic positioning to both the player AND the dragons.\r<br />\r<br />Please, rate and comment&#33;\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />V3.0 Changes (Feb. 8) :\r<br />\r<br />- Improvements of the Drachenhaus interior. More custom design and clutter.\r<br />- Improvement of Navmesh for the general area. Mainly Venna&#39;s house and the Drachenhaus. \r<br />- Fixed a merchant who would not go to work. Now, Aswad will be at his market stall during daytime and return home after a hard day of labour. \r<br />\r<br />V2.0 Changes:\r<br />\r<br />- Deleted Doomnick and Simon Gouletssen.\r<br />- Reduced the AI packages and NPC movement in the Hamlet (it made it too heavy on the framerate)\r<br />\r<br />- Modified the inside of Venna&#39;s House. (Added more details. Aswad (the Hunter gear vendor) also lives there now.\r<br />- More detailed interior for the player house.\r<br />- Better Navmesh for a better AI pathfinding. \r<br />- Better lighting (less flickering).\r<br />- Modified Holindil to go from beggar to drunk in the Inn.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Simply extract the file in your data folder, and activate the plugin in your launcher. \r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />\r<br />If you have any items stored in the Drachenhaus, do not forget to remove them&#33; Other than that, simply make sure your character is in a different area before deactivating and deleting the plugin.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility Issues:\r<br />\r<br />Any mod that modifies the Western Watchtower area. \r<br />\r<br />There should not be any issues with mods influencing AI packages (per example: Wet and Cold - Holiday) but I&#39;m not sure my mod will be affected.\r<br />\r<br />******************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />*****************  &#34;Spoilers&#34;  **********************************************************************************************\r<br />\r<br />Known &#34;issues&#34;: Hjongar is a tough A-Hole. I know, I made him like that. He&#39;s easy to kite back to the guards tho.\r<br />\r<br />If Hjongar doesn&#39;t spawn, just walk around the Whiterun plains in the area near the watchtower. He&#39;s bound to attack you at any given moment, given that he&#39;s &#34;looking for you&#34;... or you&#39;re bound to find his corpse laying somewhere because he took on a regiment.",
