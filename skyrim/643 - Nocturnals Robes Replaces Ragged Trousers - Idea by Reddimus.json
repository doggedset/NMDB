  "summary": "Replaces the Ragged Trowsers with Noctornal\\'s Robes. Original idea by Reddimus here:http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=628",
  "descriptionHtml": "I thought this was a great idea by Reddimus (http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=628), but as a lot of people said, Forsworn armor seems to be an armor a lot of people like to use. I messed around trying to get this to work with a different type of set, but because of my limited knowledge of how to modify things the best I could get that works is to get it to replace the Ragged Trousers found on prisoners in most dungeons.\r\n\r\nAll credit for this idea and mod should go to Reddimus - I\\'m simply trying to fill the request for it to be a different armor set. Also, I didn\\'t include the hood, but I might add that in if I get around to it.",
