  "descriptionHtml": "This is the Epic Version of the Blade of Elements.\r\n\r\nThe Blade of Elements is a mod that adds a new weapon, the Elemental Blade. This version of the mod gives the weapon 10 points of Fire, Frost, and Shock damage along with a swing speed of 1.5, as opposed to the normal 1. This version is different from the other two (Backfire Version && Progression Version) as for it has no relevance to your destruction skill and no chance of backfire.\r\n\r\nThe weapon has unlimited charge.\r\nThe weapon can be found in Bleak Falls Barrow, lying on the table in the room with the Thu\\'um word wall.\r\nThe weapon is based on a daedric sword. I do not retexture items, but if anyone who does would like to, let me know.\r\n\r\nThe Backfire version is the same as this version, with a chance of backfire depending on your destruction skill. (Uploaded)\r\n\r\nThe Progression version increases its elemental damage depending on your current destruction skill. (UPLOADED)",
