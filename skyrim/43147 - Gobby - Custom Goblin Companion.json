  "descriptionHtml": "[line]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Pfgp6Ud.png[/img]\r\n[line]\r\n[size=4][color=green][font=\\\"Impact\\\"]Gobby is a custom mesh, custom textured Goblin that can be found in a new cave that I created near Whiterun. Gobby is a companion and takes the slot of an animal so you can have him as your animal follower and still have a human companion. Gobby is essential so he can never die. Gobby\\'s cave is called \\\"Gobby\\'s Ristorante\\\" which is Restaurant in Italian. You can find Gobby in the back room cooking up some Goat-Rabbit stew, enjoy! \r\n\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/NuaVn0l.png[/img]\r\n[line]\r\nThis mod REQUIRES the Dragonborn DLC, if you do not have this DLC, the mod will not work. And cause a CTD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/lllygKR.png[/img]\r\n[line]\r\nInstallation is extremely simple if you use NMM, so why over complicate it for yourself if you install manually? GET NEXUS MOD MANAGER, IT\\'S SO MUCH EASIER! But if you still refuse, just drag and drop the Data Folder into your C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim Directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/6bSnL2G.png[/img]\r\n[line]\r\nThe meshes for Gobby were created by Vicn check out his mods here: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3863233/?tb=mods&pUp=1]Vicn\\'s Mods[/url].
