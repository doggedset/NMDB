  "descriptionHtml": "SBMS (Skyrim Balanced Magic System)\r\nBy Akfek Branford\r\nVersion 1.01\r\n\r\n**Updated 1/15/12** See Changelog section for details.\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n--------------\r\nThey say the pen is mightier than the sword, but in Skyrim once you have hit a high \r\nenough level, the sword becomes mightier than an exploding fireball to the face. This mod \r\nseeks to fix this little oversight.\r\n\r\nSBMS adds a few spells and makes a host of tweaks to balance the magic system in Skyrim. \r\nMost of these spells are destruction spells. The goal was to keep tactical options in \r\ndestruction viable, so destruction mages don\\'t just end up spamming incinerate. The mod \r\nchanges some things that don\\'t make sense; Like why a powerful enchanter can\\'t craft a \r\nrobe any better than what Belethor would sell to an adventurer fresh off the prison cart, \r\nor how powerful healers can\\'t even cure the common cold. It also empowers some artifacts \r\nto reflect some of the changes.\r\n\r\nI have listed what changes I made below, but if you want to know more about how I \r\nbalanced the magic system, keep reading. Otherwise just skip the rest of this section and \r\nmove on to the changes section below. \r\n\r\nAfter spending a ton of time examining the damage formulas and how bow damage and spell \r\ndamage relate (I used bow damage, because destruction is primarily a ranged attack, and \r\nshould be compared to other ranged attacks) the damage output from destruction is \r\ngenerally higher than the damage output from archery+ enchanting+ smithing at the same \r\nlevel, meaning a character with level 50 destruction spells can do considerably more \r\ndamage than a character with 50 archery, smithing and Enchanting. But once a character \r\ngets incinerate and has taken both fire damage bonus perks, that ends.  A character with \r\nincinerate,  2/2 augmented flames and dual cast has roughly the same DPS as an archer \r\nwith a legendary smithed Daedric Bow, +160% in damage gear and Daedric arrows. Of course, \r\nthat does not take into account Enchanted bows, or sneak attack bonuses, poisons, \r\nelemental fury, or any of the other ways damage can be increased.\r\n\r\nSo magic stops scaling at the expert level, and archery keeps scaling until all relevant \r\nstats are at 100. Magic also burns through the resource you need to use it too fast. \r\nFight a moderately powerful foe with magic and you might run out before you kill him. If \r\nhe brings friends, you will find yourself chugging potions for dear life. Do the same \r\nwith steel and though you might need a quick rest afterwards, you can generally  save \r\nyour potions for bosses. This mod changes all of this. Destruction spell costs are \r\nreduced. You still might need a potion on bosses (at least until you reach 100 \r\nenchanting) but there will be far fewer instances of chugging for dear life in the middle \r\nof a battle. I have also increased the amount of magicka regen rate available to players \r\nthrough enchanting and artifacts. This will make a build without 100% reduction viable \r\nagain if a player so wishes.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have greatly increased the potency of the existing master level destruction \r\nspells. In Vanilla, they suck. They are only rarely worth using. These new spells pack \r\nthe earth shaking punch they are supposed to (Message me on the nexus or post on their \r\nforums if you think the spells are too strong.)\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nDecrease the base cost of all destruction spells by 50%\r\n\r\nGreatly increase the potency of the existing Master level destruction spells.\r\n\r\nDecreases the cost of dual casting from x2.8 to x2.3\r\n\r\nIncrease the duration of several utility spells. \r\n\r\nIncrease the Duration of Dragonhide.\r\n\r\nRaise the level cap for Dead Thralls\r\n\r\nIncrease the potency of the flesh spells.\r\n\r\nIncrease the armor provided by ward spells.\r\n\r\nIncrease the power of Guardian Circle\r\n\r\nReduce the mastery needed to cast cloak spells\r\n\r\nThe wall spells now actually do 50 points of damage.\r\n \r\nIncrease the potency of Elemental Resistance, Magicka Regen, and Fortify Magic school \r\nenchantments.\r\n\r\nIncreased the power of Morokei, Nahkrin, Otar, Vokyr and the Arch Mages Robe to fall more \r\nin line with the new enchantments. \r\n\r\nMorokei now has the shout recharge reduction it was supposed to have in the first place.\r\n \r\nAdded 15 new spells (mostly destruction) and placed them in the merchants leveled lists.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nNew Spells\r\n--------------------\r\nNote: New spells are in the vendor lists. Just visit a spell salesman when they would \r\nnormally sell a spell of the level you are looking for, and the spell should be there. \r\nOr, if that is too much work, there is a complete set in the testing hall spell tome \r\ncabinet (qasmoke).\r\n\r\nNight Eye (Alteration Adept) - Gives the player a night eye effect for 2 minutes\r\n\r\nBane (Alteration Apprentice)- Inflict weak weakness to magic on a foe\r\n\r\nScourge (Alteration Expert) - Inflict strong weakness to magic on a foe\r\n\r\nFlame Barrier (Destruction Expert) - Cloak effect. 30dmg/s\r\n\r\nFrost Barrier (Destruction Expert) - Cloak effect. 30dmg/s\r\n\r\nLightning Barrier (Destruction Expert) - Cloak effect. 30dmg/s\r\n\r\nFire Blast (Destruction Master) - 90 points of fire damage. Explodes. \r\n\r\nThunderstorm (Destruction Master) - 90 Points of shock damage. Hops from Target to Target\r\n\r\nDeep Freeze (Destruction Master) - 90 Points of frost damage. Moves like Ice Storm.\r\n\r\nFlame Mine (Destruction Expert) - 120 point mine. \r\n\r\nFrost Mine (Destruction Expert) - 120 point mine.\r\n \r\nThunder Mine (Destruction Expert) - 120 point mine.\r\n \r\nBlink  (Illusion Apprentice) - Invisible for 15s\r\n\r\nVanish (Illusion Master) - Invisible for 120s\r\n\r\nCure Disease (Restoration Adept)  - Cure Diseases. \r\n\r\nScreen (Alteration Apprentice) - Increase Magic Resistance by 20 for 60 Seconds.\r\n\r\nForce Field (Alteration Expert) - Increase Magic Resistance by 35 for 60 Seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n----------------\r\nThe mastery school displayed on screen is lower on some of the new spells than it should \r\nbe. However, the new spells still use the perk they are supposed to when calculating \r\nmagicka cost. \r\n\r\nSome users are reporting that their game crashes when they learn a mine spell, and then access their magic menu. \r\n\r\nUnknown bugs:\r\n---------------------\r\nLet me know, yo. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n----------------\r\nIt\\'s a standard esp with no additional files. Just drop it in your data folder and enjoy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nUninstallation\r\n-------------------\r\nIt\\'s a standard esp with no additional files. Just find it in your data folder, highlight \r\nit, and delete it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes \r\n------------\r\nThis should be a complete mod, but if you find a mistake, just message me and I will fix \r\nit. Hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\nI have included a new spells only esp as well as an esp that keeps the new spells and all the changes I made directly to spells, but does not keep the rest of the changes. Choose only 1 ESP.\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nReduced the base damage of the new master destruction spells from 90 to 85\r\n\r\nDecreased the base damage of Firestorm and Lightningstorm, increased the power of Blizzard. \r\n\r\nFixed some casting time issues on a few spells. \r\n\r\nAssigned Torchlight the proper mastery and increased its duration.\r\n\r\nAdjusted the power of the various turn undead spells (generally made them not a waste of gold)\r\n\r\nRestored Fire Storm\\'s casting animation. \r\n\r\nFixed an Issue where Bane did not work\r\n\r\nFixed an Issue where Bane and Scourge did not have a visible projectile. \r\n\r\nAdded 2 new spells: Screen and Force Field\r\n\r\n",
