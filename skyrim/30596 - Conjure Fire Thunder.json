  "summary": "Changes conjure familiar sound effect.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very simple sound effect change. I got it from a 6000 sound effect cd. It just changes the default clanking sound when you conjure a familiar to a subtle thunder sound. I didn\\'t think the clanking sound was very magical. :) It\\'s my first time experimenting with the different sounds. Very simple mod. It has probably been done many times. Copy the sound folder in this rar file to your Skyrim\\\\data folder. If there is not a sound folder present there this will create one. I made a shortcut on my desktop to the Skyrim\\\\data folder which makes it easy to access. ",
