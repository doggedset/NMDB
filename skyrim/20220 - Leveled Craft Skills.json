  "descriptionHtml": " Sorry for my English.\r\n\r\n\\\"Leveled Craft Skills\\\" is a mod that makes Alchemy, Smithing and Enchanting skills depend on Player level.\r\n\r\nAt Player level < 20 Craft Skills can be 30 max, for further growth Player must reach level 20;\r\n\r\nat Player level 20-29 Craft Skills can be 40 max;\r\n\r\nat Player level 30-39 Craft Skills can be 60 max;\r\n\r\nat Player level 40-49 Craft Skills can be 80 max;\r\n\r\nat Player level 50 all limits removed.\r\n\r\nWhen skill growth limit is reached(appears in magic Effects) teacher\\'s services for limited skill are useless - they take your money, try to teach you, but nothing happens :-)\r\n\r\nIt provides not-too-fast leveling of your character on crafting and challenging gameplay at level 30+. \r\n\r\nAlso, Fortify Alchemy effect is not Restoration-related anymore. For the Great Justice.\r\n\r\nMod doesn\\'t require to start new game, but created especially for low-level characters.\r\n\r\nTested at 1.5.26, no any script extension needed. \r\nNice compatible with other difficulty mods.\r\n\r\nKnown issue - on first run it\\'s good to save the game and load from this save.\r\n\r\nMod is completely safe: on uninstall all effects limiting your skills just disappear - i didn\\'t use any scripting. It\\'s just a magic!",
