  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small modification created in Skyrim NPC Editor that tries to change the appearance of Aela the Huntress NPC, mantaining most of the aspects of her original appearance, but giving her a more womanly look. In-game screenshots were taken along with CBBE and coverwomen. I recommend using both of them for better use.\r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions on how to improve this mod, please leave it in the comments section.\r\nleotgo",
