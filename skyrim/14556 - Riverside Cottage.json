  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a cottage with full blacksmithing equipment excluding\r\na tanning rack. Inside the shack is a player owned bed and chest\r\n(right next to each other) and three followers, each with their own\r\nweapon sets. The followers are equipped with stormcloak armor,\r\nwhich can easily be changed. Mercenary Ranger uses a bow and\r\niron arrows, Mercenary Soldier uses a warhammer, and Mercenary\r\nAxeman uses an axe. I designed this to be used with some sort of\r\n\\\"multiple followers\\\" mod. My personal favorite is simply called\r\n\\\"Multiple Followers\\\" by foobar92. This can be downloaded at\r\nhttp://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1345602-wiprel-multiple-followers/\r\nAs far as I know, this mod does not conflict with any other mod.\r\nThis is my first mod, so PLEASE send me feedback and suggestions\r\nfor addition or fixes.",
