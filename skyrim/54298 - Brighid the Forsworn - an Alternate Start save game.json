  "modName": "Brighid the Forsworn - an Alternate Start save game",
  "summary": "An alternate starting savegame that begins you in Druadach Redoubt or Lost Valley Redoubt.  Be a member of the Forsworn.  The Reach will be ours again&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "You are Forsworn.\r<br />\r<br />You are Brighid, a Breton girl living in the Reach.  Three years ago, your family was killed by corrupt Reach officials.  You were taken in by the Forsworn, and since then you&#39;ve lived among them.  You know no other home.  You have no other allegiance.\r<br />\r<br />-------------\r<br />\r<br />In this savegame:\r<br />\r<br />-- Begin as a member of the Forsworn in either Lost Valley Redoubt or Druadach Redoubt.\r<br />-- Map markers disabled -- you&#39;ll have to uncover Skyrim yourself through exploration.\r<br />-- Slightly more Lore Friendly version starts you with a Bounty in the Reach and a Forsworn hairstyle.  (Unfortunately, I&#39;m not sure how to access the Forsworn warpaints, so I left those off.)\r<br />-- Begin at your own hay pile or bedroll, with a small barrel for your belongings.  (Druadach Redoubt is empty; Lost Valley contains an extra Forsworn Sword, and a pair of Forsworn Gauntlets.)\r<br />-- File was made using only plugins for character creation.\r<br />\r<br />The main quest is disabled, so bear in mind that if you venture to Helgen, things might be a bit interesting.  (To enable the main quest post-Helgen, enter &#34;setstage MQ102 30&#34; into the console.)\r<br />\r<br />Notes:\r<br />\r<br />Download includes both .ess file and .skse file, because Brighid was built with RaceMenu.  If you want her to look like she does in my images, you&#39;ll need:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]RaceMenu[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?]ApachiiSkyHair[/url] (including the 72 standalone female hairs)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49963/?]TrueEyes[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50307/?]TrueBrows[/url]\r<br />\r<br />She&#39;ll load up with darker hair, but once you open up showracemenu, that should fix itself.  (And yes, I see that neck seam I&#39;ve got going on.  I&#39;m gonna fix that one of these days.)\r<br />\r<br />I also have [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7887/?]Pretty Face[/url] installed, but face textures are of course a personal preference.  :)\r<br />\r<br />If you download the save without RaceMenu, she&#39;ll come out a bit strangely, so make sure to use showracemenu to get her looking how you want&#33;\r<br />\r<br />-- Because this is a save file and not an actual mod, this won&#39;t alter the Cidhna Mine quest at all.  Madanach won&#39;t know who you are -- but hey, most of them have been in prison a while; perhaps you simply never ran into each other.\r<br />\r<br />-- I tagged this as NSFW because of the images in the Forsworn armor.  Beyond the images I uploaded, there shouldn&#39;t be any adult content.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />-- Download and unzip into your Skyrim save games&#33;  (Both .ess and .skse file included.)\r<br />-- Please note that this is my first attempt at modding, so let me know if something doesn&#39;t work for you, and I&#39;ll try to fix it&#33;  (Or, you know, delete my files in a panic.  Whichever.)\r<br />\r<br />This mod was very much inspired by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1612719/?]Mshai&#39;s[/url] fabulous alternate start mod, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6951/?]Theanna[/url].",
