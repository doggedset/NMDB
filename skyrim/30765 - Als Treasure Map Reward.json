  "modName": "Als Treasure Map Reward",
  "summary": "This little mod adds a treasure hoard, to reward the completionist player who collects all 11 Treasure Maps and uncovers all of the corresponding treasure chests. Fourth in my Completionist series.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds the cell &#34;Frozen Hoard&#34; to the game, accessible via trapdoor almost right next to the Serpent Doomstone (see pictures for reference). Down the trapdoor is a sealed door, leading to a treasure hoard. However, the sealed door is locked and can only be opened with 11 special keys - the Map Keys. One Map Key is found in each treasure chest pointed to by the 11 Treasure Maps.\r<br />\r<br />For those that don&#39;t already know, there are 11 Treasure Maps in vanilla Skyrim. The Fort Neugrad Treasure Map, and the imaginatively named Treasure Maps I through X. Each map shows an image hinting at the location of a specific treasure chest. It is not possible to find the treasure chests without the maps, because the chests do not appear in the game until you find the corresponding map.\r<br />\r<br />There is no particular reward in the vanilla game for having accomplished the feat of discovering all 11 maps and chests, hence I created this mod. A Map Key is added to each of these chests, as indicated above.\r<br />\r<br />This is the fourth mod in my Completionist series, all meant to reward the serious completionist/collector player.\r<br />\r<br />[b]FAQ[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Q: There is no map marker for the Frozen Hoard&#33;[/i]\r<br />A: You don&#39;t need one. It is almost literally next to the Serpent Stone. See the images for reference.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Q: I have all 11 Map Keys, but the sealed door didn&#39;t open when I activated it&#33;[/i]\r<br />A: Due to the way I handled the script, the first activation of the sealed door, once you have the keys, unlocks it; you will have to activate it AGAIN to actually open it.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Q: Does the treasure inside the Frozen Hoard respawn?[/i]\r<br />A: Yup. Lucky you.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Q: What if I&#39;ve already found some Treasure Maps?[/i]\r<br />A: Shouldn&#39;t make a difference.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Q: What if I&#39;ve already found some of the Treasure Map chests? Will the Map Key be in them if I go back?[/i]\r<br />A: I don&#39;t know, sorry. Feel free to try. If the Map Key doesn&#39;t appear in a Treasure Map chest you&#39;ve already looted, add one via console, searching for &#34;Map Key&#34; with the help command.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]OTHER MODS BY ME[/u]:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Al&#39;s Completionist Series:\r<br />    1.
