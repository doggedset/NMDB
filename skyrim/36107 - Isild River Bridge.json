  "descriptionHtml": "[size=150][center]Isild River Bridge[/center][/size]\r\n[center][i]\\\"Bridges and shores, man. Bridges and shores.\\\"[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nI know what you\\'re thinking. You\\'re thinking: [i]\\\"Huh? What the h*** is the \\'Isild river\\'? There\\'s no \\'Isild river\\' in my map! And a bridge? Why did you put a bridge there? Why a bridge? What is a bridge? Can I eat it?\\\"[/i]. But fear not! For I will explain.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient times of [i]Morrowind[/i]\\'s second expansion, [i]Bloodmoon[/i], there was a river in Solstheim, situated west of the Skaal village: the Isild river. The main point of interest in that river was a bridge: a rock bridge.\r\n\r\nNow, let\\'s get back to [i]Dragonborn[/i] (which is [b]required[/b], btw). Go to the Skaal village, follow the west road, and what do you find? A river. Crossed by a bridge. [i]A simple, crappy, boring, wooden bridge[/i], hanging there like he owns the place. Can an honest, decent man allow such perversion? Of course NOT! That poor river deserved better. It deserved a long, hard, ancient nordic bridge tenderly linking it\\'s shores. So I cracked my knuckles, opened the Creation Kit, and did what had to be done. And this is the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]So... it\\'s just a bridge?[/i]\r\n---------------------------\r\nNo. It\\'s not [i]just[/i] a bridge. It\\'s an Awesome Rock Bridge(tm), put there by yours truly for your visual enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]But... it\\'s still just a bridge[/i]\r\n---------------------------------\r\nLook, it\\'s the only bridge in all of Solstheim. Also, it has the unique honor of being crossed by seven skaal going back home after a hard day of work at the Wind Stone (a scene that only needs someone singing \\\"Heigh-Ho\\\"  to be perfect), so it deserves better. And wooden bridges are meh.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]So no new quests, armors, items, nothing?[/i]\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nNope. Nada. I just wanted a good, honest rock bridge there, and then thought \\\"Eh, why not drop it in the Nexus. Who knows, someone might have had the same thought\\\". If you did, congratulations: enjoy your new bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]Any compatibility problems?[/i]\r\n----------------------------------\r\nNone. The navmesh only needed some slight repositioning, and TES5Edit took care of any unwanted changes. \r\n\r\n\r\n[i]Do you really find these descriptions funny?[/i]\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nYeeah, I\\'m a simple man.",
