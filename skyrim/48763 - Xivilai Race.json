  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][/b][i]NOTE: I am no longer responsible for any issues with this mod, I don't play or mod Skyrim anymore, so please refrain from contacting me if you're having issues with this mod, there are forums for that. And for goodness' sake, do not re-upload this mod to the Steam Workshop or anywhere else without my given permission. Thank you for taking your time reading this.[/i][b][b]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Introduction[/b]\n<br />I am one of the numerous people who has missed the malicious Xivilai from Oblivion. No one has taken the initiative to make such a race for Skyrim, until now. Brace yourselves, now you can finally play as this brute!\n<br />\n<br />This mod aims to bring back Slof's Playable Xivilai from Oblivion to Skyrim, and I wanted to make them look as close to the Oblivion ones as possible.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[i]Xivilai Race:[/i]\n<br />-Racial bonuses and defect such as Daedra Blood as well as an Atronach-like ability, resembling that of the Xivilai from Oblivion.\n<br />-With unarmed damage of 25 points, the Xivilai can tear their enemies apart with their claws.\n<br />-Power to call upon a Clannfear which levels with you up to 100. This power is set to ignore spell absorbtion so casting it won't fail.\n<br />-Tattoo complexions and body tattoo textures made by GendunDrup respective AlienSlof. All the textures included are standalone so installing textures for vanilla races won't affect this race.\n<br />-Three different presets for both genders.\n<br />-15+ different eyecolors from DorkDiva's elf eye mod. You can even choose to be a blind Xivilai.\n<br />-Xivilai apparel (outfit and wig) can be found in one of the rooms in Sleeping Giant Inn, Riverwood. Also craftable.\n<br />-Vampire and Werewolf support\n<br />-New scripts that renders the Atronach doomstone useless for this race. This is to prevent the spell absorbtion from stacking to 100%, making the Xivilai pretty much overpowered but also fully unable to use summon spells.\n<br />\n<br />[i]What's new in 666?[/i]\n<br />-Xivilai can no longer grow facial hair. On the other hand, you can choose between several kinds of horns via the facial hair slider. I don't recommend installing the latest build of this mod if you're playing an existing character. Your Xivi's look might get messed up...\n<br />\n<br />[i]Summon and Mobs:[/i]\n<br />-Conjurable Xivilai. You can buy the spelltome from either Farengar or Phinis.\n<br />-Enemy Xivilai among Dremora mobs, especially if you're playing the Oblivion Realms Series.\n<br />-Xivilai mobs will drop a random apprentice level conjuration  spelltome, including a normal conjurable Clannfear spell. They drop random leveled Dremora weapons as well.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Follower Thrax:[/i]\n<br />This plugin adds a standalone male Xivi follower to the Hall of the Dead in Markarth. He levels with you up to 100. He's melee-oriented, marriagable and always has a smug grin on his face. He also shares the same voicetype as Farkas.\n<br />PS. The nose chain in one of the pictures is not included. Also, you'll need ApachiiHairMale; http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168 \n<br />\n<br /> [i]Follower Shist:[/i]\n<br />Adds a standalone female Xivi follower to the Solitude catacombs. She also levels up to 100 and is also marriagable.. In combat she relies on destruction magic. ApachiiSkyHair required.\n<br />Shist is loosely based on Morella the Cursed; http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19749/\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Skill Bonuses[/b]\n<br />-Twohanded: 15\n<br />-Onehanded: 15\n<br />-Smithing: 10\n<br />-Destruction: 10\n<br />-Conjuration: 10\n<br />-Light Armor: 5\n<br />-Restoration: 5\n<br />\n<br />[b]Required files[/b]\n<br />-Dawnguard\n<br />-Better claws for Beast Races - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/46895/?\n<br />-Any supported body replacers. The main file supports UNP and Sundracon.\n<br />\n<br />For the SOS patch you will need to install Schlongs of Skyrim (Smurf Average version)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Recommended files[/b]\n<br />Alternate Start - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/?\n<br />Subtle Male Skeleton - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34438/?\n<br />RaceMenu - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?\n<br />And mods that add 1h versions of the 2h weapons.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known issues[/b]\n<br />-Characters who have the ability to absorb magicka will fail to cast summon spells most of the time. That's a common issue with self-spells that are not set to ignore spell absorbtion/reflect.\n<br />-Custom armors won't show up on this race unless the ArmorAddon has \"DefaultRace\" highlighted.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Install[/b]\n<br />Extract the desired plugins into your Skyrim folder and enable the plugins in Wrye Bash. If you install the \"Summon and Mobs\" plugin, remember to rebuild your bashed patch.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Mods that adds hair to the elf races should work on the Xivilai.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Tools used[/b]\n<br />GIMP (with .dds plugin)\n<br />Fallout Mod Manager\n<br />Creation Kit\n<br />Wrye Bash\n<br />NifSkope\n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits[/b]\n<br />-Gendundrup for the detailmaps that I altered.\n<br />-Urshi, zzjay and VectorPlexus for the facial/body textures that I modified. Also, thank you bunches Vector for providing me with new mouth meshes with fangs as well as the Atronach doomstone script!\n<br />-xs2reality and WolverineHowlett for the body normalmaps. I just tweaked the male one for more compatibility.\n<br />-DorkDiva for the eyes.\n<br />-TMPhoenix for the RaceCompatibility plugin.\n<br />-b3lisario for fixing the SOS addon from being dirty, thank you!\n<br />-Dogtown1 for the Clannfear resources.\n<br />-nuska for the facial normalmaps and tri's.\n<br />-nao4288 for the femalehead tri.\n<br />-AlienSlof for the tattoo textures that I ported from her Oblivion mod \"Playable Xivilai\".\n<br />-freakyskull516 for coming up with a name for the female follower.\n<br />-Th3Mut4nt for the various howns that I retextured and included here.\n<br />\n<br />The author of Sporty Sexy Map wanted me to link back to their mod from where I used the female body normalmaps, so go check it out; http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13377/?\n<br />.\n<br />\n<br />Don't forget to endorse this mod if you liked it, as all kinds of positive feedback encourages me to keep modding! \n<br />User screenshots are always welcome! :)[/center]",

      "changelogHtml": " V1.0 - Initial release \r<br />V2.0 - Added female support and minor bugfixes \r<br />V3.0 - Managed to add vampire support and set the armor race to default so custom armors should probably work now. No longer requires the &#34;Just For Men&#34; mod. \r<br />Added an optitional plugin with a &#34;Conjure Xivilai&#34; spell. You can buy the spelltome from Farengar. \r<br />V3.5 - Added more eye colors from DorkDivas elf eye mod, changed the female voice to FemaleElfHaughty and fixed HP regen rate. \r<br />V3.9 - Changed the Atronach effect name, fixed decapitated neck parts so they show the right textures. In this version I edited the ARMA for the hands so they rely on the Argonian hand meshes, to give them claws. I coloured the nails black as well. \r<br />V4.5 - Made some skintones work. Slof has given me permission to use her Xiv resources in this mod, such as the outfit. I converted it for UNP so far. \r<br />V5.0 - Fixed the female world model for the outfit. Added more of DorkDivas amazing elf eyes. Changed the impact sound when fighting unarmed as a Xiv. I&#39;ve also uploaded the long awaited SOS patch&#33; \r<br />V5.5 - Gave the males horns from &#34;Slofs Just For Men&#34;-mod, while the females keep their old ones. Added three different presets for both genders. Increased unarmed damage and reach. \r<br />V5.7 - Fixed the non-xivilai complexions displaying the wrong skintone, added new textures to the female horns and made this mod require &#34;Better claws for Beast Races&#34;. \r<br />V5.9 - Fixed an issue with the UNP body texture. Changed the conjuration power to yield a Clannfear instead of Frost Atronach. \r<br />V6.0 - Changed the race description and added a new set of teeth. Added enemy Xiv to the leveled list &#34;LCharDremoraMelee&#34;. \r<br />V6.0.5 - Disabled some Orc related taunts from enemy Xivilai.
