  "descriptionHtml": "[u]Purpose:[/u]\n<br />This mod [b]Adds recipes to craft and temper the Silver Weapons[/b], while also tweaking their numbers a little. Along with [b]re-colouring of the textures[/b], to make them look a little more like actual silver weapons. Increases both their damage and weight. Also, [b]upgraded versions of them become available[/b] through either crafting, or simply finding them in the Temple of the Divines in Solitude.\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />[u]Plain ol' Silver Sword &amp; Greatsword:[/u]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The [b]Silver Sword has been renamed to '[i]Silver Longsword[/i][/b]'[b]'[/b], because that's what this weapon is, the Greatsword's name remains the same.\n<br />\n<br />[*]Their [b]damage is now equal to that of the steel weapons[/b].\n<br />\n<br />[*]They [b]can both be crafted[/b] if one has the [b]Steel Smithing[/b] Perk and [b]improved at the grinding stone[/b] with one Silver Ingot and a Salt Pile.\n<br />\n<br />[/list][i]Salt was once believe to ward of evil spirits, so I decided to stick to that medieval theme. [b]The swords still do as much extra damage to undead and werewolves as they used to[/b] (~20% I believe, I didn't change that).\n<br />\n<br />[/i][u]Regal Silver Longsword &amp; Greatsword:[/u]\n<br />[i]Additional, standalone version of the Silver swords, that does higher damage, but also weighs more.[/i]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Their [b]damage is slightly higher than that of Ebony Weapons [/b]([i]~Daedric[/i]).\n<br />\n<br />[*]They [b]can both be crafted[/b] @ any forge, but require the [b]Ebony Smithing[/b] perk.\n<br />\n<br />[*][b]Can be improved at a grinding stone[/b] with a Silver ingot and a Salt Pile.\n<br />\n<br />[*][b]Can be found[/b] in the upper bedrooms of the [b]Temple of the Divines in Solitude[/b] in [b]'Duvall's Chest'[/b], along with the Old Smith's Journal and an Amulet of Akatosh.\n<br />\n<br />[*]They do [b]additional damage to the Undead[/b] and Werewolves, just like vanilla silver.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[u]Duvall Silver Longsword &amp; Greatsword:[/u]\n<br />[i]Ascended version of the Regal weaponry discussed above. Decorated with glow-maps to radiate with the Holy light of Aetherius.[/i]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Their [b]damage is equal to that of Dragonbone weapons[/b]. Still does extra damage to Undead and Werewolves.\n<br />\n<br />[*]They sport the [b]Dawnbreaker's Enchantment[/b] with a 50% boost in all its effects. I think this one also lasts longer.\n<br />\n<br />[*]They [b]can be crafted only @ the Skyforge[/b] in Whiterun. Crafting these weapons requires the Regal version, plus one amulet from each of the Divines ([i]9 in total: Akatosh, Arkay, Mara, Dibella, Stendarr, Julianos, Zenithar, Kynareth and Talos[/i]). It has [b]no Smithing perk requirements[/b].\n<br />[/list]\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />[u]Requirements:[/u]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Skyrim.esm\n<br />\n<br />[*]Update.esp\n<br />\n<br />[/list]([i]Essencially just base Skyrim, not even the DLC.[/i])\n<br />\n<br />[u]File Options:[/u]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*][b]Plain ol' Silver [/b]- The base file that has only the tweaks and recolouring regarding the Silver Sword and Greatsword. This file DOES NOT add the Regal and Duvall versions of the weapons.\n<br />\n<br />[*][b]Grossly Incandescent [/b]- This Version adds the Regal and Duvall swords to the game, along with everything else connected to them. In this version the Duvall weaponry glows more.\n<br />\n<br />[*][b]Humbly Radiant -[/b] This Version adds the Regal and Duvall swords to the game, along with everything else connected to them. In this version the Duvall weaponry glows less.\n<br />\n<br />[/list][i]All the files are independent, just make sure you don't use the Grossly Incandescent and Humbly Radiant files together, 'cause they cancel each other out. All textures are 1k in resolution.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[u]Known Issues:[/u]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Due to the Duvall variant requiring 10 items to be forged the letter become far too small to see when you try and make out what materials you need. Just keep in mind you just need one Regal sword and one amulet for each of the Divines.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[u]Installation/Unistallation:[/u]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]You can either just toss it into your data folder and remove it when you don't want it, by deleting its files. Or, just be on the same side and use any manager you want.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[u]Credits:[/u]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Leanwolf's [b]Better shaped weapons[/b]. I used the Meshes for the Regal and Duvall weapons.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]        https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39870\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />Video Presentation of the Mod:\n<br />[youtube]x7wdy_kZIpw[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />I think that covers it. Ask me if you have any questions, but I think I covered everything. Enjoy!! :D",
