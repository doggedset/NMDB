  "summary": "This changes the Daedric Armor (Boots, Gauntlets, chest armor etc etc) into  a really HD quality textures and Normal Mapping without any resolution changes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "(warning for grammer fails due to my swedish nature lol)\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I have now added the Final version of this mod, but if you have any useful tips or some ideas on improvements or some request on an armor or clothing that needs to be improved, feel free to ask ;)\r\nUPDATE2:THe readme file in the latest version is outdated, so dont be confused with it.\r\n\r\nThis changes the Daedric Armor (Boots, Gauntlets, chest armor etc etc) into  a qrisper quality textures and Normal Mapping. While i love Skyrim as it is, i was a bit disabointed in some textures that they are low res textures on my favorite armor sets (due to the console ports), so i thought that why not make some retexturing and normal map and spectacular mapping improvements with little to zero fps hit. No resolution changes.\r\n\r\nSo what do you get in this mod? Well look below\r\n\r\n1:A Highly detailed Daedric Armor set that fully supports all computers\r\n\r\n2:Unlike other graphic mods that requires more RAM or Processor Power, this mod requires just as much or even less power, so even low end computers can enjoy it.\r\n\r\nI have ofcorse a long way to go with texturing, so the first versions will look bad at first.\r\n\r\nI have to thank pomop for his constructive comment, so i did some improvement from the last upload, while other comments underneath his sould be ignored for now, since they where talking about my older version.\r\nI take critics, not insults lol\r\n\r\n-----Installation------\r\n\r\nPlace the Textures folder into your Skyrim game folder, or let your Nexus Mod Manager fix it for you.\r\n\r\nFor unistalling, use the Nexus Mod Manager or just delete the Daedric folder inside \\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\ folder\r\n------\r\n\r\nThis mod dont pleases everyone, so if you personaly dont like it, well that is what you think of it, if you like it, thanks. Everyone has their opinions and the mod suits for not all gamers.\r\n\r\nWhile i did voicepacks in the past, i found that making HD textures and Normal Mappings is my specialty, and alot more fun too. So if you like this texture mod, i can make more armor retextures in the future ;)",
