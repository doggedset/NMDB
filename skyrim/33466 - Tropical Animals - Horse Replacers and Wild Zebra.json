  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is best when used with Soolie&#39;s Tropical Skyrim Climate Overhaul (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33017).\r<br />\r<br />[b]UPDATES:[/b]\r<br />3/17/2013 - version 1.01 (see change log for details)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]- - Z E B R A S - -[/center]\r<br />\r<br />This mod replaces all of the horses in the game with appropriately tropical variants. It also places 4 herds of zebra around the tundra between Whiterun and Rorikstead. \r<br />\r<br />If you just want the replace the horses without adding the wild herds, there is an optional file that does just that&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[center]- - H E R D S - -[/center]\r<br />\r<br />As mentioned, there are 4 herds in the worldspace. They are:\r<br />\r<br />1 - Between Pelagia Farm and the Western Watchtower (where you fight Mirmulnir). \r<br />\r<br />2 - A little ways south of Hamvir&#39;s Rest, off the road between Greenspring Hollow and Dustman&#39;s Cairn.\r<br />\r<br />3 - On a hill above Swindler&#39;s Den, northeast-ish.\r<br />\r<br />4 - On the plains near Sleeping Tree Camp.\r<br />\r<br />Herds consist of a stallion, some males, females, and foals. Stallions are aggressive by nature, and males will assist while the females and foals run away. \r<br />\r<br />They drop horse hides & meat, as I did not want to introduce a bunch of new ingredients. If that bothers you - don&#39;t kill them&#33; There is an option for the stallions to be set as &#34;protected&#34; \r<br />so they have a better chance of protecting their herd from predators, but you (the player) \r<br />can still kill them.\r<br />\r<br />[center]- - R E P L A C E R S - -[/center]\r<br />\r<br />All of the textures from AlienSlof are mares. Which means that even though Frost and the zebra stallions are supposed to be male, they are not anatomically correct. I did this because I did not want to add Slof&#39;s male meshes (for reasons I will explain further down). \r<br />\r<br />All horses have black manes and tails.\r<br />\r<br />WINDHELM: Grulla Zorse \r<br />This will also replace all the horses the carriage drivers use.\r<br />\r<br />WHITERUN: Zebra\r<br />Shadowmere may also possibly resemble a zebra: I have not checked. If anyone could confirm/deny this that would be great.\r<br />\r<br />RIFTEN: Greyish Grulla\r<br />\r<br />MARKARTH: Brownish Grulla\r<br />The horses for Riften and Markarth may look similar, but I promise you they are different textures&#33;\r<br />\r<br />SOLITUDE: Dark Bay\r<br />Frost will also resemble a black horse. I labored over this and ultimately decided that I wanted Solitude (which looks very Spanish with Tropical Skyrim) to have black horses more than I cared about Frost.\r<br />\r<br />I highly recommend downloading a SLIMMING HORSE MESH. The current Skyrim horses look odd as zebras. I am still testing to see which one I like best, when I make a decision I will link it here for you :)\r<br />\r<br />[center]- - K N O W N  I S S U E S - -[/center]\r<br />\r<br />* As previously stated, all horses are FEMALE. I did not want to deal with the unique meshes for the zebra stallions and Frost, because I prefer them to be slim rather than anatomically correct&#33; \r<br />\r<br />* All horses have black manes/tails. INCLUDING THE ZEBRA. Yes, I know that zebras have stripey manes/tails, but because of the way the meshes are, the hair flops down & I find that the stripes look emo rather than zebra. I erred on the side of aesthetics and went with black.\r<br />\r<br />* AlienSlof&#39;s textures have HORSESHOES. There is nothing I will do about this as I will not be editing her textures. If anyone wants to retexture a new zebra without horseshoes, I will add it instead of Slof&#39;s version. I will say, however, that I did not include her normal map (I used Bethesda&#39;s) so the horseshoes are not bumped.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If there are any issues PLEASE let me know&#33; I will be happy to fix them. I hope you enjoy this mod as much as I do :) Thank you all very much.",
