Intensive graphical effects such as depth-of-field, ambient occlusion and sub-surface scattering are disabled by default to increase performance on your machine. In addition, this ENB makes use of ZeroKing’s Shader Addon to include extra vibrancy, contrast and black-level in your game without the need for SweetFX. \r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/57690-2-1409458681.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=3]INSTALLATION[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />First things first - which type of ENB do you want to use: [b]Wrapper[/b], or [b]Injector[/b]? In most cases, the wrapper version is recommended. However, if you are using a laptop that has Optimus technology (like me), you will have to use the injector version. The injector version of ENB is practically identical to the wrapper version, but you will have to run the ENBInjector.exe in the background whilst playing Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />1. Download ENBSeries from [url=http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.html]http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.html[/url] (the newer, the better) and extract the zip file somewhere.\r<br />2a. [i](FOR THE WRAPPER VERSION)[/i] Copy over the [b]d3d9.dll[/b] and [b]enbhost.exe[/b] files from the wrapper folder to your [b]&#92;Steam&#92;SteamApps&#92;Common&#92;Skyrim[/b] folder.\r<br />2b. [i](FOR THE INJECTOR VERSION)[/i] Copy over the [b]enbhost.exe[/b], [b]ENBInjector.exe[/b] and [b]enbseries.dll[/b] files from the injector folder to your [b]&#92;Steam&#92;SteamApps&#92;Common&#92;Skyrim[/b] folder. Remember to run the [b]ENBInjector.exe[/b] in the background when you’re playing Skyrim for ENB to work. \r<br />3. Extract the files from the Queensland ENB archive somewhere.\r<br />4. Copy over all the files from the extracted Queensland ENB archive to [b]&#92;Steam&#92;SteamApps&#92;Common&#92;Skyrim[/b].\r<br />5. Follow the instructions in SETTINGS below. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=3]SETTINGS[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />There are a few settings you have to disable for Skyrim to run with an ENB properly. \r<br />\r<br />First, in your [b]SkyrimPrefs.ini[/b] file (found in &#92;Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim) edit the following…\r<br />\r<br />[b][Imagespace][/b]\r<br />[b]bDoDepthOfField=0[/b] [i](Removes Skyrim’s depth of field effect, since it is not used. Enable if you want the underwater blur to work at the cost of some performance.)[/i]\r<br />[b][Display][/b]\r<br />[b]bFloatPointRenderTarget=1[/b] [i](Required for various ENB effects to function.)[/i]\r<br />[b]bTreesReceiveShadows=1[/b] [i](The trees will have shadows. Recommended to be enabled, but if you need extra performance, disable it.)[/i]\r<br />[b]bDrawLandShadows=1[/b] [i](The landscape will have shadows. Disable if you want more performance.)[/i]\r<br />[b]bShadowsOnGrass=1[/b] [i](The grass will have shadows. Recommended to be enabled, but if you need extra performance, disable it.)[/i]\r<br />[b]iMultiSample=0[/b] [i](Disables Skyrim’s MSAA, which is incompatible with ENB.)[/i]\r<br />[b]iMaxAnisotropy=0 [/b][i](Disables Skyrim’s anisotropic filtering, which is already included in ENB.)[/i]\r<br />[b]bFXAAEnabled=0[/b] [i](Disables Skyrim’s FXAA. Enable if you want better edges with a slight performance hit.)[/i]\r<br />[b]iPresentInterval=0[/b] [i](Disables Skyrim’s VSync, which is already included in this ENB. If you experience screen tearing in-game, set this value to 1.)[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Now you must edit the [b]effect.txt[/b] file in your &#92;Steam&#92;SteamApps&#92;Common&#92;Skyrim folder.\r<br />\r<br />Change the parameters of screen resolution to that of your screen resolution. By default it is \r<br />[b]&gt; = {1600};[/b] for width and \r<br />[b]&gt; = {900};[/b] for height.\r<br />This isn’t completely necessary but it is better to have it correct than not, right?\r<br />\r<br />Finally, you should tweak the in-game brightness settings until you find a setting you like. I generally prefer having the slider on the left side, but others may like brighter settings. \r<br />\r<br />Your game is now tweaked to work with the Queensland ENB&#33; Below is a list of recommended mods that can enhance your game’s graphics – feel free to check them out. \r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/57690-3-1409458681.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=3]RECOMMENDED GRAPHIC MODS[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />In order to make your game look like mine, install the following mods in this order. All mods can be found on the Skyrim Nexus.\r<br />\r<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17802/?]Climates of Tamriel[/url][/b] [i](Highly recommended&#33; This mod overhauls the weather of Skyrim. This ENB was built around Climates of Tamriel and may look different without it.)[/i]\r<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/141/?]Skyrim Flora Overhaul[/url][/b] [i](Overhauls nature with new meshes and textures that make the wilderness feel more alive.)[/i]\r<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/607/?]Skyrim HD – 2k Textures[/url][/b] [i](Replaces many of the default, ugly textures in Skyrim with brand new ones.)[/i]\r<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1111/?]Pure Waters[/url][/b] [i](Overhauls the water in Skyrim.)[/i]\r<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/46925/?]Tamriel Reloaded – Textures and Parallax[/url][/b] [i](A great texture pack that affects landscape, grass and architecture. The parallax adds more depth to the game.)[/i]\r<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56877/?]Skysight – Simply Bigger Trees[/url][/b] [i](Increases the size of all trees in Skyrim. This mod really adds to the fantasy feel of the game.)[/i]\r<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51750/?]Weather Control Centre[/url] [/b][i](Allows you to force weather from Climates of Tamriel (amongst others) using the MCM menu. Very useful for making the game utilise clear weather more often&#33;)[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=3]FAQ[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]My game looks really bland compared to your screenshots. Any idea why?[/b]\r<br />All my screenshots were taken in “clear” weather from Climates of Tamriel. For some reason, it is actually very, very rare to get clear weather when playing the game. This is why I recommend the Weather Control Centre mod - it will allow you to force clear weather through the MCM menu, and enjoy graphics like in my screenshots. \r<br /> \r<br />[b]Why is there no SMAA?[/b]\r<br />SMAA did not work with my laptop, so I didn’t include it. You can simply drop the SMAA files into your Skyrim directory and it will work, however. \r<br /> \r<br />[b]Why didn’t you include SweetFX?[/b]\r<br />Because my laptop doesn’t work with SweetFX, which is the main reason I made this ENB without it. \r<br /> \r<br />[b]How do I remove the blur? [/b]\r<br />Go into [b]effect.txt [/b]file in your &#92;Steam&#92;SteamApps&#92;Common&#92;Skyrim folder, and adjust Blur Sampling Range. By default it is set to 0.75, and the value can be set between 0 and 1.\r<br /> \r<br />[b]The game is too saturated. How do I reduce this?[/b]\r<br />Go into [b]effect.txt [/b]file in your &#92;Steam&#92;SteamApps&#92;Common&#92;Skyrim folder, and adjust the Vibrance settings. By default they are all set to 0.5, and the value can be set between 0 and 1. \r<br />\r<br />[b]The shadows have lots of pixel-y dots. How do I fix this?\r<br />[/b]Your current shadow settings are the culprit. See my current shadow settings in the description for shadows as you see them in the screenshots, or look for some shadow settings online elsewhere to use. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Skyrim is way too dark when I enable Ambient Occlusion. How can I fix this?[/b]\r<br />Turn the in-game brightness up a little bit.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/57690-4-1409458681.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=3]CHANGELOG[/size][/b][/u]\r<br /> \r<br />v1c: Increased bloom again, reduced ambient occlusion (these two things are my bane, honestly...)\r<br />v1b: Reduced bloom, tweaked ambient occlusion, tweaked adaption\r<br />v1a: Fixed ambient occlusion. \r<br />v1: Initial release. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=3]CREDITS[/size][/b][/u]\r<br /> \r<br />-Boris Vorontsov for creating ENB\r<br />-Matso for the depth of field, bloom and anamorphic lens effects\r<br />-Xilandro for his Blackout ENB for New Vegas, of which this ENB is based upon\r<br />-ZeroKing for his Shader Addons for ENB, of which adds much life to the ENB\r<br />-Bethesda for Skyrim (obviously)",
