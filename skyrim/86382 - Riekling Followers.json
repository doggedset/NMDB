They will appear in raven rock on solstheim. \r<br />\r<br />There will be a melee and a ranged type of follower. If you want to use both you will need a follower mod that allows you to have more than one follower, like amazing follower tweaks.\r<br />\r<br />So one favors melee and one favors range.\r<br />\r<br />Reesaiski - Is the blue riekling melee user. He will have a summon riekling range spell for him to cast.\r<br />\r<br />Kittaiski - is the purple riekling ranged user.Â He will have a summon riekling melee spell for him to cast.\r<br />\r<br />They both will come with riekling spear that they can shot out their hands they may or may not use a shout that makes their weapons attack faster and make their allies weapons first.\r<br />\r<br />They will spawn with random riekling gear i created for them. They armor and weapons will be random, you can also give them different gear if you want.\r<br />\r<br />There a locked strongbox in the back the riekling chiefs throne that contains all the assets that was created with playable rieklings if you want to give them different gear you have to go there. i only created armor that shows skin as the riekling is a creature with different skin texture compared to the humans. so wearing human armor that shows skin will look odd.\r<br />\r<br />The only backstories i can come up with is they are brothers i guess and they are named after candy lol.\r<br />\r<br />There will be two versions of the mod. One is a little esp that requires playable rieklings to work. and the other is a standalone version that does not requires playable rieklings.\r<br />\r<br />Heres a video of the mod. -\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]a7eQMAqya-E[/youtube]",
