  "descriptionHtml": "++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\nSKYRIM - ALTERNATE REALITY SAVEGAME\r\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nNOTE: THIS FILE HAS BEEN SUPERCEDED BY THE FOLLOWING FILE:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10929\r\n\r\n============\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n============\r\nYou are a poor middle-aged nord named Dovahkiin, who has just arrived by boat at the small northern village of Dawnstar.\r\n\r\nPenniless and under-fed, you possess nothing but the ragged clothes on your back and a strong will to survive. Where you go and how you live is up to you. Do you seek adventure, wherever it lies, or do you live the quiet life, minding your own business? Will you become a strong warrior or a powerful mage? A married family man, earning an honest wage, or a sneaking thief, simply stealing everything you desire?\r\n\r\nWhichever path you choose, you will start from the very bottom with absolutely nothing and have to slowly work your way up. Good luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n======\r\nNOTES\r\n======\r\nThis is an alternate start for the game and is really designed for hard-core roleplayers who wish to simply \\'live another life in another world\\' and do not wish to take part in the main quest at all. You will note that your journal contains no active quests and will remain that way until you start one of your own choice. Because of this, certain main quest related locations will remain closed off to you, such as High Hrothgar and you\\'ll never encounter any dragons, so remember, any word walls you discover will serve no purpose because in this alternate reality, you are not destined to become dragonborn and will therefore have no dragon shouts.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of immersion, all map markers are disabled in this savegame until you discover them for yourself.\r\n\r\nIf however you decide at some point that you do wish to do the main quest, see the instructions below.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a \\'clean\\' savegame made on a vanilla install. No mods/plugins were loaded when it was made.\r\n\r\n=============\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n=============\r\nSimply extract and place the save file in the following location:\r\n\r\n\tWINDOWS 7 or VISTA = C:\\\\Users\\\\[UserName]\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves\r\n\r\n\tWINDOWS XP = C:\\\\My Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves\r\n\r\nand load it up in-game.\r\n\r\n=========================\r\nSTARTING THE MAIN QUEST\r\n=========================\r\nIf you wish to embark on the main quest, open the console and type:\r\n\r\n\tsetstage MQ102 30\r\n\r\nThis will instruct you to head to the Jarl of Whiterun with news of the dragon attack at Helgen. The quest *should* run as normal from this point forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nStannieDum\r\n9 January 2012",
