  "descriptionHtml": "This adds a house to Ivarstead. The house is named Fairview. It has an anvil, workbench and alchemy station and cooking pot. It has a few chests and a bed. The house needs a key which you can buy from a new NPC named Josselyn in the inn in Ivarstead for 8000 gold. The new NPC uses a computer voice cause I don\\'t have a mic and I wasn\\'t going to use my voice anyways for her voice so if you want to do voice acting for it PM me. \r\n\r\ncheck out my Dawnstar house also:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8178",
