  "summary": "Adds the Kothringi, a playable lore-friendly race of silver-skinned humanoids from Argonia.",
  "descriptionHtml": "From the UESP:\r\n\r\nThe Kothringi are a silver-skinned tribal people indigenous to Black Marsh. Once considered the only humans native to Tamriel, they are now known to have shared the continent with many other tribal groups. The last of the Kothringi were supposedly killed by the plague that was unleashed from Thras.\r\nLittle detail is known about the Kothringi. They generally preferred to go naked, although a few wore clothes when outside their native land. They appear to have worshipped a god named Z\\'en, a God of Toil, as well as Mara. The Empress Tavia, wife of Reman III, the last ruler of the Reman Dynasty, had a Kothringi knight named Zuuk with whom she conspired to assassinate her husband.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds the Kothringi as a playable race, both Male and Female. Comes with unique racial stats, abilities and appearance.\r\n\r\nThis mod uses color forms for the skin tone, so it will be compatible with all body mods.\r\n\r\nSidenote: If you like the mod, please upload pictures of your character, my computer can barely run Skyrim and all my pictures turn out nasty, so help a brotha out!",
