  "descriptionHtml": "Saga Koppen is my NPC and follower version of my main Skyrim save. Saga is a battle mage, specialising in destruction magic. Though she also casts frost and shock magic, her strong suit is her fire spells of which she can cast master level spells. She also has some skills within conjuration, restoration, alteration and illusion, though these are more limited.\r\nShe can be found in the Hall of the Elements at the College of Winterhold.\r\nShe starts out at level 50, and will level up with the player.\r\n\r\nFrom what I gather, she doesnâ€™t appear before finishing the College main quest (due to the entire area developing into a battleground before this quest is completed).\r\n\r\nIf there are any problems let me know and I will see if I can fix it.\r\n\r\nYou don\\'t need any of the add-ons but you may need the hair mod:\r\nHair by Apachii: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\nFor anyone who may be wondering, the robes are part of a comprehensive clothing retexture mod which is not required.
