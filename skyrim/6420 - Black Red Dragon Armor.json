  "descriptionHtml": "Introdoction:\r\nI couldn\\'t find a Dragonbone Armor mod that I liked so I decided to make my own.  This being my very 1st mod ever, I wanted to make sure that it was possible to do in real life.  So I researched the topic of dyeing bones.  I found this article:\r\nhttp://www.ehow.com/how_7202756_dye-bone.html.  \r\nIn part it says you can make a natural black dye using water, tannins and iron. \r\nAlso Alizarin has been used throught history as a Red dye.  In fact it was the use of Alizarin by the British that lead to their Army getting the name of Red Coats.  So yes it can be quite a striking Red color.  Here is a link to a page about Alizarin if you wish to read more about it:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alizarin      \r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n1.2 Added Dragonscale Armor both Male and Female\r\n1.1.1 Fixed download with Nexus Mod Manager problem\r\n1.1 added Female Dragonplate Armor\r\n1.0 only hase the Male Dragonbone Armor and Shield. \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nThis can be installed with the Nexus Mod manager or Manually by extracting the files then dragging the Data folder to your game directory.\r\n\r\nManual Uninstall:\r\nDelete the Dragonbone folder in your texture folder.\r\nDelete the Dragonscale folder in your texture folder.\r\n\r\nSince this is my very 1st mod comments and/or suggestions are welcome.\r\n",
