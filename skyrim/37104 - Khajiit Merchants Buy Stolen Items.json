  "descriptionHtml": "A simple mod that allows Khajiit merchants to buy stolen items from you. By default, the three Khajiit merchants will allow you to sell stolen goods after you do a certain Thieves Guild quest or if you have the Fence perk from Speechcraft. This mod basically removes the any requirement for you to sell stolen items to the Khajiit Caravans. The reason behind this mod being the rare amount of merchants that can deal stolen goods with you, unless you invest on the Speechcraft skill tree (which I\\'m sure most of you don\\'t), and those who prefer not having to join the Thieves Guild for the sake of selling some items.\r\n\r\nHere\\'s a short video preview by SaioTV (Why a simple mod like this needs a video? Well why the **** not?)\r\n[youtube]qMXCaHMeXho[/youtube]\r\nThank you so much for the video Saiodin!\r\n\r\n[b]=== INSTALLATION ===[/b]\r\nUse any mod manager like NMM or just manually extract the files into Skyrim\\'s Data folder. If you manual installed, don\\'t forget to tick/activate the esp before starting the game.\r\n\r\n[b]=== UNINSTALLATION ===[/b]\r\nRemove or delete Khajiit Merchants Buy Stolen Items.esp\r\n\r\n[b]=== LOAD ORDER ===[/b]\r\nAnywhere will work.\r\n\r\n[b]=== COMPATIBILITY ===[/b]\r\nNot compatible with anything that changes the the three Khajiit Caravan merchants (Ri\\'saad, Ahkari, and Ma\\'dran).",
