  "descriptionHtml": "===============\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis mod REQUIRES DAWNGUARD due to the use of husky & armor textures and meshes.\r\n\r\n===============\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple mod I made for myself and thought I\\'d share to see if anyone else liked it.\r\n\r\nMeeko is now a German Shepherd-like dog breed and built for war (using Kitty\\'eh\\'s wonderful texture <http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=88230647>, used with permission--THANK YOU Kitty\\'eh!). He can be found in his shack, ready to help you take on Skyrim.\r\n\r\n===============\r\nNOTABLE FEATURES\r\n===============\r\n\r\n1. BASIC ABILITIES --\r\n\r\n      A. He is now essential\r\n      B. Levels from 5 to 60 (to be helpful but not overwhelming at all levels of play).\r\n      C. Has the Lightfoot and Muffle perks.\r\n      D. Does not take up an animal follower slot (so you can bring along an Armored Troll, too).\r\n\r\n2. REMOVABLE ARMOR --\r\n \r\nMeeko\\'s armor can be worn and removed using dialogue commands with Meeko.  When the armor is worn, Meeko\\'s damage resistance and unarmed damage are higher (Meeko\\'s damage resistance is a function of his skill in Heavy Armor, just like yours).  When the armor is removed, Meeko is unaggressive and will not attack unless attacked.\r\n\r\n3. GIVE A DOG A HOME FUNCTIONALITY --\r\n\r\nThis mod include the full functionality of the \\\"Give a Dog a Home\\\" mod by Luthrael (see <http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11789>, used with permission--THANK YOU Luthrael!).  So you can keep Meeko wherever you want.\r\n\r\n4. THE DOG WHISTLE\r\n\r\nThis mod includes a \\\"Dog Whistle\\\" voice power that allows you to summon Meeko from anywhere at any time.  The power is received by reading the journal in Meeko\\'s shack WHEN YOU ARE NEAR MEEKO (if you read the book before you see him, it doesn\\'t work).  The Dog Whistle essentially act as the \\\"come here, boy\\\" command and has a number of functions and uses:\r\n      A. If within sight (or nearby), he will disengage from combat and run to you.\r\n      B. If far away, he will teleport to a hidden spot and run up to you.\r\n      C. The dog whistle will bring him back under your control if you damage him too much and he starts attacking you.\r\n\r\n===============\r\nOPTIONAL FILE\r\n===============\r\n\r\nI have uploaded an optional file that changes Meeko\\'s name to Havoc (Havoc the War Dog, Havoc\\'s Shack, etc.) for those that want a more aggressive-sounding name. There are no other mechanical differences from the main file other than this change (in fact, all internal game references still use \\\"meeko\\\" to keep the mod\\'s footprint small).\r\n\r\n===============\r\nUPCOMING CHANGES\r\n===============\r\n\r\nI\\'m currently working on giving the dog a hunt or scout command that allows him to roam in the immediate area attacking any enemies or prey (rabbits & chickens).  Unfortunately, I am new to modding (or programming in general) and may need to re-write peices to make this work.  It could be a while.\r\n\r\nI am a novice modder, so all questions, testing and criticism are welcomed.\r\n\r\n===============\r\nTROUBLESHOOTING\r\n===============\r\n\r\nIf you already have Meeko, dismiss him before installing or you will be unable to hire another animal companion and Meeko will be \\\"stuck\\\" in the old follower system (this mod uses a special follower system for Meeko). Also, you will need to give yourself the \\\"Dog Whistle\\\" power using \\\"player.addspell\\\" in the console.",
