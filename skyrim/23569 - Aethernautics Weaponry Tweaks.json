  "summary": "Reworks the harquebuses (rifles) from Trainwiz\\'s Aethernautics mod. Redesigns the rifles, shortens the barrels so they don\\'t overlap the crosshair, decreases volume of gunshots so they aren\\'t earsplitting, and lowers base damage to be more friendly with SkyRe/DDArmory/other mods. Full install or modular available.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#ff3300][b]REQUIRES DAWNGUARD AND AETHERNAUTICS - A SPACE TRAVEL MOD[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23260]Aethernautics by Trainwiz[/url]\r\n\r\nI loved Trainwiz\\'s project \\\"Aethernautics - A Space Travel Mod\\\" the instant I saw it on the front page of the Nexus, \r\nand only loved it more as I went through the awesome quest he had laid out. \r\nThe only gripe I had was in the functionality of the harquebuses themselves: \r\nthey overlapped the crosshair slightly in first person view, \r\nthe blast sound was incredibly loud, \r\nand the damage was ridiculously high (for myself). \r\nPart of this is because the original Dwemer Rifle author Mahty also had these problems.\r\n\r\n[color=#ffff00][b][FUTURE PLANS][/b][/color]\r\nI\\'m currently working on a mod (just in the planning stages at the moment) to expand upon the story and faction in [i]Aethernautics[/i] with a new questline. \r\nPart 1 of this will deal with first being hunted by the Cronographers, then eventually joining their ranks. \r\nThe end of this quest will give the player access to a few new types of rifles and be left open for further missions with the Cronographers through time.\r\nPlanned features [need permissions for some of these to happen]:\r\n\r\n <-> 5+ new harquebuses (Corrosive [Poisonous] and Ruinous [Sniper/Stealth] completed so far)\r\n <-> Possibly 1 or 2 weaker semi-auto rifles (based off of the Semi-Auto Crossbow mod)\r\n <-> A few pairs of pistols (based off of the 1-handed Crossbow mod)\r\n <-> Bullets, varying types (may use another author\\'s bullets, may make my own)\r\n <-> Cronographer fortress on Sotha Sil (mission hub for further expansions)\r\n <-> Scripted quest (much like the original [i]Aethernautics[/i], maybe some voiceacting)\r\n\r\nAgain, I\\'m new to modding so figuring how to do all this myself (and actually doing it) could take quite a while, so if there are any modders out there with experience with any of the above, please feel free to help out if you feel like being generous.\r\n\r\n[color=#ff3300][b][0.3b Heavy Harquebus Alternate][/b][/color] \r\nAdding an optional file for a new Heavy Harquebus mesh tweak. \r\nBrings the Centurion-core sphere back so it appears as if it rests in the player\\'s hand,\r\nand isn\\'t floating in the middle of the rifle.\r\n(It looks like it would be very hard to hold it very up with a bunch of weight towards the front of the gun) \r\nTop and bottom struts brought back slightly to flow with changes to sphere.\r\nSorry, just can\\'t help messing with the rifles when I get an idea, \r\nthats why this is just an optional file right now\r\nI\\'ll have a screen shot up soon. If enough people ask me to, I\\'ll include this variant in the next full update.\r\n[color=#ff3300][b][0.3a HOTFIX][/b][/color] \r\nRemoves the \\\"Charge bar\\\" from the Ohmic and Magmatic Harquebuses. \r\nIn 0.3 release the enchantments continued to work without charges (as intended in the original Aethernautics), \r\nbut both rifles still had a charge bar which was unnecessary. \r\nNeither Ohmic or Magmatic are enchantable a second time, though the Heavy Harquebus is \r\n(since it\\'s effect merely increases stagger chance, \r\ninstead of having an actual enchantment assigned to it)\r\n\r\n[color=#ffff00][font=\\\"Futura\\\"][b][VERSION 0.3][/b][/font][/color] \r\nTweaked a few meshes to reduce hand clipping, \r\nreduced the volume of the main gunshot (not the Aetherial zap) a bit more, \r\nand fixed the missing enchantment on the Magmatic Harquebus. \r\n[NOTE: In this version both Ohmic and Magmatic rifles have a charge bar, use 0.3a HOTFIX to remove these]\r\n\r\n[b][color=#FFFF00]WHAT THIS MOD DOES:[/color][/b]\r\nThis mod has done 3 things: \r\nReworked the models on the rifles to make them shorter as well as re-positioning some elements,\r\nreduced the volume of the blast/zap of firing, \r\nand lowered the base damage of each harquebus \r\n(they are all stronger than Dwarven Crossbows by 6-10 points, making them not so OP at high level/with other mods)\r\n\r\nMost of the new harquebuses have been redesigned (no new elements, just moved around) \r\nand all of them have had the barrels adjusted back so they no longer overlap the crosshair. \r\nAccording to Trainwiz, harquebuses are supposed to have extremely long barrels, \r\nbut I felt that the functionality and looks of the rifles should be more important \r\nthan having them perfectly represent a certain type of rifle from our own history. \r\nIn the future I may include a version that purely re-adjusts the barrels with no other changes to Trainwiz\\'s original designs.\r\n\r\nThere is a full version which includes the ESP (for damage adjustments) as well as the new designs and sounds. \r\nOnce installed, you may want to make sure there is a folder called \\\"aether\\\" in both your Meshes and Sound\\\\fx folders containing relevant files. \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t want all 3 adjustments, \r\neach one has been split into it\\'s own file which you must manually download and install into your main Skyrim directory.\r\n(For example, if you wanted just the rifle redesigns and the sound adjustment, \r\ndownload the meshes and the sounds and not the ESP. \r\nThe ESP is the file that contains the damage information.) \r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00][b]Concerning the damage adjustment:[/b][/color] \r\nI do play with both SkyRe and Deadly Dragons on \r\n(which, at the moment, both contribute a significant amount to archery dmg% from armor and perks), \r\nbut the base damage increase from Dwarven Crossbow --> Harquebus (basic) was 2x as much (22 to 44), \r\nleading to a significant gap in damage once the boosts were applied. \r\nFor example, my Dwarven Recurve Crossbow (Flawless) was doing 89 damage, while my basic Harquebus (Flawless) did ~180 damage. \r\nI just felt the damage difference was too high, and decided to adjust it down on my own. \r\nIf you don\\'t like this change, then just install only the meshes and sounds from the optional files.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#FFFF00]INSTALL:[/color][/b]\r\n\r\n[b][color=#FF9900]NMM:[/color][/b] \r\nJust click the button, activate the mod in the Mods tab. \r\n[b][color=#00FF00]Manual:[/color][/b] \r\nOpen the RAR file, place the \\\"Data\\\" folder into your main Skyrim directory (the one with the Data folder and Skyrim.exe). \r\nIf updating, replace the files. \r\n\r\nIf you chose a version with the damage adjustments, make sure the Aethernautics Weaponry Tweaks.esp is active\r\nand loaded AFTER the original Aethernautics.esp.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, remove the Aethernautics Weaponry Tweaks.esp file\r\nand the \\\"aether\\\" folder from the \\\"Meshes\\\" and \\\"Sound/fx\\\" folders (found within Skyrim\\\\Data), respectively. \r\n\r\n[b][color=#FFFF00]PERMISSIONS:[/color][/b] \r\nAnyone can edit/add-on to this mod as long as they include me in the credits if they have worked off of my mod.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#FFFF00]THANK YOU:[/color][/b]\r\nTrainwiz: \r\nFor the Aethernautics mod which includes all of the original harquebus designs, \r\nbased off of mahty\\'s, which I have modified for personal preference\r\n\r\nMahty: \r\nFor the original Dwemer Rifle design. \r\nIf you read this, know that much of this work would be impossible without the work you\\'ve done.\r\n\r\nBethesda: \r\nFor creating an incredible world which is just open-ended enough \r\nso that people can take on their own interpretations of it and create such wonderful mods as these. \r\n[/center]",
