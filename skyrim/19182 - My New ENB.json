  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first ever Skyrim related file that I have made. This ENB gives a gloomy look with a glimmer of hope coming down on you. *Potential Spoiler Alert* It feels to me like how the vanilla style should have looked like after the beginning of the story when the dragon destroys Helgen until around the end of the main storyline. *End of Spoilers* Try it out and give me some feedback of how I could make this better. It would be extremely helpful if any of the fans of this can get my name out and get some more fans. Although not required; it would be very helpful to me.",
