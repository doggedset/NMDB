  "descriptionHtml": "This is the second set of armor I\\'ve done a pants version for, not counting the work ALEXE is doing on his Stormcloak Officer mod. This armor came about because I personally can\\'t stand guys wearing skirts unless they\\'re true Kilts. Most of the armors look like dresses in Skyrim so, that\\'s the main reason I\\'m doing these. I\\'ll be taking requests as well for any that players may be interested in. \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion Notes:\r\nFirst version with ragged skirting and pants. Pants texture closely matched to the armor\\'s brown texture which took a little ingenuity. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation notes:\r\nJust extract to your data folder like every other mod. These are edited NIF and DDS files so, there\\'s no way another retexture mod will work with mine unless you change it\\'s cuirasstrooper.dds file to use my Alpha layer.",
