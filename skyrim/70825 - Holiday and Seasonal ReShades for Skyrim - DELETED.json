  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=6][color=#1e84cc]Holiday and Seasonal ReShades for Skyrim[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/size][b][color=#1e84cc]Note: I cannot verify this, however, it appears that ReShade and ENBoost do not get along. If you wish, you may attempt to use them together, but, many people have been reporting stability issues and crashes when using them both. Others, however, seem to have them working fine together. I&#39;ll update this page if I am made aware of any news regarding this. Until then, as much as I hate saying this, I don&#39;t advise using ENBoost with my presets.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/b][size=5]Introduction\r<br />\r<br />[/size]This is a soon-to-be collection of ReShade presets that are based on their respective holiday or season. ReShade is a post-process injector which combines other injectors such as SweetFX, GemFX, and McFX as well as providing its own effects. ReShade allows users to have similar effects to ENB but without the performance impact that tends to tag along. While some effects that define ENB won&#39;t be present in ReShade, the finished product finds the perfect balance between style and gameplay.\r<br />\r<br />This first release contains only the &#34;Halloween&#34; preset. As time goes on and with community feedback, I plan on developing a preset for every season and Christmas. Each preset will have a variety of recommended and suggested mods which compliment them.\r<br />\r<br />- Recommended mods are mods which affect colors or lighting that I used while developing the preset. Presets can certainly be used without the recommended mods but doing so could cause the preset to not look as intended. None of these should be performance heavy.\r<br />\r<br />- Suggested mods add to the overall atmosphere of their respective preset. These have no effect on colors or lighting and only serve to enhance the experience. These can range from no performance impact at all to having a noticeable performance drop.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#1e84cc]This is my first attempt at mod developing, and advice, criticisms, or suggestions are 100% welcome.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/b][size=5]Presets\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4][color=#1e84cc]Halloween[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/size]Halloween is the first and currently only preset in this collection. It may also end up being the most &#34;cinematic&#34;, featuring both film grain and vignette. It&#39;s color palette drastically favors reds, oranges, and yellows. This combined with some tweaks to saturation and contrast turns Skyrim into a dark, yet strangely colorful land. I have to say, it came out better than I expected.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Recommended Mods\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17802/?]Climates of Tamriel - Weather - Lighting - Audio[/url]  \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27043/?]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Suggested Mods\r<br />[/size][/center]\r<br />[center]                                                [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24385/?]Epic Halloween Overhaul - 2015 - Spooky Scary Edition[/url]    [color=#ffff00]   &lt;--Can be FPS hungry[/color]\r<br />-OR-\r<br />                                                                      [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44654/?]Halloween In Skyrim - Even More Pumpkins[/url]                         [color=#ffff00] &lt;-- This is what I generally use[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27022/?]Supreme Storms for Climates of Tamriel[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24460/?]Supreme and Volumetric Fog[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12525/?]DYNAVISION - Dynamic Depth of Field\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/url][/center][center][size=5]Installation\r<br />\r<br />[/size]1. Install the recommended mods. It is highly recommended that you do, as I have no idea how this preset will look without them. None should be too performance heavy.\r<br />\r<br />2. Install any of the suggested mods, these might have some performance impact so consider the strength of your PC.\r<br />\r<br />3. Download the ReShade Framework from [url=http://reshade.me/]this site.[/url]\r<br />\r<br />4. Extract the ReShade Framework file to your desktop.\r<br />\r<br />5. Drag [u]ONLY[/u] the &#34;ReShade.fx&#34; file and the &#34;ReShade&#34; folder from the Framework into your Skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />6. From the &#34;Halloween ReShade&#34; file, open up the &#34;Core Files&#34; folder and drag the &#34;ReShade&#34; folder and the &#34;d3d9.dll&#34; within it into your Skyrim directory. Overwrite and merge any files or folders it asks about.\r<br />\r<br />7. If your want any of the optional files, drag those into the &#34;ReShade&#34; folder in the Skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />8. Run the Skyrim Launcher and do the following:\r<br />\r<br />   -Disable Anti Aliasing\r<br />\r<br />   -Under &#34;Advanced&#34; make sure FXAA is disabled\r<br />\r<br />[b]Alternatively you can navigate to your SkyrimPrefs.ini and set the following:[/b]\r<br />      \r<br />[Display]\r<br />      \r<br />bFXAAEnabled=0 \r<br />iMultiSample=0\r<br />\r<br />9. Launch Skyrim and enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH SHADOWS:[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />In your skyrimprefs.ini file:\r<br />\r<br />[DISPLAY]\r<br />bDeferredShadows=0[/center][center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][u]For those who wish to try ENBoost\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b][/size]First rename ReShade&#39;s d3d9.dll to reshade_d3d9.dll.\r<br />\r<br />Make sure you don&#39;t have bFloatPointRenderTarget=1 set in your skyrimprefs.ini as it is not needed and decreases performance.\r<br />\r<br />Then navigate to your enblocal.ini file and change the following:\r<br />\r<br />[PROXY]\r<br />EnableProxyLibrary=true\r<br />InitProxyFunctions=false\r<br />ProxyLibrary=reshade_d3d9.dll\r<br />\r<br />[GLOBAL]\r<br />UsePatchSpeedhackWithoutGraphics=true\r<br />UseDefferedRendering=false\r<br />\r<br />Then change the settings under the [MEMORY] section to fit your PC. A guide to this can be found [url=http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:ENBlocal_INI/Memory]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Again, most sources seem to report ENBoost and ReShade not playing nice together, but I put this here in case some people wanted to try.[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Mods Shown in Screenshots[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/607/?]Skyrim HD - 2K Textures - FULL[/url][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8655/?]Static Mesh Improvement Mod[/url][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3222/?]Immersive HUD - IHUD[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15506/?]Lightning during Thunder Storms[/url][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49344/?]Vivid Landscapes - All in One\r<br />\r<br />[/url] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41076/?]Realistic Water Two[/url] \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59721/?]Dynamic Distant Objects LOD - DynDOLOD[/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=5]Future Plans\r<br />[/size][/center][center]As stated before I plan on making a preset for Christmas and every season. Other effects may be present in those that didn&#39;t make it into &#34;Halloween&#34; for whatever reason. As this is my first attempt at mod developing and I wanted to get this preset out before Halloween was through, many features in ReShade were ignored or, were tested, but buggy. I plan on including more effects in my other presets and will update &#34;Halloween&#34; with any effect I feel it could benefit from. \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;d also love for feedback on performance from people with PCs of every kind. Finding a balance of performance and graphical prowess is ultimately what this is about. I have a rather high-end PC (though admittedly not the best hardware for Skyrim) so I notice no performance hit at all, but I assume others with low-end systems may have issues. If you do notice a unacceptable drop in framerate, please message me and I&#39;ll look into it.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#1e84cc][u]For reference my specs are:[/u][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />CPU - AMD FX 8320\r<br />\r<br />GPU - AMD R9 390\r<br />\r<br />RAM - 8GB\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Credits\r<br />\r<br />[/size][color=#1e84cc]Big thanks to the following for their contributions to ReShade:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Crosire - Head developer of ReShade\r<br />\r<br />CeeJay.dk - Developer of SweeFX\r<br />\r<br />Lucifer Hawk - Developer of GemFX\r<br />\r<br />Marty McFly - Developer of MasterEffect/McFX\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://reshade.me/]http://reshade.me/[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][u][b]You all have done an awesome job&#33;[/b][/u][/color][/center]",
