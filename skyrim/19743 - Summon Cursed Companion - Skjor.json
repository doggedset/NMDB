  "summary": "Summon the ferocious spirit of Skjor to assist you in battle!",
  "descriptionHtml": "========================================================\r\n8/9/12 Update Notes:\r\nAdded optional files 1c and 2c to replace the previous version if you do not like the smoke effect caused by Skjor\\'s attacks.  These optional files remove the permanent smoke effect on the dead opponents who Skjor dispatches.  Do not download these if you prefer having the effect.  Version 1c has the 24 hour recast timer, while version 2c doesn\\'t.\r\n========================================================\r\n7/8/12 Update Notes:\r\n\r\nVersion 1b fixes a bug where Skjor\\'s transformation explosion causes a blinding flash for 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nVersion 2b is the same as 1b except it does not have the 24 ingame hour recast timer.\r\n========================================================\r\n7/3/12 Update Notes:\r\n\r\nVersion 1a updates Skjor so that he transforms into his werewolf form more frequently.\r\n\r\nVersion 2a is the same as 1a except it does not have the 24 ingame hour recast timer.\r\n======================================================== \r\n\r\nVersion 1 has a 24 ingame hour recast timer.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 removes the recast timer and the player can summon Skjor indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo summon Skjor, finish the quest Silver Hand.  You can access Skjor\\'s Battle Log upon completing the mission.  Find Skjor and he\\'ll have the Battle Log.  If you\\'ve already completed this quest, simply visit the area you last saw Skjor and he still should be there.\r\n\r\nSkjor is equipped with the following:\r\n\r\n1. Equipped with the legendary sword Tyrfing.\r\n2. Fires a sword beam using Tyrfing during intense from a distance.\r\n3. Tyrfing\\'s sword beam has the chance of staggering and burning foes.\r\n4. Skjor can unleash an explosive strike using Tyrfing, and during a kill move, he will also unleash Tyrfingâ€™s powers.\r\n5. Curse of Hircine:  If Skjor takes too much damage, he will transform into a Fire Werewolf.  Upon transformation, the player will lose control of Skjor because of the intense rage of the wolf spirit. The wolf will still be friendly to the player and his allies.  Despite this, he will no longer follow the player and attack anything near him not associated to the player.  Although this seems as a disadvantage, see the notes for the actual usefulness of this ability.\r\n6. Hircine\\'s Pack: During transformation, Hircine has a chance of unleashing a pack of spectral wolves to assist him during combat.  \r\n7. Skjor\\'s Rage:  In werewolf form, Skjor will unleash a flame howl that incinerates his opponents.\r\n8. Wolf Spirit:  In werewolf form, if Skjor takes too much damage, he will transform into a wolf spirit.\r\n9. Skjor has a slight increase in health and stamina during his standard form, and in his wolf form, his movement speed is significantly increased.\r\n10. Skjor will be the same level as the player each time he is summoned.\r\n\r\nNotes: Skjor like Kodlak is a very capable warrior. Despite the similarities in abilities, Skjor is more focused on quick damage unlike the tanking style of Kodlak. I made Skjor powerful because we all know that there are stories about him and Kodlak defeating 40,000 Aldmeri soldiers on their own, despite them denying the story. Regarding his werewolf transformation, although the player loses control of Skjor and he will no longer follow the player, if Skjor is still in the same dungeon or area as the player, he will continue to fight anything not associated with the player.  Because Skjor is no longer bound to the player, he/she can summon another follower, thus increasing numbers.  Skjor in werewolf form will not attack the player, the player\\'s followers, or the player\\'s summons unless he is provoked.  Despite this, I would not suggest using Skjor during \\\"rescue missions\\\" because he may attack the person the player is trying to rescue.  Skjor is great for fighting dragons or going through dungeons where there are no NPCs required to complete the dungeon.\r\n\r\nThis mod should not be incompatible with any other mod unless you are using a Companion\\'s actor replacer mod (those that change the actor ID of the Companions), or any mod that modifies the Gallow\\'s Rock location.  If so, vanilla Skjor may not be available and the player will not have access to his Battle Log.  If there are any issues, please let me know so I can look into it.  \r\n\r\nIf you like the mod, please endorse.  I am working on the next summon mod, but will also make adjustments to this one if any issues arise.  Be sure to check out my other summon mods as well.",
