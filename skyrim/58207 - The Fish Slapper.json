From the deepest depths of the deepest carverns of the deepest reccesses of the machinations of my mind I &#39;hooked&#39; this. A Slaughterfish for a weapon&#33;. What once was the scorn of the oceans and rivers of Nirn is now nothing more than a Fishy Stick. Yes nobody has thought of it, nobody wants it but behold the Fish Slapper. \r<br />\r<br />Onto what it actually does. This mod adds a weildable Slaughterfish for a weapon, it&#39;s classed as a mace and it can be tempered with Slaughterfish Scales. But it cannot be forged as all you&#39;ll end up with is a nice smokey fish dinner and not a wet fish to slap people with.\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s about 4 scattered around.\r<br />In the sunken Nord ruin in the middle of lake Ilinalta in a bowl.\r<br />In Boulderfall Cave on the table.\r<br />In Purewater Ruin near the Dwemer head underwater.\r<br />Outside the Abandoned Shack on a crate.\r<br />And if you&#39;re really lazy, on the enchanted table in the Qasmoke cell. \r<br />\r<br />The mesh doesn&#39;t have any blood maps as I haven&#39;t yet discovered how to do them and it looks better slapping people with an unbloodied fish also the fins might go through the hand grip but it&#39;s difficult to change that. It&#39;s weaker than the Iron mace but if you keep at it you can slap them into submission. \r<br />\r<br />Right That&#39;s your lot.\r<br />Stay Muddy. ",
