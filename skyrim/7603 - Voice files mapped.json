  "summary": "This is just a personal reference I scraped together that transcribes the voice files from over a dozen different voices. I have some quest and actor info, plus the shouts.

  "descriptionHtml": "NOTE: The CK has made this pretty much obsolete, so I won\\'t be updating it. It IS a bit easier to search for the odd phrase or two, but the dialogue export in the CK also gives you the lip files, etc - plus it\\'s 100% accurate, whereas this download was never checked once the CK came out.\r\n\r\nThis is just a personal reference I scraped together that transcribes the voice files from over a dozen different voices. I have some quest and actor info, plus the shouts. I\\'ve got it color-coded by type of voice files, be it quest, crime, merchant, etc related. I\\'m not OCD, I just have alot of time on my hands at work. You will need OpenOffice to open the file. (OpenOffice.org)\r\n\r\nThere are ALOT of common files names between the folders. Nearly all identical files names say exactly the same words (a few don\\'t, but are along a similar vein). So if you want a voice I haven\\'t covered, you can look for the filename in the voices I have done. Also, most dialogue is prefixed by what it relates to, so I made a quick quest key. It is NOT complete (as far as the freeform and other quest-types go), but almost all of the major questlines are there.\r\n\r\nThe person who suggested I put this on the Nexus also suggested I add links to sound tools. Probably a good idea. :) Just remember that converting .fuz to .wav makes the files more than 20x bigger, so if you are limited to disc space, be careful.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6986\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=950",
