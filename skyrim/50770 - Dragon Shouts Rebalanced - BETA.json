  "descriptionHtml": "[size=100][i]Let&#39;s face it: many dragon shouts are useless. [/i][/size] \r<br />After getting the last word of frost breath and using it against a bandit to minimal damage I had  given up vanilla shouts. Searching around Nexus I found out a mod here but it was completely outdated with some bugs, so I decided to make my own (first) mod.\r<br />[size=150][color=green][b]Dragon Shouts Rebalanced - BETA [/b][/color][/size]\r<br />I did my comparisons, tests and try outs and some dragon shouts have been changed for the best. However I realized it would be much better and faster if I had the community&#39;s feedback :\r<br />Feel free to discuss, criticize, suggest, talk or/and comment about the gameplay . [u]All shouts[/u] are subject to edition and balance, including the ones I did not have the time to work out.\r<br />In the following weeks/months I intend to develop it and change any value, cooldown and effect defined as unnecessary. That includes all and any shouts, including the ones that were re-balanced. I&#39;m here to listen to you, so all of us, fans, can enjoy the game a bit more. \r<br />\r<br />Download it and test it, see if you agree, if a shout it&#39;s too powerful or if it still needs changes. The goal is to improve all shouts in the game (That&#39;s why it is in BETA stage) .\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=yellow][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[b]The mod requires AT LEAST Unoffical Skyrim Patch and Unoffical Dawnguard Patch and obviously Dawnguard DLC . I have not touched Dragonborn DLC yet, but I plan to do it later.\r<br />You can use this mod whether you have Dragonborn or/and Hearthfire or not. YOU CAN&#39;T USE IT IF DON&#39;T HAVE DAWNGUARD.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=white][b]-----SHOUTS-----[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Aura Whisper[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[b]Cooldown reduced by 10%, now they are 27s, 36s and 45s respectively. Previously 30s,40s and 50s[/b]\t\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Animal Allegiance[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[b]Cooldown reduced as effect and duration increased. Probably one of the most weak unbalanced and weak shouts because it&#39;s cooldown, low duration and lack of targets (animals only help if you&#39;re in their line of sight)[/b]\r<br />\r<br />First Word: Duration increased from 35s to 45s and cooldown reduced from 50s to 45s\r<br />Second Word: Duration increased from 45s to 65s and cooldown reduced from 60s to 54s and level limit buffed to 25.\r<br />Third Word: Duration increased from 60s to 90s and cooldown reduced from 70s to 63s and level limit buffed to 30. Area increased from 250ft to 300ft.\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Become Ethereal[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[b]All effects and cooldown reduced by 10%. [/b]\r<br />\r<br />First Word: effect from 8s to 9s and cooldown reduced from 20s to 18s\r<br />Second Word: effect from 13s to 14s and cooldown reduced from 30s to 27s\r<br />Third Word: effect from 18s to 20s and cooldown reduced from 40s to 36s\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Call of Valor[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[b]Cooldown for all words reduced from 180s to 120s and summoning has been increased from 60s to 90s, giving the player a fair balance between cooldown and summoning. \r<br />*Beware  they use player&#39;s shouts (just like all Draurgs and Ancient Dragonborn from Dragon Aspect) so now they are much more powerful. [/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Fire Breath[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />First Word: 60 damage + 6 dmg/s * 5s \r<br />Second Word: 130 damage + 10dmg/s * 5s\r<br />Third Word: 220 damage + 16dmg/s * 5s and cooldown reduced from 100 to 90 seconds\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Frost Breath[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />First Word: 10 damage + 16 dmg/s * 5s \r<br />Second Word: 20 damage + 32dmg/s * 5s\r<br />Third Word: 40 damage + 52dmg/s * 5s and cooldown reduced from 100 to 90 seconds\r<br />\r<br />[b]Both breath attacks did an insignificant damage Now they’re quite powerful reaching 300 damage at its maximum power. They follow the vanilla pattern with small changes:\r<br />Fire breath now does little residual damage and frost breath does small instant damage[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Ice Form[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[b]Damage of 2 points per second has changed to a gradual value and the ridiculous values of cooldown has been reduced by 17%[/b]\r<br />\r<br />First Word: 2 damage/s and cooldown reduced from 60 to 50 seconds\r<br />Second Word: 3 damage/s and cooldown reduced from 90 to 75 seconds\r<br />Third Word: 4 damage/s and cooldown reduced from 120 to 100 seconds\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Kyne&#39;s Peace [/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[b]Now Third word has got area effect equal to twice the area effect of the second word. I did that because the area effect of the Second Word was double the value from the First Word[/b]\r<br />\r<br />First Word: no level change, cooldown reduced to 35s\r<br />Second Word: affects animals up to level 25 and cooldown reduced to 45s\r<br />Third Word: affects animals up to level 30,area effect increased to 300 feet (from 225 ft)  and cooldown reduced to 55s\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Marked for Death[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[b]Damage now increases along with the shout (previously the words did 2 damage in all degrees). Duration and armor damage also has been increased.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />First Word: 2 damage/s and  50 armor damage/s and duration set to 90s from 60s\r<br />Second Word: 3 damage/s and 100 armor damage/s and duration set to 90s from 60s\r<br />Third Word: 4 damage/s and 150 armor damage/s and duration set to 90s from 60s\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Storm Call[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[b]Damage increased by 12,5 % to all words, cooldown reduced by 10 and 20%. The 600s cooldown was excessively high so I reduced the cooldown from 10 to 8 minutes. [/b]\r<br />\r<br />First Word: 45 damage and cooldown reduced to 270s\r<br />Second Word: 67,5 damage and cooldown reduced to 390s\r<br />Third Word: 90 damage and cooldown reduced to 480s\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Unrelenting  Force[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Third Word: cooldown reduced to 40s from 50s. Damage increased  to 10 points\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Whirlwind Sprint[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[b]Cooldown reduced to 15,20 and 30 seconds respectively.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Soul Tear[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Third Word: cooldown reduced to 80s and damage increased by 50 points (now it’s 350)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Both breath attacks has had their damage increased so I have increased the damage of Soul Tear that still stays as the highest damaging shout in the game .[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=red][b]Drain Vitality[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[b]Cooldown reduced to 30, 50 and 70s and damage increased to 6/6/6,5 respectively. \r<br />The 30,60,90 cooldown never seduced anyone because:\r<br />\r<br />1)you really don&#39;t care about stamina damage\r<br />2) magicka damage improves the battle but you only use it against warlocks, dragons and dragon priests. And wait 1 minute to make it pay out really hurts(specially because you could not use any other shouts)\r<br />3) Things are finally better but the 90s was very high and you have to wait too much.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=150][color=white][b]MORE SHOUTS TO COME[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />These are the only shouts I edited, feel free to discuss the current changes and suggest more. Also the other shouts are open to be worked out.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;d like to thank [b]Master Dan[/b] from the Steam forums for all the help provided. Without him I could never make my first mod.
