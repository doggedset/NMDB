  "descriptionHtml": "EDIT: im still here lol, this upcoming Christmas break i will be working on this mod to make a new and improved version as this one was broken a little bit, sorry :\\'( 15/11/2012\r\n\r\nSimilar to better whiterun. I made a mod that makes Markarth look alot better then dead trees every where. it adds a magical kind of feel. so far i\\'ve done most of the city and part of the keep.\r\n\r\nNote: there is a bug in the keep when you go in to the keep. there are some rendering problems but other then that i dont think it conflicts with anything. i.e at the end of the hall way its all grey then you go through the grey and your on the other side. I am working on fixing that issue.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this mod conflicts with any others if so please tell me and i will see if i can make it compatible.\r\n\r\nI plan to add much, much more after all, I did do this in less then 3 hours ^^\r\n\r\nthis may affect FPS it did not for me but it may for other computers then the full thing is done i will start working on a performance friendly version.  \r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nSimply put the .ESP file in Skyrim Data Folder\r\n(Program files(x64, x84)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data) ;)  \r\nCheck of Fantasy Markarth in data files at game launcher\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nUncheck Fantasy Markarth box and delete.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy~",
