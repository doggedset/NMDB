  "descriptionHtml": "[center][i]The Zephyr Militia have long been at war with their neighboring factions. They are a seedy bunch, known to backstab those whom they dislike in the very least. Having dealings with the Nightshade assassins, encounters with Dwemer researchers and a general fondness for all things leather - the variation in styling of their attire is quite noticeable. Some have joined and quit the Dawnguard, while others are on the move back to Hammerfell for a regroup to plot their next riot. The Assault division of the Zephyr Militia tend to favor variation during combat. Moving from the backlines to the front, they weave through battles and attack with precision. They must be swift and keep their armor at minimum for mobility. Sacrifices in protection must be made for the sake of said mobility. Agile warriors will surely welcome the look and layout of the Assault division\\'s armor.[/i][/center]\r\n[line]\r\nCategorized as light \\\"Dwarven Armor\\\" - the weights are semi-realistic, monetary values are appropriate and the protective ratings are loosely based on a dwarven/leather hybrid scale. None of these armor pieces are either craftable nor temperable. This is 100% intentional and will not change. The Assault armor can be purchased exclusively from Zale, a West Wind merchant who can be found inside Reachwind Eyrie. This dwemer tower is located southeast of Markarth and northeast of Dushnikh Yal. Zale is available 24/7, very wealthy and will buy most of your items. He is armed with an Assault of the Essence, which is categorized as a \\\"Glass\\\" weapon and has a base damage rating roughly the same as a Daedric sword.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Assault Armor:[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n_Atronach Left / Atronach Right / Atronach Duo\r\n_Boots Oiled / Boots Pale\r\n_Bracers\r\n_Gauntlets\r\n_Cloth Arm Wrap Left / Cloth Arm Wrap Right\r\n_Dust Straps\r\n_Pauldron / Pauldron Lesser\r\n_Pants Dark / Pants Pale\r\n_Pride Green Left / Pride Green Right / Pride Red Left / Pride Red Right\r\n_Respirator\r\n_Scarf Dirty / Scarf Dirty Alternate / Scarf Red / Scarf Red Alternate\r\n_Torso Militia / Torso Paisley/ Torso Quilt\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Assault Weapons:[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n_Assault of the Essence\r\n[line]\r\n[size=3][b]Installation:[/b][/size]\r\n_If you need instructions on how to install an armor mod, then you shouldn\\'t be here :D\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Patches:[/b][/size]\r\n_[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31844]German Translation[/url] by TKone\r\n_[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32586]Tempering Patch[/url] by Rendalli\r\n_BBP patches by MrTroubleMaker for both UNP and UNPB of the Torso parts are all found in the optional downloads\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Usage:[/b][/size]\r\n_Each piece of armor is \\'parted\\', meaning you can decide which to equip and not equip. I\\'ve done this since my first UNP mashup and will continue to do so for the next two in the West Wind series. If you are unsure of how this works, I suggest you ask a friend or family member.\r\n_If you\\'d like to adjust the armor ratings and light/heavy class, you can try the newly uploaded [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32027/]Armor Converter[/url] by Compucidalusa.\r\n_WARNING: It is not, nor has it ever been, my intention to create \\'nude\\' mods. That being said, if and when you only equip a torso piece of this set - your character or follower(s) will have no mesh covering the lower regions of the body. Please understand this is a limitation of me not being able to implement some sort of auto-equip underwear that ties into the torso piece.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Permissions:[/b][/size]\r\nThe esp is free game for anyone who wishes to alter the contents. Stats, recipes, locations, etc... have fun with it. Just be sure to post a link to this page and give credit where credit is due. HOWEVER - none of the textures or meshes are allowed for re-upload. This is mainly because of borrowed assets. You MUST contact both myself and the respective original authors from which some of this work came if you plan on making some sort of variation for this mod.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Credits/Thanks:[/b][/size]\r\n_Dimon - for the UNP meshes included with this mod.
