  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#DDCCBB][size=5][b]Cobb Worldspace-To-Heightmap Converter[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />I built this tool for my own use, so it&#39;s [i]significantly[/i] less polished than my more public-minded works, but I figure people may still get some use out of it. This upload consists of:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]A TES5Edit script that can export all heightmap data for selected cells.\r<br />[*]A web page (though it should run locally on your hard drive) that can load that dataset, process it, and generate a heightmap image (that you can right-click and save).\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#DDCCBB][b]Caveats[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />This is one of my personal tools and as such, it is provided as-is. I may fix bugs or provide support on request, but in general I&#39;m going to be a lot less keen on fixing this thing than I would be for my public works.\r<br />\r<br />These tools were created specifically for Skyrim Classic, and are not guaranteed to work on Fallout 4 or Skyrim Special.\r<br />\r<br />The web page tool was developed for Firefox and has only been tested in that browser. I can&#39;t guarantee stable or accurate behavior on other browsers.\r<br />\r<br />There are two kinds of heightmap data for cells -- Vertex Height, embedded in Landscape data, and Max Height Data -- and the latter has not been fully decoded. When VHGT data is not available for a cell, MHDT is used as a fallback, which can affect the final results for the entire heightmap as brightness is normalized across the entire heightmap.",
