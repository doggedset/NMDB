  "modName": "REAL GLASS and Ebony Weapons - No green tint",
  "summary": "Combined Glass and Ebony weapons with glass stats - nothing overpowered.\r<br />The textures give a true stunning see through appearance without any green tint.\r<br />Shadows and light give great detail.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Updates:\r<br />September 11 2014\r<br />- Cleaned the header for DLC requirements with TES5edit - only requires Skyrim\r<br />- Repacked textures, there should be no conflicts with other mods.\r<br />If you had conflicts or use a lot of mods, I would use the latest posted version, 1.2\r<br />As well it should run fine on stock Skyrim without expansions.\r<br />\r<br />The original glass and most I could find did not give great effects in light/shadows.\r<br />This has no tint - translucent glass blades, and the appearance similar to ebony/daedric hilt workings.\r<br />They also reflect quite nicely.\r<br />\r<br />They are not overpowered.Â  The stats are kept the same as original glass weaponry.\r<br />So they have a good base and your skill determines the rest as you progress.\r<br />\r<br />The cache of weapons are washed up in a chest behind/beside the Riverwood Blacksmith porch, on the shore by a rock partially submerged in the water.\r<br />There are two of each for dual wielders and the chest is set to respawn.",
