The Civilization of this kingdom could be characterized by their delicate Architectures and relics. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baekje) Contents of this page could be your references, if you want a bit more about the kingdom.\r\n\r\nAnyway It is known fact that this sword was used by The King Mu-Ryeong, who was one of the brightest sovereign of the kingdom. The sword was excavated from the tumulus of the king(1971), and preserved since then.\r\nMaybe you know the Samsung Corporation, the firm makes LED Tv and Galaxy S or something. Funny thing, The owner of this Corportaion is actually the owner of this sword, too. You may see the relic at the \\\"Samsung Museum of art, leeum\\\" in Korea.\r\n\r\nThe Type of word, \\\"Go_Ri_Kal\\\" is typically found all over the tumulus of Three kingdoms of Korea.
