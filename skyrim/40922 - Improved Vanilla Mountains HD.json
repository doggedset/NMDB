  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/LNnqIcv.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThis is my fist attempt with textures.\r\n\r\nAt first this was a mod i made for my personal use after testing a lot of different mountain/rocks textures. While there are awesome mountains and rocks textures here on Nexus, only a few are \\\"vanilla-friendly\\\", and as i prefer the vanilla style of mountain textures i was never really satisfied with the texture mods.\r\nWhile doing this retexture i tought: \\\"Well... maybe someone prefer the vanilla mountain texture style like me, so... [b]WHY NOT SHARE?![/b]\r\n\r\nThat\\'s it!\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nWHAT I DID \r\n----------------\r\n\r\nAs this is my first texture project and im far from an expert with textures, the texture is far from perfect... but i can assure you i lost some time to tune it the best i could.\r\n\r\nAs i dont have the skill to do a proper retexture from the ground up, i used the vanilla texture as a base and then applied a high detailed texture overlay i made and fine tuned. The same applies to the normal map.\r\nWhile this sounds as just an enlargement with a texture overlay, it was not that simple. I tweaked the texture and normal map a LOT to make it look as detailed as possible while maintaining the vanilla look as intact as possible. In other words... [b]A deep balance between realism and style[/b]\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/gwPAv67.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\nFOR WHO IS THIS MOD\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nBasically for everybody, but mainly for who prefers to keep the vanilla style intact.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nTOLERANCE\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nAs i said before, this is my first attempt with textures (im far from an expert), so i hope you understand that i decided to release this mod so you can have [b]\\\"the benefit of choice\\\"[/b] between all the mountain/rocks texture mods on Nexus.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Test before judging![/u][/b]\r\n\r\nI will not tolerate insults, rant, flame wars!!!\r\n\r\nOn the other hand... constructive critics will be highly appreciated!\r\n\r\n-------------------------------\r\nTEXTURE RESOLUTION\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe textures are at 2048x2048, which in my opinion is the best balance between Quality x VRAM consumption for most computers.\r\n\r\nI will consider making a 1K and 4K versions later and maybe a darker version.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nJust extract the content to Skyrim main folder (where the TESV.exe is located)\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\nMY OTHER MODS\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32505/]Skyrim Project Optimization[/url]: What it does is to use occlusions to optimize and improve performance on interiors .\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29253/]Remove Interior Fog V2[/url]: What it does is to remove the ambient fog on all interiors, making them darker and more realistic.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/40937]Solitude dragonhead HD[/url]: A texture improvement for the Solitude dragonhead.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41053/]Salmon Texture HD[/url]: A retexture of the Salmon fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]DONT FORGET TO ENDORSE IF YOU LIKE![/b]",
