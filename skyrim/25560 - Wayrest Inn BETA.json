  "summary": "Wayrest Inn from Dragonlance.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is my first really serious mod, the tavern Wayrest Inn from the Dragonlance novels by Margret Weiss and Tracy Hickman. \r\n\r\nJust outside Riftens watchtowers, a little pine firest has grown up, and Tika Waylan has together with her husband Caramon built the Wayrest. Here you will meet Fisban, Laurana, Sturm and Tanis Half-elf. I\\'ve also included a follower that I originally made for my father, the bulky Highelf Gaelar. ( He is not from the books, just a personal favourite of mine)\r\n\r\nThis is a BETA, so there are still some features to make, such as the followers. They are a bit buggy, due to Creation Kit <3 For now they are jsut followers, not bound by quests. Tried to make them as hirelings, but it just bugged out and dialogues vanished.\r\nI also need to add my bard and do the Innkeeper scripting, so you can rent a bed.\r\n\r\nAny tips, hints or feedback are more then welcome. I intend on making this as awesome as possible.\r\n\r\nPersonal thanks to DarkFox127, for the numberous of tutorials and problemsolving.\r\nEnjoy.\r\n//Emma",
