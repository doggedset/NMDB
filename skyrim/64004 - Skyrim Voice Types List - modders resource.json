This is a modders resource which, for me, has the intent to provide me with a simple, easy, accessible, and searchable database for identifying the types of factions a voice type belongs to. \r<br />\r<br />This will allow modders to create dynamic characters in their mods, and give assign them to a multitude of compatible factions. The compatible factions will give your npc the voice dialogs which would otherwise be a blank stare if you assigned them to an incompatible faction.\r<br />\r<br />A search of maleeventoned voice type has returned the following results for compatible faction voices:\r<br />\r<br />(A note of caution: The CW... and WI... faction voice types may be unique to my merged mod.
