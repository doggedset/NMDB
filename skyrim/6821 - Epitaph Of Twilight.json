  "summary": "A small tribute to the Dot Hack series.",
  "descriptionHtml": "To anyone who has ever played dot hack, you will know this and like me, possibly love it. The game Dot Hack is part based off a poem, created for the game. The poem is entitled \\\"Epitaph Of Twilight\\\" So, i took the liberty of copying the poem right onto the blade of the one katana in the normal game.\r\n\r\nWhat it says:\r\n\r\n\\\"Yet to return, the shadowed one.\r\nWho quests for the Twilight Dragon\r\nRumbles the Dark Hearth,\r\nAnd Helba, Queen of the Dark[2],\r\nhas raised finally her army.\r\nApeiron, King of Light[2] beckons.\r\nAt the base of the rainbow do they meet\r\nAgainst the abominable Wave,\r\ntogether they fight.\r\nAlba\\'s lake boils.\r\nLight\\'s great tree doth fall.\r\nPower- now all to droplets turned\r\nin the temple of Arche Koeln.\r\nReturns to nothing,\r\nthis world of shadowless ones.\r\nNever to return, the shadowed one,\r\nWho quests for the Twilight Dragon.\\\"\r\n\r\nIron Sword Retex:\r\n\r\nA small iron sword retex. On the top of the blade it says \\\"Atoli and Haseo, Eternally Devoted.\\\" And near the hilt it says, \\\"Do you know what Honeysuckles represent? Eternal Devotion.\\\"\r\n\r\nAll of the text is however backwards.\r\n\r\nAlso! I\\'m looking for modders to help me do retex\\'s or other things so that we can build a more Dot Hack Skyrim. Dot Hack just is not given the credit it deserves, and we should change that!\r\n\r\nIf interested send an email to jacobwingo70@gmail.com",
