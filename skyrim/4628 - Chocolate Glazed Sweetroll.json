I was eating a chocolate glazed donut at 5am and was playing Skyim. Oh wow, a fat geek, what else is new? Anyway, I thought there was a lack of chocolate in Skyrim, so I decided to fix that.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nCopy the textures folder to your Skyrim\\\\data folder. \r\n\r\nUninstallation: \r\nDelete the sweetroll01.dds file located in Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\Clutter\\\\ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-Bethesda\r\n-THEWULFMAN\r\n",
