  "summary": "For an alternative, more imperious Ulfric Stormcloak.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I always felt the vanilla model for Ulfric Stormcloak was a poor representation of the character. This is a man who has had his father, the revered Jarl of Windhelm and Eastmarch, tragically taken away from him, a man who has seen his country shamed by the weakness of the Empire and the White-Gold Concordat, and a man who has single-handedly slain the High King of Skyrim. The original Ulfric model, to me, doesn\\'t convey that background story; he looks rather comical and lighthearted, as opposed to serious and gloomy (have you noticed that Ulfric almost never laughs?) \r\n\r\nThis mod seeks to make Ulfric into the powerful, respected, and commanding mastermind that he is. Gone is his green-blonde hair and pointy nose - features that made him look too cheery. Ulfric is now a commanding presence, with a dark, grim look and stormy-blue eyes. I feel that his model now conveys the look of a worthy, experienced leader of the Stormcloaks.\r\n\r\nWith Version 1.2, I have provided to you four different variants of Ulfric (to give you a bit of choice) of various combinations of hair and warpaint. I personally like the dark hair version, but I made a blond version in case there were some die-hard fans of blond Ulfric. Anyways, enjoy the mod, and let me know your feedback so I can expand the Ulfric models to suit a wider audience!\r\n\r\nAlso: don\\'t forget to endorse if you enjoy the mod!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAmbarenya\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n~ If you want Ulfric to have the exact same textures, use the S.T.E.P. guide for enhancing Skyrim.\r\n~ I may be doing some additional tweaks to Ulfric and maybe some more alternate models, so stay posted. \r\n\r\nConflicts: \r\n~ None, except other mods that alter Ulfric Stormcloak.\r\n\r\nInstallation: \r\n~ Not complicated, just drag and drop into your Skyrim folder and activate the .esp\r\n~ Alternatively, I have added Nexus Mod Manager (NMM) support for easy installation.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nChange Notes:\r\nv1.1 \r\nFixed \\\"Grey faced\\\" issue with Ulfric\r\nFixed an issue where Ulfric would not show up on the Helgen cart\r\nTweaked his face and color gradients a bit for more realism\r\n\r\nv1.2 \r\nFixed Ulfric\\'s skin tone\r\nAdded various hair/warpaint color variations\r\n\r\n",
