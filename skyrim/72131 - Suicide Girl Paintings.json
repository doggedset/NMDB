  "summary": "Replaces all craftable and prewar paintings with Suicide Girls",
  "descriptionHtml": "Suicide Girl replacement textures for all the Paintings in game.\r<br />Right now I&#39;ve only done the Craftable Paintings and their Prewar Copies seen throughout the game.\r<br />\r<br />I switched the prewar with generic paintings so the ones you place in your home will look pristine and new, while the ones seen in the world will look distressed.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod so please give an endorsement if you like it. I put a lot of work into distressing the images and making sure they all fit the frames, unlike most of the retexture mods I&#39;ve seen so far so hopefully you like it and will spread it around. I&#39;ll have constant updates to add more pictures on all the Billboards and Signs as I get them finished.\r<br />\r<br />[INSTALLATION]\r<br />\r<br />Just drop the {textures} folder into your DATA folder in Fallout 4 and enjoy&#33;\r<br />",
