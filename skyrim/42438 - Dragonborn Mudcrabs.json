  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][color=#C8FE2E]v1.0.4 The scripts are now packed into archive for easier installation.[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=#C8FE2E]If you want to use my scripts in your mods by all means you may do so, just give me the credit.[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[img] http://www.imageshack.com/scaled/large/856/wyht.jpg [/img]\r\n\r\nThis mod features three powerful mudcrabs thought to be the last remaining of the Thu\\'um mudcrab masters.\r\n\r\nThey are all available for recruiting as followers. The 3 companions are: Sparky, Murmur and Indrik. Each specializes in one of three aspects: fire, ice and lightning.\r\n\r\n[img] http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/7919/v37r.jpg [/img][img] http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/5664/eelj.jpg [/img][img] http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/885/7jwp.jpg [/img]\r\nSparky\\'s special attacks: ///LIGHTNING/// \r\n-Whirlwind strike\r\n-Ebonyflesh\r\n-Lightning cloak\r\n-Mass paralysis\r\n-Summon mudcrab spirit\r\n-Close Wounds\r\n\r\nMurmur\\'s special attacks: ///ICE///\r\n-Frost breath\r\n-Ice form\r\n-Ebonyflesh\r\n-Frost cloak\r\n-Mass paralysis\r\n-Summon mudcrab spirit\r\n-Close Wounds\r\n\r\nIndrik\\'s special attacks: ///FIRE///\r\n-Fire breath\r\n-Unrelenting force\r\n-Ebonyflesh\r\n-Flame cloak\r\n-Mass paralysis\r\n-Summon mudcrab spirit\r\n-Close Wounds\r\n\r\nThere is also a substantial boost to their health and stamina as well as static damage resist ability. Dragonborn mudcrabs are essential and won\\'t die, so you don\\'t have to worry about that. They have no effect on your stealth meter, and unagressive and won\\'t attack recklessly or engage into combat on sight, I tried to make them fit stealthy profiles too. Carrying capacity have also been increased in case you are over encumbered. I gave them a speed boost so that they can actually keep up with the player. \r\n \r\nThe companions were made and tested on master difficulty, playing on lower difficulties may change the experience and make them look overpowered compared to other NPC\\'s. Consider that they are mostly for high level characters, though they scale with you starting from level 10. Difficulty enhancing mods are very welcome.\r\n\r\nSparky can be found in Riverwood near the bridge, Murmur lives in Falkreath and Indrik lives in Ivarstead. See images for locations.\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=#C8FE2E]Requirements:[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nDragonborn mudcrabs is standalone and doesn\\'t require any additional mod to function properly.
