It is located North of Whiterun jsut at the edge of the mountains.  It has everything a person could want or need.   A library just waiting for all your books.  A weapons room to store all your weapons, including display cases.  Several armour maniquins reside in the main hall.  In the Solar, their is an enchanting table as well as an alchemist table.\r\n\r\nThis is just the first release fo theis house, as it is my first attempt at doing one.
