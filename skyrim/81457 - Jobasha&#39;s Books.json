  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=5][u][b].:Jobasha&#39;s Books:.[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a new book store to Winterhold called Jobasha&#39;s Books.\r<br />The shop can be found just at the end of the path between the ruined houses.\r<br />\r<br />Jobasha&#39;s stock is drawn from all the major book level lists. He sells mostly common books but does have a chance to sell rare books. He does not sell Skill books. Spell tomes that he carries are from the novice and adept level lists, same for the scrolls.\r<br />\r<br />Upstairs you can find Charles the plant which will yield one meteor slime (which Jobasha also sells). A reference to his Morrowind counter part ;)\r<br />The Meteor Slime cures poison as well as resists it, cures diseases and also fortifies magicka.\r<br />\r<br />Aside from selling books, scrolls and spell tomes Jobasha also sells a small variety of other items:\r<br />\r<br />-Elsweyr Fondue.\r<br />-Skooma\r<br />-Moonsugar\r<br />-Alchemy Recipies\r<br />- Burnt and Ruined Books\r<br />- Paper rolls, ink wells, quills\r<br />- Meteor slime [/center][center]\r<br />Jobasha has a full schedule and is open for business 8am-8pm\r<br />[/center]\r<br />[center].:My other Winterhold mods:.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50148/?]Winterhold Gate[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/81457/?]Winterhold Jobasha&#39;s Books[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77889/?]Winterhold Bridge Repair[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/78800/?]Winterhold Temple of Julinaos\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49851/?]Summon Magic Anomaly[/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Author note:\r<br />\r<br />It always bothered me how Skyrim had no book stores and Winterhold seemed like the perfect place for this mod. Given that Winterhold is a hub for mages, learners, scholars and knowledge seekers; even with its ruins and failing, something like this should have already have been implemented. \r<br />\r<br />For me the mod was a way to get a little Morrowind Easter egg into the game as well as providing a nice little merchant that sells a unique inventory. Skooma, Moon sugar and the Elsweyr Fondue are meant to link to his Kahjiit background while the misc items, such as inkwells and paper, provide a much needed avenue to items to those who use scroll crafting mods.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy the mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53022/?]Jokerine&#39;s Misc Resources[/url] - For the Sign outside the shop.",
