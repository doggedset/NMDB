  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][center]Background[/center][size=3]I initially created this mod for another purpose but realized it was not going to be possible. However, I found the effects pretty entertaining, so I thought I would share this INCOMPLETE mod anyway. My hope is that somebody can find it useful for their own mod, or people can have a little fun for a little bit.\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=5]Body Morph[/size]\r<br />\r<br />This mod will add a spell called &#34;Become&#34;. Cast it at an NPC to be morphed into them&#33; It works instantly. It will only work if the NPC you choose is the same sex as you. Trust me, you don&#39;t want to see what a cross-sex morph looks like.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=6]CAUTION[/size][/b]\r<br />[size=4]Save before you use this spell&#33; You will not be able to turn back into your original self.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]SKSE\r<br />[size=3]This file requires SKSE to work[/size][/size][/size][/center]\r<br />[/size][/size]",
