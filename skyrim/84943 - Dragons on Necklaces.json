  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a simple mod that makes a dragon (hopefully) come to your location when you equip a necklace.\r<br />\r<br />The necklaces are located at on the map with a rune marker, near the Serpent Stone, by a corpse. There is another at the Throat of the World. The dragons fly around freely and shouldn&#39;t attack you.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is just a test and me testing stuff. Mostly uploaded for someone who asked :) So I apologise if things break.\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to use this mod as you wish.",
