  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]Real Traders 1.9[/size]\r<br />by: SpiderAkiraC (AC3C)\r<br />\r<br />Real Traders:\r<br />\r<br />The goal of this mod series is to make Skyirm feel more realistic and Immerse. I grew tired of always encountering Npcs on the roads but never actually seeing them\r<br />in the cities or villages. This mod changes all that. I have created actual traders that travel from city to village, and vice versa.\r<br />They will travel to a different destination everyday and will stay at an Inn during the night. \r<br />Ever wonder where all the sell swords have gone? We&#39;ll these traders have payed the extra coin for protection thats right some traders will have a Bodyguard.\r<br />If you have been getting sick of running in to those ghostly Npcs on the roads I highly recommend you [url=#]download[/url] this now, you wont be disappointed.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Features:[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Intractable Traders - [url=#]Buy[img]http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png[/img][/url] and sell things to them anywhere at anytime.\r<br />Advanced AI - Moving from City to city, village or civil war camps.\r<br />Massively Diverse - A massive list of different Npcs chosen to spawn and never despawn. Will wear clothes suitable to the current climate.\r<br />\r<br />Quick note:\r<br />if you noticed in the screens their gold was quite low so I bumped up their base gold so they will have at least 50 gold on them the max is near 200.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Compatiable with:\r<br />[/size][/b]\r<br />-The Civil war quest lines (not sure about modded civil wars)\r<br />-Heartfire\r<br />-Dawnguard\r<br />-Dragonborn\r<br />-Other encounter able Npcs\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Other mods:[/size][/b]\r<br />-Mods that spawn Npcs in cities should be ok\r<br />-Wet & Cold (for the traders to equip cloaks)\r<br />-Equipment Flexibility ([url=#]for traders[img]http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png[/img][/url] to equip backpacks)\r<br />-Extra Encounters\r<br />-Adventurers & Travelers \r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3][color=#ffffff][url=#]Install[/url]:[/color]\r<br />[/size][/b]Simply Extract the Data folder to your Skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Uninstall:[/size][/b]\r<br />Delete Real Traders.esp from the Skyrim/Data directory.\r<br />Delete Real Traders Folder in Data/Textures/Actors/Character/FaceGenData\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Known Bugs:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />-Dialogue [url=#]menu[/url] does not appear when you talk to them:\r<br />They are giving you or gifting you something. In witch case after the item is added you may interact with them.\r<br />\r<br />-Mouths are stuck open after [url=#]trading[img]http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png[/img][/url]:\r<br />This is a game glitch bug. Sometimes their mouths get stuck open after you [url=#]trade[img]http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png[/img][/url] with them. They usually say something right after witch fixes it.\r<br />It does [url=#]reset[/url] a few seconds after. (I like to think that there are shocked you bought or sold something to them, haha.)\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Troubleshooting:[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Simpy read ALL of this section to ensure you have everything down right, In witch if you do then go ahead and leave a comment about the problem.\r<br />\r<br />Possible and most likely errors:\r<br />\r<br />-Load order is your best friend. [url=#]Play[/url] around with it. Put it under other Npc mods. Download BOSS or LOOT to do it for you.\r<br />-Other mods that completely redesign the cities. Added trees and stuff to them is ok but a new ctiy form scratch could be evil.\r<br />-Make sure your not over loading on Skyrim with mods.\r<br />\r<br />When Traveling to another city game freezes, crashes or whatever.\r<br />[url=#]Again[img]http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png[/img][/url] most likely the load order or something to do with the city it self. Try to pin point the problem. Its not as hard as it sounds. Use Tes5Edit to find conflicts and BOSS or LOOT to sort your load order.\r<br />\r<br />When on the road game crashes.\r<br />I have never had this happen while running this mod. If your game does its most likely another mod.\r<br />\r<br />Other than the problems listed(under known bugs) this mod works just fine. As long as you know and care for your mods this should seamlessly merge in with your game world.\r<br />\r<br />Planned for the future:\r<br />\r<br />Real Pilgrims\r<br />Real Adventurers\r<br />Real Travelers\r<br />Real Treasure Hunters\r<br />Real Vampires & Vampire Hunters\r<br />Real Hunters(Maybe)\r<br />\r<br />Please check out my other mods&#33;\r<br />                   ||||\r<br />                   VVVV\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1354307/?tb=mods&pUp=1\r<br />\r<br />Version History:\r<br />\r<br />1.9:\r<br />Fixed some dialogue issues\r<br />Tweaked &#34;Bodyguard&#34; Packages\r<br />Tweaked Traders Gold list\r<br />Tweak Traders Hat list\r<br /> \r<br />1.8:\r<br />Initial Release\r<br />\r<br />[url=#]Thanks[img]http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png[/img][/url] a bunch for reading/downloading/endorsing\r<br />Enjoy&#33;",
