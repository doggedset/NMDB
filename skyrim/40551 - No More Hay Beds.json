  "descriptionHtml": "It\\'s so simple that I\\'m amazed it hasn\\'t been done.\r\n\r\nDo you hate straw beds? Cringe whenever you see one and lose the urge to sleep? Well, lose your sleep no more! No more hay beds, no sir. Noble beds for all.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple model replacer mod with no scripts - it should be safe to install or uninstall on any save. It changes the \\\"common\\\" and \\\"upperclass\\\" beds - both single and double, to \\\"noble\\\" beds. You know, the nice green ones that actually look somewhat fit for human use.\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, they\\'re color coded so you still know what\\'s \\\"really\\\" supposed to be there. Green is noble - that\\'s vanilla. Red is \\\"upperclass\\\" and blue violet is \\\"common.\\\"\r\n\r\nYep... you\\'re welcome.",
