It holds the crafting menu clean by not show the recipes that you do not have the materials to make. Except for the Basic Recipe,(1 ingot recipe) that one is always visible, so if you go to a smelter with enough ore to make 5 ingots, that recipe will be visible to use, when used the recipe disappear again to next time you have enough ores, It is Clean and handy :) \r\n\r\nCraftable Iron Lockpicks: \r\n============================= \r\nThis is a neat version who has only 1 crafting recipe in the menu that upgrades as you gain smithing perks. To craft them you need Iron ingot and charcoal.

The smelting recipe will only show in menu if You got The Needed Materials to Craft, And the recipe disappear after the materials is used, and appears again when its needed.
