  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve looked all over and have found multiple types of save files that all state that they&#39;re vanilla saves, and while they may be, I&#39;ve found that when loading them the save count is upwards of 300 or so. So, I&#39;ve gone through, removed every single mod of mine, even the DLC Hearthfire, Dragonborn and Dawnguard as well as the HighRes Texture Packs. The only esm&#39;s attached to this file are Skyrim.esm and Update.esm. This should allow far more people to use it right out of the gate, and if you&#39;re like me who gets annoyed by the save count being very large, Starts off as Save # 1",
