  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/45724-1-1382941385.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nA mod which aims to make hunting a much more profitable, viable and worthwhile experience. The prices of animal parts, and the amount of items each animal drops, have been significantly altered to provide a much more realistic experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Pelt Price Changes:[/b] The prices for pelts were pretty unrealistic. Pelts and furs in real life are quite valuable, and this wasn\\'t reflected in the game. These new prices give an incentive to hunt, and make hunting actually worth doing.\r\n\r\nBear Pelt: 50 -> 500\r\n\r\nCave Bear Pelt: 60 -> 600\r\n\r\nCow Hide: 10 -> 200\r\n\r\nDeer Hide: 10 -> 150\r\n\r\nFox Pelt: 5 -> 75\r\n\r\nGoat Hide: 5 -> 50\r\n\r\nHorse Hide: 15 -> 150\r\n\r\nIce Wolf Pelt: 15 -> 150\r\n\r\nSabre Cat Pelt: 25 -> 250\r\n\r\nSnow Bear Pelt: 75 -> 750\r\n\r\nSnow Fox Pelt: 7 -> 130\r\n\r\nSnowy Sabre Cat Pelt: 40 -> 400\r\n\r\nWerewolf Pelt: 20 -> 2000\r\n\r\nWolf Pelt: 10 -> 100\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Animal Part Price Changes:[/b] Again, these were unrealistically low. Although the price changes aren\\'t as drastic as the pelt changes, these alterations will increase your hunting experience.\r\n\r\nAntlers - Large: 2 -> 40\r\n\r\nAntlers - Small: 2 -> 30\r\n\r\nBear Claws: 2 -> 5\r\n\r\nHorker Tusk: 15 -> 150\r\n\r\nMammoth Tusk: 150 -> 1500\r\n\r\nMudcrab Chitin: 2 -> 10\r\n\r\nSabre Cat Tooth: 2 -> 15\r\n\r\nSlagutherfish Egg: 3 -> 7\r\n\r\nSlaughterfish Scales: 3 -> 5\r\n\r\nTroll Fat: 15 -> 30 (Weight changed from 1 to 0.5)\r\n\r\nDragon Bones: 500 -> 1500 (Weight dropped) [b]NEW[/b]\r\n\r\nDragon Scales: 250 -> 750 (Weight dropped) [b]NEW[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Animal Meat Price Changes:[/b]\r\n\r\nClam Meat: 1 -> 3\r\n\r\nChicken Breast: 3 -> 4\r\nGrilled Chicken Breast: 4 -> 6\r\n\r\nCharred Skeever Meat: 4 -> 3\r\n\r\nDog Meat: 3 -> 4\r\n\r\nLeg of Goat: 3 -> 14\r\nLeg of Goat Roast: 4 -> 20\r\n\r\nHorker Meat: 3 -> 12\r\nHorker Loaf: 4 -> 16\r\n\r\nHorse Meat: 3 -> 8\r\nHorse Haunch: 4 -> 12\r\n\r\nMammoth Snout: 6 -> 30\r\nMammoth Steak: 8 -> 40\r\n\r\nPheasant Breast: 3 -> 3\r\nPheasant Roast: 4 -> 5\r\n\r\nRaw Beef: 4 -> 8\r\nCooked Beef: 5-> 12\r\n\r\nRaw Rabbit: Leg 2 -> 6\r\nRabbit Haunch: 3 -> 8\r\n\r\nSalmon Meat: 3 -> 4\r\nSalmon Steak: 4 -> 6\r\n\r\nVenison: 4 -> 16\r\nVenison Chop: 5 -> 20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Animal Drop Changes[/b]: Most of the animal drops in the game just didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t make any sense at all. For example, for every Sabre Cat you kill you would get either 1 eye or 1 tooth, even though every cat has two of each. These changes are to correct such errors. These are the new additional drops:\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Tusks from every Horker\r\n\r\n2 Eyes and 2 Teeth from every Sabre Cat and Snowy Sabre Cat\r\n\r\n1-4 Sets of Bear claws from all types of Bear\r\n\r\n4 Tusks from each Mammoth\r\n\r\n1-3 Cups of Troll Fat from all types of Troll\r\n\r\n1-5 Sets of Scales from Slaughterfish\r\n\r\n7-10 Toes from each Giant (Weight reduced from 1 to 0.5)\r\n\r\n5-10 Feathers from each Hagraven\r\n\r\n10-14 Claws from each Hagraven\r\n\r\n6-10 Feathers from each Hawk\r\n\r\n[b]Meat:[/b]\r\n\r\n5 - 8 Pieces of Horker Meat from every Horker\r\n\r\n3 - 4 Pieces of beef from every cow\r\n\r\n3 - 4 Goat Legs from each Goat\r\n\r\n3 - 4 Pieces of venison from every Deer and Elk\r\n\r\n3 - 4 Pieces of Horse Meat from each Horse\r\n\r\n2 Pieces of Dog Meat from every Dog (because they are ribs)\r\n\r\n2 Breasts from each chicken\r\n\r\n2 Legs from each Rabbit (only for ones you kill, not hanging ones)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Notes:[/b]\r\n\r\n*Items gained from hanging dead animals (pheasants, salmon) are limited to 1 by the CK. Just think that if someone had already killed it then they probbably took some of the meat too!\r\n\r\n*Fixed the vanilla bugs relating to the death drops of horses and goats not calculating properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions for this mod, if you think I have missed anything or if you think the new prices are too high/low, tell me in the discussions below.\r\n\r\nAlso, the armour I am wearing is called the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/43649/?tab=1&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D43649%26preview%3D&pUp=1]Hunter Archer Armour[/url] and it can be found on the nexus.\r\n\r\n",
