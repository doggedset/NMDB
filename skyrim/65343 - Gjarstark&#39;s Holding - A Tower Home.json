  "summary": "A conversion of Riften Watchtower into a player home aimed for warriors and barbarians.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I discovered Riften Watchtower whilst out wandering in The Rift, and I found that I was rather intrigued by the whole structure. Seeing as I have a strong liking to player homes, I decided to give making my own a shot by converting the tower from a simple Orc lair into the home of a Nordic warlord and barbarian. This is my first attempt at modding for Skyrim, so it does not possess all the features that a more expertly-crafted home would. Regardless, I hope you enjoy using this simple tower as a home or outpost in your adventures in Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Oh, and the views from the top are simply amazing. There aren&#39;t any requirements for this mod besides the base version of Skyrim.",
