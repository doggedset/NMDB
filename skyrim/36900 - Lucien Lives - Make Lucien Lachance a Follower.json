  "modName": "Lucien Lives - Make Lucien Lachance a Follower",
  "summary": "Lucien Lachance lives again! This mod makes Lucien Lachance just like a regular follower - dialogue options and all.",
  "descriptionHtml": "==DESCRIPTION==\r\n\r\nYou can find the former Speaker of the Black Hand in the Dark Brotherhood sanctuary near Falkreath, usually lounging around somewhere in Astrid\\'s room. Just go up to him and tell him that you require his assistance, and he will become your follower.\r\n\r\nLucien comes equipped with Brotherhood robes and his very own Blade of Woe. He has voiced lines for most dialogue options related to followers, though he does not have an \\\"I need you to do something\\\" option (you can still tell him to do something by holding down the activate button while looking at him). He also retains all of his unique lines on locations you visit and comments on your current Dark Brotherhood quest. You can toggle these lines on and off by speaking with Lucien and selecting either \\\"I require silence, brother\\\" or \\\"Speak freely, brother.\\\"\r\n\r\nIn the future, I plan on making a unique quest in order to \\\"resurrect\\\" Lucien as your follower instead of just finding him in the sanctuary. If I can figure out how to do it, I may also give Lucien his own retextured Brotherhood robes to have instead of the ugly vanilla ones (in the mean time, why not take a look at some of the retextured Brotherhood armor/robes already on the Nexus? I recommend XunAmarox\\'s \\\"Dark Brotherhood Outfits Redone\\\" and USMCguy\\'s \\\"Dark Brotherhood new look\\\").\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you find any bugs or have any suggestions let me know and I\\'ll see what I can do!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: This mod does not alter the Summon Spectral Assassin power. The Spectral Assassin will still retain its ghost effect and will not work as a normal follower.\r\n\r\n==CHANGE LOG==\r\n\r\n--v1.1--\r\n-Added dialogue options for toggling Lucien\\'s comments on and off.",
