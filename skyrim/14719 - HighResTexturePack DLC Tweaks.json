  "descriptionHtml": "[color=cyan]HighResTexturePack DLC Tweaks[/color] \r\nby Eiwyn\r\n\r\nThis mod is a collection of minor tweaks for Bethesda\\'s HighResTexturePack DLC. It is NOT part of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8236]HD Textures DLC Fix[/url], but it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]Female Blades Armor fix[/color] \r\nThe texture for female Blades armor has a faulty alpha channel. It makes ugly tears appear in the back and it gives the fur belt hard unnatural edges. This mod fixes that by giving you a corrected 2048 texture. The alpha channel has been rotated, resized and moved so that it now gives a good fluffy edge to the fur belt again, and no tears of course.\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]Daedric Shield fix[/color]\r\nThe missing specular map gave the Daedric shield a chrome-like shine. It stood out from all other Daedric items. To fix this, the specular map from the vanilla low-res files where copied to the alpha channel of the normal vector file. The diffuse map was not changed, meaning the shield have same colors as the vanilla shield, but with higher resolution.\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]Female Ancient Nord Boots fix[/color] \r\nThe female Ancient Nord boots also missed a specular map. This makes the boots very shiny. Perhaps Aela polished her boots with werewolf spit? The old vanilla specular map has been copied and resized, and the boots looks dry again.\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]Orcish Quiver and Arrows fix[/color] \r\nThe texture and normal files for vanilla Orcish quiver and arrows are identical to the files used by the Orcish bow. It\\'s strange that the developers did not use just one set of files, rather than duplicating them. The HighResTexturePack contained a better texture for the Orcish bow, but there was no new texture for the Orcish quiver and arrows. The new 1024 bow texture and normal map has been copied and renamed so that they work for the quiver and arrows. This gives you twice the resolution for the Orcish quiver and arrows.\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]Male Glass Armor fix[/color] \r\nThe texture for male Glass armor has a faulty alpha channel, both in the vanilla 1024 and the HighResTexturePack 2048 textures. It looks as if it belongs to a completely different texture. It serves no purpose, but it\\'s loaded to your video ram every time there is a male glass cuirass nearby. This mod contain the exact same 2048 texture from the HighResTexturePack, but compressed as DXT1 without alpha channel. You will not see any change in game, but you will know that you are not wasting video ram on useless junk. Size before 5462 kb, size after 2731 kb.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]Installation:[/color] \r\nCopy the Textures folder into your Skyrim\\\\Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#00FF00\\\"]HighResTexturePack DLC cleaner[/color]\r\nThis is for advanced users. It\\'s a command file that helps you build very nice, clean and smaller BSAs for the HighResTexturePack, by removing hundreds of junk files and inserting the files from this mod and other places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i48.tinypic.com/jpc6yg.jpg[/img]\r\n[color=cyan]Try my other mod:[/color] [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14385]Prisoner Clothes and Rags for CBBEv3 bodyslide CHSBHC BBP[/url]\r\n",
