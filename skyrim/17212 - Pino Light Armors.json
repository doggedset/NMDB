  "summary": "Chainmail armors to fill the gap between leather and elven. A mailshirt and a full set including chainmail pants and mail gloves. Man/Women, world models, weight.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I don\\'t really like golden elven material, so I created those sets of steel mail to play light with some realistic armor. You\\'ll find here 2 models : a mail shirt model and a full mail with the pants. I also added mailed gloves.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod and I used it to train with CK and skyrim texturing.\r\nIt\\' is a part of a more global project leading to replace elven and glass light armors and to add new realisatic armors to the game.\r\nAs it is my first mod, I apologize for the bugs, even if I tested it a lot and didn\\'t find any.\r\n\r\nInstallation :\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nJust drop the content of the 7zip file into your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\nThe mod contains 2 esp. One is english version, the other is french version. Be careful to activate only one of those esps.\r\n\r\nHelp needed :\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nAt this point, I require help to the community to set the armor in the leveled lists.\r\nI need help also to find a now nif model for hauberk style armor, with a tunic slightly longer than the model I used tor there armors (merchant ones).\r\nThanks in advance for the help.\r\n\r\nTextures can be used freely as you credit me.\r\nMeshes by Croc. Look at his fantastic mod at http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13462\r\n\r\nUpdate list :\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nv1.0 : 05/17/2012\r\n- Steel mail shirt and trousers, male and female\r\n- Steel mail gloves\r\n\r\nv1.1 : 05/18/2012\r\n- Added Steel mail hauberk male/female\r\n- Added Ysgramor armor style (craftable only)\r\n- Added steel mail armors to leveled lists (without enchantments)",
