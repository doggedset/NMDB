  "modName": "Kileena Follower and new Morg Race",
  "summary": "Here\\'s Kileena, a gentle yet fearsome Morg from a long forgotten race of skilled Archers and master thieves. Her race is now ready to fight the dovah. Playable race too.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Here\\'s a  lvl 35, gentle female companion by the name of Kileena. She\\'s a master archer and ready to help fend off any attacker you may encounter. The Morg are now available to the player in showracemenu, females only at the moment. Her inventory consists of almost the bare minimum so pretty much whatever you equip her with she\\'ll wear/use. She also has the Bandit Fire, Frost, Shock spells. She can be found in Riverwood\\'s Sleeping Giant Inn. The armor sh is wearing IS NOT what she comes in.\r\n\r\nThanks for the facial textures from Better Females by Bella for the gorgeous work and also to apachii for the awesome hair styles in ApachiiSkyHair.\r\n\r\nRequired files..............\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url] is required.\r\n\r\nInstall either with NMM or just extract into the skyrim data folder.\r\nNOTE:\r\nThis is just version 1 so any feed back would be GREATLY appreciated! I plan on working on the males next and maybe add another follower(male) too. The textures are just a first draft, so that will be worked on too. Like I said, any thought, recommendation and/or tips are welcome and I\\'ll try to respond as quickly as possible if you have any issues with the mod.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nv2 - Fixed MANY issues, Imperial bodies no longer share Morg body plus a quite a few other minor details.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
