  "descriptionHtml": "Updates at the bottom - Renamed it from Dragonbone - Retextured to current title\r<br />------------------------\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve been wanting to retexture these for a long time, and I finally was able to do so. I&#39;ve looked around and didn&#39;t see any other mods that make it like mine, but if there are let me know. This also makes everything else around the weapon darker. \r<br />\r<br />The craftable version right now includes the weapons and dragonbone armor. I&#39;ll add the dragonscale later today. ---[b]KEEP in mind that when you craft normal &gt; polished, it will take away the weapon along with the enchantments[/b]. If anyone knows a way I can keep the enchantments, let me know. \r<br />\r<br />The second file replaces the default, and does not add the polished dragon bone. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\r<br />I believe you can just use the NMM to download and install. The files will be placed in the data folder, and will merge correctly. \r<br />\r<br />Or, just drop the the folder into your data folder and it&#39;ll work out. \r<br />\r<br />[b]To craft:[/b]\r<br />Go to your favorite forge and go to the dragon tab, and it should be towards the bottom. It will take the respective dragon weapon or armor, as well as void salts. Some goes for tempering. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Issues:[/b]\r<br />If there are any issues, let me know. I know I had a hell of a time trying to make this work. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Updates:[/b]\r<br />[b]1.4][/b] - Added a file that replaces the textures like normal, and adds void salts to the default crafting recipe.\r<br />[b]1.4[/b] - Polished Dragonbone is now craftable\r<br />[b]1.3[/b] - Added the Dragonscale armor.\r<br />[b]1.2[/b] - Added the scabbard \r<br />[b]1.1[/b] - Toned down the shield so it isn&#39;t as white. Going to do the same with a few of the weapons. \r<br />[b]1.1[/b] - Added full set of armor, added one main file that contains both armor and weapons, as well as two optional files that only the armor and weapons, respectively. \r<br />[b]1.0[/b] - working on the armor.
