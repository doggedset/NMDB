Support for every potion, poison, ingredient, and food item that exists!\n<br />\n<br />[color=DeepSkyBlue][b][color=#313131]                   [/color][/b]* [/color]Set potion, poison, ingredient, &amp; food effects to last for any duration that you would like. Usually\n<br />                      there is some tradeoff - increase duration, and the strength of effects lowers slightly, &amp; vice-versa. Certain\n<br />                      limits have been added to prevent completely overpowered settings, but the possibilities are pretty wide.\n<br />[color=#4d4d4d]                      (there's also a secret way to completely \"unlock\" these limits, hidden in the MCM menu, if you can find it)[/color]\n<br />[color=DeepSkyBlue]  \n<br />                   * [/color]Full support for all Vanilla and DLC potions, ingredients, and food (but no DLCs required to use the mod).\n<br />[color=DeepSkyBlue]\n<br />                   * [/color]Full support for new potions, ingredients, and food items [i]added by any other mod![/i]\n<br />[color=DeepSkyBlue]\n<br />                   * [/color]Ultimate potions &amp; The White Phial's restore effect are untouched by the mod, both still heal you instantly.\n<br />[color=DeepSkyBlue]\n<br />                   * [/color]For Restore-type effects, if an item's total strength is less than the duration you've set, it will have a\n<br />                      shorter duration. Horker Meat is an example: Even with Restore Health for food set to 60 seconds,\n<br />                      since Horker Meat only restores 5 health points, it only lasts 5 seconds, healing one point per second.\n<br />[color=DeepSkyBlue]\n<br />                   * [/color]Note: settings are not saved in your savegame file due to engine limitations, but all your settings\n<br />                      will be restored to your preferences within 2-3 seconds after loading the savefile.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/b][color=DeepSkyBlue][b]                               ~~ [/b][/color]Check out all the screenshots to get a better sense of how the menu &amp; options work!

The mod takes 2-3 minutes to install in game,\n<br />        A message will appear in the upper left corner of your screen when the mod has finished installing.\n<br />[color=DeepSkyBlue]\n<br />     * [/color]Easy Uninstallation through the MCM menu.\n<br />[color=DeepSkyBlue]\n<br />     * [/color]For the best experience, install Dynamic Potions [i]at the same time or later than[/i] all other mods that\n<br />        change potion/food/ingredient effects. DP will base many future decisions on the effects as they\n<br />        exist when it is first installed. (You can always reinstall it to force the re-evaluation of effects)\n<br />[color=DeepSkyBlue]\n<br />     * [/color]This mod should be compatible with anything, even other potion/alchemy mods. (However, DP will not\n<br />        change RnD food effects, since they are customized. You can probably trick DP into altering them\n<br />        though, by installing Dynamic Potions first on a save that hasn't seen RnD, and then installing RnD after.)\n<br />[color=DeepSkyBlue]\n<br />     * [/color]There is an Item Tracking option in the mod's MCM menu, which I recommend enabling if you are using\n<br />        any mods that add new items to the game. It will enable a very lightweight script that recognizes any\n<br />        new items you pick up. This will not have any noticeable impact on your gameplay. If you leave this\n<br />        option turned off, the mod will not be running any scripts at all during normal gameplay.\n<br />[color=DeepSkyBlue]\n<br />     * [/color]If you are playing with other mods that alter durations or other attributes of particular items, and \n<br />        would like to keep those settings, just disable those particular sliders in the Dynamic Potions\n<br />        menu. Dynamic potions will not make any changes to items whose sliders are disabled in the MCM.\n<br />[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#882fdd]          Special thanks to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2618334/?tb=mods&amp;pUp=1]Hypno[/url] for designing the old v2 MCM logo![/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#882fdd]          You may like my other mod: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/42796]Enchanting Awakened[/url][/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/47521-1-1384976103.jpg[/img]",

All potions should now maintain the same exact price no matter what settings you choose for duration, power, or anything else. (unless of course you adjust their prices in the MCM)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 3.11\r<br />==============\r<br />The stacking options in 3.1 did not work because I forgot to rename a few important functions. (you may have noticed a few log errors because of this, but they&#39;re nothing to worry about). Downloading 3.11 will retroactively fix the problem and properly enable stacking options.\r<br />\r<br />While I was at it, I also fixed the issue where loading old preset files from the previous version would give you an error message - they should load without any errors now.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 3.1\r<br />==============\r<br />* You can now toggle whether every type of effect is stackable or non-stackable\r<br />* You can now completely customize the price of potions, poisons, food, and ingredients using a unique formula\r<br />* I have fixed crafted potions so that they will remember their weight correctly. (Only affects new ones you create)\r<br />* This means the &#34;scale crafted potion weight to level&#34; feature now works as intended, changing gradually over time\r<br />* MASSIVE speed improvements. We&#39;re talking like, 98.5% faster than previous. Everything is utterly instantaneous, scripts only run the first 2-3 seconds after you load a save.\r<br />* The performance increase is because I learned to shift a lot of the work over to an SKSE plugin (SKSE 1.7.0 now required)\r<br />* Unofficial Skyrim Patch Changes properly integrated into the mod now (Poison Resist now applies to a few more effects)\r<br />* Fixed White Phial &#34;0 seconds&#34; description error.\r<br />* Make sure to update FISS if using presets, I took out the code that prevented buggy behavior with older FISS versions.\r<br />* Probably some other stuff I&#39;m forgetting was also fixed. <br/> \n",
