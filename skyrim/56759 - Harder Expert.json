  "summary": "Makes Expert difficulty a bit harder so you don&#39;t have to take that jump to master if you don&#39;t feel like it",
  "descriptionHtml": "i&#39;ve found expert too easy, i&#39;m too adjusted to it, but master is annoying to me with the long combat and sometimes ridiculous enemies that can one shot you with something that isn&#39;t even their specialty (ex: a mage with an axe). I made this mod for myself so that i could have a challenge without having to run around and kite any enemy that is higher than average for an entire fight.\r<br />\r<br />Damage By Player decreased to x.65 from the default x.75\r<br />\r<br />Damage to player Increased from x1.5 to x1.6\r<br />\r<br />The normal damage scales are this \r<br />\r<br />         \r<br />                Damage by player   |   Damage to player\r<br />\r<br />Novice             x2                   |         x.5\r<br />Apprentice       x1.5                |         x.75\r<br />Adept              x1                   |         x1\r<br />Expert             x.75                |         x1.5\r<br />Master            x.5                   |        x2\r<br />Legendary       x.25                 |        x3\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />ALTERNATELY\r<br />This is where i learned how to do this, it&#39;s very simple and recommended if you want to customize a difficulty.\r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42352/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Hope you have a fun time playing :D\r<br />\r<br />I recommend deadly combat in place of this mod, but if you&#39;re like i was when i made this mod and you don&#39;t want to both overhauling the combat system then go nuts with this mod. also have fun :D\r<br />\r<br />Deadly Combat mod\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5485/?",
