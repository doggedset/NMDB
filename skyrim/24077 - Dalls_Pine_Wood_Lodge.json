  "descriptionHtml": "---README---\r\n\r\nfor DALLs - Pine_Wood_Lodge\r\n\r\nv2.0\r\n\r\n23/09/2012\r\n\r\nPine_Wood_Lodge is multi-category mod which does more then one thing. It beside Main Quest provides new (world) location with Nordic Hunting Lodge (PC Home), new followers, horses and skill trainers, new arms n armor, new textures (leather armors n spiked shield) and lore-friendly extension of Dragonborn story.  \r\n\r\nStoryline is based on main Skyrim premise of you being Dragonborn - by Gods chosen - mankind saviour. As main game, mostly, forgets on that - you might be interested to know that there is now at least one place where you are really seen and revered as something out of ordinary - namely as last of The Chosen Ones. But as nice things never come free - you will be asked for help. Namely Dragonrend - your Lodge hosts - have a problem only real Dragonborn with his unique abilities can resolve. You will need to get world rid of one Ancient and apparently very evil Dragon patriarch. \r\n\r\nIf successful you will have chance to win for yourself unique Amor-set which used to belong to Legendary (Drenai Dragonrend) Hero - Druss - The Axeman. Normally his (black n silver leather) armor without his legendary (demon-possessed) Axe - Snaga would be very incomplete so you will get this double-bladed hell-axe as well. And if you have not heard of him check, David Gemmell\\'s The Drenai novels. \r\n\r\nLocation Northwest coastal mountains (map top left) near Pinefrost Tower and above (Orc settlement) Mor Khazgur.\r\n\r\nPine Wood Lodge is supplied with only - to this mod - directly related files. It can n will use whatever you already have in your (game) Data folder but that is not how it should be! Use it - if you care to see it as intended - with rest of my (pre-made HD) textures - which can be found in my other (Dalls_\\\"whatever\\\") stand-alone mods.\r\n\r\nRecommended additions: \r\n\r\nBlack_Iron\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22992\r\n\r\nDraugr\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6645\r\n\r\nDraugr_n_Nord_Hero_Weapons\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3986\r\n\r\nEbony_Weapons\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5500\r\n\r\nNord_Steel\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1247\r\n\r\nNoble_Furniture\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7564\r\n \r\nAlchemy_Workbench\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7866\r\n \r\nArcane_Enchanter \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4332\r\n\r\nCooking_Spit_n_Real_Fire\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8068\r\n\r\nSkyrim_Faces_NPCs\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18760\r\n\r\nSkyrim_Hair\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4496\r\n\r\nSkyrim_Nords\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/973 \r\n\r\nTo install you need to navigate to your Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim - game folder and paste / drag n drop in it my Data (mod) folder. Allow overwrite!    \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like this mod, simply delete / remove my mod .esp (plug-in) as well as (check for names my unpacked mod) files from Data/meshes/ DallsGear together with textures from Data/textures/DallsGear - and original look will be restored to your game.\r\n\r\nBugs/conflicts: none known\r\n\r\nNote on v2.0: Big Dungeon Quest added together with Druss The Legend arms n armor. If upgrading from v1.0 remember to start from some other then Pine Wood Lodge location / save made somewhere else.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and try to remember - if you like it even in a part - to give endorsement! \r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for really great game.\r\nPS. Is this mod worth your time? If you can still think for yourself and you are not afraid to try something else a bit more complicated and deeper layered - not found or represented in Nexus Top 100s mod shallows at all - it definitely is! I have been making game extending and retexture overhaul mods for last fifteen years - arguably quite successfully - which makes them all at least worth experimental try. In practice they represent - ten or more of single-purpose / different categories mods squeezed in one (DLC like) package. They were made to be permanent extensions n additions to my own game thus, they are safe n eminently useable but if not wanted - they and their content are very easy to remove without any harmful consequences to your saves.  If interested in other / similar (large-scale / multi-category) mods try - (my) Temple, Arch_Mages_Tower, Proudspire_Castle and Princess.\r\n",
