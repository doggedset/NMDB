  "descriptionHtml": "So I\\'ve pretty much always played a breton or a norn, I never really liked the non-human races.\r\nBut one day I swallowed my pride and made a Dark Elf, Erinana.\r\nAnd I love her a lot, I\\'m very happy with how she looks, and it\\'s a lot of fun seeing the game from another races eyes (especially in Windhelm).\r\n\r\nWhich is why Erinana starts out on the docks of Windhelm.\r\nShe\\'s a Dark elf who came to Windhelm by ship in search of a better life, but she was appaled surprised with how the city treats her and her kind.\r\n\r\nThis saved gme is supposed to be a role-playing character. \r\nI play this game with the Requiem mod ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19281 ) and i highly reccomend it to everyone who wants to play Skyrim as a true RPG.\r\nI also use Alternate start - Live another life (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9557 ) and Character Creation Overhaul ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21587 ) both great mods you should all try out.\r\n\r\nThe mods I\\'ve used to make Erinana look like she does is; \r\n\r\nBrows ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30411 )\r\nEthereal Elven Overhaul ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24273 )\r\nMature skin texture and body for UNP ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32986 )\r\nDIMONIZED UNP ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709 )\r\nPretty Lips ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1167 )\r\nThe Eyes of Beauty ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722 )\r\nApachiiSkyHair ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168 )\r\n\r\nAs you can see a lot of mods are used on her, and I have no idea how she would look if you tried playing her without them, so if you want to use my save game. \r\nPlease install all the above mentioned mods, for your own enjoyment :) ",
