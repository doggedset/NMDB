  "summary": "Added 10 pts damage of Mora&#39;s Agony and increased the charges to match Dawnbreaker.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Miraak&#39;s sword now does what it should have done in the vanilla game in my oppinion&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve added Mora&#39;s Agony enchantment to the sword so it does 10 pts of poison damage now. Has same effect as Miraak&#39;s staff except the sword applies it on hit and is weaker then the staff enchantment. I didn&#39;t want to make it overpowered since Miraak&#39;s sword already is awesome. I just wanted the visual effect of the tenacles.\r<br />\r<br />It still has absorb 15 pts stamina which is the only showing description in-game. So the sword does absorbs 15 pts stamina + 10 pts poison damage on each hit.\r<br />\r<br />I also increased charges to 5000 (Same as Dawnbreaker) and changed Value to match Daedric sword.\r<br />\r<br />Additionally i made all 3 versions of the sword the same, so no matter when you get it it will have the same damage, enchantment and charges.",
