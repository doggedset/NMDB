  "modName": "Loot Sack",
  "summary": "Gives you a droppable sack to carry your loot!",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]I'm always torn between the immersion of the realistic carrying weight mods and the inconvenience of them. While jugging across Skyrim with 3 full suit of plate armor and 5 greatswords certainly isn't realistic, making repeated loot runs between a bandit camps and the nearest city gets old fast.\n<br />\n<br />So what is a smart advanturer to do? Well, why not just grab a sack and throw all those loot in, if you need to fight, drop the sack and pull out your axe.\n<br />\n<br />That, my friends, is exactly what this mod does. A droppable sack. Upon installing the mod, you'll get an item call Loot Sack in your inventory. When you draw your weapon or press 'B', you'll drop the sack. The sack can be activated like any normal container. Press B again when you are within arms reach, will pick the sack up, press B if you a bit farther but still within sight will open the sack instead. Check screenshots for the maxium distance that you can still open the sack with hotkey.\n<br />\n<br />An added bonus is a quest named Loot Sack will also be in your journal, you can toggle quest marker on to find your sack more easily.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#e06666]VERSION 3 RELEASED:[/color][/u][/b]\n<br />new features:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Added a gradually increasing speed penalty to discourage putting the entire world in your sack.\n<br />[*]Disable or fine-tune in MCM\n<br />[/list]Tweaks:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Items with 0 weight now won't automatically be looted into sack\n<br />[*]Items mark as non-playable won't automatically be looted into sack (like Requiem's invisible arrow weight)\n<br />[*]Added MCM option to delete everything from your sack.
