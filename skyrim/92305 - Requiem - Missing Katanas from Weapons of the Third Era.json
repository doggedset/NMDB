  "modName": "Requiem - Missing Katanas from Weapons of the Third Era",
  "summary": "Requiem includes some of the katanas from Weapons of the Third Era, but not all of them. This mod adds the rest, including the two-handed and Daedric ones.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is basically my updated version of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/85222?]Silver Nodachi[/url]. Weapons of the Third Era is free use now, so I took the katanas that Requiem declined to include and made them standalone.\n<br />\n<br />There is no distribution, but everything is craftable and temperable. Stats have been tweaked for balance and consistency.  Crafting and tempering requirements have been changed for full Requiem compatibility (no Advanced Craftsmanship requirement for tempering enchanted gear) and consistency with stated weapon material. Weapons have been given their correct WeapMaterialKeywords for their stated weapon materials, so silver will wreck the undead and daedric will wreck everything.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Added by this mod:[/b]\n<br />Daedric Nodachi\n<br />Silver Nodachi\n<br />Steel Nodachi\n<br />Iron Nodachi\n<br />Daedric Katana (Requiem already includes the steel, silver, and iron katanas; their stats have been standardized as shown below)\n<br />Daedric Wakizashi\n<br />Silver Wakizashi\n<br />Steel Wakizashi\n<br />Iron Wakizashi\n<br />Daedric Tanto\n<br />Silver Tanto (Requiem already includes the steel and iron tantos; their stats have been standardized as shown below)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Stat comparisons for steel weapons:\n<br />[/b]Requiem greatsword: 0.75 speed, 0.91 reach, 102 damage, 17 weight\n<br />Nodachi: 0.87 speed, 0.84 reach, 96 damage, 16 weight\n<br />Requiem sword: 1.0 speed, 0.7 reach, 48 damage, 10 weight\n<br />Katana: 1.1 speed, 0.735 reach, 60 damage, 8 weight\n<br />Wakizashi: 1.2 speed, 0.56 reach, 48 damage, 7 weight\n<br />Tanto: 1.4 speed, 0.49 reach, 36 damage, 3 weight\n<br />Requiem dagger: 1.3 speed, 0.49 reach, 30 damage, 2.5 weight\n<br />\n<br />The reach and speed stats are the same for each weapon of the given type, while damage and weight vary by tier, but are similarly comparable to vanilla weapons of the same tier. Yes, katanas are better than regular swords, but there are no intermediate tiers of them, and they're actually better by an even larger margin in vanilla Requiem.  The silver katana was also bizarrely much better than the steel katana, having among other things a longer reach, and this fixes that.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements:  \n<br />[/b]Requiem is required. Any version should work, though this was developed on 1.9.4.\n<br />Weapons of the Third Era is NOT required, and will in fact give you duplicates of all these weapons with different stats and crafting recipes, so don't use that.\n<br />\n<br /> This is made for personal use, shared here because 747823's permissions allow.  I don't expect anyone to actually use this, but I thought I'd provide the option.  In my game I have the nodachis distributed to bandits and all non-daedric weapons potentially for sale at Morrowind-related vendors (Brend Shei, Sandri, people on Solstheim), but that's tied up in a personal leveled list file with a dozen random masters, so you probably don't want that and I'm not going to bother doing compatiblized distribution for a personal mod.",
