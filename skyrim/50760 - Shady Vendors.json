  "summary": "Small forum request which makes Revyn Sadri, Belethor, and the Khajit caravans buy stolen goods and have some additional coin.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Not much to say, I saw a request on the forums and thought it would be fun to execute. This mod makes Revyn Sadri and Belethor buy stolen goods, and adds VendorGoldFenceStageXX (where XX is 00-04) to their chests, and to the Khajit caravan chests for good measure. This makes them all have more monies. I&#39;m too tired for a proper description. This mod adds a shocking 8 records changes, and 6 of those are dirty. KIDDING. Load anywhere after anything else that affects merchant chests and/or services factions. Or not. You know how records work in Skyrim&#39;s game engine, right? Requires skyrim.esm and update.esm in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />If you have suggestions for more Shady Vendorsâ„¢, post a comment, and if it sounds reasonable and I have some time, I&#39;ll add it. \r<br />\r<br />Request thread: [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/1372874-sadri-belethor-and-perhaps-others/]Forum thread[/url]",
