Only joking!\r\n\r\nIntroducing the new [color=orange]Wabbajack[/color] with [color=green1]more crazy effects[/color] on enemies, people and a chicken named Dave. \r\n\r\n[size=3][color=green1]New effects[/color][/size] include:\r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size]Turn to [color=green1]ghost[/color]\r\n\t>>Simple as it sounds turn to ghost flee for for 30 secs and then turns to ghost \tremains when dies. \r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size]Make [color=green1]ethereal[/color]\r\n\t>>This is essentially taken from the Ethereal shout\r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size]Cause them to [color=green1]attack everyone[/color]\r\n\t>>Uses the fury spell, it will affect all beings at all levels.\r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size][color=green1]Force Push (up/away)[/color]\r\n\t>>Uses the pushactoraway commands to blow characters vertically up or away from \tyou at different strengths. Level of force applied is random. I\\'ve done a script so the \tforce applied affects the amount of damage caused.  \r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size][color=green1]Remove Clothes and all items [/color](doesn\\'t work against children, I know you were thinking it)\r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size]Change [color=green1]body size[/color]\r\n\t>>Randomly increases or decreases body size (uses the setscale command) from 0.1 \tto 2 times the original size.\r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size]Turn into ghost remains and spawn [color=green1]skooma[/color]\r\n\t>>Like spawn sweetroll but for skooma, oo skooma, yeh skooma give me more, \tmore.. ahem sorry\r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size]Change their [color=green1]running/walking speed[/color] (really slow/really fast)\r\n\t>>Uses the speedmult command to change walking/running speed to either 10 \twhich makes them really slow or to 1000 which makes them really fast\r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size]Cause [color=green1]unconsciousness/paralysis[/color]\r\n\t>>This takes the paralysis spell but also pushes them slightly and uses the \tunconscious command to make them fall asleep, you can do anything to them at this point, and I mean anything and they won\\'t do anything to you when they wake up.\r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size][color=green1]Transmogrify[/color]/turn into something else ([color=aqua]Dragon, Werewolf, Giant, Maiq the liar or Cicero[/color])\r\n\t>>Uses the same concept as turning them into chickens, rabbits and dremora i.e. \tchange occurs for a set while, attacking them changes them back.\r\n\t>>Maiq is equipped with a daedric dagger \r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size]Cause [color=green1]random teleportation[/color]\r\n\t>>This causes them to teleport if hit by you or anyone randomly 10 times around \tyou. There is a limit to how far they teleport based on your position. They will \tcontinue to do this when they are hit, until they die. \r\n\t>>This is in alpha at the moment have a look at this and tell me if its a good idea or if I need to change aspects of it.\r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size]Increased amount of [color=green1]gold[/color] spawned when turned to ghost remains\r\n\t>>This is not a new effect as such, this just adds to the amount of gold spawned.\r\n[color=orange][b]Update 1 to version 2 - 16/03/2012[/b][/color]\r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size][color=green1]Storm call[/color] spell with 4 different versions - at effect start the sky will change, it will rain and either [color=aqua]fiery daedric daggers[/color], [color=aqua]fiery daedric arrows[/color], [color=aqua]fireballs[/color] or [color=aqua]fiery CHEESES[/color] will rain down at the character the wabbajack was used on.

Sky will revert back and rain will stop when effect ends after 30 secs.\r\n[color=orange][b]Update 2 to version 3 - 19/03/2012[/b][/color]\r\n[size=4][color=orange]>[/color][/size]Another [color=green1]Storm call[/color] spell with 4 different versions - the same as spells in update 1 but instead of attacks from the sky attacks will spawn between you and the character, and fire at them.\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=green1]Other changes:[/color][/size]\r\n >The wabbajack will now affect giants, damn hippies, meaning that you won\\'t just get the fire/frost/lightning attacks in vanilla, but get all the effects. However, I did not do this for dragons because then that would be too easy wouldn\\'t it.\r\n>Chance of getting elemental attacks (frost/fire/lightning) has been changed from 50% down to 20% so you get more of other effects.\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][size=5]Videos[/size][/color]\r\nBelow are the videos that show the Wabbajack new effects.\r\n\r\n[b]More effects showcase parts 1+2 -[/b]\r\nVideo shows all the new effects of the mod individually. Normally the wabbajack has a number of effects but the video was made using the wabbajack with single/few effects at a time.\r\n\r\n[youtube]qNEcBYJRQ7s[/youtube]\r\n[b]Wabbajack Unleashed - More effects showcase - Part 1[/b]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nPart 1 includes:\r\n[color=green1]Spawn more gold[/color] - 0:14-1:03\r\n[color=green1]Force Push (up/away)[/color] - 1:04-2:01\r\n[color=green1]Remove Clothes[/color] - 2:02-3:39\r\n[color=green1]Transmogrify (Dragon,Giant, Werewolf, Cicero or Maiq)[/color] - 3:40-5:01\r\n[color=green1]Make unconscious/paralyze[/color] - 5:02-6:11\r\n[color=green1]Make invinsible[/color] - 6:12-6:29\r\n\r\n[youtube]VA9EElxXtUM[/youtube]\r\n[b]Wabbajack Unleashed - More effects showcase - Part 2[/b]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nPart 2 includes:\r\nTurn into skooma - 0:21-1:12\r\nMakes characters attack everyone - 1:13-2:37\r\nChange bodysize - 2:38-4:08\r\nTurn into ghost - 4:09-5:33\r\nChange walking/running speed - 5:35-6:15\r\nCause random teleportation - 6:16-6:48\r\n\r\n[color=tomato][size=4]Problems[/color][/size]\r\n>For Force Push I have made so there is a damage effect based on the amount of force applied. This doesn\\'t occur when the character hits the ground, but occurs when they are in the air because the pushactoraway command seems to not reduce health or kill on ground impact for some reason. Also sometimes the effect will not occur so I scripted it so they become staggered which is better than them just standing there.\r\n\r\n>The Random Teleportation effect is in alpha so I need feedback to tell me what I need to do to change it to make it better or do something else.\r\n\r\n>For Turn to Ghost effect sometimes on death they don\\'t turn to ghost remains and look tranparent on the ground, and also they seem perfectly fine coping with being ghosts  when they are not being attacked which is a bit weird.\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][size=4]Future Plans[/color][/size]\r\n>Add a new effect that makes people dance. I need permission from the original author probably and I\\'m having a problem with adding the dance animations rather than just replacing them. Also the dance animation doesnt work on those that have packages, e.g. patrol, that makes them walk around which prevent the animation from occurs. Not sure how to get around this at the moment.\r\n\r\n>Make characters slow down like the Slow Time shout but only cast so the target character slows down. I been having problems with this, any ideas?\r\n\r\n>I want to make the Force Push Away like unrelenting force so that it flows more.\r\n\r\n>Greybeard teach word. Ever wanted to engrave things on the ground for fun like the greybeards do yes so do I, its kinda coll but I have no idea how to.\r\n\r\n>Spawn around target a number of random things like fruit, weapons, rabbits, etc.\r\n\r\n>Freeze them\r\n\r\n>Make duplicates after a few seconds which only stops if you kill them all.\r\n\r\nSuggestions would be very helpful, so would cheese which can be transferred via to my swiss cheese account.\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][size=5]Versions[/size][/color]\r\n1. [color=gold]Wabba-New[/color]\r\nThis is the new style of the wabbajack which, as seen in the video, shoot out a wave that affects all the people in the wave. \r\n\r\n2. [color=gold]Wabba-Original[/color]\r\nThis is the original pink ball that is shot out of the wabbajack. This is the only difference between this version and the new one.\r\n\r\n[color=aqua][size=5]Installation[/size][/color]\r\n1.
