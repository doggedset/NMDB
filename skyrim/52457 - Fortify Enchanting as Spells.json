  "descriptionHtml": "As stated above, this mod enables you to cast Fortify Enchanting as four different Alteration spells. All of the Spell Tomes can be bought from Tolfdir at the College of Winterhold. Why four spells you might ask. Well, for different Alteration levels: Apprentice (Lvl 25), Adept (Lvl 50), Expert (Lvl 75), and Master (Lvl 100).  Apprentice buff is 10% better for 3 minutes (180 seconds). Adept is 25% for 2 minutes (120 seconds). Expert is 50% for 1 minute (60 seconds). And Master is 75% for 45 seconds. All of the spells can be dual-cast, which doubles their effect. While this can make some pretty awesome gear, it can also basically make you nearly unkillable. So please, show some restraint on the dual-casts if being god-like isn&#39;t your style. Not sure if this is considered non-lore-friendly or not, but it will be marked as not to avoid confusion. Questions? Comments? Found a bug? Report it in the comments&#33;",
