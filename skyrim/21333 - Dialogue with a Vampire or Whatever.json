  "summary": "Sick of people having no idea what race you are (or were) just because of your little \\\"drinking problem\\\"? This might help!",
  "descriptionHtml": "PLEASE NOTE: This mod was created with the 1.7 patch! I have NO IDEA if it works with 1.6 or not. Sorry!\r\n\r\nMy First Upload! Mild Spoilers Ahead...\r\n\r\nSo! What\\'s the mod do? It changes some of the NPC dialogue so that your (insert original race here) vampire will be recognized as an (insert original race here) by NPCs.\r\n\r\nExamples!\r\n\r\n-Amren of Whiterun will recognize if you\\'re a Nord or Redguard, despite being a bit on the pale side!\r\n\r\n-Brunwulf Free-Winter of Windhelm (and a bunch of guards) should see that you\\'re a fellow Nord, despite your freaky glowing eyes!\r\n\r\n-Those Fantastic Racist Stormcloaks and Thalmor will use the appropriately inappropriate racial slurs and taunts on your vampire! Joyous day! Like you really needed a reason to kill them...\r\n\r\nPlease note: This will NOT change the aggro you\\'ll get when you\\'re starving. It only changes your being recognized as a member of the race you were before you were turned in most dialogues!\r\n\r\nAlso, I mmmmmay have snuck in a few other dialogue modifications. Like getting rid of that \\\"fur in your ears\\\" comment, and making the \\\"Wolfish grin\\\" comment dependent on the player having the Beast Form power rather than a stage of a certain Companions quest (thus stopping the comment should you somehow get cured in some way later).\r\n\r\nHowever, I NEED YOUR HELP! There is just SO MUCH dialogue in Skyrim, I\\'m absolutely CERTAIN I missed some instances, so if you run into any instances where your vampire isn\\'t recognized as their original race, let me know in the comments! Tell me the NPC and race and location, and I\\'ll do my best to fix it!\r\n\r\nConflicts? Probably any mod that changes the exact same NPC dialogue, in which case the game should use the dialogue of whichever mod is loaded last.\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n0.1, Initial Release!\r\n0.2, OMG, I forgot Orcs and Thalmor! I can never get those hours of my life back. ?_?\r\n0.2 Alt, Added a version (UNTESTED) that removes the \\'pale as snow\\' comment for darker-toned races. \r\n0.3, Most every NPC in Windhelm covered now! Updated the \\'LessPale\\' version, too!\r\n0.3.2, Decided to make the \\'Less Pale\\' version the standard version. If Dawnguard makes every vampire regardless of race bone white, I\\'ll change it, but this simplifies things for me. Also, Alvor of Riverwood should now mention that he might have some elven stuff laying around for an elven vampire. And! Helgrid of Windhelm should stop talking about her autopsy when appropriate! She was kinda creepin\\' me out...\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED!\r\nBetter Vampires by Brehanin 5_15 (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9717)\r\nVampire Face Less Sunken Cheeks by Devacore (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16506)\r\nSnow white vampires by Xerrogg (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11894)\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to...\r\nBethesda, for the Elder Scrolls series, from Arena to Skyrim.\r\nThe Elder Scrolls Modding Community, who have made a great game series even better.",
