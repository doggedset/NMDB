A patch was originally made by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/9435783]ANoodInDisguise[/url]﻿, who adjusted stats and recipes and used Requiem's leveled lists instead of vanilla ones to integrate Brigandage armors into the game.\n<br />The improvements to that patch and to the original mod include: fixed typos and improved names, balanced stats based on KFR's standards, improved crafting recipes based on COR's standards and added generic Fur Plates alternate crafting recipes.\n<br />Stats and keywords are based on the look of the armors, the goal is to achieve a balanced and realistic result, that provides consistency with the recipes requirements and stats and keywords of the vanilla reqtified armors.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Bugs[/b][/size]\n<br />Bugs that the patch COULD cause:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]balance issues (I did my best to make sure the armors stats make sense, but there's always room for improvements)\n<br />[*]typos and errors (there's always a chance I missed something)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=3]Credits and thanks\n<br />[/size][/b]Credit and thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4122606]FranklinZunge[/url]﻿ for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32706]Brigandage[/url]﻿\n<br />Credit and thanks to the Requiem team for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281]Requiem[/url]﻿\n<br />Credit and thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/9435783]ANoobInDisguise[/url] for the original patch\n<br />Disclaimer: this patch is just an ESP that is a modification of the original, it doesn't include any of the assets not made by FranklinZunge, whose authors are credited in the Brigandage mod's page: northborn (nbfurhoods textures), hothtrooper (chainmail texture), defunkt (chainmail texture), lordofwar (witcher 2 meshes port), amidianborn (textures), Bethesda (vanilla meshes and textures)",
