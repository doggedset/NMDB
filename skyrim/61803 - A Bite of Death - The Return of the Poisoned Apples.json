  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=#ff0000][b][i]A Bite of Death - The Return of Poisoned Apples[/i][/b][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Did you love the poisoned apples from Oblivion? Did you miss seeing your enemies drop dead from simply eating healthy? And did you crave the return of them to Skyrim? Well look no further, as here is a solution to that&#33; After seeing only one mod return these bad boys to Skyrim (which wasn&#39;t to my taste), I made this bad boy and returned the deadly fruit to the Skyrim world&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m always looking to expand on my mod ideas so if there is something that you feel needs changing or something else you think needs adding, let me know&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[b][i]Full Features:[/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />* Two types of poisoned apples - In version 1, red do 35 points of straight up damage (the same as a Potent Poison) and green do lingering damage of 2 per every second for 15 seconds (the same as a Potent Lingering poison). For those who prefer higher damage, an updated file with higher damage (350 for red, 35 per second for 300 seconds for green) has been included.\r<br />* Three respawning barrels of them are placed in the world, one in the Falkreath Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary (in the main room where Astrid is, near the robes) and two in the Dawnstar Sanctuary (in the master bedroom)\r<br />* Craftable - Simple head to a cooking pot and mix in a red apple with a Potent Poison or a green apple with a Lingering Potent Poison. This does requires the Poisoned perk from the Alchemy tree however.\r<br />* A small story behind the mod... Explore near the Falkreath Watchtower for some clues...\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange][b]=====Installation=====[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Just download and drop the file into your data folder.\r<br />Or just use the NMM. \r<br />To uninstall, just remove the file. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][b]====Bugs, Issues and Other Tidbits====[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />While it is designed to be reverse-pickpocketed, it is possible to coat your weapon in them. This is not really a bug, but merely me not knowing how to go about this. So feel free to coat your sword in apple juice, if you desire it to be, but note that this is not the intended use of said apples.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]====[b]Compatibility[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Compatible:[/i]\r<br />Pretty much everything\r<br />\r<br />[i]Incompatible:[/i]\r<br />The two barrels in the Dawnstar Sanctuary will NOT appear if you use the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20700/?]Dark Brotherhood Reborn [/url]overhaul mod. I&#39;ll create an alternate patch for it ASAP.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700]====Changelog====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Version 1 - Initial release\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1 - Updated file with higher damage (see read-me)\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Permissions and Credits[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />This mod is not to be uploaded anywhere but the Skyrim Nexus. Please report to me if you see this anywhere else.\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating a great game and letting us fiddle with it. \r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Thanks for reading and check my page for more mods&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7065334/?tb=mods&pUp=1][img]http://i42.tinypic.com/2dryws3.png[/img][/url]",
