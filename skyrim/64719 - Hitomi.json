Then, SkyrimGTX contacted me, saying he wanted me to  create a follower mod out of his character, Hitomi. She looks exceptionally pretty and I was actually looking for a good character to make a follower out of. so here I am with another beautiful follower mod. Hope you guys like it&#33; :D\r<br />\r<br />",
