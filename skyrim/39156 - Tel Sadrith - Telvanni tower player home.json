  "descriptionHtml": "REQUIRES DRAGONBORN&#33;\r<br />Made using Earrindo&#39;s excellent Telvanni tower resource: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34882//?  \r<br />Thanks to Ac3s for letting me use his edited meshes&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Telvanni Reborn textures are highly recommended:  \r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34601//?\r<br />\r<br />Tel Sadrith is a Telvanni style huge-ass mushroom that serves as a player home. It is smaller than Tel Mithryn, but still pretty impressive for a mushroom. It is mostly lore friendly. I hope. \r<br />\r<br />The large tower has a bed, bookshelves, chests, enchanting table and a staff enchanter. A bunch of wizard stuff, basically. \r<br />All containers are non-respawning. In fact, only some barrels and urns in the kitchen respawn.\r<br />\r<br />The smaller mushroom pods contain a kitchen and an alchemy laboratory. The kitchen has shrines for the three good daedra, and an ashpit with someone&#39;s grandpa&#39;s bones in in it, because ancestor worship is something that dunmer tend to do. The alchemy lab has, surprisingly, alchemy labs and ingredients.\r<br />There&#39;s a cook in the kitchen who sells food and drinks, and an alchemist in the lab who sells alchemy stuff; potions, ingredients etc.\r<br />\r<br />There are rooms under the tower now. These rooms contain smithing facilities(anvil, workbench, grindstone) and some beds. \r<br />No smelter yet, i will add that in a later update when i have time.\r<br />\r<br />It is located on the southeastern edge of the volcanic tundra, east of Mistwatch. A map marker is visible immediately in game, you don&#39;t have to discover it.\r<br />\r<br />There is an essential storm atronach standing guard outside. It will attack any hostiles in the area.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />BUGS/ISSUES:  None that i know of. If you see any, report the so i can squish them.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I am always open for new suggestions and ideas for improving the tower. :) ",

      "changelogHtml": " 1. Fixed the navmesh. Mostly anyway. Followers still can&#39;t follow you into the tower.\r<br />\r<br />2. Modified the interiors. The kitchen has a shrine now, the tower has more lanterns, bookshelves and a huge metal cage with a vampire in it, because vampires are cool. The alchemy lab has a bookshelf.\r<br />\r<br />3. Changed the awkward looking platform by the tower&#39;s door into a mushroom cap.\r<br />\r<br />4. Added more roots outside the tower, it looks even more organic now in my opinion. <br/> \n Tweaked the exterior; added more lanterns, made the tower a bit bigger, some smaller modifications. <br/> \n Added an essential storm atronach to stand guard outside the tower. It will attack any hostiles in the area. <br/> \n Added rooms under the tower. These contain smithing facilities and two beds for followers. <br/> \n",
