  "summary": "Adds two rooms, an Armory on the first floor and a storage nook in the basement as well as some storage containers near the Alchemy bench.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Update to Version 2.0\r<br />\r<br />I completely rearranged the Armory to add light and make sure all the display areas were functioning properly.  The Armory will now display, 14 weapons, 8 suits, with additional spots for 15 additional shields.  There are now two wardrobes in the room for storage.  I intentionally slid the lighting emphasis away from the weapons to highlight the glow effects on many of the weapons.\r<br />\r<br />ATTENTION:\r<br />If you have the previous version please remove your items from the displays before updating.\r<br />",
