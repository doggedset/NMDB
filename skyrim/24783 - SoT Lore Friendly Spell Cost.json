  "summary": "This mod changes the cost to cast Detect Life and Telekinesis\r\n\r\nBoth now only cost 1 per second to use, also Detect Life now detects life farther away (300 from the vanilla 200)\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "THIS WILL NOT MAKE YOU LEVEL UP INSANELY FAST!!! MEANING YOU CANT SPAM DETECT LIFE AND GAIN A FEW LEVELS IN SECONDS.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nFor those of you who know the Sword Of Truth series you will understand why I felt that this needed to be changed. \r\nDetecting life and moving things around should be a simple task for any mage and shouldn\\'t drain their energy.\r\nSo I\\'ve decided to release this to allow any other SoT fans, or players who agree with fair spells that are not OP, to enjoy the Skyrim magic system.\r\n\r\nPlans:\r\nI would love to change this so that the spell cost changes once you reach a certain level in that area of magic, something so that if you are a mage, you got this, but if you\\'re just using these spells and not a mage it\\'s still expensive for you.\r\n\r\nI\\'m thinking about adding Ward spells to this and any other spells that you think need to be raised (doubtful) or lowered to fit more with the SoT lore.\r\n\r\nI\\'m open to making any requested changes to the Magic system but would make a seprate mod for that, this mod will try to alter the magic system so that it is a little more along the lines of what the SoT has.\r\n\r\n--Instillation-- \r\nPick one of the files and place the .esp in the Skyrim/Data folder\r\n\r\n--Update--\r\n-Wards have been changed so now are almost free as well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor other great mods check out Warrior Keke, I like his spells and some go nicely with the SoT lore\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit\r\nand thanks to TERRY GOODKIND for the wonderful world he has created!!!\r\n",
