[size=3]So here we have mahogany inlaid with cherrywood with stone channels/reservoirs, and a pewter burner with hammered copper panels. The texture is 1024x1024, in line with the High Res packs. The wood is dark, and it ought to be. The screenshots above were taken in QASmoke with Climates of Tamriel and Realistic Lighting Overhaul running, but even in vanilla things can get pretty shadowy where this texture is concerned. Interiors can make the mahogany look black, but just as in real life, if you find a table out in the sunlight, you&#39;ll see the mahogany is really a rich chocolate brown.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]As with my enchanting table, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;ll look great in all applications, but as I learned from comments I&#39;m apparently not a very good judge of that, so I&#39;m just releasing this as a straight replacer ;) With that said, I hope this can be used as a resource as well, for people who just want a splash of uniqueness here and there in their world. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please feel free to leave any suggestions or comments you like. I don&#39;t plan on doing much more with this, but that&#39;s what I always say&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/VuhkUa1.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Use the mod manager of your choice or extract the contents of the file into Skyrim/Data. To uninstall do the opposite of that.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/a8zmtSw.png[/img]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59789/?]Mutant Powers[/url] - By JetSteele\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/eAFaeV5.png[/img][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Do with this as you will. For your convenience, I&#39;ve included the raw PSD file for you to play with if that&#39;s your pleasure. You do not need express permission from me to publish any changes or mods which include this texture, however a link back and credit would be nice. If you let me know when your file is published, I&#39;ll stick a link to your mod here&#33;[/size]",
