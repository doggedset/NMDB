Please only activate one of them as they use the same place&#33; Both versions can be found near Riverwood Bridge, you cannot miss them. There is also a map marker included. They are roughly navmeshed on the outside and on the lower floor to avoid some oddities when you have a follower ^^.\r<br />\r<br />=============================\r<br />\r<br />Mill: \r<br />The original has fully animated mill-gears, mill-wheel and millstone. I did not manage to port over the complicated animation for the mechanism so the mill gear remains static. Maybe some day in the future ...  \r<br />But I managed to animate the row boat, the toolshed door and the chimney door.\r<br />I did not include the mill wheel as there are already animated mill wheels in Skyrim, so I retextured the existing ones to match the appearance of the house and included them. \r<br />\r<br />=============================\r<br />\r<br />Alternate House: \r<br />As the mill gear is not working, I decided to modify the mill to a normal house as an alternate version. I removed from the exterior and interior the parts that are used by the gear, only a small pit on the first floor and small hole in the ceiling remained. You can use the pit as a bathtub or something like that or drop a static on it to make it invisible. \r<br />I also textured it a bit more lightly than the old mill.\r<br />\r<br />=============================\r<br />\r<br />Alternate no-window-light files:\r<br />For those who prefer unlighted windows, I included an extra folder &#34;House No Window Lighting&#34; will all interior and exterior meshes with unlighted windows. \r<br />\r<br />=============================\r<br />\r<br />Besides the house and the millwheel there are included: \r<br />\r<br />Tool shed with stairs and animated door\r<br />Podest with stairs\r<br />Row boat, animated and not animated\r<br />Handcart with sacks\r<br />4 different sacks \r<br />Rope with hook\r<br />Millstone\r<br />2 different ovens, one of them with 3 different textures\r<br />Weathercock\r<br />Birdcage\r<br />and a teapot\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=============================\r<br />Notes:\r<br />\r<br />The mill wheels need to be scaled down in the CK, a scale of 0.7 works fine\r<br />The same applies to the chimney door, a scale of 0.5 looks good. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Tools used:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Blender\r<br />Nifskope\r<br />NifUtils by Skyfox\r<br />Gimp\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />This is a modders resource.You may use the meshes and textures for your own mods as long as you give credit and you do not charge money for it.\r<br />\r<br />You may use this resource in Skyrim Special Edition too. All files should work without problems. \r<br />\r<br />Do not upload to other sites.\r<br />\r<br />Stroti has quit modding and will no longer be active on the forums.\r<br />I have his personal permission to convert his Oblivion resources and to upload them.\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Credits:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Stroti for his resources and for everything he has given to the TES community&#33;\r<br />The Niftools team for giving us Nifskope.\r<br />Skyfox from the Niftools team for his great tool NifUtils\r<br />Bethesda for the TES games.",
