  "descriptionHtml": "-Mod requires HEARTHFIRE to function properly.  \r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a small minimalist player home designed for thief/bandit characters just starting their path to crime.  Ideally this home is for newer lower levelled characters, but those looking for a lore friendly hideout or pit-stop (without overly pretentious and opulent features) will find this mod functional and pleasing.  \r<br />\r<br />Site features include:  \r<br />-Tanning rack and Cooking pot on the exterior camp.\r<br />-Riverwood is but a stoneâ€™s throw away for all your Trade and Smithing needs.\r<br />-A chest, lockbox, end table, safe and two knapsacks for storage (Please avoid using the Barrels as they WILL respawn new goods and overwrite any stored items.)\r<br />-Navmeshed and Follower Friendly Interior and exterior.\r<br />\r<br />Site location is a cave across the river passing by Riverwood, just follow the map marker until the location is revealed.  \r<br />",
