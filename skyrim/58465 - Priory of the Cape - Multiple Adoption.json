  "descriptionHtml": "It was my 29th birthday yesterday, and a wonderful time it was. I even managed to finish my newest player home for those of us still searching for the right pad&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[u][font=Georgia][size=5]Priory of the Cape[/size][/font][/u]\r<br />\r<br />On the coastal base of Solitude&#39;s arch overlooking the Sea of Ghosts, with a fine line of sight to Nightcaller Temple and the College of Winterhold, the Priory of the Cape is a player home comparable in size to other Vanilla homes, and should feel fairly lore-friendly, even if set up with a few neat trinkets in the style of a wealthy adventurer. I&#39;ve blended a few architectural elements together, but I feel it has succeeded in its purpose. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Features:[/b]\r<br />- Over a dozen weapon racks and plaques, with two manikins.\r<br />- Most desired crafting stations.\r<br />- A fair balance of ambient lighting, with special static items such as a mirror, Ideal Master crystal and unique Shrine of Arkay.\r<br />- A balcony overlooking the cape, a hatch to the tower&#39;s peak, outhouse and small barn for 2 cows.\r<br />- Hearthfire-friendly garden with chicken coup.\r<br />- Blend of Hearthfire, Dawnguard and Dragonborn architecture.\r<br />- An Aetherium Circlet by the Dragon Shrine in the back of the home; in case you wanted the other Aetherium items as well. \r<br />- Most importantly, Multiple Adoption Friendly&#33; with room for a spouse and 2 children. Properly navmeshed. \r<br />\r<br />- [b]Second File [/b]is an update with 2 extra beds (total 5), an outdoor chest, and a modified north wing. \r<br />[b]\r<br />Compatibility / Incompatibility:[/b]\r<br />- No incompatibility known yet, unless the landmass is taken by another mod. It works well with the Solitude Docks mod (for a nearby community) and, I imagine, Syerscote across the inlet. \r<br />- The mod is located just a stone&#39;s throw south of the Dainty Sload, very close to the Solitude Windmill exit.\r<br />- Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn are required. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation: [/b]\r<br />- Just one file to go in your Skyrim &gt; Data directory.\r<br />\r<br />I hope everyone enjoys this mod, I&#39;m very happy for the success of the style and coding to work with all 3 DLC&#39;s to make a cozy and unique home for you. If you have any suggestions, they&#39;re more than welcome&#33; ",
