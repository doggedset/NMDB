  "descriptionHtml": ".__________________________________Description________________________________________.\n<br />I have created this mod because i can't wait 5 minutes for a replie, and it took less then 5 minutes to create, i did all the work, and the idea came from me clicking 100s of times just to make 50 iron ingots, i searched and foound but not what i wanted, so i asked and waited less then 5 minutes then just make it myself with Creation Kit.\n<br />\n<br />.__________________________________Features__________________________________________.\n<br />Every ingot from smelter now has 3 extra options, 5, 10 and 20 ingots from smelter...Example??....\n<br />1 Iron ingot costs 1 iron ore, so 5 iron ingots costs 5 iron ores, 10 iron ingots = 10 iron ores, 20 iron ingots = 20 iron ore, so you can understand why it costs 10 ores for every other 5 ingots, and 20 for 10, 40 for 20, because each ingot besides iron ingots and steel ingots, costs 2 of the same ores to make, the steel ingots only cost 1 of the same ore, but require 2 types of ores so it will cost 40 total ingots to get 20 steel ingots.\n<br />Changes Will Not Be Made.\n<br />\n<br />._____________________________Installation______________________________________________.\n<br />Extract and drag \"Data\" folder you have downloaded into skyrim directory.\n<br />or drag and drop the \"ExtraIngotOptions\" .esp in the data folder that is in the skyrim directory.\n<br />i am sure that this is MM capable..Capible...you know what i mean, if not tell me, thanks.\n<br />\n<br />.__________________________My Other Mods_____________________________________________.\n<br />\n<br />Breezehome Merchant - Talias Retreat:\n<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27682\n<br />-\n<br />Riverwood hidden Mine:\n<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27685\n<br />-\n<br />Master Sub-Difficulties:\n<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27269\n<br />\n<br />._____________________________Coming-Soon____________________________________________.\n<br />MODs are back online.\n<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n<br />Skyrim Market Place: Find everything you need and more, for a price.(Part of another mod)\n<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n<br />Hunter's Mansion: A place to cook and fish, and more.(0% Lost in deletion, Remaking)\n<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n<br />The lost Temple:\n<br />A temple long lost, taken over by powerful creatures and Falmer Under the command of demons, and a portal.\n<br />+\n<br />SkyIsland:\n<br />An island in the sky, an angels Post to Protect skyrim from Demons, angel Weapons &amp; Armor designs were past dawn to the elvens but not perfected as they were not forged in the Holy Forge, the only way there, is The Lost Temple.\n<br />Holy Magic, Weapons &amp; Armors can be forged here, as long as you do not attack anything.\n<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n<br />Catacombs To Hell:\n<br />With Multible Diablo-Like dungeons, they are sealed away from Skyrims surface, Filled with traps and creatures these places are Very Dangerous, deeper in the dungeons is a gate and a gate-guardien that seals the demons from getting out, past the gate are many powerful demons that would tear apart a mammoth like piranha, deeper down, past all the demons, is Hell!, everything is on fire, smoldering rivers, and many more demons with Large Devil Lords, and an Evil Demi-God, Ruler Of Hell.\n<br />The daedra Have Learned a lot from Hells teachings, there armor and weapons seem the same, but fail! in comparison to there Strangth and effects, as the Daedric's were not forged in the Hell Forge.\n<br />Evil magic, Weapons &amp; Armors can be forged here as long as nothing is trying to kill you.",
