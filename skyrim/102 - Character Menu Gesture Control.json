  "descriptionHtml": "Character Menu Gesture Control v0.8\r\n- Off the Rails\r\n\r\nThis utility is a simple autohotkey script (or exe file, depending which version you prefer to use) that must be run alongside Skyrim. It doesn\\'t matter which is loaded first. Note that if you\\'ve changed your keymapping to something other than tab, the utility isn\\'t smart enough (yet) to pick that up. It may fail if you\\'ve bound your arrow keys to some function or other, or it may not. You can fix this sad state of affairs by editing the .ahk version if you\\'ve got the know-how.\r\n\r\nIt changes the behaviour of the Character (tab) menu to cut down on mouseclicks and keystrokes. Just hold tab, then move the mouse in the direction of the option you want. It works best if the mouse isn\\'t moving when you first press tab. If you move left or right, keep tab held down to navigate through your inventory and spellbook. Release tab to stop gesticulating.\r\n\r\nTo install, just unzip the files wherever you want. If you\\'re using my Skyrim Autohotkey Assistant, you should put these files in its Scripts folder.\r\n\r\nTo exit the app, right-click the icon in your system tray. To uninstall, delete the files from your hard drive.\r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t want to use my .exe (possibly quite wise; don\\'t trust anyone on the net), you\\'ll need to get hold of the autohotkey software to make use of the script. Check out my Skyrim Autohotkey Assistant(http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=460) which includes everything you\\'ll need to get going, and automatically runs your Skyrim scripts and shuts them down afterwards. If you have SAA, or if you\\'ve already got autohotkey, you don\\'t need the executable. Delete it and save yourself 800KB of storage space.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMISATION\r\n=============\r\nAs of v0.8, there will be an .ini file in the script\\'s folder that allows you to adjust the script\\'s sensitivity. For all these, higher values are less twitchy. The entries are:\r\n\r\nMain (default 250):\r\nHow jumpy is the compass menu that pops up? Increase this if you want to move the mouse further before activating either the Item, Magic, Map or Stats screens. Note that there\\'s a bug where the script can lose track of which menu you\\'re on. I personally use the Global setting (below) instead.\r\n\r\nMenu (default 20):\r\nHow jumpy is the highlight on the inventory and magic lists? Increase this if you\\'re finding it hard to click on the right item.\r\n\r\nGlobal (default off):\r\nIFF this is set, it overrides the other two. The highlight will then move at the same speed all the time. If not, it does nothing.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n=====\r\n\r\n* This file is could well be infested with viruses and other crap. Only a complete tool would run it without checking. If you\\'re that dumb, it\\'s not my fault.\r\n* If you\\'ve got the .ahk version you can edit the third line of the script to change how far you need to move the mouse cursor.\r\n* If you press tab and release it without moving the mouse, the script has no effect and you can use the default method to navigate the character menu.\r\n* I am the worst computer programmer in the world. I have only the vaguest idea what\\'s going on inside these boxes, and as a result this utility might have unintended features. Don\\'t come crying to me if it develops AI and tries to flood the enrichment centre with a deadly neurotoxin.\r\n* Keep smiling!\r\n* Comments welcomed. Criticisms doubly so. Insults returned in kind.\r\n* Guaranteed to be free of trojans, viruses, worms, CFCs, botulism and Communist ideals.\r\n* I\\'d love to suppress the default Skyrim mouse cursor, but I haven\\'t got a clue how that might be possible.\r\n\r\nCHANGES\r\n=======\r\n\r\nv0.8\r\nCompletely re-written; ini file added.\r\n\r\nv0.7\r\nYou don\\'t want to know. It was a long night.\r\n\r\nv0.6\r\nCan\\'t remember.\r\n\r\nv0.5\r\nResponsiveness improved; should now be useful for navigating Item & Magic menus in their entirety.\r\n\r\nv0.3\r\nThe script now simulates pressing the arrow keys instead of the WASD. This may help with layout compatibility.\r\n\r\nv0.2\r\nChanged the hotkeys to use WASD rather than the \\'use\\' key.",
