Features enchanted armor, spell tomes, rings, and necklaces: All integrated into the levelled lists.\r<br />\r<br />For those of you who don&#39;t know, or don&#39;t remember, the chameleon effects in Morrowind and Oblivion were spells and enchantments that made the player partially invisible, while still retaining the ability to interact with the environment, unlike invisibility. I used [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44317/?][b]Maegfaer[/b]&#39;s assets[/url] to make this mod. He created the effects, I just implemented them.[b]\r<br />[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Note: This mod is [i]definitely[/i] a [b]work in progress[/b], so please report any bugs you find immediately. I have not yet fully playtested all of the features I have implemented, so I am posting this alpha version on the Nexus for feedback. Thanks for playing&#33;\r<br />\r<br />-Zer0The0Her0[/center]",
