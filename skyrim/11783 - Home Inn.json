  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a player-owned house to Riverwood. It\\'s my first mod.\r\n\r\nAlso on:\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=13751]Steam Workshop[/url]\r\n\r\nThe inside is based on the Sleeping Giant Inn, but it was modified to suit my taste.\r\nThe main floor looks like an inn. The room where the bedrooms normally are, is now the storage room (3 chests: Armour, Weapons, Clothing and Jewelry). The cellar contains all the standard stuff that you need (forge, smelter, workbench, ...).\r\n\r\nIt also features a trader who buys all your gathered junk.\r\n\r\nThe house is situated in the corner of Riverwood, where the mountains start. Right next to one of the gates, behind the Sleeping Giant Inn. It also has a map marker for fast travel.\r\n\r\nUpdates will come. Ideas are welcome.\r\n\r\nFuture plans (possibly, not sure):\r\n- NPC\\'s (trader, guards, guests, ...)\r\n- More decoration, both inside and outside\r\n- A quest to obtain the house\r\n- <insert your idea here>\r\n\r\nPlease submit your ideas to me through Steam or comment below, maybe you\\'ll see them in my mod someday =)\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3.3:\r\n- The house is now always visible (wasn\\'t always visible somehow in previous versions). This has been confirmed by multiple people.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3.2:\r\n- Fixed the owner, you should now be able to freely pick up what you like. I apologize for this late fix, I never had any trouble with this on my own savegame.\r\n- Moved the guards and the entrance a bit, should look better now.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3.1:\r\n- Fixed the trader, something went wrong with him in the previous version.\r\n- Fixed the chestname in the top floor bedroom.\r\n- Rearranged the chests in the storageroom.\r\n- Moved the furniture a bit to avoid clipping issues.\r\n- Door should be like a door should be now.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3:\r\n- Trader shouldn\\'t be in a fighting pose anymore.\r\n- Lights should be fixed now.\r\n- Added 2 guards at the door.\r\n- Added a second basement for future purposes.\r\n- Added some small furniture in the main hall (2 tables and 4 chairs).\r\n- Moved the chests in the storage area a bit to make room for the second basement.\r\n- Moved the tree outside a bit closer to the house (including the birds nest this time).\r\n- Added stairs outside and a few extra rocks for decoration.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2.1:\r\n- Trader should be working now (thanks to Daniel for the help).\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2:\r\n- Fixed some other bugs (lighting).\r\n- Added NPC (Mick the Trader).\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1:\r\n- Fixed a few small bugs.\r\n- Fully navmeshed the house. Should be companion friendly now.\r\n- Added a tanning rack (forgot that one in the first release).\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0:\r\nInitial release.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\nSome users (including myself) reported that the house is sometimes invisible when you first enter Riverwood to visit the house. When you exit the house it\\'s back. I have no idea why this is or how to fix it. The mod still works though.\r\n\r\nMay be incompatible with other mods that do things with Riverwood.\r\n\r\nIf there\\'s anything missing or you have some other feedback or questions, feel free to comment ;)\r\n\r\nYou may NOT use this mod for your own mods without my permission.\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\nBethesda for making Skyrim and the CK\r\nbFe for helping me with the mod",
