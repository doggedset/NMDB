  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=4]\r<br />\r<br />I present to you the Forgemasters Warforge, an ancient Dwemer forge located in the depth of Blackreach...\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][/font][color=#ffd966]This is a very small mod and hate to use that phrase, but I really did make this for my own convenience and share it with the community in case others like to hang out in Blackreach...\r<br />\r<br />This is really for people who like I said love to spend time in Blackreach or even start a Character in Blackreach via an alternate start mod. I did just that and found the lack of crafting stations very irritating and also nonsensical; you would think that all that metal forged technology of the Dwemer and there would be some remnant of a forge where they actually build the damned things and made their heavy armor.\r<br />The so called &#34;War Quarters&#34; in Blackreach are actually disappointingly empty and offered a logical location for a forge and processing center for ore; so that is what I did and I tried to adapt vanilla crafting stations to look and feel like something the Dwemer might have used.\r<br />The only piece that I did not adapt as such is a tanning rack, but there was some evidence of prior adventurer activity in there (candle placed on a rock ledge) and so I made it look like that is left from an adventurer. There is a knapsack and it is safe for storage&#33; \r<br />The GS version has a simple crafting supplies activator in addition.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you find this a useful addition to your game and enjoy discovering it. There are two complete sets of Dwemer armor around the crafting stations, one plain and the other enchanted at a high level; there are also several plain and enchanted Dwemer weapons about the forge and a bunch of raw material.\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY:Â \r<br />The only other mod I know of that uses this space is 3DNPC (Interesting NPCs) and my mod is fully compatible with it; the two mods occupy different areas of the War Quarters.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />Install with your favorite MO and activate in your load order; no DLC required. For the GS version [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18340/?]General Stores[/url] is obviously required.\r<br />\r<br />This mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit; load order does not matter but I recommend you run LOOT after installing it anyway.\r<br />\r<br />CREDIT:\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for this awesome game and the tools to mod it.\r<br />[/color]",
