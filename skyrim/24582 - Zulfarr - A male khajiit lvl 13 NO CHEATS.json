If you have a problem, send me a message.\r\n\r\nI don\\'t remember the mods i used, i think there are the same than my other savegame (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24245), but if there\\'s anything new let me know so I can credit the author.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you don\\'t like the khajiits or the name you just can change it typing \\\"showracemenu\\\" in console.",
