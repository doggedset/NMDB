  "descriptionHtml": "*****************************************************************\r\n\r\n\t                TES: Skyrim\r\n\t       LFox Vampire Improvements v1.0\r\n\t\t\t Made by LFox\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\n     1. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\n1. Extract the mod to the Data folder and enable it via the\r\nlauncher or mod manager.\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\n     2. Mod Load Order\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nThis plugin should be fine anywhere in your load order.  It will\r\nbe incompatible with anything that modifies vampire abilities.\r\n\r\nIf your using my mod LFox No Vampire Cooldown.esp disable\r\nand remove it.  The cooldown change is already incorperated\r\ninto this mod.\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\n     3. Mod Description\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nThis is my own personal vampire improvement mod.  I will not be\r\nmaking it modular and it is balanced around master difficulty.\r\nIf you do not play on master difficulty or want to be able to\r\npick and choose changes then i\\'m sorry this mod is not for you.\r\n\r\nThis mod aims to improve vampires in almost every aspect.  I\r\nwouldn\\'t call it lore friendly since it essentially makes\r\nvampirism backwards.  Feeding makes you stronger and you grow\r\nweaker when you don\\'t feed.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Abilities on NPCs are currently unchanged.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: If you\\'re currently playing a vampire you\\'ll probably\r\nneed to cure and reinfect yourself or switch between vampire\r\nstages for the mod to properly take effect.\r\n\r\nAuthor\\'s Ramblings\r\n******************\r\nCurrently the mod is completely playable but incomplete since\r\nseveral features require more hands on than skyedit allows.\r\nI\\'ll be honest i don\\'t know how long i\\'ll be supporting this\r\nmod and updating it.  I don\\'t play vampires even half as often\r\nas i do werewolves which is not very ideal when your working on\r\na mod like this.\r\n\r\nI may discontinue the mod if someone releases a vampire mod that\r\npleases me.  Until then i\\'ll be updating my own personal version.\r\nI hadn\\'t really planned on releasing this mod but since i was\r\nasked i decided to put it up for others to use if they like.\r\n\r\nMissing features requiring the CK\r\n- Shifting Stage 3, 4 spells to stages 1, 2\r\n- Sun Damage on Stage 3, 4 vampirism.  (Current attempts lock\r\nout waiting, fast traveling ect)\r\n- Bottling Blood\r\n\r\nVampire Feeding\r\n***************\r\nVampire feeding has been enabled on dead animals as well as\r\ndead npcs.  It has been modified to only be enabled while\r\nsneaking to prevent menu popups when you would otherwise just\r\nbe looting.\r\n\r\nNOTE: All other forms of feeding except the default sleeping\r\nnpcs has no animation.\r\n\r\nVampire Strength\r\n****************\r\nWeakness to Sunlight is as follows.\r\n\r\nLevel 1 - No regeneration in the sun but increased regeneration\r\nout of it, No Sun Damage, No HP/MP/STAM Damage\r\n\r\nLevel 2 - No regeneration in the sun but increased regeneration\r\nout of it, No Sun Damage, 30 HP/MP/STAM Damage\r\n\r\nLevel 3 - No regeneration, (sun damage not implimented),\r\n45 HP/MP/STAM Damage\r\n\r\nLevel 4 - No regeneration, (sun damage not implimented),\r\n60 HP/MP/STAM Damage\r\n\r\nNOTE: I was unable to include the Sovngarde condition with\r\nSkyEdit for various conditions.  So it won\\'t function correctly in\r\nSovngarde.\r\n\r\nVampiric Strength is as follows.\r\n\r\nLevel 1 - +40 Unarmed Damage\r\nLevel 2 - +30 Unarmed Damage\r\nLevel 3 - +20 Unarmed Damage\r\nLevel 4 - +10 Unarmed Damage\r\n\r\nResist Frost/Weakness to Fire is as follows.\r\n\r\nLevel 1 - 100% Resist Frost and 50% Weakness to Fire\r\nLevel 2 - 75% Resist Frost and 50% Weakness to Fire\r\nLevel 3 - 50% Resist Frost and 75% Weakness to Fire\r\nLevel 4 - 25% Resist Frost and 100% Weakness to Fire\r\n\r\nVampire Powers\r\n**************\r\nVampire Sight\r\n- Lasts 99999 seconds.\r\n\r\nVampire Seduction\r\n- No Cooldown\r\n- Now does up to level 25\r\n\r\nEmbrace Of Shadows\r\n- No Cooldown\r\n\r\nVampire Drain\r\n- No Cost\r\n- Power Reversed (stage 1 is strongest, stage 4 weakest)\r\n- Drain increased by x4\r\n\r\nVampire\\'s Servant\r\n- Power Reversed (stage 1 is strongest, stage 4 weakest)\r\n- No Cooldown\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\n     4.
