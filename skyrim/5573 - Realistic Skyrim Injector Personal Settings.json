  "summary": "Gamers who aren\\'t into the whole colorful Skyrim style, this mod setting is for you, where there isn\\'t too much color with no or little blur effect as well as a more sharp effect and you still get that cold feeling Skyrim IMO should have. I ALSO SEEM TO GET BETTER FPS USING THIS SETTING.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is NOT MY MOD, It is only my personal settings from the original mod. \r\nFor those who aren\\'t familiar with this mod, the Pause Break key on the keyboard is the toggle on/off switch.\r\n\r\nFor those who would much prefer to watch the transitions between Vanilla and Realistic Skyrim Injector without having to individually click on the pictures featured here,\r\nA Youtube video I created IMO \\\"scrapbook\\\" form can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/xwuMNsSAneU\r\n\r\nThere are four different settings as far as the sharp effect is concerned available and they are the following:\r\n \r\nRealistic_Skyrim_Injector_Settings-191-2-0 (Default Original File Downloaded 11-19-2011) Pending*\r\nRealistic Skyrim Injector Personal Settings (I use this one, personal taste)\r\nRealistic Skyrim Sharp Effect At 15\r\nRealistic Skyrim Sharpened To 25\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Is my personal settings for the Realistic Skyrim Injector settings. The original mod was to dark for my liking, so I modified some of the settings in the Skyrimcustomshader text file until I finally came up with a setting where there isn\\'t too much color and you still get that cold feeling Skyrim IMO should feel. ALSO I SEEM TO GET BETTER FPS USING REALISTIC SKYRIM INJECTOR OVER ANY ENB MOD IVE DOWNLOADED AND TRIED. NOT HATING ON ENB, JUST WANT TO SHARE MY OPINION AND EXPERIENCE USING THE TWO. Didn\\'t turn up the sharpen effect to much. So again, this is my personal settings, I\\'m not hating on the other graphical mods out there, A COLORFUL Skryim IMO is not my style.\r\n\r\nSome Images may appear darker than they actually are in game.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\nExtract to ....steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim <== this folder.\r\n\r\nCredits to Hunin who\\'s original post of the file I believe is no longer available on this site, Realistic_Skyrim_Injector_Settings-191-2-0.rar\r\n ",
