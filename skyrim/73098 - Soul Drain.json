  "descriptionHtml": "[b][center]Soul Drain by Boteman[/center]\n<br />[/b]This is a concentration (Flames-like) spell which absorbs health and applies soul trap.\n<br />\n<br />It's useful for farming petty souls from weak creatures like mudcrabs, rabbits, wolves, and so on, and could work well as a finishing move as your helpless opponent lies bleeding out, their soul free for the taking!\n<br />\n<br />... ahem\n<br />\n<br />This spell also has a script which allows you to gain conjuration experience as you use it, at a sensible rate. This means that pure conjuration users that don't wish to unnecessarily level other skills (i.e. destruction) now have a way to deal direct damage and restore health while leveling their primary skill.\n<br />\n<br />Basically, it's a better version of soul trap.\n<br />\n<br />The spell falls under the Conjuration skill tree, and is an adept-level spell.\n<br />\n<br />Best used with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72839/?]Soul Capture Sound Replacer - Smooth and Sinister Soul Trap[/url]!\n<br />\n<br />[center]Video: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Qc11aiXU2A]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Qc11aiXU2A[/url]\n<br />[youtube]2Qc11aiXU2A[/youtube][/center]\n<br />Manual installation:\n<br />Extract the contents of the .zip into the \"data\" directory of your Skyrim installation folder.\n<br />\n<br />Some people have raised the issue of not being able to find the actual spell tome. It's located in Riverwood, next to the tanning rack outside Sven's house.\n<br />If you can't find it, open the console and type the following:\n<br />\n<br />[b]help \"Spell Tome: Soul Drain\"[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Look for its ID, made up of 8 characters, then type the following:\n<br />\n<br />[b]player.additem XXXXXXXX 1[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\"XXXXXXXX\" is the ID.\n<br />\n<br />Enjoy! &lt;3",
