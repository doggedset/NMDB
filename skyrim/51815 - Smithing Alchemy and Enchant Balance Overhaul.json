  "descriptionHtml": "Every rpg hardcore gamer know that the best part of a rpg, is to craft to the maximum your gear to have the best gear possible in the game. But when it make the game too easy, we have a problem.\r<br />\r<br />This mod remove the bonus of every perk for Smithing, enchant and alchemy. Now, Improving your item will only be affected by your smithing&#39;s level, The perk will only allow you to make the armor, and will not help you into improving them better. so basically, it&#39;S 200% less improving value. Alchemist no longer boost your potion&#39;s magnitude and same thing for enchanter. Instead, the perk are replaced by &#34;required to unlock Alchemy/enchanter&#39;s perks&#34; and the max level is 1. So basically, your improving is 200% less effective, as well as your potion and enchanting too. With both those value reduced, you&#39;ll still be able to have a perfect gear that will do a lot more damage than an not improved weapon, but it won&#39;t let you to do non-sense like OS a bandit leader in master :/",
