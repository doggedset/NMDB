( If used ) Or a thanks for the source helping. Thanks!\r\nModders Notes: In the Source files. ( Seperate Download. )\r\n\r\n==========\r\n=Overview=\r\n==========\r\n-Adds a spell that can teleport the caster to their very own Dimensional Rift Home and back once they learned it.\r\n\r\n===============\r\n= Description =\r\n===============\r\n-This mod adds a new spell tome to the game called Spell Tome: Rift: Home. This spell allows the caster to teleport to their very own Dimensional Rift Home.\r\n\r\n-The Dimensional Rift: Home contains:\r\n--10 Storage Containers labeled for their uses.\r\n--Every crafting object for the player.\r\n--Nav Meshes as a just in case addition.\r\n--Multiple book shelves for the players reading and storing needs!\r\n--Reusing the spell puts ya back to where ya used it!\r\n--Can be used anywhere, just not in combat or when overweight. ( Can be disabled. )\r\n\r\n================\r\n= Installation =\r\n================\r\nCopy DFB - Dimensional Rift Home.esp, DFB - Dimensional Rift Home.bsa, and DFB - Dimensional Rift Home.bsl  To your Data Folder.\r\n( You can delete the old scripts in the Scripts folder.\r\n\r\nTo Uninstall, Take all your stuff and exit the \\'Home\\' and save then delete all said files.\r\n\r\n=========\r\n= Notes =\r\n=========\r\n-Only the vendor in Riverwood sells it currently.\r\n-This was mainly to learn the new scripting language.\r\n--Due to the adjustment to allow players to bring Followers and Wifes / Husbands. Sometimes porting back places ya under the location. ( IE: Under a bridge. instead on top. )\r\n--Also the Return \\'pad\\' does not port your follower / wife / husband. This is intentional as some may want to keep them there.\r\n\r\n============\r\n= Updating = ( If you were using my Conjured Home version 1.0 - 1.1 )\r\n============\r\nIf you have used previous versions:\r\n1) Take all your stuff out and exit the cell.\r\n2) Save and exit.\r\n3) Remove old version ( DFB - Conjured Home.esp and Scripts/DFBConjureHomeSpellScript.pex )\r\n4) Enable DFB - Dimensional Rift: Home.esp\r\n5) If you had the spell before and now lost it. Console: [Help \\\"Dimensional\\\" 0] and [Player.AddSpell ##000E04] where ## is the Plugin Index.\r\n\r\n=================\r\n=Version History=\r\n=================\r\n=Version 1.2=\r\n+Script Change: Adjusted script for new feature.\r\n+Magic Effect: Adjusted to place both followers AND married NPC(s) along with player within 30 feet to the home.\r\n+Cell: Rift Home: Nav Meshes adjusted for NPCs.\r\n+Cell: Rift Home: Now has a bed and a small table.\r\n+Tome: lowered cost dramatically. ( About 50% )\r\n\r\n=Version 1.1=\r\n+Script Fix: Overweight will now show properly.\r\n+Script Fix: Added a Default Location just in case the Return Marker bugged.
