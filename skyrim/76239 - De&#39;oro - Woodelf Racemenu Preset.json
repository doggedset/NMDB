  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first attempt at a Racemenu preset. This is just a wood elf. Not an odd race or anything. The idea was a plant based elf so I made her green with purple hair trying to make her resemble a flower. Even her name is based on a purple daylilly. I know this isn&#39;t lore friendly in the least but I&#39;d rather use my imagination than rigid self imposed rules and stipulations.\r<br />\r<br />You will need\r<br />\r<br />Brows: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30411/?\r<br />\r<br />and\r<br />\r<br />Ponytail Hairstyles v3_0: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31797/?\r<br />\r<br />Both of which are great mods.\r<br />\r<br />For the body I use UNPB so i don&#39;t know how it will turn out with other bodies so let me know.\r<br /> \r<br />Please keep in mind I play Skyrim on a laptop so I have my graphics set to medium so not the best screenshots in the world. I would love to see how she looks on a better rig so feel free to post/send pics.  ",
