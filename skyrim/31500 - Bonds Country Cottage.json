  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'ve had this little cottage from the beginning and simply continued to improve it. I have enjoyed it convenience and warm friendly atmosphere.\r\n \r\nIt\\'s located to the West of Whiterun near Fort Greymoor. You can watch the traffic go by from the comfort of your front porch.\r\n \r\nThis house was built from new material and replaces the burned out house that was originally at this site. The lot was reasonable and the Dovakiin knows the value of a coin, and settles for only the finest craftsmanship.\r\n \r\nThere are no crafting tables or forges, this is a place to relax with companions and enjoy life. \r\nThis mod makes no pretense at being \\\"lore correct\\\". It\\'s for fun and pleasure. A place to relax in a rough neighborhood with your companions. \r\n\r\nThe house is fully nav-meshed and companion friendly. Besides yourself it sleeps four. There is plenty of storage. \r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n\r\nAdditional Credits:\r\nClinster74 for the bed meshes, the silverware, and that delicious plate of rolls I left on the basement bar for you.\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n\r\nMighty Joe Young from 1mjytropicalcastle mod for the seat animation used on his couch which I have retextured.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18215\r\n\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\nFood Container Resource by Blary http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14133\r\nBooksets Resource by Blary  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14135\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n\r\n  Oaristys and Tony67 for the Modder Resource Pack http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16525\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\nA big thank you to Clinster74 who managed to get the transparent shadow back in to my thatch roof texture.\r\n \r\nAdditional appreciation for Darkone and the sites he supports that bring us all together.\r\n\r\nFor Tes5Edit with which this mod was cleaned. It should cause no problems.\r\n\r\nA special thank you for all the content modders who make their efforts available to the modding community.\r\n\r\nTo the numerous modders whose contributions continue to inform and inspire.\r\n",
