  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]Edit: Rephrasing...\r<br />\r<br />A purely vanilla save file before character creation screen.  Starts right when you get off the wagon.  The most useful save file I kept since the first day Skyrim came out.  I made this manual save knowing I, like many of you mod testers, would need a fallback save in case something goes wrong with mod testing.  It has helped make new characters when old saves had become too buggy with the adding and removing of too many mods.  I hope it will be as useful for you as it has for me.\r<br />\r<br />On a side note the screen shot has some armor mesh overrides because I was lazy on deactivating all my mods for a screen shot but you get the idea of where the save starts off at. (Perfect Legionnaire by Ali Bengali)\r<br />\r<br />FYI:\r<br />Download manually and extract save to C:&#92;Users&#92;USER&#92;MyDocuments&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim&#92;Saves\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />Goes to Bethesda Developers, all I did was keep a very old save file.\r<br />\r<br />[/size]",
