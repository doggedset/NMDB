  "modName": "No More Dragon Word Wall Blindness",
  "summary": "Removes dark screen when learning a Word of Power, or using certain enchantments/spells.",
  "descriptionHtml": "If you play with realistic lighting mods, then you might know what I&#39;m talking about: you go up to learn a Word of Power, and the screen, rather than simply darkening a bit, goes completely black so you can&#39;t see where you&#39;re going. Or, you&#39;d use an Absorb Health/Magicka/Stamina enchantment or spell, and the same thing happened. Personally, I got tired of it, and thus this little tweak was born. \r<br />\r<br />This mod removes the darkening effect of getting close to a new word wall. You still keep the double-vision, and you still get the ethereal, twisting lights coming from the word. The only thing &#34;removed&#34; was the darkening of the screen.\r<br />\r<br />I could have simply reduced the darkening, but different lighting mods would require different levels of reduction, and there&#39;s enough of them out there that it&#39;s a daunting task, especially since people sometimes use more than one lighting mod.\r<br />\r<br />Compatible with Skyrim v1.9.32.0\r<br />Dawnguard not required\r<br />\r<br />This mod SHOULD be compatible with any and all versions of Skyrim, but has been tested and verified on the version mentioned above.\r<br />\r<br />Changelog:\r<br />1.0 Original upload. Only learning Words of Power from walls affected\r<br />1.1 Added Absorbs spells/enchantments (Hopefully)",
