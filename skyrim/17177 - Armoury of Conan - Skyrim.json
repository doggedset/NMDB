  "summary": "Adds weapons and a Shield from the Original Conan movies into Skyrim",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is a WIPpreview release. The eventual intention of this mod is to complement the work of some previous modders in bringing weapons and armour from the Conan movies into the world of Skyrim, and is produced as a proof of concept. It is a port of some of my old Oblivion resource and was done as a means of me familiarising myself with the newest version of Nifscope and proving that it could be done without me investing time too heavily. I have been pursuaded by a friend to release it as a stand alone preview. As such it is still a little rough, not as polished as I would have liked, but it is a good start to take forward.\r\n\r\nThe following meshes have been added to the game:\r\n\r\n- The Mace of Bombaata (2 handed)\r\n- Bombaata\\'s Fist (Mace 1 handed)\r\n- The Fangs of the Serpent (Assasin\\'s Dagger)\r\n- Valeria\\'s Sword\r\n- Rexor\\'s Triple Bladed Axe\r\n- Thorgrim\\'s Hammer (2 handed)\r\n- The Ancient Axe\r\n- The Shield of Amra\r\n- Doom\\'s Shield\r\n- The Ancient Shield of the Mounds\r\n- The Helmet of Amra *\r\n- Thulsa Doom\\'s Helm\r\n- Rexor\\'s Helm\r\n- Thorgrim\\'s Helm\r\n- Helm of the Vanir\r\n- Father\\'s Greatsword (2 handed)\r\n- Atlantean Greatsword (2 handed)\r\n\r\n(* modified or NEW to Version 1.3)\r\n\r\nand additionally included:\r\n\r\n- Fathers Sword\r\n- Atlantean Sword\r\n\r\n\r\nReforging Weapons - Changing 1 handed to two handed - and back again!\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt the request of some subscribers to this mod I have included a feature to reforge the Father\\'s Sword and the Atlantean Sword into their Greatsword (2 handed) counterparts. Just take the Swords to the forge and supply the materials required to make the GreatSword versions (in the STEEL section). If you decide that you want to revert to the one handed versions of the weapons then just repeat the process.\r\n\r\nYou can also shorten Bombaata\\'s Mace into its 1 handed version (Bombaata\\'s Fist), and back again, using the same procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation in game\r\n----------------\r\nAll items (apart from the reforgeable alternatives) are located in the Hall of the Dead in Whiterun. Just look on and around the slabs to see where these items have finally come to rest...\r\n\r\nFor the Reforgeable items - get thee to a Blacksmith!\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit\r\n------\r\n\r\nFor the Father\\'s Sword and Atlantean Sword meshes and textures - These two iconic swords have been VERY KINDLY provided with permission by Mr Dave (meshes) and Rhevn (textures).
