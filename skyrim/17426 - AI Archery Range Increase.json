  "summary": "After Hours of Trying to find out what changes the range of bows for AI. I finally did it!",
  "descriptionHtml": "This simple mod increases the range of the A.I\\'s ability to shoot range weapons adding more immersion to the game. I also tweaked the aggro radius so you will be seen from a furth distance now. Originally the A.I\\'s spotting capability in my opinion was poor. Now the radius has been increased it feels like the A.I are communicating with each other to spot your location. \r\n\r\nI made this mod because i will be using it in conjunction with my famous Mines of Moria mod to simulate the orcs firing off the balcony in khazad dum :)\r\n\r\nIf anyone is curious, This mod doubles the range :)\r\n\r\nUploaded Version without the aggro radius\r\n\r\nSee video for example. It is poor quality sorry about that :(\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0dqekhbkD8&feature=youtu.be",
