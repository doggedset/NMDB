  "descriptionHtml": "This allows you to use the 2 handed \\\"Dead Thrall\\\" as a power, instead of taking up 2 hands on your screen. Just drop in your data folder, and on the skyrim launcher, click on data files, and make sure that it is checked. If you guys have any problems, just post in the comment section, or if you would like to see any other spells changed into powers (or shouts) or vise versa, just let me know. Hope you guys enjoy :D\r\n\r\nEdit: IT RENAMES THE DEAD THRALL SPELL TO \\\":=\\\" IT SHOULD BE AT THE VERY END OF THE POWERS LIST, AS IT IS IN THE PICTURE!",
