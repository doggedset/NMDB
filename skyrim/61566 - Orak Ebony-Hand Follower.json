No? Well too bad, because you just got one&#33;\r<br />Location\r<br />========\r<br />To find Orak, go to Falkreath. After reaching Falkreath go to the Dead Man&#39;s Drink. He should be there.\r<br />Details\r<br />=======\r<br />Orak Ebony-Hand is basically just the general follow you will get. It is my first mod and I tried hard to put as much effort as my current modding skill will allow (lol). So please don&#39;t get to hard on me if it&#39;s not perfect. Anyways, Orak Ebony-Hand&#39;s backstory starts like this: He was born in Skyrim in an Orc Stronghold. He was a sword-for-hire most his life but then his parents, who he loved and cared for, died. So, he left Skyrim briefly for High Rock but the Bretons disliked his presence. He consider moving to Cyrodiil, but with the Great War in full swing, he moved back to Skyrim, to Falkreath. Where he once again become a sword-for-hire, but without a price.\r<br />Please endorse if you like it &lt;3&#33;\r<br />Install\r<br />=======\r<br />This archive is distributed in WinRAR, 7Zip, or any other program that can open .RAR files.\r<br />It allows you to manually extract contents of the .RAR or .ZIP files to a certain folder.\r<br />Pick which method you are going to use for installation:\r<br />Manual Installation\r<br />- = or = -\r<br />NMM Installation\r<br />Manual Install\r<br />--------------\r<br />1.
