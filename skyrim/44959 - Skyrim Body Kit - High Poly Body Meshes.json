Well this mod is for you.\r<br />This is a Modders Resource mod contaning the most used body mods of the skyrim mod community (Meshes and Textures). And includes the default skeleton files. All meshes are High Poly (Have over 20,000 verticies for most of them)\r<br />\r<br />The body types contained in this file:\r<br />Default (Male and Female)\r<br />CBBE (Female)\r<br />Dimonized UNP (Female)\r<br />UNP (Female)\r<br />\r<br /> Installation:\r<br />\r<br /> Just Drag and drop the &#34;Skyrim Body Kit&#34; folder into any place on your computer (I suggest Desktop for easy access)\r<br /> \r<br />Credits:\r<br />I did not make these body mods all credit goes to the body mods author. Please support the author&#39;s if you want to have the body mod. This is purely used as a resource for armor modification and armor modeling.\r<br />\r<br />Authors: (Click the name to go to the body mod page)\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666//?] CBBE by Calinte[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21199//?] UNP By dimon99[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709//?] Dimonized UNP by dimon99[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4196//?] Full Male Body Mesh by Sundracon [/url]\r<br />\r<br />Body Mod Folders:\r<br />+ Full Body Meshes - High Poly (Mostly Quads little Tris)\r<br />+ Textures for the body mod contained inside the folder of the body mod\r<br />Each body mod folder contains a .OBJ version of the mesh and a .Blend (Blender) File\r<br />\r<br />I highly recommend getting blender and using the blender file versions as the blender files have the modifires intact and are not actually applied to the mesh so you can mess with the modifires.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s a little info on blender if you don&#39;t know what it is:\r<br />&#34;Blender is 3D creation for everyone, free to use for any purpose.\r<br />Free Software, great community, and 100% open.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Blender is a 3D modeling/game engine/animation/sculpting program all for free. if you don&#39;t know how to use it look at tutorials but you get quite a bit of  functionality with blender. As well as you can make plugins in the python scripting engine. Their is a lot of things on blender its well worth it and the best part its free. \r<br />[url=http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/]Blender download page[/url]\r<br />\r<br />The current stable version of blender is 2.68a\r<br />The current version of blender is:  2.69 (but it was released about a week ago from 101913)[/size]",
