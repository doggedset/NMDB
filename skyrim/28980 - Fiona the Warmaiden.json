  "descriptionHtml": "[b]What this mod does:[/b]\r\nThis mod adds a new follower to the game: Fiona! She is an expert with Two-Handers and Bows with the ability to heal herself. She\\'s wearing light armor to be fast and agile in combat.\r\n\r\n[b]Her Stats:[/b]\r\n- Essential (she will not permanently die)\r\n- Weapon of choice: Two-Handers and Bows\r\n- Armor: Light Armor\r\n- Magic: Fast Healing\r\n- Light Foot (makes no sound while sneaking)\r\n- Almost entire Two-Handed and Archery Skilltree (she kicks ass but is not overpowered!)\r\n- Auto-Level (has same level as the player - up to level 100)\r\n- Can be married\r\n\r\n[b]Location:[/b]\r\nFiona can be found in JORRVASKR! To find her, go to White-Run and enter the location where you can meet all the companions (Farkas, Aela and all these nice people). She usually hangs around in the main hall and stuffs her face =)\r\n\r\n[b]Requirements:[/b]\r\nNONE! Fiona and her look will totally blend in to your personal Skyrim visuals as if she was just another girl in the world. However, if you want Fiona to look 100% exactly like on the screenshots, you need [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812]Better Females By Bella[/url], which will change the look of all females in the game.\r\n\r\n[b]Installation:[/b]\r\nJust extract the two files into your data folder. That\\'s it =)\r\n\r\n[b]What this mod does NOT:[/b]\r\nThis mod does not add any new armors, textures, AI scripts or anything. Plain old Vanilla Skyrim can run this mod without any problems. If you like the armor she\\'s wearing, you can download the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25846]Tera Armor Collection for Skyrim[/url] and give her the same outfit as I did.",
