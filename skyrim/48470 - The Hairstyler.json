It also works of course\r<br />with modded NPCs like your companions and followers etc. and with the player (without need for the race menu).\r<br />\r<br />Now in version 1.4 there is a choice of 35 different hairstyles. Each hairstyle has an option of at least 5 hair colors (black, blonde, brown, red and white).\r<br />In total there are 176 hair objects to select.\r<br />\r<br />This mod does not add new hairstyles. It uses the hairstyles of the Apachii mods ApachiiSkyHair_v_1_5_Full, ApachiiSkyHairFemale_v_1_3\r<br />and ApachiiSkyHairMale_v_1_1, the Newsea hairstyle J117 Moonrise and the Nuska hairstyles Dagi02, the long straight Mohawk and the male Dagi01 hairstyle. A lot of thanks to Apachii and Newsea for permission to use the meshes and textures.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.4 contains both non-lore-style and lore-style haircuts.\r<br /> \r<br />[color=red]For all of you who are playing with Vilja and can&#39;t figure out why she reverts back to her default hair indoors... make sure that her manners are set to wear headgear at all times. The hair is a wig and is considered headgear. [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=4]How does this mod work?[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />As soon as the mod is installed for the first time the player character gets two spells:\r<br />\r<br />1. Change Hairstyle\r<br />This spell, targeted on an NPC actor of the default races, will change the hairstyle of the target.\r<br />\r<br />2. Change Hairstyle Self\r<br />This spell changes the hairstyle of the player character.\r<br />\r<br />After you have cast the spell a menu with the hairstyles opens. You will now see a non-colored model of each specific hairstyle.\r<br />To have a better look you can turn this model around with the left mouse button and zoom in by scrolling with the mouse-wheel.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The names of the hairstyles are sorted for an easier selection by: \r<br />\r<br />F/M - for female or male (the sex the hairstyle is primarily intended to fit to)\r<br />\r<br />Braids/Long/LongX/Medium/Short/Ponytail/PonytailXL - for the general type of hair\r<br />\r<br />ApachiiSkyHairFull/ApachiiskyHairFemale H(uman)/ApachiiSkyhairMale/Vanilla - for the source from which the meshes and textures derive from\r<br />\r<br />15 (for example) - for the number of the hairstyle in its respective mod.\r<br />\r<br />f/m - for the compatibility of the model with the female or male head. All the hairstyles are fitting the female head. But only the hairstyles\r<br />with an - m - are also fitting the male head. Other hairstyles are causing clipping.\r<br />\r<br />black/blonde/brown/red - for the available hair colors\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=4]And that&#39;s the procedure[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]CiAlJUG1PsE[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Give an NPC a new hairstyle\r<br />\r<br />- Choose the Change Hairstyle spell from the Alteration section in the magicka menu (key P)\r<br />\r<br />- Prepare the spell, aim and cast the Change Hairstyle Spell at the target you want to change the hairstyle.\r<br />\r<br />- The hairstyle menu will open. Click on your desired hairstyle. (It will then vanish from the list)\r<br />\r<br />- Press the TAB key to exit the menu and your target will equip the chosen hairstyle\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />How to remove the hairstyle and reset to default\r<br />\r<br />- Cast the Change Hairstyle Spell at the target you had changed the hairstyle.\r<br />\r<br />- Choose the Original Hairstyle\r<br />\r<br />- With closing the menu the spell target will be set back to the original hairstyle or headgear.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Give your PC a new hairstyle\r<br />\r<br />- Choose the Change Hairstyle Self spell from the Alteration section of the magicka menu\r<br />\r<br />- Prepare the spell and cast it\r<br />\r<br />- The hairstyle menu will open. Click on your desired hairstyle. (It will then vanish from the list)\r<br />\r<br />- Press the TAB key to exit the menu and your PC will equip the chosen hairstyle\r<br />\r<br />- Remove the hairstyle back and change to your previous hairstyle with casting the spell again and and selecting the Original Hairstyle.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The hairstyles have the armor rating of a Hide Helmet, so they offer a certain protection. They can be sold and they can be dropped.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=4]Limitations[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- The spells in version 1.4 won&#39;t work on Argonians, Khajiits, children, creatures like Draugr, trolls, chicken, cows and dragons and so on...\r<br />\r<br />- As long as the NPCs are wearing the hairstyles they won&#39;t equip helmets.  \r<br />\r<br />- If complete outfits with hoods use the Hair and Long Hair slot, the whole outfit will be unequipped and the actor will be naked.\r<br />\r<br />- The hair colors can&#39;t be changed with hair tints. For each hair color there has to be a model with a fixed hairtint.\r<br />\r<br />- This mod can&#39;t use the hairstyles directly from other mods. The models must be converted. This explains the large file size of the download.\r<br />\r<br />- I can&#39;t prevent the hairstyles from being removed in certain rare circumstances. Usually they remain equipped also with cell changes and \r<br />fast-travelling.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod won&#39;t screw up anything as all the changes can be undone. It was tested with Vilja, Cerwiden and the vanilla housecarls etc.\r<br />The mod is clean. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=4]Information for modders[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />For mod identification purpose I have put a Wolf Pelt into the HelpManualXBox formlist. For mod interaction all the hairstyles have the keyword  - LocTypeShip -. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=4]Installation[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />The easiest and most reliable way is to install manually. Unzip your download with 7zip or WinRAR etc.. Then drop the - Data - folder in your C:Program Files (x86)SteamSteamAppscommonSkyrim folder and let it merge. Make sure that it is activated in the Skyrim Launcher.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=4]Uninstall[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />The easiest way to uninstall the mod is to install it again. Immediately afterwards right-click somewhere on the desktop and choose - Undo copying -.\r<br />Or just delete the files LycHairstyler.esp and LycHairstyler.bsa in the C:Program Files (x86)SteamSteamAppscommonSkyrimData folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=4]Note[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod can of course be extended with other hairstyles from Apachii&#39;s mods or hairstyles from other mods.\r<br />Regarding this I will try to react on requests provided I get the permission of the authors. \r<br />All I need is the name and the URL of the mod, the name or number of the hairstyle and of course your preferred hair color.\r<br />Please understand that I can&#39;t answer on every request. I&#39;ll work especially on the hairstyles which are requested more than once.\r<br />This mod has already a rather large file size, so I can&#39;t add too many hairstyles. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=4]Credits[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Many thanks to\r<br />\r<br />- Apachii, who let me use the textures and meshes for conversion\r<br />- the creators of the original hairstyle models (all of them listed in Apachii&#39;s mod)\r<br />- Bethesda for this beautiful and brilliant game called Skyrim the Creation Kit, the most creative and entertaining &#34;game&#34; available on Steam\r<br />- Emma, for her huge support, hosting this mod on her website, testing and splendid ideas\r<br />- Amgepo for testing and valuable hints\r<br />- Croc for in depth testing and feedback\r<br />- ManleySteele for in depth testing and feedback\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=4]Freeware used[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Special thanks to the developers of these excellent freeware programs:\r<br />- NifSkope\r<br />- The Gimp 2.8\r<br />- Notepad++\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][size=4]Update to version 1.3 [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />The update requires the installed main file of v.1.2.
