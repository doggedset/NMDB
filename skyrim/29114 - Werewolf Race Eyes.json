  "descriptionHtml": "[center][url=https://www.youtube.com/user/GrantizEN/videos][img]http://i.imgbox.com/bY3cutRO[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://twitter.com/GrantizEN][size=5][color=00ACEE]and Join me on twitter.[/color][/size][/url]\r<br />\r<br />&#33;DAWNGUARD REQUIRED&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This Mod adds a race for the werewolf while in humanoid state. I mainly made this mod to change the eyes of your character when you become a werewolf much like the vampire. Now you can tell the difference between normal races and people who are werewolves. \r<br />\r<br />Dragonborn DLC - I have added some support for Dragonborn. Once the mod is installed it MUST be loaded after the original Werewolf Race Eyes esp MUST. If you have any issues let me know. personally i&#39;m not far enough to fully test them in game so THIS IS A BETA MOD. only on the nexus\r<br />\r<br />************************************************Compatibility:********************************************\r<br />\r<br />Just to let you know I have built this mod on a completely mod free install of Skyrim, Dawnguard, and Dragonborn. Not Compatible with mods that alter werewolves\r<br />\r<br />&#33;Beware&#33; this mod changes several vanilla scripts and some Dawnguard ones. Mainly to setup the transformation between a regular race and the werewolf race and back. If you have a mod that effects these scripts it probably won’t work.\r<br />\r<br />WARNING: Removing this file can be difficult as it makes changes that are permanently saved within your save file. Starting a new game after removal will work normally.  \r<br />\r<br />***************************************************The effected Scripts are:**************************************\r<br />\r<br />playervampirequestscript\r<br />playerwerewolfchangescript\r<br />cr13questscript\r<br />dlc1lycanthropyregiftquestscript\r<br />companionshousekeepingscript\r<br />qf_cr13_000e3163\r<br />dlc1vampireturnscript\r<br />c03rampagequest\r<br />\r<br />*****************************************Thank you everyone for your support&#33;*******************************",
