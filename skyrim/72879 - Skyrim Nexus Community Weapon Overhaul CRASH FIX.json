  "descriptionHtml": "Skyrim Nexus Community Weapon Overhaul is the only non boring weapon overhaul because it doesnt follow any specfic theme and you&#39;re always excited for whatever you&#39;re getting next but it made the game crash and the author did nothing about it so i decided to try fixing it and i think i did .\r<br />\r<br />also if you want a fix for Invisible Weapons all you have to do is unpack the BSA files using the built in BSA extractor in  Mod orgnaizer or any other BSA extractor you&#39;re aware of. simple\r<br />\r<br />this was made for personal use.\r<br />\r<br />if you still get crashes while using this mod (not likely i hope) tell me where you were and i will fix it up for you if i can.\r<br />\r<br />PEACE",
