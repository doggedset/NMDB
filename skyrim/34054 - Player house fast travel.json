  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a simple mod that I made which allows the player to fast travel to all the player houses in Skyrim. \r\nI currently don\\'t have any of the dlc homes included in this mod but I will add them in the future. \r\nInitially the house icons will show up on your map, just darker, but you wont be able to fast travel to them until you\\'ve \\\"found\\\" them. \r\n\r\nHouse names and locations: \r\nBreezehome - Whiterun \r\nHoneyside - Riften \r\nVindrel Hall - Markarth \r\nHjerim - Windhelm \r\nProudspire Manor - Solitude \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you notice any bugs or if something doesn\\'t seem right let me know! \r\nNote: If the screenshots look weird or different to you it\\'s because I\\'m using a few different mods.",
