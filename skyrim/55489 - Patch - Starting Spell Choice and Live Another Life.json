  "descriptionHtml": "This patch is to bring [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10254/]Starting Spell Choice[/url] by AliTheLord back in compatibility with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/]Alternate Start - Live Another Life[/url] by Arthmoor.\r<br />As such, it (obviously) REQUIRES both files.\r<br />\r<br />----\r<br />\r<br />[b]What Does This [s]Mod[/s] Patch Do?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />All I did was go into the CK and plop in a duplicate of the apothecary&#39;s satchel container and put the five spell choice scrolls (Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Illusion, Restoration Memories) in its inventory, non-respawning, and placed the thing in the starting cell used by Live Another Life.\r<br />\r<br />[u]In summation:[/u] On the table in the prison cell is a &#34;Battered Satchel.&#34; Inside are the memory scrolls-- only one of each, and only available to be taken once.\r<br />\r<br />----\r<br />\r<br />[b]Why Did I Make This?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />When Arthmoor updated LAL to version 2.4.0, he moved the start from a free-floating prison cell (where character creation and new life choice happened) to an in-world prison cell in the Abandoned Prison. The compatibility patch AliTheLord had made for their two mods (putting the &#34;memories&#34; scrolls for spell choice in the inventory of the skeleton in the original cell) was thusly rendered ineffective. After inquiring with AliTheLord if s/he intended to update and receiving no answer, I have decided to release the modification to the patch. (I do hope I am not stepping on any toes.)\r<br />\r<br />----\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation Instructions:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />1) Download and activate with mod manager, ensuring this patch is loaded BELOW/AFTER both Alternate Start and Starting Spell Choice.\r<br />\r<br />OR\r<br />\r<br />2) Download manually and pop it into the same folder as your Skyrim.exe. (I think that&#39;s all there is to that, right?)",
