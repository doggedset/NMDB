Ranger\\'s Valley Lodge is a fully exterior house mod with NO LOAD SCREENS, full crating, labeled storage, and more.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this fall-foliage house is to offer a completely seamless experience for the player.  There are no loading screens anywhere in this mod.  Simply fast travel to your new house and step right inside.  Unlike other shack and cabin mods, this is a full-sized house with all of your crafting needs.  The lodge is located southeast of Riften, near the Lost Prospect Mine.\r\n\r\n-NO LOAD SCREENS\\'\r\n-Full Crafting with Forge & Smelter\r\n-Labeled Storage\r\n-Weapon Racks & Plaques\r\n-Outdoor Bar\r\n-Follower Friendly\r\n-Spouse Friendly (with this mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11370)\r\n-Archery Range\r\n-Fishing camp with guest lodge and tent\r\n\r\nNOTE: Credit for inspiration for this mod goes to MaGlass\\' Riften Ranger Shack.  Ranger\\'s Valley Lodge originally began as an expansion to Riften Ranger Shack, but the expansion quickly turned into a complete rebuilding.  The location remains the same, so note that these two mods will conflict with each other.  But please check out MaGlass\\'s mod here if you want to see the original: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9245\r\n\r\nSpecial credit should be given to MaGlass for the design of the chimney and fireplace.\r\n",
