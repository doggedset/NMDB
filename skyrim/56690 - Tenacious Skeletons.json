  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][center][color=#ead1dc]Changes Made[/color][/center][/size]Vanilla Skeleton HP raise from 20 to 50.  Vanilla Skeleton now have base armor rating.  Maces are now 50% more effective against skeletons.  Skeletons now immune to arrows.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][center][color=#76a5af]Reasons for this change[/color][/center][/size]I like the idea of a Paladin character taking down the dead with the mace as his weapon of choice, therefore I wanted the Paladin to be more effective against skeletons as opposed to an assassin who uses blades or arrows.  To cater to this preference, I made maces 50% stronger against skeletons (Bone Smash&#33;), made &#34;base armor rating&#34; part of skeleton durability to strengthen the value of the &#34;Bone Breaker&#34; perk, and made skeletons immune to arrows (No flesh to pierce).\r<br />\r<br />Skeletons are now a threat to the player, more specifically, a stubborn threat that is constantly in the way.  They can&#39;t be taken down with feeble arrows, best way to take them down is SMASHING them to pieces.\r<br />\r<br />This mod was made to cater to my Paladin character. Now I have a viable reason to wield a mace as my weapon of choice, to cleanse Skyrim of evil&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][center][color=#6aa84f]Should I download this mod?[/color][/center][/size]Only if you want skeletons to have a backbone, and if you have the patience to take them down.  This mod works best with mods that accelerate combat (More damage EVERYWHERE), but feels good to me in vanilla.\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=5][color=#f1c232]What change should I expect in my gameplay?[/color]\r<br />[/size][/center]You can only take them down in melee range, best method is to smash, and smash good.  Skeletons will take around 12 hits before going down with any axe or sword.  Maces take them down much faster (They suffer bonus damage from maces since they are all bones).  Once you get the first bone breaker perk, skeletons become even more vulnerable to maces.\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=5][color=#ffff00]I wanted tougher skeletons, but not THAT TOUGH&#33;&#33;&#33;[/color][/size][/center]I can make other versions of this mod which tones down the changes and remove certain features.  Drop a comment and I&#39;ll see what I can do (How many hits do you want those piles of bone to take before they go down?  Make sure to mention this).\r<br />\r<br />Also, make sure to check the optional files section, all request files I make are made available to everyone, your ideal version might already be there.",
