So i present you with this model and maybe someone else can use it for a cool weapon mod in skyrim and if you do decide to use it please leave me some credit and when you make the mod let me know :P if you dont mind.\r\nI used Cinema 4D R13 to model this and will not supply any other formats for this file/model. \r\nNo textures come with this model.",
