  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a small player home to Ivarstead that replaces the broken down shack where you find Narfi. The key to the cottage is on the table on the porch. Whitewash is fully furnished and equipped with an Anvil, Sharpening Wheel, Workbench, Smelter, Tanning Rack, Chopping Block, Small Farm, Enchanter, Alchemy Lab, Mannequins, and more. [One of the mannequins may be walking around when you first enter. Just go down to where he should be, click on the empty space, and equip something on him. It&#39;ll bring him back permanently.] There&#39;s also a room connected to the basement that has a door to each of the nice Cities/Towns, without the travel time. They&#39;ll get you to your shopping before the stores close&#33;\r<br />\r<br />In the screenshots you can see the mods &#34;Dovahkiin Relaxes Too&#34; and &#34;A Quality World Map - With Roads&#34; \r<br />Check em both out&#33;",
