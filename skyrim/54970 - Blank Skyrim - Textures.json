So I simply used BSA unpacker to unpack the original &#34;vanilla&#34; bsa, and copied and pasted it over my installed game textures folder. When it asked to replace textures, I just asked it to &#34;skip&#34; all textures that might be overwritten (by vanilla) and was thus able to obtain the missing (unreplaced) textures even though I wasn&#39;t quite sure which ones they were. I would suggest that anyone using this tactic do so very carefully and only after making a backup because you could easily lose all your texture replacements.
