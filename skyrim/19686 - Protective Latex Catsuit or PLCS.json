  "descriptionHtml": "Protective Latex Catsuit (PLCS)\r\n\r\nAs of now this contains my take on a latex catsuit that also has transparency so as to show the underlying body. It contains the shine that I saw best portrays the gloss of actual latex clothing from pictures. Not perfect, but again it is my own take and made it for fun as I like the look of such clothing. I will not make any gothic accessories or heels etc, the community is more than welcome and able to do that far better than I am. I simply am not interested it that stuff. I also am looking for some modders that can help me fix some problems that are beyond my abilities. This took me forever to make and get right, and a lot of my mesh work relies heavily on the work of the MetalBodySuits by antuniut in conceptional design only. I created these \\\"armors\\\" from scratch starting out with simply the body mod. This was a project that I thought would be fun to add something i thought was eyecandy. I don\\'t care if this isn\\'t your thing. It\\'s just something I did for fun lol. \r\n\r\nSee Credits for links to body mods.\r\n\r\nCOMING SOON, but need someone\\'s help/haven\\'t finished :\r\nA catsuit that can be worn under existing armors (perhaps as a necklace object slot) very similar to the body glove in oblivion.\r\n****Compatible with the in game weight slider (as of now I can only create _1 and _0 where everything in between is not working)***** - Need A Modder\\'s help!!!!!\r\nGloves.\r\nSocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nThanks to Antoniut for his MetalBodySuits.\r\nThanks to AcDale for the ADEC body which can be found here, http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5390.",
