  "modName": "Healthier Skeevers",
  "summary": "A cuter skeever retexture.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a replacement texture for the skeever intended to make them more pleasant to look at. I removed the festering sores, gave it a soft, healthy coat, covered it entirely with fur, whitened the teeth, changed the eye color--basically rebuilt the entire texture. I tried to give it markings that would set it apart from wolves, like the white stripe down the back of the light grey one and the green eyes of the black one. Choose low, medium or high resolution as you see fit.\r\n\r\nThis is just a retex. Of course, it doesn\\'t change any stats and you can still contract ataxia from skeever bites. Comments and criticisms are welcome. If you prefer a retexture that more closely resembles the vanilla skeever, please check out Bellyache\\'s wonderful Animal & Creature Pack at http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3621\r\n\r\nFor immersion purposes, I recommend the Cowardly Wolves and Skeevers mod by Jpro6 found here: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2590. Their cuteness is more acceptable when their behavior is non-aggressive.\r\n\r\nInstallation: Use manual installation. Just drop the folder into your Skyrim folder and overwrite any existing files if you previously installed  this or another retex; default path C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/Steam apps/Common/Skyrim. The correct path for the skeever.dds and skeever_n.dds files should be Skyrim/Data/Textures/Actors/Skeever. Skeevertail.dds and skeevertail_n.dds should go in Skyrim/Textures/Clutter/Ingredients. Hopefully, I got everything in the right folders for you though.\r\n\r\nOnly download this file from the Skyrim Nexus! If you found  it anywhere else on the Web, I didn\\'t put it there and can\\'t be held responsible for its content.\r\n\r\nNote: Use only one of the files, either the light grey or black. I have no way to make both appear in game at this time.\r\n\r\nConflicts: None, except other retextures for the skeever or skeever tail ingredient.\r\n\r\nThis mod is not for you if:\r\n\r\n1. You don\\'t want your skeevers to be cute.\r\n2. You don\\'t like my work.\r\n3. You don\\'t like the idea of modding your game and think everyone should play vanilla Skyrim.\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0: Black skeever added. Skeever Tail ingredient retex added. Improved normal maps. Improved the light grey texture a little. Readme added. File now includes both the light grey and black skeevers.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1: Added a couple of missing teeth back in.\r\n\r\nComing eventually (after the CK is released and I learn how to use it): A mod that makes both the grey and black appear in game.",
