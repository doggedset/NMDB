This took me some time as I\\'ve never attempted any elven style engravings and etc before, so it was also a learning experience.\r\nI\\'m yet to do the helmet, who wants to wear that goofy looking helmet anyway? Hehe.  I\\'ll get around to doing it, or possibly using another mesh, we\\'ll see.\r\n\r\nRe-releasing this as the previous upload had comment errors that couldn\\'t be fixed.\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=yellow]Credits: [/color][/size]\r\nAll 100% scratch made by Jahga/Kraxxuz, (my username depends on which site it is at, Steam Workshop or Skyrim Nexus, but I am the same person) with the exception of one metal texture overlay that I used in collaboration with some I made myself big thanks to wojtar-stock on DeviantArt for it.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check him out http://wojtar-stock.deviantart.com/\r\n\r\nFeel free to do with this mod whatever you wish, just credit me and please contact me beforehand.  I\\'d just like to know where/how it is being used/uploaded.",
