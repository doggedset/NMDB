Immerse yourself in PerMa&#39;s fluffy perk descriptions while building your characters exactly the way you want them. Various grammer and spelling errors have been corrected and many non-fluff descriptions from PerMa&#39;s documentation have been rewritten to better convey information. No more will you be required to solve mathematical equations while sorting through your options, for I have done this for you.\r<br />\r<br />Also, each description has been rewritten in first-person to give perks more of a personal touch and to complement the TTYM - Think to Yourself Messages mod, that many use.\r<br />\r<br />---------------\r<br />[b]Optional[/b]\r<br />---------------\r<br />I have neatly organized my alterations into text documents and included them as an optional download, in case one might like to read through them before installing the mod or whatever.\r<br />\r<br />---------------\r<br />[b]Installation[/b]\r<br />---------------\r<br />This mod requires [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59849/?]T3nd0&#39;s Perkus Maximus[/url].\r<br />Install with your favorite mod manager, or drop the .esp files into your data folder and overwrite.\r<br />\r<br />---------------\r<br />[b]Credits[/b]\r<br />---------------\r<br />T3nd0&#39;s Perkus Maximus",
