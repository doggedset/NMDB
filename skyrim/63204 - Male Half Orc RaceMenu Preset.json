I wanted him to look more human than orc.\r<br />\r<br />His mouth was sculpted with RaceMenu sculptor to lower his teeth down and close his mouth.\r<br />The nose is a Nord nose. I saved a preset as a human with his nose and loaded it over to the orc.\r<br />\r<br />All you need is race menu.\r<br />\r<br />*EDIT Added 2 Presets - Thunderoc is my orginal and More Orcish version is just orc skin.",
