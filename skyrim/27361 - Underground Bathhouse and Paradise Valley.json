The basic idea of many features still came from Migal130s beautiful mod and his work inspired me to learn more about scripting and making such stuff possible.\r<br />\r<br />This player home is an esm file, meaning you can easily do your own supplement mods for it if you like, e.g. replacing the female occupants with males, additional rooms etc.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Featured on[/b]\r<br />If you review this mod or make a preview movie just let me know and I gladly place a link here.\r<br />\r<br />ÆRYS THE MAD DOVAHKING in his Slyrim Mods XBox 360 (wow does the XBox have shitty graphics ...)\r<br />\r<br />SurprisedRook with a Skyrim Mod Quicky                   \r<br />[youtube]tjPgAkD4eUQ[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]nYhI0VV5P5g[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Gamingfor Perverts in his SKYRIM ADULT MOD - Underground Bathhouse and Paradise Valley  \r<br />[youtube]mLiv7R__WqY[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Mxr Mods featured the bathhouse in Skyrim Mods - Week 194  \r<br />[youtube]ntrX8kkfrP4[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim - mods 18+ - Ep 14\r<br />[youtube]RNqgWRK09CQ[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Reynard131 did a very nice mod review of the paradise valley.\r<br />[youtube]6WOGh1wphj4[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />JC did an Afterdark Youtube video about the bathhouse (without Sexy Solitude Mod installed)\r<br />[youtube]V7vsGdrMc3w[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />SkyReview did a short video about the bathhouse \r<br />[youtube]YJhJ0o-zhnA[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />A nice Review including some nice explanation how to fix mods and conflicts by zzsquadron (jo jackson)\r<br />[youtube]P7bayxneshA[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Change log:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Update Procedure Version 6:[/b][/color]\r<br />It is strongly recommended to use a new save after updating as there is no such thing as a clean save. However if you do not change your\r<br />installed configuration (choosing the same options as before) you should be able to do it with only minor problems. Please remove everything \r<br />from following containers: the chest right in front of the master bed, the weapon display above the mask display.\r<br />However please be aware that following problems might occur on an old savegame: containers could be in odd locations as I moved some of them\r<br />and they could stay where they originally were (especially in the bedroom). The ore spots in the cavern will not work as expected. Some scripts\r<br />might not work as expected, especially when you move to cell files you have not used before, but those should only be minor issues. \r<br />\r<br />To update to Version 6, you need to disable every mod that has UndergroundBathhouse.esm as master. Every optional esp, the tapestry and unique npc\r<br />mod or the friendly guard patch (which should also be no longer necessary as I fixed a lot of factions). Only mod that can stay is the summerwear\r<br />integration optional file. Everything else needed can be installed by the choosing the options in the FoMod Installer with Nexus Mod Manager. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />v.6.0\r<br />FOMOD installer including extra mods like unique npc, erotic wall tapestry and all optional files. Simply chose at install.\r<br />Added an autosorting containersystem to the bathhouse. It sorts items put into a special container into 21 categories\r<br />Melted all Underground Bathouse Mods (Main, Erotic Tapestry, Apachii Hair, Unique NPC, Heartfire Adoption) into one FOMod Installer\r<br />Added 4 graphical versions of the bathhouse (vanilla, vanilla hires, wooden and sexy) to choose what you prefer in the installer.\r<br />Extended the dark area cell a little for future uses\r<br />Extended the kitchen including a fridge, pantry and garbage incinerator\r<br />Added more teleport locations including Hearthfire and Dragonborne Home (no DLC required. They simply only work when DLC is present)\r<br />Added a xp giving practice dummy to the armory\r<br />Added some cheat buttons and standing stones to the secret areas\r<br />Added some itemgiving containers to the kitchen, bar and maintenance room. Activate them sneaking to get the extra menus or item adds.\r<br />Changed a lot of textures to fit the main statics.\r<br />Added a bedroom mirror that can open the racemenu for changing the players appearance\r<br />All inside watefalls and water taps are now toggable.\r<br />Display museum in the display room.\r<br />Hearthfire adoption addon now works on the cell file as well.\r<br />Cleaned the esm file even more. Only touches Tamriel cells 11,-2 and 11,-3 and the wall lean marker (that one is intentionally making all wall lean markers usable by the player)\r<br />Added a divine set of dragon armor and deadric weapons as well as some leisure kimonos.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />v.5.3\r<br />Added LOD to paradise valley. The valley wall should no longer fade when to far away.\r<br />Changed the beach sand texture so it is not that bright anylonger\r<br />Prepared statics and navmesh for the optional heartfire adoption file.\r<br />Added a couple more idle markers to the interior. \r<br />Corrected, changed and added a couple of various statics.\r<br />\r<br />v.5.2 \r<br />Correction of errors in 5.1\r<br />\r<br />v.5.1\r<br />Small update to fix a missing texture and some gapping issue in Version 5.0.\r<br />\r<br />v.5.0\r<br />Added an outside worldspace paradise valley, the perfect setting for the Underground Bathhouse entrance.\r<br />Extended the jail area of the dark area cell with various adult oriented items. For now just for showcase but as stage for future additional mods. Thanks goes to MasterCChris and XAZ for allowing me to use assets from ZaZ-Animation-Pack. This only is done for the dark area cell as it would simply overload the main cell\r<br />Added a secret hideout (kind of panic room). If you can find this one without the use of console or CK you have looked well ;)  This place has a couple of treasure chests and no respawn barrels to stack you most valuable treasure\r<br />Reduced the power of the guards by reducing the initial level from 40 to 20. They will grow with the character with 100 max.\r<br />Changed the cell door names so that they now reflect the area they are leading to.\r<br />Added a storage area to the kitchen which has no-respawn containers. Beware: The containers near the oven are still respawn food containers.\r<br />Added a kids room attaching to the master bedroom. This room is initially disabled to be utilized by a near future mod that allows adoption if you have moved in with your spouse.\r<br />Overworked the Ai-Packages to cater to the outside area of paradise valley.\r<br />Fixed some occlusion layer problems and some minor clipping and display issues.\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Update Procedure:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Best practice would be to do a clean save but I know this is a hassle, so at least take a few precautions. As this moves the entrance area you should not save right outside \r<br />the old entrance. The inside of the bathhouse should work but if not just zone into Whitrun and save there. \r<br />\r<br />You will have to update the cell files you are using as well to make them uptodate. If you are using  the Unique NPC Mod you will need to update as well or you will get the \r<br />grey headbug as the headfiles get overwritten by the new version. The AI will also not work and no npc will go outside if you don&#39;t update the unique npc mod.\r<br />\r<br />Please update the UB-tapestry mod as well, as it was necessary to move one painting due to the changed cell area.\r<br />\r<br />The BBLS Merger Mod will not work with Version 5.0 and I think that is not longer necessary as the bathhouse has a nice outside area now. If you want the merger you probably will\r<br />have to stay with version 4.8.\r<br />\r<br />v.4.8\r<br />Added occlusion planes to the main bathhouse cell. This should increase performance a lot. Thanks go to rgabriel15 and his Skyrim Project Optimization that showed me how to do it. His misc file for the bathhouse optimation is no longer necessary form this version on.\r<br />Added working mask stands that will not interfere with the original script. (Please remove anything that is in the 4 dagger display cases in the corner of the display room, as the stands are where they were)\r<br />Fixed the savegame scripting issue with shackles and jail dialogues and added shackle support for followers (still only works when dark area is in its own cell)\r<br />Fixed the ore spots in the cavern. They should be functioning now.\r<br />Fixed a couple of corrupted bookshelves in the bedroom cell libary. If you run the bedroom in its own cell please remove any book from the first 4 bokshelves next to the libary entrance\r<br />Added some minor stuff like mirrored statues, kitchen clutter and a dark area carpets and fixed some clipping and gapping.\r<br />Added a seq file so that no longer a save and reload is needed for new dialogues to show. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Script Fix if shackle and jail dialogue are not working properly when using the ub_cell_darkarea.esp file[/b]\r<br />\r<br />1) remove any item or npc you have placed in the dark area\r<br />2) turn off ub_cell_darkarea.esp\r<br />3) load your current savegame\r<br />4) ENTER the bathhouse\r<br />5) save\r<br />6) turn on ub_cell_darkarea.esp\r<br />7) load the save from step 5 and all should work properly\r<br />\r<br />v 4.6\r<br />Fixed a navmeshbug in the Master Bedroom cell. So followers will now follow and spouses will do what they are supposed to do when the master bedroom is in its own cell.\r<br />Fixed an sandbox issue with dark area occupants not reaching their destination when the dark area was in its own cell. Please also load the optional file patch for that cell.\r<br />Fixed 2 teleportation spots to Windhelm and Solitude as they were not working.\r<br />Fixed some clipping and fitting issues that I came across.\r<br />\r<br />v 4.5 \r<br />[b]Make sure you remove all items from the areas you want to enable the optional cell files for. Containers are not the same.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />(Beware that without optional files to move areas into their own cells, this cell is huge, probably the biggest indoor cell in the game. Please use some or all of the optional cell files if you have performance issues.)\r<br />Added a secret dark area for those evil npcs and players to enjoy including a jail and blood pools. Added a cavern as well.\r<br />Added a teleport room to all cities, 2 custom teleports for the player to set by spell and a teleport spell to the bathhouse. All scripted, so no all questmarkers point to one room issue. Optional file to disable this room if people think this is cheating ;)\r<br />Added 4 slots for evil npc and 2 slots to the jail area with dialogues to occupy those slots. Optional shackle slots for occupants. \r<br />Added 8 optional esp files to make almost every room its own cell, enabling individual performance tweaking. Just disable unimportant rooms to save performance. No more light version necessary.\r<br />Added 1 optional esp file to disable the teleport room and spells for people who think this is cheating or have lore concerns.\r<br />\r<br />v 4.0\r<br />Added a missing alchemy table and two more markers in the main shower.\r<br />Fixed the player chest issue. The mod will no longer place elven armor in all player chests. If you got anything in the two armory chests, please remove before upgrade.\r<br />Made some adjustments in preparations for future additions. \r<br />Some minor changes and fixes.  \r<br />\r<br />v 3.5\r<br />Added the option to invite just about any NPC in the game to live there, no matter what expansion or what kind of NPC that is. Please read the article on how that works and what the danger might be.\r<br />Repaired the weapon plates in the display room. They should work as intended now.\r<br />Added multiple wall containers to the working area and removed the 4 chests in the hallway. If you got anything in there, please take it out before upgrading or the items will be lost.\r<br />Added an optional File &#39;ub_invite_any_npc.esp&#39; to the download area to enable the all NPC invite option by adding a necklace onto the libary table.\r<br />\r<br />v 3.1\r<br />Changed the dialogue options so only a short one is on top and the rest is in subdialogues.\r<br />Placed a lean marker on the round ledge at the entrance. Nice spot for a player overlook. \r<br />Placed a extra light in the working area so people with lighting mods can actually see something. Made the light brighter in the kitchen as well.\r<br />Added a shooting range where you can practice. The guards train there as well.\r<br />Some minor fixes. \r<br />\r<br />v 3.0\r<br />Added a small armory and 4 guards. They can be replaced by followers using a dialog option. They will be put back by releasing the custom follower guard\r<br />Added the same kind of dialog to the other npc making the optional file unneccessary. [b]You need to disable ub_npcfree.esp for Version 3.0[/b] on or you will have a non working version.\r<br />Changed the private shower and washing table location for better visibility.\r<br />Added the default outfit clothing to the inventory, so the girls dress again after you tell them to and have not given them custom clothing.\r<br />Bug fix of the restroom sit down marker. Should work for everyone now.\r<br />Removed some artifacts, fixed some minor clipping and navmesh issues to clean up some more.\r<br />\r<br />v 2.5 \r<br />Added a light source to the entrance outside that will light up at nighttime. \r<br />Added 2 Vendors (Viola and Elarie)\r<br />Added a bard (Viola) to play a nice tune when asked for\r<br />Replaced some clutter at the private whirlpool area that was movable but could not be picked up\r<br />Made some changes to fix the problem when unistalling the optional file. The NPC that use the optional slots will just go home. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />v 2.2 \r<br />Fixed the missing script files of version 2.1\r<br />\r<br />v 2.1 \r<br />Subbranched the outfit dialogue and fixed a bug not opening the inventory when not called the &#39;Best Gear dialogue&#39; first. \r<br />Removed the magic tree in the private bathing area and replaced it with a custom dibella statue.\r<br />Fixed some minor clipping errors.\r<br />\r<br />v 2.0 \r<br />First standalone release.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Required Files:[/b]\r<br />none\r<br />\r<br />[b]Optional Files:[/b]\r<br />There are 8 optional files that can move certain areas into their own cell to ease the load. Those can be used in any order and any number. E.g. If you want to do 2 just enable those 2 \r<br />and disable the other 6 ...\r<br />There is an optional file placing Apachii Hairstyles on Bathhouse redidents. ApachiiSkyhair 1.5 and the optional femalehairstyles 1.2 are required.\r<br />There is 1 optional file to disable the teleport room for the lore guys out there\r<br />There is 1 optional file to place the All_npc_invite amulet on the libray table.\r<br />There is 1 optional file that adds adotption and a child room. Requires Hearthfire DLC and Hearthfire multiple adoptions to work\r<br />Please see the articles regardng the optional files\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\r<br />Use the NexusModManager to autoinstall.\r<br />or\r<br />If you want to do it manually you have to decide which directories (options) you want to drop into the data directory. The structure is not that hard to deciver, but you need to copy at least the 01_core directory and one of the subdirectories of 02_version directory in your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Uninstallation:[/b]\r<br />Disable the mod in NexusModManager\r<br />or \r<br />manually remove following files and directories (not all must be present, depending on the installation options)\r<br />\r<br />Directories and all subdirectories or files in them (might not all be present, depending on the mods you did install)\r<br />\r<br />textures/bblsbathhouse\r<br />textures/architecture/ubh\r<br />textures/terrain/00_andragon_valley\r<br />textures/actors/character/facegendata/facegendata/facetint/undergroundbathhouse.esm  (this is a directory not a file)\r<br />textures/actors/character/ub_bodies  \r<br />meshes/bblsbathhouse\r<br />meshes/architecture/ubh\r<br />meshes/terrain/00_andragon_valley\r<br />meshes/actors/character/facegendata/facegenom/undergroundbathhouse.esm  (this is a directory not a file)\r<br />meshes/actors/character/ub_bodies  \r<br />\r<br />Single Files: (might not all be present, depending on the mods you did install)\r<br />\r<br />lodsettings/00_andragon_valley.lod\r<br />UndergroundBathhouse.esm\r<br />UndergroundBathhouse.bsa\r<br />UndergroundBathhouse_readme.txt\r<br />ub_tapestry.esp\r<br />ub_apachii_hair.esp\r<br />ub_npc_rework.esp\r<br />ub_invite_any_npc.esp\r<br />ub_cell_armory.esp\r<br />ub_cell_bedroom.esp\r<br />ub_cell_cavern.esp\r<br />ub_cell_darkarea.esp\r<br />ub_cell_dislayroom.esp\r<br />ub_cell_kitchen.esp\r<br />ub_cell_maintenance_room.esp\r<br />ub_cell_teleportroom.esp\r<br />ub_disable_teleportroom.esp\r<br />ub_adoption_hearthfire_extention.esp\r<br />ub_*.txt (all installed readme files)\r<br />scripts/bh* (all files that start with bh)\r<br />scripts/bh5_* (all files that start with bh5_)\r<br />scripts/batheffectscript.pex\r<br />scripts/bathtriggercript.pex\r<br />scripts/bedtriggercript.pex\r<br />scripts/pooltriggercript.pex\r<br />scripts/closedoor.pex\r<br />scripts/source/all corresponding source files of the above script files\r<br />seq/undergroundbathhouse.seq\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Hearthfire Adoption system addon.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT:\r<br />This optional choice requires both the Hearthfire DLC and the Hearthfire multiple adoptions mod at: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />This will add a childs room extention to the bedroom including 6 beds for kids to adopt. \r<br />\r<br />Usage:\r<br />The Hearthfire multiple adoptions mod will add a spell &#39;Bless Home&#39; to the player. This spell must be cast inside the bathhouse.\r<br />You can choose to use the bathhouse as your family home and use it as intended by that mod.\r<br />This also works for your spouse and is an option instead of using the bathhouse dialogue to move the spouse in. \r<br />\r<br />If you want to switch to the bedroom cell file please move all children and spouse out first to other houses. Then switch to the cell file, zone into the bathhouse and zone into the cell. Than cast the Bless home spell again, if you see the master bed. \r<br />If it is not present, zone out of the cell again and move a little around in the bathhouse and zone back in. The bed should be visible and you can cast the Bless Home spell. There is a trigger in front of the door, that switches stuff on and off so the hearthire scripts don&#39;t get confused. If there is a lot of load the script might not firse the first time so that is the reason to zone in and out in that case.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4][b]Known Issues:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Please make sure you got skyrim in the latest version  as this mod was done with latest CK and this requires you to have an up-to-date Version.\r<br />\r<br />If you invite 10 standalone followers (or more by replacing vanilla guards and occupants that come with their own meshes and textures you might need a good machine. Just place additional NPC with care for your machines performance.\r<br />\r<br />Mannequins are still bugged, so it is highly recommended to use: Vanilla Mannequin Script Fix by SLuckyD http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10652\r<br />or any other mannequinn fixer. If you like mannequins you probably have something like this already, to prevent the mannequins from doing weird stuff.\r<br />\r<br />Teleport room might not work together with city changing mods that will delete or modify the location markers in the location cities. Open cities for sure won&#39;t work and others might or might not work depending on how they changed the markers I used as teleportlocations\r<br />\r<br />Updating to a new version of an old savegame could make some stuff behave weird, like the ore spots, moved containers and some scripts. \r<br />\r<br />Changing to cell files or back in a current savegame might not work as intended.\r<br />\r<br />Using the bedroom cell file with the Hearthfire Adoption Option might not work on an old savegame that has not used the bedroom cell before updating, as there was a blackscreen for me in testing when zoneing into the bathhouse. New games worked just fine.\r<br />\r<br />Due to scripting beeing part of the savegames, some functions might not work properly when additional cells are used on an already installed bathhouse. A clean save will fix those issues. A 31 day nap might be needed as well in certain cases. To do this properly, remove all items and npc from the bathhouse, fast travel to a far away cell like markath, save. Exit the game disable all ub related esm and esp files. Reload the save and resave. Exit and reload. Press T and take a 24 hour nap. Repeat that 30 times. Save the game. Exit, reenable the bathhouse esm and all wanted cell files. Load and restock the house with items and npc. All should work fine.\r<br />\r<br />If an enchanted item is put into the walkin closet rack or displays the enchantment is taken off when picked up directly. Workaround is taking those items out of the container directly the way you placed them in the first place. Also if enchanted items are used in the autosorter they might not show up at all and vanish.\r<br />\r<br />The autosorting system and the display room system is very fragile to other mods changing items and item IDs. There might be conflicts resulting in items not showing up or vanishing.\r<br />\r<br />Follower mods with &#34;In-Game Body Changer&#34; spells post a problem when used on a follower living in the bathhouse. When the body changer spell is activated, it might reset the NPC and so uninvites the follower from the Bathhouse without properly unregistring the follower, so the slot stays taken.\r<br />So to properly change the body of such Follower, uninvite the follwoer first, change the body and reinvite.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4][b]FAQ[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ffff00][i]I am falling thru the floor, how can I fix that?[/i][/color]\r<br />You installed manually and did not put one of the 02_version directory files in.
