Works for both Male and Female characters.\r\n\r\nI got the idea for this from the Ancient Dragons in-game, they are red rather than yellow like the other lesser dragons.\r\nOne thing I disliked about the original armor is that the horns on the helm are black rather than the same color as the rest of the armor even though they\\'re made from dragon bones as well, so I re-textured the horns to be red as well.\r\n\r\nOriginally I made this for myself but I figured I might as well release it in case anybody else wants to use it.\r\n\r\nEdit: I made more skins (on request) that might look better than this.\r\nhere they are: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=319",
