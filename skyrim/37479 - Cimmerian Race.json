  "descriptionHtml": "This mod brings Conan\\'s Race to Skyrim \r\nVery lore friendly\r\nI know there are already a few versions of the Cimmerian race on here but I figured for the ones of you who like my work here is another race mod for you to have fun with. \r\nCustom abilities\r\nConan style fighting \r\nCrom\\'s blessing \r\nConan stamina\r\n\r\nDescription \r\n Fire and wind come from the sky, from the gods of the sky. But Crom is your god, Crom and he lives in the earth. Once, giants lived in the Earth.  And in the darkness of chaos, they fooled Crom, and they took from him the enigma of steel. Crom was angered. And the Earth shook. Fire and wind struck down these giants, and they threw their bodies into the waters, but in their rage, the gods forgot the secret of steel and left it on the battlefield. We who found it are just men. Not gods. Not giants. Just men. The secret of steel has always carried with it a mystery. You must learn its riddle, Conan. You must learn its discipline. For no one - no one in this world can you trust. Not men, not women, not beasts.\r\n\r\nOptional files\r\nCustom banner I made, to get this in game you need to pull it up in the creation kit and place where ever you like\r\nCustom robes for both men and women (Stygians style robe look at my images for reference) \r\n\r\n\\\"I pray to the four winds. Hah hah ha, Crom laughs at your four winds\\\" \r\n\r\nTo look like Arnold Schwarzenneger: Conan \\\"The Real Barbarian\\\"\r\n  \r\nPrometheus Conan armor here on the Nexus\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4793\r\n\r\nYou will also need to download the following mods: \r\n\r\nBetter males - Beautiful nudes and faces - \r\nUSE the optional file [BetterMales - Nudes - NoMoreBlockyFaces v2-0] \r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2488 \r\n\r\nTelthalions Finer Hair standard version \r\nby Thelhalion \r\n(http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2207) \r\n\r\nVery special Thanks go to Robert Ervin Howard for creating Conan. \r\nThis is for you conan fans out there\r\nEnjoy",
