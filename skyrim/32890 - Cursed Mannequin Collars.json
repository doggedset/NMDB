  "descriptionHtml": "Psst, don&#39;t tell anyone: Taarie and Endarie from Radiant Raiments in Solitude now sell some special dresses in their basement. Ok... the dresses aren&#39;t that special but they also got two high def mannequin statues down there. They look so real it is hard to believe they are really just statues...\r<br />\r<br />Long story short: The Cursed Mannequin Collars turn any NPC into a fully functional mannequin.\r<br />\r<br />SPOILERS ( Part I )\r<br />\r<br />Once you bought the dresses from Endarie, she forgets to lock the mannequin displays. This is your chance to take the collars.\r<br />At the same moment you take the collars from the statues you will notice the stone turns to flesh and the mannequins start to live again.\r<br />After you freed Leya and Yona (the former mannequins) you can persuade them to follow you. They are twins and one will follow another. So you actually get both of them to follow you.\r<br />\r<br />SPOILERS ( Part II )\r<br />\r<br />To get started talk to Endarie. She will tell you she didn&#39;t know the mannequins were real persons and that she bought them from a harmless looking Khajit named J&#39;zargo.\r<br />J&#39;zargo is a magic student at the Winterhold College. So travel to Winterhold, join the mage guild if you haven&#39;t and search for J&#39;zargo. He will deny everything but in his pockets you will find a suspicious note.\r<br />Then investigate the catacombs of Winterhold College and you should find another mannequin close to the Atronarch Forge. Looks like J&#39;zargo used the forge to summon the Cursed Mannequin Collars from the plane of Oblivion. You can do the same and summon more collars (up to 4 for a total of 7 collars). Just feed the forge with the ingredients listed on the note you got from J&#39;zargo.\r<br />\r<br />THE COLLARS\r<br />\r<br />The collars are enchanted with the Mannequin Curse. Probably a daedric curse that will turn anyone wearing the collars to stone immediately. The effect only ends if the collar is removed again.\r<br />You can either give them as present to your followers or sneak-place them on random people.\r<br />While a person is under the effect of the Mannequin Curse enchantment you can access the person&#39;s inventory and dress him or her any way you want.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALL / UNINSTALL\r<br />\r<br />Install like any other mod. (Extract files to data directory)\r<br />Uninstall should be safe and clean as long as you free all the mannequins before you deactivate the mod.\r<br />\r<br />HOW IT WORKS\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s not really just an echantment you can put on any armor piece. Behind the scenes there is a quest with a set of aliases, ai packages, markers, scripts and script props. That&#39;s the reason why there is only a limited number of collars at the moment. I plan to add more later though.\r<br />\r<br />PLANNED FEATURES\r<br />\r<br />Add more collars\r<br />Maybe add some more dialog/interaction options to the quest\r<br />\r<br />KNOWN ISSUES\r<br />\r<br />It is possible to &#39;stone&#39; people while they are sitting on a chair (or any other furniture). Doing this will cause the person to exit and reenter the furniture. It looks stupid I know but there is no function to get the current furniture object. So I have to make them get up and sit down again.\r<br />Also while sitting the actor&#39;s collision can bug out sometimes. Reloading the cell (exit+reenter) should fix this.",
