  "summary": "This mod makes the formerly useless merchant Brand-Shei sell valuable Dwarven loot, imported from Morrowind.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]In the vanilla game, Brand-Shei in Riften (Known to most of you as the guy from the first Thieves Guild quest) claims to be selling valuable imports from Morrowind, but when you look at his inventory, all he has is some incredibly underwhelming armors, an iron dagger or two, and perhaps a minor healing potion. This mod aims to fix that.\r<br />\r<br />Brand-Shei will now sell Dwarven items both imported from the island of Vvardenfell and purchased from adventurers in Skyrim. He will carry Dwarven armor, weapons, and various Dwemeri miscellaneous items, such as metal ingots and scrap metal. He will also carry a shiny new Dwarven sword on him at all times, which could be stolen from him for an edge at the beginning of the game.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=2]I hope you enjoy my mod, and let me know if there&#39;s anything that you would like to see added in the future&#33;[/size]",
