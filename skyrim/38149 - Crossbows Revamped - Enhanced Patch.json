  "descriptionHtml": "This mod creates the \\\"Enhanced\\\" Variant of all the crossbows included in \\\"Crossbows Revamped\\\" mod. That mod adds some great new crossbows, but because it lacked an \\\"enhanced version\\\" of them, they were never worth actually using (because the enhanced DLC ones were always more powerful).\r\n\r\nThis creates the needed enhanced version and drops them in to the leveled lists of weapons. Anywhere you could find a glass, elvish, etc. crossbow with the main mod, you may find an enhanced version, assuming that you have done the quests that unlock the default enhanced variants (Daedric and Dragonbone are unlocked with the Dwarven version, and the rest are unlocked with the Steel version). The levels are equal to those of their un-enhanced counterparts.\r\n\r\nNone of the actual files are included in this one. You MUST download the original file; this is merely an addon/patch for said mod.\r\n\r\nRequired:\r\nCrossbows Revamed - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21666/?\r\nAny files required by Crossbows Revamped",
