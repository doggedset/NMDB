  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'ve always been fascinated by the Argonath in LOTR so I wanted to make something ingame that reflected them, but fit into the Elder Scrolls world. So, here are \\'The Ysmir\\'. This is my first go with the construction set and isn\\'t a grand mod or anything but it does add something ot the landscape.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve also written a couple of books. One can be found in Riverwood at the blacksmiths on the table outside. That will tell you where to go. The other is a journal which can be found slightly hidden in a dead log on the outskits of Riverwood.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any suggestions, comments or would like to improve on the lore aspects of the books please just PM me and I\\'ll make the corrections. \r\n\r\n",
