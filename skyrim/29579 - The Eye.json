  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Introduction:[/b]\r\n[line]\r\nWelcome to Verasyer, a realm gripped in chaos.\r\n\r\nThe Eye adds the realm continent of Verasyer to Skyrim, a large landmass that I plan to be separate from Tamriel with fully functioning everything. This means towns, dungeons, quests, NPCs, and story. As this mod is very much on the drawing board, suggestions are welcome and anyone wishing to join the team is welcome to whether all you want to do is make one dungeon or stick with The Eye from start to finish.\r\n\r\n[b]Story (WiP):[/b]\r\n[line]\r\nFor years, the Salorian people lived in peace under their king. Upon his death, the Empire became embroiled in a shadowy civil war over the heirless throne. The remnants of the Empire sought to raise one of their own to secure the crown, while many others sought to elect a new King out of the people\\'s vote, deposing the current rulers of the land. Unable to come to an agreement, the two sides clashed violently in a bloody campaign\r\n\r\nThe remnants of the Empire pit their swords against the Rebellion to secure their grasp on the land. For a time, the Rebellion help their own, taking land day by day. However, they could not hope to fight the well trained soldiers of the Empire. Crushed by their enemy\\'s overwhelming might, the Rebellion was scattered, and a new King named.\r\n\r\nSeven years later, you arrive in Verasyer. Shadows shift in the darkest recesses of its lands, stimulated by your presence. With the fragile peace hanging by a thread, your actions will shape this new land\\'s future.
