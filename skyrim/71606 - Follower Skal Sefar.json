  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][b][u]SKAL SEFAR FOLLOWER\r<br />[/u][/b][/size][font=Comic Sans MS][size=3][i]This mod is a addition to the normal vanilla followers of TESV. Her name is Skal Sefar. Her AI is brave and she mostly seems puzzled, this relates to someone that I know in real... NOT MENTIONING ANY NAMES ;) May update her appearance soon look out for that&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[/i][/size][/font][u][font=Georgia][size=4][b]FILES\r<br />[/b][/size][/font][/u][i][font=Comic Sans MS][size=3]Skal Sefar is a .esp folder and it usually complies with most mods, if not notify me and I will have a look. It really shouldn&#39;t mess around as it has a vanilla build. It is completely lore friendly, keep playing how you want.\r<br />\r<br />Contributers: SkalDovah \r<br />\r<br />[/size][/font][b]\r<br />[/b][/i]",
