  "descriptionHtml": "DARKSIDERS 2 DEATH SCYTHE\r\n\r\nMy first mod for Skyrim.\r\nA simple weapon I made in 3DS Max more for training than modding and it appears good enough to me to give it a try as a mod.\r\nThis was done from a few images collected on the net before the game was out, some some people could find some differences with the game model.\r\nThis weapon is stand-alone and can be crafted and upgraded in any forge.\r\nThis is used as a battle axe but as some people prefer one handed weapons, I also shortened the models to make a war axe.\r\nPut the data folder in the archive in the Skyrim folder and that\\'s all.No download manager, sorry.\r\nDon\\'t forget to check the Esp in your mod list.\r\n\r\nThanks and I hope you\\'ll enjoy it\r\nAthenaX\r\n P.S. the Death reaper robes you can see on the last image is my next mod and is on the way.\r\n\r\n16 november 2012 Update:\r\nDarksiders 2 Death Scythe add-on\r\nNew Esp available.\r\nThis Esp is an add-on to my mod Darksiders 2 Death Scythe.\r\nyou can always forge the normal scythes but it adds 2 new ones with lowered stats for people who don\\'t want to play with too powerful weapons.\r\n\r\nIt modifies the stats of the Scythes weapons( both one-handed and two-handed), so they match the Daedric weapons stats.\r\nThe Daedric damage stats are 25 for the battleaxe(2-handed) and 15 for the waraxe( 1-handed), but these stats are specific to your levels and skills in game at the moment you forge them, so they can vary greatly.\r\nLet\\'s just say , in my game, for example, the short scythe has 60 in damage and the Death scythe has 120.\r\nIn Daedric crafting, at the forge, you got the usual Death scythe and Death short scythe plus the lowered one,Death scythe DS and Death short scythe DS.\r\nYou still need the main mod for this to work, so download it and once installed, just replace the Esp \\\"Darksiders 2 Death Scythe\\\" in your data folder by the one in the archive.\r\n\r\n3 october 2012 Update: \r\nThe textures have been redone in 2048*2048 px. Download the optional file and put the content of the archive in your data folder.",
