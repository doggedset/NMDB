  "summary": "Sasha is a level two Nord recreation of one of my toons that I though was worth sharing.  This is the exact same savegame as my Pamela post.  I just re-did the face.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Sasha is level two, mostly because I forgot to turn off master difficulty for much of the starting zone, but she has not started any quests except for talking to Gerdur, nor has the perk point been allocated.  I cleaned-out the starting area reasonably well so you’ll be short of nothing to get her going.  Just equip her as desired and sell-off the rest.\r\n\r\nI did a clean install just to make sure she’d work without a hitch, so as long as you have no conflicting mods, she should look exactly as pictured as of 3/8/2013.\r\n\r\nTo get here to look right please install the following mods – in order:\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6953  Better Face Gen\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9897  RANs Tweaked FaceMenu\r\n(I’m not sure it’s necessary but I did use it to adjust the eyes)\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7127  RANs HeadMesh Variants – B\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812  Better Females by Bella\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812  Better Females by Bella Makeup version one\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722  The Eyes of Beauty\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168  ApachiiSkyHair\r\n\r\nI was using http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666 Calientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition –CBBE, along with the CBBE Vanilla armor soldier pack when taking this picture.  Her weight can be easily adjusted using the CBBE body slide utility and/or Expired’s excellent http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29624 RaceMenu.  You may want to use http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20394 ShowRaceMenu Alternative in conjunction with Expired’s RaceMenu. \r\n\r\nI do recommend if you use SKSE that you create a new folder in your data folder  named SKSE, (Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/Data/SKSE), and create an SKSE.ini file using notepad with the following in your new folder:\r\n\r\n[Display]\r\niTintTextureResolution=2048\r\n",
