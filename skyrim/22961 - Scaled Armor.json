  "descriptionHtml": "Copy and paste the folders/files to your Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\n\r\nI did a couple of mods for Morrowing and Oblivion back in the day and thought I may as well contribute to the community. This is a fairly quick job so there are some minor issues (mentioned below under \\'note\\'). \r\n\r\nFurthermore, if anyone wants to use this mod in their projects or more importantly fix the Scaled Armor.esp file (issue below), feel free, but just mention/credit me for the re-texturing.  \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n\r\nIn the Construction Set, I didn\\'t have time to figure out how to set the nif/dds files for the Scaled Armor to be seperate from the pieces I borrowed the models from. Therefore the following is what occurs in the world with his mod: \r\n\r\n1) Bandits using the same model/texture files, will visually be wearing the same chestpiece as the Scaled Chestpiece. (Not a big deal as it looks ok for them to be wearing it, being pretty dirty looking)\r\n\r\n2) Companions wearing the Wolf Gloves and Boots, they will look like the Scaled Gloves and Boots. (Not a big deal as they go quite well with the Wolf Chestpiece)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThanks For Downloading.",
