  "descriptionHtml": "===========\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nNow Farkas can look like your typical generic JRPG hero. Yay. While you save Tamriel,\r\nHE\\'LL SAVE THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nBasically, I got bored and wanted to try this new NPC Editor gizmo out. Hearing Sven\\'s\r\nvoice in Japanese reminded me of a typical teenage-esque hero in one of dem Japanese\r\ngames, so I turned him into one. I thought I\\'d do one for Farkas, too, so here he is.\r\n\r\n============\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n1) ApachiiSkyHair for the hair:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\n\r\nNote: You don\\'t really need this next one. I just use it because it makes males look\r\nbetter. I used the Younger Faces & Geonox version in my screenshots.\r\n\r\n2) Better males - Beautiful nudes and faces - New hairstyles:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2488\r\n\r\n============\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nPut both the esp and the bsa in your \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data folder. Hopefully, it should work fine.\r\nIf not, tell me and I\\'ll try and fix it myself. This was a really quick job, so I expect\r\nan issue or two.\r\n\r\n====\r\nNote\r\n====\r\nFarkas might spawn with a hood for you. Well, he did for me at least. Just open console, \r\nselect him, and type \\\"openactorcontainer 1\\\", then remove the hood. First time uploading here,\r\nso if I do anything wrong, please say so.\r\n\r\n=======\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Apachii for the hairs, foretrenty for the npc editor, and Chris57 for the face textures. I don\\'t care what you do with this mod, but please respect the other guys.",
