Charge is 30 miles from Skyrim&#39;s coast and is accessible from any major dock, optionally there is a spell to teleport there. Complete a few quests and you will have the key to a mansion. Control the surrounding settlement and defend it from bandits.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Features[/b]:\r<br />\r<br />-2 companions (1 animal 1 human)\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Compatibility & Install\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/b]It isn&#39;t filled with dirty or wild edits so unless a terrain mod overwrites the port there shouldn&#39;t be any issues.
