  "descriptionHtml": "Version 0.1.0:\r<br />I realize that there are several bugs, and that not all the spells are extremely reliable, however, bear with me until the beginning of the week when I will have more time to work on it.\r<br />\r<br />Each spell has a Magicka cost of 10 for now, and can only be equipped in the left hand. This is due to a system that I am looking to implement in the future.\r<br />\r<br />You can get the spells by typing &#34;help SPELL_NAME 4&#34; into the cheat console ` and then finding the code for SPELL_NAME and typing &#34;player.addspell &lt;itemcode&gt;&#34;\r<br />NOTE: If the spell has 2 or more words, then use only one of them.\r<br />\r<br />For example, after opening the console, I want to add Avada Kedavra to my spell list. I would type in:\r<br />help avada 4\r<br />it would return a number along the lines of yy00XXXX. Where yy is the load order. You would then type in:\r<br />player.addspell yy00XXXX\r<br />It should tell you a message on the top left of your screen that the spell was added.\r<br />\r<br />Spell Name List:\r<br />Alohamora\r<br />Avada Kedavra\r<br />Expelliarmus\r<br />Stupefy\r<br />\r<br />A not so Future Future note:\r<br />I am adding more spells from Harry Potter in the now. Leave comments if you have any suggestions. I can only remember so many of them off the top of my head.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks\r<br />\r<br />PS:\r<br />Which Professor is your favorite from Harry Potter? Please post in the comments.",
