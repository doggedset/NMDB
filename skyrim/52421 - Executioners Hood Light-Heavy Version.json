  "descriptionHtml": "I took the Executioner Hood from the Dark Brotherhood quest and added a Heavy/Light version... I did not add them to any vendors or other locations. I only did it for my own character but its so totally cool I just could not resist sharing.\r<br />\r<br />EXECUTIONER MASK HEAVY // EXECUTIONER MASK\r<br />\r<br />Drop the console and type : player.additem 000d63 For the Heavy version\r<br />                                     player.additem 000d62 For the Light Version\r<br />\r<br />I gave the light studded helmet stats and the heavy steel helmet stats.\r<br />\r<br />Also in this save file there is a duplication I made for the Knights of the Nine Battlemage by Maty743 and SolarT .. What I did was add duplicates of his armor in the construction kit without the enchantments and with Light and Heavy versions... They are not in any vendors or locations\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />KNIGHTS OF THE NINE UNENCHANTED BATTLEMAGE ARMOR HEAVY/LIGHT\r<br />\r<br />type : HELP &#34;KOTN&#34; in the console : it will show you LightBattlemage&lt;piece&gt; HeavyBattlemage&lt;piece&gt;\r<br />\r<br />select which one you want, I only did it so I could customize my own character. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I am not privy to modding exactly I wouldn&#39;t say you needed the Knights of the Nine mod for this to work? I think it is just an off chute item? I did have Knights of the Nine active in editing... but since its console add only, I am sure it would not be an issue for anyone to have the files available, without the core file.\r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28494/? - KOTN mage armor",
