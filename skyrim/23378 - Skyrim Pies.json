  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very simple mod that just adds 20+ \r\ntypes of pies to Skyrim. I didn\\'t like the \r\nfact that there was only one type of pie. This\r\nMod also adds an NPC that has one of every\r\nkind of pie on him and fifteen of a special\r\npie. I have also added a unique pie that has\r\nreally good effects on it that is placed on\r\na stone throne in a random place in a random\r\nwilderness map. I don\\'t even know where it is\r\nbut it is close to a path behind a rock. The\r\nnew pies should also be added to merchants\r\nbut I\\'m not quite sure if I did it right concidering\r\nthis is my first mod.",
