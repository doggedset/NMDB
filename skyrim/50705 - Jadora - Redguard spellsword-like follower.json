  "descriptionHtml": "Redguard spellsword-like follower, powerful and versatile. Well perked, has lots of spells (including DLC spells), essential and autolevel (10-100), UFO compatible and you can marry her too. Eager for adventuring she can be found at Drunken Huntsman. \r<br />\r<br />She dual wields spells, conjures minions, raises the dead and packs a punch with a sword, perked for light armor. She will use DLC spells like Conjure Mistman, Wrathman, Ash Spawn etc. I recommend using UFO with her and giving her Fortify Magicka equipment to make her even more powerful. She prefers using spells but will also use swords and bows. She will make for a strong companion for any type of character. If dismissed she will return to the Drunken Huntsman.\r<br />\r<br />She wears the Skaal equipment because it is cold in Skyrim for a Redguard like her :)\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim 1.9\r<br />Dawnguard\r<br />Dragonborn\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Unpack the archive to Skyrim/Data.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />\r<br />Delete Jadora.esp and associated files.",
