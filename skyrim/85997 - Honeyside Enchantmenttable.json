  "descriptionHtml": "Why the heck would you have to decide wether to have children at Honeyside OR an enchantment table? I mean vanilla Skyrim remove it when you chose to built a childs room.\r<br />Well i bring it back. There is an additional enchantment table below the stairs, which will not disappear when changing the roo to a childs room. Netxt to it a dresser wit a small chest on it to store your soul gems and / or your other stuff for enchanting.\r<br />\r<br />Just a little lore friendly mod that should neither contain any bugs nor cause compatibility issues, however there might be some when using complete overhaul mods for honeyside or its cellar.\r<br />\r<br />If you find something let me know ... oh and have fun enchanting :)Â ",
