Instead of the barely noticeable 20pt increase, I&#39;ve bumped it up to 100pt and added a special bonus on top of that for silver weapons in the Immersive Weapons mod. Now silver is comparable to higher level enchantments and makes using silver against undead a must. This goes well with mods that delevel the game making undead almost impossible to beat at low levels. If you can find a silver blade then you can even take on Master Vampires with much less trouble.\r<br />\r<br />The way I came to see a need for this was watching vampire/werewolf movies and seeing how a tiny bit of silver could cripple or even kill. This made the mostly unnoticeable boost in the vanilla game seem pointless in comparison, and also a bit weak compared to past TES games. \r<br />\r<br />So grab that silver blade and go kill some undead.\r<br />\r<br />Now I just need to figure out how to make silver arrows/bolts...
