  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://www.mgenyc.com/modsSkyrim/IMAGINATOR-Nexusexclusive.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]NEW IN V2:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />DEAPRI was kind enough to merge VIVANTO&#39;S IMAGINATOR MCM into the base file&#33;\r<br />The HELPER - often maligned as the source of dreaded Save Game Bloat - has been removed. \r<br />\r<br />Please note that this is an interim solution - hence calling it BETA.  I&#39;m hoping to find time to add more functionality as well as hot-keys (for better color correction that available via MCM).\r<br />\r<br />MCM = Mod Configuration Menu and is available as part of SKYUI.  As such, SKYUI and SKSE are required.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]UPDATING :[/size]\r<br />\r<br />It is best if you clean your SAVE from the old IMAGINATOR SCRIPTS before installing V2.  It&#39;ll cut down on potential problems.  Instructions on cleaning saves are here:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://warzones.skyrim.modunion.com/installation-checklist-cleaning-your-save/]INSTALLATION : Gearing Up for Warzones 2015[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Yes, I know that&#39;s a WARZONES 2015 instruction page, but until I have time to set up an IMAGINATOR page, it&#39;ll have to do ;)  Scroll down to the PREPARING YOUR SAVE and follow the directions.  Once the old Helper Script is gone from your game, you&#39;ll be good to go.\r<br />\r<br />Do jot down your current settings in case they don&#39;t translate properly.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.mgenyc.com/modsSkyrim/IMAGINATOR---splash01.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.mgenyc.com/mods/IMAGINATOR---WhatIs.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />IMAGINATOR is a stand-alone, in-game, image modification tool.\r<br />\r<br />It allows you to separately control visual elements like Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Sky Brightness, Sunlight Output, Bloom and Tint all from within an easy-to-navigate MCM.  Never before have you had such power&#33;  Seriously.\r<br />\r<br />In the below videos, you will see the now defunct HELPER being used.  In the latest version, these options are available via the MCM.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]VWHkC0MCjTU&feature=youtu.be[/youtube]\r<br />[youtube]iRrCZGIuPRM&feature=youtu.be[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.mgenyc.com/mods/IMAGINATOR---WhatDoes.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />You have 4 TOOLS in the IMAGINATOR MENU:\r<br />\r<br />[b]CONTRASTOR :[/b] Provided within are incremental adjustments to BRIGHTNESS, CONTRAST and SATURATION.  Consider this the &#39;fine-tuning&#39; station where you can adjust our presets - or ANY weather mod - to suit your taste. \r<br />\r<br />[b]TINTOR :[/b] Adds a schmorgasboard of color options by allowing you complete control over the addition of RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, ORANGE, MAGENTA and CYAN&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[b]CINEMAGIC:[/b] Play &#39;god&#39; with complete control over the brightness of the SKY, the power of SUNLIGHT (and Moonlight) and the overall image BLOOM&#33;  \r<br />\r<br />[b]PRESET COLOR SCHEMES :[/b] 9 preset complex color palettes to enhance the mood (more to come&#33;).  The PRESETS are stackable and combinable for infinite combinations.  We&#39;ve provided a nice range of presets for you to choose from.  Use them &#39;as is&#39; or enhance and adjust them using CONTRASTOR, TINTOR and/or CINEMAGIC&#33;\r<br />\r<br />All options are STACKABLE.  Click once for a minor adjustment, click again for more, and again for even more&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Mix, match and enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />You may DISABLE ALL of the effects from the main menu, or you may disable the effects from each tool separately. \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.mgenyc.com/mods/IMAGINATOR-CombineEffects.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Yep.\r<br />\r<br />Effects from each IMAGINATOR MENU can be COMBINED with effects from each of the others allowing you unparalleled in-game control of your image.  Use one or use them all.\r<br />\r<br />Is it too bright?  Darken it.  \r<br />Too much contrast?  Turn it down.\r<br />Not enough color?  Add some saturation.\r<br />Is our preset awesome, but just too colorful?  That&#39;s a baseline for you to work with&#33;  Decrease that saturation&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m no math-wiz, but that&#39;s almost an infinite amount of possibilities all from a convenient MCM.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.mgenyc.com/mods/IMAGINATOR-HistoryLesson.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />IMAGINATOR began it&#39;s life as ELECTRO-CITY : EMITTANCE over in FALLOUT NEW VEGAS.  Then it grew up into ELECTRO-CITY : IMAGINATOR.  It was originally intended to offer brighter lights as a compliment to the add&#39;l lighting in ELECTRO-CITY, but it took on a life of its own.  Interestingly, SKYRIM&#39;s game engine does not allow the same overall adjustment of lights, which is a tad annoying actually... hah\r<br />\r<br />IMAGINATOR is an in-game overlay and should be compatible with most other mods because it doesn&#39;t change or rely on anything from any other mod.\r<br />\r<br />The reason to make it was simple:  Everyone&#39;s got different tastes, different mods, different monitors, different gamma settings, so on and so forth...\r<br />\r<br />IMAGINATOR, right now, offers the player a remarkable amount of in-game image control&#33;  We&#39;re very excited about IMAGINATOR and we hope you enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />- MyGoodEye & Gopher\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.mgenyc.com/mods/IMAGINATOR-Compatible.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Okay, here&#39;s the deal with IMAGINATOR:\r<br />\r<br />Please pay attention ;)\r<br />\r<br />IMAGINATOR will work with nearly ANY mod and requires only SKSE and SKYUI.\r<br />\r<br />IMAGINATOR will work with ENB so long as the ENB supports IMODS.  However, there are far too many &#34;variations&#34; of ENB for us to test. \r<br />\r<br />IMAGINATOR will also work with FXAA enabled.  It will likely work with injectors, but again, too many to test.\r<br />\r<br />IMAGINATOR will work wonderfully with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7654]Realistic Lighting[/url]... and you are encouraged to try them together.\r<br />\r<br />IMAGINATOR uses IN-GAME imagespace adjustments and, as such, will require very little of your computer.  IMAGINATOR is very frame-rate friendly&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Although IMAGINATOR is a generally no-trouble mod, REMEMBER TO SAVE OFTEN and keep a good save from before activating any mod&#33;  \r<br />\r<br />If you happen upon any incompatible mods, please let us know in the comments section and we&#39;ll see what&#39;s what.  One thing to do before reporting an incompatibility would be to reverse the possible conflicting mods in the load-order.  If you find that works, also please let us know so we can advise others.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.mgenyc.com/mods/IMAGINATOR-TooManyOptions.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Nonsense&#33;  But be warned:\r<br />  \r<br />IMAGINATOR offers you so many options that you may find yourself staring at the clouds for a little bit too long.  Ha&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Each weather mod interacts with these settings differently, so choose your poison as you will&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.mgenyc.com/mods/IMAGINATOR-wheredoistart.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s what I recommend.  \r<br />\r<br />Choose your PRESET setting first(if you&#39;d like).  PRESETS offer the greatest &#39;complexity&#39; of color in that we am able to control shadow tints and highlight tints.  If you want a PRESET a little stronger, click it again.\r<br />\r<br />Then noodle at will with the CONTRASTOR to get it &#39;just-so&#39;. \r<br />\r<br />If you want a little extra color, go to TINTOR.\r<br />\r<br />And if you want to see what neato stuff can happen with SKY and SUNLIGHT, experiment with CINEMAGIC to cap off your custom look.\r<br />\r<br />You don&#39;t HAVE to do it that way, but if you needed some advice, there you go.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.mgenyc.com/mods/IMAGINATOR-Feedback.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />What we&#39;d LOVE to hear about is how these settings &#39;feel&#39; to y&#39;all and I&#39;d be happy to take an informal poll on which settings you&#39;ve chosen.\r<br />\r<br />Upload your screenshots and tell us what combinations you used&#33;    \r<br />\r<br />That said, when requesting/discussing IMAGINATOR, please remember that when active, it is an ALWAYS ON effect.  As of now, I have no way of having it react to weather cycles or interior/exterior placement and I strongly doubt that I ever will.  \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://www.mgenyc.com/mods/IMAGINATOR-LoadOrder.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />In theory, IMAGINATOR can go anywhere.  In practice, I put it after everything else.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATING from previous versions: Remember, it is ALWAYS best to update using a clean save.  A clean save is either a save from prior to your first use of the mod OR a save in which you have removed the mod and it&#39;s scripts.  Best practice for most mods in my opinion.\r<br />\r<br />--------------------\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />--------------------\r<br />\r<br />[b]ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS V2[/b]\r<br />\r<br />HORIZONCLEAN (otherwise known as Static DOF) : Will be implemented, most likely, in our DYNAVISION mod (where it belongs and in order to prevent the two from fighting.)\r<br />\r<br />SCREEN BLUR : Does anyone WANT overall screen blur? It was cool for making film looks (and for &#34;faking Anti-Aliasing&#34;) in FNV, but if nobody wants it, I&#39;ll leave it off. Anyone? \r<br />\r<br />SHARPEN : Never going to happen. IMAGINATOR uses ONLY the options given to us in-game... this is how it can run with nearly no performance drop. SHARPEN is not available in-game (however, it is available at no performance cost via your graphics card controller and/or your monitors). \r<br />\r<br />SLIDERS : Also not going to happen anytime soon. It&#39;s not programmable in that manner at this time. \r<br />\r<br />SAVING CONFIGURATIONS : This is likely to happen in the future, however it will require deeper programming and, possibly, functions added by SKSE.\r<br />\r<br />BUT WAIT, WHAT IF I TURN OFF MY GAME?  DO I LOSE THE SETTINGS? : No, the IMAGINATOR SETTINGS are saved with your game.  When you start a NEW game you will have to re-enter them, but your current game will maintain your IMAGINATOR settings until you RESET them.\r<br />\r<br />APPLICATION TO SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE GAME ONLY : Sorry, but that&#39;s not in this mod&#39;s &#34;mission statement&#34;.  Hahah... that&#39;s best served by weather/lighting mods.\r<br />\r<br />------------\r<br />\r<br />Also, it wouldn&#39;t bother me at all if you checked out our other mods:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12525][img]http://www.mgenyc.com/modsSkyrim/DynavisionSkyrim_splash01.png[/img]\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9494/?][img]http://www.mygoodeyenyc.com/modImages/skyrim_Warzones/WARZONES---Small-Ads_950.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17605][img]http://www.mgenyc.com/modsSkyrim/ClaraLux-signature800.png[/img][/url]\r<br />Basically ELECTRO-CITY for SKYRIM.\r<br />Adds a ton of lights to WALLED CITIES, FORTS, SHRINES, ROADS, PATHS and FIXES some VANILLA &#34;oversights&#34;.\r<br />Totally compatible with URWL, REALISTIC LIGHTING, ENB Configurations, IMAGINATOR, & DYNAVISION&#33;\r<br />And completely user configurable.\r<br />Neato&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Any REQUESTS?  Leave &#39;em in COMMENTS&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;",
