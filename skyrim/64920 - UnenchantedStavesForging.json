  "descriptionHtml": "Mod designated mainly for people using custom homes with staff enchanter who don&#39;t want to be dependent on trading with Neloth.\r<br />\r<br /> I have found similar mods existing, but these are utilising staff enchanter itself to create unenchanted staff, which by my opinion don&#39;t make much sense. Not only using &#34;enchanter&#34; to create something &#34;unenchanted&#34; sounds stupid, but also creating process seems to be unnecessarily two-step.\r<br />\r<br />The staves are created with materials resembling the staves graphics as much as possible while trying to be fair at the same time. Receipes works as following:\r<br />\r<br />Unenchanted alteration staff: 2 orichalcum ignots + 1 flawless garnet, master alteration required\r<br />Unenchanted conjuration staff: 2 ebony ignots + 1 flawless amethyst, master conjuration required\r<br />Unenchanted destruction staff: 2 malachite ignots + 1 flawless emerald, master destruction required\r<br />Unenchanted illusion staff: 2 corundum ignots + 1 flawless saphire, master illusion required\r<br />Unenchanted restoration staff: 2 diamond ignots + 1 flawless moonstone, master restoration required\r<br />Heart Stone: 2 quicksilver ignots + 1 flawless ruby, extra effect required\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />unpack the file, copy it to the Skyrim data folder and allow it in your skyrim launcher or mod manager\r<br />\r<br />Dragonborn DLC is required",
