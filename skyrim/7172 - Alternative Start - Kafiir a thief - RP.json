  "descriptionHtml": "Born in the city of Dune, Elswyer, Ka\\'fiir was quickly orphaned when his parents died on one of their trips on trading caravans.  Seeing no other way to support himself, he turned to crime.  He was doing well until he finally got caught.  Ka\\'fiir made it away but decided it would be too dangerous to return to Elsweyr.  Deciding backup would be nice he traveled to Riften to join up with the thieves guild.  After a while of living there a dragon was spoted flying over head towards the north west.  The jarl put out a well payed job to take a message to Whiterun about the dragon.  Ka\\'fiir took the job and is just starting his journey to Whiterun when you, the player, take over.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative start save.  His skills are:\r\nAll magic skills at 0 because Khajiits are known poor magic users\r\nLockpicking, Pickpocketing, and Speech are at 30 since these are traits all good thieves need\r\nAlchemy is at 20 because of the occasional brewing of a skill enhancing potion\r\nSneak is at 40 since above all other skills this is the one thieves need most\r\nBlock and One Handed are at 10 for the off hand chance that he will need to defend himself\r\nLight Armor is at 30 for the occasional tussle\r\nArchery is at 20 just incase he needs to take out a few bandits during tomb looting\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nAOF Believable Hair-Female and Male- (I used this to boost the hair quality in the screenshot)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4307\r\n\r\nXCE - Xenius Character Enhancement (I used this to boost the characters looks in the screenshot)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356\r\n\r\nRecommendations: (I, of course, recommend the mods I used above along with these)\r\nWeapons of the Third Era\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3871\r\n\r\nA Quality World Map - With Roads\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4929\r\n\r\nCompelling Treasure Maps\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6907\r\n\r\nDeadly Dragons\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3829\r\n\r\nDFB Companion Bow Visible\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6520\r\n\r\nDovahkiin Hideout\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6032\r\n\r\nFirewood For Sale\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5653\r\n\r\nI Put A Spell On You - More Enchanting Options \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3313\r\n\r\nJaySuS Swords \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1002\r\n\r\nLord Armor\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5853\r\n\r\nMidas Magic - Spells in Skyrim\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3413\r\n\r\nNPC Bartering\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6802\r\n\r\nPhenderix Magic Evolved - 144 New Spells\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5898\r\n\r\nPricier and Heavier Pelts and Hides \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7039\r\n\r\nQuick Tomb Looting\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6591\r\n\r\nSkyrim Performance PLUS\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6387\r\n\r\nSkyrim Nordplate Enhanced\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6804\r\n\r\nWars in Skyrim IV - Dark Rainbow is back-\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6176\r\n\r\nWitchers Blades\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6253\r\n\r\nVarious Guards Outfit for Every City TS Edition http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6770\r\n\r\nBugs/Issues\r\nIf there are any problems feel free to voice them in the comments section which I will try to check back often",
