  "descriptionHtml": "Shazra is my Lvl 42 Orcish female warrior. She\\'s specialized in Dual Swords, Heavy Armor, Archery, Smithing and a few Sneaking, Enchanting and Lockpicking. Upload made by request ;) She comes fully equipped if you get (or already have) the item mods listed below.\r\n\r\n[color=lightgreen][b]MOD NEEDED[/color][/b] or she will be bald!\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii SkyHair[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n [color=lightgreen][b]ESSENTIAL MODS[/color][/b] used in this save. Not required, but strongly recommended.\r\n\r\n[color=lightgreen][b]Appearance:[/color][/b]\r\n\r\nBody: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14899]UNPB-BBP[/url]. you can also get UNPB without BBP (same link). They both require [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]Dimonized UNP[/url] first. UNP only is fine too.\r\n\r\nFace: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812]Better Females by Bella[/url] - less makeup version.\r\n\r\nIdle (fix): [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25495/]Orc female idle FIX[/url]\r\n\r\nSkin texture: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24318]Barbarian and Milkdrinker Skin UNP and UNPB[/url] - Barbarian, of course! Install manually and don\\'t pick the face files if you want to keep Bella\\'s Better Females - or re-install Bella\\'s mod after that. Anyway, NO NECK SEAM ;)\r\nNOTE: the screenshots shown here were taken before I had this mod. Now she looks way better and a lot more fierce! Badass.\r\n\r\n[color=lightgreen][b]Items:[/color][/b]\r\n\r\nWeapons: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25361]Orcish Sabre[/url] (unenchanted because I use Elemental Fury with her) and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23542]Unique Poisoned Weapons[/url] (Dark Venom Bow)\r\n\t\r\nArmor: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19004]Theminblacks UNPB Armor Shop[/url] - Orcish battle pickup armor.\r\nShe has an armored circlet instead of an orcish helm (same stats, not a replacer): [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4014]Craftable Helmet to Circlet[/url] - old mod but IMO the best in his category.\r\n\r\nMagic items: my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22587]Arcana collection[/url] (Ring of the Warrior + Ring of the Barbarian for her follower)\r\n\r\nJewelry: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11130]HN66s Earrings[/url]. Already enchanted!\r\n\r\nI also got her the armored Necklace from the Sovngarde Steel Armor. That would be a bonus.\r\n\r\n[color=lightgreen][b]IMPORTANT:[/color][/b] I\\'ve unequipped all her stuff to avoid power & enchanting issues, so she\\'ll be naked or in underwears, standing in front of Jorrvaskr. Just re-equip her in the Inventory. Note that if you don\\'t  want these mods, she\\'ll have no armor and weapons. Don\\'t worry, she\\'s become quite rich so you can buy everything you need from Eorlund, Belethor and others. The armor is already enchanted. I changed the names, so they may be in French, sorry about that. Just sell it and reforge her Orcish battle pickup armor.\r\n\r\n[color=lightgreen][b]HOUSES:[/color][/b]\r\n\r\nShe has some stuff in [b]Breezehome[/b], including Dragonpriest Masks already collected and a few treasures and loots. She also has the [b]Lake Manor (Heartfire DLC)[/b] where I think I\\'ve stored [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25220]Volendrung[/url] (modded by me) and a lot of armors and weapons. I had some House mods (Dark Tower, Grommash, Everspring Grotto) but they\\'re not essential at all.\r\n\r\n[color=lightgreen][b]QUESTS:[/color][/b]\r\n\r\n- MAIN QUEST not done! She only met the Greybeards but didn\\'t get the Horn yet.\r\n- COMPANION QUEST done. She\\'s a Werewolf right now. I used [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5773]LFox Werewolf Improvements[/url] mod. That could cause some trouble. Let me know. If there are problems, I\\'ll re-upload a Save but with Lycanthropy cured. You can also \\\"cure lycanthropy\\\" by using Console Commands, or go back to Ysgramor\\'s Tomb by yourself. That should fix it.\r\n- SIDE QUESTS: at lvl 42 she already rampaged through Falkreath, Whiterun and a bit of the Rift (not Riften thou) and Markarth, including Cidhna mines - where she killed everybody as a Werewolf ^;-;^ Open the her Quest log to know more.\r\n- FOLLOWER: she\\'s currently hanging out with Erik the Slayer (Rorikburg merc), fully equipped with a Scale Armor and a Nord Hero greatsword, straight from the Skyforge! I modded his Horned scale armor to be temperable. I hope this won\\'t cause any issues.\r\n\r\nThat\\'s it... I must have forgottten something. Let me know in Comments. Since I used tons of item & house mods, ignore the Warning when you load the Save - click \\\"Yes\\\". ENJOY!",
