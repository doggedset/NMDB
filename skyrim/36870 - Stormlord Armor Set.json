  "summary": "Battlemage armor remeshed and retextured from vanilla. Includes armor, sword, two custom spells, a secret room in Breezehome, and a backstory.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Discover the story of one of Skyrim\\'s Nearly forgotten heroes. Venture to Breezehome and locate the trap door to the cache of a Battlemage from times past. Includes complete armor retexture, sword, two spells, and back story. Armor can be tempered and is pre-enchanted. You\\'ll find an enchanted ring as well as a book that tells the story of the original owner.\r\n\r\nInstallation: Merge the \\\"Data\\\" folder from the download with your own. NOT a replacer.\r\n\r\nNote: This is only available for males. I may do a female version in the future if it is successful.\r\n\r\nInside the hidden room you\\'ll find the armor set up on a mannequin and the sword on a wall plaque. \r\n\r\n*Spoilers*\r\n\r\nArmor Enchantments:\r\nHood: Fortify Magicka 100 points. Destruction Spells cost 25% less to cast.\r\nArmor: Resist Shock Damage 25%. Destruction Spells cost 25% less to cast.\r\nGauntlets: Resist Shock Damage 25%. Increase One-Handed Damage by 50%.\r\nBoots: Resist Shock Damage 25%. Increase Carry Weight by 100 Points.\r\nRing: Shouts cool down 50% faster. Activates Lightning Cloak while wearing (Purely Aesthetic)\r\nThe Spells:\r\nArc Blast: A single bolt with a massive impact. Sends enemies flying.\r\nOvercharge: Large devastating stream of lightning.  Causes great damage over time. Disintegrates enemies.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n1. I fixed the file path. I forgot a folder the first time. I sincerely apologize for that. Should work flawlessly now.\r\n2. Moved the entrance to a spot right behind Breezehome as I don\\'t want it to interfere with any of your existing Breezehome mods.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2\r\n1. Major changes to textures for a more subtle and natural look.\r\n2. Remeshed the armor for a more unique appearance.\r\n3. Created a .BSA as the files were beginning to stack up.",
