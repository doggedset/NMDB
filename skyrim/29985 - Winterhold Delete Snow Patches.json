  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r\nIt disables the ugly snow patches in the Winterhold College area.  I finally got tired of seeing the snow patches near Winterhold so I made this mod that disables them so they dont show up anymore, especially after trying other snow textures/mods and they were still there.  The snow patches are only disabled so there should not be any issues with any other mods trying to reference them.  \r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\nShould be compatible with everything, didnt change or move anything just disable so they dont show up.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\nDownload with manager or manually put esp in skyrim data folder and activate.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\nNone so far, let me know if there are any.\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\nAnyone can use this file however they want, just give credit, no permission needed.
