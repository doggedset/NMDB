  "summary": "Changes Shadowmere to a black horse with fiery-styled hooves. Replaces Whiterun horses as well.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Something I whipped up a few weeks ago since I was unsatisfied with the way Shadowmere looked. The aim being to make Shadowmere look more like a traditional Nightmare horse, as seen [url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG195.jpg][HERE][/url].\r\n\r\nMy hope is that when the Creation Kit comes out, someone with more sense than me will be able to take this and apply flame effects to the mane, tail and hooves in order to complete the presentation.\r\n\r\nAs a minor side-note; I\\'m aware that this is probably pretty low-grade work, so if anyone feels the need to improve on stuff like adding bumpmaps, or just generally increasing the quality of the textures, feel free to do so.",
