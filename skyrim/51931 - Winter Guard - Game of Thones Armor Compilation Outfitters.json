  "descriptionHtml": "[i]&#34;You&#39;re lookin&#39; at a real warrior&#33; At least I used to be. Why I&#39;m so old I can&#39;t remember who I was fighting half the time. But I remember killing more than half of them.&#34;[/i] [see image #2 for converse immersion] Said Vignar, the Many Age-ed, to you, whoever you are. [i]&#34;Say who are you anyway?&#33; Are you some sort of trouble maker or are you trying to be a Companion? If you joined in the last decade or so I would not know you, on account of my being too old to care&#33;&#34;\r<br />\r<br />&#34;War interfears (that&#39;s right, inter-fears I said) with many things and changes things too, mind you. The years long conflict in Skyrim has seen thousands of changes. Why this war seems like it just keeps restarting over and over. But all wars are the same really, kill or be killed. I&#39;m still here so I must not have been killed, and I don&#39;t plan to be either. &#39;Specially not by the likes of you&#33; ... Anyhow, I was sayin&#39; that I&#39;ve seen many changes during war and did not much care for any of &#39;em really. Now I got me a shiny new robe and folks in Whiterun keep saying, &#34;Finally, Winter is Here,&#34; whatever in Oblivian that means. Sounds like Brill&#39;s been in the Skooma again if you ask me&#33; Only a matter of time before he drinks himself to death ... I&#39;m done talkin&#39;&#33;&#34;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=gold][font=&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;]WINTER   GUARD   -   GAME   OF   THRONES   ARMOR   COMPILATION   OUTFITTERS   .  ESP[/font][/color][/heading]\r<br />A simple plug-in mod (available in different versions of intensity of distribution & separate optional plug-ins) that utilizes the work of several people ([font=&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;][color=gold]CREDITS[/font][/color] below) to clothe some of the prominent nobles & fighters of Skyrim.\r<br />-Highly modular as only Creation Kit edits used. These can be changed to your liking or removed to restore vanilla outfits & armors without adding/removing folders (delete unwanted changes with TESVEdit to avoid dirty edits).\r<br />-**See [font=&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;]Versions Annotation[/font] section below for more details of changes before you decide which one to install. Versions move from minor changes to nobles in low numbers to guard hold overhauls in high numbers; some separate plug-ins as well.**\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Main Files, use only ONE from this list at a time:[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[b]01-WinterGuard-GOTACO:[/b] outfits Civil War Commanders & many Skyrim Nobles.\r<br />[b]03-WinterGuard-GOTACO: 01[/b] plus outfits other Nobles & a few Mercenaries (Companions & Hirelings).\r<br />\r<br />[b]11-WinterGuard-GOTACO: 03[/b] plus Imperial Soldier to Lannister replacers.\r<br />[b]13-WinterGuard-GOTACO: 03[/b] plus Stormcloak to Stark & Whiterun to Storm&#39;s End replacers.\r<br />[b]15-WinterGuard-GOTACO: 11[/b] plus [b]13[/b].\r<br />\r<br />[b]21-WinterGuard-GOTACO: 15[/b] plus Hold Guards overhaul; New Guard Armors increased stats & craftable. Also includes additions from Optional [b]18fh[/b] plugin.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Separate Files, Main File NOT required (compatible with main file of Lower number only; options included in higher number main files):[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[b]18fh-WinterGuard-GOTACO:[/b] equips Housecarls Irileth & Faleen in Lannister Armor.\r<br />[b]18fr-WinterGuard-GOTACO:[/b] equips Housecarls Irileth & Faleen in Lannister Armor & Legate Rikke in Flowers Armor. \r<br />\r<br />[b]29bt-WinterGuard-GOTACO:[/b] equips Tullius in Stannis Armor & Ulfric in Brienne of Tarth Armor.\r<br />[b]29cm-WinterGuard-GOTACO:[/b] equips Tullius in Stannis Armor & Ulfric in Clegane the Mountain Armor.\r<br />[b]29rs-WinterGuard-GOTACO:[/b] equips Tullius in Stannis Armor & Ulfric in Robb Stark Armor.\r<br />\r<br />-No consideration was given to Westeros & it&#39;s characters. I simply made outfit choices esthetic to Skyrim. But there are inevitable similarities between the worlds & outfits of Skyrim & Westeros. There are other mods that change the Civil War armies & hold guards in more complex & thorough ways, this one is only about giving a fresh look to some of the NPCs & armies of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />**Note my screenshots are low resolution giving poor representation to these quality armors that look much better in game. However, see my images for several examples of NPCs in the Armors. I am NOT the creator or editor of these or any armors. I do not even possess the necessary programs so I take no credit for these armors & suffer no request to tailor armors. I merely outfitted them.**\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=silver][font=&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;]REQUIREMENTS:[/font][/color][/heading]\r<br />-Skyrim Updated & working properly (requires no DLC/expansions).\r<br />-[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27301/?]Game of Thrones Armor Compilation[/url] or [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48107/?]Game of Thrones Armor Compilation - Fix[/url] installed & activated in launcher (Master File).\r<br />-the Fix is [b][u]NOT[/b][/u] required but fixes a couple of render issues with the Tarth Armor belt, Tarth boots, & the Mountain boots; you will also have two craftable versions of the Vale Knight Helm if you use the Fix with my [b]03[/b] or above main plugin.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=green][font=&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;]INSTALLATION:[/font][/color][/heading]\r<br />Advised to try out versions with a single Save Game that allows you to travel around to the Holds to view changes. If you play with one version enabled & save your game, then switch to another version, some NPC nakedness may occur. \r<br />\r<br />1) Download main plug-in of your choice & any optional plug-ins wanted.\r<br />2) Extract/Drop/Copy [b]&#34;##-WinterGuard-GOTACO.esp&#34;[/b] to your .../Skyrim/Data folder.\r<br />3) Enable in your launcher or mod manager program.\r<br />4) Test in game & play.\r<br />... or download & activate with mod manager of course.\r<br />-Place fairly low in your Load Order. If you do not see changes in game, place it lower. Load Order preference typically goes to the last in load order, so conflicting mods, like Tullius & Ulfric outfit changers, preference to last.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=darkred][font=&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;]Known  Conflicts:[/font][/color][/heading]\r<br />-TCOSS (Real Swords - The Chronicals of Steel) distribution works but needs to be placed higher in Load Order or it seems to cancel out GOT Armor changes.\r<br />-SkyRe plugins, same as TCOSS.\r<br />-Other Civil War/Guard & Soldier outfitter mods will likely conflict with the replacer plug-ins of course.\r<br />-**I will not upload this mod to the abominable Steam so do not bother asking--Nor should you upload it there either as I will have it removed**\r<br />\r<br />[i]&#34;Look at you. I bet you think you&#39;re something don&#39;t Ya. Dragonborn, huh. Dragonboob, or dragon food is more like it&#33; I bet you get eaten before the frost thaws off my backside, you and your shiny new armor.&#34;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />(NOTE: All [i]&#34;quotes&#34;[/i] are from the wise speak of Vignar Gray-Mane & his comments are unaffiliated with this mod & its author)\r<br />\r<br />[i]&#34;Well, I&#39;m the only one talkin&#39; ain&#39;t I ?&#33;&#34;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][font=&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;]VERSIONS  ANNOTATION:[/font][/heading]\r<br />[u]ONLY INSTALL ONE of the main plug-ins&#33; Just ONE. Plus [b]18xx[/b] if you want the two/three female NPC outfits AND your main plugin is of lower number; plus one [b]29xx[/b] if you fancy Tullis and/or Ulfric outfits.[/u]\r<br />-The main versions build upon one another ([b]13[/b] is exception--changes Storkcloaks, Whiterun Guard; NO change to Imperials). Everything included in version [b]01[/b] is in versions [b]03, 11,[/b] etc. Everything in [b]03[/b] is included in the replacement versions of higher number.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=lightblue][font=&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;]::OUTFIT ONLY ARMOR VERSIONS[/font] (no replacers, just NPC outfits changed in versions [b]01-03[/b])::[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]01: Non-Replacer Light: Civil War Command & Noble Lords - throw wave after wave of men at the enemy:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />-Imperial Legates (minus Rikke) & Generals equip Knight of the Flowers Armor.\r<br />-Sons of Skyrim Commanders equip Robb Stark Armor.\r<br />-Galmar equips Hound Armor & Ice GreatSword.\r<br />-Whiterun Jarl Balgruuf equips Gold Cloak Armor & SkyForged Steel BroadSword (*circlets drawn randomly from list for some Jarl NPCs so color worn will vary--necessary to get NPCs to equip circlets at all).\r<br />-Whiterun Housecarl Hrongar & Captain Caius equip Storm&#39;s End Armors; Hrongar equips Gregor&#39;s GreatSword.\r<br />-Further adds GoT Armors to several initial & would be Jarls, Stewards, Housecarls, & Court Thanes (including Vignar the Greatly Age-ed & his now sober companion Brill&#33;).\r<br />-Solitude Captain Aldis equips Lannister Elite Armor & Northern GreatSword.\r<br />-*See screen shots & explore in game to find them. Some court NPCs are left in vanilla outfits as well. This unintentionally gives each hold a diverse look.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]03: Non-Replacer Full: Mercenaries - real heroes fight for gold:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[u]-Includes everything in [b]01: Light[/b] version plus:[/u]\r<br />-Further gives the two pompus Solitude Thanes Eriku & Bryling (f) Lannister Armors.\r<br />-Sorli the Builder (f) wears Arya Jerkin & Voldsea Giryon (f) wears Iron Islands Armor. \r<br />-The four male fighter & spell sword Hirelings equip good & class beneficial armors (now buying Erik the Slayer light armor he can use more effectively). *Likely conflicts with male follower make-over mods so be advised.*\r<br />-Companions Farkas (Farkas&#33;), Athis, & Torvar equip new armors.\r<br />-*Two cuirasses of a new light armor, [i]Night Companion Armor[/i] found in Jorrvaskr Living Quarters when you join the fighters guild (Advanced Armors Perk, Studded Forge, just above Elven Normal Armor stats).\r<br />-*Added unfinished [i]Knight of the Vale Helm[/i] *none node item--usable but it drops into Oblivian* (Advanced Armors Perk, Imperial forge, Steel Plate stats).\r<br />-Talsgarth the Wandererer equips Tyrion Lannister Jerkin.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=lightblue][font=&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;]::REPLACEMENT ARMOR VERSIONS[/font] (everything above & replaces Guard & Soldier armors in versions [b]11-21[/b]); replaced armors maintain vanilla stats, some maintain vanilla picture & dropped appearance as well (i.e. boots) until [b]21[/b] in which equipped armors are improved::[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]11: Imperial Lion - tyranny is carnivorous:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />-Armor appearance of Lannister Regular Armor (Imperial Leather), Lannister Elite Armor (Imperial Studded). *Heavy imperial Armor NOT replaced here due to Guard equipment conflicts. Legionnaires use black Dragon&#39;s Reach Helm (Imperial Light Helmet) & Lannister Helm variously.\r<br />-Female replacement Lannister Regular Armor (Imperial Studded Armor). *This leaves Imperial Leather with vanilla/your installed mod female versions so you perhaps maintain Imperial skirts for you/your followers if desired.\r<br />-Imperial Shields unchanged. Another shield would be preferable but no new shields are in the GoT armor pack. You can change them to anything you like of course in the Creation Kit by changing the Armor Add-On reference in each or folder replacers--I replaced them with two shields from Ultimate Assortment Mod in my Skyrim version (see last few pictures).\r<br />-*Player imperial outfits now give heavy set of Lanister Elite Armor in each (Light replacer, Studded replacer, Vanilla Imperial Plate; & Deadric Heavy Lanister Elite Armor with cloak).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]13: Starkcloaks & Whiterun&#39;s End - rebel scum & condescending guard replacement armor:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />-Armor appearance of Stark Standard Armor (Stormcloak Cuirass), for males only. Soldiers & Guards use Stark helm, a few vanilla helms; gloves & boots variously. Some guards will equip heavy gloves & boots that look the same as the light replacements.\r<br />-Soom Sons Commanders outfitted with a few helmets & one in Jory Stark Armor.\r<br />-Whiterun Guard Armor appearance of Storm&#39;s End Armor (Whiterun Guard Cuirass). Guards use Storm&#39;s End helm, two vanilla helms; gloves & boots variously. Some guards will equip heavy gloves & boots that look the same as the light replacements.\r<br />-Necessary to change to Leather Boots (Stormcloak Fur Boots) to remove clipping issues with Stormcloaks & Hold Guards. \r<br />-*Player Stormcloak reward outfits now give light & heavy armors in each (both are Stark Standard in appearance in first outfit (replacer & steel); Stark Captain & Vanilla Bear in second outfit).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]15: Imperial Lannister vs. Stark Son&#39;s of Skyrim (combines replacements from 11 & 13):[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]21: Guards & Soldiers Overhaul (version 15 plus most Hold Guards given replacer outfits):[/b]\r<br />\r<br />-*Imperial Heavy Armor appearance of Knight of Flowers Armor (Imperial Heavy Plate), female Heavy Imperial Armor unchanged. \r<br />-Solitude Guards equip Dragon&#39;s Reach Armor replacer.\r<br />-Markarth Guards wear Hound Cuirass replacer.\r<br />-Morthal Guards wear Bronn&#39;s Sell Sword Armor replacer.\r<br />-Dawnstar Guards wear Iron Islands Armor replacer (these look really good).\r<br />-*All Holds helmets, gloves, boots diversified wear possible with GoT & compatible vanilla items.\r<br />-All new Guard Armors have increased stats from ~Leather to ~Scale light armors; craftable & temperable (Studded Forge).\r<br />-A couple items placed in common dungeons--just play, you will find them.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=lightblue][font=&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;]::SEPERATE PLUG-INS[/font] (if desired install in addition to ONE of the main files)::[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Main File NOT required (compatible with main file of [b]Lower[/b] number only; options included in higher number main files--so [b]21[/b] includes [b]18fh[/b] (While the lady housecarls have nice shapely armor, I left Rikke out of the replacers as I think most will prefer her in your own female friendly imperial plate armor):\r<br />\r<br />[b]18xx: Warrior Maidens - for all, rather a few of, the Ladies:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />*Separate plug-in for Housecarls Irileth & Faleen in Lannister Regular Armor (female armor).\r<br />   ...18fr = includes Legate Rikke in Flowers Armor (male armor).\r<br />   ...18fh = Legate Rikke NOT included\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]29xx: Tullius & Ulfric - seasick crocodiles (only affected in this plug-in; they are unchanged in all other versions):[/b]\r<br />\r<br />-Separate plug-in for Tullius in Stannis Armor.\r<br />-Ulfric in ...\r<br />   ...09cm = Clegane the Mountain, or\r<br />   ...09rs = Robb Stark, or\r<br />   ...09bt = Brienne of Tarth (*the Brienne Armor belt, Brienne Boots & Clegane Boots do not render properly unless you download [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48107/?]Game of Thrones Armor Compilation - Fix[/url]--neither of the Boots is outfitted anywhere in this mod).\r<br />\r<br /> . . .\r<br />\r<br />-If one of the versions I posted is close to what you want or there is one or two NPCs you want to equip differently, the plug-ins are easily edited in the Creation Kit to your desire (or entries deleted with TESVEdit). Let me know if you have questions or innovative requests.\r<br />-Thank you for your consideration & remember try not to be a jackass (Skyrim needs a Jackass mod--the animal I mean--or a pack mule for merchants & adventurers alike).\r<br />-I will incorporate some of the Witcher helmets into my own continuing version of this mod along with other edits. If I will post additional changes is uncertain/unlikely. Changing/adding helmets to equipment list on this mod is the least troublesome if you wish to make changes there.\r<br />-A folder replacer version is not likely as it is not really needed for the constantly spawning guards & soldiers.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=gold][font=&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;]WINTER   GUARD   -   CREDITS[/font][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />**Please endorse [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27301/?]Game of Thrones Armor Compilation[/url] for all of the work done by \r<br />\r<br />-Bilwit - Texture Wizard\r<br />-TheDahaka - MOIAF - Mods Of Ice And Fire\r<br />-Kronaras - Arakh Blade - Game of Thrones\r<br />-L0rdofWar - Witcher 2 Models\r<br />-Marinetastic - Game of Thrones mini-pack\r<br />-Nikinoodles - Cloaks of Skyrim\r<br />-OmegaRed99 - Omegared99&#39;s Armor compilation\r<br />-Th3Wick3d1 - Witcher 2 - Viper Assassin-Blue Stripes-Roche-Ves\r<br />-donker316 - Game of Thrones Armor Compilation\r<br />-GenPlagueLord - Game of Thrones Armor Compilation - Fix\r<br />\r<br />(Apologies if I neglected someone; credits from GenPlagueLord&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48107/?]Game of Thrones Armor Compilation - Fix[/url])\r<br />\r<br />[b]Tools Employed[/b]\r<br />Creation Kit\r<br />TESVEdit\r<br />\r<br />[b]Mods appearing in sceenshots:[/b]\r<br />Wet & Cold\r<br />Cloaks of Skyrim\r<br />Real Swords - TCOSS\r<br />Jaysus Swords\r<br />Bob&#39;s Armory\r<br />Ultimate Assortment\r<br />Acdale EyeCandy Body ADEC\r<br />ADEC Toosil BODY ([b]Whoa&#33;&#33;[/b])\r<br />ADEC Armor n Clothing Compilation",
