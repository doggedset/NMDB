  "descriptionHtml": "=INTRODUCTION=\r<br />\r<br />Well, when I first played Skyrim, on my girlfriend&#39;s Playstation 3, I was really annoyed as soon as I saw the loading screen. It was saying &#34;and the scrolls have foretold of black wings in the cold&#34;, so I asked my girlfriend &#34;is that Alduin? That quote talks about him?&#34; \r<br />\r<br />Well, when she told me that yes, that was the &#34;black&#34; dragon the quote was talking about, I was like: &#34;Are you fu****g kidding me?&#34;\r<br />\r<br />=MOD DESCRIPTION=\r<br />\r<br />Let&#39;s face it, vanilla Alduin is neither black nor scary, it looks like a toy, something that people would never be really afraid of. I decided to change this, to make Alduin more like the demigod he is supposed to be, more scary, more intimidating. My goal was to have a dragon wich you actuall call World Eater, something that would&#39;ve make you say &#34;I would be scared as hell by being in front of him&#34;, and this is where my mod comes in&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The first thing to do was to get rid of that dull grey color, turning it to a nicer matte black. But that was not enough, the base texture was a bit monochrome, so I started to color the teeth, the claws and, in the end, his mouth. Then I made the eyes, my favourite part of the work. My goal was to make them like two volcanic embers, like Alduin was generated by the fire itself and the fire was stuck in his eyes. Even his gaze had to be scary, like his body appearence. And that is it, the mod was done. At first, I made it only for personal use, but as soon as I looked upon the results of my work, I decided to share it with you.\r<br />\r<br />Now you can really have a true World Eater as a main antagonist of the game, a true black dragon&#33;\r<br />\r<br />=MANUAL INSTALLATION (not recommended)=\r<br />\r<br />1 - Download the file to your desktop, or wherever you want, and extract the files\r<br />2 - Copy the Data folder in your Skyrim directory\r<br />3 - Overwrite everything, if prompted\r<br />4 - Enjoy your brand new Alduin&#33;\r<br />\r<br />=NMM INSTALLATION (not recommended)=\r<br />\r<br />1 - Download the file via Nexus Mod Manager\r<br />2 - Activate the mod by double click it\r<br />3 - Overwrite everything, if prompted\r<br />4 - Enjoy your brand new Alduin&#33;\r<br />\r<br />=MOD ORGANIZER INSTALLATION= (highly recommended)=\r<br />\r<br />1 - Download the file in any way you like (manual or downloading with manager)\r<br />2 - During the installation, make sure to click on &#34;Manual&#34;, then right click on the &#34;Data&#34; folder and, then, on &#34;set data directory&#34;\r<br />3 - Click ok and and then activate the mod\r<br />4 - Enjoy your brand new Alduin&#33;\r<br />\r<br />=LOAD ORDER=\r<br />\r<br />This mod will obviously conflict with any other mod wich changes the dragons appearance, so if you use, say, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29631/?]Bellyaches HD Dragon Replacer Pack[/url], make sure to load my mod after this one, so you can have bothe Bellyhaches&#39;s HD dragons and my black Alduin.\r<br />\r<br />=RECOMMENDED MODS=\r<br />\r<br />There are two mods I would strongly recommend: \r<br />\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2254/?]Alduin is not made of plastic[/url] by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1020871/?]Ikibblesticks[/url].
