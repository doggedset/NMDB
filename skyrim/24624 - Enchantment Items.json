  "summary": "Do you ever get tired of having to either track down every item in the game to complete your full enchantment list?  Or you have to go through each individual item and input them manually?  Not anymore!\r\n\r\nPlease ENDORSE if it worked for you!",
  "descriptionHtml": "This neat little batch program is based off the one I noticed on here from yoo203.  Yoo203 came with a way to add all items needed to complete alchemy and smithing perks quickly.  Well this one does the same thing, but does it for all enchanted items.  I know you can utilize a console command to give you all enchantments and shouts, but it is marked as RISKY and could damage your game.  Why bother!?  Utilizing \\'bat enchants\\' you click on a container in the console area, you can put all the necessary items in that one container or use \\'bat enchants2\\' and put them on your person.  Be aware of the weigh of said enchanted equipment! I added a carryweight limit increase on bat enchants2 so you don\\'t get weighed down with equipment.  If you are having trouble with installing the files, just make sure you put them in your Skyrim/Data folder on your hard drive.  ENJOY!",
