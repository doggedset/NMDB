  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6]MOD IS PROVIDED AS IS[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Adds Ifrit from the Final Fantasy Series as a summon. \r<br />Spell Tome can be found on Ifrit himself at Arcwind Point to the southeast of Helgen and Southwest of Ivarstead. \r<br />He is seriously OP and can use Fire Breath and Unrelenting Force. He knows almost all Fire spells including Fire Storm and Flame Cloak. *He has yet to use Fire Storm in testing* He also carries a uniquely named Daedric Warhammer called &#34;Hellfire&#34; which does 30 points fire damage. \r<br />Good Luck beating him. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Upcoming Stuff: Shiva, Ramuh, Odin and Buhamut summons. Possibly a quest to connect them.",
