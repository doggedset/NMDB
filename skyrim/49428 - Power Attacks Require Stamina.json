(If you disagree, please let me know in the comments and explain your reasoning - if you are correct I will update the mod.)\r<br />\r<br />[b][i]Note[/i][/b] that this mod [b][i]does not[/i][/b] change the amount of stamina such attacks [b][i]consume[/i][/b], only what they [b][i]require to initiate[/i][/b]. In vanilla, you can initiate power attacks as long as your stamina &gt; 0. So, you can have a bit of vegetable soup, or anything else that continuously restores your stamina, and spam power attacks and bashes with no cooldown. This mod raises that requirement to &gt; 30, so there will always be a cooldown.\r<br />\r<br />This makes items like restore stamina potions, various alcoholic beverages, etc., a lot more useful in combat now, where previously they were pretty much useless in the face of that ultimate of combat consumables, the mighty vegetable soup. It also makes raising your stamina quite a bit more worthwhile, whereas before the main reason to do that was to increase carry weight.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1482617-relz-power-attacks-require-stamina/]Thread on Bethesda forums[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Place the contents of the archive in your Skyrim/Data directory. Works with Nexus Mod Manager.\r<br />\r<br />The mod can be uninstalled at any time.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t use any other combat mods, so I can&#39;t speak for them. You&#39;ll want to check for conflicts yourself in TES5Edit, before posting in the comments thread. This mod only changes four records, and it doesn&#39;t use any scripts, so the risk of conflict is low but not zero.\r<br />\r<br />[b]History:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />1.0 - Initial release.",
