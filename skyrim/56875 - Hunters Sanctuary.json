  "summary": "A player house in a new Tranquil world space ideal for hunter charaters",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hunters Sanctuary is tucked away in the mountains just outside of Riverwood surrounded by high mountain peaks it is a tranquil area full of deer and other wildlife . A small but homely Lodge sits under the mighty waterfall that feeds the small lake. This is an Early Alpha release and so it likely to contain errors especially in the navmesh area (although i think its ok atm ) Currently the lodge has no interior, the fishery planters and craft areas should all work . This mod should be totally compatible with any other mod as the only area in Tamriel that itt edits is the entrance just outside of riverwood \r<br />HEARTHFIRES is required ",
