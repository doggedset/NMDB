The community is completely free to use what is available and edit it to their heart&#39;s content. Please credit me if you&#39;re using any files I&#39;ve provided.\r<br />[b]12/19/11:[/b] Type A Male is available for download.  It still needs some touchups, but I&#39;m satisfied (and fed up) with it enough for now.  Expect some fixes to them along with updates on the female textures after Christmas.  Enjoy&#33;\r<br />[b]12/16/11:[/b] So, I&#39;ve been working diligently to get an update out soon, but I didn&#39;t want to put out something that I felt was too rushed or crappy.  I&#39;ve had a lot of ideas that I&#39;ve posted pictures of, but later scrapped (some of them I&#39;ll return to in the future.)\r<br />My current goal is to get one completed base body texture available for download, and towards that end I&#39;ve made my first face texture: [color=lightgreen]http://skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/image.php?id=14762[/color]  All I need to do is mess around with the hands, feet and tail, and I&#39;ll have my first completed full-body retexture.\r<br />Thanks to all of you who have been watching the mod and waiting expectantly.  My current deadline for the next update is 12/20/11, but I think I&#39;ll have the textures adequately done by this Sunday&#33;\r<br />[b]12/10/11:[/b] I&#39;ve got decent enough OS maps to continue the project.  I&#39;m now working on scale textures.\r<br />[b]12/9/11:[/b] It&#39;s finals week for me, but they&#39;ll only last to Wednesday, so I&#39;m hoping to release another texture by Friday.  If you&#39;re willing to help me learn about OS mapping in 3DS Max, feel free to reply in this thread: [color=lightgreen]http://www.thenexusforums.com/index.php?/topic/478145-object-space-normal-mapping/[/color]\r<br />[b]12/4/11:[/b] I&#39;ve gotten several requests for the Drachis model I&#39;ve been showing in my screenshots, so it&#39;s now an optional save file.  You&#39;ll start things off at the chopping block.  Depending on what mods you have, the eyes may be different, but you can change anything using the &#34;showracemenu&#34; console command.  You might also notice that sometimes his skin appears dark green, other times it appears gray.  This is merely a trick of the lighting/shaders/etc. [b][color=pink]Saved games are usually stored in your &#34;Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Saves&#34; folder, not with your main Skyrim directory.[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][color=lightgreen]Coming soon...[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />- Retexturing of neck seams and stretches. (The female will take a lil&#39; longer because it&#39;s a weirder stretch.)\r<br />- Retexturing of entire body with dragon scales.\r<br />- High-resolution reskin.\r<br />- Replacing dirt and complexion textures with alternate scale colors.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][color=lightgreen]Q & A[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />[b]Q:[/b] I love the concept, but the mod just sux right now.  dudewthsrsly?\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Check back later for updates.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q:[/b] Can you make this a separate race, instead of replacing Argonians?\r<br />[b]A:[/b] When the CK comes out, this mod will be available as both a replacer and an alternate race, along with a few NPC&#39;s added to Skyrim.  They&#39;ll come complete with their own abilities and skill bonuses.  No info yet on what those will ultimately be.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q:[/b] I already have an argonian, but my eye color changed to something completely different?\r<br />[b]A:[/b] To offer a broader variety of eyes, the colors no longer match up with the file names, and thus your eyes may have been awkwardly changed.  Simply press the ` key to bring up the console, then type &#34;showracemenu&#34; to re-edit your character (press the ` key again to close the console and interact with the menu).  Once Bethesda releases the Contruction Kit, I can properly resolve the issue and offer even more variety by using an .esp file.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Q:[/b] Is there a nude version?\r<br />[b]A:[/b] The mod only changes textures, not meshes.  You will need another mod to remove the clothing meshes.  If you have a nude mod, this will simply change the skin. There are currently no compatibility versions available with specific nude mods at this moment.",
