  "summary": "Adds a small improvement to the Apprentice Stone to make it a viable choice over another standing stone. This mod is made with balance in mind.",
  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE:\r\n\r\nI have added a Lite Version of this mod. DO NOT USE BOTH MODS TOGETHER. Each version is stand alone. Pick one or the other, but not both. Lite version will be detailed below.\r\n\r\nI found the Apprentice Stone in vanilla Skyrim to be very lacking. Infact, i couldn\\'t find a single reason to use it over any of the other Standing Stones. So i created this mod to change that.\r\n\r\nCHANGES TO APPRENTICE STONE WITH BETTER APPRENTICE STONE:\r\n\r\n1. Fortify Magicka by 100 points.\r\n2. Recover Magicka Twice as fast.\r\n3. 100% Weakness to Magicka.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this mod was to balance the Apprentice Stone, and give players a reason to actually use this stone over the others. I feel the 100 point fortification to magicka (10 free levels) makes it viable. If you choose this stone, you still incur the penalty of 100% Weakness to Magic, however now the stone confers a bonus that may actually make it worth the risk depending on your character.\r\n\r\nCHANGES TO APPRENTICE STONE WITH BETTER APPRENTICE STONE LITE:\r\n\r\n1. Fortify Magicka by 100 points.\r\n2. Recover Magicka Twice as fast.\r\n3. Weakness to Magic is 50% instead of 100%\r\n\r\nThe goal of the lite version was to still keep the mod somewhat balanced, but yet reduce the Magicka weakness to some degree. I understand some players would rather have the magicka weakness reduced. So if you want a version of this mod with the magicka weakness reduced, then use the lite version. :)\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS TO USE THE MOD:\r\n\r\n1.Install the mod via NMM or manually (by placing Better Apprentice Stone.esp in your Skyrim/Data folder.)\r\n\r\n2. activate the mod (via NMM or Skyrim Launcher)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY:\r\n\r\nCompatible with Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES:\r\n\r\nIf you already have the Apprentice Stone as your standing stone, fast travel to a different stone and accept its blessing. Then fast travel back to the Apprentice Stone and take its blessing again. now the improved Apprentice Stone will take effect.\r\n\r\nComments welcome. If you find any bugs, let me know! :)\r\n\r\nThis mod is also available on the Steam workshop\r\n\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=130087096\r\n\r\nThe image used for this article is licensed under the Creative Commons by-sa license. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ \r\n\r\nIt uses material from the UESP article http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Apprentice_Stone",
