  "descriptionHtml": "This mod simply adds KettleWitch&#39;s telescopes to be purchased from the Khajiit caravans that travel Skryim. This integration of the telescopes into Skyrim&#39;s economy made sense to me, as it seems logical that the Khajiit caravans would bring strange and exotic merchandise from their travels.\r<br />\r<br />The leather telescope may be bought at level 1, the iron telescopes at level 5, and the Dwemeri telescopes at level 12.\r<br />\r<br />This mod should be safe to install at any time in a playthrough, but I recommend making a bashed patch if you have another mod that edits merchant&#39;s leveled lists.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Required mod:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30473/?]Telescope[/url] by KettleWitch\r<br />\r<br />Recommended Mod:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30816/?]Guess the Distance - Perceptive Scouting[/url] by Ecceau",
