  "summary": "Change your voice type into that of a psychotic killer",
  "descriptionHtml": "Some of us just hate the idea of a silent protagonist. The mod PC player headtracking addresses this issue by allowing us to apply several vanilla voice types to our character, including one of our own. But what if you wanted to play as someone more ridiculous? Someone who enjoys killing for a living? That&#39;s where this mod comes in.\r<br />\r<br />This is a simple mod that changes the custom voice type into that of the postal dude from postal 2. Complete with his humorous one liners and quotes.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Manual users, place the sound folder into the data directory of the skyrim folder. MO & NMM users, open the folder for PC placer head tracking, and put the sound folder in it, overwrite when asked.",
