  "summary": "This gives Camilla a (in my opinion) better nose.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I always thought that Camilla\\'s nose looked a little brutish, like it had been broken or something. This mod gives her a much nicer, thinner nose. I married her, and now I can look at her without mistaking her for a bandit and trying to kill her. Also, can anybody help me find my daughter, Lucia? We moved to Lakeview manor, and we started playing hide and seek. She\\'s good.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I had the ESP and BSA as two separate files, which makes the mod not work. I fixed it, it should be good to play now.",
