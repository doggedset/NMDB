This is a modder\\'s resource for CBBE body conversions.\r\nLocation\r\n ========\r\n none\r\n \r\nDetails\r\n =======\r\n This is a modders resource of the CBBE body options. What this mod does is add the bodies in nif and obj file formats to use as a modders resource. Currently, the Vanilla, Slim and Standard Curvy body options are supported. This mod reorients the body mesh to be both the correct height of the vanilla body and realigns it to line up properly with the hands at the wrists, the ankles at the legs, and the neck seam on the head. It also makes the pieces seamless. I have done this because every time I wanted to do something with the CBBE body, it never lined up correctly with the vanilla models and I always had to guess at what I was doing with body morphing. After talking with Caliente, we addressed this issue so that the realignment could be possible. This should be useful to any modder who likes to do conversions of armors and clothing to the CBBE body and to anyone who wishes to use the CBBE body as a base for new armors and clothing. Since the uv maps are going to overlap, this is primarily intended as a mannequin mesh and the original uv maps are not intended to be used. Keep in mind that if you wish to import the nif file to a 3D program, you will still need to remember to change the User Versions under the Header in the Nif file from 12 and 83 to 11 and 34 respectively. The files do not include skeletons and are purely base meshes.\r\n \r\n This resource includes three variations of the CBBE body, with the largest versions supporting a breast size of C~D. I do not plan to do this for the other cup sizes but it probably will not be too hard to do if lots of people express an interest. This resource uses vanilla hands and feet because you dont really want the extra detail when creating conversions or making new armor and equipment. The extra detail tends to get in the way. \r\n \r\n This mod does not include a template for any other mod bodies (like UNP). If enough people ask for it, and I get permission to do so( if it is needed) then I will look into it.\r\n \r\n Upgrade\r\n =======\r\n I plan to upgrade and improve this mod over time as I fix bugs, think of new ideas, become more adapted to the CK, and so on. Be sure to check back in once and awhile for updates. Be sure to completely uninstall any previous versions of this mod before upgrading though.\r\n \r\nI will not take responsibility for corrupted save games or lost save games. Get into the habit of backing up your saves to protect your game data. Ignore at your own risk!\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n ===============\r\n This mod should not be incompatable with any other mods to my knowledge. However it is always a possibility so please let me know about it if you experience a conflict.\r\n \r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n ====================\r\n \r\n There are no known issues at this time.\r\n \r\nHistory\r\n =======\r\n 12/23/2012- Version 1.1\r\n -Fixes holes in Standard Curvy mesh _1\r\n -Fixes holes in Vanilla mesh option _1\r\n \r\n 12/22/2012-Version 1.05\r\n \r\n  -Seperates CBBE Body files based on option type\r\n -Adds support for the Standard Curvy Body _0 and _1\r\n -Adds support for the Slim Body _0 and _1\r\n -Seperates the Vanilla template based on _0 and _1 body types, no longer a single file\r\n -Removes blend file support\r\n -fixes holes and welds missing seams on the Vanilla Body option\r\n \r\n 12/08/2012-Initial Release\r\n \r\nContact\r\n =======\r\n You can find me on the Nexus Forums here as Natterforme.\r\n \r\nCredits\r\n =======\r\n Thanks to Caliente for allowing me to use her body mod for the resource process.\r\n Thank you to all of you modders who spend so much time converting clothing and armor models to this fantastic body mod!\r\n Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\n Thanks to SkyrimNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\n Thanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\r\n Thanks to all of you who have encouraged me and have supported me since I first put up screenshots of my work back in December 2011 and January 2012.\r\n I thank you all for your patience with me^^.\r\n Thanks to God for creating us all.
