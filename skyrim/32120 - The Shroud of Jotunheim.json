  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Q6Vstri.jpg?1[/img]\r\n\r\nCurrent version: 0.8[/center]\r\n\r\n[color=green][center][b]Introduction[/b][/center][/color]\r\n\r\n[i]A strange meeting, rumors of a mystic island shrouded in darkness and an important mission. An epic journey awaits...[/i]\r\n\r\nThe Shroud of Jotunheim is a very ambitious mod which has taken around 500+ hours to complete and it is now served to you for free. Far away to the north-west of Skyrim lies a long forgotten island with a sinister secret. It is up to you to unveil its shroud and do what you must in order to save yourself and all of Nirn. \r\n\r\nWith a questline of around [b]6-10[/b] hours playtime, The Shroud of Jotunheim offers very much. But there is more: new weapons, treasures, deep storylines, fully voiced NPCs, challenging puzzles, player housing, a big island and a large underground city... It is an adventure-themed mod with hints of horror.\r\n\r\n\r\n[youtube]6qpFnIboq40#![/youtube][youtube]Gwpdk6KkX40[/youtube]\r\n\r\nA very nice video made by MrBiggen, reviewing the mod. Many thanks to him!\r\n\r\nThe second video is made by \\\"EGMNOW\\\" and shows the beginning of the mod. It may contain some minor spoilers. \r\n\r\n\r\n[color=green][center][b]Installation[/b][/center][/color]\r\n\r\nInstalling The Shroud of Jotunheim is very easy and you [b]do not need any previously installed programs[/b]. Just follow these steps and you will be ready to play in minutes.\r\n\r\n[b]1.[/b] Download and extract all files and save them wherever you want (to your desktop, for instance).\r\n[b]2.[/b] Move all the files from the \\\"Data\\\"-folder into Skyrim\\'s \\\"Data\\\"-folder which usually can be found in \\\"...Program (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/\\\". When you are done, you will thus find \\\"Jotunheim.esp\\\" and the other folders in Skyrim\\'s \\\"Data\\\"-folder.\r\n[b]3.[/b] Start up Skyrim\\'s launcher and make sure \\\"Jotunheim.esp\\\" is marked in \\\"Data Files\\\". \r\n[b]4.[/b] Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=green][center][b]Compatibility and recommendations[/b][/center][/color]\r\n\r\nThis mod can be played without any installed programs but Skyrim itself. I do however recommend some things for a better playing experience. First, make sure Skyrim is properly patched to the latest version. Furthermore I do recommend to not play with too much mods on the same time when you are using The Shroud of Jotunheim. It might work but it might also be laggy and buggy.\r\n\r\nI also recommend downloading a nice ENB of your own personal choice; it makes things even prettier. Bringing a companion to Jotunheim can also be a bad idea. Everything is navmeshed but it is not completely companion-friendly (your companion may get lost, however I\\'m not 100% certain). Your own character\\'s level should also be level 8+.\r\n\r\nIf you ever get stuck, use \\\"The Cheater\\'s Amulet\\\" within the mod or download my detailed walkthrough and refer to it! \r\n\r\nThere is currently a bug that does not affect gameplay very much but would be neat to fix: grass in the distance (LOD) is brown, not green, and I have not figured out why that is. If anyone knows, send me a pm!\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/cEioKzG.jpg?1[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[color=green][center][b]Version[/b][/center][/color]\r\n\r\nThe mod is still in beta. It has been tested by two beta-testers who have discovered bugs but there are probably still quite a few of them left. Many scripts are running and it might cause a fps-hit on lower end computers. That is why it might be a good idea to make a proper save before embarking upon this quest or even start a new character. Also, when you happen to meet a mystic man in an old inn; he is sometimes bugged but reloading from a recent save fixes that. Anyway, if you find any more bugs, let me know, preferably in a pm. With your help, we will soon see a v1.0.\r\n\r\nIn the upcoming version, I will make the interiors a bit more well-lit since many people have complained on my fetisch for darkness (hah). I will also add more quest markers, making it more easy to know what to do. \r\n\r\n[color=green][center][b]Credits[/b][/center][/color]\r\n\r\nThere is a slight possibility that I have forgotten to mention someone here so if you recognize your work and are not credited here, do not hesitate to send me a pm and I will include your name below.\r\n\r\n[color=blue][b]Sounds: [/b][/color]\r\n- \\\"http://www.freesound.org\\\".\r\n- \\\"http://www.freesfx.co.uk\\\".\r\n- \\\"http://soundbible.com\\\".\r\n\r\n[color=blue][b]Textures/meshes: [/b][/color]\r\n- Artisanix (the great paintings), \\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17423\\\".\r\n- Tony67 & Oaristys (some useful, random clutter), \\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16525\\\".\r\n- Blary (the marvellous booksets in the shelves), \\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14135\\\".\r\n- Urwy (some nice weapons), \\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12087\\\".\r\n- Runspect (some neat, random clutter), \\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26132\\\"[/size].\r\n\r\n[color=blue][b]Beta-testers: [/b][/color]\r\n- My sister, Anna.\r\n- My friend, Andreas.\r\n\r\n[color=blue][b]Voice actors[/b][/color]\r\n- Agnes, as The Lady of the Lake.\r\n- Martin (myself), as Sverkir, Lirva, Grol, Jeezar.\r\n- Andreas, as the Master.\r\n- Caroline, as Helgi.\r\n- Edvin, as Albreckt.\r\n- Siri, as Lilja.\r\n- Max, as Alexis.\r\n\r\nFor those listed here, I wish to extend a grand \\\"Thank you very much!\\\".
