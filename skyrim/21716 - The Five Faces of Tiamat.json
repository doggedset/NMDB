  "descriptionHtml": "Many years prior to the calling of the Dragonborn by the Greybeards of Skyrim, the Five Faces of Tiamat had been tempered with fire and ice should a threat such as dragons ever return to life. From the five corners of the world the splintered intelligence of Tiamat has regrouped in Whiterun\\'s Warmaiden with service and skill to aide the Dragonborn in their struggles against the terror of Dragons.\r\n\r\n5 Fully Functional Followers, already set to the player\\'s alliance (Whiterun, Warmaiden\\'s):\r\n- Elyoki, called Red Dragon - High Elf Mage, Mastery over fire and ice, rumored to have bargained with Evil.\r\n- Dactylartha, called Blue Dragon - High Elf Spellwarrior. Well-rounded and prefers his bound weapons.\r\n- T\\'Narg Whiteskull, called White Dragon - Orc Chieftain, last of his clan. Bloodbound to the High Elf Brothers.\r\n- Ser Rhofer Blackscale, called Black Dragon - Imperial Centurion. Fearless and Loyal, an exemplary companion.\r\n- Slug, called the Green Dragon. Argonian Fence and worldwide Merchant, he prefers gold over gore and glory.\r\n\r\n2 Additional Fully Functional Followers:\r\n- Ser Bhofer Goldeneye (Riften Bunkhouse) - Deadeye sniper, elder brother of Ser Rhofer. Silent means deadly.\r\n- Devont Ebonhand (Winterhold College) - Puppeteer of the soulless. Formerly nemesis to the High Elf brothers.\r\n\r\nEach NPC has basic starting equipment, starts at level 3 and levels with the character.\r\nThis mod is fully compatible with other mods as it only adds new content to the game.\r\nThis mod is in its earliest of Beta stages: quests, objectives, rewards, and dialogues expected to follow.\r\n\r\nOver 300 current users from Steam Workshop: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=83478794\r\n\r\nBug: the NPC\\'s have grey-faces.  Included are the character files to be extracted to Steam>Steamapps>Common>Skyrim\r\n\r\nWant to have all 5 of the Faces of Tiamat escort you through the most dangerous of places in Skyrim?\r\nFor a mod that allows for up to fifteen followers at once download:\r\n-The UFO Ultimate Follower Overhaul at http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037/ and follow the \\\"failsafe install instructions.\\\" Once the UFO is installed, gamesaved, place Tiamat (This mod) on top of UFO in load order (load UFO as the last mod).\r\n-The Less Cumbersome Extensible Follower Framework (which I currently use) at http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12933\r\n\r\nPlease comment =)",
