  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod, it adds a abandoned player home hidden in the mountains from view, along the path north of the Old Hroldan Inn behind the camp site, aimed towards the evil mage type characters, the home itself is rather small and cluttered so I don\\'t recommend having a spouse or follower live with you there, but I have done the navmesh by hand incase you wish to do so, it also comes with a enchanting, a alchemy tables and a leather rack, also with some free soul gems and ingredients.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you\\'re a smith and like to use weapons and armor then you\\'ll have to do a bit of walking, not very much thankfully, the inn has a grind wheel and further along the road there is a mine that has a smelter, I added a workbench next to the grind wheel and a forge next to the smelter.\r\n\r\nIf you download and like this mod please indorse and give me your opinion on it, thank you.
