  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE- New version posted. It is compressed with 7zip so it should prevent NMM crashing issues, and it has a more logical recipe.\r\n\r\nThis is a re-texture of the Golden Rapier available at http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11708,\r\nmade by mystic-hybrid and imported from Oblivion by badgremlin.\r\n\r\nI re-textured it so that it looks less glossy and upped some of the stats- it now has about a 5th or 3rd more reach, crit chance, damage etc. Quite a decent weapon, and not unbalanced.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it can now be upgraded normally.\r\n\r\nThe weapon can be crafted like any elven sword.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nBookGuy\r\n\r\nNote- the retexture isn\\'t perfect; close examination will find a few speckles and spots of black on the sword. Sadly there isn\\'t anything I can do about that, but the sword still looks great.",
