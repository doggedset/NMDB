  "descriptionHtml": "---README---\r\n\r\nfor DALLs - Arcane_Enchanter \r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n\r\n22/12/2011\r\n\r\nArcane_Enchanter is custom re-texturing (n not simple recolour) mod which changes how Enchanting Table n Workstation looks.*\r\n\r\n* Word of warning - my work actually do changes how these items look - rather then \\\"polishes\\\" same / boring game \\\"apple\\\" a bit further as many other popular mods do - so it might not be fit for casual modders or more-of-same seekers!\r\n\r\nNot much to say here as purpose of this mod should be quite obvious. As for reason for making it - I did not care much for Bethesda\\'s scruffy one thus this (much) more up-market one. Real must-have - at bargain price ;) - for all serious Home Owners and professional Enchanters. \r\n\r\nTo install you need to navigate to your Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim - game folder and paste / drag n drop in it my Data (mod) folder. Allow overwrite!    \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like this new look, simply delete / remove my (check for names my mod) texture files from Data/textures/clutter - and original look will be restored to your game.\r\n\r\nBugs/conflicts: none known - but take care not to overwrite them (my textures) by accident!\r\n  \r\nUse:\r\nFree to use but if any files included (therein) are to be used for modding ask me for permission!\r\n\r\nEnjoy and try to remember - if you like it even in a part - to give endorsement! \r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for really great game.\r\n",
