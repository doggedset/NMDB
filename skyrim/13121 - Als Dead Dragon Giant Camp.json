  "summary": "A treasure trove of loot to put dragon lairs, giant camps, and Mehrunes Dagon to shame.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Giant camps. Dragon lairs. Dwarven ruins. Mehrunes Dagon&#39;s shrine. Pinewatch.\r<br />\r<br />The best sources of loot in the game, and my favorite places to frequent. Heck, even Riften is full of it - 7 big chests in the castle, 3 thief caches, and the 5 lockpicking practice chests, not to mention the tribute chest.\r<br />\r<br />So, taking inspiration from all of those, which - except for Dwarven ruins and Pinewatch - are quick in-and-out places, with a great return for little time, I have made Dead Dragon Giant Camp. Just a quick little place, in and out fairly quickly, but with great - and I mean absurdly fantastic - RESPAWNING loot.\r<br />\r<br />Just north and slightly west of Whiterun, three giants have set up camp over a daring thief&#39;s hidden safehouse. They have just successfully defended their home against a dragon; how will YOU fare?\r<br />\r<br />The map marker is pre-marked on your map, although you cannot fast travel to it until you reach it for the first time. There is a little story told through two journals. Learn the fate of those who dare defy the gods, and have not the blood of gods in their own veins.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy&#33; ^-^ (I know my loot-happy roommate will&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />HINT - If you can&#39;t find the key to the stash, read the journal on the table just outside the locked door. ^-^\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]OTHER MODS BY ME[/u]:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Al&#39;s Completionist Series:\r<br />    1.
