  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new race to Skyrim, the Death Elf Race. Also known as &#34;Soul Takers&#34; in their homeland of Carthis, They rightfully earned their names by bringing death upon all who dared challenge them. Death elves are noted for their unmatched magic ability. Death elves are also deadly with weapons. They are naturally resistant to fire and poison. They are able to morph into a beast of death once a day. \r<br />[center][u][b][size=5]Backstory[/size][/b][/u][/center][size=3][/size][left][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=3]Some time ago, a dark elf named Melmon Arnsvas was sitting in a cage next to other people and creatures of all races in cages just like his. There were other Dark elves in this room and had been more until they were taken out never to be seen again. One day the scientist who had locked them in there came in like he had many times before and this time he took Melmon with him. Melmon was tied to a chair and experiments were done on him for days. A few days after Melmon was taken he woke up to the face of this mad scientist, &#34; I&#39;m Lendon Dra&#34;Lir&#34; he said. &#34;You have been the first success in experiment XIV, or the death species&#34; Melmon was then taken outside, to an island he hadn&#39;t seen before. He was led to a cave full of living essentials and observed by Lendon Dra&#39;Lir from the massive tower that stood before him. Over time Melmon discovered that he had abilities that he hadn&#39;t had before, but he swore he wouldn&#39;t use them because of the manner in which he had obtained them. One day Lendon Dra&#39;Lir came out of the tower with another dark elf, a female. He introduced them and left them be. A few weeks later Lendon Came down out of the tower again and he told Melmon and the female dark elf, [/size][size=3]Rilosa Lletethyl, that he had decided that it was time for them to leave his island that he called Carthis so we got onto a boat and set off to Skyrim. When they arrived at Skyrim they were given a home in Helgen. They would see Lendon Dra&#39;Lir observing them once and a while, but anytime either Melmon[/size], [/font]or Rilosa would try to approach him he would disappear. Eventually Lendon stopped observing them and they had kids, who they realized had the same abilities as them, but they were more violent than normal children. Multiple times this family had to move because of... incidents. Skyrim came to know this family and all children born into it as the Death Elves.[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]\r<br />                                       [size=3][/size][u]Features[/u]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=3]DeathBeast Form - Morph into a beast that brings only death in it&#39;s wake.
