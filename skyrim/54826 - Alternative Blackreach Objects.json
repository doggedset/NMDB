Well that would be a good start to a story but this one is much simpler. \r<br />\r<br />I went underground noticed a few things that I just thought looked silly and wrong and then made some alternative versions for use in my modlist and now I share with ya all. \r<br />\r<br />[size=2]The Blackreach Sun  [/size]\r<br />\r<br />The vanilla design is actually quite nice.. however I found the model rather interresting to work with, and thought it would be nice with a more shiny version. So I did some new textures and some model work to create a look of a liquid core with some metal grid floating on top... as well as making it shine. \r<br />\r<br />[size=2]The Blackreach Crystals  [/size]\r<br />Never liked em... most likely never will&#33; Redid the model, and the textures and made a fancy looking crystal that can change color depending on the lighting. \r<br />\r<br />[size=2]The other stuff  [/size]\r<br />I also altered the color of the bushes so they do not stand out as teal dots in the landscape... as well as make the tentacles from the ceiling less glowy.  \r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Installation:  [/size]\r<br />It is simple textures and meshes use your mod manager to install and remove like normal. Folder structure should be correct&#33; \r<br />\r<br />I provide one pack with everything, and two separate for the sun and crystals. \r<br />\r<br />The Crystal meshes are based on the SMIM UV corrected ones, so they are fine to overwrite&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[size=5]&#34;Incompatibilities&#34;  [/size]\r<br />The sun is based on the vanilla pattern design.. so if you somehow got a retexture that alters this...then you will get a funky looking sun with the wrong parts looking shiny. I am not aware of any textures that alter this however, but figured I would mention it. \r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/CCOyRdAl.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits: \r<br />Bethesda for the game and all the goodies to play with&#33; \r<br />Brumbek for making SMIM&#33; His UV work have been used a base for my model changes.  \r<br />\r<br />Permissions: \r<br />If you want to use these assets in your own mod, please ask me first&#33; I will most likely agree it is the best idea since sliced bread&#33; \r<br />I do not give permission for these assets to be redistributed to other sites then the Nexus. \r<br />",
