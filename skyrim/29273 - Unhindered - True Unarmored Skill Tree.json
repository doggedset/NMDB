  "summary": "This adds a new skill to the game, Unarmored. It is scaled by taking damage without armor on, and has its own perk tree stored alongside light armor.",
  "descriptionHtml": "SKSE Required - http://skse.silverlock.org/\r<br />\r<br />I found it annoying that Unarmored did not make an appearance in Skyrim as a skill option. For this reason I have made Unhindered, and simulated a skill through script. How it works:\r<br />\r<br />If one takes damage while unarmored you will gain experience towards the next rank. Your current rank can be known by casting a 0 Mana spell under Alteration called Check Unarmored Stats. It also tells you the percentage towards your next rank you have earned. When you gain a rank in Unarmored it will say you have gained a rank in Light Armor. You haven&#39;t. This is merely to trick the game engine into progressing you towards your next level as would any other skill. The amount of experience required to gain a rank is exactly the same as Light Armor (it does increase with every rank earned, this page has the formula (http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Leveling), but it should advance slightly faster than light armor. This is because Light Armor advances according to the amount of damage received while wearing the armor. This is true also of Unarmored, but the amount of damage being received is slightly higher due to - guess what - your lack of armor.\r<br />For every 10 ranks of Unarmored you get a 1% reduction in damage taken while unarmored. This stacks by multiplication with the Callused ranks (below) such that with all 5 ranks of Callused and 100 skill of Unarmored you will have 46% damage reduction without armor.\r<br />\r<br />You begin with 15 ranks, unless you are Breton or an Elf, which begin at 20, while the Khajiiti start at 25.\r<br />\r<br />The following perks may be attained upon gaining the appropriate rank in Unarmored, and their benefits are only given to the player while they are completely without armor worn. Clothes, robes, jewelry etc. do not count as armor.\r<br />\r<br />Calussed - 5 ranks of 8% damage reduction. Ranks can be earned at Skill Level 15,20,40,60,80\r<br />Swift Striker - 5 ranks of 5% increased attack speed with weapons. Ranks can be earned at Skill Level 20, 30, 40, 50, 60\r<br />Swift Thinker - 5 ranks of 30% increased Magicka regeneration. Ranks can be earned at Skill Level 20, 30, 40, 50, 60\r<br />Unburdened - 5 ranks of 5% improved movement speed and 20 lbs of Carry Weight. Ranks can be earned at Skill Level 40,50,60,70,80\r<br />Precision Striker - 5 ranks of 10% increased attack damage with weapons. Ranks can be earned at Skill levels 60,70,80,90,100\r<br />Precision Thinker - 5 ranks of 10% improved spell MAGNITUDES (not reduction in spell costs). Ranks can be earned at Skill levels 60,70,80,90,100\r<br />Ensorceled - 5 ranks of 12% increased effects from ALL WORN ENCHANTMENTS. Note that this includes things that you did not yourself enchant and also counts on weapons. Available at skill levels 80,85,90,95,100.\r<br />\r<br />That about covers it, I hope someone out there enjoys using this mod as much as I have had making it and using it myself.\r<br />\r<br />If you are using the compatibility version (should be used if you are using something that edits the Light Armor tree, such as Requiem or Skyrim Redone) rather than just look at the perk tree, you will have to cast another 0 mana alteration spell called Summon Unarmored Skill Mannequin, which will summon a ball of light you can talk to to gain perks. It will have topics of dialogue matching the perks you qualify for that you do not already have. You must do this after choosing health/stamina/magicka, for only then do you have a perk point to spend.",
