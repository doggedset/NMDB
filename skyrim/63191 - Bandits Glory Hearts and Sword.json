You will feel this was part of the original game with how seamlessly it fits into the world \r<br />of Skyrim .[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Will you be able to uncover the new bandit bosses secrets ? Who are the new bosses ? Where are they ? Will you be able to\r<br /> uncover their locations ? Will you survive the fight against those bandit heroes ? Will you be able to kill them and get their treasures while stopping their ambitious plans ? Will you uncover the stories of their families ? Their ambition and jealousy &#33; Their love and hatred &#33; Will you be able to uncover how all these aspects are related to them? .\r<br />Because if you try, beware, as they will not stand idly by and depending on how much you are trying their actions toward you will be different . They will stalk you , they will try to stop you and they will keep trying harder . They will send their men to hunt you down to put a stop to your meddling . \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/61811-1-1424360493.jpg[/img][/size]\r<br />[b][size=3][b][size=3]      so others of them came after me too ...[/size][/b] \r<br />[/size][/b][size=3]\r<br />      [/size][size=3][size=3]Play it your way by either trying to uncover all the secrets and play through the story ... or follow the game normally while still enjoying many of the features added by this mod .
