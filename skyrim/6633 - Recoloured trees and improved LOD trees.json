  "descriptionHtml": "Recoloured trees and improved LOD trees\r<br />\r<br />This mod gives a little bit more colour to pine trees and a lot more colour to the aspen trees.\r<br />The textures are based on the original textures and have the same size, however I had to add some textures to create the colour variance. This might influence your framerate, or might not at all, in my case at least it doesn&#39;t.\r<br />\r<br />The LOD tree textures are modified as well, same way as in my other mod.\r<br />http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6245\r<br />\r<br />I know I&#39;m not the first one creating a tree mod, anyway give it a try if you like the screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is probably not compatible with most other tree mods, so be careful.\r<br />\r<br />Cheers&#33;\r<br />\r<br />--Changelog--\r<br />v0.763\r<br />-changed pine tree colours to much darker tones\r<br />-reduces colour variation of pine trees from 5 to 2\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />--Installation/Deinstallation--\r<br />Just unpack the file into your Skyrim&#92;data directory.\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t like it, just delete the file.\r<br />\r<br />--To-Do--\r<br />Maybe I recolour the rest of the trees...or maybe not ;)",
