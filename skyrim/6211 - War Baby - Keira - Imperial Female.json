  "descriptionHtml": "War Baby - Keira - Lvl 1 Female Imperial\r\n============================================\r\nHere\\'s another one of my feeble attempts at re-creating a real person. This character save was inspired by Keira Knightly. It\\'s hard to duplicate a real person using the presets that come with Skyrim, so the resemblance is fairly subtle.\r\n\r\nI had a tough time picking a nose (no pun intended!). The one that looked best from the front (which I used) does not look the best from the side. There is another nose I almost went with (nose 13 I think) that looks much better from the side but is a little wider and throws off the resemblance more from the front. There\\'s a link below to an article that explains how to change it if you like.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequired Mods\r\n-------------\r\nNone. But your Keira won\\'t look exactly like the one in the pictures if you don\\'t use character enhancement mods. Here are a few I recommend:\r\n\r\nXenius\\' Character Enhancement mods:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=726673\r\n\r\nnecKros\\' Beauty Faces:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1329\r\n\r\nBetter Females by BellaGail:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nYounger Females by Chanon:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3227&navtag=file/images.php?id=3227&tab=3\r\n\r\nI use BellaGail\\'s no makeup skin texture and specular maps combined with Chanon\\'s Younger Females normal maps in the screenshots.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Use It\r\n-------------\r\nDrop the Keira.ess file in your saves folder, usually located in Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves. When you\\'re done with it, delete the file.\r\n\r\nNote: The save starts right inside the keep after following the Imperial soldier. I needed to use the interior lighting for final tweaking.\r\n\r\n\r\nshowracemenu notes\r\n------------------\r\nI\\'ve included screencaps for the color settings I used.\r\n\r\nFor information about customizing Keira\\'s appearance or changing her name, visit this link:\r\n\r\nhttp://j-u-i-c-e.hubpages.com/_2ld6f4u0c40jc/hub/How-to-Change-Your-Characters-Appearance-and-Name-in-Skyrim\r\n",
