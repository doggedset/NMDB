  "modName": "Summon Thalmor Wizard - Ancano",
  "summary": "Allows the player to summon the Thalmor Wizard Ancano!",
  "descriptionHtml": "===Update Notes 08/11/2012 ====================================\r\n\r\nVersion 1b and 2b fixes an unreported issue of Ancano favoring just his beam attack again.  This version fixes this and now Ancano will use both beam and explosion attacks when appropriate.  This version changes the conditions of Ancano summoning his Magic Anomaly.  He will now summon 4 Anomalies more frequently and will resummon them every 1 minute time period.\r\n\r\nVersion 1b has a 24 hour recast timer, while 2b does not have the recast timer.\r\n\r\n===Update Notes====================================\r\n\r\nVersion 1a - Fixes the Magic Anomaly summon so that it doesn\\'t flee from combat.  Also updated Ancano\\'s magic casting so that he\\'ll use both spells more frequently instead of focusing on using his Magnus Beam. Maintains the 24 hour casting limit.\r\n\r\nVersion 2a - Same as above, with the exception that this version maintains the indefinite casting of Ancano.\r\n\r\n===================================================\r\n\r\nVersion 1 - Ancano can be summoned every 24 ingame hours.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 - Ancano can be summoned at any time.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL BONUS:  Added a new conjuration spell tome: Summon Magic Anomaly.  Can be found at the Arch Mage\\'s quarters near the Arch Mage\\'s bed.  This tome allows the payer to summon their own Magic Anomaly similar to Ancano\\'s.  Warning, this will desummon any other summoned NPCs.\r\n\r\nI made this summon for the Thalmor sympathizers, or for those who would like to have an enslaved Thalmor to fight for them.\r\n\r\nAncano\\'s Tome can be found in the Mage\\'s College Hall of Elements.  It is located on the window accross from the Hall\\'s entrance.  If I did the script correctly, the tome should only be available after completing the Mage\\'s questline.  If not, consider it as an early present =P.\r\n\r\nAncano is equipped with the following (Spell descriptions can potentially have spoilers, please read at your own discretion):\r\n\r\n1. Magnus Beam - Tapping to the magical energies of the Eye of Magnus, Ancano can unleash beams of magic that damages health and magicka.\r\n2. Magnus Blast - Ancano unleashes an explosive burst of magic that damages both health and stamina.\r\n3: Magnus Barrier - As Ancano was exposed to the Eye of Magnus\\' magical properties, he is capable of unleashing a field of magic that provides him invulnerability for 5 seconds.  As the invulnerability wears off, the field will then absorb minor health and magicka for the duration the field is up.\r\n4: Magic Anomaly Storm - Ancano can unleash 1 to 4 Magic Anomalies to attack and distract his opponents.\r\n5: Ancano will be the same level as the player as he/she summons him.  He will also level up to 81 along with the player.\r\n6: Improved stats in magicka.\r\n\r\nNotes:  Ancano is best used against other magic users because of his Magnus Beam and Magnus Barrier.  He can also take on 1 or 2 melee attackers efficiently with his Magnus Blast and Barrier, but cannot handle a large crowd of melee attackers.  Arrows are his weakness.  His Anomaly Storm is perfect for getting  distracting melee opponents, and he will use it whenever he is about to become overwhelmed.  Although his barrier provides him a very short time of invulnerability, he can still go down quickly with a few precise hits.  \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any issues with this mod. I don\\'t believe it should have any issues with any existing mods. Please endorse if you like the mod, and if not, please feel free to comment. I have many more summons I am creating, and hopefully I\\'ll release them soon! Thank you and enjoy! \r\n",
