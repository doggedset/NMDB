  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a spouse-friendly treehouse home to the game.  I know everyone puts their homes in Riverwood or near Whiterun so I wanted to be different and put it near Solitude. The house is located southwest of Solitude, north of Haafingar Stormwind camp. The house is high up in the trees, giving you a nice scenic view of the Solitude area. General Tullius himself has even stayed there. To get to the house, click on one of the two ladders leading up to the deck. \r\n\r\nThe deck has a sitting area, a fountain, various plants, vegetables, mushrooms, and nirnroot (red & normal)\r\n\r\nThe house includes:\r\n\r\n-Living room\r\n-Kitchen\r\n-Bedroom\r\n-Bathing room\r\n-Cooking spit\r\n-Alchemy table\r\n-Enchanting table\r\n-Bookshelf (holds 18 books)\r\n-4 Mannequins\r\n-Weapon racks\r\n-Display cases (1 regular, 2 dagger)\r\n-Full smithing area (Smelter, forge, workbench, grindstone, tanning machine)\r\n-Tons of storage chests\r\n\r\n=================\r\n[u]Installation[/u]\r\n-Drag and drop the .esp into the data folder\r\n\r\n=================\r\n[Uninstalling[/u]\r\n-Take all your items out of the home and delete the .esp file.\r\n\r\n=================\r\n[u]Known Issues[/u]\r\n-The steam from the smelter comes up through the floor near the bookcase. It\\'s barely noticeable, but it annoys people, the only way to fix it is to take out the smelter. ",
