  "descriptionHtml": "Note: To all adoring Cicero Fans, I realize I have been absent for a few months. I plan to come back in Late-Jan to Mid-Feb. Hope to see you all then. :D\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Extract Version 2.0 to Data Folder. The mod has been updated to version 2.0. Cicero, after many cooking classes and headaches, can provide you with a healthy homecooked meal as well as the option of either... you guessed it: a sweet roll or a carrot. Cicero will also give you a random amount of money each day ranging from 1g -- 1000g\r\n\r\n~ZSBZheria\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod lets you marry Cicero after you finish the Dark Brotherhood questline. Cicero has his own unique marriage dialogue (as I looked through his sound files and edited them in order to fit the situation at hand.) It\\'s really cool and something I had a lot of fun both creating and using within Skyrim.\r\n \r\nV.  2.0: You can go through the marriage ceremony with him. He will attend the marriage ceremony and recieve a Bond of Matrimony. He will cook meals for you and give you a random amount of money everyday.\r\n\r\nPlease Rate/Endorse/Comment if you like this mod and Comment if you have any problems with it. \r\n\r\nFuture Plans for this mod include:\r\n\r\nV.2.5: Store and moving capabilities. \r\n\r\nV.3: (Maybe) Possibly creating a unique questline in order to gain his hand. Not sure exactly what that would be, but if any of you have ideas please post them and your idea may be included! :)\r\n\r\n Both Cicero and I bid you farewell.Thanks!\r\n\r\nPlease don\\'t upload on any other sites.\r\nPlease don\\'t steal my work.\r\n~Thanks!\r\n\r\n-ZSBZheria\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nTo those wonderful (yet way too simple) Creation Kit tutorials on CreationKit.com for helping me get my foot in the door. \r\nTo Bethesda Game Studios and Bethesda Softworks for creating the wonderful game of Skyrim and the amazing NPC that is Cicero.\r\nTo Andy Morris who did a great job of voicing Cicero!\r\nTo all of the people in the comments who are currently helping me refine this mod through various bug reports. *They get sweet rolls for their help :)*",
