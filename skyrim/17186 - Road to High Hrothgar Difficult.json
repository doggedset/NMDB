  "descriptionHtml": "A small addition I made on the way up to High Hrothgar,It is not easy and I don\\'t have a background story built yet, but I did try to set the scene as to what is occuring, but as I said not full backstory yet. This is my first mod, I made it for some of the more experienced players. I hope you like it!---You may want to be a high level as well or you may get killed in one blow!---\r\n\r\nYou might want to complete the story line before downloading this mod as well or at least be a higher level, for it is pretty difficult to reach High Hrothgar for the first time if your too low of level, the adds aren\\'t set at a PC level Mult they are their own set levels/health/skills, meaning they won\\'t get any easier or harder as you level.\r\n\r\nIt consists so far of about 6 very difficult bosses(at least if your alone and low level) on your way up to High Hrothgar. I would recommend healing potions, enchantments, companions, and/or having some skill in defence and/or offence =P\r\n\r\nAs I\\'ve said this is my first mod, still learning the CK, if you have any ideas on a background story message them to me, if any glitches or bugs also let me know and I will \\\"try\\\" to fix them, \r\n\r\nThis shouldn\\'t need any mods to work, I only loaded the Skyrim.esm when I made it.\r\n\r\nIf you like it or don\\'t like it leave comments in the comments section, if enough people like it I will try to further the story possibly, \r\n\r\nI do not have a very long attention span, so if I don\\'t reply or update right away, I probably am not on Nexus, Im usualy active on Nexus, when I\\'m playing Skyrim or Fallout NV, but I play other games as well, so I might not always... be here lol.",
