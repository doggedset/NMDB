  "descriptionHtml": "For some reason, taking items from the first floor of Pinewatch counts as stealing, even though it doesn&#39;t in the rest of the dungeon. In the CK, ownership is marked for one of the bandits, so I removed it, making anything inside the bandit lair up for grabs&#33;\r<br />\r<br />If I&#39;ve missed anything, let me know -- for some reason, the CK doesn&#39;t allow for editing of the ownership of an entire cell, so I had to go through and modify every single object by hand. \r<br />Every.\r<br />Single.\r<br />One.",
