  "descriptionHtml": "Like I said this mod just adds a powerful deadric bow with the chillrend enchantment in the game. It is craftable in any forge and upgradeable in any grindstone you will need 100 gold to craft it. (Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t ask me how they actually build it in real life in the game :) ) You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll also need an ebony ingot to upgrade it. This is my very first weapon mod i ever made and i hope to make more mods (player houses, armor, etc.)",
