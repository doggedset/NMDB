  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"Veterans\\\" are pre-built characters, skilled and equipped in tune with the limitations of their experience. The entire game is unexplored, and adapted to your new level allowing you to try out advanced play-styles and quest-lines without the hours of involved preliminaries.\r\n\r\nRender the Male Wood-Elf Champion\r\nor Raster, a Female Wood-Elf Champion\r\n\r\nRender is a level 30 combat specialist built for sustained damage output and high survivability in Skyrim\\'s sometimes lengthy battles. Using Paralyze judiciously to render opponents helpless, he finishes them off with a few arrows if at range, or with a snicker-snack of dual-swords when in close-quarters. Render vanquishes his foes by staying in constant motion himself as he freezes opponents motionless around him. He divides & conquers groups of opponents, running & dodging, sniping & paralyzing until the odds favor a quick one-on-one kill. \r\n\r\nRender works well with a folllower and/or a pet. He can provide restorative support to melee types, or hold aggro if his follower uses ranged attacks.\r\n\r\nThere\\'s nothing this Neutral Good Wood Elf enjoys more than dealing serious damage to serious evildoers. Because, when it comes to evildoers, he knows them when he sees them, and when he sees them, look out. Hunters, for example have a point--it\\'s not like their poaching is harming anyone. The same cannot be said of bandits or of those engaged in senseless violence, however. Where ever in Skyrim there is a citizen in distress, Render is determined to find them and save the day.\r\n\r\nRender has 29 unallocated Perk Points, 220 Magicka (+50 Highborn), 220 Health, and 150 Stamina.\r\n\r\nRender\\'s Skills:\r\n\tAlteration 100\r\n\tHeavy Armor, Restoration 75\r\n\tSpeech, One-Handed, Archery 50\r\n\tConjuration, Two-Handed, Destruction, Enchanting, Alchemy, Smithing, Light Armor, Pickpocket, Lockpicking, Block, Sneak, Illusion 15\r\n\r\n1*(100*101/2) + 2*(75*76/2) + 3*(50*51/2) + 12*(15*16/2)\r\n=16,015 [url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Total Experience Spent In Skills[/url]\r\n\r\nRender\\'s Starting Spells:\r\n\tMagelight, Detect Life, Telekinesis, Waterbreathing, Detect Dead, Ebonyflesh, Paralyze, Dragonhide, Mass Paralysis, Equilibrium\r\n\tBound Sword, Bound Bow, Conjure Flame Atronach\r\n\tClose Wounds, Greater Ward, Heal Other, Circle of Protection, Grand Healing, Repel Undead, Turn Greater Undead\r\n\t\r\nRender\\'s Shouts:\r\n\tDisarm (Zun Haal Viik)\r\n\tDismay (Faas Ru Maar)\r\n\t\r\nRender\\'s Additional Powers: \r\n\tHighborn (+50 Magicka)\r\n\tHighborn (Regen Magicka Daily)\r\n\t\r\nRender\\'s Champion Equipment:\r\nEbony Helmet of Eminent Restoration\t000cf88a\r\nEbony Armor of Eminent Alteration\t0010cf6c\r\nEbony Gauntlets of Major Wielding\t000cf865\r\nEbony Boots of Extreme Stamina\t0010df85\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRender is based on an original character concept by kbailey921, Thanks so much for the feedback & encouragement!!\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nVersion History\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n2.1 Master Alteration, switch to Heavy Armor, & add equipment. New looks.\r\n2.0 Confused champion, uses light armor...\r\n1.0 Original Version\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhenever a character earns a rank, r, in a skill they gain r experience. So when a character has 0 in all skills they have zero experience, and when they have 100 in all skills, at level 81.5, they have 90,900 experience. A level 30 character should have about 15,865 total experience summed from their skills.\r\n\r\nTaken Veterans should look good with any texture or mesh mods you may use, if any. The mods used in the screenshots include:\r\nFace Textures (Female): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3563]Coverwomen[/url]\r\nFace Textures (Male): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=26]Detailed Faces[/url]\r\n\r\nLook in the discussions area for the batch commands allowing you to make a veteran out of a character you\\'ve created yourself!\r\n\r\nMore Info:\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Experience Table[/url]\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimCharBatch]Tips on making your own veterans[/url]\r\n\r\nDrop a Taken Veteran save game in your Saves folder and load it up.
