  "descriptionHtml": "Head to the Bannered Mare Inn in Whiterun and look for a note at the bar. That will tell you where to go. Consider this an unmarked quest.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod ever made. It\\'s small, but I put effort into it so it wouldn\\'t be lame. The mod gives you a powerful Conjuration spell that lets you summon the Insanity Guard. He follows you around helping you until he is killed. You\\'ll have to do a tiny bit of walking to get this spell, but it\\'s nothing big. I also created a story for the researchers and the Guard to make this lore friendly and not so it would seem as if it was all just randomly thrown into the game. Be warned, if you don\\'t like having powerful allies, then this mod is not for you. The Insanity Guard is hard to take down.\r\n\r\nIf you ever get tired of the guard helping you out, then this is pretty handy: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9879\r\n\r\nI\\'ve tested this thoroughly over and over and there shouldn\\'t be any bugs or glitches.\r\n\r\nComments, critique, and suggestions are much appreciated.",
