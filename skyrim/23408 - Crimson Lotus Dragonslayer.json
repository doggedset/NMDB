  "descriptionHtml": "My first mod. I hope everything works out for you as it did for me. Sword is OP, use at your own discretion. Sword will leave behind the effects of fire, ice, and shock when you hit an enemy. The sword is enchanted with the power of wind to increase the strike speed. \r<br />\r<br />The lost Third-Era Akaviri katana of the Blades holds the power of Fire, Ice, and Lightning. Hidden during the destruction of Sky Haven Temple, time has revealed the sword to be used by the last Dragonborn. Located in the decayed tree stump at the exterior of Sky Haven Temple. Sword emits a fire wind sound when you get close.\r<br />\r<br />Sword is enchanted to deal ALOT of damage to dragons. Recommended to use with DeadlyDragons mod to make it balanced.\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3829 \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Enchantment details:\r<br />100 dmg to dragons\r<br />Paralyze + ice effect\r<br />Health/magicka dmg to dragons + shock effect\r<br />Absorb health + fire effect\r<br />Sword has the wind effect of Elemental Fury and is faster to swing than a normal sword. (Slightly slower than an unenchanted weapon buffed by the Elemental Fury shout).\r<br />\r<br />*NOTE: Elemental Fury effect currently has a bug where if you switch weapons or spells to quickly it can sometimes glitch the sound and there is permanent &#34;woosh&#34; sounds. Be sure to sheath the sword or weapon first, than switch to spells or another weapon. Don&#39;t spam. This affects all weapons that have the elemental fury effect. It&#39;s a Bethesda bug. I just wanted to warn you guys first.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE:\r<br />Version 2.0 fixes the wind sound bug(sound of wind blowing never going away). The bug is a result of any enchantment that has sound attached to it can become stuck if you switch weapons too quickly. As a result, version 2.0 has the enchantment fx changed to have a similar glow and trail as &#34;Bound Sword&#34;. I&#39;ve left version 1.0 and 1.1 up in case some people enjoy the wind effect. To avoid the bug, be sure you sheathe the sword before you switch to another weapon or spell. If you notice the sound not going away, the only fix is to reload a previous save before it happened. Not a bug of the mod, but a bug from the game itself. \r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />File credits\r<br />Dragonbone Weapons - AeonVita : The Model/texture/mesh were from his mod.\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1935\r<br />747823 - For letting anyone use resources from his mod Weapons of the Third Era.\r<br />thewingedloke - I think Aeon made the runes from his mod.\r<br />Bethesda Game Studios - For making Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r<br />\r<br />Again all credits to the people Aeon used to create the awesome katana model.
