  "summary": "&#34;Fortify&#34; enchantments no longer stack with themselves.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This small mod makes the following simple changes to enchantments:\r<br />\r<br />1. &#34;Fortify&#34; enchantments on gear no longer stack. If you equip two Fortify Archery items, only the strongest will have any effect. No more free spells. No more 150% extra damage from weapons.\r<br />2. Fortify enchantments no longer scale with Fortify Restoration potions. (This is the same change as that from the Unofficial patch.)\r<br />3. Robes now increase the [i]effectiveness[/i] of spells (similar to potions), while all other Fortify (Magic School) items decrease the Magicka cost (as in the base game). For example a Robe of Peerless Alteration makes Alteration spells last 25% longer.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.2:\r<br />1. Improved compatibility with mods that use custom magic effects but vanilla keywords (e.g. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16438/]Dragten&#39;s Bandoliers[/url]).\r<br />2. The Muffle effect no longer benefits from restoration potions, no longer stacks with itself, and custom Muffle enchantments only provide a 50% benefit (as was clearly originally intended) rather than 100%.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1:\r<br />1. Offensive enchantments on weapons are no longer affected by Fortify (Magic Skill) potions. (Staves still benefit.)\r<br />2. Implemented one minor bugfix affecting the Amulet of Articulation enchantment.\r<br />\r<br />If you want your offensive enchantments to be affected by Fortify potions, you can safely continue to use version 1.0.\r<br />\r<br />The only bug in 1.0 is that the Amulet of Articulation will have a Fortify Barter enchantment instead of a Fortify Persuasion enchantment, which also means that its benefit will stack with other Fortify Barter enchantments but not with Fortify Persuasion enchantments. Short version: Don&#39;t wear the Amulet of Articulation with other Fortify Barter/Persuasion items or minor weirdness may ensue.",
