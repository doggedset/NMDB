  "descriptionHtml": "Most skills in Skyrim have perk 5-ranked perks that just improve the skill by 20% for every point you invest in them. That\\'s a pretty dull thing to put a point in, but to keep up with your numbers, you have to take them.\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t like that, so I decided to change things a bit. All the \\\"20% better\\\" perks have been replaced with a flat 33% increase, along with skill factors going up by 50%. You can\\'t quite max out the efficiency to the same level as originally, but you get pretty close.\r\n\r\nWeapon and armor skills have a 50% increase and no change in skill factors.\r\n\r\nI really didn\\'t know what to do with Haggling perk, so that was left unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe mod works with existing characters, but you do not get your perks back, if you had taken something with several ranks that has now only one. You\\'ll have to use the console to add yourself the perks you missed out.\r\n\r\nThanks to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14783]TardOnPC[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14244]jack254[/url] and their respective mods for inspiring me to do my own solution.",
