She is a follower of the Ningheim race, she is essential and you can also marry her. \r<br />\r<br />She will level alongside the player and she favours the bow. She has got her glassbow that she inherited after her father died. (Yes this is a failed attempt at a beginning for a backstory for miss Alexa)\r<br />\r<br />She also should not set off traps while you are sneaking.\r<br />\r<br />Her default clothes are FineClothes01 (the blue and white ones, with the fur) and her armour (that you can take away from her) is the Studded armour.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/gpGERW][img]https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3682/10113566136_188cda3336_m.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />There are two version to chose from:\r<br />Alexa Daeres: She will wait for you in The Bannered Mare in Whiterun\r<br />Alexa Daeres Alternative: You will find her in the Moorside Inn in Morthal.\r<br />Choose only one.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/gpvWAG][img]https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5451/10111472844_cf74c41e5a_m.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />She will be waiting for you somewhere inside The Bannered Mare in Whiterun or Moorside Inn in Morthal, depending on which version you downloaded.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/gpwEMV][img]https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7296/10111614783_94d4ee0d87_m.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />Skyrim version 1.9.32.0.8 or higher\r<br />The Ningheim Race and its requirements: SKSE, RaceCompatibility, Ningheim Brows package (although it works fine without SKSE).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/gpwdSv][img]https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2863/10111527585_0962f91ff1_m.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />Download and install with NMM or manually download and unpack the file to a location of your choice, and then copy the &#34;Data&#34; map into your Skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/gpwdRD][img]https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3725/10111527535_58515422ee_m.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />Uninstall with NMM or manually by deleting these files:\r<br />AlexaDaeres.esp\r<br />000012C4.dds\r<br />00000D62.tga\r<br />000012C4.nif\r<br />\r<br />In the following locations:\r<br />Skyrim/Data/AlexaDaeres.esp\r<br />Skyrim/Data/textures/actors/Character/FaceGenData/FaceTint/AlexaDaeres.esp00012C4.dds\r<br />SkyrimDatatexturesactorsCharacter/FaceGenData/FaceTint/AlexaDaeres.esp0000D62.tga\r<br />Skyrim/Data/Meshes/actors/Character/FaceGenData/FaceGeom/AlexaDaeres.esp00012C4.nif\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/gpy3DP][img]https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5499/10111883433_3e00c74c8e_m.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />I think she will have the CBBE body since I have the CBBE version of Ningheim installed on my computer, but I&#39;m not certain.\r<br />\r<br />Also, this is my first mod and I almost don&#39;t have any knowledge at all about how to make mods an so on, so I might not be able to provide support should there be any issues, although I will try my best of course. :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/gpwdTc][img]https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2840/10111527625_cbb2f97a11_m.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />Cred goes out to:\r<br />Seren4XX, HelloSanta, Urshi and co for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35474//?]The Ningheim Race[/url]\r<br />Seren4XX for being very helpful through PM&#39;s and for writing the helpful article &#34;How to create your own Custom Race follower(s) - Tutorial based on The Ningheim&#34;\r<br />TMPhoenix for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24168/?]RaceCompatibility[/url]",
