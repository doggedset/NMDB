  "summary": "Gives you the ability to \\\"throw\\\" equipped daggers at your opponents with a keypress.  In reality it consumes the dagger and fires an arrow (which disappears on impact) but it is still fun and useful.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Finally a use for those thousands of daggers you made to become a master smith!  If you equip one in your right hand, you can press \\\"G\\\" to throw it.  In reality, this consumes the dagger and fires an arrow (which disappears on impact) but it is visually convincing and fun enough that I felt I should release it.\r\n\r\nThrowing a dagger increases your One Handed and Archery skills, and causes you to automatically equip a new one if you have more.\r\n\r\nThe throw key and skill increases can be configured by editing throwDaggers.ini.\r\n\r\nNow you can throw any kind of dagger, although be warned -- all daggers fire the same projectile, so damage increases are minimal (if anything).\r\n\r\n[u]-Requirements-[/u]\r\nRequires Script Dragon, found here: http://alexander.sannybuilder.com/?category=other&altname=skyrim_script_dragon\r\n\r\n[u]-Installation-[/u]\r\n1. Install Script Dragon from the above link.\r\n2. Place throwDaggers.asi and throwDaggers.ini into the skyrim/asi folder. If you don\\'t have one, make one.\r\n\r\n[u]-Uninstalling-[/u]\r\nDelete throwDaggers.asi.\r\n\r\n[u]-Changelog-[/u]\r\n0.2 - added ability to throw any dagger.  Removed ability to throw daggers while in menus.  Added One-handed skill increase, and skill increase configurability.\r\n\r\n[u]-Credit-[/u]\r\nThanks to Alexander Blade for Script Dragon. ",
