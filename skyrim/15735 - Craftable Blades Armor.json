  "modName": "Craftable Blades Armor",
  "summary": "Adds Inosite / xwinchy\\'s blades armor retexture as a standalone, craftable armor.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will let the player craft Blades Armor items at either the Skyforge or Sky Haven Temple (depending on the file selected). The crafted items are standalone & do not interfere with the originals.\r\nThe idea was intended to let the original Blades armor represent the forging skills & styles of the time, while the newly crafted armor is intended to look newer & perform a bit better. The armor is slightly stronger & slightly lighter to represent new armor made with more modern techniques.\r\nThe original armor cannot be forged, and I have classed the original items as old. I have also modified the blades outfit so that new recuits get the new items, while Delphine retains her old armor.\r\n\r\nThe blades sword can also be forged, and is renamed to \\\"Akaviri Katana\\\". The sword is the original version for now until I can get permission for some new textures.\r\n\r\nAll new & old items can be improved normally.\r\n\r\nFull permission has been given for the re-use of the textures.\r\n\r\nThe Sky Haven Temple version modifies that interior cell & so will conflict with other mods which do so. Therefore if you are using such a mod, download the Skyforge version.\r\n\r\n1.2 updates the shield to be available for vampire races.",
