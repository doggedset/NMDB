  "descriptionHtml": "Adds 5 custom Absorb Health spells to the game (Novice-Master), that function as instant ranged touch attacks, and apply a 4 sec life-leeching DOT to targets.  Also increases Destruction skill with usage.\r\n\r\nThis is part of what is going to be a larger \\\"Improved Necro\\\" pack I\\'m planning.  Which will eventually include: actual undead summoning spells, poison and curse spells, and (hopefully) a custom skill tree that incorporates them all.\r\nSpells can be purchased from Farengar in Dragons Reach.\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP, I have finals all next week, so I won\\'t have time to work any more on it until after the Holidays most likely.  So I figured I would at least throw this version up.\r\n\r\nA note on balance:  I\\'ve only ever played the game on Expert/Master, so that is what the mod is \\\"balanced\\\" around.  Also I didn\\'t take excessive fortify destruction enchants into consideration.  For the same reason that I don\\'t balance around the games easy settings, I don\\'t have any interest in releasing a separate version for people who like to run around casting Expert level spells for 0 magica.",
