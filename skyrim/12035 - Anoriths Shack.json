  "descriptionHtml": "[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/sSbds.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52612/?]Real Shelter[/url] Patch available&#33; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76368/?]Found here[/url]. Many thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/13953925/?]kojak747[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[size=16]Anorith&#39;s Shack[/size]\r<br />\r<br />I originally created this for one of my roleplaying characters that I&#39;d set with some restrictions and a small backstory. The mod is named after her, although the shack in-game is not.\r<br />You will find the Old Hunting Shack on the shores of Lake Ilinalta across from Half-Moon Mill. it contains basic necessities for a hunter in the shack and the unlockable grotto is a bit more fancier. The grotto is locked with the tribute chest key that you receive at the end of the Thieves Guild questline. This is to prevent some visual spoilers&#33;\r<br />\r<br />For Clarification on the Grotto:\r<br />The grotto is key locked, the only way to access this without cheating is to complete the Thieves Guild Storyline completely. The Key required is not a custom key, even if you have already completed the Thieves Guild Quest prior to this mod, you will still have this key. The main reason for the lock is a particular statue that I used inside the cave that you encounter in the Thieve Guild Storyline. I didn&#39;t want to ruin the awe inspiring sight of this particular statue when you see it in the quest. If you wish to ruin that, you can use the console to unlock the trapdoor. The secondary reason is that not all things should be free. :P The shack above is of course free to use as you wish.\r<br />\r<br />[b]V1.1: Many Thanks to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1969161]Grimulkan[/url] for figuring out the Navmesh problem&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]The Shack contains:[/b]\r<br />Containers\r<br />A bed\r<br />Cooking pot\r<br />Alchemy station\r<br />Chopping block\r<br />Tanning rack\r<br />Small garden\r<br />\r<br />[b]The Grotto Contains:[/b]\r<br />Forge\r<br />Enchantment table\r<br />2 bedrolls\r<br />Fish\r<br />Cooking pot\r<br />Desk\r<br />Bookcase (containers like the ones in the College of Winterhold)\r<br />2 Mannequins\r<br />Weapon Rack \r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\r<br />It&#39;s best to use the Nexus Mod Manager to download and activate this.\r<br />[b]\r<br />Manual Installation:[/b]\r<br />Unzip the file and plop AnorithsShack.esp into the data folder in your Skyrim directory. Activate it in the launcher.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Updating:[/b]\r<br />If you are updating from a previous version, play it safe and take everything out of the containers. You&#39;ve been warned&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve tested this as much as I possibly can and fixed up all the bugs I could find. The water in the grotto sometimes acts weird (makes you fall a bit), but that&#39;s something to do with the game itself and I do not know how to fix that. Mannequins will sometimes change position as if they are alive, exiting and re-entering usually fixes this up. This will most likely conflict with anything in the same location. \r<br />\r<br />[b]My Screenshots:[/b]\r<br />I&#39;ve noticed that some people were interested in what I was using to make my screenshots so nice. I am using a combination of .ini tweaks for the shadows, the AO setting in the Nvidia controller and an excellent ENB preset called [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4142]CLENB - Cinematic lighting[/url]. I can only point you to a forum thread that I found extremely helpful in tweaking my .ini, the rest is up to you.
