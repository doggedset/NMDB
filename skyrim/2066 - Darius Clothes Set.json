  "descriptionHtml": "sorry for all the people have viewed my file... i left my pc uploading this file and went to school.. and when i came back, i found some site error displayed on the screen, meaning i failed to upload ... so my sincere apology...\r\n\r\nGENERAL\r\ni just want my character look more special..so i make this mod. since the ck is not available, \r\ni do this mod quite dirty i think...for some reasons, the jarl\\'s gloves (the one jarl of \r\nwinterhold wears) are not what they used to look, they looks exactly the same as the gloves of \r\njarl of whiterun, and so do the chef\\'s clothes, which look exactly the same as the barkeeper\\'s \r\nclothes. i did this because i don\\'t want some npc wear the same clothes as me..and without the \r\nck, it\\'s impossible to use my own meshes, so the only thing i can do is to overwrite the \r\nexisting meshes..so i don\\'t know..if you happen to like my mod and want the changed clothes \r\nback.. you can leave a comment and i will make another version.  \r\n\r\nthere is one other thing.. the file i intend to upload have some compatibility problem with other mods that modify the body texture, so i change the clothes a bit..\r\nthe first 3 images show the latter version, and the last one is what i intend to do ..\r\n\r\nTO INSTALL\r\nunpack the rar file and drag everything into your data folder.\r\n\r\nTO GAIN\r\nuse console to obtain the items...\r\ndarius\\' shirt: player.additem 0x0000d0 1\r\ndarius\\' gloves: player.additem 0x0000d1 1\r\ndarius\\' boots: player.additem 0x0000d2 1\r\nnote that x depends on the loading sequence of the mods.. so you can try 000000d0,010000d0, 020000d0 and so on....\r\nor you can use console command:  help darius 4 to obtain the formid..\r\n\r\n\r\nTO UNINSTALL\r\njust delete the file\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\nthe armor rating of the gloves is not 0, but the mage\\'s armor perk still works.. i donno why... in fact, the gloves of the winterhold jarl have the same issue... and this set is created for mage if enchanted properly.. my darius is a mage..",
