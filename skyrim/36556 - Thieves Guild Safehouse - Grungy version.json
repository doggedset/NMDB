  "descriptionHtml": "**************************************\r\nUpdated, July 15th, 2013\r\n\r\nFixed the container respawn issue, all containers should be working properly.  I also included some cosmetic changes based on suggestions and stuff that was bothering me.  The abandoned part is much darker now, for instance.  I redid the lighting, hopefully it still looks fine.  And I tweaked some other stuff, too.  Sorry for the delay getting that out, if you still have any issues or suggestions please let me know.\r\n\r\n**************************************\r\n\r\nLocated north and east of Rorikstead, near the Talking Stone Camp, the safehouse is a small but functional lore friendly home that is hidden in the basement beneath an abandoned shack on a hill among the trees. It can provide players with a house or waystation located in the western part of Tamriel, convenient to Solitude, Morthal, and Markarth.  It makes a great safehouse for the Thieves Guild.\r\n\r\nIncludes:\r\n\r\nInside:\r\nSeveral chests and other containers\r\nCooking Pot\r\n2 Beds + 1 Bedroll\r\nAlchemy Table\r\nEnchanting Table\r\n3 Weapon Plaques\r\n2 Mannequins\r\nTanning rack\r\nSharpening wheel\r\nArmor table\r\nBlacksmith Forge\r\n\r\nOutside:\r\nWoodchopping Block\r\n\r\nNot compatible with the Clean version of this mod (check it out here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36492/ )\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\nTo do list, as of July 15th\r\n\r\nExterior navmesh is weird (Front part of house seems to be across a zone-dividing line that cannot connect the front door to the rest of the navmesh.  Not sure if there\\'s a workaround.)\r\n",
