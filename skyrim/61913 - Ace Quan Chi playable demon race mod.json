  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][b][img]http://press-start.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/quan-chi.jpg[/img]\r<br />Personal/Unrelated:[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />A year and a half ago I set out to make a custom follower mod, fully voiced, spells, amour,weapons with short quests and some quest/location awareness all based around Quan Chi. I did most of the work but I couldn&#39;t find a reliable voice actor to help out. I left that project to die until someone, some how found my hidden video on Youtube that was meant for voice actors. He requested that I release the resources so he could find someone to make a race mod out of it or he would compensate me for my work. Long story short, I just offered to make it for him free of charge. I didn&#39;t want ALL my work to go to waste so I didn&#39;t see why I couldn&#39;t make this for him and share it on Nexus.\r<br />[color=#00ff00][u][b][size=6]\r<br />Short Description:[/size][/b][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Play as Quan Chi from the Mortal Kombat games by Netherrealm Studios.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff00ff][u][b][size=6]Description/Info:[/size][/b][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Read about Quan Chi here:\r<br />http://mortalkombat.wikia.com/wiki/Quan_Chi\r<br />\r<br />Race description:\r<br />\r<br />The Oni are a vicious race of demonic beings that inhabit the Netherrealm. An Oni can transcend into a Demon with their mastery over sorcery. \r<br />Demons are great spellswords, they favour illusion but excel in most spell schools as well as one handed weapons.\r<br />\r<br />Starting Spells: I tried to replicate most of the spells from Mortal Kombat 9.\r<br />\r<br />Trance: Put the enemy into a trance. The target will walk towards the area of the caster when cast completely unaware of the battle at hand.\r<br />Skull Attack: Shoot a glowing green skull at the target to take X damage.\r<br />Rune Trap: Cast a rune that will heavily stagger the target.\r<br />Quick Health: Recharge your health for a short period.\r<br />Boost One Handed: Boost your one handed skill for a short period.\r<br />\r<br />Starting Stats:\r<br />\r<br />Conjuration:5\r<br />Illusion:10\r<br />Destruction:5\r<br />One Handed:5\r<br />Light Armour:5\r<br />Restoration:5\r<br />\r<br />Misc:\r<br />18 unarmed damage\r<br />Heath regen: 1\r<br />Magicka regen: 4\r<br />Stamina regen: 4\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Other/bugs/help:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />For some reason rings and amulets don&#39;t show on the character(it could just be my game since I have 100+ mods). \r<br />The head markings shine/glare for some reason. In my old mod I figured out how to fix that problem but it&#39;s been a while and I can&#39;t figure it out.\r<br />As with most custom race mods, if you plan to use a transformation you&#39;ll most likely need a mod that will revert you properly.\r<br />If you&#39;re good with descriptions feel free to drop a comment. \r<br />I recommend using RaceMenu mod. If you manage to make Quan Chi look much closer than I did with the CK editor, send the preset to me and I&#39;ll update the mod and use your images. Credit where it&#39;s due, of course.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0:\r<br />Released.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you like class and build related mods, check my other mods out&#33;[size=1]\r<br />[/size]",
