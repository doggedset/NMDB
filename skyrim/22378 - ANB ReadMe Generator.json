Its just here to provide an easy link to anyone looking for such a tool on the nexus.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.deadlyheadstudios.com/readmegen/readmegen.html\r\n\r\nVery simple website so you can fill in forms for info about your mod and then generate a decent looking readme file. No downloads, no exes, no worrying about virus or spyware, just a simple webapp for quick results.\r\n\r\nFill in the info and hit Go! and your readme file will be generated and opened in a new window (be sure to allow it if its blocked) All you have to do is copy the generated text into your readme file and save it!\r\n\r\nIts simple to use. Almost every section is optional and enabled by default. Uncheck the sections you dont want to include, fill in the rest and thats it.\r\n\r\nIncludes every section I could think of. If its missing any I can always add em!",
