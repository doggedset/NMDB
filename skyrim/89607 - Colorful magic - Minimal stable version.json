  "descriptionHtml": "[quote][/quote]Incompatible with Perkus Maximus, DON'T USE THE PATCHER ON THIS MOD\n<br />(move the .esp out before running the skyproc patcher)\n<br />\n<br />Quote of the Author:\n<br />\n<br />[b][quote]I can not update MODs anymore.\n<br />and, I do not have a special edition, I cannot support you.\n<br />\n<br />If you remodel my MODs and want to show it,\n<br />You do not need my permission. Please use it freely.\n<br />But ColorfulMagic uses a resource of other MOD a lot so many.\n<br />Please write all credit.[/quote][/b]\n<br />\n<br />I tested all the spells in the mod and deleted all spell books of ridiculous and unstable spells.\n<br />I also removed most weapons because the power attack mechanics seemed to crash the game sometimes too.\n<br />Of course i checked all references so the summoned monsters should still have their weapons.\n<br />I didn't remove any of the armors though.\n<br />Now there are around 120 spells left in the mod.\n<br />This is the \"less powerful, whiterun\" version, so the traders are found in arcadia's cauldron.\n<br />\n<br />If anybody wants to help me making this mod more stable, contact me so i can add you as author or feel free to publish your own version.",
