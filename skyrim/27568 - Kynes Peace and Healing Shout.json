  "modName": "Kynes Peace and Healing Shout",
  "summary": "This mod changes only the Kynes Peace shout.  It adds a health/stamina restore effect to the shout and adjusts the shout timer for balance purposes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very basic mod that turns Kynes Peace (a shout I never used more than a couple times in my over 400 hours of playing) into a restoration shout.\r<br />\r<br />I decided to make this mod because I am playing a character that I would prefer to not use potions or magic for my healing purposes.  I also chose to modify Kyne&#39;s peace because I think it balances my game to require spending the dragon souls to acquire a healing shout, and also gives more use to the shout itself.\r<br />\r<br />The shout was modified as follows:\r<br />\r<br />1st word - 20 second cooldown.    90 health and 40 stamina restored\r<br />\r<br />2nd word - 30 second cooldown.  120 health and 70 stamina restored\r<br />\r<br />3rd word - 40 second cooldown.  200 health and 300 stamina restored\r<br />\r<br />The shout description was modified to: &#34;Your voice soothes wild beasts while restoring health and stamina.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />The spells changed to modify the shouts are:\r<br />\r<br />VoiceKynesPeace1\r<br />VoiceKynesPeace2\r<br />VoiceKynesPeace3\r<br />\r<br />The only modification done to these spells was an addition of 2 existing magic effects:\r<br />\r<br />AlchRestoreHealth\r<br />AlchRestoreStamina\r<br />\r<br />No scripts are added to the game, no items or characters are added to the game.\r<br />\r<br />This shout modifier should be compatible with other shout mods, just make sure it is loaded after your other shout mods.",
