  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][size=\\'4\\']The Legacy of Golden Axe\r\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=[/size][/b][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod adds 6 save files for the 5 player characters from the Golden Axe 1, 2, 3. Plus the mighty Death Adder!!!\r\n\r\n[b]Introduction:[/b] The evil Death Adder has risen from the dead and has began to rise to power. Using an ancient ritual, he has thwarted the only Heros with the skill and power to stop him. Transporting his old enemies into another land. This is their story:\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Optional File:[/b] 6 Batch files i used to create the characters and to try and keep them balanced with each other. Called \\\"Ax\\\", \\\"Gilius\\\", \\\"Tyris\\\", \\\"Chronos\\\", \\\"Proud\\\" and \\\"DeathAdder\\\" \r\n\r\n[b]Optional File:[/b] Custom Re-textures of Tsun, Iron, Forsworn and Ancient Nord Armor.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve tried my best to keep them to the original Style and look of the games while using the resources available in Skyrim. however, as an optional file i have included the 6 batch files i used to create them. Feel free to change the aesthetics if my attempts are not to your liking. The batch files remove (almost all) of the racial bonuses and re-adjust starting skills. (Base level for skills is 15, each race then adds a combined 35 onto this)\r\n\r\nDeath Adder is the exception to this. I just went wild. But he is the end boss so i think it\\'s justified.\r\n\r\nShould you find the characters [b]TOO[/b] powerful, use the console command below to increase your character level (by ONE) without any of the associated perks or health/stamina/magicka gains. This will effectively increase the level of all enemies met while leaving you the same.\r\n\r\n[center][size=\\\"3\\\"][b]player.advlevel[/b][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Usage:[/b] Unzip saves and place in your C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\<USERNAME>\\\\My Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves. Load the game and a save. Enjoy.\r\n\r\n[b]Usage of Optional File:[/b] Unzip files and place in your C:\\\\steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim folder. In-game, open the console and type [b]bat NAME[/b] where NAME is the first name of the character.\r\n\r\n[b]Required Mods:[/b]\r\n[url=3556]\\\"True Barbarian Armor\\\"[/url] by rahman530 (Iron Armor Replacer version)\r\n[url=2822]\\\"Prometheus Capes\\\"[/url] by Prometheus (Amulet version)\r\n\r\n[b]Recommended Mods:[/b]\r\n[url=3320]\\\"Skimpy and Super Skimpy Forsworn Armor Using CBBE\\\"[/url] by Killer Keo   -   (skimpy version works best for Tyris)\r\n[url=2666]\\\"Calientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE-\\\"[/url] by Calient   -   (because Tyris is a curvaceous woman)\r\n[url=562]\\\"No Helmet Mod\\\"[/url] by vuradic   -   (because it\\'s awesome, why spend all that time working on your face, only to cover it with a helmet?)\r\n[url=563]\\\"Athletic Nude Women - CBBE\\\"[/url] by Valstein0   -   (Because Tyris is an athletic, fighting woman.

By using the power of the legendary Golden Axe, He imprisoned the king and his daughter, unleashing his horde of minions to enslave all people from Yuria, making him their evil ruler. Many villages were pillaged and all who opposed him were slain in cold-blood. Three heroes put an end to Death Adder\\'s evil reign. They were Ax, Tyris, and Gillius. Together, they traveled the lands of Yuria, fighting Death Adder\\'s minions. They invaded Death Adder\\'s castle, where they face the giant in battle. Death Adder was defeated, and many believed he was dead.\r\n\r\nYears later, when people was living at peace again, Death Adder emerged from the darkness, along with his castle, spreading chaos and destruction again. This time, Death Adder wanted revenge. Four new heroes stood against his forces, fighting their way after the evil giant. They invade his castle by flying in the back of a dragon, and face Death Adder, defeating him again. However, as they were fleeing the crumbling castle in the dragon, Death Adder ambushes them, in an attempt to kill all of them at once. Gillius, who was along with them, uses the Golden Axe and hits Death Adder in the head, but they both fall from the dragon. Gillius and Death Adder were both believed dead, and the Golden Axe Lost.\r\n\r\nBut he has risen again...\r\n\r\nDeath Adder is a master Necromancer, able to raise powerful beings from the dead and enslave them into his power. His size and strength makes him a powerful adversary in armed combat. and his offensive magical abilities are limited although very powerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b]=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=\\'3\\'] Author\\'s Note [/size][/b]\r\n[b][size=\\'3\\'] =-=-=-=-=-=-=-= [/size][/b][/center]\r\n\r\nI\\'ve tried to make it so that everyone in balanced (compared to each other, not against a lvl 1 character) To that end:\r\n\r\nGilius has lots of stamina, decent health and poor magic. His perks are done so that he relies on his axe for damage and gets the best overall protection from his heavy armor.\r\n\r\nTyris has poor health and stamina, but great magical abilities and a little protection from her armor and weak damage from her sword.\r\n\r\nAx, as always, is somewhere between them both. high-ish health (he\\'s a big man), average stamina, average weapon damage, average magic and magicka, average armor protection.\r\n\r\nChronos had to be changed a bit from his appearance in Golden Axe 3. His claws should do decent damage and i gave him stealth abilities because panthers are stealth hunters. I also gave him archery for long range damage and very high stamina so he can sprint for extended periods of time.\r\n\r\nProud, being a giant, has high health and high damage output with his hammer. I would have given him the weapon \\'giants club\\' but the weapons scale with the characters and it just looked stupidly large. But if anyone knows of a crude looking club, let me know. I also reduced his shout recovery time to give him something akin to a range attack.\r\n\r\nDeath Adder is another story all together. he is the largest by far. Does good damage with his axe, has a few powerful spells (think Death Bringer from the Genisis/MegaDrive port). He also has all the undead conjuring spells (since Golden Axe games have quite a few skeleton warriors in it, i figure it must be Death Adder raising them from the grave). I also took it a step further and killed the first 2 Stormcloaks you meet and raised them as Dead Thralls. He can\\'t summon Daedra though. Necromancy only. However, his evil power does allow him to control Daedra. Plus he is the only save that doesn\\'t have an \\'extra life\\' (Avoid Death perk). The 5 other characters do. And no-one should be hindered by armor since they all have the relevent perk in Light or Heavy Armor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b]=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=[/b][/center]",
