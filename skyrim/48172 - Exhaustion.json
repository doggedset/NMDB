Load order doesn&#39;t matter.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#888888][size=4]Overview:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This is a simple mod that plays audible breaths from your character when your health/stamina/magicka drops below a certain percentage. The rate at which you breathe increases as your health/stamina/magicka drops. This is a player-only effect with male or female sound effects automatically set depending on your sex.\r<br />\r<br />By default, once your health and/or stamina drops below 50%, the breaths will trigger. To better suit your playstyle and/or gameplay mod selection, you can configure which resources (health/stamina/magicka) trigger the breaths, the percentage at which they will trigger and the volume. Configuration requires [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3863]SkyUI[/url] but they are not required to run the mod at default settings. There are no plans to sync the breathing with Wet and Cold&#39;s breath effect.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#888888][size=4]Install:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Manual installers drop the files into your Data folder. NMM/BAIN: download the main file and add to your respective programs.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#888888][size=4]Update:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod automatically refreshes itself with each revision. Just remove the previous version and install the new version.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#888888][size=4]Uninstall:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Remove all installed files.",
