  "summary": "Allows you to be both a vampire and a werewolf without adding special items, abilities, or races. Comes in both Dawnguard and non-Dawnguard versions.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]No Longer supported. There are now multiple mods that do the same thing, but do it better[/size] [size=4]and with more compatibility[/size] [size=4]with popular werewolf and vampire mods.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod allows you to be both a vampire and a werewolf without adding anything. This mod came about since I wanted to complete both the Companions and the Dawnguard vampire quest lines without having to lose the abilities I gained through them. Every mod that I found that allowed this, however, achieved the result through equipping a special item, becoming a vampire/werewolf in a specific order,  adding some overpowered/ugly hybrid race, or wasn&#39;t Dawnguard compatible.\r<br />\r<br />In the Dawnguard version, the order you become a vampire/werewolf does NOT matter. In the non-Dawnguard version, however, you MUST become a vampire first. This is because the werewolf beast blood will not allow you to contract Sanguinare Vampiris.\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------\r<br />Known Issues\r<br />-----------------------------------------\r<br />&bull;There will be 2 versions of &#34;100% disease resist&#34; in your active effects tab. One from becoming a vampire and the other from becoming a werewolf. This didn&#39;t seem like that big of a deal, so I left it in.\r<br />\r<br />&bull;When revisiting an area in which you fed on a corpse as a werewolf, you may gain additional progress toward a werewolf perk, even if you aren&#39;t in werewolf form. I have no idea why this happens, but it seems the feed effect doesn&#39;t get removed when actors are reset. I&#39;m fairly certain this only applies to Dawnguard version, but I&#39;m not positive.\r<br />\r<br />&bull;While testing I ran into a bug where the player would be frozen in place if they were caught feeding, and commands such as &#34;enableplayercontrols&#34; had no effect at fixing it. It didn&#39;t happen all the time either, but it would ONLY happen if I was caught. At first I thought this was the result of my mod, but after research, it seems this is an issue with Dawnguard. I tested feeding with a clean save and it still happened, but I&#39;m not sure if this mod makes it more likely to happen or not. Not my video, but exactly the same issue:\r<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCK4dIks7O4\r<br />If you run into this problem, feeding again or loading an earlier save will fix it.\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------\r<br />Incompatibilities\r<br />-----------------------------------------\r<br />This mod will be incompatible with any mod that alters the following scripts. The Dawnguard version contains all of these, and the NonDawnguard version only contains the first 3.\r<br />&bull;C03RampageQuest\r<br />&bull;CompanionHouseKeepingScript\r<br />&bull;PlayerWerewolfChangeScript\r<br />&bull;DLC1VampireTurnScript\r<br />&bull;DLC1LycanthropyRegiftQuestScript\r<br />\r<br />Any vampire or werewolf overhaul is likely to modify these, as they dicate how the game handles progression and transformation of the player.\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------\r<br />Changelog\r<br />-----------------------------------------\r<br />v1.2.1\r<br />&bull;Dawnguard version fix. Removed a line of code that may have been the cause of the removal of the vampire lord power when Aela re-gifted lycanthropy.\r<br />\r<br />v1.2\r<br />&bull;Removed vampire sun weakness while in werewolf form so stamina regenerates. Fire weakness and frost resistance also removed while in werewolf form. Esp re-added for this functionality.\r<br />\r<br />v1.1\r<br />&bull;Fixed bug where player would revert to a non-vampire but keep all the negative effects after a werewolf transformation. This also prevented feeding.\r<br />&bull;Found more scripts that wouldn&#39;t allow you to be both. Edited accordingly.\r<br />&bull;Removed unnecessary .esp files.\r<br />\r<br />v1\r<br />&bull;Initial release.\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------\r<br />My other mods\r<br />-----------------------------------------\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30542] Non-existent npc disabler [/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52596/] Non-existent npc disabler [/url]",
