  "modName": "Slide into something more comfortable (CBBE)",
  "summary": "These are CBBE files for use with bodyslide, I will in future be posting all bodyslide projects (CBBE) to this single page, and a separate page for UUNP files, instead of creating  pages for each outfit/armor on it's own. Streamlining the whole process a bit.",
  "descriptionHtml": "These are CBBE Bodyslide files ONLY, they will not alter the original mod/mods in any way, and that said, you WILL need to download and install the original mod/mods by their various authors to use this, it will NOT work on it's own.\n<br />\n<br />* The first set of files include all four of the original Sorceress Armors ( light and heavy versions) by davjes posted here on the nexus, has full weight slider support, and if you use the proper skeleton and HDT body in bodyslide, you will have all the bounce and jiggles you could ever wish for.
