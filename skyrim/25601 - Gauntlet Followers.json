  "descriptionHtml": "The original characters of the popular Gauntlet arcade series as followers, Wizard, Warrior, Valkyrie, and Elf. The Wizard carries magic staffs and has a very high magica rating, but low strength and health. The Warrior is most powerful at two-handed combat and wields axes. The Valkyrie is excellent at armor and defense and carries swords and shields. The Elf has the best speed and equips bows. Due to a bug in the creation kit in which NPC in the elf races cannot be made into followers in the game, I had to use the Breton race for the Elf. Hopefully I can fix that soon.\r\n\r\nLocations:\r\n\r\nWizard: College of Winterhold in Arch Mage\\'s Quarters\r\nWarrior: Ivarstead in Vilemyr Inn\r\nValkyrie: Solitude in Castle Dour\r\nElf: Riverwood in Sleeping Giant Inn\r\n\r\nIf you encounter any bugs, please report them in the comments section.",
