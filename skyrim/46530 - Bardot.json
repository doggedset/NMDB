  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE:\r\nBardot 1 & 2 are now presets under Nord female in the character creation--it's the last preset. Scroll through the presets until the very end and that is Bardot. .::USE ONLY one .esp::. because they both use the same preset slot!::.  \r\n\r\nMake changes to Bardot anyway you wish, change eye color, hairstyle/color, add warpaint/scars just make her your own (and share a screenie, would love to see your work!). After you have made your character and saved your game, you can remove the .esp file. if you wish. When you first see the preset Bardot will have vanilla hair that you can keep or installed Apachii Hair (link below) for more choices.  ~sunsi~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a preset of my character named, Bardot, a level 1 Nord. I've included screenies that show different hairstyles and colors of hair. If you see a hairstyle and color you like it's easy enough to make the changes through the *console (*see below). Please, if you have a question post it and as always your screenies posted in the IMAGE section are most welcome, thank you.  \r\n \r\nBardot 1 & 2 differ only in the shape of lips, please, look at the screenies to see the difference and pick the one that appeals to you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~Installation~\r\nDrop in your:  C:/Program Files/Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data\r\n\r\n\r\n*You can use the console ingame entering \"Showracemenu\" (without quotation marks) to make changes to Bardot's face.  Be warned though that using \"Showracemenu\" in the console will reset your stats to default so I would recommend checking out this mod which should prevent this. And don't forget to change Bardot's name to your own personal choice! :) \r\n\r\nShowRaceMenu Alternative by Seb263\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20394/? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~Required Mods to Obtain the look seen in my images:\r\nYou must have AppachiiSkyHair installed or Bardot will be either bald or have vanilla hair:\r\n\r\nApachiiSkyHair by Apachii\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/?\r\n\r\nOther highly recommended mods for the face:\r\n\r\nWomen of Skyrim female face texture and COMPANIONS by zzjay\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25588/?\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen of Skyrim-Enhanced female normalmaps by zzjay (this is the normalmap I use--install AFTER, \"Women of Skyrim female face texture and COMPANIONS by zzjay\", and agree to overwrite when asked)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20483/?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eyes Of Beauty by Gabriel Mailhot\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722/?\r\n\r\n\r\nAny other mods are a matter of personal taste such as body mods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~Uninstall~\r\nRemove file from:  C:/Program Files/Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you, for your interesting in my mod, please endorse if you like it, much appreciated.\r\nIf anyone would like to make Bardot into a follower/companion mod you have my permission but please tell me so that I can download her too--I would love to have her as a follower/companion. :)\r\n\r\nContact by PM:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/13927//?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks, to zzjay and her fanatstic work that has allowed me to make such a gorgeous character.
