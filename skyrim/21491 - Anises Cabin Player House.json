  "summary": "Let you claim Anise\\'s Cabin as your home after you kill its previous owner.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[SPOILER]\r\nSouthwest of Riverwood lies Anise\\'s Cabin, home of an old women named well.. Anise.  There\\'s a trapdoor next to her bed who lead to a secret cellar.  You can find a note on a table that reveals Anise\\'s greatest secret...\r\n\r\nWhat my mod do is to remove the ownership on every items inside both the house and the cellar after Anise is killed.  So wait after her death before you take anything because it won\\'t count as stealing anymore!   While you have to kill her to actually own the house, it\\'s still fine for people who wish to role-play a non-evil character because she will atack you as soon as you exit the cellar.  \r\n\r\nThere is two version to choose from : \r\n\r\nAlchemist\\'s Cabin\r\nThe cellar contain an Arcane Enchanter and an Alchemy Lab as well as some more potions and ingredients.  You will also find the Alchemy skill book \\\"Song of the Alchemists\\\" on a shelf inside the house.  \r\n\r\nAssassin\\'s Cabin\r\nThe cellar contain an Alchemy Lab, a prison cell (Who contain a dead prisoner) as well as some more potions and ingredients.  You will also find the Sneak skill book \\\"Legend of Krately House\\\" on a shelf inside the house.  \r\n\r\nExtract the esp to \\\"...Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\\\" Folder\r\nIn the data files section in Skyrim launcher, Tick the box \\\"Alchemist\\'s Cabin.esp\\\".\r\n\r\nIf you like the mod don\\'t forget to endorse the file and leave a comment, its always appreciate!  If you find any bug, just let me know!",
