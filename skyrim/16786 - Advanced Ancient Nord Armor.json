  "descriptionHtml": "-------------\r\nDescription\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nI love the Ancient Nord Armor, but I was disappointed in how weak it is, especially if you do the Companion quest line late in the game. That makes it a bit of a useless reward. So I decided to make a stronger version. This adds Advanced Ancient Nord Armor to the Skyforge smithing recipes, under the Ebony catagory so that it takes advantage of the Ebony smithing perk. It is stronger than Ebony, but not quite as strong as Dragonplate. The chest and helmet textures are touched up a bit as well. The spiral detailing is ebony and most of the rust is removed. I mean, you just smithed it right? Also included is a small temporary fix to the heavy armor Matching Set perk so that ebony armor (and thus this set of armor) get the armor bonus. I\\'ll take that out when Bethesda patches the perk.\r\n\r\nWhat you\\'ll need:\r\n\r\n1. Completed the Companions guild questline.\r\n2. The Skyforge.\r\n3. The Ebony Smithing perk.\r\n4. A completed piece of ancient Nord armor\r\n5. Some ebony ingots.",
