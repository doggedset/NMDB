  "descriptionHtml": "WARNING: [color=orange]READ THE INSTALLATION PROCEDURE[/color] BEFORE USING THIS MOD.\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/16815-1-1358155662.jpg[/IMG]\r\n[size=4]version 2.0[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of PC Exclusive Path series\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14871]PC Exclusive Animation Path[/url] (by xp32)\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16815]PC Exclusive Armor Path - DovahSkiin[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25499]PC Exclusive Voice Path - DovahZul[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Check out the Video section to see this mod in action[/b][/color]\r\n[/center]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee187/Raestloz/News.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[u]Version 2.0 is live! Bringing with it Dragonborn support![/u]\r\nAfter months of work, v2.0 is finally finished, along with Dragonborn support. Now, all official DLCs are supported. You can [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/articles/1311/]read the article here[/url]\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0 of this mod is considered \\\"install and forget\\\". You don\\'t need to mess around with the custom versions unless you want to apply custom skins on them\r\n\r\nNote that version 1.x is officially no longer supported. Dawnguard module is entirely separate from 1.x, so it\\'s still supported\r\n\r\n[u]REMINDER FOR USERS OF VERSION 1.3.1 OR OLDER[/U]:\r\nThis mod comes with 2 meshes, 3 compiled scripts and 3 script sources. The scripts and sources are packed into a BSA, but the meshes are not. This is so users are aware of the meshes\\' location.\r\nIf you\\'re upgrading, please remove these data from your Data folder after upgrading:\r\n\r\nscripts/raestlozarmorchangeplayerscript.pex\r\nscripts/raestlozdisablearmorchangeeffect.pex\r\nscripts/raestlozswitcharmorchangeeffectscript.pex\r\nscripts/source/raestlozarmorchangeplayerscript.psc\r\nscripts/source/raestlozdisablearmorchangeeffect.psc\r\nscripts/source/raestlozswitcharmorchangeeffectscript.psc\r\n\r\nThese loose files will override files contained in the BSA, and will conflict with future scripts. If you absolutely need loose files, always extract them from corresponding BSAs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]Dawnguard module is now version 1.2:[/u]\r\n[b]-New Feature:\r\n~~~Supports bloody prisoner rags and shoes[/b]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee187/Raestloz/description-1.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Lore Explanation[/b] : This mod awakens the latent power of a Dovahkiin that causes any clothing to magickally, permanently transform into one worthy of a Dragonborn when touched\r\n\r\n[b]tl;dr[/b] : your armor will look different from others\\' armor.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee187/Raestloz/why.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThis mod\\'s aim is to allow you to use armor replacers without affecting NPCs\r\n\r\nArmor replacers replace all instances of said armor. This means everybody will also wear that replacement, making yours not special at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee187/Raestloz/how-it-works.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThis mod alters the Outfit and Leveled Item records, causing NPCs to wear the custom version of armors instead, which has different mesh paths from the original armors. This makes the original mesh paths safe for customization without affecting other NPCs. The armors look and behave exactly the same as the original, vanilla ones.\r\n\r\nWhen you acquire one of those custom armors, said armors will be removed and you\\'ll be given the original version instead. This is the \\\"Custom to Vanilla\\\" mode (CtV)\r\n\r\nThere is also the vice versa mode: \\\"Vanilla to Custom\\\". When this mode is active, taking any vanilla armor pieces will instantly convert it into the custom version (the ones worn by enemies)\r\n\r\nThere are two spells that will be given to you when you first install the mod.\r\n\r\n1. Disable Armor Change\r\n- Casting this spell will disable armor changing, so you can safely take and put away armors without fear of it being exchanged with custom/vanilla version. Casting this spell stops the scripts, and is required before uninstalling this mod to prevent save bloating\r\n\r\n2. Switch Armor Change\r\n- Casting this spell switches the mode from CtV to VtC and vice versa. If you\\'ve stopped the scripts by casting \\'Disable Armor Change\\', casting this spell activates CtV mode. You can use this to switch back and forth between modes to maintain custom versions of armor for use by other NPCs such as followers.\r\n\r\nNote that casting this spell will NOT convert items already in your inventory. The conversion will only happen when you TAKE an armor. Not when you put them away, not when you cast the spell, but when you take an item and add them into your inventory. In order to convert items already in your person, you\\'ll have to manually put them away and take them again.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee187/Raestloz/know.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=4]WARNING:\r\nTHIS MOD IS NOT A SIMPLE MAGICAL MOD. IN ORDER TO GET THE EFFECT YOU WANT, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO TINKER WITH CREATION KIT A LOT. YOU\\'LL NEED TO LEARN BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF ARMO AND ARMA RECORDS.\r\n\r\nTHIS MOD DOES NOT INCLUDE THE NECESSARY MESHES. YOU\\'LL HAVE TO EXTRACT THEM YOURSELF. A HOW-TO GUIDE IS PROVIDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Now that that\\'s outta the way:[/u][/size][/b]\r\n1. When you steal an armor, you\\'ll get a legit one instead. If you role-play a thief, keep this in mind.\r\n\r\n2. If you have a custom-enchanted or tempered armor, when you take it it loses the enchantments and quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=4][u]Also, I don\\'t customize these:[/u][/size][/b]\r\n1. Unique -one and only - equipments, for example, Spellbreaker - Not worth the effort. Only you can use \\'em anyway\r\n\r\nNote that I do support some of them (like Ebony Mail). This is because you\\'ll see them worn by others in-game. If in doubt, check the list below and if it\\'s not listed, consider it not redirected\r\n\r\n2. Unplayable armors - like Ulfric\\'s gag or Psijic Robes. You can\\'t get \\'em, why should I duplicate \\'em?\r\n\r\n3. Accessories like circlets and necklaces - just no.\r\n\r\n4. Fetch quest armors like Noster\\'s helmet - for script compatibility. Besides, ain\\'t like you\\'re going to keep \\'em\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=4][u]But I do customize these:[/u][/size][/b]\r\n1. Almost everything: ranging from Iron Armor to Thieves Guild Armor to Beggar\\'s Clothes to Mage Robes. From boots to helmet to shield to hoods. If you can find \\'em out in the wilds, chances are they\\'re supported\r\n\r\n2. Orcish, Argonian and Khajiiti models. No, I\\'m not talking about Orcish Armor. Some armors (usually helmets) have different models for beastfolk and orcs. Don\\'t ask me why, perhaps so that they don\\'t clip with your Khajiiti ears / Argonian hair? (do Argonians even CAN have hair?).\r\n\r\n3. 1st person models and ground models. 1st person models are special models used during first person view, they generally only features the arm/hands without the full body to save on processing power because you can\\'t see them anyway. In official contents, only torso and glove armors have 1st person models. Ground models are the models seen when you highlight an item in your inventory or when you encounter said armor in the open world\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=4][u]Additional Information:[/u][/size][/b]\r\n[b]YOU\\'LL NEED TO EXTRACT ALL THE REQUIRED FILES BY YOURSELF FROM BETHESDA\\'S SKYRIM - MESHES.BSA[/b]\r\n\r\nThis is because all the vanilla models are 240 MiB big total. That much bandwidth can be used for better uses for humanity, even worse because you\\'ve already got the files required right there sitting in your hard drive waiting to be extracted. Rather than wasting Skyrim Nexus\\'s bandwidth quota, you better learn a thing or two about computer and use those 240MiB to download other awesome mods, like Killer Keo\\'s or MAK07\\'s armors.\r\n\r\nExtracting the files can be done with BSAOpt. There is a pictorial guide of how to extract the files required. You can download it from the downloads section under \\\"Miscellanous\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: BLADES SHIELD AND EBONY SHIELD, FOR SOME REASON, ARE LOCATED UNDER \\\"WEAPONS\\\" CATEGORY. SEEING AS EXTRACTING TENS OF MiBS of DATA JUST TO GET 2 250KiB DATA IS NOT WORTH THE EFFORT, I\\'VE INCLUDED THEM FOR CONVENIENCE \r\n\r\nThe supported armor/clothing categories are listed below. Note that this list only accounts the main file. List of supported armor/clothing categories for each extension is available on their respective README.\r\n\r\n-Archmage\r\n-Bandit (in-game Fur Armor)\r\n-Barkeeper\r\n-BeggarClothes (in-game Ragged Clothes)\r\n-Blacksmith\r\n-Blades\r\n-Chef\r\n-Daedric\r\n-DBArmor (in-game Dark Brotherhood Armor)\r\n-Dragonbone (in-game Dragonplate Armor)\r\n-Dragonscale\r\n-Draugr (in-game Ancient Nord Armor)\r\n-Dwarven\r\n-Ebony\r\n-Elven\r\n-Emperor\r\n-Execution Hood\r\n-Falmer\r\n-FarmClothes01 (including Mourner Clothes)\r\n-FarmClothes02\r\n-FarmClothes03\r\n-FarmClothes04\r\n-FineClothes01\r\n-FineClothes02 (excluding Party Outfits)\r\n-Forsworn (including Old Gods\\' Armor)\r\n-GeneralTulius (in-game General Tullius\\' Armor and Penituc Oculatus Armor)\r\n-Glass\r\n-Hide (in-game Hide, Studded, Scaled, Scaled Horn Armor)\r\n-Imperial\r\n-Iron\r\n-Jester (both Jester and Cicero version)\r\n-MageApprentice (Novice and Apprentice Robe)\r\n-MageJourneyman (Master Robe)\r\n-MerchantClothes\r\n-MinerClothes\r\n-Monk (including Vaermina robes)\r\n-Necromancer\r\n-Nightingale\r\n-Nordplate (in-game Steel Plate Armor)\r\n-Orcish\r\n-Prisoner (clothes, rags, and shoes)\r\n-Redguard\r\n-RobeDarkBrotherhood (in-game Dark Brotherhood Robes)\r\n-RobeMythicDawn (in-game Mythic Dawn Robes)\r\n-Sons of Talos (in-game Stormcloak Officer Armor)\r\n-Steel\r\n-Stormcloaks (including guards\\' armors)\r\n-Studded (in-game Leather Armor)\r\n-Thalmor\r\n-ThievesGuild\r\n-Warlock\r\n-WeddingDress\r\n-Wench\r\n-Wolf\r\n-YarlClothes\r\n-YarlClothes02\r\n-YarlClothes03\r\n\r\n[img]http://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee187/Raestloz/installation.jpg[/img]\r\nPlease consult the Pictorial Guide v2.0 that I provide. You can download it in Downloads section, under \\\"Miscellaneous\\\" category\r\n\r\n[img]http://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee187/Raestloz/uninstall.jpg[/img]\r\n[b]First, be sure to remove any armors that you equip[/b], as you\\'re going to lose them. The best course of action is to switch them back to vanilla version.\r\n\r\n[b][size=5][color=orange]THEN, CAST THE \\\"Armor Change: DISABLE\\\" SPELL.[/color][/size][/b]\r\n\r\nAfter that, simply deactivate RaestlozArmorChange.esm, the extension modules (if any), and remove all respective files and folders.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t cast the \\\"Armor Change: DISABLE\\\" spell, the scripts won\\'t be removed, and might bloat your save.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee187/Raestloz/QA.jpg[/img]\r\n01. Does this mod support the enchanted variants of armors?\r\n-Yes.\r\n\r\n02. What about smithing? Forging? \r\n-Yes, this mod fully supports both activities. You can temper the custom armors, and when you forge an item, it will be replaced\r\n\r\n03. How exactly does the mod work?\r\n-I duplicated all the armors that I want to duplicate, and put a script that basically says this: \r\n\\\"When a piece of armor/clothing is put into player\\'s inventory, see if it has duplicates, is yes remove said item and give player the custom one\\\"\r\n\r\nThis mod only checks when you\\'re getting an item. Specifically, when OnItemAdded is called. This event is called when you craft items, take item from the game world, take something from a container (buying from merchant, stealing, pickpocketing). So basically anytime you get something.\r\n\r\n04. What about the items I currently have in my inventory?\r\n-Items in your inventory are perfectly safe, so long as they don\\'t leave your inventory (perhaps you give \\'em to follower, store \\'em in a chest, sell \\'em, etc). If you wish to keep them, you can use the Switch Armor Change spell extensively\r\n\r\n05. Does this mod support males?\r\n-Yes, this mod supports both genders. If you find an armor I missed, please tell me.\r\n\r\n06. Does this mod support [insert your favorite armor here]?\r\n-Version 2.0 has a major overhaul, and this question has an absolute answer of \\\"yes\\\"\r\n\r\n07. Your mod does not support [insert a piece of vanilla armor here]!\r\n-First, there is a distinction between \\\"I missed \\'em somehow\\\" and \\\"I don\\'t support \\'em\\\". If I miss a variant of an armor set that I support (for example, if I missed Iron Helmet of Destruction), please tell me. But since I already don\\'t support Psijic Robes, I will ignore reports about Psijic Robes\r\n\r\n08. Does this mod support Dawnguard?\r\n-Yes, there\\'s an extension for Dawnguard.\r\n\r\n09. Will this mod support Dragonborn?\r\n-Yes, there\\'s an extension for Dragonborn\r\n\r\n10. What is the Hearthfire plugin for?\r\n-It replaces the armors of Falkrteah housecarl with the custom version\r\n\r\n11. Does this mod affect performance?\r\n-No, it doesn\\'t. The scripts are very lightweight and optimized.\r\n\r\n12. Will this mod cause save game bloat?\r\n-If you don\\'t disable the armor switch feature before uninstalling the mod, it might. However, considering the way the mod works, it will do so in a very slow pace, that you might not realize it.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee187/Raestloz/recommend.jpg[/img]\r\nFor best experience, you may want to try these mods:\r\n1. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13004]Remodeled Armor CBBEv3M[/url] by MAK07\r\n2. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3654]Killer Keo\\'s Skimpy CBBEv2 Armor Set[/url] by Killer Keo\r\n\r\n[img]http://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee187/Raestloz/thanks.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nA HUGE, HUGE THANKS to Bethesda forums user tunaisafish. His binary search method allows this mod to be possible at all. Because of him, 2 weeks worth of effort is not wasted.\r\n\r\nTo Killer Keo and MAK07, their great armor replacers fuels my motivation to create this mod (especially the Lilith Maiden-Loom incident). Be sure to check \\'em out, and endorse them if you like \\'em.\r\n\r\nA BIG admiration for Bethesda employees who managed to create these armor entries in the first place. If any of you guys are reading this, I know how mind-numbing your work is, doing the same thing over and over and over again. Great job guys.",
