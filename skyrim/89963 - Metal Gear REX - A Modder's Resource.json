  "descriptionHtml": "I know that this is Skyrim lore-breaking and not something that belongs in a medieval fantasy world, but here is a 3D model that I made using the 3D modeling program Blender, of Metal Gear REX from the 1998 game Metal Gear solid.\n<br />\n<br />I hope that someone can rig, animate, texture it, and then somehow turn it into a vehicle mod in Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />Obviously this would be an extremely long, complex, and daunting task, but if you\n<br /> have the technical know-how or are a career professional in the game \n<br />development field and think you can do it, then by all means, please do!\n<br />\n<br />I realize that this mesh is somewhat of a mess, and you have permission to polish and clean it up.\n<br />\n<br />According to this game footage from Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns Of The Patriots, \n<br />REX\"s walks with it's legs slightly outwards and in a steep downward \n<br />position.\n<br />\n<br />Also, it's lower legs are move up and down like shock absorbers. They retract slightly when sitting down, and extend slightly \n<br />when standing up or walking.\n<br />\n<br />If you're going to animate it walking, study this video very closely and try to replicate it's walk.\n<br />\n<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciIVuUzhs2o",
