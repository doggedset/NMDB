  "modName": "Altars and Shrines Dont Cure Diseases",
  "summary": "Exactly what it says on the tin, makes it so praying at an altar doesn&#39;t cure diseases.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A very simple mod that changes the shrines so that they don&#39;t cure your diseases. I downloaded a few different mods that make diseases more intimidating, but those changes didn&#39;t mean much when I could still cure them with no cost to myself, and to have such an option readily available in every town. \r<br />\r<br />The shrines, of course, still give you their blessings.\r<br />\r<br />This mod has been checked and cleaned with TES5Edit.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is incompatible with anything that edits the properties of the shrine blessings. Otherwise, it&#39;s compatible with everything.\r<br />\r<br />No DLC requirements.",
