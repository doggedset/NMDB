  "descriptionHtml": "I got quite a few requests to make an Aetherial bow and arrows, so here it is.\r\n\r\nThe Aetherial bow uses kinetec energy drawn from your heart beat to fling arrows at high speeds(it has Zephyr\\'s Speed shooting enchantment). It is made using Zephyr as the base (like upgrading it).\r\n\r\nThe Aetherial arrows are created continuously by the quiver (I have not quite fixed the bugs with this yet so for now you can forge more from the ones you have).\r\n\r\nThey can be forged at the aetherial forge\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis mod does require Dawnguard ",
