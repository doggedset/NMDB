  "descriptionHtml": "A add-on to this mod Dovahkiin Sword has been released!\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/39373/\r\n\r\nI wanted too look like the dovahkiin from the game trailer in later game, but then i realized that the studded armor is a light one, and iron boots, gauntlets and helmet are very weak. So i did this set :)\r\nIt looks exactly like the one from the trailer (iron boots, gauntlets and helmet, iron banded shield and studded armor) ,but EVERY part of it is heavy (there is optional everything light version, you can use both at one time) and has great enchantments. It has nearly daedric armor rating (light one has nearly dragonscale) so it\\'s great for later game. And looks awesome. If you have any retextures of those parts of armor it will apply to this mod.\r\nTo obtain it, you must have \\\"Dragon Armor\\\" smithing perk, and craft it under the Dragon section in SKYFORGE!\r\n\r\nHeavy Armor Stats:\r\n\r\nBoots: Basic Armor 17 points\r\nEnchantment: Resist frost increased by 70 percent\r\n\r\nCuirass: Basic Armor 48 points\r\nEnchantment: Healing rate increased by 50 percent\r\n\r\nGauntlets: Basic Armor 17 points\r\nEnchantment: One handed weapon make 40 percent more damage\r\n\r\nHelmet: Basic Armor 22 points\r\nEnchantment: Time between shouts decreased by 20%\r\n\r\nShield: Basic Armor 34 points\r\nEnchantment: Resist fire increased by 70 %\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLight version stats:\r\n\r\nBoots: Basic Armor 11 points\r\nEnchantment: Resist frost increased by 70 percent\r\n\r\nCuirass: Basic Armor 39 points\r\nEnchantment: Healing rate increased by 50 percent\r\n\r\nGauntlets: Basic Armor 11 points\r\nEnchantment: One handed weapon make 40 percent more damage\r\n\r\nHelmet: Basic Armor 16 points\r\nEnchantment: Time between shouts decreased by 20%\r\n\r\nShield: Basic Armor 28 points\r\nEnchantment: Resist fire increased by 70 %\r\n\r\nThe textures in the screenshots are not included.
