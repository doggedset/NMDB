  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/V0ICmGW.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />This mod simply doubles the damage of Fire and Frost breath shouts and cuts their cooldowns to 10/20/30 to make them viable on higher levels. 90 damage on a 2-minute cooldown felt a little useless and other shouts were more useful so I just made this. If it feels too overpowered, you can just uninstall it and be on your way :)\r<br />\r<br />Damages now: \r<br />\r<br />Fire Breath: 100/140/180\r<br />\r<br />Frost Breath: 20/28/36 per second for 5 seconds, also slows target as usual\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Took 2 minutes to create, do whatever you want with it, [b]AS LONG AS YOU DON&#39;T SELL OR MAKE PROFIT OF IT[/b]&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Workshop:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=248689438]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=248689438[/url]",
