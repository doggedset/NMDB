  "descriptionHtml": "[b][center][size=3]===Thadas===[/size][/center][/b]\r<br />Thadas Othrileth is a Dunmer vampire merchant who lives in the middle of the snowy wilderness selling overpowered items to people who come knocking, no questions asked. \r<br />\r<br />He lives in a tent across the road from the Weynon Stones (east of them). His tent is actually barely off the road, right beside the ore deposits, but I hid it so well I spent ten minutes looking for it on two separate occasions. :P Basically there&#39;s just a lot of brush around it; keep looking to your right.\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]He has a chance to wander to the inn in any city, every night. He may very well not be at home. \r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]On Sunday nights he is supposed to return home, so if you want him, that&#39;s your best bet to catch him. \r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]He sleeps from around 10 a.m. to around 6 p.m., but he will sell at any time.\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]He is not set to be essential, so it&#39;s possible he will die by misadventure, but I sincerely doubt it. See below.\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]He is wearing a super duper special amulet, but you&#39;d have to kill him to get it, and if you manage to kill him you probably deserve it. He&#39;s a level 55 conjuration and destruction master, with appropriate perks and spells. \r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]He&#39;s technically marry-able. (Unfortunately the best voice type in the game, which he uses, doesn&#39;t have any follower dialogue in it, so he is not an available follower. Not that he&#39;d be very interesting anyway, he&#39;d just snark and kill things. :P He would be pretty OP though...)\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][size=3]===Inventory===[/size][/b][/center][size=2]\r<br />[/size]Sold by Thadas Othrileth:\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][size=2]1 ring and amulet each of Immunity to Shock[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]1 ring and amulet each of Immunity to Frost\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]1 ring and amulet each of Immunity to Fire\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]1 ring and amulet each of Immunity to Magic[/size]\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]1 ring of Unburdening (adds 1000 to carrying capacity)[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]1 Ring of the Archmage (reduces cost of spells in every school by 75%) [/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]1 ring of Night Eye[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]1 ring of Detect Life + Detect Dead[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]1 amulet of Night Eye + Detect Life + Detect Dead[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]1 pair of boots (clothing) with 100% Muffle[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Conjurer&#39;s Ambrosia (potions) - Each potion&#39;s effect lasts 1 day; the power of the potion has been amped up so that your summons are nigh permanent. [/size][/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />Craftable only [size=1](so, I suppose, not actually &#39;inventory&#39;...)[/size] :\r<br />\r<br />1 full set (helmet, gauntlets, boots, cuirass, shield) of Skyforge Steel Armor (+temper recipes)\r<br />[list][*]weigh the same as leather armor\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]defined as Heavy Armor\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]have stats identical to Ebony Armor\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]craftable only at the Skyforge[/*]\r<br />[*]craftable only by a member of the companions[/*]\r<br />[*]will not show up on your crafting list unless you have steel ingots (which means no crafting list clutter)\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />Found in the world: \r<br />[size=2]\r<br />[list][*][size=2]1 Amulet of Unburdening (adds 1000 to carrying capacity)[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list][/size]The Amulet of Unburdening can be found near Goldenglow Estate\r<br />-as you approach the bee farm, jump off the bridge and go left. Look in stands of kelp for a skeleton. I don&#39;t think it will be easy to find, but hey, you&#39;re getting a godlike artifact for free. Spend some time looking.\r<br />And if you can&#39;t find it, never fear. You can buy the ring version for an ungodly sum of money.[size=2]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][size=3]===Install/Uninstall===[/size][/b][/center]\r<br />It&#39;s just a simple .esp file. Simply put into your Data folder, activate it / deactivate it and remove from Data folder. Has no scripts. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][size=3]===Other===[/size][/b][/center]\r<br />I&#39;m pretty new at this NPC thing, so if you happen to see him behaving oddly, not ever moving from his tent, or anything, tell me and I&#39;ll see if I messed him up. I believe he&#39;s working properly though. (Honestly I had a heck of time just getting him to sell things; I&#39;d like him to wander around like he should, but it&#39;s not going to break anything if he doesn&#39;t, so it&#39;s not that important. :P )\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s possible I&#39;ll take requests for overpowered items to give him to sell; most of this was requests already. Vanilla only (meaning no new textures or meshes) and no scripts; just enchantments, stats, and possibly spells. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][size=3]===Credits===[/size][/b][/center]\r<br />Skyforge Steel and some of the immunity jewelry requested by [url=http://http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/789049-many-ideas-but-no-talent]Sitkhar[/url] on the forums.

I had a similar request for immunity jewelry from the Workshop and merged them.)\r<br />OP conjuration potions requested by [url=http://http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/2199189-overpowered-fortify-conjuration-potion-effect]CakeBandit[/url] on the forums.\r<br />Archmage Ring requested by [url=http://http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/787219-the-ultimate-ring-of-the-archmage/?view=findpost&p=6316499&hl=%2Bring+%2Bthe+%2Barchmage]Muragetsu[/url] on the forums. \r<br />Night Eye enchantment requested by my friend, expanded on with Detect by own self.\r<br />Muffled shoes requested by me, the sneakmage. ",
