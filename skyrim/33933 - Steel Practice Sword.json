  "summary": "This mod adds a dirt simple metal sword, no fancy whizzbangers and doodads, that you can make at a forge or get from Khajiit merchants now and then. It&#39;s meant as a step up from the wooden sword added by Hearthfire, so you can give it to your kids or use it if you&#39;re level one and can&#39;t get your hands on anything better.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a dirt simple metal sword, no fancy whizzbangers and doodads, that you can make at a forge or get from khajiit merchants now and then. It&#39;s meant as a step up from the wooden sword added by Hearthfire, so you can give it to your kids or use it if you&#39;re level one and can&#39;t get your hands on anything better.\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s no smithing skill or perk requirement for it, all y&#39;need is a steel ingot and a piece firewood and you can go along your merry way. It&#39;s fully temperable as well, so if you enjoy smacking Thalmor with the flat of your flimsy blade, you can temper it up, stick a couple enchantments on it, and call it Throb&#39;s Magnificent Sword of Slapping if you wanted.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=big]You WILL need the Hearthfire DLC for this mod.[/size][/b] \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve also added a version for Vanilla Skyrim, which you can find in the optional files section. Now you non-Hearthfire folk will be able to Power of Greyskull your way to victory&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Changelog&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Version 1.2[/b]\r<br />\r<br />    Added custom draw and sheath sounds for the sword.\r<br />\r<br />    Added a &#34;stuck&#34; version, which is the sword trapped inside its scabbard. Does the same amount of damage, but is a little slower. Mostly for novelty purposes.\r<br />\r<br />    Added a vanilla version for all y&#39;all out there without Hearthfire. Also includes the stuck-in-scabbard version and custom draw and sheathe sounds.\r<br />\r<br />    Removed Herobrine\r<br />\r<br />[b]Version 1.1[/b]\r<br />\r<br />    Added sword to bandit level lists, and you can now buy it from vendors.\r<br />\r<br />    Knocked its weight down by two and nerfed its stagger and crit damage.\r<br />\r<br />    Had a sweet roll.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Version 1.0[/b]\r<br />\r<br />    Initial Release\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Known Bugs: None at the moment, and it should be compatible with just about everything since it&#39;s a very simple weapon mod. Mods that modify the gift formlists for kids might override it though, depending on where it is in the load order and how many things have been added to the lists.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Check out my other mods&#33; They just wanna be friends.[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36953/?]The Infinity Sword[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37166/?]Ratdeath - The Sword of Martin[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34749/?]The Black Sword[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[u]LET IT BE KNOWN THIS MOD SHALL NOT BE COPIED AND PASTED ELSEWHERE WITHOUT PERMISSION OF THE AUTHOR (ME).
