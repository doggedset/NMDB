  "descriptionHtml": "The Old Kingdom Film Project is an ambitious project I\\'ve decided to attempt in which I create an original story within the world of Skyrim and turn it into a feature-length film shot in-game.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[heading] UPDATES:[/heading]\r\n\r\n4/9/2013 - Project is still a go.  First draft of script is nearly complete.  I am also working on my cinematography mainly, at the moment.  Finally, I\\'m also sorting through various visual mods to use to make the movie look better than vanilla Skyrim.  The only problem is, now I\\'m gonna need a faster GPU to work with as I want the movie to run at 30fps without dropping below that.  My current SLI GTS450 cards just can\\'t do it in heavy scenes.  More details inbound.\r\n\r\n12/1/2012 - A small update.  We thus far, have some volunteers willing to do voice acting.  In addition, we have people who will translate my English subtitles to other languages so folks in other regions can enjoy the film once it\\'s completed and released.  I also managed to get a pretty popular armor modder here on the nexus interested in creating a custom armor just for the film.  I won\\'t say who yet, but you won\\'t be disappointed.  Lastly, I have begun working on a rough version of the script.  It still has a long way to go, but it\\'s moving along.  Stay Tuned!\r\n\r\n[img] http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/25948-1-1351092986.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nTitle: Spirits of the Old Kingdom (Working Title)\r\n\r\nTHE ANCESTOR\r\n\tDirector\r\n\tWriter\r\n\tEditor\r\n\r\nRuntime: 1 hour - 1 hour 30 minutes\r\n\r\nVersion(s): Theatrical, Director\\'s Cut\r\n\r\nRelease Date: Q3-Q4 2013\r\n\r\nDistribution: YouTube, SkyrimNexus, Official Site | http://oldkingdomfilm.tumblr.com/\r\n\r\nFormat: 1080p @30fps, English audio only(multi-language subtitles)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[heading] OTHER DETAILS:[/heading]\r\n\r\n- This project has not yet officially been started.\r\n- I still need to write the script (at this point, I will make it official)\r\n- I definitely need to upgrade my GPU as this film will be shot on my general purpose gaming pc instead of my workstation.  My workstation is much faster, but I\\'d rather leave that system nice and clean.\r\n- I guess you could call this film project open-source and as such, it will be available for free for all to watch once it releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[heading] HELP NEEDED:[/heading]\r\n\r\nI will almost certainly need some help from the community once this project has officially begun.  I will likely need:\r\n\r\n- Voice actors (male and female, must use quality mics and eliminate background noise, etc. and act in a manor that is lore-friendly.  I\\'m not expecting Oscars material, but decent work is a plus)\r\n- Set builders (people to build unique in-game sets via the Creation Kit, it\\'d probably take too long if I tried to do them all myself.)\r\n- Folks to do subtitles for other languages besides English, as I will do those myself.\r\n- Side story writers (I may also work in some side stories created by the community and will use some sort of voting method to choose a couple of them to include in the film)\r\n\r\nThis section will be updated as I continue to plan out the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[heading]MODS:[/heading]\r\n\r\nThis project will include mods in the film.  Most notably the film will be shot using an ENB (Fimbulvinter as it stands since it\\'s my personal favorite)\r\n\r\n- There will definitely be armor/clothing mods featured in the film(authors will receive proper credits.\r\n- If some of you would like to create custom LORE-FRIENDLY armor/clothing specifically for this project, that would be great.  However, you do not need to start creating them until I can assure you that the project has become official.  More details will come later.\r\n- This project may also call for custom animations, but at this point I don\\'t yet foresee the need for any that do not already exist.  I will request some from the community if needed.\r\n- Other mods may include weapons, textures, dungeons and other location types, etc.\r\n\r\nOTHER UPDATES WILL BE MADE PUBLIC IN THE COMING WEAKS AND MONTHS THIS PROJECT PROGRESSES.\r\n\r\n- THE ANCESTOR\r\n\r\n[heading]PRE-PRODUCTION STILLS[/heading]\r\n\r\nThe following stills are not from actual film footage, but rather, they serve as a guide for what the film may look like once it\\'s complete.  Actual film stills uploaded in the future will be properly labeled as such.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/RoseeAugust2012_001_zps57f06485.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/TESV2012-09-0515-13-10-74_zps941d262d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/TESV2012-08-0406-45-48-71_zps0464eb97.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/TheGildergreen_zps579e37fa.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/TESV_031_zps657a167c.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/OdriVeteranNordSteelPlateArmor_053LB_zpsa749bf6e.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/OdriVeteranNordSteelPlateArmor_042_zps8858eaa1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/OdriBlondeInWhiterun_002_zps64fc3cdf.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/TESV2012-06-0806-30-55-36_zps02587cd8.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[heading] BONUS CONTENT[/heading]\r\n\r\nThe Fire Hall:  The Fire Hall is located just outside Windhelm by small hill with the abandoned cart.  The Fire Hall originally started out as just a stand-alone mod which is a pub/hangout based on New Gnisis club already in the game that players could go to get whatever custom quests I\\'d create over time.  The project was eventually scrapped, but when I came up with the idea for this film project, I decided that The Fire Hall would look great in the film.  So, I\\'ve uploaded a beta version of the MOD for everyone to check out before it makes its way into the film.\r\n\r\nKEEP IN MIND that The Fire Hall has not been worked on since before I came up with the idea for the film.  As such, the mod is incomplete.  In the screens below you will see armors made by various authors here on the Nexus.  When the mod was scrapped, the armors may have been uninstalled as well, so you may see huge bugs like missing bodies or something.  The purpose of the upload is to let you guys have a sneak peek at the location.  I won\\'t be updating the Fire Hall mod anytime soon as a stand-alone mod.  Any updates will be strictly for the film.  As I do update it for the film, I will however try to make it into a functioning mod so that it could potentially be released as a full stand-alone (sort of as bonus content from the film).\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Images below do not feature actual still from the film, but the characters featured are from the film.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/The%20Fire%20Hall/Evangeline01.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/The%20Fire%20Hall/General01.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/The%20Fire%20Hall/HeadeyTheBard.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/The%20Fire%20Hall/Mitra01.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/The%20Fire%20Hall/Mitra02.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/The%20Fire%20Hall/Mitra03.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/The%20Fire%20Hall/Nightwisper01.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/The%20Fire%20Hall/Nightwisper02.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/The%20Fire%20Hall/Vyx-BellaFireHall01.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x335/GODROAR/OKFP/The%20Fire%20Hall/Vyx-BellaRiverwood01.jpg[/IMG]",
