  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://s28.postimg.org/oa4zsj72l/EDKASplash.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]&#34;Exposed Dragon Knight Armor&#34; is a not quite  lore friendly and admittedly risque adaptation of hothtrooper44&#39;s original armor mod. It is intended but not limited to the CBBE body and was made by combining it with assets from ChronoTrigger77&#39;s exquisite Remodeled Armors mod. This was created as something  of  a &#34;for fun&#34; thing that turned into a full on passion project of sorts, even going so far as to seek out hothtrooper44 for his blessing (thanks man&#33;). After many a delay I can finally share this for all to enjoy. ^_^\r<br />\r<br />This mod comes available in two flavors: [color=#ea9999]Add On[/color] and [color=#ffd966][color=#93c47d]Replacer[/color].[/color] [color=#ea9999]\r<br />\r<br />The addon version as the name suggests, works as a non-standalone plugin that absolutely requires the original mod to use. This add-on arrangement allows users to use both original and skimpy armor meshes in their game as they like.[/color] [color=#93c47d]\r<br />\r<br />The replacer version (again as the name suggests lol) just simply replaces the original female armor meshes with the skimpy ones, needing only the original Dragon Knight armor mod to use. [/color][color=#00ff00]The Replacer version also has the added (and entirely unintended) benefit of being completely compatible with the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19733/?]&#34;Immersive Armors&#34;[/url] mod.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />Stat wise when using the add on ver. the skimpy armors are pretty identical with their more enclosing counterparts.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[u]HARD REQUIREMENTS[/u]------------&gt;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28287]Dragon Knight Armor[/url] by HothTrooper44 (obviously lol)\r<br />\r<br />[/size][u]OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS[/u]------------&gt;\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49015/?]Bodyslide 2[/url] by Caliente (only needed to build custom body shapes and to make and use the HDT meshes, make sure you have the most up to date version otherwise you WILL crash)\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68000/?]XP32 Maximum Skeleton Extended[/url] by Groovtama AND [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53996/?]HDT Physics Extension by HydrogensaysHDT[/url] (both are needed if you want to use the HDT meshes made from Bodyslide 2)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[u]IN GAME ACQUISITION[/u]------------&gt;\r<br />\r<br />If your using the Replacer ver. getting the armor is identical in hothtroopers44&#39;s mod. \r<br />\r<br />But if you using the Add On ver, not only must you meet the [color=#ffd966]original requirements (components, both Ebony and Dragon smithing perks)[/color], [size=3][b]you must take these built pieces of armor and have them remodeled at a tanning rack.[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[u]F.A.Q.[/u]------------&gt;\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />[color=#ffe599]-This armor has HDT weights now, but I have to use Bodyslide to get them? Why is that?\r<br />\r<br />First reason is because from an uploader&#39;s point of view, I want to keep the amount of downloads low. Its easier for me to manage if I need to make a fix that effects all the files.\r<br />\r<br />Second reason at this point, I feel that anyone who&#39;s familiar with HDT should also already be familiar with Bodyslide 2. If your not though hey no worries, now is as any a good time to learn. Check this handy [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMdYbd_hPgk]video guide[/url] to get you brushed up on. =) \r<br />[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#93c47d][size=4]-Does HothTrooper44 REALLY know what you did here?\r<br />\r<br />[i]Wellllll[/i][/size] [size=4]see for yourself.....\r<br />\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br /> [url=http://postimg.org/image/guyr876gh/][img]http://s24.postimg.org/guyr876gh/WHY.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />[color=#666666]     [/color][/color]\r<br />[color=#93c47d][size=4][color=#666666][color=#999999]*Seriously he does and is totally cool with it. =)[/color][/color][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]CREDITS & GRADITUDES[/u]------------&gt;\r<br />\r<br />[b]HothTrooper44[/b] for being a total good sport for letting me skimp up his [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28287/?]Dragon Knight Armor[/url] like this.
