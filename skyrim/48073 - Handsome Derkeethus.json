  "descriptionHtml": "I wanted to use Derkeethus as a follower and a marriage partner -- unfortunately, he is quite possibly the most BORING argonian to grace Skyrim.  \r\n\r\nSo, I jumped into the Creation Kit and made him prettier, or at least, prettier according to my female argonian, Tar-Ja.\r\n\r\nThis was tested with over 50 hours of gameplay and should be compatible with UFO (I had it last in my load order).  \r\n\r\nThis is my first mod in a very long time, and as simple as it is, I hope I packaged it correctly to prevent the dark face bug.  Please report any issues, upload pictures, or endorse if you found this file to be to your liking.",
