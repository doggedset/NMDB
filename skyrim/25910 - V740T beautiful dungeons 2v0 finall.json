  "descriptionHtml": "NEW WERSION!!!\r\n[please read all]\r\n\r\nI\\'ve never liked the original textures in skyrim dungeon, so I decided to change it, I found quite a few interesting files (dds) and I applied it to the game.\r\nIt turned out, however, that one and others like them, and not necessarily something to change.\r\nSo I decided to compile the 2v0 versions so that everyone according to their own preferences (even a complete layman) could have on your own to find the right texture! and this is done!\r\nIn addition to my \\\"default\\\" configuration mod, provided you already grouped a lot of textures from which we can you use, you just swap between them and see the changes taking place in the dungeons :) Have fun: D Be warned - someone does not know what he wants, you can select the appropriate texture take it even a day (my son just had) course can swap, or not all, if you delete a file from the \\\"dungeons\\\" game automaticaly loads the default textures for the item :)\r\nI provided the default floor texture even game, but in HD.\r\nNow the walls and everything else can have ornaments Nords or the other. They can also be porous or smooth-decide for yourself ...\r\nI recommend to download modifications to the caves (see link at bottom of page) To improve the locations in which sows to connect to the caves, and of course for the sake of improving the image of the cave .. (flex more advanced players with this set of textures can use in order to replace them (eg texture walls to try to move in floor, etc.) [Now you have literally thousands of options]\r\nThe package I added 2 files \\\"esp\\\" one to control lighting and \\\"HDR, bloom, shadows, etc.\\\" This is my second file an amendment to the master file. It regulates all the effects and most importantly, doing it separately for [interior - exterior - underground] thanks to this I was able to set all the parameters as appropriate for each location! So ??really these 2 files \\\"esp\\\" completely supersede \\\"ENB Series\\\" and do not contribute to a decrease in FPS!\r\n\r\nImportant - file \\\"Realistic Lighting Patcher\\\" is to be under the file \\\"Realistic Lighting\\\"\r\nOf course these 2 files are not required for this modification ... but honestly recommend.\r\nIf u like this rebuild please endorse...\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to upload screenshots OWN, TO OTHER PLAYERS SEE YOUR CONFIGURATION\r\n\r\n                                                                                      MODIFICATION CONTAINS\r\n\r\ntextures for the default configuration of the dungeons, I split further texture and grouped them so that each of you could have yourself to find the right texture to your liking! They are divided and described in different folders.\r\nThese folders as \\\"default\\\" - the texture of these folders are located in the modification of the default (they are also shown in the screenshots) but 6 screenshot its OPTIONAL files for \\\"WALL SARCOPHAGI DRAUGRS\\\" (red bricks rusty)\r\n\r\n                                                                                     FOLDER LIST AND CONTENT\r\n\r\n0 - data (main file) [default textures my mod]\r\n\r\n1 - TUNNELS, ARCHES WALLS\r\n\r\n3 colors embossed small cubes\r\n3 colors small cube of glare\r\nalgae on sandstone\r\nblack gold deep embossing\r\nblack gold embossed Nords and gloss (default)\r\nclear embossed scale\r\ndark volcanic embossed scale\r\nembossed scale volcanic Nords\r\nflat gray stones with green gloss\r\ngray brick with small glossy\r\nirregular light sandstone\r\nstone ruins\r\n\r\n2 - COLUMNS AND WALLS AT THE STAIRS\r\n\r\nblocks of gray glases\r\ngray bricks\r\ngreater gray brick\r\nold stone\r\nscale of veined\r\nscale volcanic\r\nsmall gray brick with gloss (default)\r\n\r\n3 - ADDITIONAL WALLS AND PLATFORMS\r\n\r\nbadly burned brick\r\nclean blocks\r\ngray-green stone tiles (default)\r\nlarge plates of gloss\r\nsandstone shelled\r\nsmall gray brick\r\nvitreous mosaic\r\n\r\n4 - WALL SARCOPHAGI DRAUGRS\r\n\r\nbright red rustic brick\r\ncarved in stone\r\ndark gray with embossed Nordic (default)\r\ndug in the ground\r\nrustic brown\r\nsandstone embossed\r\nvery tired gray\r\nyellow with paintings\r\n\r\n5 - FLOORS\r\n\r\ndefault game  but HD\r\ndefault game bump mapping but HD \r\nset (default)\r\nset 1 and 1a\r\nset 2\r\nset 3\r\nset 4\r\nand read me for floor setting and changes textures.\r\n\r\nNow you can choose for themselves sow your dream;)\r\nI hope that the 3 days of my work you enjoy and improve the experience of the game - GOOD LUCK.\r\n\r\n                                                                                       How to set YOUR OWN TEXTURE?\r\n\r\nI suggest you stand in front of some dungeons and take a \\\"working\\\" save game.\r\ntekxtury convert to whatever you want to actually check paste them into a folder 9data/textures/dungeons) and turn on the game - to load the record which had previously prepared. Enter the dungeon and watch the textures of their choice ...\r\nYou can of course save your game right away in the dungeon, but sometimes when loading the game with textures podmienionymi game may mistakenly refer to the state of the game in which currently we use a different set of textures and \\\"we crash to the desktop\\\", but when we turn on the game again there is no longer a problem :) Of course, as I choose to just turn our textures to load the game - save and reload the game, it works without any problems :)\r\n\r\n\r\nMY OTHERS MODS\r\n\r\nV740T Beautiful landscape - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25995 \r\nV740T beautiful caves - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25768#content (recomended)\r\nMUSIC and SOUNDS for SKYRIM - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24129 (High Quality) \r\nRecoloured dialogue menu - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27704",
