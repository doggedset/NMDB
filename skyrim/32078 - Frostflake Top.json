I have tested a lot. \r\nBut when I liked the houses, I mostly didn´t liked the places. But I wanted \r\nto start a new character and playing it out with the Frostfall - Hypothermia Mods as\r\na hunting / survival game. So I had to build my own one and also finally \r\nstart to learn the creation kit basics.\r\n\r\nSo, this my first mod and and sadly, I could not figure out how to rework\r\nthe exterior navmesh completly yet. But there is enough place for some followers\r\nto move and use the workplace or sit at the campfire. The shack itself is follower friendly !\r\n\r\nOn my own, into the wilds, surviving. So, feel invited to do the same with your next game !\r\n\r\nP.S. Feel free to post a lot of screenshots :)\r\nP.S.S. Since many ask what ENB I´m using: jasminENB and I´ve added mainly saturation via the IMAGINATOR mod. For this mod, I also made my custom colored light for fire and daylight.\r\n\r\n",
