  "summary": "A simple retexture of Alduin to make him resemble the villainess from Disney\\'s Sleeping Beauty.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]8YDmNL_BJgQ[/youtube]\r\n\r\nI\\'ve been unhappy with Alduin\\'s vanilla appearance pretty much since the game launched, but I have yet to find a retexture that I\\'ve been entirely satisfied with. Finally, I decided to take a crack at it myself, basing it off of another famous dragon in popular culture who I felt Alduin somewhat resembled (I think it was the horns).\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty simple recolor, but I feel like it makes him a lot more interesting looking, while still (hopefully) fitting in with Skyrim\\'s aesthetic.\r\n\r\nTo install, extract the archive to your Skyim/Data folder and allow it to overwrite any files that it might conflict with.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s highly recommended that you pair this mod with Dragon Fire Recolor (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3441) to give him the green flame breath as well.",
