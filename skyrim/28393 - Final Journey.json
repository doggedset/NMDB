  "modName": "Final Journey",
  "summary": "As much as I loved Morrowind a lot of the mods made seem to emphasis the Nerevarine was the Dragonborn when that is not the case.  This mod is a short ballad on what I believe became of the Nerevarine lore wise.  It\\'s small and to the point.",
  "descriptionHtml": "During the Oblivion Crisis it was said the Nerevarine had left to Akavir on some expedition and never returned.  Quite the opposite as one day while you were paying your respects to the Goddess of Dusk and Dawn you discover a weather beaten journal behind the altar and none other than Nerevar\\'s ring Moon and Star with it.\r\n\r\nIt is in this journal you read the short history of what became of the Nerevarine, his/her time in Akavir and how with a final quest asked Azura to lift the curse on his/her ring so as to give you his/her blessing in the path before you.\r\n\r\nThe ring has the same enchant it did before along with a journal next to it behind the altar of Azura\\'s Shrine.  I take no credit for the model and texture of Moon and Star.  All credit goes to Private Eye and his talents.\r\n\r\nOriginal Mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13220\r\n\r\nFarewell old friend.  May you find more peace in Moonshadow than you did in Tamriel.",
