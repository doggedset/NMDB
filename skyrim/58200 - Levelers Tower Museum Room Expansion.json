  "descriptionHtml": "=====\r<br />Note:\r<br />=====\r<br />\r<br />This requires the original Levelers Tower: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14152/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=======\r<br />Update:\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />I also fixed the weapon racks, so that you can actually get back your weapons from them even if they are really short. Previously that was not possible for short weapons since they would be completely covert by hitboxes that are used to apply the scripts to the weapon racks.\r<br />\r<br />===========\r<br />Description:\r<br />===========\r<br />\r<br />This mod tripples the Display Rooms storage capability by adding 2 new halls to it. The can be accessed through the original Display Room.\r<br />If you, like me, always felt you didn´t have enough space to display all your gear and didn´t want to stuff it into a chest where you couldn´t see it, this will help you a lot. \r<br />\r<br />There are no new cheasts since there are already plenty of them in the corridor leading towards the Museum. Instead I decided to maximize the amount of \r<br />weapons racks and mannequins. \r<br />\r<br />Also, you get free apples&#33; :D\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />========\r<br />Optional:\r<br />========\r<br />\r<br />I added an optional plugin that adds 2 chests to each mannequin in the main Display Room aswell as to the mannequins in the Museum Room downstairs.\r<br />That shoud give you enought room for all you doubled gear that doesn´t fit onto the mannequins and for weapons of a particular armor set that you\r<br /> couldn´t put on the mannequins before.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=======\r<br />Credits:\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />Since I didn´t include any assets in this mod, it´s all my creation, however, \r<br />of courseCredit goes to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/132433]WilliamSea[/url] for creating the Levelers Tower and to the\r<br /> people credited in the original mods description.",
