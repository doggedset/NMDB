  "descriptionHtml": "HI first mod release so i made it a simple one (couldnt believe i couldnt find this out there already).\r\n\r\nOnly changes the ORIGINAL shrouded gloves to be disenchantable to learn the backstab enchant, after that it works like any other enchant and can only be applied to pieces worn on your hands, gloves/bracers etc...\r\n\r\nThis is part of a greater mod im working on but im learning as i go and thought id release this little effort for those assassins out there that dont like constantly swapping out equipment for backstabs.\r\n\r\nFuture plans are to make all original shrouded armour disenchantable and tie it in with making the ancient shrouded unenchanted.",
