He comitted a couple of petty crimes in Riften but understood he cannot bribe the guards anymore, so he settled in Ragged Flaggon. But theres one thing special about him.. he is blind. But as one sense goes away, the other senses sharpen up. Since he has put his criminal life away, he wishes to travel around Skyrim sharing adventures with whoever travels with him.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you like it and if you do please endorse, it makes me happy :)\r<br />\r<br />Have fun&#33;\r<br />~Arkentran",
