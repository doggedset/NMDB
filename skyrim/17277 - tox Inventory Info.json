  "summary": "Displayes the total weight of the inventory categories including weapons, apparel, potions, scrolls, food and misc. \r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "Utility Script\r\n============\r\nEvery category in the inventory gets an extra item. When activated, it \r\ncalculates the total weight of every category and adds that as a number \r\n(gold value 0.3+) to the title of the special items.\r\n\r\nE.G (SkyUI, monospace font): \r\n[img]http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/4647/iieg.png[/img]\r\n\r\n- - - - - \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nIntention of this script is to make grinding (dungeon crawling) a bit less \r\ntedious. There are mods that solve this by giving the player infinite carry \r\nweight, or similarly by using a \\\"Bag of Holding\\\" or bags and backpacks. This \r\nworks, but it is still impossible (if we assume that basic arithmetic hasn\\'t \r\nbeen invented) to know how much stuff you have in each category.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nExtract all files from the archive to Data in the game folder (gf).  \r\nDelete all files to uninstall. NMM does this automatically.\r\n\r\ngf could be: C:/steam/steamappas/common/skyrim\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n======\r\nActivate one item to initiate a re-count. This is not strictly necessary \r\nbecause the weight of a category will be updated when removing or adding \r\nan item from that category. All items in the inventory will be re-counted\r\nif a \\\"special\\\" item is equipped. This will take anywhere between 3 and \r\n15 seconds. \r\n\r\nUpgrade procedure\r\n==================\r\n\r\nIn most cases, it will be possible to simply install the new version \r\nover the other. In others, these steps will be necessary. Do not \r\nreport upgrade-errors before performing these steps.\r\n\r\nDo a \\\"clean save\\\":\r\n\r\n  1. save clean_loaded\r\n  2. qqq (quit)\t\t\t\r\n  3. remove .esp and .pex and .psc files (or uninstall with NMM)\r\n\r\n  4. load clean_loaded\t\r\n  5. wait 15 real life seconds (do not add / remove items in-game while doing this)\r\n  6. save clean_removed\t\r\n  7. qqq (quit)\t\t\t\r\n\r\n  8. install the new version\r\n  9. quick save\r\n 10. exit \r\n 11. play\r\n\r\nAll these steps are optional (post-install):\r\n\r\n  setstage toxiiQuestInit 1 for arial font item names (default)\r\n  setstage toxiiQuestInit 2 for monospace\r\n  setstage toxiiQuestInit 3 for single letter\r\n\r\n\r\nRequired files\r\n==============\r\nSKSE. \r\n\r\nCompatibility \r\n=============\r\nIndependant of other mods. Does not interfere with anything. \r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n============\r\nThe book item must be opened twice to display the latest info\r\n(as of 0.4, the book does not show any useful information).\r\n\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n=======\r\n\r\n0.1: Display weights of each category anywhere.\r\n0.2: Enable the player to select certain items which they wish to avoid selling\r\n0.3: Add dialog option to follower(s) which will make them sell items to \r\n     vendors for you. Something like: \r\n     \\\"Sell this crap at the nearst vendor and keep what you think is reasonable\\\"\r\n0.4: Store items on horses\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n------\r\n0.1: done\r\n0.2: not worth the effort\r\n0.3: other mod (skyrim postal service, not yet released)\r\n0.4: others have done this already. \r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n=========\r\n0.1  : Done (need to make spells re-equip after calculating weights)\r\n0.1.1: failed to include all scripts in the archive (alpha release - use with care)\r\n0.2  : dumped the old version where player was used as scales. SKSE enables checking item weight\r\n\r\n== 0.3 ==\r\n- the special items armor and weapons are no longer eligible for enchanting\r\n- removed support for skyrim coin replacer (mod has scripting issues)\r\n- special items will be automatically re-weighted on every tenth item in or out of player\\'s inventory\r\n- the weight of a category is now represented by the gold value of the special items (food and potions don\\'t work)\r\n- added \\\"support\\\" for the default arial font\r\n\r\n== 0.4 ==\r\n- optimized re-counting considerably when adding or removing a single item\r\n- fixed a possible (inevitable?)
