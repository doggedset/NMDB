  "summary": "Replaces the main menu theme music for Skyrim with the old login screen music from RuneScape",
  "descriptionHtml": "To intall just extract the file into your Skyrim Data file. To uninstall just delete it, although it will replace the current main screen theme so if you have already unpacked the music.bsa file you should consider making a copy as a back up. If you don\\'t know what I mean then just disregard the last sentence as it shouldn\\'t be a problem. I made this mod for 2 reasons; firstly because I\\'m wanting to make a set of mods that make Skyrim more like RuneScape (moreless) just for fun and this is an easy one to get me started as I have no modding experience (or knowledge) and secondly, I personally don\\'t really like the Skyrim main menu theme.",
