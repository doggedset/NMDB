You then carefully place these unrecognised mods in the order you want them loaded and all is great until you have to run BOSS again. You run BOSS once more and now you are back where you started and have to reorganise your load order yet again.\r<br />\r<br />The BOSS Userlist Manager helps you position your unrecognised mods in your load order so you only need to do this once. Next time you run BOSS, the unrecognised mods you positioned with the BOSS Userlist Manager will retain their position in your load order and will not be listed as unrecognised by BOSS.\r<br />\r<br />The BOSS Userlist Manager (BUM) helps you manage your mod load order for Skyrim, Oblivion, Nehrim, Fallout3 and FalloutNV.  It uses BOSS Userlist rules to customise the order in which mods should be loaded and allows you to specify the load order for unknown mods without editing the BOSS Masterlist. BUM is designed to work with the brilliant BOSS utility.  These are the key features...\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing your Userlist\r<br />[*]Automatically adds entries for any unknown mods that BOSS has detected\r<br />[*]Tells you when unknown mods defined in your Userlist have been added to the Masterlist and asks whether you want to remove the definition or change it to override the one that has been added to the Masterlist \r<br />[*]Allows you to define load order placement for mods that are not installed without generating BOSS error messages\r<br />[*]Allows you to define Userlist categories that help organise your definitions into logical groupings\r<br />[*]Tells you when your Userlist rule contains any omissions or errors - saves waiting until you run BOSS to find out\r<br />[*]Automatically generates the Rules with placement and Bash Tags for any unrecognised Sensual Walks mod\r<br />[*]Provides an easy way to capture Dirty mod information for reporting on the BOSS forum\r<br />[*]Provides an easy way to post your unrecognised mods on the BOSS forum.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b]Note:[/b]  BUM requires BOSS v1.6 or higher and for Skyrim, BOSS v1.9 or higher\r<br />\r<br />See [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1504414-relz-boss-userlist-manager-for-skyrim]BOSS Userlist Manager Bethesda Softworks Forum topic[/url] for additional discussions.\r<br />___________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Required[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=moccasin]Microsoft .
