  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to \"Make Me A Sandwich\"\n<br />\n<br />Sandwiches require several items to make. Therefore their restorative benefit is set to 20 health points.\n<br />\n<br />Both the sausage and sandwich are made at any cooking pot.\n<br />\n<br />First, sausage must be made with raw beef and a salt pile.\n<br />Then the sandwich must be made using:\n<br />Sausage, Tomato, Goat Cheese Wedge, Cabbage and Bread.\n<br />\n<br />Only the sausage and bread for the sandwich use a single custom texture.\n<br />The other ingredients have been mapped out onto vanilla textures to cut down on file size.\n<br />\n<br />AS OF 07-14-2018 NONE OF MY ASSETS ARE TO BE USED BY ANYONE FOR ANY PURPOSE.\n<br />If you don't like this change, thank the moderators for siding with plagiarizers and lying thieves on this site.",
