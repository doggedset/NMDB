One day the city was besieged by orcs. The orcs commenced a massive slaughter of the wood elves. Rolaryn’s parentswere killed while trying to defend their city. The city’s mage created a portal and instructed Rolaryn to enter it. She quickly did so and was teleported into an alternate dimension. His plan was to teleport her to another city where she would be safe, but that was not to be. The orcs overran the [/size][size=5]magestemple in Kelethin and killed him before he could finish the location incantation, and the portal closed.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]What Rolaryn didn’t know was that the same thing was happening on the world of\r<br />Norrath in two other parallel universes. Goblins had overrun the half-elf warrior tribe of Kelathon in one world, while in the other the Iksar was attacking the high\r<br />elves of Kulithin. What Rolaryn also didn’t know was that in both of these worlds, the city’s mage had opened a portal and their version of Ro had also gone. Their mages also suffered the same fate as Kelethin’s. A portal opened in the same\r<br />location at [/size][size=5]the exact same time in three different dimensions - As a result the space-time flux threw all three... into Skyrim.[/size]\r<br />[size=5]\r<br />[/size][size=5]There are three versions of Ro that you can use…and yes, you can use all of them\r<br />together if you [font=Calibri, sans-serif]would like.[/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Calibri, sans-serif][img]http://i1371.photobucket.com/albums/ag293/RipX5/rolswift_zpsanxud1u8.jpg[/img][/font]\r<br />[/size][size=4]\r<br />[/size][size=5]Rolaryn the Swift is the archer. ThisTimeIBeAGoodGirlSir (Creator of Elena Revamped) helped a lot in the development of these girls, so I asked her if she would like to make her own version of the archer. Rolaryn is a very tough archer,much like Elena. This Ro has the Celes Nightingale Armor and weapons,Sevenbase body, Demoniac 2k 4k 8k body textures and has an awesome draw speed/rate. Sheis also a little taller than the others. Rolaryn is located on the top floor of The Jarls Longhouse in Falkreath.She is swift, and is a great reinforcement in battle.\r<br />[color=#ff0000]REQUIREMENTS for Rolaryn -[/color]\r<br />Latest version RaceMenu (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?), or NetImmerse Override (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37481/?) if you are ECE/Vanilla user XP32 Maximum Skeleton Extended - XPMSE (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68000/?)HDT Physics Extensions (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53996/?)\r<br />[/size][img]http://i1371.photobucket.com/albums/ag293/RipX5/rolruth_zps02zeg81n.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Rolarin the Ruthless is the fighter. Sleepytigereyes was really helpful when I making her, and was nice enough to fine tune her specs for me. She has a UNP body, standard Nightingale armor and 2 nightingale blades. She has all the 1H and 2H perks and when set to dual swords in something like AFT\r<br />she is…dare I say it? RUTHLESS. Years ago she tried to invent a new invisibility potion that would allow to her to change between visible and invisible at will. Sadly there was an issue with the formula and Rolarin barely regained visibility. However,her experience will never be forgotten; her hair never fully materialized. [/size][size=5]If you look hard enough when she’s in the sunlight, sometimes you can see right through her hair&#33; Rolarin is located in Dragonreach.\r<br />\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[img]http://i1371.photobucket.com/albums/ag293/RipX5/rolfierce_zpskfwvyqbw.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Finally we have Rolaren the Fierce, the mage. She has flame, shock and frost magic, though she seems to favor shock magic a little more (but she does use all of em). Due to her blindness, she has spentmost of her time indoors, resulting in a lighter skin tone than her parallel “sisters”. She is located inthe College of Winterhold, in the Arceaneum. When it comes to shick magic, he Emperor has got nothing on this high elf. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]CREDITS: \r<br />\r<br />[/color]Thanks to ThisTimeIBeAGoodGirlSir for all the help and the wonderful version of Rolaryn, and to Sleepytigereyes, and Ashes2Asherz for all the help they also gave me while developing these girls.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Skyla Skyrim for visual help in her tutorial - \r<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcHw4sqrrx8\r<br />\r<br />At least one of these girls was made with the Make a follower kit, get it here- - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76828/?\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=5]Shadowfake, since the nina preset was originally used in Rolaryns construction http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52800/?\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]SeveNBase a custom FemaleBodyReplacer by Crosscrusade DeMoNhUnTeR1986\r<br /> \r<br />Sevennity - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36992/?\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]Demoniac- High Quality Glossy Female Body Texture 8K 4K 2K by Regenbot03 - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70834/?\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]Eye Normal Map Fix by Mr Dave - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54416/?\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]Celes Nightingale Armor UUNP - CBBE by Deserter X - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67595/?\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]ousnius and gamefever - for UUNP Bodyslide data (nsk13 armor)[/size][size=5]BodySlide and Outfit Studio by Ousnius and Caliente - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49015/?\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]NifSkope - http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]NPC Nif Merge by Turulo - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40494/?\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]TES5Edit by ElminsterAU - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/?\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]Merge Plugins xEdit Script by matortheeternal - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37981/?\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]Skyrim by Bethesda\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]Creation Kit by Bethesda[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />[/size]",
