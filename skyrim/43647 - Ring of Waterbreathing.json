  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to my little simple second mod :)\r\n\r\nI know that there\\'s the Necklace of Waterbreathing in the game, but i searched every merchant or corner of Skyrim to find it, so i decided to make something similar from myself, and i like to share it :)\r\nIt\\'s easy to craft, you only need a steel ingot and a slaughterfish scale, it doesn\\'t require particular perks to be crafted, and it is light armored!!\r\nStandalone, the ring is craftable under Jewelry section.\r\nIt can be disenchanted and the waterbreahting enchantment can be applied on every piece of armor or cloth, and the ring can be equipped by males and females.\r\nEverything is vanilla from the main game, so no DLC or SKSE required.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it, and if you like it, please endorse, thanks :)\r\n\r\nAbout permissions for using this mod, please see the related section.\r\n\r\nMy thanks and credits go to Bethesda that created Skyrim and the Creation Kit, and to Haldir307 for his tutorial on how to make standalone armors and weapons.",
