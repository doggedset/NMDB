  "descriptionHtml": "First I&#39;d like to mention that I have these DLCs installed: Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn. Chances are that this &#34;mod&#34; works without them too - but I can&#39;t guarantee that. Just try it.\r<br />\r<br />[Update-2016-05-16]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/8814176]ABlindSniper115[/url] reported issues with reappearing dirt that he could fix by using [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url]. Since I&#39;m using that too I think it&#39;s worth to be mentioned. Sorry to all commenters for not getting back to you - I didn&#39;t get any notifications about new posts, but I will check my settings here.\r<br />[/Update]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Conny Bengtsson&#39;s &#34;No dirt on vampire faces&#34; I had almost no trouble creating this and don&#39;t deserve much credit (other than preparing the female version for others).\r<br />\r<br />While Conny Bengtsson&#39;s mod just replaces the male texture, this &#34;mod&#34; replaces the texture for both genders: maleheaddirt_01.dds and femaleheaddirt_01.dds\r<br />\r<br />In case you didn&#39;t read Conny Bengtsson&#39;s description: All characters in the game that use this dirt texture will be &#34;cleaned&#34;. Whoever they might be. But be honest - who likes muddy people anyways? Skyrim is dirty enough - I don&#39;t see a reason why people should be unable to wash their darn faces.\r<br />\r<br />To get rid of the vampire&#39;s cleft lip I installed various other mods that I&#39;ll list below. For this reason your vampire probably won&#39;t look as beautiful as mine. But at least it will be clean :p\r<br />\r<br />Mods that influenced my screenshots:\r<br />» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812]Better Females by Bella[/url] - No makeup, just improved textures\r<br />» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26113]Better Females by Bella - Natural Edition[/url] - New Normalmaps\r<br />» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26838]Vampire Ugly Face Remover[/url] - Dawnguard",
