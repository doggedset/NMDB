  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff0000][size=5]Jrews Smithing Immersion Mod\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][size=3][color=#ffffff]Why: I made this up because I as a modder had almost 20+ armor and weapon mods, which can add up a lot. So I wanted something in which I could add all the mods under one, manually. This mod sets a base for that, with a few extra tweaks. Smithing is also very easy, probably the easiest skill to rank up. So I wanted some extra steps into the process. \r<br />Things added Arrow heads, arrow rods, Plated core, molded blades and hilts, chainmail, studs. \r<br />\r<br />What: Yes, I basically took all vanilla items and changed the way they are forged, and recipes and tempering. For example, an iron dagger, was iron ingot and leatherstrips, but now has a hilt and blade, instead of an ingot. To temper, I added to all the non Bow weapons, Spriggan sap, to add as a honing solution.I also added more taproots, and a way to make sap(see images).\r<br />\r<br />[/color]REMEMBER::::::: This changes all Vanilla, and DlC weapons and armor, except enchanted ones. Plus all the Recipes and tempering. Anything that alters these vanilla stuff will more and likely be incompatible with other mods that effect these.\r<br />\r<br />Locations: I went through many places, to accompany a tailoring bench and spinning wheel, at places where there is a forge, even adding some stuff in Ivarstead, at Klimmeks house.[/size]",
