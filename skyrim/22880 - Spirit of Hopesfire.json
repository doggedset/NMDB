  "descriptionHtml": "A result of a little mess around on the CK, this adds a deadric sword that appears slightly ghostly, although not to the extent the bound sword does, and has the bound sword\\'s blueish flames (see comparison picture).\r\n\r\nIn can be found on the top floor of \\\"The Drunken Huntsmen\\\" in Whiterun, in the bedroom bit. Unfortunately, it cannot be enchanted*. To compensate, I\\'ve raised the base damage to 17 from I think 14.\r\n\r\n*It is however destroyable. If you wish to do this (or add another via console) you can learn its affect and enchant other weapons with the \\\"boundswordfx\\\" effect, which can give weapons an odd looking appearance. For example, one of the images I\\'ve taken shows a silver sword with this enchantment.",
