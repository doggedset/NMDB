  "summary": "My first mod which, in the first phase, aims to expand on the towns and cities of skyrim, expanding the existing families, organising them into relations, giving them faction uniforms, homes, forts etc In the second phase adding random events, a few festivals/weddings/parties/battles/inter-clan politics/and quests of course.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I love skyrim, and mods only make it cooler. There are many excellent mods out there that make Skyrim better and that I have enhanced my gaming experience and I just wanted to give something back to the community.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is in pre alpha, I&#39;ve just finished the story and all the characters and started work from Riverwood. Just looking for some feedback, ideas, bugs etc\r<br />\r<br />What it does (will update this as I go):-\r<br />1) Added 10 houses to Riverwood (interiors not &#34;attached&#34; yet), moved fortifications outwards to the south and east, added new fortification across the river to the east and west. \r<br />\r<br />2) Added 7 NPCs with basic routines and generic dialogue (will do the story stuff after I finish constructing the village)\r<br />\r<br />3) Relevant clutter to each house depending on who is/will be living in it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
