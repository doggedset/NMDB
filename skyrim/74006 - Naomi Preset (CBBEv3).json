  "descriptionHtml": "This is probably the best thing I&#39;ve ever made with my life tbh. But nonetheless, I give to you, Naomi, my personal and fully customization preset for RaceMenu (only compatible with CBBE of any kind). At first, I got bored just walking around looking at eye candied 4K textures, but then I realized, what am I doing with my life? I thought to myself I can either sit here and look at glorious textures, or I could create something absolutely beautiful. In my case, I did just that.  \r<br />\r<br />Good note - If anyone is willing to make this preset into a follower, I grant, by all means, permission to edit and redistribute for all I ask is credit.\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t know if this is just me, but whenever I try to download my own file, it doens&#39;t show the .jslot and ReadMe.txt. But if anyone can tell me it works for them, that would be great. Just a first mod Jewbie over here.\r<br />\r<br />This isn&#39;t just a face model, but more of a whole body model (which the body is a work-in progress, but not fucked up in any way).  This mod uses a lot of different textures to create the final product and which ones you use is your choice completely. I&#39;m just here to recommend mods to get or close as possible to my character without it looking like a screaming banshee with down syndrome (sorry).\r<br />\r<br />If there seems to be any bugs, please let me know and how much you hate it (you won&#39;t, you don&#39;t have the nose). Also, feel free to send screen shots of your beautified character.\r<br />\r<br />Recommended Settings for Character: I might as well do this before I get asked questions, so I&#39;ll go through all the hair styles I think go best with the preset. Keep in mind that I only have the vanilla and KS Hairdo&#39;s hairs installed, and not Apachii SkyHair. The slots are: 54, 101, 113, 114, 115, 116, 126,\r<br />138, 140, 149, 155, 166, 167, 435. If you recommend any hairs from any other hair mods, please let me know and I&#39;ll come up with an update list.\r<br />\r<br />Required Mods (Mostly for compatible scripting, compatible fixing, editing, and actual requirements).\r<br />\r<br />1.

If this is found in the Steam Workshop, my work has been stolen, or uploaded to anywhere bu this original source.\r<br />\r<br />Q: On a scale from 9 to 11, how dank are your memes?\r<br />A: I wish I could count that high.\r<br />\r<br />Q: What race is this preset for?\r<br />A: Nord. I do not plan on doing it for other races, but if you have the willpower, you&#39;ll do it eventually.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Do you take requests for presets?\r<br />A: Yes, I do, actually. I do anywhere from beauty teens to your favorite por***** uh, you know where I&#39;m going with this. (What you do during 12-3).\r<br />\r<br />Q: Was that last question a real question?\r<br />A: Yes, I don&#39;t have anything else to do with my life, so I might as well create anything given by the beautiful users. Even if it does include, uh, that.\r<br />\r<br />Q: How do we send requests?\r<br />A: Send me a picture of the face, because I can&#39;t do anything with bodies, and I&#39;ll sculpt it. (I swear, if you send me a c*mshot of the person , I&#39;ll die, lol).[url=http://textsmili.es/]\r<br />[/url]",
