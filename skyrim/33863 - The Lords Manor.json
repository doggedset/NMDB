  "descriptionHtml": "Not updated for a few weeks because currently I got quite a few exams. The last one is on the 23rd so hopefully I can get back to polishing the mod then. Might be a few updates every so often before though.\r\n\r\nContact me at:\r\nTwitter: Ninjaofsomewhere (@Ninja_Somewhere)\r\nNexus: Just send me a PM on the forums\r\nSteam and Youtube: Ninjaofsomewhere\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who endorsed! :D\r\n[Img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/images/4608987-1364195280.jpg[/Img]\r\n\r\nA mod made for Chayification over on Youtube at his request. \r\nThe house is located on an island off the coast of Raven Rock in Solstheim and therefore obviously requires the Dragonborn DLC. Refer to the images for the location. \r\nAt this was made for one person in mind, but made public, some parts of the mod may not appeal to you. \r\nThis house was made with a mage character in mind, but there is still storage for weapons and plenty of places to craft. So this should be fine for all types of characters.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nDragonborn. Yeah that\\'s it. Have fun.\r\n\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/images/4608987-1364196332.jpg[/img]\r\nIf you make a video about this mod and want it featured here, post in the comments with a link and I\\'ll check it out.\r\n\r\nThanks to Chayification for the great video!\r\n[youtube]U-46CSHEaHg[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[Img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/images/4608987-1364195841.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nNeed a place to stay and don\\'t want to pay those hefty inn prices (10 gold)? \r\nNeed a place to store all your precious loot that you \\'found\\' traveling that wasteland called \\'Solstheim\\'?\r\nNeed a place to be anti-social in Skyrim and hide from all those peasants who don\\'t worship you at all?\r\nWell then this house is what you may or may not have been what your looking for! \r\n\r\nThis is my first house mod and features everything a Dovahkiin needs. Ranging from storage to crafting to a place to stay for the night. Free of charge. I swear. Don\\'t question the Lord! He won\\'t make you pay your precious gold!\r\n\r\nThis mod was constructed by the dedicated (oppressed) Peasents of Chayification, countless hours have gone in to the construction of Lord Chay\\'s Manor and it is finally complete. And available for your dragonborn needs.\r\n\r\nI do want to point out this mod is not fully complete, but I feel it is at a stage where it can be uploaded. In the next update, if you have stored any books in the library I would remove them as the update will be replacing the bookshelves. If there is any other updates, I would suggest checking the mod page to make sure it will not remove any of your stuff. Report any issues to via twitter, PM or in the comments.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1279.photobucket.com/albums/y521/Ninjaofsomewhere/Deed_zpsc4442f4d.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1279.photobucket.com/albums/y521/Ninjaofsomewhere/Featuresheading_zps9a4ba609.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n1 Large Player Home\r\n    -1 Throne\r\n    -1 Library\r\n    -1 Forge\r\n    -1 Master Bedroom\r\n1 Camp Site\r\n2 Forges\r\n2 Tanning Racks\r\n3 Enchanting Tables\r\n3 Alchemy Tables\r\n1 Staff Enchanter\r\n1 Smelter\r\n2 Grindstones\r\n24 Bookcases\r\nMany chests for all that precious loot.\r\nFood!

(At least for me)\r\n\r\nThe mannequin\\'s may move. I recommend using this mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10652\r\n\r\nAs of the 1.5 update, the markers in the library collide with the player allowing them not to work in certain small spaces.\r\n\r\nIf you encounter anymore issues, please inform me of them over twitter, through a message, or in the comments section. Try to be as clear and detailed as possible so I can fix any issue quicker or offer a fix for the problem.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1279.photobucket.com/albums/y521/Ninjaofsomewhere/Changelogheader_zps00cde9d2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nVersion v1.7\r\n\r\n--FANCY CANDLE HOLDERS!
