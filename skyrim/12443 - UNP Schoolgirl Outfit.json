  "summary": "Schoolgirl outfit. Nuff said?",
  "descriptionHtml": "CBBE/MAK version as well as an updated UNP version are now available as an add on for Bathing Beauties or Beefcake Luxury Suite (BBLS). The CBBE/MAK version and possibly (in the near future) the UNP version will be exclusive to that mod. Why? Try it out and I think you will understand.\r\n\r\nBBLS here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11427\r\n\r\n\r\nNot Lore friendly. Eyecandy. Fun and Sexy. Technically clothing but it has a low armor value added for two reasons. One, so your companions will wear it. Two, so that it\\'s not like you\\'re completely naked if you get in a fight wearing it :D\r\n\r\nThe name for it in your inventory is just School Outfit. Wouldn\\'t want your big hulking male character or male followers wearing something called \\\"Schoolgirl\\\" now would we? On male characters it will appear as fine clothes.\r\n\r\nProvided as is. I like it. I use it. If someone makes a super cool suggestion for improving it I will take a look. Otherwise - use it or don\\'t. I only post mods when I think I can give something back to the Nexus Community.  \r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUpdate 1:  Normal map update reduces shine on skirt and leggings. Now they have a cloth look rather than a latex look. Only needed for the original UNP Schoolgirl Outfit file.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2:  Added new main file \\\"Schoolgirl Outfit plus SkyHeels\\\". Adds one pair of black and one pair of gold SkyHeels to the chest in Riverwood. Overwrites UNP Schoolgirl Outfit if you have that installed.\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nHow to get it:  \r\n\r\nSchoolgirl chest located in Riverwood around the corner from the steps to the sawmill contains two outfits. You will walk right past it on the way to talk to Gerdur if you follow the Stormcloak during the Unbound quest.\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nInstall: \r\n\r\nUnzip and drop contents into Data folder. Check Schoolgirl.esp in launcher or NMM.\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nUninstall:\r\n \r\nDelete SchoolgirlOutfit.esp from your Skyrim\\\\Data folder. Delete the Schoolgirl folders from Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\clothes and Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\clothes.\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCredits/Thanks:\r\n\r\ndimon99 for his UNP Body and clothing resoures\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6709\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11882\r\n\r\nelectronis for allowing use of his SkyHeels assets\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5589\r\n\r\nThor925 my modding mentor - it\\'s his fault I play at this :)\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLegal/usage:\r\n\r\nMeshes originally belong to dimon99. So, usage for them is according to the standards he set for his DIMclothes SET1 DIMONIZED UNP clothing resources found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11882\r\n\r\nAdditional mesh usage - Schoolgirl meshes were edited and combined by me in Nifskope.
