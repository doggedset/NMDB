So, that&#39;s exactly what i did&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; \r<br />\r<br />I have added 3 new spells (same as bound weapons but voice) to the game, the sword is Sukriiviing&#39;s Sword, the battleaxe is Sukriiviing&#39;s Battleaxe, and the bow is as you may have guessed Sukriiviing&#39;s Bow. \r<br />\r<br />I named these weapons after my character Sukriiviing, which means in the dragon tongue: Winged-Air-Killer, clever right? I might make a new version when the bow is better and the names will be changed. \r<br />\r<br />I shortened the bow&#39;s time because if you sheathe it, it doesnt disappear and neither do the arrows. So... ENJOY&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; \r<br />\r<br />To get the spells, you need to press ~ then type /help &#34;Sukriiviing&#34;",
