  "modName": "Cancel Spells Early",
  "summary": "Stop spells whenever you wish instead of waiting for them to expire.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I found it annoying that a spellcaster could not \\\"release\\\" the spells he/she had cast before the normal expiration. \r\nThis mod adds a lesser power that will allow you to cancel spells early.  The spells you want to cancel must be equipped, in either hand, when the power is used.  The power won\\'t do anything if an equipped spell is not active.  If you have different spells equipped in each hand, both will be canceled.  \r\nIf you have two of the same kind of summons (Twin Souls), both will be unsummoned.\r\n\r\nThe power will only cancel spells that attach to the caster.  Spells which modify other actors will not be canceled.\r\nSpells that can be canceled:  \r\nAlteration - Candlelight, \\\"skin\\\" spells\r\nDestruction - cloak spells \r\nIllusion - invisibility, muffle\r\nConjuration - summons\r\nRestoration - protection circle spells\r\n\r\nSpells NOT canceled:\r\nspells with no duration \r\nbound weapons \r\nspells that affect other characters \r\nMagelight \r\nDestruction \\\"wall\\\" spells\r\n\r\nSpells that execute script effects may, or may not, be canceled.  \r\n\r\nHope you find it as useful as I have.\r\nUsual disclaimer - this mod shouldn\\'t break anything and should be worth at least as much as you\\'ve paid for it.\r\nDo not upload this mod anywhere besides the Nexus.\r\n\r\nChange Log:\r\n1.0 - Initial Version\r\n1.01 - Added missing script\r\n1.02 - Added quest script for auto-add",
