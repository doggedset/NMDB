  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG=left]http://i62.tinypic.com/effjaa.jpg[/IMG]This is a video tutorial about creating seamless textures. I won&#39;t make a text document because I don&#39;t have the time, hence the video. If someone wants to, be my guest.[/center]I am not comfortable with speaking, I will state that clear. This is also my first time making a video so it may not be superb. I just know that there are a lot of talented modders out there but seams seem (no pun) to plague all. So I&#39;ve constantly been searching for a way to get rid of them. Here&#39;s my way. Maybe there is a better one, I do not know. If there is please comment cause I cannot find another soul to tell me.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-8.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/thumbnails/63339-1-1425661738.png[/img][img]http://static-8.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/thumbnails/63339-2-1425661738.png[/img][img]http://static-5.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/thumbnails/63339-1-1425662120.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s still the meshes.
