  "descriptionHtml": "Enhanced Hotpools by Ja-Kha\\'jay\r\n\r\nEver wanted to kick back and relax in the hotpools in Eastmarch? Now you can! This mod enhances the hotpool camp so your Dovahkiin can sit down and simmer.\r\n\r\nAdds a few partially hidden rock chairs around the hotpool edges that your Dragonborn can sit on and relax. They shouldn\\'t be too difficult to find at the hunter\\'s camp. Just click and sit, nice and easy. Also added are some extra furniture markers that NPCs can interact with, but not the Dragonborn.\r\nEnhanced Hotpools was designed for use with King Coin\\'s \\'Followers can Relax\\' mod, but is completely separate. I repeat, EH is not dependant on FCR. FCR is the reason I added the extra markers, so now you and your companion can relax in the hot springs until you\\'re both all pruned up.\r\n\r\nEnhanced Hotpools is also available on the Nexus:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12006\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=14483\r\n\r\nRecommended to run alongside Enhanced Hotpools:\r\n\r\nFollowers can Relax by King Coin: \r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=12466\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9504 \r\n\r\nA Shack by the Springs by Throttlekitty:\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=7380\r\n\r\nDependancies: None\r\n\r\nClashes: None that I am aware of\r\n\r\nBugs: Some folks have experienced a texture mismatch with the new NPCs. This can be fixed by downloading the relevant files from the Nexus (see above link). \r\nSometimes the Argonian spawns high up in the air and plunges to his death, no idea why.\r\nSometimes the script wasn\\'t included in the BSA file. This has been fixed as of Revision 6. This should also fix the texture mismatch.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevision 2: Replaces the Dwemer chairs with actual rocks that the Dragonborn can sit on. Also adds a map marker for the Hotsprings Camp.\r\n\r\nRevision 3: Tweaked map marker so it faces the camp on fast travel. Added some lights for night time atmosphere. Added the Well Rested bonus for sitting on the rocks, called Relaxed.\r\n\r\nRevision 4: Tweaked the Navmesh so followers no longer get stuck (on the mesh at least) when running with FCR. Replaced the invisible chair markers with EH variants, which allows the follower to strip even if they don\\'t activate a rock chair.\r\n\r\nRevision 5: Redid the way the  rock chairs and other markers apply the Well Rested bonus and Stripping script, so that they strip every time they activate the marker (it never used to reapply it while the spell was already in effect). The Relaxed Bonus has been replaced with the proper Well Rested Bonus. Added more clutter, more rock chairs and an extra marker. Added three more bathers (which revealed some hilarious vanilla dialogue not normally spoken). Added a cooking pot. Tweaked the Navmesh again so NPCs didn\\'t get stuck on the chairs as often.\r\n\r\nRevision 6: Resolved issue where actors would not strip when sitting on the rocks. This was due to a bug with the CK where it didn\\'t pack the script files, so I\\'ve manually created a new BSA. The Nexus version contains the loose files, which may change once I start working on Revision 7.\r\n\r\nRevision 7: Set the Hunters as essential so their bodies won\\'t clutter up the hot pools in the event of a dragon attack. Added an Alchemy Lab. Tweaked the Navmesh again. The Nexus version has the new bsa included rather than loose files.\r\n\r\nGirls Only Edition: Only available on the Nexus, and sorted under misc files, Girls Only is an all female hunter\\'s camp, with both the modded and stock dudes gone. GOE will not be receiving any updates. It also cannot be run alongside the main file. To get GOE running correctly (stripping correctly) download Revision 6 and replace the esp with the GOE esp.\r\n\r\nCredits: Rock Chair model and Script by CuChullain at the Skyrim Nexus, used with permission. Thanks a bunch, dude!\r\n\r\nOn a final note: 2000 subscribers on the Steam Workshop! Here you go, since you are all awesome:\r\n[URL=http://jakhajay.deviantart.com/art/Hot-Pool-Mayhem-289623145] Hot Pool Mayhem [/URL]\r\n",
