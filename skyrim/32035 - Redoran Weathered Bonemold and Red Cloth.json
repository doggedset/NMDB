  "summary": "Give a more \\\"royal\\\" look to Redoran guards. A retexture of bonemold armour especially for redoran guards.",
  "descriptionHtml": "DRAGONBORN DLC REQUIRED\r\n\r\nI\\'ve retextured \\\"Dragonborn DLC Armor Retexture\\\" of the bonemold armour so its more realistic and impressive at the same time. the link is\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31225\r\n\r\n-Retextured the redoran guards waistcloth and captain\\'s shoulder mantle so it\\'s red colour. I\\'ve read this is the official colour of House redoran.\r\n\r\n-Put \\\"dirt\\\" and wear marks on it to suit the dusty environment these dudes live in.\r\n\r\n-Weathered the bonemold armor and added greyish tints on the existing bone colour, particularly places like the lower parts of boots the knee pads, the palms of the gauntlets and the shield handle.\r\n\r\n-Tweaked the visor on the helmet so it seems like a protective tinted glass instead of a gray emptyness.I didn\\'t know how to add shine on it but it seems pretty good to me.\r\n\r\n-Inner side of the shield is black at some places, not because of me but of the game. \r\n\r\nMost of the screenshots are shot at nighttime and I carry a travel lantern.\r\n\r\n\r\nManual Installation (Gopher\\'s way):\r\n\r\nGo to NMM and click on add mod from file (the puzzle bit with the plus sign button at the upper left corner). Find the folder where you\\'ve put the downloaded .rar file ( preferably a SkyrimMods folder), click on it and then click Open. Then activate. Run the Installer of TESVSkyrim and then hit play.\r\nIf you have skse installed, rather than hit play, exit the installer and double click the skse.exe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to bethesda for this epic game and to the release of the creation kit.\r\nThanks to all the modders who inspired me to start modding too,\r\nespecialy to Gopher whose method of installation of the compressed files in NMM has been a real lifesaver and also for the instructions of how to install the SKSE. All these are explained in his videos.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/38219\r\n\r\nPlease visit my other mods too. Don\\'t forget to endorse.",
