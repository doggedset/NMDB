  "summary": "Makes Winterhold even more trashed.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I saw a few mods which made Winterhold look rebuilt, but none that trashed it even more. This mod adds on to the design for Winterhold turning it into a ruined port of call. I added several things to the design just for laughs and giggles and here they are listed:\r\n\r\nFerros Light House\r\nThe Winterhold Docks\r\nThe Winterhold Cranes\r\nUpped the Defenses by adding ruined stone battlements and recently built stockades. \r\n\r\nThis mod was meant to be released as it is now as an aesthetic alteration to the area. No new creatures, patrols, guards, loot, etc were added. You are free to take this mod and add onto it at your leisure. Just mention me in your credits.\r\n\r\nRequires: Skyrim Esm\r\nInstillation: Drop the esp in the Data Folder and check it off like normal\r\n",
