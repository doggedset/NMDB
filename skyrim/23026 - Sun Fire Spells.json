  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first TES mod ever made (and will probably be my last)... Please report any odd things that might occur. \r\n\r\nChanges the in-game Dawnguard spells: Sun Fire, Vampire\\'s Bane, and Stendaar\\'s Aura to now damage all targets and their damage has also been pumped up. Gives a \\\"Holy Warrior/Mage\\\" something interesting to do outside of destruction. \r\nThe spells still belong to the Restoration school and I also upped the damage on them considering the lack of an impact talent in the restoration tree.\r\nThe spells can be found where they normally would in their respective Fort Dawnguard vendors.\r\nOR You could simply just cheat if you wanted to be a Vampire Sun blasting ninja.",
