  "descriptionHtml": "==========================\r<br />Complete Custom Race Stats\r<br />==========================\r<br />Complete Custom Race Stats is designed to let you RE SPEC your character anyway you want. Allowing you to choose your racial ability, what your base skill levels start at ( 0 or 15), and let&#39;s you pick where you want your 35 initial skill levels points to go.\r<br />\r<br />*MUST START A NEW GAMEPLAY&#33; \r<br />*Complete Custom Race Stats is triggered after the character creation menu and before the executioners block. When your standing in line.\r<br />\r<br />==========\r<br />FEATURES\r<br />==========\r<br />- Reset Skills to 0 or 15\r<br />- Choose Any Race Ability\r<br />- Re Spec your initial 35 skill points for ANY class to any combination of skills you want.&#39;\r<br />- No .bat files, no console commands, ALL menu based.\r<br />\r<br />===================\r<br />STAT CALCULATIONS\r<br />===================\r<br />Some users where confused on how the stats are set. I hope this explains it better.\r<br />Based off of vanilla preset stats, all races start with a base of 15 in each skill. Each race also has predefined stats increasing certain skills based on the class selection example(Nord starts with +10 in two handed. This makes two-handed 25. the base + 10)\r<br />\r<br />Complete custom race stats does the same thing, except allowing you to choose what you want.\r<br />You select the BASE number (0 or 15). Then when selecting your skill levels.....lets say you choose 10 in alteration and you chose 15 as your base stat\r<br />the base(15) + the number you choose(10) = 25. So your starting skill level would be 25 for alteration. Now...you have only used 10 points, you still can use another 25 points into other skills.\r<br />\r<br />SOOOOO....\r<br />\r<br />BASE SKILL LEVEL + AMOUNT YOU WANT TO ADD = STARTING SKILL LEVEL\r<br />\r<br />=========\r<br />THANKS\r<br />=========\r<br />If you enjoyed my mod please endorse it&#33;",
