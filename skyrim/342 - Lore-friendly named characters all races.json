  "descriptionHtml": "FINAL UPDATE RELEASED - BOTH GENDERS COMPLETE IN ALL RACES\r\n\r\n20 distinctive characters (a male and female from each race) with lore-friendly names. Start in Riverwood on level 3 - 5 with no quests done.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind all this is that I don\\'t like having one character that does everything in one playthrough and ends up becoming an all-round master in everything. I find it much more immersive to create different characters and play a different storyline with each. For example, out of these 7 characters there is a warrior suited for the fighters guild, a mage for the College of Winterhold, a thief for the Thieve\\'s guild, an assassin for the Dark Brotherhood, a Nord for the Stormcloaks, an Imperial for the Legion and a Khajiit as an alternative thief character. Besides this each of these characters can still do anything else you want. It\\'s a really fun way of playing. You obviously don\\'t have to do this. You can still play the character the way you want, it\\'s just a neat idea.\r\n\r\nAll I\\'ve done in each of these saved games was sell all the loot from Helgen\\'s Keep and buy or loot some appropriate gear for each character to start with. They each also start with close to a thousand gold. No cheats were used. The perks I\\'ve chosen for the characters so far are to sort of lead you into the intended play style that I created that character for.\r\n\r\nMEET THE CHARACTERS!\r\n\r\nMALES\r\n\r\n1. Ogrug Bolak, the Orc warrior.\r\nThis guy likes his heavy armor and two-handed weaponry. No magic, no sneaking, no bows. (He still has a bow in his inventory if you absolutely NEED it, but I recommend selling it and buying some meat and ale for this hardcore fighter.)\r\n\r\n2. Aldaril, the High Elf pure mage.\r\nThis guy has never swung a weapon or fired an arrow in his entire life. He specializes in destruction at the moment, but that can be changed. He also has a bow if you feel the need for it, and he\\'s sporting two daggers for some dual wielding action. Basically, if you want to play this game as intended, he should never have a shield or any armor. Lots of fun to play.\r\n\r\n3. Elberond, the sneaky Wood Elf hunter/archer.\r\nThis little fellow can become a thief or an assassin, or both. Assassin recommended. He is meant to kill most of his targets with sneak attacks with a bow from far away. He also has a sword and shield for when you run out of arrows and a dagger for up close stealth kills. \r\n\r\n4. Lurks-In-Shadow, the Argonian thief/assassin.\r\nI\\'m very happy with how this guy turned out. He\\'s a sneaky one and will probably make a better thief than assassin, but he can be both. He has daggers for dual-wielding, but you can get him some swords or something if you want. I just like the idea of daggers. He also has a bow, which is recommended to be used frequently to increase his skill in it. He knows a thing or two about magic as well if you want to be a sneaky mage. Basically, he\\'s the most versatile character. \r\n\r\n5.Qanaro, the not-so-cute kitty cat (He\\'s a Khajiit, in case you were wondering.)\r\nHere we have another stealthy character. He has the highest sneak skill of them all and I got lucky and received an enchanted sneak ring by asking Hod\\'s wife for assistance so it\\'s even better still. His claw attacks are also completely badass, making him my favourite character of the bunch so far.\r\n\r\n6.Agning, the hardened Nord warrior.\r\nThis guy was created with the Stormcloak questline in mind, but I entered Helgen\\'s keep with Hadvar instead of Ralof because it\\'s easier to get appropriate weapons and armor that way. He is very viking-looking and prefers two-handed weapons and light armor.\r\n\r\n7.Cidius Mero, the poorly paid Legionnaire.\r\nI think I achieved a very Roman look on this guy and I\\'m quite proud of it! He starts off with very little gold because Legion armor is expensive to craft and upgrade! Kind of realistic, though. Just imagine he\\'s being paid a lousy soldier\\'s salary. :) Created with the Legion questline in mind, but I entered Helgen\\'s keep with Ralof instead of Hadvar because it\\'s easier to get appropriate weapons and armor that way. Prefers his heavy Legion armor and shield because he spent all his gold buying and crafting/upgrading them.\r\n\r\n8.Astien, the Breton spellsword.\r\nThis elderly Breton is good with a blade in the one hand and a spell in the other. No shields or bows required!\r\n\r\n9.Vilvanil, the sneaky Dark Elf Necromancer.\r\nNeedless to say, he specializes in Conjuration. Once you find some bound weapon spells, you can just throw away that sword and go pure mage, baby!\r\n\r\n10.Waylas, the Redguard fighter.\r\nHis skills are ideal for a versatile player. One-handed, Block, Sneak, Archery, Destruction and Smithing are all specialities of this character. What more could you need? Plus, he has a kickass beard.\r\n\r\nFEMALES\r\n\r\n(They are the same saved games as the males so there is no need to describe them, just read the description of their male counterpart. All I did was take the male saved games and used the \\\"showracemenu\\\" command to turn them into females without changing their race and messing up their skill points, then renamed them and saved again.)\r\n\r\n1.Uloth Murgol, Orc warrior.\r\n\r\n2.Virani, High Elf pure mage.\r\n\r\n3.Eldunari, Wood Elf hunter/archer.\r\n\r\n4.Deesei, Argonian thief/assassin.\r\n\r\n5.Zahraji, Khajiit thief/assassin.\r\n\r\n6.Haema, Nord (for Stormcloak questline.)\r\n\r\n7.Sabrin Herennius, Imperial (for Legion questline.)\r\n\r\n8.Derene, Breton spellsword.\r\n\r\n9.Noldyn, Dark Elf Necromancer.\r\n\r\n10.Lairah, Redguard warrior.",
