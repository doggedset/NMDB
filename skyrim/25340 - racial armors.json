  "descriptionHtml": "ever wish you could have more imperial luck  or more fire from ancestors wrath. WELL NOW YOU CAN!!! introducing racial armor. these armors increase the power of all but two player races (i couldn\\'t get a good effect for orc\\'s and the breton armor doesn\\'t work). You can craft all these armor at any forge also you must be the same race as the race the armor was made for. (i.e only imperials can craft racial imperial armor) i really hope you like this it took a lot longer then i thought it would. but i had fun and that\\'s all that matter. have fun ^_^.\r\n\r\np.s if something like a helmet or boot\\'s or something doesn\\'t apper in the same group as the other armor pieces then just go to the bottom of the list and it will be there.\r\n\r\np.s.s: yes i did ask premision before i used psychosteves mask",
