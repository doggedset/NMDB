  "descriptionHtml": "I felt something was missing from Argonians-- for a race of primeval lizard people, they seem awfully human-shaped. So, I made new Argonian-specific models for all of the boots and shoes in the game with a look inspired by the always popular velociraptor.\r\n\r\nNote that this will conflict with any mod that alters boots, shoes or feet, so make sure it loads last. Also, please let me know if you find any clipping or incorrect model issues.",
