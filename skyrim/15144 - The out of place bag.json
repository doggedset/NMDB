  "modName": "The out of place bag",
  "summary": "- adds a new weapon, sheild and armor set to Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "no-one know why Odin threw away his first set of armor. No-one know were it went, either. Well, they do. They\\'re just too lazy to come the nirn to get it. After the attack at Helgen, the Dovakiin was a bit jumpy. not so suprising he didn\\'t notice the bag in the middle of the road near the gate into Riverwood.\r\n\r\nContains:\r\n\r\nHjeartsbane - The sword of the mighty warrior Gundar, coated in the venom of the basilisk Valganor, parylising unlucky victims in preparation to be consumed alive.\r\n\r\nVroengarde - The mighty shield of the afore mentioned warrior, it is somehow imbued with a frost rune, granting it 70% frost resistance.\r\n\r\nAesir-god forged armor. - stronger and lighter then thier mortal-forged equivelents, they also have some interesting properties:\r\n\r\nCuirass and leggings: encorages the wearers\\' body to heal with more finess, increasing heal-rate by 70%\r\n\r\nBoots:Through magics unknown, these boots cleanse the wearer\\' bloodstream of fatigue poisons much faster than the body can alone, increasing stamina recovery by 70%\r\n\r\nGaunlets: These are by far the most intreguing of the armor pieces. They some how tap into the wearer\\'s aura, harnessing it mush more effectively than the mind is capable of, increasing magika recovery by 70%\r\n\r\nP.S. it\\'s my first mod okay, so go easy.\r\n\r\nBUG!!! when you pick up the kit, all the guards disappear out of riverwood. dunno why, but the shifty player might take advantage of this...",
