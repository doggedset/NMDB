So no fancy stuff here. This by no means mean that it's not an interesting town. It has some unique features. And since Winterhold has so little action in terms of population, I added this town to that hold. It's a little town that was build around the Corundum mine.\n<br />\n<br />If you like the mod, then please endorse so we can spread the happiness!\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]n6vdUsSBSmY[/youtube][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=4][center]Requirements[/center][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3]Just the latest Skyrim (Original)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][center][color=#00ffff]Features[/color][/center][/size]\n<br />[size=3]A full living breathing town, where the NPC's have their own life's.\n<br />\n<br />* There is an inn. Here you can rent a room, or get bounty quests from the innkeeper.\n<br />* There is a blacksmith in town, but because he mostly services the mine tools, he has set up shop in the mine itself. So that's where you will find him.\n<br />* There is a 'Miscellanous' merchant in town. His shop is outside even if the weather is really bad. He tries to be a true Nord.\n<br />* The town guards that changes with the war factions.\n<br />* There is also a sad past to the town, being supporters of the Stormcloaks (since they are so close to Windhelm) and you will find the graves and destroyed house showing a glimps of that.\n<br />* A (sort of hidden) Talos shrine.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4][center][color=#00ffff]Compatibility[/color][/center][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Runs with anything except something that might be placed in the same space.\n<br />\n<br />Anything that delete the guard spawns at Whistling Mine will influence the guards at Overstead.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4][center][color=#00ffff]Installation[/color][/center][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Automatic  Download with NMM\n<br />- Click the Download with manager button on top of the file.\n<br />- Overstead will appear in the NMM's Mods list once it's downloaded.

That's the same as deleting your safe file.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][center][color=#00ffff]Known Issues[/color][/center][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Let me know if you find any.\n<br />\n<br />There is a spawn location in town, that usually I would just move, but this one seems to be connected to something else, maybe even a quest, so I decided to leave it as is. This only means that when arriving in town, anything can spawn in town. Be aware of it.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4][center][color=#00ffff]Notes[/color][/center][/size]\n<br />[size=3]Always save and backup your save files before trying out new mods!\n<br />\n<br />I didn't add any scripts, so the file should be safe. I did make adjustments to the terrain and navmesh. I didn't change the vanilla navmesh, just moved it out of the way, and handmade my own new navmesh for affected areas.\n<br />\n<br />Most of the NPC's are essential, so they won't die. That's just the way I like to do it.\n<br />\n<br />There are currently no quests from this town other than the bounty quests. Its just a town as any other in the game.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][center][color=#00ffff]Change Log[/color][/center][/size]\n<br />[size=3]1.0 Initial release[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][center][color=#00ffff]Legal / Licence / Permission[/color][/center][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]If you want to change my mod, or add anything to it, ask me 1st.
