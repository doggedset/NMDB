  "descriptionHtml": "this mod was simply made because many players commented on my other mod \\\"Stronger Arrows+\\\" Asking if i could make a Dawnguard edition with Stronger Bolts. so the ARROWS now do 20 more DMG than what it used to be EXAMPLE \\\"If the steel ARROWS WE\\'RE 10 DMG t would now be 30 DMG.\r\n\r\nlink to STRONGER ARROWS+: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=108226838&searchtext=\r\n\r\nThere are NO bugs so far so hopefully this mod turns out better than the last one which made the Steel Arrow only 3% of DMG instead of 30%.\r\n\r\nDont forget to COMMENT,FAVORITE & SUBCRIBE, Thanks\r\n\r\n-CriticalHittz :)",
