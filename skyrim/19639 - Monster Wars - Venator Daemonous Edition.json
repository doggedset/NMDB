  "descriptionHtml": "Update!\r\n\r\nThe original VD mod had to be scrapped due to my computer epically dying on me, so i have had to start from scratch! this time the mod should have less CTD\\'s.\r\n\r\nREQUIRES\r\n\r\nSkyrim Monster Mod V12\r\n\r\nSKSE\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod originally came about after the request of a couple of members to be an alternative or seperate addition to the original monster wars mod to replace the blue stripes for those \r\nwho didn\\'t quite like the feel or nature of the blue stripes.\r\n\r\n-in this edition there are 350+ soldiers added.\r\n\r\n- 9 of those are companions (they are spread over Skyrim, so get searching!)\r\n\r\n- 1 Base thus far, located just outside Riverwood, across the river, to the left of the main bridge,\r\n\r\nBrief Overview of the Venator Daemonous:\r\n\r\nA brief overview of the Militia;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this elite mercenary band of warriors was to ensure the peoples of Skyrim and her subsidiaries would be secure if any demons or monsters were to mass invade the plains of Skyrim.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tullius personally gave his seal of approval to this entourage of mercenaries, warriors and knights as he knew that the imperial forces alone would struggle against any mass intrusion of monsters, the undead or the powerful.\r\n\r\nWhilst creating this band, the General had to make alterations to the \\\"Martial Law\\\" law set by kings gone by, to which he had to seek approval from the King of Skyrim himself. Fortunately the King had enough clarity and foresight to see this was perhaps the best strategy incase of any invasion.\r\n\r\nThe alterations to the already standing law are as follows;\r\n\r\nWhilst any militia may be formed in the defence of Skyrim and the towns within, no militia captain can override the rule of the local Jarl or try to usurp him or her.\r\n\r\nThe Venator Daemonous Militia may take up residence in any town, city or camp site as an added bulk to the already residing armed forces but cannot take control of the local armed forces unless given permission from the residing Jarl, or in his or her\\'s absence. The Thane of the local town or City.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nHothtrooper44 – for giving me permission to use his various custom armours\r\n\r\nThe creator of the Lore Friendly Armour Pack – he let his mod become public modable as he no longer supports that mod and has let anyone use it for their own.\r\n\r\nThanks and credits to Ironman500 for this awesome collaboration.\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\nIf you wish to alter, improve, integrate into another mod or anything that may need permission, you will need to ask for my approval and ask hothtrooper44 if you can further use his mods too.\r\n\r\nDO NOT UPLOAD THIS MOD TO ANY OTHER SITE!!\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nDownload with NMM, it will do the hard work for you.\r\n\r\nor if you have issues with NMM due to the file size...\r\n\r\nDownload manually, extract files to your Skyrim/Data directory\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n\r\nuse NMM or that does work just delete the files install in the Data directory.",
