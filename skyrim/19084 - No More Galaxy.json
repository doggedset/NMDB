  "descriptionHtml": "You hate that big bright thing - called \\'galaxy\\' (or in good old Oblivion \\'nebulae\\') - which hides your beautiful star-filled sky, too? Good. You can get rid of it now.\r\n\r\n[b]Description[/b]\r\nAs I played in - and modded my way around - our beautiful Skyrim I was always quite unhappy about the night sky not being only stars. Unfortunately I found no single mod who helps people get rid of the galaxy. So I had the idea of just simply using an empty texture file... and it worked! Thought I share it with all of you. Enjoy. \r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\nJust copy the \\'Data\\' folder in the downloaded .zip file into your game\\'s directory.\r\n\r\n[b]Issues or Bugs[/b]\r\nSince it is a really simple texture replacement and the file is not even 1 KB big (and empty) I think there should not be anything - neither bugs and most certainly no performance drops. \r\n\r\n[b]Uninstallation[/b]\r\nJust delete \\'skyrimgalaxy.dds\\' located in your game\\'s directory under Data/Textures/sky.\r\n\r\n[b]Recommended Mod[/b]\r\nWhile it can be used without, I highly recommend using this with a texture replacer like [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/85]Enhanced Night Skyrim by CptJoker[/url] to enhance Skyrim\\'s stars. Just to be certain: you should only use one of his star textures - his galaxy will of course overwrite my file.\r\n\r\n[b]Permissions[/b]\r\nThis really is nothing I can claim any great right on - it is nothing more than an empty file after all - but if you somehow use it or upload it somewhere else (like the SteamWorkshop) be so kind to inform and credit me. If you got the idea from me and use it for your own mod, I would be happy about the same (although it is of course no requirement).",
