  "descriptionHtml": "Having played through skyrim numerous times already the intro sequence have probably became boring and tedious for pretty much everyone.\r<br />Although the game automatically makes a save just before the character creation you still have sit through the rest of the dialogues and the execution.\r<br />\r<br />In theese saves you are in front of the doors of Helgen Keep. All you have to do is to choose a side(left door or right door), get your hands unbound, then just open the console and type &#34;showracemenu&#34;(YES it is a vanilla console command an do not require the mod with the same name) in it to open up the character creation screen.\r<br />\r<br />Since changing race with showracemenu will mess up your skill levels and powers every race got a separate save. Just choose the one with your desired race. Changing gender is harmless.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />To &#34;install&#34; just put the saves into Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Saves.\r<br />I made the saves with no mod or DLC being toggled on so there shouldn&#39;t be a problem if you only have vanilla Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Let me know if there is some problem.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />FaQ:\r<br />Q: Why no &#34;Alternate Start&#34; instead?\r<br />A: I made this mainly for myself but decided to share. I don&#39;t like overburdening my game with chain-installing LOTS of prerequisites for single mods and to install mods that&#39;s functions are 90% deadweight for me.",
