  "descriptionHtml": "New Update v1.5 is ready to download (More is on the way)\r\n_____________________________________\r\nNew environment and more dynamic npc\\'s.\r\nAdded a blacksmith shack\r\nAdded an alternative shack\r\nchanged the stables with a better one...\r\n\r\n*Bug fixes = Hadvar & Ralof don\\'t take an alternate route to Riverwood at the beginning of the game anymore :)\r\n_____________________________________\r\nRiverwood Rangers are 5 characters who live in The Riverwood Hall.\r\n_____________________________________\r\na Wizard Merchant (Enchanting Trainer)\r\na Blacksmith (Smithing Trainer)\r\na Warrior (Blocking Trainer)\r\na Sorceress (Destruction Trainer)\r\na Hunter (Archery Trainer)\r\n______________________________________\r\nYou can use the Farmhouse as Player Home\r\nYou can fast travel to Riverwood Hall.\r\nThe Merchants are open for 24 hours & have 15000 - 20000 gold\r\nYou can use a faster horse named \\\"Daydream\\\" (Immortal)\r\nAll npc\\'s can train you up to lvl 90 skill points (for money)\r\nYou can use all the crafting tables outside\r\n3 Followers are at your service (free) \r\n\r\nYou can use teleportation spell to teleport in front of the blacksmith. The spell tome is in the cellar. You can find the cellar key on the second floor by the balcony door.\r\n________________________________________\r\nImportant Tips about Followers & Teleportation\r\n* If you dismiss them they won\\'t return to the hall. Instead they will stay where you left them so be sure to dismiss them where you want to find them again.\r\n*The Warrior follower (Named Gaia) can use Fus Ro Dah. So somethimes you may find yourself hit with that shout but I recommend you to take her with you anyway.\r\n*I don\\'t recommend taking 3 of them at once because they get in the way.\r\n*They may not appear right after you take them with you. in this case just fast travel to your destination and they will appear.\r\n\r\n*Teleportation spell is one way only. You can\\'t return to where you cast the spell.\r\n\r\nNote: You can edit/change/modify this mod anyway you like and feel free to upload your version if you are interested. \r\n\r\n\r\nWHATS NEXT\r\n____________\r\nThe last update will be much better in many ways\r\n* Teleportation spell will work both ways (You will be able to return to the place you cast the spell)\r\n* A couple of farm animals/pets (perhaps a hunting dog follower)\r\n* Perhaps an armory for your weapons & supplies\r\n* All Npc\\'s will become dynamic. They will work, sleep, train and return to their location when you let them go.\r\n* They won\\'t have navigational problems. (This is the worst problem in my mod. There is a navmesh bug in creation kit and npc\\'s can\\'t find their way easily. Unfortunately it is taking a lot of time to figure out how to fix the navmesh issue. Otherwise I would have already finished the entire mod the way I wanted.\r\n\r\n Thank you for downloading this mod",
