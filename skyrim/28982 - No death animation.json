  "descriptionHtml": "Speculatin around dDefinder1\\'s mods. ^^\r\n\r\nHe made a nice mod called \\\"No Spinning Death Animation\\\".\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17214\r\nIt alters only humans and dragons, while many other creatures continue to use the same boring death animation, which you doomed to see half of the time.\r\nI decided to change it the same way as it was made in prorotype, nice and easy.\r\nNow every creature in the game will always die using only ragdoll. They will fall in right direction, even fly away if your weapon has enough power. This will work with creatures from mods like Monster mod.(BTW version 12 is out, google it.)\r\nThis mod Does NOT include changes from \\\"No Spinning Death Animation\\\".\r\nEnjoy.",
