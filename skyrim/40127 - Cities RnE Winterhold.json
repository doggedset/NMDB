  "descriptionHtml": "Cities RnE-Winterhold\r\nDownload - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/40127\r\nReduced n Enhanced (RnE) packages by Thorne67\r\nMade for FPS Boosts on low end machines\r\nFINAL VERSION. In conjunction with my Farmhouses. They are both FINAL.\r\nNEXUS EXCLUSIVE.\r\nNON MESHED VERSION. NO REQUIREMENTS. HAS ESPs. READ BELOW.\r\n\r\nOk. First of all. Running low rez textures on low \r\nsettings just WONT work well.  The best way to \r\nuse THESE is to download a Low rez pack such as \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/47 \r\nor \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14504 \r\nand overwrite these and whatever other mods on \r\ntop of them and THEN change your graphics settings \r\nto a higher value with CONFIGURATOR at\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/814.\r\n\r\n\\\"WHO SAYZ LOW REZ SUX??\\\"\r\n\r\nAll custom and redone from UHD original textures and individually converted to 512k and re-edited. Well... as low res as possible for all items without losing too much.\r\n\r\nESP for Snowless college outside. To bring back snow on outside tiles delete the AAASnowlessCollege.esp.\r\n\r\nESP that adds really awesome music to the college. To remove just delete Magicollege.esp. The floor tiles are from this authors awesome work but I lost the Nexus IP. He deserves all credit for the music and the tile textures.\r\n\r\nMy FPS has gone from an average world 8 fps to 20 and up using my edited packs but they\\'re going to take forever to upload at below 56k so use the TESV pack above and overwrite with mine as they come out.\r\n\r\nI take no credits for original works. I\\'ve just re-done them for FPS boosts and for use on low end machines. \r\n\r\nNo extra crap goes into the skyrim folder with my mods.\r\n\r\nThis is another of a batch of redone RnE packs by me. I take no credit for the original textures. All I\\'ve done is lower the resolution for really old systems to play at higher rez and FPS boosts.\r\n\r\nRnE Farmhouses- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/40075\r\nRnE Winterhold- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/40127\r\nRnE Whiterun- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/40080\r\nRnE Solutude- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3761688\r\nRnE Riften- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3761688\r\nRnE Falmerhuts Tents Edgetrim- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3761688\r\nRnE Hrothgar- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3761688\r\nRnE Markarth- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3761688\r\nRnE Skyhaventemple- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3761688\r\nRnE Sovngarde- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3761688\r\nRnE Windhelm- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3761688\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 03 AUG 2013\r\nIncluded ESP to add music to the college.
