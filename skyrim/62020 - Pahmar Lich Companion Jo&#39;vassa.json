  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a Pahmar Lich follower named Jo&#39;vassa to Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />Jo&#39;vassa is a Pahmar khajiit, which are a khajiit subspecies to appear the same as tigers, but with the same amount of intelligence as any Khajiit. A Pahmar is only born when Masser is full and Sedunda is new. \r<br />\r<br />Jo&#39;vassa is an ancient Lich from Elsweyr; turning himself into an undead creature to prolong his lifespan. He moved to Skyrim because he was paranoid that the heat of Elsweyr would speed up the rotting of his corpse. He became a Lich during the Planemelding in the second era, and was a loyal member of Mannimarco&#39;s Worm Cult until Mannimarco was slain in the third era. After that, he went off on his own. \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/pLYu0N4.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Jo&#39;vassa can be found skulking in the Windhelm Hall of the Dead. He fights with melee claw attacks and frost spells. If you want to fight him for whatever reason, silver weapons, dawnbreaker, and anti-undead spells all work on him. His flaming mane is fully animated.\r<br />\r<br />He shouldn&#39;t conflict with anything, and he&#39;ll have a lot more dialogue if you have [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52019/?]Follower Commentary Overhaul[/url] installed.\r<br />\r<br />Only requires Dawnguard",
