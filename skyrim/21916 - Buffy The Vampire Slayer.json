  "descriptionHtml": "Why not? We have Vampires, thought I\\'d introduce a Slayer. She is lev 5 and will level with the player. She cannot die cause she\\'s the slayer. She is marriageable. Her favorite weapon is the bow and arrows.  She knows allot of skills in archery, and is very  loyal but deadly fighter. She has high sneak skills and archer skills. Sorry no stake, they are not in the game.(yet) \r\n\r\nYou will find her walking around Riverwood probably near the Blacksmith area. \r\n\r\nPS MY lighting sucks\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\nYou must have ApachiiHair running for this mod. Make sure it is before Buffy in the order.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\n\r\nI Used:\r\n\r\nBetter Females by Belle  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\n\r\nApachii Hair of course\r\n\r\nArmour is by Killer Keos http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3654",
