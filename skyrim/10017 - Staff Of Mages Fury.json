  "descriptionHtml": "I wanted a staff that had a similar effect to the Wizard\\'s Fury spell in Oblivion. So...\r\n\r\nIt does Fire, Frost, and Shock damage. Shock damage is Chain Lightning, which seems to bring the other damage types along for the ride. I balanced the enchantment out so that it lasts around 50 uses before recharging. \r\n\r\nI have added a Daedric Bow of Mage\\'s Fury (Purely experimental, forgot to delete it before uploading). It does not have the chain lightning effect, can\\'t get it working. Maybe arrows would work better... hmmm... Arrows of Mage\\'s Fury....\r\n\r\nAnyway, enjoy the experimental bow.\r\n\r\nIt is located on the roof of the Mage\\'s Collage in Winterhold, which can only be accessed after you become the Arch-Mage.\r\n\r\n1.0\r\n----------------------------------\r\nA staff on the roof of the Mage\\'s College that could easily get knocked off by a dragon...\r\n\r\n2.0\r\n----------------------------------\r\nAdded a dragon resistant chest on the roof with the staff and a new Daedric Bow of Mages Fury in it.\r\n\r\nPlease endorse if you like it",
