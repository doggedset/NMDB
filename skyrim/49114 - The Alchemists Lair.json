  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />\r<br />Introduction\r<br />============\r<br />\r<br />Blackreach.\r<br />\r<br />You know it, you may even have heard tales of someone who once sought out this place.\r<br />\r<br />His name was Sinderion, he was once an Altmer of some note in Cyrodiil. He was an Alchemist, and one with a passion for knowledge, and an obsession with a particular plant. An obsession that led him far from his home in the Imperial province, and to the cold shores of Skyrim. In search of new knowledge and ingredients. \r<br />\r<br />During his search he found Blackreach, and was never heard from again. His lab though, remains within the depths of that strange underground wilderness.\r<br />\r<br />Will you journey down into the depths of the world to seek out his home in the dark? Take up residence in the gloom, away from the world and all it&#39;s troubles?\r<br />\r<br />Best of luck traveller.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Description\r<br />===========\r<br />\r<br />Name: The Alchemist&#39;s Lair - player home.\r<br />\r<br />A reworking of Sinderion&#39;s field lab in Blackreach. Designed for single person use only.\r<br />\r<br />Includes:\r<br />\r<br />~ A bed\r<br />~ Storage (various)\r<br />~ Cooking, Alchemy, Enchanting areas \r<br />~ Armour mannequin and weapon racks\r<br />\r<br />As this is a mage/Alchemist themed home, there is no forge or other &#34;hard labour&#34; style functions.\r<br />\r<br />This file is heavily dependant on the General Stores and General Displays mods as most of the decor and items are based on the setup from those mods - appearing and being stored as those files dictate.\r<br />I did this so that people could display their trophies and collected items from their completed quests and journeys.\r<br />\r<br />You will find the Master chest for the General Stores mod beside the bench with the Crimson Nirnroot on it.\r<br />\r<br />The master storage for the General Displays mod is a safe beside the General Stores chest - it&#39;s to your right as you enter the room.\r<br />\r<br />Various items can be displayed via the General Displays mod, and I have not used all the markers present from it - but a large portion of unique objects can be placed in the safe and appear in a designated location within the home.\r<br />\r<br />List of items for display:\r<br />\r<br />~ Daedric artifacts\r<br />~ Dragon Priest masks\r<br />~ ElderScrolls\r<br />~ Thieves Guild unique reward items\r<br />~ Dawnguard &#34;Rune&#34; items\r<br />~ Gaulder quest weapons\r<br />~ Aetherial items\r<br />~ Keening\r<br />~ Nine Divine amulets \r<br />~ Helm of Yngol\r<br />~ Two &#34;unique&#34; skull keys\r<br />~ Necromancers Amulet and St. Jiub&#39;s Amulet\r<br />~ Bug Jars\r<br />  \r<br />\r<br />Note: I have left Sinderion&#39;s journal on the table with the Crimson Nirnroot - the note with the journal explains why it is there.\r<br />\r<br />The Attunement Sphere usually found on the table here is now in a bowl, which is within the Dwemer case, which itself is on the safe by the entrance.\r<br />\r<br />Sinderion himself has been removed - the note with his journal details what happened to him.\r<br />\r<br />Location\r<br />========\r<br />\r<br />Sinderion&#39;s lab in Blackreach.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Location notes:\r<br />\r<br />I have added a new map marker to the world map - this is at the location of the exit elevator from Blackreach (the one near Sinderion&#39;s Lab).\r<br />\r<br />There is a screenshot of this location included in this download.\r<br />\r<br />At this location there is a new Dwemer stonework item with a gemstone within - this is a teleportation stone that will bring you to the home directly. Inside the home there is another teleportation gemstone by the door that will return you to the surface.\r<br />\r<br />Secondary location:\r<br />\r<br />There is an optional/second file available that places a Dwemer home on the shores of Lake Ilinalta. The interior is the exact same as the original/main file - just refitted to a different location.\r<br />\r<br />Any Sinderion related content is removed from this file - except for the Crimson Nirnroot inside, I felt it suited the place too much to be altered.\r<br />\r<br />All thanks to the user &#34; perrob&#34; for the idea.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />Official DLC: Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />General Stores - storage resource for packrats: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18340\r<br />\r<br />General Displays:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32550//?\r<br />\r<br />There will be no change to these requirements.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Install\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />1.

This I cannot be held accountable for, so if the home is too bright or too dark, then it&#39;s due to the mod you have. It looks fine and as I want in in my game, so I&#39;m happy enough to leave it as it is for the time being.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />History\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />Version: 1.0 - First public release version.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Updates:\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />None at the moment.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Tools Used\r<br />==========\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim Creation Kit by Bethesda Softworks.\r<br />7-Zip - http://www.7-zip.org/\r<br />Readme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp",
