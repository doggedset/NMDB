The museum is connected to 12 major locations of Skyrim. \r\nMost house mods were crashing my game, so i made my own and avoided all the things that cause problems, like bookshelfs - got chests instead (much better anyway)\r\n\r\n[b][color=8BB381]Whats inside?[/color][/b] \r\n•            12 teleports (small red buttons)  in Whiterun,  Windhelm, Winterhold, Falkreath, Riverwood, Riften, Rorikstead, Morthal, Dawnstar, Markarth, Helgen and Solitude.  The buttons are just beside you when you fast travel to these towns.  Some on the ground and some on nearby wall or on steps to Jarls house. \r\n•\t14 Male mannequins\r\n•\t11 Female mannequins\r\n•\t36 Weapon Racks (upgraded to 75 in v2)\r\n•\t15 Weapon Plaques\r\n•\t30 Shield Plaques\r\n•\t 7 Weapon Display Cases\r\n•\t18 Dagger Display Cases\r\n•\tAnvil – Grindstone – Workbench – Smelter – Tanning rack – Alchemy lab – Enchanter Table –  - Cooking Pot\r\n•\tBed\r\n•\tDragon Priest Masks Holder\r\n•\t8 Labeled Chests for: Smithing – Alchemy Ingredients – Books – Skill Books – Scrolls – Soul gems – Enchanting items – Potions\r\n•\t12 Unlabeled Chests \r\n•\tJewelry Box\r\n\r\n(everything is empty,  so no spoilers) \r\n[img]http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/2537/qanda.png[/img]\r\nQ:How do i get inside?\r\nA: Use one of the 12 teleports in each major city.\r\n\r\nQ: Can my follower get in too? \r\nYes, I got it working (finely). If they ever stop somewhere inside, just walk to them and then walk slowly, they should follow. \r\n\r\nQ: There are no bookshelfs? \r\nA: Well, I made them,  but they were crashing the game.  Anyway,  in my opinion the bookshelfs are overrated. I use chest for books and its much better as the books are all in one place and alphabetically sorted too.  The SKILL BOOKS chest in the museum is there,  because i use mod that lets me pick up skill books without reading them,  so i can save them for higher levels.  [url= http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=8781] PowerFang\\'s Identified Books [/url]\r\n\r\nQ: Any conflicts with other mods? \r\nA: Only if some mod changes the cities. My museum still will be there, but some of the teleports in cities might have been erased by other mod.\r\n\r\nQ: My  mannequins are black.\r\nA: Fast save and fast load,  that shoud fix it. (there is another bug with mannequins that wount allow mannequins to face north)  took me 3hours to figure this one out. \r\n\r\nQ: For some reason Daedric Armor on Female Mannequins causes the game to crash. \r\nA: I seriously don’t know why. It happens to me, but had no other reports. Just try it for yourself. Male mannequins are ok.\r\n\r\n[img]http://img209.imageshack.us/img209/4646/instalation.png[/img]\r\n[center][b][color=FF4500]!!!!  IMPORTANT  !!!!  [/center]If you are upgrading from version 1, you MUST get all your things from the room first. Then travel outside the museum and save. Exit Skyrim. Paste new version in and override. Otherwise you lose everything!!!![/color][/b]\r\n\r\n[img]http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/2705/historyky.png [/img]\r\nVersion 2 - 17/5/2012\r\nAdded 39 weapon racks (And its still not enough)\r\nFixed the lighting (Its a bit darker now)\r\nSome plaques and weapon racks didnt allow to extract weapons (Fixed now)\r\nNavmeshed part of the room, so followers can now go inside. (If they dont follow, just walk slower)\r\nSome other small bugs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, i think thats all.  If you enjoy Malkavs museum,  please show your appreciation and press that button to [color=red]ENDORSE or RATE[/color] this mod.  Thank you. \r\n\r\nMalkav\r\n\r\n[img]http://img546.imageshack.us/img546/3817/othermods.png[/img]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11976/]Malkavs Collection[/url]\r\n[img] http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2748/collectori.png [/img]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4201]Glass armor and weapon set[/url]\r\n[img]http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/9686/glassset.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4635]Dark Elven weapon and armor set[/url]\r\n[img]http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/5301/darkelvenset.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3362]Glass  weapon and armor set with blue moonstone[/url]\r\n[img]http://img811.imageshack.us/img811/1602/moonstelvengreen.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3239]Light Blue Elven armor and weapon set[/url]\r\n[img]http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/7439/lightblueelven.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3060]Septim coin retexture[/url]\r\n[img]http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/6870/septim.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22184]6 Mudcrabs for Automatic Variants[/url]\r\n[img]http://img542.imageshack.us/img542/695/crabst.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n",
