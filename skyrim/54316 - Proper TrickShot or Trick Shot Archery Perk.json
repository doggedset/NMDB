  "descriptionHtml": "Warning&#33; This is just as Bethesda left it, it most likely doesn&#39;t work AT ALL after you get Bullseye&#33;\r<br />\r<br />HOWEVER, I have released a fully functional version over here = [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54334/?]True Trick Shot[/url] That will work properly even after you get Bullseye...\r<br />\r<br />Before you say anything, YES, I know someone else released this kind of thing before. However I found that his was modified and contained some changes and dirty edits.\r<br />\r<br />I enabled this in the cleanest way possible. There is no changes from the way Bethesda left it. I simply placed it where it would have gone and attempted to leave the greatest compatibility for other Archery skills. I didn&#39;t even move any of the other skills.\r<br />\r<br />From my research the stated 25% is either:\r<br />\r<br />A = Not as high as 25%\r<br />or\r<br />B = Only 25% if your hit your opponent while they are swinging weapons or drawing their bow.\r<br />\r<br />Either way I played with it for awhile and it worked a few times for me.\r<br />\r<br />The perk is just below Bullseye and requires 80 Archery to get it.\r<br />\r<br />Since this is just a implementation of a Bethesda left over I retain no rights to this file.\r<br />\r<br />I added a optional file with one minor change. For those of us that absolutely cannot stand improper grammar I added the missing space so it shows as &#34;Trick Shot&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Only use one or the other....",
