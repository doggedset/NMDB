  "summary": "A mod that changes the sewer network underneath the Dragonsreach Dungeon into a good player home for beginners. Also adds an easy escape route to outside of Whiterun for breaking out of jail.",
  "descriptionHtml": "*Latest Update for Skyrim is needed*\r<br />\r<br />This mod started when I was escaping jail in Whiterun one day and decided this would be a good location for a small base. I only really intended to add a bedroll, some nonrespawing containers, and possibly a follower (hence the name Gregory.esp). However, as I went along I started to get a bit carried away and ended up making tons of new additions to the Dungeon.\r<br />\r<br />Though the mod is fully functional right now it&#39;s still a WIP. I&#39;ll be adding a lot more stuff to this.\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />This mod changes the Dragonsreach Dungeon to become a player home, most useful for beginners or those who are frequently in jail in Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]BnGAOOJJKpE[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Features:\r<br />3 Bedrolls\r<br />Tons of Safe containers. All containers are nonrespawnable (except for the Large sack near the ladder to the Guards Barracks and possibly the Apothecary Satchel)\r<br />Several Custom Skill books and letters dotted around the Dungeon\r<br />A Tanning Rack\r<br />A Grindstone\r<br />An Alchemy Table\r<br />An exit to outside the walls of Whiterun\r<br />An exit to just outside Dragonsreach\r<br />An exit to Breezehome (Don&#39;t worry, you need the Breezehome key to open it)\r<br />A slightly better Enchanted Ebony Dagger\r<br />\r<br />Planned Features:\r<br />More clutter and storage containers\r<br />Hearthfire Addon (Which will work perfectly with this mod http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249/? which lets you adopt up to 6 kids)\r<br />Followers (Possibly Voiced)\r<br />Quests Possibly, or at least a bit of background story in notes\r<br />More Books\r<br />Possibly more exits to various parts of Whiterun (like inside shops and stuff)\r<br />Possibly more crafting stations (Not sure about this because banging on an anvil while hiding from guards would kind of break immersion)\r<br />More as I think of it\r<br />\r<br />I want this to cater to the likings of different people at the same time. So the Hearthfire addition will be an optional file and the quests and followers may be part of that optional file, we&#39;ll see\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />Shouldn&#39;t conflict with most mods unless they also change Dragonsreach Dungeon.\r<br />The trapdoor in Breezehome is next to table and barrels. If this conflicts with Breezehome mods (Like maybe Breezehome basement or something) let me know and I&#39;ll be happy to make a patch.\r<br />The trapdoor in Whiterun is in the corner to the left side of Dragonsreach, shouldn&#39;t be in the way of any mods. If you have the bass cannons mod it&#39;s right across from those chests.\r<br />The trapdoor on the outside of Whiterun is on the east side pretty close to the wall, I highly doubt any mod altered that space.\r<br />Again if any mod conflicts with the trapdoors let me know and I&#39;ll make a patch.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Just open up your Skyrim Data folder and drop the files in, or use Nexus Mod Manager.\r<br />\r<br />Also available on the Steam Workshop, if that&#39;s your cup of tea\r<br />\r<br />Btw, this is my first mod (Other than a follower I made once and then scrapped)\r<br />\r<br />Check out my other mod which makes Astrid from the Dark Brotherhood a follower.\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54009/?\r<br />\r<br />Help make Skyblivion a reality&#33; Join the team and rebuild Oblivion in Skyrim&#33; http://tesrenewal.com/forums/skyrim/skyblivion-development/6029",
