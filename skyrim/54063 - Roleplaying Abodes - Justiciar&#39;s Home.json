  "descriptionHtml": "You have been named Justiciar, and sent to Skyrim. Your role is within Eastmarch, and is potentially dangerous, resulting in your new home having many guards.\r<br />\r<br />Yes, the &#39;My Orders&#39; item references you being able to have the named folk as followers, and it also mentions about the Thalmor&#39;s presence in the Hold of Whiterun. This is just an open door for future updates, or even different mods.\r<br />\r<br />Remember to report any bugs under &#39;Posts&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />Note: player.addfac 39F26 1   =   Thalmor Faction for you, if you want your character to be in it. I don&#39;t think it actually makes a difference, but the members will be moroe friendly to you",
