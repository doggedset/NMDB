When you do find her she will have a steel dagger, dress and some other items that might add to her character. \r<br />\r<br />For now I don&#39;t know what kind of character to make her, commenting what kind of follower, and where to find her would really be helpful, thanks&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[b]*And Friend Part* - Note:[/b] I have added a new follower in the &#39;Sleeping Giant Inn&#39; at Riverwood. His name is &#34;Tralen&#34; and is a Redguard male carrying Steel Plate Armor with a steel sword and a stack of 12 bottles of ale (For when you might need it ;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][u]If you don&#39;t like the mod please scroll all the way down here....[/u][/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][size=5][b]You may not like the mod, but I hope you like Comic Sans :)[/b][/size][/font]",
