  "modName": "TC - Blackreach Dwemer War Quarters",
  "summary": "Adds three new expansive rooms with leveled content to the Dwemer War Quarters in Blackreach, which was previously a small room with no enemies.",
  "descriptionHtml": "When the Dwemer mysteriously and suddenly disappeared, most of their cities were left defenseless, to be pillaged and destroyed by time. Today, only the most well-defended Dwemer fortresses remain.\r<br />\r<br />The Dwemer War Quarters is one such fortress, barely touched by the passage of time. Not a soul has yet been able to pass the entrance chamber to steal the contents far within. Dwemer Spiders maintain the War Quarters in their masters&#39; absence, such that it remains a near-spotless vestige of Dwemer civilization. It remains, due to the excessive military might of the Dwemer, which remains, asleep within the War Quarters.\r<br />\r<br />Powerful, forgotten weaponry remains forgotten, deep within the halls of the War Quarters. Secret dwemer military technology can be found in the deepest places, such as Dwemer Flintlock rifles (by Ghosu).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />SUGGESTED MODS\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63022/]Dwemer Spectres[/url] - Adds a chance to spawn a Dwemer Spectre instead of vanilla Sphere Centurions and Spiders&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY\r<br />3DNPC (Immersive NPC&#39;s) - Load this afterwards. Unfortunately will replace the Dwemer AI &#39;Relic&#39;. A compatibility patch should move him to the Dwemer Pumphouse nearby.",
