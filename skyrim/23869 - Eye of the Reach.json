  "descriptionHtml": "Please check out my other mods: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imoja/myworkshopfiles/\r\n\r\n== WARNING! WARNING! ==\r\nPLEASE BE SURE TO EMPTY YOUR STORAGE BOXES BEFORE REPLACING THE OLD VERSION WITH THE UPDATED VERSION 1.2!. PARTICULARLY THE MANNEQUINS. I sincerely apologise.\r\n\r\n\r\n== DESCRIPTION ==\r\n\r\nThis house is orientated around Role-Playing without enhancing gameplay unnecessarily. \r\nThis house is situated in the far west of the reach, high upon a cliff overlooking the beautiful scenery of skyrim.\r\nThis house has 2 basic training facilities nearby. Sufficient enough to learn fundamental knowledge of the arts.\r\nThis house is named \\\"Eye of the Reach\\\" so as to essentially be lore friendly, and yet vague enough to suit many back stories.\r\nThis house will not be littered with loose, physics enabled items falling all over the place such as plates, cuttlery and baskets. (A factor that would often drive me crazy about homes.)\r\n\r\n\r\n== FEATURE LIST ==\r\n\r\nCrafting (Outside)\r\nTraining (Outside)\r\n\r\nAlchemy (Inside) + 2 Dedicated storage locations\r\nCooking (Inside) + 2 Dedicated storage locations\r\nEnchanting (Inside) + 2 Dedicated storage locations\r\n\r\n111 Book Storage Locations, (Inside)\r\n9 Mannequins. (Inside)\r\n8 Weapon Plaques. (Inside)\r\n6 Storage Chests. (Inside)\r\n3 Drawers for clothes. (Inside)\r\n1 Wardrobe. (Inside) \r\n\r\n\r\n== CHANGELOG ==\r\n1.0 - Finally a finished home. Still plenty more to come! (Archery now outputs distance, XP based on difficulty of shot)\r\n0.9 - Added: Melee training ground, Archery range too.\r\n0.8 - Added: Weapon Plaques, Bookshelves, Chests and more general clutter.\r\n0.7 - Adjusted lighting, More clutter and new series of screenshots. (minor fixes too)\r\n0.6 - Completely redone the whole cliffside and the \\\"Eye\\\" of the Reach.\r\n0.5 - Tower has been removed, stations moved indoors. Added cooking.\r\n0.45 - My apologies. The house was actually massively incorrect when comparing the interior to the exterior. Fixed.\r\n0.4 - New screenshots taken and small ammounts of tweaking all over.\r\n0.3 - Potentially unfavorable addition of Alchemy and Enchanting tables. (I will eventually find a better solution. Suggestions Welcome.)\r\n0.2 - Mannequins, Lighting and Mood. A Little Clutter.\r\n0.1 - Essentially Livable. (Bed, Crafting, and all buildings are connected.)\r\n\r\n\r\n== RECOMMENDED ==\r\n\r\nAlternate Start - Live Another Life: This addon greatly enhances Role-Playing in the world of skyrim.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9557\r\n\r\nWobums The Epic Horse: This horse is my companion. Truly essential addon.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8939",
