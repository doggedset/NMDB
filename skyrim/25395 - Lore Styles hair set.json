  "descriptionHtml": "It`s been some time since I last played Skyrim (7 months to be exact), and recently I came back to it. I also thought it might be a good idea to finish a mod I started making, and after some struggling with the CK, here it is - a simple, small, but hopefully pleasing set of 6 new hairstyles for your female characters. \r<br />\r<br />They are - \r<br />\r<br />- female only\r<br />- rigged\r<br />- brand new (not a port from another game), made especially with Skyrim in mind, with both meshes and textures made from scratch\r<br />- small and practical in size, meaning even less powerful computers could run it\r<br />\r<br />There are some things you should keep in mind, tho - \r<br />\r<br />- They WILL DISAPPEAR under hoods and helmets, as all hairs do. It`s the way it`s been programmed and meant to play. Otherwise, there would be a lot of clipping. Not pretty.\r<br />- I`m having no crashes with them, showracemenu opens smoothly (without any other hair mods installed).\r<br />\r<br />And, finally...\r<br />\r<br />- not sure if compatible with NPC editor or just being a n00b all over again\r<br />- could end up being a part of  a larger set, god (and me) willing. 24 hours in a day + OCD = not good.\r<br />\r<br />-  NO REQUESTS. \r<br />Sorry, guys. If you want, you can advert my attention to certain styles you think might be cool and lore friendly, but I`m making NO promises. It usually takes about 10 days to make 1 hairstyle, with the entire process of sculpting, retopology, rigging, tweaking, painting textures etc., and that`s when I spend my every free minute on it. So, what you get is what you get...is what you get. Get it? ;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- You are allowed to use them in creating custom NPCs and followers, but do not upload them within your mods. Please link back to this mod. :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]NOTE&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />For some reason, these don`t show up in the CK head view when trying to add them to an NPC. Switching to full view, however, does the trick. I`m currently looking into that.\r<br />\r<br />This was a great exercise for me in making 3D stuff (I`m an illustrator and concept artist, so 3D is something like uncharted lands to me), but I still have lots to learn, so any comments, suggestions, links to tutorials etc... are highly welcome. \r<br />\r<br />Videos by Brodual, insane0hflex, Saiodin and MMOxReview.
