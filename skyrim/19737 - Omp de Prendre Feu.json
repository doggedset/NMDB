  "descriptionHtml": "Can take a lot of damage.  Fights with fireball first, then 1H weapon but always with a shield in left hand.   She is mainly perked for Heavy Armour and Block, and comes with enchanted Ork gear and some weapons.  Give her some random item of apparel to make her equip her gear.  I\\'m hoping she\\'ll use flame cloak when she levels up a bit.  Be the first to find out.  She has two spells, fireball and flame cloak, and has one point in one-handed tree.  \r\n\r\nShe\\'s in Jorvaskar!!!\r\n\r\nNote: If her face is white, use the Ctrl + F4 trick, google it.",
