Makes the game even more epic than it was. \r\nJust download and try to listen to a few songs and try it.\r\n\r\nTo install just overwrite the music folder in Skyrim/Data/\r\nMake a backup of the music folder in case you don\\'t like mine (i doubt it).\r\n\r\nAlso it\\'s my first posted \\\"mod\\\".\r\nIf anyone wants to use this go ahead.\r\nHope you guys like it.\r\nAnd I would like to specify one thing: don\\'t play the game without ThuuMic - Real life dragon shouts ( http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5626 )  :D",
