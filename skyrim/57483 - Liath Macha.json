  "summary": "The sturdy horse, Liath Macha, from Irish legend. Need a trusty steed who fights beside you, runs fast, and virtually never tires? Liath Macha is your new best friend.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Based around the Irish legend of Cuchulainn, Liath Macha is named after Cuchulainn&#39;s trusted horse, which rode into battle with him and was said to have fought beside him and killed thirty men with nothing but its teeth and hooves.\r<br />\r<br />This Liath Macha isn&#39;t quite that impressive. Sure, he&#39;s sturdy, hard to kill, has incredible stamina, remarkable speed, and levels up with you (for a cap at 81), and he&#39;ll even fight alongside you instead of running away or panicking, but it&#39;s not like he can cast spells or do tons of damage.\r<br />\r<br />Nonetheless, he&#39;s speedy, strong, and brave, and best of all, if you lose track of him or he dies, he&#39;ll simply respawn right where you found him - by the lake.Â \r<br />\r<br />Incidentally, he did that in the myth, too. Geez, mythology battles are so hax, huh?\r<br />\r<br />If I feel up to it, I might add a spell so you can summon him to your side, too, and then hide it in his saddle or something.\r<br />\r<br />Installation is a breeze - use NMM or just paste the .esp file into your Skyrim/Data folder. He should cooperate with any other mod fairly well, and there shouldn&#39;t be any problems, no matter what version of Skyrim you&#39;re running.\r<br />\r<br />Recommended Mods:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3200/?]Ornate Saddles[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19936/?]More Saddles[/url]",
