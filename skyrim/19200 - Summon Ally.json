  "descriptionHtml": "This is a summoning Flame Atron. spell with a twist it also come with a summoning circle that will exploded causing fire damage the more people around the circle will be affected so be careful summoning around calm areas where innocent people are because they will be injured and giving you a wanted level. But this spell is VERY useful when being ambushed or when you find your self surrounded by enemies. Or if your a free-gamer or just playing for fun its a fun spell to go around and cast for no reason watching things blown to pieces. And with a low Magicka cost of 31 you can cast over and over plus no matter of your level or skill as long as you have a conjuring perk level of 25 or higher you can cast it and it allows you to have TWO of these helpers no matter the skill but careful not to cast to close to each other. The Spell Tome can purchased at Belethor\\'s General Goods Store in Whiterun for around 1k but the spell if worth much more :D Have Fun ",
