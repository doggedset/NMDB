  "descriptionHtml": "Hello everyone, here is my Breton/Elf looking character Preset ..I've based this character on the Sephinroth from Might and Magic Heroes VII, she's a sort of evil trickster who uses a lot of dark magic and stuff so she would probably be better as an evil character but that's entirely up to you. There's a few mods I used during the process of making this character so if you like the looks of it so far then the mods I've used are listed below.\n<br />[color=#00ff00]There's now a new and improved Version 2 of this character preset![/color]\n<br />\n<br />Requirements:\n<br />\n<br />Racemenu   [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624[/url]﻿\n<br />\n<br />SG eyebrows   [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35327]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35327[/url]﻿\n<br />\n<br />KS Hairdos - HDT Physics   [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70363]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70363[/url]﻿\n<br />\n<br />Vampire eyes playable   [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26222]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26222[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Thank you to all of the fantastic modders for supplying the, you know.. mods, credit goes to:\n<br />\n<br />Racemenu - expired6978\n<br />SG eyebrows - hellosanta\n<br />KS Hairdos - HDT Physics - Stealthic Khaos\n<br />Vampire eyes playable - dark1402\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Here's a bit of information about Sephinroth's character from MMH7:\n<br />\n<br />[i]\"Born Saifiros, \"sharp steel eyes\", this master con artist changed her name to \"Sephinroth\" because she felt it sounded more exotic and regal, giving her an aura of mystery. A skillful liar, she tried to pass herself as the late King Arniel's illegitimate daughter. When the masquerade was discovered, Sephinroth was forced to hide among the exiled Dark Elves.\"[/i]",
