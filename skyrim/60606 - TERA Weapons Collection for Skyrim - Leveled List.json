  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][u][b]Description:\r<br />[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />It&#39;s been a while since I started to use the mod: [b]TERA Weapons Collection for Skyrim[/b] by Iromizu ( \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27463/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27463/?[/url] )\r<br />\r<br />Although the Weapons are non-lore friendly, the designs are amazing, so I couldn&#39;t resist it.\r<br />The only thing missing, was a leveled list, so the equipments could be found all over Skyrim.\r<br />The mod is long long abandoned as the creator was banned, so I decided to look for alternatives.\r<br />\r<br />There is a Leveled list made here: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37676/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37676/?[/url]\r<br />But I couldn&#39;t be satisfied with Level-10 enemies walking around with Draedric armors, so I decided to spend some time learning how to make a leveled list via CK.\r<br />\r<br />It has a small progression curve, so, some of them would only be able to be found on higher levels.\r<br />So, here it is: You should be able to find Tera Weapons being held by bandits, soldiers, in some chests, and sold by Merchants and Blacksmiths, all on a fairly rare rate.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Requirements:\r<br />[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />You MUST have installed &#34;Tera Weapons Collection v1.1&#34; from Iromizu:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27463/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27463/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:\r<br />[/b]\r<br />1) Download the file;\r<br />2) Unzip it;\r<br />3) Drop the file on your Skyrim&#92;Data&#92; Folder;\r<br />[color=#ff7700]4) OVERWRITE your &#34;TERA Weapons.esp&#34; (make sure to have a backup first, in case you want to roll it back)[/color]\r<br />5) Run Skyrim and Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Note:[/b] Maybe it&#39;s necessary to &#34;wait&#34; for a while so the cells can reset and update the lists.\r<br />\r<br />Also, let me know if the drop rate is satisfying.\r<br />Be gentle, it&#39;s the first time I try to make a leveled list&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Note:[/b] There is no magic weapons support, I&#39;m still learning about it and it looks like it is very very time consuming \r<br />\r<br />to be done.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Credits:[/b][/u]\r<br />[b]Bethesda[/b] for this damn amazing Game;\r<br />[b]Bethesda[/b] again, for sharing with us the resources, allowing creativity around the world to flourish. That&#39;s the business model of the future;\r<br />[b]Iromizu[/b] for his great conversion; ",
