  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Better Guard skill comments\r\nVersion: 1.01\r\nDate: 2/16/2012\r\nCategory: NPCs\r\nAuthor(s): Dark_Lord_\r\nSource: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9977\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis plugin makes changes to the comments guards make about your skills. Normally a guard comments on a skill that is level 30 or above. So a pure warrior type, who happens to have leveled Sneak to 30, is constantly called a sneak thief by guards.\r\n\r\nThis mod raises the skill level required for such a comment. So now guards will comment on things you really do, instead of things you rarely do. No more sneak thief comments for burly non-sneaking warriors.\r\n\r\nThere are, as of now, 2 versions of this mod. The first original one will raise the required skill level to 70. The second one will raise it to 50, making comments appear earlier.\r\n\r\nONLY choose one of these mods, because they will conflict with eachother, as they edit exactly the same thing.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n1. Extract the files to a temporary location.\r\n2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.\r\n3. Copy files to the Skyrim Data Directory. Mostly it is: C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n4. Start Skyrim Launcher, click \\'Data Files\\', place a checkmark beside the .esp file(s).\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file.\r\n2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nSince this is my first serious mod, I am not familiar with compatibility.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think this mod should be compatible with about anything, except mods that change the same dialogue as this one.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\nVersion 1 - Current and probably only version. Raises skill requirements for comments to 70\r\nVersion 1.01 - added another file. Its basically the same mod, but with a requirement of 50 instead of 70.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nYou can contact me by PM on this site or on the official BethSoft forums, where I am known as Dark_Lord_ .\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim and the Creation Kit\r\nThanks to Nexus for being such a nice place to host mods\r\nThanks to Lhammonds for the ReadMe Generator.\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nReadme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nYou can do whatever you want with this mod but all I ask in return is that\r\nyou give me credit if you distribute any part of this mod. I would also like\r\nto know what mods are including my work.",
