  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#f1c232][size=4][b]\n<br />Silence is golden﻿ but less sound is even better!\n<br />\n<br />[color=#dd7e6b]Fixes Mihail's Pigeons, Mihail's Pheasants, Ducks and Chickens and Mihail's Peacocks to reduced sound.\n<br />\n<br />The silent version will still be available as Old.\n<br />\n<br />[/color][/b][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#a2c4c9]I love mods just like anyone else, especially animals and wild life.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />But what do you do when there is a sound fx so loud that it would break a child's eardrum?\n<br />\n<br />So I took the time to reduce the loud sounds that come with these mods so that they can be heard and hopefully not annoying. Not all of the sounds were reduced, just the really loud ones.  A chick, duckling, or pigeon will just peep a little peep rather than get in your face and scream at you.\n<br />\n<br />The peacock sound level was reduced as well but if you kill one, the sound level was not touched.\n<br />\n<br />Easy install, just use NMM and overwrite all when asked or pop the sound files into your data folder and overwrite.\n<br />\n<br />You do not need all of Mihail's bird mods to use this file. Any mods not used will not hurt anything when installed. They are just replacement sound files so no additional .esp files or requirements. Any unused sounds will be ignored anyway.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff]This section is for manual installs for modders.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />Blank .wav file manual install:\n<br />\n<br />This is relatively easy to use. Simply replace the 'blank' name of the .wav file to the one you want to replace and place it into the sound folder where the sound you want to make quiet.\n<br />\n<br />For example: blank.wav would be changed to soundchick.wav and then placed in the proper data/sound folder and overwrite.\n<br />\n<br />This 'blank.wav' file can be used over and over again for other unwanted sounds as well.\n<br />\n<br />Extract the file from the 7zip and then find the sound you want to change in your data folder/sounds and rename the 'blank.wav' file to the same name of the one you want to be quiet and then copy and paste it in and replace.\n<br />\n<br />This is only for .wav files with the same extension. A converter should be used for other extensions such as .fuz extensions.\n<br />\n<br />Be sure to make a backup of the sound file you want to replace in case you change your mind or another suggestion would be to use a sound recorder mod that will reduce the loudness to a more acceptable level.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00]Manual install for the blank.wav only. Do not use NMM or other installers.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to use, redistribute, no credit needed.[/b][/size]",
