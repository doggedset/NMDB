  "descriptionHtml": "[REQUIRES DAWNGUARD]\r\n\r\nUpdate 0.30 is out, if you use an old version update ASAP as the old version, well, probably doesn\\'t work.. Not to mention the new one looks nicer and does work at that.\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/23706-1-1347754060.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nDescription last updated: 0.15\r\n\r\nThis Mod will add a quest-chain of riddles, heroics, mystery and intrigue.  A mad scientist by the name of Dr. Riddler discovers a prophecy to bring about the end of all life in Skyrim, and being the mad genius that he is; left a series of riddles for an unsuspecting hero to discover.  Can you solve his game and stop him before it\\'s too late?\r\n\r\nI would go into details about the plot, but frankly I don\\'t want to give spoilers, and the mod is still in very early development and needs to be shined, and alot more content to be added.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.15:\r\nIncludes beginning quest, first riddle, first dungeon.  Dungeon needs some decorating and better lighting, an actual treasure, but seems to work fine.  Tell me if the first dungeon puzzle is Impossible to complete, although it shouldn\\'t be.  And if there is any way to just cheese it and skip the whole thing.\r\nAnd although only part 1 is complete, don\\'t be afraid to pick up the note for the 2nd quest, when I upload the next patch that note will update and so will the quest.\r\n\r\no begin the quest, go to DragonsReach and read the oh so subtly placed note.\r\n\r\nSome tips about the first dungeon, each lever effects 3 small platforms, each platform has 3 levers attached to it.  Giant blocking platforms have two levers attached.  Also writing riddles is more headache inducing than I figured it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor people curious how I\\'m progressing on the next update:\r\nFixed first puzzle dungeons FPS problem, navmesh was a mess, and a few other issues.\r\nJust finished The Shadow Mansion; a sort of side quest that you do while in the 2nd puzzle dungeon. And 1/4th of the 2nd puzzle dungeon; it\\'s going to be significantly more Interesting than the first.   Sneak through the dark and avoid the light, or else be slain by the evil spirit which reside in the shadow mansion.  And watch your step lest the fire demon get you.\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/23706-1-1347946826.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/23706-2-1347946740.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nCredits and Special Thanks Below\r\nStrolling In a Haunted Forest (music): [url=\\\"http://wingowinston.newgrounds.com/\\\"] WingoWinston[/url]",
