  "descriptionHtml": "[heading] Skirmisher&#39;s Panoply [/heading]\r<br />[line]\r<br />[youtube]uM0bW3YHVyo[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />I wanted a nice place to store and display my **EXTENSIVE** armor collection I have, so I built this barn. It has [color=#ff0000]24 mannequins[/color]. These are separate objects in CK, in order to allow other mannequin mods to exist alongside this without breaking it. These mannequins will always remain the original plain male versions. Because in Syrim, there are no wax figure museums, LOL.\r<br />\r<br />This is for immersive, lore friendly gameplay. There are no weapons or armor. You&#39;re gonna have to go out and get some yourself :)\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=2] INSTALLATION NOTES: [/size][/b]\r<br />It&#39;s an esp file, pop into data folder or install with NMM.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Possible issues:[/b]\r<br />* I never load a savegame where I&#39;m already at the location of a newly installed mod, because sometimes it causes a crash. Walk up to the place like you would in, ahem, &#34;real life&#34;\r<br />* Rarely happens, but if you see a prompt to &#34;talk to statue&#34;, don&#39;t use it. It&#39;s supposed to say &#34;activate mannequin&#34;. This is due to my lack of experience with Creation Kit.\r<br />* Sometimes, the soul gem container prompt won&#39;t show immediately. move about some and it will appear.\r<br />* Yes, the weapon racks are hard to see. Put a weapon on it, looks much better now&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4] A huuuuge thanks to DARKFOX127&#39;s youtube channel and his awesome CK tutorials. Without him, this would not exist. Seriously. [/size]",
