In the dragon tongue it means \\\"Conquerer\\\", it was created by the Aedra in Aetherius to be a weapon for the Dragonborn. The Dovahkiin alone has the power to call it forth from Aetherius. During the dragon war it was sealed away by Alduin its prolonged time away from the dragoborn caused its connection to Mundus to weaken, now it can only be called forth for short periods at a time.\r\n\r\nThe sword is located in a tower by Elder\\'s Blood Peak.
