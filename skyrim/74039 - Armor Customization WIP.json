  "summary": "A WIP mod that allows you to craft pauldrons, greaves, and cuirasses to wear individually or combined for better customization of your character.",
  "descriptionHtml": "   This mod will allow you to craft a variety of pauldrons, greaves, and cuirasses seperately so you have more freedom in armor choice. This is a WIP and I am relatively new to modding, but will continue to fix what I can. I received permission from Mopel to take over his work in &#34;Pauldrons and Greaves&#34; as a new file, and so far have fixed 3 major issues as of version 1.0.\r<br />\r<br />   [u]Fixes:\r<br />\r<br />[/u][list]\r<br />[*]No more underwear clipping through [u]vanilla[/u] armors.\r<br />[*]Greaves can no longer be worn with vanilla armor.\r<br />[/list][list]\r<br />[*]Cuirasses can now be worn without any greaves on (previously legs would become invisible)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />   [u]Issues:\r<br />\r<br />[/u][list]\r<br />[*]Cuirasses have pauldrons attached, so craftable pauldrons can be stacked over them.\r<br />[*]Leather greaves are invisible.\r<br />[*]some pauldrons are a bit oversized.\r<br />[*]known incompatibility with bandolier bags and pouches, currently working on a patch.\r<br />[*]Incompatible with UNP and CBBE.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />   [u]Features:\r<br />\r<br />[/u][list]\r<br />[*]MCM menu for adjusting tempering and armor rating.\r<br />[*]Pauldrons can be mixed and matched (each have individual slots)\r<br />[*]Sliders to adjust armor weight in the skyproc patcher (i myself haven&#39;t done this, but was a feature from Mopel&#39;s version)\r<br />[/list]   [u]\r<br />   Requirements: (for MCM menu)\r<br />[/u]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]SKSE\r<br />[*]SkyUI\r<br />[/list]\r<br />   -If you like the mod please endorse it so we can spread the word and make more improvements.\r<br />\r<br />   -Please feel free to report anything wrong with the mod, there are definitely improvements to be made. Any help/donations would be greatly appreciated and would allow me to spend more of my time working on this mod. I know that I am able to completely fix the mod and nearly perfect it....but that is gonna take a long time. This is simply what I have been able to accomplish in my spare time. I hope you guys enjoy the mod and can help me out with this.",
