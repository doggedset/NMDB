New game (and backup) strongly recommended ![/b][/color][/size][/center]\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n[size=4]Changes from RC0 :\r\n\r\n[color=red]Special thanks to Bentutsi ! It\\'s the man who got rid of the Decals Popping issue !!!! An issue that killed me until today ^^. Go endorse (and download) his tweak here : [URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32426]Distant Decal Lod Animation ini Fix[/URL][/color]\r\n\r\nAs a consequence : Removed Distant Decal Fix from the guide cause no longer needed.\r\n\r\nRemoved [b]Better Fast Travel - Carriages and Ships - Overhauled[/b] because of a couple of issues with Town and Villages.\r\n[/size]\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n[b]Minimum Required :[/b]                                \r\n\r\nDual Core CPU 2.5 Ghz                                  \r\nGeforce GTX 460 1gb                                    \r\n4 gb of DDR-SDRAM                    \r\n\r\n[b]Recommended (playable at 1080p max details) :[/b]\r\n\r\nQuadCore I5 3.2 Ghz\r\nGeforce GTX 680 2gb\r\n6gb of DDR-SDRAM                   \r\n\r\n[b]Magnified Skyrim[/b] is my own vision of the game, polished by hundreds of hours of play.\r\nI was really disappointed and frustated by the vanilla game. I found the game technically and graphically outdated, not adapted to PC, and found too much elements underused.\r\nMy aims are to share with you the way I enjoy Skyrim and guide you to obtain a similar result. The world of Skyrim must be so good looking and entertaining that It\\'ll not bother you to have Fast Travel disabled, the gameplay must be deep, diverse, fun, and keep logic despite taking place in another world. It has to allow a wide variety in playing and be replayable with pleasure. Moreover, it has to be immersive. Finally it has to be CRASH FREE and most possible BUG FREE.\r\n\r\n[color=purple][b]This guide concerns Vanilla content. But you are free to add content after. I consider it more like an improvement of Skyrim than a remake.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nIt\\'s too a way to promote and praise the extraordinary hard work of everybody in this community, especially, those who made the mods I am using. So I didn\\'t create anything !\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Features :[/b] \r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b]A way prettier game[/b] [i](better models, better textures, corrected lighting, corrected shadows, improved view distance, redone faun, flora and characters, improved towns and villages (and more), high-end special effects, cinematic effects,...)[/i]\r\n\r\n[*] [b]Enhanced and rebalanced gameplay[/b] [i](Tweaked IA, unleveled game with revamped difficulty, perks redone, damage localization, combat system redone, management of hunger (with cooking), thirst, fatigue, disease, wetness, coldness (with clothes management), Vampire Playing Redone,...)[/i]\r\n\r\n[*] [b]Improved interface[/b] [i](prettier, easily manageable, lighter, adapted to PC)[/i]\r\n\r\n[*] [b]Tons of other exciting stuffs[/b]\r\n[/list] \r\n[/size]\r\n\r\n[center][size=3][color=green][b]I don\\'t present you this with a developer\\'s point of view, but with a player\\'s point of view. There may have small bugs or not perfectly balanced things I didn\\'t noticed while playing. Besides, I didn\\'t go everywhere or done everything. So I am counting on you to report me annoying bugs or issues to improve this guide.[/b][/color][/size][/center]\r\n\r\nI tried to make this guide as simple and concise as possible, to avoid boredom or discouragement of the reader.\r\nYou can use too the config files I provided. Just be careful with the language setting and the GPU Name.\r\nI provided too my loadorder, if you want to assure yourselves.\r\n\r\nHave fun !",
