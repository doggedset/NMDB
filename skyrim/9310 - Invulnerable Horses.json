  "descriptionHtml": "This mod aims to remove horses from combat. The mod makes the horses invincible and makes them run (a short distance) from every fight after a short delay. Horses shouldn\\'t be combat companions, nor should you have to keep buying new horses. As a plus, I also made it so your horse no longer effects your stealth meter and a side effect of invincibility is that they also have unlimited stamina! \r\n\r\nI tried to achieve this by making them cowardly, removing their prey faction, and then making them essential and invulnerable (just in case). That basically means that this makes it so that everything in the world sees player owned horses the same way they see any other animals. Bandits and Saber Cats still attack our horses, but they no longer ignore you and chase your horse. Also, instead of fighting back, after a second or two, the horse will run away. Don\\'t worry though, it doesn\\'t go far, because the enemy doesn\\'t chase. Also, the horse can\\'t die. He will still whinney when attacked (for immersion) but he doesn\\'t actually take damage. I also didn\\'t want horses to be knocked unconscious because Beth never made a horse unconscious animation, so invulnerable seemed the better option. \r\n\r\nOPTIONAL FILE: \r\n[Better Horses - Hearthfires]: This mod adds the three horses that come with your new homesteads to the list of cowardly invincible allies! \r\n\r\nNOTE: \r\nPlease let me know if anyone sees any errors, or let me know if you have any requests or opinions. I am here to serve! This is a very simple mod; however, so I don\\'t expect any. \r\n\r\nUPDATES: \r\nv2.0 \r\n*Rebuilt from the ground up for the Workshop.\r\n*Changed permissions so that anyone can continue to update the files (I am not planning on maintaining the file on Nexus).\r\n*Made all Horses Cowardly (except Shadowmere - seems Beth wanted him to fight with you). \r\n*Made all Horses essential AND invulnerable (just in case). \r\n*Made it so that your stealth meter won\\'t say seen when only your horse can see you. \r\n*Removed the \\'Prey\\' faction from all horses. \r\nv1.1 \r\n*Made all Horses Cowardly (Including Shadowmere). \r\nv1.2 \r\n*Made all Horses essential AND invulnerable (just in case). \r\n*Made it so that your stealth meter won\\'t say seen when only your horse can see you.",
