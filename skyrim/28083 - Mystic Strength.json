Read here for more information[/url]]Â [/b]\n<br />\n<br />Mystic Strength\n<br />\n<br />Adds four new Alteration spells and associated tomes that allow the player to temporarily increase their carry weight limit. The increase lasts 3 minutes, or 4 and a half minutes with the Stability perk. Dual Casting increases the weight limit buff. The spells will not stack with each other; casting two different spells will simply result in the lesser spell being ignored.\n<br />\n<br />Spells: \n<br />Mystic Strength 25: Apprentice spell that increases weight limit by 25. Apprentice Alteration perk reduces magicka cost.\n<br />Mystic Strength 50: Adept spell that increases weight limit by 50. Adept Alteration perk reduces magicka cost.\n<br />Mystic Strength 75: Expert spell that increases weight limit by 75. Expert Alteration perk reduces magicka cost.\n<br />Mystic Strength 120: Master spell that increases weight limit by 120. Master Alteration perk reduces magicka cost.\n<br />\n<br />Books:\n<br />Spell Tome: Strength 25. Sold randomly by Tolfdir and most court wizards.\n<br />Spell Tome: Strength 50. Sold randomly by Tolfdir and some court wizards.\n<br />Spell Tome: Strength 75. Sold by Tolfdir. *Might* be sold by a few court wizards.\n<br />Spell Tome: Strength 120. Sold only by Tolfdir, after completing the Alteration Ritual Spell quest. Also available in Mzinchaleft, on the table next to the sword, Grimsever.\n<br />\n<br />*New in 1.1*\n<br />All books will be located in a chest situated in the Midden, in the chamber with the Atronach Forge. This chest is put there in case of mod conflicts which causes the spells to not appear in Tolfdir's merchant inventory. Try to resist the temptation to take them if there is no conflict.\n<br />\n<br />If there is such a conflict, make sure to put this mod *above* the conflicting mod in your load order, otherwise this mod will break the other.",
