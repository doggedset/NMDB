  "descriptionHtml": "[b] [color=#ff0000][size=4]Red Dawnguard [b][color=#ff0000][size=4]Heavy [/size][/color][/b]Armor[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />If You&#39;re anything like me, you were a little disappointed that the heavy-armor version of the Dawnguard armor didn&#39;t come in red. After some looking around on the internet, I found many like-minded players but no mod to fix the problem...until now&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This is a basic mod that simply adds the ability to buy a red set of Dawnguard Heavy Armor from Gunmar&#39;s shop. It&#39;s upgradable and I&#39;m fairly sure the anti-vampire enchantment is still intact. It&#39;s available for both male and female characters.\r<br />[color=#ff0000][b][size=4]\r<br />Requirements[/size][/b][/color]\r<br />[size=2]You will need the Dawnguard DLC to use this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff0000][size=4]Installation[/size][/color][/b][/size]\r<br />Unzip BSA and ESP files and add directly to your game&#39;s [i]Data[/i] folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff0000][size=4]Programs Used[/size][/color][/b][size=2]\r<br />The[/size] Creation Kit\r<br />GIMP (With DDS Plugin)\r<br />Nifskope\r<br />BSA Upacker\r<br />\r<br />Special Thanks to the Creation Kit Wiki for its tutorials, the Elderscrolls Wiki for helping me remember Gunmar&#39;s name, all of the fine men and women who made the tools I used, and of course the modding community at large for having forums I can lurk on.",
