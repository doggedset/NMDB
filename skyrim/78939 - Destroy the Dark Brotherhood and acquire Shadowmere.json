Lucien Lachance bequeathed his stead to his successors as the leaders of the DB but how did he do it? [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]Did he leave some tangible artifact that lets you acquire the beast? Well it seems he did, only you must have missed it previously&#33;[/color][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />[color=#fff2cc][size=5]\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS]Once you get the orders to take out the Dark Brotherhood from Commander Maro you can acquire the beast but you&#39;ll have to retrieve the &#34;Deed of Shadowmere&#34; left to future leaders of the Dark Brotherhood by Lucien Lachance, currently in the posession of Arnbjorn who is Astrid&#39;s partner&#33;[/font][/size][/color][size=1]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=6]So what do I have to do? [/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />Head over to the [color=#fff2cc]Dark Brotherhood&#39;s hideout [/color]near Falkreath. Once you get near the [color=#fff2cc]door[/color] you should get a [color=#fce5cd][size=5]message onscreen that the mod has been activated.[/size][/color][color=#fff2cc] [/color]Then head on inside and kill Arnbjorn and retrieve the [color=#fff2cc]Deed of Shadowmere[/color] from him. Or loot his corpse if you&#39;ve taken him out previously. Or pickpocket him, that works too.Â  Then head outside and you should see Shadowmere arise from the dead&#33; Or wherever it is he arises from, either way he shows up in the Black Pool as per usual.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f4cccc][size=2]Having trouble? Take a look at this HD video ([color=#fff2cc]mod activation[/color] message appears top left at 2:27)[/size][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]XKpXc9uv7vo[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ffff00]So how does it work?[/color]\r<br />[size=1]\r<br />[size=2]There is an invisible triggerbox outside the sanctuary that once you&#39;ve reached a certain quest stage on a DB quest makes Shadowmere appear and plays some special FX at the same time. I simply added an extra section that alternatively checks to see if you&#39;ve reached a certain stage on the &#34;Destroy the Dark Brotherhood&#33;&#34; quest and that you&#39;ve also acquired the Deed of Shadowmere from Arnbjorn&#39;s person, be he dead or alive. Its very lightweight it simply adds a note (the deed) and modifies a vanilla script. Thats it.[/size][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4]So why did you make it?[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />Eh, I was disappointed with the reward for destroying the dark brotherhood, a measly 3000 septims and a thank you from Maro. There ought to more of a reward and since you&#39;ve killed them and taken their possessions why not take their horse too? Thats actually a useful reward.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4][size=4][size=4]Dude, why di[/size][/size]d you choose to destroy them?[/size] The DB is awesome&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Hmm thats a whole other debate in itself. Lets just say that some playable characters are moral good and some plain evil. I like to have to have the choice without Bethesda deciding for me with at least some tangible reward for doing &#34;the right thing&#34;, why should the bad guys only ever get the good stuff?&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]I want to tell you you&#39;re wrong&#33; I&#39;m going to post a really long post on the comments section and tell you so&#33;[/color]\r<br />[/size][size=1]\r<br />[size=2]Please don&#39;t, I&#39;m really not interested. Don&#39;t be surprised if it gets removed especially if an argument breaks out. Take it somewhere else&#33;[/size][/size]\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][i][size=1]Fun fact: The vanilla objective index in the CK for when Shadowmere appears is &#34;666&#34;. Which of course is the &#34;Mark of the Beast&#34; in the biblical Book of Revelation. [/size][size=1]At least someone at Bethesda has a sense of humour.[/size][/i]\r<br />\r<br />[/size]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][color=#a61c00][size=6]F.A.Q&#39;s\r<br />Have a problem? Take a look here.[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r<br />[size=1][color=#ffffff][size=3]\r<br />[size=4]THE MOD ACTIVATION POINT IS JUST BEYOND THE DARK BROTHERHOOD DOOR&#33; \r<br />OUTDOORS&#33; AT THE FALKREATH SANCTUARY&#33; [i]NOT[/i] DAWNSTAR&#33; GO THERE&#33;[/size]\r<br />[u]SPEAK TO COMMANDER MARO AT DRAGONBRIDGE FIRST&#33;[/u]\r<br />[b]Then look for Arnbjorn&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=1][color=#ffffff][size=3][color=#ead1dc]Q: I&#39;ve already destroyed the DB&#33; Does that mean I have to start over again?&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[/color][/size][/color][/size][size=1][color=#ffffff][size=3]A: You shouldn&#39;t have to, if you&#39;ve already killed them head inside and look for Arnbjorn&#39;s corpse inside it doesn&#39;t despawn in vanilla, at least it doesn&#39;t in mine.[/size][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ead1dc]Q: Theres no &#34;Deed of Shadowmere&#33;&#34; and he doesn&#39;t show up&#33;[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]A: Did you speak to Commander Maro? He should have given you the &#34;honour&#34; of destroying the DB yourself. Until you do that the option to acquire Shadowmere will not be available. Open the console and type:\r<br /> [color=#cfe2f3]SQV DBdestroy[/color]\r<br /> it should state Quest Stage 30 or higher. You also need to make sure the &#34;Destroy the Dark Brotherhood acquire Shadowmere activated&#33;&#34; message has appeared onscreen (outside the Falkreath sanctuary). Message will appear only once&#33; Then head on inside and look for Arnbjorn or his corpse and search it/him for the deed.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ead1dc]Q: Its still not working&#33; Arnbjorn&#39;s disappeared&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />A: Ok, add a copy of the deed manually by opening the console and type [color=#cfe2f3]player.additem xx[/color][color=#cfe2f3]000D63 1[/color] where &#34;xx&#34; is the load order of this mod then head outside the DB sanctuary Shadowmere should show up then.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ead1dc]Q: Dude, still nothing&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />A: Ok, ok, completely cheat by opening the console and type this while outdoors (not in a city&#33;):\r<br />[color=#cfe2f3]prid 9CCD8\r<br />enable\r<br />addfac db1 0\r<br />moveto player[/color]\r<br />There won&#39;t be any pretty special FX but its better than nothing eh?\r<br />\r<br />[size=1][color=#ffffff][size=3][color=#ead1dc]Q: Ok so why not just give us the console commands in the first place without all this mod crap?&#33;[/color][/size][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />A: Man thats [i]boring&#33;[/i] \r<br />[/size][/color][/size][/center]",
