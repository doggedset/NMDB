  "descriptionHtml": "Kenzie is a barmaid who sought for more, so she trained hard and one day, while adventuring, happened across a chest that contained a nightingale sword and bow. \r\n\r\nNow she uses these weapons to fight at your side. \r\n\r\nShe is located in Riverwood.\r\n\r\nShe is essential, levels with the player, and capable of being married. Her speed is increased 25%, she does not impact the stealth meter, and she is quiet in her movements. \r\n\r\nShe has the nightingale bow and sword, high level versions, and she has a few good spells and hits hard in combat. \r\n\r\nCheck out my other mods:\r\nSnowflake Mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24849\r\nSpot Mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24796\r\nFaren Mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24754\r\nConrad Mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24755",
