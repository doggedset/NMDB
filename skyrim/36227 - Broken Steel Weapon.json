Description\r\nLadies and gentlemen!\r\nHave you ever wondered about play as poor (or very, very mad) warrior but you can\\'t find suitable weapon? This mod is for you! Now you can break your steel sword! Why? Why not! Don\\'t wait anymore.  This version containing only 1h weapon but I\\'m going to add more broken weapons from vanilla. Craftable on any forge under steel category from steel sword. Temperable (sic!) Require Steel Smithing perk.\r\n\r\n2. Install\r\nJust copy content of .rar to skyrim\\\\data and check the .esp file.\r\n\r\n3. Issues\r\nThis is \\\"clean\\\" version of the blade - there is no blood on sword, because changing the shape of \\\"bloodfield\\\" is beyond my skills. If anyone can and want to do this, I have no contraindications.\r\n\r\nSorry for my poor english. I can understand and read everything in this language, but writing is hard. ;p",
