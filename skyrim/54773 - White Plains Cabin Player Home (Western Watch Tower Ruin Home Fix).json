  "descriptionHtml": "DOWNLOAD VERSION 1.2&#33;\r<br />I have fixed the interior to match the exterior, followed suggestions to create a Blacksmithing area which is located right infront of the home.\r<br />Unfortunately, I am unable to replace the hidden chest that was found under the ruined home, I had attempted to copy and paste it back into my file, but that didn&#39;t seem to work, if you have any more suggestions, please tell me&#33;&#33;\r<br />Also there is still no fix on the Followers getting trapped inside the house, or just don&#39;t follow you outside, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much I can do about that&#33; \r<br />Thanks&#33;\r<br />~~ \r<br />\r<br />Are you tired of Whiterun&#39;s Broken House near the Western Watch Tower? Well here, I have re-created an idea to make it a player home for you to enjoy&#33; \r<br />\r<br />This MOD replaces the destroyed house near the Western Whiterun Watch Tower, it has it&#39;s own location so you can fast travel to it. Contains cows, many chickens, a rain catcher tank for decoration (has no use Lol) and a stable for your horse. Also includes an outdoor long table to drink your mead&#33;\r<br />NEW~ Black-smith area&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The inside of the house is very small but useful, contains a few safe containers to store items, 2 beds, alchemy lab and some furniture items for decoration. There are no fancy decorations or weapon plaques, armor mannequins, etc. as I am quite a new and inexperienced modder so please keep that in mind&#33; :)\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: \r<br />None, just Vanilla Skyrim with the latest patch.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thank you&#33;\r<br />\r<br />~Thank you so much to everyone that gave suggestions&#33;&#33;~\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />DoodleBugRain",
