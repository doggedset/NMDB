These are only screenshots as it is not yet in a playable state, but so far I have 2 world spaces with about 5 dungeons and one large interior for the Temple. There is the main town and a small village on a plateau, as well as a few jungle areas and a sunken tomb.\r<br />\r<br />I will come up with a full list of credits for assets used so far once I get a playable version up, but off the top of my head it uses assets by Mr.Siika, Phitts sheogorad rec, Strotis Rec, Tamira&#39;s plant rec. This will not be going on steam workshop only Nexus. I just wanted to see if people would be interested in playing something like this as i ran out of steam on it and have started thinking about getting it going again. I am not looking to form a team but If you would like your assets featured please feel free to contact me about permissions and credits. Thank you for taking an interest in Akavir&#33;\r<br />\r<br />To be done before BETA:\r<br />-finalize existing dungeons\r<br />-Add merchants and npc&#39;s to towns\r<br />-Navmeshing\r<br />-Finalize exterior to existing worldspaces\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />A few unique locales I hope to include after beta would be \r<br />1) a castle being fought over by the Tsaesci-Kapotun\r<br />2) a player home of some description\r<br />3) the ability to export unique goods to Skyrim (for all you merchants out there.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Far, FAR futur plans:(AKA probably not till after ES6)\r<br />-one or more new worldspaces depicting a jungle and desert setting\r<br />-A battle with Tsaesci Navy",
