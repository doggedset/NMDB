A home that hangs off the rock. A home that can now be yours.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nBehind Erikur\\'s house in Solitude is a trapdoor leading down into the underhome. the key is located on the barrel nearby.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nA new player home built hanging from the Solitude arch. It contains a bedroom, dining, lab for all your alchemical and enchanting needs and a forge dug into the arch itself. Also contains a balcony hanging off below.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n======\r\n1. Use NMM to install. Esm and esp should automatically activate once installed.\r\n2. Manually install contents of archive in Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\nMake sure to save outside of the cell being uninstalled. This has been common practice since Fallout 3. If you save inside of a cell and uninstall the mod controlling that cell , all manner of oddness will most definitely occur.\r\n\r\n1. Use NMM\r\n2. Delete the .esp file from your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n=======\r\nBack up your saves. There are known bugs with upgrading mods...unfortunately. I try to have a working and complete mod first time around, but some people make decent suggestions worth implementing. Keep this in mind when upgrading to a newer esp.\r\n\r\nMake sure to save outside of the cell being upgraded. This has been common practice since Fallout 3. If you save inside of a cell and upgrade the mod controlling that cell , all manner of oddness will most definitely occur.\r\n\r\n1. Unless otherwise stated in the download description, uninstall old version with NMM and install and activate new version...easy stuff. Updates may just be overwrites and not require the  entire mod to be uninstalled first.\r\n2. Manually remove old esm and esp files from Skyrim/Data folder. Install new ones. \r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nFor future use. Please report any you find.\r\n \r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nNone so far.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\nv1.0\r\nInitial Release\r\n\r\nTo Do\r\n======\r\nAdd a small quest to get the key\r\nRefine exterior\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nCreation Kit\r\n7-Zip - http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=15579\r\n\r\n",
