  "descriptionHtml": "---README---\r\n\r\nfor DALLs - Skelos_Weapons\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\n\r\n12/05/2012\r\n\r\nSkelos_Weapons are beautiful (Ebony) weapons you can make (blacksmith) yourself. As these weapons come in, varying levels of (built-in) enchantment and can be sharpened / improved even further - you will have choice of crafting them to fit your own preferences / specifications.\r\n\r\nStory: On your travels you have come in possession of fabled n very much feared Book of Skelos - ancient magical tome - which beside many other - now long time forgotten - arcane formulas and spells contains (blacksmith crafting) recipes for enchanted weapons made of ultimate arcane material - Ebony. These - new to game - crafting recipes require only you (smithing ability) to know how to make/craft Ebony arms n armor. Any blacksmith forge will do and crafting materials required (for arms manufacturing) are standard / in-game fare. \r\n\r\nThese weapons are more powerful n (visually) much better balanced than anything else you can find in the vanilla game but two of them stand head n shoulder above all other - namely Skelos Bow and notorious Skelos - Ebony Katana. In my opinion - these unique (Ebony) weapons are as desirable as they are beautiful.\r\n\r\nIf you like, their look and you want other (in-game) Ebony weapons to look same check / use my (textures only) Ebony_Weapons mod.\r\n\r\nTo install you need to navigate to your Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim - game folder and paste / drag n drop in it my Data (mod) folder. Allow overwrite!    \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like them, simply delete / remove my (mod) .esp and files from Data/DallsGear/weapons/ebony (meshes n textures).\r\n\r\nBugs/conflicts: none known.\r\n\r\nNote on v1.1: New Skelos (bow) and Skelos Dragonbone Arrows added. I was kind of hopping to add here my old Oblivion bow - Skelos - which I have in my game as Dragonbone Skelos - but as its Skyrim model is still off (public use) limits - instead you are getting here my brand-new (Quicksilver) Skelos - ultimate Skyrim bow which is based on different bow mesh (model). If serious Archer I think, you\\'ll love it! ;)\r\n\r\nUse:\r\nFree to use but if any files included (therein) are to be used for modding ask me for permission!\r\n\r\nEnjoy and try to remember - if you like it even in a part - to give endorsement! \r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for really great game.\r\n\r\n",
