  "descriptionHtml": "What this mod does, is changing the damage multipliers for all the difficulties to 1, for both the player, and the enemies.\r<br />\r<br />I always hated how playing on Legendary would make an enemy with a stick hit me for x6 the damage I would hit him with, if I had been using the same stick.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s really just a quick tweak that I did for my own use, but I guess someone else might want something similar as-well, so why not share it?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I would not recommend using this on vanilla skyrim however, because then the game would become way to easy.\r<br />\r<br />For making it harder and also more fun, I would recommend using the mods listed below.\r<br />\r<br />Deadly Combat\r<br />Attack Commitment No turning during attacks\r<br />Combat Behavior Improved\r<br />TK HitStop\r<br />Combat Evolved - Core\r<br />Pseudo parry animation mod\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />FAQ\r<br />\r<br />Q: Why not just use the vanilla adept difficulty?\r<br />A: Cus with this tweak I can now longer change the difficulty to make the game easier, if I were to meet a hard boss or something.",
