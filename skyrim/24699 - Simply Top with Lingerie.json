  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=20]Simply Top with Lingerie[/size][/center]\r<br />Attention:\r<br />Rather than updating this mod, all future updates to these and any new additions will be given directly to the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24684]UNP Clothing Merchant - All the Items by Petrovich[/url] mod for inclusion to the game.  ---  Please see that mod for further updates/additions.  Thank you\r<br />\r<br />This mod provides:\r<br />-- Petrovich&#39;s Simply Top with lingerie layered underneath\r<br />There are three versions all available for purchase at Belethor&#39;s: Black, White & Pink\r<br />-- Offers Pink lingerie for sale as a separate piece also at Belethor&#39;s (for simplicity sake)\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]UNP Main body[/url] -- for body textures\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17338]UNP Curvy Body[/url] -- for modified hand & feet meshes -- if you want\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16658]UNP Simply Clothes[/url] -- for Simply Top textures & to ensure that Petrovich&#39;s items get to be used too.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />NMM is recommended.\r<br />Manual is possible by extracting the contents of the mod archive to the Skyrim directory (data folder is included in archive)\r<br />\r<br />Removal:\r<br />NMM if it was used to install. Else extract the contents of the archive to a clean location and copy/paste the contents into the Skyrim directory. Then right click and choose undo copy. That will remove all files placed by this mod.\r<br />\r<br />Please Note:\r<br />If you install my mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24702]UNP Undies Lingerie as Body Replacer[/url] before or after installing this mod, you will on the second mod be prompted to overwrite the lingerie texture files. This is intentional and you may safely overwrite or say no, either way both mods will work.\r<br />\r<br />Load Order:\r<br />This must come after UNP Simply Clothes. If you do not include UNP Simply Clothes you will have some missing textures.\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues:\r<br />-- Inventory image is close but not quite as accurate as the actual mesh combination used by the player. Lingerie may be seen clipping thru in the inventory image at the shoulder strap. Its really minor and I&#39;m not that concerned about it.\r<br />-- There may be some clipping with the lingerie portion and pants/shorts/skirts that you may choose to wear.  This is why I made these as separate items rather than replacing the original Simply Top.  If the clipping is a problem, the original Simply Top without any lingerie is available for use.\r<br />\r<br />Original UNP Undies can be found here: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24444]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24444[/url]\r<br />Original UNP Simply Clothes can be found here: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16658]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16658[/url]\r<br />",
