Has a pseudo-unique set of armour.\r\n\r\nShe can be found in the Dead Man\\'s Drink in Falkreath, she is essential (cannot die) and is marriageable. I set her height to 0.9 and her voice to \\\"Young Eager Female\\\". She has no home so will just hang out wherever you dismiss her, and will sandbox around. I also gave her some perks befitting a ranger/rogue type character.\r\n\r\nPlease note - Her armour will look different to the images. Her armour is actually the Thieves Guild Master armour with the enchantments removed and altered stats. Sorry for any confusion that may arise...\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]BACK STORY?[/b][/u]\r\nI suppose I did not give a lot of thought to her back story, but I imagined her as an ex-Imperial scout who went AWOL one day after a particularly nasty episode where her brethren were all killed during an ambush. Her scarred face reflects this and her dangerous life in the wilds, and before you ask, no - I don\\'t want to remove her scars.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]SOME OF MY OTHER MODS[/b][/u]\r\n- [URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19841]LIAT - Lively Inns and Taverns[/url]\r\n- [URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27807]Millview - A lovingly Crafted Player Home[/url]\r\n- [URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23216]Bard\\'s Lute[/url]\r\n- [URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26478]Erys[/url]\r\n- [URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27975/]Custom Music In Your House[/url]\r\n- [URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26589]Passtime[/url] (alpha test)\r\n- [URL=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showtopic=832425]LTC - Lively Towns and Cities[/url] (coming soon!)",
