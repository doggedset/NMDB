  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/40121-1-1376266240.png[/img]\r<br />This is a very simple mod that adds a few torches in Helgen Keep for lighting-up the beginning of your adventure. If you noticed, there are no portable torches in the start of the game (all wall torches are static) and it can be very difficult to look around and explore the keep. This mod is recommended for players who use lighting mods and ENBs that make dungeons very dark. \r<br />Torches are not lit-up and must be looted from the following containers:\r<br />1. in one of the chests in the imperial quarters (only if you followed Hadvar)\r<br />2. from the corpse of dead stormcloak soldier Gunjar\r<br />3. In the barrel containing the potions (I also added a couple of extra health potions)\r<br />\r<br />These should be enough to get you started.\r<br />\r<br />To install, just extract the contents into your Skyrim data folder or use NMM.\r<br />[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/40121-2-1376266241.jpg[/img]",
