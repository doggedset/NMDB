  "descriptionHtml": "I know a lot of people have had the same problem with Skyrim Romance-- the game freezes or CTDs when trying to load the Grand Ball scene, especially on heavily modded games. So I created a new game with nothing more than Skyrim, Update, and Romance enabled. [i]Nothing [/i]else has been done in game. I created as small a footprint as possible. I avoided activating anything I could such as locations or scripted events. The save is immediately after leaving the grand ball.",
