  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static.skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/images/1603876-1323393918.png[/img]\r\nThis is a bit of an extension to the DarkStar Textures â€“ Armor mod; this is a similar granny tweak to road, bridge and related textures i.e. the edging and dirt cliffs as well as the rock. There were several rather low resolution images that I bumped up to 1024 or belter but I wasnt aiming at a HD texture mod rather a good visual quality in the style Im fond of.\r\n\r\nAs with any of my mods feel free to use any of my work as you like.\r\n",
