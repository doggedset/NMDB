  "descriptionHtml": "Hello fellow adventurers&#33;\r<br />\r<br />As a user of Vurt&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/141/?]Skyrim Flora Overhaul[/url] I have always considered some of the fall forest textures too dull, rather empty for the purpose and easily becoming repetitive for the eye. Eventually it all looks too &#34;organized&#34; when looking at fallen leaves, so I decided to had some &#34;confusion&#34; to it. As for vanilla textures..well I think there&#39;s no point debating its quality.. \r<br />\r<br />Therefore I decided to create my own textures to replace it. I have been using and playing with it since then and I think it blends really well with the rest of SFO textures at least. I also use the Fall Forest Leaves Texture Replacement that you can find in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42370/?]Unique Grasses and Groundcovers[/url] mod. My texture replaces the file [color=#e69138]fallforestdirt01[/color]. Unique Grasses replaces the [color=#e69138]fallforestleaves01[/color] file. Both textures go very well together although I have desaturated the latter to provide a better blending for me. \r<br />\r<br />You can install it manually or via NMM/MO. I hope you enjoy the results as much as I do. Below you can find a comparison between these textures and SFO textures. You can also check the images section for some screenshots [color=#f1c232](my game is heavily modded with textures and also using ENB so results may vary. I also use SFO Basic Edition, Unique Grasses and Groundcovers and Skyrealism Grass)[/color]. [u]Let me know what you think.[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#e06666]Apparently it works with vanilla Skyrim but I&#39;m not sure how it will blend with the rest because I have not tested it - so be warned. For SFO users, it will work beautifully (I think).[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Textures are [color=#00ffff]1K[/color].\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff][center][size=3]fallforestdirt01[/size][/center][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://s28.postimg.org/jbzx85t5p/Comparison.jpg[/img]",
