  "summary": "This is my new &#34;one-stop&#34; mod that includes a bunch of my new CK work. I will be getting a lot of stuff put together over the next two weeks, so keep an eye on this mod, because there could be a new addition to my Compilation at any time during the times of 10:00am to 9:00pm EST. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Pipboy Haven\r<br />This is the ideal home for the male Skyrim adventurer. It includes 19 different rooms to use as your stash house and it has the most fame out of my mods, so far. \r<br />\r<br />Raven Rock Rebuilt\r<br />This is just a small mod that replaces the Vacant lots in Raven Rock and adds a small stable outside the city gates.\r<br />\r<br />Winterhold Rebuilt\r<br />This is a overhaul on the town (not the college), it will include a few new stores and a couple of houses. Nothing too extreme.\r<br />\r<br />Modder Resource Pack\r<br />This will take a while to actually have available to use for your own mods, because I will be contacting all the original authors of the items I will be adding into the resource, so that way it&#39;s all legit and nobody gets in Shit because of copyright issues.\r<br />\r<br />Pipgirl Haven\r<br />This is the ideal home for the female Skyrim adventurer. It will pretty much be the female version of the Pipboy Haven, so it won&#39;t be done until the last of my mod compilation, because it will take 3 days to build, just like Pipboy Haven did.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements...\r<br />All 3 DLCs\r<br />SKSE\r<br />Amazing Follower Tweaks (Optional)",
