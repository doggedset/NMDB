Modular will be better as Jjinx has messed up some formulae somehow (pickpocket chance) I got over this by massively buffing pickpocket perks (like 10* chance)\r\n\r\nQ) so someone else made this mod?\r\nA) yes\r\n\r\nQ) what happened to them?\r\nA) Jjinx was doing well with this mod, but then they stopped work for exams and during that time they lost all the data on their PC and didn\\'t have the drive to develop this mod anymore. This mod was dead for a long time heavily bugged with no updates, I saw this mod and fell in love with it so I just had to keep it going. You have to understand I have very limited modding capabilities, but I\\'m learning new stuff everyday, so we\\'ll see how things go.\r\n\r\nQ) why you know has good quality screen shots >:(\r\nA) I\\'m lazy... So I did them quickly on my laptop\r\n\r\nSERIOUSLY though if a more talented modder comes along and wants to pick this up I\\'ll be happy to hand Jjinx\\'s amazing work with my edits over to the modder it deserves\r\n\r\nplease post any suggestions/problems you have with this mod\r\n\r\nI want to unlock most prerequisite perks for the ones that don\\'t make sense, I have started this with smithing and speechcraft\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n[img]http://static.lockerz.com/decalz/W600/image001370186001415h2ttby.png[/img]\r\nJjinx for being AWESOME and making Perky, Uriel24 for fixing the unlimited poison effect glitch in the previous mod, Bethesda for making skyrim and their Creation Kit, my mum, my dad, my agent, Yadda yadda yadda...\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n[img]http://static.lockerz.com/decalz/medium/image001370193206751z5oxf8.png[/img]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3664999]scorpiongod[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2050740/?]dutcher[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2136738/?]FireFlickerFlak[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1805589/?]madscirat[/url]\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n[img]http://static.lockerz.com/decalz/W600/image0013701859675370ljzpp.png[/img]\r\nJjinx says this should be open source and thus it shall remain, do what you wnat with it but list Jjinx as the original creator (you can credit me too if you want :) )\r\n\r\nSo feel free to translate\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12862/?][img]http://static.lockerz.com/decalz/W600/image0013701859512480lxv7a.png[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nClick him ^ <(^-^<) <(^-^)> (>^-^)>\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nFinally a message to all haters:\r\n[img]http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/movies/2013-05-29/47f1ffb3-29f8-42ab-8765-9a9ddb67f1dc_Leprechaun-Trailer-aniston-gun.gif[/img]\r\n\r\nLIKE PERKY OR FEEL HER WRATH",
