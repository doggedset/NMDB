  "descriptionHtml": " With this mod you can learn a spell to summon a Raven to fight and follow you. There are two .esp files, one is summon Raven, the other is Raven  AS A follower. The Raven has sounds but sometimes are not heard, dont know why. And the follower Raven dismiss command does not dismiss.  These problems I am trying to fix but the CK hates me... So I am uploading this version for now. \r<br /> Watch the videos to see in game.\r<br />\r<br /> The spell tome is at Grave Concoctions in Falkreath..The followers home is Anises Cabin.\r<br />\r<br /> Please comment because it may help to fix the issues I am having.  Thanks BG\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> Please ask permission for use and give credits.",
