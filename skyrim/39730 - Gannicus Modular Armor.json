  "descriptionHtml": "REVENGE OF THE SEXIFIED HOUSECARLS III - DOVAH OF THE ARENA\r<br />\r<br />Hoamaii Gannicus Modular Armor - 2k textures\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />A LITTLE BACKSTORY:\r<br />\r<br />Some of you, gentle Tamriel Dovahkiins, may already have heard the trouble I&#39;ve had with my over-modded Female Housecarls&#39; obsessions to craft skimpy armors for guys behind my back and force me to wear them at swords&#39; points, so I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll sympathize with the urge I felt to accidentally &#34;lose&#34; Lydia, Jordis and Iona in the dark Tropical forest of Druadach Mountains, very far from any civilized forge. (Aela was stuck in werewolf form, werewolves cannot use forges, hehe…)\r<br />\r<br />To no avail, I must confess. The &#34;trouble&#34; with Skyrim, you see, is that this world keeps living even though you&#39;re not around to witness it (some tell me it is also true in the real world though I find it hard to believe).\r<br />\r<br />And as I was urgently sailing to the remote island of Solstheim carrying my own burden for a change, my 3 &#34;Amazing Follower Tweaked&#34;, level 81, girls bravely carried on, brutally murdering all dragons and sabertooth cats between Markarth and Solitude and bartering their way into an Orcist stronghold to gain access to a forge. That is where they heard this legend about some Gaelic gladiator hero named Gannicus, whatever a gladiator may be, and plotted to craft his armor for me.\r<br />\r<br />And would you believe it? I did not even have to find them, THEY managed to find me. I must say the armor is a bit more decent than their previous ones, one version of the subligaria is a bit too breezy for my taste but Marcurio seems to enjoy the cool evening Whiterun air on his butt. So there it is, in case you guys want to try it - why should I be the only Dovahkiin to endure his Housecarls&#39; wrath?..\r<br />\r<br />Next time, I&#39;ll try and hide in Blackreach, they&#39;ll never find me there, will they?.. (and I&#39;m definitely not giving them my NMM password&#33;..)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />MOD DESCRIPTION:\r<br />\r<br />This standalone, modular armor consists of 8 different armor pieces, \r<br />\r<br />- Subligaria (underwear - 2 versions) - slot 32 (body)\r<br />- Pauldrons, right shoulder alone or both shoulders - slot 58.\r<br />- Arena Belt - slot 52\r<br />- Leggings: right, left or both legs - slot 53\r<br />- Boots: suede boots or Caligae (Roman boots enclosed in sandals) - slot 37 (feet)\r<br />- Greaves (protecting lower leg) - slot 48\r<br />- Plate Gauntlets - slot 33 (hands)\r<br />- Leather Bracelets and Mixed Gauntlets (plate on right hand, leather on left) - slot 59\r<br />- Cod Piece - slot 49\r<br />\r<br />This should allow you 72 possible combinations, more if you combine these with my other mods.\r<br />\r<br />Most items are inspired by Gannicus&#39; arena armor worn in Season 2 &#34;Vengeance&#34;, the Cod Piece was &#34;borrowed&#34; from the series character Crixus&#39;, the mistakes and goofs are entirely mine. This is my first serious attempt at texturing , I am very aware of my limitations and yet very far from CaBaL&#39;s awesome talents. But on the bright side, I can only get better in my next attempts (hopefully).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS:\r<br />\r<br />Better Males - Sundracon version or FavoredSouls version both available on the same thread: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488\r<br />\r<br />Pick only one main file according to your body  mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO GET IT IN GAME:\r<br />\r<br />All items are fully craftable at any forge under the Orcist category (no perk required), temperable at any workbench and enchantable at any enchanting table. Just remember this is male only, meshed for the Sundracon body and for the FavoredSouls body for the time being (may look weird on Vanilla - especially the waist items).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY:\r<br />\r<br />This is not yet compatible with SoS, the SoS version will be uploaded as another standalone mod.\r<br />\r<br />Other than that, this should be compatible with almost anything as most male armors do not use these slots, and in any case you will still be able to wear cloaks (Cloaks of Skyrim or Winter is Coming), backpacks, bandanas and any piece of jewelry. There may be some minor conflicts with some Bandoliers Bags and Pouches items - conflicts merely meaning that you cannot equip both in the same time. \r<br />\r<br />The only minor downside you should be aware of is that, for the moment, the leather bracelets and mixed gauntlets do not use the usual &#34;hand&#34; slot assigned to gloves (or else the wrist skin in the open bracelets would be invisible), meaning you need to unequip whatever gloves or gauntlets you&#39;re wearing before you equip these - at worst if you forget to unequip your current gauntlets, your character will be wearing both which will look odd but is unable to cause crashes or lags. \r<br />I have not yet found a satisfying way to have the skin show in the leather bracelets while still using the hand slot, but as soon as I have found one, I&#39;ll upload a better version.\r<br />\r<br />Other than that, this is just an armor mod, it cannot break your game in any way. \r<br />\r<br />Clippings:\r<br />Contrarily to most other male armors which do not include a body inside the meshes, these items are closely shaped around the body mesh to be equipped, as in life, on top of one another: belt and cod piece over underwear, greaves over boots and leggings, etc. \r<br />Though I have done my best to avoid any major clipping issue, I had to make choices between &#34;fitting&#34; and &#34;clipping&#34; in a few instances, and I chose &#34;fitting&#34; - I do not like pauldrons or underwear or leggings floating around my character in game, it is a personal choice and I&#39;m sorry to impose it on you.\r<br />As a consequence, you may find that some items may clip in the body or with other items when using some custom animations - it was impossible for me to cover them all, sorry.\r<br />Some items may be combined with Vanilla ones too, but in most cases you&#39;ll find that the Vanilla armor parts cover the Gannicus ones - I tried to model the greaves to be equipped over Vanilla boots for instance but gave up when I found out I would have had to shape them as &#34;barrels&#34; around my character&#39;s legs which looked incredibly stupid when equipped on their own - sorry again.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />The easiest way is to use NMM. \r<br />\r<br />If not, you probably do know your way around data files but just in case: drop the meshes in your data&#92;meshes&#92;armor directory and the textures in your data&#92;textures&#92;armor directory, don&#39;t forget to add the .esp in your data folder, and to check it either in NMM or/and in you launcher data files.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation goes exactly the other way around.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />ACKNOWLEGEMENTS AND THANKS:\r<br />\r<br />- FavoredSoul and Sundracon for their great Better Males meshes and textures: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488\r<br />- Nightasy for putting together a great tutorial and teaching me what little I know and a lot more about creating custom armors: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19249\r<br />- DeMoNhUnTeR1986 (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/5251077), creator of great mods and tutorials, for generously bearing my endless questions and patiently providing valuable tips,\r<br />- Brokefoot (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3575696) whose mods have been a great source of inspiration and whose armors have ignited my Housecarls vengeful attitudes,\r<br />- FavoredSoul for kindly explaining how to assign meshes to body parts: http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/576983-tutorial-assign-meshes-to-new-body-parts/\r<br />- AmesthystDeceiver for offering a consensus on how to assign unused biped nodes: http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/556424-body-part-ids-for-unused-biped-nodes-consensus/\r<br />- All the Nexus teams and members for creating such an inspiring Website,\r<br />- Bethesda, for creating a great storyworld and giving us the tools to customize it (almost) any way we like,\r<br />\r<br />… and last but not least, all users of my previous mods, whose endorsements and friendly posts have encouraged me to keep on modding - my deepest thanks to all of you, guys and girls&#33;.. ?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />FURTHER PLANS FOR DEVELOPMENTS (no real order, just as they come to mind):\r<br />\r<br />- custom version of the dagger to replace the shiv - and hopefully be playable.\r<br />- custom dual blades on back, like Gannicus wore them in the series. \r<br />- Gannicus bundle on back and mantle.\r<br />- blue version of this armor for those of you who prefer &#34;cooler&#34; colors.\r<br />- 1k texture version of the main file.\r<br />- FavoredSoul&#39;s version of meshes (but that could take a little while) - done.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />SCREENSHOTS: \r<br />\r<br />I had Tropical Skyrim on when I took them, which makes all the reds brighter. I&#39;ve included a few interior shots to show you what it looks like in Vanilla Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />The armors my Female Housecarls are wearing are a combination of Brokefoot&#39;s UNP Mashup armors (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20415) and Hagrid&#39;s UNP armored bikini (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21324) on Jordis, TheminBlack&#39;s UNPB shop&#39;s Barbarian armor on Lydia and Skyforge Ancient Nord armor on Iona (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19004).\r<br />\r<br />The leg bandage on the Subligaria replacer screenshot is from my other mod, &#34;Hoamaii Armor Mashup for Male&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />TOOLS USED:\r<br />\r<br />- Autodesk 3ds Max\r<br />- Nifscope\r<br />- Gimp\r<br />- Photoshop\r<br />- Bethesda&#39;s Creation Kit\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />MY OTHER MODS:\r<br />\r<br />- Revenge of the Sexified Housecarls: Hoamaii Armor Mashup for male: [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35333]Revenge of the Sexified Housecarls[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Revenge of the Sexified Housecarls II: Hoamaii InnerWear for male: [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35940]Hoamaii Inner Wear for Male[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Revenge of the Sexified Housecarls IV - Hoamaii Modular Iron Armor: [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58482]Hoamaii Modular Iron Armor[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Have Pita on Lydia - Hoamaii Meat Sandwich: [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57435]Hoamaii Meat Sandwich[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Wine and Beer In Tankards: animobjects and static objects replacers [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59260]Wine and Beer In Tankards[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />or [color=#548dd4][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62903]Clearsky Hideout - Fully Animated Playerhouse[/url][/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]CAk4FO8YtrU[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />And, uh, I am French, so please pardon my French… English ;)",
