  "summary": "Find Grandmaster Elys for training.  She will train you in any skill at any level to any level.  Created with the Skrim -Community- Uncapper mod in mind for levels over 90, this mod will work with vanilla Skyrim and does not require SKSE or the uncapper mod.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=5][color=yellow]Grandmaster Elys has come to Skyrim[/color][/size][/center]\r<br />[center][size=3]&#34;Lust your life is.  Lost your life is.&#34; *[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=1]* Though She will make an exception for you. You will survive an encounter.[/size]\r<br />Grandmaster Elys travels throughout Skyrim, staying at Inns a couple to several days at a time. \r<br />When you find Her, you can ask Her to train you in any skill.  \r<br />\r<br />As long as you have the gold...\r<br />\r<br />She is not inexpensive. Nor does She take just your gold.  Nor will She train you for as long as you want. \r<br />She may decide She&#39;s had enough and simply disappear on you. Then you&#39;ll have to find Her again.\r<br />\r<br />She is Succubi.\r<br />\r<br />She takes a 3rd of your current health, magicka, and stamina each time She trains you.\r<br />She also takes some (or all) of your regeneration powers. (Make sure you have lots of potions if you decide you want to go adventuring right after training.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Big thanks to Elys for letting me use her name for this mod.\r<br />\r<br />There will undoubtedly be a few glitches here and there.  I&#39;ve tried to be thorough in testing, but... you know how it goes.\r<br />\r<br />This mod does NOT require SKSE or the Skyrim -Community- Uncapper mod, though it was created with them in mind and they are recommended.  This release will work perfectly fine with vanilla Skrim as well.\r<br />\r<br />Requires Skyrim 1.8.151, earlier versions not supported.\r<br />\r<br />Nuts and bolts:\r<br />This is an open ended quest that adds a journal entry so that you may toggle the quest marker to find Grandmaster Elys.\r<br />She randomly chooses one of the 16 inns of Skyrim to stay at for 2 to 6 days.\r<br />She will randomly choose to train you X number of times (up to six) before vanishing and going to another inn.\r<br />Training cost 2500 gold per level up to level 50.  After that, cost is Level X Level.\r<br />\r<br />In addition, not only does training take time, but each training session also reduces your regeneration of health, magicka, and staimina.\r<br />(Wearing enchanted items are not affected in Stages 1-4.)  You are fatigued for the amount of training time it takes. See below.\r<br />\r<br />Stage 1, 2 hours training game-time - 25% for 6 real-time minutes.\r<br />Stage 2, 4 hours training game-time - 50% for 12 real-time minutes.\r<br />Stage 3, 8 hours training game-time - 75% for 24 real-time minutes.\r<br />Stage 4, 12 hours training game-time - 100% for 36 real-time minutes.\r<br />Stage 5, 16 hours training game-time - 125% for 48 real-time minutes.\r<br />Stage 6, 24 hours training game-time - 150% for 72 real-time minutes.\r<br />(1 minute of real-time equals 20 minutes of game-time at the default timescale.)\r<br />",
