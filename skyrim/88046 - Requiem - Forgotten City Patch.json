  "descriptionHtml": "I decided to play a little bit of the Forgotten city and found out that the final boss was a supreme push-over. So i decided to try my hand at creating a patch. This is my first Patch but here&#39;s pretty much exactly what it does:\r<br />- Adds perks to the enemies and enemy variety you may encounter.\r<br />- Makes most enemies a static level to help fit into to requiems unleveled world\r<br />   (This persumably makes the final boss not a pushover if you encounter him right after helgen, where as he only decides to use the shock spell. I still think the purpose of this mod should be more focused in its story however so most enemies are just level 5 to 15, some with rather mediocre perks)\r<br />- Created for Requiem 1.9.4.1 and The Forgotten City 1.8.1\r<br />\r<br />DONT TREAT THIS AS AN WELL MADE PATCH&#33; Literally created this in about 30 minutes. In no way is this some sort of &#34;NRM&#34; Patch er something. I personally just made this as something to keep as a placeholder till someone who actually knows what hes doing starts to create a patch for this.\r<br />\r<br />Send in any bugs or leveling issues you have. Or simply if the boss is too easy or hard.",
