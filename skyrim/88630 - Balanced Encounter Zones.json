  "descriptionHtml": "In Skyrim, an encounter zone is the minimum and maximum level between which enemies will scale to your player. So if an encounter zone has a minimum level of 20, a character that is level 6 will be treated as a level 20.\n<br />The vanilla game makes limited use of this, and usually the encounter zones are far too low in level to \n<br />\n<br />This is simply my personal encounter zone modification that is tailored to my preference, it is designed for Morrowloot Ultimate and is heavily based off of permazones.\n<br />\n<br />Morrowloot comes with its own encounter zones (also based off of permazones) so you should open all 3 mods (this, morrowloot, and permazones) in tes5edit to compare and see which one you prefer.\n<br />I haven't seen too many other encounter zone mods, so I decided to upload mine. Maybe someone will prefer it.\n<br />\n<br />Generally speaking, this mod is a happy medium in between vanilla and permazones.\n<br />\n<br />High Level Enemies is highly recommended for this sort of mod, simply to make sure that there are higher level variants of enemies to \n<br />pull from (and thankfully, with this encounter zone mod, you will only see the high level variants in high-level areas, so no level 90 \n<br />bandits in riverwood)\n<br />Encounter Zones Unlocked is a must if you want to install this sort of mod mid-game, and is good to have either way.",
