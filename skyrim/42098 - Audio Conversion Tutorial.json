File archive includes all images and four document types (.txt, .rtf, .doc, .odt) so anyone should be able to read it.\r\n\r\nThis was all made by me, using the Creation Kit and these tools:\r\nBSA Unpacker @ The Nexus\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4804/? \r\nSkyrim Audio Converter @ The Nexus\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8303/?\r\n\r\nThis guide explains file types (XWM, WAV), the benefits of compiling into a BSA instead of loose files, and how to add NEW tracks for additional music. All of this document was written by me, and all screenshots were taken by me on my own computer.\r\n\r\nNo, I cannot/will not provide you with any mp3s or audio packs here. You\\'ll have to do that yourself. Feel free to share this if you credit me.",
