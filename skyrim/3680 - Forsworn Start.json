  "descriptionHtml": "Well,this is my first Skyrim mod.It\\'s very simple and I\\'m sure that someone else too did it(though he didn\\'t uploaded it for obvious,difficulty-related reasons),yet,I think it\\'s a decent start,and,also,not anyone can make an alternative start so...why not?\r\nBasically,it makes you start as a Forsworn(with,obviously,Forsworn stuff and you as a part of the Forsworn faction,so they do not attack you)in Serpent\\'s Bluff Redoubt.You start INSIDE the dungeon,but,of course,just near the door to the exterior.\r\n\r\n\r\nInconvenients/bugs\r\n-you don\\'t start as a dragonborn,the storyline is completely disabled\r\n-markath guards attack you,since forsworn and markath guards are set to be hostile\r\n\r\nTo install,copy the Skyrim.ini in your My Games/Skyrim folder,and the \\\"forsworn\\\"text file in your Skyrim folder.Then start Skyrim and type \\\"bat forsworn\\\"  (no quotation marks).",
