  "summary": "Makes Night Eye effect less overpowered",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes Night Eye less overpowered. If you are using mods like Realistic lighting, and/or Darker Dungeons for ENB, or any other mod that makes night time dark and the dungeons dark to the point where having a torch or night eye is a must, and you are playing a character that has night eye, then this mod might be for you.\r\n\r\nWhat I was seeing is that the default Night Eye effect was overpowerer, there was no disadvantage for using it, and it was to easy to be enticed to keep it on all the time while in dungeons, therefore negating any lighting mods like Realistic lighting or Darker Dungeson for ENB.\r\n\r\nSo what I did is increase the Radial blur to take up most of the screen, with a small area in the middle that is not blurred, and then dropped the brightness down a bit.\r\n\r\nThis will make it so that one might not want it on all of the time, but use it to check out what is in front of them, and then make a plan on how to proceed.\r\n\r\nWhen in battles in dark areas, I tend to drop a torch on the ground so I can see the NPC I am fighting, instead of using Night Eye during the battle.\r\n\r\nAnyways, hope other people find this mod usefull.\r\n\r\nInstall Instructions:\r\njust install the radialblur.esp into your skyrim/data folder",
