  "descriptionHtml": "Your character is muddling along, from place to place, and finally you get to go into the mysterious Pelagius Wing, a place that is so haunted, so evil, that it is sealed off and no one, not a single soul, sets foot in there.  Not for 100 years.  You carefully open the door and step into the ... brightly lit room.\r\n\r\nOk, so what\\'s the deal?  Someone popped in before you and took the time to light every candle they could find?  Probably the same guy who gets to all the dungeons that no one has been into for hundreds of years and turns on the lights for you.  I want to find this guy.  Seriously.\r\n\r\nThis mod darkens the Wing by removing the candles and associated light sources.  The only light is from various windows, so it is dark in there with vanilla lighting.\r\n\r\nBring a torch.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Some changes were made to improve the lighting in the back stairway and the main level.  The fireplace was lit from the light coming in the windows on the second floor, and windows on the main floor in an inaccessible room did not have light coming in.  Since it is possible to peek into this room through the boarded up doorway, I decided to add this for atmosphere. On the lower level in the far corner, near the sleeping area, restored a single light.  I am on the fence about this since it is not clear that anyone is sleeping there.  It is not visible outside the room and if no one sees the light, is the light really there?",
