  "descriptionHtml": "A simple mod that removes the JaySuS signature from loading screens and also attempts to improve their flow, wording and grammar.\r<br />\r<br />My mod does not contain JaySuS Swords assets and the original V13C JaySuS swords file is required:\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1002/?\r<br />\r<br />Installation is either download and double-click with NMM or extract to Data folder and overwrite JSwords.esm. Install after JaySuS V13C. (At the time of uploading, the latest version) The mod does not affect or alter the V13D update/hotfix thing in anyway, shape or form since that did not modify loading screens.\r<br />\r<br />More than triple checked this but hey, who knows, I might of still messed something up. Message me if you find any problems. Also endorse if there were no problems and you liked it :)\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m aware that another loading screen improvement mod for JaySuS Swords exists but it is dead and didn&#39;t remove the &#34;JaySuS Swords&#34; signature from loading screens and that was actually what really bugged me on my Requiem playthrough. \r<br />If you dislike my version or want the signature on your loading screens here is the link for Sparrow&#39;s mod:\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27803/?\r<br />I haven&#39;t tried it though, so I can&#39;t vouch for it&#39;s quality.\r<br />\r<br />I am in no way affiliated with JaySuS and his smexy sword mod.",
