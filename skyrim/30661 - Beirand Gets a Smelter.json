  "summary": "Beirand has finally saved up enough septims to buy himself a smelter.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Beirand\\'s business acumen is astounding. Not only is he the most prominent smith in Solitude, but he also managed to get there without the use of a smelter. Thanks to the Dragonborn\\'s contributions to his burgeoning metal-bending empire, Beirand has finally been able to afford a smelter - and a good thing too, because the Imperial army is about to put in another huge order...\r\n\r\nAs thanks, he has allowed the Dragonborn to use his smelter whenever the Dragonborn should wish. \r\n\r\n[b]SO WHAT?[/b]\r\n\r\nI\\'m just sick of not having a smelter in Solitude. Having to go elsewhere to smelt when I was based in Solitude didn\\'t make any sense to me. Surely a man that is crafting armor for the Empire would have easy access to the ability to smelt the metal he needs? Right?\r\n\r\nSo yeah. All this mod does is add a smelter to Beirand\\'s blacksmith. Pretty simple stuff.\r\n\r\n[b]WHY SHOULD I DOWNLOAD THIS?[/b]\r\n\r\nBecause it would make me happy. And you want to make me happy, don\\'t you?\r\n\r\n[b]HASN\\'T THIS BEEN DONE BEFORE?[/b]\r\n\r\nProbably. I honestly haven\\'t checked.\r\n\r\n[b]SO WHO ARE YOU GONNA THANK FOR THIS?[/b]\r\n\r\nBethesda, for making the game.\r\nThe modding community for re-making Skyrim, and making it better.\r\nMy brain, for getting sick of not having a smelter in Solitude.\r\nYou, for taking the time to read this far.",
