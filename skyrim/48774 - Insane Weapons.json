  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]1Iei8FIIRJo[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod tries to add a bit more of challenge to the combat in Skyrim. This mod makes every weapon in the game deal a one-hit kill. That means every player, follower, NPC, and enemy weapon will kill instantly. \r<br />\r<br />This mod adds an extra challenge to the game, because no longer can you charge right into a fight. You must be aware of your surroundings, stealthy, and even fast with a bow and arrow. Proceed with caution around every corner &#33; Remember that your weapons AND enemy weapons kill instantly, so plan accordingly.\r<br />\r<br />Note that this mod does produce a lot of killcam moves. I recommend the mod  Killmove Control to reduce the amount of killcams or to stop them altogether. That mod can be found at http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13446/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Mod by Randall Herman\r<br />www.RandallHerman.com\r<br />\r<br />",
