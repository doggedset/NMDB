  "descriptionHtml": "[img]https://i.imgur.com/y6rs5KP.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />I've been using Corvalho's Valiant Nord bow for quite a while, it's my fav, simply the most unique and best looking custom bow out there, I think. After finishing my Arctic armor and arrow mod, I soon felt that the bow doesn't match the set well. So, i retextured the bow to Stalhrim style, and also made some changes in creation kit for a more balanced gameplay at high difficulty.\n<br />\n<br />I do not include the Valiant Nord arrow however, just the bow.\n<br />\n<br />You have to complete the quest \"A new source of stalhrim\" and activated \"ebony smithing\" perk to craft this bow, or you can use Additemmenu mod or console to get it right away.\n<br />\n<br />Uploaded with permission from Corvalho\n<br />Shout out and credit toÂ Corvalho who did an awesome job making this beautiful bow.",
