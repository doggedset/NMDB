  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Special Information[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]If you are looking for a fantasy female mod, this isn&#39;t what you want so please move on without commenting. This mod depicts a woman that has literally been through Hell and survived. There are plenty of pretty girl followers to choose from, well posed and smiling. This mod doesn&#39;t give you that. Norine is a more realistic character so she will not appeal to everyone.[/color] \r<br />\r<br />Description\r<br />\r<br />Hired by Siddgeir, the Jarl of Falkreath, to patrol the foothills of Lake Llinalta, Ranger Norine Gludersdottir interrupted a massacre by the Thalmor at a Statue and shrine of Talos. Enraged at the sight she loosed an arrow into the Justiciar giving orders, killing him instantly. The rest of the Thalmor fell upon her, but as the blade plunged toward her, the Sub-Justiciar stayed them. Fearing Elenwen’s wrath, the Sub-Justiciar felt returning with at least one nord prisoner, might mitigate some of her anger. Especially since that fool,  Agent Sanyon, was dead.\r<br /> \r<br />Captured, bound and beaten, Norine Gludersdottir and her captors started for Northwatch Keep. A day into the journey, she managed to slip her bonds and grab a dagger from the belt of the Justiciar. Holding the dagger to the Justiciar’s throat Norine ordered the Thalmor soldiers to drop their weapons. She then smashed the hilt of the dagger into the Justiciar&#39;s head, stunning her, and fled into the forest.\r<br /> \r<br />Crossing the Hjaal River, she struggled through the wetlands of Hjaalmarch and the numerous bandit camps where, if they found her, killing her would be the least they would do. Then, fearing arrest in Morthal, she skirted to the south of the city laboring to reach The Pale. Starving, near death from exposure, she managed to steal a boat from a fisherman on the shore of Lake Yorgrim and, using the last of her strength, enter the current of the Yorgrim River before collapsing. Finally, when all seemed lost, a sailor on the Windhelm docks spotted her floating past. Pulling her to safety, the sailor called for the guard who took Norine to Candlehearth Hall where Elda Early-Dawn nursed her back to health.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Where to find her:\r<br />\r<br />She resides in the Candlehearth Hall in Windhelm.\r<br />\r<br />Installation\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]NMM strongly recommended.[/b][/color]\r<br />There are two versions regular and Nevernude, please choose just one.\r<br />\r<br />This mod contains a number of loose files that need to be added to the meshes and texture folders.
