And then they went and enchanted one of the pieces&#33; Bah, well there goes my hopes of--\r<br />OH WAIT CREATION KIT\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />TO INSTALL:\r<br />Simply place in your Skryim/Data directory, and activate. Voil√†&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />ABOUT:\r<br />A total of 12 crafting recipes, all eight armour pieces can be tempered&#33;\r<br />\r<br />HEAVY SET is equivalent to EBONY (at half weight) and thus requires ebony perk and is found under &#39;ebony&#39;.\r<br />LIGHT SET is equivalent to GLASS (at half weight) and thus requires glass perk and is found under &#39;glass&#39;.\r<br />CLOTH can be crafted immediately using linen (typically found in draugr barrows) and is found under &#39;clothing&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />The head/masks of all sets require, and are tempered with, mammoth tusks (so get hunting&#33;).\r<br />The bodies and gloves, including cloth, of all sets require a single corundum ingot (for the arm decor) but are tempered with their own set material (ebony or malachite).\r<br />Cultists equipment doesn&#39;t change (their robes are still enchanted), though the names of their other equipment may be changed as warranted.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />--&gt;ALL CRAFTABLES ARE UNENCHANTED for your pleasure&#33;\r<br />--&gt;Fixed/added pickup/drop sounds&#33;\r<br />--&gt;Costs are consistent across all types (no spamming easy-mode armour for you).\r<br />--&gt;As original, items do not drop in the world (just the heavy head, light gloves, and cloth boots cultists already spawn with)\r<br />--&gt;All have full keywords for material and slots (meaning mods that provide bonuses, like SkyRe, will recognise them&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Two versions: vanilla (for standard armour ratings) and SkyRe (since SkyRe has increase armour/damage scores for advanced combat).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />All names are &#34;Cultist [...]&#34;.\r<br />CLOTH: Shoes, Gloves, Robe, Hood\r<br />LIGHT: Boots, Bracers, Armor, Mask\r<br />HEAVY: Greaves, Gauntlets, Cuirass, Helm",
