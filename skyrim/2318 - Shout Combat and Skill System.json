  "summary": "This script causes Shouting to slowly raise the Speech skill, and causes the Speech skill to grant a small bonus to Shout recovery time.  It also adds 3 special Shout-related abilities that can be acquired by taking the Bribery, Persuasion, or Intimidation perks.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[u][B]-Description-[/B][/u]\r\nThis script changes the way you\\'ll think about Shouting in combat -- now it\\'s a skill you can hone and focus on.  Shouting increases Speech, and Speech makes Shouts recover faster.  Additionally, those three unimpressive Speech perks, Bribery, Persuasion, and Intimidate, now have a use; they allow you to convert Health, Stamina, and Magicka (respectively) into Shout recovery.\r\n\r\n[u][B]-Detailed Changelist-[/B][/u]\r\n+ Every Shout increments your Speech skill by a small amount (6 * recovery time by default).  The amount is based on the Shout\\'s recovery time; two Shouts with 15 recovery time and one Shout of 30 recovery time increment Speech the same (small) amount.\r\n\r\n+ Speech affects your Shout recovery time -- a high Speech means you recover faster.  Using the default settings, your Shout recovery time reaches the maximum possible bonus of 50% when your Speech reaches 200.  As an example, a Speech of 40 is approximately a 10% recovery time bonus.\r\n\r\n+ If you have the Bribery perk, you can press \\'/\\' to convert Health directly to Shout recovery at a 6:1 ratio.  (The hotkey and the ratio can be configured in the .ini file.)  Until you press \\'/\\' again, while you have extra Health (it won\\'t go below 1) your Shouts will recover immediately.\r\n\r\n+ If you have the Persuasion perk, you can press \\'>\\' to convert Stamina directly to Shout recovery at a 6:1 ratio.\r\n\r\n+ If you have the Intimidation perk, you can press \\'<\\' to convert Magicka directly to Shout recovery at a 6:1 ratio.\r\n\r\nTo change the hotkeys, Speech skill gain rate, maximum shout recovery bonus, speech to shout recovery bonus ratio, or magicka/stamina/health conversion ratio, edit the shoutCombat.ini file.\r\n\r\nTo disable perk requirements for the abilities, set requirePerks=0 in the .ini file.  To disable the abilities entirely, set speechAbilities=0 in the .ini file.\r\n\r\n[u][B]-Disclaimer-[/B][/u]\r\nThis mod may be unbalanced, particularly at higher levels.  Please let me know what your opinions are and I may tweak the default values to be fairer.\r\n\r\n[u][B]-Changelog-[/B][/u]\r\n1.1 - speech skill increase now ignores speech-based skill bonuses when incrementing speech skill\r\nspeech increase rate set from 5 to 6\r\nadded .ini setting for abilities\r\nfixed a bug where you could shout yourself to death with health -> shout conversion when at full HP.\r\n1.0 - original version.\r\n\r\n[u][B]-Requirements-[/B][/u]\r\nRequires Script Dragon, found here: http://alexander.sannybuilder.com/?category=other&altname=skyrim_script_dragon\r\n\r\n[u][B]-Installation-[/B][/u]\r\n1. Install Script Dragon from the above link.\r\n2. Place shoutCombat.asi and shoutCombat.ini into your root Skyrim folder, alongside TESV.exe. Not the Data folder.\r\n\r\n[u][B]-Uninstalling-[/B][/u]\r\nDelete shoutCombat.asi and shoutCombat.ini.\r\n\r\n[u][B]-Credit-[/B][/u]\r\nThanks to Alexander Blade for Script Dragon. ",
