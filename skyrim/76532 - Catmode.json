  "summary": "Makes different khajiit heights.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever seen an khajiit and thoughed: &#34;That isn&#39;t the size a cat should be.&#34;? Than this is the mod for you. Not only will this immersivy the height of khajiits but also their strength. This will make for harder gameplay for beeing a khajiit. But easier in a fight against one. Note: This doesn&#39;t make khajiits look like and act like cats, for khjiits are the next form in evolution for cats. That is a proven fact by me.\r<br />\r<br />This is an simple mod and shouldn&#39;t interfere with any other except other height replacers. You should install this mod over that one and you should be fine.\r<br />\r<br />This is a very small and simple mod, but the first one i made and I&#39;m still finding out all the mechanics of the creation kit. If I enjoy creating more mods I will upload more and eventually bigger ones.",
