  "summary": "This is a request for a replacer for Ysolda. She is available nude or clothed in a variant of Farm Outfit 4 . If you choose nude you will have to equip clothing on her via the console. She can be found wandering around Whiterun or if you married her you already know where she is. I also shortened her by about 4 to 6 inches. ",
