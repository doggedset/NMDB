Whether you need to enchant a sword, create a deadly poison, or just pray to the divines (and some daedric princes), you can do pretty much whatever you want on the Rivermanor Property. It requires all DLC but who doesn&#39;t love dlc :)\r<br />\r<br />This mod completely enhances and improves one of my other mods (Riverhome). I just had to post this as its own mod because it is on a whole new level. Let&#39;s talk features.\r<br />[color=red]\r<br />FEATURES:\r<br />[/color]\r<br />•Blacksmith Station (Workbench, forge, smelter, tanning rack, grindstone, and more)\r<br />•Planters (you can grow ingredients)\r<br />•Mannequins (tons)\r<br />•Display Cases (plenty)\r<br />•A Religious Area (Shrines of the Divines, as well as Boethiah, Mephala, Azura, Nocturnal and Auriel)\r<br />•ALL Crafting Workbenches (yes this includes a staff enchanter)\r<br />•An Absolutely GORGEOUS Alchemy Garden (it talks for itself)\r<br />•Plenty of Safe Storage\r<br />•An Underground Safe Haven (Filled with a study, display room, mannequins, and more)\r<br />•COMPLETELY NAVMESHED\r<br />•More of course (you just have to find out :) )\r<br />\r<br />Coming Soon:\r<br />•Dawnguard Lair Version\r<br />•Werewolf Lair Version\r<br />(Vampire Version is done)\r<br />\r<br />This has been RIGOROUSLY tested for any bugs, errors etc. and I have put a lot of time into making this house the best it can be. Suggestions are always encouraged as well. After all, this wouldn&#39;t even be here without the overwhelming support I got on my previous mod.\r<br />\r<br />Give it a shot. I know you&#39;ll love it.\r<br />",
