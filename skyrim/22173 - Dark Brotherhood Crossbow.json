Just report any bugs or crash or whatever in the comment.\r\n\r\nP.S. Please check the name of the item. It\\\\\\'s supposed to be Listener\\\\\\'s Crossbow not Daedric Crossbow I think i made a mistake on something in CK \r\n\r\nThis is in honor of Deacon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Very AWESOME DB weapons and Armors!
