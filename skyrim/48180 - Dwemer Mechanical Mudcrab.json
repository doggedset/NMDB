I mean, they MUST have experimented more with different kinds of creations, right?\r<br />\r<br />This is a fully custom mesh&#39;d Dwemer-style mechanical mudcrab I created while learning how to model using 3ds Max 2012. It is fully rigged to work with the mudcrab skeleton and will work in-game.\r<br />\r<br />While this will work in-game, it is currently being released with the meshes set as a mudcrab replacer simply for viewing purposes. I intended this to be used as a modder&#39;s resource, but I may or may not make my own mod utilizing this creature sometime in the future.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/ozcNx8X.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />The way the file is set up is a simple drag-and drop installation into your data directory. It is set up to be Nexus Mod Manager and Mod Organizer (I HIGHLY recommend Mod Organizer) compatible.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/ailxJ0q.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Simply delete the files from your Skyrim directory or use Nexus Mod Manager or Mod Organizer to uninstall them.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/2Qp23vm.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />The texture I created for this mod is very low resolution in some areas. I am very new to creating textures and unwrapping UVW&#39;s, so if anyone can do better I welcome them to try&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/uHMISma.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />This was/is intended as a modder&#39;s resource, so anyone is free to use it int their mods, as long as I am given credit. You do not need to ask me first, you I would like it if you&#39;d send me a PM with your mod&#39;s link so I can see what you did with it&#33;",
