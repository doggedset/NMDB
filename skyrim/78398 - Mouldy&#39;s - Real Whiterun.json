  "descriptionHtml": "Ever felt like whiterun just needed more? There are many mods that effect the levels of clutter and foliage in Whiterun but most of them seemed over-cluttered. My mod adds pine trees, plant life, lore friendly extras (like old market stalls, abandoned because of the civil war), extra lighting, and just generally makes Whiterun look more alive. Without adding TOO much. Giving Whiterun a more traditional &#39;medieval fantasy&#39; sort of feel. \r<br />\r<br />[ This mod does not edit the exterior parts of whiterun like the stables, or any of the building interiors, only the outdoor areas within the city walls. ] \r<br />\r<br />[ Note: I&#39;m using the &#39;Alternative Lighting v2&#39; mod in the pictures above. ] \r<br />\r<br />~ Mouldy Catskin",
