It fell into disrepair however when a fearsome beast drove its owners into exile and worse. It is said the beast still dwells nearby, stubbornly holding onto its prize. The Keep is located a little ways east of Rorikstead, just check your map&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s804.photobucket.com/user/Adamant19/media/Descriptionsmaller_zps45b60f1d.jpg.html][img]http://i804.photobucket.com/albums/yy327/Adamant19/Descriptionsmaller_zps45b60f1d.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />Ever wanted a fortified player abode that wasn&#39;t some kind of colossal stronghold? Perhaps with a more casual and friendly atmosphere? Maybe with some guard/follower NPC&#39;s too? Oh, and a lore friendly way of acquiring said player abode? Well you&#39;ve found it&#33; In addition to the aforementioned features you&#39;ll also find that this is an abode that when you purchase it, the very textures themselves change to reflect the restoration work&#33; I&#39;m setting something of a precedent by making the before and after versions of the Keep so dramatic, and I hope you&#39;ll appreciate the time it took to accomplish this feat. \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s804.photobucket.com/user/Adamant19/media/FeaturesSmaller_zpsb1fd93cd.jpg.html][img]http://i804.photobucket.com/albums/yy327/Adamant19/FeaturesSmaller_zpsb1fd93cd.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />1. Every crafting station short of armor bench and smelter. (depending on feedback may include these in the future.)\r<br />\r<br />2. Four companions/guards and a bard. (Will add Stormcloak sympathetic bard in a later version.)\r<br />\r<br />3. Moderate storage including bookcase display.\r<br />\r<br />4. Two weapon racks and one mannequin. (May add additional displays depending on feedback.)\r<br />\r<br />5. NPC&#39;s have a custom colored guard uniform, and there&#39;s a custom colored outfit for the player. \r<br />\r<br />6. You can brace the main gate so it can&#39;t be opened from the outside.\r<br />\r<br />7. Cleaned up Imperial textures. (Consider these textures a modder&#39;s resource. Feel free to use these in your own mods)\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s804.photobucket.com/user/Adamant19/media/InstallationSmaller_zps57eab973.jpg.html][img]http://i804.photobucket.com/albums/yy327/Adamant19/InstallationSmaller_zps57eab973.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />Unpack the zip file with Winrar or a similar compression software then drop the Data folder into your Skyrim Installation. Click yes when the popup asks about merging folders. That&#39;s it&#33; Since the mod is packaged in a neat little BSA, uninstalling the mod requires you only to delete the one .ESP and .BSA file. \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s804.photobucket.com/user/Adamant19/media/FAQSmaller_zpsb652bc98.jpg.html][img]http://i804.photobucket.com/albums/yy327/Adamant19/FAQSmaller_zpsb652bc98.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />Q. The Main gate is locked&#33;\r<br />\r<br />A. The boss outside has the key. \r<br />\r<br />Q. I&#39;ve entered the Keep, now what?\r<br />\r<br />A. There&#39;s a Journal in the Master Bedroom. Read it, and you will see there&#39;s a dark elf mentioned. A dark elf who happens to be around when he&#39;s needed. That&#39;s a wink and a nod that a script has been employed. You won&#39;t find the dark elf at the Bannered Mare until you&#39;ve read the Journal. \r<br />\r<br />Q. I bought the Deed, but the Keep doesn&#39;t look any different&#33;\r<br />\r<br />A. Make sure to actually READ the deed. That&#39;s how the script fires that changes the Keep&#39;s appearance. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Will you give your other mod, Castle Stonespire, similar features in that mod&#39;s next update? \r<br />\r<br />A. Depends on on how much people like what I&#39;ve achieved here. It was a lot of work putting this together and Stonespire&#39;s interior is a good deal larger and more cluttered. ",
