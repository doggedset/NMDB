  "descriptionHtml": "Bob's Armory Clothing: Dream Girl Edition\n<br />\n<br />Originally posted March 4, 2012\n<br />\"due to the conflict of interest created by the Steam Workshop attempting to claim ownership of modders' IP, I must insist that nothing I create ever has the potential of being uploaded there.\"\n<br />\n<br />DO NOT UPLOAD MY ASSETS TO THE STEAM WORKSHOP.\n<br />You will be hit with a DMCA take down.\n<br />\n<br />Version 01a BETA Patch 01c\n<br />\n<br />REQUIREMENTS:\n<br />Dream Girl Body by Petrovich\n<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41443//?\n<br />\n<br />For those interested, I've set up a YouTube page for tutorials. I've had a lot of requests for this, and finally got around to doing it.\n<br />http://youtu.be/lttIDmqkJn4\n<br />\n<br />Description:\n<br />I created the items in this mod to compliment the hats and other items in Bob's Armory: Skyrim.\n<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12060/?\n<br />Bob's Armory: Skyrim is NOT required.\n<br />\n<br />This is also designed to work with Eldgammel Armor for Dream Girl.\n<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/42670//?\n<br />Again, it is NOT required, just highly recommended.\n<br />\n<br />For enchanting, several of the items will need Enchanting Freedom.\n<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8065//?\n<br />It is only required if you plan to enchant all of the items. Same goes for any of the extended clothing/armor mods out there that use non standard slots for placement.\n<br />\n<br />Right now, this mod is in early beta. The male versions have not been done yet, and I still haven't decided whether I am going to do the male clothing on the vanilla body, or one of the custom bodies. Also, there are still a number of other items I haven't done yet, such as landsknecht gloves.\n<br />\n<br />All items in this mod are listed under the Hide category at the forge with the BDG prefix and require only leather and leather strips to make. While it isn't accurate to the materials actually required to create items like this in real life, it keeps it simple for the time being.\n<br />\n<br />The reason this is a separate release from Bob's Armory: Skyrim is due to the scarf tops having the nude body attached. Ergo, this mod requires an adult warning, something Bob's does not.\n<br />\n<br />Included are a variety of colors for each type of clothing.\n<br />Lace Gloves\n<br />Slave Bell Skirt\n<br />Buffcoat\n<br />Thigh Boots\n<br />Sandals\n<br />Stockings\n<br />Scarf\n<br />Pouch\n<br />Ottoman Pants\n<br />Ottoman Boots\n<br />Dancer Top\n<br />Dancer Pants\n<br />Landsknecht Pants\n<br />\n<br />Items can be mixed and matched for a wide variety of appearances.\n<br />\n<br />UPDATES:\n<br />Fixed laced finger gloves rigging. First person versions still don't show up.\n<br />Fixed clipping issue with the _0 dancer top mesh.\n<br />Added the first person meshes I forgot to include with initial release. Thank you, Duen, for bringing this up!\n<br />\n<br />KNOWN ISSUES:\n<br />Proper transparency, Proper shadowing, Proper specular... Pick one. That's what we get.\n<br />I chose to go after transparency. This means that under certain interior lighting conditions, the semi transparent items will look almost black, and in some exteriors will not darken under shadows. It was a choice between good looking see through fabrics, or blocky, choppy, pixelated transparencies.\n<br />\n<br />CREDITS:\n<br />Petrovich - for the Dream Girl body and for the boot and vest meshes, which I altered for this mod\n<br />Mr. Dave - all textures and all other meshes\n<br />Mr. T.\n<br />\n<br />USAGE:\n<br />AS OF 07-14-2018 NONE OF MY ASSETS ARE TO BE USED BY ANYONE FOR ANY PURPOSE.\n<br />If you don't like this change, thank the moderators for siding with plagiarizers and lying thieves on this site.",
