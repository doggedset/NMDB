The cats are 100% resistant to the relevant elements, have a 20% chance to dodge melee strikes and improved health regeneration in combat. The evasion will have a subtle audio and visual confirmation on Feralflame, Feralfrost & Feralfade each time it\\'s triggered. The elemental cloaks and its appearances will dissipate once battle is concluded. \r\n\r\n- Although there is no default sneak animation for cats in Skyrim, all 3 cats should be significantly harder to detect by enemies for as long as the player is sneaking. This is because they have the Stealth (added value of 100), Light Foot and Silence perks from the Sneak Tree. Feralflame, Feralfrost & Feralfade will also appear semi invisible when the player is sneaking. \r\n\r\n[center][color=#0000FF][Size=10][b][u]Usage[/b][/u][/Size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p522/justinliawchiwai/FelineFriendshipInventoryRings.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n- Feralflame, Feralfrost & Feralfade can be summoned / dismissed at any time simply by equipping / unequipping the respective rings. These rings do not occupy any armor slot. Should the cats be blocking the player\\'s path or in their occasional lazy postures, a lesser power is available to \\\"nudge\\\" them into moving. \r\n\r\n[center][color=#0000FF][Size=10][b][u]Location[/b][/u][/Size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p522/justinliawchiwai/FelineFriendshipLocation.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n- The rings and spell tome are stored in a locked treasure chest located behind Faendal\\'s camp (Riverwood\\'s entrance after the Dragonborn\\'s escape from Helgen). Please refer to the above image. \r\n\r\n[center][color=#0000FF][Size=10][b][u]Installation[/b][/u][/Size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][Size=5][b][color=red]Please un-install all previous versions of this mod first![/b][/Size][/center][/color]\r\n\r\n- As per normal via Nexus Mod Manager. \r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nManually Extract/Unzip the following into the DATA folder in Skyrim\\'s directory (Skyrim/Data)\r\n\r\n- Meshes folder\r\n- Textures folder\r\n- Feline Friendship.esp file\r\n\r\nEnsure that \\\"Feline Friendship.esp\\\" is checked and enabled in the DATA options of Skyrim\\'s Launcher. \r\n\r\n[center][color=#0000FF][Size=10][b][u]Troubleshooting[/b][/u][/Size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n- Only Feralflame will be able to display proper swimming animations in deep water while the player is still mounted. Feralfrost and Feralfade can also be mounted in the same situation, but decent animations will only apply IF the player mounts them while already IN deep water. I have spent countless unsuccessful attempts to fix this and it seems to be a mesh conflict that is beyond my ability to resolve. Do not worry as the mount animations are fine for all 3 cats on land or in shallow water. \r\n\r\n- Feralflame, Feralfrost & Feralfade follow you everywhere, even after fast travel or carriage rides just like vanilla followers do. If you lose sight of them, just continue on your way or wait a couple hours because they will eventually catch up. \r\n\r\n- Unless you are zig zagging in between mazes of trees or weirdly shaped formations of rock, the cats will still be able to find you.\r\n\r\n- When all else fails, just dismiss and summon Feralflame, Feralfrost or Feralfade again =)\r\n\r\n- Sometimes the initial mounting animation appears to be at a weird angle. However it will correct itself and synchronize properly almost instantly. This seems to be an issue with all non-horse mounts at the moment. \r\n\r\n- The cats\\' idle animation of front paws sinking into the ground cannot be fixed. This is a vanilla Skyrim issue and as far as I know there isn\\'t an existing solution. \r\n\r\n[center][color=#0000FF][Size=10][b][u]Compatibility[/b][/u][/Size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n- This mod works generally well with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16240]Tiger Mount[/url] by zbenji except for 1 conflict. Skyrim will only acknowledge ONE proper \\\"swimming\\\" animations\\\" for a cat mounted player in deep waters. This is because Feline Friendship and Tiger Mount share the same cat skeleton for the mounts, regardless of mesh file location. The mount with decent deep water \\\"swimming animations\\\" depends on the load order of the relevant mods. However mount travelling on land or shallow waters still work fine with any or all of those mods installed. \r\n\r\n[center][color=#0000FF][Size=10][b][u]Future Plans[/b][/u][/Size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n- None as I have achieved all my objectives for this mod. \r\n\r\n[center][color=#0000FF][Size=10][b][u]Change Log[/b][/u][/Size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n[b][size=5]v 1.6 ( Latest File )[/size]\r\n\r\n- Removed \\\"Feline Friendship\\\" perk and reverted \\\"Twin Souls\\\" perk to it\\'s original vanilla Skyrim value. The player should now be able to summon all 3 cats together regardless of conjuration skill or any perk investment.[/b]\r\n\r\n[color=#747170][i]v1.5\r\n\r\n- Changed the summon / dismiss method so that all 3 cats can be summoned at the same time \r\n( Perk dependent ). Statue requirement removed. \r\n- New lesser power to nudge Feralflame, Feralfrost or Feralfade position / posture if blocking the player\\'s path and they will now ignore all friendly hits.\r\n- Added new perk under the Conjuration tree to increase the summoning limit in order to accommodate the cats. As a result, the default vanilla perk \\\"Twin Souls\\\" in the same tree has been modified to accommodate this change.\r\n- Changed the sneak visual effect of the cats.\r\n\r\nv 1.4\r\n\r\n- Added 3 different types of Feralfade.\r\n- Each cat has a different elemental cloak & related resistance.\r\n\r\nv 1.3\r\n\r\n- Granted Stealth, Light Foot and Silence perks to Feralfade. \r\n- Cat will now have a ghost-like appearance when the player is sneaking. \r\n- Reduced the health regeneration rate in combat as it was over-powered before. \r\n- Slightly changed the evasion trigger visual effect.\r\n\r\nv 1.2\r\n\r\n- Mount implemented.\r\n- Changed Feralfade\\'s default appearance to that of a more natural looking grey spotted leopard. Please download the optional file to revert the cat\\'s model back to the previous shadowy panther. \r\n- Combined the summon/dismiss ability to a singular lesser power through a script. Now both functions only require one favourites hot key to activate. \r\n- Upon entering combat, the cat will be cloaked with shadowy black magic that provides the cat with a couple of combat abilities. Take note that the slight change in appearance is less apparent in the optional file due to it\\'s similar physical features.\r\n\r\nv 1.1\r\n\r\n- Reduced the cat\\'s damage slightly for balance. \r\n- Feralfade is now summon-able and dismiss-able as two separate powers to avoid de-summoning the cat by accidentally pressing the same favourites hot key. \r\n- Changed the container type through which the player attains the cat to be more obvious. \r\n- Please revert back to version 1.0 if you do not fancy the above stated changes.\r\n\r\nv 1 - Initial Release.[/i][/color]\r\n\r\n[center][color=#0000FF][Size=10][b][u]Contributors[/b][/u][/Size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\nI give my Thanks & Credits to the following mod authors who had given me permission to use some of the resources from their mods.
