  "descriptionHtml": "Hello, Chaos here. I bring you Farkas, cleaned up and looking foxy. \r\nNOW WITH OTHER HAIR STYLES (so shut up already). >:(\r\n\r\nFirst of all: THE HAIR IS NOT MY MOD. This is another mod called ApachiiSkyHair. Comments about the hair style should be directed towards her page. \r\n\r\nThe cheif feature of my mod is to fix Farkas\\' default ugly nose, short lip, wide set and deep set eyes, to something more handsome. ( I also temporarily removed his beard). I will be adding screenshots without the ApachiiSkyHair mod and without the Farkas and Vilkas Cleaned and Painted mod just to take the focus away from THEIR mods and more towards mine (since some people can\\'t seem to be bothered to read the description).\r\n\r\nIn other news:\r\n\r\nI might make another .esp for Farkas with his beard. He looks good either way, but I opted for no beard as of now because no beard allows the High Res Face Maps for Men by Geonox to work. His default beard is not high res, and theres no fix for that yet.\r\n\r\nAlso, being brothers, Farkas and Vilkas are supposed to look alike. I might eventually make a .esp for Vilkas as well, giving him similar features and a different hair/beard style.\r\n\r\nThe Screen shots were taken on ultra high graphics. I used NPC editor and the Creation Kit to make this mod.\r\n\r\nThe other mods you will need to make him look exactly like this are not required, but I recommend them:\r\n\r\nFarkas and Vilkas Cleaned and Painted -- ADDS THE HIGH RES FACE PAINT. IF YOU DON\\'T LIKE IT, DON\\'T GET IT! (default facepaint is smeared and fainter, and in my opinion, it looks less like face paint and more like dirt, or like he really needs to sleep)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2833\r\n\r\nHigh Res Face Maps for Men by Geonox -- ADDS THE STUBBLE FOR THE NO-BEARD FACE. (this is why I removed his beard. I may make another version adding the beard back on. hopefully Geonox will soon come out with a high-res beard option.)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4141\r\n\r\nThis mod is required if you want Farkas to have THE SWEPT-STYLE HAIR IN THE PHOTOS (I highly approve of this mod):\r\n\r\nApachiiSkyHair -- ADDS THE SIDESWEPT HAIR-STYLE AS SEEN IN THE SCREENIES. (THIS IS NOT MY MOD!! Stop asking about it! If you don\\'t like how this style of hair looks on Foxy Farkas, then don\\'t download ApachiiSkyHair or my Foxy Farkas + ApachiiSkyHair version!)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n1. Download Foxy Farkas with whatever hairstyle you like. I uploaded multiply styles because of the complaints about ApachiiSkyHair, even though honestly changing the hair style to whatever you want is the easiest thing in the world (just use construction kit).\r\n\r\n2. Just extract the .7z file, then cut/paste the \\\".esp\\\" file and the \\\"meshes\\\" folder into your \\\"skyrim/data\\\" folder. Overwrite if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease tell me if there are any issues with the mod. I recommend installing manually. Don\\'t know if it is NMM compatible.\r\n\r\nP.S. Thanks to the few people out there who are intelligent enough to take the time to read the description before taking the time to comment. :) You guys are awesome. <3\r\n",
