  "descriptionHtml": "Vycktara Wickhart - Female Breton Mage\r\n\r\nThis is a simple mod that adds a merchant to the College of Winterhold. She can be found in the Hall of Countenance on the first floor.\r\nShe has a decent inventory of soulgems, as well as a selection of potions, some low level spell tomes, maybe a weapon or two.\r\n\r\nI wanted this mod to be vanilla friendly, as in she does not have a ton of money/inventory/power\r\n\r\nShe can also be a follower. She is a frost mage that levels with the PC (100%) up to level 255 and has the following inventory/spells/perks:\r\n\r\nInventory:\r\nDefault Outfit is the College Adept Destruction Outfit (no hood)\r\nIron Dagger enchanted with frost damage (weak)\r\nStaff of Ice Spike\r\n\r\nSpells:\r\nFrostbite\r\nIcespike\r\nStoneflesh\r\n\r\nPerks:\r\nNovice Destruction\r\nApprentice Destruction\r\nAugmented Frost 1&2 \r\nDeep Freeze\r\nDestruction Dual Casting\r\nImpact\r\nNovice Restoration\r\nRecovery 1&2 (for mana regen)\r\n\r\nShe is essential, so she will not die. She should be marriageable (untested)\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nnone - UNP Skinny & Coverwomen look 4 is what I use in game, so that\\'s what is reflected in the screenshots, but it is not required. Second screenshot is Void Armor by Hentai (not included).\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod that I made with the CK and polished with NPC Editor. \r\n\r\nPlease tell me what you think, as I am new to modding (finally, I can say that), and any/all feedback is appreciated.\r\n\r\nFuture plans:\r\nRadiant quest when I get to that tutorial :)\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to jet4571 for some detailed support and overall good advice.\r\nSpecial thanks to foretrenty for the NPC Editor, without which all our new NPCs would be riddled with bugs.",
