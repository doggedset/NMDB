I am not prepared to waste my time trying to help you out with your illegal software! I\\'m unemployed, but still manage to pay for my games (they are what keep me sane) so if I can, you should be able to as well![/color]\r\n\r\nSoulMasterII\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/sm0g9rv24znf_zps9d795d9a.gif[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000]Version History:\r\nV1.0 Initial upload\r\nV1.1 Re-textured SoulMaster\\'s Blade of Woe[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00]Please, DO NOT upload any part of my mods anywhere else![/color]",
