  "descriptionHtml": "\"Soon enough, my sweet Lucilla, you will be with me again. Normally when such words are written it is because the love left behind is soon to depart, but in my case, I hope to soon bring your spirit back into my world, for it was you who loved this world so much, not I....\r\n\r\nThe day draws near. Soon I will hold you. And I will show you this and it will be as delivering a long-forgotten letter to a weary traveler.\"\r\n\r\n                                                                                         -Butcher Journal, Calixto Corrium\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a spell which summons Calixto's beloved sister: Lucilla Corrium.\r\nShe's an Imperial mage specializing in destruction, alteration and restoration spells.\r\nThe spell book can be found on Calixto's House of Curiousities on Windhelm\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm planning on making a quest about her and expect updates later.
