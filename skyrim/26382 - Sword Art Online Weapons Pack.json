  "descriptionHtml": "About SAO armors...\r\nI\\'ve been asked repeatedly about doing armors/clothing to go with these weapons.  I\\'m a decent 3D modeler and with good references I can model most things that are non organic.  But modeling something thats worn by a game character requires a skill set I\\'m not terribly good at.  Worn items must be rigged (bound) to the character\\'s skeleton so they move with the character\\'s momements...I\\'m not good at rigging at all honestly. Simply put I don\\'t have the neccesary skill set to make armor or clothing so I won\\'t be making any armor or clothing. \r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\nVersion 2.0 Uploaded 11/10/2012\r\nMerges all six loose plugin files into one plugin.\r\nRemoves the duplicate sword at the forge.\r\nIncreases the number of daggers created at the forge from one to two.\r\nThanks to David Brasher for talking me through merging the plugin files into one plugin. \r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 Uploaded 11/4/2012\r\nFixes the issue with the sword and dagger scabbards being solid black.\r\nA special thanks goes to ghosu for helping me resolve this issue, check out his mods!\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nThis pack adds six new craftable weapons under the ebony smithing perk, they can be upgraded and enchanted and are slightly more powerful than ebony weapons but not so much as to be overpowering in game.  These weapons do not replace any of Skyrim\\'s existing weapons.  This is my first mod uploaded to the Nexus so bear with me.\r\n\r\nIncluded weapons:\r\nDagger\r\nSword\r\nGreatsword\r\nBattle Ave\r\nWar Axe\r\nMace\r\n(A War Hammer may be coming in a future update.)\r\n\r\n[youtube]q1JKJ8ZeDMc[/youtube]\r\n\r\n********************************************************************\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nDownload and install using the Mod Manager.\r\n\r\nTo manually install:\r\nExtract the zip file, place the .esp files, the Meshes and Textures folders into your Skyrim Data Folder, if promted merge, nothing will be over written unless you\\'re updating from a previous version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrading to a newer version:\r\nUninstall the previous version with the Nexus Mod Manager.\r\nDownload and install the newer version.\r\nPlay Skyrim and kill stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nManually updating:\r\nExtract the zip file, place the .esp files, the Meshes and Textures folders into your Skyrim Data Folder, if promted merge, and over write the files and folders of the previous version.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you previously had the 1.0 or 1.1 version installed you may lose the items you created at the forge, to replace them:\r\n\r\n1. Press the ~ key to open the consol commands, type in Help SAO.   You should see a list of the Dovah weapons and their PRID numbers.\r\n2. Select the item you want to add and type    player.additem <ITEM NUMBER HERE> <NUMBER TO GIVE HERE>\r\n\r\nFor example you would type in something like:\r\n\r\nplayer.additem 2c00182a 1\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Press Enter on your keyboard and you should get a confirmation message that the item was added.\r\n\r\n4. Repeat for each of the weapons you want to add to your inventory, replacing the item number to match each weapons specific ID number. \r\n\r\n********************************************************************\r\n\r\nMeshes and textures created by me in 3DS Max and Photoshop.\r\nIf you wish to modify my weapons or use them in some way please contact me first.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to...\r\nGhosu - for his weapons tutorials, thank you for helping others learn.\r\n\r\nYoutube user officerbeardontcare for his NifSkope tutorial videos.\r\n\r\nBethesda - Skyrim and it\\'s assets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
