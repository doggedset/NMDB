  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Verdana][size=5][color=red]ENBs can be very taxing, especially on weaker set-ups. This mod aims to bring the colour vibrancy of ENBs to such set-ups without compromising FPS or performance, by using a different approach.[/color][/size][/font]\r\n\r\n[URL=http://www.makeagif.com/s9AClx][IMG]http://makeagif.com/media/5-13-2013/s9AClx.gif[/IMG][/URL]\r\n[size=4]This GIF image was made using [url=http://makeagif.com/]MakeAGIF.com[/url].[/size]\r\n\r\n[font=Impact][size=5][color=orange]Description[/color][/size][/font]\r\n[size=4]This mod uses Image Space Modifiers to bring the vibrancy of ENBs to Skyrim without affecting FPS or performance. Effects such as Bloom, Saturation, Blur, Brightness, and Contrast can be edited through Image Space Modifiers. Naturally, some effects such as glow are not possible through this approach.\r\n\r\nThe mod includes 6 different effects. The mod adds 6 rings to the game, each with an enchantment that, when worn, applies a particular image space to the player. The rings can be found in the Riverwood Trader, and can be disenchanted. There is one thing to note. I suggest that you never save when you have one of the rings equipped. This is not because it will wreck your save game. Rather, it is because, if you decide you no longer want to have my mod activated, you may cause the effect to remain indefinitely. Though I haven\\'t tested this, I would imagine that such a consequence would be rather unpleasant.[/size]\r\n\r\n[font=Impact][size=5][color=orange]Update 1.1[/color][/size][/font]\r\n[size=4]Full-screen blur was completely removed after I realized that it was completely ridiculous. Thank you to those who pointed that out. Depth of field was added.[/size]\r\n\r\n[font=Impact][size=5][color=orange]Update 1.2[/color][/size][/font]\r\n[size=4]I began using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12525/?][i]DYNAVISION[/i][/url], so I removed the depth of field. I highly recommend checking this mod out if you have not yet done so.[/size]\r\n\r\n[font=Impact][size=5][color=orange]Additional Notes[/color][/size][/font]\r\n[size=4]I had previously hidden this file because it was noted that similar functions can be achieved in other mods such as [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13049//?][i]IMAGINATOR[/i][/url], which I recommend that you check out if you are not yet aware of it. After much reflection, I have decided to make it public again. To any of the previous downloaders: I have tweaked the settings so that they actually look nice, since, when I first uploaded the mod, I had a very poor grasp of how to manipulate Image Space Modifiers. If anything, I encourage you to think of this mod as 6 presets that might interest you, and can be tweaked using mods such as [i]IMAGINATOR[/i].[/size]\r\n\r\n[font=Impact][size=5][color=orange]Installation[/color][/size][/font]\r\n[size=4]You can use the NMM, or install manually by extracting the .rar file and placing the .esp file in your \\\"Data\\\" folder.\r\n\r\nHave fun![/size]",
