After hours and hours of trying to find the source, I created this batch file. Your mileage may vary, but it worked for me when nothing else did. The contents of this batch file contains reference to music in any mods I had installed at the time of creation. You may have different mods, so if it doesn&#39;t work, see the FAQ to learn how to creat your own.\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][b]This mod is a Nexus Exclusive and is Forever Free. You may NOT upload this file to anywhere else and you may not charge for it in any way.[/b][/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Simply copy the file &#39;stopmusic&#39; to your Skyrim root folder (NOT Data), then when in-game open the console (Usually ~) and type &#39;bat stopmusic&#39;. If everything goes well, the loop should stop\r<br />[b]\r<br />Uninstallation:[/b]\r<br />Remove &#39;stopmusic&#39; from Skyrim&#39;s root folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Change Log:[/b]\r<br />v1.0 - Initial creation\r<br />\r<br />[b]Future Updates:[/b]\r<br />None planned\r<br />[b]\r<br />Known Issues:[/b]\r<br />None\r<br />[b]\r<br />Faqs:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />If for some reason, this doesn&#39;t stop the music, you can create your own batch file that will.\r<br />\r<br />Follow these steps:\r<br />\r<br />1. Download ConSkrybe by shadeMe at this location: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19630/?\r<br />\r<br />2. Install ConSkrybe as per the authors&#39; instructions.\r<br />\r<br />3. While in-game, open the console (Usually ~) and type: &#39;help mus&#39; followed by &#39;ToggleSkrybing&#34; to close the file.\r<br />\r<br />4. Exit Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />5. Open the ConSkrybe.log file with your favorite text editor and find lines that begin with &#34;MUSC:&#34;\r<br />\r<br />6. Copy all of the lines that begin with MUSC: to a new text file and use search and replace to replace &#34;MUSC:&#34; with &#34;RemoveMusic&#34;. Make sure there is a space between RemoveMusic and the name of the category.\r<br />\r<br />7. Next you&#39;ll have to remove everything after the category name.\r<br />\r<br />8. Save the file and place it in the Skyrim root folder, then run it just like you did with mine.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s what a line looks like before editing:\r<br />\r<br />MUSC: MUSCombat (0003418E) &#39;&#39;\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s a line after editing:\r<br />\r<br />RemoveMusic MUSCombat\r<br />\r<br />That&#39;s it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Developers:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Thanks To:shadeMe for his wonderful SKSE Plugin, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19630/?]ConSkrybe[/url].\r<br />\r<br />The Nexus for being a steady beacon for Skyrim modding since the beginning.\r<br />\r<br />My wife for putting up with my weird hobby of &#34;breaking Skyrim&#34; as she calls my efforts at modding.",
