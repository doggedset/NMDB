  "summary": "A fix for the Dragonborn Flame fire wyrms, makes them behave as expected... and ACTUALLY USEFUL.",
  "descriptionHtml": "If you&#39;ve ever used the Dragonborn Flame power (DB), then you&#39;ll know that fire wyrms are... well, pretty awful.  Most of the time they do nothing and you can&#39;t use them in public because they attack neutral NPCs... something which guards aren&#39;t all that crazy about and which may result in your followers protecting the wyrms from the guards ([i]IF[/i] the wyrms aren&#39;t already attacking your followers... *sigh*).\r<br />\r<br />Thanks uncle Hermaeus, they&#39;re just what I&#39;ve always wanted...&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Anyway, this mod fixes their behaviour.  It&#39;s nothing much, just a few tweaks I made when I couldn&#39;t find an existing mod, but they make a huge difference: Fire Wyrms will only attack hostiles and will actively seek them out instead of... not.  If there&#39;s nothing to attack, they&#39;ll wander a short distance rather staying in one place (which I thought made them look bugged).  There will still be pathing issues on stepped or steep terrain, but this is something inherent to the creature type (they&#39;re essentially retextured Ice Wraiths).\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=2]\r<br />[b]Short version: Fire Wyrms will be useful and actually [i]attack[/i] enemies...
