  "descriptionHtml": "This mod brings Umbra (arguably the coolest sword in The Elder Scrolls) into the world of Skyrim. 200 years after the Oblivion crisis where did Umbra go? A powerful artifact like that doesnt just disappear. Well it didnt a wandering traveler found it buried beneath the snows of Skyrim and was easily corrupted by the weapon. Can you beat her and claim the sword as your own? Or will you go down as another victim to the swords unquenchable hunger for souls.\r\n\r\nCheck out the readme tab for more info.\r\nThanks to DigitalLion for the superb meshes and textures and the permission to use his resources",
