It is a spell named unlock2 besed in unlock spell by willkydd\r\n(http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11293) and telekinetic push by  Ichibu \r\n(http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9167). \r\nI wrote both authors telling them I was workings on this but received no response, So i decide to put them  a co-authors of the mod\r\n \r\nUse help \\\"unlock2\\\" and player.addspell to get the spell\r\n\r\nIt is a concentration spell thad :\r\n-unlocks aimed to any locked container depending on the levevel of you alteration level (as willkydd mod).\r\n- reduce the speed of the player by a half\r\n -if player is not moving:  pushes the target upwards to the sky\r\n-if the player is moving; it will move e the target in the direction the played is moving (pushing the enemy while advancing, pulling while moving back...)\r\n- if the player is running : you will push strongly your target  making dragons feeling the force\r\n-if the spell is dual wildered (not dual casting needed); the force applied will be tripled.\r\n\r\n\r\nby the moment it only can move NPC\\'s though this is planed to be a generic telekinetic spell in future releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompatibility:\r\n I have tested the mod with may oters and only found problems with  Battle fatigue and injuries by kuertee when you get your leg injured ; in this circunstance you can\\'t move but using the spell on a NPC an jumping restores oyur movility (forcing speedmult to 100 has teh same effect)\r\n\r\nby the moment the telekinetic push and unlock\r\n mods in with my mos is vades are not compatible. however, the unlock mod will still work unless you update it further than version 1.2 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfuture:\r\n-adding video \r\n- make the mod independent.\r\n-adding book\r\n-adding special trainer an quest\r\n-adding enemies that use a similar spell\r\n",
