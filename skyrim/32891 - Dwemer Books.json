  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever wondered why there are no dwemer books in the dwemer ruins? The Dwemer were a mighty and powerful race, they created mighty city states and magnificent automatons, which still work. But how is it possible, that there are basically no dwemer books at all in whole Skyrim?\r\n\r\nSo I decided to create couple of dwemer books, written in dwemeris, and distributed them in dwemer ruins. Since the dwemer disappeared a long ago, only a few books are in readable condition.\r\n\r\nThe books are simply books to add more immersion to the world. No spelltomes, no skillbooks (maybe later). If you want, you can try and translate them :)\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nSimply put in yout /skyrim/Data folder. Remove for uninstallation.",
