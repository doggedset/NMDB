  "descriptionHtml": "This is being built as a personal challenge after reading a request by SageRaintree\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\nI want a family estate, one that has seen a happy loving family. One that grew and changed with the family through many generations. A house I inherit. Second floor, bedrooms for young and old.\r\nFirst floor, kitchen, dining room, library, sitting room and a show room for all the family\\'s trophies. A basement for all crafting, including smelter and wood chopping. Greatgranddad was interested in crafting weapons and armor, one side of the basement was his man cave. Greatgrandma was into alchemy and enchanting, after all she had children to look after and keep well. She was in charge of the other side of the basement. Oh and if you want there could be a skeleton in a closet or two. Of course storage is important also.\r\n-------------------",
