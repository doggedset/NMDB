  "descriptionHtml": "[url=https://twitter.com/PrvtIPrivateEye][img]http://i.imgur.com/jn5Gp4X.png[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/zEzaLex.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/V718y.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=1][i]One of Valenwood\\'s legendary heroes is Oreyn Bearclaw. Son of King Faume Toad-Eye, he was a respected clan hunter and a future leader. Wood Elven legend claims Oreyn single handedly defeated Glenhwyfaunva, the witch-serpent of the Elven wood, forever bringing peace to his clan. Oreyn would go on to accomplish numerous other deeds, eventually losing his life to the Knahaten Flu. His Helm stood as a monument of his stature for future generations to remember. The Helm was lost eventually, as the Clan split, and is now a treasured artifact for adventurers. The Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw is rumored to improve the wearers agility and endurance.[/i][/size]\r\n- Tamrielic Lore\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/lzYTt.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nOreyn Bearclaw was a legendary hero of Valenwood. His powerful Helm was seen in Morrowind and Oblivion and now makes it’s return!\r\n\r\nThe design is based on the Morrowind version of the Helm because I greatly prefer this one to the Oblivion version. I remade the mesh and texture from scratch, using the Morrowind helm as blueprint. The model came out looking very similar to the original, as was my intention.\r\n\r\nIn previous games the Helm gave a boost to strength and endurance attributes. Since attributes don’t exist anymore, I’ve chosen for an upgrade in stamina and carry capacity. To be exact, the helm will grant:\r\n- A 40 pts stamina boost\r\n- An increased stamina regen by 20%\r\n- An increased carry capacity by 15 pts\r\n\r\nIn stats the helm is a bit better than the Daedric Helmet, so nothing overpowered. It’s also usable by all races and genders!\r\nThe helm can be tempered using a Moonstone Ingot and some Bonemeal.\r\n\r\nIf you want a enchantable / light armor version of the Helm, you can find it [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30257/]here[/url]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/dOm6C.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s not really a quest involved in getting the Helm, but it’s not just handed over to you either. In Morrowind, legendary items were usually scattered throughout the world. They could be obtained by the player at any time (if you knew where to look), though they were usually heavily guarded. I want to return a bit of that feeling to Skyrim.\r\nThe helm is “laying around”  somewhere in Skyrim and you’ll have to look (and probably fight) for it. Lucky for you, there are some clues.\r\n\r\nStart in Windhelm at Sadri\\'s Used Wares. Revyn Sadri has been receiving a number of personal letters from an old friend. There are 4 letters in total. Read them carefully to find out where to go. Not all letters may be in plain sight!\r\n\r\nI really, really like storytelling so I wrote 4 pretty long letters. I recommend you read them, cause I did my best to create a compelling background for this otherwise very small mod. IMO, this fleshes the mod out a bit and makes the search a bit more interesting. But if you are one of those TL;DR people, you don’t HAVE to read them all:\r\n\r\n[spoiler]the only letter you need to read is the 4th! That letter contains the location where you can find the Helm.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/5hrEO.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nUsually I don’t have a problem with people using my meshes/textures, etc. as resource for their own mods. I do have 2 conditions:\r\n- You notify me by mail that you want to use the mod. You don’t really need to ask for my permission, I just want to know when and where my work gets use.\r\n- You credit me as author of my assets in your mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Q0gXX.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nI recommend using NMM to install the mod for you. It’s the easiest way.\r\n\r\nTo manually install, just drop the data folder from the archive into your main Skyrim directory. For most (Steam) players this will be at:\r\n(Drive letter:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/GPzsi.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod should work with pretty much every other mod out there. Let me know if you think you’ve found a compatibility issue with another mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/pkBdI.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nV 1.0\r\nInitial release\r\n\r\nV 1.1\r\n- Helm for Argonian Females optimized a bit. Not perfect, but best I can do at the moment (due to technical dificulties).\r\n- You can no longer disenchant the helm.\r\n\r\nV 1.2\r\n- .esp cleaned with Tes5Edit\r\n\r\n[youtube]CFeHwBwIGXE[/youtube] [youtube]tKYuNL_X25A[/youtube]\r\n[youtube]g7tOEokdvM0[/youtube] [youtube]RPVK0m9aVH8[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/tv9bA.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease also have a look at some of my other mods:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17534]Sixth House Bell Hammer[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17096]Chrysamere[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16637 ]Ashland Amulets[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15579]BiPolar Blade[/url]\r\n\r\nFor more, check [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=887024]my profile[/url]\r\n\r\nAlso follow me on [size=3][url=https://twitter.com/PrvtIPrivateEye ]Twitter[/url][/size] if you want to stay up to date on my modding plans!",
