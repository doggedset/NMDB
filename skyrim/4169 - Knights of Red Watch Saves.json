  "descriptionHtml": "V1.1 released: Added optional Tyra the Scoundrel file, includes both unsided and pre-sided saves. Meant to replace Tyra the Liar, as I was not happy with the way she looked.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nI got bored and decided to create some characters. Then I thought I might as well share them in case anybody wanted to use them.\r\n\r\nThis file contains two folders, one containing the saves just before you side with Ralof or Hadvar, and the other containing pre-sided characters, as I imagined them. The pre-sided characters also come with short back stories.\r\n\r\nKnights of Red Watch-Backstory contains the pre-sided characters and back stories, but they are still undeveloped and can be played as you want.\r\n\r\nKnights of Red Watch-No Backstory contains the unsided characters and no back story, so you can imagine them as you want.\r\n\r\nNo character mods used, though after installing Xenius\\' Character Enhancement I liked the new look as well (Though I personally do not use the scar enhancement).\r\nhttp://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356\r\n\r\nFirst time doing anything like this, any constructive criticism or feedback is encouraged.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n----------\r\nMe- For creating the characters and uploading the files.\r\nXenius- For his outstanding mod.\r\nBethesda- For Skyrim.\r\n\r\nMy Other Mods\r\n----------------------\r\nFork of Horripilation Quest- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17187\r\nInns and Guilds Have More Visitors- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8340\r\nSoul Food- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18951/",
