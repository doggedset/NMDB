Personally, I don\\'t use the Hotkey-List, but I left it enabled because it is in the original configuration. You can easily edit the configuration, just take a look at it.\r\n\r\nAll credit for the original mods goes to the original authors: favmenumodder and headbomb\r\nYou guys are awesome!\r\n\r\nOld version info:\r\nIn v1.0 I swapped the order of lists for compability reasons, apparel and weapons now come before potions and spells. Since v1.1 the order of lists is no longer swapped.\r\n",
