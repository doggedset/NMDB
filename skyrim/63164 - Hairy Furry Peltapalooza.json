[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60412/?]PELTAPALOOZA[/url] fixed the second. \r<br />And now you can use them together&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/jmQDZxv.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This patch allows the two mods to work together by puttin[size=2]g the textures made b[/size]y Gamwich onto the edited furry meshes supplied by SparrowPrince.\r<br />\r<br />I have created two versions with two different styles in mind. \r<br />\r<br />The ROUGH version has furs the same size as the original Hairy Furry Pelts mod. This makes them more visible when stepping in them and seeing objects sitting in them, but can come with some visual oddness from a distance seeing the different layers of the fur from the mesh.\r<br />\r<br />The FINE version has furs twice as thin as the original mod, and much more compact. This makes the pelts look softer and finer, but with the trade off of having a harder edge on the mesh, and it not being as noticeable when running through them. \r<br />\r<br />[i][b]Comparisons of both versions can be found in the images section above.[/b][/i]\r<br />\r<br />There is also FLOOR ONLY versions of both the Rough and Fine types, which only enable the furs for floor, which can help to save on VRAM and memory usage. If using this version, do not install Hairy Furry Pelts as it will give its version of furs to the wall pelts. This version is compatable with the 6 pelt version of Peltapalooza for those wanting to save some additional memory space.\r<br />[color=#f6b26b]\r<br />[size=2][b]A performance update has been released&#33;[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />While this doesn&#39;t affect texture size, it turns off the shadows for the furry parts of the mesh which were hardly noticeable anyway and as a result lightens the rendering load as theres a lot less finer shadow detail for the game to try and render out all the time. \r<br />I run a fairly mod heavy load and after creating this patch I jumped 10fps in indoor areas. Please report back if this has helped you, especially anyone running this with an ENB or higher quality shadows.\r<br />When I originally created this patch, I didn&#39;t even think about the shadows, and didn&#39;t factor that into my original performance assessment so my apologies for that. I wasn&#39;t actually aware that the furry part of the mesh had the &#39;cast shadows&#39; flag on it which was taking up so much performance and rendering calculations. This flag has now been removed from the furry mesh but NOT the base mesh. This means that shadows will still be cast by the actual pelt itself just like in the base game, without the furry shadows which are mostly unnoticeable, taking up additional resources, and as a result there is NO visual quality lost compared to the base game.\r<br />\r<br />[u]A note about memory and performance with the textures:[/u]\r<br />In order to save VRAM and memory space with Peltapalooza, Gamwich edited the UVs (the part of the mesh that controls how a texture gets laid onto it) so that the floor pelts were a square 2048x2048 texture, instead of the original dimensions of 2048x4096. \r<br />The edited furry meshes from Hairy Furry Pelts did not have this edited UV, and I tried for several hours to get the two sets of UVs to line up nicely without success, always suffering some distortion in one pelt or another. Because of this, unfortunately, the original work done by Gamwich to save some memory had to be undone and I had to go back to the original texture proportions. \r<br />This means you should expect some increased memory usage compared to the original Peltapalooza mod, especially as there is now two sets of high quality textures for every pelt, as the 3d furs also requires another texture to be applied. To try and combat this, the fur texture for the floor pelts is half the size of the original.\r<br />\r<br />While pelts only appear indoors and as such memory usage should be minimal, if you are struggling with the increased memory, and do not wish to downgrade to the floor only version, or are already using it, I highly recommend resizing your textures using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12801/?]Optimizer Textures[/url] or another editing program such as photoshop or gimp.\r<br />This will allow you to half the size of the original textures if you would like, but please expect less quality because of it. Because of the new 3d furs, the quality downgrade will be less noticeable though. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/qZwYSQd.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f6b26b][size=3]Installation Instructions[/size][/color]\r<br />[list=1][*][size=2]Download [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13268/]Hairy Furry Pelts[/url][/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Download [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60412/?]PELTAPALOOZA[/url] - Full Version (if you have the LITE version you must use the floor only version of this patch)[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Install PELTAPALOOZA[/size][size=2][/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Download ONE main file from this patch page[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Install it AFTER both other mods (If using MO, it must have a lower priority in the left pane then the previous two mods)[/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[size=2]Please note : While this patch overrides all files from Hairy Furry Pelts and technically that makes it unneeded to run this patch, and it does not need to be installed, I will not provide support to people who have not supported it first.
