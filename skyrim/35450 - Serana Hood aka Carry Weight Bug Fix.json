  "modName": "Serana Hood aka Carry Weight Bug Fix",
  "summary": "Serana adds another hood to her inventory every time she puts it on, eventually ending up with maxed out carry weight",
  "descriptionHtml": "You know that bug where Serana\\'s inventory is mysteriously empty but she can\\'t carry anything else?  Well, it\\'s because she is carrying a ****load of hoods.\r\nThe problem is really with the script which I cannot fix, but I can make the hood weightless.\r\nThis has not been fixed by the Unofficial Dawnguard Patch (yet) so if you have Serana as a follower for a long time; you probably will want this.\r\nJust put the file in the skyrim Data folder and make sure it is enabled on the load order; that\\'s it!\r\nRequires Dawnguard DLC.\r\nCompatible with everything that doesn\\'t edit Serana\\'s hood.",
