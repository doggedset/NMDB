  "descriptionHtml": "I really like the Ebony Armor set but something always bothered me. When i got the Ebony Mail i knew it were these huge shoulder pads. But i disliked the effects from the Mail.\r\nSo i made the Ebony Cuirass!\r\nIt´s an unenchanted version of the Ebony Mail, which is craftable and can be tempered with the Ebony Smithing perk.\r\nBecause of the missing shoulder pads it has slightly less armor rate, weight and value. It also needs one Ebony Ingot less than the Ebony Armor. It is \r\n\r\nArmor: armor rate 43, weight 38, value 1500 Recept  5 Ebony Ingots 3 Leather Strips\r\nCuirass: armor rate 41, weight 35, value 1250 Recept  4 Ebony Ingots 3 Leather Strips\r\n\r\nIt is the original mesh and texture from Bethesda, so it should work on any race and both sexes, and shouldn´t conflict with other mods.\r\n\r\nHope you like it!",
