Ever wish you could just wave your hands and have a Draugr appear? Well wish no more, because Undead Summoning will make it all happen. This mod brings back the good old undead summoning we knew from previous ES games. \r<br />\r<br />You can now summon the following undead beasties: Skeletons, Corrupted Shades, Draugr, Draugr Lords, and Dragon Priests. Skeletons now come in many varieties, from the ordinary entry level Skellie, to the Skeleton Archer, Skeleton Guardian, Skeleton Hero, and Skeleton Champion. \r<br />\r<br />Spell Tomes for each can be bought from Ereshikagal, a magician who can be found in the Bannered Mare inn of Whiterun. \r<br />\r<br />Perk Notes: The Summoner, Necromancy and Twin Souls perks work with Undead Summoning. However, I cannot get the Dark Souls perk to work with the undead you can summon. I believe this is due to the differences in the game engine between summoning and reanimating. So that you do not have to take the Dark Souls perk just to get to Twin Souls, I have created a second perk called Twin Summons that does the same thing, requiring only Necromancy, and of course a Conjuration skill of 100. \r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Simply copy the Undead Summoning.esp file to your Skyrim&#92;data folder. When you start Skyrim, select the Undead Summoning mod. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version History:\r<br />1.6\r<br />Added a summonable Draugr archer.\r<br />\r<br />1.5\r<br />Fixed an issue with some of the conjuring spells being absorbed by those with magic absorption.\r<br />\r<br />1.4\r<br />Increased the Skill Usage Mult on many of the conjured undead, so that they contribute to quicker skill raises.\r<br />\r<br />1.3\r<br />Changed the skin of the Summoned Dragon Priest from the ghostly version to that of the &#39;normal&#39; Dragon Priest.\r<br />\r<br />Added the Skeleton Horde: The entry level Summoned Skeleton has been slightly beefed up. The following new conjurable Skeletons have been added as well: Skeleton Archer, Skeleton Guardian, Skeleton Hero, and Skeleton Champion. Also included are Elven variants of all four, armed with Elven gear rather than Ancient Nordic.\r<br />\r<br />1.2 -\r<br />Fixed level of spell not appearing correctly in the spell description.\r<br />\r<br />1.1 - \r<br />Fixed grey face bug on spell vendor.\r<br />\r<br />1.0 -\r<br />Original Release\r<br />",
