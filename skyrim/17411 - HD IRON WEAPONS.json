  "summary": "Iron weapons retextured at high resolution (2k) using photo textures of real materials.  Each weapon and normal map have been completely redone with a goal of achieving a realistic look.  There are two variants to choose from: 1) the default which is more of a rustic and worn look, 2) the \\\"Nordic Style\\\" which is a look consistent with more recent",
  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i1162.photobucket.com/albums/q524/exraycatt/NordicStyle2.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1162.photobucket.com/albums/q524/exraycatt/RUSTICSTYLE2.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nUPDATE 5/28/12: Version 2 completed - Nordic and Rustic with all 7 weapons and each set having a unique scabbard as well.  See pics for comparison.  Version 2 gives the weapons even more accurate detail and realism (IMO), with reworked textures, normal maps, specular maps, and environment maps.  The Nordic style will still have the appearance of being a bit more new and shiny while the rustic style retains its metallic look yet looks like an experienced iron weapon.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 5/27/12: Added  version 2 of the Waraxe, Battleaxe, and sword for both Nordic and Rustic Style variants.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 5/22/12: Added Iron Mace Nordic Style Version 2: This is just the first I have finished and the rest will definitely follow and soon.  The goal of Version 2 is to give the weapons more of their recently-forged and metallic look back, though rusty will still be rusty but not extremely poor quality rusty in terms of appearance like version 1.  Constructive criticism is appreciated.\r\n\r\nWHAT THIS MOD DOES:\r\nThis is my attempt to give the iron weapons the look that I wanted, which was to make them look more detailed and realistic.  I tried to achieve this by using textures from photos of actual materials.  I felt the vanilla weapons were a bit too shiny for iron and appeared to have a coating of shellac or plastic on them.   \r\n\r\nI also thought it strange that you forge a brand new set of iron armor and shields and they are rusty.  Yet when you forge a new iron weapon it is shiny.  This mod is also the first step in trying to remove this discrepancy.\r\n\r\n There are two variants to choose from: 1) the default which is more of a rustic and worn look, 2) the \\\"Nordic Style\\\" which is a look consistent with more recently forged and well-cared for weapons\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nNOTE for VERSION 2: As of now only the mace is done so if you install only this file, you will only have the mace.  If you want to have all retextures and the new mace, install one of the version 1 options and then the version 2 mace over that.\r\n\r\n1) Use NMM! or, \r\n\r\n2) Paste the \\\"data\\\" folder into your Skyrim folder\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\n1) Use NMM!, or \r\n2) Delete \\\"iron\\\" folder out of /\\\"Skyrim/Data/textures/weapons/\\\" folder\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES:\r\nNone.  This is a REPLACER so should not be incompatible with anything\r\n\r\nWANT YOUR DAGGER TO BE SHEATHED ON YOUR BACK?\r\nFor anyone who saw the dagger on my character\\'s back in the scabbard, you can get that by using this awesome mod by DarkenDE\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12852]DAGGERS ON PELVIS BACK[/URL]\r\n\r\n",
