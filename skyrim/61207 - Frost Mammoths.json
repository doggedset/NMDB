This mod simply takes advantage of modder resources to include Frost Mammoths into the world of Skyrim. I thought it would be nice to see a little variety in the world when visiting the more snow covered areas of Skyrim. You will now encounter these new white coloured mammoths in certain [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Giant_Camps]giant camps[/url]. They have more resistance to frost but also have a weakness to fire.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5813d4_de8e59c816bb4b7bac0ab5c815c2a807~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_600,h_86,al_c/5813d4_de8e59c816bb4b7bac0ab5c815c2a807~mv2.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The mammoths will replace the mammoths in the game located at [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Blizzard_Rest]Bliazzard Rest[/url], [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Red_Road_Pass]Red Road Pass[/url] and [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Tumble_Arch_Pass]Tumble Arch Pass[/url]. Two new mammoths have been placed alongside the giants at [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Secunda%27s_Kiss]Secunda's Kiss[/url]. You may also find any dead mammoths in snow areas replaced.\n<br />\n<br />The mod is as lore friendly as far as I can see, and I have researched a little on mammoths in general and in Skyrim. There's no reason why a mammoth cannot have white fur. If you don't feel the mod is lore friendly and this bothers you then simply do not install it.\n<br />\n<br />Other features of the mod include unique tusks on the Frost Mammoths which are white and the ability to conjure your own Frost Mammoth. You can find the new spell tome for achieving this in [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Arcanaeum]The Arcanium[/url] at the [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:College_of_Winterhold_%28place%29]College of Winterhold[/url].\n<br />\n<br />As mentioned above, there is an addon for the mod which is optional. Installing this will include frost giants to go with the mammoths in some areas. The stat changes for resistance and weaknesses are pretty much the same as the mammoths.\n<br />\n<br />These textures come from a mod called Frost Giants which adds new camps into the game where you can encounter Frost Giants and Frost Mammoths. I felt that it would be nice to have the additional option of having these creatures throughout Skyrim's other camps, so I created this mod. The assets were marked as free to use with proper credit given so I thought they would be perfect for this as I'm not too great at texturing myself.[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5813d4_6b607762312244698507151c1b833216~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_600,h_86,al_c/5813d4_6b607762312244698507151c1b833216~mv2.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]xsQyVJ0C3xg[/youtube][youtube]GgtCydZN-L4[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5813d4_9a1cd88c364640ac8da15eec9a842fe9~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_600,h_86,al_c/5813d4_9a1cd88c364640ac8da15eec9a842fe9~mv2.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1814616/?]exray catt[/url] for mammoth and giant textures.[/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[line]",
