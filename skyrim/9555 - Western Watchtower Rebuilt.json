  "descriptionHtml": "NEW UPDATE!! Version 1.1 Released (see changelog)\r\n\r\nIt should not break any quests. Feel free to play through the initial dragon battle.

She will advance the quest.\r\n\r\nIf you like Whiterun as much as me, try this: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9277\r\n\r\nThink you deserve more than a s***** axe for slaying a dragon and saving Whiterun?
