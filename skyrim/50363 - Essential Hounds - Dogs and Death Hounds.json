  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red][center][size=4]Requirements:\r<br />Skyrim - Latest Version, Dawnguard DLC[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][size=3][u]Please do not upload this mod anywhere else&#33;&#33;[/color][/u][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][size=3][u]Description:[/color][/size][/u]\r<br />You know I have honestly never really played Skyrim with a dog companion throughout the game and I had always wanted to have a loyal dog follower&#33; Well it turns dogs can die..EASILY...and death hounds? Well they don&#39;t even level with you, they are stuck at level 5&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][size=3][u]This mod makes the following changes:[/color][/size][/u]\r<br />Vigilance (dog) - Essential\r<br />Meeko (dog) - Essential, Max level increased to 50 (was 25)\r<br />Stray Dog (dog) - Essential, Max level increased to 50 (was 25)\r<br />Bran (hunter dog) -  Max level increased to 50 (was 25)\r<br />Sceolang (hunter dog) -  Max level increased to 50 (was 25)\r<br />Garmr (death hound) - Protected, Starts at level 10,  Can now level with player, Changed max level to 50 (was level 5)\r<br />CuSith (death hound) - Protected, Starts at level 10,  Can now level with player, Changed max level to 50 (was level 5)\r<br />\r<br />So as you can see all the animals listed above are now Essential or Protected and will level with the player up to a max of level 50. My reason for changing the 2 hunter dogs is because Essential works much better for followers than protected. With Protected only the player can kill the follower, not NPCs. With Essential no one can kill the follower. The reason that the Dawnguard animals are protected is because at some point you will fight them and will have to be killed.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][size=3][u]Installation:[/color][/size][/u]\r<br />Install using NMM, the load order doesn&#39;t matter really. As long as it is below Dawnguard.esm and below any other mod that might affect the dogs stats. Also make sure this is placed below the official patches in your load order so the changes will take place.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][size=3][u]Compatibility:[/color][/size][/u]\r<br />I haven&#39;t thoroughly tested with other follower mods (UFO, AFT, EFF) so I am not sure if it is compatible with those mods or not. Any mod that affects the stats of these dogs will NOT be compatible with this mod. If the mod changes just the texture of the dog then it should be compatible.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][size=3][u]What about the Unofficial Dawnguard Patch? I thought it fixed the Death Hounds? (UDGP)[/color][/size][/u]\r<br />What the UDGP does is it makes the Death Hounds level with the player to level 25 and makes them Protected. This patch I made makes them level up to level 50 as well as all other dog companion creatures in the game. With this patch all dog companions will level to level 50 with the player and will either be Essential or Protected. If you wish to use the UDGP with this mod then make sure this mod is placed AFTER (or Lower) than the UDGP.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][size=3][u]Changes:[/color][/size][/u]\r<br />v1.1a\r<br />-Silly me I forgot a dog&#33; But it should be fine now&#33;\r<br />\r<br />v.1.1\r<br />-Changed Garmr, CuSith, Bran, and Sceolang all from Essential to Protected to allow you to be able to kill them while fighting the opposite faction\r<br />\r<br />v1.0\r<br />-Initial Release",
