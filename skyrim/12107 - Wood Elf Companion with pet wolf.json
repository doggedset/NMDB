  "descriptionHtml": "-Final Update- Sorry i couldn\\'t make the wolf follow and help you like a followers pet. I have no idea what to do and no one has bothered to send me any helpful advice...or any advice at all. Therefore I probably just going to leave it as it is now, a small elf assassin in riften jail with a wolf next to her. you can recruit the elf..but the wolf doesnt do anything.  Sorry about this, but i have things i\\'d rather do than work on this when no one is going to help me figure out how to make the wolf do anything\r\n\r\n\r\n-old info-\r\nWhats better than a follower? how about a follower with thier own pet. This mod has a Female Wood Elf and her pet black wolf. Fixing the bugs of the wolf not following her atm, but should be done soon.\r\n\r\nTo find this lost elf and her pet and recruit them to follow you, find them in the Riften Jail where they have, unfortunately, been thrown for trying to steal food(hey, lost elf and her pet, gotta survive somehow).\r\n\r\nElf is an assassin that works with 2 dirks/swords",
