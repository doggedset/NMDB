  "descriptionHtml": "---README---\r\n\r\nStormcloaks and Guards - Armors\r\n\r\nby Dall\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n\r\n28/08/2012\r\n\r\nStormcloak n Guards Armors are replacement (HD) textures n meshes for all Stormcloak n City Guards Armors - which beside obvious visual improvements - do add option to buy / craft them as well. \r\n\r\nThese Armors / changes they introduce were made to accompany / extend some my other mods - notably my Imperial Soldiers, Stormcloaks n Guards with Faces and my Skyrim Faces NPCs (face morphs) - but use of this mod is completely independent of them and it can be used as normal / standalone mod.\r\n\r\nStormcloaks Soldiers and City Guards now look more like their respective professions (Army / Police) and less like rag-tag bunch of silly nitwits. Stormcloak Foot Soldiers and Guards now have Padded Hide Armors while Officers have instead of Bear-Jaw Cuirass new Medium - metal scales - Armor which your character can have as well. Stormcloak\\'s Full Face Helmet (now Heavy - Light Armor / Medium Armor) is now optional (if this mod is used with my Stormcloaks n Guards with Faces) and is just one of three in this mod available Stormcloak War Helmets. Other two are Studded Hide Helmet as standard Stormcloak (Light) Helmet and Bear-Head Helmet as Officer / Stormcloak Hero Helmet. Craft wise two padded leather armors and Light (Hide) Helmet are in Hide group while metal ones are in Iron (Banded / Scaled Armor Class). Stats for original / in-game Armors are unchanged.\r\n\r\nTo install you need to navigate to your Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim - game folder and paste / drag n drop in it my Data (mod) folder. Allow overwrite!    \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like this new look, simply delete / remove my mod .esp and files from Data/meshes n textures/armor/stormcloaks n sons of talos and original look will be restored to your game.\r\n\r\nBugs/conflicts: None known with my lot - but if you have some other mods, which change / use same Stormcloak / Sons of Talos resources - expect due to zillion of levelled lists - used for distribution of this models/textures - some clashes / game restoring to in-game originals. \r\n  \r\nUse:\r\nFree to use but if used for modding ask me for permission!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for great game.\r\n\r\n",
