Male can be different than female if you want. \r\n\r\n\r\n1) Morning Star: Adds a spiked ball and chain attached at mid-tail.\r\n2) Scorpion:     Adds a scorpion stinger to the end of the tail.\r\n3) Spiked:       Adds a dinosaur like spiked tail cluster to the end of the tail.\r\n4) Thorned:      Adds crescent shaped thorns along each side of the tail.\r\n5) Trident:      Adds a three pronged tail-end.\r\n\r\n[img]http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4153/requir.png[/img]\r\n\r\nIts based off the vanilla Argonian male tail textures and my female Argonian texture\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27469\r\n\r\n[img]http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/2482/installa.png[/img]\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t set this up for NMM to install because of the choices, I wouldn\\'t use NMM.\r\n\r\nManual install:\r\n\r\nIn the files you will find named folders: \r\n\r\nMorningstar\r\nScorpion\r\nSpiked\r\nThorned\r\nTrident\r\n\r\nLook at the screenshots to help choose which one to use.\r\nPick one male and one female tail style and copy them into the  folder named \\\"character assets\\\" in the included \\\"blank folder path\\\" folder:\r\n\r\nblank folder path/data/meshes/actors/character/character assets\r\n\r\nnow copy the above \\\"data\\\" folder into your Skyrim folder then yes to overwrite prompt.\r\n\r\nThis will include the needed morning star texture by doing it this way.
