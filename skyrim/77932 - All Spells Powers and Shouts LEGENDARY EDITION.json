I love me my Black Market.\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to leave any feedback and let me know if I missed anything as well as edit the .txt as much as you like to meet your needs.\r<br />\r<br />BATCH FILES BY YA BOY ALPHA:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77932/?]All Spells Powers and Shouts LEGENDARY EDITION[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77947/?]All Unique Items Dragon Priest Masks and Daedric Artifacts LEGENDARY EDITION[/url]",
