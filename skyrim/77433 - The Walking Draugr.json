In any case just place my mod after any mod that says it changes races just in case it may change its abilities too.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#B22222][b][size=6][u]For more chaos and death...[/u][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68090/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/6C51zvM.jpg[/img][/url][/color]\n<br />[/color][/size]\n<br />[color=#B22222][size=6][u]FAQ:[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[color=#FBB117]Q:[/color] [color=#1589FF]Are essential NPCs affected?[/color]\n<br />[color=#7f5217]A:[/color] Essential NPCs cant die and the condition for the effects are the death of NPCs so they are not affected unless you remove their essential status with another mod.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#FBB117]Q:[/color] [color=#1589FF]Is this compatible with Hateful Wenches?[/color]\n<br />[color=#7f5217]A:[/color] It was suppose to be a feature of it but got a little bigger and I thought it will be nice to make it a separate thing, I will probably make an alternative version of the mod for hateful wenches to maybe exclude them (lol?) since this mod is INSANE with hateful wenches, good luck. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=https://www.patreon.com/KozukeHajime/overview][img]https://i.imgur.com/Z9PezBO.jpg[/img][/url][/center]\n<br />[color=#B22222][size=6][u]History:[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />1.0.0 - Initial Release.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[color=#B22222][size=6][u]Permissions:[/u][/size][/color][/size]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />-Just dont upload this and say you made it or something.\n<br />-If you want to share this mod please just link this page.\n<br />-You are free to make any translation, just send me a pm if you finished so i know and can link it here. \n<br /> For some other things, send me a pm to know please.\n<br />-Live and let others live.\n<br />-Treat wenches with... resurrections\n<br />-To ignore my bad english...\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/size]\n<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/0p8INC7.jpg[/img][/center]",
