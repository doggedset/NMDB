It was deleted by Bethesda for no reason.\r<br />\r<br />It is a simple mod, I created it for myself, but I decided to share it with you. I hope you will enjoy it.\r<br />\r<br />It should be compatible with everything. The only area what was edited is WaywardExterior cell.\r<br />No DLCs are required, only an updated Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />Ruled/Rokax\r<br />\r<br />No thanks to Bethesda for removing it.",
