  "descriptionHtml": "Caution: This mod seems to cause CTD\\'s with Skyrim 1.8, I\\'ll be working on a new way to do this. Works fine with previous versions. \r\n\r\nThis mod aims to make your character’s fatigue a little more than just a bar on the bottom of your screen. \r\n\r\nAt 50% stamina, your character will start to breath heavy and a heartbeat-like screen effect will play. As your character gets more tired, the screen effects will get more intense. When they start to regenerate stamina, the screen effects and heavy breathing will stay until 80% is recovered. The screen effects will get less intense as you recover stamina.\r\n\r\nA couple of issues:\r\nStamina debuffs will read as less than 100%. With the change to 80% diseases and stuff shouldn’t cause your character to permanently breathe hard; however there is a significant debuff in the Dawngaurd MQ that can cause issues. My recommendation is to just disable the mod if you need to in the Dawnguard MQ.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have a lot of script heavy mods or a system crippling ENB going, the screen effects transition from light to intense and vice versa will not be as smooth.\r\n\r\n[youtube]yMYRj2GAy1w[/youtube]",
