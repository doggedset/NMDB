  "descriptionHtml": "A fix for the vampiric eyes for female human characters beeing \\\"hazel brown\\\" instead of \\\"vampiric\\\".\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 0.1 is working but it has a small glitch in the display of the race\\'s name in the skill menu. If you find it annoying, upgrade to 0.2 but keep in mind that the text is not localized.\r\n\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I started a new game dedicated to play as a female vampire, I went into the vampiric eye glitch. So I decided to have a look inside the master file with TESNIP and I think I have found what was wrong and I thought \\\"why not sharing?\\\". Now you can use any eye modification mod and they will apply when you become or are already a vampire as a human female.\r\n\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nUse the Nexus Mod Manager for an automatic installation.\r\nOr download the ZIP archive and extract it in the \\\"Data\\\" folder inside your Skyrim installation directory (Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\data) then click on \\\"Data Files\\\" in the launcher and check the box in front of \\\"Vampire Eyes Fix.esp\\\".\r\n\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL\r\n\r\nUse the Nexus Mod Manager for an automatic desinstallation.\r\nOr simply delete \\\"Vampire Eyes Fix.esp\\\" in the \\\"Data\\\" folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY\r\n\r\nAny mods that DO NOT modify the vampire races for Nord, Breton, Imperial or Redguard.\r\n\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nIf you notice anything else related to vampiric eyes not displayed as intended, just tell me and I will try to solve it.\r\n\r\nThe names of the races displayed in the skill menu are not localized, if anyone can point me to a way to fix this, I\\'ll be happy to fix it.\r\n\r\nFeel free to include this small mod as long as you give credits or ask me what to change if you plan to do something with the vampire race.\r\n\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\n0.2 - Fixed the display of the races in the skill menu (but no localisation).\r\n\r\n0.1 - Vampiric Eyes Bugfix for Nord, Breton, Imperial and Redguard females.",
