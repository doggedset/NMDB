  "descriptionHtml": "I made this mod based around a female character I was building. I was looking for a patical look as we all do. I wanted that necklace and this robe to reach the look I wanted. Unfortunately the necklace I liked didn&#39;t suit my characters class. Presto change-o , Jewelery Revamped. \r<br />\r<br />=========================================================================================== \r<br />\r<br />Necklace Features \r<br />\r<br />You can now craft all nine divine amulets free from there enchantments at the blacksmithing forge. The necromancer amulet, ancient nord amulet and elder council amulet have also been added. I also added one jeweled quicksilver necklace and one normal silver necklace for raw material ingredients purposes. \r<br />\r<br />=========================================================================================== \r<br />\r<br />Necklace Light Armor Features \r<br />\r<br />Thirteen necklaces now have armor value and can be improved at the work bench all the way up to legendary. \r<br />\r<br />=========================================================================================== \r<br />\r<br />Ring Light Armor Features \r<br />\r<br />For now I just added one ring, a quicksilver ruby ring with the same armor value as the necklaces. You can improve it and enchant it aswell. \r<br />\r<br />=========================================================================================== \r<br />\r<br />Circlet Light Armor Features \r<br />\r<br />Two circlets added, the armor value are slightly better then the necklaces and ring. The armor value is equivalent to a leather helm. You can improve it and enchant them aswell. \r<br />\r<br />=========================================================================================== \r<br />\r<br />How it all works and what perks you need \r<br />\r<br />I wanted to keep it simple here. All that is required is the steelsmithing perk and a goldsmithing kit. Under the misc section at the blacksmithing forge you will find the kit. Keep the kit in your inventory. \r<br />\r<br />=========================================================================================== \r<br />\r<br />Small Tip \r<br />\r<br />To make a necklace look right on female models, reduce the weight settings. You can do this with the console commands. player.setnpcweight &lt;value between 0-100 \r<br />\r<br />It all depends on what type of clothing is on. Play around with it, console commands are your friend. \r<br />\r<br />Check out my other mods, please endorse and send me feedback.",
