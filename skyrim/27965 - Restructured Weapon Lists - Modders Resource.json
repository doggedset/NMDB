  "descriptionHtml": "See videos for a tutorial on adding weapons.\r\n\r\nChanges in v1.1:\r\nDraugr use separate shield lists\r\nArchers may carry 1handed weapons instead of just daggers\r\nBandit chiefs can be archers\r\nDual-wielding is now available to all actors\r\nA few redundant changes to insure random distribution\r\n\r\nThis resource will make adding new weapons to levelled lists much simpler, all you have to do is make the item in Weapons and then drop it in the corresponding list (ex. WeaponSteel1H for 1-handed steel weapons) and they will be included in the levelled list for any that use it, meaning all actors (characters), vendors, chests and rewards.\r\n\r\n[b]Leveled list progress finished for v1.0.[/b]\r\n\r\nIntroduces branching of weapons (Any -> 1H -> Iron ->Sword) rather than big jumbled lists in vanilla.\r\n\r\nList legend:\r\nIronSteel means includes only iron and steel weapons and shields\r\nBandit means weapons up to Elven and iron/steel shields\r\nStandard means weapons and shields up to ebony\r\nDae means all the way up to Daedric\r\n1H 1-handed\r\n2H 2-handed\r\nDW Dual-wield\r\n1HS 1-handed with shield\r\nArcher sets include a bow, arrows and a dagger\r\n\r\nI can\\'t include Dragonbone weapons as my CK crashes any time I try to use Dawnguard; so if anyone wants to add those in they are welcome; however, I don\\'t believe dragonbone, dragonscale and the dragonbone weapons should be in the leveled lists at all just for lore\\'s sake.\r\n\r\nThis will also allow for ratios to be calculated easier, you can just duplicate a sublist to make it more common.  If you have a sublist of iron 1handed weapons, 1 sword, 1 axe and 1 mace you can duplicate the sword and make it go from 33% chance to 50%.\r\nThis allows for more combinations of weapons that you will encounter, ex. a bandit duel wielding an iron sword and an orcish axe.\r\nThis still maintains vanilla limits (bandits only have up to Elven, etc.) with a few tweaks to make the game more balanced.\r\n\r\nv0.1 only has the lists and branches, no leveled lists yet",
