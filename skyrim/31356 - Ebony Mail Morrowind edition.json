  "descriptionHtml": "The Ebony Mail was the top armor to have in Morrowind.  Best armor rating and one of the best enchantments.  Skyrim\\\\\\'s version, after missing this armor in Oblivion, was a big let down.\r\n\r\nBut, not really difficult to change so I\\\\\\'m surprised it hasn\\\\\\'t been done.\r\n\r\nThe armor is improved to be just about 10% better than daedric (like Morrowind\\\\\\'s)\r\n\r\nThe enchant has also been changed:\r\n\r\nFire resist 75%\r\nFortify armor 50%\r\nMagic resist 20%\r\n\r\nFor one of the last daedric quests that you have to give up one of your companions permanently for, my thought was that Morrowind\\\\\\'s stats were far more fitting as a reward for that loss.  Enjoy.",
