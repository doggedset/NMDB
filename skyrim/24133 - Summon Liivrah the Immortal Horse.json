  "summary": "Adds a summonable horse known as Liivrah who has better stats but the same appearance as Arvak. The appearance can be changed with mods that edit the appearance of Arvak.",

Such a wonderful looking undead horse, and yet he was so weak, so slow. And then there&#39;s the cost of that spell; how were warriors supposed to use such a spell? Instead of modding Arvak, I instead opted to create my own horse with the same appearance. And so Liivrah was born.\r<br />\r<br />Liivrah has the skin of Arvak, but you will find him to be faster (yet not overpoweringly so) and very much immortal. He still has to be summoned (the spell works in the same way as the Summon Arvak spell), but I tweaked the spell cost so that it was 0 and doubled the time he lasts (two minutes instead of the vanilla one). This allows warrior/low leveled characters who haven&#39;t invested any levels into magicka to use the spell without any difficulty.\r<br />\r<br />Liivrah&#39;s immortality was tested by jumping off the top of the Throat of the World. He survived the landing(s). I gave him a very high amount of health and stamina so that he could sprint for quite some time.\r<br />\r<br />In order to get Liivrah, you do not actually have to do the Dawnguard questline. Simply open the console and type:\r<br />[b]help &#34;summon liivrah&#34; 0[/b]\r<br />It should come up with a Spell ID and an Item ID.\r<br />For the spell, you can type:\r<br />[b]player.addspell SpellID[/b]\r<br />For the Item ID, you can type:\r<br />[b]player.additem ItemID #ofItems[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve also added the Spell Tome to the leveled lists and it is confirmed to be in the inventories of merchants who sell Conjuration spells. As well as being in the inventories of merchants who sell conjuration tomes, the spell is also found in random loot in dungeons, though rarely. The lesser power version is only available through the use of the console.\r<br />\r<br />When using the console, you will notice that there are two different versions of the spell. One is the spell version, and the other is the lesser power version. You can add them both and then use whichever one you please or simply add the one of your choice. In my game, the first one that shows up is the spell and the second one that shows up is the lesser power version. I can&#39;t say for certain if it is the same in all games.\r<br />\r<br />If you have any issues, please let me know.\r<br />\r<br />Liivrah is available in both Dawnguard and non-Dawnguard variants.\r<br />The Dawnguard version requires the 1.9 update, while the non-Dawnguard variant can be used with older versions of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />A demonstrationof Liivrah&#39;s immortality (and evidence of the Dragonborn&#39;s mortality), along with one of his main uses:\r<br />[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr7_YWC0PqA]Liivrah the Immortal[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatability[/b]\r<br />All this mod does is add another spell that summons an edited version of Arvak, renamed to Liivrah. If you download any mod that changes the texture of Arvak, Liivrah will also have the new texture. Liivrah and Arvak use the same textures. It is fully compatible with mods that alter Arvak&#39;s texture.\r<br />\r<br />Pick either the Dawnguard version or the Non-Dawnguard version, depending on whether or not you have the DLC. Just remember that I&#39;m not supporting the non-Dawnguard version; if there are any problems with it, I will not be fixing them. Only the Dawnguard version will be supported since I have the DLC and will use it in my mods.\r<br />\r<br />This mod does alter the leveled lists for Conjuration spell tomes, so if you have another mod that edits the leveled lists, the tomes for Summon Liivrah may not show up in merchant inventories and loot. If they don&#39;t, the spells can still be accessed via the console. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Recommended Mods:[/b]\r<br />Any mod that edits the texture of Arvak would be good. If a mod edits more than the texture, I can&#39;t tell you how it would interact with this mods .esp file. There are no edits to Arvak, so it should be fine. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Changes:[/b]\r<br />9/14/12: Added the Summon Liivrah spell as a Lesser Power.\r<br />10/8/12: Created a non-Dawnguard version of Liivrah. \r<br />3/18/13: Fixed an issue with the Lesser Power version of the spell having a cost of 200 when being cast like an ordinary spell. Also increased Liivrah&#39;s stats, and added a spell tome for the Lesser Power version which has also been added into the leveled lists. Spell tomes were added to more leveled lists which will cause duplicates, but hopefully increase the frequency at which it appears in loot.\r<br />\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/xLdZTNC.png[/img][/url][/center][/center]",
