  "modId": 40633.0,
  "modName": "Necromantic Spells",
  "summary": "Adds 2 new master spells for the conjuration tree, based around death magic. I will be adding more spells as time goes. But I figured I wanted to give a small taste of things to come.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The spells can be only be found inside a special dungeon (vanilla dungeon) in Skyrim. I will include a cheat that will tell you where to find the spells and I will also post a video that spoils the location. However I can give you a clue to where to find them. They are located within a vanilla necromancer dungeon.\r\n\r\nNote that these spells are considered death magic, and they cannot be resisted. They also have custom sound effects and I will be adding more spells for sure. Send me a message or post a comment if you have anything necromancy related and I will try to add that to this mod.\r\n\r\nThe two spells that are included are: Death Ray, this spell is sort of a skill shot spell with a really high amount of damage. 500 death magic damage to be precise, the mana cost is very high so you won\\'t be able to use it a lot. But as you progress in your conjuration skill the mana cost of the spell will decrease of course, but it still won\\'t be a spell that you can use over and over. More likely once per battle.\r\n\r\nThe other spell is called: Implosion, it deals a massive AoE damage to any target around you and (100 death magic damage.) \r\n\r\nIf you have any problems or errors, just send me a pm and I will try to help you!",
