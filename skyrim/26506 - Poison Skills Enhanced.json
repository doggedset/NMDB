  "summary": "Makes poisons actually useful by enhancing poison related skills, such as more hits per poison.\r\nAll while staying balanced. (for example paralysis poison for one hit only)\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "As a great fan of the poisons in Witcher & Dragonage, , I was utterly disappointed how useless Skyrim poisons were in comparison.\r\nNot only did you have to reapply them over and over again, they were so weak it beat the entire purpose.\r\nThis mod aims to change that through few simple tweaks, all while keeping balance and immersion.\r\n\r\n[b]Alchemy Changes[/b]\r\n• Concentrated Poison Perk #1 [40] - 5 hits with non-paralysing poisons. [i](vanilla was 2 hits)[/i]\r\n• Concentrated Poison Perk #2 [60] - 10 hits with non-paralysing poisons.\r\n• Concentrated Poison Perk #3 [80] - 15 hits with non-paralysing poisons.\r\n• Poisoner Perk [30] - adds 50% to poison effectiveness. [i](vanilla was 25%)[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]Different Versions[/b]\r\nMod is available in 3 different flavors :\r\n• [b][low][/b] - concentrated perks #1,2\r\n• [b][medium][/b] - concentrated perks #1,2,3\r\n• [b][high][/b] - concentrated perks #1,2,3 + poisoner perk\r\n\r\n[b]Install[/b]\r\n• Recommended to use NMM to install\r\n• Compatible with mods that add new poisons, etc.\r\n• Incompatible with mods that change the above perks.\r\n\r\n[b]Logic behind changes[/b]\r\nThe ultimate poison system is one that is based on time imo. (e.g. Witcher) - however that is not possible to mod (poison dosage is hardcoded)\r\nTherefore my aim with 15x hits was to make reapplying poisons less of a hassle, so it lasts for a fight or two.\r\nI\\'ve found higher numbers 20-30x+ harms the poison making process, which I think is bad.\r\nAs for upgrading poisoner to 50%, that was a nobrainer - 25% was too low for the perk.\r\n\r\n[b]Your feedback is welcome ![/b]\r\nThis is still early stage of this mod, and I\\'m more than open to suggestions.\r\n• What do you think about 15 hits per poison stretched over 3 perks ?\r\n• Do you think neurotoxins (fear, frenzy, etc) should be limited as well ? maybe limited to 5 hits ?\r\n• Do you think poisoner perk is too little or too much ? would you like to see an additional poisoner perk that raises it to 100% ?",
