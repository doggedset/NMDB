  "descriptionHtml": "A Carefully chosen Soundtrack designed to expand the beautiful atmosphere of skyrim, and further the emotional depth within your own adventures\r\n\r\nThis Soundtrack add 20 fantastic orchestral pieces to further develop the emotional atmosphere of skyrim and give the player specific feelings in different circumstances.\r\n\r\n*due to the size of this mod i cannot post this on skyrim workshop, sorry*\r\n\r\nThis Mod ADDS to the existing content within the game, it does not REPLACE them, therefore there will be a mixture of both vanilla content and imported content. This mod is only compatible with other soundtrack mods that have altered the music type files, its not tested, but i believe that if xwm files not only overwrite the vanilla soundfiles but also modded ones two.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack has tracks designed to play under specific circumstances or in a certain location OR a combination of both. For example, some tracks are made to play exclusively at day or night, or inside a tavern or town.\r\n\r\nIts been a long process creating this mod and i dont plan to abandon it upon release, so if there are any bugs that you are recieving, please let me know so i can correct any faults causing errors and crashes etc..\r\n\r\nalso, i will be adding to this content, so if there is an all time favourite orchestral piece/pieces that you would like in this mod, please let me know and will will do my best to fulfil all request\\'s.\r\n\r\n*INSTALLATION*\r\n\r\nplace all files within the skyrim/data folder \r\ntick the boxes inside datafiles on the skyrim launcher and check mod load order\r\nthen enjoy :D\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy some of my other mods!=  http://steamcommunity.com/id/lazersights/myworkshopfiles/\r\n\r\nIf you need assistance, add me on steam [LZK]Lazersights\r\n\r\nplease support me by liking, sharing and favouriting this mod\r\n\r\nspecial thanks to Stumpyspoon for suggesting tracks :D",
