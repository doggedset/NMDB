  "descriptionHtml": "[img]https://i.imgur.com/biEgFAs.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[color=Red][size=+3]Features:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=+2]Balance and Hardness[/size][/b]\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />All craftable vanilla weapons and some additional previously uncraftable weapons now have the ability to be upgraded into new versions. \r<br />[color=Red]Balanced:[/color] Weapon speed is increased while damage and weight are decreased.\r<br />[color=Red]Hardened:[/color] Weapon speed is decreased while damage and weight are increased.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=+2]New crafting materials[/size][/b]\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[color=Red]Refined Ingot:[/color] Used in the creation of balanced weapons, made by the purification of 2 ingots and a charcoal heated fire\r<br />[color=Red]Dense Ingot:[/color] Used in the creation of hardened weapons, made by smelting 2 ingots and the new material coal\r<br />[color=Red]Coal:[/color] Created by breaking down iron ore into its most basic element\r<br />[color=Red]Charcoal:[/color] Created by the treatment of firewood in the smelter\r<br />[color=Red]Flawless Iron/Steel Ingot:[/color] Used in the creation of superior weapons, made by smelting 1 refined and 1 dense ingot\r<br />[color=Red]Fine Leather/Strips:[/color] Used in the creation of superior weapons, made by combining 2 leather.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=+2]Weapon Equalization[/size][/b]\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[color=Red]Ancient Weapons:[/color] The grass really was greener on the other side. Advanced armors has until now been useless in the eyes of the weaponsmith. Heavy armor smiths have enjoyed superior weapon choices while light armor got 2. No more&#33; Ancient weapons have been added to the Advanced Armors perk giving you a new choice on the light armor path. \r<br />\r<br />[color=Red]Superior Weapons:[/color] Iron and Steel weapons are quickly cast aside due to demand for better weapons, leaving these under-appreciated models to rust. Now the Arcane Blacksmith perk grants access to new superior versions. These weapons are powered between Orcish and Ebony and provide more choices and a straight progression from Iron-&gt;Steel for those smiths who don&#39;t wish to specialize.\r<br />\r<br />[color=Red]Weapon Damage:[/color] To further equalize the light and heavy armor paths, weapon damages have been increased along both sides of the tree.\r<br />Dwarven and Elven now do equal damage\r<br />Ancient and Orcish damages raised to bring them in line with proper progression.\r<br />(Upgrade from dwarven to orcish and now your weapon does less damage? Not anymore)\r<br />Glass and Ebony now do equal damage. (heavy armor smiths do still enjoy superior Daedric weapons)\r<br />\r<br />[color=Red]Weapon Speed:[/color] Weapon speeds have been increased in key places quickening the pace of combat. Ever read that handy tooltip claiming Greatswords were faster than BattleAxes? Not true. Greatswords and battleaxes had the same exact speed in the creation kit meaning you swung at the exact same speed and did less damage than a Battleaxe.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=+2]BattleStaves[/size][/b]\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[color=Red]New Weapon Class:[/color] Battlestaves have been added to fill the gap of Daggers in the two hand weapon progression. Faster than a Greatsword, more damage than a one hand mace, and completely silent for those occasions when you want to sneak up on your foe and smash in their skull.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=+2]A New Challenge[/size][/b]\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[color=Red]Deadlier Foes:[/color] You alone do not posses the secrets of a weaponsmith, less savory types now share this newfound knowledge and will use these weapons against you. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Notes: \r<br />A few items were renamed to suit the longer naming schemes but their IDs remain unchanged.\r<br />\r<br />Superior Weapons will be receiving new textures in the next update for now they use the old ones.\r<br />\r<br />Ancient weapons are no longer the same weapons draugr use those weapons have been converted back to vanilla damages and new versions were created using the nord hero weapon models. dropped Draugr weapons remain upgradeable but no longer craftable. If you are using the 1.2 ancient hammer weapons you will need to re-craft them.(My apologies)\r<br />\r<br />BattleStaff weapons currently include one new model that is being used as a placeholder until I can either make all new models for each type or I can re-texture the existing one. If anyone were to be so generous to make them I would gladly use them and give due credit. The placeholder mesh is the simple staff from the now defunct weapons of the third era mod which was given free permissions.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod and I still have plans to expand upon this idea.\r<br />I have no plans in altering the weapon speeds back to their vanilla values as the entire point of the project was to increase combat speed.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />******Version 1.3.1******\r<br />Fixed the upgradeabilty for\r<br />Ancient Dagger\r<br />Balanced Ancient Dagger\r<br />Hardened Ancient Dagger\r<br />**Big thanks to tveohedman for catching this bug\r<br />\r<br />******Version 1.3******\r<br />Superior weapons added\r<br />Iron versions of Katana, Nodachi and Scimitar\r<br />Imperial Officer sword added (Superior)\r<br />Flawless Iron/Steel Ingot\r<br />Creation of Steel Ingots from Corundum and Iron Ingot\r<br />Fine Leather/Strips\r<br />Ancient weapons changed from draugr weapons to nord hero models\r<br />Draugr Mace and Warhammer removed\r<br />Crafting of old Draugr Weapons removed, retained upgradablity, removed perk requirement\r<br />\r<br />******Version 1.2******\r<br />Battlestaff weapons added\r<br />Craftable katana (1hand) added\r<br />Caftable Nodachi (2hand) added\r<br />Craftable Imperial sword added\r<br />Craftable Scimitar added\r<br />All items added to bandit leveled list\r<br />*all new weapons include balanced and hardened versions\r<br />\r<br />******Version 1.1******\r<br />Fixed a error which produced 3 refined/dense dwarven ingots instead of just 1 and reduced weights of the pickaxe and woodcutters axe from 10 to 5 since the woodcutters axe is now useful.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Check out my other mods&#33;\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14809][img]http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/6128/linkfirstaidlogo.gif[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15339][img]http://img543.imageshack.us/img543/7749/linkskysizelogo.gif[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15811][img]http://imageshack.com/a/img822/7707/c7j.gif[/img][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50956/?][img]http://imageshack.com/a/img713/8084/7vx.gif[/img][/url]",
