  "descriptionHtml": "Hello, this is my very first mod and it&#39;s as simple as it can be. I was having a problem in my game where town guards and Stormcloak/Imperial soldiers would use ONLY steel daggers as their one-handed weapon. It got quite annoying to see a full heavy-armor legionnaire with a huge shield wielding a dagger into battle. I didn&#39;t find any help online, so here I am learning to use TES5Edit to do shit myself. The mod simply removes steel daggers from the leveled lists that determine which equipment town guards and soldiers can get. Again, this is my first mod, so please let me know if something goes wrong.\r<br />The mod shouldn&#39;t conflict with anything unless you have a mod that requires that guards and soldiers have daggers.\r<br />Happy gaming&#33;",
