Sometimes there is also a strange glitch if you didn&#39;t put anything on a manekin and reload the room, his static image could be floating anywhere, \r<br />but if you activate the manekin at his initial position, you will be able to store a piece of armor to get him back). \r<br />\r<br />WARNING : if you saved your game with previous versions, or stored some stuff in the cave follow this steps : load game with old esp, take back your stuff, save in ANOTHER INTERIOR cell. Reload game without any esp, save again in the same place. Then reload the game with the new ESP. file... Enjoy &#33;\r<br />\r<br />NEW in 3.0\r<br />- Outside : Hot Spring and enter improved with plants and lights, added a secret door to avoid these ugly grass.\r<br />- Inside : added some foods and clutters, less powered items and stuff to don&#39;t disturb balance of vanilla items.\r<br />- Modified the background story by a better one, translated by Tredmillion. Thanks to him. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />NEW in 2.0\r<br />- External hot spring\r<br />- Fixed some lights/bugs.\r<br />- Added weapon racks and some clutter\r<br />- Renamed some stuff\r<br />\r<br />Let me know if you encouter any bugs or boring glitches.\r<br />Thanks to people downloading and rating my work.\r<br />\r<br />ps: screenshots from creation kit sorry for bad quality.\r<br />In final release i&#39;ll disable fast traveling ability if player never visited the cave.",
