  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][b][u]Description\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b][/size]This balance patch aims to provide a better experience when using the Mage items found in [size=3][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2113195/?]asianboy345&#39;s[/url][/b][/size] excellent work ([url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25846/?]TERA Armors Collection for Skyrim - Male and UNP female[/url]).\r<br />\r<br />This patch was initially created by me for personal use. In particular, I liked the upgrade paths provided by asianboy but always found the Robes and hoods to be extremely imbalanced. It was also confusing to find non-streamlined/random material requirements for many of the robes. Some very powerful items were available very early on in the game due to easy-to-find materials while other weaker items were locked out until many levels later on. It was also a bit unimmersive and counter-intuitive that you had to invest into 100 smithing with all perks obtained (&#33;) to create Mage items.\r<br />\r<br />And thus, this patch was born and I thought I would share it with everyone that feels the same way I do about the balance&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u]A summary of changes:[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Nothing complicated/dangerous was touched. This patch was also created with compatibility and safety in mind.\r<br />[*]Perk requirements for crafting and tempering all Mage items were removed.\r<br />[*]Items separated into 5 tiers, based on power and cost.\r<br />[*]Un-enchanted Robes are much easier to craft, except for the 2 strongest ones.\r<br />[*]Boots/gloves/hoods(they are actually invisible circlets) are very easy to craft.\r<br />[*]Fixed a couple of issues with consistency, namely with the Nightwinder robe (you can now actually craft it&#33;).\r<br />[*]All items were re-evaluated to be much more balanced (no specific formula was used, but their worth is more in line with their cost).\r<br />[*]Removed all Spell School cost reduction effects. This was done with Perk & Spell overhaul mods in mind. But trust me, you will really like the high-tier Robes&#33; (Since you can now comfortably craft the un-enchanted versions, you can just use those instead and self-enchant&#33;)\r<br />[*]Diversified (a bit) the material requirements for the upgrade paths. You&#39;d better stock up on Linen, Leather, Gold coins and Soul Gems&#33;\r<br />[*]The 2 strongest robes (Divinesight and Eternal Magus, Tier 5) are excellent alternatives to the Archmage Robes&#33;\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[size=3][b]For a more comprehensive list of changes, please read the included README&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[i]Update : Please use the updated v1.1 (replace the old) file for better recipe visibility for the Eternal Magus and Divinesight robes.
