  "descriptionHtml": "This is a re-release of my wolf themed retexture of the Comfy knight armor by Azraille I had made a while back. The retexture is of the chest piece only. it was originally female only but is now available for both genders, I am also thinking about redoing the helmet and the gauntlets. It was meant to work with the wolf armor parts (with amidianborn retexture). I created this retexture using elements of Cabal120&#39;s amidianborn wolf armor mainly for the skirt and fur parts, the bulk of the steel texture on the chest plate and forward facing wolf head design were created by me. I originally released this retexture a while back but didn&#39;t have the proper permissions from cabal as he was on a bit of a mod hiatus, he has since contacted me and given permission to release this, so here it is.\r<br />\r<br />Also forgot to mention that in the pictures, my version of Lydia (the one with the mohawk) is wearing the fur belt from northgirl armor, the down fur hood from the hunting grounds armor set and the circlet from wolf mail (also on the male character). those parts aren&#39;t actually part of the faraam armor or this retexture.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements\r<br />\r<br />The ComfyKnight armour by Azraille\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52407/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52407/[/url]?\r<br />\r<br />Recommended \r<br />\r<br />Amidianborn book of Silence by Cabal120\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24909/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24909/[/url]?",
