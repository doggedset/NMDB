  "descriptionHtml": "These settings of EnbSeries by Boris Vorontsov allow you to enjoy a deeper immersion into the world of Skyrim. Programmed in several rounds of tests, at differents times and environment of Skyrim these parameters will help you get an impressive realism. The setting will be updated. You can ask for changes if you would like personnal settings, I will try to address all your requests. No loss of performance on most pc. PLEASE SHARE YOUR FEEDBACK\r\n\r\nThus the following changes are made on the graphics of the game:\r\n-Night, caves and other dark areas are now darker. The torch is now useful in the game, hard to see where come from the wolves and ennemies at night now.\r\n-The brightness of the day is fixed, allowing a more realistic picture. Suprression of the artificial ambient light effect that is observed.\r\n-Contrast enhancement, addition of automatic contrast.\r\n-Improvement in the intensity of shadows for realistic shadows (Do not correct the pixelated shadows).\r\n-Correction of saturation, the flames are more vivid, more realistic colors at night and day.\r\n-Fixed video settings for the weather, stormy weather are now much more realistic.\r\n-Correction indoor scenes. The light now comes only from sources of light for total immersion.\r\n\r\nCHANGES in v1.1s:\r\n-Color at Night & Day have been updated for more realistic colors due to requests from players.\r\n-The Day Contrast has been enhanced, shadows are more realistic and day less darker.\r\n-Lighting in Caves and Dungeons has been updated for a more game immersion with darker areas.\r\n\r\nCHANGES in v1.1:\r\n-Colors are less intense than v1.1s for players who want to have less vivid colors.\r\n\r\nInstalling:\r\nJust put enbseries.ini and d3d9.dll in the root folder of The Elder Scrolls Skyrim. Work on steam. The mod will be automatically launched. Use Shift + F12 to toggle the mod to see changes.\r\n\r\nKnowed Bugs:\r\n[color=#FF0000][b]The mod automatically disabled after few seconds, just minimize Skyrim and switch it again. (You probably need to switch a second time on it to have the game displayed correctly). After that, the mod will be enabled until you quit Skyrim.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n Future enhancements:\r\n-Bug Fix\r\n-Use bloom, SSAO and other stuffs\r\n\r\nGoing further:\r\n-Will use the most recent enbseries version of Boris Vorontsov.",
