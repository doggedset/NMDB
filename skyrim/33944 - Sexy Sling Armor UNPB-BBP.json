  "summary": "I use the term \\\"armor\\\" loosely  :)\r\n\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod, armor or otherwise. Its based on the classic sling bikini look.\r\nIt comes in both red and black color variants and can be found inside the Whiterun blacksmith (Warmaidens), next to the counter. \r\n\r\nArmors are additional content and WILL NOT REPLACE anything already existing in the game.\r\nArmors are for the UNP body. I used BBP too, when I made the mod and it seems it is required (according to feedback). \r\nArmors should work on all weights.\r\nArmors use the Daedric mesh, when they are dropped on the ground etc.\r\n\r\nInstallation should just be a matter of dropping the mods Data folder into your existing Skyrim Data file and making sure the mod is \\\"ticked\\\" (on the Data files list) when you go to start the game.",
