  "modName": "Badlands Retreat",
  "summary": "A small home located north of Morthal in the swamp area.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This home consists of everything the player needs. Smithing, Enchanting, Alchemy, Tanning rack, plenty of Storage Chests, Weapon Racks / Plaques and even your own Werewolf Follower NPC!\r\nThere is also a Wood Chopping Block outside of the house, around back.\r\n\r\nEverything the Adventurer needs all in one compact, cozy location.\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\r\nVersion History:\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nv1 - Initial Release.\r\n\r\nv1.1 - Fixed Follower NPC to be more Aggressive, this is to prevent him from not attacking when he should be.\r\nReplaced 2 Weapon Plaques in the Basement with 2 Weapon/Shield Combo Plaques. Take note that there are 2 Weapon/Shield Combo Plaques in the upstairs area also, the ones on the wall on the same side as the Fire Place and Mannequins.\r\n\r\nv1.1b - I\\'m now offering a version of this house (complete, no bugs that I\\'m aware of) without the Werewolf Follower, for those who just want the Home without being harrassed by a buggy NPC. I will continue to work on the Werewolf to try to fix him. Currently he randomly stops attacking targets, just acts as a meatshield, standing there taking hits but not fighting back, I will be attempting to fix this issue. The issue with him attacking you when you enter the house was caused by his aggression settings being set to \\\"Frenzied\\\" in order to prevent the bug where he randomly stopped attacking, unfortunately this fix didn\\'t work, and caused him to attack players. Sorry for the inconvenience, I will be trying to fix him for those of you who enjoy having him.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\r\nINSTALL\r\n\r\nExtract the .rar to your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\r\nUNINSTALL\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\r\nDelete the \\\"Badlands.esm\\\" file from your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy your stay in Badlands Retreat!\r\nAs usual I am open to suggestions and Comments about the Mod.\r\nPlease report any bugs or suggestions in Comments section.\r\n\r\nNate.",
