  "descriptionHtml": "[b]ALS THUNDER SMITE[/b]\r<br />\r<br />(current as of Skyrim Patch 1.9)\r<br />\r<br />[b][i]Update&#33;[/i][/b] [i]The newest main file is exactly the same as the old one, EXCEPT that now, if you use SKSE, you can activate Thunder Smite simply by pressing the [b]Num0[/b] key, without ever having to equip the power. If you don&#39;t have SKSE, don&#39;t worry; you can still equip the power and use it normally. I also added a new optional file that includes a permanent [u]Dragonrend[/u] effect (on *hostile* dragons only) along with the SKSE functionality.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />This mod came about for a few reasons. I wanted to insta-kill all the enemies around me, but NOT friendlies, AND I wanted to look *cool* doing it. Now, you might say, why not the Master \r<br />spell Fire Storm, then? I&#39;ll give you FIVE reasons why not.\r<br />\r<br />1. It hurts friendlies, too, not just enemies.\r<br />2. It&#39;s LoS (line-of-sight), so if a baddie is standing behind a short stick fence, he&#39;s unharmed.\r<br />3. It&#39;s horizontal, and does not affect people above or below you (such as on the stairs, etc).\r<br />4. It&#39;s not instantaneous (long casting time) and costs mega mana.\r<br />5. It just doesn&#39;t look cool *enough* for me.\r<br />\r<br />Now, 1 and 4 (and theoretically 2, though I haven&#39;t tested it), can be done with the CK. But not 3 and 5.\r<br />\r<br />Hence, Thunder Smite&#33; As soon as you load a game (new game or saved game, doesn&#39;t matter) after loading this mod, you will receive a new power added to your magic menu, called (predictably) Thunder Smite. As a power, it is used with the &#34;z&#34; key on your keyboard, same as shouts. It completely destroys all enemies - and ONLY enemies - anywhere near you. So you \r<br />can cast it in a village without fear of hurting the little old lady who reads your fortune. And it comes with these features&#33;\r<br />\r<br />--No mana cost\r<br />--No cooldown\r<br />--Instant cast, at the press of a button\r<br />--No aiming skills required; the script does that for you\r<br />--Enemies are killed one at a time, in rapid sequence, with a lightning blast marking their death.\r<br />--The lightning blast does NOT affect anyone else, so a villager standing next to the poor foe will be unharmed.\r<br />\r<br />Is this a cheat mod? Of course&#33; That&#39;s why it&#39;s in the Cheats section. So no flaming or denouncing it as a cheat.\r<br />\r<br />Now, I admit, cheating can be a little boring after a while (or so I&#39;ve heard ^-^). Here are the situations in which I use Thunder Smite:\r<br />\r<br />*when I am trying to finish a quest quickly without wanting to take the time to fight\r<br />*when an enemy is so tough that he is either about to kill me, or else it&#39;s taking me forever to kill him/them\r<br />*when I&#39;m in the mood cuz it just looks so dang cool (IMHO)\r<br />\r<br />[u]BUGS[/u]\r<br />\r<br />1. Sometimes the power is finicky. You&#39;ll equip the power (same way you equip any power or shout), and hit &#34;z&#34;, and nothing happens. Usually, just hitting it again will do the trick. Otherwise, you may just have to wait a few minutes before it&#39;ll mysteriously start responding. I do not know why this occurs. Sometimes you can get it working again by unequipping and re-equipping Thunder Smite, or be saving and reloading. It does not bug out that often, though, and when it does, it&#39;s restored pretty quickly.\r<br />\r<br />2. The way the script determines who is an enemy and who isn&#39;t, is by using the IsHostileToActor condition. What this means, in game terms, is that someone has to appear as a red dot in your compass (or they would, if you were looking in that direction). So if you attack a couple travelers, and one traveler flees, you&#39;ll have to take him down some other way. Sometimes, the power will get finicky and not work until an enemy actually hits you, or even until you draw your weapon/spell and/or hit them.\r<br />\r<br />3. It seems that Thunder Smite does NOT work for those who use XBox 360 controllers. Sorry.\r<br />\r<br />If you like this, then enjoy it&#33; If you have comments, feel free to leave them, or to pm me&#33; If you have flames, keep them to yourself&#33; If you have megalomaniacal tendencies, download now&#33; ^-^\r<br />\r<br />------\r<br />\r<br />[u]CREDITS[/u]:\r<br />\r<br />--Bethesda for a great game, a great Creation Kit, and very well done tutorials\r<br />--Angelwraith for teaching me several of the basic principles of scripting in Fallout: New Vegas, which got me a leg up on Papyrus\r<br />\r<br />[u]PERMISSIONS[/u]:\r<br />\r<br />You may use any part of this mod in a mod of your own, as long as you fulfill all of the following conditions:\r<br />\r<br />1.
