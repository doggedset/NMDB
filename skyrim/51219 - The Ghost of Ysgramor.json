  "descriptionHtml": "I know some of you finished the companion questline, and even with the werewolf power, Wuuthrad was a little disappointing. This mod aims to fix that. It also adds a powerful follower called the Ghost of Ysgramor to Jorrvaskr. But the main feature is the new version of Wuuthrad, a powerful weapon called the Blade of Ysgramor. Using a Daedra heart, fifteen ebony ingots, 10 leather strips, Wuuthrad, and Ysgramor&#39;s skull, you can create a powerful blade with a base damage of 24, and a very powerful paralalysis enchantment. A high chance of paralyzing your enemies for five seconds, and a base damage of 24, what other weapon do you need. Ysgramor&#39;s skull can be found in the Arch-Mage&#39;s quarters.\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Just use the Nexus Mod Manager to download and activate the file.
