  "descriptionHtml": "Full hollow ichigo\\'s tattoo\r\nplace it in the skyrim/data/textures/actors/male (WILL APPLY TO ALL CHARACTERS)\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\ni recommend downloading http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13712\r\n\r\nand installing it this way \r\n1. Download and install with Nexus Mod Manager -- this gets the esp file into the system (note: this mod requires both an esp and an esm file. this is the \\\"easy\\\" way to be sure the whole thing gets installed)\r\n2. Then Manual install the folder structure ----\r\nLocate the file folder \\'Unique Character 1_06\\' in your Skyrim Data folder. \r\n... COPY the unique.esm from the UC file into your Data folder (ie up one level)\r\n....open the meshes folder and COPY the unique/female/* folder set into your data>meshes folder\r\npath - Skyrim>Data>meshes>actors>character>[unique meshes folder goes here].....do the same for the unique/Textures folder set into your data>textures\r\npath -- Skyrim>Data>Textures>actors>character>[unique texture folder goes here]\r\nNOW be sure that both the unique.esp and unique.esm are showing in the installed mods window in NMM and both are checked (put the check mark there if one or both don\\'t have one). Launch Skyrim and check your character, there is a default body with a big arm tattoo on it pre-installed, so you will know instantly if you got it right,because that is what your in game character will now look like.\r\nthanks to leonbrass for a good install guide\r\n\r\nthanks to roberto 400 for making the unique character mod.\r\n",
