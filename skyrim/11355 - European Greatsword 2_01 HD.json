  "descriptionHtml": "WHAT IT DOES\r<br />\r<br />It adds two versions of a european two-hander sword, circa 15&#39;th-16&#39;th century, called a &#34;Zweihaender&#34;. (Or in Scotland it would be called a Claymore.)\r<br />\r<br />Unlike modern games which call everything a &#34;two-hander&#34; if it can be used with both hands, historically most such were called a &#34;long sword&#34; and allowed a combination of one and two hand techniques. To be called a Zweihaender (two-hander) or Bidenhaender (both-hander), it had to be a sword of such size that it actually needed both hands on the hilt, full time. It is the final evolution of the longsword as a weapon of war.\r<br />\r<br />Historically, mercenaries certified in the use of the two-hander received twice the pay of a normal mercenary and were called &#34;doppelsöldner&#34; (i.e., double mercenary, though more in the meaning of &#34;double paid&#34;.) On one hand this reflected the increased risk to self, but that people were actually paying that high price tends to indicate that it was worth that.\r<br />\r<br />In game the weapon has the same speed and base damage as the skyforged steel greatsword, but it has greater range (which was the whole reason such weapons existed), higher chance to stagger (due to sheer momentum), and twice the chance to crit. It also gets a hefty bonus to backstab damage, IF you took the stealth perks that give you extra stealth damage with a dagger.\r<br />\r<br />It has a 55 inch long blade, with a width of about 2 inches and an 8 inch unsharpened ricasso which can be used to grab the blade and use the weapon as a short spear. These values are calculated assuming that the average human in the game is about 5&#39;10&#34; tall, i.e., pretty much the same as an adult human male nowadays.\r<br />\r<br />It can be crafted with steel, just like a normal steel greatsword, but you&#39;ll need more steel ingots for the bigger blade.\r<br />\r<br />It does not have a scabbard, since these weapons were historically not carried in sheaths. They were carried with the ricasso on the shoulder, like a polearm.\r<br />\r<br />The versions are:\r<br />\r<br />1. The Straight Zweihänder, probably the most common variant of this weapon.\r<br />\r<br />2. The Flambard Zweihänder which, as the name says, it has a flambard or &#34;flame&#34; blade. It&#39;s wavy, basically. It was also relatively common, though more labour intensive to make and thus more expensive, so not every mercenary had one. It&#39;s still debated exactly how the wavy edge was supposed to be better, but lots of swords were made like that.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO GET IT\r<br />\r<br />Craft them. It only needs steel smithing, after all.\r<br />\r<br />Or just type &#34;help zweihaender&#34; (without the quotes) in the console, and then use &#34;player.additem xxxxxxxx 1&#34; (ditto), where xxxxxxxx is the item id the previous command showed you for whichever variant you want. And you&#39;ll just get one in your inventory.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO INSTALL IT\r<br />\r<br />Extract the archive, with directories, in your &#34;Data&#34; folder. Select it in the list of plugin files in the launcher.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO UNINSTALL IT\r<br />\r<br />Delete the .esp file from your Data directory.\r<br />\r<br />Delete the MGSword directory in both the Meshes and Textures directories.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />CONFLICTS\r<br />\r<br />It shouldn&#39;t conflict with anything.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />VERSION HISTORY\r<br />\r<br />2.01:\r<br />    Corrected the size of the blade (it was 10% too large)\r<br />    Increased the cross size\r<br />    More blood on the blade\r<br />\r<br />2.00:\r<br />    Completely redone the blade and handles\r<br />    Completely redone the texture, now in HD\r<br />    Better Blood\r<br />\r<br />1.01:\r<br />    Replaced the chrome_e effect with reflection for less WTH lighting\r<br />    Increased the glossiness, to look like properly polished steel\r<br />\r<br />1.0:\r<br />    First Skyrim",
