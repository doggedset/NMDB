  "descriptionHtml": "Varis Telmon is a Dunmer spellsword at the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm.  He gets tired of hanging around the Grey Quarter and is always ready for an adventure, so no quests or fees are needed to hire him.  He will level with the player from 5 to maximum and can be married.\r<br />\r<br />His default outfit is hide armor, hide boots, and hide bracers.  His starting weapon is a steel war axe.  He also carries a few random items, a small amount of food and drink, and 0-9 gold.  His NPC class is CombatSpellsword, he uses leveled combat spells, and he prefers heavy armor and one-handed weapons.  He is essential (so you can&#39;t kill him) and has a standard Dark Elf male voice.\r<br />\r<br />No known incompatibilities.  He has a sleeping bag behind the stairs on the second floor of the New Gnisis Cornerclub, though, so anything that rearranges the Cornerclub too much might conflict with his sleep routine.\r<br />\r<br />This mod has been cleaned with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859]TES5Edit[/url].\r<br />\r<br />If you find any bugs or incompatibilities, let me know in the comments&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Also available on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=130465501]Steam Workshop[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[b]-- Instructions (manual install) --[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Download the zip, then unzip the esp and bsa files to your [i].../skyrim/Data/[/i] folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b]-- Changelog --[/b]\r<br />\r<br />See [i]Changes[/i] tab above.\r<br />\r<br />[b]-- Notes --[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod&#39;s filenames are [i]AoM_DunmerFollower.esp[/i] and [i]AoM_DunmerFollower.bsa[/i].\r<br />\r<br />Varis&#39;s base info in the Creation Kit is under [i]Actors → Actor → AoMVarisDunmerFollower[/i].\r<br />\r<br />His BaseID is [i]xx000D62[/i] and his RefID is [i]xx001828[/i] (replace xx with whatever number this mod gets in your game; type [i]help varis[/i] in the console to find it).",
