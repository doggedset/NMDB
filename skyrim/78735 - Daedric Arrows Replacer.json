  "summary": "Completely custom model+textures for daedric arrows and quiver, with real &#34;daedric&#34; glow.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]What&#39;s it and why[/b]\r<br />Don&#39;t you think that original daedric arrows are kinda... not daedric in their style? No spikes, no &#34;twisted&#34; looks, and even no glow. And seems no one else has fixed it, except for few glow mods. So I decided to give them the complete overhaul. This replacer features new model for quiver and arrows with new textures of higher resolution and glow effect similar to other daedric weapons and armor. I tried to get close to the original daedric weapons style.\r<br />\r<br />[b]How to install[/b]\r<br />Simply unpack the archive (use 7-Zip) into your Skyrim folder and overwrite files if need. It is a replacer, so you don&#39;t need to check anything in the launcher. To remove the mod, delete files [your Skyrim folder]&#92;Data&#92;Meshes&#92;weapons&#92;daedric&#92;daedricarrow.nif and [your Skyrim folder]&#92;Data&#92;Meshes&#92;weapons&#92;daedric&#92;daedricarrowprojectile.nif (it uses separate textures, so they won&#39;t conflict with original model).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements[/b]\r<br />Skyrim, no DLC are needed.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Possible mod conflicts[/b]\r<br />Any mods changing the daedric arrows model.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Version history\r<br />[/b]1.1[b]:\r<br />[/b]- new feathers model and textures[b]\r<br />[/b]- quiver texture is less bright, more &#34;daedric&#34; dark maroon color without blue shades\r<br />- slightly more rough normal map\r<br />- fixed some sharp square at the quiver glowing part while zooming out\r<br />1.0 - release.\r<br />\r<br />If you have found any bug, feel free to comment about it&#33;",
