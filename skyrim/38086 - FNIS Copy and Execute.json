  "descriptionHtml": "WHAT IS IT?\r<br />This little program is a tool I wrote for my personal use.\r<br />I just hated to have to browse for that FNIS Generator in Data files.\r<br />\r<br />(IN)COMPATIBILITIES\r<br />It should work with any version of FNIS. Also those yet to come. If it doesn&#39;t, I will update it.\r<br />It will NOT work with Nexus Mod Manager. It&#39;s only for people who install manually. I dislike NMM, deal with it.\r<br />\r<br />WHAT IT DOES?\r<br />It automates the process of installing FNIS. At least a little.\r<br />First it handles copying FNIS files to where they should be.\r<br />Then it starts GenerateFNISForUsers.exe for you, so you don&#39;t need to look for the file yourself.\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO USE IT?\r<br />1. Download FNIS and extract it from archive\r<br />2. Open what was extracted and locate the Data folder in it\r<br />3. Place FNIS_Setup.exe next to the Data folder\r<br />4. Again, make sure that Data folder and FNIS_Setup.exe are in the same directory\r<br />5. Execute FNIS_Setup.exe (which will copy FNIS files and launch FNIS Generator)\r<br />6. Now make sure all FNIS-dependent mods are installed and use FNIS Generator\r<br />\r<br />ADDITIONAL NOTES\r<br />The program runs many many checks before it does anything. It&#39;s because I want it to be as idiot-proof as possible.\r<br />If it encounters any problems, it will do nothing but giving you an error message.\r<br />If you get an error, it&#39;s totally your fault. Read the error message to figure out, what exactly is wrong.\r<br />If there is a problem with finding your game in registry, start Skyrim Launcher.exe, exit it, and try my program again.\r<br />Other errors are not as easy to get by. Use your brain to fix it. Or just don&#39;t use my program, simple :)",
