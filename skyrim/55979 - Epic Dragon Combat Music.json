  "descriptionHtml": "I thought this album I listened to on bandcamp was incredible (I definately Recommend checking it out at http://theanaesthete.bandcamp.com)\r<br />So I simply decided to make it play during Dragon combats, however, I&#39;m new to modding, and this may play for other bosses as well. If theres any problems with it, simply post it in the comments.\r<br />\r<br />To install, simply drag the contents in the winrar file to your Skyrim Data file.\r<br />\r<br />Tracks used:\r<br />1. Ryu / Tradition\r<br />2. Fudo / The Immovable Deity\r<br />3. In & Yo / Dualities of the Way\r<br />4. Oku / The Secrets\r<br />6. Myo / The Miraculous\r<br />7. Hara / The Center\r<br />(Didn&#39;t add 5, 8, and 9 because I didn&#39;t think they were fitting for combat, although they&#39;re great tracks.)\r<br />\r<br />Requires:\r<br />Skyrim.esp\r<br />Update.esp",
