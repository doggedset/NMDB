  "descriptionHtml": "[color=orange]Requires Hearthfire[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=4]Ankh&#39;s Food[/size]\r<br />[size=1][i]formerly[/i] Let There Be Butter[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Originally this was a request from someone who wanted more butter in the world, and after I did that I decided to go on and add all the food changes I wanted. There&#39;s no reason to update if all you wanted is butter, but if you want new and improved improvements, here they are.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]&#33;Features&#33;[/center]\r<br />v2.0\r<br />[list][*]The &#39;flora&#39; butter churns from Hearthfire are now crafting stations where you can make butter, eidar cheese, and goat cheese (including batch recipes). (Harvesting butter? Super lame.)Â \r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]13 extra butter churns are added near cows or farms in the world.[/*]\r<br />[*]Gather Seawater and boil it at the cookpot to create salt piles. (see readme for more instructions)\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Includes a [color=pink]portable cooking pot[/color]. (location in readme)\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Milk, goat&#39;s milk, salt, butter, and empty bottles have been added to various lists to make them more common.\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Includes new recipes for several vanilla foods that were uncraftable: Spiced Beef, Boiled Creme Treat, Honeynut Treat, and Long Taffy Treat. (Willing to do more if anyone points out foods that don&#39;t have recipes.)\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]&#33;Little Readme&#33;[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]Gathering Seawater requires a special bucket that will show up as a &#34;Weapon&#34; in your inventory. These buckets can be found beside most wells around the world. To gather seawater, equip the bucket while swimming, and it will take you to a crafting menu. You can craft seawater as long as you are swimming and have (vanilla) empty wine bottles in your inventory. (Dawnguard bottles do not work.) Lucky you, I don&#39;t know how to detect water type, so you can gather &#34;Seawater&#34; in rivers and lakes too. \r<br />----if you don&#39;t feel like searching for it, console &#39;help &#34;water bucket&#34; &#39; then player.additem [insert item ID] 1\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Since empty bottles are required for salt, I added them to several loot lists and I also put a barrel full of bottles in the lower part of the Riften dock (see picture.)\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]The portable cooking pot is sitting beside the produce stall in Whiterun, beside the barrels there. Use it the same way as the Water Bucket, equip it to be taken to a crafting menu.\r<br />----I know it&#39;s not really necessary with other craftable/buyable/movable furniture mods, but hey, it doesn&#39;t hurt anything to have it here and might be useful if you don&#39;t have those.\r<br />----I neglected to add either of those tools to any vendor lists, so console or finding them is how to get them.\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]About the Spiced Beef recipe... Hey, you have to look at who the only person to give you any in the game is :P I always felt there was something else going on there. It is Markarth after all.\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]",
