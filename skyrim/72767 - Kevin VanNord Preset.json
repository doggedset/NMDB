  "summary": "Ever wanted to travel the roads of Skyrim as Kevin VanNord, the greatest warrior to ever live? Well now you can with this preset&#33; Just load him up and begin the chicken slaughtering&#33; ",
  "descriptionHtml": "So, I was looking through the Nexus and the Steam Workshop and saw that there was a very lack of Kevin VanNord, specifically Kevin VanNord himself. So I rewatched some old Top 5 Skyrim Mods of the Week episodes and decided to recreate Kevin himself&#33; I think I got him down very well, almost perfect if I do say so myself. He may look different in your game than he does in the screenshots simply because I have mods which alters the males of Skyrim. I&#39;ll post them under the recommendation mods down below. Anyway, enjoy&#33; I hope everyone likes this preset&#33; :) \r<br />\r<br />How to Install:\r<br />1.) Unzip or Extract Archive\r<br />2.) Go to the (C:) drive on your computer and click it. Then click on Program Files (x86). (Note some computers my be set up differently.) \r<br />3.) Now go to your Skyrim Directory. (Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim)\r<br />4.) Now Click on the Data folder and go to the SKSE folder, then Plugins, then CharGen, then Presets.\r<br />5.) Finally drag the official file (.jslot) into your Presets&#39;s folder and then close everything. \r<br />6.) Start up Skyrim and then either begin a new came or press the &#34;~&#34; button and type &#34;showracemenu&#34;\r<br />7.) Then go to the Presets tab in the racemenu and hit F5 and click on &#34;Kevin_VanNord_Original&#34;.\r<br />8.) Now you&#39;re done&#33; The Preset should automatically change your character to Kevin VanNord. Now just rename him and enjoy&#33; :D\r<br />\r<br />Required Mods:\r<br />Racemenu: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?\r<br />Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE): http://skse.silverlock.org/ \r<br />\r<br />Recommended Mods: \r<br />SkySight Skins - Ultra HD 4K and 2K - Male Textures and Real Feet Meshes: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58443/?\r<br />Northborn Scars: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49279/?\r<br />Brows: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30411/?\r<br />Beards: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28363/?\r<br />Superior Lore-Friendly Hair - HD textures (This is pretty much for the NPC&#39;s since Kevin doesn&#39;t have much hair. :P ): http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36510/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />**Also if you want to use Kevin in your current game, but don&#39;t want to lose all your stats to the &#34;showracemenu&#34; command, here&#39;s an alternative. Lossless Race Menu gives you a spell which allows you to go into the racemenu and change your character, but not your stats. I highly recommend it&#33; :) \r<br />\r<br />Lossless Race Change: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33968/? ",
