  "summary": "Overpowered Necklace",
  "descriptionHtml": "This simple file will allow you to have a Hero from Sovngarde as a permanent follower. He/She will be by your side for as long as you are wearing the necklace. If they are defeated or lost, just simply unequip and then re-equip the necklace. \r\n\r\nThere are 3 bat files included and all you have to do is select either nord1, nord2,  or nord3... 3 being the strongest and 1 being the weakest.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nPut the txt files in the same location as your TESV launcher (steamapps/common/skyrim),  and that\\'s it. Run the game, bring up your console and type \\\"bat nord(1,2, or 3)... You\\'ll find the item in your inventory under apparel, simply equip and enjoy. It\\'ll just say, \\\"Shout cooldown reduced 20%\\\" don\\'t fret, that\\'s just a simple display error. Put it on and watch your hero appear.\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n\r\n-Followers can wear the necklace, and it will summon the hero, but the hero will not follow them. If there is a mod to fix that issue then feel free to let me know about that.\r\n\r\n-If you have a zombie or Dead thrall raised, while putting on the necklace, they will instantly die. Not a problem with the thrall, since you can just raise them again, but is a pain with a dread zombie, or lesser raise dead spell. Just be careful while in combat when using this. Just keep it equipped before combat and all will be fine.\r\n\r\n",
