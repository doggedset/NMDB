  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][b][color=#1e84cc][size=6]Jotun Tower[/size][/color][/b][/font]\r<br />\r<br />This tiny home is, admittedly, more for myself than anything. It adds a small tower on the [color=#00ff00]north-end of Riverwood[/color], at the walkway overlook. Not obstructive in the least, working quite smoothly with the vanilla town as well as my favorite JK&#39;s expansion. The key to the home and the note from the previous owner can be found just outside the doorway on the butter churner. \r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/Rdt9nQx.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Of course, regardless of the name, Jotun Tower is as simple as they come, 2 rooms; one above and below. It is a starter-home after all, ready for you when you come [color=#00ffff]straight from Helgen[/color]. \r<br />But there&#39;s so much to offer&#33;\r<br />The top floor has several handy storage areas, a double bed, a display case and desk w/throne. A large bookcase and unique decorative items&#33; The basement of the tower holds alchemy and enchanting crafting stations, a few weapon racks and a mannequin. And barrels for days. Truly, if anything, this tower has storage and class in every corner, as far as I could make it. It fits aesthetically in the Riverwood area, and certainly catches the eye without looking out of place. \r<br />\r<br />Thank you, and I hope you enjoy this one, whether on your current or a new game&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Requires:\r<br />-Skyrim, Update, Hearthfire.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Conflicts:[/color]\r<br />- Leaf Rest&#39;s patio area rests directly at the base of this home. That might be an issue.\r<br />\r<br />Resources procured from and Thanks to: \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48582/?]Cyrodiil Farmhouse Tileset\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62733]Lolicept Resources\r<br />[/url][/center]",
