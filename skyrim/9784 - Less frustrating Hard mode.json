  "descriptionHtml": "------------\r\nUPDATED: Added LFHM - Expert and LFHM -  SUPREME BEATDOWN! as per requested! See optional files for more info! Their damage scale changes are included in the .zip! :D\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis mod makes a couple changes to the difficulty damage multipliers, greatly reducing the frustration of Expert and Master difficulties while very slightly adjusting the ease of Novice/Apprentice difficulties. Adept difficulty remains the baseline 1:1 ratio and is unchanged. \r\n\r\nThe new multipliers are as follows:\r\n\r\nDamage Taken (Vanilla):\r\nNovice: x0.5\r\nApprentice: x0.75\r\nAdept: x1\r\nExpert: x1.5\r\nMaster: x2\r\n\r\nDamage Dealt (Vanilla):\r\nNovice: x2\r\nApprentice: x1.5\r\nAdept: x1\r\nExpert: x0.75\r\nMaster: x0.5\r\n\r\nDamage Taken (NEW):\r\nNovice: x0.5\r\nApprentice: x0.75\r\nAdept: x1\r\nExpert: x1\r\nMaster: x1\r\n\r\nDamage Dealt (NEW):\r\nNovice: x1.5\r\nApprentice: x1.25\r\nAdept: x1\r\nExpert: x0.75\r\nMaster: x0.5\r\n\r\nThe main focus is to reduce how easily NPCs can one- or two- hit kill the player on higher difficulties while keeping the lowered amounts of damage dealt by the player.\r\nI like epic battles where I actually have to use tactics and enemies can take more than one crack with a mace, but I dont like how quickly they can go awry with Vanilla settings (I get sick of having over half health and getting 1hk\\'d). But I do like a challenging lengthy fight. Hopefully there\\'s other people who feel the same way I do and will appreciate this lil adjustment :)\r\n\r\n Shouldn\\'t be any errors as the *ONLY* thing i did was change the gameplay setting strings, but if anyone has problems with this mod FIRST make sure that this one is to blame, then if it is let me know. As long as it\\'s the most recent/only adjustment mod you have for the setting it should pose no issue.\r\n\r\nAlso check out my other mods\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10184 Soft Leather Armor\r\nand\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10249 Convertible Archmage Robes",
