  "descriptionHtml": "As part of my planned mod, I wanted to be able to choose a really cool symbol and colours for a player&#39;s House. \r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t know enough [i]yet[/i] to make that mod, but Hoax2&#39;s Custom Sigils DIY allows you to apply a custom texture to shields and cloaks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />So I figured people might have some fun with these designs I made in the meantime. The sigils all have descriptions, but you could conceivably use them however you like since they don&#39;t change your faction or anything.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Future plans[/b]:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Add more options for items that can be marked, some clothing and shields\r<br />[*]Maybe more magic-related options\r<br />[*]Schemes organized with FOMOD installer\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b]Custom Custom Sigils[/b]:\r<br />\r<br />Really good requests may be an option, same as commissions depending on time.\r<br />\r<br />[center]Sigils by Rue\r<br />\r<br />Designed on various themes and concepts. Not directly tied to a faction, Divine, Daedra, or quest.\r<br />[/center][b]The Sun Rose[/b] --[i] The sun is life and brilliance[/i]\r<br />[b]The Tree of Arrows[/b] --[i] War does not bar you from flourishing[/i]\r<br />[b]The Broken Sword [/b]--[i] You will fight until the last[/i]\r<br />[b]The Broken Lance[/b] -- [i]You will fight until the last[/i]\r<br />[b]Dragonslayer[/b] -- [i]You cut down the greatest and most terrifying enemies[/i]\r<br />[b]Eaglefall [/b]-- [i]The Thalmor will topple and perish\r<br />[/i][b]Kai[/b] --[i] The ancient spirits are at play around us[/i]\r<br />[b]The Dragon on Water[/b] -- [i]You are adventurous and will travel the world[/i]\r<br />[b]The Serpent Devouring Its Tail [/b]-- [i]You see the eternal cycle of death and rebirth[/i]\r<br />[b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The Green Lion Eating the Sun[/b] --[i] Alchemist, you can transmute poison to cure and silver to gold[/i]\r<br />[b]Serana&#39;s Star[/b] --[i] You have sworn loyalty to Serana[/i]\r<br />[b]The Tree of Plenty [/b]-- [i]You protect and nourish those who rely upon you[/i]\r<br />[b]Jone and Jode [/b]--[i] The moons are your guides on long journeys[/i]\r<br />[b]Wolfcrusher[/b][i][b] [/b]-- You cut down beast and beast-men both\r<br />[/i][b]The Bonds of Earth and Sky [/b]-- [i]Your heart is strong enough to tie together the worlds[/i][i]\r<br />[/i][b]Pahmar[/b] --[i] [/i][i] You are fierce and count the Khajiit among your friends[/i]\r<br />[b]Triple Scroll[/b] --[i] You have come to fulfil the words of prophesy[/i]\r<br />[b]The Six Betrayals[/b] -[i]- You have committed many betrayals for Daedric power[/i]\r<br />[center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Mod-Related Sigils\r<br />\r<br />I like Wyrmstooth, Falskaar, Moonpath to Elsweyr, and Moon and Star a lot. \r<br />\r<br />Haven&#39;t played the Forsworn mod, and Solitude Regnant could be used with Become High King, which is discontinued. But if anyone should create a mod allowing me to support Elisif&#39;s claim without choosing the Imperial side, I might make more crests on theme.

Thirsk Hall doesn&#39;t define who your friends are, for example.\r<br />[/center][b]Wolf Over Bear[/b] -- [i]Solitude shall be victorious over Windhelm[/i]\r<br />[b]Bear Over Wolf[/b] -- [i]Windhelm shall be victorious over Solitude[/i]\r<br />[b]Stendarr&#39;s Folly Illuminated[/b] -[i]- The failure of Stendarr&#39;s Vigilants yields to the Dawnguard[/i]\r<br />[b]Stendarr&#39;s Folly Eclipsed [/b]--[i] The failure of Stendarr&#39;s Vigilants yields to the Vampires[/i]\r<br />[b]Batcatcher [/b]-- [i]The vampires know to fear the wrath of a greater predator than they[/i]\r<br />[b]Storm Broken [/b]-- [i]The Imperial cause is paramount and its victory is inevitable[/i]\r<br />[b]Talos Over the Tower [/b]-- [i]Talos will triumph over the petty proscriptions of the White-Gold Concordat[/i]\r<br />[b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The Knife and the Nightingale [/b]--[i] The Thieves are among your friends[/i]\r<br />[b]The Beating and Unbeating Hearts[/b] -- [i]You will spill any blood required or asked of you, Assassin[/i]\r<br />[b]The Eye of Magnus[/b] --[i] Great arcane powers are in your hands and you command the aether[/i]\r<br />[b]The Bard&#39;s Harp[/b] --[i] Your Muses guide you, your trade is song and story[/i]\r<br />[b]Thirsk Hall[/b] -- [i]You are well-travelled and have friends in Solstheim&#39;s hall[/i]\r<br />[b]Jorrvaskr Hall [/b]-- [i]You are well-travelled and have friends among the Companions[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]Quest-Related Sigils\r<br />\r<br />Not tied to a Divine, Daedra or faction. [/center]\r<br />[b]Nettlebane and New Life[/b] -- [i]You have faced great danger in the name of rebirth[/i]\r<br />[b]Moon and Moth[/b] --[i] The Elder Scrolls cast their shadow upon you[/i]\r<br />[b]Miraak Toppled[/b] -- [i]The ambitions of the dragon priests topple by your hand and end in ash[/i]\r<br />[b]The Pierced Briar[/b] -- [i]The Forsworn fear you, and you have slain their once and future king[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]Divine Sigils\r<br />\r<br />Do you play with a set patron among the Divines?
