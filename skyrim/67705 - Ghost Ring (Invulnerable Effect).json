  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]shbhkXO-jao[/youtube]A ring that gives wearer an invulnerable Same Same ghost/invulnerable effect. Practically TGM but only better. Works just like Alduin&#39;s Invulenrablity and Children Invulnerablity. Cannot be killed by console command. Confirmed. This is first and last final mod. This works just EXACTLY the same as player.setghost I can promise you. 1 only it doesn&#39;t use that command, it uses the effect script along with ring so you can equip and unequip it at anytime. Endorse or not I don&#39;t care just as long as you enjoy this. I created this mod because I notice when you have the setghost set to 1, all I mean ALL functions break down so you can&#39;t use Psijic Teleport, kill command, Arcane Forge, etc with this. Not Lore Friendly because it is MEANT to break the game rules. No Magicka, Health and Stamina will be depleted using this. Those are only the thing I know of. Video proof if you need the evidence of an actual working invulnerablity code.",
