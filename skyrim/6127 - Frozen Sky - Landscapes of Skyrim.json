Simply travelling across Skyrim has been some of the most enjoyable parts of the game. Bethesda really went above and beyond creating a living, breathing and beautiful world for us to explore. \r\n\r\nThe following is a video compilation of some of my favourite landscapes and places throughout Skyrim. If you don\\'t appreciate Skyrim\\'s beauty or music (and who doesn\\'t) you will probably find this boring. All clips were captured in-game by myself and edited in Final Cut Pro X. (I wasn\\'t getting the best FPS with FRAPS while filming so some of the clips are a little choppy). Hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n[b]Music from the Skyrim Original Game Soundtrack[/b]\r\n(If you enjoy the music, consider buying the album [url=http://www.directsong.com]DirectSong[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]\\\"The Dragonborn Comes\\\" by Malukah:[/b] [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z9TdDCWN7g]Malukah on YouTube[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Modifications Used:[/b]\r\nBoris Vorontsov\\'s ENBSeries: [url=http://enbdev.com/index_en.html]Download Here[/url]\r\n\\\"Confident\\\" A Realistic ENB Profile: [url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5253]Download from SkyrimNexus[/url]\r\n\r\nDownload the Video in 720p Quicktime format (Sorry didn\\'t have time to encode in another format)",
