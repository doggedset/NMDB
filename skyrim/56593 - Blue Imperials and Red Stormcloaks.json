  "descriptionHtml": "[b]You heard right.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]This mod turns the Stormcloaks red and the Imperials blue. This also makes Solitude&#39;s main color Blue to match the empire. It doesn&#39;t really make sense to have something blue (The Blue Palace) in a red city. All imperial uniforms have been altered, all banners of imperials and stormcloaks have been recolored, and stormcloak cuirass&#39; are now red.\r<br />\r<br />[/size]Note that some things have not been altered, such as flags placed on maps to tell which side has what points. Those flags are unchanged. If someone could tell me the name of this texture file, I can update this to V1.1",
