  "summary": "This mod extends the duration of Smithing & Enchanting potions to 720s",
  "descriptionHtml": "Smithing & Enchanting potions are few and far between in Skyrim, and it bothered me that they have a very short duration (30 & 60 seconds respectively), which is fine until you want to rename the item you just enchanted, or have forgotten to pick up enough ingots to forge your weapons or armor.\r\nI found myself countless times scrambling to smith or enchant everything I want in time, before the potion wore off, and reload again and again the last save to achieve what I wanted with my items.\r\nHence this mod. It will give you enough time to perform your smithing & enchanting chores.",
