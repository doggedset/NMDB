  "descriptionHtml": "**Decraft leather and metal armor! \r\nTurn unwanted various leather-based armors into leather scraps at any tanning rack. You recover leather scraps equal to the amount of leather pieces used to construct the item but you lose any scraps that went into making the item. \r\nExample: Leather Boots take two leather and two leather strips. When you decraft it, you get get back eight leather strips. The logic here is that the leather pieces are cut up into strips when extracted from the armor and any strips that were used are destroyed. The good news is that you can now create leather from strips! Five strips will make one piece of leather. \r\n\r\n\r\nTurn unwanted metal armor into ingots at any smelter. You recover ingots one for one on either the more plentiful or the rarer metal used to craft the item. Some items can be decrafted into either of their base parts. \r\n\r\n============================================================================== \r\nVERSION 1.3 \r\n=========== \r\n\r\n***DAWNGUARD REQUIRED*** \r\nGet DeCrafty Vanilla for basic Skyrim (no DLC support) \r\n\r\nNow includes recipes for decrafting Imperial armor, Stormcloak armor (including hold specific guard armor), and Thieve\\'s Guild armor. \r\n\r\nFixed a bug that was not allowing the player to craft Dragonbone/scale armor. This armor can only be crafted at the Sky Forge in Whiterun. \r\n\r\n============================================================================== \r\n============================================================================== \r\n\r\n***** PLEASE FAVORITE AND RATE IT IF YOU LOVE (OR HATE) IT ****** \r\n\r\n\r\n============================================================================== \r\nFull Features \r\n=========== \r\n\r\nIncludes recipes for decrafting the following armor types: \r\n\r\nBlades \r\nDaedric \r\nDraugr \r\nDwarven \r\nEbony \r\nElven \r\nForsworn \r\nFur \r\nGlass \r\nHide \r\nImperial \r\nIron \r\nLeather \r\nOrcish \r\nScaled \r\nSteel \r\nSteel Plate \r\nStorkcloak (and hold specific guard armor) \r\nThieve\\'s Guild \r\n\r\nWeapons: \r\nDaedric \r\nDwarven \r\nEbony \r\nElven \r\nGlass \r\nOrcish \r\nDraugr \r\nSteel \r\n\r\nChanges: \r\n\r\n**Dragonscale/bone armor &amp; weapons can only be crafted at the Sky Forge in Whiterun. I highly recommend using the following mods to enhance your experience: \r\n\r\nSkyforge Map Marker mod (Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=10173) Ideal for fast traveling directly to the Skyforge. Any mod that adds all of the crafting tables to the Skyforge area. Just search *Complete Skyforge* on Steam Workshop or Nexusmods. \r\n\r\n**Steel Plate Shield! \r\nThis is referenced as a recipe in the game files but doesn\\'t exist in the item database. Now it does! Currently, the only way to acquire it is to craft it. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Lockpicks! \r\nOne iron ingot makes five lockpicks. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Lighter pickaxes and woodcutter\\'s axes! \r\nPick and woodcutter\\'s axes now weigh 1/5th of their previous weight. Who wants to carry around 20 pounds of pick axe? I mean, I\\'m not the only person that dual weilds them while mining, am I? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n============================================================================== \r\nFuture Plans \r\n========== \r\n\r\nI\\'d like to add support for decrafting clutter items found in the game such as plates, tankards, and other sundry stuff, as well as expand into deconstructing unique weapons and armor into base building materials or even something else altogether. \r\n\r\n\r\n============================================================================== \r\nMiscellaneous Musings \r\n================== \r\n\r\nI\\'ve been toying with the idea of adding in dragonbone/scale weapons and armor, but I\\'m currently deciding against it because later in the game dragons are rather plentiful and it\\'s not worth trashing a weapon worth 3000 gold to recoup 3 ebony ingots. \r\n",
