Why, it\\'s a creature from American folklore that\\'s said to have the antlers of a deer and the body of a rabbit.\r\n\r\nBut what are they doing in Skyrim? Maybe they\\'re taxidermied zombies made by bored Necromancers, or maybe it\\'s a lesser-known servant of the Daedric Prince Hircine! You be the judge!\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\nInstall instructions: place the file in Data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\ambient\\\\hare\\\\character assets.",
