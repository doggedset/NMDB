Thanks to all our Beta Testers, that gave us feedback and helped at detecting bugs. Thanks to the moderators at The Nexus, that helped us clarifying if the mod could be uploaded there. They proved themselves to be quite reasonable. Thanks to everyone in general, that showed interest in having a rigged and animated penis. Thanks to all the Mods and Modders that served as an inspiration in taking the male mods, one step forward. And finally ofc, thanks to Bethesda (although they should have included this feature in the game xD)&#34; ",
