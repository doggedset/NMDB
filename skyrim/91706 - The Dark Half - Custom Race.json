And many people who know my true intentions and personality would call me 'evil' (yet I'm one of the sweetest, nicest people you'll ever meet).\n<br />\n<br />So, I get distracted a lot. This is one of those distractions.\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]HRbANL0ozrk[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />Just female for now, sorry. This is just for fun. I'll probably create a male counterpart once I start working on the male version of GCO.",
