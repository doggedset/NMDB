  "summary": "A small mod that aims to improve the lighting in Falmer Caves and Dungeons.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hey all, this is a work in progress, and will be updated gradually. Right now the only place affected is Shimmermist Cave & of course Shimmermist Grotto.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the mod is to improve the lighting in Falmer areas. I\\'ve included a before and after picture taken in the grotto to give an example of the difference.\r\n\r\nThe reason for making this mod is that a lot of areas in Falmer caves are too dark to see everything, which is fine and all, but if I use candlelight or nightvision it becomes painfully bright because of all the glow and mist effects etc. This is especially annoying, as it means I can\\'t really use candlelight or nightvision in any Falmer area without nearly blinding myself, but I have to if I want to make sure I\\'ve found everything worth looting and avoid traps/pitfalls/etc.\r\n\r\nIf any more experienced modders have any advice on ways to further improve the mod, I\\'d be very grateful.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn\\'t cause any problems as I\\'ve not deleted anything or edited any scripts, nor will I.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUpdate 0.02 07/12/12\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI think I\\'m done with both Shimmermist areas now. Again, be sure to let me know of any improvements you feel I can/should make.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUpdate 0.01 07/12/12\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI\\'ve begun work on Shimmermist Cave & Shimmermist Grotto, please let me know if there\\'s any way to improve it.",
