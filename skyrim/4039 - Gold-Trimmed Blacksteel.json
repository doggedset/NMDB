  "descriptionHtml": "[Center][color=Yellow]Welcome to the release of my Darkness series wich, in this release, contains the Gold-Trimmed  BlackSteel armor.\r\n\r\nThis mod affects ALL armor pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso make sure to endorse to get updates and further textures of my Dark works :D\r\n\r\nFor the people who don\\'t like it: I\\'ve put alot of time and work into these textures and even if you find them ugly as hell, please don\\'t start flaming. There are people who like my mods alot.\r\nSo instead of flaming and trolling, please, PLEASE, tell me how you would find it better!\r\nFlame doesn\\'t help me. It simply destroys the mod itself. But good criticism is allowed and even wished. So don\\'t hesitate and tell me how you would actually like it!\r\n\r\nFor suggestions in terms of new armor/weapon textures:\r\n\r\n__--READ--__\r\n\r\nI DO accept requests aslong as it is a texture mod. I don\\'t do meshes.. obiously because i started modding some days ago..\r\n\r\nBut I\\'m still happy to get messages to mod some textures. Keep me busy people!\r\n___________ \r\n\r\n\r\nIF YOU *DO* LIKE THIS MOD:\r\nEndorse it! Not enough people do, largely due to the requisite elapsed time for an endorsement. It adds an element of memory and effort that many users simply do not commit to. And I can understand that - I\\'m not blaming you, and you know who you are. I used to be the same way and, sometimes, to my great shame, I still am.\r\nI\\'m told if you use the download manager it\\'ll give you reminders. That sounds super-great to me!\r\nAlso submit pictures of your character wearing my retexture! I love seeing stuff like this!\r\n\r\n#Installation\r\n\r\n1.) Download\r\n2.) Extract to Skyrim/data\r\n3.) ?????\r\n4.) PROFIT!\r\n\r\n#Deinstallation\r\n\r\n1.) Search up your skyrim/data/textures folder\r\n2.) delete the folder wich you want to delete\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: delete --> Skyrim/data/textures/armor/daedric\r\n\r\nThis will delete all your steel mods in terms of textures.\r\n________\r\nCopyright\r\n\r\n**Do not repost, rehost, remix, or include this work in another mod without permission.**\r\nDo not be afraid to ask! Seriously. Feel free!\r\n________\r\nMod history:\r\n- Release v1.0 : 18.12.2011[/color][/center]",
