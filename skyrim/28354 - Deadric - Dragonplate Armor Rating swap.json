  "descriptionHtml": "After the Release of Skyrim, Akatosh was angry because the Armor from the bones of his creatures - the Dragons - wasn\\'t the best in the game. He suspected that the Daedra had their hands in the game and manipulated the development. So he sent me a command in my dream: \\\"You shall produce a mod to make the Dragonbone Armor stronger than the Armor of these Daedric fools!\\\" And so i followed his order and made this mod.\r\n\r\nThis mod swaps the Armor Rating of the Daedric and the Dragonplate Armor\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY:\r\nIs not compatible with any mod changing the Daedric nor the Dragonplate Armor.\r\n(texture mods are ok)\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nChanges the unplayable Dremora Armor too\r\n\r\nI\\'m NOT responsible for any harm or damage caused by hunting Dragons.\r\n\r\n*sorry for my bad english, it\\'s not my native language* \r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n- Bethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit\r\n",
