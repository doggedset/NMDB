  "descriptionHtml": "These meshes and textures were originally created by Moses (aka Chief-01) for Oblivion, but never released.  To which I (with a LOT of help from Maniczombie\\'s tutorial) converted for Skyrim... with permission, of course.  Basically, this just allows you to craft a Steel Master Sword, a Skyforge Steel Master Sword, or, if you\\'re so inclined, a dark ebony version of the Master Sword.  These work quite well, but there is a couple of slight flaws.  If you drop the sword and pick it up again, when you mount it on a weapon plaque or rack, it will be off center.  Also, since the blood effect mesh on the sword is the same mesh of the sword itself, the blood will show up on the hilt as well as the blade, rather than just on the blade of the vanilla swords.  (On the other hand, maybe that\\'s not a flaw.  Realistically, that does make sense.)  Any help in fixing that would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nWith any luck, I\\'d like this to be the start of a new mod that I am helping to plan... and hopefully execute.  Those of you who have played my tweaked version of the Roadstroker\\'s Zelda Remake and LordFrostcraig\\'s Addon on Oblivion ought to remember the story I created to merge the Zelda lore with the Elder Scrolls lore.\r\n\r\nNow, I would like to continue that story into Skyrim.\r\n\r\nBut for now, enjoy.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to Moses for allowing me to post this.  [url=http://chief-01.deviantart.com/art/LoZ-Model-Texture-Resources-Some-are-incomplete-311134061]See the original mod here.[/url]\r\n\r\nYou, too, Maniczombie.  Your instructions were a lot of help.  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2158]Go here for instructions.[/url]\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  After hours of painstaking work on Nifskope, I removed the hilt from the blood effect mesh.  So blood will no longer show up on the hilt.  However, if you prefer looking at lots of blood on your sword, I made these new nif files optional files.\r\n\r\n2nd UPDATE:  As you can see from the pics, I managed to convert Moses\\' Hylian Shield mesh.  However, he never made a texture for it, and I can\\'t texture worth anything.  If anyone would like to volunteer to help, please do.\r\n\r\nLatest Update:  Added the textured Hylian Shield.  Texture by JKalenad.  (That mod is [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34718]here[/url].)  It uses the \\\"Fancy Clean\\\" texture.  You can craft a steel Hylian Shield or an elven one.  Both are temperable and look the same, but the elven shield is lighter and stronger.\r\n\r\nAND... I added a little easter egg.  I said that I have bigger plans for this mod, so now you can see a small part of it.  Just hit the tilde key and type \\\"player.additem xx007E8D 1\\\"",
