Added PDF and 300-DPI PNG versions 2013-05-18.\r\n\r\nAdded \\\"nude version\\\" 300-DPI PNG 2013-05-29 for Bergzore.  This version is stripped-down and sized to be able to be cut up and placed in the Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Terrain folder for direct use as the world map, but my initial test shows additional work is needed to turn off the map\\'s addition of landscape meshes that aren\\'t part of the underlying terrain, and the contour lines themselves weren\\'t showing up very well.\r\n\r\nRemoved link to print on 2013-05-30.",
