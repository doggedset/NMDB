This is my first player home ever created for any game so constructive criticism is welcome. I play a evil character like many of you surely would too and found little in the housing department to accommodate such a player.\r\nObviously anyone can use this home but it was aimed and themed to of course accommodate a evil themed character. \r\n\r\nI have painstaking fiddled around with the ai packages for the torture victims but to no result got them to stay in there shackles when they were hit with a weapon fist etc. So what use would they be to the player and what would they get out of killing them? To reward the player for keeping them or killing them is basically a win win situation.\r\n\r\nIt is up to you who you kill for the weapon racks behind them or who to leave hanging on the wall, they are all set in there underwear and the females are set to 55 80 and 0 body weight for you players with nude mods out there. Anyway this is the perfect home for any thief vampire or assassin! /sadist hahha\r\n\r\nsorry for the wall of text...haha\r\n\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>FEATURES<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\r\n\r\n4 Slaves to torture!\r\n\r\nCOMPLETELY NAVMESHED!\r\n\r\nCoffin Bed(great for vampire characters!)\r\n\r\n7 Trap doors that will take you to Solitude.WindHelm**Whiterun**Riften**Markarth**Dawnstar Dark brotherhood Sanctuary**Falkreath Dark BrotherHood Sanctuary**\r\n\r\n16 weapon racks!\r\n\r\nFollower and Wife friendly!\r\n\r\nTons of clutter!\r\n\r\n\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>REQUIREMENTS<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\r\nSkyrim.esm\r\nUpdate.esm\r\n\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>INSTALLATION<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\r\n\r\nDrag or copy and paste BoogyManLair.esm and VFU_home.esp into your date folder in your skyrim directory.
