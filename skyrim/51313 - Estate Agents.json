This will add a &#34;Houses Owned&#34; in the stats menu. \r<br />\r<br />If you are looking for some nice Role Playing house mods then check out [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/9096871/?tb=mods&pUp=1]Svadas&#39; Role Playing Abodes[/url]\r<br />*UPDATE*\r<br />If you are a fan of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33939/?]Elysium Estate[/url] and would a like a Deed to that property try my new mod out \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51865/?]Estate Agents -Elysium Estate[/url]\r<br />\r<br />I am a huge fan of Mod Houses, Estates, Castles etc. but with most of these, you can not purchase.\r<br />I often play as poor peasant working their way to buying a nice property, and when I find that perfect house mod, most often there is no way of buying them just walk in the door and yours, and for me this feels a bit like cheating. So this way you can &#34;buy&#34; the abode. \r<br />\r<br />So once you have found that perfect &#34;free&#34; house mod, go to any of the General Goods merchants in any of the major cities, and buy an appropriate deed for that property. There are 3 different types of deeds, Noble, Upper, Common. It is up to you on what you want to spend, want to buy a castle with a Commoner Deed sure, I don&#39;t mind it&#39;s your playthru. \r<br />\r<br />This mod has no requirements except for the most updated game 1.9.32.0 (update.esm must be enabled)\r<br />\r<br />This mod makes no changes to game except for adding 3 different types of deeds (letters) to major city General Goods vendors. . Cleaned with TES5edit.\r<br />\r<br />Here is a breakdown of the costs:\r<br />\r<br />Base Prices (these prices are only available if you have all speech perks and investments)\r<br />\r<br />Commoner - 2,000\r<br />\r<br />Upper Class 5,000\r<br />\r<br />Noble 10,000\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Unmodded Game \r<br />\r<br />Commoner Property with Vanilla Level 1 character 5,040 \r<br />\r<br />Upper Class Property with Vanilla Level 1 Character 15,200\r<br />\r<br />Noble Property with Vanilla Level 1 Character 30,400\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Modded Game with all DLC&#39;s (prices may vary depending on what type of mods you have enabled)\r<br />\r<br />Commoner Property with all DLC&#39;s and Requiem - Hard Times Level 1 character 3,800 \r<br />\r<br />Upper Class Property with all DLC&#39;s and Requiem - Hard Times Level 1 Character 19,000\r<br />\r<br />Noble Property with all DLC&#39;s and Requiem - Hard Times Level 1 Character 38,000\r<br />\r<br />So depending on your level and speech perk level (or mod) the prices will reduce as you level up.\r<br />\r<br />*Tip - if prices are are too high for you try using spell books, rings, potions, amulets etc. that increase speech level just before you buy. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />FAQ\r<br />*user Oxytwist, asked me some great questions, so I am using their questions as my F.A.Q\r<br />\r<br />Hey all of your questions are great.\r<br />\r<br />Ok let me answer them in the same order you asked. \r<br />\r<br />Q: \r<br />&#34;Say I see the Asteria the famous ship mod.\r<br />Laying in the water.\r<br />Where can I buy the deed. The Asteria get&#39;s a buy sign I have to click on and pay the money?&#34;\r<br />\r<br />A:\r<br />You can buy a Noble, Upper, and Common Property Deeds, from ANY General Goods merchant (Vanilla Only) they have a bout 5 of each property notes so a total of 15 per merchant. No sign to click to buy. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Q:\r<br />&#34;The door / way to the ship is closed to that I don&#39;t get in and take it anyway? Or have I open it now with the key I get with the deed?&#34;\r<br />\r<br />A:\r<br />No Keys, other than what the original mod author of the House/Property provided. Most mod houses are free but I did not want change/edit the mod authors original idea. I made this because there is so much money to be made in Skyrim, and I feel like I have earned the house more if I &#34;buy&#34; it. This more about immersion. So even if the house is free you have a Note that &#34;says&#34; you own it.\r<br />\r<br />Q:\r<br />And if I don&#39;t like the house, can I sell the house back? To whom?\r<br />\r<br />A:\r<br />Yes, you can sell it back to the same General Goods Merchant you bought it from, or any merchant who buys notes, and books; for less of course depending on your Speech Perk. (even if you uninstall the house mod) \r<br />\r<br />Q:\r<br />And what about other houses. The people go away after I bought the deed? Isn&#39;t it quest breaking?\r<br />And the Items do they get my ownership after I have the deed?\r<br />Or I am still a thief while I have bought the deed.\r<br />\r<br />A:\r<br />Ok this answer will be trickier. First off my mod makes no changes to the game AT ALL, it just allows you to by a note that says you own a Noble, Upper, or Common property, these notes are NOT named for any particular property, It&#39;s just a NOTE. So even if you buy a house in Whiterun, if someone still lives in it, they might get mad. If you kill a Quest NPC for their house it might cause issues, but there are ways around this (see below) \r<br />\r<br />For example: Some mods make it so even some essential NPC&#39;s can die (Dawngaurd does this with Vampire attacks) Occasionally you will run across a named NPC who has been killed, and they have their house key on them, you can use this to open their house, but it&#39;s contents will still have the stolen tag on them. (you can use console command: SETOWNERSHIP to remove the stolen flag)\r<br />\r<br />There WAS a great mod called Owned, that allowed you take ownership of any contents of a dead NPC&#39;s property i.e. their named house/store contents, but it seems to be gone from Nexus , I may try and contact the original mod and see if I can upload it it myself (I still have a copy).\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=230091619]Estate Agents on Steam[/url]",
