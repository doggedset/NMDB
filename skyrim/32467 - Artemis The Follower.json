  "summary": "Adds a fully functioning Child \\'Apprentice\\' follower to the game who fights properly and has several sets of craftable armour.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This Mod was created after i became frustrated trying to find a Mod to allow me to have an apprentice follow me, children in the game were always cowardly and ran.\r\nArtemis uses the standard voice for a male child, so when not following you will sound like a normal child. Due to a lack of follower dialogue, Artemis wont speak much when following you, but he will speak during battle.\r\nMod works very well using UFO mod, i recommend it.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuest will begin when a courier delivers a message to you from Constance Michel.\r\n\r\nMod Includes.\r\nA small quest to rescue Artemis\r\nA small dungeon to explore.\r\nArtemis The Follower, a ranged combat light armour using male nord child.\r\n3 Sets of craftable childrens armour, Elven, Glass and Dragonscale\r\n3 lines of horrible voice acting to endure so the quest makes sense --- These are once off lines for the quest line, his regular voice is that of a standard male child in Skyrim.\r\n\r\n**********************************************************\r\n - Added a version of the mod where Artemis\\' name was changed to Aenar, for those who either considered Artemis non lore friendly or didn\\'t like it.",
