  "descriptionHtml": "[THIS MOD IS STILL A BETA]\r<br />\r<br />[UPCOMING PATCH INFORMATION] to whom it may concern :)\r<br />- Releasing constant patches for the first few days was fun, but the next one will probably take a few more days as I&#39;ll try to clean my mod up a bit.\r<br />- Next patch will add at least 3 more factions in total (including another custom one I&#39;ve been &#34;toying&#34; with)\r<br />- The next patch *should* completely balance the toys a bit better so that each small scale battle can be as epic as possible (without certain units taking forever to die)\r<br />- Should also include some different and more interesting classes for current sections.\r<br />- School&#39;s started in earnest now so it may be a few days before I patch again, but it should do a lot more than the previous ones&#33;\r<br />- And hopefully two different versions, one where the toys attack every living thing in sight, and one where they behave like followers almost and only attack if the player is attacked or it&#39;s an aggressive enemy like bandits. (or maybe even a spell that toggles both styles if i can figure out how to script things better) \r<br />\r<br />[INTRODUCTION]\r<br />\r<br />Recently i stumbled across two toy soldier mods.\r<br />\r<br />Aenaran&#34;s : http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16708/?\r<br />\r<br />and\r<br />\r<br />Colloseusx&#39;s : http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12476/?\r<br />\r<br />Both of them were really mods that were just reallly entertaining to mess around with. There something viscerally satisfying about looking over the carnage of a pocket sized epic battle. Sending hordes of cute little miniature imperials/stormcloaks/LOTR based soldiers was just amazingly fun for me. Sadly, both mods have been dead for over a year, but Aenaran had mentioned his intentions to add on expansion factions from Dawnguard and Dragonborn. Since he never added t hem, I decided to try learning how to use the creation kit and papyrus to pick up where he left off. After I got everything sorted it was as fun (for me) as I&#39;d hoped it would be, sending a broader and more varied array of toy soldiers to do battle. Anyways, I&#39;m still messing around with it in my spare time and I&#39;m about 90% done with Imperial and Stormcloak factions. About 40%-60% with a few others that I&#39;m looking forward to trying out. I thought I&#39;d upload it here to see if anyone else was interested&#33; If you find something that&#39;s buggy, please let me know, this mods running perfectly (more or less) for me at the moment&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />UPDATES:\r<br />\r<br />1/17/2014\r<br />\r<br />-Added Snow Elf faction. All Snow Elf units should be faster than other factions in both attack and movement speed, but have a bit less health.\r<br />\r<br />1/16/2014\r<br />\r<br />- Added custom Ancient Nords faction, based off of what I think Ysgramor&#39;s Original 500 companions would have looked like (might be a wee bit overpowerd at the moment)\r<br />- Added basic Stormcloak Rebellion faction (spellname: Toys - Stormcloak Rebellion)\r<br />- Added basic Imperial Legion faction (spellname: Toys - Imperial Legion)\r<br />- ADDED SPELL TOMES AND SPELL TOME CHEST, it&#39;s located between Dragonsreach and the statues of Ysgramor. It&#39;s position should be either the first or second picture under this file&#39;s images\r<br />\r<br />1/15/2014\r<br />- Added Riekling Faction (spellname: Toys - Rieklings\r<br />- Added House Redoran Faction (spellname: Toys - HouseRedoran &lt;---- or something close to it&#33;)\r<br />- I&#39;m pretty sure I fixed the bug with the gargoyles\r<br />- Rebalanced all the units so that they fight and die a lot faster and more decisively\r<br />\r<br />[STARTING FEATURES]\r<br />\r<br />- I&#39;ve fully implemented the dawnguard, vampire, riekling, and house redoran factions\r<br />- Each faction (except for the rieklings atm) have 5 to 7 different unit types, ranging from cannon fodder soldiers/creatures to casters to bosses\r<br />- Each faction is summoned by a spell that allows you to pick what type and how many of a unit you&#39;d like to spawn\r<br />\r<br />[CURRENT FACTIONS] -

Other than that, everything else work pretty well atm&#33; If you find something that&#39;s not with the gargoyles, please let me know so i can fix it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[REQUIREMENTS]\r<br />\r<br />-Dawnguard and Dragonborn, and nothing else. I didn&#39;t use SKSE\r<br />\r<br />[COMPATIBILITY]\r<br />\r<br />- Almost everything spawned and all of the items used are stand alone. I think there might be one or two of the creature spawns that still have ties to original game files. If you use mods that affect creature stats or mess with the combat AI, the soldiers from my mod might act a little weird, but it should definitely not be crashing you to desktop or anything even remotely that serious. Please tell me if it does&#33; Personally, I&#39;d recommend you download 2 mods to help.\r<br />\r<br />Skytweak : http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33395/?\r<br />- an extremely compatible mod that you can use to set all NPC&#39;s &#34;chance to avoid damage&#34; which is code for &#34;chance for 20 melee toy soldiers to run away from 3 ranged soldiers instead of fighting charging them like men&#34; to 0, as well as a few other tweaks you might find useful in general.\r<br />\r<br />Enemy AI Overhaul:  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40491/?\r<br />- pretty neat AI buff for NPCs, I like this mod way better than ASIS or the bigger combat mods like duel and deadly combat. It should also help smooth out the Toys&#39; AI\r<br />\r<br />[USING THE MOD IN GAME]\r<br />\r<br />- currently I haven&#39;t added spell tomes to learn the spells I&#39;ve created since I just got them working - well. The only way to get the spells at the moment is through the console.\r<br />\r<br />- ALL SPELLS FOLLOW THE NOMENCLATURE &#34;Toys - (faction the spell spawns),&#34; just like Aenaran&#39;s mod did\r<br />\r<br />- type the command &#34;help toys 4&#34; and add the spells titled &#34;Toys - Dawnguard&#34; and &#34;Toys - Vampires.&#34; the other spells that pop up probably wont work since they were the ones I used to test the spawning script. Just cast the corresponding spell for the faction you&#39;d like to spawn and follow the directions&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[INSTALLATION]\r<br />\r<br />- im pretty sure it&#39;s compatible with NMM now\r<br />\r<br />- for manual, just drop the extracted files into your data folder",
