Update Coming Around The 31st Of March (Relative to English time) And I Will Be fixing all problems and concerns you have !!!\r\n\r\n       [b]An Immersive Medical Mod for Skyrim[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Overview[/b]\r\n\r\nHave you every downed a healing potion or used a spell and thought \\\"Why do the Nords hate magic yet like potions and restoration magic.\\\" Or \\\"surely at this day and age the use of medical herbs would be more popular around the land of Skyrim.\\\" Maybe you have said \\\"Why are soldiers the only ones who use bandages.\\\"\r\n\r\nIf any of these have ever passed your thoughts then like me, you are disappointed at the lack of alternative ways to heal yourself. That is why I opened up the creation kit and added these brand new bandage recipes to the tanning rack.\r\n\r\n[b]Short Overview[/b]\r\n\r\nDunlewd deis mud!\r\n\r\nGet new healy things!\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\n\r\n    [b]MANUAL[/b] Not Recommended\r\n1. Download manually\r\n2. Unpack with an archive extractor.\r\n3. Drag \\\"meshes\\\" into the \\\"Data\\\" folder in your Skyrim game files.\r\n4. Launch Skyrim\r\n5. If there is no crash on start-up or game load then you have\r\ninstalled it correctly. If not then you have done something\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n[b]OR[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Nexus Mod Manager[/b] Recommended\r\n1. Download with Nexus Mod Manager\r\n2. Once the download has finished click the install button.\r\n3. Once the successful installation message pops up, close\r\nMod Manager and launch Skyrim.
