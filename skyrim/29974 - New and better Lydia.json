  "descriptionHtml": "There are a lot of people who like Lydia, marry her and so on... but in my opinion she is not a follower for life. Now she has a new look (hairs, lips etc.), she fights with an skyforge steel sword, an nord hero bow and nord hero arrows, and she wears the iron plate armor. She\\\\\\'s a little bit stronger and she can\\'t die.\r\n\r\nplease comment.\r\nAnd: if you think it\\'s a good mod then ENDORSE IT.",
