  "descriptionHtml": "This mod isn\\'t big or anything, it creates a trap door in the Sleeping Giant Tavern that leads directly to the Editor Testing Hall! If you get tired of using the console to get there, this mod is for you.\r\n\r\nI made an Oblivion version as well, and that\\'s what inspired me to make this one. The Testing Hall IS cheating, but everyone gets bored after a while!\r\n\r\nI just uploaded V1.2 that adds an experimental reset feature; after taking some of the items in the Testing Hall, it will reset all of the containers and items after a certain period of time, (10-30 in-game days) i\\'m not completely sure if it works 100%, but I hope it helps!\r\n(If you experiment around and notice it doesn\\'t work for you, please let me know so I can fix it!)\r\n\r\nComment and give kudos if you like it, and have fun!\r\n\r\njonbravo2",
