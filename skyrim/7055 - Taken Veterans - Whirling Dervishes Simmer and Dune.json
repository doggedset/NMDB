  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"Veterans\\\" are pre-built characters, skilled and equipped in tune with the limitations of their experience. The entire game is unexplored, and adapted to your new level--allowing you to try out advanced play-styles and quest-lines without the hours of involved preliminaries.\r\n\r\nSimmer the Female Whirling Dervish,\r\nor Dune the Male Whirling Dervish\r\n\r\nThe Whirling Dervish is a dual-scimitar swinging master of the mirage. Top tier Illusion magic keeps the dervish in full control of any encounter, although it can be hard to believe this dangerous flurry of edges and points is at all under control. Sneaky ambushes with devastating dual-weapons and plenty of Stamina for follow up power-attacks makes mincemeat out of all comers. Light Armor and Restoration magic keep the dervish spinning long into the desert nights.\r\n\r\nLevel 30 Whirling Dervish\r\n29 Unallocated Perk Points\r\n210 Magicka (+50 Highborn Power)\r\n170 Health\r\n210 Stamina\r\n\r\nIllusion 100\r\nLight Armor, One-Handed 75\r\nSneak, Speech, Restoration 50\r\nConjuration, Archery 20\r\nHeavy Armor, Block, Alchemy, Smithing, Destruction, Pickpocket, Two-Handed, Lockpicking, Enchanting, Alteration  15\r\n\r\n1*(100*101/2) + 2*(75*76/2) + 3*(50*51/2)+ 2*(20*21/2) + 10*(15*16/2)\r\n= 16,195 [url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Total Experience Spent In Skills[/url]\r\n\r\nSpells:\r\n\tMuffle, Frenzy, Rally, Invisibility, Pacify, Rout, Hysteria, Call to Arms, Harmony, Mayhem\r\n\tBound Sword, Conjure Flame Atronach, Bound Bow\r\n\tSteadfast Ward, Close Wounds, Heal Other, Repel Lesser Undead, Turn Undead, Grand Healing\r\n\r\nShouts:\r\n\tDisarm\t(Zun Haal Viik)\r\n\tSlow Time (Tiid Klo Ul)\r\n\t\r\nPowers:\r\n\tHighborn (+50 Magicka & Daily Fast Regen)\r\n\tProwler\\'s Profit (Find more jewels)\r\n\r\nGear:\t\r\n\tGlass Helmet of Eminent Restoration\t000d53d7\r\n\tGlass Armor of Eminent Illusion\t0010cfa3\r\n\tGlass Gauntlets of Major Wielding\t000d53af\r\n\tGlass Boots of Major Stamina\t0010df89\t\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nInstallation and Use:\r\nUnzip the saved game in the download to your .../My Games/Skyrim/Saves folder, then load it in Skyrim.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1.0 Lookin\\' good.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhenever a character earns a rank, r, in a skill they gain r experience. So when a character has 0 in all skills they have zero experience, and when they have 100 in all skills, at level 81.5, they have 90,900 experience. A level 30 character should have about 15,865 total experience summed from their skills.\r\n\r\nTaken Veterans should look good with any texture or mesh mods you may use, if any. The mods used in the screenshots include:\r\nFace Textures (Female): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3563]Coverwomen[/url]\r\nFace Textures (Male): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=26]Detailed Faces[/url]\r\n\r\nLook in the discussions area for the batch commands allowing you to make a veteran out of a character you\\'ve created yourself!\r\n\r\nMore Info:\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimExp]Experience Table[/url]\r\n[url=http://bit.ly/SkyrimCharBatch]Tips on making your own veterans[/url]\r\n\r\nDrop a Taken Veteran save game in your Saves folder and load it up.
