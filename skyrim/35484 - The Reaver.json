About the mod:[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]\\\"The dreadful cog known as The Reaver have been sighted not far from the northern shores of Skyrim. Its crew, commanded by the brutish chieftain Sigurd Snake Eye, is known to be raiding coastlands and quickly disappear thereafter. Treasures awaits, probably hidden, within the ship for the adventurer foolish, or brave, enough to cross blade with these corsairs...\\\"[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod offers two entirely new locations to be found in the Sea of Ghosts, north-east of Winterhold. \\'The Reaver\\' and \\'Landing Site\\'. The idea of this mod is to give you a lore friendly and simple player home.\r\nAfter clearing the ship from hostiles, it may serve as a player home if you wish, and is therefore designed as such.\r\nI have tried to keep this mod as lore friendly as possible. I have therefore not included things that might seem improbable to be found inside a rough plunderers ship.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[b]2. Location:[/b]\r\nThe Reaver is located in the Sea of Ghosts, north-east of Winterhold. Check the map-images if you want the exact position. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[b]3. Inside The Reaver:[/b]\r\n\r\nCrafting:\r\n- An Anvil\r\n- A Grindstone\r\n- A Workbench\r\n- A Tanning Rack\r\n- A Chopping Block\r\n- An Alchemy Table\r\n-A Cooking pot\r\n\r\n-A Smelter  (can be found at the \\'Landing Site\\' not far from The Reaver)\r\n\r\n[b]4. Other:[/b]\r\n\r\n-Three mannequins\r\n- Weapon/Shield Plaques\r\n- Weapon Racks\r\n-A Talos Shrine\r\n-A followers abode\r\n-Lots of storing space in a variety of containers\r\n-A slave pit (Would like some help to make it possible to free them, send me a PM if you want to help!)\r\n-A bookshelf\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n[b]5. Q & A:[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Q:[/b] I got CTD from this mod!\r\n[b]A:[/b] Probably a conflict with another mod altering the navmesh in the vicinity of The Reaver and/or the landing site. (See Incompatibility for details)\r\n\r\n[b]Q:[/b] Can my spouse live here?\r\n[b]A:[/b] I recommend the mod:  Spouses can live anywhere by Emma http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11370\r\n\r\n[b]Q:[/b] What future plans do you have for this mod?\r\n[b]A:[/b] At the moment I will wait for feedback and correct glitches/bugs and fix them. Meanwhile, I appreciate ideas/suggestions for improvement. Also if there is a scripting/quest ace around, who is willing to improve this mod by creating some quests, or maybe make it possible to free the slaves aboard the ship... send me a PM!\r\n\r\n---\r\n[b]6.

Incompatibility:[/b]\r\nMods that alter the navmesh in the area of x,y pos: 40, 25. 40, 26. 40, 27. 40,28. 40, 29. 40, 30. 40, 31. I have put several hours by improving the original navmesh in these areas, as it was inadequate and caused weird AI behaviour. \r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n[b]8.
