  "descriptionHtml": "Poor Dovahkiin&#33; Between Imperial soldiers, Stormcloaks, Dragons, Thalmor, Draugr and so many other stressors, it&#39;s no wonder the healer told him he has high blood pressure. And then he tells him to lay off the salt.\r<br />But that means no more Horker Loaf&#33; NOOOO&#33;\r<br />\r<br />A Dash of Flavor seeks to replace the salt pile used in so many recipes with a blend of herbs and spices. They&#39;re not a secret, either. At any cooking pot, blend a garlic, lavender, frost mirram, and dried elves ear and you&#39;ll get 10 dashes of Herbs and Spices. This ingredient has replaced salt piles in several original recipes:\r<br />\r<br />Cooked Meats: Beef, Chicken, Goat, Horker, Horse, Mammoth, Pheasant, Rabbit, Salmon, and Venison\r<br />Apple Cabbage Stew\r<br />Beef Stew (Also replaces Garlic with Potato)\r<br />Horker Stew (Replaces Garlic and Lavender)\r<br />Venison Stew\r<br />Tomato Soup (Also eliminates Garlic)\r<br />Cabbage Potato Soup\r<br />\r<br />Hearthfires:\r<br />Potato Soup\r<br />Apple Pie\r<br />Chicken Dumplings\r<br />\r<br />Dragonborn:\r<br />Cabbage Stew\r<br />\r<br />This mod has an installer that will let you pick the mod that is right for you, whether you have Hearthfires, Dragonborn, or both.\r<br />Future plans: Sale by vendors, better model for Herbs and Spices\r<br />This is a simple mod and my first published one. Feel free to critique or offer advice.\r<br />Thanks to blasphemyblack and his mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29751]Culinary Blasphemy[/url] for the inspiration.",
