I also wanted to challenge myself a bit by making the jaw height larger than the jaw width--its something different compared to my other female facemorphs. I think it turned out pretty well overall. =) Surprisingly, she\\'s quickly became my favorite follower asides Mjoll because of her dialogue alone. xD\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\nUse NMM or extract the files into the skyrim root folder manually. Make sure that the .esp is below mods that affect followers such as UFO\r\n\r\n[b]Uninstallation[/b]\r\nUse NMM or delete all of the files manually. If you are doing it manually makes sure to take out the .TARGA, .dds, and the .NIF files with the number [size=3] 00019959 [/size] located at\r\nskyrim/Data/textures/actors/FaceGenData/FaceTint/Skyrim.esm and\r\nskyrim/Data/meshes/actors/FaceGenData/FaceGeom/Skyrim.esm\r\n\r\n[size=4]Mods Used (none of them required)[/size] list corrected by [url= http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2070732] fileosoft[/url] (BIG thank you to [s]her[/s]HIM)\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4869] *Covereyes look 4[/url] (for the eyelashes)\r\n[*][url= http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9249]*Improved Eyes Skyrim[/url] (for the actual eye texture) \r\n[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16147]*Improved Freckles Skyrim[/url]\r\n[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6709]Dimonized Unp [/url],\r\n [*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6554]*Navetsea\\'s Skin and Face Retextures[/url] (also downloaded the optional file for fuller lips and more character or 1.8 patch with toned arms abs is another recommended option),\r\n [*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4333] Navetsea’s Straighter Hair Retexture[/url],\r\n [*] *[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3574] Gizmodian Scars [/url], \r\n[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=140] Amazing Smooth Females Z- Faces[/url].[/list]\r\nThe ENB used is [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17672] Pineapplevision[/url]. Favorite ENB so far and I recommend to give it a try. \r\n\r\n[size=4]Want to customize Borgakh further to get rid of her warpaint? Scar? Add new hair? [/size]\r\nNo worries! Instead of making many variations which is TEDIOUS I’ll teach you instead. \r\n[list=1]\r\n[*]You’ll need to open then Creation Kit. If you haven’t gotten it already download it in the steam library in the tools section.\r\n[*]Open my mod, by clicking on the folder icon around the top-left corner and checking my .esp from the list. Click ok to whatever comes up.\r\n[*]In the actors tab at the object window, search Borgakh and scroll down until you actually find her (long list, I know) and double click on her name. \r\n[*]A window should pop up. Check the box below beside the word head to see her face ([size=2]some ENBs don’t make objects in the CK show. TEMPORARILY REMOVE THE d3d9.dll TO SOLVE THIS[/size]) Move through the tabs until you reach Character Gen Parts.\r\n[*]Char Gen Parts is where you can edit the skin, hair, eye color, tattoo visibility, etc for your character. If you want to remove dirt or warpaint or anything else there is a long list of them on the left-hand side. To get rid of them, just set the tone to color average. NOTE THAT YOU CAN’T GIVE NPCS CUSTOM WARPAINT HERE. You’d get weird freckles instead. (The warpaint used for Borgakh is FemaleHeadWarpaint_06, OrcWarpaint_04 and OrcWarpaint_05)\r\n[*]Scars are located at the bottom right box where it says Additional Head Parts. Click on the scars and press delete to remove them.\r\n[*]If you want to put custom hair, Apachii [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168] posted[/url] a quick tutorial in her mod description.\r\n[*]Once you are satisfied, hit OK. Then click the NPC’s name again at the object window and hit ctrl+f4 to export the face textures (otherwise you’d get the grey face).\r\n[*]Save your new .esp under a new name because CK is weird like that.\r\n[*]In the load order, uncheck or delete my esp to make your customized one work.[/list]\r\n[size=4] Posting alternates of my facemorphs as MODS will not be allowed[/size] Images however are coolbeans. B)\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Known Issues[/b]: \r\nThere is a slight problem with the lighting. Thanks to fileosoft for explaining it to me. To make things look better  first download the[url= http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5737] \\\"Calientes texture Blender\\\"[/url] . And then download the config file [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16263]here[/url]( for people using bella or coverwomen mod try [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15921[/url] this [/url])\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5] WHO’S NEXT? [/size]\r\nI have Uthgerd half-done but her save file was accidently deleted. :S Eola, Jordis and Iona are still in their first steps but its becoming more difficult making them look unique. So that means I’m working slowly on them. ;) IDK if anyone wants Annekke or Adelasia so I’m ignoring them for now.\r\n\r\n[center][size=7]MY OTHER FACEMORPHS[/size][/center] [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17916][img]http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c249/AMUNET_CAMMEO/AELAICON-2.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19125][img]http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c249/AMUNET_CAMMEO/ARANEAICON.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18449][IMG]http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c249/AMUNET_CAMMEO/BRELYNAICON-1.jpg[/IMG][/url][URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20491][IMG] http://i.imgur.com/XSoco.jpg[/IMG][/URL][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19344 ][img] http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c249/AMUNET_CAMMEO/ILLIAICON.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20517/ ][img]http://i.imgur.com/9VQEc.jpg[/img][/url]   [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18043][img]http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c249/AMUNET_CAMMEO/LYDIAICON-2.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17960][IMG]http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c249/AMUNET_CAMMEO/MARCURIOICON-2.jpg[/IMG][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18459][IMG]http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c249/AMUNET_CAMMEO/MJOLLICON-1.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19293/?tab=3&navtag=/ajax/comments/?thread_id=710078|:|mod_id=19293][img] http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c249/AMUNET_CAMMEO/NJADAicon.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19252][IMG]http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c249/AMUNET_CAMMEO/RIAICON.jpg[/img][/url]",
