  "descriptionHtml": "I like the archmage robes you get for completing the College of winterhold questline, they look cool, its stats are kinda mediocre though. So I buffed it to a 20% cost reduction of all schools instead of 15 (this also works on the hoodless version). It is not buffed up to Master robe quality because it means you get to choose between a weaker but general over a greater specialized one.Â \r<br />\r<br />I also added a pair of unenchanted Archmage boots for personal enchanting. They are sitting right next to the enchanted ones in the archmage&#39;s quarters.\r<br />\r<br />To install put the esp files your skyrim/data folder",
