  "descriptionHtml": "It is a explosive Daedric arrow (Freezing Daedric Arrow)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nV.1\r\n-An Explosive Daedric Arrow\r\n-Not for indoor use\r\n-Not for close quarter combat\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe arrow has an explosive tip and explodes on impact (icy explosion)\r\nThe arrow also emits a Ice Blue light when in flight for easy-night time-tracking.\r\nThere is a recipe in Whiterun Bannered Mare Inn with some arrows for you to try out.\r\nPlease note that you will need the Daedra smiting perk in order to be able to create the Freezing Daedric Arrow.\r\n\r\nThis mod does not affect other arrows and should be compatible with other arrow and weapon mods.\r\n\r\nThis arrow is different though, besides of the lights- it has a delay timer and will not explode on impact\r\nso you can shoot the arrow unto the ground in front of your enemy or a group of enemies and it has a chance \r\nto injure a few of them at the same time.\r\n\r\nThere is still one thing I am trying to figure out, how to hit an enemy and get an delayed explosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like it if you check out my other arrow mod \\\"Hot Daedric Arrow\\\" which is explosive on impact, and endorse if you like.\r\n\r\nThere will be some updates.\r\n\r\n- Non explosive glowing arrows- with different types of colors\r\n- Other types of explosive effects. \r\n\r\nThanks, Hulk9111.",
