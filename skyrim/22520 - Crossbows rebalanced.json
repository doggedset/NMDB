  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod, which rebalances crossbows and bolts in Dawnguard.\r\n\r\nThe base damage of both types of crossbows, including the enhanced versions have been increased. Bolts do double damage, but require more materials to smith.\r\n\r\nInstead of 1 firewood and 1 ingot required to make 10 bolts, it now takes 5 ingots and 1 firewood to make 24 bolts. This is to make up for the double damage. The bolts value also reflect the materials required to make them - you will find it cheaper to create your own bolts than to buy them.\r\n\r\nEnchanted bolts now use 24 bolts instead of 10, but still only require the one fire/frost/void salts. The value of these bolts are also increased to reflect the price of the materials required to create them.",
