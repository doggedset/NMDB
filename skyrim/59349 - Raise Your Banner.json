  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Arial][size=5][b][center]Raise Your Banner\r<br />[/center]\r<br />[/b][/size][/font]This mod allows the player to quickly place a Banner anywhere, displayed on a wooden post. Using a &#34;Scroll of Raise Your Banner,&#34; you can add extra ambiance and immersion to your player home, camp site, or battle field. Easily remove the banner from the world just by activating it, and it&#39;ll be back in your pocket for later.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=1]This is currently a BETA version, and only has one Imperial banner placed in the world (On the strategy table in Dragonsreach. I know it says it&#39;s stealing--just don&#39;t get caught taking it; as soon as you use it, it will forget the stolen tag. I wanted it somewhere easy to find for testing purposes). When I have received feedback on possible issues and have all the various factions banners created and added to lists, then I will take this mod out of BETA and call it v1.1.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=1]Thanks to redditor /u/kyste for the great idea.Â [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=1]You can always use &#34;help raise&#34; in console to find the code for the scroll, then &#34;player.additem xxxxxxxx 1&#34; where xxxxxxxx is the provided id. This way you can try using multiple banners at once, or avoid going to Dragonsreach for whatever reason.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=1]As a final note: Until I have released the final version, I do not want my work copied, altered, or uploaded anywhere else or by anyone else other than me.[/size]",
