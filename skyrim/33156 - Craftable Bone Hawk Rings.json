  "descriptionHtml": "JUN 29, 2013 UPDATE: A recipe has been added in the UNOFFICIAL DAWNGUARD PATCH 1.2.3 (3 bonehawk claws, silver ingot, leather strips). If you use the patch, this mod is now unnecessary. You can still use both mods with no problems. Then you will get two different recipes instead of one.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA very simple mod that allows the player to craft bone hawk rings. Nothing more. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\\'t understand why bone hawk amulets are craftable, but rings are not. Let\\'s put those bone hawk claws to use. No more breaking in to Volkihar Keep just to obtain the only one sample (marked with stolen tag), or cheating your way to using console commands.\r\nBone hawk rings are now craftable at any forge under the jewelry section using 1 steel ingot, 1 silver ingot, and 3 bone hawk claws. \r\n\r\nRequires Dawnguard DLC\r\n\r\nInstuctions: Download with Nexus Mod Manager and double click the file to activate.",
