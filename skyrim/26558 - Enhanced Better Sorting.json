  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#cc0000][size=4][s]Hey guys&#33; It&#39;s been a while I know. Honestly, I&#39;ve been avoiding the whole site for fear of falling off the wagon (I mean Skyrim and modding of course, my drinking problem has nothing to do with this xD). Unfurtunately I&#39;m notback with an update, however, a friend of mine saw my mod and asked me if he could make some changes to it so I said yes of course. I don&#39;t really have any more info for you guys right now, but once his mod is done I&#39;ll update this post with a link.\r<br />\r<br />[/s][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66797/?]Here it is&#33;[/url] I&#39;ll keep my file up since I have some compatibility patches he doesn&#39;t and mine still supports non DLC installations but I won&#39;t be making any updates since I don&#39;t play Skyrim anymore. So long and thanks for all the fish&#33;[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i46.tinypic.com/2hd8k0i.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Since I started modding Skyrim I&#39;ve always used [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2730]HeadBomb&#39;s Better Sorting[/url], but I was disappointed when it wasn&#39;t updated to include the DLCs or any other missing content. So I present you with my own Better Sorting mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]If you feel like I could&#39;ve done a better job at renaming a particular item, you think I missed an item, or you simply think my mod sucks feel free to make suggestions.[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i47.tinypic.com/2w1sd5h.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />This mod renames a lot of items in the game so they sort better in your inventory and you don&#39;t have to spend your precious time looking for that one item. It covers many items from the vanilla game, including the three DLC packs.\r<br />It consists of 8 different ESP files (modules) and each one renames a different type of items. Some of the modules come in different versions that reduce item weight or rename items a bit differently. In the images tab you can see the new nomenclature for most items.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF0000][u][size=5]All in One versions (Used by themselves):[/size][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#00FF00]EBS - All-in-One:[/color][/u]\r<br />This isn&#39;t actually a mod supplied by myself, instead I wrote an Article which explains the process of how to merge all of the ESPs from my mod into a single one.\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#00FF00]EBS - All-in-One (eclips3&#39;s Selection):[/color][/u]\r<br />This is the one I used (before I started using SkyRe). It includes all modules (vanilla weights), Books (Before) and Soul Gems (Numbered). It also requires [color=#FF0000]ALL three DLCs[/color] and the following mods: [color=#FF0000]Soul Gems Differ, Radiant and Unique Potions and Poisons HD, Book Covers and Explosive Bolts Visuliazed.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#00FF00]EBS - All-in-One (SkyRe):[/color][/u]\r<br />eclips3&#39;s Selection [color=#FF0000]+[/color] [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286]SkyRe[/url]\r<br />Note that this is still ongoing but it should be fine to use.\r<br />YES, the requirements for eclips3&#39;s Selection still apply&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF0000][u][size=5]Modules version (Used in conjuction with each other, or by themselves):[/size][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#00FF00]EBS - Ammo:[/color][/u]\r<br />Covers all arrows and bolts.\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#00FF00]EBS - Books:[/color][/u]\r<br />Renames journals, letters, poison/potion recipes, treasure maps, Atronach forge recipes, home decorating guides and a bunch of other books. Doesn&#39;t include spell tomes (those are included in the Spells module).\r<br />Comes in two versions:\r<br />[color=#800080](Book Before):[/color] &#34;(Alchemy) A Game at Dinner&#34;.\r<br />[color=#800080](Book After):[/color] &#34;A Game at Dinner (Alchemy)&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#00FF00]EBS - Food:[/color][/u]\r<br />Renames food items. Doesn&#39;t affect alcohols. I recommend you use in conjuction with &#34;EBS - Potions&#34;.\r<br />Comes in three versions:\r<br />[color=#800080](Vanilla Weight):[/color] doesn&#39;t alter the food weights at all.\r<br />[color=#800080](Light Weight):[/color] reduces the weight of all food items to 0.1.\r<br />[color=#800080](Weightless):[/color] reduces the weight of all food items to 0.\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#00FF00]EBS - Ingredients:[/color][/u]\r<br />Renames alchemy ingredients.\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#00FF00]EBS - Misc:[/color][/u]\r<br />Renames a bunch of items from the miscellaneous tab. \r<br />Includes:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]All the smeltable dwemer metal are renamed this way: &#34;Dwemer Scrap - xxxx [The number of ingots it produces]&#34; so it&#39;s easier to identify from useless dwemer clutter\r<br />[*]Crafting Materials (ingots, ores, pelts, hides and gems)\r<br />[*]Dragon claws\r<br />[*]Other clutter (bowls, dishes, pots, empty bottles, ruined books, etc)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#00FF00]EBS - Potions:[/color][/u]\r<br />Renames potions, poisons and alcohols. It changes all alcohols to potions instead of being spread out across the potions and food categories.\r<br />Comes in three versions:\r<br />[color=#800080](Vanilla Weight):[/color] doesn&#39;t alter the potions or alcohols weights at all.\r<br />[color=#800080](Light Weight):[/color] reduces the weight of all potions and alcohols to 0.1.\r<br />[color=#800080](Weightless):[/color] reduces the weight of all potions and alcohols to 0.\r<br />NOTE: Potions and poisons obtained through loot and stores have a dash separator (eg. Restore Health - III) while potions and poisons made through alchemy have a star (eg. Restore Health *). \r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#00FF00]EBS - Soul Gems:[/color][/u]\r<br />Renames all Soul Gems; from Petty to Black. Comes in two versions: [color=#800080](Named)[/color] & [color=#800080](Numbered)[/color]. Check the images to see the difference between the two. I personally prefer the Numbered version because it makes them sort better.\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#00FF00]EBS - Spells:[/color][/u]\r<br />Renames the vanilla spells as well as all the corresponding scrolls and spell tomes. \r<br />[color=#F4A460]NOTE:[/color] This is probably the one that makes the most changes but I feel it&#39;s is much better and intuitive now since almost all spells are ranked which makes them easier to both find them and know which one&#39;s are the better ones. This can however be confusing to those who have been using the spells with vanilla names so to help you distinguish between them I made a Word document which can be found in the Files tab. Originally it was just meant as documentation for myself, but I decided to clean it up and upload it.\r<br />[color=#F4A460]NOTE:[/color] Spells and their respective spell tomes and scrolls have the same names. The only difference are the separators they use - spells use a dot while scrolls and spell tomes use a dash. For Example: Heal. III is a spell, Scroll of Heal - III is a scroll & Spell Tome: Heal - III is a spell tome and they all refer to the same spell. This was neccesary to make it work with CFM.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i48.tinypic.com/aypmd.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s a version for all combinations of DLCs (including no DLCs at all).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i45.tinypic.com/2bnndy.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Installing with a mod manager is [color=#FF0000]HIGHLY[/color] recommended, I personally use and recommend [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1334]Mod Organizer by Tannin[/url] but NMM is a good, simpler alternative.\r<br />My main aim with this mod is compatibilty so that plus all the patches I offer means that you should put it pretty much at the very end of your load order (before dynamic patches of course).\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re adamant about manual installation I assume it&#39;s because you know what you are doing so you don&#39;t need my help here.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i49.tinypic.com/29biwrc.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />To uninstall use your mod manager or -if you don&#39;t use one- simply remove the associated files.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i48.tinypic.com/oiykvn.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />None so far but please let me know if you catch anything.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i47.tinypic.com/dzdoyh.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF0000]Compatible with:[/color]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19]USKP[/url], [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23491]UDGP[/url], [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25127]UHFP[/url] & [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31083/]UDBP[/url].\r<br />[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34093]Weapons and Armor Fixes Remade[/url]\r<br />[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286]SkyRe&#33;&#33;&#33;[/url] - YES, finally&#33; This does have some requirements though (read above).\r<br />[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4862]CFM[/url] - I included a CFM config based on [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22307]this one[/url] if you use it please go over there and give him an endorsement.
