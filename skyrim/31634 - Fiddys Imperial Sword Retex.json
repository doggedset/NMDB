  "descriptionHtml": "I always thought the Imperial sword looked a little meh, and all the retexs on the nexus never really did it for me, so I made this one. I wasn\\'t really planning on releasing it, but a friend said I should. This seems to be the case for a lot of people I\\'ve noticed. My favorite part about this is the Damascus blade and the Sapphire hilt. xD\r\n\r\nTo install just drop data into......well.....your Skyrim folder. I shouldn\\'t have to say this, really.\r\n\r\nIf you want to edit this further, or if this inspires you, feel free to do whatever the hell you want with it.",
