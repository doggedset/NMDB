  "summary": "Makes Dragonscale armor only craftable via the light armor branch of smithing, and Dragonplate armor only craftable via the heavy armor branch.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes the light pieces of dragon armor craftable only if you have taken the light armor branch of the smithing tree.  Likewise, the heavy pieces of dragon armor are only craftable if you have taken the heavy branch of the smithing tree.  \n<br />\n<br />I thought it was silly that it was in the best interests of light armor users to take the heavy smithing branch, which enables them to craft both the strongest weapons AND the strongest light armor.  With this mod, the light armor branch becomes much more useful.  It was also slightly silly that a light armor smith could also make the second strongest heavy armor for their follower pals.\n<br />\n<br />To install, extract Dragon_smithing_split.esp to your Skyrim/data directory.  Launch Skyrim, choose Data Files at the splash screen, and make sure Dragon_smithing_split.esp is checked.",
