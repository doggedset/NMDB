  "descriptionHtml": "V1.5 RELEASED!\r\n\r\nHi all!\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod which I have uploaded to the \r\nworkshop, so go easy on me!!\r\n\r\nIts a very simple mod which adds a small shack outside \r\nof Falkreath, for new players/accounts. It is free as well!  \r\n\r\nIt\\'s a small, lore friendly shack, and comes with a \r\nweapon, known as the \\'Iron Pulveriser\\' (although a lot \r\nmore powerful than iron!). Unfortunately there is no \r\ntexturing:\r\n\r\n1. because it is Dovahkiin\\'s shack, the iron fits in with the \r\nconcept of the dragonborn from all of the trailers and gameplay.\r\n\r\n2. because I\\'m still learning about creating weapons but \r\nmaybe in the future I might add a sword or something \r\nwith a custom model. I do have all the tools to make a \r\nmodel though.\r\n\r\n//They key to the house can be found in a chest in \\'Dead Man\\'s Drink\\' in Falkreath//\r\n\r\nI will update this mod a fair amount as I enjoy working on \r\ninteroir design in houses. I\\'m no pro, but I like simple things like plates with food on plates :L random  I know but its just a thing I have.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for reading, and if you enjoyed feel free to help me out by endorsing this mod! Thanks a lot :)\r\n\r\n-Jake\r\n\r\n::V1.5::\r\n\r\nAdded much more interior design for a more comfortable home\r\n\r\nAdded a follower by the name of Antekir\r\n\r\nAdded a few exterior details (more will be worked on in the future)\r\n\r\nAdded a donation system for the dragonborn. Outside the house is a statue of Talos, and a chest. The chest will respawn every so often with more money and a not from a friend (the chest is not safe!)\r\n\r\nAdded NavMesh inside the house so now followers can go into the house and walk around/operate environmental objects\r\n\r\nPlease comment on what you like/dislike about the new features and anything you would like to see or for something you would like altered :)\r\n\r\nPLANS FOR THE FUTURE\r\n\r\nAdding in some kind of mine or dungeon outisde the house. Will probably be a mine\r\n\r\nAdding a new shop around the corner\r\n\r\nA story behind the house\r\n\r\nSome kind of textured weapon\r\n\r\nA better way to get the key to the house (maybe an easy quest or something idk yet)",
