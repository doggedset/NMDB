  "descriptionHtml": "[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/mS6SN.gif[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][u][color=#ff0000]UPDATED 3/24/2016: THIS MOD REQUIRES FNIS V6.2 OR LATER. Using updated FNIS will fix &#34;ghosting&#34; and prevent NPCS from moving during sequenced animations. \r<br />All information on this page applies to Fully Animated Meals and Potions only. FAMP and Animated Consumables are two separate projects. [/color][/u][/i][/b]\r<br />UPDATED 12/21/2012: VERSION 5.4beta\r<br />Changelog:\r<br />Added simple support for wild game meats (simple=lazy all meats use same mesh/animation)\r<br />Supports Cooked horse, goat, mammoth, and skeever.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATED 12/18/2012: version 5.3 \r<br />Changelog:\r<br />\r<br />*Added tag to alchemy potions. User created potions that will trigger animation, are labeled &#34;Animated&#34; in the menu list.\r<br />\r<br />*Added tag to all supported items. Any item that triggers animation, are labled with an ( * ) in the menu list. This will help identify unsupported items.\r<br />\r<br />*Adjusted the size of Exlir bottles, shouldnt look so massive in hand now.\r<br />\r<br />*Adjusted the size of SweetRolls, should help the clipping.\r<br />\r<br />*Changed the mesh for Empty Bottles, to keep users from mistaking them for small Heal potions.\r<br />\r<br />*Adjusted Empty Bottle count found in Barrles.\r<br />\r<br />*Added Empty Bottles to Vendors.\r<br />\r<br />*Added some Soup/Stews to Vendors.\r<br />\r<br />*Added non-looping animations for Wines.\r<br />\r<br />*Added non-looping animations for bread.\r<br />\r<br />*Adjusted Clipping issues on various items.\r<br />\r<br />*Added support for both cooked fish items.\r<br />\r<br />*Added A TON of new meshes. Now animations will feature the proper items&#33; For example red/green apples, White/Yellow cheeses, And most of all ALL potions. The potion used in the animation, will now match the items look in the inventory menu.\r<br />\r<br />Please DO NOT use assets from the newest version in other mods, I gave premission for previous Builds, this does not apply to new content. \r<br />\r<br />Now you can see your character eat almost anything in Skyrim. This mod will trigger animations when food is eaten, that will actually reflect what your character eating. No more clicking on a juicy steak and seeing your character eat a loaf of bread&#33; This mod also supports potions. Long, hard fight with a dragon? Click a healing potion from the menu, and you&#39;ll activate an animation of your character drinking a healing potion. And yes finally...support for alchemy created potions&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Quick list of supported items:\r<br />All healing potions\r<br />All magicka potions\r<br />All stamina potions\r<br />All alchemy potions (see below)\r<br />All soup/stews\r<br />Bread \r<br />All wines\r<br />Sweetrolls\r<br />Apples\r<br />Cooked beef\r<br />Cooked Venison\r<br />Cook chicken\r<br />Cooked pheasent\r<br />Cooked rabbit\r<br />Cooked horker\r<br />All cheeses\r<br />All meads/ale\r<br />All skill fortifying potions\r<br />\r<br />This mod will add a ton of immersive elements to your gameplay. More updates will come, adding more items.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Now for a little fine print: \r<br />Animations will not trigger in combat, I think this is a good thing.\r<br />\r<br />New animations will not trigger while sitting (this is currently impossible)\r<br />\r<br />Default animations will NO LONGER trigger while seated (bread and wine) this seams to be an issue related to Dawnguard. If I make the mod without Dawnguard as a masterfile, this happens idk why at the moment.\r<br />\r<br />There are a few food items not supported yet (raw foods)\r<br />\r<br />Ingredients are not supported yet (carrots cabbage ect)\r<br />\r<br />Notes on alchemy:\r<br />To make this possible, I had to get creative. In ordered to create a animated alchemy potion, you MUST create it with a new ingredient I&#39;ve added...the empty bottle.  These are found in barrels, and a few more have been placed around Skrim. You can find a starter set in the Alchemy shop in Whiterun, I recommend you save the empty bottles for potions you want to use not sale, and also that you dont experiment with empty bottles, Any failed potion made with one, will result in a &#34;Potion of Empty Bottle&#34; which is worthless and cost you your bottle. So basicly don&#39;t grind or test potion mixtures with bottles, save them for the good stuff. Do not make posions with empty bottles, it just waste your bottle and adds a false &#34;Animated&#34; tag.\r<br />\r<br />THIS MOD REQUIRES FNIS V6.2OR LATER\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11811\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />If you used my previous version, uninstall it and run FNIS generator for users before installing.\r<br />\r<br />Install with NMM, the run FNIS generator for users: data/tools/GenerateFNIS_for_Users\r<br />\r<br />Click update FNIS Behavior\r<br />\r<br />Use NMM to set my esp &#34;potions_beta&#34; to last in load order.\r<br />\r<br />Done.Grab yourself a bite.\r<br />\r<br />I would like to thank Fore, for his excellent tool, and the info he provided me while making this mod. On a side note FNIS is really user friendly, and easy to work with. Trust me any problems with it are user error, I know from experience.\r<br />\r<br />I also want to thank SkyHawk, he created the scripts used in this mod, without his work this would not be possible.\r<br />\r<br />This mod took a great deal of time/effort to make, and still isn&#39;t finished, it will be updated if it is well recieved, so if you enjoy it, drop me a line in the comments, or endorse. \r<br />\r<br />CAUTION&#33;&#33;: PLEASE DO NOT &#34;EAT&#34; EMPTY BOTTLES&#33; DOING SO COULD LEAD TO INJURY OR EVEN DEATH&#33; THE AUTHOR IS IN NO WAY LIABLE FOR ANY INJURIES RESULTING IN EATING EMPTY BOTTLES, WHILE ATTEMPTING TO LEARN IT&#39;S EFFECTS&#33;..............
