  "descriptionHtml": "I left the scar and one blind eye, gave him more of the orc eyebrow horns and also hair and a beard.  I didn\\'t feel like Orsimer would like less hair in the bitter cold of Skyrim.\r\n\r\nJust drop the ESP and BSA in your data folder and activate.  It worked fine for me.\r\n\r\nThis is the first mod I\\'ve made, very simple.  Doesn\\'t change stats or anything like that.  ",
