  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#00ff00][size=6]Thank You For Considering My Mod[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]1/15/2015 - UPDATE v1.1: [/b] [color=#00FFFF] It was brought to my attention that there were a few small bugs with them home. I have fully Navmeshed the entire home and lab, so it is now follower friendly. Also I have fixed the sounds of the custom containers so they potions sounds like potions, scrolls sounds like scrolls etc. I have added a stable for the horse Winter Eyes, also. An[size=4][color=#00FFFF]d lastly, I have made the home more Adventurer looking, with less golden items and more items found in everyday life throughout Tamriel. Thank you for downloading the mod and keep on the lookout for more Updates and more Mods in the future&#33; [/color][/size][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />   Norskaar is my first mod I&#39;ve ever made. This is a mod the adds an all new player home to the game. I made this home using the Skyrim Creation Kit, using a home already in the game as a template, deleting everything inside, then completely refurnishing it. It&#39;s my first attempt at a player home, and plan to more in the future. If you do choose to download it, thank you for giving it a chance and I hope you enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=5][b][u]COMPATABILITY[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]I have recently learned that this mod DOES NOT work well with the mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19618/?]Auto Harvest[/url]. The mods are compatible and will load together but with the mod on, it will take the items that I used for the custom containers. The items are inside a collision box and are inaccessible but with this mod on it ignores that and takes the items anyways. If you have this mod I suggest turning it off every time you&#39;re about to enter the Norskaar Home or Lab. I am currently looking for a fix for this, and there will be an update with it eventually.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=5][u][b]FEATURES[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod includes\r<br />\r<br />- The Player Home itself -- Norskaar -- located North of Rorikstead on the hill:\r<br />   - 10 weapon plaques, 12 weapon racks, 3 shield/weapon plaques, 4 mannequins\r<br />   - Anvil, grindstone, workbench, smelter, tanning rack, cooking spit\r<br />   - Custom storage for Ingots, Ores, Jewels, Jewelry, Armor, Weapons and Miscellaneous\r<br />   - 1 bed, 2 dressers, 2 bookcases (6 bookshelves)\r<br />   - Decorations already installed**\r<br />\r<br />- The Norskaar Laboratory:\r<br />   - Alchemy Lab, Enchanting Table, Anvil and Cooking Spit\r<br />   - Custom storage for Ingredients, Potions, Poisons, Scrolls, Soul Gems (filled and empty) and Enchanted Weapons\r<br />   - Decorations already installed**\r<br />\r<br />- A Free Horse -- Winter Eyes -- That is in the stable.\r<br />\r<br />** if you don&#39;t like the decorations, since I don&#39;t know how to make another file that gives you the mod without them, I suggest downloading Jaxonz Positioner: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52583/?\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=5][color=#00ff00]INSTALLATION[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/u][/b]- Simply click files, and then install using NMM or Manually by putting the downloaded .zip or .jar into C:&#92;Games&#92;Nexus Mod Manager&#92;Skyrim&#92;Mods\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b][u][color=#00ff00]NOTE[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b][/size]   Please bear with me, as I had said previously: This is my first mod so if there are any bugs please report them to me so I can make an attempt to fix it.",
