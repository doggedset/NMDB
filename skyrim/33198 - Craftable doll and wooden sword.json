  "descriptionHtml": "I hate coming back at home with nothing for my children. Most of the time I have dozen of gift on my horse (just in case!) but a carefully handcrafted gift is probably better than a common doll don\\'t you think?\r\n\r\nThis mod add crafting recipe for child doll and wooden sword. Both can be crafted at a forge under the misc section using a firewood.\r\nI know using a tanning rack to craft a wooden sword is stupid but the only other solution who came to my mind was to add a lesser power opening a menu then checking if you had the required material and so on.\r\nWhat is supposed to be a tiny mod would then have been not so tiny.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach version features a different recipe for the doll:\r\n1.0.0 use firewood (my mistake)\r\n1.1.0 use linen wraps and straw. More logical but you won\\'t be able to buy linen wraps in town.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall instruction:\r\nUse your favorite mod manager.\r\nor:\r\nUnzip Craftable doll and wooden sword.7z\r\nDrop Craftable doll and wooden sword.esp in your Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\ folder\r\nCheck the box for Craftable doll and wooden sword  in the DATA section of the Skyrim Launcher",
