  "descriptionHtml": "Aela and Gormlaith\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nBy c_striker\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#00FF00] UPDATE:[/color] I have now released a new mod, \\\"ESP - Expanded Skyrim Presets\\\", which makes these characters (along with 300+ other NPCs) available to play as presets in the character creation menu. If you\\'d prefer the preset version, which allows you to customize the character or to convert your existing character via the showracemenu console command, you can find the new mod [color=yellow] [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15963&tab=3&navtag=/modules/comments/comments_ajax.php?tid=658266|:|fid=15963] here[/color][/url].\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis file includes level one save games of precise clones of the female Nord NPCs Aela the Huntress (of Whiterun) and Gormlaith Golden-Hilt (of Sovingarde), for those who wish to play as one of them or as a Nord character who looks like one of them.\r\n\r\nThese player characters are exact replicas of the NPCs upon which they are based. I am offering versions both with and without war paint, as well as a custom makeover version of Aela. The custom version retains the same hair/eye color and facial geometry, but in addition to the war paint I\\'ve removed her freckles, plucked a few eyebrows and changed her hairstyle and makeup. Aside from the optional changes, the player chargen settings are the same as the vanilla NPC settings, so no matter which face mods you use, if any, when you pull up the player character from the save game she should look exactly like your in-game NPC (unless you previously used an NPC editor to change the NPC, in which case all bets are off). If you want both the player character and her NPC counterpart to look like they do in the screenshots, then you would need to use the same mods I do, as noted below.\r\n\r\nEach lady is saved just outside the cave after escaping Helgen Keep.\r\n\r\nIf you like my work, please feel free to check out my other mods:\r\n* \\\"Astrid and Karliah\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=50370\r\n* \\\"Cicero and Lucien Lachance\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=51857\r\n* \\\"Diverse Female Housecarls\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=49520\r\n* \\\"Dromarash and Veezara\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=51546\r\n* \\\"Hroki and Jordis\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=50842 \r\n* \\\"Lisette and Muiri\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=51033 \r\n* \\\"Val - Twin Sister of Vex\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=39781\r\n\r\n\r\nMods used in the screenshots\r\n============================\r\nFace:\r\n* \\\"Better Females by Bella\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=9747 (\\\"No make up just improved textures\\\" version)\r\n* \\\"Beauty Faces by NecKros\\\": http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=6226 (specular map only)\r\n* \\\"No More Blocky Faces\\\" by Xenius: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=13714 (I use version 1.3)\r\nI use a blend of these three mods. Install No More Blocky Faces first, then Bella\\'s mod, then take only the specular map (femalehead_s.dds) from the NecKros mod and use it to replace the one from Bella.\r\nThe specular map is located in the following folder: textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female\r\nEyes:\r\n* \\\"Natural Eyes\\\" by nevenbridge: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=11110 (human eyes only)\r\nHair:\r\n* \\\"Straight hair retexture\\\" by navetsea: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/download.php?id=13007\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation (manual)\r\n=====================\r\n1.
