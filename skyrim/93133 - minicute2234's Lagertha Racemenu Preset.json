  "summary": "One of my preset that ive been working on. i tried to make it look like Lagertha from Vikings. please enjoy my preset. if u did like it, give it a \"endorse\" thank you. I already done lagertha preset for sse and fo4. check em out by clicking my profile. This time i used racemenu to do the preset for the original skyrim. Reason?(below). letterslimit",
  "descriptionHtml": "Honestly, Racemenu has its perks - saving the preset, exporting the head. but in terms of more slider options, and more variety of choices within that slider - ECE takes the lead. i couldnt do many things that i wanted to do on the nose, jowls... Especially the eyes idk what is wrong with the choices they all look creepy!\n<br />\n<br />Reason for this preset is... I'm going to do a follower!!! and i need your opinions on this preset. changes that you think needs to be made and i will try my best to change em. i found a way to make a follower but racemenu was a requirement.",
