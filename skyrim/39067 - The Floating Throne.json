  "descriptionHtml": "Just south of Riverwood lies a small house, abandoned for years after its owner\\'s mysterious disappearance. Some say it was due to bandits. Others, that a ruin was found beneath the foundation of the dwelling, and the undead neighbors were not very friendly. And a smaller, quieter rumor, speaks of an Empress long thought dead, waiting for her moment to strike. \r\n\r\nTechnical Details - \r\n\r\nA very small dungeon mod with high-level enemies, and a unique set of Daedric Armor. Should be compatible with pretty much everything, but if there are any mod conflicts be sure to let me know. \r\n",
