  "modName": "The Beautiful Elanna Hammon",
  "summary": "For those of you simply looking for a pretty girl to marry in Skyrim and don\\'t want to potentially bug future quests, this mod is for you! I present, Elanna Hammon. She is a Breton built off of Muiri\\\\\\'s original appearance and tweaked to my liking. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Do not download original version anymore! You will not be able to update. Only download version 0.0.2 or later.\r\nA beautiful young Breton named Elanna has traveled to Skyrim in search of a strong, able-bodied Nord suitor. She will, however, marry anyone that asks her using the common dialogue. She is not a follower but maybe will be in a future version or in a future mod if requested. Her sole purpose in Skyrim is to exist as your beautiful wife and provide you with whatever you desire. I am working on making her compatible with all skin replacers and hair mods, but not all are supported yet, therefore none are required. I created her using the NPC editor by foretrenty which can be found here on the nexus. \r\nShe can be found either having a drink in the Bannered Mare, or wandering around the Gildergreen in Whiterun. She wears the tavern outfit so as to fit in to the Vanilla game and keep things lore-friendly. \r\n\r\nHow to install:\r\nEither use NMM or download the .zip and extract it to your data folder. Once this is done, make sure that Elanna Hammon.esp is checked in you data files and you\\\\\\'re good to go! \r\n\r\nTo uninstall either use NMM or delete both the ElannaHammon.esp and ElannaHammon.bsa files from your data folder.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs: Small neck seam. I don\\'t intend to fix this as it\\'s hardly noticable.\r\n\r\nNo required mods, but to get her to look like the pictures, use CBBE, better females by Bella, and Eyes of Beauty.\r\n\r\nHow to update: \r\n1. Completely remove original mod. If you\\'re married to her you will need to go through the reset marriage console commands to restore.\r\n2. Install updated version. \r\n\r\nChangelog: \r\n10/14/13 Initial release\r\n10/15/13 Fixed grey face bug. Hopefully will have follower enabled with next release (thinking of Spellsword combat style).\r\n10/17/13 Added Spellsword combat style as well as modified a few attributes and added some spells. Working on getting her to be a follower but for now just use console command \\\"addfac 5c84d 1\\\" to get her as a follower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease report any other issues here on the nexus and thanks for checking out my first mod!",
