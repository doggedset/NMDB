  "summary": "this is my non dragonborn required mod that lets you craft any basic staff found in the game at a forge. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "unlike my dragonborn-required craftable staff mod, this mod doesnt have craftable unenchanted staves. also, to craft the staff, you need arcane blacksmith perk for all staves, but at least a lesser soul gem and at least the second enchanter perk, depending on the strength of the staff enchantment. example: you need the lesser soul gem as a crafting material and the second enchanter perk (the one at level 20 enchanting), the arcane blacksmith perk, and the other crafting materials to make a staff of conjure familiar.\r<br />\r<br />also unlike my other mod, you don&#39;t need to know the spell to make the staff, BUT you do need to have the spell book. i was going to use scrolls, but then you wouldn&#39;t be able to make staff of frostbite, staff of healing, etc. \r<br />\r<br />finally, based on the staff, all require 4 firewood, 2 ingots depending on the staff, a spell tome and a depending soul gem. \r<br />\r<br />nothing is required, just download and play.
