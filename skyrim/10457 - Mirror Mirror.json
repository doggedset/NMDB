  "descriptionHtml": "Mirror Mirror for Skyrim - A Mod by Sorwen\r\nCurrent Version 0.1a\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis is a craftable book that when you read it will allow you to change your Race, Appearance, and Name.  This is just like using the console command showracemenu.  I just wanted another way to do it instead of the console.  It is listed under the Miscellaneous tab when at the forge.  The book requires one leather and one roll of paper to craft.\r\n\r\nOnce the book is crafted you will find it listed under book.  Simply click on the book to read it to activate.  You are asked to confirm so you don\\'t open the menu by mistake.\r\n\r\nI hope at some point use something other than the forge, but that was the only way I could get it to work for right now.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* There is an issue where your stats change if you use it to change your race.  If you use it only to change your appearance as I was then your stats are fine.\r\n* If you change your race multiple times it may level you.\r\n\r\n\r\n=====Installation/Use=====\r\nSimply place any one of the files into your Skyrim/Data/ folder then enable the file through the \\\"Data Files\\\" selection in the Skyrim launcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n=====Reuse/File posting=====\r\nDo not upload these files to your site. They should currently only be available at http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/index.php\r\nYou may reuse these files if:\r\n1. You name me in credit for these files\r\n2. The file is only available through Skyrim Nexus.",
