  "summary": "A Skyrim-esque interpretation of Mjolnir, Thor\\'s hammer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "I based this design of several existing Mjolnir designs but made it fit more with the art style of Skyrim. If Shor was in the game...maybe he would have a weapon such as this.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod. At the moment you can access the weapon via the console. Pressing the tilde key ( ` ) and then typing: \\\"help mjolnir\\\" to find its ID. Then typing \\\"player.additem <insert ID here> 1\\\", or by crafting it. You will need 3 leather strips, 3 Ebony Ingots and 1 Corundum Ore. To improve the weapon you will need 1 Moonstone Ingot.\r\n\r\nI hope to soon put the weapon in a chest somewhere in the world. Feel free to use this in your own mods but please credit me. If anyone knows how to make this throwable an returnable - be my guest and use it (and let me know how you did it lol)\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\nBalanced weapon stats. It now does 10 shock damage, not 33 like in the image and is closer to a glass mace in terms of its physical damage.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2 -  Added a larger version as requested. The hammer head is bigger and the handle is longer. \r\n\r\nAlso check out imperistan\\'s version of the mod. It uses my model but has a different texture.
