  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a convenient building outside of the city of Whiterun that includes many chests for a player to store his or her supplies in an organized manner. It includes some items for the most suitable comfort as well as a map marker to fast travel to. (See image for map location) This is also my first mod, so constructive criticism is appreciated! Comment to let me know if I should add anything special. I also use many mods, so my pictures may look somewhat different than yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation: Extract the .esb file to your C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data folder or use the Nexus Mod Manager. If you prefer Steam Workshop, you can check it out here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=13041.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersions:\r\n0.3: Changed name to \\\"Whiterun Depot\\\" for more immersion and added a video of the mod.\r\n0.2: New lighting and clutter added; functional bed, more mounts, banner, rugs, and more added to add more of a \\\"comfort\\\" feeling.\r\n0.1: Initial launch\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown issues: This has happened to me twice so far but isn\\'t much of a problem. I experienced the outside of the area disappear (the house), but the two doors were still there, so the area could still be accessed. In the end, I might have to end up moving the location of the building because I think that the cause of this is the big rock the building is merged into. Comment if you find any other problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: Click on the \\\"video\\\" tab or watch it here on Youtube:  video, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCgboV0vEys&feature=youtu.be",
