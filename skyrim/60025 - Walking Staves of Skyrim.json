  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=5]What this mod does:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=#00ff00]This mod adds alternate versions of all staves in the game and allows them to be carried like a torch to give a very convincing illusion in third person that you are, in fact, walking with a staff. These staves can only be added through the console. I have not added any torch or lighting effects to them. I haven&#39;t figured out how to do that yet. If there are enough requests for this, i will make a version 2 and update it. Here are the names of the staves so all you have to do is type in help &#34;staff of madness&#34; (or the other names listed below) and then just player.additem xxxxxxxxx to put it in your inventory.[/color] [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#ffff00]Names:[/color] [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3]Staff of Madness = Wabbajack\r<br />Staff of the Rose = Sanguine Rose\r<br />Staff of the Magus = Staff of Magnus\r<br />Staff of Worms = Skull of Corruption\r<br />Staff of Mora = Miraak&#39;s Staff\r<br />Staff of Illusion = Staff of Arcane Authority\r<br />Staff of Restoration = Staff of Healing Hands\r<br />Staff of Conjuration = Staff of Frost Atronoch\r<br />Staff of Destruction = Dragon Priest Staff\r<br />Staff of Alteration = Staff of Magelight[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]Warning: Do not have staff in hand when activating your horse or mount to ride. This will result in an instant CTD. I&#39;m not sure what causes this but i&#39;m looking into the issue.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/color][size=3][color=#00ff00]This mod has not been tested with female player characters, so there is a chance that it might not fit in the hands exactly.[/color] [/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#ffff00]Requirements:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/size][color=#00ff00][size=3]Dragonborn[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=5]Future Updates:[/size][/color][size=3] [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3]- Add light effects to the staves\r<br />- Add passive enchantments\r<br />- Add more staves like the ones not featured i.e. aetherium staff, hag&#39;s wrath, etc.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=5]Credits:\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][color=#00ff00][size=3]Full credit to maximluppov for giving me instructions on how to do this and creating his awesome Meridia&#39;s Light mod http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32842/?[/size][/color]",
