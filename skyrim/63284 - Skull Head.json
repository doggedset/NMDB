Like ghost rider... without the fire.\r<br />\r<br />I stumbled across some of my old mods that i thought were long lost.\r<br />I tired to replicate it but i just cant do it. T.T\r<br />I have no idea how i made this a few years ago.\r<br />So, releasing it as is in hopes someone shows interest to colaborate and help me out. Lots of projects, so little knowledge. -.-\r<br />\r<br />Well, so far, only human males that are max weight are supported. Works for me because i alway play a pumped up Nord.\r<br />If anyone wants to help me out make some variety with fire, ice smoke effects, Flee enchantment for scary factor or such, please PM me.\r<br />\r<br />Also, if u can replicate this, please PM me to make this for all races with assets from Beast Skeletons Resource mod.\r<br />\r<br />Well, if you happen to have a max weight character atm, give it a try for coolness or at least some cool pix and Enjoy. ;)\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO GET IT\r<br />Add item via console\r<br />&#34;Skull Head&#34;\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />REQUIREMENTS\r<br />Skyrim v1.9+ (duh)\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />RECOMMENDED INSTALL\r<br />Install with Mod Organizer &lt;3\r<br />\r<br />MANUAL INSTALL&#92;UNINSTALL\r<br />Extract the content from the .rar archive and place the files in &#34;Skyrim&#92;Data&#34; where the game is installed.\r<br />Example of default Skyrim installed location:\r<br />Windows x32\r<br />(C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;data&#92;\r<br />Windows x64\r<br />(C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;data&#92;\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />FILES AND FOLDERS\r<br />\r<br />Skull Head v1.0 readme.txt\r<br />Skull Head.esp\r<br />\r<br />Meshes&#92;theimmersion&#92;Outfit&#92;Skull Head&#92;Male&#92;\r<br />Human_1\r<br />\r<br />Meshes&#92;theimmersion&#92;SHARED&#92;\r<br />genericworldmodel\r<br />genericworldmodelf\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />DISCLAIMER\r<br />I am not responsible for any and all damages that arise from use of this mod.\r<br />Use at your own risk&#33;\r<br />\r<br />General Permission&#33;\r<br />You can do with the mod itself what ever you want (modify, improve or simplify) for personal use only.\r<br />However, You cant include or claim as Your own any modified or unmodified files and commertialize or reupload them outside &#34;Special Permisions&#33;&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Special Permissions&#33;\r<br />You may modify, include, reupload or otherwise use the following files and folders as You see fit.\r<br />(Do remember to rename them for your own mod to avoid conflicts.)\r<br />Plugin and Scripts.

I lack the knowhow to release it as i really want it so this is as far as it gets for now.\r<br />\r<br />FUTURE PLANS\r<br />Hoping to learn or to get help for:\r<br />Adding skulls for all playable races. Elfs, Kajiit, Argonians.\r<br />Adding enchantments like flee and intimidation to skulls.\r<br />Adding various skulls with effects, fire (skull burning), smoke , glowing eyes etc.\r<br />Adding Hair Styles from other hair mods if i find appropriate and get permissions.\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />MISCELLANEOUS\r<br />\r<br />So i dont exactly know how &#34;not safe for work&#34; and what not is.\r<br />Cuz i consider adults only not just b*obs and a*s but gore like open neck with spine and skull comming out if it as well. So.\r<br />I will put it as adult only content and not safe for work,\r<br />unless someone can confirm to me that this mod does not fall under those categories\r<br />so i can remove those limits and the mod gets a bit more exposure.\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />Original Author: theimmersion\r<br />Other Contributors: Luck for finding this in my HDD lost and found box. xD\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />[/center]",
