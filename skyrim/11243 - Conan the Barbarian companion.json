Think you sound like Arnold and got some free time to do voice acting for the greater good? Contact me!\r\n\r\n[size=18][color=red][b]Attention![/b][/color][/size]\r\nTo maximize the Conanization factor of the follower, use the Lore Friendly Armor mod and equip the barbarian armors - easily found on bandits - on Conan! [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6684](Found here! (Clickity click))[/url]\r\n[size=1]He was meant to wear the armor right away if you have the pack, but for some reason the CK did not like this solution. Will look into this later.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=18][color=red][b]About the mod:[/b][/color][/size]\r\nThis is a simple companion mod featuring an Arnold-near-lookalike Conan the Barbarian.\r\n\r\nI wanted to keep the rough Nord look, as I found all the male-beautification mods making everything really plastic-y and every man a virtual Ken-doll. We\\'re living in Skyrim here, not Barbieland.\r\n\r\nIf you find that Conan doesn\\'t look enough like Arnold, try to think of it as preserving the Skyrim lore and feel. Heh.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re using some of the beautification mods, I can\\'t guarantee Conan looking as he does in the pictures!\r\n\r\nFor now this is just a simple companion mod, as I just wanted a hulking barbarian as a companion for my mage. I\\'m not planning on making him able to be married as of now, but if people like this and want more, then why the heck not.\r\n\r\n[size=18][color=red][b]Where to find Conan[/b][/color][/size]\r\nConan will be residing inside the Bannered Mare in Whiterun, just next to the main entrance. Find him there.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nFor everyone having problem with a black/gray face, you need to use the console to change this.\r\nIt\\'s a well known bug in the CK, and we can\\'t really do anything about it now.\r\n\r\nYou can try and fix this using the console:\r\n\r\n1. Open the console with the tilde/half key (left of the number 1 key)\r\n2. Target Conan by clicking him\r\n3. Type \\\"setnpcweight 99\\\" without the \\\" marks into the console and press enter\r\n\r\nThis should fix the problem with a grey head. \r\n\r\n[size=7][color=red][b]Suggested mods:[/b][/color][/size]\r\nConan armors: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4793]Nexus link[/url]\r\nConan sword: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4217]Nexus link[/url]\r\nLore Friendly armors: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6684]Nexus link[/url]",
