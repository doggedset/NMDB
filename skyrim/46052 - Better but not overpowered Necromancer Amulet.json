  "descriptionHtml": "I felt that the default Necromancer's Amulet was way underpowered due to the heavy Health and Stamina regen penalty; however, I also felt the other mods that tried to \"fix\" the amulet made it overpowered, so I made my own version. The new stats are as follows:\r\n\r\n[b]Magicka + 50[/b]\r\n[b]Conjuration spells cost 25% less[/b]\r\n[b]Health and Stamina regen penalty of 25%[/b] (as opposed to 75% before)",
