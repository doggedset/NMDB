  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first attempt at adapting armor to another body. I hope to work my way through all of the LSAR Pack by Cotyounoyumev. At this time I haven&#39;t learned how to implement BBP. But I&#39;m working on it. Might be available in the somewhat near future.\r<br />\r<br />A vanilla replacer\r<br />\r<br />10/16/2013\r<br />Thanks for the feedback on the crazy textures of the two new files. I have removed them and brought the edited old one up until I can discover the reason for the file errors.\r<br />\r<br />10/12/2013\r<br />Version 2. \r<br />Fixed the 2 problem areas on the Robe and added 2 versions. \r<br />One with underwear and One without.\r<br />\r<br />10/7/2013\r<br />I&#39;ve identified 2 problem areas on the Robe. The fabric on the top of the left breast and the front of the skirt when crouching. I&#39;ll leave the file up. But going to fix those 2 items and upload a new version. \r<br />\r<br />Planned Update Order:\r<br />All Robes\r<br />Yarl Clothes\r<br />Fine Clothes\r<br />Merchant Clothes\r<br />Farmer Clothes\r<br />Dark Brotherhood (Maybe)\r<br />Thalmor (Maybe)\r<br />Redguard Clothes\r<br />Jester\r<br />Blacksmith\r<br />Barkeeper\r<br />Beggar\r<br />Prisoner\r<br />\r<br />Armors I haven&#39;t decided on as of yet. As I mostly just use the clothes from LSAR. Armors I tend to use from other sources. \r<br />Also there are some great Dark Brotherhood and Thalmor adaptations out there already so also on the fence.\r<br />\r<br />LSAR\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5564/?\r<br />Requirements: \r<br />Petrovich&#39;s Dream Girl body mesh, and any UNP-compatable body textures.\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41443//?",
