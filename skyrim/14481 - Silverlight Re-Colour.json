  "descriptionHtml": "A simple re-colour of jojjo\\'s awesome Silverlight Armor, with white feathers and light yellow-green gems. \r\nGorgeous bling!\r\n\r\nI have left out the Circlet as I don\\'t use it. I \\'ll try to remember to work on that soon. \r\nThe gems were actually re-textured using photos of opals, but it isn\\'t all that visible because of the glow. \r\nI canâ€™t remove the  (jarring to my eyes) glow from the gems or tone down the brightness of the armour. \r\nI would appreciate any help here, this is the first time I have done this kind of work. \r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nInstall Silverlight Armor by jojjo :\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10251\r\n\r\nThis tweak is done on the files from the Chainmail version of the armour. I have no idea if it will be compatible with the skimpy version. \r\n\r\nThen go to Data\\\\Textures\\\\Armor\\\\Silverlight and drop the contents of the zip file there, overwrite/replace all. \r\n\r\nIF YOU LIKE IT, SAY THANKS OR CLICK THE ENDORSE BUTTON\r\n\r\nAnd of course, thank & endorse jojjo if you haven\\'t already!\r\n\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION\r\nJust re-install jojjos\\' mod. \r\n\r\n\r\nNEXT: Blacklight !\r\n\r\nUPDATE: No black armor is possible to me, the glow of the armor seems coded in either in the mesh files or the esp file and without removing I cannot get the results I want. jojjo hasn\\'t offered any info on wheere the glow of the gems and armor is coming from, so I\\'ll abandon this idea for now.
