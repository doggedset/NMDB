This home is situated near Rifton at the borders of Skyrim. The home perfectly fits into the surrounding\r\nenvironment. To get the home you have to travel to the Location you can see either on the Screenshots here or in the download (where also a screenshot of the\r\nlocation was included).\r\nIt took me long times to find the right place for the home and I invested a lot of time to make it as deatiled as possible. I also learned from other genious\r\nmodders, that it\\'s sometimes better to use misc clutter and mix it with static. I also learned a lot about lightning and different types of new light sources.\r\nI hope you like the home and feel the magical touch it should give you.\r\n\r\nOnce you reached the home you will find it locked. NO WORRIES !! You can acquire the key. Just read the note near the entracne you shouldn\\'t miss it.\r\nInside the home you will find a lot of features and nice arrangments which I hope perfectly fit the mage themed character.\r\n\r\nI also included ofc. a smithing cellar, but it\\'s small, because a mage doesn\\'t need a lot of smithing skills. He just needs his spells and some clothes.\r\nTho the smithing cellar fits perfectly in to the style and theme of the house.\r\nThe house is built out of solstheim elements, which I thought would perfectly match with the theme I want to deliver.\r\nAlso the previous owner of the house is from Solstheim. \r\n\r\n[b]If you don\\'t find the key scroll down to the F.A.Q[/b]\r\nNow to the features !!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://img5.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/featuresr6bf0xueop.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=#00BFFF][u]Outside:[/u][/color]\r\n[i]Outside the house you will find a mystical ambient and also a lot of other nice eye catching features.[/i]\r\n- Leafs falling down\r\n- Wood chopping block\r\n- A well which leads to a cave\r\n- A lot of plants and trees\r\n- house fitting into the mountain\r\n- chimney for the forge\r\n\r\n[color=#00BFFF][u]Downstairs:[/u][/color]\r\n[i]Once you enter the house you will find a lot of mystical and magical lightning. The home should give you the feeling that you are a mage,\r\nwho is studying here. It\\'s a dark ambient which is illuminated by different light sources, to give you the special magical feeling.[/i]\r\n- unique looking enchanting table\r\n- 2 Mannequins\r\n- 1 Weapon rack\r\n- Resarch table with dead body\r\n- magical lightning sources\r\n- eating area\r\n- cooking area and storage\r\n- a riekling skeleton !\r\n- a shrine of Azura as pervious owner is a dark elf\r\n- overall mystical and nice ambient\r\n\r\n[color=#00BFFF][u]Upstairs:[/u][/color]\r\n[i]Upstairs you will find a possibility to sleep.
