  "descriptionHtml": "This is a player starter home that is ACTUALLY a starter home. It&#39;s not overpowered, it&#39;s not a cheat, it&#39;s not a spacious manor, it&#39;s not silly. This is NOT meant to be the one place for all your needs; no collection of every crafting station, no cluttering it with mannequins and weapons racks. It&#39;s simple and (hopefully) tasteful; a nice little nook for beginning players.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s an ancient Nordic dwelling nearby the Guardian Stones. Out front is the body of the hunter who once lived there; on his body are a journal and book explaining the history, as well as the key. Three Stone Watch has no loading cells; it is all part of the exterior worldspace.\r<br />\r<br />Its features include:\r<br />\r<br />**Wood chopping block out front.\r<br />**Grindstone out back.\r<br />**Tanning rack out back.\r<br />**Alchemy Lab.\r<br />**Bed.\r<br />**Two working bookshelves.\r<br />**A working mannequin.\r<br />**A working shield rack (above the door from the back balcony.\r<br />**Map marker. (Has to be discovered.)\r<br />**Breathtaking back balcony view over a lake.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]WARNINGS[/u]\r<br />\r<br />1. Once I encountered a problem where the exterior walls of the home disappeared. I was unable to reproduce this, but just in case, I&#39;m throwing this out there.\r<br />2. I auto-generated a navmesh, but (a) navmeshing is not my strength, and (b) navmeshing has been awkward in mods since one of the official patches (1.4, I think?). Followers may or may not be able to navigate.\r<br />3. The mannequin doesn&#39;t always seem to be on the ground level (for example, sunk into the floor). It still works, however.\r<br />4. Since this is in an EXTERIOR cell, with no loading, some computers may have a problem with it. It&#39;s not very cluttered, however, so it shouldn&#39;t be too bad, especially if you&#39;re not on a crappy rig that&#39;s barely able to run Skyrim to begin with.\r<br />5. The ONLY non-respawning containers are the big urn and the bookshelves. The two barrels and the two small urns inbetween the bed and the mannequin respawn; do NOT put your stuff in them, or you WILL lose it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]INSTALLATION[/u] [i](Manual)[/i]\r<br />\r<br />You will need an unzipping utility such as 7zip to extract the contents of the Zip file you downloaded.\r<br />\r<br />Extract the contexts of the zip file into your Skyrim/Data folder. There should not be any overwriting involved, as the only file in the zip is the .esp file.\r<br />\r<br />[u]INSTALLATION[/u] [i](Nexus Mod Manager)[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Just double-click it from the mod list, as usual for any mod you install and activate with the Manager.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]POSSIBLE CONFLICTS[/u]\r<br />\r<br />The only thing that should at all conflict with this mod is another mod that alters the Wilderness cell next to the Guardian Stones cell.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]CREDITS[/u]\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda for a great game\r<br />SkyrimNexus for a great site\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]PERMISSIONS[/u]\r<br />\r<br />You may use any part of this mod in a mod of your own, as long as you fulfill all of the following conditions:\r<br />\r<br />1.
