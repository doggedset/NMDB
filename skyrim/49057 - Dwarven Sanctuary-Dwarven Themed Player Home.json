  "descriptionHtml": "The Dwarven Sanctuary is a large player home located near Markarth. The map marker already appears on your map so you should be able to find it without any problems. It comes with everything you&#39;d expect from a player home such as a blacksmith forge, enchanter, alchemy, to a trophy room and much more. It is also mostly navmesh&#39;d so followers should usually go in without any issues. This is my first player home mod for Skyrim so some endorsements would be awesome. Please leave feedback in the comments and tell me if you find any bugs / glitches please. Thank you for downloading&#33; Also in the comments if you can tell me your opinion of the mod and what I could change to make it better because i&#39;m not done with this mod yet.\r<br />TO INSTALL---- either use nexus mod manager or drop everything in Skyrim&#39;s data folder.\r<br />(I just fixed a few problems with the mod and I plan to continue updating it by adding some more details and etc.) \r<br />[youtube]5_y7yu8WeNc[/youtube]\r<br />",
