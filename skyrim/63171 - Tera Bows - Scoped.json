  "descriptionHtml": "This MOD isn&#39;t really a very creative one and required from me nothing but patience, but it is a necessary asset for those who are using two other AMAZING mod works. Those are the real giants in which I stood on the shoulders.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4][u][b]Short Description - What this Mod Does:[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Adds a Craftable and Dropable Scoped Option for 24 of the 25 Bows provided from &#34;Tera Weapons Collection 1.1&#34; Series.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=4]Requirements:[/size][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim 1.9.32.0.8+ version, and Hearthfire DCL as glass is needed for some of the recipes.\r<br />\r<br />For this mod to work Properly, you [color=#ff0000][b]MUST[/b][/color] have two other Nexus mods installed:\r<br />\r<br />Scoped Bows from OutLaw666: (Download &#34;Scoped Bows v1.6_LEGENDARY&#34; option)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50528/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50528/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />TERA Weapons Collection for Skyrim from Iromizu: (Download &#34;TERA Weapons&#34; version 1.1 option)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27463/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27463/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Description:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1 - Update:\r<br />\r<br />- A small damage adjustment was made to scale it together with the Vanilla Scoped bows. I had the feeling that even if they are as cool as they can be, there&#39;s no incentive to use them if the damage is smaller than the other bows. This small boost will make them as effective as the other Scoped bows, but you can choose the Design you want.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0:\r<br />\r<br />For those craving to have fun using Bows without Crosshair, an amazing mod was created a while ago.\r<br />&#34;Scoped Bows&#34; from OutLaw666 which adds craftable scopes for original Bows from Skyrim and the DCLs.\r<br />\r<br />It was fun, beautiful and functional, but something happened: The bows from Tera Weapons collection were still beatiful, but now useless compared to the brand new Scoped bows. So, I had to make something about it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />So, this mod includes:\r<br />- A craftable Scoped Version of 24 the Bows added by TERA Weapons Collection. Can all be done on the forge, with the proper perks;\r<br />- A Leveled List was included, so you can find the bows around the world. (Pretty rare, tho)\r<br />- A Leveled List for TERA Weapons Collection was included too. The weapons can be found around the world, with a balanced difficulty I hope.\r<br />\r<br />[i][b]Note:[/b]\r<br />Xersteel Bow was NOT included on the list. Although it has a very interesting design, it was awful to use it with or without scopes. Adding the aim system without major clipping was kind of impossible to me, this mesh should be redone to be a bit more functional.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=4]Installation:[/size][/u]\r<br />\r<br />As I&#39;m still new on the modding field, there&#39;s only the manual installation option.\r<br />The Steps:\r<br />1) Download and Install Scoped Bows from OutLaw666 (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50528/?);\r<br />2) Download and Install Tera Weapons Collection from Iromizu (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27463/?);\r<br />3) Download and Unzip this MOD;\r<br />4) Place it on your Skyrim&#92;Data folder;\r<br />[color=#ff7700]5) It will REPLACE the &#34;TERA Weapons.esp&#34; file, overwrite it (but backup it first, in case you want to uninstall the mod);[/color]\r<br />6) Turn on the MOD on your favorite launcher:\r<br />7) Run LOOT to organize your loading order;\r<br />8) Run Skyrim;\r<br />9) Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[i][b]Note:[/b]\r<br />&#34;Dude, why not creating another ESP for this mod?&#34;\r<br />I don&#39;t know about you guys, but seriously I prefer to keep MOD list as compact as possible. Most of us are on the limit of the 255 mods options. So, it will save you a slot and nobody will have the labour of merging MODs.\r<br />I don&#39;t see the necessity to do it, but if anyone does, feel free to open the CK and get your hands dirty&#33;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][color=#ff0000]Note-2:[/color][/i][/b]\r<br />If you&#39;re using the Previous Leveled List I made here:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60606/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60606/?[/url]\r<br />You can overwrite it without any problems, the List will be kept and you&#39;ll be able to find ALL Tera weapons around the world too.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Common Issue:[/b]\r<br />&#34;My arrows are NOT going on the center of the target&#33;&#34;\r<br />The center is perfectly aligned with the Crosshair, so, if it&#39;s not reaching the center, what is wrong is probably your arrow settings.\r<br />Try to change/add this on your [color=#ff0000]/Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Skyrim.ini[/color] file: (Backup first, of course)\r<br />[color=#b6d7a8]\r<br />[color=#ffff00][Actor] \r<br /> fVisibleNavmeshMoveDist=12288.0000 \r<br /> [Combat] \r<br /> fMagnetismStrafeHeadingMult=0.0 \r<br /> fMagnetismLookingMult=0.0 \r<br /> f1PArrowTiltUpAngle=0.7 \r<br /> f3PArrowTiltUpAngle=0.7[/color][/color]\r<br />\r<br />fVisibleNavmeshMoveDist - increases the distance arrows fly;\r<br />fMagnetism - Turns off the aim assist;\r<br />ArrowTiltUpAngle - Makes the dot or crosshair the center of the target, not slight above it;\r<br />\r<br />Thanks for Enjoying, Folks&#33;\r<br />And support Open-Source stuff all around the World&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Credits:[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Bethesda[/b] for this damn amazing Game;\r<br />[b]Bethesda[/b] again, for sharing with us the resources, allowing creativity around the world to flourish. That&#39;s the business model of the future;\r<br />[b]OutLaw666[/b] for his great MOD;\r<br />[b]Iromizu[/b] for his great conversion;",
