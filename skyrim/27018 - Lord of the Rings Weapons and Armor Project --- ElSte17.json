  "descriptionHtml": "Hello everyone, this is a personal project I am starting now ( I only have one weapon done but I figured there was no reason not to make it available already). \r\n\r\nI realize that Isilmeriel has already made many very nice weapons from the LOTR series, but I don\\'t think she will make ALL of them ( nor has she made any armor). So basically, when I\\'m not working on the Alagaesia Total Conversion mod, I\\'ll be adding more models to this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is there so far? :\r\n\r\n- Easterling\r\n- Halberd --------- (craft at forge, 2 iron and 2 steel ingots)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do I plan on doing next?\r\n- It\\'ll be tough, but the rather complex Easterling Torso Armor\r\n\r\nHope you like it, feel free to make balancing suggestions.",
