  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=2]I'm happy to present to all of you a follower I've worked hard on:\n<br />[/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][font=Georgia][size=6]Sinéad[/size][/font][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://78.media.tumblr.com/b4c6d33ea44ce4fe53e02eed97ac1b93/tumblr_p826qfBRQd1sjmkkro1_1280.png[/img]\n<br />[center]\n<br />[youtube]CvISmyLXZpQ[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[i][center][size=2]\"[i][/i][i]Sinéad was born in Markarth after the Reachmen successfully rose against the Nords and claimed the city for themselves. Her mother was one of Madanach's finest warriors, her father a simple Breton miner who supported the Reachmen's cause. They hoped to raise her safely as a citizen of the new kingdom, but it was not to be; in what would come to be called the Markarth Incident, Ulfric Stormcloak led a militia to take the city back for the Nords. Sinéad was smuggled out of the city during the conflict, as her parents knew that not even children would be spared in the bloodbath to come. Her guardians, an Imperial and an Orc sympathetic to the Reachmen, took her to Cyrodiil and ended up settling down in Bruma where one of their families owned property. Perhaps they had ambitions of returning to Markarth someday, but when they learned of how thoroughly the Nords had stamped out the rebellion they decided to remain in Bruma.[/i]\n<br />[/size][/center][/i][center][size=2][i]\n<br />Eventually they decided to tell Sinéad of her true heritage and how her parents died. They had raised her as older siblings might raise a younger one, and so they believed she was owed the truth of her family. She seemed to take it quite well at first, though this may have been due to her unfamiliarity with the concepts they presented her with. But time and education led her to become more emotionally involved in the situation, as books like \"The Bear of Markarth\" became publicly circulated and Ulfric Stormcloak became more and more of a controversial figure in reports from Skyrim. Sinead developed a fiery hatred of Ulfric and all that he represented, to the point where she began to dislike Nords who had done nothing wrong. She became restless and resorted to petty thievery as an outlet, stealing valuables from Nord families in Bruma because she felt they were somehow looking down on her. She might have even run away to Skyrim to join the Forsworn, had she not been arrested for theft.\n<br />\n<br />Time in prison served to cool her temper and she befriended the elderly Nord who brought her meals. He was always kind to her and even reported on her good behavior to the warden. Ultimately she was given a choice: continue to rot in jail until her sentence ended or get out early to serve in the Imperial Legion. She chose the Legion and despite a rough start, during which she earned a reputation for stubbornness and ferocity, she became a capable Auxiliary specializing as a scout. But a twist of fate saw her given orders to march North, for civil war had erupted in Skyrim and the Legion was needed to fight the insurgency... which was being led by Ulfric Stormcloak.\n<br />\n<br />Now she is waiting in the heart of Skyrim, in the city of Whiterun, for new orders from Tullius... or perhaps an adventurer in need of her skills, someone who might even fight at her side as a Legionnaire. As much as she would love to journey straight to Markarth and start hunting for clues of her past, she's almost afraid to look directly at the ugliness of it all, for hatred from both Forsworn and Nords has twisted the Reach into a dangerous battleground full of blood, dark magic and death.\"[/i]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />- her backstory, written by yours truly.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://78.media.tumblr.com/4f113df06aa00610da9a02b54b46a475/tumblr_p89wfwrHni1sjmkkro1_1280.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]THANK YOU FOR MAKING HER A HOT FILE!﻿[/size][size=5] I'M SO AMAZED![/size][/center]\n<br />[center][b]The Basics:[/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />Sinéad comes in a set of Imperial studded armor, armed with an Imperial sword and bow plus a few spells and an amulet of Kynareth. Her combat style is \"Forsworn.\" She will level with you up to 100 and has a number of useful perks including Light Foot. She is also essential and marriageable. Her voicetype is Young Eager, because I tried Eventoned and it... just didn't fit. Probably had something to do with having Lydia along too :P\n<br />\n<br />There's no custom quest or schmancy features because I know zip about any of that. I'm currently doing a playthrough with Sinéad as my character and that's where that big ol' backstory came from, lol.\n<br />\n<br />She comes in two flavors: with Forsworn warpaint and without. When I play and it's time to fight some Stormcloaks, I open up RaceMenu and apply the paint, because she wants to intimidate any Stormcloaks who might recognize it. Yes, I'm this much of an RP-er.\n<br />\n<br />Her body type is basic UNP and she has special textures, with freckles from the excellent [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86208/?]Freckle Mania 2[/url] and a couple of scratches from the amazing [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31954/?]BI Phenotypes[/url]. Because let's face it, someone in her profession will have a few scratches.\n<br />\n<br />Basically: she's supposed to be a cute but tough character, someone who definitely belongs in some good armor instead of a bikini, and someone who has strong convictions about which side of the Civil War she's on. You're free to do whatever you want with her in your own game, of course, but those were my intentions behind this follower.\n<br />\n<br />Many many [i]many[/i] heartfelt thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/20544984]mrhaar[/url] and [url=http://nim-sky.tumblr.com/]nim-sky[/url] for answering my cry for help regarding the shiny eye issue, now I finally know how to fix it and Sinead no longer has eldritch flashy mirror eyes. Go check out their stuff, it's awesome.\n<br />\n<br />Also thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/48942638]banzerhepbern[/url] for giving Sinead her own race and removing my edits to the vanilla Breton race.",
