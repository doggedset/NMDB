  "descriptionHtml": "I realy like the look of the Armor Ketwaroo designed, but it came only for CBBE.\r\nSo I watched Nightasy\\'s Armor modding guide (If you are reading this: Thank you very much.. it would have taken me weeks to make this without your guide) and made a UNP version of it.\r\nFor now I made the version without belly strip, because it was for my personal use. But some people asked me to upload it so here it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first Armor I made so I bet there are sill some flaws here and there, but it works pretty fine for me.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nv0.5 this is mostly the same armor mesh (just fittet around the breast area)\r\ni replaced the \\\"pushed up\\\" body with the standard UNP body, because some people seemed to want it (and it was not much work :P)\r\n\r\nOriginal Mod:\r\n[url=5411]Somewhat Skimpy DragonScale Armour with CBBEv2 version[/url] by Ketwaroo D Yaasir\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nObviously [url=6709]demon99\\'s UNP[/url]\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nThe usual... Extract the archive into your Skyrim folder.\r\nIf you already have an alternative female dragonscale model and want to replace it, hit overwrite. If you don\\'t want to replace it you don\\'t need to download this file to begin with :P.\r\nUninstall:\r\nDelete dragonscalearmorf_0.nif and dragonscalearmorf_1.nif from the \\\"[Skyrim-folder]\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\armor\\\\dragonscale\\\" folder",
