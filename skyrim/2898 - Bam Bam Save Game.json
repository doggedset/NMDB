  "descriptionHtml": "You are a child with a giant\\'s club. Anyone who knows the Flinstones knows Bam Bam, and I thought I\\'d goof around and make him. \r\n\r\nHe is level 1, in Helgen Keep still. He has a Giant Club, but I wouldn\\'t suggest using a different weapon or you\\'ll lose it forever. Or, you could just use the un-playable weapons mod and it should appear in your inventory.\r\n\r\nThe list of bugs with the save are these:\r\nEquipped apparel will not show up, but you will receive all effects normally.\r\nYou cannot un-equip the Giant Club or it will disappear forever.\r\nWhen you load the save, it may give you a nonexistent content error, just click yes and load it anyways.\r\n\r\nThis is just a silly little save to play around with.\r\n",
