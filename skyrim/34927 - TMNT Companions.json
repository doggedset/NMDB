  "descriptionHtml": "Since I saw TMNT Armor by Higeyosi, I was filled with glee and nostalgia for the 1980s series that I had to watch it again.\r\n\r\nI though \\\"kowabunga!\\\" and made this mod in honor of Higeyosi\\'s efforts.\r\n\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/34927-1-1366223338.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nAnd for those who are also still playing Oblivion or planning on going back very soon, look at this:\r\n\r\nNinja Turtle Race by Corthian\r\nhttp://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/26680\r\n\r\nThese are basically 4 Argonian companions called \r\n\r\n- Leonardo\r\n- Donatello\r\n- Raphael\r\n- Michalangelo\r\n\r\nAll these party dudes can be found in the Ragged Flagon in Riften as a starting point. \r\n\r\nTheir stats are equivelent to thier onscreen counterparts but i will tweak, prod and upgrade next update.\r\n\r\nDonatello\\'s nose clips through the face mask of his so that will be fixed asap.. *FIXED*\r\n\r\nI wanted each \\\"turtle\\\" to be similar as they are physically but slight differences to reflect thier personalities and lifestyles they lead e.g. Raphael is aggresive, quick to temper and dleves straight in whist Leonardo is the leader, acute, wise beyond his years, patient and understanding. Mikie justs wanna eat pizza and party.\r\n\r\nArmor seperate and can be found here:\r\n\r\nTMNT Armor by Higeyosi\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34903\r\n\r\nSome Weapons can be found here:\r\nJapanese Weapon Pack by malibu1039\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34080",
