  "modName": "Christchex Skill Specialization",
  "summary": "Adds Major Skill perks that give skill advance bonus/detriments and unlocks top-tier perks.",
  "descriptionHtml": "WHAT THIS MOD DOES:\r\nEach skill tree now has a new perk associated with that skill referred to as a \\\"Major Skill\\\" choice. Each of these perks increases the speed in which you gain levels in said skill by 25% while lowering all other skill rates by 3%. These effects are cumulative; or if you prefer, \\\"Stacking.\\\" What this means is that if you choose two major perks, you get a 22% increase instead of the 25%, and all other skills will level 6% slower. In addition, the best perks in each skill tree require their related \\\"Major Skill\\\" perk in addition to their vanilla requirements.\r\n\r\nWHY THIS MOD:\r\nI was unhappy to see classes and birthsigns go. Though, the new perk system is Skyrim is an adequate replacement for the previous installments class system, I still find my characters becoming more of a ambiguous character as I progress in levels... therefor, I decided before the creation kit came out that I would set out to rectify the issues I have towards this new system. This mod, is a small part of a larger mod I was/am scrapped/rebuilt/working on. In case I never fulfill my desire fully, or if/when I do, others find it to be too much, I decided to release this much simpler idea.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\nuse 7zip to retrieve .esp file from the void of compression and place it in your skyrim/data folder, and you\\'ll also likely need it to be loaded last on your mod list.\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY:\r\nWill not be compatible with any other mod that alters the skill trees themselves. May provide compatibility patches for some of those mods later on.\r\n\r\nCHANGE LOG:\r\n3/5/2012: Added a separate version with 50% skill level boosts and 5% skill level penalties.\r\n\r\nFUTURE CHANGES:\r\nThis mod is a small aspect of a larger perk mod I have been working on and will be absorbed and undergo a name change; however, I will keep this mod up as an alternate version for those you may like this concept and also like to keep things simpler.\r\n\r\nI made another mod at http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12221 that changes the warrior, mage, and thief standing stones from giving skill level bonuses to health, magicka, and stamina bonuses, respectively. I made this mod to go with my skill specialization mod.\r\n\r\n",
