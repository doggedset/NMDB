As the pics show just stand behind her to steal it with no problems (no crouching required).\r<br />note that even though the Amulet will cure any and all diseases it will not prevent you from getting them, I wear mine all the time and when I contract something then I just take it off then put it back on and disease gone.\r<br />the only benefit really to wear and just leave it on is other than you know right where it is, it gives a nice glowing effect that the NPCs around you will surely comment on",
