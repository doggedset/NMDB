  "summary": "Tired of having to abandon your Wolf Armor because it doesn\\\\\\'t compete with high level armors? Instead of just buffing the Wolf Armor, why not reconstruct it from a different material entirely?",
  "descriptionHtml": "Background:\r\nI like the Wolf Armor a lot, so I went hunting through the various Wolf Armor Retextures. I saw two that were incredibly inspiring: the Wolf Armor Dark Retexture by Reaper, and the Darker Wolf Armor by Venatoris. Venatoris\\'s had beautiful silver accents, but I wasn\\'t sure if I liked the brown leather/blue fur look of it, and Reaper\\'s fur was awesome, but the plates seemed dull compared to Venatoris\\'s. So I combined the two, and then a thought struck me: why am I making what is essentially fancy steel armor black? Why do I have a separate mod to buff the armor rating of standard Wolf Armor? Isn\\'t there a way to do this in a lore-friendly manner?\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nThis mod includes a standalone armor called the Ebony Wolf Armor. All four (five if you count the lady version) pieces are included, and all are temperable at a workbench with ebony ingots. You must have the Ebony Smithing perk to get the most out of tempering it, just like with regular ebony armor. Also, the weight/armor values reflect the relationship between the original Wolf Armor and Steel Armor: Ebony Wolf Armor offers the same protection and value as Ebony Armor, but is lighter weight. Currently, the armor is only accessible via console. \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nSimply use NMM or drag all of the files into the Data folder. In-game, use the console command \\\"player.add item\\\" and the following codes:\r\nXX001000  -  Boots\r\nXX001001  -  Cuirass\r\nXX001002  -  Gloves\r\nXX001003  -  Helm\r\nWhere XX is the load order. Alternatively, just type \\\"help wolf\\\" and scroll like crazy.\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\nV1.1\r\nFixed incorrect perk order (Thanks Anonnumberzero for the heads-up)\r\nFixed helmet loading the wrong texture\r\n\r\nComing Soon:\r\nPlacing the armor in the Underforge\r\nMaking it craftable if you have a mod that lets you craft the original Wolf Armor\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is my first mod ever, and I would love feedback on it. Please report any bugs you find so I can clean them up. Also, if you have any suggestions for other material swaps, let me know. I\\'d rather not cross light/heavy, since I feel like that\\'s lore breaking (so no glass Nordic Carved armor) but anything else goes! In fact, next mod is going to be turning Chillrend into a Stalhrim weapon (no appearance modifier, just changing the temper recipe) and making Chillfend, a Stalhrim/glass armor set based on Chillrend. Yes, that is the lamest pun I\\'ve ever made. \r\n\r\nCredits: \r\nVentasoris\\' Darker Wolf Armor http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6398 \r\nReaper\\'s Wolf Armor Dark Retexture http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25270\r\nGo endorse their mods! I wouldn\\'t have made this without seeing their mods first!",
