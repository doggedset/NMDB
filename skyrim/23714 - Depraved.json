At the moment I am not playing Skyrim, but somewhere down the line I may try and fix the issues with this mod. If someone else would like to, feel free. \r\n\r\nApologies for any inconvenience to players of this mod and thank you to everyone that gave feedback.\r\n\r\nFor those that want it in a more stable but earlier version, Depraved BETA at \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20296\r\n\r\nSee my other much more stable 'The Drunkards Drinks' mod at. \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16750 \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nFatalisticZero",
