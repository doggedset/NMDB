  "descriptionHtml": "A very basic follower.\r<br />A dark elf that can be found in Dragonsreach.\r<br />His high one-Handed and heavy armor skills complement his starting equipment of Blades armor (minus helmet) and Blades sword well. He is also capable of using unrelenting force and Fire breath shouts.\r<br />As I said hes very simple so he uses the default dark elf voice. He&#39;s intended as a powerful follower to assist early-game and new players.",
