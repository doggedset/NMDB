  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod so tell me how i did.\r\nIf you enjoy blood magic then you might like this mod.\r\nI made several blood spells for use with blood mage characters.\r\n\r\nThey all use the \\\"Drain Life\\\" spell animation and are all Novice level because I don\\'t know how to change that in CK. If you can offer any ideas then please let me know. I would post screenshots but they are all messed up, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThe spells include:\r\n\r\nBoil Blood\r\nBoil the blood of your foes so they burst into flames and then drain them dry.\r\n\r\nBlood Freeze\r\nFreeze the blood of your enemies and cause their veins to crack then drain their blood.\r\n\r\nShocking Blood\r\nUse an enemies own blood to electrocute them as you drain their blood.\r\n\r\nBlood Sap\r\nDrain a small amount of blood from your foes.\r\n\r\nBlood Drain\r\nDrain blood from your foes.\r\n\r\nBlood Vacuum\r\nSteal massive amounts of blood from your foes.\r\n\r\nINSTALL\r\nJust drop the files into your Data Folder.\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL\r\nJust take them back out.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you want a Blood Mage Class then I recommend this mod by phorgotten99\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3405",
