  "summary": "I changed the Main menu,Combat and Boss Music to a more suitable genre for me anyway, this is a personal choice, but thought I would share with all of you.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Main Menu, Combat, and Boss music replacer, the band is ANGELMAKER the songs are taken from their album &#34;Decay&#34; yes its the whole album, and some other surprises by them :) and they can be found here https://www.facebook.com/angelmakerband . I have permission to post these songs in this format. \r<br />\r<br />Granted this music isn&#39;t for everyone but its for me, and a select few others , if you like it please share , and feel free to stop by their page and say hello.\r<br />\r<br />You can download Manually and copy and paste into your Skyrim folder or use Nexus Manager.\r<br />\r<br />If you install Manually, make sure  you back up the existing intro music first, renaming works in case this isn&#39;t your cup if tea.\r<br />\r<br />And I would also like to thank Sparrow Prince for his Smoking Hot Main Menu Mod, which adds nicely to this one, he can be found here http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52236/?0\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />NOTE&#33;&#33;... It works may take awhile to start cycling through but its been tested:) Just hang back and play it loud.",
