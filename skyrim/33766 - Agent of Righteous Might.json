ARM offers player a new opportunity to get involve in the service of Stendarr, the God of Righteous Might and Merciful Forbearance. The player will be given a series of high risk missions to bring down a cult who once doomed the world of Tamriel at the end of 3rd era.\r<br />\r<br />The mod is built with high compatibility in mind --- during the 10 months of development period, only 2 interior cells and 4 exterior blocks have been altered from Skyrim.esm. Check with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25859]TES5Edit[/url] if you are in doubt. [i] (Not a single record of Error/Circulator Leveled List reported from TES5Edit 3.0.29) [/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u] Background Story [/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Since the beginning of the 4th era, holy knights and brave warriors have united under the banner of Stendarr to eradicate the enemies of the Nine --- calling themselves Vigilants of Stendarr. The Vigilants uphold the will of the Nine by slaying any and all who show disregard for life and mercy. \r<br />\r<br />Many decades ago, prior to the event of Skyrim, an old imperial veteran named Nirtius Pontanian and his five shield brothers joined the Vigilants and engaged in the most dangerous missions. They raided encampments of witches, cleared caverns inhabited by necromancers, and purified fortresses crawling with werewolves and daedras. \r<br />\r<br />It wasn&#39;t long before Nirtius saw that battling these foes resulted in large numbers of casualties amongst his comrades. It seemed to him there was a better way to carry out the mission. Instead of full-on combat he would disguise himself, infiltrate the enemy --- and then destroy them from within. Quickly. Quietly. Safely.\r<br />\r<br />Nirtius, his shield brothers, and those others who trusted him left the Vigilants of Stendarr and founded their own faction, calling themselves the Agents of Righteous Might. Since then, the Agents have successfully used their tactics to infiltrate and destroy numerous unholy factions while suffering the rare casualty within their band of followers.\r<br />\r<br />However, not everything has gone as Nirtius expected. A particularly critical mission against a remnant of the Mythic Dawn went disastrously, resulting in the mortal injury of his most trusted shield brother. Since then Nirtius regularly plots missions to infiltrate the Mythic Dawn but has yet to taste success.\r<br />\r<br />Notwithstanding that he has, nevertheless, come to learn two important facts: \r<br />\r<br />These remnants of the Mythic Dawn are not ordinary daedra worshipers like the ones he had hunted in the past. They are much more organized and disciplined. And, to make matters worse, it also just so happens there is a traitor among the Agents. \r<br />\r<br />Nirtius has started looking for an outsider --- someone with the skill of an assassin and the heart of a martyr... \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2omBL5Cdfc][i] Youtube: Nirtius&#39;s Introduction [/i][/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u] What to Expect [/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Epic adventure requiring both exceptional skill and will to sacrifice.\r<br />[*] Approximately 3-5 game play hours involving a role of an undercover agent.
