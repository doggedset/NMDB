  "descriptionHtml": "Pretty simple mod, just the .slot file, screenshots, and a readme with installation instructions.\r<br />\r<br />I apologize for the quality of the screenshots. My computer will only run Skyrim at 800x600 on Low quality. If anyone wants to upload screenshots using a better graphics setup, to really bring out the true beauty, I&#39;d be more than willing to use those as the main images - with full credit to the uploader, of course&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Also, if anyone wants to make a follower, enemy, romance option, etc., based on her, go right ahead. I&#39;ll probably even use whatever mod you come up with&#33; Just make sure to credit me for the original face. Or don&#39;t, I actually don&#39;t really care.",
