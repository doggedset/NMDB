  "descriptionHtml": "A forum user at UESP.net was saying how Legendary doesn\\'t make things any harder, just longer since the damage multipliers of the PC go down as the difficulty goes up. Instead he suggested the PC multipliers should stay at 1 while the enemies\\' multipliers continue to go up. All this mod does is keep the player\\'s damage multiplier at 1x on difficulties greater than Easy.\r\n\r\nPC Damage Mulitipliers with Mod:\r\nNovice - 2x\r\nApprentice - 1.5x\r\nAdept - 1x\r\nExpert - 1x\r\nMaster - 1x\r\nLegendary - 1x\r\n\r\nEnemy Damage Multipliers Are The Same as in Vanilla:\r\nNovice - .5x\r\nApprentice - .75x\r\nAdept - 1x\r\nExpert - 1.5x\r\nMaster - 2x\r\nLegendary - 2.5x\r\n\r\nThanks goes out to KryptonianBlood for the idea!",
