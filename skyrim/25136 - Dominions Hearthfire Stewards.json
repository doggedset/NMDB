  "summary": "This mod adds three new NPCs who can become stewards.  Each of these NPCs are located in the hold near each of the land locations, 1 in Falkreath, 1 in Dawnstar, and 1 in Morthal.  There are also seven new NPC, 1 in Solitude, 1 in Markarth, 1 in Windhelm, 1 in Winterhold, 1 in Riften, and 2 in Whiterun.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Not a big mod, just adds three NPC, each of them either in Falkreath, Morthal, or Dawnstar. I was not wanting to use one of the default companions as a steward, or one from one of my other mods, so I created three to fill in. Each NPC attempts to be lore-friendly to the area they are added in.\n<br />\n<br />Here are the NPC:\n<br />Craeti Valeius - Imperial female who has just arrived in Falkreath, looking for some sort of estate management role within Skyrim.\n<br />Fryfnhill - Nord female who has just arrived in Dawnstar, looking for some sort of estate management role within Skyrim.\n<br />Jeande - Breton male who has just arrived in Morthal, looking for some sort of estate management role within Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />Bun-Za - Argonian male who is retiring from his work at the College in Winterhold, looking for some sort of work with his past management experience.\n<br />Ennah - Redguard male who is in between estate management jobs, his previous being in Solitude, looking for someone to hire him on again.\n<br />Eradra - Wood elf male who is looking for some sort of management position, with his previous store ownership before the civil war situation, and is currently residing in Windhelm.\n<br />Heceril - High elf male who is looking to branch out of managing finances from the local Markarth treasury.\n<br />Madali Indaram - Dark elf female who is looking to use her farm management experience to land a position of managing a noble's household, leaving Whiterun behind.\n<br />Umbraam Bar - Orc female who just arrived in Riften, looking to apply her former leadership experience towards a steady management position.\n<br />Zahraji - Khajit female who just arrived in Whiterun, looking to apply her former leadership experience towards a steady management position.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />What is added:\n<br />-3 NPC: 1 in Falkreath, 1 in Dawnstar, 1 in Morthal\n<br />-7 New NPCs: 1 in Solitude, 1 in Markarth, 1 in Windhelm, 1 in Winterhold, 1 in Riften, 2 in Whiterun\n<br />\n<br />Known Issues:\n<br />-The voices for the new NPC are rehashed of the previous release, Bethesda released very few voice types for the Hearthfire content.\n<br />-The stewards will not go to sleep, believe this is a bug in Hearthfire itself.\n<br />Outside of the above quirks, none that I am aware of.\n<br />-UFO USERS: Dismiss your follower after asking them to become a steward. They will do their steward duties afterwards.\n<br />\n<br />Note:\n<br />1.3 has all A.I. as non-essential, while 1.4 makes them all essential.Â  I recommend 1.3 for more realism, and 1.4 if you want the immersion but don't want to worry about the NPCs.\n<br />\n<br />Revision History:\n<br />v 1.4:\n<br />-Makes all NPCs essential\n<br />v 1.3:\n<br />-Changed A.I. to be more combat helpful instead of sitting back.\n<br />-Changed the Argonian to reflect his College background.\n<br />v 1.2:\n<br />-Added seven new NPC: 1 in Solitude, 1 in Markarth, 1 in Windhelm, 1 in Winterhold, 1 in Riften, 2 in Whiterun\n<br />v 1.1:\n<br />-Changed Fryfnhill's voice away from Condescending voice type.\n<br />\n<br />Note: Does not require Hearthfire. They can be companions, but they are designed with the mindset of becoming a steward.\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />Tamriel Rebuilt - Name Generator\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Follow me on Facebook for updates: [url=https://www.facebook.com/ArronDominionProductions/]Arron Dominion Productions[/url]",
