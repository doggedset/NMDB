  "descriptionHtml": "As a Game of Thrones fan I decided to model my guy after Ned Stark, I thought it came out pretty good so I gave Jaime Lannister a shot...\r\nI\\'m not very happy with how he came out but I am going to include him anyway since it took me so long. \r\n\r\nBoth saves are right after character creation and they are named Eddard Stark and Jaime Lannister. Just drop them in your saves folder. Hope you like!\r\n\r\nMods i am I\\'m using are No More Blocky Face, Detailed Faces, Detailed Lips, and High Quality Eyes by Xenius. They are not required but great mods so go get them.\r\n\r\nI may do other characters so feedback is welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: I darkened Ned\\'s hair and made a few small tweaks. see pic\r\nI released Jamie Lannister separately http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1012\r\n",
