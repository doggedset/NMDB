  "descriptionHtml": "I never liked Wood Elf eyes in Skyrim, yes, it\\'s kind of lore-related, but I don\\'t care! I want my traditional Forest Elf! \r\nSo, I redid the eyes, using Capucine\\'s excellent eye textures as a base, and now you too can be traditional Elf! \r\nIt did really bother me enough to cause me to avoid playing an Elf at the start of my game, which bummed me out, hopefully for others with similar tastes, this will help!\r\n\r\nOnly for Wood Elves, replaces -all- of the black-eyes-with-browns with four different color-types.\r\n\r\nAs usual, I am not the mastermind behind the original textures, credit goes to Capucine,  very high-quality work, my only regret is having to down-scale them to the low-quality Bethesda base textures. >_< ",
