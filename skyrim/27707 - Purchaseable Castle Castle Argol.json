You have to buy the key and the Parts of the Castle. Like a Player House. You can add a Farm, Shops, Houses, Military and even a Treasury Camber. You can find the teleport on the map.\r\nThe key can be bought from the guy standing in front of the Castle.\r\n\r\nIf it doesn\\'t work try to download it manually.\r\n\r\n1. Parts of the Castle\r\n1.1 Shops: Includes a jewelry shop, a butcher, a blacksmith, an Inn,  and a brewery.\r\nThe workers are Includet.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2 Military: Adds several protections, an outpost (follow the way to the right) and guards.\r\n\r\n1.3 Trasury Camber: Adds a Treasury Camber with Gold, Lockers, Soul Gems, etc.\r\n\r\n1.4 Houses: Includes the player house, the house of Green Dogs, and Cordeen\\'s (the blacksmith)\r\n                 House. Also it spawns some citizens.\r\n\r\n1.5 Farm This part is a wind mill, a wood saw and some plants. \r\n\r\n2. Your Player house is basicly like Jorvaskr and adds everything a player house should have.\r\n    Maybe you\\'ll even find the (little) secret door. Your housecarl is standing next to the throne.\r\n \r\n3. Your guards are mages, archers and normal fighters.\r\n\r\n4. Plans: I want to make a Dwanguard edition with a Troll Farm etc.\r\n\r\n5. The cannon only works if you\\'re activating the leven and then you have to go into a house. It\\'ll work then. \r\n\r\n6. Incompatible with BBLS\r\n\r\n5. Any questions or suggestions in the comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
