  "summary": "A piece of clothing(coronet to be precise) that removes the cool-down time of shouts.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A small mod I made just to explore the shouts without restrictions. Simply put the file in the data-folder found in Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim and you are good to go. The item itself is found in Whiterun. Go to Hall of the Dead, and search the torches standing by the door straight forward. You may use the mod as you see fit without asking me.\r\n\r\nAll content found within the file is property of Zenimax Inc. and Bethesda Softworks.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, Aggrocult\r\n\r\nUpdate; The item is marked as stolen when you pick it up, sorry bout that. Also, it says 20% reduction but it\\'s closer to 500%. I.e, all shouts cooldown instantly.",
