Jump boost and Heat Vision.\r\n\t\tUpdated my script a little bit as well.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t*\tIn my next update, if needed, I will add Silver Hand to the worlds random encounter spawn lists.\r\n\t\tWon\\'t that make you shed you\\'re skin?\r\n\t\tAfter I\\'m satisfied with how the Silver affects us, both weapons and if necessary the Silver Hand themselves\r\n\t\tI\\'ll begin work on a toggle method for switching in and out of transformations.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t*\tAnyone have any name suggestions for the lair? I\\'ve got a few idea\\'s, however I\\'d like you\\'re opinions on the subject.\r\n\t\tThat way I can stop pun calling it the Were-Cave\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\n     Mod Description\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nThis mod aims to improve werewolves in every aspect making\r\nthem viable to play on master difficulty, or with difficulty enhancement\r\nmods such as Deadly Dragons.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is not designed around any mod that causes random and\r\nunpredictable level scaling on enemies such as Wars in Skyrim.\r\nIf you use level scalers, you might find an enemy every now\r\nand then who likes to smash you\\'re face.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD CHANGES:\r\n- More enemies in the world will now carry Silver weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\nPassive Effects (Human Form, some carry over to transformation)\r\n*********************\r\n- Silver weapons do double damage to us in human or wolf form.\r\n\tVampires/Undead are not modified by this.\r\n- Health Regeneration rate is increased by 75%.\r\n- +20 Unarmed Damage (This does affect werewolf claw damage.)\r\n- +10 Melee Damage (This affects 1h/2h weapons. Does not affect wolf form.)\r\n- Bonus 50 to carrying capacity.\r\n- Under the moonlight Werewolves gain increased Health, \r\n\tStamina, and Regeneration (Currently 10-4am until CK expands it,\r\n\t+100/100/50%/50%)\r\n- 50% Stamina regen bonus added for human form.\r\n- Ring of Hircine provides a bonus now. Check \\\"Totem Abilities & Ring of Hircine\\\" section below.\r\n\tEffects work as long as you have it in you\\'re inventory.\r\n- Nightvision toggle, works in transformation if you cast it first.\r\n\r\nWerewolf Form\r\n*************\r\n- Transforming causes NPCs up to level 28 within 75 yards to be\r\n  feared for 5 seconds\r\n  \r\n- During the transformation, blood poisons are purged from you\\'re system.\r\n\tThis is not a resistance to poison as human or werewolf, just that the act\r\n\tof transforming into the beast purges any poisons in you\\'re system.\r\n  \r\n- Beast Form no longer has a cooldown allowing it to be used more\r\n  than once a day.\r\n  \r\n- Health regeneration rate is increased 200% (75% human form + 125% transformed)\r\n\r\n- Feeding on a body restores up to 750 health total. While feeding\r\n  nearby NPCs up to level 28 and within 25 yards will be feared \r\n  for 1 second. Activates Blood Frenzy.\r\n  \r\n- Blood Frenzy, for 9 seconds after feasting on a corpse you gain a 100% base damage bonus.\r\n\tThis activates a graphical affect on the user to show them how long they have before frenzy ends.\r\n  \r\n- Feeding restrictions have been altered, you can now feed on vampires in addition to the normal\r\n\thumanoid victims.\r\n  \r\n- up to 58% Magic Resistance has been added during transformation.\r\n  Scales while leveling.\r\n  \r\n- 13% movement speed buff while transformed (3% from human, 10% additional when transformed)\r\n\r\n- Power Attack while running (The knockback stagger) now provides a 25% chance to paralyze\r\n\tthe target for 2s.\r\n\t\r\n- Totem powers have been completely revamped.
