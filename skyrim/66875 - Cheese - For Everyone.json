Cheese for everyone&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This is a bat file, or a batch file. But what is exactly a batch file? \r<br />A batch file is a text document that you add to your Skyrim folder. It can add a variety of things to your game, like infinite arrows, food, armor, dragon souls, etc. Bat files are multiple console commands in a text file (hence the name batch), so you don&#39;t have to take forever to add items to your game. \r<br />\r<br />How do you even use a batch file? \r<br />You launch Skyrim, hit the ~ key, then type in bat *insert text file name* For this text file, it will be named cheese, so type in bat cheese, and you should get your cheese. If you want more cheese, do it again",
