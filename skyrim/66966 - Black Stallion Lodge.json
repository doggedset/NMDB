  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Verdana][color=#8e7cc3][u][size=6]~Black Stallion Lodge~[/size][/u][/color][/font][/center][center]\r<br />\r<br />This week I felt like downsizing from my larger mods. A good, starter player home in [color=#00ff00]Riverwood[/color]. I know, there&#39;s good and plenty of those around. Like, dozens, probably. But this is more of a Me project, and it turned out really nice, I say&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/2WzhvBg.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Remember White Stallion Lodge from Oblivion? That was a nice little free home. Here, I had designed this place in mind to give a new character some interest in the DLC&#39;s and their aesthetics, and maybe giving a small reminder of that nice Oblivion home. There are some Redoran decorations, Snow Elf ruins, Telvanni mushrooms, all to fit pleasantly in a Nord style cabin. It sits well in the landscape and looks like it was a natural part of the Riverwood area. A perfect place to start on your way to Whiterun, or a good place to fit with the roleplaying characteristic of someone not so stinking rich.\r<br />\r<br />All in all: \r<br />- [color=#00ffff]ADOPTION FRIENDLY&#33;[/color] With 2 beds aside from the master bedroom.\r<br />- Unique displays and crafting stations, including a staff enchanter.\r<br />(This is without Smithing stations, as Alvor&#39;s is right next door)\r<br />- Three mannequins and several weapon displays, and 2 bookshelf rows with a Winterhold bookcase.\r<br />- Plenty of idle markers to make the house livable for npc&#39;s. \r<br />- Unconventional oddities like a new fireplace, unique static objects, ClefJ&#39;s Redoran door, etc. \r<br />- Day/Night light cycle.\r<br />- Lower to middle-class decorations and furniture, good for a starting adventurer.\r<br />- All yours from the get-go. \r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />- Update\r<br />- Dawnguard\r<br />- Dragonborn\r<br />- Hearthfire \r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Incompatabilities:[/color]\r<br />- Anything modifying the RiverwoodBridge cell next to the roadsigns. There&#39;s probably a few there.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]Thanks and Credits:[/color]\r<br />- Elianora for her unique container and static objects&#33;\r<br />- Darkrider for his wall painting resources&#33; [/center]",
