  "descriptionHtml": "For those of you who, like me, prefer a bow to any other weapon in the game and get tired of starting with a sword/axe with a new save. \r\nThe barrel is located behind the dead stormcloak solider in the round room where you first enter the keep with Ralof, if you choose imperial then you will have to wait until you pass through the gate to get the items.\r\nThe items are : Hunting bow, 1000 iron arrows (didn\\'t think this was too much because arrows are extremely easy to stockpile anyway), full leather armor and a marksman ring.\r\nThis is my first attempt at using be creation kit so any criticism is more than welcome, hope i\\'ve done it right and you all enjoy!\r\n\r\nFirst update already, V1.1 Fixes all issues that i and others have noticed and changes the arrows to steel.",
