  "descriptionHtml": "[heading] [size=10]Skyrim RePopulated[/size] [/heading]\r\n\r\nThis is it, after a recruitment period, I have decided to do two things,\r\n\r\nA) Continue this mod, by myself, without a team, irrespective of the size of this mod\r\nand\r\nB) Completely redo this mod, I have found bad NavMesh edits in the older version, plus there are several bugs that caused a random or multiple random hostile NPCs to spawn in large, populus areas. Therefore, I am reworking the mod, in a clean way, that will stop this and optimize the mod, first release will be soon, i\\'m not sure when though, i\\'m at school, so it may be a while\r\n\r\n[size=5]THANKS DRAGONCHRIS![/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[i] Struggling along the path, the cold begins to sap at your strength, slowly your vision shrinks, stolen away with the last of your energy as it spills into the bitter, cold wind. Ahead, a light shines, an inn, perhaps? You take a last few, forlorn steps, crashing to the ground as darkness engulfs your feeble mind. You use the remainder of your precious energy to raise your frost crusted head and see that it was not an inn. Nothing is there. No inn, not here in Skyrim. [/i]\r\n\r\n[i] [size=2] Depopulated, post-apoclypse Skyrim getting you down? Tired of 6 NPCs in the largest city in Skyrim?[/size] [/i]\r\n[b]Boring, flat, lifeless? Sound more like your Ex than a Best Selling game?[/b]\r\n\r\n[size=20] [color=#ffff00] TRY THE LIFENATOR 2000 (or as we call it, Skyrim RePopulated!!)[/color] [/size]\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/29880-5-1358081366.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/29880-2-1358081364.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nSkyrim is big, cold and empty. My fridge is big cold and empty. BUT! There is something you can do about Skyrim. Unlike my fridge, there is hope!\r\n\r\nThis mod has two descriptions. Because it is so large, it is important for me to ensure every one is updated as to what currently it can offer but more importantly, what the future holds for this mod.\r\n\r\n[b] [heading]Short Term/Now[/heading][/b]\r\nShort term and now, it includes a Whiterun exterior Market with around 7 stalls, 15-18 new NPCs, 5 NPCs that live at the T intersection with complex paths and own a blacksmith/farm, two ins, one near WR and the other near Mix Water Mill, a Tavern near the WR market. The custom NPCs all use the Tavern and Inn near WR. They eat there and stay the night at the Inn. These are called simple DynaPCs. Inside each establishment, there are several sandbox NPCs called StataPCs. They stay there to add immersion. Make it feel like there\\'s always someone there.\r\n\r\n[heading] [b]Long run[/b] [/heading]\r\n\r\nI plan to expand on all previous settlements, cities, add new areas, building, NPCs, guards, NPCs to the cities, followers, mercenaries, vendors, a new settlement or two. \r\nAlso, if you want any specific features, added NPCs or else, PM or comment me and i\\'dd add them next update!!\r\n~SD\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n",
