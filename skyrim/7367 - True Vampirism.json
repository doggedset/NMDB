  "descriptionHtml": "[u][b]True Vampirism[/b][/u]\r\n[i]By Uricon[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000] This mod has been discontinued! It was created before the release of the Creation Kit, and once I had the time to continue the mod, many better alternatives had arrived. \r\n[/color]\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n[b]Introduction:[/b]\r\n-------------------\r\nHello, Uricon here! This is the first mod I've made and uploaded for Skyrim, so excuse me if there are some common things I've overlooked :) \r\n\r\nI would also love some feedback, as I haven't been able to test it for a longer period of time. I've only checked that the mod functions as intended. \r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n[b]Updates:[/b]\r\n-------------------\r\n-05-02-12-\r\nFix: Waterbreathing is now functioning properly.\r\n\r\n-03.02.12-\r\nHaving had some spare time at hand, I've added a [b][u]Hardcore version[/u][/b]. It is aimed towards those considering Vampirism to be a truly unforgiving curse, in which any stage of vampirism below first should have severe consequences. More details below.\r\n\r\nFix: When skills are reduced, it now correctly reads: \"Reduce <skill>\" instead of \"Fortify <skill>\" in the \"Active Effects\" list.\r\n\r\nI've also uploaded each version separately, so one can use the Nexus MM properly.\r\n\r\n-01.02.12-\r\nI've now created [u]three different versions[/u] of the mod to suit a broader audience! \"Original\", \"Moderate\" and \"More Challenging\" \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n[b]Description:[/b]\r\n-------------------\r\nIf you're like me, you probably found the Vampirism part of Skyrim to be quite lacking and seem more like a nuisance than anything else. So I've done what I can, with what I have, to make it more interesting, challenging, balanced and fun to play.\r\n\r\nBesides many other changes, the most noticeable is that I've made the different stages of Vampirism much more drastic by increasing several skills and attributes at the higher stages, and decreased them at the lower ones. \r\n-Meaning I've reversed the progress, making you stronger at the first stages and weaker at the lower.\r\n-This will make you feel like a true monster when you've just fed, and like a frail old lady with a bad hip when you haven't fed for a long time.\r\n-I also changed \"Daylight settings\" for \"Weakness to Sunlight\" from 05.00-19.00 to 06.00-19.00, making the night an hour longer (it's usually pitch black at 05.00)\r\n\r\nI've tried my best to keep things as balanced as possible. I also wanted Vampirism to actually [i]feel[/i] like a curse and an addiction; for this reason I have kept the traditional way of feeding (drinking from sleeping NPCs). I find that if one could feed off of anything anytime, there wouldn't really be any point in any other stages than the first. \r\n\r\nI want the player to [b]truly[/b] feel the need to go half across the province for that next fix.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n[b]What it does:[/b]\r\n-------------------\r\n[u]Skills and attributes increase/decrease:[/u]\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]Attributes[/i]: Magicka, Health and Stamina\r\n\r\n[i]Various Skills[/i]: \r\n-One-handed\r\n-Two-Handed\r\n-Archery\r\n-Light Armor\r\n-Conjuration\r\n-Persuasion\r\n-Unarmed\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] Remember that none of the increases in Skills / Attributes are active while in the sun. However, decreases are.\r\n\r\nEDIT: [u]There are 4 versions of this mod:[/u] \r\n\r\nVampirism Stages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4\r\n\r\n-Original:\r\nVarious Skills: +20 | +10 | +5 | -15\r\nAttributes: +40 | +30 | -15 | -35 No Recovery\r\n\r\n-Moderate:\r\nVarious Skills: +15 | +5 | +0 | -15\r\nAttributes: +30 | +10 | -15 No Recovery | -35 No Recovery\r\n\r\n-More Challenging:\r\nVarious Skills: +10 | +0 | -5 | -15\r\nAttributes: +20 | +0 | -20 No Recovery | -40 No Recovery\r\n\r\n-Hardcore\r\nSkills: +5 | -5 | -10 | -15\r\nAttributes: +20 | -10 No Recovery | -20 No Recovery + Constant Health damage |  -40 No Recovery +  Constant Severe Health Damage\r\n[b]Note:[/b] [u]At stage 3 and 4, if you enter sunlight, you will [b]die instantly[/b][/u]!\r\n[b]Note 2:[/b] Remember that you can't use the Fast Travel or Wait function while taking health damage (Stage 3 + 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Original Version:[/b]\r\n[i]No Bloodthirst[/i] (Stage 1): You are 100% Resistant to Frost. Various skills are increased by 20 and all attributes by 40 when not in Sunlight.\r\n\r\n[i]Mild Bloodthirst[/i] (Stage 2):  You are 75% Resistant to Frost. Various skills are increased by 10 and all attributes by 30 when not in Sunlight.\r\n\r\n[i]Moderate Bloodthirst[/i] (Stage 3): You are 50% Resistant to Frost. Various skills are increased by 5 when not in Sunlight, and all attributes are [b]reduced[/b] by 15.\r\n\r\n[i]Severe Bloodthirst[/i] (Stage 4):  You are 25% Resistant to Frost. Various skills are [b]reduced[/b] by 15 and all attributes by 35 which also does not recover. \r\n\r\n[u]Weakness to Sunlight[/u]:\r\n\r\nStage 1: Health, Magicka, and Stamina do not recover while in Sunlight and are reduced by 15 points.\r\n\r\nStage 2: Health, Magicka, and Stamina do not recover while in Sunlight and are reduced by 30 points. Vampiric eyesight also disrupted by Sunlight.\r\n\r\nStage 3: Health, Magicka, and Stamina do not recover while in Sunlight and are reduced by 40 points. Vampiric eyesight also disrupted by Sunlight.\r\n\r\nStage 4: Health, Magicka, and Stamina do not recover while in Sunlight and are reduced by 45 points. Vampiric eyesight also disrupted by Sunlight.\r\n\r\n[u]Spells changed:[/u]\r\n\r\nVampiric Drain: Absorb health from enemies. Changed damage at stages 1/2/3/4 from 2/3/4/5 to 12/9/6/4\r\n\r\n[i]Vampire's Sight[/i]: You can see much better in dark environments. It now lasts forever (from 60 sec).\r\n\r\n[i]Vampire's Servant[/i]: Reanimate a dead being once a day. Changed the lvl of being reanimation cap from 6/13/21/30 to 50/35/20/10\r\n\r\n[i]Champion of the Night[/i]: Illusion spells are 25% more powerful. Added Waterbreathing\r\n\r\n[i]Vampire's Seduction[/i] (Stage 2): Creatures and people won't fight or flee for 30s. Changed lvl cap from 8 to 25. Useable once a day.\r\n\r\n[i]Embrace of Shadows[/i] (Stage 4): You are undetectable for 15 sec and your Vampiric body turns into a shadow, rendering you silent and much harder to find for 180 sec [Muffle + Fortify Sneak 35]. (From: invisibility and night vision for 180 sec) Useable once a day.\r\n     -I did this so the spell would feel like the desperation spell that it is (or should be). I believe it will be easier and more fun to infiltrate a city in the need for blood this way. Also the visuals are pretty nifty. \r\n     -The first 15 seconds are practically \"Invisibility\" without the visuals that comes with it.\r\n\r\nThe other spells not listed have not been changed.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n[b]Minor Issues[/b]\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n- \"Active Effects\" lists every fortifications of the Various Skills in sunlight (In addition to 7 \"Sunlight Reduction\" effects). I've spent a handful of hours trying to figure out the right combination of \"Conditions\" (SkyEdit) for the magic effects so that the increase in skills and attributes would only occur when there was no sunlight, outdoors. Sadly the only way I found was to add reductions to the \"Weakness to Sunlight\" effect so that the skill-increase would add up to 0, resulting in 14 unnecessary effects in the \"Active Effects\" list =/ .\r\n\r\n- I had to remove the invisibility visual effect to sustain the shadow effect of the \"Embrace of Shadows\" power. You are still considered Invisible though (for the 15 sec). \r\n\r\n- I have yet to find a way to edit the on-screen messages that occur during the stages of Vampirism, so it still reads that your \"Powers grow as you hunger\"\r\n\r\n- Adding spells from other stages to the first.\r\n\r\n- I tried adding sun-damage to the \"Weakness to Sunlight\" effect, but as many others also found out: this bugs up the wait and Fast travel functions.\r\n\r\n- As a precautionary measure I've exchanged the magic effect of \"Poison Immunity\" with another type of the same effect; I heard the current was buggy. I have yet to test it though.",
