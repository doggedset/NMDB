  "descriptionHtml": "This mod lets the player apply any armour enchantment to any piece of armour or clothing. \r\n\r\nI made this mod because I felt it was odd that I couldn\\\\\\'t make a full set of armour with fire resistance.\r\n\r\nThis mod will not affect any enchantments added by any DLC, because I don\\\\\\'t own those. It will work with all vanilla enchantments.\r\n\r\nThis mod does not require any DLC.\r\n\r\nThere are no currently known compatibility issues, if you have any specific concerns please tell me and I will investigate.\r\n\r\nTo install this mod, download the .rar and use the nexus mod manager. Or you can drop the .esp file into your Data directory if you don\\\\\\'t use the mod manager.\r\n\r\nCreated by mackam08 aka IrksomeBadger.\r\n\r\n=============\r\nRELEASE NOTES\r\n=============\r\n\r\n========================\r\nv1.0.0\r\n========================\r\n\r\nDate of release: 02/04/2013\r\nPurpose: Initial release\r\nNotes: This mod lets the player apply any armour enchantment to any piece of armour or clothing.\r\nReleased by: mackam08 aka IrksomeBadger\r\n\r\n========================",
