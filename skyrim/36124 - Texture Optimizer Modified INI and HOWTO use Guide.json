  "descriptionHtml": "WoW. 5000 downloads...many thanks to all who read the posts sections and updates people have posted.  Also many many thanks to those who endorsed.\r<br />\r<br />If the original author incorporates this or just want me to remove it then just let me know. You MIGHT want to print this webpage for HOW TO instructions on the actual program...\r<br />\r<br />This is a modified INI for the Ordenador Texture Optimizer that will ignore TXT, RAR, ZIP, NIF, 7z, ESP and ESM file extensions. Backup the original and replace with this.  There was no REAL problem with the original but it kept halting on all those above file extensions or pausing, so I edited the INI to ignore em for Skyrim.  Dunno if they&#39;re required for other games though so keep your original INI backed up if you&#39;re gonna use Ordenador for any other games that have DDS textures.\r<br />\r<br />Couldn&#39;t get an answer from the author for help on how to do it so I muggled through it.  I&#39;m unable to use SMCO and the Ordenador Texture Optimizer has never let me down.\r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12801  REQUIRED MAIN PROGRAM\r<br />\r<br />What does it do?  Well for those of us anchient computer users it is an awesome small program that shrinks texture files down for various games.  Check out just ONE of my armor replacers. \r<br />\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35909  I know my armors are BAD. It&#39;s just to show you what 8k textures shrunk to 512 look like.\r<br />\r<br />Everything was shrunk down from 8k to 512k.  I was finally able to use the HiResTexturePacks also. From like 1GB per tex pack down to about 300mb and still looking great.\r<br />\r<br />Update.  Files now included in my &#34;ignore&#34; list are as follows...please PM me for additions. Some of these MAY be default ignores.\r<br />\r<br />Added INI per request\r<br />Preserve_File = *.nif\r<br />Preserve_File = *.fuz\r<br />Preserve_File = *.wav\r<br />Preserve_File = *.xwm\r<br />Preserve_File = *.tri\r<br />Preserve_File = *.lip\r<br />Preserve_File = *.psd\r<br />Preserve_File = *.zip\r<br />Preserve_File = *.rar\r<br />Preserve_File = *.pex\r<br />Preserve_File = *.psc\r<br />Preserve_File = *.bsl\r<br />Preserve_File = *.xml\r<br />Preserve_File = *.seq\r<br />Preserve_File = *.7z\r<br />Preserve_File = *.esm\r<br />Preserve_File = *.esp\r<br />Preserve_File = *.rtf\r<br />Preserve_File = *.jpg\r<br />Preserve_File = *.pdf\r<br />Preserve_File = *.txt\r<br />Preserve_Folder = texturesmeshes\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO USE ORDENADOR?\r<br />Textures Check, Fix, Compress, Improves perfomace game.\r<br />Games: SKYRIM, FALLOUT 3 & NV, STALKER, OBLIVION, MORROWIND and others.\r<br />\r<br />Ok. Under MY guide here (this is Thorne67. I write guides for Skyrim n stuff..) is the original author notes.\r<br />\r<br />This is NOT a mod so if you installed it with NMM or another Mod manager you messed up and have a mess to clean up. Sorry. Can&#39;t help you on that one.  THIS is a UTILITY program for DOWNSIZING textures.\r<br />\r<br />1.  There&#39;s NO installer. Just extract the file somewhere IN IT&#39;S OWN DIRECTORY.  You might want to go into that newly made directory and create a shortcut to ORDENADOR.EXE on the desktop somewhere.\r<br />\r<br />2.  I can NOT stress the importance of temporary &#34;working&#34; folders to people.  Do NOT just run it and point to the DATA directory of Skyrim. You CAN end up sitting around for a few days waiting for the program to finish.  Also can&#39;t stress NOT to halt the program with task manager.  You&#39;re working with textures and if you shut it down prematurely you&#39;re also screwed.\r<br />\r<br />3.  It&#39;s a memory HOG. Period.  Do NOT do many things at once.  Running the program and trying to watch a movie or play music just will NOT work.\r<br />\r<br />4.  Ok. Find a SMALL &#34;high quality&#34; armor or weapon or texture replacer mod.  Extract that mod into your &#34;work&#34; folder using it&#39;s filename.  Now run the ORDENADOR program.\r<br />\r<br />5.  Although it offers the BSA option for compression I never use it so I can&#39;t help you out there.  Also I don&#39;t use the PROFILES tag as I edit all my files manually. The program can&#39;t handle READ ONLY files (DOH) which I HAVE found here and there so it&#39;s best if you change the attributes of all the files.  Windows does NOT always work doing that so you might want to find a third party file attributes changer. \r<br />So here&#39;s the JUST TO START options:\r<br />\tCheck If no mask in image compress to DXT1C\r<br />\tCheck if mask in image is 1bit compress to DXT5\r<br />\tCheck if mask in image is translucency compress to DXT5\r<br />\tCheck delete unnecessary files\r<br />\tCheck Mipmaps....FORCE REBURN\tTHIS is important. SOME authors forgot em.  This will FIX it.  ONLY do this for the VERY first run.\r<br />\tCheck Resize Patterns...16x16\tAny SMALLER and your game looks like Lego building blocks.\r<br />\tCheck Resize DOWN...IF &gt; 2048\tThis is your FIRST run. If you downloaded 8K textures and you&#39;re running an OLD machine...hey...your choice.  It&#39;ll look GREAT... \tbut take FOREVER to do this process...\r<br />\t\r<br />\tNow...at the very bottom in light blue or whatever colour scheme you&#39;re using it has a &#34;options for mod makers&#34;  Click on it and the very bottom box becomes available. Check that one now and run the program.  If you downloaded a mod with a LOT of textures you could be waiting for quite a while.\r<br />\t\r<br />6.  Second Run.\r<br />\tCHANGE the MIPMAPS option to MAKE IF NO MIPMAPS\r<br />\tRun the program.  It&#39;ll continue doing the same thing and fixing things.. even if you downloaded 2k textures it&#39;s fixing and adding.\r<br />\t\r<br />7.\tThird Run.\r<br />\tIf you want to just be safe change the MIPMAPS again to FORCE REBURN but I&#39;ve ONLY encountered one bad file out of hundreds.  Other than that MIPMAPS should be at MAKE if...\r<br />\tRESIZE DOWN...go incrementally 2048   then 1024  and finally 512.  The program WILL go lower dividing by half after the 512 option so I&#39;d suggest running the 512 option at least twice.  You can see what it&#39;s doing as it&#39;s doing it so generally you can tell if there&#39;s any files that are still over what you want.\r<br />\t\r<br />\t\r<br />And now the original author&#39;s notes:\r<br />================================================================\r<br />Features:\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />- Compress BMP, TGA, DDS (unoptimized) to DXT5 and DXT1\r<br />- Remove unused mask in DXT5/DXT3 to DXT1c without losing quality, reducing 50%\r<br />- Make mipmaps to improve performance\r<br />- Delete unnecessary files (identical BMP=TGA=DDS, thumbs.db, pspbrwse.jbf, ...)\r<br />- Resizes fills to 4x4 or 16x16\r<br />- Fixes Wrong Size - Example: 100x30 =&gt; 128x32\r<br />- Fixes when the alpha channel is hiding an image\r<br />- Optionally resizes textures\r<br />- Optimizer BSA (Compress, Merge internal files)\r<br />- Backup changed files\r<br />\r<br />consequently:\r<br />- decreases some stuttering\r<br />- fixes crash/CTD caused by bursting of VRAM\r<br />- free hard drive space / reduces the size of the MOD\r<br />\r<br />================================================================\r<br />Usage:\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />- Extract &#34;Optimizer_Textures_xxx.rar&#34; to a folder\r<br />- Run &#34;Ordenador.exe&#34;\r<br />- Click in button &#34;plugin/data files&#34; to point the Folder of Game, DATA or TEXTURES.\r<br />- Optional: First Tab (optimize), choose one presets\r<br />- Optional: Second tab (extra options), choose the best nvcompress\r<br />- Press &#34;start&#34; ...

Backup before or use NMM to restore MODS.\r<br />\r<br />- It runs on what hardware?\r<br />R: Any (ATI, NVIDIA. i3 intel HD).\r<br />\r<br />- what is the &#34;greyed&#34; also in bsa option for?\r<br />R: futures features.\r<br />\r<br />- Which one is recommended? maximum or minimum compress? \r<br />R: whatever (maximum if possible). \r<br />\r<br />- if i choose maximum compress then my HD textures will become less HD?\r<br />R: if used &#34;Resize if &gt; 1024&#34;, &#34;HD Textures 2k&#34; become &#34;HD Textures 1k&#34; (or MD Textures 1k).\r<br />R: Resize use metode SINC High Quality, the quality lost is the smallest possible.\r<br />\r<br />- what happen if i compress more than once?\r<br />R: nothing. \r<br />R: case &#34;resize if&gt; 2048&#34; is active, and the first time it cut a texture from 8192 to 4096,\r<br />   the second time he had reduced to 2048, and the third time, not reduced further.\r<br />   CAUTION&#33;&#33;&#33;: case &#34;Resize ALL&#34; is active always, will reduce the textures every time it runs.\r<br />   But the program tell a warning and request confirmation. ;)\r<br />\r<br />- before the game was crashing every 15 mn now i played 1h30 without any crash.\r<br />R: This is due to the burst of textures in memory. compression with overflow happens less or gone.\r<br />R: I also noticed that when played morrowind. I do not know if it happens with all cards.\r<br />\r<br />=====================================================\r<br />Acknowledgment:\r<br />Tanks All for: feedback, suggestions, aid.\r<br />- abot and Community Morrowind/Skyrim for suggestions\r<br />- UnrealWarfare for imagems and evaluating\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------\r<br />- Bugs Reports: apipino@gmail.com",
