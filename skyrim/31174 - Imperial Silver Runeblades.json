  "descriptionHtml": "2/7/2013 LSB Imperial Runeblades By Lord Banewrath Sunblade\r\n\r\n\r\n           This mod adds two new swords to skyrim. Both of these swords are brand new models and are made of silver\r\n and have holy runes etched into the blades to do enhanced damage to undead. I made the damage of these new swords \r\nslightly more then the stock silver weapons but less damage then ebony weapons. Both types of swords can be \r\nupgraded at the skyforge for 1 silver ingot and I added them to the Silver Hands weapon lists. Since the silver \r\nhand are the only faction I have found in skyrim to use silver weapons, I decided it was best they get these too.  \r\nNow not every silver hand will be carrying these swords. But most of them will have a chance of spawning with them.\r\nSo lucky you!\r\n\r\n    You may not use this material for other mods that will be uploaded without permission. You CAN translate\r\nthe mod to your language and upload it to your national site if you wish. \r\n\r\n\r\n   To install drag and drop both the esp and bsa to your data folder. To uninstall just delete the two files.",
