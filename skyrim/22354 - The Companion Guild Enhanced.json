Fixed armor, combat styles and weaponry.\r\nCosmetic changes to all members (Not Kodlak, hes perfect)\r\n\r\n[center]---Before going any further remember, if you like it, come back and endorse it---[/center]\r\n\r\nThe Companions are similar to the Fighters Guild of Cyrodiil. Eorlund, a blacksmith in Whiterun, states that they have been leaderless since Ysgramor. He says that an elder named Kodlak Whitemane acts as the Harbinger, but that there have been no actual leaders since Ysgramor. The fact that they have no official leader is emphasized by their name. \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i641.photobucket.com/albums/uu140/edg3k/break3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n---Changes---\r\n\r\nWolf Armor - Armor Rating has been increased to be on par with the Steel Plate Armor while maintaining its lightweight.\r\nAncient Nord Armor - Has been reduced to light armor to match Aelas thief/marksman abilities. It is now weight and protection wise equal to Scaled Armor as it does not give as much protection as a heavy armor set. Mostly cloth/leather with some armoring its more suited to light then heavy. \r\n\r\nAll members have had their inventory resuited to match their abilities/skills.\r\nAela - Marksman with an Elven Bow and Light Ancient Nordic Armor\r\nAthis - One handed master with Iron Armor\r\nFarkas - Skyforge Steel Sword and Steel Shield with Wolf Armor (No Helm)\r\nNjada - Skyforge Steel Waraxe and Steel Shield with Iron & Hide Armor\r\nRia -  Skyforge Steel Greatsword with Banded Iron Armor\r\nSkjor - Untouched\r\nTorvar - Skyforge Steel Battleaxe with Iron Armor\r\nVilkas - Skyforge Steel Greatsword with Wolf Armor (No Helm)\r\nEorlund - Skyforge Steel Waraxe with Iron & Hide Armor\r\n& introducing\r\nEvelona - Skyforge Steel Sword & Dagger with Hide Armor\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i641.photobucket.com/albums/uu140/edg3k/break2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n---Cosmetics for both Members and Jorrvaskr---\r\nEach member has had their appearance tweaked to more match how they act and sound. Warpaint has been changed or added to add to the personality.\r\nJorrvaskr has been tweaked to, to reflect the guilds deeds. Animal trophies have been added in the main hall, including a mammoth skull over the rear entrance, several wolf/bear trophies dotted around the upper portion of the hall and a stuffed bear in the corner.\r\nIn the sleeping area more beds have been added and a new guild pet, Styrke who mainly sleeps and wanders the sleeping area.\r\n\r\nA new recruit has arrived to, Evelona. A dual wielding specialist from Markarth. Following the death of her family to the Forsworn she made the journey to Whiterun to join the Companions. She is mentored by Aela.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i641.photobucket.com/albums/uu140/edg3k/break1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n---Other Changes---\r\n\r\nThe Nord Hero Weapons have also been buffed so reflect the effort gone to to get them.
