(1.9.32)\r<br />\r<br />This mod contains 1 masterfile and 4 plugins\r<br />Masterfile contents: the entire city and everything in it\r<br />Shop package contents: only the merchant faction and packages of the shopkeepers and marketstall owners.\r<br />Plaza Package contents: merchant factions and packages of all the shopkeepers in all three plaza&#39;s.\r<br />SurvivalsG package contents: merchant factions and packages for the six npc&#39;s at survivals gathering.\r<br />Finalized content: This only a Re-finalization of 4 exterior cells. These cells are 01,04,15,16 of the whiterun exterior.\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Installation: \r<br />Unpack, drag the contents in the folder or use the mod manager. Activate all the plugins except the finalized plugin. The finalized plugin is only nessecary if you use one of the mods mentioned below. When you install this mods, make sure you are not somewhere in the exterior world.Place the masterfile as high as possible in the load order. I place the plugins always in front of clothing mods as this was for me the best place. if using the finalized plugin you have to place it somewhere at the bottom. \r<br />\r<br />-------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Incompatibilities: \r<br />Literally every mod that alters even a little bit of the Whiterun exterior.(This mod  alters 18 exterior cells.)\r<br />If using one of the mods below, you must activate the Society of Merchants finalized esp and place it after the mods mentioned below.(I always place this esp after interesting npc&#39;s)\r<br />- More Travellers (this mod add a barrel under the carriage, which I personally don&#39;t mind.)\r<br />- Interesting Npc&#39;s\r<br />- Jobs of Skyrim\r<br />If not using one of these three, you don&#39;t have to activate the finalized plugin.                                    (Perhaps there other conflicting mods I don&#39;t know of which can be made compatible with the finalized esp.)\r<br />\r<br />Note: When using the Unofficial Skyrim Patch, two cabbages will be added on the field next to the carriage.(which I also don&#39;t mind)\r<br />\r<br />-------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />FUTURE UPDATES:\r<br />adding one new district along the east wall of whiterun behind battleborn and chillfurrow farm.\r<br />adding guards on patrol\r<br />adding NPC&#39;s to the city\r<br />adding landscape fixes\r<br />adding new shoppingplaza&#39;s\r<br />\r<br />-------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Changelog Version 1.1\r<br />- Fixed the BSA file\r<br />- Lightswitch works now\r<br />- Added 20 NPC&#39;s to fill up the city a little\r<br />- Marketstall items can now be stolen\r<br />- Some landscaping\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve always wanted Whiterun to be the commercial centre.
