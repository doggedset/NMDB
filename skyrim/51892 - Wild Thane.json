  "descriptionHtml": "Wild Thane\r<br />\r<br />Using the UNP Mini Dress Collection by Tiwa44 www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47376\r<br />\r<br />Colors used for each set:\r<br />\r<br />Black, Blue, Brown, Copper, Gold, Green, Pink, Purple, Red, Teal, White, Yellow\r<br />\r<br />*Note* All Female clothes are 2048x2048 (Some shoes/hats/accessories/gloves are of smaller sizes). Male clothes are 1024x1024 (I used the wedding outfit due to it being cleaner and less spots than the normal fine clothes)\r<br />\r<br />Contains the following\r<br />\r<br />12 Female and 12 male fineclothes01 outfits\r<br />2 sets of boots (black and brown)\r<br />12 Female and 12 male finehat02&#39;s\r<br />\r<br />Level lists have been created to randomize outfits for NPCs that wear fineclothes01.\r<br />Outfits have a 50% chance of having any of the standard or magical necklaces, rings and a 25% chance of a circlet (no uniqe jewelry).\r<br />Also the NPCs will have a 50% chance of having one of the finehats02.\r<br />You should be able to find the fine clothes at vendors that sell clothing or as random items.\r<br />\r<br />All textures are recolored default fineclothes01, fineboots01 and finehat02. I made sure that the female textures will also work with the full length fineclothes01 but I did not outfits containing those at this time.\r<br />Meshes are the creation of Tiwa44 referenced at the top.\r<br />\r<br />If you can&#39;t wait to find all the outfits. You can find them in qasmoke near the table with all the ladles.\r<br />\r<br />:&#33;&#33;Disclaimer&#33;&#33;:\r<br />\r<br />The meshes (Accept for some of the ground/world version meshes): I have no idea how they will work on your system. I do not build/modify meshes so I cannot fix/convert/rebuild the meshes. If the meshes clip, look wrong or anything else, there is nothing I can do, you will have to contact the original mesh designer (Tiwa44 www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47376) and see if he/she can/will fix it for you.\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to use these meshes/textures however you want. Just be sure to give credit.\r<br />\r<br />** Note **, it&#39;s called Wild Thane because half of the NPC Thanes use fineclothes01 and by half I mean 2 of them (Dengeir of Stuhn and Erikur of Solitude. I setup Bryling to use fineclothes01 and then there&#39;s Hrongar of Whiterun.... I tried to get him to put them on but he responded with &#34;I&#39;m not wearing those namby, pamby, girly man clothes&#33;&#33;&#34; as he was drawing his great sword so I let him be.\r<br />",
