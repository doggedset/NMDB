  "descriptionHtml": "Ever hate your choices of starting gear?\r\n\r\nI did, Imperial and stormcloak stuff just wasnt my thing, even a second of wearing thier armors drove me mad. I wanted to fight through enemies with a bow, and nice heavy armor.\r\n\r\nSeeing as how easily you can make things with the creation kit, I simply added some starting gear choices to the chest you get your armor from (imperial side).\r\n\r\nIt adds a few things you can get, but later, such as potions, a mace, a longbow, arrows. However, It also adds iron armor taken from a prisoner (but they lost his helmet somewhere in the caves...), and items for a mage.\r\n\r\nSoon I will have a vendor that sells class related items, like bows, near riverwood, to replace this.\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\n\r\n-Aaron :)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Please Post suggestions and comments, as soon as I get a better computer I will be trying to make a lot of mods. -Aaron ",
