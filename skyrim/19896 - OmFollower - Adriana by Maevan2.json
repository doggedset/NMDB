  "descriptionHtml": "[color=\\\"#AFEEEE\\\"][b]DESCRIPTION:[/b][/color]\r\nIt seems almost truistic to note that NPCs adapted from well-cared for player characters are possessed of a certain verisimilitude; they feel, in many cases, as if they truly [i]belong[/i] in the game world. Perhaps it\\'s because I\\'m a writer (and a bit of a romanticist), but characters of this sort seem to take on an intangible quality of \\'life\\' distinct from the trappings of the game world that NPCs crafted from scratch cannot usually attain. As a result, looking through the screenshots section here on the Nexus, I\\'m often struck with the feeling that \\'this character is a [i]part[/i] of Skyrim\\'.\r\n\r\nBut enough of my silly pretension! When Maevan2 posted [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19792]the savegame file for their character Adriana[/url] and gave permission to make a follower version, I figured it\\'d be a fun little adventure to do so using AmethystDeceiver\\'s excellent [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17018]NPC Photobooth[/url] - and this is the fruit of that labor.\r\n\r\n[b]She can be found in Riften\\'s Temple of Mara with a Chef\\'s Tunic in her inventory - she\\'ll typically show up naked, though, and has no default outfit so you can dress her up as you please.[/b]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#AFEEEE\\\"][b]FEATURES:[/b][/color]\r\n- Working follower, should be compatible with UFO and other overhaul mods\r\n- Marriageable (see screenshots)\r\n- Levels with the player from levels 1 to 81\r\n- Excels at One-Handed, Light Armor, Archery, Sneak and Block\r\n- Has the following perks: Agile Defender (5/5), Armsman (5/5), Dual Flurry (2/2), Light Foot, Overdraw (5/5) and Ranger. For followers I create, I select five perks that I feel fit the character, with Light Foot acting as a \\'bonus\\' perk.\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#AFEEEE\\\"][b]USAGE:[/b][/color]\r\n- This mod REQUIRES [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii SkyHair[/url] to function (it isn\\'t listed as a master for the file as a result of use of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4554]Skyrim NPC Editor[/url]).\r\n- Just drop the OmFollowerAdriana.esp and OmFollowerAdriana.bsa into your Data directory. To uninstall, just delete them!\r\n- You can also install using Nexus Mod Manager just by clicking the button next to the file. It\\'s my first time uploading a file with NMM compatibility, so bear with me if things mess up!\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#AFEEEE\\\"][b]COMPATIBILITY:[/b][/color]\r\nThis mod should be compatible with just about any face/body model or texture replacements. The featured images use the vanilla body and textures combined with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563]Coverwomen #4[/url].\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#AFEEEE\\\"][b]LEGAL:[/b][/color]\r\n[img]http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/22965200.jpg[/img]\r\nAs with any of my mods, I care more about providing a service to the community than silly internet popularity contests. Feel free to use this for whatever you want, though of course it would be nice if you\\'d give me credit somewhere. I don\\'t do requests, but if I mess something up, please let me know (after testing to see if it\\'s my fault, of course!).\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#AFEEEE\\\"][b]CHANGELOG:[/b][/color]\r\n1.0: Initial release!\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#AFEEEE\\\"][b]CREDITS:[/b][/color]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19792]\\'Savegame Adriana\\' by Maevan2[/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17018]\\'Modder Resource - Easy NPC Creation\\' by AmethystDeceiver[/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]\\'ApachiiSkyHair\\' by Apachii[/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4554]\\'Skyrim NPC Editor\\' by foretrenty[/url]\r\n\r\nFeatured in screenshots:\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563]\\'Coverwomen\\' (Version #4) by MrLenski[/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1002]\\'JaySuS Swords\\' by jaysus[/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15910]\\'R18Pn 04 - Ritter Armor for UNP CBBEv3 - Black Retexture\\' by Palmface[/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12110]\\'Beautiful Whiterun\\' by MorninJerky[/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18466]\\'EZ2C Dialogue Menu - FULLY CONFIGURABLE\\' by steve40 and Deathless Aphrodite[/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/95]\\'Main Font Replacement\\' (Fertigo) by Valistar[/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13531]\\'Ultra Realistic World Lighting for Skyrim BETA\\' by MGE[/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15386]A modified injector version of \\'Fimbulvinter ENB\\' by 1000stenar (v2.1)[/url]",
