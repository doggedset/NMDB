  "descriptionHtml": "In one of my new games, Lokir of Rorikstead was on his way to escaping execution when he was shot--not in the back, but in the ankle. Given that his death is scripted, he died anyway, but I got to thinking: what if he had survived?\n<br />\n<br />So, I made a mod where you can find him later in the game and marry him. I decided to upload it so any other weirdos who wanted to marry him could do so.\n<br />\n<br />You'll find him hiding in the Frostfruit Inn in Rorikstead. His disposition has already been raised for marriage, all you have to do is approach him with an Amulet of Mara. This is a different Lokir from the one seen in the opening sequence, and you can find him at any point in the game. He's marked as essential but you can always change that with console commands.",
