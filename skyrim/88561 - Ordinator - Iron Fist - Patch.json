  "modName": "Ordinator - Iron Fist - Patch",
  "summary": "A small mod that causes Ordinator&#39;s iron fist perk to only require the right hand to be empty. Now you can hold a shield, a spell or whatever else in your left hand and still have the perk work.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was trying to find a way to have the ability to block without giving up the iron fist perk in Ordinator and this is what I came up with.\r<br />\r<br />Simply put, the iron fist perk checks if the right and left hand are empty and doesn&#39;t apply unless both conditions are met. I changed the left hand condition so it is always true using TES5Edit and kept the right hand condition the same. This comes with a few quirks such as:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Bashing with a shield and an empty hand is now a lot stronger\r<br />[*]Using a 1-hand weapon in your left hand and nothing else allows can allow you to keep the damage bonus\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[u]Requirements[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://rd.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68425]Just Ordinator, but that should have been obvious.[/url]\r<br />Recommended\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://rd.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27627]Gauntlet Armor - Unarmed Blocking[/url]\r<br />[url=https://rd.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/78257]Fortified blocking guantlets[/url]\r<br />[url=https://rd.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74327]Unarmed attack variation and blocking[/url] this mod provides a nicer way of dealing with unarmed blocking, but doesn&#39;t allow anything in the left hand.",
