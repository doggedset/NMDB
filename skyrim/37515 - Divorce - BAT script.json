  "summary": "Are you fed up with your wife/husband? Don&#39;t want to kill your spouse? Need something, that works like a divorce?\r<br />With just 1 console command you can be free of your troubles. You&#39;ll be free to marry anyone just as if you haven&#39;t marry before. Your spouse will be marriable again, and will not hate you.",
  "descriptionHtml": "There was never any form of divorce in Skyrim.\r<br />For some people it&#39;s a good thing, some people complain about it.\r<br />There are many different methods posted on the wikis and forums.\r<br />I tested all of them, or at least all I was able to find and chose the best option which is a combination of others.\r<br />\r<br />Just open game console, click your spouse (wife/husband) and type &#34;bat divorce&#34;. This will run a batch of commands setting you as not married, your spouse as not married and resetting marriage quests. After that wait a bit for AI to get back to normal (e.g. for your ex-spouse to leave your home and/or close the shop). My personal recommendation is 24 hours of game time.",
