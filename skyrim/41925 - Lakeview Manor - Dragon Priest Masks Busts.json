  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red]Update 10-9-2013:[/color]\r\n\r\nI have included an optional file in the download section with end tables (just like the ones in Lakeview Manor) placed under the busts to elevate them a bit. (See the new picture I added).\r\nBut this made me delete the mounted sabre cat head because there was clipping issues.\r\n\r\nI have tried to include the original altar from Labyrinthian but I\\'m afraid it is too large and it just won\\'t fit well in the space that I used.\r\n\r\nIf you want to update, you don\\'t need to do anything special, just remove the masks from the busts before updating, and once you install the update you can put them again.\r\n\r\nAlso If you have already furnished the main hall, you might notice that the Sabre Cat Head wasn\\'t deleted, just open console, click on it and type \\\"markfordelete\\\" and reload, and the head should now be gone.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nGreetings.\r\n\r\nI originally made this mod for myself, but when I looked on the Nexus I was surprised that there wasn\\'t any mod that does what I did. So I decided to share it with the community.\r\n\r\nBasically what this mod does, is that it adds Dragon Priest Masks Busts to the main hall of Lakeview Manor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=red]Requirements:[/color]\r\n\r\n- Latest Skyrim patch (1.9)\r\n\r\n- Hearthfires DLC Installed\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=red]Prerequisites:[/color]\r\n\r\n- You need your whole house built, and the small house remodeled into an entryway.\r\n\r\n- If you\\'ve already did the step above, and haven\\'t furnished your house yet, it\\'s alright you can install and activate this mod, and start furnishing right away (but the items removed by me will not come up even if you do furnish them).\r\n\r\n- If you\\'ve already furnished your house, don\\'t worry you can still use this mod, but first you must open the console up, click the little table and type \\\"markfordelete\\\", and do the same for all the clutter that I removed (see pictures). \r\nOnce you have marked all the items, save your game and reload it, you\\'ll see the items are gone, then save again and exit. \r\nAnd now you can install this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=red]Installation Instructions:[/color]\r\n\r\n- Manual Installation (not recommended): Simply extract the content of the archive anywhere, and then put the single esp in your Skyrim DATA folder. Don\\'t forget to activate the esp when you launch the game.\r\n\r\n- NMM Installation (recommended): Download with Manager, activate, and you\\'re on.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=red]Compatibility:[/color]\r\n\r\nCompatible with all mods, even the ones that edit the interior of Lakeview Manor provided they don\\'t actually touch the same spot that my mod uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=red]Permissions:[/color]\r\n\r\nFeel free to upload this mod wherever you want, edit it, fix it, modify it, use it for your mod, but please you must give me credit for the work I did, and a link to the page of the mod on the Nexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=red]Credits:[/color]\r\n\r\nBethesda Game Studios for creating this awesome game.",
