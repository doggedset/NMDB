  "descriptionHtml": "alternate weapon and armor textures 1.0\r\ni made some new textures for some of my favorite armours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- made all the imperial armour (excluding general tullius) and weapons into brass. to me it distinguishes them a bit more from ordinary steel.\r\n\r\n- made the previously green orc armour red, this way theyre not thaat subtle, and easier to make out against ebony.\r\n\r\n-i made glass crystal blue instead of green, and took away the elven looking gold. this way kinda suits the frozen environment more.\r\n\r\n-i made elven metal green, it just suits them, also changed the cloth to blue so it would match with the thalmor\r\n\r\n- also changed the thalmor robes, now the gold lining is green to match the elven weapons.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\nJust drop the textures folder in your data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nenjoy! please dont forget to vote and endorse.\r\n\r\n",
