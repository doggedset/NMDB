Only original and royalty free tracks have been used. Some tracks have been edited to better fit the game and have less of a retro feel, as well as to avoid music being louder than dialogue, with permissions. Tracks are a mixture of rock, celtic, symphonic, orchestra, medieval, metal, epic, new age, etc. Inspired by the sounds of Legend of Zelda, Fairy Tail, and Final Fantasy. \n<br />\n<br />Requires all DLC[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#1C4587]\n<br />[/color][size=3][color=#1C4587][size=5][b]Compatibility:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />* If using the add music version, should not conflict with other music adding mods\n<br />* Replacer will conflict with mods replacing music[/size]\n<br />[b][color=#1C4587][size=5]\n<br />~List of Tracks~[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />Blackreach-\n<br />1.
