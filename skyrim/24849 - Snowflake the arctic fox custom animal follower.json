  "descriptionHtml": "Snowflake is an arctic fox animal follower. She is built for combat and to be the silent sweet killer in your party.\r\n\r\nShe is essential and lvls with you. \r\n\r\nSpeed increase 25% so he doesn\\'t get left behind.\r\n\r\nLocated in Riverwood next to the sawmill. \r\n\r\nShe is a standalone follower mod.\r\n\r\nThis is a working BETA and direct support is not available. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT!!:\r\nShe does have one dialog glitch that I am not able to correct on my own. If you are able to fix this, please let me know.\r\n\r\nTo get her to follow you, you must:\r\nGo up to her and press E to start dialog. \r\nSelect the option to have her wait. (Stay here, don\\'t wander off.)\r\nThen reinitialize the dialog and select the option to have her follow you. (Please come with me and I will give you a cookie.)\r\nShe will then follow you to oblivion and back, unless you dismiss her. Lol\r\n\r\nCheck out my other mods:\r\nKenzie Mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24821\r\nSpot Mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24796\r\nFaren Mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24754\r\nConrad Mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24755",
