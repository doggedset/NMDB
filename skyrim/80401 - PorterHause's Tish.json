With her speed and strength she could best all three in a sparing match. Her [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]father also taught her the art of forge work and soon she was creating her own arms and equipment.\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]When she was 18, she was married off to a miner in Shor's Stone. Her father thought it would be a [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]match made in Sovngarde with his master smith daughter marrying an ore miner. Tish wasn't so sure [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]especially after meeting her dour groom and his family. Unhappily she went along with the marriage [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]and lived for two years in the tiny hamlet. It was soon discovered she could not conceive a child and [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]her husband began to ignore her. Tish busied herself practicing her combat skills and smithing work.[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]While forging she would chant words her father taught her like a mantra. His claim was that the words\n<br />[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]were ancient words of power that made the forge grow hotter and the weapons stronger.\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]One day there was a great shout that came from the Throat of the World that shook the heavens and [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]earth. The people of Shor's Stone said it was an ill omen and prayed to the gods. Tish however felt a [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]warmth overcome her, a warmth settled in her belly and she discovered something that shocked her but[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]only at first. While working at her forge she began her chant and as soon as the last syllable spilled [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]from her lips a great rolling ball of flame shot from her mouth and into the sky. The sound and heat [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]were terrific. Terrified, she discovered that whenever she repeated the chant the fire would issue forth [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]from her like a fountain.\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]She kept this discovery a secret and vowed to ask her father where he had learned the words.\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]Not long after that Tish was out gathering edible wild plants when she came upon two young girls from [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]her village in the forest being menaced by a pack of wolves. Unarmed but unwilling to let the girls be [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]ripped apart by wolves, Tish charged throwing rocks and swinging a fallen tree limb with skill. The [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]wolves proved to be too many to handle without proper gear and soon she found herself trapped in the [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]same corner with the hysterical young maidens. Tish did the only thing she could think of and chanted [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]her forge mantra.\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]In the aftermath the wolves lay in a burning pile and the two girls fled screaming towards the village.[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]When she returned home she found the village folk gathered in the square. Instead of praising her for[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]her bravery the villagers glared and muttered. They did not ask for an explanation nor did anyone [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]thank her. In the end she ended up more ostracized than ever.\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]Shortly after that her husband got a priest to dissolve their marriage and kicked her from the home they [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]had shared for over two years. Gathering her meager belongings and her equipment she kicked the [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]village dust from her boots, contemptuously spit in the direction of the folks gathered to watch her [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]departure and began the long trek home.\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]Upon arriving home Tish discovered the farm in ruins and her father and two brothers were dead. Her [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]mother and sister were no where to be found. Grief stricken questioned the neighbors and found out [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]that some of the weapons her father had forged had ended up in the hands of the Stormcloaks. The [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]Imperials had traced the maker's mark on the blades to Carag's farm and attempted to arrest him. He [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]resisted and his sons had joined the fray. When it was over the bulk of the Imperial soldiers were dead [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]but so were Carag and his sons. No one could tell Tish where her mother and sister were but Tish [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]feared the worst.\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]She returned to the ruins of the farm and restored her father's forge to working order. For three days [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]she worked the forge chanting and hammering and when she emerged she was as tempered and sharp[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]as the weapons she had created.\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]From that time on Tish hunted and killed Imperial soldiers on sight. Eventually she ended up in [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]Windhelm working for the Stormcloaks as a mercenary. Her hard demeanor and no nonsense bearing [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]earned the appellation Stoneflower, beautiful but hard. Imperial soldiers both fear and loath her as the [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]Nord demoness that uses an axe to hack off heads and limbs with a smile on her face and then burns [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]any still standing with a word. Many a Imperial officer has also suddenly sprouted arrows from chest [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]and head without warning.\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]When the player discovers her she is in the Temple of Talos praying for a clue to the whereabouts of [/i][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][i]her sister and mother.[/i][/size][/color][/font][font=Verdana][img]https://s5.postimg.cc/q8kmqqt53/Info.png[/img]\n<br />Name:  Tish\n<br />Voice:  Female Sultry\n<br />Marriageable:  Yes\n<br />Height:  1.01\n<br />Weight:  100\n<br />Body:  Custom HDT CBBE;
