  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Laurence the Stern[/b] is an Orc bookseller who has a camp under the bridge NE of Largashbur, on the road west from Riften.\n<br />\n<br />He sells books from leveled lists (LItemBooks0All to LItemBooks4All), so books added to these lists by mods such as \"Books Books Books\" or \"Book Covers Skyrim - Lost Library\" will be available (if you use those mods).\n<br />\n<br />He has also written several silly, clumsy books of his own, but has so far been unable to find a willing publisher. His manuscripts are scattered about the place.\n<br />\n<br />You can have a few short conversations with the man and/or say hello to his horse.\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b]Resources:[/b]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14134]OpenBooks Resource[/url] by Blary\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525]Modder's Resource Pack[/url] by Oaristys and Tony67\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53022]Jokerine's Misc Resources[/url] by Jokerine\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62954]Dwemer Shelves Resource[/url] by Nostromo79\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68755]Modder's Resource Pack - The Witcher Extension[/url] by Oaristys\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77097]The Witcher 3 Mega Resource Pack[/url] by LorSakyamuni\n<br />[url=http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page]UESP[/url] (information about alchemy/ingredients)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Tools:[/b] Creation Kit, TES5Edit, NifSkope, Optimizer Textures (Ordenador), BSAopt, Unfuzer, Audacity, Fuz-Extractor",
