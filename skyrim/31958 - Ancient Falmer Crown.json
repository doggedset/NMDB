  "descriptionHtml": "=================\r\nDescription:\r\n=================\r\nFor some reason, Bethesda decided to not include the Ancient Falmer Crown as an obtainable item in the game (a bug in my opinion). This left the Ancient Falmer Crown set pretty much unusable  since you get a huge armor rating boost in Skyrim for having a full set of one kind of armor. The only alternative was to wear the elven helmet, but that looks weird in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe armor itself is of elven material but of glass armor rating. So what I did was I modified the ancient falmer crown from a 0.00 armor rating to a 16.0 armor rating to match the glass helmet. I also changed it from a circlet to an armor head piece (meaning you can\\'t wear it with Archmage\\'s Robes or The Jagged Crown like it says here:\r\nhttp://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_Falmer_Crown. \r\nAnd I changed the material to consider it a piece of elven made armor instead of jewelry. \r\n\r\nThere are two versions of the mod: One that has the crown in Vythur\\'s inventory (but not wearing it), thus making him look just like he already does in Skyrim and an alternate version that has him wearing it (which I would assume gives him a higher armor rating as well).\r\n\r\n=================\r\nRequirements:\r\n=================\r\nDawnguard\r\n\r\n=================\r\nCompatibility:\r\n=================\r\nCompatible with anything that doesn\\'t modify the crown itself or Arch-Curate Vyrthur.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nLegal Usage:\r\n================= \r\nJust ask me first if you want to use the mod for anything.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nInspiration:\r\n=================\r\nGrZDem\\'s mod does a similar thing: \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21696 \r\nbut he just made Vyrthur equip the crown and it had no armor rating or material. And since he doesn\\'t seem to be updating it, I wanted to fix that since I think it\\'s a really cool piece of armor (probably my favorite in the game aesthetically). Thus I made this from scratch.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nInstallation:\r\n=================\r\nIt\\'s just an .esp so you can just press the \\\"Download With NMM\\\" button or drop it into your data folder. Esp can be loaded anywhere.\r\n\r\n=================\r\nOther Stuff\r\n=================\r\nThis is my first \\\"mod\\\" and I tried to keep it as clean in the Creation Kit as possible. All I did was modify the crown itself and Vyrthur, but please let me know if I did anything inefficiently and if there are any bugs. Thank you.",
