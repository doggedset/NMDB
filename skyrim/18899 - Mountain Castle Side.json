  "descriptionHtml": "[color=orange]Summary:[/color]\r\nPortals to Purchased Houses, Blacksmith, Smelter, Workbench, Grindstone, Tanning Rack, Wood Chopping Block, Cooking Pit, Enchanting and Alchemy Table, Chests, Weapon and Shield Racks, Mannequins, Library, a few Crops (potatoes, leeks, and wheat), Archery practice area, and a sleeping area.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]WARNING:[/b][/color]\r\nFor a brief moment I tried to improve my naming system, but that created problems. I started with naming the files \\\"MyCastle\\\" and I\\'ve decided to stick with it.\r\n\r\nFor those who downloaded the files named \\\"MountainCastleSide\\\" you\\'ll either have to\r\n1) rename future files to \\\"MountainCastleSide\\\" or\r\n2) remove everything you\\'ve stored through this mod and make the switch to the \\\"MyCastle\\\" files. Then delete the \\\"MountainCastleSide\\\" files.\r\n\r\nSorry for the great inconvenience.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Note:[/color]\r\n- At the bottom of the Armory tower go to the center of the white-wooden wall, it\\'s a hidden wall that\\'ll get you to the library and mannequin/weapon rack/shield rack rooms.\r\n- I have noticed that a few things (e.g. bridge and castle walls) don\\'t fully load up when you Fast-Travel to \\\"Mountain Castle Side.\\\" A quick fix is just to press the F5 key (quick save) and then the F9 key (quick load).\r\n- When I make my mods I test the lighting while using the following mod: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7654]Realistic Lighting and Customization[/url] (Skyrim Nexus)\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Trap Doors:[/color]\r\n- When you fast-travel you\\'ll show up at the beginning of the stone bridge (it\\'ll have the posts with dragon skulls), below those skulls (main image on mod site) you\\'ll see two trap doors on the inner part of the bridge. The left will take over to the back entrance area and the right will take you to the top.\r\n- In the living area, behind the bed, a trap door will take you to the pit area below the retractable bridges (also in living area). You\\'ll then see another trap door down there that\\'ll take you to the mannequin chamber.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Library:[/color]\r\nThe library I put together is made possible by an epic mod I found named \\\"Unlimited Bookshelves.\\\" This mod allows you to put anything you want on the shelf. Be careful, the mod may try to put the dragon skulls on the shelf, but if the item is larger than the shelf it may twitch and so-forth and you may risk loosing it. Below are links to this mod and I recommend visiting and reading their detailed description.\r\n\r\nYou use the bookshelves in the center of the room to access the large shelves on the wall. You\\'ll notice that the bookshelves are grouped together in threes and that each column of shelves on the wall have three sections. The bottom section is accessed by the left shelf and the top section is accessed by the right shelf.\r\n\r\nThere are also posts around the room, marking off square areas. Those are accessed by the single shelves in the center of the room. Although technically you could put anything you wanted to in these areas, I mainly made it for the dragon skulls.\r\n\r\n[color=orange]NOTE:[/color]\r\n\\\"Unlimited Bookshelves\\\" is not included in my mod, but is needed to have a working library. I wanted to encourage others to downloading or subscribing directly to this awesome mod.\r\n\r\nUnlimited Bookshelves can be found at:\r\nSkyrimNexus:  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10891]Unlimited Bookshelves[/url]\r\nSteam Workshop:  [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=13661]Unlimited Bookshelves[/url]\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Cloak Display:[/color]\r\nThere are extra mannequins that have their backs sticking slightly out of the wall to help display cloaks (assuming you have a cloak mod). It seems that the mannequins enjoy moving around a bit just before they freeze into their final positions. I have entered the room several times and haven\\'t noticed any big problems with it and I hope it stays that way.   :)\r\n\r\nA few cloak mods I\\'ve found:\r\nSkyrimNexus:  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12092]Cloaks of Skyrim[/url]\r\nSkyrimNexus:  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16337]Steel Soldiers with Cloaks (some cloaks and other stuff)[/url]\r\nSteam Workshop:  [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=60370043]Steel Soldiers with Cloaks (some cloaks and other stuff)[/url]\r\nSkyrimNexus:  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13486]Winter Is Coming Cloaks[/url]\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Living Area:[/color]\r\n- This will have your bed and some dressers and drawers.\r\n- I added a few crops (potatoes, leeks, and wheat).\r\n- There is a archery practice area.\r\n- If you drop anything down the pit area, see \\\"Trap Doors\\\" above.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Location:[/color]\r\nI\\'ve upload the map, but it\\'s southeast of Whiterun.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[color=orange]v1.5[/color]\r\n- Set all the zones as \\\"NoResetZones.\\\" Sorry about problems this may have caused.\r\n\r\n[color=orange]v1.4 (file pending, waiting on admin)[/color]\r\n- Added stables out front by stone bridge.\r\n\r\n[color=orange]v1.3[/color]\r\n- Added living area (bed, a few crops, and an archery practice area).\r\n- Added trap doors to help with navigation times.\r\n- Moved tanning rack into smithing area.\r\n\r\n[color=orange]v1.2[/color]\r\n- Improved lighting (hopefully) in the mannequin room and around the outside areas.\r\n- Added a more proper walkway to the back entrance.\r\n- Added gates around the tower, at the top of the main entrance.\r\n\r\n[color=orange]v1.1[/color]\r\n- Added mannequins with their backs sticking slightly out to help display cloaks (assuming you have a cloak mod).\r\n- Added an exit to Skyrim from the mannequin room.\r\n- Adjusted the ladders (in mannequin room).\r\n\r\n[color=orange]v1.0[/color]\r\n- Converted version name from 2012.06.16 to 1.0\r\n\r\n[color=orange]v2012.06.16[/color]\r\n- Original mod.",
