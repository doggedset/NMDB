  "descriptionHtml": "::Requirements::\r\nUpdate 1.8\r\n\r\n::About the mod::\r\n\r\nI made this mod because I wanted to have the option to choose at least one follower from each race. I noticed there were a lot of companion mods but most of them were skimpy female followers and I wanted a \\'bro\\' of both genders and not something I look at when I\\'m bored. I made sure I had a wide range of followers that will suit a lot of different play throughs.\r\nFollowers are at the same level as the player. Most of the followers are wearing low tier clothing/no armor so that when you give them armor they will equip it.\r\nThis mod is best used with Amazing Follower Tweaks.\r\n\r\n::Location and Description::\r\nFull disclosure; I\\'m not sure that I can make decent back stories for the followers that seems realistic but I\\'ll try afterward I upload and add some pictures..or if people actually care/downloading.\r\n\r\nBee and Barb in Riften \r\n-Locki the Imperial locksmith with Lycanthropy\r\n-Dar ri the Khajiit Ranger\r\n-Fargath the Altmer Assassin\r\n\r\nSilver-Blood Inn in Markarth\r\n-Relmina the Dunmer Thief/Dual daggers\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Hearth in Winterhold\r\n-Nero the Redguard Firemage\r\n-Jareth the Nord conjurer/icemage\r\n\r\nSleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood\r\n-Cutter the Breton 2h warrior\r\n-Malena the Bosmer 1h Warrior\r\n-Teekyus the Argonian Restoration/shock mage\r\n\r\nBannered Mare in Whiterun\r\n-Cnut the Orc Nightblade\r\n\r\n\r\n::Install::\r\nLet NMM do everything for you.\r\nDrop the data folder in your Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\n::Uninstall::\r\nRemove the files while they\\'re not following you.\r\n\r\n::Note::\r\nI\\'ve done some testing to each follower, they should be following and aiding in combat. I haven\\'t tested it more than that but there\\'s no reason for a problem to occur. I don\\'t know if Locki will transform on his own but if you have AFT he will when you tell him to. He\\'s meant to be a follower that lockpicks and steals for you, he should be able to unlock locks at expert level by level 15 or so. Teekyus might not heal you without AFT, as I said before I haven\\'t done vigorous testing yet.\r\nIf you have any suggestions or bug reports, let me know!\r\nI used Easy NPC Creation to adjust the colour of the skin on Cutter and Relmina.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! Don\\'t forget to endorse my mod if you plan to use it.",
