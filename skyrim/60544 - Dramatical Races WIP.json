  "summary": "This should make choosing a race really matter. You&#39;ll have to consider what your race is and what your enemy&#39;s race is if you want the advantage. This is meant to work with pretty much every mod out there, and to compliment difficultly and racial mods.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]WIP : \r<br />[size=5][size=2] This started as a proof of concept for individual weapon speed and weapon movement. [/size][/size]\r<br />In short   [size=2]\r<br />Passive buffs for races; buffs vary by race.[/size]\r<br />What does it Do?[/size]\r<br />   [size=2]This should make each race feel more unique without adding powers that you may or may not use. Ideally, you should only need to think about how each race might act, what they would use, what they would wear (etc.),  and you should reap the benefits. However, this is important for taking on your enemies as well. Some races move faster in general, but  when hampered by a heavy weapon and heavy armor, other races weapon speed and movement speed might shine through. However, I&#39;ve done my best to ensure they&#39;re subtle enough to not completely change gameplay, but noticeable enough to make a difference. Lastly, I wanted to make sure NPCs could benefit as much as the player can, which is why I took a passive approach (and compatibility). [/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=5]Right now:[/size][/b] [size=4]Warrior (done) \r<br />(Mage, Thief, and Imperial are in progress). \r<br />[/size]   I&#39;ve broken each race into 4 categories as seen above. For now, they will receive certain buffs in general, and some in situations. They&#39;re not too specific now, but they should feel  more noticeable in conjunction with the Individual Race module I have planned (still coming up with features, and working on balancing).  \r<br />\r<br />I just started graduate school, so it might be slow, so I&#39;m going to put the warrior part up as if for now.\r<br /> Fallout is coming, (ha) and I have other things planned, so I don&#39;t know how far I&#39;ll go with this. It started out as yet another private project, but I just [size=2]thought I would share[b]. [/b][b]I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m done with [/b][b]this project. There&#39;s other things I want to focus on, but I&#39;ll keep it here for people whom might still want to download it. :)[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=4]Tip: [/size]\r<br />   You&#39;ll want mods that increase the combat and stealth difficultly, add new perks, add new spells, and so forth. \r<br />   \r<br />[i]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />[size=5]In the works. (Skip-able) \r<br />[/size][/i][size=3]I&#39;ll include a file of the changes I have just made  and it will include the ones I&#39;m currently working on, I&#39;m about 1/4 of the way through.\r<br />\r<br />1.  Each Individual Race   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Still working on balancing and coming up with new features[/size]\r<br />      1. More buffs, more unique buffs \r<br />      2. More conditions: For example, you need to be moving with the right type of armor, some get deeper than that \r<br />      3. A few special skills (still passive): For example dodging\r<br />      4. NPC Specific Effects \r<br />[size=3]\r<br />2.  Man, Mur, and Beast (with considerations)   &lt;&lt;&lt; Mostly need to figure out the balancing here[/size]\r<br />      1. Re-balanced resistances\r<br />      2. Weaknesses\r<br />      3. Make magic harder to cast,  in general(mostly for NPCS) \r<br />      4. Adjust  player starting spells: Dark Evles start with basic fire spells and a few others, High Evles start with the most spells spread across the schools, Orcs know some enhancements, Nords will have a random chance to already know a word (might not do this), Khajits won&#39;t know any spells at all, etc. \r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Compatibility:[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Should work with most mods, let me know \r<br />Imperious Races will get a patch when I start doing more full versions, or if requested \r<br />SkyRe Races, I&#39;ve been given permission by T3done to include this in my mod so long as I give him credit (I will do that soon)\r<br />It should work fine with mods like Perkus Maximus or mods that modify weapon and damage speed \r<br />For now load it after any other race mod. \r<br />Mods that alter weapon speed and movement speed should be fine, but let me know.",
