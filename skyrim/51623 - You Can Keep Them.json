  "descriptionHtml": "*fixed issue with horses added to &#34;stolen horses&#34; count\r<br />\r<br />This is for all my fellow horse hoarders... ehrm, herders, out there&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The horses of Skyrim are very cute, but not particularly useful. And every now and then you meet a horse in the wilderness, and you can ride it but not keep it :(\r<br />\r<br />When I started using Convenient Horses and Automatic Variants, horses became so much more fun. Actually useful&#33; And with lots of different colors&#33; But I still wish I could keep the stray ones. So I made this very simple little mod that adds some stray and wild horses to Skyrim - horses that you can actually keep, because technically they are already yours.\r<br />\r<br />There aren&#39;t 1000000000000s of them. Only a few. They are called &#34;Stray Horse&#34;, &#34;Bandit Horse&#34;, &#34;Forsworn Horse&#34; and &#34;Wild Horse&#34;. &#34;Bandit Horse&#34; and &#34;Forsworn Horse&#34; can be found near bandit camps and Forsworn camps respectively. Wild Horse sometimes can be found in small groups, and sometimes alone. Stray Horse is often found near roads.\r<br />\r<br />Convenient Horses and Automatic Variants are recommended but not necessary for this mod.",
