  "modName": "Masculinized Level Lists",
  "summary": "Updates randomized NPCs to spawn primarily as males.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes most random vanilla NPCs into males. It does this by removing all of the female entries from the mixed-gender NPC level lists. So if for example you encounter a group of random bandits, all of the randomly generated bandits will be males instead of a mix of males and females.\r\n\r\nSome of the level lists are single gendered and I did not modify those. Notably, this includes vampires.\r\n[heading]Installation[/heading]\r\nThis mod adds three ESP files:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]MasculinizedLevelLists.esp - This is the main mod file and must be enabled.\r\n[*]MasculinizedLevelListsDG.esp - This is the supplemental file for Dawnguard. Disable if you do not have the Dawnguard DLC installed.\r\n[*]MasculinizedLevelListsDB.esp - This is the supplemental file for Dragonborn. Disable if you do not have the Dragonborn DLC installed.\r\n[/list]\r\nFor an existing game, only newly spawned NPCs will be affected initially. Places you have already visited won't be affected until they respawn. (UESP has an article that explains [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Respawning]when and how things respawn[/url].)\r\n[heading]Conflicts[/heading]\r\nI do not know of any specific mod conflicts. However, this mod is likely to conflict with other mods that modify the NPC level lists. If you have another mod installed that adds NPCs to the level lists, you should make sure the other mod loads after this mod.\r\n[heading]Credit[/heading]\r\nThis mod was inspired by Williham's [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22710]Feminized Level Lists[/url] mod, which does the exact opposite of this mod. (Obviously, it would be a bad idea to use the two mods together...)",
