  "descriptionHtml": "[size=1]Personal Note: English isn&#39;t my motherlanguage, so forgive me for the badly used words^^&#39; Also, this is my first mod, and i just started using the Creation-Kit, but since this only changes the preferred speed through quests, it most likely wont do anything bad to your game.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;[/size]\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;This mod is most likely suited for only a small group of players&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Npc&#39;s will walk instead of running in escorting quests, so you won&#39;t have to hurry up and follow them without looking around.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;This version only changes the way the game starts, it affects only Ralof and Hadvar.",
