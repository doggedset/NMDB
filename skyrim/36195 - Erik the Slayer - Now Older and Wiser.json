  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][b][i]Note: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1920/?]Erik is now available in SE[/url].[/i][/b][size=4][/size][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Erik is the son of Rorikstead&#39;s innkeeper, Mralki, and use to work as a farmer around the small community. After meeting up with an adventurer, who helped him learn the trade, he has had some time to learn being a mercenary ... at least in the local area.  Mainly fighting off bandits, vampires, and a few Forsworn while he protects the people of Rorikstead and the surrounding area.\r<br />\r<br />He has grown wiser, more experienced, and improved his skill.  While he still has his boyish enthusiasm he now looks older, has gained some muscle, and has a few battle scars.  During an adventure at a nearby crypt he found a long lost ancient Nord amulet that he proudly wears at all times, saying it helps protect him from physical attacks.  From a fight with an adept vampire he claimed the Ring of the Wolf which grants him protection against magical attacks.  Wanting greater mobility he retired his iron armor and replaced it with superior leather armor that he looted from a bandit chieftain.  He now feels he is better outfitted for some serious fighting.\r<br />\r<br />But he grows bored with Rorikstead and more then anything is hoping his friend the Dragonborn will return one day and take him on many exciting adventures. What say you? \r<br />\r<br />[heading]Description and Details[/heading]\r<br />This mod is a make-over of the default Erik the Slayer character.  It is stand alone in that it requires no other mods to run.  It is the same Erik just with a new look, some new abilities, new custom equipment, and more appropriate skills.  Here is a quick summary of the basic changes:\r<br />\r<br />- Barbarian custom armor thanks to hothtrooper44.  Includes cuirass and boots.  Bracers are hide.  Armor has had a small increase in AC to make it &#34;superior&#34; in rank.  Amulet adds 20 to AC.  Ring of the Wolf adds 17% magic resistance.  He also has a nice steel great sword.\r<br />- Custom class.  The original Erik was set for barbarian yet had shield, one handed, and heavy armor. I have redone his class to match his barbarian combat mode.  Weights (higher the value the faster those items will go up): Health 4, Stamina 2; 1H=1, 2H=3, Archery=2, LA=3, Sneak=2\r<br />- Essential and does not affect stealth detection\r<br />- Small boost to starting health and stamina\r<br />- Level changed to be 10 to 80\r<br />- Can be married\r<br />- Added some perks to help with combat and stealth (light foot, deepwound60, stealth80, agiledefender60, barbarian40).\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Compatibility[/heading]\r<br />It is compatible with any mod that is able to work with the vanilla version of Erik.  No scripts have been altered. He should work just fine with UFO and AFT or any other follower mod that works with baseline followers and NPC&#39;s.\r<br />\r<br />The outfit that Erik has as a default is based on the barbarian armor made by hothtrooper44.  He granted permission for me to extract just the armor pieces I needed and include them with Erik.  Most of the images are based on that, although a couple were using mods I had installed which includes the &#34;[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29167//?]aMidianBorn Textures For Immersive Armors and Lore-Friendly Armor Pack by Deandra and CaBaL[/url]&#34; mod, which I highly recommend&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Update 2013-12-03: I created an optional compatibility patch for using Erik with the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33117/?]Realistic Teeth Mod by Anton0028 and Brumbek[/url], which I highly recommend for anyone who wants highly detailed and perfect choppers :)\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Mods Used for Character Textures and Lighting[/heading]\r<br />A few people have asked what textures and mods I use for my characters, as well as the ENB, so wanted to list them here.\r<br />\r<br />CORE FILES:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2356/?]XCE - Xenius Character Enhancement by Xenius[/url] - Use for face, lips, eyes, skin pores, scars, dirt, war paint\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488/?]Better Males[/url] - Body by Sundracon\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30411/?]Brows by Hvergelmir[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28363/?]Beards by Hvergelmir[/url]\r<br />\r<br />OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4307/?]AOF Believable Hair -Female and Male- by AnOldFriend[/url] \r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25791/?]Male Face Tattoo by TairenSoul[/url] \r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27815/?]Fine Face Textures for Men by Urshi[/url] - I use an old face tint mod of his and some of the optional files.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33117/?]Realistic Teeth by Anton0028 and Brumbek[/url]\r<br />\r<br />ENB:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20781/?]Project ENB 119 Fantasy Preset High Quality by Bronze316[/url] - I also use his [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23812/?]Seasons of Skyrim[/url] when not using COT 3.1\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17802/?]COT 3.1[/url]\r<br />\r<br />I also use [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17609/?]Relighting Skyrim[/url] OR [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043/?]ELFX[/url] for additional lighting, along with any required mods by Project ENB.\r<br />\r<br />SAMPLES:\r<br />I added 8 sample pictures showing various face texture mods available on Nexus. All of the main pictures were done with XCE Faces, however the last 8 images I have labeled with the appropriate face textures:\r<br />\r<br />- 2 for Urshi Fine Faces\r<br />- 2 for Geonox Detailed Faces\r<br />- 2 for Smooth Faces for Ladies and Gents\r<br />- 2 Vanilla shots for comparison\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Permissions[/heading]\r<br />You are not allowed to upload this file to other sites under any circumstances.
