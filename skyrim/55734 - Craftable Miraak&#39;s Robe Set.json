  "descriptionHtml": "My first mod ever&#33;  I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t break anything.\r<br />\r<br />As it stands, the mod lets the player make and enchant his or her own version of Miraak&#39;s Robes as clothing, suited for pure mages,\r<br />\r<br />This does work with any mod that alters the texture of Miraak&#39;s robe set, as long as it actually affects Miraak&#39;s armor (as in not a standalone addition).\r<br />\r<br />Once the player has completed the quest On the Summit of Apocrypha, the recipe will become available at smithing forges everywhere.  The recipes do not need the original armor in any way.\r<br />\r<br />The recipes require (amounts not included here):\r<br />Robe - Leather Strips, Linen Wraps, Greater Soul Gem (Unfilled)\r<br />Boots - Leather, Leather Strips, Greater Soul Gem (Unfilled)\r<br />Gloves - Leather, Leather Strips, Dragon Bones, Greater Soul Gem (Unfilled)\r<br />Mask - Leather, Leather Strips, Silver Ingots, Greater Soul Gem (Unfilled)\r<br />\r<br />The above recipes are liable to be changed depending on suggestions and further scrutiny of the appearance of Miraak&#39;s Robes.\r<br />\r<br />I am also open to making a light armor version if people ask for it.\r<br />\r<br />Please post any comments/concerns/questions/suggestions in the discussion thread.",
