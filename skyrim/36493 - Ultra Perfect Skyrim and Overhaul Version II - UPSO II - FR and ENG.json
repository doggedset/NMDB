Already, I want to thank you for your interest in my work, or rather the results of my work. This work is available in English and French!\r\n\r\n[Center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img21/476/ultraperfectskyrimoverh.png[/img][/Center]\r\n\r\n[color=#BF4040][b]Ultra Perfect Skyrim and Overhaul[/b][/color]... Extensive program that these words evoke very subjective, moreover, it\\'s mainly the general idea (and direction) of this UPSO is evoked here. In other words, it\\'s for me an opportunity to help as many people as possible to make a new gaming experience for this fifth installment of the Elder Scrolls saga. It\\'s obvious that perfection doesn\\'t exist, maybe it can be touched, but nothing is certain. Especially when there are so perfectly that there are points of view, opinions, people. However, I suggest you go to a \\\"perfection\\\" among others.\r\n\r\n[Center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img21/5716/upsov21.png[/img][/Center]\r\n\r\nAdd mods to a game isn\\'t necessarily as simple as it may seem to leave, get very good results even less! Earn a lot of mods goes even further in trouble because a problem is needed quickly: compatibility! Who has never faced a crash rule in his computer after you try modding a game? Who ever spend hours perfecting a game and having to reinstall everything finally after mishandling or because of a faulty model and / or incompatible?\r\n\r\n[Center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img854/5540/upsov234.png[/img][/Center]\r\n\r\nThe UPSO v2.1 is to end this tedious path crosses with a success rate estimated at 95% (and yes installation, it\\'s unfortunately not possible that your computer can not bear  UPSO v2.1, despite all the precautions taken and all tests in advance on various configurations. I will let you see the minimum configuration directly in UPSO v2.1)\r\n\r\n[size=4]It\\'s time for you to learn more and discover more than 25 GB of modifying your Skyrim via [color=#BF4040]a complete tutorial[/color] for installing all the part of UPSO v2.1, without further ado, I invite you to click on the link below or download the file UPSO v2.1 (Video preview and link to the UPSO v2.1).[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Center][b][size=150][color=#BF4040]ULTRA PERFECT SKYRIM and OVERHAUL version 2.1[/color][/size][/b][/Center]\r\n[Center]Click on the picture below[/Center]\r\n[url=http://lapassiondumangaselonjinfuushen.over-blog.com/article-upso-v2-1-ultra-perfect-skyrim-and-overhaul-v2-1-language-117779994.html][Center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img854/476/ultraperfectskyrimoverh.png[/img][/Center][/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Center][size=5][color=#BF4040]UPSO 2.1: HOW USEFUL?[/color][/size][/Center]\r\nIf you have already installed the previous version of the UPSO, know that for upgrade to version 2.1, it is strongly recommended (required) uninstalling and reinstalling The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, having removed all the mods installed in your file \\\"Data\\\" of Skyrim, and unsubscribe from the UPSO on the Steam Workshop for Skyrim. The goal is to avoid inconsistencies and thus start with a blank Thurs\r\n\r\nIf by chance you have tested Version previous, you will find the following improvements for the UPSO 2.1:\r\n\r\n- Enhanced Graphics, additional HD textures, choice of several ENB.\r\n- More balanced gameplay, adjusted difficulty and aggressive AI réléchie resulting in epic battles, and a \\\"Legendary\\\" level within the competition.\r\n- Immersion further.\r\n- A \\\"bonus\\\" section consisting of additional mods for version 2.1, reserved for powerful configurations and fan total immersion!\r\n- New armor, new weapons, new spells.\r\n- New enemies in line with the universe Skyrim!\r\n- A display system configurable in-game detailed.\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nAll changes are explained in the record of the UPSO 2.1. Just Read it please.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center]PREVIEW[/center]\r\n[center][youtube]JY2YvnWkoOo[/youtube][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention and good game\r\n\r\n[url=http://lapassiondumangaselonjinfuushen.over-blog.com/pages/Sommaire_Accueil-8529588.html]Jinfuushen [/url]\r\n([url=http://lapassiondumangaselonjinfuushen.over-blog.com/categorie-12468235.html]Designer[/url], [url=http://lapassiondumangaselonjinfuushen.over-blog.com/pages/Manga-8529645.html]critical manga[/url], [url=http://lapassiondumangaselonjinfuushen.over-blog.com/categorie-12478631.html]critical video games[/url], [url=http://lapassiondumangaselonjinfuushen.over-blog.com/pages/Cinema-8529610.html]critical movies[/url])\r\n\r\n\r\n[Center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img690/5509/upsov210.png[/img][/Center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Center][img]http://papiers-incredimail.miroirdessonges.com/design/structure/separateur-int.png[/img][/Center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]* For reasons of ease of writing and design, UPSO v2.1 is on a web page. Excuse also the site design, which originally is a blog of some sort.\r\n\r\n** Sorry for my english, this is a simple translation.\r\n\r\n*** The merit of this v2.1 UPSO up to all the authors of mods, so I encourage you to thank them when you access them via the page setup guide, because without them none of this would have been possible. So do it please.\r\n\r\n**** UPSO v2.1 is a watered down version of, in a sense quite \\\"light\\\", which will suit many people as possible and especially be able to adapt to many configurations. A more complete and more beautiful graphically other Skyrim, is obviously possible. UPSO v2.1 is somehow a base on which to build mods to greatly improve his game;[/i]\r\n\r\n[Center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img405/1756/upsov227.png[/img][/Center]\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks related to the UPSO :\r\n[url=http://lapassiondumangaselonjinfuushen.over-blog.com/article-la-galerie-u-p-s-o-jeux-videos-117449527.html ]Preview UPSO 2.1 One[/url]\r\n[url=http://lapassiondumangaselonjinfuushen.over-blog.com/article-preview-2-upso-v2-1-la-galerie-u-p-s-o-jeux-videos-117662495.html ]Preview UPSO 2.1 Two[/url]\r\n[url=http://lapassiondumangaselonjinfuushen.over-blog.com/article-date-of-u-p-s-o-version-2-1---ultra-perfect-and-overhaul-skyrim---video-games-117998945.html ]Date for UPSO[/url]\r\n[url=http://lapassiondumangaselonjinfuushen.over-blog.com/article-obtenir-la-perfection-pour-skyrim-avec-u-p-s-o-premiere-partie-jeux-videos-117095556.html ]UPSO 1.0[/url]",
