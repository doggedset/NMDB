  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\n<br />[u][color=#ffd966][size=5]Cleaning the Official Master ESMs[/size][/color][/u]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]This guide assumes using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/?]TES5Edit v3.2.1[/url] on Skyrim Nexus,[/b]\n<br />[b]Or [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164/?]SSEEdit v3.2.1[/url] on Skyrim SE Nexus[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Due to this guide being dual purpose ( For Skyrim and Skyrim SE ) for the rest of this guide I will refer to both tools as [b]xEdit.[/b]\n<br />Screenshots of tools used may be one or the other, or older versions, which does not matter, the images are only to illustrate the method / options used.\n<br />\n<br />Why Clean the Master Files ?[/size]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />Firstly because the masters have entries that are [u][b]identical[/b][/u] to the same records in Skyrim.esm or other DLC esms'. They exist because Bethesda may have looked at something in the CK and an unneeded entry was auto included in the plugin even though the item was not altered in any way. The Official Creation Kits are notoriously buggy and randomly create dirty / wild edits, often when the author of the plugin is completely unaware. Wherever that plugin is placed in your load order its records overwrite all the conflicting records from plugins loaded before it ( the rule of one ) resetting the settings back to the values contained in the Official Bethesda DLC. It won't cause crashes, it just changes the values of plugins loaded before it. Which can alter mods that you have for Weapon Damage, Armor, Lighting, Food Effects and so on. The masters are very early in your load order but there is potential for a mod to be made as a fake.esm, and placed among them, and so ITMs in a later loading master may cause problems for that mods esm. Chance is remote that a master will affect another master, and this procedure is best used on all of your mods plugins, but cleaning everything of ITMs ( Identical to Master records ) causes no harm, is more optimal giving the game less to process in your load order, and so it is best to get rid of these completely unnecessary dirty edits.\n<br />\n<br />The Second reason is that Bethesda chose to delete some things that are in the Official DLC. Any mods loaded with references to deleted records from the Official Bethesda DLC will cause your game to crash. This problem particularly affects older mods ( especially mods that were made before newer official patches were released, with more deleted references the old mod did not anticipate - It will also become problematic for the Skyrim Special Edition community where old Original Skyrim mods are being converted to SSE, and Bethesda have deleted even more records from the plugins before they released the newer plugins for that version of the game ). xEdit can restore and properly assign values to these records that will disable them and still allow mods to access them. This is done using the \"Undelete and Disable References\" option.\n<br />\n<br />For further explanations of why it is still recommended to clean the games masters .. Read on from [url=https://afkmods.iguanadons.net/index.php?/topic/4110-manual-cleaning-skyrim-and-skyrim-se-master-files/&amp;page=4#comment-166166]this post[/url],\n<br />Zilav and Arthmoor, most valued technical and vastly experienced modding authors, weigh in on the subject.\n<br />\n<br />The following mostly apply to mod authors, but worth knowing about for mod users too :\n<br />\n<br />xEdit will also report when a mod has Deleted NavMeshes as part of the report from Automatic cleaning. Like deleted references, any mod that references a deleted NavMesh will cause Skyrim to Crash. Properly optimizing your mods NavMeshes and checking your mod for Deleted Vanilla NavMeshes ( which can also be caused by a CK wild edit even if you did not do it yourself ) is important. Mods altering the same cell and the same NavMeshes when your mod is not optimized will cause Skyrim to Crash. Poorly optimized NavMeshes with errors reported by the CK will make Skyrim unstable. Instabilities like fast travelling to a location and Skyrim crashes. Note the ones found to be deleted in the games masters, cannot be undeleted. To fix deleted Navmeshes in your mods, Arthmoor has provided a walkthrough in [url=https://afkmods.iguanadons.net/index.php?/topic/3337-skyrim-fixing-navmesh-deletion-using-tes5edit]Skyrim - Fixing Navmesh Deletion in TES5Edit\n<br />\n<br />[/url]Manually cleaning your mods is also important to remove wild edits. This is mostly down to the experience of Mod Authors to solve such problems, but there are a few noted later in this guide which are in the DLCs which everyone can easily Manually clean. Some mods can have accidental Wild Edits in them caused by the author looking at how Bethesda did something they wish their mod to do as well. These Wild Edits often prevent Skyrim from doing things like advancing quests, spawning NPCs, assigning dialogue to NPCs, preventing NPCs from patrol areas they are assigned to. They can also alter Vanilla Lighting and Triggers that the author wished to use. All of these things affect any plugin with conflicting records loaded before a mod with Wild Edits.\n<br />\n<br />Mod authors - Learn to use xEdit, and ensure the only records in your mod plugins are what you would expect to be in there, its the most important tool the community can make use of when used properly.\n<br />\n<br />Mod Users - Follow this guide...\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />Before moving on to the Manual cleaning, something everyone should do prior to Manual Cleaning :[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#00ffff][size=5][b]Automatic cleaning[/b] of Bethesda's ESMs with xEdit[/size][/color][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]With the games [/size][i]Original esm's[/i][size=4] installed ( You can use Steam to [/size][url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335]Verify Integrity of Game Cache[/url][size=4] of Skyrims files to ensure you have good error free copies of the original master files ), and in accordance with the following wiki article [/size][url=http://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Skyrim_Dirty_Plugins_List]http://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Skyrim_Dirty_Plugins_List[/url][size=4] :[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Load up xEdit.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00ffff]1.[/color] Right click the plugin selection screen and select \"none\"[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/4947-0-1487853683.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00ffff]2.[/color] Tick the relevant esm to edit, and click okay ( If you have not cleaned any of your Master files yet, the first one to tick will be Skyrims \"Update.esm\" ), then click Okay[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/4947-1-1487853683.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][i]After [u]each[/u] of the following actions, wait for a message in the message window that the previous operation has [/i][i]finished / Done[/i] :\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff]3.[/color] Right click the plugin after you get the \"Background Loader : Finished\" message,and choose \"Apply Filter for Cleaning\"[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/4947-2-1487853683.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Wait until Filtering is finished then ..\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff]4.[/color] Right click the plugin and choose Remove Identical to Master Records[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/4947-3-1487853683.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Wait until it finishes then ..\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff]5.[/color] Right click the plugin and choose Undelete and Disable references[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/4947-4-1487853683.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Wait until it finishes then ..[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00ffff]6.[/color] Close xEdit, and it should check with you that you wish to save the plugin ( this only happens if you have made any changes to the plugin to save, if it just closes ..

The sequence of cleaning mods plugins should be after you have your Load Order correct, clean them with the last to load being the last to clean. Mod authors should have done them already, so most will probably not need cleaning. Also look out for any mod specific cleaning instructions in the mods description. For example the Unofficial Patches will not need any cleaning, they are already done, and the remaining ITMs in those plugins should be left alone because they do have a purpose ..\n<br />( its a very rare occasion when this is true ).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u]For [b]Wrye Bash[/b] users[/u] : To make a BAIN for easy re-installations - Using the file uploaded here on [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/82342/?]Nexus[/url] as a template, extract it, put your Original and Cleaned esm's into the correct folders, then repack the whole thing as a Wrye Bash BAIN for easy installation ..\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/82342-0-1488636089.png[/img]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/4947-0-1487728400.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />( [color=#00ffff]YOU NEED TO DO YOUR OWN BECAUSE BETHESDA DO NOT ALLOW UPLOADING OF ITS MASTER PLUGINS[/color] )\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />To check CRCs Drag and Drop resulting files here [url=https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/crc32_checksum.html]https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/crc32_checksum.html[/url]\n<br />\n<br />To Check MD5 checksums Drag and Drop resulting files here [url=http://onlinemd5.com/]http://onlinemd5.com/[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[b]The xEdit Work In Progress Development topic is at the following link [/b]\n<br />[url=https://afkmods.iguanadons.net/index.php?/topic/3750-wipz-tes5edit/page-20#entry152079]http://afkmods.iguanadons.net/index.php?/topic/3750-wipz-tes5edit/page-20#entry152079[/url][/size][size=4][url=https://afkmods.iguanadons.net/index.php?/topic/3750-wipz-tes5edit/page-20#entry152079][/url][/size][/center]",
