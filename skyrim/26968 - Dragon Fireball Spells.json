  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds two spell tomes to Farengar\\'s office in Dragonsreach.\r\n\r\nThey will teach you two very overpowered spells that cost 0 magicka to cast.\r\n\r\n[b]Dragon Fireball[/b]\r\nA fireball like the ones dragons shout at you. Staggers on impact.\r\n\r\n[b]Dragon Fireball Force[/b]\r\nThe same, except it sends your target flying\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThis is my first mod ever. It was just a little project to get to know the creation kit and I wasn\\'t planning on uploading it at first, but I might aswell share since I have been looking for something like this, but never found it.",
