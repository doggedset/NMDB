  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=red][size=25]RCRN AE conjunction ENB[/size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/690/19zb.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/59/nfty.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=cyan][size=4]•INTRODUCTION[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this mod is not a part of the [color=red]RCRN AE[/color] mod, nor is it made by members of the [color=red]RCRN[/color] team (I am not one of them), it is just made to work with [color=red]RCRN AE[/color] in mind and is tweaked to work with [color=red]RCRN AE[/color] - classic preset. I am not trying to steal their glory or anything, I just really like how [color=red]RCRN AE[/color] looks and I believe it looks even better when [color=red]ENB[/color] elements are added, such as DoF.\r\n\r\nCurrently I made this mod for the 0.236 binary [color=red]ENB[/color] so you should use that version.\r\nAdded the no graphics improvements version to benefit from the [color=red]ENB[/color] speed/performance boost while suporting [color=red]RCRN[/color] of course. \r\nI also added another version that uses original processing but still adds depth-of-field (DoF) and other effects.\r\nThis is a work in progress meaning I will update it as often as I can to match the changes to the new versions of [color=red]ENB[/color], to bring you the newest features and upgrades as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=cyan][size=4]•INSTALLATION[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nSince this mod is intended to be used with [color=red]RCRN AE[/color] I will give installation details with that in mind.\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][size=2]STEP 1[/size][/color]\r\nGo  and download the latest [url=http://www.rcrncommunity.com/beta]RCRN AE beta[/url], and after the download is complete install it.\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][size=2]STEP 2 (choose one way of installing it, #2 is recommended):[/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=red]Variant #1[/color] - Automatic: Just install [color=red]RCRN AE[/color] (choose classic preset) and let it handle your files for you. The files to be copied are listed in step 3. I haven't tested it since I install my [color=red]ENB[/color]s manually, so I don't recommend it, and give no support for this way of installing.\r\n\r\n[color=red]Variant #2[/color] - Manually (a little more complicated but fail-proof, recommended): Install [color=red]RCRN AE[/color] (choose classic preset), after the installation is done, open your Skyrim folder (where [color=green]TESV.exe[/color], the game executable is located) and find the [color=green]d3d9.dll[/color] file, rename it to [color=green]RCRN_d3d9.dll[/color] (must be named like this to work, not case sensitive), and then copy the required files (listed in STEP 3).\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][size=2]STEP 3 (this is what files you need to copy to[/color] [color=red]Skyrim[/color] [color=yellow]main folder/[/color][color=red]RCRN[/color] [color=yellow]window, depending on what choice you made in step 2):[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nGo and download [url=http://enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0236.htm]original preset archive[/url] (this has to be done as posting some files is prohibited on Nexus sites). Once you downloaded it, open the archive and inside in the folder [color=green]WrapperVersion[/color] find and copy these files: \r\n[color=green]enbseries (folder)\r\nenbhost.exe\r\nd3d9.dll\r\nenbsunsprite.fx\r\nenbsunsprite.tga[/color]\r\n\r\nAfter that, just copy files from my archive to the same place where you just copied these files and you are good to go. Run the game and if everything is working okay you should see the difference once the game starts, as well as the [color=red]ENB[/color] letters at the beginning in the top left corner.\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][size=2]STEP 4 (OPTIONAL)[/size][/color]\r\nSpeed/performance boost and no processing versions: Copy the archive content to main Skyrim directory (where [color=green]TESV.exe[/color] is) and overwrite file(s) when prompted. Choose only one if you want to use either (they won't work together), since the speed/performance boost overrides all settings and prossecing version would have no effect in that case.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=cyan][size=4]•TROUBLESHOOTING[/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=teal]>>Performance<<[/color]\r\nIF you notice your game getting much laggier than before and FPS rate drop, it is normal when using [color=red]RCRN[/color]. It is not recommended to use it unless you have a quad-core processor, a powerful graphics card, and a lot of RAM. My [color=red]RCRN[/color] comes with a strong DoF that makes a major performance hit, so you might want to turn it off in the in-game [color=red]RCRN[/color] editor ([color=yellow]SHIFT + ENTER[/color] to activate it at any time while playing), just find the enable depth of field line and untick it.\r\n\r\n[color=teal]>>Working Issues<<[/color]\r\nif you are unsure if the [color=red]ENB[/color] is not working, you should see text in the top left corner of the screen once the intro and the main menu start saying [color=red]ENB[/color] version and details, to check if [color=red]RCRN[/color] is active press [color=yellow]PAUSE[/color] button on your keyboard to turn [color=red]RCRN[/color] on/off at any time and you should notice the difference. You can also switch [color=red]ENB[/color] on/off by pressing [color=yellow]SHIFT + F12[/color]. If both are missing you have done a very poor job of copying the files. If one of them is missing then most probably one of the two [color=green]d3d9.ddl[/color] files are missing, or you haven't renamed one properly, or one replaced the other. Just redo the 3 steps above and try not to miss anything.\r\n\r\n[color=teal]>>Elements<<[/color]\r\nI have purposely disabled [color=red]ENB bloom[/color], [color=red]SSAO/SSIL[/color] and adaptation, for I like it better that way, \r\nbut you can turn it on in-game with the [color=red]ENB[/color] editor by pressing [color=yellow]SHIFT+ENTER[/color]. Note that [color=red]RCRN[/color] adds a few [color=green].esp[/color] files to the mod list but doesn't activate them automatically. You need to do this manually by going to data files, or by using tools such as [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/modmanager]NMM Installer[/url] or [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1840]Wrye Bash[/url].\r\n\r\n[color=teal]>>Page tearing Issue<<[/color]\r\nWhen used in conjunction, [color=red]RCRN[/color] and [color=red]ENB[/color] make a page tearing effect on higher FPS rates. I found somewhat of a solution and it is already added to my preset, but if anyone is still having problem with that PM me and I will try & help. I have already posted a [url=http://www.rcrncommunity.com/forums/bug-reports/page-tearing-with-rcrn-on-high-fps]forum thread[/url] that explains how to solve this problem in much detail on the [color=redRCRN forum, here is a link to that thread for you to read before contacting me about it:\r\n\r\n[color=teal]>>Brightness<<[/color]\r\nThis preset (just like any) will have different brightness levels on different PCs, depending on what monitor you have and your software adjustments. I adjusted this to medium brightness in-game, so you can raise or lower it to match your taste. If you cannot make the screen bright/dark enough using game's own brightness settings, you could adjust it even further using in-game [color=red]ENB[/color] editor ([color=green]SHIFT+ENTER[/color] in-game to show/hide it). You can adjust the brightness value in the [color=yellow]-COLORCORRECTION[/color] section of the [color=green]enbseries.ini[/color], or the [color=yellow]CC: Brightness[/color] value of the [color=green]ENBEFFECT.FX[/color], both do the same thing [color=red](unavailable and not working when using speed boost optional)[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=teal]>>Suggestions<<[/color]\r\nI am open to suggestions from people, if you know at least the basics about [color=red]ENB[/color] and have an idea how to improve this preset you can PM me, but please refrain from ideas regarding personal preferences (for that I could create optional on-demand additions), and suggest only things that would be generally accepted for the benefit of all users. That said, I will provide on-demand optionals, but only for general stuff, I'm not gonna create an entire new preset just for stronger candle glow, weaker torches, or similiar minor changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=cyan][size=4]•PERMISSIONS[/size][/color]\r\n\r\nYou can do whatever you want with them for personal use, edit them, tweak and mix with other presets, it's all good, you can even use files to create your own presets and no additional permissions needed (a mention and to inform me via PM would be nice but not necessary), just bear in mind that credits in that case go to [color=red]Boris Vorontsonov[/color] for his amazing work in creating [color=red]ENB[/color], and to user [color=red]Kyokushinoyama[/color] for his custom shaders (if you use [color=green]enbbloom.fx[/color] and [color=green]enbeffectprepass.fx[/color] from my preset, you should aknowledge they are the work of his talent). I do not want my preset to be uploaded anywhere outside the Nexus sites, and I will never give permissions for that so don't even ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=cyan][size=4]•CREDITS[/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[url=http://enbdev.com]Boris Vorontsonov[/url]  for creating the [color=red]ENB series[/color]\r\n[url=http://www.rcrncommunity.com]RCRN team[/url] for their amazing mod\r\nUser [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3463021]Kyokushinoyama[/url] for his skill with making some great shaders\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com]Skyrim Nexus community[/url] for being a great place to find and share [color=red]Skyrim[/color] mods\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][size=8][color=pink]DON'T FORGET TO ENDORSE AND KEEP PLAYING WITH THIS CUTE KITTY ? ^_^[/size][/color][/center]\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.com/a/img850/1145/g3h.gif[/img][/center]",
