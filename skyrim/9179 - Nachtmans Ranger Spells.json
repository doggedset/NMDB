  "descriptionHtml": "Thanks for downloading Nacht Spells. \r\n\r\nThis contains four new summoning spells - it\\'ll allow you to summon a bear, an elk, a spider and a Spriggan. It also contains some armor designed to give you a bonus to marksman and a new bow. It\\'s all in a small shack to the east of Largashbur. \r\n\r\nI felt the base game didn\\'t have enough conjuration spells and I\\'m a fan of playing a ranger type character and I hope eventually to develop that in a mod.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you find any bugs or if you think the spells can be changed to balance better. I\\'ve tested them and they seem to work fine. This shouldn\\'t interfere with any other mods.\r\n\r\nAt the moment it\\'s just the spells and armor/weapon but I\\'ll be releasing a full quest and dungeon along with it soon.\r\n\r\nPlease do not include my work in another mod without permission from me (which I\\'m likely to grant).\r\n\r\nThanks for trying my mod and take care. \r\n\r\n\r\nTO INSTALL:\r\n\r\nEXTRACT THIS ARCHIVE TO THE MAIN SKYRIM DIRECTORY (WHERE TESV.EXE IS LOCATED). THIS WILL PLACE THE NACHTSPELLS.ESP IN THE DATA DIRECTORY. OR DO IT MANUALLY. I DON\\'T CARE. ACTIVATE IN YOUR SKYRIM LAUNCHER AND LAUNCH FROM THERE OR SKSE. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE THAT TWO .ESP FILES ARE INCLUDED. ONE THAT SAYS NACHTSPELLS AND NACHTSPELLS-FULL. THE FULL VERSION HAS THE BOW AND ARMOR IN A LITTLE SHACK EAST OF LARGASHBUR. THE REGULAR VERSION JUST HAS THE SPELLS SITTING IN THE RIVERWOOD INN IN THE ROOM ON THE RIGHT. CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER. ACTUALLY IF YOU HAD BOTH ENABLED IT WOULDN\\'T HURT ANYTHING EITHER.",
