  "summary": "A quick little mod that adds a light version of the Dragonplate Armor to any forge. Same stats as Dragonscale. Can be crafted and improved. DOES NOT CHANGE THE LOOK OF THE DRAGONPLATE ARMOR.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I looked all over the web and couldn\\'t find a mod that would add or replace the heavy armor Dragonplate with a light armor version. So I decided to give modding a try and came up with this.\r\n\r\nThis a standalone armor set. All you need is Iron, Leather, Leather Strips, Dragonbones, and the Dragon Armor Perk. Has same stats/weight/value as Dragonscale, just a different look. Can be crafted under the Dragon section at any forge and can be improved with more Dragonbones. This does not change how the Dragonplate Armor looks. It just changes the classification and adds \\\"Light\\\" in front of the name.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy my first mod!",
