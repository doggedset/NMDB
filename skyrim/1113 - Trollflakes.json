  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small retexture of snowflakes that are made all to look like the infamous Trollface.\r\n\r\nJust look at the images to see. \r\n\r\nThe faces are sadly hard to make out ingame unless you pause enough times in Snowy areas when it is snowing and then you should be able to see the lil Troll faces.\r\n\r\nThis is purly comical for the fans of Trollface in which I am. Those Comics have amused me ever since I found one a while back as the concept works so well. I also think it improves the snow abit too as it whitens the snow and adds character even if it trolls the heck out of you in the process.",
