Including new recipes and new raw meats from dogs, wolves, bears, sabre cats, clams, horkers, crabs, foxes and slaughterfish. Because you shouldn\\'t be able to starve to death, surrounded by the fresh corpses of wolves and bears.. Latest version 1.7 is also a realism overhaul that makes hunting lucrative and cooking important, scroll down for details\r\nAs I didn\\'t set out to release this, it\\'s not a patch esp but a replacer:\r\n[u]Replace[/u] NordNeeds.esp \r\n\r\n[b][i]With regards to compatibility with the many existing Nord Needs PATCHES, this should theoretically function just fine with any of them as it doesn\\'t change the fundamental Nord Needs systems[/b][/i] \r\n\r\n[heading]ALL CREDIT BELONGS TO USER: \\\"griffinsclaw\\\" FOR MAKING THE ORIGINAL MOD[/heading]\r\n\r\n[heading]FEATURES[/heading]\r\n[i]In addition to the original features found from the unpatched mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21384]here[/url]...[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Support for cannibalism - each feed equates to 1 small meal and 1 large drink\r\n[*]New meat types for better hunting: Wolf Meat, Dog Meat, Bear Meat, Sabre Cat Meat, Horker Meat, Fox Meat, Clam, Crab\r\n[*]New Nord Needs supported food recipes for improved cooking and incentive to gather ingredients: Gypsy Bread, Sandwich Beef Leek Tomato, Sandwich Margherita, Sandwich Chicken Salad, Wolf Ribs, Dog Ribs, Bear Roast, Sabre Cat Steak, Baked Clam, Crab Cake, Fox Ribs, Horker Loaf, Baked Potatoes, Potato Leek Soup, Chicken Mushroom Soup, Full Imperial Breakfast (lol?)))\r\n[*]All uncooked meats are renamed \\\"Raw <animal meat>\\\" so they group in inventory\r\n[*]Recipes reworked for balance; most large meals now require cooking, but small meals are much more readily available.\r\n[*]No salt in recipes** except pies because pastry needs salt\r\n[/list]\r\n[size=5][b]1.7+ - Complete realism overhaul of cooking and hunting[/b][/size]\r\n[list][*]All meats cost noticeable amounts of money now. Rough and common meats are cheapest\r\n[*]Raw meat is now [color=#992222]INEDIBLE[/color] and will make you unwell if you eat it so cooking is now as important as it is in real life\r\n[*]Cooked meats are now snacks or in some cases medium meals\r\n[*]Only proper cooked meals are now large meals - sandwiches, pies, stews, soups and some more\r\n[*]Added ~10 new recipes to make more meats useful with the new system and allow you to make things already found (Apple Cabbage Stew, Honey Nut Treat, etc)\r\n[*]Proper cooked meals are expensive to buy and lucrative to sell - you can now actually earn money by cooking or just hunting\r\n[*]Innkeepers sell almost every cooked meal now\r\n[*]Hunters and other meat vendors sell most raw meats now\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]I recommend using the in-game configuration (Magic > Powers) to set satiation levels to your taste. I set the limits to Food: 12 and Sleep: 16 (how many hours to go from 100% satiation to 0%) because those are roughly realistic values[/b]\r\n\r\n[heading]INSTALLATION[/heading]\r\nUnpack .rar contents to Data\\\\\r\n\r\n[heading]MY TOP MODS[/heading][b]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26544/][color=#33ffa6]Real Night Eye[/color][/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22300/][color=#85ff34]Summer Skyrim 3 HD[/url][/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34570/][color=#b0ff34]Summer Solstheim HD[/url][/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22287/][color=#fffd34]Skyhighrim[/url][/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27189][color=#ffb034]Shortcuts[/url][/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2692][color=#ff7734]Cinematic Fire FX 2 HD[/url][/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35008][color=#ff3434]Dogs Of Skyrim[/url][/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9206][color=#801a1a]Real Animals[/url][/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28501][color=#101010]Falkreath Skyscraper[/color][/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2063119][color=ffffff]More...[/color][/url][/b]\r\n[/font]",
