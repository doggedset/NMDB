I decided to convert the whole package and to add my own arrangements.\r<br />\r<br />The original tableware models and textures were created by JBVW for her Oblivion mod &#34;Vaernlor Manor&#34; (see credits.)\r<br />Riley Marks modified some of the original textures and retextured JBVW&#39;s dishes with them for her Oblivion resource &#34;Static dish sets&#34; (see credits).\r<br />All credits for the fabulous tableware go to JBVW and Riley Marks&#33; I only converted them. \r<br />\r<br />This basic tableware is included in the folder &#34;Tableware by jbvw_rileymarks&#34;.\r<br />I had to leave out some of RM&#39;s tableware as it was based on vanilla Oblivion content. \r<br />So I made my own mashups with Nifskope for the coffee pot, the coffee/tea cup, the sugar bowls and the vases, where I used the same textures on the metal. These have the prefix Tam.\r<br />\r<br />I used this tableware to make my own dish sets which are included in the folder &#34;Sets&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Most of the content in the folder &#34;Food&#34; was created by Stroti, they have the prefix Stroti (see credits).\r<br />The other food was made by me, including the donut which is a conversion of a free 3d resource (see credits), they have the prefix Tam. \r<br />\r<br />The roses were made by Lycanthrops for Emma and her Oblivion mod &#34;Red Rose Manor&#34; (see credits).\r<br />They both gave me the permission to convert and use them. A big thank-you for these wonderful flowers&#33;\r<br />\r<br />=====================================================================\r<br />\r<br />Important:\r<br />\r<br />All objects are statics.
