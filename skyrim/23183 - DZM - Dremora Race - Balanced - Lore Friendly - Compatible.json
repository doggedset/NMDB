This is the very lowest form, and the building blocks from which this Dremora Race mod will become great.\r<br />\r<br />I am currently looking for help getting the whole vampire thing sorted out. If anyone can test and let me know what happens, please do. I think it is setup correctly, but have yet to test&#33; I havent played into the game far enough for DG yet. Damn SCK...\r<br />\r<br />Keep in mind this mod is primarily made and continued for my own satisfaction. If you have ideas for improvements, let me know and I&#39;ll see what I can do.",
