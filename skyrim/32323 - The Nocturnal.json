The patron of the Thieves Guild, she, or rather, her absence, plays a major part in its questline. \r\n\r\nIn Skyrim, her shrine lies in the Inner Sanctum of the Twilight Sepulcher, where a portal to her realm from which luck seeps through is kept open by the Skeleton Key. Her influence lends subtle but vital luck, and for this reason, the Nightingales formed within the Guild to protect Nocturnal\\'s shrine and ensure obedience to her will. In exchange for protecting her shrine in both life and death, Nocturnal tips the odds to their favor.\r\n",
