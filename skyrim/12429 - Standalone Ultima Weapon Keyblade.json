  "summary": "Adds a standalone version of the Ultima Weapon Keyblade from the Kingdom Hearts series.",
  "descriptionHtml": "First off, full credits for this goes to DefaulTx, as he is the creator of the origin of this addition. In the original mod (found at http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5433) was a retexture of the iron sword, giving it the appearance of the Ultima Weapon keyblade. Considering the fact that iron weapons are extremely weak, giving this amazing weapon no justice, I\\'ve added it in as a standalone weapon using the same meshes/textures as the original upload.\r\n\r\nTo get in game, just go to any Blacksmith Forge and look under the Glass (Glass seems the most appropriate for this weapon, considering the design. <.<) tab. Also, it requires the same ingredients to craft as the Glass Sword, with the addition of an Orichalcum ingot to make it more similar to the KH series. ;]\r\n\r\nIf you happen to notice any problems through normal use on your own, please let me know and I\\'ll work on fixing it as soon as possible.",
