  "summary": "This is an Excel file containing all of the books in the game in alphabetical order. Check mark boxes are located next to the books for collectors to mark which books they have.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple Excel file that book collectors may find useful. I have placed check mark boxes next to the book titles so that you can check off the titles that you own.\r\nI created this file because despite using several different apps, I was never quite able to find something that suited exactly what I needed. Sometimes simplicity, coupled with the ability to simply print out a list can make things easier.\r\n\r\nTo get an easy to print list of all the books, select only the Own and Title columns and then print.\r\nPlease let me know if you find any typos, errors, omissions, etc.\r\nNote, there are no notes in this list.\r\nI sourced the original book list from The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages.\r\nI also made use of the app Collector\\'s Logbook: Skyrim as a cross-reference. I have no affiliation with the app, but I would recommend checking it out as you may find it useful.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend the following mods:\r\nUnread Books Glow by duggelz\r\nMakes books you haven\\'t read yet glow in the world--supremely useful!\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10012//?\r\n\r\nBreezehome Library by TRoaches\r\nLets you actually fit all your books in one large arrangement of bookshelves--in one room, on one floor!\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9563/?\r\n\r\nBook Covers Skyrim by doccdr and DanielCoffey\r\nReskins the books in Skyrim. Just get it!\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35399/?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nVersion History\t\r\nVersion 1\t         2013-07-09\r\n\t                 Some small edits. \r\n\t                 Added check boxes for collectors.\r\n\t                 Rearranged some of the volumed sets into numerical order.\r\n\t\r\nVersion 1.1\t2013-07-16\r\n\t                Added: Azura and the Box to the list.\r\n\t                Deleted the duplicate: A Children\\'s Anuad.\r\n\t                Deleted the extra check box by Chimarvamidium.\r\n\t                Fixed Vernaccus and Bourlor messed up lines.\r\n\t                Deleted the extra check box by Volk\\'s Journal.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2        2013-07-28\r\n                        Added: All Dawnguard and Dragonborn books (already had Hearthfire)\r\n                        Changed credits.",
