  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes Muiri\\'s default clothing to the wench outfit. Even if you use the console codes to change an NPC\\'s clothing, it will still revert back to the original after your next load. I was tired of her default clothing and decided to make a mod to change her outfit as default.\r\n\r\nI have not included the files for \\'A White Mini Dress\\'. You can get it from the link below and use my mod to make it load as default.\r\n\r\nThanks to -\r\nA White Mini Dress by Shoobydoo: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1233\r\nThis mod gave me the original idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n\r\nI love your lighting! What are your ENB/lighting settings?\r\n-Check out my modlist under my Skyrim Profile to see my specific cinematic lighting setup! There are detailed instructions in the Info/About me section of my profile!\r\n\r\nWhen I load my game: Muiri is still wearing her Vanilla outfit. Why?\r\n-The game has to reload her from scratch to reset her outfit. Keep the mod installed, leave the area(preferably through a loading screen), come back to reload and her outfit should be changed to the new version.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\nBest to install/uninstall with Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to install manually, just drop the .esp and the \\'meshes\\' folder into Skyrim\\'s Data folder. Make sure to enable the .esp in the launcher.\r\nTo uninstall MAKE SURE TO REMOVE BOTH FILES. ",
