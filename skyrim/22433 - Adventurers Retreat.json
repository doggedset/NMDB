  "descriptionHtml": "This is a Medium sized house perched on top of a waterfall just west of windhelm.\r\n\r\nThe house includes a enchanting table ,an alchemy area ,a target range ,a storage room ,a bedroom ,a balcony with a scenic view and a hidden cave behind the waterfall theres also a cooking pot and a smithing area inside the cave.\r\nI created it for myself but any suggestions are welcome and if you find any bugs please let me know.\r\nI may go in to more detail and make the house better looking but that depends on if people like it.I may also upload some more screen shots later.\r\n\r\n----To Install unzip the file to the skyrim data folder and select the plugin in the launcher or mod manager----\r\nIf you want an easier install go to the steam workshop version here - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=89223856\r\n\r\nCheers MrSimBo",
