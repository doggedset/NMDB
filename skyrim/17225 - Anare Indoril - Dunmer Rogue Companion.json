I inspired from Karliah while creating her. She resides at the Silver-Blood Inn in Markarth, leaning to a wall.\r\n\r\nINFO:\r\nWorks perfectly with UFO as long as UFO loads after this mod.\r\nWorks with No More Blocky Faces.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\r\nBetter Females by Bella\r\nProbably the latest Update\r\n\r\nUPDATES COMING:\r\nI\\'m planning to add a storyline and a mini-quest for her. But i need some scripters first, If you are good at scripting and coding, you can PM me.\r\n\r\nUSAGE OF MOD:\r\nYou can use this mod in your own mod with my permission, You can upload it to other sites by giving me credit. If you\\'re going to give me a \\'lil credit, I think there won\\'t be any problem.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL THANKS TO:\r\nBethesda.\r\nGriffin178 (For testing the UFO compability)",
