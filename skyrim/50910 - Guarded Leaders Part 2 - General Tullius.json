  "descriptionHtml": "Update - As requested, now more lore friendly: mages no longer wear Psijic robes, and the generic &#34;elite&#34; guards now wear standard Imperial armor.\r<br />\r<br />Part 1 - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50356/?\r<br />\r<br />Also check out my other mods:\r<br />\r<br />1 - True Clandestine Nightingale Hall - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35994/?\r<br />\r<br />2 - The Game - Thalmor plot of murder, betrayal and espionage (part 1) - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48233/?\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />\r<br />I have always wondered why the leaders of the two main factions had so little in the way of personal defense in the middle of an all-out war. You show up to the Jarl&#39;s doorstep and only a couple of guards stand between you and ending a civil war with one swift stroke of a poison dagger.\r<br />\r<br />Although it&#39;s true that both Tullius and Ulfric are &#34;essential&#34;, and the guards wouldn&#39;t stop you from approaching anyway no matter how many I put in there, my mod nonetheless tries to add a bit more realism and immersion by offering more &#34;protection&#34; to each leader.\r<br />\r<br />Specifically, this mod will add 10 NPCs to Castle Dour:\r<br />\r<br />6 elite guards; \r<br />2 elite wizards;\r<br />2 named &#34;heroic&#34; NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />(Note that in Part 1, Ulfric gets a couple extra guards.  This is for 2 reasons: 1) It would be too crowded in Castle Dour and 2) Tullius gets 2 powerful wizards who can both summon minions.  I feel this is a fair trade-off.)\r<br />\r<br />The base level of the NPCs is 50, and will defend any of their faction&#39;s guards or leaders as any other guard would - so if you plan on winning the civil war, you will either have to be quite the badass Dragonborn, or bring a small army - the latter of which I feel is more realistic.\r<br />\r<br />It seems silly how one player can just charge into enemy HQ and single-handedly win a civil war. The old &#34;invincible hero&#34; cutting through dozens of guards almost nonchalantly gets pretty old, if you ask me.\r<br />\r<br />This is only part 2 of the mod - it adds NPCs to Castle Dour in Solitude.  Part 1 takes care of Palace of Kings.\r<br />\r<br />Any comments, suggestions or bug reports are welcome.\r<br />\r<br />Please note that I have uploaded two versions - one with Cloaks of Skyrim enabled (you need this mod for it to function), and one without - it is completely independent and requires nothing.\r<br />\r<br />Future plans may include:\r<br />\r<br />1) merging the parts into a single file;\r<br />2) dealing with &#34;silent&#34; dialogue (this happens because I changed the default voices);\r<br />3) investigating the possibility of doing the remaining 6 holds.\r<br />\r<br />Credit:\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Cloaks of Skyrim&#34; by Noodles - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12092/?\r<br />\r<br />From his Permission section: &#34;If you just wish to use one of the cloak meshes for an armour/clothing/companion mod, then go ahead. You have permission to use the resources for anything along those lines.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t think he&#39;d have any issues with me borrowing a few of his cloaks, however if you are Noodles and do not wish me to use your mod as a master file, let me know.
