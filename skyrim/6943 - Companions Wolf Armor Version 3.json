  "summary": "Version 3 of my Companion\\'s Wolf Armor w/ Pants. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is the newest version of my Companion\\'s Wolf Armor w/ Pants, inspired by Nivea\\'s leather armor w/ pants mod.\r\n\r\nNewest additions:\r\nAdded a ragged looking skirt, to look more like the skirt was damaged through battles instead of just being removed entirely. \r\nFixed the knee pads on the pants for the Vanilla version textures so they match the armor somewhat more. \r\nChanged the darker version I had made with the black/blue to a Black and Silver version so more people would feel comfortable wearing it. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation Notes:\r\nYou can still use the other NIF files in my first release page for the pauldron-less version, the capeless version, etc. Just use the textures from Version 3 and overwrite your existing textures with them without installing the included NIF file.\r\nOriginal: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5442\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest:\r\nIf anyone is willing to make this a standalone craftable armor at the forge, please let me know. I know the Creation Kit is due out soon but I\\'d like to have a version thats standalone for everyone before then. Once it is released, I plan on making this a unique armor with a quest to obtain it in the Companions questline but for now a forge would work. :P",
