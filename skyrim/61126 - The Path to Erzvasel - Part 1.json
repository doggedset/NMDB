  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][u][b]The Path to Erzvasel - Part 1[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Courier New]- Direbrozel - [/font]\r<br />\r<br />Take part in the tail-end of a months-long expedition, heralded by one of Calcelmo&#39;s apprentices, a man named Ancevo. He had theorized that the Dwemer of Skyrim had done their own experiments into the divine - similar to what the ill-fated Dwemer of Morrowind had done - with apparently no success. All the same, it is a matter of academic pride to discover how far they had come to accessing Aetherius. \r<br />\r<br />The first leg of Ancevo&#39;s journey was a small Dwemer ruin named Direbrozel, a surface-level ruin near [b]Halldir&#39;s Cairn[/b] south of Falkreath. Explore and traverse the ancient ruin and maze to learn of Ancevo&#39;s next destination, and learn more of his expedition. \r<br />\r<br />I have been working on this quest mod for some time, but it&#39;s become far too large for me to work on at the moment, so I&#39;ve decided to slim the file down into separate dungeons, and see if it&#39;s still well received. \r<br />[b]\r<br />Installation:[/b]\r<br />- One ESP file needing to be placed in the Skyrim Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements:[/b]\r<br />- Skyrim\r<br />- Update\r<br />- Dragonborn\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s only a small dungeon, but I hope you enjoy this first part all the same&#33;\r<br />",
