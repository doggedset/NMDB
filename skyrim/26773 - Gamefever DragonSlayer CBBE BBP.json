  "descriptionHtml": "!st Armor I Made\r\n\r\nCBBE BBP\r\nOnly hair and shoulders are Vanilla assets\r\n\r\nNot going to make an ESP for now, you may make one and upload but not with my meshes.\r\nYou may make textures for upload but not with my meshes.\r\n\r\nI will not make make this fit other bodies.\r\nIt\\'s kinda high on poly count, I\\'ve reduced it many times, not interested in reducing further.  \r\nI have cut many faces from the body that would clip. I have run the high count pieces through poly reducer as many as 5 times.  The clean up was very tedious.\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\n-It should run fine, but it has a bit high poly count.  I have a GTX 550 TI and do not use much in texture replacers or things that add poly count to world space, I only occasionly use ENB for screenshots, and I run at FPS 60.  I run ASIS so I had to pick and choose and then tweak my ini file to get this.  Armor is fine for me but I use PC Exclusive Armor Path so only my toon wears the armor.\r\n-You need BBP skeleton for this to work without crashing, I have no idea if you can get it to work without it, I have not played without it since it became available for Skyrim.\r\n-This has 1024 sized UV\\'s and Textures that\\'s double the vanilla norm, not as high as some armor\\'s out there, 2 times most though\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nIt\\'s easy just unzip and dump it into your Skyrim Folder\r\nOr put the zip file in your Mod Manager Mod Folder of choice and tick it and run.\r\n\r\nPrograms Used\r\n-Blender 2.49B\r\n-Blender 2.63\r\n-Nifscope \r\n-Sculptris\r\n-Photoshop Elements 8\r\n-DDS Convertor 2\r\n\r\nPermissions \r\n-Do not upload my meshes!\r\n-You can make ESP \r\n-You can make textures (You\\'ll have to use Sculptris to avoid big headaches though)\r\n\r\nFuture Projects\r\nI\\'ll be making High Heels for a different body type.",
