  "descriptionHtml": "65 Framed wall pictures, intended as a modders resource not a playable file, it does however come with an .esp file that can be used in game.\r\nI made the pictures for a mod I\\'m currently working on, as I find Skyrim has very little in the way of interior decoration.\r\nI just thought I\\'d post them into a pack in case anyone else wanted to use them.\r\n\r\nThe mesh used is a retextured version of a standard Skyrim mesh that came with the game and all the pictures are of screenshots from Skyrim.",
