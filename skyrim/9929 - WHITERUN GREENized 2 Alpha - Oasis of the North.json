  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red]PLEASE NOTE; THIS MOD IS NO LONGER BEING WORKED UPON BY ME, IT IS THEREFORE ALRIGHT IF ANYBODY WISHES TO USE IT IN THEIR OWN ENDEAVOURS&#33; THE WHITERUN GREENIZED 2 ALPHA VERSION IS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM THE STEAM MIRROR FOR NOW.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />My Reasoning:\r<br />Whiterun was once a huge fortress/citadel town as is seen by all the ruined walls around and about, right? So what&#39;s the deal with there being no trees within an area surrounded by 10 foot walls that protect the entire hill from wind? It simply seemed wierd to me that there was one tree and practically no other vegetation. Yes, I know it&#39;s tundra, but who says tundra in Skyrim, a fantastical world, can&#39;t be different?\r<br />\r<br />[color=green] WHITERUN GREENIZED CONTENTS [/color]\r<br />[color=yellow]-trees now within city limits around the streets and such\r<br />-bushes and rocks around trees and seams in the landscape as well\r<br />-flowers and plants added to add color in areas most frequented\r<br />-hanging moss and lichens added to buildings to add an older, more &#39;companion-like&#39; feel[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=white]enjoy the mod and message me in the case of any disasters and/or catastrophic glitches/misplaced flora[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/imageshare/images/1133905-1329250163.jpg[/img]\r<br />",
