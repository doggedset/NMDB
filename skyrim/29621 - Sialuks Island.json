  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Sialukâ€™s Island[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This is my first modding attempt for Skyrim. The island is relatively small and it has a couple of bandits and a treasure to be found; Sialuk was obsessed with his treasure and figured that if he kept it in a chest in a far off island then he could hide it forver, alas his luck ran low when he was captured by bandits.\r<br />\r<br />You can travel to the island by going North West from Dawnstar and finding the rowboat with the manual; just activate the manual and you will find yourself in the island be ready to face an offense quickly.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy this mod, feedback is welcome,\r<br />[i]Lucky[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[color=teal][b]If you downloaded version 1 please download version 2. Version 1 doesn&#39;t contain critical files for the proper work of the mod and thus I screwed up my first release by overlooking a detail. I apologize for any inconvenience and I hope you will give the mod a second chance.\r<br />\r<br />Sincerely, Lucky[/b][/color]",
