  "descriptionHtml": "Require&#39;s Hearthfire and Dawnguard.\r<br />\r<br />This basic immersion mod make&#39;s it so you are unable to get resting bonuses as a vampire or another member of the undead such as a Lich or A Draugr or any other undead you somehow end up as, Vampire&#39;s will have to sleep in coffin&#39;s to get any restful benefit, it also works with all kinds of mod&#39;s that add undead races.\r<br />\r<br />As an added feature the Magic resist Bonuses vampire&#39;s receive has been increased from 10% to 20% to balance out the fact they can&#39;t get bonuses from regular beds.\r<br />\r<br />Incase you are wondering yes this will work with &#34;That Mod&#34; incase that mod touches the rested passive effects, it will also go good with my Undeath Race fix mod if you like to play as a Lich via Undeath.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: Message saying you are rested will still appear on the screen however there is little I can do about this, if anyone knows the solution go ahead and tell me and I will see what I can do.",
