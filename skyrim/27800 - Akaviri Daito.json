  "descriptionHtml": "So I found the Ebony Blade in the depths of Whiterun but didn\\'t wanna go around killing friends with it just to level it up.\r\n\r\nSo I\\'ve made a recipe under the Steel Smithing Perk.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s a Two-Handed Blade, using the Vanilla Ebony Blade Model.\r\n\r\nTo make it you MUST have Arcane Smithing checked.\r\n\r\nIt requires:\r\n\r\n3 Leather Strips.\r\n3 Steel Ingots.\r\n2 Refined Moonstone (All the best Samurai Blades are reputed to have Comet Iron in them, this is my approximation).\r\n1 Silver Ingot.\r\n\r\nUpgrading requires Corundrum Ingot.\r\n\r\nStarting Stats: \r\nInitial Damage = 54, with Critical Strike Damage of 20. \r\nWeight = 17. \r\nValue = 1300Gp.\r\n\r\nAt Legendary its Damage = 72\r\n\r\nThere is also no enchantment on it initially - Season to taste :)\r\n\r\nThis is a small thanks for everybody elses uploads that I\\'ve made use of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy . . .
