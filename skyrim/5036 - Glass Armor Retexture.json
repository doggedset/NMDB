  "descriptionHtml": "I usually play stealthy characters and this is my second attempt at making the light armor sets dark armor sets. This is my second time using photoshop. For now I only have the male version and not the weapons but I am currently working on the female version too so dont worry. I dont plan to make the weapon set as this set goes great with ebon and daedric weapons. Originally I tried to make the glass into an obsidian type of texture but I dont have the experience yet as this was my first time using Nifskope and second time using photoshop. I was forced to use Nifskope as the original light reflection of the glass armor did not go well with a red texture. But for now please enjoy my second retexture set.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n1. Download\r\n2. Unzip into your steam/steamapps/common directory, or manually place them manually.",
