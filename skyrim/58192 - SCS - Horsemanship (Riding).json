  "descriptionHtml": "[b][font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3]DESCRIPTION[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />This mod adds a Horsemanship (known as simply &#34;Riding&#34; in version 1.0) skill to Skyrim along with perks and its own perk tree. Although not technically dependant on it, this file requires the main [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56249/?]SCS - Skyrim Custom Skills[/url] files to work. [color=#e06666]Please visit the Main files&#39;s page for details about the mod&#39;s mechanics and installation instructions[/color].\r<br />\r<br />As of version 2.0, there is also a Lockpicking version which uses the perk tree slot created by &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21792/?]Merged Thievery Skill[/url]&#34; by LukeH. This version is &#34;standalone&#34; and does NOT need the main SCS file to work. Just download it and make sure it is loaded AFTER the Merged Thievery Skill mod in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3][b]ABOUT HORSEMANSHIP[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />I have always used Covenient Horses (CH) of course but there was one thing which always bothered me - I felt some of the features of CH are way too &#34;convenient&#34;&#33; (:-D) It is good for a casual gameplay but it gets in the way if you want to play Skyrim with your realism, hardcore and immersion mods. Having all those powerful options without the need to actually work for them. And what better way is there than to advance your skill und unlock perks? So I created this SCS module to provide an alternative to CH on the one hand and to keep ip as compatible with CH as possible for those who want to use them both (myself included) on the other. More on that down below.\r<br />\r<br />Unlike the previous versions of this mod which only gave combat benefits to the rider, the current version also affects the horses themselves in various ways. You can tell your horse to follow you or wait, train it to increase its stats based on your Horsemanship skill, craft, temper and enchant saddles and horse armors and more. Special thanks goes to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/851501]sushisqui[/url] for allowing me to include perks from his [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19867/?t]Ridin Dirty[/url] mod which bring the skill to a higher level. \r<br />\r<br />I also expanded the horse control options - you can now use MCM to bind keys to [color=#e06666]turn your horse around left and right on the spot[/color] (without falling from the cliff). It is not as smooth as I would like but it works and it&#39;s better than nothing.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3][b]INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />Unless you want to use the Lockpicking slot version, you MUST update the main SCS files to version 2.1 or bad things will happen.\r<br />\r<br />This mod incorporates horse equipment from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13348/?]Horse Armors for Skyrim[/url] by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/294935]mystikhybrid[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38548/?]Sethai and Elthrai Horse Armor[/url] by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3054798]gechbal[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19936/?]More Saddles[/url] by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4193782]Laup26[/url]. Those authors&#39; resources are NOT part of the main packages because if you are using Convenient Horses, all the necessary files are already included in CH&#39;s bsa files so you do not need to worry about it.\r<br />\r<br />If you are not using CH, you need to download the resources from the optional section of this mod&#39;s downloads. It contains meshes and textures from Horse Armors and Sethai and Elthrai Armors. Resources from More Saddles are not included because the author haven&#39;t yet answered whether I can upload the resources here but it&#39;s not really an issue because you can download the files from the original mod&#39;s page. Just head on [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19936/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D19936&pUp=1]here[/url], download the main file and install it (you don&#39;t have to activat the esp file, the resources will suffice), then download &#34;Saddle Compilation - Convenient Horses Saddle Replacer&#34; from the optional section and install it over the main file. (This is needed for the dawnguard saddle.) Now you should be all set.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3][b]IMPORTANT UPDATE NOTE[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />This SCS module was completely reworked for version 2.0 and is entirely incompatible with all previous versions. If you want to update, make sure you have no Riding perks or get rid of them if you do. (Setting it legendary - possibly after setting it to 100 via console - is an easy way to do it.) Then just dismount horse and wait 2 REAL-TIME minutes. After that save the game, quit Skyrim, uninstall the old version, load the game, save and quit again, install the new version and finally play.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3][b]COMPATIBILITY WITH CONVENIENT HORSES[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />SCS-Horsemanship is semi-compatible with CH - it will detect whether it is loaded alongside CH on the first startup and asjust some of its own settings and some of CH&#39;s setting to more compatible values (you can then set them back if you know what you&#39;re doing). As both mods are trying to do the same things they will clash sometimes, although more often you will simply have doubled options - one given by Horsemanship, the other by CH. Since there would be little reason to use this mod otherwise, I made it so that SCS has priority over CH where possible. Let&#39;s go through some of individual features:\r<br />- You should always use Horsemanship to toggle horse&#39;s follow/wait behavior. If the horse is following you via CH commands, tell it to wait via CH and then only use Horsemanship hotkeys.\r<br />- Combat behavior (Agressive/Foolhardy - Passive/Cowardly) will be effectively merged. Both options should work but again - you should use the Horsemanship one over the CH one (since it is Horsemanship that manages the compatibility - better safe than sorry).\r<br />- You should NEVER try to equip armor to your horses via the CH MCM menu.\r<br />- Horseback talk is totally different for both mods; you can use whichever one you prefer or both.\r<br />- CH horse charge should not be used but nothing bad - other than making the Trample perk somewhat pointless - will happen if it is.\r<br />- As for horse inventory: CH uses an &#34;external&#34; container while Horsemanship trades items directly with your horse. They can work alengside each other just fine so use whichever one you like.\r<br />- You should NOT use CH stat/speed buffs for horses.\r<br />- Autoloot and Horses for followers will have no issues whatsoever.\r<br />- There is an optional file called &#34;[color=#00ffff]SCS-Horsemandhip_CH_Patch.esp[/color]&#34; in the optional section. Use it if you want to disable the CH faction relationship changes - horses will keep their default relationships. (Don&#39;t worry that CH will still give you notifications about relationships being updated and so on, it won&#39;t have any effect.) It also disables CH dialogues so no more whistling and buying CH horns. \r<br />\r<br />There will still likely be some issues so feel free to post them in the comments. ;)\r<br />\r<br />[font=Georgia][color=#ff7700][size=3][b]PERKS[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />Saddler\r<br />Requires: Horsemanship 0\r<br />While mounted, press Sneak to access your horse&#39;s inventory, manage its equipment, set its combat behavior and train it.
