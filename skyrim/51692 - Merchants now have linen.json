  "summary": "",
  "descriptionHtml": "Thats pretty much it. The general merchants now carry a small amount of linen. I added a leveled list that as a 100% chance of adding linen to the general merchants in the vanilla game but also added linen to the Misc. Item leveled list so if you have a mod that adds a merchant who uses that list, they will have a small chance of having linen as well. \r<br />\r<br />I find this to be handy for people like me who use Complete Crafting Overhaul because a lot of the recipes it has use linen but you can&#39;t easily get linen without going deep into a dungeon. Since I play a sort of Requiem style where time is spent gathering resources at the beginning and leveling up before I go into dungeons, I found it annoying that I couldn&#39;t make basic items like cloaks. \r<br />\r<br />Anyways, just activate the ESP and put it anywhere in your load order.  \r<br />\r<br />NOTE - I accidentally deleted this from a week or so, its sort of a re-release. I&#39;m putting it back out there cause it had like 100 downloads. People love their linen&#33;",
