I imagine there are some people out there who might also be looking for such a plugin so please bear this in mind before posting any rage-comments.\r\n\r\n                                                       Description\r\n\r\n   This plugin changes the Impact Perk so it no longer has a stagger effect 100% of the time, no longer you\\'ll be able to Stun Lock a single target enemy which made Dragon fights too easy as long as you didn\\'t run out of Mana. This mod will force you to use more sophisticated tactics and potentially make the combat much more difficult and rewarding.\r\n   Expect to die a lot especially if you\\'re playing on higher difficulty where Stun-Locking is crucial at low levels. I included 3 different .esp files: 40%, 60% and 80% to give everyone some kind of preference choice, REMEBER to choose ONLY ONE.\r\n\r\n                                                       Installation\r\n\r\n   1. Download \\\"Impact - Perk Effect Reduction.rar\\\"\r\n   2. Extract the preffered .esp (the % stand for chance of activation, not % reduced chance), either 40%, 60% or 80% chance of stagger.\r\n   3. Place inside your /Data folder and remember to activate it via the TESV Launcher>Data Files\r\n   4. Have fun ;]\r\n\r\n                                                       Compability\r\n\r\n   No idea if this will even work for anyone except me , moreso if it conflicts with any other mods but I imagine it conflicts with other Perk altering mods.\r\n\r\n",
