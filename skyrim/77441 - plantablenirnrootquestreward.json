  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Feature:[/b]\r<br />After you turn in the quest Smooth Jazbay, Avrusa Sarethi will teach you how to grow nirnroot. Nirnroot becomes plantable in the hearthfire player homes.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Notes:\r<br />[/b]Please note that you won&#39;t experience anything different from the vanilla gameÂ when turning in the quest. However, when you next try planting anything at your home and have nirnroot in your inventory, you should see it show up in the list of plantable seeds.\r<br />This is my first foray into modding. If the mod doesn&#39;t work for you, I will probably not be able to help.",
