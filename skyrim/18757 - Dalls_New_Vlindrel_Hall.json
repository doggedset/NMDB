  "descriptionHtml": "---README---\r\n\r\nfor DALLs - New_Vlindrel_Hall\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n\r\n13/06/2012\r\n\r\nNew_Vlindrel_Hall is remake of so-named buyable house (PC Home) in Markarth. It improves on usual overcrowded \\\"toy-shop\\\" look all Bethesda\\'s interiors have and adds desperately needed (item) storage containers. Fixes and some new functions added as well.  \r\n\r\nIt is supplied as \\\"bare-bones\\\" mod! It can n will use whatever you have in your game Data folder but that is not how it should be! Use it - if you care to have it / see it as intended - with for it especially (pre) made HD textures - which can be found in my other (Dalls_\\\"whatever\\\") stand-alone (modular textures) mods: \r\n\r\nAlchemy_Workbench\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7866\r\n \r\nArcane_Enchanter \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4332\r\n\r\nCooking_Spit_n_Real_Fire\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8068\r\n\r\n\r\nNoble_Furniture\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7564\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo install you need to navigate to your Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim - game folder and paste / drag n drop in it my Data (mod) folder. Allow overwrite!    \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like this mod, simply delete / remove my mod .esp (plug-in) as well as (check for names my unpacked mod) files from Data/meshes/ DallsGear - and original Manor will be restored to your game.\r\n\r\nBugs/conflicts: none-known for fully furnished / finished House but as Decorating House piece-meal is in the fact - multi-layered process of (numerous) interrelated (item) swaps - some missed n overlooked in-between (decorating phases) anomalies are possible.\r\n  \r\nUse:\r\nFree to use but if any files included (therein) are to be used for modding ask me for permission!\r\n\r\nEnjoy and try to remember - if you like it even in a part - to give endorsement! \r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for really great game.\r\n\r\n",
