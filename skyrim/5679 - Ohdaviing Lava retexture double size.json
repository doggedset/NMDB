I left the original texture as a base, resize it to double the size and started adding detail. \r\n\r\nthe chest area , wings and head are mostly changed. I\\'ve made him into a Lava dragon , that\\'s why the translucent map is also changed, the lava cracks on his skin glow during night.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve also adjusted the alpha a bit , so his wings are a bit more damaged then the original model, the only thing i haven\\'t managed to do is change the normal map, because he shares it with the general dragon model and i\\'m too much of a noob to know how to give him a seperate normal map that doesn\\'t interfere with the dragon\\'s normal map.\r\n\r\nImportant : i\\'ve made this model mostly in mind with the usage of ENB, because it tends to make much better use of the translucent maps and it smooths out textures a lot better.\r\nPersonally i\\'m using the confident ENB mod that is available on skyrimnexus.\r\nVanilla skyrim makes higher resolution texture appear harsh , while ENB doesn\\'t for some reason.",
