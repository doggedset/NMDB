You need the \\'Daedric Smithing\\' perk!\r\n\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThe rose has different effects, depending on the enemy.\r\n\r\n- Humans and Creatures will go mad.\r\n- Undead flee.\r\n- Animals become peaceful.\r\n- Dragons are forced to land.\r\n\r\nThe staff has only very few charges and is expensive to reload.\r\nTo craft it you need dragon scales, human heart, daedra heart, briar heart and, most importantly, firewood.\r\n\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n-\tCopy file to skyrim/Data folder manually or via mod-manager.\r\n-\tActivate file via launcher or mod-manager.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n-\tDeactivate file via launcher or mod-manager.\r\n-\tDelete file from skyrim/Data folder manually or via mod-manager.\r\n\r\n======================\r\n\r\nOriginally, this was part of the NAEE mod:   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10329\r\nNow as standalone by request.\r\n\r\nPlease endorse and enjoy,\r\n\r\nJoe316",
