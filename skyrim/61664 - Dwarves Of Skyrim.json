  "descriptionHtml": "Hey all.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a new custom dwarf race. There is also a Nord Replacer Version\r<br />\r<br />I have always wanted a realistic dwarf skeleton/mesh like in Warhammer or Lord of the rings. I always said to myself &#34;why has no one created one?&#34; so i took matters into my own hands and decided to create one. I opened Nif Scope and managed to get to grips of editing a skeleton. After hours of editing the skeleton to make it like a dwarf, I have finally decided to release it.\r<br />\r<br />I have always wanted to see dwarves in Skyrim, so i thought the nords were the fitting race because of they are stubborn, proud and hate elves xD and of course the beards :p\r<br />\r<br />I will create a non replacer and just a race. Just not yet. You can do it easily in the creation kit if you know what you are doing.\r<br />\r<br />Of course, with every mod there is a bug or glitch. :p\r<br />\r<br />Problems are:\r<br />\r<br />- Some armour clipping issues, although not massively noticeable.\r<br />- When actors use furniture and furniture markers they will sometimes or always scale up.\r<br />- I have not found a way to increase the fatness of the legs yet. Hopefully i will\r<br />\r<br />This Mod edits the nord race skeleton, so anything that does the same thing, there will be issues. Make sure to put this near the bottom of your load order&#33;",
