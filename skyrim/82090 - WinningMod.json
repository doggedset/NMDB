Not sure.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: If you install this new mod after using the old one, make sure to remove and re add KBAR perk (because your abilities, powers, lesser powers will disappear and need re-adding). Also, your zItems will be gone (except your glass boots), so make sure to make new ones at a cookpot.\r<br />NOTE2: When using the flames mk2 lesser power, it will keep going until you draw a weapon (or your fists) or use another lesser power. You cannot jump while it is going, but you can attack. You cannot use shouts after stopping it through an ability until you use that ability a second time. You can use shouts if you stopped it by drawing a weapon (or your fists). Overall, it is interesting, but quirky.\r<br />\r<br />===\r<br />\r<br />Added a plasma beam standalone that grants a long range beam attack (meridia temple beam that does 8 million shock damage but ignores resistance etc) and a short range frostbite (8 million, ignores resistance etc).\r<br />\r<br />Type Help Plasma to find the code to add it through the console. You can either add the two spells individually or the perk which gives both.",
