  "descriptionHtml": "Not getting enough Bloodskal effects out of your weapon like me? This mod gives you spells that will rapid fire Bloodskal effects. You\\'ll get more Bloodskal strikes than you bargained for. Guaranteed.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the download zip file are some print-screen instructions on how to edit the spells\\' values and effects in Creation Kit to suit your needs. Feel free to edit the mod as you wish, but please give me due credit, it\\'s all I ask. Thanks!\r\n\r\nView video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12V6yivSdF0\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nYou must have Dragonborn DLC installed.\r\n\r\nHow to get the spells:\r\nI\\'m still a noob at modding, so I was only able to create the spells, but not make them available through a spellbook or some such in-game. So you\\'ll have to use the console to get both variations (horizontal and vertical) of the spell.\r\n\r\n1. Enter console.\r\n2. Type: \\\"      help barrage      \\\" without the inverted commas.\r\n3. The spells \\\"Bloodskal Barrage (Horizontal)\\\" and \\\"Bloodskal Barrage (Vertical)\\\" should be listed, along with their corresponding item codes.\r\n4. To get the spells, type: \\\"      player.addspell xxx      \\\" where xxx refers to the spell\\'s item code.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial mention:\r\nI would like to thank sparky1570\\'s Rapid Fire Arrow spell ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13803/? ) for inspiring me to make this mod.\r\n",
