  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to I Hate Hats.\r\nSome of us spend ages getting our player character to look just right. It\\'s a fair chunk of the fun to starting a new game of Skyrim. Takes even longer if you download and use any of the many excellent hair, makeup and eye mods found here on the nexus.\r\nBut what\\'s the first thing you do when you start playing?\r\nThat\\'s right. You whack a big tin bucket on your head to help you be that little bit less dead.\r\n\r\nSo I made craftable vanilla helmets in a standalone invisible flavor. This isn\\'t a replacer.\r\nThey\\'re still craftable, temperable, enchantable and droppable. You just can\\'t see them while they\\'re on your head.\r\nYou get the full set bonus too.\r\n\r\nNote that this now requires SACRIFICING your old helmet to make the invisible one. Make sure you really wanna do it.\r\n\r\nNo screenies \\'cause... well... They\\'re invisible. What would be the point?\r\n\r\nComing in future updates:\r\n-More Craftable Faction helmets.\r\n-DLC helmets (Already have the DG Heavy working, but didn\\'t want to let the DG version out without the new faction stuff, nor without the other DG stuff)\r\n-Peasant hats\r\n-Mage hats\r\n\r\nLet me know if you hit any bugs or missing hats. I\\'m pretty sure I checked them all, but I am but a lowly human.\r\n\r\nAll invisible hats can be found in the forge menu, with the same required perks as the regular ones. They should appear right below the regular helmets.\r\nSorry for clogging up your forge menu.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\nv1.2 - Added Guards and Thieves Guild. Guards are in Iron forge cat, Thieves in Leather. Now requires sacrificing your old helmet to make the invisible one.",
