  "descriptionHtml": "This adds alot of hostile Dwemer based NPCs to the many ruins of Skyrim. \r\nThese Dwemer also make use of the Dawnguard Crossbow so Dawnguard is ESSENTIAL for this mod to work.\r\nI am not thinking of making a non-DG version anytime soon.\r\n\r\nI was inspired by the Dwemer Specters mod seen on the Nexus but I wanted a more active experience with many Dwemer to face.\r\n\r\nThese guys are tough but easy to overcome. They have no magical attributes at the moment but will include later.\r\n\r\nSo far Blackreach & Alftand are full of Dwemer soldiers, they are ment to be hostile and in no ways friendly. They are there to prevent you from getting their valubles. \r\n\r\nThis mod is to make the Dwemer Ruins alive in away but still keep thier Dwemeryness.\r\nThere are ALOT of NPCs so watch out.\r\n\r\nFor some flipping reason the Dwemer do not fire the crossbows although I seen them trying to - could somebody help me address this and also make these guys more leveled?\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
