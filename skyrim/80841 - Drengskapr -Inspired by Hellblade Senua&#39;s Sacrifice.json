  "descriptionHtml": "I know I have been gone a while but I haven&#39;t stopped working on this. It&#39;s now a much bigger project than just a sword and there will be an original armor set and a character preset coming very soon&#33; I&#39;m still learning the CK but I would love to implement a quest as well.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />So this is the first official mod I&#39;ve ever made and it&#39;s a sword that is very much inspired by the game Hellblade&#33; I&#39;m so excited to play Ninja Theory&#39;s next game&#33; If they happen to see this, I want to say I love you guys and thank you&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I started making this around October of 2015. The reason it has taken me so long to finish it is because I couldn&#39;t find a tutorial for people that used Blender to make their assets (let alone a decent tutorial in general). Not only that, but I had trouble learning Nifskope. A tutorial I had found a while back, was confusing me and not very good at explaining things. Anyway, about 2 weeks ago, I found this tutorial and it worked&#33; Thank you BlazeLeeDragon&#33;\r<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwJDy5rNTmo&index=76&list=WL\r<br />\r<br />I want to improve the sword as well as add an armor set and a quest (once I learn how to do that).\r<br />\r<br />Feedback (constructive criticism) is welcome&#33; I hope you like it ;)",
