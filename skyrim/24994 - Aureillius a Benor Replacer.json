  "descriptionHtml": "My character\\'s trusted companion that is always up for a battle. This mod replaces the rather bland look of Benor of Morthal who can be a follower after besting him in a fistfight:) He doesn\\'t say much but he is a good man to have around:) All of his stats are the same as vanilla Benor as well as his armor and weapons. This is just a face edit.\r\n\r\nFor results like the pictures above you will need these mods:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/download/26469  Younger faces merged with Men by Geonox\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488 Better Males :FavoredSoulMeshes body of your choice\r\n http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13076 Cute Eyes by TkTk to avoid the tiny eye look.\r\n\r\nThe files say Benor but ingame his name will be Aureillius:)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation: \r\nNMM installation is recommended:)\r\nManual, put the Benor.ESP file in your skyrim/data file. The textures and meshes files drop into the Skyrim/Data file in textures and meshes. Hopefully you know the drill:) Open the Nexus Mod Manager to make sure the plugin is active and if you are running UFO make sure Benor plugin is after UFO in the load order.\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\n NMM simply just delete mod.\r\n Manual, Delete Benor.esp file from Skyrim/Data file. Delete 000135E8.dds and 000135E8.tgs in Data/textures/actors/character/FaceGenData/FaceTint file/skyrim.esp file. Delete 000135e8.nif  from your Skyrim/Data/Meshes/Actors/Character/FaceGenData/FaceGeom/Skyrim.esp file. Win.\r\n",
