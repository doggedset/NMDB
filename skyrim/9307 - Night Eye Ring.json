  "descriptionHtml": "My first submitted mod.\r<br />The &#34;Original&#34; Night Eye Ring.\r<br />Adds a craft-able ring to the Forge with a night eye enchantment. Requires one silver ingot to make in the jewelry section at the forge.\r<br />Uses Ring of Hircine model.\r<br />\r<br />Update: Version 1.1 has a night eye enchantment that can be applied to other items at the enchanting table.\r<br />\r<br />Perfect for the player that loves the dark but still wants to see where they are going. You don&#39;t have to catch a disease, get cursed or worse; play as a furry to see that Draugr in the dark corner. If you hot-key it then you can cruise through those dark, dank blind corners without fear of triggering one of those awful traps. \r<br />It was pretty simple to put together but I know there are still some people who would use this. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Kind of Important:[/color] Some ENBs change how the Vanilla Nighteye effect looks thereby rendering it useless to see by.\r<br />\r<br />This Mod is clean according to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25859]TESVEdit[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />Bethesda\r<br /> ",
