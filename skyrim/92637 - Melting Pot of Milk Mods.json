Use it on a cow/goat to milk it, this will cost you a little amount of mana and you won't gain any experience.\n<br />- Cows and goats won't provide you an infinite amount of milk. There's a chance, when you encounter a cow/goat for the first time, that it didn't calve recently : you won't be able to milk it. Its status is reset 5 days later. If it did calve recently, you can milk it, but the more you do, the less likely you are to obtain milk. When the cow/goat is out of milk, it will rest for 24h, and you'll be able to milk it again past this delay.\n<br />- Goats drop less milk bottle than cows.\n<br />- Adds two quests (one to obtain the milking spell, the other one to obtain recipes)\n<br />- Adds Sigaar\"s Sunlight Souffle, and Sigaar's Potage, dishes based on a book written by \"The Gourmet\"\n<br />- Adds two cows in Skyrim worldspace\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][b]Be a Milk Drinker[/b][/color] :\n<br />- Adds a lot of non-alcoholic drinks (juices), that can be bought or crafted.

You don't have to download the original mods to use Melting Pot of Milk Mods, I included and modified their files into my mod. You don't need  DLCs either.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Versions[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />There are two versions of this mod, choose among them and download the corresponding archive.\n<br />\n<br />1) MPMM - Standalone : Choose this version if you don't already have \"Be a Milk Drinker\", \"Drinks for the Thirsty\", or \"Farmers Sell Produce\".\n<br />\n<br />2) MPMM - Standard : Choose this version if you already have \"Be a Milk Drinker\", \"Drinks for the Thirsty\", or \"Farmers Sell Produce\". Let my files override the original ones.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Install\n<br />[/b][/size]\n<br />[b]Install with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager/]NMM[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194]Mod Organizer 2[/url] (recommended) [/b]: Download the archive. Upload the archive through the software, and follow the FOMOD instructions.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Manual Install :[/b] Not recommended ! Using NMM or MO2 would greatly ease the uninstall process. But if you insist ...\n<br />Copy-paste all files from the \"Main Files\" folder into the Data folder of Skyrim. If you're using the Standard Version, also copy-paste MPMM Patches.esp (in folder \"Patches\") into the Data folder. Copy-paste any optional mod you would like to add, and its .bsa (from the \"Optional Mods\" folder, to the Data folder).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Load order[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Load order of optional mods doesn't matter.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Standalone version [/b]: Load order doesn't matter.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Standard version[/b] : Please keep MPMM_MeltingPotMilkMods.esp [color=#f6b26b]BEFORE[/color] any other mod included in MPMM (it is marked as a master file on purpose).\n<br />Load MPMM Patches.esp [color=#f6b26b]AFTER[/color] any mod included in MPMM.

Basically, you can uninstall MPMM and continue using these optional mods, they will still work properly.\n<br />\n<br />Included mods all depend on MPMM.esp. If you want to uninstall MPMM, you will have to uninstall these plugins too (else you will have errors on game start).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Compatibility\n<br />[/b][/size]\n<br />This mod is [color=#93c47d][b]compatible with mods that :[/b][/color]\n<br />- modify cows or goats in any way\n<br />- modify food in any way \n<br />- modify / add cooking recipes\n<br />- modify the cooking feature\n<br />\n<br />This mod is [color=#e06666][b]not compatible with mods that :[/b][/color]\n<br />- change the selling list of innkeepers and/or apothecaries\n<br />- change Leveled Item Lists relative to food (please use Wrye Bash)\n<br />\n<br />This mod [color=#f1c232][b]has minor conflicts with mods that[/b][/color] :\n<br />- modify Velvet LeChance, White-Gold Tower, Cliff Racer, or Cyrodilic Brandy (If my mod is loaded before, they may stay marked as potion - not as food)\n<br />- modify Gourd (If my mod is loaded before, you may not be able to sell gourds to farmers)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Recommended mods[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />These two mods will greatly improve visual quality of drinks, for a better immersion !\n<br />Firstly, quilb's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62848]Retextures for Be a milk drinker[/url].
