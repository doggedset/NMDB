This mod aims to meld into the main Skyrim, and should never detract from the players immersion.\r\n\r\n_Current Version: 1.2\r\n\r\n_Features\r\n*Double the number of houses in the village, all are completely furnished with interior spaces and NavMeshing.\r\n*More NPC\\'s, including Kodoviig the Smith, his wife, and the farmers Skjer and Hegrid.\r\n*General village enhancements, including more animals, more farmland, a storehouse, and some small stone walls.\r\n\r\n_Known Bugs\r\n*Floating grass in some places due to a limitation of the CK.\r\n*Floating orphan Door on the hill (cannot reproduce locally, but confirmed by multiple users)\r\n\r\n_Change Log\r\n1.2\r\nFixed ground clipping for Smithy Objects.\r\nFixed Grey Face Bug.\r\nAdded New NPC Kahjro, look for the new Khajiti hunter above town.\r\nNavmesh refinements. I can\\'t promise this fixes everything, but it should smooth out a few things.\r\n\r\n1.1\r\nApplied some AI and NavMesh fixes, it appears possible that another mod is interfering with changes to the Rorikstead NavMesh... Until further testing I\\'ve removed any known compatibility, but hopefully they still work.\r\n*Dan\\'s Cozy Villages\r\n*More Carriages\r\n*The Reserve\r\n*More village Animals\r\n\r\nQuestions?
