If you do not use this or another skeleton I can not guarantee the functionality of this mod or a body similar to the pictures, because the design of the meshes were made through this skeleton.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]HDT Physics Extension[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53996/?]HDT Physics Extensions by HydrogensaysHDT[/url][/font][font=Times New Roman]\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#ff0000]BodySlide Outfit 2[/color]\r<br />Check if all the mod&#39;s are properly installed including optional files from BodySlide Outfit 2.\r<br />Racemenu Morphs for CBBE.\r<br />Pre-built CBBE HDT + Morphs or Pre-build CBBE + Morphs.\r<br />Open BodySlide Outfit.\r<br />Load armor through the group.\r<br />Select the &#34;Build Morphs&#34;.\r<br />Press the &#34;Batch Build&#34;.\r<br />Select all parts of the armor and press &#34;Build&#34;.\r<br />All Right&#33;[/center]\r<br />[/font][center][font=Times New Roman][color=#00ffff]Installation Tips:[/color] Read only if you are experiencing difficulties and need help with the installation process.\r<br />[/font][font=Times New Roman][color=#00ffff]Complete installation of all mod&#39;s:[/color] Not necessarily in that order at some points, but following that way you will not have problems.[/font][/center][font=Times New Roman][spoiler]1.

[BodySlide] BodySlide and Outfit Studio 2.\r<br />[color=#00ffff]* [Install the Plugin] RaceMenuMorphsCBBE.esp. &#34;If you are a RaceMenu user and disable this plugin of the Load Order if you are having problems with meshes, textures, sliders, CTD&#39;s or other possible issues, anyway this plugin only activates the sliders inside the Racemenu in game, even if you disable it you can use BodySlide out of the game. More information in the spoiler below&#34;.[/color]\r<br />* [Choose the Option] Pre-built CBBE HDT + Morphs or Pre-built CBBE + Morphs.\r<br />\r<br />[spoiler][color=#ff0000]My armor/body are stretching in all directions&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />This is a possible problem of incompatibility between mod&#39;s and settings. Initially I observe between Racemenu and BodySlide Outfit. I&#39;m not literally saying that the mod is broken or something, but there is a mismatch if you do not use the &#34;Build Morphs&#34; option. Seems to be related to armors that utilize zap sliders be it active or hidden does not matter.\r<br />[color=#ff0000]\r<br />BodySlide Outfit 2 - Configuration:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Open BodySlide Outfit.\r<br />Load armor through the group.\r<br />Select the &#34;Build Morphs&#34;.\r<br />Press the &#34;Batch Build&#34;.\r<br />Select all parts of the armor and press &#34;Build&#34;.\r<br />All Right&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Problems with Textures.[/color]\r<br />[color=#ff0000]\r<br />Every time I load the game my body/armor does not carry the textures.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Ok, as I mentioned before it is a problem of incompatibility between mod&#39;s, most precisely in the use of zap sliders and non-use of the build morphs. So for now, there is no definitive solution until someone update the plugin.\r<br />To resolve this problem just disable the &#34;RacemenumorphsCBBE.esp&#34;. By the way you still have the &#34;BodySlide Outfit 2&#34; that can be used more safely out of the game.[/spoiler]\r<br />\r<br />3. [Physics] HDT Physics Extensions.\r<br />\r<br />4.

[Enhanced Character Edit] [color=#00ffff]* I recommend putting in the last place of the Load Order.[/color]\r<br />Load Order for better compatibility and stability.\r<br />RaceMenu.esp\r<br />RaceMenuPlugin.esp\r<br />RaceMenuMorphsCBBE.esp\r<br />EnhancedCharacter Edit.esp\r<br />DualSheath Redux Patch.esp &#34;This is only an example you do not need that last&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />7. [RaceMenu] [color=#00ffff]* RaceMenuPlugin.esp This other plugin exclusive of the mod Racemenu is safer and I do not recommend disabling, otherwise you can not use your custom sliders, height, bicep size, breast size, breast curve size and glute size. In fact you can adjust the height of your character by command &#34;player.setscale X and the others sliders through the BodySlide&#34;.[/color]\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#ff0000]RaceMenu & Enhanced Character Edit \r<br />&#34;Here&#39;s a good tip for you&#34;[/color]\r<br /> \r<br />First of all make a backup of your save game, because these two mod&#39;s use scripts that can corrupt your save game, so make a backup. Performed the backup you can try this procedure.\r<br /> \r<br />To combine the Racemenu with Enhanced Character Edit, maybe this is not 100% possible, indeed, but there is a solution that I put into practice and it worked for me at least. You can migrate your character of the ECE for RaceMenu, but this process will only be for one character, because the saving via ECE slot is not compatible with the RaceMenu, but then you will use the saving via preset in the RaceMenu.\r<br /> \r<br />First of all you should be with RaceMenu uninstalled completely, another important factor that should be highlighted is that if you decide to perform this procedure in the middle of the game, probably your save game will be corrupted and you can not save more causing CTD&#39;s or Ugly Faces. At least for me I can not uninstall RaceMenu with ECE installed and continue to save my game without CTD&#39;s in the Save Games or Ugly Faces. As I said before these two mod&#39;s use scripts and DLL&#39;s files that can impact your game depending on how you install or uninstall it.\r<br /> \r<br />So this procedure is extremely recommendable to do on new game. So you install Enhanced Character Edit, create your character and then save the game. Get out of the game, install RaceMenu, enters the game and now you can save your character in a preset via RaceMenu. \r<br /> \r<br />Do not try to copy the ECE slots directly, because there is a significant difference in the size of the files and after attempting to use in the Racemenu interface will fail.\r<br /> \r<br />Obs. I recommend that Racemenu is in loose files and I believe the last updated version 3.4.5 is not in this format so for that reason if you are receiving the error message [color=#00ffff]&#34;Invalid RaceMenuBase script version detected&#34;[/color] you may need to extract the RaceMenu.bsa files and update with an optional version found on the same mod page.\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#00ffff]LooseBase Scripts v.3.1.0[/color]\r<br />Extract the files of the v.3.4.5 and replaces the necessary files from v.3.1.0. Compress it and use the Nexus Mod Manager for easy installation.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Tips: Racemenu & ECE saves the Preset, but does not save the settings and it is necessary to load the Preset in the Racemenu every time I load my game.[/color]\r<br />[spoiler]Obs. Ok everything working perfectly, except that for some reason I started to notice that my Racemenu is not saving my settings and every time I load my game or I die I need to open the Racemenu and reload my preset.\r<br />This is probably a problem of incompatibility between Racemenu and ECE, in fact the two mod&#39;s are not 100% compatible.\r<br />\r<br />Two Solutions I&#39;ve found so far:\r<br />\r<br />1. You load your preset every time.\r<br />\r<br />2. Recommended. The solution I found was to return to using only ECE along with XP32 Maximum Skeleton Extended XPMSE, because the plugin of this mod provides sliders like height, legtobodyproportion and also sliders like repositioning of weapons, bows, quivers etc. All can be found in the &#34;Body&#34; tab.\r<br />\r<br />Conclusion: So why use Racemenu? Well, Racemenu still has many advantages like a unique interface, many sliders, adjustable camera, etc.[/spoiler]\r<br /> \r<br />I hope this can help you to solve some doubts.[/spoiler]\r<br />\r<br />[/font][font=Times New Roman][color=#ff7700]Special Thanks/Credits\r<br />Petrovich for the original oblivion mod.\r<br />Corwyn, Daede and TeamFF for &#39;Fantasy Figures&#39;.\r<br />Kikaimegami for original chain mesh.\r<br />AlienSlof for original chain texture.\r<br />Ousnius Jeir and Caliente for the BodySlide Outfit 2.\r<br />HydrogensaysHDT for the HDT Physics.\r<br />XP32 & Groovtama for the skeleton reference.\r<br />Bethesda for the game.\r<br />Autodesk 3DS Max.\r<br />Nifskope.\r<br />GIMP.\r<br />Skyrim Creation Kit.\r<br />TES5Edit.\r<br />Nexus to host the files.[/color][/font]",
