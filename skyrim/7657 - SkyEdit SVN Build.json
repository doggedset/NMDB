  "summary": "A compiled version of Dave\\'s SkyEdit tool directly from his github. With NO modifications done on my part.",
  "descriptionHtml": "***IMPORTANT***\r\nThis is an SVN release. Meaning it is purely \\\"cutting-edge\\\" and has not been tested, approved, and released by Dave himself.\r\nI am building it because I use it. I think its an improvement, and I have yet to notice any problems over his old build.\r\n*********************\r\n\r\nHomepage of SkyEdit: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes5Mod:SkyEdit\r\n\r\nPlease refer to Dave\\'s page for this tool if you wish to have information such as FAQ\\'s, tutorials, feedback and bug reports.\r\nI am just facilitating a request from a few of my friends who kept making me compile his tool and figured if a few people wanted it, maybe more do.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a direct copy from his github I have made absolutely no changes to it myself.\r\nhttps://github.com/uesp/skyedit\r\n\r\nIf you wish to put a bug report on this page, rather then on his uesp site, I must ask that you use http://pastebin.com/ or something similar. It will help keep comments clean, without obfuscating certain characters or symbols.\r\n\r\n******************\r\nDave\\'s Changelog\r\n******************\t\r\n\r\n0.07alpha - ? February 2012\r\n\t- Redid Magic Effects\r\n\t- Redid Enchantments. A few important notes:\r\n\t\t- AutoCalc does not change the cost/charge as I don\\'t know the exact formula used.\r\n\t\t- It does not currently limit the types of effects which can be created like the\r\n\t\t  CK does. Using a bad type (like a contact effect type on an armor piece) has\r\n\t\t  unknown consequences within the game at the moment.\r\n\t- Scripts and string files are backed up according to their directory instead of\r\n\t  all being put into the backup root path. For example, script text files are\r\n\t  backed up into \\\"backup\\\\scripts\\\\source\\\\...\\\".\r\n\t- Fixed a few places where keywords weren\\'t able to be selected properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n========================================================\r\n0.06alpha - 11 February 2021\r\n\r\nCheck the Readme Section to see what all was changed from before.",
