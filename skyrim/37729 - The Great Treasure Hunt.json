  "modId": 37729.0,
  "modName": "The Great Treasure Hunt",
  "summary": "Adds a treasure hunt that requires the player to read journal entries and decode the clues that describe the world the location of the next journal entry. follow Dilbor\\'s letters to find his greatest hidden treasure.",
  "descriptionHtml": "*Requires*\r\nHearthfire DLC\r\n\r\n*Story*\r\nThe quest starts West of Whiterun just north of the Western Watchtower. Follow the tragic tale of a Breton named Dilbor, as you follow the clues he left in his journal. Being hunted down by the Thalmor has prompted Dilbor to hide his journal entries from them in an effort to keep his most valued possession hidden.\r\n\r\nThis will require the player to read the journal entries and use reasoning, and intelligence as they follow the journal entries and the descriptions left by Dilbor to locate the next one. Follow all 9 journal entries will eventually lead the player to uncovering his greatest treasure. \r\n\r\n*Features*\r\n1: This does not use the quest system, or use any waypoints. A treasure hunt game that gives way points felt too easy.\r\n2: The descriptions and clues from Dilbor\\'s Journal Entries should not be too hard to follow. \r\n3: The Treasure should be surprising. or at least unexpected.\r\n4: Dilbor and his starting journal entry can be found West of Whiterun and North of Western Watchtower.\r\n\r\n*Notes*\r\nMore adventures similar to this one have been added to another mod which will have any new quest/adventures added to it instead of separate esp files.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38000/?\r\nThis was created to give my wife something to do as she keeps looking for more expansions and quest for Skyrim. If this small mod is received well i have no problem creating more. Perhaps more expansive or harder.",
