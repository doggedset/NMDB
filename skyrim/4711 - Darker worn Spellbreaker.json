Overall darkens the texture, as well as adds an orange glow to the central orb.\r\n\r\nThis texture contains some parts of the original one, but they are darkened, and the amount of color has been reduced. Thus, this mod makes the \\\"Spellbreaker\\\" look fabulous with darker armors, such as the Nightingale and Dark Brotherhood armors.",
