  "summary": "The perfect weapon for the Listener of the Dark Brotherhood.",
  "descriptionHtml": "After the Great War, a former member of the Blades joined the Dark Brotherhood in an attempt to safeguard herself from the Thalmor.  During her tenure, her new brothers and sisters were impressed by her lethal efficiency due to her Blades training.  So impressive was she, that Sithis himself empowered (some would say &#34;corrupted&#34;) her sword, which had been in her family for generations, so that she would become an even more efficient killer.  It was the perfect weapon.  With every cut, the sword would drain more and more life out of the victim... and it would never need soul gems, for it fed on the victim&#39;s blood to sustain its power... which is why blood would never be seen on the blade.  However, her new &#34;honor&#34; would not last long.  She woke up one night to find a strange jester standing over her with her sword in his hand.  In the final second of her life, Sithis himself revealed to her her true purpose... to provide the perfect weapon for the future Listener.\r<br />\r<br />Soon afterward, the sword disappeared.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I love YYK&#39;s katanas so much, I just HAD to make this mod.  When I saw the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54172/?]YotoHatamonba sword[/url], I just KNEW that it was perfect for the Dark Brotherhood.    As I wrote in the description, this sword has an infinite charge.  And as this sword model doesn&#39;t have a blood texture, blood doesn&#39;t show up on the blade... but this particular sword doesn&#39;t keep blood on it for very long, anyway.\r<br />\r<br />I made two versions of the mod.  The first one you will find in the Dawnstar Sanctuary, in the room where you find Cicero when you chase him there.  The second version is for if you decide to destroy the Dark Brotherhood, then you&#39;ll find it in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to YYK and his team for making this incredible sword, and granting me permission.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE:  WHOOPS&#33;  In my haste to put this mod out, I forgot to make it able to be tempered.  Fixed that.",
