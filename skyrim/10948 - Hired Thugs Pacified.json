  "modName": "Hired Thugs Pacified",
  "summary": "Hired Thugs will no longer bother you! Comes in either Friendly Thugs or Hare Thugs version.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever had this happen to you - you are a wide-eyed level 2 nobody wandering through the world, minding your own business, when out of nowhere three omniscient super-thugs appear and rip you apart while town guards point and laugh, all because you stole that lavender sprig from Joe Somebody\\'s basement? If so, then this mod is for you. This mod comes in two flavors - Friendly Thugs and Hare Thugs. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n=====================\r\nFriendly Thugs - this version makes the hired thugs passive, and they will not attack the player. \r\n\r\nHare Thugs - in case making the thugs passive was not good enough for you, this version turns all Hired Thugs into Rabbits! \r\n\r\nThis only affects the thugs which are sent to kill you after you have stolen something, not normal thugs or bandits. This mod could be considered a \\'cheat\\' mod, but due to the incredibly bad scripting of the Hired Thugs radiant quest I thought it best to simply neuter the problem until it is fixed. I find passive thugs preferable to non-existent thugs because you can still find out who sent them. \r\n\r\nINSTALLATION \r\n=====================\r\n1. Download with NMM or\r\n2. Drop either .esp into your Data folder\r\n\r\nThis mod should not conflict with any other mods unless they also edit the Hired Thug npcs. Friendly Thugs simply edits the Hired Thugs factions, and Hare Thugs simply edits their base actor. \r\n",
