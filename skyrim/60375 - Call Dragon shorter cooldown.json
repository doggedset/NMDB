  "descriptionHtml": " I&#39;ve always liked the idea of having a dragon servant to aid you in battle or carry you around on it&#39;s back. So everytime I need to travel somewhere far I use Call Dragon and then use Bend Will on Odahviing. The problem is, since Call Dragon have such a long cooldown, that&#39;s kind tricky because by the time your shout cooldown refreshes (allowing you to use Bend Will) Odahviing has already fled away.\r<br /> There are a few tricks to Bend his Will anyway but I find it annoying to have to go through all that trouble just to fly on Odahviing&#39;s back. I mean, he&#39;s supposed to be your servant/ally right?\r<br /> So this is why I&#39;ve created this mod. It&#39;s just a very small plugin that reduces the cooldown for the Call Dragon shout.\r<br />\r<br />Before:\r<br />\r<br />First word: 5 sec\r<br />Second word: 5 sec\r<br />Third word: 300 sec (lol srsly?)\r<br />\r<br />Now:\r<br />\r<br />First word: 5 sec\r<br />Second word: 5 sec\r<br />Third word: 5 sec\r<br />\r<br />Some people may find this unbalanced but come on, one of the shouts with the shortest cooldowns in the game allows you to control the freaking weather. If controlling the wheater is such an easy task, using the Voice to shout a name should be child&#39;s play.",
