  "descriptionHtml": "Cinn is a young thief with a love for adventure, and anything shiny.\r\nWhen Cinn isn’t out exploring the world, she spends her time in Solitude at the “Winking Skeever”. She can normally be found upstairs discreetly listening in on traveler\\'s conversations, getting information for her next heist or adventure. \r\n\r\nCinn is one of the top archers in Skyrim, and she is quite skilled at moving around unnoticed. She will most likely be wearing a barmaids outfit, making it easier to blend in.\r\n\r\nCinn is an Essential auto leveling companion and from what I tested she was UFO compatible\r\n\r\nCinn is made after Cinn-Ransome from deviant Art as requested from Cinn.\r\nhttp://cinn-ransome.deviantart.com/ not all of her Art is Safe for work",
