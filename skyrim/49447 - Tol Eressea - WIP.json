  "descriptionHtml": "With beginning of this new year, I wanted to present my ongoing work on a new land creation : a lost island... somewhere.\r<br />\r<br />Welcome in my world&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Sorry, no file to download yet (only screenshots)... Still lot of work to do&#33;\r<br />I simply wish I could finish it one day&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Note that all models are original ones. Part of this work was first made for oblivion, and used in an unplublished mod.\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Credits\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Great thank all the community for all the mods realized.\r<br />I have to admit that I downloaded plenty of them and learned a lot for modding, by analyzing the way they are done.\r<br />\r<br />Note that this is only a WIP and some material (mainly textures) could have been used just to go faster in the rendering. \r<br />All credits will be made and authorizations will be asked, when files will be posted.\r<br />\r<br />Special thanks to:\r<br />- Elinen, and her great tutorial&#39;s on world creation for Hoddminir : http://hoddminir.blogspot.com\r<br />- Ethatron, for Oscape (used for lod generation) : http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4727\r<br />- LightWave, for TESAnnwyn (used for the landscape generation) : http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1311730-release-tesannwyn-and-tes4qlod-for-skyrim/\r<br />- dimon99 for the UNP female body I use in the game : http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to :\r<br />- Growlf for the design of the Santa Clothes which the shown one is based on.
