  "summary": "A quaint little shack, perfect for the new adventurer or startin' hunter needin' a place to call home.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Seated right outside of Riverwood for easy acces to a tradin' village, and surrounded by the forest so you can hunt to thrive, and fish on your down time.\n<br />A nice little player home with the convenience of bein' located right outside the first village you encounter. (Save for any Alternate Start mods where, obviously, Riverwood wouldn't be your first village. But, I digress).I'm still fairly new to makin' mods, so, obviously this ain't much. However, who doesn't love nice player homes you don't have to pay for or do a quest for?\n<br />\n<br />If there's any issues/bugs, please let me know. Feedback is appreciated.Enjoy this lovely player home, the Hunter's Shack.",
