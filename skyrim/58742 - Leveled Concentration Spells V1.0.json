  "summary": "Finally, those cool concentration spells can be used for more then 2 levels. Your welcome.",
  "descriptionHtml": "If your like me, then the idea of bathing your enemies in pillars of fire from your hands is fun as Oblivion. Too bad the spells to do that are completely weak sauce right? Not any more. This mod adds more powerful versions of the spells flames, frostbite, and sparks to the game. They have been integrated into the leveled lists of the game so that this mod fits into game-play as seamlessly as possible. This means that once your at the right level, they will start appearing as loot. You can also acquire them from spell vendors (namely the destruction teacher at the College of Winterhold) as soon as you have a ahigh enough destruction level.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-Spells-\r<br />   \r<br />Apprentice level: shock, smolder, icy wind\r<br />\r<br />Adept level: thunder arc, deathly chill, drake&#39;s breath\r<br />\r<br />Expert level: storm surge, snow storm, flame thrower\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />requirements: the game Skyrim (duh :3)\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts: Since this mod was made from scratch, there shouldn&#39;t be any.\r<br />\r<br />If you have any questions, leave them in the comments. I&#39;m on this site looking for mods almost every day.\r<br />Seriously. I love feedback, positive or negative. It lets me know what I have to fix and what I can improve.\r<br />\r<br />Peace.",
