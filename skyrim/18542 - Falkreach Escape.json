  "descriptionHtml": "This is my VERY first mod ever. So all of this is a learning process for me. PLEASE report any bugs, or glitches. Let me know how the top floor looks, i couldnt use my snap grid up there so any holes will be appreciated to note. It may seem kinda open, its because i wanna hear from you on how to expand. I wanna build a dream home not my home.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />As always NMM to instail or Ext files into skyrim data folders\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />My friend dropped my pc and crashed my hard drive. I won&#39;t be able to NavMesh it tonight or put in some more clutter for a home feeling to it. Nor add a archery range and a small hunter shack. As soon as I get a new hard drive I will continue on with the mod to provide more into my first mod \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits goes to:\r<br />Bethesda for an amazing RPG game ",
