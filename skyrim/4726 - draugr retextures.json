  "summary": "Complete overhaul of the draugr. New looking armour and weapons.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is complete overhaul of the draugr weapons and armour. Both have been significantly lightened to look more like silver, or metal, and the rust has been intensified to live up to the \\\"Ancient\\\" description. And....a hint of gold :p\r\n\r\n1.1\r\n - modified the armour to look less gold and more rusted metal, now also includes helmet, cloth and breastplate.\r\n - dulled down the plastic looking gold textures on all\r\n - added more rust to most, and made the wooden parts of the bow, battleaxe and arrows appear more rotten.\r\n - Added cobwebs to everything to make them look like they have been sitting in a tomb for centuries (although these sadly are not coming up in the game quite as strong as i had hoped. Yet...you can mainly see them on the blade of the battleaxe)\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\nI don\\'t play first person at all but its been pointed out that in dark places the first person weapons have a border around them. I\\'m looking into sorting this as soon as i can.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add suggestions, help (please!) or questions\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nextract to anywhere (desktop etc.) then open draugroverhaul folder. Drop actors folder in skyrim/data/textures folder and repeat for weapons folder, overwriting when prompted.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nDelete both folders labelled draugr in actors and weapons folders. (be sure to leave any other .dds files if you have more mods that affect draugr)\r\n\r\nMany Thanks!",
