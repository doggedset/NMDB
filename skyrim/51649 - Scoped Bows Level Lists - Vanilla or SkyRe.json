Reloaded the safe and bought a scoped glass bow. I loaded a save in rifton and bought a silver dwarven sniper. Awesome to see my work merged into the game like this&#33; :D[/i][/quote]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Georgia][color=#6aa84f][size=3][b][u]What it does[/u][/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]Adds the new Scoped Bows to the level lists, for distribution throughout Skyrim, including the merchants.[/*]\r<br />[*]Every vanilla level list that contains bows has had its new variant added to the same list. The only exceptions are common sense ones (Some lists are created in a way to use &#34;only these items&#34;. Some are created to use &#34;one of the following&#34;). [/*]\r<br />[*]Bows have been added at top end of vanilla versions in the lists. (this means that the list has level 4,5,6, and 7 of the bow. I added variants at level 7. [/*]\r<br />[*]Only 1 bow of each type added to each of the lists. Hopefully this will keep the rarity level high. All bows follow the vanilla games level allotments. I have simply added the new variants next to the vanilla versions. So no early items, unless your craft them.[/*]\r<br />[*]Because of the 3 versions of Dwarven Bows....They are more likely to appear than any other bows.[/*]\r<br />[*]Penitus Guards, and Thalmor are supposed to be top level fighters, so they get the Scoped Bows.[/*]\r<br />[*]There are NO enchanted versions around, because that would require me to make each variation of the weapon in CK and add it in. Sorry but that&#39;s just not gonna happen.[/*]\r<br />[*]Falmer are NOT given Scoped Bows in their level list. Falmer are blind and hunt by sound. I am considering it a third party alteration.[/*]\r<br />[*]Civil war level lists have been ignored. I figure, its a war&#33; There&#39;s a shortage of stuff and things, so its gonna be hard to get the bits you need to make this addition to your bow when your in the middle of a war. They may still show up, but not from Civil war specific lists.[/*]\r<br />[*]The Nord Hero Bows, do not exist in any vanilla level lists. Adding them to them will be too annoying and not &#34;Lore Friendly&#34; so I&#39;m not doing it :P[/*]\r<br />[*]In SkyRe version, Longbow is only added in Longbow version. For obvious reasons.[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][font=Verdana][i][color=#ff0000][size=2]Individual results [u]WILL MOST DEFINITELY VARY&#33;&#33;&#33;[/u]\r<br />Once you make a bashed patch (Required) you will hae level lists created\r<br />-FOR YOUR CURRENT MOD LIST-\r<br />This means that some people will see lots of bows, other will not see that many.\r<br />It all depends on what other mods your running.[/size][/color][/i][u][i]\r<br />[/i][/u][/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Georgia][color=#6aa84f][size=3][b][u]Installation[/u][/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[color=Orangered]1-[/color] Install however you want.

Falmer are blind and hunt by sound. I am considering it a third party alteration. <br/> \n Bows added at top level of vanilla versions in the lists. Only 1 bow of each type added to the lists. Hopefully this will keep the rarity level high. <br/> \n Civil war level lists have been ignored. I figure, its a war&#33; There&#39;s a shortage of stuff and things. <br/> \n In SkyRe version, Longbow is only added in Longbow version. For obvious reasons. <br/> \n",
