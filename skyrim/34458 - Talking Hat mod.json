  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a talking hat to the game, which will randomly cry out house names from Harry Potter and talk about whatever is on its mind. You can find the hat near the southern entrance of Riverwood (see picture). The hat is clothing and doesn\\'t provide armor but can be enchanted just like any hat.\r\n\r\nThis mod was originally made using Zab\\'s Witch Hat mod, which corresponds much better. You can download the Zab\\'s Witch Hat version on Steam Workshop:\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=135998193\r\nThis version of the mod uses a fine hat model instead. It is not compatible with the one linked above.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Bobshadow for this wonderful idea, the voice-overs and participation in the making of the hat\\'s personality.",
