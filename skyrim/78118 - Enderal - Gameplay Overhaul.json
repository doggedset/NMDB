Added new silver weapons, silver arrows\n<br />Ghosts have drastically increased resistances. Bypass it with silver weapons or with a new consumable called \"Ghost Curse\"\n<br />More diversity between creatures.

Some spells were just much better than others of the same rank.\n<br />Psionic is better and with the new spells added its a viable skill[/color]\n<br />\n<br />Alchemy is much more useful\n<br />Stealth/Pickpocketing/Lockpicking rebalanced and overall made harder\n<br />Loot is much more diverse.
