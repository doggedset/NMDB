Take note that the rename-pair lists are numbered for the sake of being intuitive; you apply 01 first, 02 second, 03 third, etc.\r<br />[*]At the bottom right corner of the window, click &#34;Rename&#34;.\r<br />[*]Proceed past the caution message, that comes up for everybody.\r<br />[*]Wait for the files to be processed\r<br />[*]Once done, repeat steps 11-14 until all of the rename pair lists have been used.\r<br />[*]Exit Bulk Rename Utility.\r<br />[/list][center]\r<br />Tadah. Now the dialogue files make sense.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][i][b]Nonsensical ramblings:[/b][/i][/center]\r<br />For those curious how I managed to compile these rename-pair lists, I modified the default TES5Edit script &#34;Export dialogues.pas&#34; to only output the dialogue filename and the actual dialogue text. I then loaded the generated text file into Excel to remove any redundant columns, exported the result as a new text file, then used Notepad++ to replace characters such as &#34;...&#34; &#34;:&#34; &#34;;&#34; &#34;/&#34; &#34;&lt;&#34;, etc.\r<br />\r<br />I had to repeat this process eight times, until the DLC and unofficial patches were covered.\r<br />\r<br />For the last file, 10DialogueMisc.txt, I had to manually transcribe all the dialogue files which were missed by the Tes5Edit script. This was a major pain in the ass; took me five or six days of work. And yes, transcribing is a hellish, boring and tedious endeavor. I don&#39;t like it one bit.\r<br />\r<br />So aye, this should make life a hell of a lot easier for modders that wish to add dialogue to custom NPCs; no longer do you have to listen to thousands ofÂ  decompiled .fuz files, just to find a single line of usable dialogue.",
