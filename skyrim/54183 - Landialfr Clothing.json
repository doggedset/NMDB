  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://www.editpolygon.com/images/landialfr-image-01.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />[b]Landialfr Clothing[/b] is a mod that introduces a set of lore friendly clothing of Elven and Nordic design for both male and female arcanists. The clothing is heavily inspired by the exploits of my Altmeri mage and his success as a Stormcloak soldier. In fact, the name Landialfr roughly means [i]Elven countryman[/i] in old Norse.\r<br />[line]\r<br />The set includes boots, robes, gloves, and a hood which can be found within the Halls of Attainment at the College of Winterhold. Upon entering the Halls travel to the first room on the right and the clothes will be inside a chest by the foot of the bed.\r<br />\r<br />The chest is set to respawn after ten days in case a second set of clothes is required for a companion or better enchantments. As with any other container that respawns refrain from using this chest as storage.\r<br />[line]\r<br />To install the mod simply extract the files into the Data folder in the Skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />As my first contribution to the Skyrim modding community I am open to helpful feedback and suggestions. Thank you for taking the time to read this description and I thoroughly hope you enjoy and appreciate the mod&#33;\r<br />",
