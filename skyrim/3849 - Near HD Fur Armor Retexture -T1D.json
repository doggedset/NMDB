  "descriptionHtml": "I found that the fur armor of the game was a bit bleak in contrast with many of the actual furry creatures of the game (especially with the addition of animal rexextures). So I decided to re-coat the fur and re-tan the leather. I was going to work on other clothing retextures as well but I\\'m afraid that the ability to work with, and severe lack of knowledge on the creation of alpha channels and normal maps is so crude, I would be embarrassed to even try. I hope you all enjoy, and you most likely will see more from me in the future.\r\n\r\n(NOTE!: This does not retex \\\"Fur Boots\\\", only \\\"Fur Shoes\\\" [the smaller shoe type]. Also, N_maps are not up to date, but are included.)\r\n\r\nFeel free to use the textures as you desire, but please give credit where credit is due.",
