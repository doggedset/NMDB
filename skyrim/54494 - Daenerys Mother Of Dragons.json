  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/54494-1-1402005960.jpg[/img]\r<br />[heading][b][size=4][color=#ffff00]Mother of Dragons[/color][/size][/b][/heading]\r<br />     Let me introduce you to my special follower, Daenerys.  She comes stand alone, packaged with her own body to add to the realism.  She is located in The Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun.  As she is dragon, she will take no fire damage and shout fire breathe.  Her extensive following has allowed her to learn many unique tongues and she will teach you this speechcraft if you have the coin.  \r<br />\r<br />     You know what else?  She isn&#39;t called &#34;Mother of Dragons&#34; for nothing.  She has her three teenage dragons Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion to back her up should she feel the need to shout for them.  They are much smaller then the dragons you normally face in Skyrim as they are yet to be full grown and so they are not quite as fast and don&#39;t do nearly as much damage.  You may rest easy though when you hear her call them to her side with her own unique shout [b][color=#ffff00]&#34;WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS&#33;?&#33;&#34;[/color][/b] as they can easily trap their target in a relentless triad of attacks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />     What about when she is indoors, she can&#39;t have dragons inside, right?  Yes she can&#33;  Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion come to her side in baby form to help take down anyone who opposes the mother of dragons.  Viable opponents, they will quickly warp out of your way if you run into them and stick mostly to walking in small areas.\r<br />\r<br />[center]Thanks to idanby for posting this video of the first release and letting me put on this page[img]http://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/wink.gif[/img][/center]\r<br />[center][youtube]V4zuE61NLtM[/youtube][/center]\r<br />[heading][b][size=4][color=#ffff00]Version Update History[/color][/size][/b][/heading]\r<br />[b]Version 2.1.0[/b][list]\r<br />[*]Missing relationship data on the dragons has been added back in.  Now they will immediately go into battle when shouted for.\r<br />[*]Teenage dragons combat AI tweaked and aggression adjusted for a better big battle experience. \r<br />[*]Teenage dragons should be perfect now.[/list]\r<br />[b]Version 2[/b][list]\r<br />\r<br />[*]A new fail-safe system has been set up on the dragons as well as easy to use customizations.  Check the &#34;How it works&#34; section for details.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Daenerys now has audible &#34;Where are my Dragons&#34; shout&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[*]All three dragons are summoned with a single shout now.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Daenerys now uses the Dragonborn&#39;s fire shout instead of the dragon&#39;s version.  It&#39;s more accurate and less noisy.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Daenerys is no longer as foolhardy, she will now sit back from enemies more often.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Daenerys will no longer attack you for committing crimes in Whiterun or for hitting her (unless you go overboard)\r<br />\r<br />[*]The dragons aren&#39;t as quick to turn on you for accidentally hitting them.  They are now set to the player&#39;s faction.\r<br />\r<br />[*]The teenage dragons are restricted to outdoor areas only.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Three new baby dragons have been added for indoor battles and are restricted to indoor areas.\r<br />\r<br />[*]AI on the teenage dragons has been completely reworked with great success in all my trials.  They should no longer be able to stray as far from Daenerys while summoned and weird after battle movements are extremely rare (if they happen at all, I have had NO issues during trials&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />[*]New &#34;Never Nude&#34; versions are completed.  They include either Linda armor or mage armor as mage armor is for anyone who wants to use another armor.  They will be available on a new &#34;family friendly edition&#34; that will be published separately (so the younger folks can have access) when this page is back up.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[heading][b][size=4][color=#ffff00]Bug Reports[/color][/size][/b][/heading]\r<br />[s]In the versions with dragons, Daenerys will shout for them indoors if you are battling.[/s]\r<br />[b][color=green]Problem has been solved by using baby dragons indoors in the version 2 update[img]http://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/thumbsup.gif[/img][/color][/b]\r<br />[heading][b][size=4][color=#ffff00]How it Works[/color][/size][/b][/heading]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][b]Installation[/b] - Pick your preferred package and either use nmm or you can manually install by unzipping the contents in you data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[*][b]Acquiring Daenerys[/b] - She will be in the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun waiting to join you.  Be warned, she will be nude for easily custimizing her armor so you may want to bring clothes[img]http://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/whistling.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[*][b]Speech Training[/b] - Ask Daenerys to teach you the tongues of her many followers.  She will teach you untill level 100, 5 levels for each time you level up for an increasing amount of gold.\r<br />\r<br />[*][b]Shouting for Dragons[/b] - Daenerys will shout for her dragons when in battle.  You don&#39;t need to do anything after you put the proper number of keys in you inventory.  Go into battle and you will hear her shout &#34;Where Are My Dragons?&#33;&#34; and her dragons will be summoned for 2 minutes.  After the 2 minutes the dragons disperse, and Daenerys will call them again if they are still needed.\r<br />\r<br />[*][b]Custimizable Dragon Shouts[/b] - Daenerys will have 100 dragon keys on her. These are the keys to her dragons and work as follows:\r<br />[list][*]Put only one key in your inventory, and Daenerys can shout for her dragons one at a time until she has three.\r<br />[*]Put two keys in your inventory, and Daenerys can shout for all three dragons at once.\r<br />[*]Drop the keys from your inventory, or give them back to Daenerys, and the dragons will disperse imediately and Daenerys will not be able to call them back to her side until you put the keys back into your inventory.\r<br />[*]Baby dragons and teenage dragons both work off these key counts[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[*][b]Updating to a different version[/b][list]\r<br />[*]Take anything from Daenerys that you gave her\r<br />[*]Drop any of her keys that you have\r<br />[*]Make a new save game\r<br />[*]Uninstall with your mod manager if aplicable\r<br />[*]Install updated version if you used the mod manager to uninstall.  If not, use the update and allow it to over-write the old files.\r<br />[*]All of the files included in this mod use there own folders and so nothing should be overriden that wasn&#39;t put there by another version of the mod.  The files are contained in meshesactorscharacterdaenerys, texturesactorscharacterdaenerys...the facegen files are in there respective folders in the folder motherofdragons.esp...the trainer script starts with dany in the script folder and the included source file (scriptsource) does as well.  The sounds folder has a folder named daenerys in fx and motherofdragons.esp in voice.[/list][/list]\r<br />[heading][b][size=4][color=#ffff00]Version Requirements and Notes[/color][/size][/b][/heading]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Dawnguard required for all versions&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[*]If you have already downloaded another version of this file an update may be available in the updates section.  Pick the package with the description including your previous version with version letter and overwrite with the update.\r<br />\r<br />[*]You only need one main or optional file, not both.\r<br />\r<br />[*]To use the TBBP versions of the mod you [u][b]NEED[/b][/u] a compatible skeleton and an animation pack to see the difference.  For the best effect, use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54044/]HDT Breast and Butt Physics[/url] by threedeedevil.  Make sure to follow his directions and get the skeleton he recommends, HTD Physics Extension, and SKSE.\r<br />\r<br />[*]The no body included versions will use your default body and textures.  This includes face textures so there are no seam issues but this also means that Daenerys will more than likely look much different than intended with these versions.\r<br />\r<br />[*]To keep the proper body shape with armors if you are using any of the &#34;Dream Girl&#34; versions you are going to need to find &#34;Dream Girl&#34; armors.  There are a [u]LOT[/u] of conversions on Nexus, just search &#34;Dream Girl&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />[*]If you are using a version with dragons, they will likely show some of the same issues as Vanilla dragons.  They have been well tested and as of version 2 they are great&#33;  I would use them over Durnehviir any day of the week.  If for some reason you are still experiencing issues with the new version, post a message.  There is always the version without the dragons, but that is just boring[img]http://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/sleep.gif[/img] and now there is the dragon key fail-safe system.  I put a lot of time in to make the dragons run as smooth as possible.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Dragonborn is required for any version with baby dragons.  They work flawlessly everytime for me so if you have Dragonborn, there need not be any concerns.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[heading][b][size=4][color=#ffff00]Credits[/color][/size][/b][/heading]\r<br />[center][I][color=green]Many of the aspects of this mod were made by some of the most talented members of the Nexus community and if you enjoy this mod then you&#39;ll love their&#39;s.
