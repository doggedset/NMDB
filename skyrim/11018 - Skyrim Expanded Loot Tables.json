  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/11018-1-1330059216.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nUpdate: Added 50 new rare Dragon Word Weapons to the loots lists!\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this mod feel free to endorse it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod essentially allows you to find almost anything, anywhere, at any level. I\\'ve modified the contents of all the containers in game to allow for the chance, however rare sometimes, to find almost anything. The new lists I\\'ve added are not leveled and drop chances are based on the rarity of the items. \r\n\r\nIf you\\'re anything like me you got bored of always finding essentially the same loot everywhere. I stopped looking in barrels and urns and many other containers because i knew I\\'d never find anything. I wanted to bring back the feeling that I needed to search everything because i just might find something amazing. \r\n\r\nWe\\'ll now you have that chance. Satchel\\'s contain more ingredients, soul gems and other magic loot. Draugr corpses were basically empty and can now contain almost any item in game including rare chances for high end enchanted weapons. Boss chests will now be more rewarding. The list goes on. \r\n\r\nWARNING! You will find more loot with this mod! I do not apologize for that:)\r\n\r\n\r\nDrop Chances: \r\n\r\nJust to give you an idea of what to expect for drop chances I\\'ll use barrels and high end boss chests as two examples, and the probability of them dropping daedric weapons.\r\n\r\nBarrels-  0.05% chance of dropping daeadric weapons.\r\nHigh End Vampire Boss- 6.5 % chance of dropping daedric weapons. \r\n                        \r\nSo, good luck and happy looting everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nChange Log:\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n\r\n     Added Fifty new rare Dragon Word Weapons to the loot lists. \r\n     \r\n     I\\'ve merged thewingedloke\\'s Runed Nord Weapons into this mod for the textures and glow maps used on the weapons. \r\n\r\n     This is the first of three tiers of extremely rare Dragon Word Weapons I\\'ve added to the loot lists. They\\'ve been given multiple enchantments a bit stronger than what is possible with the vanilla crafting system. I\\'ve personally crafted weapons with two enchantments doing 150 damage each with the vanilla crafting system, so i pushed it a little beyond that. They are extremely rare drops and worth searching for. Good Luck!\r\n\r\n    \r\nVersion 1.0\r\n    Added an new version of the mod that reduces drop rates of special loot by about half from the original file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Plans: \r\n\r\nThis is the first release and I will continue to expand the mod in the future.\r\n\r\nI\\'m currently working on adding a variety of named Dragon Word weapons to the loot lists, with a low chance of dropping within the daedric loot lists. I\\'m planning on having 3 Tiers. First Tier having two Dragon words and two enchantments. Second Tier having three words and three enchantments. Third Tier having three words/enchantments and also a special power such as knock back chance. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any ideas I\\'d love to hear them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\n\r\nOnly mods that alter container contents will conflict.\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t touch any of the original leveled loot lists, so other mods that inject new weapons and armor into them are fully compatible. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks given to thewingedloke for giving me permission to use his glowing nord hero weapons in this mod!\r\n\r\nThanks to all modders who make my Elderscrolls experiences better all the time.\r\nTo Bethesda for creating incredible games.\r\n",
