  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]\r<br />[color=#cfe2f3]Special Edition Version[/color]:Â [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11418/?]Tamrielic Culture[/url][/size]\r<br />\r<br />(Note that the SE version is significantly different than this version)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Now Available on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=92363927\r<br />\r<br />If you have a version from the Nexus and you switch to Steam remove the JD at the end of the esp and bsa and the other two files from Steam. And that should just overwrite the old one.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version Seven Adds: Fixed a few typo&#39;s and effects errors, Added upgrades for weapons and nerfed a few overpowered items.\r<br />But on to the main additions V7 adds: All drinks as seen in &#34;The Fighter&#39;s Stronghold DLC for Oblivion&#34; Excluding Argonian Bloodwine due to Hearthfire adding it. These Include: Frostdew Blanc, Julianos Firebelly, Numbskin Mead, Stumble Foot&#39;s Reserve, Sparkling Honeydew, Colovian Battlecry.\r<br />Also added a large number of Lore Friendly Drinks, as well as Hist Sap and a cave filled with argonians and a Hist Tree. There is also a Tar Pit in the volcanic tundra See Images for locations, though the map markers are always visible from the start, you can&#39;t fast travel to the until you visit them. To find the Dwemer Ingot and Tuning Rod you&#39;ll need to pay a visit to Blackreach and find the Silent Ruins.\r<br />\r<br />Updated to V6: Adds many constructable weapons for some of the misc items to be utilized, as well as adding new drinks and poisons and a few ingredients such as : Chocolate wine, Bluemist Wine, Wolfsbane Extract, Jarrin Root Extract, Tar, Red Mountain Ash, Apple Juices (red and green), Crab Bait, Scarlet Rose Perfume, Fine Comberry Wine, Moonrush, Moonshadow, Moonburst, Glowshroom Mead, Greenmote, And Painted Troll Fat. And much more. Let me know If there are any issues so that I may fix them, feedback and suggestions appreciated.\r<br />Enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />Updated to V5: Adds Sload Soap Ingredient, Alinor Wine,Gin,Rum,Northpoint Wine,Goldbrand Champagne,Liquid Viper Poison.\r<br />\r<br />This Standalone adds Many Drinks from Morrowind and Oblivion and a few additional lore friendly ones as well, also adds a few books from Morrowind and a few new misc items. Separate from My version that had a house with it since some people just wanted the drinks.\r<br />A few shops and inns have had them added to a leveled list at a set percentage, in addition they can also be found in select locations that I felt were lore appropriate. If you are lazy on the other hand, then visit coc QAsmoke in the console and they will be on a table.
