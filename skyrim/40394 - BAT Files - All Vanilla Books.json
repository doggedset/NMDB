  "summary": "Bat files for all of vanilla Skyrim\\'s books, neatly organized.",
  "descriptionHtml": "These are just some bat files for most of the books in vanilla Skyrim. There are a few that include all books, but I organized these by subject (http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Books_by_Subject) so I can assign them to specific shelves (bookshelf for history, bookshelf for fiction and plays, bookshelf for religion, etc;). Each subject has its own bat file.\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t include the DLC because, for me, those books are far less tedious to hunt down. I probably included a couple of quest-related books, but they shouldn\\'t affect your save game in any way other than you\\'ll have a spare copy that you can throw away or sell. No harm done.\r\n\r\nFor quest trigger books, I included the following: Boethiah\\'s Proving, Lost Legends, and The Legend of Red Eagle. I did not include Sinderion\\'s Field Journal since you can only find it in one place.\r\n\r\nTo use these just drop the text file in your root skyrim directory (Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim), load up the game and enter into the console:\r\n\r\nbat FILENAME\r\n\r\nIt\\'\\'s not as incredible as SkyUI, but it should hopefully save some other collectors and lore-lovers some time.",
