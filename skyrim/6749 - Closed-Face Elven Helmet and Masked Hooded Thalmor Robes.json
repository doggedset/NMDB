  "descriptionHtml": "I always thought the Elven armor and Thalmor robes would look much more intimidating if they concealed your face. So I went and did just that. If I get enough requests for it, I\\'ll make seperate versions for both the Helmet and the Robes.\r\n\r\nAlso I highly recommend using Shodan44\\'s black and gold elven armor with this as it yields amazing results with this new helmet.
