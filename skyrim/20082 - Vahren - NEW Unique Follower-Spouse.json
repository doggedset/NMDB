  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p215/faeriexxdecay/vahrenheader1.png[/IMG][/center]\r\nVahren, an Altmer male, is thieving his way across Skyrim amidst the chaos of the recent civil war and wishes to accompany you, the Dragonborn, on grand adventures to obtain wealth and riches (and to carry all that loot of yours...).\r\n\r\nThis mod adds Vahren, a high elf thief with assassin-like fighting skills and an ebony blade who also comes with appropriate perks, ready to aid you in battle or become your spouse. Hopefully he doesn\\'t run off with the dowry. There are [color=#FFFF33]two versions[/color] of this unique follower.\r\n\r\n[center][color=#FFFF33][b]ONLY CHOOSE ONE OF THESE.[/b][/color][/center]\r\n[b]In version 1[/b], Vahren will come set with a default thieves outfit, meaning he will [color=#FFFF33]never be naked[/color] (but it\\'s the attractive sleeveless variant, so it\\'s not all bad!). You can give him any armor you choose, and he should switch to that armor, but if you remove all the armor from his inventory, he will default back to the thieves outfit.\r\n\r\n[b]In version 2[/b], Vahren will [color=#FFFF33]NOT[/color] have a default outfit and will thus probably be undressed the first time you see him. He comes with a set of thieves armor in his inventory, but you will need to access his inventory and remove/add from it to force him to equip something. This way, he will wear whatever you give him, but it is also possible to completely undress him for whatever reason. Unless you have body replacers installed, Vahren will just be in his underwear when you first meet. :)\r\n\r\nVahren New Follower Features:\r\nAvailable as a follower AND can be married.\r\nIncreased speed, set as essential, assassin with extra health and stamina.\r\nAppropriate sneak and 1-handed perks.\r\nShouldn\\'t trigger pressure plates!\r\nFind him at [color=#FFFF33]Dead Man\\'s Drink in Falkreath[/color].\r\nStarting level 10, max level possible 99.\r\n[color=#FFFF33][b]NOTE:[/b][/color] This new follower is scripted to return to the inn if you dismiss him. I find this a convenient option that helps make it less likely to lose your follower. He does not have his own home (that\\'s the inn!), so it is recommended to tell him to move in with you when you marry!\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF33][b]INSTALL[/b][/color]\r\nFor ease of use, download and install using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/modmanager]Nexus Mod Manager[/url].\r\nFor manual install, simply extract the contents of the archive into your Data folder.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6]BOSS[/url] is recommended for proper mod sorting!\r\n[color=#FFFF33][b]This mod is FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH UFO![/b] Simply load my plugin AFTER UFO.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF33]Vahren\\'s Look[/color]\r\nIf you want Vahren to look like the screenshots, please take a look at these wonderful mods!\r\nAlso keep in mind that Vahren should work with ANY texture replacers, these are just recommendations.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488]Better Males[/url] - Younger Geonox Faces Without Beard + FavoredSoul Meshes\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4141]High Res Face Maps for Men by Geonox[/url] - Original version of the amazing facial textures by Geonox, minus the other stuff from Better Males. I prefer the Younger Without Beard version from Better Males, but this is also fantastic and, of course, is the original!\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/498]High Quality Eyes Darker & Desaturated[/url] - I use the elf eyes from this mod. Amazing detail that retains the feel of vanilla.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589]Natural Eyes[/url] - If you do not like the vanilla elf eyes, this is another option. I personally use the human eyes from this mod; they are wonderful too.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4307]AOF Believable Hair[/url] - Retexture of the vanilla Skyrim hairs.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11371]83Willow\\'s Whiter Teeth[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4489]Weathered Warpaint and Improved Dirt[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/703]Beviers Black Thieves Guild Armors[/url] - Used in the battle images.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7163]Another Black Thieves Guild Armor[/url] - Used in the relaxed images; my new favorite!\r\n\r\nPlease also take a look at [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19748]SYNERGY ENB[/url], which is the ENB setting used for the screenshots. Absolutely incredible!\r\n\r\nThis mod is brought to you thanks to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4554]NPC Editor[/url]!\r\nVahren\\'s reduced face texture was optimized using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5755]DDSopt[/url].\r\n\r\n[center][color=#FFFF33][b]Your downloads, comments, endorsements, and screenshots mean so much! I welcome any constructive feedback you have as well.\r\nLet me know what I can improve or fix! Enjoy![/b][/color]\r\n[IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p215/faeriexxdecay/vahrenheader2.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n[center]---------------------------------[/center]\r\n[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19486][IMG]http://i129.photobucket.com/albums/p215/faeriexxdecay/anruinlink.png[/IMG][/url]\r\nPlease check out my other followers on [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1159455]my profile[/url]![/center]",
