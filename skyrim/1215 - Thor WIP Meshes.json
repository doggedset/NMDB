At least the textures are already availlable ?\r\n\r\nNext to do:\r\nReshape/edit to a realistic shape.\r\n\r\n================================\r\nPosted obj file. Mesh is scaled at 10x and rotated/positioned to suit my workflow..\r\nHands and feet are joined, and will require splitting up prior to import to skyrim\r\nHands UV will need to be split up from body/feet.",
