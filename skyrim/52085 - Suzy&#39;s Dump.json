  "descriptionHtml": "[center][SIZE=7][font=Times New Roman][color=#c00000]Suzy&#39;s Dump[/color][/font][/SIZE]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffc000]Everyone needs a house to just dump junk.  So I set out to build something simple. Â The house is found deserted with only wildlife and the wind as its companions.  Obviously years of neglect have ruined this once beautiful home.  Using the Broom in the kitchen, clean the house up, repair it and settle in. \r<br />NOTE:  Make sure to kill the wolf and obtain the key before you clean the house- otherwise you can&#39;t leave.  You can toggle the mess on/off by activating the broom again.\r<br />\r<br />This mod has been cleaned with the latest version of TES5Edit. \r<br />\r<br />[font=Impact][size=5][color=#c00000]Features[/color][/size][/font]\r<br />[line]\r<br />The following is included within the house.\r<br />9 Mannequins\r<br />Over 20 Chests\r<br />All Crafting furnishings\r<br />Space for over 6 Followers\r<br />Secret rooms\r<br />Bedroom\r<br />Small Kitchen\r<br />Automated Lighting and Lightswitches\r<br />Stables\r<br />A Dirty house that can be cleaned up\r<br />Lots more&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[font=Impact][size=5][color=#c00000]Planned Updates for the Future[/color][/size][/font]\r<br />[line]\r<br />In the future, I plan to finish overhauling the lighting to make it work with RLO (the current state of the experimental version isn&#39;t to my standard as of yet); Also I&#39;m thinking about adding a basement with more storage and teleporters to all 9 of the major holds.  I will probably add more Mannequins down there as well.  Suggestions for what else you&#39;d personally like to see in the mod are always welcome&#33;  I&#39;ll keep you posted on the status whenever I can- R/L is very time consuming atm.  ~Masa\r<br />\r<br />[font=Impact][size=5][color=#c00000]Current Known Issues[/color][/size][/font]\r<br />[line]\r<br />Using RLO (Realistic Lighting Overhaul) causes the house to appear completely dark unless the lightswitches are activated (after you clean the house).  I&#39;m working on fixing this issue and should have a solution to it in the very near future.  Also there seems to be a small glitch with an Orc named Yatul randomly appearing in the house if you sleep or wait for extended periods of time.  She is non aggressive and the bug appears to be caused by the Unofficial Skyrim Patch.  It has nothing to do with my mod and as far as I know, there is nothing that can be done to address it minus disabling the USP (which I&#39;d strongly advise against).  Leave her be and she should go away on her own.  A glitch with the navmesh at the stairs by the entrance to the house in the worldspace causes your followers to sometimes take a very long way around.  I&#39;m yet to get any of my fixes to work for this, but I won&#39;t give up until its solved.\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />Like my mod?
