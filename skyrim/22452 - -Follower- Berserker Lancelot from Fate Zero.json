  "descriptionHtml": "=Update=\r\nAdded \\\"For Someone\\'s Glory\\\" Noble Phanstasm for Berserker (Refer Images) \r\n-Credits to razien for tutorial-\r\n\r\n=Description=\r\nThis mod adds Berserker Lancelot from Fate/Zero as companion (marriageable, if preferred). He is good with any melee weapons and have all the perks for melee combat, regardless 1-handed or 2-handed (but focuses on 1-handed more as his Aroundight is one-handed). You can find him in Whiterun\\'s Dragonsreach 2nd floor (Near Saber\\'s throne, if you have my Saber mod).\r\nHis armor and Aroundight is also, like Saber\\'s, included but PURELY COSMETIC (unenchantable, untemperable  but still usable). You can get the original, quality (enchantable & temperable) version of the armor and weapon by mingyannuzhiming at his mod page (link will be provided in \\'Credits\\' section).\r\n(NOTE: This Berserker is rather \\'sane\\', since I planned to give him Draugr\\'s voice, but that way you couldn\\'t make him a follower. So I gave him MaleEventone voice...) =P\r\n\r\n=Requirements=\r\nNone, but please update your Skyrim to patch 1.689 and above\r\n\r\n=Installation=\r\nDrop files in Skyrim/Data directory\r\n\r\n=Highly Recommended Mods=\r\nMy home is your home: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18045\r\n(To set change his default location to somewhere else other than Dragonsreach, i.e Whiterun\\'s Bannered Mare so you won\\' have any trouble finding him after being dismissed)\r\nUltimate Follower Overhaul: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037\r\n(Use command \\\"You know...\\\" -> \\\"You could dress better\\\" if you want to remove his armor and helmet).\r\nMagical Markers: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17483\r\n(Give this to him before dismissing him to know he is after being dismissed)\r\n\r\n=Bugs=\r\nShould be none but may be possible with any mods that alters Dragonsreach interior.\r\nOn rare occasions, He might not appear where he supposed to be on first encounter. To fix this, simply save your game, quit game, and restart your game and load the save. \r\n\r\n=Future Plans=\r\nWorking Knight\\'s Honor Noble Phantasm on him\r\n\r\n=Credits=\r\nmingyannuzhiming for Berserker\\'s Armor and Aroundight (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15522)\r\n\r\n=My Other Works=\r\n-Follower- Saber from Fate/Stay Night: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21650\r\n-Follower- Sylmeria of the StormCloaks: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20412\r\n-Follower- Vampire Eileen: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20521\r\nDark Brotherhood\\'s Babette Replacer: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20460\r\n",
