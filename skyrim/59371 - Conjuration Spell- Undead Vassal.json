  "summary": "Adds a spell that can reanimate almost any creature to help you for an hour.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Verdana][size=2]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />With this small mod I added a book that teaches you the master level spell Undead Vassal, that can reanimate almost any creature for an hour (real time).\r<br />I also made a small modification to the Dead Thrall spell to uncap its magnitude. By the time you have access to that spell you are supposed to be a Master in the school of Conjuration, so I thought you should be able to reanimate powerful creatures. Now you can raise them to aid you in battle.\r<br />\r<br />The book is located in a barrel just outside Riverw... sorry :)\r<br />\r<br />Inside a strongbox in the Deep Folk Crossing area, but be prepared for a tough battle, as it is guarded by a congregation of warlocks commanded by the wise Master Gemma, who carries the key.\r<br />\r<br />The mod is very simple and don&#39;t require or use any scripts, so I think is very safe to use, although it may conflict with any mod that alters the Dead Thrall spell.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Just unzip the file UndeadVassalSpell.esp and drop it inside your Data folder, then activate it through the Data Files menu.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod; I would have liked to add a quest to obtain it but I&#39;m still learning to use the CK. I hope you like it.[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />All credits to Bethesda for creating such a great game and giving us the tools to create new content.",
