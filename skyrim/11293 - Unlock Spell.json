  "summary": "Adds a spell to the game to unlock locked items based on skills other than lockpicking.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a spell to the game to unlock locked items based on Alteration, Destruction, 1 Hand, 2 Hand and/or Marksman skills. Lockpicking works as well, obviously.\r\n\r\nNote: as opposed to Midas\\' Transmute Lock, this doesn\\'t require that you click the lock to unlock it. You aim the spell at the lock from afar and open it like that. An instant targeted spell is not possible at the moment I think, due to how CK works, this is the closes I could get to the old Morrowind Unhinge Lock spell.\r\n\r\n1. Way to obtain - find and read book \\\"Unhinging Mind\\\", either by buying from Farengar (court wizard in Whiterun) or found in the bottom right part of the desk of the librarian from the Mage\\'s College. The book contains some lore-friendly way to introduce the spell.\r\n\r\n2. What it does: it unlocks locked items close to the point of impact of the spell. If unlock succeeds you should hear a lock open sound, if it fails you should hear a lockpick breaking sound.\r\n\r\n3. How it determines if a lock will open or not\r\nIt looks at the highest skill the player has from among this list (alteration, destruction, 1 hand, 2 hand, marksman, lockpicking) and compares that against the level of the lock (25 = novice, 50 = adept, 75 = expert, 100 = master). If it\\'s higher the spell will open the lock, otherwise it won\\'t. The \\'needs key\\' doors/locks will never open with this spell even if your skills are higher than 100.",
