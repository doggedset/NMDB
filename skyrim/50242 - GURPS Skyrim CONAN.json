  "summary": "A ruleset to convert GURPS characters into Skyrim player characters combined with pre-generated player characters.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The purpose of this Mod is the easy porting of characters from the GURPS pen & paper Role playing game from Steve Jackson Games to Skyrim. In a nutshell: You can play your own RPG character in Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />To give you some examples I  have included Conan from GURPS:Conan in several stages of development (17,22,27,32,42 years of age). \r<br />\r<br />This Mod is no usual mod with an ESP but instead comes in a BAT form that has to be started manually via the console. Just type BAT Conan17 to load the data of Conan at the Age of 17. \r<br />\r<br />The BAT file contains only advskill (Skills), addperk (Advantages), addspell (Advantages) commands, so there can be no conflicts with any other Mods. If anything goes wrong, just reload your last Savegame. \r<br />\r<br />The difference to just setting the skill to a specific value is, that with advskill, the game will also level your character as if you had really played through all these skills. You will receive all the health/stamina/magicka advances and of course, the perk points to distribute.  \r<br />\r<br />The files should be used just after character creation, else the skills and perks will be added to the skills and perks already accumulated.\r<br />\r<br />Recommend Mods: You get the best experience out of this Mod if use an Alternate start mod like  Live another life, Random Alternate Start or Skyrim Unbound. \r<br />\r<br />I also recommend strongly to use Requiem when you start a new game. It is the ultimate Conversion Mod.\r<br />\r<br />How it works:\r<br />\r<br />Just download the Conan.zip and unpack it into your Skyrim Main directory (thats the directory where the TESV.exe is located).\r<br />\r<br />Start a NEW game and type ^ for console \r<br />\r<br />Type: Conan17 and ENTER \r<br />\r<br />The game will load the skills and perks of Conan at the age of 17 (or Conan22, Conan 27 etc. etc.). \r<br />\r<br />Now you only have to level up and distrbute the perk points.\r<br />\r<br />Have fun&#33;\r<br />",
