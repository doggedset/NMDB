This mod is made to be used with 'The Joy of Perspective' Mod.\r\n\r\nIt is handled by replacing the 1st person meshes with the third\r\n\r\nThis took me only a few minutes but, I figured others would also enjoy a quick and easy download. Whether they are unaware of how to go about the conversion or if they're simply lazy (Like I wanted to be, but there was no compatibility patch)\r\n",
