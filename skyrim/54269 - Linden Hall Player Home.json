  "summary": "A functional but WIP player home in need of community suggestions.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Linden Hall is a home on the edge of Whiterun, built into the wall toward the south-east corner of the city.  The door is locked, and nobody has the key.  If you want the house yourself, you&#39;ll have to follow a trail of clues to find the key.  No quest, no markers, just you and your wits.\r<br />\r<br />Linden Hall is my own attempt at making a home that suits my purposes.  It has developed significantly since it&#39;s release, thanks to the contributions of other Nexus members (credit at the bottom of the description).  It has reached a stage of being both functional, having all crafting stations and integrating General Stores, as well as looking like someone lives there.  I hope it proves enjoyable, and welcome suggestions or requests to further develop it.\r<br />\r<br />The house currently consists of the entry room, a living floor with a kitchen, library, and master bedroom, and a basement with a crafting room, Hearthfire-grade garden, armory, and follwer quarters.\r<br />\r<br />The mod requires Skyrim and all 3 DLC&#39;s.  It is fully navmeshed to accommodate followers.  As of v1.3, it also requires General Stores here:\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18340/?\r<br />\r<br />Changelog:\r<br />v1.3: Large update.  Most chests have been removed and replaced with General Stores integration.  Added library, armory, and follower quarters.\r<br />*Updating from any -&gt; 1.3: Remove all your items from the house.  Exit the house and save.  Then uninstall previous version.  Load the game and save again.  Now install v1.3, load your game, and continue from your most recent save.\r<br />\r<br />v1.2:  Updated.  No chests have been removed.  Refined floor structuring and moved the bedroom into the main floor cell.  Added and moved some clutter.\r<br />*Updating from 1.1 -&gt; 1.2: Remove all your items from the house.  Exit the house and save.  Then uninstall v1.1.  Load the game and save again.  Now install v1.2, load your game, and continue from your most recent save.\r<br />\r<br />v1.1:  Updated.  Two chests removed from basement.  Crafting area compressed.  Initial garden area added (uses Hearthfire plantable soil).  Exterior appearance of house changed.\r<br />*Updating from 1.0 -&gt; 1.1: Remove items from basement chests and exit house before overwriting with new .esp.\r<br />\r<br />v1.0:  Initial upload.  House contains entry room, kitchen, basement (crafting stations) and master bedroom.\r<br />\r<br />WIP goals:\r<br />None at the moment.\r<br />\r<br />General Stores integration starting in v1.3\r<br />\r<br />Other stuff:\r<br />As for screenshots, I use RealVision ENB.\r<br />\r<br />Thank you to these people for advice that has been helpful:\r<br />Herrmannesque, who deserves extra recognition for his numerous suggestions and ideas.\r<br />dresden69\r<br />begothprincess",
