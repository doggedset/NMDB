  "summary": "Weapons from Alice:Madness Returns because I couldn\\'t find any except the Vorpal Blade, and it looked kinda boring. Now you can murder your foes with the famous mad heroine\\'s own weaponry (and then some).\r\n\r\n-Currently only All Melee weapons (Now Balanced!)\r\n-Emphasis on blood and overall enjoyment in slaughter (This has been well tested)\r\n-More ",
  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac343/fjarri/eyesofhearts.jpg[/IMG]\r\nComing Soon- Alice Eyes\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=15][b]PLEASE INFORM ME OF ANY ERRORS AS MY TESTING WAS NOT IN VANILLA [/size][/color]\r\n\r\nAlso Please read! \r\n\r\nV1.03 is out! Better Forge Recipes! [u] A new Dagger! And it\\'s in the world ! You can find it in Whiterun. (please tell me if you can\\'t)[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n>>The Blood maps cover the entire weapon, so the weapon can, and will be covered in blood in quite a messy looking manner<<\r\n\r\n>>ALL ITEMS CAN BE CRAFTED! Don\\'t say they can\\'t, because I checked multiple times.\r\n\r\n>>>>>>>>>Currently the Hobby Horse Models and Vorpals, Scepter,dagger, and Scythe, More may be added later, but I am as of the moment working on clothes and other items.\r\n\r\n>>>>Will eventually be integrated into world in a special manner.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues and information regarding them\r\n[b]-Textures aren\\'t appearing\r\n-Problems with forging- (fixed)\r\n-May have havok problems\r\n-May contribute to a crash in v1.5 Skyrim[/b]\r\n-I can\\'t find the weapons [u](Reading is fun)[/u]\r\n-Textures look sorta grainy (Blame the Unreal Engine and it\\'s textures)\r\n-The weapon is so big (Too Bad)\r\n-The Weapon is ugly (It\\'s a killing machine, from a game about insanity, it doesn\\'t have to be pretty)\r\n-The shadows/lighting may appear backwards/reversed (I have seen this and I\\'m sure I have corrected it)\r\n-The weapon goes into my character (The weapon was designed to a different standard and position than in this game, as well as a totally different character model)\r\n[b]-The weapon is OP (fixed)[/b]\r\n-The recipe is retarded (We are all mad here)\r\n-Blood gets all over the weapon (that is by design)\r\n-Blood looks somewhat pixelated (get new blood textures and that\\'s because I am stretching the blood textures over the entire weapon)\r\n-Hysteria\\'s hair looks stupid (I\\'m looking into fixing that, but it\\'s pretty much a problem with my meshes and how Skyrim/nifscape runs textures and stuff)\r\n-Hysteria looks kinda weird in light (That is by design, but only tested in Realistic lighting; it is supposed to simulate the blood effect, but may look strange)\r\n-The range of the weapon seems off (Didn\\'t really look into that, it should be pretty close)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are weapons from the game Alice: Madness Returns, an awesome, twisted, and very bloody game. These weapons are IP of Spicy Horse, so don\\'t go breaking laws :P\r\n\r\nI put these models into the game because I couldn\\'t find them wherever I looked, so I decided to make the effort of doing so, with massive frustration and lot\\'s of surfing, worthless tutorial,etc. etc. So yes, this is my first mod, and is very cheap. I know.\r\n\r\n\r\nHobby Horse models courtesy of ooCroftyoo for XNAlara, and by default, Max and Blender as well as the main textures. Normal maps were fiddled with, as well as that other one, whatever that is.\r\n\r\nVorpal models ,Scepter model, and Scythe model courtesy of ooDemonBoyoo for XNAlara, and by default, Max and Blender as well as the main textures. Normal maps were fiddled with, as well as that other one, whatever that is.\r\n\r\nThe 6 original Hobby Horse weapons can be crafted (Daedric)and have no enchantments on them (The recipes are a bit odd), while my random weapon has Molag Bal enchant on it and can only be gained through console commands (and lets face it, you where going to get the others the same way). They are not anywhere in the game, and to my knowledge, not sold by any vendor.\r\n\r\nThe Vorpals are the normal ingame model, the Hysteria version, the DLC cleaver, and 2 initial concept blades, along with an experiment that can only be gained through console commands. All models except for the Cleaver are currently Sword and daggers, unfortunately meaning thee are 2 items with the same name. [b]The way to distinguish them is how they are sheathed, the daggers are 13 gold, the sword weighs more.[/b] Also, the crafting recipes are different. They are not anywhere in the game, and to my knowledge, not sold by any vendor.\r\n\r\nThe 3 extra weapons are the Queen of Heart\\'s scepter, the Executioner\\'s scythe, and a bad-ass re-texture of the scythe.\r\n\r\nTo those that don\\'t know how. Press` and type \\\"help [word in weapon name] and use the PageUp and PageDown Keys to find the correct value and then type player.additem [number value] [amount] and it is then added to you inventory.\r\n\r\nThe weapons have different Damage values, following the hierarchy in the game, with the DLC version being just under the Hysteria-mode version. Weapon names are all me, they might have official names, but I don\\'t know em; if you know what they are or have good ideas, I\\'m up for sugestions.\r\n\r\nHYSTERIA MODE IS NOT IN THIS MOD (I\\'ll work on that a little bit later, after I figure out how the heck they did it)\r\n\r\nCurrently contains\r\n-Hobby Horse (Tier1)\r\n-Painted Rose (Tier2)\r\n-Ashes (Tier3)\r\n-Pale Horse (Tier4, No I did not choose White Knight)\r\n-Nightmare(DLC)\r\n-Hysteria(Hysteria-Mode, Really cool blood effect but the hair messed up because of Blender)\r\n-Graphic Nightmare(Just a random texture mix up that interesting to look at)\r\n\r\n(ALL VORPALS EXCEPT THE CLEAVER HAVE 2 MODELS!)\r\n-Vorpal Blade\r\n-Vorpal Edge(Hysteria, yes I did mean to add that reference)\r\n-Vorpal Knife (original model before release)\r\n-Lost Vorpal Knife (Variant of original model)\r\n-Vorpal Cleaver(DLC, My favorite :P)\r\n-Keen(Might be op)\r\n\r\n-Scepter of Hearts (the Queen\\'s scepter)\r\n-Last UnBirthday (Executioner\\'s scythe, it is very big)\r\n-The Last Train (scythe retexture)\r\n\r\n-and a cool looking dagger that shall not be named because you can find it in Whiterun.\r\n\r\nPlease give me feed back and sugestions, and if you can, pointers :P\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks LeckerHamster for your awesome tutorial, that made more sense then the straight english tutorials. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hYHj2Dy49s&feature=related",
