But she won’t digress where. Her family were killed several years ago, and the murderer behind their deaths remains a mystery. The surviving members of the Vrijyn family consist of Yana, Bera and Sonja herself. Sonja’s nord half-siblings never accepted her as their true sister and despised her from the very moment of her birth. Rumor has it that Bera and Yana has returned to their homeland of Skyrim to find solace with their elder siblings. \r\n\r\nSonja sold the farm that she inherited from her mother and bought a passage to Skyrim in search of her half-siblings. Why Bera and Yana fled after the massacre of five of their kin is unknown. Will you accept her as your partner and unravel the mysteries surrounding her past? Or will you encounter her siblings and search for the answers yourself?\r\nThe choice will be yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1277.photobucket.com/albums/y485/Amorphis87/SC%20-%20Sections/CombatStats_zps1d72812d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n - +20% Attack with Two-Handed Greatswords.\r\n - +20% To block.\r\n - Sneak perks such as: Silence & Lightfoot.\r\n - +40% sneak; for those who want a cautious follower!\r\n - Level up to 100.\r\n - Light Armor is a bonus! Equip her with some for a better Barbarian Class!\r\n - Efficient (yet balanced) archer for those nasty dragon fights, but don\\'t expect her to take down legions of dragons in a single fight with a bow.\r\n - She can die! Be sure to help her out! (or you can let her die and [~] resurrect).\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Information:\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n - [ ] Essential?\r\n - [x] Protected? -[She will die if you attack her while she is in her defeated pose].\r\n - [x] Marriable?\r\n - [ ] Companion Sidequests? -[A full story with a quest line will be in future patches.

Sonja will use Custom CBBE meshes and textures.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#61B329]Q: Do I require anything to use this?[/color]\r\n[color=#CDBE70]A: No, you don\\'t. I have included a Barkeeper and a Scale Armor mesh for her body type. If you give her armor/clothing that has been changed to fit a body other than CBBE, you may get clipping.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#61B329]Q: Will you upload [Insert other body mod here] version?[/color]\r\n[color=#CDBE70]A: Probably not, since she uses a stand-alone mesh.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#61B329]Q: Do you have any other companion mods?[/color]\r\n[color=#CDBE70]A: No. This is my first mod, ever. I will be adding another companion at a later date.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#61B329]Q: What ENB/Lighting Mods do you use?[/color]\r\n[color=#CDBE70]A: I only use [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043]Enhanced Lights and FX [/url] by anamorfus, not ENB. My settings are on max with texture packs.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#61B329]Q: Why doesn\\'t she have the Redguard skin-colour?[/color]\r\n[color=#CDBE70]A: See Sonja\\'s history. LOREWISE, she is Half-Redguard, Half-Nord. I figured a mixure would be perfect (And it suited the red-hair, too).[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#61B329]Q: What hair does she use?[/color]\r\n[color=#CDBE70]A: Apachii has kindly granted me the use of her ApachiiSkyHairFemale v1.3 Hairs. I used one of those for Sonja\\'s hair and customised the texture location so it wouldn\\'t interfere or override the ApachiiHair.esm/ApachiiHairFemale.esm files. [/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#61B329]Q: Will you add more variety of hair and colours?[/color]\r\n[color=#CDBE70]A: I may add a brunette or possibly a blonde version in the future, depending on what will suit her visually & lore-wise.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#61B329]Q: Can you make her Essential?[/color]\r\n[color=#CDBE70]A: I might depending on the quests that will be implemented in the future.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#61B329]Q: Sonja\\'s armor and clothing look different on mine, why?[/color]\r\n[color=#CDBE70]A: Sonja\\'s gear only uses custom-made meshes, not the textures. If you want the same texture as mine, check out the \\'Recommended Mods\\' section.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#61B329]Q: Why can\\'t I strip her naked?[/color]\r\n[color=#CDBE70]A: It is a mechanic in the Creation Kit. You can use UFO and tell them to \\'dress better\\', which will allow you to trade the items she carries - stripping her naked in the process.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#61B329]Q: How can I go straight to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun to check her out at the beginning of the game?[/color]\r\n[color=#CDBE70]A: Open the Console [~] and type: coc whiterunbanneredmare, she wonders around near the entrance.[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1277.photobucket.com/albums/y485/Amorphis87/Sonja_Companion/MainBanner4_zps921e9631.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1277.photobucket.com/albums/y485/Amorphis87/SC%20-%20Sections/RecommendedMods_zpsb4e82de9.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nMy other mods:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33671]IGR - Iron Greatsword Replacer[/url]\r\n\r\nFollower Overhauls/Mods:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul by fLokii[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18045]My Home Is Your Home - a mod for followers by Volek[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14950]Convenient Horses by Alek[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11370]Spouses Can Live Everywhere by Amgepo and Emma[/url]\r\n\r\nSeen in the Screenshots:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20077]Tribunal robes and masks by Zairaam[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17746]DSpSoB - Dual Sheath plus Shields on Back by DarkPhoenix[/url] (With Swords on back addon).\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24909]aMidianBorn Book of Silence by CaBaL[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21572]Blood Witch Armor by Zerofrost Satyr[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13646]Thieves Guild Duelist Armor CBBEv3 by Echo 1162[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32554]CBBE Dragonborn Armors by Frigus[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33121]Opulent Maid Outfits v2 - Female Only by BaboonCru[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31229]Medusa Drakul armors and Thanatos dragon by Zerofrost/Satyr[/url]\r\n[url=]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12092]Cloaks of Skyrim by Noodle[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13486]Winter Is Coming by Nivea[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27008]Four Seasons Inn by whadafool[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33292]Unique Uniques by InsanitySorrow[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28978] Pretty Combat Idles by Dualsun[/url]\r\n\r\nWhen you get bored of Sonja, just suit her up in these:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25389]Sweet amd Sexy Lingerie Shop CBBE by Nikitaa[/url]       \r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11764]Push-up sexy bikinis CBBE v3 by Nikitaa[/url] \r\n\r\nAnimations used:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10870]Puppeteer Master by JohnB[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1277.photobucket.com/albums/y485/Amorphis87/SC%20-%20Sections/LoadOrder_zpsb7a63154.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------\r\nSkyrim.esm\r\nUpdate.esm\r\nDawnguard.esm\r\nHearthFires.esm\r\nDragonborn.esm\r\nApachiiHair.esm\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\r\n...\r\nAnruin - Faendal Replacer.esp\r\nBrothers.esp\r\nCompanionSonja.esp\r\nDSpSoB.esp\r\n------------------\r\n     END\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n - You can place the CompanionSonja.esp anywhere after the Skyrim.esm & Update.esm.\r\n - I am currently running over 240+ mods (not including texture packs) with wyre bash patched.esp.\r\n - It seems stable enough, but makes it difficult to test mods 100%.
