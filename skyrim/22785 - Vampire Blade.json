  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod so please be kind. This is basicly a re-named Deadric Sword with a slight stat boost. I was disappointed when Dawnguard didn\\'t have a vampire weapons set so im out to make some. I will do re-textures in the future to make the weapons unique, but until then it\\'ll just be deadric stuff.\r\n\r\nIt is in the deadric smithing option.\r\n\r\nNo smithing perk required.\r\n\r\nAbosorbs 25pts of health from the enemy.\r\n\r\nSmithing Recipe:\r\n10 Vampire Dust\r\n\r\n2 Ebony ingot\r\n\r\n1 Leather Strips.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain this is my first mod so don\\'t expect Chuck Norris.",
