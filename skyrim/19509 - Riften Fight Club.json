The left is for Surrept and the right is for Bashers.\r\n- Use the Fight Club Menu Spell that is givin to you when you enter the Fight Club to see your rank and other stats as well as upgrade your unarmed damage.The higher your rank the stronger your enemies will be\r\nEnjoy!\r\n(IMPORTANT) if you like this mod please endorse or leave a comment, I don\\'t get paid to do this and so endorsements and comments are all modders have to look forward to.\r\nConstructive feedback is welcome as this is my first mod and I\\'m open to suggestions\r\nThanks!\r\n==============\r\nCompatibility:\r\nSome mods aren\\'t compatible and cause issues like, not being able to choose team when you enter the Fight Club, and Fight Club Menu Spell not being added when  you enter the Fight Club. I don\\'t know in particular which mods cause this but if you experience this issue it would be helpful to find out which is conflicting and let me know so I can try to make a patch for it. If your too lazy to try and find out what\\'s conflicting then even sending me a list of mods you have is helpful, If I see the same mod in everyone\\'s list then I can determine that it\\'s causing a problem.\r\n\r\n==============\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nSo far the only issues are the surrept not giving you the option to fight(this means it will only work if you play bashers) and survival mode putting you inside the bashser\\'s barrack when you end it. If you find any other issues please report them so I can fix them in an update.\r\n==============\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n==============\r\nBefore posting any bugs please try these steps first to see if it fixes your problem:\r\nStep 1\r\n- load skyrim with the mod uninstalled( you don\\'t have to unsub just go to data files when you launch skyrim and uncheck it from the list)\r\nStep 2\r\n- Go to an exterior cell like whiterun or anywhere else that isn\\'t inside then save the game and exit( make sure the mod isn\\'t installed when doing this)\r\nStep 3\r\n- Load skyrim with the mod installed this time go to the save you just made( should be somewhere outside )\r\n\r\n=========\r\nFuture:\r\n=========\r\nIn the future I plan to add:\r\n- Quests\r\n- Voice Acting\r\n- Followers\r\n- Custom Armor\r\n- Custom Weapons\r\n- Possible Suggestions\r\n- More!\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\nChangelog:\r\n-------------------\r\n1.4a\r\n\r\n- Adds Dialogue(Voice Acting comming soon)\r\n- Added a new Npc(Atticus Plinius)\r\n- Changed Lighting\r\n- Some Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n==============\r\nCredits:\r\n==============\r\n- WillieSea for all of his help with scripting\r\n- OPGreenback for his help with testing and the backstory for the Fight Club\r\n- Coril for his help with testing\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nRe-Use\r\n\r\nYou cannot re-upload this mod to any other site without my permission, you are free to use anything in the mod as long as you give me credit.",
