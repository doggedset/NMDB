  "descriptionHtml": "What it says on the tin. This is a Vyrthur follower from the Dawnguard DLC. He now comes in 2 flavors, Mortal AND Vampire. Obviously this isn't really lore friendly and I mostly made it for myself for a particular save and screenshot purposes. However, as far as I know, this hasn't been done before. \n<br />\n<br />Vyrthur is a carbon copy of his original counterpart from the DLC, save for some tweaking; removing vampire powers, changed eyes (for the mortal version), and adjusted tint masks to make it look like he didn't just get punched. In addition to this, I added the ivory crown to his outfit set, meaning the original Vyrthur will have it too. I also adjusted his eye shape, to make the weird cockeyed-ness that is inherent with the high elf race less offensive. \n<br />\n<br />[b]ALSO; HE DOES NOT USE HIS ORIGINAL VOICE, OR LINES THAT COME WITH IT.[/b] Because Vyrthur is a boss character, and is essentially ONLY HOSTILE, a lot of his vanilla lines were unfitting to be edited into follower dialogue. HOWEVER, his voice actor (Stephen Russell) also did the voice for Mercer Frey/Belethor AKA MaleSlyCynical. But, that voice lacks follower dialogue, so [b]in order to recruit Vyrthur as a follower you will need [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74568]Relationship Dialogue Overhaul[/url]. \n<br />\n<br />[/b]PLEASE INSTALL ONLY ONE MAIN FILE. UNLESS YOU WANT TWO VYRTHURS? \n<br />\n<br />You can find him in the Four Shields Tavern, in Dragon Bridge. \n<br />\n<br />Plans for future versions;\n<br />-Make him stand alone, incorporate some of his vanilla dialogue, such as combat sounds and taunts. \n<br />[s]-I may make a vampire version if people want it[/s]  DONE!\n<br />- I'm probably not going to port this to SSE, if you want to, go for it and let me know and I'll link it here.",
