The casting system has been redone and there are boss encounters. Please visit my profile page to see my other mods.[/b][/color][/size][/i][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://oi45.tinypic.com/a407k.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />[font=calibri][size=4]Welcome to the beginning of a new form of magic. Witness its birth and attempt to wield its awesome power. Do so to triumph over your foes to bring peace or anarchy to the lands of Tamriel. Never has a magic form like this existed. The possibilites, the power that it  brings are limitless. Become a bastion of knowledge, a magical powerhouse, a figure of legends. I am very proud to present, through much work and pondering, Phenderix&#39;s Ultimate Magical System. (PUMS)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=orange][b]What is PUMS?[/b][/color][/size][size=4]\r<br />PUMS is a combination of some of the best concepts and ideals from popular culture and media. It is a vibrant system of magic that attempts to fulfill the desires of nearly every user.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=6][color=orange][b]What is this new spell system?[/b][/color][/size][size=4]\r<br />In this system you use elements to form unique spells. Depending on which elements you have equipped different spells will be cast. Which spell is cast also depends on the modifier you are using for that elemental combination. Almost all spells require a modifier active to be cast. Modifiers allow you to combine the elements to form powerful new spells. If you do not select a modifier a weak base element attack will be cast.\r<br />\r<br />Modifiers basically define what type of spell will be cast from your current elemental combination equipped. Currently there are four different modifiers: Bolt, Summoning, Shield, and Blast. The Bolt and Blast modifier focus on producing offensive elemental attacks based upon your equipped elements.  The summoning modifier allows the user to call upon unique creatures to assist them in battle. The creature called to battle will change depending on which elements you have selected. The shield modifier allows for the user to cast a variety of unique spells that are applied to the caster and effect their surroundings.\r<br />\r<br />Depending on which modifier you are using an entire different effect will occur when you try to combine two different elements. For every single modifier every single combination of two elements is covered and will cast a unique spell.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=6][color=orange][b]How does the new power system work?[/b][/color][/size][size=4]\r<br />This mod also uses a unique power system. Instead of just using Magicka the spells added by this mod drain your Magicka, Stamina, Health in that order. If you run out of Magicka the spells will attempt to drain your Stamina, and then afterwards your Health. This is a new system that adds a lot more depth to the game. This is based upon the ideas presented by the Eragon book series.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=6][color=orange][b]How does spell progression work?[/b][/color][/size][size=4]\r<br />All spells contained in this mod scale in one way or another. Bolt and blast spells increase in power every time you use them. After so many uses, which differ from spell to spell, that spell will increase in strength. \r<br />\r<br />Summons contained in this mod all scale in level with the player. \r<br />\r<br />All Shield spells have 3 different levels. Upon first use of the shield spell the first level shield will be cast, on the second use the 2nd level shield will be cast, and on the third consecutive use the 3rd level shield will be cast. Each level increases the effect the shield is using and increases the cost towards the caster.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://oi50.tinypic.com/r01szk.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://oi48.tinypic.com/59zxxt.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />[center][img]http://oi48.tinypic.com/jigill.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />[center][i][size=5][color=red][b]Not all shield spells are done.[/b][/color][/size][/i][/center]\r<br />[size=6][color=yellow][b]Bolt Modifier[/b][/color][/size][size=4]\r<br />Bolt spells are the weakest form of offensive magic contained within this mod. They are low cost low damage spells. They vary somewhat in these different areas and each are differentiated in terms of speed and range. Most bolt spells do 1 more damage per 5 successful uses. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=yellow][b]Blast Modifier[/b][/color][/size][size=4]\r<br />Blast spells are a more powerful form of offensive magic that cost a lot more but also do a lot more damage. Many of these spells do area damage so watch out where you cast them&#33; With these spells it is possible to raze an entire area. Most blast spells do 1 more damage per 2 successful uses. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=yellow][b]Summon Modifier[/b][/color][/size][size=4]\r<br />Were regular summons just not good enough for you? Well you are in luck then&#33; The summons contained in this mod add many more options for conjurers. All summons are creatures from the game but different in some way such as speed, size, or spells available. All summons scale in level in relation to the player.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=yellow][b]Shield Modifier[/b][/color][/size][size=4]\r<br />Shield spells are spells that are cast on the user. They do a variety of things and must really be tested out to fully understand their design and purpose. Many shield spells have not been completed yet and may be finished in a later update. Shield spells that have been completed have three different levels you can cast that increase the power of the shield. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=orange][b]How do I obtain these spells?[/b][/color][/size][size=4]\r<br />All tomes needed to use this mod are found in Dragonsreach, the capital building of Whiterun. Also found here is a secret amulet that you can imbue using just a (Earth/Earth) spell without any modifiers. The chest is in the room where Farengar usually is. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=orange][b]What is this new energy consumption system and how does it work?[/b][/color][/size][size=4]\r<br />Spells contained in this mod first attempt to drain magicka. Once the caster runs out of magicka it attempts to drain stamina. Once the caster runs out of stamina the spells attempt to draw power from any imbued objects you may have.  Once the imbued object no longer has any more energy the spells attempt to drain the caster&#39;s health. Once the caster has run out of health they are dead.\r<br />\r<br />In Dragonsreach there is an amulet that can be imbued. By imbuing an object you are storing power in it. You can only further imbue an object once per day and for the rest of that day you are severely weakened. To do this equip (Earth Hands/Earth Hands) and do no select a modifier. If you are wearing the amulet you will be able to imbue it once per day using that spell. By imbuing the amulet everyday you are gaining potential power you can use in a later more challenging fight later on.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://oi50.tinypic.com/r01szk.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://oi48.tinypic.com/ifpsie.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />[size=6][color=orange][b]How do I do this?[/b][/color][/size][size=4]\r<br />Installation for this mod is very easy to do.
