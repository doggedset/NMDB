  "summary": "Adds herds of wild horses into the landscape of Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "BASIC DESCRIPTION\r\nThis is a ModBox mod, produced by a ModBox member, who is affiliated with the ModBox group.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds roaming wild horses to Skyrim, in herds. \r\n\r\nThese horses are very protective, and will defend their patch. This provides an immersive natural experience to the player. \r\n\r\nIt is still in early beta, and will be updated regularly, notably, with extra new species and textures. Any constructive criticisms will be happily accepted, and dealt with in a later update. Report bugs in the comment section. Any decent photos you produce of this mod will be gratefully accepted.\r\n\r\nDETAILS.\r\n\r\nMany wild horses abandoned, or simply not tamed, by the Nords of Skyrim litter the landscape. Some of them are the common species, from the palomino mares and stallions, to simple gray and black horses indigenous to the lands of Skyrim, and even a few rarer breeds, like the Dappled Black or the GrayBack are scattered high and low. Of course, hunted as food by bears and wolves, these horses are on the brink of extinction, but in the hardy way of most of the inhabitants of Skyrim, they struggle on.\r\n\r\nMany characteristics of the wild horses are atypical. While, of course, the indigenous horses are prevalent, a few foreign breeds, mainly brought over by the Khajeet caravans (the dusty brownish types) and those that have wandered free still exist, dotted around, from place to place. Almost indistinguishable in build by now, they are able to survive, but those of true Nordic descent are still the superior horse.\r\n\r\nCURRENTLY, WE ARE LOOKING FOR TEXTURE ARTISTS AND 3D DESIGNERS. IF YOU\\'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES, MESSAGE US. WE\\'LL BACKLINK YOUR WORK ON THIS PAGE, IF YOU WISH.\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nGrim219 (Lore)\r\nxxzakthecoolxx (Lead developer)\r\nHUGE THANK YOU TO DHEGONUS FOR THE TEXTURES.\r\n\r\nV 1.3\r\n\r\nAdded four entirely new species of horse  \r\nImproved texture quality of new species  \r\nMade wild horses more afraid  \r\nHorses no longer run at you from range to try and kick you to death  \r\nRecorded positions of all horses  \r\n\r\nV 1.0\r\n\r\nAdded 25 new wild horse herds, equal to around 130 horses  \r\nCreated six new species with separate attributes  \r\nMade wild horses more aggressive than normal horses  ",
