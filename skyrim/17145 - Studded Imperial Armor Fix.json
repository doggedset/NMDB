  "summary": "Adjustment of the UV map on the medium Imperial armor set so that the correct textures are displayed.",
  "descriptionHtml": "When I was poking around in NIFSkope, I noticed that the light Imperial armor and studded Imperial armor share a texture, with the UV maps pointing to different parts of it (the chain on the shoulders vs. leather, etc.) The female studded Imperial armor had metal studs on the tassels that I thought looked pretty neat, but for some reason the male version lacked that. That was when I noticed that the UV map on the male version was simply pointing to the wrong part of the texture. So I fixed it.\r\n\r\nThis mod should be compatible with any texture replacer, though it will obviously conflict with body replacers or anything that changes these meshes.",
