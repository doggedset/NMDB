I wanted to make one that allowed you to fast travel from inside places that you would know your way out of. The point of fast travelling is that you&#39;ve been there before, so you know how to get there. So naturally, you&#39;ve been inside your house, you know how to get out of it. I didn&#39;t want to add all caves and dungeons because I didn&#39;t want it to be a cheat mod. I wanted to make it kind of like an ease of access thing that would make sense in the world. Like I said in the description, I got the idea from Oblivion, which allowed you to fast travel from inside (most) of your homes.",
