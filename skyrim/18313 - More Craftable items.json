  "descriptionHtml": "More Craftables:\r\n\r\nThis mod was created when I was playing a pure vanilla Skyrim and realized how annoying can be the unobtainability of some items by crafting and also by a comment of PlasmaJedi on one of my mods. \r\n\r\nThe first idea was to make Imperial Sword, Bow, Studded and Light Armor craftable. Then I added Wolf Armour and Dragon Priest Dagger craftable after the Companions\\' questline. If there are any more uncraftable items, PM me or write it in the comments.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 Changelog\r\n-Fur Armor included (do you know that a fur helmet exists?)\r\n-Dragon Priest dagger recipe edited: Removed Leather Strips, the recipe is 2 Gold Ingots and 1 Iron\r\n\r\nCurrently craftable:\r\nImperial Sword and Bow\r\nImperial Light Armour and Studded Imperial Armor\r\nStormcloak Cuirass\r\nWolf Armour (after completing the Companions\\' questline)\r\nDragon Priest Dagger (After completing the Companions\\' questline)\r\nHunting Bow\r\nImperial Shields (both Light and Heavy)\r\nFur Armor set\r\n\r\nPlanned features:\r\nWolf Armor Set craftable after joining the Companions\r\nHarbinger\\'s Armour (Better Wolf Armour)\r\nImperialSmithing and StormcloakSmithing perks, that allow you to craft Imperial and Stormcloak items only after joining them (optional file)\r\nEven More Craftables\r\nTanning Leather, Hide and Fur Armor\r\nMaking an esm file\r\nBronze Ingot\r\nDragon Priest Staff (gold and black version)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
