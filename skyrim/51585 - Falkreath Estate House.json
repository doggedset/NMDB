Any and all feedback will be greatly appreciated and I&#39;ll be sure to keep on adding improvement and suggestions to the house if people seem to like it. This mod does not require any DLC.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Description: \r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a small estate house north of Falkreath. There is no need to memorize the map, it is already discovered for you to travel to. There are no quests and there are as few load doors as I could do. There is a tavern, the outside of it is doubled as a blacksmith. The house next to that is your personal house. The stone tower across from your house has a basement referred to as a guard house. \r<br />\r<br />There are multiple guards around the estate. There are 4 followers. 2 are wizards, 2 are warriors. 2 are in the tavern, 1 is in the guard house, and last is on the estate grounds, by a fire pit. There are 3 vendors. There are 4 prisoners in the guard house. The key is on a nightstand where you enter the guard house. The guard house has an armory as well. Inside your house is the following: \r<br />\r<br />- Mask Display Bust \r<br />- 1 Bed \r<br />- 1 Alchemy Stand \r<br />- 1 Potions Stand \r<br />- 1 Cooking Pot \r<br />- 17 Weapon Plaques \r<br />- 8 Weapon Racks \r<br />- 12 Display Cases \r<br />- 6 mannequins \r<br />- Bookshelves \r<br />- Containers for all your gear \r<br />- Misc containers \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Improvements: \r<br />\r<br />Like I said, feedback would be great if you wish something to be added / changed / moved. I am new to modding but I will try my best to improve the home in anyway I can. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Mods I recommend: \r<br />\r<br />-http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=196709514 \r<br />It is a mod that allows you to move your family into any house even in a mod. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />My Other Mods:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51585/]Falkreath estate 1.4[/url] - Small estate in falkreath.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60719/]Whiterun castle[/url] - Medium castle near whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />For those of you that prefer the workshop my mods are also on there as well.
