  "summary": "This mod lets you buy perk points with dragon souls.",
  "descriptionHtml": "There have been mods that let you get perks with dragon souls, but they have either been limited in functionality (forcing you to choose a specifc perk instead of giving you a perk point that you can spend on anything) or required Script Dragon (a utility which people need to let go of). I decided it was time to make a mod without either drawback.\r<br />\r<br />At the Guardian Stones, you will find a new stone, the Dragonstone. Using it will allow you exchange a number of dragon souls (user-configurable, default 10) for a perk point. If you&#39;d like to change the price, simply open the console and type &#34;set ishperkcost to X&#34; sans quotes. Replace X with the number of souls you&#39;d like the price to be.\r<br />\r<br />If you are running SkyUI 3.0+, you will find a section of your Mod Config Menu for Ish&#39;s Souls to Perks that will allow you to change the cost of a perk point without requiring you to use the console.",
