  "descriptionHtml": "Ahoy,\r\n\r\nSimple mod made for personal use, all the mods on here seem to make werewolves bigger, but I am making a Breton Werewolf and even on my other characters I have felt a little awkward about the sheer size of werewolves. So after doing some testing on sizes, I changed the size of the werewolf to be right about on size for most of the races kinda bent over a little. Honestly I think it looks a lot better, especially the transformation as rather then the skin appearing way out, it is practically right against the skin.\r\n\r\nThis should be compatible with almost all mods with the exception of mods that increase the height of werewolves... which if you tried to mix the two it would be kind of silly wouldn\\'t it.\r\n\r\nNote: Made the mod separate from Dawnguard in 1.1",
