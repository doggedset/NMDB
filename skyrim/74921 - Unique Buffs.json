  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Arial][size=2]I dont know how or what Bethesda was thinking when creatingitems that are supposed to be of legend turning out to be absolutely useless.\r<br />Take Red Eagle&#39;s Bane for example. For such a fabled sword that the legendary hero once used, its pretty terrible. With the added effect of turning undead? Thats it? I dont know about you but fear effects is perhaps one of the most frustrating things you can deal with as they continually run away prolonging the fight. Thats just an example. So here are the changes. Keep in mind that majority of the changes are just enchantments. If you experience any bugs or\r<br />have a suggestion, please feel free to comment.[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=5] ==MACE OF MOLAG BAL==[/size]\r<br />Absorb 25 points of stamina\r<br />Deal 15 points of magicka damage\r<br />Soul Trap targets\r<br />A 15% chance to paralyze targets when they have low stamina\r<br />\r<br />Context: While I somewhat liked this item initially, it still felt lack luster.\r<br />I changed it where you now absorb stamina to keep that swinging arm swinging\r<br />and nerfed the magicka damage a bit in compensation of adding chance\r<br />paralyzation. Now they will have no choice but to get on their knees and\r<br />submit.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==RED EAGLE&#39;S BANE==[/size]\r<br />Deals 10 points of fire damage\r<br />Absorb 5 points of health\r<br />Deals 35% more damage against Man. \r<br />(^Due tohow this works and for balance purposes, it will only be applied if its the\r<br />only weapon in your hand)\r<br />\r<br />Context: Reading stories after stories of Red Eagle, he sounds like an absolute\r<br />badass. I was highly dissappointed when I find out that the fight is just with\r<br />another Dragur and the blade is so lack luster on top of it. I buffed it up a\r<br />bit and added the increased damage to reflect his lore. Just like the nord&#39;s\r<br />equivalent of Wuuthrad.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5] ==OKIN AND EDUJ==[/size]\r<br />Okin deals 10 frost damage \r<br />Eduj deals 10 shock damage\r<br />When wielding both, swing 30% faster.\r<br />\r<br />Context: Just like Red Eagle, Kvenel, is a legendary hero who dual wields a\r<br />sword and a war axe. And unlike Red Eagle&#39;s bossfight, this one was actually\r<br />challenging. While I kept the same base enchantments, I added an element of\r<br />berserker to these legendary weapons. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==PALE BLADE==[/size]\r<br />Deal 10 frost damage\r<br />Absorb 10 magicka \r<br />If target has low stamina, increase frost damage by +15\r<br />\r<br />Context: I can sort&#39;ve get what Bethesda was going far by making this item the\r<br />complete opposite of Red Eagle. Where this does frost damage and turns people.\r<br />Again, horrible&#33; It was no doubt better than Red Eagle&#39;s Bane by stats alone\r<br />but still.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==VOLENDRUNG==[/size]\r<br />Absorb 50 points of stamina\r<br />Forward power attacks has a 25% chance to stun your target\r<br />\r<br />Context: All this item had going was the absorb stamina and it swings as fast\r<br />as a greatsword. The former which you can craft a better enchantment. So I\r<br />wanted to give this mighty hammer more of a impact. \r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==SAVIOR&#39;S HIDE==[/size]\r<br />Blocks 15% of Magicka damage\r<br />50% resistance to poison\r<br />+30% to Health and Stamina regeneration\r<br />\r<br />Context: For the most part, this item was practically useless in a lot of ways.\r<br />While the 15% magicka block is nice, it alone doesnt make the item worthwhile.\r<br />None of the less that poison resistance will hardly see any use. So I thought\r<br />to add a buff to stamina and health regeneration. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==MASQUE OF CLAVICUS VILE==[/size]\r<br />+25 points to Speech\r<br />+20 fortify to Persuasion\r<br />+20 to Illusion\r<br />+50% Magicka regen\r<br />\r<br />Context: This was perhaps one of the worst Daedric items in the game. Practically\r<br />nothing about it was decent except for maybe the barter which for some reason\r<br />they have it as Speechcraft which is literally the same thing. So I decided to\r<br />make it better to better fit the theme of being the masque of admiration. And\r<br />only +5% magicka regen? What?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==DAWNBREAKER==[/size]\r<br />Deals 10 fire damage\r<br />Meridia&#39;s Retribution (same enchantment)\r<br />Deals an additional 10 fire damage to undead.\r<br />\r<br />Context: This is a paladin weapon, so why is it moderately weak? Yeah sure the\r<br />Retribution enchantment is decent but thats about it. So I thought to buff it a\r<br />little against Undead enemies. Now its truly a weapon for Paladins.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5] ==WUUTHRAD==[/size]\r<br />\r<br />+35%damage to elven kind. \r<br />\r<br />Context:It was originally at 20%, so I buffed it up to 35% as this item can also be\r<br />enchanted with another effect. \r<br />\r<br />[size=5] ==ANGI’S BOW==[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Learn Archery skills 10% faster \r<br />\r<br />Context: I thought about making this bow more unique to set it apart from all the other\r<br />hunting bows. Now its great for beginners who wants to delve into archery. \r<br />\r<br />[size=5] ==NETTLEBANE==[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Deals 30fire damage to Spriggan kind Context:For a dagger that sole purpose is to cut through nature and Spriggans, it sure\r<br />did a whole lot of nothing.   \r<br />[size=5]\r<br />==DRAGONPRIEST DAGGER==[/size]\r<br />\r<br />20% armor penetration  Context:It’s a relatively rare and unique item. So why not make it so?  \r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==Kahvozein&#39;s Fang==[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Deals 25extra damage to Dragons \r<br />Deals 10shock damage to others \r<br />\r<br />Context:The unique version of a unique item. So I wanted to feel more unique than its\r<br />unique cousin so it can feel somewhat unique because I like unique things. \r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==PREDATOR’S GAZE==[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Your movement is muffled \r<br />Lightarmor weighs nothing and doesn’t slow you down when worn \r<br />\r<br />Context: Aside from the muffle, there was no reason to pick these over items you can\r<br />enchant yourself. That is until I made it where your movement is unhindered by\r<br />light armor. Now you can better roam around as a predator.  [/center]\r<br />-------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />And thats that for now. I&#39;am planning on buffing other unique items in the near\r<br />future so be sure to check this page every now and then&#33;",
