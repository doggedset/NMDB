  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][u][b][size=6]Update[/size]\r<br />[/b][/u][size=3]\r<br />Changing from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 gave me the opportunity to fix a bug some users were experiencing (AppCrash with &#34;FileNotFoundException&#34;). I used VS 2013 to recompile things and you&#39;ll now get an additional .dll-file which is to be placed alongside the &#34;mitconfigtool.exe&#34; (&#34;moditemtool.exe&#34; doesn&#39;t need it). This should finally get rid of that &#39;lil bugger. \r<br />\r<br />Please note that from now on all versions will be compiled for [b].NET Framework 4[/b] only (Windows 7 users will have to install this seperately).\r<br />[/size][u][b]\r<br />Description[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />This is a fairly simple/small console-based program, which reads your load order (aka &#34;plugins.txt&#34;) and then searches .esp&#39;s and &#39;.esm&#39;s  for items. In the process of doing that it creates simple scripts (containing &#34;player.additem xxxxxxxx 1&#34;) which then can be used in game.\r<br />Since Version 1.2 another tool is included making it possible to create the mandatory configuration file (which had to be done manually in previous versions), select exactly which mods will be (not) scanned for items (via an exclusion list) and what kind of items are to be registered for the scripts (Armor, Weapons, Keys, Potions etc.).\r<br />\r<br />&#34;WTF&#33; Why would that be a good thing?&#34; you might ask - Well, if you got 30 or more armor/clothing/weapon-mods in your load-order (like me), such tool comes in very handy, indeed.\r<br />\r<br />Since I was not aware of any existing tool (or easier method [than adding the items manually in-game]) that does the job, I thought &#34;How hard can it be?&#33;&#34; (cheers to JC^^) and got cracking.\r<br />\r<br />Please be aware that this is a very, very &#34;quick and dirty&#34;-like program, it works with my installation and, in theory, should work with any other installation as well, but I can&#39;t give any kind of guarantee. Oh, and you&#39;ll need [b].NET Framework 4[/b] to run it (comes pre-installed in Windows 8, Windows 7 users will have to install it seperately [if you don&#39;t have already, it&#39;s pretty common]).\r<br />\r<br />[quote][u][b]A Note regarding error messages (in game) when using the scripts[/b][/u]\r<br />This issue still exists and I can&#39;t really find a solution for that other \r<br />than to properly manage your load order. I&#39;ve (sometimes) had this issue\r<br /> while using BOSS or LOOT (I didn&#39;t manually manage the load order while\r<br /> BOSS or LOOT were at it until I got suspicious, because they seemed to \r<br />make just a huge mess of it [regardless which of both I used - I didn&#39;t \r<br />use both at the same time]). What happens there is: The mod IDs are \r<br />calculated normally/correctly for the &#34;esm-section&#34; (the scripts do work\r<br /> for the .esm-files in that case), but before skyrim loads the \r<br />.esp-files it does increment the ID counter by one. This of course means\r<br /> that the majority of the generated scripts is essentially useless, \r<br />because the actual mod&#39;s ID are always greater by one (thus resulting in\r<br /> these error messages).\r<br />Not using BOSS or LOOT and rearranging the mods with NMM in a careful manner (plugin dependencies) resulted in a \r<br />far less chaotic load order and surprise, surprise: Problem gone.\r<br />I don&#39;t really understand this, because generating a useable load order is\r<br /> exactly what BOSS or LOOT are made for ... probably a mistake on my \r<br />side using BOSS/LOOT incorrectly (other than that: no clue).[/quote]I know now why this particular weirdness happens and I probably have to apologise for having blamed BOSS and LOOT: This issue happens due to problems with plugin-dependencies. I had one particular mod still enabled while plugins it depended on were disabled (funny enough that &#34;my&#34; skyrim didn&#39;t crash due to this, because normally it takes even the slightest opportunity to CTD [&#34;Oh, you wanna load a save? Sry, gonna crash there&#33;&#34;]).\r<br />To sum it all up: [u]My own stupidity[/u] is to blame. - If you get this issue, check your plugin-dependencies.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Installation/Usage[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />1. Download \r<br />2. (Optional) Verify the hash-checksum\r<br />3. Extract and/or copy the &#34;moditemtool.exe&#34; and &#34;mitconfigtool.exe&#34; into a folder of your choice.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Usage of &#34;mitconfigtool.exe&#34;[/b][/u]\r<br />Creates/modifies the configuration files for &#34;moditemtool.exe&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />1. Run &#34;mitconfigtool.exe&#34;. If it doesn&#39;t find an existing configuration, it guides you through the configuration process (selecting the skyrim folder is pretty much it). [b]Keep in mind[/b] that sometimes when other windows are on the screen simultaneously, this tool tends to &#34;hide&#34; behind these windows when it displays the next dialog (just go to the taskbar and reselect it in that case) - Most likely this is fixable, but I just didn&#39;t want to spend much time on that particular issue (it isn&#39;t exactly a &#39;biggie&#39;).\r<br />\r<br />After the configuration is done (or an existing configuration is present) the tool loads the skyrim&#39;s plugin list and displays it in the checkbox list. There you can choose which plugins are to be excluded when scanning for items (if there&#39;s no existing exclusion list, all .esm-files will be checked for exclusion automatically - this, of course, can then be changed).\r<br />Above that checkbox list you will find a section for selecting which item types should be included when scanning and another section to change the configuration paths (should you ever need to). (The whole thing should be pretty self-explanatory)\r<br />\r<br />A Screenshot of the main dialog can be seen in the images-section (&#34;Screenshot 1&#34;).\r<br />\r<br />2. When you have selected the desired options/settings, click &#34;Save&#34; or &#34;S&#39;n&#39;C&#34; (which means &#34;Save and Close&#34;). If you click &#34;Close&#34; while there are still changes pending to be saved to the configuration files, you will be asked if you want to save before closing the application (standard program behaviour).\r<br />\r<br />Notes: \r<br /> - When plugins are removed from skyrim&#39;s plugin list that currently are in the exclusion list, these will be displayed with &#39;(***)&#39; prior to their filenames (at the next start of the config-tool). Furthermore these will be put at the end of the exclusion list and, if not deselected, still be saved in the exclusion list as well. This way, they don&#39;t get removed (unless you specifically deselect them before saving) from the exclusion list if a plugin is removed from plugins.txt. See &#34;Screenshot 2&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Usage of &#34;moditemtool.exe&#34;[/b][/u]\r<br />Creates the actual scripts for in game use.\r<br />\r<br />1. Just run it (it will process the plugin-files and create the scripts according to the configuration made with &#34;mitconfigtool.exe&#34;). \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Tips[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />1. If the load order is changed you&#39;ll need to run &#34;moditemtool.exe&#34; again (if necessary &#34;mitconfigtool.exe&#34; as well to modify the exclusion list). If this happens a lot, I suggest creating a .bat-file which executes it prior to staring skyrim/skse.\r<br />2. Alongside the seperate (relatively small) scripts for each plugin, &#34;moditemtool.exe&#34; furthermore creates one big script containing all scanned items. Beware: Can crash your game of it contains a &#39;uber&#39; massive amount of items to be added (yes, I&#39;ve seen that before) and can mess up mod-quests (because it will add quest items to your inventory as well). You can execute it with &#34;bat getAllModItems&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Things I wanted to mention[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />1. The sourcecode will be available for downloading as well, but be warned: I wouldn&#39;t consider it &#34;nice&#34; or &#34;good programming style&#34; or &#34;efficient&#34; (and you&#39;ll find that some variable names are in German). Things get even worse regarding the config-tool: Apart from the itemType bool-Array description, I&#39;ve made no comments whatsoever (&#34;get things done&#34; and not &#34;get bogged down with explaining and documenting [basically all the stuff you don&#39;t want to do^^]&#34;). It isn&#39;t a great deal of code and many things are probably done much easier/faster/shorter using methods or expressions I&#39;ve never about, but I think it&#39;s relatively easy to understand (and after having looked at it you&#39;ll likely think &#34;man, this idiot&#39;s code is utter trash&#34;).\r<br />2. I will try to sort of &#34;maintain&#34; this &#34;thingie&#34; for a bit, but most of the time I&#39;m preoccupied with studying, being at work, making music or playing (skyrim, swtor etc.), so I can&#39;t guarantee for &#34;quick solutions&#34; should the program crash, get the mod-IDs wrong or fail in any other thinkable way (it shouldn&#39;t make your computer explode, though^^). If anybody out there would want to update/rerelease it or incorporate the concept into another utility (BOSS springs to mind)- no biggie, just do it (no permission needed).\r<br />3. Hashes will be provided in the download-descriptions.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Requirements[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />.NET Framework 4.0 (pre-installed since Windows 8)\r<br />Skyrim ... obviously\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Changelog[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />v1.3\r<br />   - Platform upgrade to VS 2013 from VS 2010\r<br />   - Recompile with VS 2013 (.NET Framework 4 only from now on)\r<br />   - No changes to the sourcecode itself\r<br />\r<br />v1.2\r<br />   - Added support for more (hopefully missed none) item types (like keys, potions and so on)\r<br />   - Added support for a list to exclude plugins from scanning (rather than to hardcode this into the program code like I&#39;ve done in previous versions)\r<br />   - The newly added configuration utility now makes the usage of MIT easier and allows managing the exclusion list\r<br />\r<br />v1.1\r<br />   - The original mechanism to delete all old scripts before scanning for new items didn&#39;t work, because of a stupid mistake I made (not a biggie, thus I didn&#39;t upload a new version). Now it works as intended (it deletes all files containing &#34;gami_&#34; and the &#34;getAllModItems.txt&#34; file in the skyrim folder [excluding subfolders])\r<br />   - Enabled the program to scan for weapons (WEAP-records)\r<br />   - Prior to Version v1.1 empty ARMO-records were added to the scripts (resulting in these empty &#34;added&#34;-notices in skyrim) - this should now be fixed\r<br />   - Added an optional line in the .settings-file to enable the user to configure which item types should be scanned for\r<br />     \r<br />v1.0/0.9\r<br />   - Original Release",
