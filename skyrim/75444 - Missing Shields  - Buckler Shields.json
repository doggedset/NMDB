I&#39;ve also slightly changed the textures of the Forsworn Shields to reflect the 2 versions - One is intended as just a standard Shield, craftable fairly early in game with easily obtainable items, the other is intended to be used with the &#34;*** Of the old Gods&#34; set which you receive as part of the Forsworn quest arc and it comes with the exact same enchantment as Spellbreaker\r<br />\r<br />Changes   = Removed the Briar Heart and replaced it with a skull for the plain version \r<br />      = Changed feathers to Hagraven Feathers on the BOTOG\r<br />\r<br />As the name suggests, the Makeshift Buckler is designed to look like exactly that.\r<br /> Description as follows:\r<br />\r<br />Forsworn:\r<br />Stats = Value 65, Weight 3, Armor Type - Light, Rating 14 - Enchantment - None\r<br />Craft = Wolf Pelt, Firewood, Human Skull, Hawk Feathers - Studded Category\r<br />Temper = Bone Meal, Wolf Pelt\r<br />\r<br />BOTOG:\r<br />Stats = Value - 135, Weight  7, Armor Type - Light, Rating 28, Enchantment - Default Spellbreaker Enchantment.\r<br />Craft = Bear Belt, Briar Heart, Hagraven Feathers, Firewood - Daedric Category.\r<br />Temper = Void Salts, Hagraven Claw\r<br />\r<br />Makeshift:\r<br />Stats = Value 70, Weight 3, Armor Type - Light, Rating 13 - Enchantment - None\r<br />Craft = Silver Bowl, Silver Candlestick, Silver Plate, Troll Fat - Studded Category\r<br />Temper = Silver Ingot[/size]\r<br />[s][u][b]\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b][/u][/s]\r<br />[b]\r<br />--- Rant ---[/b]\r<br />Okay, now that that is out of the way. I recently decided to format my HDD and re-install Windows, and in the process re-install all my game. So I  decided to do some HDD cleaning, and found these files still in my Skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />As I remember it, I decided that I needed a Buckler for when I was wearing Nightingale or Forsworn armor, but still  wanted to go sword &#39;n&#39; board. So a buckler shield rather than any of the full shields seemed more appropriate. (particularly for the Nightingales) There were also other armor sets that didn&#39;t have shields, and as I&#39;m a devout &#34;sword &#39;n&#39; board&#34; fighter, it disappointed me to have to sue one of the other big bulky ugly shields.\r<br />\r<br />So as with most things in Skyrim ... If you don&#39;t like it, mod it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]--- Description ---\r<br />\r<br />The &#34;Apprentice one is a bit more &#39;plain&#39; and  designed (i hope) with lower level Assassins in mind i.e. easy to find  ingredients and lower level smithing required. The Other is destined for higher characters  who have\r<br /> completed (or are completing) the Thieves Guild questline and have received (or will be receiving) the Nightingale set.\r<br />\r<br />The Bucklers are completely hand built mesh using vanilla Skyrim objects and both are UV mapped to the [i]Female Nightingale Armor[/i] textures (and if you don&#39;t know what that means, you shouldn&#39;t be here) So if you have a custom texture for that armor, it will also change the appearance of the bucklers.\r<br />---\r<br />The Forsworn Buckler is identical to the Hide Shield in stats, except half the weight. The BOTOG (Buckler\r<br /> of the Old Gods) was randomly tweaked based on the Spellbreaker stats. and the Briar Heart / Hag Raven feathers imbue it with mystical powers of defense, for use when or if I do the Forsworn quest arc and get the \r<br />armor) \r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s based on the Spellbreaker shield mesh, with custom additions and my totally hopeless and dodgy textures, that look &#34;good enough&#34; in game for me.\r<br />---\r<br />The  Makeshift Buckler, as the name suggests, is designed to look like something a Thief, rather than a Blacksmith might put together, hence it  looks like ( and in fact is) some tableware stuck together with Skyrim&#39;s best known sticky, gooey stuff = Troll Fat :) \r<br />\r<br />Again, a completely hand built mesh, bashed together in Nifskope and uses vanilla Skyrim textures. So if you\r<br /> have replacement or custom textures for Tableware, it may look different than my screenshots.[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]---Disclaimer ---[/b]\r<br />These are provided &#34;as is&#34; with no warranties, and I probably won&#39;t  respond to any request for changes or amendments, unless it&#39;s a serious bug.\r<br />\r<br />[b]--- Permissions ---[/b]\r<br /> I&#39;m happy for anyone to use these files as they wish, just please give me some credit and most importantly LET ME KNOW so I can check it out.\r<br />[u][i][b]\r<br />Please note I will NOT condone the uploading of these resources to the Steam workshop or any other mod hosting site.[/b][/i][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[b]--- Tools used ---[/b]\r<br />Nifskope - for the cutten&#39; and pasten o da meshes.\r<br />Paint.net - for the somewhat meh textures.\r<br />NMM\r<br />\r<br />[b]--- Thanks ---[/b]\r<br />Nexus obviously for allowing us to post all our stuffz\r<br />The Nifskope Dev Team without whom much of this would never have come to life.\r<br />The Paint.net Dev Team and community for their programs and plugins.\r<br />Bethesda for this Genre defining game.",
