The presets are Storm, Cris and Mist.\n<br />\n<br />To get them looking exactly as they do in the screenshots you'll need to do the following:\n<br />\n<br />Storm:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Install the Lunari race\n<br />[*]Install Apachii Skyhair\n<br />[*]Navigate to the Lunari race's texture folder (would be under skyrim/data/textures/bhakti) and install the UNP textures (this only works with bodys that use UNP as a base.)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Cris:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Install the Epic Elves mod by zzjy\n<br />[*]Install the SG hair pack (Can be found in the first reply in this [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/41dy1p/does_anyone_have_sg_hair_pack_350/]link[/url]﻿)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Mist:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Install the Valkyrie Race\n<br />[*]navigate to or create the Valkyrie race texture folder (skyrim/data/textures/actors/character_valkyrie/female) and install Fair Skin complexion (works with both CBBE and UNP) \n<br />[*]\n<br />\n<br />[/list]I use the sevenbase bombshell body on my characters however due to them all having their own unique install folders you can have a different body type on each one. Additionally the armour in the screenshots is either from The Amazing World of Bikini Armor mod (found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83383]here[/url]﻿) and the Bikini Ascend armor (found [url=http://mod.dysintropi.me/nisetanaka/]here[/url]﻿.)\n<br />\n<br />Don't bother trying endorse I've disabled them as I don't feel that these are worthy of endorsements.\n<br />\n<br />credits:\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2950481]expired6978[/url] for RaceMenu\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2689072]zzjay[/url] for the Epic Elves race\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1854067]bkahtisean[/url] for the Lunari race\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/674455]sajuuk 1987[/url]﻿ for the Valkyrie race",
