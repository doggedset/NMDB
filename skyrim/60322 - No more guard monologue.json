  "modName": "No more guard monologue",
  "summary": "Will make the guards and some other NPC&#39;s (like Nazeem) ignore you.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod does what the title says. It stops the guards from saying the same piece of monologue every time you get near them. Now, they will just ignore you, just like they do with the rest of the people. Unless you have some crime-gold to pay of course.\r<br />As it was a bit hard to figure out what packages belonged to the guards, and what to other npc&#39;s, there are also other npc&#39;s not saying anything to you when you walk by.",
