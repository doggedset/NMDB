  "descriptionHtml": "[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40615]Included in Relics of Hyrule[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[i]This mod is no longer supported because of its inclusion in Relics of Hyrule. \r<br />Updates are very unlikely.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />&#39;&#39;I will go on ahead to try to seal up the evil dragon... I&#39;m concerned, though, because I don&#39;t have the legendary hammer... But I have no choice.&#39;&#39; \r<br />\r<br />Shortly after making the Blade of Evil&#39;s Bane mod, I wanted to make a Megaton Hammer, but did not have a good mesh of it. All of the meshes I found were staying too true to the original appearance of the Hammer (i.e., a cartoonish, simple appearance developed using technology from the 1990s), and were unsuited to the realism of Skyrim. So, using the Dwarven Warhammer and Mace, I cobbled together a shortm one-handed warhammer mesh that gave the Megaton Hammer a sturdier, deadlier look. \r<br />\r<br />A video showing off the Hammer&#39;s abilities, as wielded by a clumsy Orc. (fire not included)\r<br />[youtube]iYe-Q1-nUMc[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />The Megaton Hammer is one-handed and has chance to knock down enemies by its heavy staggering effect, its chance of striking a pressure point and inducing paralysis, simply by depleting their stamina, or by striking something vital and killing them instantly. \r<br />It swings very slowly, but is much stronger than a daedric mace, equal in strength to an elven warhammer. It is temperable with two steel ingots. \r<br />Power attacks guarantee knockback, but are very slow, so using the Hammer with a shield or the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36050]Golden Gauntlets[/url] is highly recommended. \r<br />\r<br />You can find the Hammer at Arcwind Point in a master-locked chest near an upright draugr coffin. \r<br />\r<br />I do not intend to make a two-handed version, as doing so would require the hammer to be treated as a greatsword (the handle is too short for it to be treated as a warhammer, and lengthening it just seems...wrong). I would have to disable quite a few kill-cams somehow to make that work, so it&#39;s likely not going to happen. Also, the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35969]Biggoron&#39;s Sword[/url] fills that niche very nicely.\r<br />\r<br />Video and more images soon&#33;",
