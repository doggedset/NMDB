  "descriptionHtml": "I know there are many mods that claim to do this, but every one I have come across seems to be missing some key components and items.\r<br />\r<br />This is a simple mod that I created for personal use, and decided to upload. You have to download this manually.\r<br />\r<br />This gives you a batch file that adds [b]ALL[/b] necessary items to fully build and furnish your Hearthfire home. As far as I can tell I did not miss any items for any home so send me a message or add a post if I forgot anything. \r<br />\r<br />Yes, I realize you have materials left over. This batch file incorporates all rooms and areas, so just sell or get rid of the extra materials once you have finished your Hearthfire home.\r<br />\r<br />You will need to modify the batch file to fit your load order. I added instructions in a ReadMe.\r<br />\r<br />As I don&#39;t see a reason to reupload or use this in another mod, the answer is no. You can&#39;t reupload it or use it, if you think you have good reason to use it then send me a message. Otherwise don&#39;t think about it.",
