Siri also hails from Dagon Fel and has her Grandmothers red hair. She is  a Combat Witch Blade, strong and quiet. You will find her in Morthal at the Moor Side Inn, she is wearing a Thieves Guild Delvin outfit and caring an ebony sword and a glass dagger.\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][size=3][color=red]Her Base Skills are:[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />One-handed   \t28\r<br />Two-handed   \t25\r<br />Archery            \t15\r<br />Block                26\r<br />Smithing          \t20\r<br />Heavy Armor \t15\r<br />Light Armor    \t20\r<br />Pickpocket      \t15\r<br />Lockpicking    \t15\r<br />Sneak\t\t15\r<br />Alchemy\t\t15\r<br />Speech\t\t20\r<br />Alteration\t\t15\r<br />Conjuration\t15\r<br />Destruction\t24\r<br />Illusion\t\t21\r<br />Restoration\t18\r<br />Enchanting\t15\r<br />\r<br />Her Spells are:\r<br />Fireball\r<br />Ice Spike RH\r<br />Sparks     LH[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://johngarza.com/images/gaming/SiriFarseer2.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />She is Unique and Essential and Marriageable, I&#39;ve not married her so I&#39;m not sure how she responds to the package ( feedback on issues would be appreciated). She doesn&#39;t have an AI package as I want to give her something unique (still working on that one), if you are inclined and capable you can go ahead and give her what you want in an AI package, just let me know what you do (just curious). She will eventually be updated with one in the future. I&#39;ve used her for quite a while so she is well tested. One thing about Siri, her fireball is incredibly powerful so if you don&#39;t want someone who will blow the enemy out of the water in an instant, she is definitely not for you.  I use EFF so I know she works well with it, she will sandbox if you tell her to relax using EFF.\r<br />\r<br />Also her facegen textures are included in the BSA file so there should be no issue with grey face, I made sure to place them in correct folder hierarchy.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3][color=green]Installation:[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Usual installation instructions, Use the NMM or drop the file in your Skyrim data folder, in Steam that would be Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim/Data/ (if you&#39;re running a 64 bit system it would be in Program Files(x86) ). \r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3][color=green]Uninstallation:[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Reverse the process either delete the file from Data folder but if you used NMM it&#39;s better to use it to remove the mod.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />===================================================================================\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3][color=red]Required Mods[/color][/size] (needed for her hair):[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Apachii Sky Hair http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r<br />\r<br />======================================================================================\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3][color=red]Recommended Mods[/color][/size]  ( I use these, so if you want her to look like the pictures, I recommend them):[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Calliente CBBE: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?\r<br />\r<br />CBBE skin texture V2 V3 plus Thepal and UNP compatible - CBBE skin texture v1_8 feminine arm toned abs PATCH: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6554/?\r<br />\r<br />Killer Keos Skimpy CBBE V2-V3 Armor Replacer (I recommend v6.6.8): http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3654/?\r<br />\r<br />Natural Eyes by Neverbridge81: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3589/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />========================================================================================\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Thanks to the following Modders for creating ways to make mods look better. Their mods are installed on my system and used to make Siri and my other followers look different than they would if you do not install them (I highly recommend their use):\r<br />\r<br />Apachi, Caliente, Navetsea, Neverbridge81 and so many others[/size]\r<br />",
