  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/xyEpN.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a 4+ hour-long campaign to the end of the Dark Brotherhood Questline.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/pjZvP.png[/img]\r\n2 new Followers, fully voice acted and specially scripted for sneaky assassin players:\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/GnizE.png[/img]\r\n\r\nAverna – will hide in the shadows when you are sneaking. If you sneak attack, she will stay invisible and avoid aggro. Get back up on your feet and she will spring from the void to smite your enemies!\r\n\r\nStabby – Stabby will actively try to perform sneak attacks while you are sneaking. He also has mysterious abilities that kick into place when either he or the player are near death.\r\n\r\nThese two new followers will appear in the Dawnstar Sanctuary shortly after the end of the Dark Brotherhood Questline. Stabby has Unfinished Death Contracts from Bruma. Averna needs your help performing a dark ritual. Both are hiding something while a sinister new enemy arises and attacks the Dark Brotherhood!\r\n\r\nThis mod also adds random conversations to the Dawnstar Sanctuary. I personally missed hearing these stories, now you can hear Averna, Stabby, Nazir and Babette discuss some of their most memorable death contracts!\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/mFoyY.png[/img]\r\n22 New Quests!\r\n6 New Death Contracts – kill the most powerful men in Skyrim.\r\n6 New Words of Power!\r\n3 New Magic Spells!\r\n2 Unique Dungeons.\r\nPoisoned Apples – Everyone\\'s favorite fruit from Oblivion returns with a new twist!\r\nArgonian Black Rum – Makes everyone happy!\r\nAnd the Biggest, Most Ridiculously massive hoard of treasure you\\'ve ever seen in skyrim!\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a work in progress. It is 100% complete. I will not be adding any new content to this mod, though I will be supporting bug fixes.\r\nThis mod has been my passion project for the last half year. I ran myself ragged working on two game projects, stretched my voice actress to her limits, and almost developed a drinking habit so that someone on the internet might some day play my mod and enjoy themselves.\r\nI really hope you take just a moment to try it out, my eternal gratitude to all of those who do!\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/i6lYV.png[/img]\r\n\r\nSend Questions/Comments/Bug Reports to:\r\nTheDarkBrotherhoodResurrection@gmail.com\r\n\r\nNOTE: If for some reason, you don\\'t want to play the Dark Brotherhood questline to try this mod, there is a shortcut:\r\nTo skip to the end of the dark brotherhood quest:\r\n1) Type \\'SetStage DB11 0\\'\r\n2) Wait a few seconds for the messages to stop\r\n3) Follow the quest until you talk to nazir and he mentions going to the DawnStar Sanctuary\r\n4) Either finish the last dark brotherhood quest (it ties into the mod backstory) or leave the sanctuary and then type \\'setstage DB11 80\\'\r\n5) After talking to Nazir in the Dawnstar Sanctuary, leave and re-enter, the mod should now start\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/SX5zC.png[/img]\r\nBethesda\r\nMembers of the Creation Kit Forum\r\nThe Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages\r\nTimeGate Studios Inc.\r\nJoe Wallace - video editor\r\nMeg McDonald - Voice Actress (Averna, Susan Gold-Love, Alicia Gold-love)\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/7lzuE.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[url=http://dbresurrection.blogspot.com/] Check out my Developer Diary [/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://zoywiki.com/index.php/DBR]If for some reason you get stuck playing this mod, check out the full walkthrough on the official wiki[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34106] please see my other mod, The Rabbit Hole![/url]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/CCbh5.png[/img]\r\n[youtube]tcB_s7DB25o[/youtube][youtube]sbWbr9OvNlU[/youtube]\r\n[youtube]iBLp8-aKhBw[/youtube][youtube]NMiU1s2oLwE[/youtube]\r\n",
