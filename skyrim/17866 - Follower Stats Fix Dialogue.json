  "descriptionHtml": "[color=yellow][b]This mod is obsolete as of Skyrim official patch 1.6 (but still can be used to fix followers in save games made prior this patch).[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nAdds \\\"Get some rest, you look weary...\\\" option to current followers dialogue that resets followers stats using disable/enable method. (Retaining all items in followers inventory.)\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n1.0 - Initial release.\r\n1.1 - Ironed out some re equipping quirks.\r\n1.2 - Overhauled internal script mechanics and tweaked fade effect times.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nHas a small issue with \\\"Auto Unequip Arrows\\\" mod by Alek (Does not re equip arrows, can be fixed by forcing the follower to switch weapons).\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\nTo Shadowmann for some good pointers (used in 1.1).\r\n\r\np.s. Inspired by feature from \\\"UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul\\\" mod by fLokii (I liked the idea but wanted to keep my game more vanilla, did not need the other stuff in that mod + this feature needed some tweaks IMHO.)\r\n\r\np.p.s. Should also work with other follower mods and custom followers.",
