  "summary": "Adds permanent bound weapons using the vanilla flames as craftable. It also modifies ound Arrows to make them explode upon contact with a surface.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds craftable bound weapons to the forge. These weapons use the vanilla-flames appearance and disappear when sheathed, with the exception of the bow (working on it). The weapons added for now are: \r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=1]Sword[/size]\r<br />[size=1][/size][*][size=1]Dagger[/size]\r<br />[*][size=1]Battleaxe[/size]\r<br />[*][size=1]Bow[/size]\r<br />[*][size=1]Arrows[/size]\r<br />[*][size=1]Pickaxe[/size]\r<br />[*][size=1]Woodcutter&#39;s Axe[/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[size=1]Next on the list: Greatsword, War Axe, Shield, alternate sword/katana.[/size]\r<br />[size=2]\r<br />The mod[/size] also modifies bound arrows (or any projectile that uses them as a base, such as the Ethereal Arrows Perk from SPERG) to make them explode upon contact with a surface, instead of having them lying around/pincushioning an enemy like normal arrows. It&#39;s a purely esthetic explosion, it adds no effect or damage whatsoever. Currently it has no sound since I&#39;ve yet to find something that doesn&#39;t sound too loud for what is actually happening.",
