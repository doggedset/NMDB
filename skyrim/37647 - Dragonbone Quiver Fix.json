  "summary": "Fixes the issue with the Dragonbone Arrow&#39;s quiver, where if you have just one arrow, the whole middle of the quiver disappears. DAWNGUARD ONLY, CAUSE DRAGONBONE ARROWS ARE A DAWNGUARD THING.",
  "descriptionHtml": "While testing Silmeri I discovered this rather glaring issue with the Dragonbone Arrows added by Dawnguard. Bethesda, in their infinite wisdom, separated the middle of the quiver and fused it to the additional arrows in the quiver, so that when you&#39;re down to one arrow, those filler arrows disappear AND take the center of the quiver with it, leaving you with just the metal caps. This mod fixes that little issue.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][u]This mod is now a part of the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23491/?]Unofficial Dawnguard Patch[/url]. It&#39;s highly recommended to get the patch if you have Dawnguard, but if you don&#39;t want it this mod&#39;ll still be around.[/color][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]THIS MOD REQUIRES DAWNGUARD, SINCE THE ARROWS ARE ADDED BY THE DLC. IT WON&#39;T WORK WITH VANILLA &#39;CAUSE THERE AIN&#39;T NO VANILLA DRAGONBONE ARROWS.[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]INSTALLATION[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Extract that meshes folder to your Data folder. If it says &#34;yo, there&#39;s already a dlc01 folder here, y&#39;wanna merge it?&#34;, say yes to that. This&#39;ll only overwrite the quiver for the Dragonbone arrows, so unless you have some mod that messes with it, it shouldn&#39;t break anything.",
