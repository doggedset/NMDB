  "descriptionHtml": "Hi there,\r\nI was a bit disappointed when I saw that the Solstheim\\'s musics were playing only on the island, so I made this mod which allows the games to play these tracks when you are in Skyrim !\r\n\r\nThe musics will play on the wilderness of Skyrim (mountains, plains, forest...) but also in towns.\r\n I hope this mod will be useful for a bunch of you ;)\r\nInstallation: \r\n  -simple NMM install;\r\n  -manual installation : extract the file and drag and drop the data folder to your Skyrim installation, no music are added. \r\n\r\n/!\\\\ This mod doesn\\'t add any music, it just plays music from the Dragonborn DLC when you are in skyrim.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nPS: I\\'m going to do a better description sometime soon, but I\\'m pretty busy at the moment...",
