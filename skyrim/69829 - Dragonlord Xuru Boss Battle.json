  "summary": "This boss is extremely strong. If you want to test your skills after developing your character for so long, this is the mod for you. You will need Dawnguard and Dragonborn. Install this mod simply by dropping the ESP file into your Skyrim data.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This boss is extremely strong. He will conjure dragons, he will decapitate you, and he will not rest until you are dead.\r<br />He can be found near Fellglow Keep with his pet dragon: Xurnavakhiir. Make sure to bring tons of stamina and healing potions. And I say stamina because you will need to block him A LOT. A simple power attack from him can cost you all your health.\r<br />\r<br />This is the 3rd boss battle I&#39;ve created. If you want to fight the other two really powerful bosses, here are the links:\r<br />Zavakin: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69770/\r<br />Yyon:Â http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69802",
