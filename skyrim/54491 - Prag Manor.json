  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/ebTG57B.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/kZmEH0I.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Why another player home? I created Prag Manor for myself, and have been using it for some time. I&#39;ve tried a lot of the player homes here on the Nexus, and while many of them are impressive, none of them really worked for me. They have too many rooms, too many doors, too many halls, too many frills, etc...\r<br />\r<br />[b]BEHOLD&#33;[/b] Prag Manor: a simple player home. It&#39;s one big room containing everything the player needs and absolutely nothing superfluous.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s conveniently located outside Whiterun, accessible via a new trapdoor in the floor of the destroyed house near the Western Watchtower. \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/YKQj0CH.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Packed into the single spacious room awaits:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Alchemy lab\r<br />[*]Bed\r<br />[*]Chopping block (with axe)\r<br />[*]Cooking gear\r<br />[*]Enchanting table\r<br />[*]Forge\r<br />[*]Grindstone\r<br />[*]Smelter\r<br />[*]Tanning rack\r<br />[*]Various containers\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Check out the images, I think everything on the list is shown in them.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/IJmKhSr.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s a player home&#33; I assume it&#39;s compatible with just about everything.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/vYOBn2n.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda, for making the game, of course.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/hZf3zag.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />I hope this is the perfect solution for those of you who also don&#39;t need a whole lot of bells and whistles in a player home. \r<br />\r<br />Two final things:\r<br />\r<br />If I&#39;ve missed anything [i]essential[/i] to the player&#39;s ability to function as an adventurer/Dragonborn/badass, let me know, but beware: I decide what is essential. You&#39;re free to modify the mod in the creation kit and add whatever you want, but I don&#39;t understand the need for bookshelves and mannequins and other trifles, so I&#39;m not putting stuff like that in my home.\r<br />\r<br />Also, if you can&#39;t tell from the pictures, I use an ENB preset. Right now I&#39;m using Confidence-Man&#39;s wonderful [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50065/?]Natural Lighting and Atmospherics[/url]. I haven&#39;t tested Prag Manor in Vanilla Skyrim, so let me know if it looks like total poop without ENB.\r<br />\r<br />Peace be upon you.",
