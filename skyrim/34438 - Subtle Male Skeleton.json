  "summary": "Subtle adjustment to the male skeleton.nif file",
  "descriptionHtml": "Just a quick little mod. I always liked the idea of the Better Male Skeleton mod thats been out for ages but it was just too exaggerated to my \r\ntastes. In a fit of experimentation, I sorted out how to adjust my own skeleton to be more in tune with what I wanted the male body to look \r\nlike.\r\n\r\nHonestly this hasn\\'t been very thoroughly tested, but I figured I would release it while I am thinking about it, otherwise it will never see \r\nthe light of day. \r\n\r\nThe adjustments I made were to narrow the hips slightly, lengthen the legs a little, lengthen the arms and widen the shoulders a bit and \r\nbroaden the chest just a tad. The changes are fairly small but together they make for a much more interesting torso, in my mind. \r\n\r\nUnless I run into something fantastically wrong with this setup, I will likely never touch this mod again, but with the dearth of male \r\nrelated mods out there, I felt it was my duty to make available something that other folks may enjoy.\r\n\r\nCompatibility;\r\nThis mod is not compatible with any mod that alters the skeleton.nif file. If you have a mod that does and you want to use my skeleton as well, just post in the comments section and I will see what I can do.\r\n\r\nInstallation;\r\n\r\nJust drag and drop, if you have unpacked your .bsa files then you may be asked to overwrite the vanilla skeleton.nif, \r\njust replace it and you\\'re ready to rock\r\n\r\nUninstallation;\r\nJust head to \r\nmeshes/actors/character/character assets/skeleton.nif \r\nand delete that file to use the vanilla skeleton again.\r\n\r\nCredits;\r\nBGS for making Skyrim so awesome\r\nNexus for hosting all these wonderful mods\r\nchrisvorster for inspiring this mod with his Better Male Skeletons mod",
