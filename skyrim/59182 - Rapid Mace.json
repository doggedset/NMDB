  "summary": "Adds a small mace to the game that looks and feels exactly like the vanilla steel Mace, with only a small twist; It&#39;s faster, and lighter. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a steel mace to the game called a Rapid Mace. The mace is lighter, weighing in at only seven, and it should be faster to swing as well. I placed the mace at the little Talos Worship sight with the dead worshippers, near Helgen. It&#39;s right by that little bandit camp that always steals the deer i want to shoot. The jerks. This is my first actual mod, and it&#39;s up mostly cause I am really, really bored. Comment if anything about it seems off, like it&#39;s slower than the normal mace for example. There shouldn&#39;t be any conflicts, but, you never know.",
