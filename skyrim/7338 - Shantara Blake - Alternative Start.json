  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"It\\'s not the time for breeding horses, my dear. It\\'s the time for heroes! Once I was an adventurer, but then I took an arrow in the knee. Now it\\'s up to you, Shantara. Many realms of Tamriel are craving for an adventurer. Don\\'t stay at home. Fame and fortune are waiting ...\\\"\r\nHer Father has taught her all the things he ever learned while hunting down bandits, fighting strange creatures and looting caves filled up with treasures. \r\nHe showed her how to fight with a blade, how to shoot with a bow and how to use her shield properly. \r\nHer mother crafted her an armor, her uncle gets her some weapons - and off she went. \r\nAfter wandering through Cyrodiil for a while she decided to leave the grounds of her ancestry and cross the border to Skyrim. \r\nAnd there she is - in a weird part of Tamriel. On her way to Falkreath she\\'d heard stories about Stormcloaks and Imperials, about a rotten town called Riften and horkers - she couldn\\'t wait to see all these things ...\r\n\r\nLike I said, Shantara is not a rookie. Her father provided her with some skills and perks; so this is not a hardcore rpg-start: \r\nArchery (40)\r\n-\tOverdrawn 1\r\n-\tEagle Eye\r\n-\tCritical Shot\r\n-\tSteady Hand 1\r\nBlock (30)\r\n-\tShield Wall 1\r\n-\tDeflects Arrows\r\nLight Armor (30)\r\n-\tAgile Defender 1\r\n-\tCustom Fit\r\nOne Handed (40)\r\n-\tArmsman 1\r\n-\tFighting Stance\r\n-\tBladesman 1\r\nSmithing (50)\r\n-\tSteel\r\n-\tElven\r\n-\tAdvanced\r\nSneak (40)\r\n-\tStealth 1\r\n-\tBackstab\r\n-\tMuffled Movements\r\nHealth: 160\r\nStamina: 160\r\nMagicka: 150\r\nI set CarryWeight to 800 and her Level to 17. \r\nShe is equipped with: \r\n-\tLeather Armor\r\n-\tLeather Boots\r\n-\tLeather Bracers\r\n-\tLeather Helmet\r\n-\tHide Shield\r\n-\tHunting Bow\r\n-\tSteel Sword\r\n-\t8 Potions of minor Healing\r\n-\t5 Potions of minor Stamina\r\n-\t2 Bear Pelts\r\n-\t5 Wolf Pelts\r\n-\t600 Septims\r\nThe other Skills (without perks) are: \r\n-\tTwo handed 15\r\n-\tHeavy Armor 15\r\n-\tAlchemy 20\r\n-\tLockpicking 15\r\n-\tPickpocket 15\r\n-\tSpeechcraft 15\r\n-\tAlteration 15\r\n-\tDestruction 15\r\n-\tEnchanting 15\r\n-\tIllusion 20\r\n-\tRestoration 15\r\n-\tConjuration 15\r\nThe Main Quest is disabled, there are no deeds to do. You can do whatever you like - just fill up her quest book :-)\r\n\r\n***\r\nAnd now for something completely different:\r\n\r\nThis is not a brand new alternative start, because I couldn\\'t do this. I altered \\\"Azia Nightshade Alternative Start by Joel Strawbridge\\\" so I have to thank him for his good work! The original mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6498\r\n\r\nI used some mods to create Shantara: \r\nBetter Females by Bella: \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\nAthletic Nude Women - CBBE by Valstein0: \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=563\r\nCoolsims Hair Pack by newermind43: \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3809\r\nNo More Blocky Faces by Xenius: \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=30\r\n\r\nMy thanks to Bethesda for Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind ... Wow, I love you.\r\n\r\nAnd now - have fun :-)\r\n\r\n",
