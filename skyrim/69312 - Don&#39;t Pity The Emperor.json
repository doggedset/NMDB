  "descriptionHtml": "The guards of Stormcloak cities will express their sadness and pity about the emperor&#39;s death, after the completion of Hail Sithis&#33;; while the rebels shouldn&#39;t have such feelings, as they hate the emperor to their bones as the story suggests. So I fix it, by adding conditions to those lines.\r<br />\r<br />But I leave one line untouched. It expresses the guards&#39; fear towards the Dark Brotherhood, while doesn&#39;t show much sympathy about the emperor&#39;s death, so I think it&#39;s fine to leave it there.\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s compatible with GDO, or did GDO did the same thing; if so, please inform.\r<br />\r<br />Requirement:\r<br />Skyrim and its latest update. Bethesda had already said in 2013 that they won&#39;t make anymore update for Skyrim.",
