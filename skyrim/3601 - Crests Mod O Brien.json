  "descriptionHtml": "Firstly, sorry that the Name is mis-spelt, the Nexus does not allow certain Characters... its meant to be O\\'Brien.\r\n\r\nanyway, check the screen shots and download if you like, this is a re-texture of my earlier mod \\'Celtic Hide Armor\\' but this time to carry O\\'Brien Tartan as requested by givvvver.\r\n\r\nhope you like using it as much as i did making it :) and another point, the shield is from my original mod and does NOT come with this package. to get the shield you will need to download the original mod first.\r\n\r\nCallaghan04\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\nyou may use this texture provided you ask permission and give me credit, also if you release it on the net then send me a link to the finished product. im also always open to requests to continue the ever going Crests Mods.",
