  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#00ffff][u][b][font=Georgia][size=6]ClefJ&#39;s Darkwater Crossing [/size][/font][/b][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />There was some lore, somewhere, that Ulfric and his men were passing through Darkwater Crossing when they were ambushed by the Empire. It was a small mining settlement of one house and a few tents. I was heavily inspired by JK&#39;s magnificent town work, so I decided to work on something similar, rather than create a whole new town as I had before. \r<br />\r<br />I have redesigned Darkwater Crossing into a real settlement, though still small. I had attempted to model the place like a medieval Scottish hamlet, that hopefully brings some flare into the landscape in south Eastmarch, and a reason for you to come by here now and then.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]The mod now adds: [/color]\r<br />- A small settlement wall, with an extra guard (that rotates with the civil war quest like the others&#33;), with 2 gates to the settlement.\r<br />- An outdoors ingredients merchant for passerby&#39;s.\r<br />- A new General Goods store with dunmer merchant.\r<br />- A new Inn and Tavern, with working bard and innkeeper (The larger room can be rented&#33;), and a large patio overlooking the lake.\r<br />- Many aesthetic details around the town, with added flora and architecture.\r<br />- Much of the navmesh remains the same, creating a lack of conflicts, if any at all. \r<br />- Most importantly, a [color=#00ffff]new player home[/color]&#33; Darkwater Keep just outside of the settlement offers a small residence of a Scottish tower-house, with a main hall, laboratory and trophy room, and master bedroom. All follower beds inhabit the main hall, Beowulf style. There are 2 mannequins, but many weapon displays. And a privy. The house is yours as soon as you arrive, as the previous resident was taken along with Ulfric in the beginning of the game. \r<br />[color=#ff0000]\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />[color=#ffffff]Â - Dragonborn. I might go back and give it some Hearthfire if desired.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Known Conflicts: [/color]\r<br />-Mods that edit the cells immediately around Darkwater Crossing, such as the Fort Darkwater file.\r<br />- Some clipping with the carriage from Better Fast Travel.\r<br />- The quest/spell mod [color=#00ffff]Spectraverse [/color]has a location dependency that this town blocks. Turning the mod on/off to complete this part of Spectraverse solved it for me. \r<br />\r<br />Thank you for your time and downloads&#33; [/center]",
