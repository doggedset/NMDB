  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb445/FoxyFoxia/TheHuntingGroundsBowandArrowslogo_zpsa6181f7d.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=32][B][center][Color=FF0000]REQUIRES DAWNGUARD, DRAGONBORN, and THE ORIGINAL HUNTING GROUNDS OUTFIT![/color][/center][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me start off by first stating I\\'m a fan of Nimezi\\'s original Hunting Grounds Outfit. I\\'m a big fan of it as of recent.\r\n\r\nWell, after awhile I looked at it and I felt something was missing from this armor set. Something that needed to be there but wasn\\'t it wasn\\'t until it finally hit me. A weapon needed to go with it. That\\'s what was missing I looked at all the meshes bethesda gave us to see which ones worked with the armor the before I started anything else.\r\n\r\nAfter looking things over I finally settled on the Nordic Bow and Arrow set since The Armor\\'s version 2.0 sported pieces of the Nordic armor, I figured it would be best to use pieces of the Nordic weapons with it.\r\n\r\nAnd that\\'s what lead to this mod.\r\n\r\nI released some images last night of the Bow and Arrow and said I was going to ask for Permission from Nimezis to release these, well I got Nimezis blessing and now you all can enjoy this bow and Arrow set with your Hunting Grounds outfit!\r\n\r\nI am sure now asking \\\"where do I find these?\\\" Well lucky enough for you, I made sure these are craftable under the Nordic Weapons Section, But there is a cache! You can only create them from 11pm to 12am in game. Just like the orignal \\\"Hunting Grounds Outfit.\\\"  I wanted to insure you get these just like the outfit as Nimezis intended instead of placing them somewhere to find or Automatically be able to craft them immediately.\r\n\r\nNow onto installation,\r\n\r\nStep 1: be sure to have Dawnguard and Dragonborn installed\r\nStep 2: Be sure to have Nimezis original Hunting Grounds Outfit installed, it can be found [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30466]Here[/url]\r\nStep 3: Download my mod with NMM or do it manually\r\nStep 4: install with NMM or do it manually. NMM will probably say this mod is already installed want to update? Just click No and when it asks about the ESP tell it to overwrite the original ESP from Nimezis.\r\nStep 6: That\\'s all folks, shouldn\\'t be that hard.",
