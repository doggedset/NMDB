As a nord, Peris was a true believer of talos. She was sentenced to life imprisonment for it and put in Helgen jail. She was so angry that the thunder and bloodlust exploded. One day, a huge drangon named Alduin razed the  Helgen, she escaped from prison to the Riverwood. The town was  beautiful, and everyone was amiable and leisurely , which was the life she had long been yearing for. Athene heard Whiterun Lord could tolerate the nagging Heimskr to deliver sermons about Talos and the town of Riverwood was Whiterun territory, so she decided to stay and help the town assault against bandits, vampires and dragon.\n<br />\n<br />Body:UNP  \n<br />Level:2-300（1.2rate）\n<br />Location: Sleeping Giant Inn\n<br />Voice:Female Young Eager\n<br />Height/weight:1.0/100\n<br />Combatstyle :preferring heavy armor and two-handed Axe,  crossbow.\n<br />Essential, Marriageable\n<br /> \n<br />Peris have a preference for her prison clothes, and had better change the clothes before you give her new dress.   Recommend AFT set management.\n<br />You can improve the ThunderAxe. \n<br />\n<br />CreationKit1.9.32\n<br />Please post your screenshot !",
