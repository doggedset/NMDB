  "descriptionHtml": "Northpoint is a  bit isolated from other cities in High Rock.  Isolated is also how Rerlan grew up.  He always just kept to himself and focused on his studies.  From a young age he showed a great affinity for magic, even for a breton.  Hearing tales of the College of Winterhold and its age defying arch mage, Savos Aren, Rerlan started his journey to Winterhold.  After arriving Rerlan quickly established himself.  He worked hard in all the schools of magic but his real passions were the destruction and conjuration schools.  His quick advancement caught the eyes of all the college members.  This was a mixed blessing for Rerlan.  Seeing his quick advancement, Savos Aren started giving Rerlan private classes.  The other side of the coin was that everyone else started to become unfriendly with him.  While Rerlan couldn\\'t care less what the others thought, they started to interrupt his work.  When a dragon was spotted flying over Winterhold towards Whiterun, the jarl released a job for somebody to take a message to the jarl of Whiterun about the dragon.  Seeing this as a way to break the tensions, Savos said the college would take the job.  He then assigned Rerlan the task saying that if Rerlan were to leave for a while the other members might cool off.  With only his robes and ten gold, Rerlan prepared for his journey.  \r\n\r\nThis is an alternative start.  His skills are:\r\nConjuration and destruction are at 40 since those are his favored schools\r\nThe other schools of magic are at 30 because of his semi-advanced knowledge\r\nEnchanting is at 20 because of its difference from the other schools making it a bit harder to learn with the other schools\r\nAlchemy is at 20 since every good mage should be able to create a basic potion\r\nAll the other skills are 0 because he has not had experience with these\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nAOF Believable Hair-Female and Male- (I used this to boost the hair quality in the screenshot)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4307\r\n\r\nXCE - Xenius Character Enhancement (I used this to boost the characters looks in the screenshot)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356\r\n\r\nRecommendations: (I, of course, recommend the mods I used above along with these)\r\nWeapons of the Third Era\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3871\r\n\r\nJaySuS Swords \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1002\r\n\r\nFur Hoods HD \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3201\r\n\r\nA Quality World Map - With Roads\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4929\r\n\r\nCompelling Treasure Maps\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6907\r\n\r\nDeadly Dragons\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3829\r\n\r\nDFB Companion Bow Visible\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6520\r\n\r\nDovahkiin Hideout\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6032\r\n\r\nFirewood For Sale\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5653\r\n\r\nI Put A Spell On You - More Enchanting Options \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3313\r\n\r\nLord Armor\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5853\r\n\r\nMidas Magic - Spells in Skyrim\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3413\r\n\r\nNPC Bartering\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6802\r\n\r\nPhenderix Magic Evolved - 144 New Spells\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5898\r\n\r\nPricier and Heavier Pelts and Hides \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7039\r\n\r\nQuick Tomb Looting\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6591\r\n\r\nSkyrim Performance PLUS\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6387\r\n\r\nSkyrim Nordplate Enhanced\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6804\r\n\r\nWars in Skyrim IV - Dark Rainbow is back-\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6176\r\n\r\nWitchers Blades\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6253\r\n\r\nVarious Guards Outfit for Every City TS Edition \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6770\r\n\r\n\r\nBugs/Issues/Questions\r\nIf there are any problems or general questions feel free to voice them in the comments section which I will try to check often\r\n",
