  "summary": "Increases damage dealt and received significantly. Includes other minor changes. Makes combat more fast paced and dangerous.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Increases damage dealt and recieved significantly. The player will inflict much more damage with spells, weapons, poisons, and the like. But, their enemies will also inflict much more damage on them. A squishy mage wearing nothing but cloth robes will likely be instantly killed by an axe wielding brute... assuming the mage doesn\\'t toast him first. To compensate for all of this extra damage, healing spells and potions have been increased in effectiveness. Because combat is faster, skill gain is increased as well.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer - This mod will not be for everyone, depending on your playstyle you may find it too easy, or too difficult. I recommend playing on adept difficulty. Any easier and most of your enemies will likely die instantly, any harder and most of your enemies will instantly kill you.\r\n\r\nThis is currently the first release, so there may be some minor errors.\r\n\r\nThis mod should be compatable with most other mods. However, mods that add creatures races, or new spells will not have the new material buffed in attack power.\r\n\r\nLikewise, any old enchantments or potions brewed before installing this mod will not be as powerful.\r\n\r\nI hope you all enjoy this mod!\r\n\r\n- Rich",
