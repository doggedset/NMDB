Anything else\r\n\r\n===============\r\n1. DESCRIPTION\r\n===============\r\n\r\nHearthfire Fortified is a mod series that aims to give the Hearthfire homes some well needed protection whilst maintaining lore and realism. This .esp focuses on Lakeview Manor. Located in a heavily forested area, lumber is easy to come by, and so this is reflected in the defences.\r\n\r\n- A perimeter stockade has been added, complete with a main gatehouse and two side gates.\r\n- Two guard towers have been added, north and south. The northern one replaces the alter and necromancer, and has its own walls.\r\n- Three guards will now man these towers.\r\n- The pond to the south has been removed and has been replaced with a road leading up to the main entrance.\r\n- The dead woodcutter has been removed.\r\n- A small pier and rowing boat have been added on the lake.\r\n\r\nThis mod simply adds the fortifications; you do not need to build them yourselves. Therefore, it is advised to build most of the exterior of your home before installing the mod. \r\n\r\nUpdate: Version 1.01 changes:\r\n\r\n- Conjuration books found at the alter has been placed at the southern outpost\r\n- Random spawn point near walls has been removed\r\n\r\nThanks to larade and ssconvert for the bug reports.\r\n\r\n===============\r\n2. Requirements\r\n===============\r\n\r\nRequires the Hearthfire DLC.\r\n\r\nRECOMENDED MODS:\r\nThis plugin is compatible with any guard mods I have tried, so any of those are recommended. I personally use this one:\r\n\r\n\r\nGuards on Your home -hearthfire- by Abram1\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25140/?tab=1&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D25140%26preview%3D&pUp=1\r\n\r\n========================\r\n3.
