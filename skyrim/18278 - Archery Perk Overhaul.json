  "descriptionHtml": "Added a new version that reduces the maximum draw speed from 150% to 130%. Both files are available. Let me know which you prefer.\r\n\r\nLooking for some testers and some idea makers for my new mod which, basically, overhauls the \\\"overdraw\\\" perks. In my opinion, bows in Skyrim are very underpowered. Vanilla bows are, at best, a nuisance. In real life, a skilled archer using a Medieval English longbow (more-or-less equivalent in the game to the basic longbow) were able to kill a fully armored knight with one shot. Currently, to kill a heavily-armored target in the game you need to turn them into a pincushion. This doesn\\'t make sense from a historical standpoint.\r\n\r\nThis mod changes the way the \\\"overdraw\\\" perk works. Currently, it increases damage dealt by bows by 20% every rank up to a max of 200%. An archer with an overdraw at rank 5 should be more-or-less equivalent of the greatest archer ever to live. However, he or she still needs to pincushion any piddly little guard in order to kill them. My mod does three things to each overdraw rank:\r\n\r\n1.) SERIOUSLY bumps up the damage dealt (rank 1 is 2x, up to rank 5 at 10x)\r\n2.) Increases bow draw speed by 10% every rank.\r\n3.) Reduces target armor rating by 15% every rank.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n0.75 - Original version\r\n0.75b - Version with max draw speed reduced to 130%\r\n\r\nThe speed draw perk is still in place, so there is a possibilty of getting a max of 180% draw rate. I want to change this perk, but I am unsure as to what. This is what I would like some idea makers for.\r\n\r\nAlso, I know this is a major unbalancing of melee/magic/marksmanship, but honestly I don\\'t care. :D This mod was originally created for my own purposes, but after seeing there were very few good archery overhauls, I decided to let it out for beta testing.",
