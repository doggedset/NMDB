  "descriptionHtml": "==Update 3.1 =======================================================================\r\n*Fixed an over-sight that made civilians turn hostile to stage 4 vampires. Before, only guards did not turn hostile.\r\n===================================================================================\r\n\r\nFirstly, the feeding system has been reversed. The more you feed the more powerful you are. As you starve, you weaken.\r\n\r\n People will never attack you on sight, regardless of stage. You always have all vampire powers, regardless of stage.\r\n\r\n I also rebalanced how the sun affects vampires. At stage 1, you suffer -5 to all attributes. At stage 4, you suffer -40 to all attributes. Vampires will now always regenerate, even in sunlight. You suffer considerable regeneration reduction when exposed to the sun instead. \r\n\r\nAt night, vampires now have increased regeneration. They have this regeneration as long as it is night, even when they\\'re inside! \r\n\r\nVampires are now stealthier and have even stronger illusion spells.\r\n\r\nI\\'d also like to thank Bethesda for this awesome game! They were on skooma when they made the vampires though...",
