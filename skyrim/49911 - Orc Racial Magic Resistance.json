  "descriptionHtml": "I thought that Orcs needed a little bit of a boost. Compared to the other races they didn&#39;t have a lot going for them. In previous Elder Scrolls games they had a small resistance to magic, so I decided to add a 10% resistance to the race as a whole. \r<br />\r<br />This should be compatible with most mods, but I make no promises.",
