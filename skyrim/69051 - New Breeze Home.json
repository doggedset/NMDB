I am not able to get the time to mod thanks to life&#39;s new ventures. The mod itself is mostly complete expect for a few little minor bugs. Feel free to fix or make a mod with this. I only ask that please give credit were credit is due. Thanks.\r<br />\r<br />Requires:\r<br />\r<br />Hearthfires",
