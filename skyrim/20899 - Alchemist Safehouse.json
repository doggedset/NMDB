  "modName": "Alchemist Safehouse",
  "summary": "A small functional and aesthetically pleasing player-home located between Riverwood and Whiterun geared toward the \\\"Non-magic\\\" player. Alchemy station well made and all the necessary equipment to forge armor and weapons. Also, this home has no load zones.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I built this house for the character I\\'m playing now, an archer that uses no magic and relies on potions and poisons to heal and inflict extra damage. I wanted a simple home in a semi-private location... So I built a little meadow enclosed by mountain with a pretty waterfall and stream, near the large waterfalls near Whiterun. Included are armor racks, all of which should function properly, and containers labeled for crafting and alchemy use. I built a unique bed to fit the unique house it sits in. The view from this house is breathtaking and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did building it. I\\'ll be making small tweaks here and there and if any of you leave me a suggestion I\\'ll try to make it happen. I\\'m very new to the creation kit and this is my first mod. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nAlso there is a .esp with JUST the landscape I edited added to the game, incase you like the surroundings and the view but not the house (to each his own) OR if you would like to use this location to build your own house. It\\'s located in the optional files.\r\n\r\nINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS - \r\n\r\nMAKE A NEW SAVE WHEN USING THIS MOD!\r\n(This mod works fine for me but some others have experienced issues. Please use caution when using this, or any for that matter, modification to your game.)\r\n\r\nDrop the .esp into your skyrim directory (usually located in the steam folder) and make sure its checked in your skyrim data files when loading up. I hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nAlso, if someone will give me a quick tutorial of how to make a file available for \\\"Download using NMM\\\" that would be great. I just don\\'t know how to do it. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso check out my other mod, Dwarven Falls! http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21115/",
