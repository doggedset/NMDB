  "descriptionHtml": "(Colors and textures from face to body fixed)\r\nBETAv2 and FINAL are both good, Final has the more pale skin.\r\nIf you get the FINAL version you must make sure that you delete all the files from the data folder that come with the mod those will be called Follower Zerg (REMOVE THE ENTIRE FOLDER CALLED FOLLOWER ZERG) The new folder will go in that same place but it is different so all you need to do is follow the directories and delete those listed.\r\nNew and final Folder contains the Data folder with all the directories for the new and final Zerg...\r\nNeed help? Let me know. Also not sure if NMM can delete all those if you uninstal the Betav2 through there but its worth a shot.\r\n\r\nZERG\r\nTESV Vanilia friendly\r\nTough Breton Tank. \r\nMoody Follower\r\nWields a giant battle axe.\r\nNew- Character will lvl with you and can lvl up to lvl 100.\r\nFxed some color textures .\r\nCan be married.\r\nFollower speed is faster to keep up with you.\r\nEquiped with a 2handed Enchanted battle axe and the blades gear set.\r\n\r\nHe is found in the  (bannered mare) in whiterun, Hanging out by the bar.\r\n\r\nI have tested my mod out and just wanted to upload it for others to enjoy :)\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this follower or anything you can think of.\r\nEnjoy Zerg, Users are very welcome to upload there pics on here to show others how your Zerg looks on your settings :)\r\n                                (Colors and textures from face to body fixed)\r\n\r\nRecomended Mods for male characters and followers as listed,\r\nHigh Res Face Maps for Men by Geonox by Geonox http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4141\r\nMore Muscular Men texture normals by tigersan-wolverinehowlett http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4145\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease Read, For people who instal this mod and then take it off to update to a new version of it might lose items that he had on him Make sure to take all your inventory from Zerg before doing so..",
