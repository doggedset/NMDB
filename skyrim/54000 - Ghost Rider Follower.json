  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a unique follower to Skyrim, based on the Marvel character, Johnny Blaze, Ghost Rider, The Spirit Of Vengeance, The Rider&#33; \r<br />\r<br />This is for Male Only. \r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll find him outside Riverwood. He will level with the player and is a spellsword, he also uses fire spells and has his own perks. \r<br />\r<br />Furthermore, it adds an second set of armour and sword. \r<br />\r<br />*************************************************** \r<br />The Armour: \r<br />Based around the Dragonscale Cuirass, Son&#39;s Of Talos Gauntlets and Boots retextured with the black and silver scheme of Ghost Rider.The Skull is by newermind43 so big thank you to him. It&#39;s unenchanted, and can only be crafted under the leather section of the Sky Forge, and tempered as usual at the workbench. Stat-wise it&#39;s a little stronger than the mentioned armours. \r<br />Note the set is standalone, and not a replacer. Although it&#39;s based Ghost Rider of Marvel, i&#39;ve attempted to make it look more armor based, more in keeping with Skyrim. It&#39;s about as lore-friendly as you can get. \r<br />\r<br />The Weapon - Sword:\r<br />Based on the Daedric Sword it&#39;s enchanted with Fire, and can only be crafted under the daedric section of the Sky Forge, and tempered as usual at the sharpening wheel. Stat-wise it&#39;s a little stronger than Daedric Sword.\r<br />Note is is standalone, and not a replacer. \r<br />\r<br />************************************************** \r<br />Compatibility & Troubleshooting \r<br />\r<br />The armour should not conflict with anything else. \r<br />**************************************************\r<br />\r<br />Installation: \r<br />Simply extract the archive into the Skyrim folder, so the .esp, textures folder, and meshes folder all land into your skyrim/data directory. \r<br />Typically: \r<br />C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim \r<br />\r<br />C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim",
