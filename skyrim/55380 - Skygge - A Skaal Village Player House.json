  "summary": "A very simple lore and family friendly house. Needs Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions to move family.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Please note that this requires both Dragonborn and Hearthfire. It is the first house on the right when entering the village from the main path.\r<br />\r<br />I wanted a simple house in the Skaal Village, but most that I saw either were not compatible with your hearthfire family, or had waaaaaaay too much stuff to the point that the house was more of a mini manor. \r<br />\r<br />This house is very simplistic but not bare-bones by any means. There are no crafting stations and there never will be (ok, maybe I can be bothered to put in an alchemy station, but that&#39;s it) There are some decorations but not a ton, I may add slightly more over time but not many. No, there are no mannequins nor weapon racks and displays. This is not an uber house with every shiny knick-knack under the sun :p\r<br />\r<br />What the house does have is a complete cooking and dining area (with Hearthfire oven), decent amounts of storage, two bookshelves, and room for your family (requires Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions in order to move family in). There are two children&#39;s bedrooms, one on each floor, with plenty of sandbox markers for the kids (and dog). I commandeered the small garden and goat pen in the lee of the house, mildly expanding both as well as adding 3 chickens. If you follow the small path out of the village and down to the water you will also find a small launch and fishing boat.\r<br />\r<br />Changes\r<br />\r<br />2 - Windows added to upstairs bedrooms. Minor decoration updates. Garden is now a plantable version.\r<br />\r<br />Saieden Mods:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51626/?/] Alternate Heljarchen Kitchen Wing [/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51619/?/] Hearthfire Coffin Cubby [/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51571/?/] Simple Hearthfire Attics [/url]\r<br />[color=#00FF00][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56972/?] Craftable Dawnguard Vampire Jewelry [/url][/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF00][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55380/?] Skygge - A Skaal Village Player House [/url][/color]",
