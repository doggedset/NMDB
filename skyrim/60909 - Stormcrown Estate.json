There&#39;s no quest or dungeon required to gain access to the house however there is a tunnel leading from the house to Whiterun and to gain access to that you&#39;ll have to clear a small mini-dungeon - and it&#39;s no walk in the park, either&#33; No milk drinker is going to beat it lemme tell ya. You&#39;re gonna have to bring your A game. But, it&#39;s not frivolous - clearing the mini-dungeon will also grant you passage through a tunnel leading from your house directly to Whiterun. If you&#39;re having trouble with the mini-dungeon see the hints.txt included with the download, but at least try first&#33; More fun that way. You&#39;ll have to fight level 50&#39;s and a level 80 boss.\r<br />\r<br />As an added bonus to gaining passage between your house and Whiterun you&#39;ll also gain a unique Dragon language to Mortal language translation book (Dovahzul wah Joorzul) that details not only the complete dragon alphabet but also all commonly known words, for easy in-game reference. Take it with you on your adventures and you can translate word walls as you come across them&#33; There&#39;s a log book included to get you started on practicing your Dovahzul translations.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/60915-1-1419064665.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />That said, I can&#39;t just give it to you with no challenge whatsoever, now can I? You can find the key somewhere outside the house. Just have a good look around and think to yourself where you might hide a key - it&#39;ll come to you. And well, if you&#39;re left completely stumped then you can always get in the hard way, through the tunnel. If you go that route you&#39;ll find the key to the house itself in the key holder to the right of your desk - not the same as the key to the tunnel.\r<br />\r<br />Fully set up and tested for adoption and marriage. Fully navmeshed. Includes all crafting and cooking stations, all very easily accessible. Mannequins. Display cases. Weapon plaques. Beautiful paintings. Everything a custom blue - rugs, display cases, a custom Dovahkiin banner, beds (with real pillows), and so on. Lots of storage to easily organize your stuff but not too much or too complex. Central game location, easy to get to. Houses up to 6 children, 1 spouse, and 5+1 followers (the +1 is a vampire). If you need more then you&#39;re crazy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]BnypXcnhTuk[/youtube][youtube]NILOXVN8ApQ[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#5ea2e5][size=5]Description:[/size][/color]\r<br />This house is all about convenience. As soon as you step inside you&#39;re presented with weapon racks on either side of the door as well as mannequins directly in front of you for some quick outfit or weapon swapping for the people that prefer a bit more roleplaying.\r<br />\r<br />There are, of course, 3 more mannequins in your immediate view as well as two very prominent display cases for something like daggers, and two larger display cases for larger weapons. On the walls there are two full shield/weapon plaques as well as 6 weapon plaques - and all of this is right inside the door. Oh and over to the right in each of the corners there are shrines to all the gods&#33;\r<br />\r<br />A few steps further in the door and you have your entire crafting needs completely fulfilled. There is a complete smithing setup complete with a ton of organized storage and a pretty cleverly minimal smelter built right into the fire pit.\r<br />\r<br />Around on the other side of the fire pit you have your cooking setup with a small flashy little dwemer oven with a cooking pot on top, all working seamlessly with the existing fire pit. There&#39;s plenty of storage for your ales, meads, and wines directly next to your cooking setup as well.\r<br />\r<br />Beyond that we have a table completely setup and locked in place so no matter how crazy it gets in your home you won&#39;t have plates flying all over the place. I did however leave the food choice to you - you&#39;ll have to set your own plates. I&#39;m sure some of the roleplayers out there will prefer that.\r<br />\r<br />And to finish up your crafting needs - still in the first room you walked into, mind you, we have all of your enchanting and alchemy needs at the far end of the room with some nicely organized storage for each. In addition to that, on your left you have a staff workbench along with storage for your staves and your heartstones. On top of that, there&#39;s even a Font of Renewal for when you mess up and just want to start over - it&#39;ll completely undo any enchantments or improvements done to an item. If you guys recall when I originally released this mod I wanted to include a disenchanting font which did the same thing but I was unable to get permission to release that... so as of version 3 I scripted my own&#33; Enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />This place could not be more convenient. I made it for myself. Did I mention it was beautiful? When you step in the door you&#39;ll probably notice the classical paintings on the wall, largely of Venus or Sirens. Of course, it already looked pretty awesome before you ever stepped inside, what with those Dovahkiin banners outside and the dragon skull right above your door. Below the paintings there are planters and there are 48, I repeat [b]48[/b] plots of fertile soil. If you think you need more then you probably need to consider what kind of milk drinker your dovahkiin is and get back to killing dragons&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Your follower, if you happen to have one, has the first room on the left and although a small room, will basically be living in the life of luxury. They have everything they could need: Their very own mannequin, a weapon rack, a training dummy, a wardrobe, a bed, a chest, along with a chair and a night table with a lamp so they can read comfortably. They also happen to have a golden bed pan. Yeah. You&#39;ll likely need something like [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045]My Home Is Your Home[/url] to get your follower to move in. As of version 2.0 the house now supports 4 additional followers in the new Follower&#39;s Quarters located beneath the Follower&#39;s Room. Also supports an additional vampire follower with a vampire coffin in the Sinister Room.\r<br />\r<br />In the second room to the left you have the room where your children, if you happen to have any, will be staying. They have everything they need with beds, dressers, wardrobes, chests, golden candles, and golden bed pans. They don&#39;t have dolls or anything like that but let&#39;s be serious... just what kind of milk drinkers are you raising if you&#39;re buying them that stuff?&#33; Raise a proper Nord child&#33; Just give &#39;em a big ol axe and send them out hunting. Adoption fully works, by the way. You&#39;ll need [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249]Hearthfire multiple adoptions[/url] mod for it [s]and there&#39;s only room for two kids[/s], but this house totally supports adoption&#33; As of version 2.0 the house now supports adoption of 6 children with the addition of a Children&#39;s Quarters beneath the Children&#39;s Room.\r<br />\r<br />I haven&#39;t forgotten about you, of course. Oh no... you&#39;re living the most luxurious life of all. You&#39;re in the room on the far right complete with banners, a dragon skull mounted on the wall, more beautiful paintings than you can shake a stick at, and desk that has everything you could need. You sit at the desk and you do so in your throne, because why should you be sitting in some crappy uncomfortable chair anyways? And from there you have access to custom storage for your journals, notes, books, scrolls, coin purses, keys, a strongbox, and a floor safe. There&#39;s also a reading chair nearby if you happen to want to sit under a lamp to read your favorite book. In front of the desk there&#39;s a big map of Skyrim so you can plan your next adventure while you&#39;re organizing all of your things.\r<br />\r<br />Of course, you have other things too... don&#39;t you? You know, things you wouldn&#39;t necessarily want anyone else to be around. Well, there&#39;s a room for that too&#33; Find it and you have a room for pretty much every daedric artifact, elder scroll, dragon priest mask, dragon claw, paragon, and thieves guild treasures. [s]It&#39;s automatically placed on their displays for you as well - just use the big treasures safe right when you walk in.[/s] As of version 3, just use the displays directly. Hovering over a blank area will tell you what item goes there and activating it will automatically place it on display. If you look around carefully enough you&#39;ll find a secret room - a Dark Brotherhood style torture room for the more sinister players.\r<br />\r<br />Well, now that you&#39;ve found this room... you&#39;ll surely see the trap door leading down to the Whiterun Tunnels. What are the Whiterun Tunnels you may ask? Well, it&#39;s exactly what you&#39;ve always wanted, that&#39;s what&#33; It&#39;s a tunnel leading directly to Whiterun. You found some old ancient nord tunnel leading beneath your home all the way to Whiterun with an exit built right under the bridge under the main gate. Except, when you enter this way it can be all hush-hush without any witnesses, and all that.\r<br />\r<br />The thing of it is... you didn&#39;t build this tunnel. You just finished building your house (or maybe it was a gift from the gods?), and this tunnel just up and appears in your basement... more than that, it&#39;s locked&#33; What kind of sissy Dragonborn would just stand for something like that? And in your own home no less&#33; You&#39;d better go check it out.\r<br />\r<br />Whatever&#39;s in there you shouldn&#39;t have to worry about anymore once you wipe it out as both ends of the tunnel are sealed off. On the bright side, once you deal with whatever it is you&#39;ll have a nice tunnel connecting your house directly to Whiterun&#33; You&#39;re not going to break your nose running into a wall in the pitch dark, either, because it&#39;s well lit with torches all along the way.\r<br />\r<br />What else? Location location location. Your home is in the center of Skyrim and just a brisk walk away from the Whiterun Stables which means you could be anywhere in a snap&#33; (followed by a long boring ride in a wagon, but hey who&#39;s keeping track&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />I built this home for myself. I sat down and I thought &#34;What exactly do I want in a home?&#34; I knew of course that I wanted all of the crafting facilities and what have you but some houses go overboard with things and you end up spending more time putting each ingredient you have in separate jars or each book in the proper section than you do playing the game. This is a lot more simplified. Everything is compact, it&#39;s a really small house even though it will probably feel pretty big, but its smallness gives the added benefit of everything you want being only a few steps away. Building with a finite amount of space also kept my expansion craze in check. Can&#39;t very well go adding 10 extra rooms for this-and-that when you&#39;re pretty much locked in to the original building plan. But, that just lead to better decorations and a more homey feeling place in the end.\r<br />\r<br />The downside is... you&#39;re going to need all the DLC&#39;s to meet the requirements for this place: HearthFires, Dragonborn, and Dawnguard. I had to use them so it can&#39;t really be helped. [s]I also used a resource called General Displays for the entirety of the treasure room so you&#39;ll need that entire suite: GeneralDisplays, General Displays - DG, General Displays - DB. But, it&#39;s not as bad as it sounds. You pretty much need the DLC&#39;s and one extra mod to get it to work.[/s] So, that&#39;s all you&#39;ll need. General Displays was completely removed as of version 3.0 with my own display system added.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#5ea2e5][size=5]How to acquire it:[/size][/color]\r<br />So you didn&#39;t read anything else up to this point, eh? That&#39;s a bold strategy, Cotton. The house is just across the road from the Whiterun Stables, can&#39;t miss it. Look around outside the house for the key. Go into the Whiterun Tunnels under the bridge at Whiterun&#39;s gate to find the key connecting the tunnels to your house.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#5ea2e5][size=5]Required:[/size][/color]\r<br />Skyrim 1.9.whatever\r<br />[color=red](Required)[/color] Dawnguard DLC\r<br />[color=red](Required)[/color] HearthFires DLC\r<br />[color=red](Required)[/color] Dragonborn DLC\r<br />[color=gray](No longer required as of version 3.0)[/color] [s][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32550]General Displays[/url] with GeneralDisplays.esm, GeneralDisplays - DG.esm, and GeneralDisplays - DB.esm[/s]\r<br />(optional) [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249]Hearthfire multiple adoptions[/url] - only required if you want adoptions to work and your spouse to be able to move in.\r<br />(optional) [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045]My Home Is Your Home[/url] - only required to get your follower to move in; other mods that do similar should work as well.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#5ea2e5][size=5]Displayed items include:[/size][/color]\r<br />All dragon priest masks\r<br />All dragon claws\r<br />3 elder scrolls\r<br />Helm of Yngol (goes into Daedric artifact display)\r<br />Grey Fox Bust (goes into Sinister room on desk)\r<br />Statue of Dibella\r<br />Crown of Barenziah\r<br />All thieves guild treasures\r<br />All paragons\r<br />All Daedric artifacts\r<br />All black books\r<br />All Gauldur stuff\r<br />Auriel&#39;s bow & shield\r<br />All divine amulets\r<br />Ysgramor&#39;s shield and Wuuthrad\r<br />All bugs in jars (Bee, Butterfly, Dragonfly, Torchbug, Moth) - located at alchemy table\r<br />\r<br />If you just want all the display items without having to earn them you can grab the bat file in optional files and put it in the directory that your TESV.exe is located (not your Data folder) then in-game type &#34;bat all-display-items&#34; and it&#39;ll add them all to your inventory. You may need to adjust the load order on some of the items as my setup uses all of the Unofficial patches in the correct order.\r<br />\r<br />Note: There&#39;s a display case in the Sinister Room for your Blade of Woe but you&#39;ll have to put it there yourself rather than just tossing it in the Treasures chest.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#5ea2e5][size=5]Credits:[/size][/color]\r<br />tueffelachtein - General Displays mod which as of 3.0 I&#39;m not using except as a mesh resource\r<br />gentester - pillows\r<br />Blary - bookset, enchanting wall art, open books, ingredients in jars resource, racks, key holder\r<br />Oaristys and Tony67 - Modders Resource Pack\r<br />eldiabs - mannequins, weapon racks, display cases, etc pre-set up\r<br />various amazing classical artists - the beautiful paintings adorning the walls\r<br />Artisanix - the picture frames\r<br />(myself) - realistic wooden mannequins - used in screenshots\r<br />raiserfx - detailed rugs (base for the blue rug - all I changed was all the vertex coloring)\r<br />Thuum.org - dragon alphabet font and translations\r<br />Dovah Zul Wiki - further translations\r<br />Elianora - soul gem chest\r<br />Darkfox127 - light toggle script, and his many tutorial videos of which I&#39;d be completely lost in the CK without\r<br />\r<br />[color=#5ea2e5][size=5]FAQ:[/size][/color]\r<br />Q: Is the place I found the key outside the house safe storage?\r<br />A: No, it will respawn. I don&#39;t advise storing anything there.\r<br />\r<br />Q: WHAT THE HELL, WOMAN... ARE YOU CRAZY? HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO BEAT [i]THAT[/i]?&#33;\r<br />A: Oh come on, don&#39;t be such a milk drinker. See the hints.txt included in the mod&#39;s archive when you give up.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I can&#39;t find this stupid key... are you SURE it&#39;s there?\r<br />A: Yes.\r<br />\r<br />Q: No really, I can&#39;t find it. I think you&#39;re lying.\r<br />A: Fine, don&#39;t believe me. Go through the tunnel instead. Once you manage to get into your house that way you can find an extra copy in your key holder on the wall next to your desk.\r<br />\r<br />Q: What the heck, man. These mannequins are walking around, eh&#33;\r<br />A: Vanilla bug. Search the internet, there&#39;s a fix out there for it.\r<br />\r<br />Q: There&#39;s random invisible walls all over the place that kinda nudge me around sometimes...\r<br />A: Has to do with the above vanilla mannequin bug. Again, nothing to do with this mod and can be fixed.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I think I found some missing meshes / textures...\r<br />A: Please report it to me and I&#39;ll fix it right away. Packing everything up can miss things sometimes.\r<br />\r<br />Q: But I wanted a disenchanting font...\r<br />A: [s]And I wanted you to have one&#33; Alas, the author of the script said no and that&#39;s that. Such is the life of mod permissions.[/s] As of version 3.0 there [i]is[/i] one&#33; It&#39;s called Font of Renewal, right next to the enchanting station.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Where did you get those mannequins in your screenshots?\r<br />A: My [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60766]Realistic Wooden Mannequins[/url] mod.\r<br />\r<br />Q: What outfit are you wearing in your screenshots?\r<br />A: It&#39;s a combination of several outfits. The hood is from Hunting Grounds, the main body is from Neo&#39;s Selene, along with the boots, and the gloves are from Lustmord.\r<br />\r<br />Q: What do those banners say?\r<br />A: Well the large icon is the Akaviri symbol for Dragonborn. The text itself is Dovahzul and reads Dovahkiin, or Dragonborn.\r<br />\r<br />Q: What does the log book say? I&#39;m too lazy to translate it.\r<br />A: It&#39;s basically a dated journal that talks about the tunnel collapsing, some building notes, and that she could feel the return of Alduin and a Dragonborn awakening. But more than that she felt that their paths must cross soon, and that your opponent awaits.\r<br />\r<br />Q: My thieves guild treasures look like they&#39;re floating... what&#39;s up with that?\r<br />A: Unfortunately if you started your game with a version of this mod prior to their being moved the original positions will have been baked into your save despite the shelves themselves retaining their new positions. The easiest solution is to just start a new game. You could try entering an interior cell and typing pcb into console then waiting 30 days and seeing if that fixes it but there&#39;s no promises there. It pretty much sucks.\r<br />\r<br />Q: My &#34;Treasures&#34; safe does nothing when I try to open it... what gives?\r<br />A: [s]That&#39;s... a bug with the General Displays mod. I wish it wasn&#39;t, but it happens to some people. The only solution that is known involves the following procedure: 1) Remove all your items to a safe place from all your homes that use General Displays. 2) Uncheck General Displays and the affected house mods from your load order. 3) Go in-game and click okay to loading with missing stuff and make a new save. 3) Re-enable General Displays and the house mods. 4) Go in-game, it should work now... hopefully.[/s] What Treasures safe? Update to 3.0 or greater&#33; I completely removed the dependency to General Displays and scripted my very own display system.\r<br />\r<br />Q: What ENB are you using in your screenshots?\r<br />A: Most now are using Grim and Somber Hircine on Extreme Quality but a few are using an edited version of Natural Lighting and Atmospherics. Some of the newer ones are also using Grim and Somber Sanguine Extreme Quality.",
