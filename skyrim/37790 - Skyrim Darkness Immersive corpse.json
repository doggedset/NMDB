  "descriptionHtml": "Why :\r<br />-Skyrim is a cold and harsh land.\r<br />-Immersion\r<br />-Because\r<br />\r<br />But why ? :\r<br />-With frostfall I can die of cold , so why not have others who did so\r<br />-there talk of racism and rejection in skyrim but nothing to show for it. with the mod you will find left overs of victims , sometimes its easy to work out what happened other times not so much. however there is allways a plot behind what happened.\r<br />\r<br />But... dead kids :\r<br />Yeah kids can die , its true... and in ye old days kids died all the time , from bandits to darker figures so imagine in a world were trolls , monsters and other horros are real imagine how much death would happen. (you could be playing outside in cyrodiil and *BAM* oblivion gate &#33;)\r<br />Credits :\r<br />I made the mod but BloodrendX001 help me a lot here. he corrected all my spelling errors (damned dyslexia ) and maid them more better to read. (give him some kudos please)\r<br />\r<br />So whats in the mod ? :\r<br />Data , lots of 0s and 1s.\r<br />\r<br />What content does the mod add to skyrim :\r<br />oh , dead corpes were you can either ignore them or work out what happened (no scripts just your own deduction)\r<br />\r<br />Your sick &#33; :\r<br />I feel fine....",
