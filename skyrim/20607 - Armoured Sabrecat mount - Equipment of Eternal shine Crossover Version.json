  "descriptionHtml": "-----------------\r\n----Basics:----\r\n-----------------\r\nThis mod enables the glows from Equipment of Eternal shine: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17582 to be seen on the Armoured Sabrecat Mount. \r\nThis mod uses the EoES replacer version with glows so your Sabrecat Mount equipment will be retextured with glows added in the main complete version of this mod (see blow for more info on versions)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n----Installation:----\r\n------------------------\r\nNMM\r\n...Select the appropriate version that you want (see below) and click \\'download with manager\\'\r\n...double click in NMM once it has downloaded to activate\r\n\r\nManual\r\n...Click download manually\r\n...Extract to Skyrim directory > Data (meshes go in meshes, textures go in textures, and .esp files go straight into the Skyrim directory > Data folder NOT Skyrim directory > Data > Data)\r\n...Make sure the .esp files are activated/loaded. (I use NMM to do this) \r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n----Version:----\r\n-------------------\r\n...Version 1.0 complete contains the entire set (BOTH Armored Sabrecat Mount and the EoES replacer version with glows - will replace elven gear textures and add glows including on the mount)\r\n\r\n...Version 1.0 GLOWS ONLY contains Armoured Sabrecat Mount and only the glows from EoES (this means the glows will be added from EoES but you can add your own retexture of elven weapons and armour) note: this may look weird\r\n\r\n...Version 1.0 Update edition (use this IF you have BOTH Armored Sabrecat AND EoES replacer version with glows already installed) this version just replaces the Sabrecat meshe so the glows you already have installed will work. Again THIS IS ONLY IF YOU HAVE BOTH MODS ALREADY INSTALLED\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n----Permissions:----\r\n-------------------------\r\nTo modify these files You have my full permission, but that is not enough. You MUST also gain permission from TumbaJamba AND lKocMoHaBTl first.\r\n\r\nYou obviously can change these mods as much as you want offline, but if you wish to upload your \\'new\\' mod you must first get permission from those specified above.\r\n\r\nEditing permissions of this mod have been granted to the 2 specified modders.\r\n\r\nPlease don\\'t hesitate to contact me if you find something wrong.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n----Disclaimer/Credits:----\r\n----------------------------------\r\nI DO NOT OWN:\r\nTumbajamba\\'s Armored Sabrecat Mount\r\nlKocMoHaBTl\\'s Textures, meshes, OR Glowmaps\r\n\r\nAnd therefore Thank you Bethesda for skyrim, Renegadeof79 for his tutorial, Tumbajamba for his Mount, and Thank you to lKocMoHaBTl for his Awesome retextures and Glowmaps. Also a huge thanks to the folks over at the nifskope team.",
