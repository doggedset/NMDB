  "descriptionHtml": "Some of you guys may have seen Bionicle in Skyrim, but what about LEGO (that company that betrayed the hearts of many bionicle fans but they did a good thing and released a reboot of bionicle)? I checked the steam workshop for LEGO ♥♥♥♥ and guess what&#33; NOTHING, no nerd on the steam workshop gave a skooma about LEGO in skyrim. So i did something epic by making this small thing. Now... How in Oblivion are you going to get this small, uncommon, plastic LEGO sword? well go to the forge, any forge. You will need to have the steel smithing skill, 6 steel ingots, 250 gold (don&#39;t ask why, LEGO&#39;s recipes for forging lego weapons costs SHINY CLINKY GOLD&#33;) and 10 Dwarven oil and poof, you made a LEGO sword for your Redguard, Orc, Nord, etc. \r<br />Now why does this require 10 dwarven oil? Well you see, LEGO is actually made of plastic and plastic is made of oil... Don&#39;t believe me? Look it up, it&#39;s true \r<br />Why is this sword so short? I don&#39;t know... \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />SERIOUSLY WHO THE BLOODY HELL WOULD USE THIS PLASTIC PIECE OF POOP?&#33;?&#33;??&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Credits goes to [url=https://grabcad.com/library/lego-original-sword]Ryan at GRABCAD[/url] for making this model\r<br />\r<br />Please like this, it doesn&#39;t deserve dislikes. \r<br />Emmet approves...
