  "descriptionHtml": "     I made a mod like this in Oblivion that only made an improved Nord. Got a little crazy with it in Skyrim and made one for each playable race and decided to share.\r\n\r\n     Essentially I copied each race and then made it slightly bigger.  I then bumped all of their core skills(the ones that they have bonuses for) up to 100, bumped base Health, Magicka, and Stamina up to 5,050, bumped Health, Magicka, and Stamina regeneration up to 100(originally .7, 3, and 5), bumped base carry weight up to 30,000, allowed each of them to fight in water and on horses, and allowed health regeneration for them in combat. Oh and you can\\'t be pushed.\r\n\r\n     Yes I know a lot of you won\\'t like this but that\\'s okay. I\\'m fine with bad feedback as well as good. It adds to the variety in life. So bring all your comments. The good. The bad. And everything in between. Or don\\'t comment if you really want to be one of those guys. :P",
