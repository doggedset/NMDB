  "descriptionHtml": "This is a compatibility-Patch for Lanterns of Skyrim - All In One 2.5 (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18916) and Skyrim Bridges 2.1.2 (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38158).\r<br />\r<br />Some of the bridges from the excellent MOD Skyrim Bridges are very huge so the lanterns from Lanterns of Skyrim clip through them.\r<br />Some of them even disappear completly in the bridges brickwall, so there comes strange light from inside the bridge at night...\r<br />\r<br />This patch moves some of the Lanterns (and their lightsource) in better place so they doesn&#39;t clipped anymore.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve also take care the replaced lanterns don&#39;t conflict with MODs Weathered Road Signs 1.5 and Convenient Bridges ALPHA 1.8 (which I also \r<br />use in my skyrim-game). \r<br />\r<br />Place the esp-plugin everywhere behind &#34;Lanterns Of Skyrim - All In One - Main.esm&#34; in your loadorder. The loadorder of Skyrim Bridges.esp doesn&#39;t matter.\r<br />\r<br />changelog:\r<br />v1.0: replaces lanterns at the big bridges at Whiterun, Windhelm, Riften\r<br />v1.1: replaces lanterns at the bridge at Blind Cliff Cave (near Markarth)\r<br />v1.2: replaces lanterns at the bridges at Fort Amol, Redorans Retreat, Robber Gorge, Karthspire (near Markarth)\r<br />v1.3: replaces lanterns at the bridges at Old Hroldan, Reachwater Rock\r<br />         replaces two lanterns that clipped with roadsigns from MOD Weathered Road Signs 1.5 (all roadsigns from this MOD now checked)\r<br />v1.4: replaces lanterns at the bridge at Morthal and minor replacements at three other bridges; this patch should now be final (for Version 2.1.2 of Skyrim Bridges)\r<br /> ",
