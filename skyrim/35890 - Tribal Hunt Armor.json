  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe Tribal Hunt armor is often worn by the best female hunters throughout various Forsworn regions in Skyrim, but only when they are on a social/tribal hunt.  The armor is meant to be as minimal as possible so as to fit the original idea of a hunter who lives in the woods.  which is why it only includes the armor itself and a necklace/amulet.  No boots or gloves here.  I also don\\'t equip anything other than the armor and amulet when I play.  Barefoot all the way!  But for those of you that may worry about lack of armor protection, the amulet is really really overpowered.  I think I gave it a base armor rating of 125.  Enjoy!\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE\r\n\r\n- Craft the armor under \\\"Hide\\\" category at a forge.\r\n- Craft the necklace under \\\"Jewlery\\\" category at a forge.\r\n\r\nOr type \\\"help tribal\\\" into the console.\r\n\r\nINSTALL\r\n\r\nCopy contents to your Skyrim\\\\Data directory and activate the esp file.\r\n\r\nBUGS/ISSUES\r\n\r\n- There are no technical bugs in the armor at it\\'s current state other than the fact that the UVW maps for the bottom portion of the armor is really messed up, but you can\\'t really tell all that much.\r\n\r\n- If you take the armor down to 20 percent weight or less, you may experience slight clipping in the back of the armor top.\r\n\r\nCHANGE LOG\r\n\r\n- Version 1.1 (5/14/2013 )\r\n\r\n1) Weight slider support in-game!\r\n2) Now has custom ground/world object.\r\n\r\n\r\n- 1.0 Initial Release\r\n\r\n\r\nFUTURE PLANS\r\n\r\n- There will be small decoration addon\\'s to the armor.  A small dagger to fit between the leg strap and the thigh, for instance.\r\n\r\n- The armor is made to a custom Caliente Bodyslide Preset I did and it may not be for everyone, which is why there will definitely be a regular CBBE version at the very least.  I\\'ll leave other versions to the modding community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Have at it!",
