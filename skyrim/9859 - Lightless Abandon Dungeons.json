  "modName": "Lightless Abandon Dungeons",
  "summary": "This mod actually turns off most of the abandon dungeon lights. Get those torches and lightspells ready because you will likely not survive without them.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod converts all the lighted candles, fires, and most deep dwemer dungeon lamps off. This will make the dungeons much darker so carry torches, spells or whatever to light your way.\r\n\r\nThings to in mind:\r\nFalmer will still detect you.\r\nUndead will detect you.\r\nDwemer machines will detect you.\r\nThis does break a bit of lore b/c Drugar typically do keep those crypts lit. However not all drugar crypts are completely dark.\r\n\r\nGood additions to this mod are:\r\nSounds of Skyrim\r\nDarker Dungeons\r\nRings of Light Enchantment\r\n\r\nKnown issues;\r\nThere were some popping light issues that have been fixed. I will be keeping an eye on comments and continue to update my files as I see issues arise.",
