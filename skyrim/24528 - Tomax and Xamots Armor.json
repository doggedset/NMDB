  "descriptionHtml": "Just a simple and silly mod I made in a morning, teaching myself how to retexture armor.\r\n\r\nI modified the regular DB armor and made two sets: one for my character Tomax, and one for his twin brother Xamot (I used BravoOskar\\'s fabulous NPC creation tutorial to make my twin clone).  They\\'re just the cuirasses (I use the regular DB gloves and boots) and they\\'re unenchanted because I prefer to use my own enchantments.  I should also mention that they\\'re standalone, and won\\'t retexture the existing DB members\\' armors.\r\n\r\nMale only, since, well, Tomax and Xamot are both male (wearing Tomax or Xamot\\'s armor as a female will just show the regular DB armor).\r\n\r\nSimply extract the contents of the .zip file to your Skyrim\\\\Data directory.\r\n\r\nRef IDs:\r\nTomax\\'s armor:  XX000D62\r\nXamot\\'s armor:  XX000D63\r\n(where XX is your mod load order)\r\n\r\nAgain, this was a quick and dirty retex for my personal use.  There are issues with it, but I probably won\\'t fix them.  Feel free to do so yourself.  \r\n\r\nIn other [more official] words, you are free to use this \\\"mod\\\" (and I use the term loosely) for whatever you\\'d like (oh, but please don\\'t upload it to the Steam Workshop.  They suck).\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for Skyrim and to Hasbro for G.I. Joe  :-)\r\nAnd thanks to BravoOskar for his NPC tutorial (you can find it here on the Nexus).",
