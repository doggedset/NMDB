  "descriptionHtml": "The File includes: Original C4D File wich is best for further work on it, and some variations of .obj files for work in Blender or similar software able to read .obj files\r\n\r\nI modelled this Shoes because there are no proper Platform High Heels available for Skyrim right now. The inspiration, the idea for this Modell comes from Apachii and her famous Apachii Goddes Store in Oblivion where similar High Heels are available. Thanks to Apachii for her Design and her permission to upload my work here on Nexus.\r\n\r\nIÂ´m only a \\\"Mid-Class-Modeller\\\" and have no clue how to get such models to work in a game. The Idea is that someone could use the Model to work on it and bring it to the game. \r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nUploaded a Folder with a \\\"Reduced Version\\\" the Polygoncount is much lower and it includes .obj Files to open it in Blender or Lightwave i.e. Readme and Screenshots are inside the Folder.",
