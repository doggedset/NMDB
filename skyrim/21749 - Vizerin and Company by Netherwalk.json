Of all his friends and peers he came to Skyrim with he is but the last one left. On orders of the Thalmor he has been reassigned to Understone keep in Markarth. Upon meeting the dragonborn Vizerin has secretly aided him knowing he will put an end to the war one way or another.\r\n\r\nLocation - Read his bio that\\'s enough of a clue. besides he\\'s your friend already you should know where he is right lol.\r\n\r\nNareus\r\nBio - A snow elf spellsword. After Vizerin discovered Nareus he chose to use his influence with the Thalmor to hide what could be the last snow elf left in Skyrim.

Nareus sees this as a chance to possibly see others of his kind.\r\n\r\nLocation - The clue is in the bio! \r\n****IMPORTANT**** Nareus will not equip any armor but the ancient falmer armor.
