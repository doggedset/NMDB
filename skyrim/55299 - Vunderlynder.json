  "descriptionHtml": "Vunderlynder was built many years ago by the Dragon Priests to serve as a self contained facility for the dispensation of justice. It housed a court, prison, torture rooms and catacombs, and the High Judge assigned there dispensed justice with a level hand. However, for reasons known by none, Vunderlynder was destroyed, its entrance collapsed and its location struck from maps. Why ? Could the only information about its location be hidden in a dusty book from an obscure monastery ? What of Vunderlynders vast halls ? Do they still exist ? And its relics ?\r<br />\r<br />This dungeon has six areas, a number of voiced conversations, challenging puzzles and unique items. The quest takes about three hours and is started during a conversation with a monk in the Morthal Moorside Inn. Please use version 3.0 - the file size is much smaller for download.",
