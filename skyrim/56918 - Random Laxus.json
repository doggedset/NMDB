For some reason when I placed him in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun I couldn&#39;t find him anywhere. So I tried putting him in the Drunken Huntsman with the same results. So I just gave up and left the mod alone, but forgot to remove it from my load order. Imagine my surprise when I found him wandering around Morthal&#33; \r<br />\r<br />So far I have found him in Morthal, in the Bannered Mare, and the Whiterun Stables. Considering I&#39;ve seen him in the inn in Morthal and the inn in Whiterun, my best guess is that he is inn hopping around skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />You can just pretend he&#39;s already been kicked out of Fairy Tail and is wandering skyrim in shame. \r<br />He still makes snide comments though.\r<br />\r<br />When installing, I honestly do not know where he will spawn.
