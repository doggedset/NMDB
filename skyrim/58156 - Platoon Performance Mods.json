They will come back when you disable my mods.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][i][b]note:[/b][/i][/color] \r<br />This mod doesn&#39;t remove grass it removes foliage in Skyrim they are not counted as &#34;grass&#34; there is difference between that&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][i]note:[/i][/color] \r<br />some foliage not removed because some referance&#39;s using those, I didnt remove them so it won&#39;t hurt your game. they will be visible tho.. \r<br />don&#39;t worry, still removed foliage a lot of bigger then them.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4][b][i]Remove tree[/i][/b][/size][/color]   \r<br />   this will give noticeable performance boost but costs wasteland feeling, there is not much to tell..\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4][b][i]Remove light effects   [/i][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />   this will give slightly more performance \r<br />did you know how many lights rendered moving and flickering around?&#33; \r<br />exactly&#33; \r<br />I dont have any idea too, but im sure it gives more frame rate :D\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#00ff00][size=5]   I N S T A L L[/size][/color][/b] \r<br />put esp files inside your &#34;skyrim/data&#34; folder and activate them in launcher.. you can activate them in any order..\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][b][size=5]   U N I N S T A L L[/size][/b] [/color]  \r<br />delete or deactivate esp files :(  don&#39;t worry your save files safe\r<br />\r<br />[i][b][color=#6fa8dc]other notes:[/color][/b][/i]\r<br />my computer spec: intel pentium dual cpu e2180 2.0GHz  ati x1550  2GB RAM win7 32bit\r<br />\r<br />didn&#39;t tried with lush trees mod, it could give some problems but if you are trying this mod, you should know lush trees for high end computers",
