  "descriptionHtml": "This is a mod I was making on the side but have not come back to in many moons, I am working on a much bigger project now and won't have time to work any more on this. It simply adds new buildings and a walkway from Knifepoint ridge to lake Illinalta, my attempt at industrializing Skyrim.\n<br />I used it as a base for Guild starter as a bit of a way to have fun improving and defending the mine, now its up for everyone to fool around with, mod it, share your version, or just use for a base tundra defense or other such mods.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This does not conflict with Holds, but does conflict with North Keep town added by Legendary Cities (walkway clips through roofs)\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to use as you wish, credit would be appreciated.",
