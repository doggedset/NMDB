  "descriptionHtml": "Essential followers plugins for Skyrim\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n28.11.11\r\nBy JPro6\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: This mod does not currently work for Brelyna Maryon or Onmund, I\\'m not sure why as it does set the essential flag in their NPC records (which works for the other followers). I will look into this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT\r\n\r\nThis mod makes your followers essential so they can\\'t be killed.\r\n\r\nIn the folder \\\"Essential followers - all followers\\\" you will find an ESP file which makes every follower essential at once.\r\n\r\nIn the folder \\\"Essential followers - individual followers\\\" you will find a seperate ESP file for every follower. Each file makes that follower essential, so you can use just one or any combination. (Cicero, Erandur and Mjoll are not included as they are already essential characters).\r\n\r\nThe mod includes the dogs Vigilance and Meeko\r\n\r\nNOTE: The quest \\\"Boethiah\\'s calling\\\" will not work if this mod is enabled and your follower is essential. Please deactivate this mod to play that quest.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nCopy the ESP file or files you want to use to your Skyrim\\\\Data folder. Make sure they are enabled in the Data Files section of the Skryim launcher (usually newly-copied files are enabled by default).\r\n\r\nTHANKs\r\n\r\nThanks to the people who wrote the uesp.net wiki and the makers of the following softare: TESsnip, FO3Edit, Skyrim Viewer. Thanks also to the makers of the Skyrim Nexus website.\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n\r\nFixed a bug with the short version of some characters\\' names.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.\r\n\r\nInitial release.",
