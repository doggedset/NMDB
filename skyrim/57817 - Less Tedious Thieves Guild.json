  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]So, hands up if you have honestly ever done the 125 jobs for the Thieves Guild without the use of a mod or some sort of cheat. If you have then I take my hat off to you. Personally, I have never done it, it was just too much to ask so I decided to change that while still being able to play the quest-line.\r<br />\r<br />The following mod is a replacement script that brings the job requirements from 125 down to 25. I have tested this myself by doing 5 jobs each in the major holds in my current play-through.\r<br />\r<br />[b]NOTE: [/b]This mod is for a new game, I have heard word in the comments that it doesn&#39;t work on an existing game if you&#39;ve done more than 5 jobs for the Thieves Guild.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][u]Detail[/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]So, with the changes this is how things work. I&#39;ll leave in brackets the old amount.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][list][*][size=3]Jeweled Candlestick appears after 5 jobs.
