  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#b45f06][size=6]              Welcome to Kursans Solitude Tower Loft   \r<br /> \r<br />                                    [img]http://i.imgur.com/VFlvwAI.png[/img]\r<br />[/size][/color][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff][size=3]The next time you enter Solitude, hang a right at the gate and at the\r<br />entrance to the tower staircase that leads to the ramparts above the gate, you shall \r<br />find a note; some poor sod dropped his rental agreement for a tower room \r<br />fully furnished and paid for, now it is yours for the taking&#33;\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#00ff00]CHANGELOG V-1.5 FINAL:\r<br />Added Navmesh to the private balcony on the battlements; followers can now join the player there but the walk along the wall is still off limits.\r<br />Added a second chair by table, some food, a tanning rack and a cot.\r<br />Did NOT change the file name so updating without loss of stored items is possible. (will still appear as 1.3 in your load order&#33;)\r<br />Cleaned again with TES5edit. \r<br />\r<br />Changelog for V-1.4 :\r<br />Cleaned up the Navmesh inside the Loft to optimize it for followers,\r<br />Tweaked the window lights some more, they should now correspond to time of day,\r<br />Hopefully turned off enemies spawning inside the loft,\r<br />\r<br />Changelog for V-1.3 :\r<br />Fixed a lighting issue where the lights in the Loft would flicker on and off; changed all lights out completely to a warmer even tone, windows less bright.\r<br />Fixed a clipping issue with the entrance doors clipping into the wall behind; rebuilt door frame and added black box behind doors.\r<br />I re sized the table top enchanter slightly so it is less gawky but still works.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[color=#00ff00]Changelog for V-1.5 GS : \r<br />This is a version same as original except a General Stores storage Chest was added. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18340/?]Requires General Stores resource get it HERE.[/url]\r<br />General Stores allows you to store and retrieve your gear across multiple homes or locations, check out some of my other GS enabled mods.[/color]\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=3]CHECK OUT the nice video made by ApplesAlmighty. Please Note this video features the older version (1.1) and does not show the changes made to V-1.2 - 1.5&#33;\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[youtube]J2M5c_XVNng[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]CHANGELOG v-1.2:\r<br />By request I added a tabletop enchanter to the Tower Loft and a storage satchel\r<br />to go with it.\r<br />Because Solitude not only lacks cheap housing but also a smelter I added one by\r<br />the water front, about halfway between the sawmill and the docks.\r<br />I also added a small dock by the smelter, some clutter and one more ore vain, I think it all blends \r<br />in well with the surroundings.\r<br />Added a Pickaxe and a shovel by the campfire that is nearby.\r<br />Modified a couple of rampart stairs near the blue Palace.\r<br />Fixed some cosmetic seems along the ramparts.\r<br />Added small chimney on the tower for the smoke.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]UPDATING:\r<br />If you want to update make sure to remove all belongings from the tower loft, then uninstall 1.1. Make a clean save before installing the latest V 1.5, \r<br />if you don&#39;t care about the enchanter and smelter or navmeshed balcony then stick with the original. \r<br />[/color]\r<br />[color=#00ffff][size=3]Description:\r<br />This mod adds a passage through the tower on the ramparts above the gate\r<br />that leads to a cozy furnished room in the tower above.\r<br />There is plenty of storage, a place to cook, a bed, an alchemy station\r<br />and a bookshelf; there is also one weapon plaque and the passage through\r<br />the tower has 5 upright weapon racks. \r<br />There is lots of decorative stuff and some useful items, and the room\r<br />has a warm inviting feel.\r<br />\r<br />The passage below leads through the tower and makes a previously inaccessible\r<br />part of the battlements accessible as a sort of balcony for the player.\r<br />There is a simple table and chair with some food to enjoy the view.\r<br />\r<br />The Loft and the passage are Navmeshed, however the ramparts are not and I will\r<br />NOT make them so.\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ffff00]SPECIAL NOTE:\r<br />I have moved the collision barriers to the outside of the city wall so it is now possible\r<br />to walk along the wall as far as the Blue Palace; you can drop down into the city at \r<br />various spots (especially useful for thief&#39;s). I have placed stairs at various locations to \r<br />enable a return trip along the wall. Walk the wall AT YOUR OWN RISK.\r<br />There is no collision barrier to the inside of the city and some drops can kill you&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Please note that this will afford you a view the developers did not want you \r<br />to see; the long distance view was not designed to fill in all the gaps below the walls\r<br />so don&#39;t look too close, but the far view from the balcony is quite nice.\r<br />\r<br />This is supposed to be a simple player home, please do not ask for mannequins etc. \r<br />All the crafting stations you need are obtainable in the city, this is mainly a home to crash and store some stuff. \r<br />[/color]\r<br />[color=#ffff00]Installation:\r<br />Best use the NMM dowload tab or for manual install unzip the esp file into \r<br />your Skyrim Data folder.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3]Compatiblity: \r<br />[/size][/color][color=#00ff00][size=3]Fully compatible with Nernies Solitude :[/size][/color][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22959/?] http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22959/?[/url]\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=2]Fully compatible with ETaC :[/size][/color] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13608/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13608/?[/url]\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3]Fully compatible with Dawn of Solitude : [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58110/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58110/?[/url][/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3]Fully compatible with JK&#39;s Solitude :[/size][/color] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58055/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58055/?[/url]\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=3]NOT[/size][/color][color=#00ff00][size=3] compatible with The Tower of the Wolf :[/size][/color] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58568/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58568/?[/url] [color=#00ff00]This mod uses the same location but if you want something more flamboyant go check it out.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]Credits and permissions:\r<br />Please use this mod as you like in YOUR game; do not upload an altered \r<br />version without my permission.\r<br />ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR SAVE BEFORE TRYING A NEW MOD&#33; \r<br />This mod was cleaned with TES5Edit, but responsibility to use it in your game is yours&#33;\r<br />I like to thank Bethesda for making Skyrim and the CK.\r<br />A special thanks to Eldiabs for his modders resource pack.
