  "descriptionHtml": "Essential Lydia\r\n\r\n\r\nI apologize for the lack of a file after this went live. I didn\\'t realize that I neglected to upload it. Both current versions (the original Ebony+Essential mod) and the OP (Daedric+tank-y buffs) are now up.\r\n\r\nPlease share any screens you take with this mod. I haven\\'t been using Lydia as a follower much in my last few saves, and would like to see some combat action for this mod.\r\n\r\nI created this mod for everyone  who is sick and tired of having Lydia die horribly at the hands of a group of bandits or Draugr. I also upgraded her armour from the basic steel that she normally wears, to a much more resilient ebony set. I can make a default armour version if it is requested. If you use this in another mod, please give credit.\r\n\r\nI plan on further tweaks, possibly creating a ridiculous OP version (optional) and a slightly buffed version (current). I will consider requests for armor sets and combat tweaks, but I WILL NOT make a \\\"sexy Lydia\\\" mod. Nexus is already full of those and I find them unnecessary. If that\\'s your style, I can give you tips on how to make it happen, but I won\\'t make one myself.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\nChange log:\r\n\r\nV1.0 \r\n- Set Lydia as essential\r\n- Set default armour to ebony\r\n- Set default sword to ebony 1h\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL FILE:\r\nV1.0.1 - Lydia OP Tank\r\n- Daedric Armour & weapon\r\n- health boost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\nBugs:\r\nV1.0\r\n- No known bugs yet",
