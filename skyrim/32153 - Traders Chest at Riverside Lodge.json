  "summary": "::REQUIRES RIVERSIDE LODGE MOD BY LUPUS:: Trader\\'s Chest at Riverside Lodge provides a \\\"Junk\\\" chest for you to throw all your loot in and after an amount of time a \\\"Trader\\\" will take your loot and leave you gold in the value of your items (after a small fee is taken for his work).",
  "descriptionHtml": "ATTENTION: For all those ppl that don\\'t want to download Riverside Lodge to gain access to this feature, I have just added a new mod that places this chest at every purchasable property in skyrim (not including hearthire) called [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32262][color=red]Trader\\'s Chest: Homes[/color][/url]\r\n\r\nTrader\\'s Chest at Riverside Lodge provides a \\\"Junk\\\" chest for you to throw all your loot in and after an amount of time a \\\"Trader\\\" will take your loot and leave you gold in the value of your items (after a small fee is taken for his work).\r\n\r\nI\\'ve had my share of merchant hopping to sell all my loot to gain maximum profit from my dungeon exploring and decided to do something about it. With this mod, all you have to do is throw all your unwanted loot into the chest and wait a specified amount of time for the Trader to show up and leave you gold for all your items. The trader will take 10% of the combined value of the loot in the chest for his troubles. And, yes, he does take your \\\"stolen\\\" items.\r\n\r\nI have not found a mod like this on this site and I have not looked anywhere else. If someone has created a mod similar to this or even if the script is 100% identical to another person\\'s mod, it is purely coincidental. If any modders want to use this as a resource, be my guest. If wanted by the community, I can make mods for all the more popular house mods that will place this chest in a convenient location there as well. Also, I give permission to any and all modders, to use and improve upon this mod.\r\n\r\nAttention: This file contains only the chest and not the house mod. The  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14308][color=green]Riverside Lodge with Sauna[/color][/url] mod is required. I testify that I am not the creator of Riverside Lodge, all the credit belongs to Lupus, I simply created a scripted chest and placed it.\r\n",
