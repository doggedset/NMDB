  "descriptionHtml": "The old gravekeeper of the Solitude Catacombs still haunts his old home. His old living space remains intact, ready for a new resident to take hold.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod. I created it as a home for one of my characters, and decided to release it to the public. The home is in the Solitude Catacombs, just across from the door to the Hall of the Dead. It has a bedroll, alchemy table, a cooking pot, two urns, and an alchemy satchel. There is a leveled bandit ghost near the area. In order to make this a home, the SolitudeHalloftheDeadCatacombs cell has been marked as a \\\"NoResetZone.\\\"\r\n\r\nStandard Disclaimer: I am not responsible for anything that happens to users of this mod. Back up your saves first.",
