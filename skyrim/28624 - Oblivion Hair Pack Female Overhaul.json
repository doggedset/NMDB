Sorry if you want the vanilla appearances but I cba to change it back.\r\n\r\n[b][color=yellow]Installation[/color][/b]\r\n[list=1]\r\n[*]First download the Oblivion Hair Pack Fixed (if not the mod will not work)\r\n[*]Download with NMM or simply extract to Skyrim Data folder\r\n[*]Make sure the mod is enabled in the Launcher\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b][color=yellow] Conflicts & Notes [/color][/b]\r\nNaturally this will conflict with other NPC hair replacing mods\r\nAlso, not tested personally, but it may conflict with mods that replace the appearance or style of Female NPCS (males should be fine)\r\nAlso you need the Fixed Hair Pack version, not the original mod.\r\nTo make the women look like the screenshots, you\\'ll want [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563] Coverwomen [/url]\r\n\r\n[b]I\\'m NOT the creator of the hair pack version OR of the original mod!\r\nCredits go to DragonAge7 (for the fixed version) and RadioRagae (for the original)[/b]",
