[/b][/color]\r\n[color=yellow]\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nDescription\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n[/color]\r\n[color=green][b]This config is basically just a tweaking of Kyo\\'s Kountervibe. \r\n\r\n I liked the color choices made in Epic Natural ENB, so I stole the RGB values from his enbeffects.fx file.  EDIT:  Was told Epic Natural was a Somber ENB rip, so perhaps i borrowed from them, I dunno, I tried Somber and didn\\'t like it.  Either way, borrowing the Green value of 0.985 from the enbeffects.fx file doesn\\'t make me a thief, or does it?\r\n\r\n I liked the sky and day/night work done in Tundra ENB, so I borrowed a little from it as well.  I don\\'t like the heavy use of bloom in Kountervibe, so I toned it down.  I also reduced the quality of the DOF and SSAO from Kountervibe to buy a couple FPS.  I don\\'t really see a quality difference.  Nights are similar to Epic Natural, maybe a little darker, same with interiors.  This config does use Kountervibe\\'s SweetFX, but I turned most of the effects off aside from SMAA, I think it provides a crisper image and it bought me a couple FPS.\r\n\r\nPotential adopters should be warned that I have toned down interior and exterior nighttime lighting substantially.  I think it adds realism, but many folks don\\'t like things too dark.  It also effects torches, they\\'re no longer LED spotlights.\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t supply a ton of screenshots as the only way to tell if you like an ENB is to load it up real quick and run around.  I suggest curious visitors to do the same.
