  "descriptionHtml": "This is the Birds and Flocks Hearthfire Edition.  If you do not own the Hearthfire expansion, do NOT download this file.\r\n\r\nIf you are switching from the original Birds and Flocks to the Hearthfire Edition, first disable and/or delete the \\\\\\\"Birds.esp\\\\\\\" mod from Skyrim\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\"Data\\\\\\\" menu, and then download this file and place it in the \\\\\\\"data\\\\\\\" folder in the Skyrim directory.\r\n\r\nThere is no difference between this mod and the original Birds and Flocks except compatibility with Hearthfire.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThis mod will add in dozens and dozens more instances of birds that fly away when startled by either the player or another creature.  The effect is one that already exists in the game but was used very rarely, so I expanded its use. \r\n\r\nThis mod also adds in many more circling birds of prey along cliffs, tundras, forests, and mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nNow includes more bats in dungeons!\r\n\r\nJust download the plugin and place it in your \\\"data\\\" folder in Skyrim\\'s install directory.\r\n\r\nThe original Birds and Flocks can be found here:  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11555",
