Ever sigh at the sight of a single giant decimating a dragon? Then this mod is for you! \r\n\r\nThis mod is intended to give the Dragonborn a job. This is done by making NPCs deal less damage to all Dragons, as well as increasing the Dragon core health and mitigation.\r\nThis results in longer, more epic battles - without increasing the difficulty - where YOU, the legendary Dragonborn are necessary to defeat these mighty foes. \r\n\r\nAlthough NPCs still deal damage, you should no longer see mere bandits and wolves taking down a dragon in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nResilient Dragons does the following :\r\n\r\n* Increases all Dragon BASE and OFFSET Health.\r\n\r\n* Increases all Dragon damage mitigation.\r\n\r\n* Increases Dragon mitigation of damage received from NPCs.\r\n\r\n* Increases Dragon melee damage by a very small amount.\r\n\r\n* Increases Dragon Stagger Resistance\r\n\r\n* Causes all Dragons to be immune to the Armour portion of Marked for Death (Health Drain portion still effective)\r\n\r\n* Introduces the Dismay Shout to Blood and Frost Dragons - Fearing any NPC it hits.\r\n\r\n* Introduces the Unrelenting Force shout to Elder and Ancient Dragons - Only staggers the player slightly, whilst pushing NPCs back fully.\r\n\r\n* Adds a constant aura of fear that causes animals and villagers to flee\r\n\r\n* Allows dragons to level with the player - meaning lesser Dragons no longer become worthless at a higher level\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to leave feedback / constructive criticism in the comments section. I\\'m always open to ideas and suggestions.I hope you enjoy Resilient Dragons, and I look forward to your feedback!\r\n\r\n\r\nNexus Link (Including Vanilla Shouts Edition) : http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10591\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\nCompatability\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod edits the main Dragon files, and shall conflict with any other mod doing the same. All shouts for Dragons are custom made as to further compatability and not mess with ther players shouts.\r\n\r\nJust to be safe, load this mod AFTER any mod that it may conflict with to still gain the benefit of Resilient Dragons.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\nVersions\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n***** Resilient Dragons 2.1 *****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Dragons will now level with you! - Lesser Dragons will no longer become easy at high levels - Hooray! Alldragons will now be your level * 1.2 - unless the result falls below the minumum (dependant on Dragon), or above the maximum (100)\r\n\r\n* Dragons are now More balanced in terms of health - this is to accomodate above change (previously, low level dragons were made increasingly powerful to still give a challenge at high levels)\r\n\r\n* Removed \\\"hostile\\\" flag for Dragons aura of fear - should hopefully eliminate issues with Odahviing\r\n\r\n* Added Whiterun Jarl to the list of NPCs unefected by the Fear Aura\r\n\r\n* Added HouseCarl FAction to the list of NPCs unefected by the Fear Aura\r\n\r\n* Made Alduin more powerful - He now ranks top of the Dragons, improving over the Ancient Dragons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------Previous Version Patch Notes-----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***** Resilient Dragons 2.0 *****\r\n\r\n\r\n-Big thanks to \\\"iWillWander\\\" (Creator of \\\"Legendary Lore - Dragons\\\") for Creation Kit tips and advice!-\r\n\r\n\r\n* Added Dragon Voices (Sounds) to Unrelenting Force and Dismay.
