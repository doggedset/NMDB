  "summary": "removes gold from the inventory of all draugr as well as the generic dragon priests.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Quick and Simple edit of Draugr Leveled List in Tes5edit that removes gold from draugr and dragon priest inventories, done not only for immersion purposes as draugr shouldn't have septims but to bring balance to your game if you feel you get way too much gold from crypts and are playing a hardcore/survival playthrough.\n<br />\n<br />Compatible with most everything I should imagine, unless of course you have another mod that edits leveled lists for Draugr and Dragon Priest Death items, in which case, Load this mod after any mod that makes such changes. Recommend you create a Bashed Patch if you have numerous mods editing leveled lists.\n<br />\n<br />No requirements or special installation process.\n<br />\n<br />Any and all feedback welcome",
