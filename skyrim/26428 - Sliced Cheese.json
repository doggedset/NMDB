  "summary": "Ever get sick of how you can do all this awesome Dragonborn stuff but not slice up that cheese wheel you picked up at the last bandit camp you raided?",
  "descriptionHtml": "This was inspired by Blood Barrels for Vampires. The mod author has a hilarious rant about how you\\'re the badass of all badasses, but can\\'t work a screw tap. Which got me thinking, why the hell can\\'t you slice up those cheese wheels you pick up all over the place? Are you so simple you can\\'t clean the blood off your dagger and cut a slice? Now you can! This very small mod adds those pesky missing recipes at any cooking pot/spit! This works great with mods that add hunger to the game, such as IMCN and others.\r\n\r\nRecipes-\r\nSliced Cheese Wheel (Either)= 7 Slices\r\nWhole Cheese Wheel (Either)= 8 Slices\r\n\r\nThis shouldn\\'t conflict with anything, unless it adds these same recipes.
