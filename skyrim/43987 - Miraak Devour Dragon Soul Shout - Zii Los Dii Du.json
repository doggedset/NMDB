  "summary": "Miraak Devour Soul Shout - By Rossobud\r\n\r\nThis is my First mod so go easy on me....",
  "descriptionHtml": "We have all faced Miraak (Or atleast those who have dragonborn dlc) and witnessed his power.\r\nHis tentacle sword, his Dragon Aspect shout, but most of all, when we taught it was all over, it\r\nwasn\\'t. \\\"Kruziikrel, zii los dii du!\\\" - Kruziikrel, your soul is mine to devour!\r\nMiraak absorbed the soul of all three dragons circling the summit of Apocrypha in order to \r\nreplenish his health. Miraak was the first dragonborn, but sided with the dragons, where he\r\nlearned the dov language. The shout itself is more dov language than a shout but if he was the \r\nfirst dragonborn/dovahkiin, and was under the influence of Hermaeus Mora for a long time, he is bound to\r\nhave a few tricks up his sleeve.\r\n\r\nWARNING: THIS WILL REPLACE \\'Animal Allegiance\\'!!!!\r\n\r\nAnd so to the mod, this mod adds the \\'Shout\\' Miraak used to Devour the souls of those poor\r\ndragons. The only way it is to find the \\'Animal Allegiance\\' word walls. Here is a good video by Orcidia: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5MnC91QoI\r\nOr\r\nYou can open command console and type \\'help ziilos\\'\r\n                                                           \\'help dii\\'\r\n                                                           \\'help du\\'\r\nUse PgUp on keyboard to scroll up on the command console, keelp scrolling, you will find the WOOPs.\r\nUPDATE: (Thanks stsr85)\r\nAbout Words IDs\r\nAlways the first two digits is different.\r\nThe standards IDs is:\r\nFirst Word (ziilos) \\\"xx000d64\\\"\r\nSecond Word (dii) \\\"xx000d6c\\\"\r\nThird Word (du) \\\"xx000d6d\\\"\r\nLike i say the XX is the different for everyone.Now if you type in the console to find the first Word ID (help ziilos) and the ID is (C3)000D64\r\nthen the other two words IDs is \\\"C3000D6C\\\" for second Word and \\\"C3000D6D\\\" for third \r\n\r\nThis is the \\'Animal Allegiance\\' Shout, and I\\'m sorry, It\\'s the only shout I never use. But hey, you got to make some sacrifice because the Devour Soul shout is cool.\r\nIt dosent add to your health, creation kit wouldn\\'t allow me to do that in a shout, so sorry about that...\r\nSo far I have only made it NORD compatible, but I will change that in the future. Female compatible\r\nwould sound weird as Miraak was a guy but let me know what you guys think! The Sound of your\r\ncharacter will sound the same as Miraak when you use the shout. The shout is very overpowered\r\nso if you want me to increase the recharge time, let me know. It was made for dragons but\r\nIt can be used on other things aswell.\r\n\r\nCOMING SOON: Sounds for other races, An optional rar file containing all of the sounds Miraak makes when he shouts (fus ro dah, etc...) that can be installed so that you sound like him when you shout, If possible, a hand-held spell that launches tentacle pits like Miraaks Staff.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\n1. Drag the \\'Data\\' Folder into C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\r\n\r\n2. Click yes for everything.\r\n\r\n3. Check in NexusModManager that it is ticked in your load order.\r\n\r\n4. Start skyrim\r\n\r\n5.Find the  \\'Animal Allegiance\\' word walls. Here is a good video by Orcidia: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5MnC91QoI\r\nOr\r\nYou can open command console and type \\'help ziilos\\'\r\n                                                           \\'help dii\\'\r\n                                                           \\'help du\\'\r\nUse PgUp on keyboard to scroll up on the command console, keelp scrolling, you will find the WOOPs.\r\nAbout Words IDs\r\nAlways the first two digits is different.\r\nThe standards IDs is:\r\nFirst Word (ziilos) \\\"xx000d64\\\"\r\nSecond Word (dii) \\\"xx000d6c\\\"\r\nThird Word (du) \\\"xx000d6d\\\"\r\nLike i say the XX is the different for everyone.Now if you type in the console to find the first Word ID (help ziilos) and the ID is (C3)000D64\r\nthen the other two words IDs is \\\"C3000D6C\\\" for second Word and \\\"C3000D6D\\\" for third \r\n\r\nAnd you\\'re done! >:D\r\nPlease let me know if there is any bugs or problems and I will fix them ASAP :)\r\nIf you want to use this in your own mod tell me!\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2.0: Added other races support, and fixed a bug that may have replaced the Fo Krah\r\n Diin Sound for Nords...\r\n\r\nAND: I added an optional file. When installed it allows you to sound like Miraak...\r\n\r\nWhen you use the full shout (hold the shout button) you sound like Miraak for the following:\r\nUnrelenting Force\r\nFire Breath\r\nFrost Breath\r\nWhirlwind Sprint\r\n\r\nThese were the only shouts that were voiced properly in the BSA file so sorry if you were\r\n expecting more...\r\n\r\nYou can also install via Nexus Mod Manager :D\r\n\r\n(If a more experienced modder could add the shout rather than replacing it, that would be\r\ncool, tell me if you\\'re using this though ;))\r\n\r\nOTHER Mods in the Screenshots:\r\nMedusa Drakul armors and Thanatos dragon by Zerofrost Satyr\r\nCloaks of Skyrim by Noodles\r\nThermopylae by Author Set file to hidden\r\nAetherium Armor and Weapons Compilation by lautasantenni\r\n",
