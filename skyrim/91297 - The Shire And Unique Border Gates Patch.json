  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Arial][color=#00ffff][b][size=5]What is this Mod?[/size][/b][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />As requested on Reditt; this is a simple patch to make Duinnin's  Unique Border Gates compatible with TheBawb's The Shire. Both mods edit the gate near Riften and were conflicting prior to this patch.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#00ffff][b][size=5]\n<br />Requirements?[/size][/b][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />Neither mods require DLCs, or any script extenders. But this patch does require the mods themselves:\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84460?tab=description]The Shire\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52296?tab=description]Unique Border Gates\n<br />[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][b][color=#00ffff][size=5]Installation:[/size][/color][/b][/font]\n<br />\n<br />1) Install The Shire and then Unique Border Gates.\n<br />   ﻿         ﻿OR\n<br />2) Install Unique Border Gates and Then The Shire. \n<br />[img width=337,height=333]http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/019/499/promoguy.jpg[/img]      \n<br />\n<br />3) Install this patch last. Ensure that it is below the other two in your load order. \n<br />This patch is comprised of solely an ESP. To uninstall, simply delete it from your data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][b][color=#00ffff][size=5]\n<br />Do you take patch requests?[/size][/color][/b][/font]\n<br />\n<br />Depends. As I recently re-picked up support for The Shire I tend to take reasonable requests for that project. As for others; probably not. Between military life, Unreal engine projects, and upkeeping The Shire I tend to be booked most days. But what the hell, drop the idea in the comments and see what happens.\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i66.tinypic.com/j0cvav.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i66.tinypic.com/1dg5g.jpg[/img]\n<br />[img]http://i64.tinypic.com/r22ogz.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i64.tinypic.com/jj368p.jpg[/img]",
