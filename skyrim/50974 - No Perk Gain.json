  "descriptionHtml": "I requested a mod that, in my opinion, would make the Legendary skills.. well Legendary&#33; As the thread does not seem to get any love i figured i would make the best of it and see what my novice knowledge of the creation kit could manage. By now you must wonder what Legendary skills have to do with perks or no perks, well, perks would become obsolete in the mod that i requested, so i just figured ill try and make the mod myself and in small installments or babysteps.",
