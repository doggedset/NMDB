  "descriptionHtml": "Changes the first perk in (almost) every skill tree. Now only one perk point is required for each initial perk, and that perk levels up as the skill does, instead of having five ranks for every first perk in the tree.\r\n\r\nThis is offered as an alternative to major perk overhauls. This mod does not add perks to trees; it simply removes the redundancy of the 5 rank system for beginning perks.\r\n\r\nThis mod does not alter the functionality or skill level at which perk bonuses are realized.\r\n\r\nLet\\'s use Archery as an example:\r\n\r\nArchery (Overdraw) - \\\"Bows do more damage based on skill level\\\"\r\n\r\n+ 20% bow damage once perk is taken\r\n+ 40% at Archery skill level 20\r\n+ 60% at Archery skill level 40\r\n+ 80% at Archery skill level 60\r\n+ 100% at Archery skill level 80\r\n\r\nArchery, Heavy Armor, Two Handed, One Handed, Light Armor, Sneak, Alchemy, and Enchant all increase at this rate\r\n\r\nBlock (Shield Wall) - \\\"Blocking is more effective, based on Block skill\\\"\r\n\r\n+ 10% once perk is taken\r\n+ 20% at Block skill level 20\r\n+ 30% at Block skill level 40\r\n+ 40% at Block skill level 60\r\n+ 50% at Block skill level 80\r\n\r\nIllusion, Conjuration, Destruction, and Restoration simply have the apprentice, adept, expert, and master ranks removed. The perk bonus works as follows:\r\n\r\n\\\"Cast spells for half magicka. Higher spells require higher skill level.\\\"\r\n\r\nNovice spells initially cast for half magicka\r\nApprentice spells at skill level 25\r\nAdept spells at skill level 50\r\nExpert spells at skill level 75\r\nMaster spells at skill level 100\r\n\r\nAlteration leveling works the same, but the perk tree has been rearranged as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Novice alteration now connects to either(both) mage armor or magic resistance.\r\n\r\n2. Mage armor and magic resistance both connect to stability.\r\n\r\n3. Stability now links to Atronach\r\n\r\nAlteration dual casting is untouched.\r\n\r\nPickpocket has been changed to the following:\r\n\r\n\\\"Picking Pockets is easier as your skill increases\\\"\r\n\r\nThe rate is a simple 1% bonus per skill point.\r\n(If your Pickpocket skill is 50, picking pockets is 50% easier)\r\n\r\nLockpicking increases at the same rate as vanilla ranks increase at the required skill levels, and the lockpicking tree has been rearranged (It still looks like a key).\r\n\r\nSmithing and Speech have not been altered in any way.\r\n\r\nThis mod does NOT require SKSE or any DLCs.\r\n\r\n***********************************************\r\nReport any errors or bugs to the comments section or PM me.\r\n\r\nThe vanilla perks always annoyed the crap out of me. This is a relatively simple mod to fix that. I am open to suggestions and requests, however I made this mod to take a break from another mod I am working on, and I will not likely be spending much time on updating/improving this one. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading, hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n3/25/13 Version 1.1 fixes the one handed perk armsman \r\n",
