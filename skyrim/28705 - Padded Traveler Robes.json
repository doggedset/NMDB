  "descriptionHtml": ":-:Authors note:-:\r\nThis was originali just a private mod, since I liked the look of the mage robes, but I actually needed some armour so I wouldn\\'t die all the time. \r\n12.03.2013\r\nI will not continue to update this mod, I simply dosnt have the time at this point of my life.\r\nI may come back someday...\r\n\r\n:-:Info about the robes:-:\r\nThe robes are not overpowered in any way, with a base armour rating at 13 and 17 points.\r\nThey are not upgradable because one would have to rip the clothing to apply extra protection, rendering the the robe useless.\r\nThey are only worth 60-100 Gold Coins.\r\nThey can be found under the \\'\\'Leather\\'\\' tab at any forge in Skyrim or in a backpack not far from the cave you exit when you escape Helgen\\'s doom.\r\n\r\n:-:Changelog:-:\r\n2.0\r\nAdded the Mountain Traveler\\'s Padded Robe and Fine Padded Boots\r\n1.0\r\nThe Padded Traveler\\'s Robe was relesed\r\n\r\n:-:Requests/Ideas:-:\r\nIf there is a outfit in the world of Skyrim you would like to see \\'\\'Padded\\'\\', you can comment here with the outfit in question and I\\'ll do it because I have nothing better to do :D\r\n\r\n:-:Mods that this mod goes good with:-:\r\n\\'\\'Bandolier - Bags and Pouches\\'\\' By Dragten [http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16438]\r\n\\'\\'Leather Backpack\\'\\' By Tupii [http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13732]\r\n\r\n:-:Shoutbox:-:\r\nOmg, why are so many people looking at this?
