  "summary": "It seems none of the save managers are really worked with at all anymore and never updated and no new features ever added. I want to change that. This is my version of the save manager with a save cleaner that deletes all except the most recent saves (Setting to choose how many saves); creates a backup before cleaning if you want, and can be set to",

The creator created them, fixed any bugs found, then dropped them as is and left them as a simple save manager. I would like to make the save manager that everyone loves. Maybe even add support for plugins in the future? For now, it is version 4.1.0.1 and simple yet, in my opinion, elegant. I made this for me, but I am uploading it here because I want to see where this save manager can go and what it can become with suggestions/feedback from other Nexus users.[/size][/color][/color][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[center][u][color=#1e84cc]Features:[/color][/u][/center]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=3]Save Folder Cleaner[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Backup Selected Character[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Backup All Characters[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Save File List[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]View save information[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Delete all saves with same name[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Delete character[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Create new character and skip wagon[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Supports flash drives.[/size]\r<br />[/list][/size]\r<br />[center][u][color=#1e84cc][size=5]Clean Saves[/size][/color][/u][/center]\r<br />[color=#ff0000][color=#1e84cc][color=#f4f4f4][size=3]The Clean Saves button will take the selected character (It doesn&#39;t have to be the currently loaded one) and do 1, 2, or 3 things depending on the options you set. The options are\r<br />[/size][/color][/color][/color][list=1]\r<br />[*][color=#f4f4f4][size=2]Delete Autosaves (Yes or No)[/size][/color]\r<br />[*][color=#f4f4f4][size=2]Create Backup (Yes or No)[/size][/color]\r<br />[*][color=#f4f4f4][size=2]How many saves do you want to keep?

The way it works is by loading every save in order from oldest to newest. Once it gets them all in order, it begins deleting them by starting at the oldest and moving towards the newest. It will subtract the amount you want to keep from the total number of files so it knows how many it should delete (e.g. You have 10 saves, you say to keep 3. 10 - 3 = 7. 7 files will be deleted).[/size][/color]\r<br />[center][u][color=#1e84cc][size=5]Backup Selected Character[/size][/color][/u][/center]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4][size=3]\r<br />Backup selected character will do exactly what it says. it will create a copy of every save file for that character and put those copy in a zip file. Choose where to store your backups&#33;\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[center][u][color=#1e84cc][size=5]Backup All Characters[/size][/color][/u][/center]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4][size=3]\r<br />Backup all characters... you get the idea. All of them at once in their own individual zip files.. :D\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[center][u][color=#1e84cc][size=5]Flashdrive support[/size][/color][/u][/center]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4][size=3]\r<br />You can run Skyrim Save Manager from a flashdrive if you wish. not only that, you can create a folder on that flash drive (e.g. Saves) and add that as a save file location to store your saves there. I tested this myself by adding a Save folder to the flashdrive, adding the folder to the save locations, loading a character that was stored in that location, and then loading a different character. When I loaded the character from the flashdrive, all files moved properly. When I loaded a different character, it moved the files back to the flash drive. You can now carry all of your Skyrim saves and the manager right in your pocket. :D\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[center][u][color=#1e84cc][size=5]Save File List[/size][/color][/u][/center]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4][size=3]\r<br />As soon as you select a character, even before you press the &#34;Load&#34; button, it will create a list of all save files and put them in a list on the left hand side in order from oldest to newest. The best part (In my opinion) [i][b]no doubles[/b][/i]. If you have two files with the same name but different extensions (For example, if you use SKSE you will have {savename}.ess and {savename}.skse but you will only see {savename} once in your list. Which brings us to the next feature. Now supporting multi-select as of version 2.1.0\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[center][u][color=#1e84cc][size=5]Delete all saves with same name[/size][/color][/u][/center]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4][size=3]\r<br />If you use SKSE, every save has two files instead of one (See above feature). Not only does the save list only show this double save as a single file name, but if you select a save and click Delete (top left side with the save file stuff, not the one on the right with character stuff), it will delete both. Also, if you use a script cleaning mod, usually you will end up with a .bak file for the cleaned file, so you could have {savename}.ess, {savename}.ess.bak, [i][b]and[/b][/i] {savename}.skse. With my save manager, you only have to click once to delete all three (Or even four if there is a .skse.bak file).\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[center][u][color=#1e84cc][size=5]Delete Selected Character[/size][/color][/u][/center]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4][size=3]\r<br />To delete a character you just have to select the character in the list and click delete. This will delete any saves for this character but will not delete your backups. Maybe I should add a feature to list backups with the option to delete those as well. :D Idea\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[center][u][color=#1e84cc][size=5]NO wagon scene[/size][/color][/u][/center]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4][size=3]\r<br />My program has &#34;Save 1 - Prisoner  Skyrim.ess&#34; and &#34;Save 1 - Prisoner  Skyrim.skse&#34; files built in. The best part, they are right before Hadvar says &#34;Who are you?&#34;. All you have to do is click &#34;New&#34; under the character selection box and will automatically store your previous character (if one is loaded) and write the files to your saves folder so all you have to do is click New and start Skyrim and you&#39;re ready. The saves are created in a no mod environment as well so you don&#39;t have to worry about mods missing or orphan scripts attacking you later. The only things installed at the time of save creation was Skyrim Legendary Edition and SKSE.\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />[center][u][color=#1e84cc][size=5]TODO List:[/size][/color][/u][/center]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4][size=3]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][s][color=#f4f4f4][size=2]Add the ability to show all backup files on the left and delete them individually[/size][/color][/s]\r<br />[*][s][color=#f4f4f4][size=2]Add a backup cleaner function to go through and delete all but the most recent backup of each character.[/size][/color][/s]\r<br />[*][s][color=#f4f4f4][size=2]Add a restore option to automatically delete all existing files for the restored character then retrieve the files from the backup.[/size][/color][/s]\r<br />[*][s][color=#f4f4f4][size=2]Add support for saves in custom locations.

I would love to get opinions on which version is preferred by you all so I know which one to continue forward with. This overhauled UI is available in version 3.0.0. If you do not like the overhauled ui then please use version 2.5.0 (All the same functionality but without the overhauled UI).[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=3]v2.5.0[/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4][size=3] - Added a preview window of each character on the right. This window will display what the latest save file is, the screenshot for that save, the character&#39;s level in that save, and the character&#39;s race. (No need to mouse over a save to see a screenshot unless you want to see a specific one).\r<br /> - Added the ability to launch the game from the save manager with configurable EXE preference (So you can launch vanilla, SKSE, or even other save managers/Mod Organizer).[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=3]v2.1.1[/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4][size=3] - Added a button to unload the currently loaded character. This will give compatibility to keeping your saves in a folder on a flashdrive so you can take your saves with you anywhere you go. (The target functionality here is for portability of saves on a flashdrive/usb hard drive but if you find another use for it then awesome. :D[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=3]v2.1.0[/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4][size=3] - You can now select multiple save files and backup files to delete them.

Added the ability to set the location that your backups are stored. Added the ability to keep your saves in multiple locations (beta feature, to keep it the original way, just don&#39;t add any new folders). Changed the way characters and their information are handled (Added a custom Character Class which holds the save location and save file names). Changed the view of the file lists to alternate between black and dark gray background colors. Added a settings form with options to enable/disable delete character warning and delete backup warning (A setting for each). Settings page is also how you add/remove another save location. Settings page is also used to change backups location.[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=3]v1.1.1[/size][/color] [color=#f4f4f4][size=3] - I realized I had compiled the application on the x64 architecture.

I am looking into the difference with the save files to see exactly how they are different and am currently going through the code to see whether it would be possible to add support for SE or if I would need to write a new version specifically for SE.
