  "descriptionHtml": "The only thing General Tullius ever wanted was to destroy those lawless Nordic Stormcloaks and their leader, Jarl Ulfress Stormcloak. \r\n\r\nBut secretly, he always had another wish... \r\n\r\nTO BECOME A WOMAN! And a... not so sexy one at that! Now, his dream came true with the help of a mysterious persona\\'s magical potion. \r\n\r\nThe only drawback of such, is that he still has his sexy man-growl, but he loves his voice too much to change it. \r\n\r\nThis one didn\\'t come out nearly as well as the Ulfric one, but I guess its an Imperial thing...\r\n\r\n*This is purely a joke! I made this because it was the easiest mod to make, ever*",
