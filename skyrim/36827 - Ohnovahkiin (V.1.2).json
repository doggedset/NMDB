  "descriptionHtml": "[center][youtube]kvNpSfhxM-o[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />For every great hero, there is a side-kick of equal greatness but less renown. \r<br />\r<br />Batman&#39;s Robin. The Lone Ranger&#39;s Tonto. Sherlock&#39;s Dr. Watson. Aquaman&#39;s dolphins. And now, at long last, the Dovahkiin has...\r<br />\r<br />OHNOVAHKIIN, THE NORMALBORN. Also known as Anebriate, the Drunken Paladin. Also known as Annie by those panda cubs back at paladin academy.\r<br />\r<br />Anebriate is a fully-voiced follower with over a hundred unique lines of dialogue created by a writer and game designer and voice-acted with studio-quality recording equipment by a pro. He&#39;s a belligerent drunk with one-too-many adventures under his belt, and he&#39;s not afraid to give you his informed opinion. Or insult you for no reason. You can find Anebriate in his favorite Tavern, just north of the Riften stables.\r<br />\r<br />This is first official release, but there&#39;s still more to come, including a labyrinth, some hobos, and a couple of quests. Also be sure to check the &#34;Book of Pledges&#34; in Larry&#39;s Tavern to scope out who made this project possible.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to know more about the Tales of the Drunken Paladin, head here to play the story of his origins:\r<br />\r<br />www.drunkenpaladin.com\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Ohnovahkiin&#39;s (Anebriate&#39;s) specs:\r<br />\r<br />- Player level x1.2, minimum level of 5, maximum of 60.\r<br />- Custom &#34;Paladin&#34; class, wielding heavy armor, excelling in two-handed swords and restoration magic, competent to a lesser degree with destruction magic (lightning) and blocking. \r<br />- Advised for mid-level play, but not completely unbalanced at low or high-level, either.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Other notes:\r<br />\r<br />1. Possible Incompatibilities:\r<br />- Any mods that visually affect the forest region north of Riften Stables, where the tavern is located\r<br />\r<br />2. Current Release: \r<br />- V.1.2 as of September 30, 2014\r<br />* (Greatly enhanced compatibility with other follower-related mods, especially AFT. Fixed a weird issue with the Black Briar Meadery. Balanced Anebriate to be a bit less powerful, with a lower minimum level and level multiplier. Removed his destruction perks and reduced his mana so that he&#39;s less dependent on lightning spells than before.)\r<br />\r<br />3. Requirements:\r<br />- Latest release of Skyrim. No expansions necessary.\r<br />\r<br />4. FAQ\r<br />- Q. Where is Ohnovahkiin?\r<br />- A. In Larry&#39;s Tavern, just north of the Riften Stables.\r<br />\r<br />- Q. What is &#34;Tales of the Drunken Paladin?&#34;\r<br />- A. A free RPG released originally in &#39;09 and worked on continually since then as a side-project. It tells the story of Anebriate, the Drunken Paladin, who eventually found his way to Skyrim and became Ohnovahkiin. You can learn more about that at www.drunkenpaladin.com.\r<br />\r<br />- Q. What else does this mod have?\r<br />- A. At this time, very little beyond the follower (which is the mod&#39;s primary purpose). In time, it will add a labyrinth, some unscrupulous new vendors (which will be voice-acted), a magical hobo and a couple of small quests requested by the people who helped make this project possible.\r<br />\r<br />- Q. Is this content adult-only?\r<br />- A. There is some adult language, but it is not the especially offensive kind, nor is it unsuitable for teens. I do not think it constitutes being an &#34;adult&#34; mod, but likewise, I do not think it is appropriate for children. Skyrim IS rated M, after all.\r<br />\r<br />- Q. Where is the cheese knife?\r<br />- A. The Winking Skeever.",
