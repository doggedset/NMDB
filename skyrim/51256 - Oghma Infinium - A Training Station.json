You open the book, select a path, select a skill and then train the skill in exchange for gold. It&#39;s just like training with a trainer, but without all the non-sense.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Features --[/color]\r<br />[list][*][color=#cb99c9]Train as much as you want[/color]. You&#39;re not limited to 5 training sessions per level anymore, there&#39;s literally no limit.\r<br />[*][color=#cb99c9]The cost of training has been smoothed out[/color]. You won&#39;t find any 3x or 5x multiplier when training your skills past level 50.\r<br />[*][color=#cb99c9]Train your skills up to the game engine limit[/color] (100 for normal games, greater than 100 if you use the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1175/][color=#7dc7ea]Skyrim -Community- Uncapper[/color][/url]).\r<br />[*][color=#cb99c9]No forced path for training[/color]. You&#39;re not forced to join any particular faction to access the right trainer.\r<br />[*][color=#cb99c9]This is a &#34;portable&#34; training station[/color]. It&#39;s just a time saver, you don&#39;t need to run around Skyrim to find master trainers anymore.\r<br />[*][color=#cb99c9]If a problem occurs during training, your gold won&#39;t be taken away[/color]. Your gold will be taken away only if you skill increased, not before like normal trainers do. This is to prevent the bug where a trainer takes your gold but your skill doesn&#39;t increase. Even if this mod uses a different method entirely, it still protects you from this kind of bug. It also prevents you from training from skill 100 to 101 without the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1175/][color=#7dc7ea]Skyrim -Community- Uncapper[/color][/url].\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Training cost formula --[/color]\r<br />[color=#cb99c9]Training cost = SkillTo * SkillTo * 0.5 + 54[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Where &#34;SkillTo&#34; is the value the skill after training. For example, if you train Destruction from 50 to 51 the cost will be: 51 * 51 * 0.5 + 54 = 1355 gold.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Limitations --[/color]\r<br />[list][*][color=#cb99c9]The &#34;old&#34; Oghma Infinium is gone[/color]. You won&#39;t get free +5 skills in the chosen path, it&#39;s +1 skill in the chosen skill and you pay for it.\r<br />[*][color=#cb99c9]You need to finish the Oghma Infinium quest[/color]. You could add the book with the console, but you won&#39;t be able to use it before the quest is completed. You get a time saver, not a free pass... [color=#fe2e2e]If you already used the Oghma Infinium, it will be added back to your inventory automatically (wait 5 seconds after loading a save, time spent in menus doesn&#39;t count)[/color].\r<br />[*][color=#cb99c9]The average cost/level for training from skill 16 to 100 is the same as vanilla: 2015 gold/level[/color]. Obviously, the average will be greater if you use the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1175/][color=#7dc7ea]Skyrim -Community- Uncapper[/color][/url] because you&#39;re training from 16 to ???. So technically, it doesn&#39;t cost more or less than the normal trainers.\r<br />[*][color=#cb99c9]The total cost for training from skill 16 to 100 is almost the same as vanilla: 173312 gold instead of 173250 gold[/color]. Obviously, the total cost will be greater if you use the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1175/][color=#7dc7ea]Skyrim -Community- Uncapper[/color][/url] because you&#39;re training from 16 to ???. So technically, it doesn&#39;t cost more or less than the normal trainers, there&#39;s only a 62 gold difference.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ffcc33]Installation, requirements and compatibility[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Requirements --[/color]\r<br />Latest version of Skyrim (Skyrim.ESM, Update.ESM)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Install (auto) --[/color]\r<br />For an automatic install without risk of errors, I suggest you use the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager/][color=#7dc7ea]NexusModManager[/color][/url].\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Install (manual) --[/color]\r<br />For a manual install, extract the files from this mod and copy them to the appropriate folders.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Compatibility --[/color]\r<br />Compatible with everything except mods that modify the Oghma Infinium. I&#39;m not aware of the existence of any such mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ffcc33]F.A.Q.[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Known issues --[/color]\r<br />This has only been confirmed for my own save game, but I&#39;m writing this in case it happens to other people too. For some reason training Restoration doesn&#39;t work as intended from skill 15 to 16 (it stops at 1 XP from leveling to 16). I work around this quirk by adding an extra 0.0001 XP to Restoration for this particular case but it has the unfortunate effect of giving me a free training session which puts Restoration at 17 instead of 16. After that, I won&#39;t see the problem again unless I reset Restoration by making it Legendary. In any case, this only happen from skill 15 to 16 on Restoration. This won&#39;t happen on any other skills. This very minor issue shouldn&#39;t appear for the majority of users, but it might happen for a &#34;select&#34; few.\r<br />\r<br />Some people have reported the Oghma Infinium isn&#39;t added back automatically to their inventory if they read the book before installing this mod. After some tests, I found the game doesn&#39;t always register correctly that you read the book. I use that test to avoid duplicates, if you finished the quest and didn&#39;t read the book that means it&#39;s still in your inventory or somewhere in the world (container, on the ground, etc.). If this happens to you, simply open the console and type [color=#cb99c9]player.additem 1A332 1[/color] to add the book manually.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Do you use scripts? --[/color]\r<br />Yes, but they&#39;re simple and safe. There&#39;s one script that will execute once and add the Oghma Infinium to your inventory and there&#39;s the modified Oghma Infinium&#39;s script. Those scripts are &#34;top -&gt; down&#34;, they don&#39;t loop, repeat themselves or execute in background while you&#39;re playing. I am a professional programmer and I make sure to the best of my knowledge that all my scripts won&#39;t cause you trouble. [color=#fe2e2e]I even package the sources[/color] if you want to look at them, so stop worrying your world&#39;s gonna implode and enjoy the mod.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffcc33]-- Any future plans? --[/color]\r<br />I&#39;ll fix problems (if any), offer support and answer questions when needed.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ffcc33]My other mods[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50460/][color=#7dc7ea]Master Trader[/color][/url] (Merchants never run out of gold)\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35567/][color=#7dc7ea]Mod Publishing Tutorial[/color][/url] (Everything you need to know to publish your mod and make your mod page right)\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33860/][color=#7dc7ea]TheThirdRace Skill Overhaul[/color][/url] (Minimalistic and modular skill overhaul aimed at balancing the vanilla skills while maintaining the vanilla feel)\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51972/][color=#7dc7ea]Ziil Los Dii Du[/color][/url] (Taste the power of Miraak.
