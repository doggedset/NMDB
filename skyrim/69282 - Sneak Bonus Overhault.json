But if you insist, just leave a comment, or you can modify it yourself, lol.)\r<br />Two-handed Sword: 8x (Yeah, it&#39;s a brilliant idea to bring a bigass greatsword with you when you are sneaking. I mean, who give a damn right?)\r<br />Two-handed Axe: 8x (Same as above...)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=#ff0000][size=4]If this mod isn&#39;t exactly your type of thing.
