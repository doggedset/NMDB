  "descriptionHtml": "Just to share a new trick I\\'ve learnt to make some parts of your armor disappear.\r\n\r\nSo here is a step-by-step guide in a pdf file to show how to make parts of an armor transparent, translucent or invisible.\r\n\r\nI\\'m just a humble beginner, so this guide is intended mainly for beginners. Experienced modders, do guide me where I\\'ve gone wrong :) \r\n\r\nYou will need:\r\n1. Photoshop with .dds plugin\r\n2. NifSkope\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nThanks to lidowxx for bringing this up. Some textures do not have an Alpha 1 layer. In such cases, all you need to do is create a new layer and name it the same Alpha 1, then fill it all with white. Somehow Photoshop can recognize it\\'s an Alpha 1 layer, and auto-hide it when the other layers are visible. Hope this works for you.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCredits to these websites for showing how this is done:\r\nhttp://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/484339-how-do-you-make-texture-transparent/\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9v4-WXih8E\r\n\r\nCredits also to Alan\\'s BBP Armor Mod for the large collection of fine-looking armors and outfits.",
