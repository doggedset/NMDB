  "descriptionHtml": "Don\\'t you find it strange that professionals would buy without making a profit ?\r\nThe mine and lumber-mill owners buy your wares at full price !\r\nSurely, communists AND capitalists must see an oddity here. xD\r\nNow it\\'s fixed for better immersion (really simple mod).\r\nTough, surely I am not the first tweaking this. This is my first mod.\r\nBut I want to expand it to inns, carriages, etc, and allow personalization.\r\nI really want to find how to change the rate-messages in Inns. I haven\\'t tried carriages yet,\r\nbut you can find mods that do it, even if they don\\'t offer choices. \r\n\r\n----------------\r\nInstallation\r\n----------------\r\nJust put ONE of the .esp files in your Data folder. Ta-daaaa ! ",
