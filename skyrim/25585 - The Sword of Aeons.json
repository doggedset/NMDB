  "descriptionHtml": "Edited Jeizar\\'s original 2hand version off steamworkshop.\r\n\r\nThe model is Jeizar\\'s not Rar\\'s.\r\n\r\nThe stats and crafting recipts are Rar\\'s.\r\n\r\nIs compatable with Jeizar\\'s original but doesnt require it.\r\n\r\nCraftable after you get Deadric smithing, and alot of Fable lore friendly nonrare items.\r\n\r\nAdded The Sword of Aeons proper description and speed, it is a little better in dps then the deadric sword while being faster then any other vinilla weapon, this has the keening enchantment and alot of charges so it does look like your absorbing orbs, but it does tend to turn the screen black and makes it hard to see while fighting, but I guess since I dont know how to fix that it\\'s just ballance for how it is.\r\n\r\nIt is still 2hand and will train 2handskill but I made it only equip to the right hand and I recommended that you equip a spell and not a weapon or a sheild because with the empty hand it tends to break and not use the weapon attack properly, no block because I mean really who ever blocked in Fable, be real now.",
