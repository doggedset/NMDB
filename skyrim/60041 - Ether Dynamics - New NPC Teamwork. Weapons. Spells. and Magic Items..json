The player is encouraged to participate however they see fit –\r<br /> observe, fight, or assist the new NPC’s.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The player can also summon a variety of other Skyrim NPC’s via Console Commands to see how they fare against these new combatants.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />For a sneak peek of the new Weapons, Spells, and Magic Items, take a look around the SilverBlood Inn. Related quest under development, stay \r<br />tuned&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Feedback on the AI changes, as well as general game design, is welcome -- I look forward to hearing from you&#33;",
