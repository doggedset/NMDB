  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=3]Description:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />This replaces the Skyrim province War Maps (the ones with the red and blue flag-pins) with an immersive topographic map with Geographically accurate locations.  I developed this for my [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16373]Equip-able Maps SE[/url] mod so The Dragonborn can successfully navigate Skyrim in compete immersion without needing the game's world map system (pictures are taken in Skyrim VR with the Equip-able Maps mod).  I'm going to see if I can throw together an immersive working compass as well, but until then use the in-game compass, and perhaps you may want to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2790]Sensible Hardcore Compass[/url] to remove compass markers besides the four cardinal directions (NSEW) for maximum navigational realism.  It's also a great use for the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5643/]Psijic Teleport Spells - SSE[/url]﻿ as it has an ability that lets you teleport anywhere in skyrim as a spell, and having a geographically accurate map will be a big help.\n<br />\n<br />I essentially did what [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/16083509]ExEBoss[/url] did with his [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5171]ExE Boss's Mods - Topographic Map[/url], but changed the colors and normal map to make it more true to the Skyrim feel.  I also added a normal/specular map that removes most of the [i]shine[/i] so you can view it in direct sunlight.  We both based our mods on [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2481008]z993126[/url]'s incredible [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36159/]Skyrim topographic map[/url]﻿ (Oldrim).\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#9fc5e8]Installation:[/color]\n<br />[/size][/b]Please note I will not be giving general support on how to enable and use mods.  There are other (better) places to get that information.\n<br />[b]Now then, simply download with your favorite mod management program (Vortex/MO2/NMM.[/b]",
