  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Verdana][size=3][b]REQUIRES DAWNGUARD&#33; \r<br />\r<br />ACE IS LOACATED AT RIVERWOOD&#33;[/b]\r<br /> \r<br />Ace is a lovable husky from Riverwood. Once you find him it will be hard to let him go. He will fight by your side right until the end.\r<br />\r<br /> He will be your very best friend. Look after him. And he will look after you. \r<br />\r<br />Most of the Husky&#39;s have been taken in by the Dawnguard, but Ace broke free and made his way to Riverwood where he has been awaiting the arrival of a traveler that is in need of a companion. \r<br />\r<br />If you spend a lot of time with Ace you&#39;ll feel like you have a strong bond with him. You&#39;ll know that he&#39;ll be there to fight your enemies. He&#39;ll be there when you just want to relax for a little bit. He&#39;ll be there forever. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Ace is essential so he cannot die. [/b]\r<br />\r<br />Hope you enjoy this little mod, be sure to leave a comment and a thumbs up&#33; Don&#39;t forget to share with your friends&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Thanks for downloading&#33; And don&#39;t forget to endorse if you enjoyed this mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Steam Workshop link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=289758189\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/font]Was uploaded on the Steam Workshop prior to this.
