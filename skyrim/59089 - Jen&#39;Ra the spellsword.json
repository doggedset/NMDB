So Jen&#39;Ra will be receiving a port to Special Edition as well as a few improvements in the coming weeks. [/center][size=4][font=Times New Roman][size=3]\r<br />     \r<br />      Hello&#33; This is my first mod and as such it is simple but like many simple things it is effective. Jen&#39;Ra is sturdy and powerful. She was designed to get you through the toughest of challenges that Skyrim has to offer. Alduin himself would be hard pressed to fight her. I hope you enjoy this mod and if you do I hope you send me any screenshots you take. I&#39;d love to see them&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Signed with a Smile, Jeans\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=5][u][b]LORE[/b][/u][/size] \r<br />(So Far)[/center]\r<br />\r<br />     &#34;You may find it odd that a Khajiit is allowed into the hold of Whiterun. Well really it is not that odd,once you know the story. Her story that is. Her name is Jen&#39;Ra. She traveled from  her chaotic home of Elsweyr carrying a grave burden,the remains of her husband Do&#39;Med. Her husband had once traveled to Skyrim and found it most beautiful. He once confided to his dear wife that he longed to be buried in that beautiful place. \r<br />     \r<br />     So with the help of Andurs she was allowed to place her husbands remains in the Hall of the dead in Whiterun. Now she stands inside the hall unsure of what to do now. Now that you know her tale maybe you find it less odd and maybe you will give her reason to leave the dead to rest. Like her husband she is a formidable fighter and might be of aid to you. An extra sword arm never hurts now does it?[/size][/font]&#34;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=4][size=5][b][u][center]Lore/Back story Updates[/center]\r<br />[/u][/b][/size][size=3]I have added Do&#39;Med&#39;s coffin to the Whiterun catacombs. Inside you will find his enchanted Scimitar Skyrim&#39;s Fang. It is frost enchanted and temperable. [/size]I made this part of the mod optional since it is still a technically a WIP. I plan to have a quest involved and a better weapon for the player.\r<br />[u][b]\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />[center]\r<br />[size=5][u][b]Jen&#39;Ra Stat List[/b][/u]\r<br />Essential\r<br />Marriageable (Thanks to MFVM by mysticentity ^.^ )\r<br />Starting level is 25 and she scales with you &#39;till level 100\r<br />Full Light and Heavy armor skill sets\r<br />One-handed specialist\r<br />Lightning destruction spells[/size][size=5][b][u]\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />[/size][/center][size=5]\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Version Log\r<br />[/b][/u][/size][size=4][u][b]\r<br />VERSION 1.0[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />This is my first follower mod. Originally she was gonna be for personal use but I \r<br />decided to put her here for others to use and test. If you do use her \r<br />and like or do not like how she works let me know. I would love some \r<br />feed back on this. Since it is my first mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Jen&#39;Ra is a Spellsword type follower. She prefers the Lightning spells. So she can easily zap your enemies from afar or slash them to ribbons of bloody gore&#33; Hope you enjoy and let me know if you do&#33;\r<br />\r<br />She can be found in the Hall of the Dead in Whiterun. She starts with court wizard robes and a Akaviri Katana. She mas the mage armor perk as well as lightfoot so you do not have to worry about her setting off any of those pesky traps&#33; This is still a WIP. Once I figure out how to do more detailed modding I plan to have her in her own armor as well as her own set of gear&#33; So keep an eye out&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This is a very basic follower mod but I can almost guarantee that if you are looking for a simple follower to help you survive in Skyrim, Jen&#39;Ra is one of the best options&#33;\r<br />\r<br />You will need to use mysticentity&#39;s mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36913/?]MFVM[/url] in order for her to work. As annoying as it is the defaultKhajiit female voice Jen&#39;Ra uses won&#39;t allow her to be recruited as a follower without that mod.\r<br />[size=4][u][b]\r<br />VERSION 1.1\r<br />[/b][/u][size=3][size=2]\r<br />In version 1.1 I have made Jen&#39;Ra a much more viable choice. She now possesses all light and heavy armor perks. Allowing you to equip her as you see fit. She now starts in a set of elven armor instead of court wizard robes. She still specializes in one-handed and lightning magic though. I have also updated her healing abilities. So she will keep herself healthy without you having to worry about her.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]VERSION 1.1c[/b][/u][/size][/size][/size][/size]\r<br />\r<br />This is just v1.1 Jen&#39;Ra and Do&#39;Med&#39;s coffin together. So you don&#39;t have to download them separately. I&#39;m back to working on this, been busy with other project lately. I plan to have her husbands reanimated skeleton in the catacombs among the other skeletons. He will be wielding his custom sword Skyrim&#39;s Fang. This sword will have custom meshes and textures. As I have said I&#39;m new to modding. So I hope you bare with me on this. :)  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]To Do List[/u]\r<br />-Custom Voice (If anyone is willing to lend their voice to this project let me know&#33;)\r<br />-Custom armor and weapons (This will take awhile.)\r<br />-Custom Quest (Underway.)\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][u]Compatibility[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Jen&#39;Ra is compatible with UFO - &#34;Ultimate Follower Overhaul&#34;. As far as other mods that change the follower system I am unsure. \r<br />\r<br />There are no other incompatibilities that I am aware of. She is a simple follower made using vanilla assets. So she should have no compatibility issues but if one occurs let me know and I will do my best to remedy the situation. ",
