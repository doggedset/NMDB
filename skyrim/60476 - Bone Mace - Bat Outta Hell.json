And since I love that game, I figured, why not?\r<br />\r<br />The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#1E90FF]== WHAT ==[/color][/size]\r<br />This new weapon, aptly named &#34;Bat Outta Hell&#34;, is a mace with similar stats to the iron mace (and without the jiggleboned jaw, sadly). I am not planning on renaming the weapon, so feel free to do it yourself with the CK or TESEDIT (or through enchanting it in-game) if it bothers you.\r<br />\r<br />As the mace was made with vanilla meshes, it will make use of any retextures you may have installed, such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12085/?]Better Bones[/url] by Ironman5000 or [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32561/?]Bones and Skeletons Retexture[/url] by Andre7890.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#1E90FF]== WHERE ==[/color][/size]\r<br />It can be found inside a non-respawning knapsack outside [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Embershard_Mine]Embershard Mine[/url], although you can also craft it at the forge if you so desire. Check the pictures&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#1E90FF]== HOW ==[/color][/size]\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
