  "descriptionHtml": "Sunhallowed Quiver Remix\r\nby DJ_Zephyr\r\n\r\nRequires Dawnguard\r\n__________\r\n\r\nI don\\'t usually go for HD texture packs, as the laptop I play Skyrim on can\\'t handle them RAM-wise, nor display them very well on its modest-resolution 15\\\" screen.  But when it comes to gear my characters actually use, sometimes I can\\'t help but install something, especially something as gorgeous as [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3676578/?]EcthelionOTW[/url]\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29329/?]Noldorian retexture of Auriel\\'s Bow[/url].  I love this remix of my Argonian\\'s favorite dragon-felling implement, but his redo of the quiver wasn\\'t quite what I was looking for.\r\n\r\nNever one to whine, I got to work on my own rendition.  Pulled the original vanilla texture out with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1395//?]BSA Browser[/url], extracted a polygon map from the mesh with [url=http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope]NifSkope[/url], then did the actual texture work in good ol\\' [url=www.gimp.org]GIMP[/url].  Once I was pleased with how it looked in-game, I figured I\\'d share my work with the rest of the Skyrim community.\r\n__________\r\n\r\nTo install, extract \\\"textures\\\" to your \\\"Skyrim/data/\\\" folder.  Overwrite when asked.\r\n__________\r\n\r\nCheck the permissions section for more info.  I\\'m a pretty open-source kinda guy, but I\\'m also big on credit where credit is due.  Thanks, and enjoy!",
