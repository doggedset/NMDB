  "modName": "Follower Theron",
  "summary": "The High Elf Stormcloak.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A remastered, updated version of Theron is available at [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84639][u][color=#0066cc]XG Followers[/color][/u][/url]&#33; Go get him there :)\r<br />\r<br />For this High Elf, Talos is a God. For believing in such, he was marked for death. For holding his life dear, he sought refugee in Skyrim. For the love of freedom, he joined the Stormcloaks. The shame of his own kind is now a true son of Skyrim, a citizen of Windhelm, a general among Ulfric&#39;s troops, a battle hardened barbarian. Theron may not be a Nord, yet he fights for his freedom and beliefs as fiercely as one of them. \r<br />\r<br />Theron is a High Elf like no other. No magicka knowledge, no Highborne powers, no fancy speech. He levels up with the player (cap 100), his battle AI matches the 2h Barbarian, with the proper perks added. This means he prefers the use of 2h weapons while wearing Light Armor, however, he&#39;s also quite skilled with the bow, 1h weapons and shields. Just don&#39;t expect him to wave his hands and perform fancy spells, those are not for him :P\r<br />\r<br />This being said, if you&#39;re a lore addicted, you may find a lot of flaws in this mod. Of all the possible races available... an High Elf Stormcloak, why? Well... why not? xD I do like, however, to remain as lore-friendly as possible in the mods I have, so I made up this very short story for Theron, and it works for me.\r<br />\r<br />Where to find him:\r<br />At the Palace of the Kings&#39; main hall or strategy room, Windhelm, most of the time. He spends his evenings at Candlehearth Hall (1st floor) and sleeps in the Palace of the Kings Upstairs, in one of the many beds available.\r<br />\r<br />Theron is completely standalone, so you will not need any additional mods for him to go out and start kicking butt. Although his [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii SkyHair[/url] style is included already he may, however, not look exactly like the Theron in these screenshots, so I&#39;ll share with you the mods I am using in case you want to try them out:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488]Better Males[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589]Natural Eyes[/url]\r<br />\r<br />I recommend using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13571]Dual Wield for Followers[/url] as well.\r<br />\r<br />....................................................................................................................................\r<br />\r<br />Credits and Special Thanks to:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii SkyHair[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3552857]Xannon98[/url] for his full support and help, screenshots and beta testing.\r<br />\r<br />....................................................................................................................................\r<br />\r<br />Special thanks to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/5035689/]Emadwasfi[/url] for this video:\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]kqPw85bEmk0[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />....................................................................................................................................\r<br />\r<br />Change log:\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1\r<br />Theron is now standalone.
