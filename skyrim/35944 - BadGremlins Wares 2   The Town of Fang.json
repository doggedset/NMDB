  "descriptionHtml": " Welcome to Fang &#33; [url=http://s98.photobucket.com/user/bikerbabe458/media/2welcomefang.jpg.html][img]http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l273/bikerbabe458/2welcomefang.jpg[/img][/url] A small town that has grown around a unique shop in the Rift. BadGremlins Wares has all your favorite goods. Headbangers Metal Works will take care of your weapons and armor. Visit the pub for a drink and have the bard play a tune. There is also a small, safe player home for you called Fang Lair across the river. Enjoy your stay in this unique town but mind yourself, Fangs guards are watching. Rumors of treasure in the town well were once told but never found.\r<br />\r<br /> This is a compilation of my older mods put in one place. There are jars, tables, statues and other goods. If you have the original mod BadGremlins Wares sorry but you have to remove it before installing this version. This should be ok with JarHunt installed. Please comment and please report any problems. At this time the stable hostler will not sell a horse, the CK does not like me Scripting.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE 1\r<br />Finally got a update to this mod. Alot of changes were made. Total redone the well tunnel and the pub. Added more npc&#39;s, got the stable guy to sell a horse, fixed glitches in the house. Please try it and comment. You should just be able to overwrite files.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />DO NOT upload to other sites or use assets without permission, Thanks BG\r<br />\r<br /> ",
