  "descriptionHtml": "Female Skin for use with the CBBE Body (NSFW)\r<br /> \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is an Adult Only Mod – Not Safe for Work (NSFW) - which affects the look of Female NPCs and Followers while naked.  If this offends you then just move along.\r<br />\r<br />You have to know how to use Creation Kit (CK) in order to utilize this mod.  \r<br />\r<br />If you are new to CK I have instructions for use in the accompanying PDF Guide, including pictures to help you along.  It isn’t hard to learn to use CK and this mod in no way leads to the deep end of the Modding Pool.\r<br />\r<br />It is required that you have [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666]Caliente&#39;s Beautiful Bodies Edition[/url] installed for this to function because I reference Caliente’s femalebody_0.nif and femalebody_1.nif (not included).  The reason I have not included these files is that so many different versions exist.  Non BBP, BBP, TBBP, HDT, etc., each with different paint (weight) applied and individually adjusted proportions.  The use of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49015]Caliente’s Body Slide 2[/url] is highly recommended, though not required.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />PDF Guide download available with, “twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one,” \r<br />(Arlo Guthrie - Alice&#39;s Restaurant)\r<br />\r<br />The PDF Guide goes into great detail about aspects of this Mod including conflicts I have encountered, how I overcame them and preemptively addressing a number of other issues.  It includes pictures and screenshots covering numerous topics and should help those new to Creation Kit navigate the necessary options.  \r<br />\r<br />This PDF Guide also includes numerous screenshots of nude NPCs, and Modded Followers that have been modified for my personal use with this mod.  The intent of these screenshots is to illustrate what this mod will do.  \r<br />\r<br />If depictions of nudity offend you then do not download the PDF Guide, do not download this mod and do not comment in the Posts section concerning how offended you are.\r<br />\r<br />Two Versions, BSA and Loose Files\r<br />\r<br />If you use the BSA version the body will not display properly in CK.  This is a cosmetic issue and does not effect the performance of the mod in game.\r<br />\r<br />What does this Mod do?  \r<br />\r<br />Simply, it lets you match the carpet to the drapes so that pubic hair matches the hair on the head.  It includes, five pubic hair colors, four variations to the areola (all four of which are separate options) and nine pedicure/manicure options.  See the table below.\r<br />\r<br />This Mod works on female, Breton, Imperial, Nord, Orc, Redguard; Vampires included, as well as Custom Races from Follower Mods.  It does not work on Elves, I don’t know why.\r<br />\r<br />Skin options are sorted in CK as follows.  Each having nine pedicure/manicure options.\r<br />\r<br />Options--------------Pubic Hair---------Areola--------------------------Pedicure/Manicure Options\r<br />==============================================================================           \r<br />Blonde---------------White--------------Normal (Default CBBE)--------Clear\r<br />Brunette-------------Black--------------Darker----------------------------Black\r<br />Chestnut-------------Brown-------------Dark------------------------------Blue\r<br />Ginger----------------Red----------------Pale------------------------------Green\r<br />Honey----------------Yellow(ish)--------Dark-----------------------------Pink\r<br />Pale------------------Shaved-------------Pale-----------------------------Red\r<br />Normal--------------Shaved-------------Normal--------------------------Rose\r<br />Dark-----------------Shaved-------------Dark------------------------------Stripe\r<br />Darker---------------Shaved-------------Darker---------------------------White\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Note: I called Hot Pink, Rose, because I felt having Pink listed twice in the same category was too confusing.\r<br />\r<br />If you are familiar with CK the following should be all you need.\r<br />Open CK,\r<br />File - Data.  To edit Vanilla NPCs find Female Skin.esm and double click to set the X and click [OK].    \r<br />                   Or find Female Skin.esm and double click to set the X, then select a follower mod to edit, highlight it and [Set as Active File], then click [OK].\r<br />Right side select, Actor - Actors\r<br />Select the Female NPC of your choice (clicking the, [Form ID] Tab, will bring modded followers to the top of the list).\r<br />Select the, Traits Tab\r<br />Near the middle under Race find the, Skin pulldown menu.\r<br />Select the skin, as in the list above, each with (9) nine pedicure/manicure options (81 total options).\r<br />\r<br />For further help and information see the PDF Guide available for download.\r<br /> \r<br />\r<br />***Warning***  The Nexus has seen fit to give Mod Authors a Troll Bat which I will use without remorse or forgiveness.\r<br />\r<br />If you find an obvious error, such as blue manicure/red pedicure, by all means let me know.  \r<br />If you have [b][i][u]useful[/u][/i][/b] ideas on how to improve the functionality of the mod by all means post a comment.  \r<br />If you have issues, please give some details.  Telling me,[i] It doesn’t work you need to fix it[/i], just isn’t useful information.  \r<br />If you need clarification on some point I covered in the PDF Guide that left you confused, please comment or send me a PM and I will be happy to work with you.  \r<br />\r<br />Comments concerning issues addressed by the PDF Guide (meaning you didn’t read it) will be answered as such.  \r<br />Comments like, I don’t like the way it looks, will be ignored.  \r<br />Any post with, [url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ID10T]ID Ten T Errors[/url], will be deleted.  \r<br />++++++++[Example of an ID Ten T Error; &#34;I&#39;m using the UNP body and this looks like hell, you really need fix this&#33;&#34;]++++++++\r<br />Comments like; I&#39;m offended by this mod, you suck, you’re a perv, you denigrate women, etc., will get the Troll Bat.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Tools used:\r<br />\r<br />Creation Kit\r<br />TESsnip 4.4.2a (Skyrim Editon) \r<br />TES5Edit (mod has been cleaned and checked with TES5Edit)\r<br />Caliente’s Texture Blender\r<br />Adobe Photoshop\r<br />Gimp\r<br />\r<br />Asset Credits\r<br />\r<br />Assets from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666]Caliente&#39;s Beautiful Bodies Edition[/url] (CBBE Body, Hands and Feet.
