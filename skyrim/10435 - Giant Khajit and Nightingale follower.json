  "summary": "",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a really epic Khajit follower in Nightingale Armor and is a level 30. Has the most advanced fighting system in the game.  Uses Magic and a custom enchanted sword I made. Will post sword by itself by request.  Follower is 3 times the size of normal Khajit and is essential.\r\n\r\nLocation: Inside Whiterun Stables\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs: May start off in Whiterun Guard Armor.\r\nFIX: Just ask to trade items and then take away the Guard armor and Nightingale will appear. \r\n\r\nLeave any questions in the comments.",
