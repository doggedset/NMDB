  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]This is a body mod that seems to have been neglected by its original creator (MegaLov) on another modding website (Lovers-Lab), link to original thread in the credits).Â \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;The creator has been offline for over 2 years and this body has been sitting around with next to no armor conversions whilst users have been requesting conversions.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Though I am unsure as to how the modder created the body the fact that it is label CBBE led me to believe that it BodySlider. But any CBBE textures will work (since I am using a few myself).\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;However I am not versed in using BodySlide so I am un-able to confirm this, and saldy no armor until the Version 1.1 is released, Sorry. (Though help to get armor created would be greatly appreciated.)[/size]",
