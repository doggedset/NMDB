  "modName": "No redundant perks",
  "summary": "This mod doesn\\'t add perks, This mod takes them away!  This mod changes the game so that your SKILL level is responsible for how much damage you do or how much magicka your spell uses or what your armour protects, rather than Perks like \\\"armsman\\\" or \\\"novice destruction\\\" ",
  "descriptionHtml": "NEW VERSION HERE- http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14244 With redesigned modularity and removed of flaws. \r\n\r\nSkyrim\\'s perk system went through many a revision, It shows that the final one wasn\\'t thought out well!  I found that i couldn\\'t realy spend perk points on interesting perks, such as bladesman or rune mastery because i had to spend perks on \\\"adept destruction\\\" or \\\"armsman\\\" to keep up with the leveling.  In vanilla settings someone with a hundred skill and no perks does worse than 20 skill and two perks, this mod changes that too. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn simple terms\r\n\r\nVanilla marksman- 100 skill level + 5 perks in overdraw = 300% damage\r\nMy mod\\'s marksman - 100 skill level= 300% damage, those 5 perk points can be put to better use!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat this mod currently does\r\n\r\nRemoved armsman, barbarian,juggernaut,whatever light armour\r\ns starting perk was and overdraw. Now your skill increases at the same level as an npc.  This probably scales at the same rate as vanilla\\'s 100 skill and all 5 perks. \r\n\r\nRemoved all of the Novice/apprentice/adept/expert/master perks in the spell department, Magica use scales similarly to npcs. \r\n\r\nEnchanting and alchemy have been altered, These are subject to change... I haven\\'t removed the alchemy perks (self control is key) and enchanting (which starts weaker than vanilla and ends up stronger) ... i was a little adventerous. These will Evolve to perfection (or die.. VIVA LA EVOLUTION!!) \r\n\r\nAll the other skills have not been tampered with, as i am unsure of what to change. There will be change. IT IS TIME FOR CHANGE!! \r\n\r\n\r\nAs always with my mods, feed me back! If you find something that isn\\'t tweaked right,, tell me! Don\\'t worry though, you get your old perks back after removal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- My other mod-  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9185",
