  "descriptionHtml": "[b]OVERVIEW:[/b]\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nWelcome to my second mod! I made this mod as a personal project when I realized the Ebony Armor was the only set befitting my character, but she was specialized in Light Armor. Dilemma! After scouring Nexusmods for a mod offering a separate, Light Armor version, I found all of them only replaced the existing Heavy Armor -- no good for my character\\'s follower, who used the Heavy set.\r\n\r\nA quick and dirty fix was to copy the Heavy armor and just set it to Light, but then I thought, why not share this mod with the rest of the world? Fix it up a little to have it work well?\r\n\r\nAbout an hour of cursing and digging around later, I figured out how to make everything craftable and adjusted the weight and armor rating of the set to balance it out. And here we are, with a perfect working Ebony Armor set that looks exactly the same, but can be worn by Light Armor skilled characters. ;)\r\n\r\nThe Ebony crafting skill is required, of course, but other than that nothing special has been edited or otherwise added. Let me know if anything doesn\\'t work and I\\'ll see if I can fix it up, but I haven\\'t run into any issues as of yet.\r\n\r\n[b]RECOMMENDED:[/b]\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8225]Amazing Ebony Armor Redone Fix[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]INSTALLATION:[/b]\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nCopy the ArmorEbonyLight.esp into your Skyrim\\\\Data folder.\r\nOpen the launcher, click on Data Files and make sure ArmorEbonyLight.esp is checked.\r\n\r\n[b]REQUIREMENTS:[/b]\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nNone other than Skyrim.\r\n\r\n[b]COMPATIBILITY & CONFLICTS:[/b]\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nNo known conflicts. Please note that any retexture of the Heavy armor will also affect the Light armor.",
