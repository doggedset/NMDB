  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]DESCRIPTION[/size]\r<br />\r<br />When you first started the game and killed the dragon near Whiterun, you probably had a very low carry weight limit although you really wanted to take the dragon scales and bones from this dragon, because dragon armor and weapons are really good in this game, but when you saw how much they weigh, you just gave up? (Or edited its limit via the console)\r<br />well this helps you and simply makes dragon bones and scales weightless.\r<br />I know this is really simple, and you could just do it by the Creation Kit, but, i made it anyways.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]COMPATIBILITY[/size]\r<br />\r<br />This mod is compatible with any mods that change the textures/ change the meshes of dragon bones and scales. \r<br />\r<br />[size=4]REQUIREMENTS\r<br />\r<br />[/size]This mod needs Skyrim 1.932 or higher (Sorry but i never tested it on other versions of the game).\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]PERMISSION[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Also I want to mention, that you have full permission to edit/publish it however, whenever and wherever you want. (Not much to edit though :P )\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]ALSO\r<br />\r<br />[/size]For anyone here that doesn&#39;t want to download this change (which is completely fine), here is how you change your character&#39;s carry weight limit:\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]Step 1[/color]: Open the console by clicking on this button: ~ which is to the left of 1/&#33; buttons.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]Step 2[/color]: Inside the console, type this command: player.forceav carrryweight (the limit you want it to be :P-only numbers)\r<br />\r<br />Notes: It can be player.setav as well, but i recommend using forceav so it force it both the change and the saving of the new value.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]OPTIONAL\r<br />\r<br />[/size]I&#39;ve added two optional files:\r<br />[color=#ff0000]a[/color]. Optional-only x2 value= This file set dragon bones and scales&#39;s weight to default, though it doubles their value. For example: \r<br />\r<br />Default dragon bone value: 500 gold\r<br />New dragon bone value: 1000 gold\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]b[/color]. Optional- weightless dragon bones and scales plus x2 value= This file makes dragon bones and scales weightless, but also doubles their value. For example:\r<br />\r<br />Default dragon bone value: 500 gold\r<br />New dragon bone value: 1000 gold\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]EXTRA NOTES\r<br />\r<br />[/size][color=#ff0000]a[/color]. Don&#39;t activate/download two files or they will mess up each other (I think they will anyways).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]b. [/color]By the way, the value of dragon scales: 600 gold, is not a math mistake, I just thought like dragon scales deserve this value. If you want me to edit and make their (dragon scales) really doubled, leave a comment about it.",
