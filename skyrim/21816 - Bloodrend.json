  "descriptionHtml": "===== What is it? =====\r\nIts a standalone retexture of the silver greatsword and sword with added new scabbard intended for a vampire or vampire hunter player. Goes great with my Vampguard Armor. Has absorb health enchantment added (you know \\\"sword of hunger\\\"). \r\n\r\n===== Changelog =====\r\n3.00 - Cleaned up file (Where is 2.00? Be quiet! Nobody cares)\r\n1.00 - Inital Release\r\n\r\n===== Known Issues =====\r\nSlight clipping of greatsword through scabbard on backside, this was done intentionally as I have yet to learn 3D modeling and so could not change shape of sword/scabbard to fit perfectly. My rational being that people shouldn\\'t notice it that much if the clipping was not facing them. \r\n\r\n==== How do you get it? =====\r\nCraftable under \\\"Ebony\\\" Category at Forge. Improve at Grindstone.\r\n\r\n===== To Do List =====\r\nTexture updates\r\nBug fixes\r\nAdd lore\r\n\r\n===== Installation =====\r\nCopy the Data folder in your Skyrim folder\r\nActivate the either Bloodrend.esp or BloodrendNoDLC.esp in the launcher.\r\n\r\nDeinstallation\r\n-----------------\r\nDelete esp and associated texture/meshes.\r\n",
