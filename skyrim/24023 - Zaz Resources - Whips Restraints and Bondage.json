  "descriptionHtml": "                                                      ***WARNING***\r\n\r\nThis mod contains strong sexual references, bondage & flogging animations do not download if you are sensitive to these things, download at your own discretion.\r\n\r\n[youtube]3CNs39gBi4Y[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[u]Description[/u]\r\n\r\nAdds 7 whips: Crop, crop small, crop triple, birch, cane ,paddle, paddle small all craftable under iron. 14 movable restraints/cages. 8 bondage poses.\r\n\r\n[u]Requirements[/u]\r\n\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11811]FNIS[/url] 3.0/3.1 for skyrim 1.6, 3.2+ for 1.7+\r\n-After Installing the ZazResources mod run \\\"GenerateFNISforUsers.exe\\\" as administrator if you have windows vista/7+ > Update FNISBehavior > consistence check  \r\n-OPTIONAL: must have \\\"perfect 3-2\\\" [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11064]this[/url] mod for hands to line up to objects\r\n\r\n[u]Installing/Uninstalling/Updating[/u]\r\n\r\n-Install using NMM(recommended) or drop files into data folder\r\n-uninstall using NMM or delete all related files\r\n-update by uninstalling old version then install new version\r\n \r\n[u]How to Use[/u]\r\n\r\n-You should have 3 new spells: zaz spell selector, zaz npc idles & zaz player idles. Equip & cast spell selector to select which poses/objects you want. Equip & cast npc idle spell on an npc if you want an npc to be in the restraints (works on all human & beast races male & female) otherwise use player idle spell to cast on yourself.\r\n-Objects can go through other objects so you can use the tc command to move npcs around and make the objects look like they\\'re attached to walls.\r\n-for best results use whips on followers :).\r\n\r\n[u]Helpful Commands[/u]\r\n\r\nSome of the commands require you to click on the npc you want to use the commands on then enter the command in the console which you open with the ~ key. Re-enter the command to undo the command. Make sure you are close enough to the npc when you click them because sometimes you might click on fog or a different npc and the command won\\'t work.\r\n\r\ntai - freezes the npc so they won\\'t move around and they won\\'t budge if you hit them but they cannot talk/grunt and you cannot talk to them untill you disable the command.\r\n\r\ntdetect - stops the npc from looking at you.\r\n\r\ntc - (must be in 3rd person view) take control of the npc so they mimic your movements. Use this command on an npc and jump to remove restraints/poses or just power attack the npc untill they stumble.\r\n\r\nrecycleactor - resets the npc to their default position and returns them to their original state.\r\n\r\n[u]Known Issues[/u]\r\n\r\n-npcs sometimes won\\'t equip whips (to fix this remove all weapons from their inventory then re-equip whip)\r\n-no inventory models for objects\r\n-objects float and can\\'t interact with if dropped\r\n-the idle was left empty on purpose if actor stands like a mannequin\r\n-the spells don\\'t work on enemies\r\n\r\n***If you know how to make restraints line up with the vanilla skeleton and want to help me out please do and I will add you in the credits.\r\n***If you know how to fix these issues please help me out and I will credit you. Keep in mind this is my first mod.\r\n\r\n[u]Credits[/u]\r\n\r\nMost of the credit goes to mastercchris & xaz, I just put it all together and made an esp so the animobjects used a different spell and made the whips craftable, improved sound, removed blood and some small tweaks to make it overall better.\r\n\r\nmastercchris - Whips, animations, whip sound, animobjects, cages, restraints, textures\r\n\r\nxaz - bondage idles\r\n\r\nfore - helpful tutorial and his FNIS mod.\r\n\r\n[u]Changelog[/u]\r\n\r\n-1.1\r\nnew whip(paddle small), 2 new objects: xcross & wooden horse, named & organized the spells better, new textures.\r\n\r\n-1.1a\r\nbirch, cane & crop now work properly when dropped; shorter names for some spells.\r\n\r\n[u]Mods Used In MY screenshots[/u]\r\n*use search bar on this site\r\n\r\nGraphics- Post Process Fxaa Injector\r\n\r\nFaces- Coverwomen 1, Ashen Race.\r\n\r\nHair- apachiiskyhair, Hair packs of Fallout3, lovely hairstyles.\r\n\r\nBody- CBBEv3 with Bodyslide, UNP BLESSED, Acdale, Athletic Muscle, CBBE skin texture V2 V3 plus.",
