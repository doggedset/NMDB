  "descriptionHtml": "No longer will you have to recharge your weapons with this simple mod! Unlimited charges forever! \r\n\r\nIf you hate having to constantly keep recharging your weapons / stay on top of soul trapping and all that jazz, look no further than this mod!\r\n\r\nAfter launching the game with the mod all weapons with enchantments will have unlimited charges! \r\n\r\nExtremely simple.\r\n\r\nI suppose this breaks the game slightly though since it totally goes against the original design of enchanted weapons, this mod basically destroys the original concept of crafting weapons, not having to worry about the power of the enchants vs. charge numbers. But, oh well. Naturally this also makes the game easier, so crank dat difficulty up.\r\n\r\nRevision 2 fix by Steam user: jh90389 - Big thanks to him!",
