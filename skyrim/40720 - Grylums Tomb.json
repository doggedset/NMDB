  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new dungeon to Skyrim. Radiant Quests can make the most of it and it is located just west of Riverwood. Anyone that has followed the Level-design tutorial on creationkit.com will recognize its location and entrance appearance. \r\n\r\nGrylum\\'s Tomb is a unique dungeon with a dark history. The upper levels are occupied by a cult of warlocks that keep the lower levels under lock and key. It takes an Expert locksmith to access the crypt below and an adept player to defeat the boss within. \r\n\r\nAll enemies are leveled but attempting the dungeon if your character is straight out of Helgen would be quite the ballzy move. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy! Please rate it if you would like to see more mods from me :) \r\n\r\nBONUS MATERIAL! \r\nHead to Mixwater Mill if you want to do the short quest I\\'ve thrown in this MOD. Speak to Beznu in the Workers House. \r\n\r\nP.S This is my first mod so any feedback would be AWESOME!!!!",
