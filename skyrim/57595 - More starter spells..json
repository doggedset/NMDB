  "modName": "More starter spells.",
  "summary": "Makes PC start with most novice spells, a few apprentice spells, and have the option to start out with destruction spells of the frost or lightning element rather than fire- choose the esp of your wanted element. Use only ONE ESP.\r<br />\r<br />Also (optional) NoHeal esps for those who don&#39;t wanna start with healing abilities",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever get annoyed by the widely perpetuated stereotype that all mages are FIRE mages? Or that ALL mages have healing abilities as well?\r<br />\r<br />Personally, as an electromancer myself, I find that offensive, and will not stand for this non-sense in which cryomancers, and electromancers, as well as other variety of casters are just forgotten while the fire mages get all the attention- as if they&#39;re somehow more important the the rest of us&#33; NO more are fireballs and heals the fundamental roots of all magic&#33; No more do you have to go buy a spell tome, just to get very basic low level spells.\r<br />\r<br />I made this mod in part, because I like the scarcity mod, with only one tiny problem: I HAVE to use fire and healing spells for what seems like an eternity, plus I couldn&#39;t start out with having a fear spell. The esps are fairly self explanatory, here&#39;s what they add...\r<br />\r<br />All Versions: Candlelight, Oakflesh, Magelight, Bound Sword, Bound Bow, Soul Trap, Raise Zombie, Bound Battle Axe, Clairvoyance, Courage, Calm, Fear, Fury, Muffle. \r<br />\r<br />Cryomancer versions: The starter destro spells instead of flames, Frost Bite, and Icy Spike.\r<br />Pyromancer versions: The starter destro spells are Flames, and Firebolt. \r<br />Electromancer versions: The starter destro spells are Sparks and Lightning Bolt. \r<br />\r<br />NoHeal versions simply make it where you start out with no healing spells, in the other versions you still start with the the same healing spell (Healing) you normally start out with, in addition to Healing Hands which heals non-player characters. This doesn&#39;t use any assets from other mods, although I did create this in part to combine well with the scarcity mod, for people who like having fewer items from merchants, but also don&#39;t want to be forced to start out as stereotypical fire/healer mages.\r<br />\r<br />I ALSO made this mod, because I looked all around for a mod like this, but no mod like it existed, and I had no way to enjoy the scarcity mod like I wanted to, cause I hated being forced to be a garden variety fire+healing mage. I&#39;m also positive many people feel the same so I released various versions of this mod here.\r<br />\r<br />This does NOT alter the spells in any way, it just changes what spells the player character starts out with.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility issues: This mod alters the &#34;player&#34; actor in the Creation Kit, specifically the spell list, so if any other mods alter starting spells by altering the player actors list they might conflict with this mod.",
