  "summary": "Ever got tired seeing thiefs, who are trying to rob you blind on your travels on the main roads, wear expensive stuff like elven armor, elven guilded armor and even glass armor?\r\n\r\nNot anymore they will! This mod limits them to simple armors.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I got tired of those simple robbers doning themselves in shiny armor like elven, elven guilded or even glass. In my current playthrough it was a thief like that who provided me with my first ever elven armor and this should not happen in my opinion. \r\n\r\nThink the same? Then this mod is for you.\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n     [b]1. DESCRIPTION[/b]\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nThis mod changes the armor the roadside thieves can wear and limits it to rather normal stuff out of three reasons:\r\n\r\n1.) It is very unlikely for a normal thief to be able to obtain elven armor, let alone elven guilded armor or even glass armor. For obtaining the latter such an individual would have to take on, for instance, Thalmor, all by his own.\r\n\t\r\n2.) Even if we asume for a moment that he is capable enough, he would probably not wear it in public. Any kind of shiny, expensive looking armor is unsuited for a thief who hides in the bushes. It looks out of place.\r\n\t\r\n3.) Any faction armor was deleted from their leveled lists aswell. Doning yourself in imperial armor in a hold that is Stormcloak teritory? Not a very bright idea. Yet still imperial armor in all its variations was part of the vanilla leveled lists for thieves!\r\n\t\r\n[u]Summary[/u] of armors which were deleted from the thieves leveled lists (armor, boots, gloves):\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]elven, elven gilded\r\n[*]glass\r\n[*]any kind of imperial armor\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n      [b]2. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN[/b]\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nEither download it with the Nexus Mod Manager and install it\r\n\r\nOr download it manually, extract to the Skyrim folder and activate the \\\"roadsidethief_simple_armor.esp\\\" in the launcher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n     [b]3. UN-INSTALLING THE PLUGIN[/b]\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nDisable and erase the mod from the Nexus Mod Manager list, or when you downloaded it manually...\r\n\r\n...simply erase the disable and erase the \\\"roadsidethief_simple_armor.esp\\\" and any other stuff from the mod (check the archive\r\nto see which files it included).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n     [b]4. COMPATIBILITY[/b]\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nThis mod directly changes three leveled lists of the ordinary roadside thief. So the changes are very little.\r\n\r\nObviously, any other mod that does the same changes is incompatible to this one. Read the section \\\"Mod Load Order\\\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n     [b]5. LOAD ORDER[/b]\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nI\\'d recommend this to be somewhere at the start of the load-order, before any other item-mod, or NPC mod.\r\n\r\nIt is a rather uncritical, unimportant mod (no self-pun here, just my way of bowing down in front of the modding elite ^^) \r\nand in case of incompatibility you\\'d rather have a more important mod to take priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n     [b]6. VERSION HISTORY[/b]\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n- changes 3 leveled lists (armor, boots and gloves) for roadside thieves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n     [b]7. COPYRIGHT[/b]\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nWell...it\\'s really a simple mod, isn\\'t it. If you want to use it, include it or do anything else just do it. \r\n\r\nIf you directly take the files it would be fair to credit me though.",
