Sirin's father, Tomar Sonat, was a blacksmith\n<br />and metal shaper hailing from Markarth, who served for a time in the employ of\n<br />the Jarl until it was rumored that he was revealing overheard state secrets to\n<br />certain suspected leaders of the Forsworn revolution conspiracy faction.\n<br />Fleeing the city under cover of night, he barely escaped the Jarl's executioner\n<br />and fled northward into the western borderlands. Whether or not he was guilty,\n<br />would have been irrelevant. Leaving the Reach was his only option. Upon\n<br />stumbling across Creshoal, a small town buried in the mountains, and finding\n<br />it's inhabitants to be unbiased about his situation, he settled there and\n<br />changed his surname to Gassil (his mother's maiden name). Here he met and\n<br />married a good looking Dumner woman named Ayasa Gulbani, whose parents were\n<br />traded to a wealthy local as slaves by a greedy merchant from Morrowind for the\n<br />price of six horses and 1000 gold. Sirin inherited her mother's good looks and\n<br />her father's Nord skintones, although she sports a full head of black hair. She\n<br />has her mother's Dunmer eyes, but slightly pink instead of red, and her\n<br />mother's pointed ears. But she has her father's very human face, fair skin, and\n<br />slightly aggravated disposition.            Taught to defend herself at an earlyage, Sirin is proficient with a bow and can wield twin katanas like child's\n<br />play. Her mother taught her the art of alchemy and magic, so she is self\n<br />sufficient and very deadly. But when her parents died from a sudden sub-zero\n<br />storm that produced an inescapable avalanche, Sirin at the age of twenty-\n<br />three, went forth on her own. Alas, she quickly found that Skyrim as a whole\n<br />was mostly prejudiced against anyone with Dunmer features, dark or light. Even\n<br />the Dunmer themselves avoided associating with 'lightskins' or 'half-breed\n<br />Dunmer'.  Sirin developed a keen sense\n<br />of  awareness and managed to avoid\n<br />trouble while looking for her niche. She eventually ended up in Windhelm, where\n<br />there was a large Dunmer population, and temporarily settled there. They accept\n<br />her for what she is, but show her no privilege or special consideration. She\n<br />goes outside the gates to hunt for food, and makes enough selling pelts to buy\n<br />a little mead to keep the chill out of her bones. Having no defined direction\n<br />in life, she heard a story while sipping a mead at an inn. It told of a legend\n<br />called the Dragonborn, and it is beleived that a new Dragonborn has arisen. She\n<br />somehow knows she is destined to meet and serve the Dragonborn with her unique\n<br />skills. But how does she find this legend of Skyrim? Is the Dragonborn real? It\n<br />is rumored this dragon slayer stops over now and again in Windhelm whilst\n<br />traveling to Solsteim. Now she patiently waits at Candlehearth Hall,\n<br />contemplating what she must do to find this new age hero. Should she wander\n<br />aimlessly looking for this godlike idol? Perhaps the Dragonborn might enter\n<br />Candlehearth Hall and take note of her. She wonders how long she will have to\n<br />wait.  ___________________________________________________________________ [i] [/i][i] [/i][i] [/i][i]NOTE: The fancy armor Sirin is wearing iscalled [b]Raven Witch[/b]. If you wantSirin to look like the screenshots, you will have to download the armor mod [b](Raven Witch Armor and Apex Werewolf -Raven Witch)[/b] by Zerofrost on the Nexus. I personally think this armor modis appropriate and gives Sirin a boatload of class. The armor is practical and\n<br />functional, looks amazing and comes with accessories such as a cape and a mask.\n<br />One of the best light armors I have seen. Full endorsement by me. You can get\n<br />the earrings by downloading HN66's mod on the Nexus [b](HN66s Earrings_1_5)[/b]. I think they are a great asset to her looks.There are silver as well as gold earrings.[/i] EQUIPMENT:Sirin has default basic leather light armor; cuirass and boots only, and she\n<br />uses vanilla body textures. But, you will need ApachiiHair.esm,\n<br />ApachiiHairFemales.esm, and ApachiiHairStyles.esp, otherwise she will be bald.  She has an Ebony bow, two katanas, and somemage skills including sustained ward and lightning shock. When in sneak mode\n<br />she will become invisible to enemies. She will level with the player and is\n<br />also a healer. She has no other weapons by default, so you have to give them to\n<br />her. She iscompatible with EFF and Convenient Horses. I have not tested her with any other\n<br />follower control mods. Her defaultbehavior is aggressive, although she will not jump in front of you and steal\n<br />your glory. Nor does she start fights, but she certainly will finish them. She\n<br />is warrior class by default. Sirin is nota yakker. She will not blather on about trivial or meaningless topics. She uses\n<br />vanilla even-toned voice dialogs, so you won't be talking a lot. She is\n<br />available for marriage. She can be found hanging out at Candlehearth Hall in\n<br />Windhelm.  [i]NOTE: This is my very first follower mod,and I'm sure there are mistakes somewhere, so take it easy on me, ok? I don't\n<br />mind constructive criticism, but, if I see a \"WTF\" post, just know\n<br />right now you'll get no response from me. [b]Imake no guarantees![/b] If she doesn't work for you, I'll see what I can do,but I am limited by my inexperience. She is not an uber follower so don't\n<br />expect miracles from her. Otherwise, play with her, amuse yourself. She is\n<br />loyal and resiliant. She is essential so you can't kill her. You could disable\n<br />her though, but I wouldn't. I can look at that face for years to come.[/i][i] [/i][i]English only. Not compatible with SkyrimSE. All DLCs should be installed. SKSE is not required, but recommended. Unzip\n<br />this file into your Skyrim data folder. You can also use Nexus Mod Manager. I\n<br />don't have Mod Organizer, but I'm sure it will do just as well. Also, I have\n<br />not uploaded this to Steam because of reported problems with their servers. [/i]",
