  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guys, I feel so thankful for all the modders out there adding major or minor things to Skyrim that make this game so amazing to play, and I feel guilty for not being able to do anything back to the community. I suck at coding/graphic design, I tried using the CK but to no avail. \r\nTo give at least something back, I decided to upload this (old) savegame.\r\nThis savegame allows you to receive the \\\"One with the Shadows\\\" Achievement without having to do the long tedious questline with all the endless mini quests. Just talk to the girl in front of you, tell her Brynjolf had something for me and she\\'ll replace your gear with the Guild Master gear (and the Achievement included). I haven\\'t seen any savegame supporting this achievement, only Oblivion Walker, so I decided to make my own. \r\n\r\nF.A.Q.\r\nQ: How do I install this?\r\nA: Place in your Saves folder, which is located here :\r\nC:\\\\Users\\\\<YOUR NAME>\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves\r\n\r\nThat\\'s basically the only question you could have.\r\n\r\nPS: For the people who think this is a cheat: It\\'s not. I\\'m not forcing you to use this savegame, but I can understand that you don\\'t feel like spending hours to get the achievement, because it really demands some patience.",
