  "descriptionHtml": "Andragorn\\'s weapons: \r\n\r\n9 daggers + 6 bows\r\n\r\nNew weapons with a unique mixture between fantasy and realism, a high quality and lore-friendly addition to your Skyrim experience from low to high level. \r\n\r\nThis mod does not replace any weapons and adds the weapons to leveled lists so you can find them as you would find any other original weapons. You can also craft them at any forge. This mod adds a new shop in the world where you can buy all the weapons at any level, so if you want to cheat, you can, but it is your problem. However, this shop allows you to preview all the new weapons  this mod adds. Going to the shop is not required and you can ignore it.\r\n\r\nStandard Andragorn quality. Have fun.\r\n\r\n[img] http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/27615-1-1355305138.jpg [/img]\r\n\r\n[youtube]_Db_PGu1z4k[/youtube]\r\n[youtube]CD5jVUmQ1kg[/youtube]\r\nThis mod has been reviewed on Skyrim: Mods and More -- http://skyrimmodsandmore.blogspot.com/ \r\n-\r\n-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
