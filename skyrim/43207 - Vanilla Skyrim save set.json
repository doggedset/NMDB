You will be level 1. Use &#34;showracemenu&#34; to set your preferred race/appearance.  After you unpack the saves, place them into your Documents &gt; My Games &gt; Skyrim &gt; Saves folder, or wherever your save files are located.\r<br />I originally made these for myself. I&#39;ve hit that modding wall way to many times and got tired of restarting. I&#39;m glad so many of you are enjoying them as well. I will probably work on more saves such as the DLC campaigns. But here is the question. Would anyone enjoy a save with all of the Hearthfire homes built?\r<br />\r<br />If you want one with just Alduin dead &gt;&gt;Â http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30569/?",
