  "modName": "Wear Circlets with Hoods",
  "summary": "This is for the people who wanted me to add regular hoods to my previous mod allowing circlets with hooded robes. This allows you to wear circlets with any hood, including hooded robes. This is my third mod.",
  "descriptionHtml": "There are far too many hoods to list each one this applies to, but please let me know if I have missed any and I will be glad to add it ASAP.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n- There may be some clipping issues with smaller \\\"hoods\\\", such as the Thieves Guild hood.\r\n- This works with Dragonpriest masks as well, since they are considered \\\"circlets\\\" for some reason.\r\n- For my mod with just hooded robes, please visit: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12233 but you do not need it if you are already subscribed to this one.\r\n- This does NOT affect other modded hoods. If you would like to be able to do this with other people\\'s hoods, you will have to talk to the developer of those mods and request that they remove \\\"circlet\\\" from the highlighted slots in the item info.\r\n\r\nMy file on Steam:\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=13076\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n03/09/12\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nUsing the \\\"Weapon and Armor Fix\\\" mod changes the ability to wear a circlet with the Archmage Robes.  I have enabled it, again.\r\nNOTE!!!:  You must make sure that this mod is loaded AFTER the fixed mod (make sure it is further down in the list in the \\\"Data Files\\\")\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n03/02/12\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n- SO! I recently reported that there was a bug with the thieves guild armor, and I thought my mod had lost the textures. I have figured out that applying my change to \\\"Thieves Guild Hood Alt\\\" and \\\"Thieves Guild Variant Hood\\\" (both of which I\\'m pretty sure are not equippable, anyway) caused the CK to lose some of the thieves guild textures, for some reason. I have removed those changes, and now my mod is fully functional again! Please don\\'t stand too close to me, as I am flinging sweat off my forehead in every direction.",
