  "descriptionHtml": "====================================================================================================================================\r\nNastavnik\\'s StoneBlade Half Giants (Dungeon Siege Inspired [1 and 2.. 3 was rubbish])\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i837.photobucket.com/albums/zz293/TheTrueGeneral/ScreenShot15.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nRead everything before downloading. If you like the mod please remember to endorse so others can see it :P\r\n\r\nMy mod adds a new playable race the Half Giants based on Dungeon Siege Lore mixed with a little Spellforce to bring a new playable character to the game.\r\n\r\nI have added a female Half giant as my WoW gamer mates informed me there are female Half Giants on WoW. It also fixes my clothing bug. In the mod my brother and myself are making there will be no female half giants as Dungeon siege Lore stats half giants are an all male race The female is there purely for your own use and will be excluded from lore.  (It was either that or keep the females as orc women)\r\n\r\nThe mod runs without fault on my computer no CTD or Freeze. If yours does crash or freeze just reinstall skyrim from your backup and It should fix the problem. However the mod only adds a new race and doesnt alter anything so It shouldnt. If you find a bug or encounter a problem please let me know and Ill gladly work with you to fix it.\\\\\r\n\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\nCharacter Creation Side Note\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nAt the moment there are a few things you should know before installing the mod. When you start a new game and customising your Half Giant; you will only be given access to the first 5 human skin textures due to orc race having 5 basic. Do not worry pick one then once you have finished customising press ~ [tilde] then type [showracemenu] and recreate your half giant..You should only need to redo the scar, war paint and skin colour. You will now be given access to all 20 of the human skin colours [Redguard + nord/imperial/breton]. This bug I wasnt able to fix and I appologise for that I am constantly looking into it however as I have to redo my second year university maths exam aswell as work and study I shall be putting that bug on hold as it doesnt affect gameplay at all. If anyone knows any bugs please let me know and they will be looked into immediately.\r\n\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\nStats: \r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nStarting Stats:\r\n\r\nHeavy Armour: 25\r\nLight Armour: 20\r\nTwo Handed: 25\r\nSingle Handed: 20\r\nArchery: 20\r\nSmithing: 20\r\nBlock: 25\r\n\r\nAll the rest are 15.\r\n\r\nStarting Health is 100 not 50\r\nStarting Mana is default 50\r\nStarting Stamina is 75 not 50\r\n\r\nMax Carry Weight is 450 (Due to their size it made sense)\r\n\r\nHealth Regen is 1.5 not 0.7 \r\n\r\nRace Height is 1.25 for Male; 1.2 for Female\r\n\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\nRacial Ability and Power\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nBlessing of the mountain: \r\nPassive: 50% immunity to magic and 50% immunity to disease and is 1.25x as tall as the nords giving them an elevation of 9.5ft (halfgiant lore puts them at 10ft tall).\r\n\r\nWrath Of The Ancestors:\r\nOnce a day Power: For 30 seconds the racial power causes the player to unleash a warcry (nord) that causes nearby units to flee whilst sending the player in a frenzy (berzerk) increasing damage delt and decreasing taken by half as well as increasing health regen by 5x and stamina regen by 25x.\r\n\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\n[IMG]http://i837.photobucket.com/albums/zz293/TheTrueGeneral/ScreenShot12.jpg[/IMG]\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\nMessage from Vil:\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nFor individuls who think this overpowered.. 30 seconds is half the duration of the powers of the other races (60 seconds), histkin does 10x not 5x and the redguards ability does 50x not 25x. Thus whilst making you a devastating tank it only lasts half aslong as other races; However I will negotiate and compromise on what you the public feel is a more \\\"levelled\\\" number if you so deem it over powered however do keep in mind, the magically innert and tank like nature of the class.\r\n\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\nLatest Version + Updates:\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nLatest Version V: 4.0\r\n\r\nV: 1.0 [Beta Version]\r\nV: 2.0 [Clothing merger bug fixed]\r\nV: 3.0 [Human skin colours]\r\nV: 4.0 [Finished]\r\n\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\nKnown Bugs: \r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\n1 - Skin Texture only offers 5 out of 20:\r\nWhen creating your half giant; Only the first 5 out of 20 human skin colours are accessable. This is probably due to the Orc race used as the base model having only 5 skin colours. To fix this Create your half giant like you normally would a nord and pick any one of the skin colours doesnt matter which. then name your character. Whilst the imperial is talking to his sergeant. Press [tilde] then recreate your half giant. You should only need to redo the scar, Warpaint and you will now be given access to all 20 human skin colours. I appologise for this inconvenience If you know a fix for it I would be greatful.\r\n\r\n2- Beady eyes\r\nOnce the character has been made, the eyes may shrink back to 1.04 ORC scale. Going to console [Tilde] then [showracemenu] like the above issue should fix it.\r\n\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\n",
