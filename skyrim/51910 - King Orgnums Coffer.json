  "descriptionHtml": "About: \r<br />*This mod is intended as a cheat mod for players who need to get some gold quickly. \r<br />*It is lore friendly as it is an actual object in the world of Elder Scrolls. \r<br />*You cannot keep getting gold as the legend goes, you need to be the owner of the coffer to get infinate gold. \r<br />*Smart players will be able to find some more gold in the chest. \r<br />\r<br />Lore: \r<br />King Orgnum&#39;s Coffer is a small-sized chest, ordinary in appearance, and remarkably light, almost weightless. Once a day, the Coffer will create gold from naught, and when King Orgnum himself possessed the Coffer, the supply within was limitless. King Orgnum&#39;s Coffer is no longer in his possession, and those who have found it since report that the Coffer eventually disappears after having dispersed enough gold to shame even the wealthiest of merchants. Where and why it vanishes is still a mystery. \r<br />\r<br />Suggestions: \r<br />If you wish there to be some more effort into getting the chest for example a boss to fight or the key is hidden in a different area, then please let me know. \r<br />\r<br />Bugs: \r<br />None so far \r<br />\r<br />Incompatible: \r<br />No mods so far.
