This mod aims to change that.\r<br />New AI Packages have been given to the newly added NPCs so they can live in their new homes, because their old homes.... never existed. Such as Irontree Mill, which was gonna be home to two unused NPCs. Enjoy the mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />See how many Now-Added NPCs you can find&#33;",
