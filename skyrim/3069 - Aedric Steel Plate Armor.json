  "descriptionHtml": "****************************\r\nThe Moment Of Light\r\n****************************\r\nHello all, first of all let me just apologize for any bad English, Portuguese here :)\r\n\r\nThis is a RE-texture of the Vanilla Steel Plate Armor.\r\n\r\nI wondered after getting inside the Azura star that we still have our good friends from Oblivion Realm In Skyrim (Deadra), Also wondered why are they Armored to the Teeth with a Amazing Dark looking Deadric armor provided from they\\'re gods, and we are not?\r\n\r\nWell now you can be. \r\n\r\nNot as powerfull as the Deadric armour, Still the same values of the original version, but with a Silver Shiny plate, trimmed with Orange gold, carved from the mount Olympus itself ;) kinda...\r\n\r\nDeadra will now think twice before marching against you while wearing this set of armor.\r\n\r\n****************************\r\nInstallation\r\n****************************\r\nExtract the DATA folder to your Skyrim directory, Should be:\r\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim \r\n\r\n****************************\r\nUninstall \r\n****************************\r\nIF not appreciated or preferring the older Steel Plate Armor just delete the files inside:\r\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\Armor\\\\nordplate\r\n\r\n****************************\r\nCredits\r\n****************************\r\nThis Mod was crated by Rubenp (ME), its free to use and not for resell (not that good anyway :P ) if added in other mods please just give me credit for it, thanks\r\n\r\n****************************\r\nIMPORTANT\r\n****************************\r\nEnjoy ;)",
