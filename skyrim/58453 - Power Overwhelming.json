  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is a bunch of animations that I&#39;ve gathered from various mods and put together to make one awesome one.Â This mod Replaces the magic animations but can probably be used with Exclusive animation path. It uses a master spell casting animation combined with a hover mod. \r<br />\r<br />I am aware of one problem which is if you cast while moving backward right/backward left so try to avoid that. It seems unfixable, but you have to try and find it to notice it really.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod, thanks to all the modders making these and I hope you all like it (=\r<br />\r<br />I take no credit for the individual animations that make up this mod.\r<br />\r<br />Special Thanks to:\r<br />YY Anim Replacer-Mystic Knight by yukl\r<br />Hover Animation by 1001001",
