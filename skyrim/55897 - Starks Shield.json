Used by clan named Starks. \r<br />I decide to do this shield simply because i like GOT and everything about it and because i like using shields in Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />It is not OP at all. You can craft it under studded category because i am sure that your steel category is allready overloaded same as mine :) \r<br />\r<br />I did this model from scratch but main texture i obviously found on internet.\r<br />It is my first model to skyrim and i believe it is ok but i would like to speak with somebody with more texturing experiences to look on handle on this shield. (it is my first model so handle texture looks a bit . . .wierd)\r<br />\r<br />In GOT it looks more like iron shield but i understand that there is not many players using iron weapons or armors for most of their playing time (steel smithing is unlocked once you get smithing skill to 20 so . . .)\r<br />And that is the reason why i decide to do this as a steel shield. (with dwarven shield cubemaps)\r<br />Backside is more iron (there is no usefull backside texture of this shield on internet) but that is all fine because to craft this shield you will need 1 iron ingot anyway. Together with 3 steel ingots and leather strips. (same crafting requirements as steel shield).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Big thanks to LeckerHamster for his tutorials on Youtube.\r<br />\r<br />[b][b]Permissions:\r<br />You are free to use any of my work in your mods, it&#39;d be nice to get credited if you do, but whatever, as long\r<br /> as your work benefits our community i&#39;m happy.[/b][/b]",
