  "descriptionHtml": "Vahlok is the only Dragon Priest without a mask, now I gave him one.\r<br />\r<br />Uses Dragonborn masks model, stats and is classified as heavy armor.\r<br />\r<br />Enchanted with Fortify Shouts 50% and Fortify Magicka 100 points, I think that is fair and useful for a Solstheim based mask you cant obtain early. It makes Dragon shouts more useful, especially those with long cooldowns, and extra magicka is useful for many types of characters.\r<br />\r<br />Requires:\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim 1.9\r<br />Dragonborn\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Extract VahloksMask.esp to your /Skyrim/Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Delete VahloksMask.esp to uninstall.",
