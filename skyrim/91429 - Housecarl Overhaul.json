  "modName": "Housecarl Overhaul",
  "summary": "In vanilla all Housecarls have boring steel plate armor and no perks to enhance their combat skills. Also their max level is capped at 50. This mod changes all of that. <br /><br />This is my first mod, I made it for myself then decided to upload it because why not.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[u][b]Description:[/b][/u] All housecarls are equipped with new armor and weapons. Perks are added where they made sense.\n<br />For Example Rayya of Falkreath now has Dual Flurry perk and Argis of Markarth is equipped with Dwarven Armor and Sword.\n<br /> Max level cap is at 81.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Requirements:[/b][/u] Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch.\n<br />[u][b]\n<br />Game balance/Immersion friendly[/b][/u]: 2 Housecarls have Nordic Carved Armor. I see Bandits roaming around with them all the time so I don't think it's too OP or game breaking.\n<br />\n<br />There is only one OP Armor though which is given to Jordis. [b]There is another version without it[/b]. So you can use that. \n<br />The only reason I did it is because it really looked good on her. Seriously that's the only reason.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Compatibility: [/b][/u]I am using this mod with [u]Extensible Follower Framework v4-0-2[/u] and have no issues. If you are using any follower overhaul mod just load this mod after that. It just edits armor and weapons so I don't think there will be any issues.",
