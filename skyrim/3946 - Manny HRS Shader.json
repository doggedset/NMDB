  "descriptionHtml": "Makes edges pop out, gives the visuals a crisp, \\\"hyper reality\\\" over sharpened look to the game.\r\nI have provided as many pictures as I can so you can get a good idea of what to expect.\r\n\r\nOne downside is that you will notice fonts do not look very crisp, I recommend trying a few different custom fonts as this cannot be avoided.\r\n\r\nInstallation: Place all files provided in the folder where TESV.exe is located.\r\nPlease Note: You may need to run Skyrim as an Administrator on Windows7 (IF the game crashes on startup)\r\n\r\nUninstall: Delete them as you would to remove the effect.\r\n\r\nHope you like it! I pretty much use it all the time, so I thought I\\'d share it.",
