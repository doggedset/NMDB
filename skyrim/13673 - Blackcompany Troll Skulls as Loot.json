  "descriptionHtml": "Mod Name: Troll Skull Trophies\r\n\r\nPurpose: To enhance immersion by making troll skull trophies available as loot from Dead \r\n\r\nTrolls/Frost Trolls. \r\n\r\n\r\n===================\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\n===================\r\n\r\nTroll skulls are now available as loot from dead Trolls/Frost Trolls. Note: You must kill the troll BEFORE the skull becomes available. The skull is on the Troll Deathitem list. For this reason, checking the inventory of a live troll via console just prior to running away from it, will not show the skull in the troll inventory. The troll must be dead in order to retrieve the skull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=================\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n\r\n=================\r\n\r\n-Data folder and activate\r\n\r\n-Load after anything else that modifies troll death lists\r\n\r\n\r\n==================\r\n\r\nSpecial Notes\r\n\r\n==================\r\n\r\nNeither the troll, nor the skull item, are altered in this mod. This mod only changes two leveled\r\n\r\nlists, DeathitemTroll and DeathitemTrollFrost.\r\n\r\n\r\n================\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n\r\n================\r\n\r\nFaraneth. He thought it up. I just moved the two items. Credit him, not me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n===============\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\n\r\n===============\r\n\r\n\r\n-C\\'mon, i moved two items to leveled lists. Do with it as you please. And please don\\'t feel like doing the same in your overhaul/tweaks is infringing on this idea. Go for it!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
