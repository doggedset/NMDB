  "descriptionHtml": "Hey there folks!! MisterB here. \n<br />I decided to share a small mod of mine, it's not much mind you, but perhaps more will happen if I can find more things to fix. \n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]What is \"Magical Tweaks\"[/b][/size][size=3][b]?[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]MageLight.[/b] Mage light is now a Novice spell and costs 20 magicka to cast.\n<br />[*][b]Candlelight.[/b] Candle Light is now an Apprentice spell and costs 33 magicka to cast.\n<br />[*][b]Telekinesis[/b] costs 55 magicka to cast now (instead of the normal 170).\n<br />[*][b]The vision of the Tenth Eye.[/b] This Adept level (alteration) spell is still a ritual. However, besides detecting the book, it detects invisible creatures in an area and serves as Night Eye for 2 minutes.  The spell costs 140 magicka to perform.\n<br />[*][b]Ward Spells. [/b]All ward spells have had their costs, cut almost in half. Following the progression of Lesser Ward (15 magicka), Steadfast Ward (30 magicka), and Greater (45 magicka). This will allow these spells to pretty much last twice as long, in the end, depending on your magicka pool.\n<br />[*][b]Clairvoyance. [/b]This spell is untouched, it would require a level of skill I don't know how to fix. \n<br />[/list]\n<br />Know of any other weird spells that can use tweaking? Let me know. \n<br />\n<br />If you like my content, check out my[size=4][url=https://www.patreon.com/Misterb1969] Patreon[/url][/size].  \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod was inspired by Fudgemuppets, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muR-3L66W_I]5 useless spells video[/url].\n<br />~",
