I also moved the two shacks from the mound where the Rams Head tavern sits -  those shacks were causing major problems with compatibility and now reside next to the new Owls Perch inn.\n<br />\n<br />I used version 0.3.6 of Whiterun Outskirts Market as versions after that had too many buildings and other extras that made patching nigh on impossible. Plus the later versions also tanked FPS. With my updated esp, you get a few market stalls in whiterun entrance, and everybody now lives in the new Owls Perch inn.\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#ffff00][size=4]Load Order and Requirements[/size][/color]\n<br />I load Immersive Whiterun and ETaC AFTER this plugin.\n<br /> This is just an .esp file that replaces the original.\n<br />It does not require ETaC or Immersive Whiterun.\n<br /> Make sure and go and endorse the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11534/?]original version[/url]. [/center] \n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[center][color=#ffff00][size=4]Bethesda, Lighting Bugs and Apathy\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]-LScW8G-C9c[/youtube][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center]FadingSignal (TrueStorms) said it best...\n<br />\n<br />[i]There are two distinct and horrendous limitations in Skyrim that still persist in Skyrim SE:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Max 4 shadow-casting lights in an entire cell (can can be worked around cleverly)\n<br />[*]Much worse is the 3 (or 4?) light limit -of any kind, shadow or not- shining on a single mesh.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />So basically, if you have something like the Winterhold College, where the entire hall is one single mesh, if you have more than 3 lights (even non-shadow lights) they will start to blink on and off as you look around. This completely cripples what can be done with lighting. If you have 3 or 4 candles around, you have to add 1 light in the middle of the room to compensate, for example. Mods like Enhanced Lights and FX have painstakingly worked around this, but it still has to deal with these crazy limitations.  Fallout 4 removed the limitations. I saw a vanilla cell that had 16 lights in a single room, for bounced light, little corner reflections, etc. What can be done with lights is incredible. I am not suggesting they re-write the engine to use Fallout 4's, I'm just using this as an example that those limitations were self-imposed for performance reasons (likely console.)Anyway, do you think this is something we could try and rally to have Bethesda implement before the shut the book on SE forever? It seems (keyword: seems) like it would be something simple in the rendering code that checks for number of lights. If they went about it cleanly this should be some sort of integer stored that they could update as opposed to something deep and hard-coded (but... you never know.)Just a thought. This would enable us to make Skyrim SE look truly next-gen[/i][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The new Owls Perch Inn is a new mesh, originally created by Stroti for Oblivion and imported and updated by Tamira. The interior is based on three levels and I have provided two versions of this mod to illustrate just how bad the lighting bug actually is and just how limiting it actually is. One version has bulbs to illuminate light sources, the other has less bulbs so the lighting bug doesn't occur.\n<br />\n<br />Due to the lighting limitations inherent in skyrim's engine a max of 4-6 bulbs can illuminate the same mesh before the engine bugs out and then switches others off.  I have placed bulbs at natural light-sources like candles, candelabra's, horn candles and fire pits. As you walk around the building you will notice just how bad this bug actually is. It's so distracting and ridiculous no one in there right mind could leave a situation like this. But Bethesda has. For six years.\n<br />\n<br />They have flat out ignored our repeated attempts to have this situation resolved, and despite making numerous reports to them on this issue, no response has been forthcoming.  The fact they choose to ignore this massive glaring issue speaks volumes about their obvious disdain for customer feedback.\n<br />\n<br />They fixed the problem in FO4 and had a chance to put it right with SSE...\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4][center]So, what can be done?[/center][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />You can use less bulbs...already done it\n<br />There's an alternate version in the download that has four bulbs that illuminate all three floors. No popping bulbs, no switching on and off light-sources. Just a flat, bland, un-atmospheric and dated lighting setup. \n<br />\n<br />Get in touch with Bethesda?\n<br />Sure, add your voice to posts like [url=https://bethesda.net/community/topic/15283/request-that-light-limits-on-meshes-be-improved-for-sse]this[/url] and [url=https://bethesda.net/community/topic/8278/engine-bugs-key-bindings-doubled-perks-lighting-limits-lod-flicker-plant-respawn-dirty-edits]this[/url] and [url=https://bethesda.net/community/topic/5041/light-sources-limit]this[/url] and [url=https://bethesda.net/community/topic/15283/request-that-light-limits-on-meshes-be-improved-for-sse/20]this[/url] and [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/5j3e76/do_you_think_we_could_rally_to_request_light/]this[/url] and [url=https://bethesda.net/community/topic/9670/request-to-allow-for-more-shadow-casting-light-bulbs/2]this\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Credits to Tamira and Stroti for[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37176/?] Old Mill Inn Custom Mesh[/url]\n<br />Credits to RadioBox and Drakulux for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11534/?]Whiterun Outskirts Market[/url]",
