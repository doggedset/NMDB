Tonight I&#39;m offering a new player home for Enderal, in anticipation for the Forgotten Stories DLC. \r<br />\r<br />What&#39;s changed:\r<br />- New (exterior only) buildings added outside the tavern. The tavern is home to &#39;locals&#39;, but where do they live? &gt;_&gt; A couple buildings wouldn&#39;t hurt.\r<br />- Minor changes to Frostcliff Tavern&#39;s interior; including new walls, windows, and item placement, to give the place a ClefJ charm. \r<br />- A new player&#39;s room; Frostcliff Suite, usable for a player&#39;s base of operations in the mountains. The key was unceremoniously dropped on the floor nearby the suite door, for you to claim yourself&#33; \r<br />\r<br />All quest markers are unchanged, and should function perfectly in a new or existing game. \r<br />There are no major workstations; One must still have a reason to visit Ark. \r<br />\r<br />This was more of a personal want for my game. It&#39;s a small mod, but I hope you enjoy&#33;[/center]",
