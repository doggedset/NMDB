  "descriptionHtml": "First things first, I have permission from Natterforme to use his armour for this replacer. I\\'ve created for myself, but someone else might like it so, so why not to upload it ;)\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nThis mod is simple. Shadow Ranger gear replaces the original Nightingale Armour. Both for males and females.\r\n\r\nNatterforme\\\\\\'s Armour mod is !!!REQUIRED!!! for this to run properly. Once you download his mod, you only need to use textures directory from original mod. Meshes and .esp that will actually replace original Nightingale armour are of course in my .zip file.\r\n\r\nHere you can download Natterforme\\\\\\'s original mod: Shadow Ranger gear >>>\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28282//? \r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\nNow since there is only one variation of Nightingale armour, there can be only one mesh for hood (you could probably make it into more options, but I cannot -- not so good in modding + dont have that much time, and when I do, I\\\\\\'m going to play, not to learn about CK, etc.), that means I\\\\\\'ve added the mesh/model of my personal preference. But mesh/model can be changed very quickly and with little time invested. If you prefer some other hood from Natterforme\\\\\\'s original mod, just PM me and I\\\\\\'ll upload it under optional files.\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nDrop files to your Skyrim/Data folder (meshes and .esp), overwrite if asked.\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI didnt change \\\\\\\"in menus\\\\\\\" model, because it doesn\\\\\\'t really matter to me... especially when most of the time only favourites menu is opened.\r\n___________________________________\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\nWell I dont know about any, tested it myself and it worked ok, but if something comes up for you, let me know. I cant think of anything that could occur, because it is very simple mod.\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\n\r\nOf course it might be problematic if you already have some Nightingale armour replacer...\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nPerms:\r\n\r\nI have permission from Natterforme. For this mod and this mod only. If you want to use his assets (meshes, textures...) you need to ask him for permission. You cannot upload this mod anywhere else since he does not want to upload his Original armour mod anywhere else. Also other restrictions that Natterforme mentioned apply as well for this mod.\r\n__________________________________________\r\n\r\n!!!
