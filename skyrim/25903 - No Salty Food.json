  "descriptionHtml": "This mod removes the need for salt in food, including the new HearthFires recipes. I\\'ll continue to update it as new foods come along in the game.\r\n\r\nWhy no salt? You don\\'t need it in food, everything has some sodium in it naturally. But other than that, I find needing salt annoying. I want salt for my alchemy!\r\n\r\nYou can still use this mod if you don\\'t have HearthFires. This mod should be compatible with any mod, unless they change recipes.\r\n\r\nSteam version of this mod is also available here: http://tinyurl.com/9p2lkmz",
