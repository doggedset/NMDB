  "descriptionHtml": "The Blackblood Marauders have decided to set up a base outside their cave. Now the player has a chance to get rid of them once and for all while gaining a home in the process.\r\n\r\nKill all the marauders and claim the farmhouse and the legendary weapon artifact for yourself. Not recommended for low level characters.\r\n\r\nThe farm is located north of [b]Broken Oar Grotto[/b], on the coast [b]north-west of Solitude[/b].\r\n\r\nBrightness varies depending on your light-modifying mods, I used Realistic Lighting in the screenshots so its a little darker than vanilla.\r\n\r\nRead the ReadMe for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]- Install/Uninstall -[/b]\r\n\r\nI recommend NMM, very easy to use for both purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do it manually, place the ESP and BSA files in steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data directory. Delete them to uninstall.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]- Known bugs -[/b]\r\n\r\nMannequins are very buggy in Skyrim, and I don\\'t have the knowledge to mess with them. If you see them move from their positions or other such behaviour, try downloading this: \r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10652]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10652[/url]\r\n[i](NOTE: may not work with if you have official DLC installed)[/i]\r\n\r\nMost containers outside are NOT safe, store your stuff inside.\r\n\r\nThe leftover dead bodies may not disappear in the interiors, carefully \\\"DISABLE\\\" them with the console or drag them somewhere out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe exterior doesn\\'t have updated LOD data.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]- Version history - [/b]\r\n\r\n1.2\r\nMore fixes, including better lighting and working weapon plaques.\r\n\r\n1.1\r\nLots of fixes, rebalancing and additions.\r\n\r\n1.0 \r\nInitial release for SKYRE challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]- Credits -[/b]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16525]Modders Resource Pack[/url] by Oaristys and Tony67\r\n[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1330-the-tesa-skyrim-resource-kit-project/]TESA Skyrim Resource Kit Project[/url] by TES Alliance Community\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17423]Paintings and Frames[/url] by Artisanix\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14134]OpenBooks Resource[/url] by Blary\r\n[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1325-insanitys-washing-stuffs/]Insanity\\'s Washing Stuffs[/url] by InsanitySorrow\r\n[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1120-insanitys-artifact-resource/]Insanity\\'s Artifact Resource[/url] by InsanitySorrow\r\n\r\nAlso thanks to Bethesda Softworks for making the game and releasing the Creation Kit.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally made for SKYRE farms challenge.\r\n[url=http://skyrimrealestate.com/]http://skyrimrealestate.com/[/url]",
