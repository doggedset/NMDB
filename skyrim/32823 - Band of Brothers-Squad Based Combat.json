Their is 10 Archers, 10 Infantry, 1 Wizard, 1 Bard and 4 Officers.\r\nThey are all allies, and you can recruit each one individually if you want but it is better to use the Officers.\r\nThis mod has been fully cleaned and tested with 200+ mods.\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]Story[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nThe Band of Brothers are a bunch of rag-tag rebel Imperials who were dissbannded because they stood up against corruption in the Imperial army. They raised their voice against torcher and the burning of villages and the killing of women and children. They are wanted dead or alive bye the Legion for helping and aiding the Stormcloakes.\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]Location[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nTheir camp will be marked on your map or you can consult the screenshots.\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]Some of my other mods[/b][/color][/size]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30704  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29526 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23317 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31635 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23415 http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26590\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]Details[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Command a faithful army.\r\n2.  Recruit 1 or all 26.\r\n3.  Infantry and Archers respawn but Officers do not!\r\n4.  Infantry and Archers ignore stealth meter but Officers do not!\r\n5.  Give them whatever armor and weapons you want but they come with Imperial gear!\r\n6.  Probably not a good idea to use all of them in a cave or something, although I have and it wasn\\'t to bad.\r\n7.  When your done with them then just dismiss them and they will return to camp.\r\n8.  Strategically place your squads for a ambush!\r\n9.  They all use different voices along with the standard follower voices!\r\n10. Works great with UFO but have not tested it with AFT so let me know.\r\n11. YOU NEED A MOD THAT ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE FOLLOWER! UFO or SOMETHING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]Install[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n1. This should work fine with NMM.\r\n2. Manual download- Extract the files to a temporary location. Copy the files to \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\ or steam steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]Uninstall[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n1. Remove all your stuff out of their inventory, Then, in data files, Uncheck and delete.\r\nIf you need to delete everything that came with this mod then do this.... examine the contents of the whole mod folder and delete all\r\nthe corresponding files.\r\n2. Or use Nexusmodmanager\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]Incompatibility[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nIt will be incompatible with mods that mod the same area. The only one I know of so far is Corners of Skyrim but he has a patch for this area.\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]Known Issues or Bugs[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nNone, Fully tested with 200+mods and cleaned with Tes5Edit.\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]History[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nversion 2/I took the boots and bracers out of outfit and put in inventory. Also I made the armor like clothes, so now you should be able to give them any armor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]Contact[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nKnightRangersGuild on Skyrimnexus or KnightRangersGuild@yahoo.com\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]Credits[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]Tools Used[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nSkyrim Creation Kit.\r\n\r\n[size=200][color=#ff0000][b]Permissions[/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\nYou can do whatever you like with this mod just give me credit for the original and a link to my mod thanks!",
