  "descriptionHtml": "== Summary ==\r\n\r\nI love Winterhold, it\\'s a little town, it has the Magic College, and most of all it\\'s quiet. But the only way to have a home is to enter the College, and it may not suit every character, so I built a very little home just at the exit of the town. :)\r\nThere\\'s nothing extraordinary in the house, since everything you might need is already in the inn or in the College. But if you have an idea, please tell me in the comments and I\\'ll consider adding it.\r\n\r\nOh, and the \\\"Private Chest\\\" doesn\\'t respawn, it\\'s safe.\r\n\r\n== Changelog ==\r\n\r\n1.0 : Added the house.",
