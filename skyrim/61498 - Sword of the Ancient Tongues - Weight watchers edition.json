  "summary": "Bit of a scaled down version of Corvalho1&#39;s Sword of the Ancient Tongues. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve seen plenty of comments about how the 1H version of Corvalho&#39;s sword looks to fat and heavy to be wielded efficiently, and how the scabbard appears to pretty much float in midair. I decided to edit the mesh to address these issues. Blade is thinner and is also a bit less wide, and I also removed the scabbard. Feedback is appreciated as far as size, if the general consensus is that it&#39;s too small, I&#39;ll increase the size.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Credit to Corvalho1 for original upload. If this mod offends, I will remove it.",
