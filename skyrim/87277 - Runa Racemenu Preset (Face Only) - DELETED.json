This is a Racemenu Preset of one of my many characters, called Runa.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Race:[/b][/u] Nord\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Body Type:[/b][/u] In the screenshots i'm using 7BO but since this is an \"only face\" preset you can use whatever you like.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Skin:[/b][/u] Use whichever you like the most although i highly recommend the more \"doll-like\" ones like [b]Demoniac[/b], [b]Pure Skin[/b] or [b]Fair Skin[/b]. Any of those should do the trick. Other \"rougher\" skins may not look so good with the face. (In the screenshots i'm using Pure Skin)\n<br />\n<br /> - - - - - - - - - -\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Required Mods\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/u] - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]Racemenu[/url] (dah!)\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56056/?]Mikan Eyes[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35327/?]SG Female Eyebrows[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?]KS Hairdos[/url]\n<br />\n<br /> - - - - - - - - - -\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Optional Mods[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Now, if you want that little bit of body hair in the belly you'll need [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/78789/?]Nordic Warmaiden Hair[/url]\n<br />\n<br /> - - - - - - - - - -\n<br />\n<br />[b]All the credits go to the authors of these amazing mods that make possible the creation of beautiful characters![/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b] - - - - - - - - - -\n<br />\n<br />[u]Instructions[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Install the required/suggested mods. Then extract the file and just drop it on your racemenu presets' folder (the location may vary depending on which mod manager you use if any at all, a quick google search should help you, but it should be a folder with this structure \"skse&#92;plugins&#92;CharGen&#92;Presets\")\n<br />\n<br /> - - - - - - - - - -\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]FAQ[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br /> - Why is it a face only preset?\n<br />   Because i used to have all my characters created on CBBE and with a lot of Racemenu Morphs modifications on top of a custom bodyslide preset and sharing a preset like that would've been a lot more difficult not just for me but for whoever wanted to use it. But recently i changed to 7BO since the most amazing outfits are for UNP bodies and the face preset goes perfectly fine with almost any body really, cbbe or unp.\n<br />\n<br /> - What ENB are you using?\n<br />   Snapdragon ENB.\n<br />\n<br /> - Can you make her into a follower?\n<br />   [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90783]Done[/url].\n<br />\n<br /> - Can i make her into a follower?\n<br />   No need, I already did :) [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90783]Here[/url].\n<br />\n<br /> - Can you upload this to \"X\" website? No. Nexus is perfectly fine and objectively the best mod site in the entire internet.
