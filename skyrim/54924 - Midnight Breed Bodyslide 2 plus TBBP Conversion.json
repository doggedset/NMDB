  "descriptionHtml": "===================================================\r<br />\r<br />BodySlide 2 Conversion for Midnight Breed Armor\r<br />Author: MightionNY\r<br />\r<br />Contact: MightionNY\r<br />E-mail - shinyknight@roadrunner.com\r<br />\r<br />===================================================\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.4\r<br />Date: 7/10/2014\r<br />\r<br />Tweaked both tights to correct odd clipping of the waistband.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.3\r<br />Date: 7/9/2014\r<br />\r<br />Adjusted the weighting on both corsets to address clipping while swimming.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.2\r<br />Date: 6/25/2014\r<br />\r<br />Redid the TBBP corset due to things I learned about properly copying bone weights - it really helps reduce clipping (and the crude &#34;fixes&#34; needed to address it) if you copy over ALL the proper bone weights; not just the TBBP weights...\r<br />\r<br />Anyway, this * may * help it handle crazy presets better, if it wasn&#39;t doing so good a job before.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1\r<br />Date: 6/18/2014\r<br />\r<br />Made an attempt to resolve some minor clipping issues with &#34;larger&#34; presets with the tights and corset.  Emphasis on attempt. :D \r<br />\r<br />Larger breasts may see reduced/elimnated clipping when moving, and the tights will have less clipping where the knees bend.  There&#39;s only so much I can do to resolve clipping with &#34;tights&#34; before they&#39;re not tights any more. :D\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.00\r<br />Date: 6/15/2014\r<br />This mod is a BodySlide 2 and TBBP Conversion for Stealthic Khaos&#39; Midnight Breed Armor.  The TBBP &#34;system&#34; I use is HDT, v14.28.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />Bodyslide 2\r<br />The original mod, linked here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53697/?\r<br />\r<br />Usage: \r<br />Extract this file into your Data folder, answering &#34;yes&#34; to overwriting and merging folders.  When you next run Bodyslide 2, you will see ten new &#34;outfits&#34; - three of them are the TBBP versions of the corset, tights, and belts.  You should only build the TBBP versions if you use TBBP, obviously.  The other four pieces (Boots, Shoulders, Sleeves and Strap) have no TBBP weights.\r<br />\r<br />Basically, build the four pieces listed above plus the TBBP *or* non-TBBP versions of the corset, belts, and tights.\r<br />\r<br />Disclaimers:\r<br />\r<br />While I did check all sliders for clipping using Outfit Studio, I will not guarantee an absence of clipping if extreme settings or combinations of extreme settings are used. :D  I will guarantee if you use a CBBE Classic preset with a setnpcweight of 40, you shouldn&#39;t see any. :D  I also do not guarantee you won&#39;t see any clipping during TBBP animations, but I was pretty thorough when testing.\r<br />\r<br />I did all the conversion after having installed nefsen&#39;s Midnight Breed Recolored: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54741/?  I haven&#39;t tested it directly with only the original mod, but it should work.\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues:\r<br />\r<br />No Bodyslide version of the gloves is included - Outfit Studio has an issue when exported hand .nifs are distorted, and my powers do not include the ability to work around this. :/\r<br />\r<br />Credits and thanks:\r<br />-Stealthic Khaos for the original mod\r<br />-nefsen for Midnight Breed ReColor, which inspired me to try the conversion\r<br />-Caliente for CBBE, Bodyslide, and Outfit Studio\r<br />\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />Please feel free to use this as a base if someone wants to improve on my mediocre weighting skills or some such. :D",
