This involves the following:\r<br />- Removing all items you wish to keep from the lodge\r<br />- Exit the lodge and cavern\r<br />- Save and shut down to your desktop\r<br />- Uncheck the mod in the data files section of the normal Skyrim launcher\r<br />- Load the game with the mod inactive and save\r<br />- Shutdown to your desktop and install the new version using the above methods\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/sWRNZkd.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Some users encounter a strange phantom water that appears and disappears again. It has been encountered outside the lodge however so at this stage is assumed to be a game issue that affects the lodge among other places.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/v4xPYBZ.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Pinewood Manor - Incompatible\r<br />Alchemists&#39; Cavern - Incompatible\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/s1j2NN2.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />V1:\r<br />- Initial release\r<br />\r<br />V2:\r<br />- The nexus file system has been changed such that the three unchanging core files are downloaded and work with both Elianora and Lrsamways versions and then the esp of the desired version is simply installed after. This allows updates to be done without requiring to download more then just the updated esp.\r<br />- Fixed the MCM script to prevent it from trying to change the amber soul gem once the menu is closed even when the settings for it were not touched.\r<br />- Banner sounds removed to prevent water sounding noise in the home.\r<br />- Altered the ownership of the remote access chest such that accessed items arent flagged as stolen if accessed in a non-player owned cell. \r<br />\r<br />V3:\r<br />- Removed the issue with remote access spell moving items to only the second chest if items are added to two different chests in quick succession.\r<br />- Fixed banner spelling in the MCM. \r<br />- Added a toggle option for &#34;Extra Banners&#34; to allow you to have: Faction banners only, Faction and Generic Banners, No Banners and Generic Banners Only (The colour of the banner is still dictated by the light or dark theme). \r<br />- Added another remote access chest named &#34;To Sell&#34; for items gathered that are just going to be sold at the next available time and not stored or displayed.\r<br />- Menu option to choose between Elianora and Lrsamways version in-game. \r<br />- Vault door for the display room or a wall if no displays are active. \r<br />- Option to have a black book instead of the Heart of the Forest travel stone. \r<br />- Changes to some static overlays to make them more visible in their chests.\r<br />- Fixed the transparent displays from returning when closing the MCM even without altering those options.\r<br />- Overhauled the displays such that the item is stored in a chest and not simply removed into thin air and then a copy created when its removed.\r<br />\r<br />V3 Update:\r<br />- Fixed an issues with the Heart of the Forest stone caused by implementing the Black Book.\r<br />\r<br />V4:\r<br />- Changed the look of the archery range and added to ability to gain experience for shooting the targets.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/MZCAac8.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />- [b]Q: [/b]Can you add X or Y?\r<br />- [b]A:[/b]Â No, this mod is as is and will not likely change.
