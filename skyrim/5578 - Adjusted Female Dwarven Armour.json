Which shows that being polite in your requests and not asking for the moon goes a long way.\r\n\r\nrockmanjunior asked me for a dwarven armour with less large shoulders. I took a quick look out of curiosity and it does turn out that that the female versions look pretty much the same as the male versions. In fact, the females look like burly quarterbacks in the dwarven armour.\r\n\r\nI did a quick adjusts the width of the shoulders a bit and also the waistline.\r\n\r\nThe weight slider works on this one so it is safe for all.\r\n\r\nThis is not a skimpy version as the screenshots show.\r\n\r\n[size=4]Installation[/size]\r\n\r\nExtract to skyrim data folder to install.",
