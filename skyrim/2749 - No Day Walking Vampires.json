  "descriptionHtml": "The file has gone through a transformation due to limitations of using tessnip, now if your a vampire you burst into flames and lose most of your health/magicka/stam...but it isnt constant drain anymore.\r\n\r\nstill trying to emplement making everyone run in fear during the day when your on fire.\r\n\r\n-stay tuned for my other vamp mods to help balance this one out, and when ck drops i will make many many many changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nversion 0.04b -Fixed descriptions in active abilities tab (still looking into the hidden one at the top) \r\n\r\n\r\nversion 0.03b -Removed constant health drain. as of right now without ck it breaks wait/travel because of how the script is run...it never stops running it just negates the effects, but game still sees it as a negative health effect on the character and blocks it...so i would have to rescript to prevent that....so need to wait for ck\r\n\r\nversion 0.02b- Lowered the damage speed enough for you to be able to run and get inside...lol",
