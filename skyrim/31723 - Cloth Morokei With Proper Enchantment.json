  "descriptionHtml": "I spent a while trying to find a fix for the Morokei mask that not only made it cloth, but gave it the proper enchantment it was meant to have. After trying a bunch of different mods, some said it had no armor, but was still treated as armor when using the Mage Armor perk, some treated it as clothing but had the wrong enchantment on it, I decided to just do it myself. \r\n\r\nThis is THE Morokei mask mod to use if you\\'re a mage. It has the proper 100% magicka regen enchantment, with the 20% shout cooldown, and is treated as clothing. As you can see in the screenshot, I have nothing but clothing on, and an armor rating of 425.",
