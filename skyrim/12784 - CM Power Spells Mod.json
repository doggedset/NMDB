  "descriptionHtml": "CM Power Spells Mod\r\n===================\r\n\r\nAdds a merchant of magic items to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun who sells spell tomes that teach racial powers that can be cast like spells with magicka costs and only half the duration of normal powers to limit their use. \r\n\r\nThe default Powers have not been changed or modified in any way.  They can still be used as they always have been.  But the majority of the racial powers can only be used once a day, which really limits the powers, and many people don\\'t even use them anymore.  Shorter duration spells make a power actually work for  the player, makes a character more unique, increases the roleplaying, and will even have the player using his/her actual Racial Power more often.\r\n\r\nSince all the spell tomes for the powers are for sale, there\\'s nothing to prevent the player from buying them all if he/she has the gold. However, it is recommended that only one spell tome be purchased to match the power the player has, so that play balance and roleplaying do not suffer. \r\n  \r\n\r\nRecommended Mods\r\n================\r\n\r\n- Live Another Life - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9557\r\n- Portable camping gear mod of your choice.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation Requirements for Version 1.0\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\nOfficial Skyrim patch 1.4 or greater.\r\n\r\nDownload and install using one of the following methods.  \r\n\r\nInstallation - Nexus Mod Manager\r\n================================\r\n\r\nUse the \\\"Download with Manager\\\" button on the CM New Companions Mod page at Skyrim Nexus and activate after download. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation - Wrye Bash BAIN\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nDrop the CMPowerSpells.esp into your Skyrim Mods\\\\Bash Installers folder, and then activate.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation - Manual\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nDrop the CMPowerSpells.esp and graphics folders into your Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n\r\nIf you used a mod management program, use it to uninstall.
