  "descriptionHtml": "\r\n=====================\r\n+++CURRENT VERSION+++\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nV1.1 - October 11th 2012\r\n\r\n=================\r\n+++Description+++\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a book to leveled lists, that once obtained, enables the player to see the location of mines around the province of Skyrim. This makes it easier to locate them. The book features hints about the content of these mines as well.\r\nIf you\\'re tired of looking for the book, bring up the console, and type this in: help \\\"mines of\\\"\r\nJust copy the ID of the book after the additem command like so \\\"player.additem #\\\"\r\n\r\nPlease note! Some locations appear to be other location types on the map, but these places contain or are very close to the entrance of an actual mine.\r\n\r\nI\\'d really love some feedback, so please tell me if you have a hard time finding the book. I\\'ll make it spawn more often. Also if there is someone willing to help me, I\\'d also like to feature some of the more significant or rare ore veins that appear in the wilderness without a map marker. If you know a way to do this, just drop me a note!\r\n\r\n================\r\n+++DOWNLOAD+++\r\n================\r\n\r\nNexus - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25289/\r\nSteam - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=101888089\r\n\r\n==================\r\n+++Requirements+++\r\n==================\r\n\r\n-Skyrim 1.7.7.0.6 or Later\r\n\r\n==================\r\n+++Installation+++\r\n==================\r\n\r\nManual: Extract archive to Skyrim/Data folder.
