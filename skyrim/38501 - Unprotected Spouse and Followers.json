  "descriptionHtml": "This makes the player\\'s spouse and followers able to get killed by enemies in Skyrim.\r\n\r\nIn Skyrim when a NPC becomes a follower or gets married by the player, they are automatically protected, meaning the spouse and followers will fall on their knees when deadly injured, in this case only the player can kill them. This mod makes them unprotected so they can get killed by enemies. This will not affect essential NPCs, it can be used for non-essential added or customized characters.\r\n\r\nInstallation: Put the esp file in the game directory\\\\data folder and tick it in the game launcher, or use Nexus Mod Manager to download and install.\r\n\r\nThis file is made by using Skyrim Creation Kit, removes the \\\"Protected\\\" flag for the \\\"DialogueFollower\\\" ID and the \\\"RelationshipMarriageFIN\\\" ID , no change to any particular NPC\\'s essential flag or protected flag.",
