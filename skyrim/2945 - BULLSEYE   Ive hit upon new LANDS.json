  "modName": "BULLSEYE   Ive hit upon new LANDS",
  "summary": "What we have here is the very FIRST mod offering a new WORLDSPACE and a new INTERIOR CELL, LINKED TO VANILLA SKYRIM; as well as a lot of OTHER new/custom things!  Though this is just a NOVELTY mod, it serves as PROOF OF CONCEPTS for what capabilities we already have available to us for preCKModding.  This version also includes a wee model of \\'new",
  "descriptionHtml": "**********\r\nI, SLuckyD, am no longer developing or supporting this mod.\r\nALSO: this mod is NOT to be used with a game.. it is only for novelty purposes. I am making it available again, so people can see how I did what I did.. long before the CK was released.\r\nDO NOT SAVE YOUR GAME WITH THIS MOD LOADED!!!!\r\n**********\r\n\r\n\r\nWanna know the SECRET to how I made this... shall you open the strange, new (actually IN-GAME) DOOR in Markarth, taking you to a place where Yokudan secrets are burned into the countryside?  Thusly would you be enabled to begin modding without the new CK (and see cheesy examples of what we are ALREADY ABLE to easily do).  You\\'ll just have to PLAY this SHORT MOD, at the end of which you\\'ll find out!  [updates to follow]\r\n\r\nFYI: NOTHING in VanillaSky is changed or overwritten.  90+% of this was custom-made with... *SPOILER*; as well as some Vanil meshes & textures being used.  This was due to expediency, and NOTHING VANSKY WAS HARMED in the process - this mod simply REFERENCES VanSky resources.\r\n\r\n[FEATURES]\r\n(all of which are 100% CUSTOM and/or NEW, not \\'TESvSnipped\\' into existence as another \\'replacer\\')\r\n- a NEW Worldspace\r\n- a NEW Interior Cell\r\n- Doors which link them together, as well as to VanillaSky (Markarth)\r\n- Lights (the NIF object kind.. Interior GI is NOT working as expected)\r\n- Activators: though scripting is NOT available, we DO have anims & sound (though not included in this version)\r\n- Music (assigned to play in certain areas)\r\n- Sounds\r\n- Furniture (just a stool for now, but the procedure should be the same for the other stuff..)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[OTHER SLuckyD RELEASES]\r\n(availability may be limited until I can update them to 100% compatible, Skyrim Creation Kit versions)\r\n\r\n- Portable On-demand Disposable Unlimited Mannequins (SPODUM)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10578\r\n\r\n- Vanilla Mannequin Script Fix\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10652\r\n\r\n- Moving Target Practice\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28336\r\n\r\n- Overlook Tower Player Home\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4514\r\n(this was the first Skyrim mod to offer a non-Vanilla Player-home)\r\n\r\n- Gokstad Sailable Viking Ship & Portable Player Home\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5432\r\n(this was the first Skyrim mod to implement real-time sailing/flying with multiple objects)\r\n\r\n- Faster Woodland Creatures\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4799\r\n\r\n- Wounded Knee Gulch\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3787\r\n(this was the first Skyrim mod to offer a new dungeon)\r\n\r\n- Ring of Fortify Carry Weight plus 10000\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8520\r\n\r\n- Bullseye\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2945\r\n(this was the first Skyrim mod to offer a new worldSpace, as well as several other \\'preCK firsts\\')\r\n\r\n\r\n[OTHER PROJECTS I\\'VE ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTED TO]\r\n\r\n- Flyable Dragon Race Revamped\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17178\r\n(I did the ground-detection, which auto-switches the dragon to walking mode) ",
