So, this mod aims to fix that!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod changes some aspects of the Master-Level Illusion Spells.\n<br />\n<br />Mayhem:\n<br />Increased Max Level\n<br />Increased Duration\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Harmony:\n<br />Increased Max Level\n<br />Increased Duration\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Hysteria:\n<br />Increased Max Level\n<br />Increased Duration\n<br />\n<br />I did not change any aspects of Call to Arms, as I've never actually used it in a playthrough and so far looks fine to me.\n<br />\n<br />I did not modify the costs to cast these spells, because I thought they were probably high enough.\n<br />\n<br />If enough people tell me this is too OP, I will make a version that is a bit less so.",
