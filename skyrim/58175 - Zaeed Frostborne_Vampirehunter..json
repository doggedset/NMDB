  "descriptionHtml": "Zaeed joined the Dawnguard after the events where his vampire-clan left him out in the frozen wastelands to die. Out of the snow he climbed after regaining his strength by only feeding on the various animals in the snow and out of the snow and in to the heat, Zaeed became Frostborne. Zaeed later went to the Dawnguard to seek vengeance on his former clan. Zaeed is now a professional vampire-hunter set out to destroy any remaining vampires in Tamriel. \r<br />\r<br />You can find him in the &#34;Sleeping Giant Inn&#34; in Riverwood.\r<br />This is my first mod ever and it is a very simple/basic follower mod that i made for myself at the beginning. \r<br />Enjoy. :-)\r<br />Yours sincerely: Albin.",
