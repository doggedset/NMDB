  "descriptionHtml": "I was inspired to make this by Fs97&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49007]mod[/url] when it dawned on me that I could just make recipes myself in the CK pretty easily.\r<br />\r<br />Charred skeever hide is pretty hard to find but there are skeever everywhere and skeever tails as well, you just can&#39;t do anything with them. Still yet, charred skeever hide remains a core ingredient to several recipes.\r<br />\r<br />So for a little added immersion, now you can make charred skeever hide yourself with a skeever tail [s]and some salt[/s]. It&#39;ll show up under MISC rather than FOOD since charred skeever hide doesn&#39;t count as a food.\r<br />\r<br />[color=green]UPDATE&#33;[/color] I realized there&#39;s also Charred Skeever Meat which isn&#39;t cookable either so now as of 1.1 charred skeever meat will be skeever tail + salt pile and charred skeever hide will be just a skeever tail. Since one&#39;s a food item and one isn&#39;t this makes the most sense. Also, seeing skeevers on cooking spits just charring where the giants cook them (whose bodies contain charred skeever hide) I think it&#39;s probably pretty realistic that it would be the case.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Changelog[/b]\r<br />1.1 - Charred skeever meat added as skeever tail + salt pile. Charred skeever hide now just skeever tail.\r<br />1.0 - Initial release. Charred skeever hide is skeever tail + salt pile",
