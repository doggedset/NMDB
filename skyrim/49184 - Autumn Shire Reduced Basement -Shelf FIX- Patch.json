  "descriptionHtml": "|ONLY A PATCH|\r<br />|PLEASE DIRECT YOURSELF TO THE CREATOR&#39;S PAGE FOR ENDORSEMENT AND FULL DOWNLOAD|\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30190/\r<br />\r<br />This is an updated version of the Autumn Shire mod that fixes and adjusts the bookshelves of the housing cell to better accommodate books while also reducing the size of the basement cell to fir much more agreeable sizing standards. Originally, I was not going to upload this, but a couple friends insisted upon it. \r<br />\r<br />This is only the ESP file, so simply replace the original ESP with the updated version.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />|Changelog|\r<br />Basement size reduced.\r<br />Basement ceiling lowered. \r<br />All but two mannequins removed.\r<br />Three storage chests added: Armor; Weapons; Loot. \r<br />Fireplace Added.\r<br />Lighting adjustments.\r<br />House Bookshelves fixed.\r<br />Interior House Cell no longer floating in a blue abyss when opening front door (no visible blue sky box). \r<br />\r<br />|Version 1.1 Changelog|\r<br />Potato plants no longer float in middair.\r<br />Lampost closest to house shifted to the right side to avoid clipping issues with house. \r<br />\r<br />Hopefully this is only a temporary patch and the original Author updates his original file soon. ^v^\r<br />\r<br />If you have any issues, please let me know. \r<br />",
