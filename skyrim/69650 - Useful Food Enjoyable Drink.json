  "descriptionHtml": "Useful Food Enjoyable Drink\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />INTRO\r<br />\r<br />So, what&#39;s the deal with this mod?\r<br />I thought it was annoying how Bethesda put a well fleshed out yet fully dysfunctional range of food items in the game, and I wanted to make food a lot more useful and enjoyable for myself. How?\r<br />\r<br />1. By making food effects a lot more focused where they were all over the place; for example, see Hearthfire&#39;s &#34;Lavender Dumpling&#34;: restore 5 health / fortify magicka 10 pts for 60 seconds / resist 10% of magic for 60 seconds. In my opinion, food items should focus on one, maybe two kinds of effects at most, that complement different playstyles in a very general sense (focusing on health, stamina or magicka, or providing different kinds of defences).\r<br />2. By offering a few more options for Magicka users (see Eidar Cheese variants, Gourd, Long Taffy Treat in vanilla + some Hearthfire cuisine), where there was previously only the Elsweyr Fondue.\r<br />3. By stopping beverages punishing you for consuming them (no &#39;Damage Stamina Regen 30%&#39; etc).\r<br />4. By making food effects stronger instead of pitifully weak, where food effects are relatively strong in the early levels but can hold their own as you collect/craft more and stack their effects in the later levels - like potions, really.\r<br />\r<br />Note that I&#39;m only aiming to make food better in the ways it seemed to be originally intended when it was put into the game - that is, in providing certain temporary or one-time beneficial effects to the player that reinforce combat and other general aspects of gameplay. This mod does not implement or complement a &#34;hunger&#34; or similar needs system that some other mods have brought to the game in order to make food relevant in an entirely different way. That&#39;s not what I&#39;m going for.\r<br />\r<br />However, specifically regarding the mod iNeeds, user BlueGunk was able to determine the following:\r<br />\r<br />&#34;I loaded it up and so far as I can see there is no clash with iNeed at all. I stuck to vanilla weights and added the honey-milk-butter (etc) option. I quickly found jugs of milk in barrels and could use them - so all working. I can see foods boosting health etc but I have these effects switched off in iNeed so that is either vanilla and / or your mod. I think I would recommend iNeed users to leave that element unticked in the MCM menu (the default setting anyway) and allow yours to do it&#39;s thing.\r<br />\r<br />Loot places your mod after iNeed.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Also note that vanilla weight is recommended with iNeed as that mod seems to determine how satiating food is by the weight of the food item consumed.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please note, I am aware that this is not the only mod of this kind out there. Just decide for yourself whether you want to use this mod or not.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />MAIN FILES\r<br />\r<br />The big aims described above form the heart of this mod, but I&#39;ve decided, for convenience, to make this mod available in several flavours, for you to pick from as you like. More specifically, there are two dimensions I took into account: item weight and game compatibility.\r<br />\r<br />- Item weight: the more useful food becomes, the more of it you want to lug around in your pack. That&#39;s where immersion versus practicality comes into play. People who treasure immersion above all may want to keep the items&#39; original weight and just figure out how to manage their carryweight on their own terms. For those people, there is a [u]default weight[/u] version.\r<br />Other people will just want to carry around as much as they like without it impacting any other aspect of carryweight. For those people, there&#39;s a [u]no weight/weightless[/u] version. \r<br />Finally, for those who want practicality as well as a sliver of immersion, I made a &#39;middle road&#39; [u]re-proportioned[/u] version where food item weight now ranges between 0.1 and 0.5 – every item weight below 1 was set to 0.1; every item weight equal to 1 was set to 0.2; and every item weight over 1 was set to 0.5. It is a simple conversion, but an effective one.\r<br />\r<br />- Compatibility: this mod was made to modify food items from the [u]vanilla[/u] game, from the [u]Dragonborn[/u] DLC, and from the [u]Hearthfire[/u] DLC. For each of the three weight options mentioned above, I made separate esp&#39;s according to what you may or may not have. This means there is a [b]vanilla[/b] esp, a [b]vanilla + dragonborn[/b] esp, a [b]vanilla + hearthfire[/b] esp, and a [b]vanilla + dragonborn + hearthfire[/b] esp for each of the three weight options. Your game needs to have the latest update at the time of this writing, or none of the above may work.\r<br />\r<br />The observant among you may ask: &#34;What of the Dawnguard DLC, Milord?&#34; Well, Dawnguard only added a single food item, and it&#39;s not exactly meant for general consumption: the [i]&#34;Soul Husk&#34;[/i]. The item serves specific purposes in specific parts of the DLC content, and is pretty useless otherwise. It also only weighs 0.1 units, which is negligible, so I decided not to bother with the Dawnguard DLC whatsoever. Of course you can still have Dawnguard active alongside this mod.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE 1: This mod does not modify all food ever. Whaaa-? D:\r<br />I&#39;m mostly talking about quest items. A select number of food items are items that only appear once in the game, on their own, and only in relation to a specific quest. In order to avoid unnecessary exploitation / making things difficult on yourself / breaking quests and to lighten the workload, this mod leaves the following items untouched: Colovian Brandy, Dragon&#39;s Breath Mead, Fresh Meat, Spiced Beef, Stros M&#39;Kai Rum, Jessica&#39;s Wine and Firebrand Wine Case. It&#39;s normal if you&#39;ve never heard of some of these.\r<br />I have also chosen to leave Sadri&#39;s Sujamma from the Dragonborn DLC untouched. Geldis Sadri gives this special variant to the player to be distributed to people as samples of a new brew he made. Apparently you can exploit the quest for as much Sadri&#39;s Sujamma as you want. If you want to sink your time into that, it&#39;s your life… this mod just won&#39;t provide any incentive for doing so.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE 2: I&#39;ve decided to include Cyrodilic Brandy in the modified items because, even though someone at Bethesda mistakenly had it filed under Potions, it is in fact a food item in every regard. I have also moved the item into the correct category (Food).\r<br />\r<br />NOTE 3: I&#39;m only modifying items from the base game, Dragonborn and Hearthfire. Food content from other mods isn&#39;t modified - for example, the Unofficial Skyrim Patch&#39;s [i]&#34;Meat Pie&#34;[/i] addition.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE 4: If you&#39;re going to be cooking a lot, you will find yourself running out of Salt Piles quickly. As such, I can highly recommend getting the simple but brilliant [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22273/?]More Salt[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55153/?]Salt Mines of Skyrim[/url] mods to go alongside this one.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />OPTIONAL FILES\r<br />\r<br />If you really want to know what did get changed and in what way, I&#39;ve added an overview under the optional files. Furthermore, I&#39;ve added three files - really just two files separately and then once combined - which address two grievances I&#39;ve had with item spawning.\r<br />\r<br />1. The Sack of Flour food item added by Hearthfire is abundantly available in containers, even though it is the least useful item to be readily available, as you can&#39;t do anything with it unless you build an Oven in one of the player-built homes first. In contrast, the &#34;Jug of Milk&#34; and &#34;Butter&#34; food items added by Hearthfire can be used as cooking ingredients at any basic cooking pot in the main game to make Clam Chowder and Steamed Mudcrab Legs - yet these two items are rare as hell. Whyyy, Bethesdaaa?\r<br />That&#39;s why, in an optional esp, I have made it so 1-3 Butter(s) and 1-3 Jug(s) of Milk will also occasionally spawn in containers where you might reasonably expect them. Now you can finally enjoy some crunchy Steamed Mudcrab Legs in your own time - which are very nutritious, by the way.\r<br />Hearthfire also added two alchemical ingredients, Salmon Roe and Hawk&#39;s Egg. These are quite difficult/boring to obtain normally - I have allowed 0-2 of each of these to spawn as well, in some alchemical ingredient containers.\r<br />Both of these issues are related to Hearthfire content; this optional file requires the Hearthfire DLC.\r<br />\r<br />2. This may sound utterly trivial to some, but there is a &#34;Honey&#34; food item in the vanilla game and it doesn&#39;t spawn in bee hives. I want it to. There are two variants of bee hives - &#34;Bee Hive&#34; and &#34;Vacant Bee Hive&#34; - with this optional esp, they will now respawn with 1-5 and 0-4 Honey(s), respectively. You won&#39;t miss much if you choose to pass on this optional content - Honey is not a cooking ingredient for a dish, and Bee Hives don&#39;t appear that often in the game anyway. It&#39;s just a tiny detail.\r<br />This file doesn&#39;t require any DLC, unless you use the version that combines this with the other optional file (which, as indicated above, requires Hearthfire).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />OUTRO\r<br />\r<br />This mod took more effort and was more tedious to make than I had initially anticipated. I think I lost some brain cells in the process of editing the values of every affected item by hand, then going over those same items a couple more times to check for errors, then some more times to make the different versions, then some more times to make further edits. Go easy on me.\r<br />\r<br />That said, there may be some irregularities or errors that slipped through my checks. You can notify me if you think you&#39;ve found an error in one or more of the files. Of course, not everything that you think seems wrong is necessarily an error - for instance, if you feel the effect of an item is unbalanced. I&#39;ve tried to take several factors into account when determining the nature and power of every item&#39;s effects, but the food items as well as people&#39;s opinions are many, and I am few. I probably won&#39;t please everybody, and I won&#39;t go making 12 more versions to appease differing tastes. Sorry. Still, if changes don&#39;t seem to have been applied properly, or if effects aren&#39;t the same across different versions, or if you point out something I did not intend this mod to do, I&#39;ll fix and update the files.\r<br />\r<br />Just pick the main file you want, possibly one of the optional files, and install. Or, download the Food Effect Overview under optional files first, if you have a lot of patience and want to make an informed decision about downloading the main mod or not. \r<br />If you just want to use one of the optional files, you should be able to use them independently of the other files.\r<br />\r<br />Love you,\r<br />\r<br />Lucid",
