I have tried to stay true to the design of the original weapon, while updating the look to fit better into Skyrim.\r\nThe meshes and textures are fully made by me, but credit goes to Bethesda for making the original design.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the hammer there\\'s a very short undocumented quest.\r\nSouth-east of Riften is a road leading into Morrowind (although we, the players, can\\'t actually go there)\r\nRight before the gate into Morrowind, you\\'ll find a broken cart, 2 dead guards and an angry bandit. (see screenshots for exact locations).\r\nKill the bandit and read the note he\\'s carrying. It tells you where to go.\r\n\r\nThe Bell Hammer is about equal in stats to a Glass Warhammer (but the critical damage is much higher)\r\nThere are no enchantments, so you are free to put your own on their.\r\nThe hammer can be upgraded at the grindstone with a Steel and Corundum ingot.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Tub2a.png[/img]\r\n[b]Now the important part![/b]\r\nModders are [b]free[/b] to use the hammer (the meshes and the textures) for their own modding projects!\r\n[b]All I ask is credit for my hard work.[/b]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Tub2a.png[/img]\r\n[b]Changelog[/b]\r\n\r\nV 1.0\r\nInitial release\r\n\r\nV 1.0b\r\n-The NMM didn\\'t put the .esp file in the data folder, so the plugin wouldn\\'t activate. I repackaged the mod so it should work now.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Tub2a.png[/img]\r\n[b]Translations[/b]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/skyrim/mods/armurerie/armes/marteau_a_cloches_de_la_sixieme_maison.php]French translation[/url] at La Confr√©rie des Traducteurs\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/Tub2a.png[/img]\r\nPlease also check out my other mods :)\r\nHere are the latest:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18585]Shortswords[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17096]Chrysamere[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16637 ]Ashland Amulets[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15579]BiPolar Blade[/url]\r\n\r\nFor more, check [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=887024]my profile[/url]",
