  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\r<br />Honestly I have no idea how I finally got this to work, crack open the source script, you wont have any idea either :P\r<br />I plan to do a frost and fire one for discworld but due to the amount of BS I will NOT do the others as stand alone\r<br />Also, can I get a whut whut for a magic missile spell? Can do it now :)\r<br />I fixed the script that was bugging the third orb in the first part of the video\r<br />[youtube]NTnueLKQeRY[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />As usual discworld trailers, where all these spells will be packed a bit easier in one esp :)\r<br />[youtube]FEBNe8XINd0[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]aPzA_6RBWcg[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Mod adds a spell tome sitting on the bridge outside Riverwood (Dude, look at the script for this, I was just like F&#39;ING YOLO I&#39;M DONE, F Trigonometry)\r<br />The spell will summon up to three shock orbs that hover over the player\r<br />1 Orb at destruction level 50\r<br />2 at Destruction level 75\r<br />3 at Destruction level 100\r<br />The orbs will grab a random actor in range of the player and if they are in combat with the player they fire off and blow them up :)\r<br />The check re-initiates every 3 seconds per orb\r<br />Once fired, you can re-summon the orb, even if you have other orbs left up\r<br />Cost is still the same mana though\r<br />Damage is 40 direct contact (Usually doesnt happen) and 50 I think for the aoe which is decent sized\r<br />I have yet to see them accidentally hit myself so maaaaybe player is immune, no promises\r<br />\r<br />This spell was a absolute bitch, but, I can now kind of track and fire projectiles though making them arc without using gravity is still a mystery to me\r<br />IE instead of a blink spell we can make a lobbed projectile that you can flash to at any point in its arc, like a dual trigger spell, one to throw the arcing projectile and second hand to flash to its location in real time\r<br />Or a spell to throw like a magelight and a second spell in the other hand to explode it\r<br />Lots of useful applications I just wish I hadn&#39;t decided to start at like lvl 100 in difficulty but this scripting is mah bitch son&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/center]",
