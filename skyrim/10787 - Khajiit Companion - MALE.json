  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://img839.imageshack.us/img839/1076/darvin02.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThis simple modification adds a Battlemage Khajiit to Skyrim. It\\'s my first foray into any sort of modding, and I\\'m still getting my head around AI packages.\r\n\r\nSo right now, all the player has to do is talk to the Khajiit and he will join the player\\'s party.\r\n\r\n===[b]Future Ideas (Once I read more Wiki Pages)[/b]===\r\n\r\nI\\'m actually hoping to include him into a quest that makes him more multi-faceted + backstory. The idea is to play on stereotypes that he\\'s a thief and after being caught is paying for his troubles by helping to farm the lands in Whiterun.\r\n\r\nRight now, he\\'s too eager to join the player in adventures. I\\'m hoping to make a quest and have the Khajiit become a follower after the player completes the quest.\r\n\r\n===[b]So What do I have now?[/b]===\r\n\r\nBut for now, this companion can be found minding his own business on the road to Whiterun playing his flute (which I\\'m still figuring out how to trigger bardflute01 to play when he idles) or tending the fields.\r\n\r\nKeeping w/ Lore, he was not placed in a city, because Khajiits are not allowed in cities.\r\n\r\nHe mainly deals Lightning Damage with the occasional frostiness thrown into the mix.\r\nHe levels with the player. He will be level 1 when the player is level 1. His spell lists expands as the player levels.\r\n\r\n===[b]Installation[/b]===\r\n\r\nJust drop the .esp file into your Skyrim Data file.\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\nNo Flute Sounds\r\nSometimes Eats Breakfast and plays a Flute all at the same time.\r\n\r\n===[b]Comments?[/b]===\r\n\r\nPlease leave some! If you\\'re a modder, I wouldn\\'t mind having hints to make my ideas into reality! Thanks! :)\r\n\r\n********\r\nChangelog\r\n********\r\n1.01 - Dar\\'Vin can now sit on the haystacks. He also moves around the area a lot more.\r\n        Also moved his flute position back near the haystacks. He was moving strangely to get   into position for the spot near the road.",
