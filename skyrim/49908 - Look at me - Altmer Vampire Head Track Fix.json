  "descriptionHtml": "[color=pink]Ever pass a good looking high elf and think to yourself, &#34;Gosh, he/she&#39;d make an excellent Vampire.&#34; \r<br />\r<br />Ever follow through on that urge, and give them the dark gift, only to result in them staring off into space for the rest of their immortal existence? \r<br />\r<br />Fret no longer&#33; Here&#39;s a fix for that.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]What This Mod Does[/u]\r<br />-This file fixes the lack of head-tracking that occurs only in high elf Dawnguard Vampires. To most people this bug goes completely unnoticed, as it only affects Vingalmo in vanilla Dawnguard. For Vampire-siders who talk to Vingalmo a lot, and those with npc vampire turning mods, it becomes much more noticeable.\r<br />-This mod is also useful for those who use the Unofficial Dawnguard Patch with a npc vampire turning/spawning mod. While the Unofficial patch will also fix the altmer head track bug, the load order dictates any vampire altering mod afterwards will slap it back on, unless the author specifically fixed it on the vanilla settings as well. While not a difficult thing to do, it is easily overlooked, and hopefully this mod will be of some use in that regard.

Highly Recommended for players of vampires.\r<br />-There is a tiny chance this file may be incompatible with any mod that specifically alters the High Elf Vampire Race.\r<br />-In the screenshots, my altmer is wearing the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30977]Aerith Clothes[/url] by hardog and denkigroove.",
