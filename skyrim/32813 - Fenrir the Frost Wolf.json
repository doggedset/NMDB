  "descriptionHtml": "[color=limegreen][size=3]I know it sucks, I stopped work on Fenrir.  But that does not mean I gave up on him.  Fenrir was probably my first awesome mod regardless of his bugs.  I would like to break this news to those who have supported.  Fenrir will be making an appearance in our [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37665/?]&#34;Druid Essentials&#34;[/url] mod.  He will be 1 out of 4 legendary creatures that can be found and made a follower. So if you have not downloaded and endoresed Druid Essentials do so. As always thanks for the support.

Fenrir is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda, Fenrir is the father of the wolves Sköll and Hati Hróðvitnisson, is a son of Loki, and is foretold to kill the god Odin during the events of Ragnarök, but will in turn be killed by Odin&#39;s son Víðarr.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />                                       -Wikipedia [/i][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#87CEFA] This mod adds a unique companion by the name Fenrir.  This companion comes armed with many abilities based around the &#34;Frost Element&#34;  He can summon a blizzard which can cloak himself, he is capable of increased speeds zipping around the battlefield, he can conjure an ice crystal that can pierce enemies with icicles, he can also summon wolf companions that when attacked explode in an icy blast. Fenrir can be found in a cave up to the north near Dawnstar.  The map marker should appear on your map upon loading. Once you acquire Fenrir to your aid you can take an item off him which once consumes bonds you to him permanently.    If you dismiss him or lose him, you can summon him with this new spell to aid you once again.\r<br />\r<br />This mod has not been fully tested so some issues may occur.\r<br />If you enjoy this mod and appreciate it, i ask if you could please endorse and vote.

Or if you refuse using NMM you can Download manually and extract the contents to your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />If you had the previous version &#34;Fenrir - Arctic Wolf&#34; it will prompt you to overwrite data, click &#34;yes to all&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i384.photobucket.com/albums/oo284/Arcane51388/Fenrirbugs_zpsbc01e82d.jpeg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />Fenrir may display a texture issue, try reinstalling using NMM. If problem persists try running texture settings on High. (Also installing photoshop trial version may fix the texture issue, don&#39;t ask me how.  It&#39;s just what people have told me).\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i384.photobucket.com/albums/oo284/Arcane51388/FenrirCredits_zpscff3ecf5.jpeg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />A Few people I want to recognize and credit for making this mod happen.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3667680] Maymay1588 [/url] the creator of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30638] Dovahbear [/url] has inspired me to make this mod.
