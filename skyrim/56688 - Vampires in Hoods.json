  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]This mod makes all vanilla hoods, and some helmets, protect vampires from negative sunlight effects.\r<br />\r<br />[/size]-Dawnguard and Immersive Armors patches uploaded\r<br />-Dragonborn patch has been fixed (It actually works, now)\r<br />\r<br />Vampires have long been afraid of the sunlight, and rightfully so, as its pure rays have rather negative effects on their bodies. Still, one would think that a vampire hiding under a hood would not need to fear the sun as much as his un-hooded comrades.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Changes:\r<br />[/size]Adds a keyword to all hoods (let me know if I missed any) and a select few helmets, and then uses that keyword in a function condition for the vampiric sunlight effect to negate the effects while wearing the hood/helmet. \r<br />\r<br />For all of you Creation Kit people, &#34;WornHasKeyword &#39;ClothingHood&#39; == 0&#34;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Future Plans:\r<br />[/size]-A script to auto-detect all helmets, and a checkbox MCM menu for user-customization (this eliminates the need for any patches)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Known Issues:\r<br />[/size]Ordinarily, when entering sunlight as a vampire, an obnoxious sound/visual effect play to let you know that ya dun goofed. However, the effect does not play when the player removes their hood/helmet in sunlight, although the health, stamina, and magicka reductions do initiate.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Permissions:[/size]\r<br />If you intend to post this on another site, I&#39;d ask that you request permission from me first, and also remind you to give full credit.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]If you have noticed any bugs, or have a dispute about which helmets I chose for the effect, let me know and I will look into them.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Changelog:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]29/12/2014\r<br />[/size]-Added Dawnguard patch\r<br />-Added Immersive Armors patch\r<br />-Fixed/re-uploaded Dragonborn patch\r<br />\r<br />v1.0:\r<br />-Initial release\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Compatibility Issues:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />-Will not work with any mod that does not have a patch and/or doesn&#39;t use a vanilla helmet or hood as a template\r<br />-Compatible with Playable Thieves Guild Armors: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52339/?\r<br />-Compatible with Nightingale Hall - Nocturnal Forge: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52351/?",
