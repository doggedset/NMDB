  "descriptionHtml": "[color=\\\"#000080\\\"][font=\\\"Georgia\\\"][size=\\\"6\\\"]Please post a comment so I can decide whether or not to make the rest of the weapons! Thanks![/size][/font][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#000080\\\"][font=\\\"Georgia\\\"][size=\\\"6\\\"]Dark Blue Steel BETA - Sword[/size][/font][/color]\r\n\r\nThis only contains a retexture of the steel sword - \r\nit replaces any steel sword with my dark blue steel\r\nand black leather hilt.\r\nThis is currently just to see what people think of this\r\nre-texture. I hope to get some feedback so I can decide \r\nwhether or not to make the other weapons in the set!\r\n\r\n[b][u]INSTALLATION[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nExtract or drop the \\'texture\\' folder I provided into \r\nyour Skyrim/Data folder. You may want to back up\r\n your steel weapons files if you have them unpacked/\r\nextracted. Just make a new folder in the steel folder,\r\nand name it something like \\'Originals\\' and copy/paste\r\nall the steel weapon textures into the folder, then \r\nextract this file.\r\n\r\n[b][u]UNINSTALLATION[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nWhy would you want to do that? Just kidding!\r\n\r\nJust delete this file (steelsword.dds) in the path of\r\n\\'skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\weapons\\\\steel\\', and\r\nif you had unpacked the other files and backed \r\nthem up, you could copy the file to the steel folder\r\n from the \\'Originals\\' folder, but you don\\'t need to -\r\n it will still work without it being there.\r\n\r\nIf you didn\\'t unpack them, don\\'t worry, the path \r\nwill set itself to the correct file.\r\n\r\n[color=\\\"#000080\\\"][font=\\\"Georgia\\\"][size=\\\"6\\\"]~~BayHarman~~[/size][/font][/color]",
