  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=red][b]Pilgrim&#39;s Rest - High Hrothgar Mountain Shack[/b][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds in a small mountain shack up the path to High Hrothgar. It isn&#39;t fancy, there&#39;s no unlimited storage, full crafting supplies or fancy decorations. This is truly Skyrim&#39;s weather at it&#39;s fierce, where only a brave few dare to venture. But when they do, this is where they stop to recuperate. After a while, it became known as Pilgrim&#39;s Rest, a place for the devoted to rest and swap tales from their adventures. \r<br />\r<br />This place is designed to be used alongside Chesko&#39;s Frostfall Hypothermia Survival mod and has the necessary supplies to avoid freezing to death. The fire outside can be lit by bashing with a torch or by a fire spell. There&#39;s a woodchopping block with a spare axe around the other side in case you need to camp out down the road. Inside is two bed rolls, one for you and a follower, and the whole shack and the space around it is navmeshed.\r<br />\r<br />Is this a player home? Yes and no. No, because it lacks so many things, but if you&#39;re a hardcore roleplayer, this would be perfect for you. It just depends your personal taste. Location wise, it&#39;s under the overhanging where the Frost Troll attacks so watch out when you head there.\r<br /> \r<br />Overall features: \r<br />* Lightable fire with cooking pot \r<br />* Alchemy lab and tanning rack\r<br />* Nav-meshed for followers (but it&#39;s really cramped in there&#33;) and has been cleaned with TESVEdit \r<br />* Safe storage for all containers (except for the secret treasure chest)\r<br />* Kynereth shrine and amulet\r<br />* A new enchanted weapon on a plaque\r<br />~ And more&#33; ~\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]====[b]Video[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5TqvcrVemY[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Installation[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Download and drop the file into your data folder. Place meshes into the appropriately named folders. \r<br />Or just use the NMM. \r<br />To uninstall, just remove the file. Make sure to get your belongings out first though&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]====[b]Compatibility[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Compatible:[/i]\r<br />Everything and anything, there are zero scripts and it&#39;s a simple little shack in the middle of nowhere.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Incompatible:[/i]\r<br />Any other mods that the area where the shack is placed. But, last time I checked, there isn&#39;t any player houses around that area.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Permissions and Credits[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />This mod is not to be uploaded anywhere but the Skyrim Nexus. Please report to me if you see this anywhere else.\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating a great game and letting us fiddle with it. \r<br />Credit to Oarisstys for the use of the Mod Resources Pack.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Thanks for reading and check my page for more mods&#33;[/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7065334/?tb=mods&pUp=1 ] [IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/2dryws3.png[/IMG][/url]",
