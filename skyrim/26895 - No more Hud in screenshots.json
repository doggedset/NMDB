  "summary": "Remove the hud while taking screenshots",
  "descriptionHtml": "Just like the title says, this small program contain a very simple script that, with the pression of a hotkey, will remove the hud just before taking a screenshot and activate it again after the screenshot is taken.\r\nUseful to take beautiful screenshots without the need to remove the hud everytime.\r\n\r\nBasically, with the pression of a single key (HOME) it will do the following:\r\n- Open the console\r\n- Write and execute the \\\"tm\\\" command to remove the hud\r\n- Take a screenshot (using the default \\\"stamp\\\" key)\r\n- Write and execute the \\\"tm\\\" command to activate again the hud\r\n- close the console\r\n\r\nI have done this for my own use since i wasn\\'t able to find something similar on the net.\r\nIt works like a charm on my rig so i though to share it.\r\n\r\nThis executable was done using Autohotkey utility, you can find this little utility here:\r\nhttp://www.autohotkey.com/\r\nand i assure it contains no virus.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n- Launch \\\"no_more_hud_in_screenshots\\\" just before launching Skyrim or before taking screenshots.\r\n- press \\\"HOME\\\" to take HUDless screenshots, DO NOT MOVE OR PRESS ANY KEY WHILE TAKING SCREENSHOTS, do not press HOME too fast either.\r\n- Close the utility after you exit Skyrim since the \\\"HOME\\\" hotkey will still be active otherwise.\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\nMoving or pressing any other key while taking the screenshot will made some unpredictable events, like opening the console, making screenshots with the console open or removing the hud \r\nIf your hud disappears just write \\\"tm\\\" (without quotes) on the console to activate it again.\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\nUnable to move while taking screenshots may be a problem if you want to take screenshots with your character in action, i recommend using the manual way when you doing so.\r\n\r\nOther possible issue:\r\nAs far as i know the US version should work in most cases\r\nhowever there are some key maps that use a different key to open the console \r\nin that case the pression of the home key will not produce the desidered result.\r\nMessage me if you want added a version specified written for your keyboard.\r\n\r\nChange log:\r\n1.1 Slightly raised delays to work better on low framerates\r\n1.0 Initial version\r\n\r\nI admit this is a bit complicated if you usually don\\'t take much screenshots, you may just be fine by doing all manually, but if you take a lot of screenshots like i do, it will reveal very useful.\r\nI\\'m sure something similar can be done much better using SKSE or script dragon\r\nand i hope this will encourage someone to do so since i\\'m unable to do it.\r\n\r\n",
