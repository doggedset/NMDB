The NPCs in the level are mostly semi-complete.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- A jail\r\n- A vendor (I assume I finished him)\r\n- HUGE cave area with boats n stuff\r\n- Map markers (I did also modify the landscape a bit outside to accomodate the large ship door in the cave)\r\n- A long stream\r\n- Sleep areas\r\n- A cave bar\r\n- Dockyard\r\n- 2 or 3 waterfalls (I should really remember this XD)\r\n- Cool long set of stairs\r\n\r\nSo if anyones got any use for this level then feel free to do whatever with it, seems like a waste not to upload it!",
