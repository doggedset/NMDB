  "summary": "Perks for those that want to make a character that gets into the fray without armor. Also has a version for a Vigilant of Stendarr fighting style!",
  "descriptionHtml": "((Various issues have been pointed out, and SkyRe has changed a lot, I would strongly recommend against downloading this mod until I\\'ve updated it, unless you are willing and capable to fix any issues yourself.))\r\n\r\nHave a version for SkyRe and Vanilla, be sure to download the right one. please let me know if something isn\\'t working right.\r\n\r\nAlso added a \\\"Vigilant of Stendarr\\\" version, this one works while wearing gauntlets, boots, and helm, and shield, but robes/clothing. Also made the Mage Armor perks half as effective while wearing any armor but the cuirass/chest.\r\n\r\nVanilla version is less powerful due to vanilla being easier than skyre =x\r\n\r\nThis mod adds several perks to block that make a character that takes the fight to the enemy without relying on armor to keep them safe.\r\n\r\nWhy Block?\r\n\r\n1. It helps fit with the flavor in that it relies on the characters martial skill to stay alive rather than armor.\r\n\r\n2. it also makes it much more difficult for a pure mage to benefit from these perks as they would make them super tanky =x\r\n\r\n3. it didn\\'t really make sense anywhere else.\r\n\r\n4. Shields don\\'t use the ArmorHeavy or ArmorLight keywords which means they don\\'t interfere with this mod at all =O\r\n\r\nThat said, I want to try to keep it balanced with someone that picks up alteration as well, since it seems logical that you will be relying on the armor spells for the greater portion of the early game.\r\n[line]\r\nthe perks are\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Agility (2 ranks): Increases health, magicka, and stamina regeneration by 5%, increases attack speed by 5% and gives a 5% chance to critically strike while unarmored. (10% rank 2)\r\n[*] Unprotected Training (4 ranks): gives a 10/20/30/40% chance to ignore damage from an attack while unarmored. (10/15/20/25% in vanilla edition.)\r\n[*] Redirection: 20% magicka absorb while unarmored AND blocking.\r\n[*] Quick Recovery: Reduces stagger by 50%\r\n[*] Counter: 20% chance to reflect damage from attacks. (you still take the damage.)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nThe idea is that you sacrifice armor for chances at avoiding damage, so you might get one shot (assuming you are playing SkyRe on master difficulty ;P) but you might not. \r\n\r\n[center] [b] Vigilant of Stendarr Edition [/b] [/center]\r\n\r\nThis version is designed around wearing all armor EXCEPT the cuirass/chestpiece. Perks are renamed and descriptions changed to fit the flavor better. Gameplay change(s) below.\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n\r\n[*] Mage Armor Perks give a 25/50/75% bonus to armor spells while not wearing chest armor, does not stack with completely unarmored bonus.\r\n\r\n[/list]\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[b] Recommended Mods: [/b]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9247] Dual Wield Parry [/url]\r\nThis will allow you to block and level blocking while Dual Wielding or spell in your offhand.\r\n[line]\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\nV1.0.2 (10/14/12):\r\n\r\n-Removed Dawnguard from the masters of the SkyRe version.\r\n\r\nV1.0.1 (9/9/12):\r\n- Agility was giving the wrong amounts of regeneration at rank 2, this has been fixed.\r\n- Added Vanilla version of my Vigilant of Stendarr edition.\r\n\r\nV1.0.0.2 (9/2/2012): Fixed an issue where I accidently replaced SkyRe\\'s Quick Reflexes perk with the vanilla one. \r\n\r\n[line]\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nWhen you have Redirection, sometimes you get the magicka absorb animation without the effect activating, from my tests it seems that it\\'s an animation glitch and not resulting in a reduced absorb chance.\r\n\r\nAgility might not be giving all the stats, I can\\'t really tell if it is or not, please send me a message if it\\'s bugged =). The crit is definitely working though.\r\n\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n\r\nThanks goes to Rekkin for the original inspiration for this mod, Unarmoured Perks\r\n\r\nThanks also to T3nd0 for SkyRe, making Skyrim fun again and the mod itself gave me a lot of references on doing things in the CK.\r\n\r\nBethesda, for making the Elder Scrolls series and giving us modding tools in the current priced DLC environment.",
