I don't like major overhauls because sometimes they add too much and a house is functional location for me. The major goals of this mod are to stay lore friendly and bug free while being as compatible as possible with the better part of the community mods.\r\n\r\n*See Change Logs For Changes \r\n\r\nNot Compatible with RLO Major City Interiors, Use No Player Homes Version \r\n\r\nNow compatible with both Hearthfire AND Skyrim. If you don't have one it will work fine with the other. \r\n\r\nKnown Bugs \r\nNo known bugs at this time.",

      "changelogHtml": " Due to a developer action that deleted the default Navmesh for Breezehome in Hearthfire, a custom piece of coding was cloned and modified from the Hearthfire version of the game and merged into the mod to allow the NavMesh to function. Typically when entering Breezehome using a mod based on the default game the deleted NavMesh causes the game to CTD. To avoid the CTD without making the Mod dependent on Hearthfire the modified clone is used by both versions of Skyrim. 3 Navmeshes are used to accomplish this, the first which tells the default game its NavMesh is deleted, the second which Hearthfire views as a duplicate and the base game sees as a replacement for its own, and the third which tells the game my mod uses a different one so that NPCs function within the home. <br/> \n",
