  "summary": "Rebalancing the vanilla tanning system so that hides and pelts give reasonable amounts of leather.",
  "descriptionHtml": "= What does it do? =\r\nThis small mod chiefly alters the amounts of leather you will get from hides and pelts.\r\n\r\nAs a small side bonus, leather was reduced down to a weight of 1.0 (Mostly to make the math easier so I wouldn\\'t have to alter all the hide and pelt weights too).\r\n\r\nThe Leather Strips recipe was also altered as the idea of getting four 0.1 weight strips out of a piece of leather that would weigh 2.0 (or 1.0 units with this mod) was simply outrageous to me.\r\n\r\n= Why? =\r\nBecause I spent the best part of 20 levels running round with one goat hide in my inventory when you need two to make leather, yet I only need one fox hide to make leather.\r\n\r\n= Installation Instructions =\r\nJust drop \\\"Tanning_Changes.esp\\\" into your \\\"Skyrim/Data\\\" folder and enable it.\r\n\r\n= Requirements =\r\nNone\r\n\r\n= Alterations Made =\r\nLeather - Weight changed from 2.0 to 1.0\r\nLeather Strips recipe - Was 1:4, now 1:10\r\n\r\nThe following leather recipes have had their production ratios altered.\r\n*\tFox Hide - was 1:1, now 2:1\r\n*\tSnow Fox Hide - was 1:1, now 2:1\r\n*\tGoat Hide - was 2:1, now, 1:1\r\n*\tWolf Hide - Unchanged\r\n*\tIce Wolf Hide - Unchanged\r\n*\tDeer Hide (Deer) - Unchanged\r\n*\tDeer Hide (Elk) - Unchanged\r\n*\tCow Hide - was 1:3, now 1:2\r\n*\tHorse Hide - was 1:3, now 1:2\r\n*\tSabre Cat Pelt - was 1:4, now 1:2\r\n*\tSabre Cat Snow Pelt - was 1:4, now 1:2\r\n*\tBear Pelt - was 1:4, now 1:3\r\n\r\n= Version =\r\n03-Oct-2012: 1.0 - Release",
