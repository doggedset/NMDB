  "descriptionHtml": "Thanks to DEADLYSERIOUSGAMES for giving me permission to use his mod of the Dark Brotherhood armor for this retexture.\r\n\r\nThis mod replaces the meshes and textures for the DARK BROTHERHOOD HOOD (thanks to Deadlyseriousgames)  All I did was make it white so that it would go with my retextures of:\r\n\r\nAssassins Creed Linwe Armor\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3406\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nAssassins Creed Thieves\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3498\r\n\r\nYou will need to have the Dark Brotherhood or Ancient Dark Brotherhood hood for this mod.  Also, there are 2 versions included in the download, one has the Assassins Creed insignia and the other does not.\r\n\r\nINSTALL:\r\nMerge data folder with the one in Skyrim Directory.  Make sure your meshes folder is outside and separate from your textures folder in the data folder.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\nIn the data folder of the download there is dbhood.dds (WITHOUT insignia) and a dbhoodx.dds (WITH insignia),  by default when you drop in your skyrim data folder the dbhood.dds will overwrite.   Also, dbhoodx.dds will be listed under it in the directory if you ever want to switch to it, just rename the other to -> dbhood ORIG.dds <- or something to that fact, then take the x off the other file.(that is what I do to have multiple styles of replacers)",
