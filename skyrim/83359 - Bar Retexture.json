  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod so I&#39;m not going toÂ guarantee anything. It works in my game, but I&#39;m not sure how it will look in yours. If you use the textures somewhere else I only ask that you credit me for my work. Feel free to edit it to your liking if you know how to.\r<br />\r<br />P.S. if you have any tips or suggestion for a novice Modder please comment them. Please don&#39;t be too harsh, like I said this is my first actual mod. Constructive criticism is always welcome.",
