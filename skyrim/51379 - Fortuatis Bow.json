  "summary": "The Fortuatis Bow is a unique weapon that levels with your character. As you gain strength, so does the bow. Complete with MCM menu.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Requires Dawnguard DLC, [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/?]SkyUI[/url] for full menu compatibility.\r<br />\r<br />A true hunts(wo)man usually sticks with a weapon (s)he likes, becoming more adept with it as his (or her) skill progresses, but in many games this is not always possible due to upgrade systems that generally include new and better weapons. The Fortuatis Bow aims to change that.\r<br />\r<br />The bow levels as your character does, updating to match the statistics of available bows at particular levels. Once you are past level 50 for example, the bow will match the statistics of the Dragonbone one (and even surpass it if you enable a specific cheat/option available within the MCM Menu :P).\r<br />\r<br />Another unique feature of the Fortuatis Bow is a focussed shot, if you hold the attack button for 3 seconds by default (adjustable in the MCM menu), the power of the shot will be increased by 10% default (can also be changed in MCM menu). \r<br />\r<br />The bow can be upgraded with a dragonbone at any point and can also be enchanted as expected.\r<br />\r<br />So, get out there and love your weapon forever like a true hunter :)\r<br />\r<br />In case your wondering, the weapon(s) can be found in Faendel&#39;s house in Riverwood.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION NOTES \r<br />Please be sure to uninstall old versions first (v1.1 and above come with an in game option to prepare the mod for uninstallation, use this, save your game, then uninstall the actual mod. If you wish to make a clean save at this point, reload your game, make a new save. Finally, install the new version.\r<br />\r<br />VANILLA & REQUIEM (NMM)\r<br />\r<br />Simply download and activate.\r<br />\r<br />SKYRE (NMM)\r<br />Download, and activate. Place Fortuatis Bow Version 2_0.esp before SkyRe_Main.esp & Reproccer.esp before running the reproccer.
