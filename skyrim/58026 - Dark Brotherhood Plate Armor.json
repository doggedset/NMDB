  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guys, just another small mod that I&#39;ve been working on. What it is? This mod is simply a retexture of the vanilla Dark Brotherhood armor found in the base game. I&#39;ve also added some armored plates to make it stand out a bit more. It is found when you would normally receive your DB armor and carries the same enchantments. \r<br />\r<br />Permissions: If you want to use this mod in your work, go ahead and just let me know and give me some credit forÂ the original work.\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda\r<br />Blender 2.49b\r<br />PS\r<br />NifSkope\r<br />modder&#39;s\r<br />\r<br />Thanx and enjoy&#33; :)",
