  "descriptionHtml": "Hey there everyone.  Here are two swords I made for the steam community for Skyrim.  I’ve gotten a lot of requests to bring the swords over to the Nexus…so here they are.  All I ask is if my work is going to be used for other mods to please ask permission first.  All models and textures are original work created by me from scratch.  \r\n\r\nAnyways, the first sword is called Dragon Sting.  The concept for this sword was derived from an old sketch I made a few years back.  This sword is equal in power to the deadric sword.  The second sword is called Nuada Blade.  This sword/blade was used by prince Nuada from the movie Hellboy 2.  The sword is equal in power to the elven sword.\r\n\r\nBoth swords are upgradable and craftable.  They can also be purchased in Whiterun inside the blacksmith’s shop “Warmaidens.”\r\n\r\nIf you like my work then please endorse the mod…thanks.\r\n\r\nInstallation:  To install just drop the two ESP\\'s inside the data folder.  Drop the meshes and texture folder also inside the data folder.\r\n",
