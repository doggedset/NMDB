  "descriptionHtml": "Giving vampire fangs to the native races of Tamriel not only makes them look like stupid Monty Python snake/bunny rejects, it also makes no sense, so I removed them.\r<br />\r<br />The vampire teeth in vanilla aren&#39;t even good ones, heck if they want to bite anything they need to unhinge their jaw and try not to get those snaggleteeth caught in something. I mean, if they have a plastic surgeon in Riften, then there has to be a vampire dentist somewhere right? It&#39;d be even better than a real life dentist b/c you could pay him in skeever tails. Besides, with your fixed teeth Nazir won&#39;t think you&#39;re so poor, and you can show your face around the Cloud District more often.",
