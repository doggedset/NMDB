  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />&#34;when the snow falls and the wind blows, the man dies but the Clan survives&#34;- etched onto the blade\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />- Skyrim patched to 1.9\r<br />- Dragonborn DLC\r<br />\r<br />Recommended:\r<br />- Better Shaped Weapons http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39870/?  (makes all swords look 100x better)\r<br />\r<br />Version Key:\r<br />Version 0.1 - MainFile REQUIRED always\r<br />Version 0.2 - Texture improvement for Clanbringer, replace textures from the main file\r<br />\r<br />Backstory:\r<br />\r<br /> What I liked about Morrowind was all the random unique items, even on side quests. In BloodMoon, when you completed the Mead Hall Massacre quest you got a room, a weapon and a new book for your trouble at a pretty awesome location, the Thrisk Mead Hall.\r<br />\r<br />Originally this mod was just to add a small &#34;home&#34; to the Thrisk Mead Hall in Dragonborn, without messing up the original layout of the hall and without forcing a player to choose rieklings or Nords.\r<br />\r<br />Anyway to make a long story short (too late), this mod escalated to making a weapon with a custom appearance with backstory while still providing my orginal idea of a &#34;home&#34; at Thrisk Mead Hall.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />What you get:\r<br />- A &#34;loft&#34; in the Thrisk Mead Hall. Has a bed, a chair and table, and a chest (nonrespawning) for storage. Works regardless of who you chose as masters of Thrisk.\r<br />\r<br />- A weapon that made an appearance in Bloodmoon Morrowind.  Backstory provided via a journal.\r<br />\r<br />- A new puzzle. Actually a Riddle but it should be easy to figure out if you think about it for a min. that you have to solve in order to get Clanbringer. (see below)\r<br />\r<br />- Added benefit of returning to Thrisk, instead of a one and done attitude like when you go dungeon diving.\r<br />\r<br />Notes:\r<br />- will improve textures and potentially the model in the near future.\r<br />- if asked for I may make a different mod that revamps Thrisk Mead Hall similar (without forsaking this design) how it looked in Morrowind.\r<br />- the pictures do not do the sword justice...download and have a look.\r<br />- for this early release Clanbringer is not enchanted, a latter release will hopefully have a custom enchantment similar to Morrowind&#39;s.\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />\r<br />- Bethesda for Skyrim and Dragonborn and Morrowind and Bloodmoon\r<br />- LeanWolf for making BSW (your files were not included...but it makes clanbringer look better)\r<br />- Nexus for a wide selection of mods\r<br />- GRR Martin for A song of Ice and Fire, the quote that is attached to Clanbringer is a modified quote of his.\r<br />- PrivateEye for his work on making mods that bring Morrowind to Skyrim, he inspires me.\r<br />\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />-ask, most likely I will say yes.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is the riddle/puzzle you have to solve if you want to reforge Clanbringer, on the off chance you didn&#39;t read the journal provided, found in the Mic menu of said forge. DO NOT SPOIL THE ANSWERS IN THE COMMENT SECTION.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Brother to iron, sister to copper&#34;\r<br />&#34;Valued as gold, yet can&#39;t hold its luster&#34;\r<br />&#34;Black as night, yet made in a great light&#34;\r<br />&#34;Hard as steel, cold as winter&#34;\r<br />&#34;Master of forges, Guarded by Lords of the Sky&#34;\r<br />\r<br />",
