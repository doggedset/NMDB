  "descriptionHtml": " This is my first of many different follower mods, hopefully I will get several out per week. \r\nTHIS DOES NOT REQUIRE DAWNGUARD\r\nThis mod adds a new companion to the game, Marzak. He can be found in near the skyforge in whiterun. He is a lightly armored, heavily equipped warrior. \r\nPlease endorse me if you like it!\r\n\r\nMarzak is a true nord who grew up in Windhelm, raised by his father, Darzak. He lived a warriors life, slaying bandits and trolls for Windhelm as head of the guard with his fathers Ebony sword. He was sadly kicked from windhelm when ulfric took power, Ulfric claimed he had stolen from him. Marzak wandered to and fro from city to city looking for a man worthy of his skills. Finally you have come along.",
