  "descriptionHtml": "THERE WILL BE NO SUPPORT/HELP/RESPONSES/TIPS FOR THIS MOD EVER!!! THEREFORE ITS FREE TO BE USED/ABUSED/CHANGED/COPIED/MODIFIED BY ANYONE WHO PLEASES!!!\r\n\r\n20 Jun 12: Open Face Helmet Version added. Use with MadCat221 Open Face Helmets: \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4866\r\n\r\nThis Mod adds a light armor version of the daedric armor to the game. The armor is smithable using the same amount of resources like the heavy counterpart (there is a barrel with 4 daedric hearts behind the stable of Whiterun in case you are desperate).\r\n\r\nThe stats are slightly better than glass armor but certainly not uber (If I remember right, I added +1 base armor on gloves and boots and +2 on cuirass and helmet).\r\n\r\nThe weight is a bit more than glass but far away from heavy armors.\r\n\r\nThere are NO meshes or textures in this mod. The mod uses the meshes/textures of whatever you have installed as your deadric armor (replacer).\r\n\r\nShield not included - only Helmet, Cuirass, Gloves and Boots.\r\n\r\nInfo: I quit modding way before Skyrim came out because of flamers/haters/trolls/younameit. Therefore, I will not support this mod. I made it for myself and it works for me. Take it or leave it. I could have left it sitting on my harddrive but instead I uploaded it. Go figure if I\\'m a nice person, lol.",
