Here is what suits me (well , allmost 99% ^^)\r<br />Wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d release it , and thought : \r<br />&#34;What the heck , after all ...It&#39;s always instructive to get feedback on a creation , no ? \r<br />And maybe some of you will like & use it :-) &#33;&#34;\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s not a &#34;Cheater-House&#34; , so don&#39;t expect to find any \r<br />objects/items/treasure in there (except a couple of hanging ingredients) :-)  \r<br />I didn&#39;t &#34;over-decorate&#34; it either ,(I kinda like &#34;sobriety&#34;)\r<br />so up to you to fill it with your personal style .\r<br />Neither am I a display-case nor mannequin fan .\r<br />I&#39;m not using a companion , so I didn&#39;t set up the patrol-path for the \r<br />guestroom (above the stables) to accept a companion .\r<br />*Edit* : Neither in the manor itself ... Companions will be staying outside .\r<br />This will be looked into & implemented in a future update within the next weeks :-)\r<br />\r<br />But I like to have my storage confortable & well-organized , so I created for \r<br />nearly each container unique Forms and/or ID&#39;s , named to match each &#34;zone&#34; \r<br />(Bedroom dresser ... Basement barrel ... Magic weapon chest ...Office safe ...and so on &#33;...)\r<br />All of them are empty and never respawn .\r<br />Same for the bookshelves . Speaking about those :\r<br />*Each physical shelf has 2 &#34;10-book-containers/triggers&#34;, thus 20 books \r<br />on a shelf-plank (60 books in 1 upper shelf - 6 triggers) .\r<br />Keep in mind that there are 2 triggers per plank ;-)\r<br />\r<br />Last little thing ... \r<br />I&#39;m a &#34;sunday-modder&#34; and very busy in real-life , so I&#39;m not planning to \r<br />make regular updates/evolutions for the time being .\r<br />\r<br />This mod may not be modified without my permission .\r<br />I don&#39;t mean to be rude here , but a little email or private message \r<br />(explaining what you wanna do) doesn&#39;t cost much , no ? \r<br />And I&#39;m not totally &#34;hermetical&#34; ^^\r<br />Thanks .\r<br />This being said , I thank you for reading :-)\r<br />Enjoy your stay @ Dolphyn Estate ;-)\r<br />\r<br />Remcoz\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Description & Info :\r<br />Located just west from Whiterun , Dolphyn Estate is a medium-sized but \r<br />cozy & practical player settlement :\r<br />-Dolphyn Manor (Basement-Living Area-Kitchen-Bedroom-Office-&#34;Mage-Attic&#34;)\r<br />-Exterior (courtyard-stables-guestroom above stables)\r<br />\r<br />So ... you&#39;ll find :\r<br />- All the crafting equipment you may need in the basement .\r<br />- Magic crafting tables in the attic .\r<br />- Cooking equipment in the kitchen .\r<br />- Bookshelves allowing a total of 488 books to be stored .\r<br />- Plenty of &#34;logical & zone-renamed&#34; storage/containers .\r<br />- Sober but subtle decoration .\r<br />- Cozy atmosphere in a nice environment .\r<br />- Stable for you horse\r<br />\r<br />Also ...:\r<br />- Geographically well-settled \r<br />- Once discovered , it will have a map-marker & can be fast-traveled to .\r<br />- All ownerships (containers,doors,crafting equipment & bookshelves) are set to Player .\r<br />\r<br />Requirements :\r<br />-Skyrim.esm\r<br />-Update.esm\r<br />\r<br />Installation : \r<br />Simply drop &#34;Dolphyn_Estate.esp&#34; into your Data folder and \r<br />check in Skyrim-launcher/data files that it is ticked .\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation :\r<br />Simply remove/delete &#34;Dolphyn_Estate.esp&#34; from your Data folder .\r<br />\r<br />Bugs and (in)compatibility :\r<br />None (as far I know) . \r<br />But any other mod affecting that same exterior \r<br />area/cell MAY cause unexpected weirdnesses &#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />*EDIT* Read Please &#33; Concerning Bookshelves :\r<br />I just ran into a strange physics behaviour with the bookshelves in the Living area ...\r<br />I realized that some of them give the message &#34;20 books can be stored&#34; or 13 ... or 16 .\r<br />Strange because I duplicated only 10-book container/triggers . So I checked every shelf , even in the office , and found there also 2-3 shelves for 11 or 12 books .\r<br />I messed up a lil&#39;bit here ^^ Sorry about that .\r<br />I&#39;ll check & fix this for a version 1.1 , certainly by the end of next week , so that every shelf is 2x10 books .\r<br />For the moment , I suggest to Not personalize/store too much yet ... \r<br />Sorry again for the inconvenience :-(\r<br />*end of EDIT*\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Contact : \r<br />Send me a private message @ my nexus-forum-profile :\r<br />http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/798374-remcoz/\r<br />\r<br />©Remcoz 2012 .
