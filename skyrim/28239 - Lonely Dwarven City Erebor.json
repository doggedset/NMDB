In the wall behind Jorvaskr is a door leading to the home they\\'re attempting to rebuild. Inside there are a few followers from the movie, I\\'ll add more later for sure.\r\nI hope to in the future add more dwarves, more of the characters from the movie, and add more hustle and bustle to the city.\r\n\r\n The mod itself adds a few things to your game: The home of the dwarves from the Hobbit that plays as a new city, 3 new lore friendly player Races for elves, dwarves and hobbits, 4 new player followers and marriage options, and a room for your character to live and store items.\r\n\r\nCredits~\r\nApachii for the lovely ApachiiSkyHair\r\n\r\nLEGAL\r\nI do not own the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, or and Tolkien or Peter Jackson works. I\\'m not associated with Tolkien, Peter Jackson, or WB. This mod is just for fun and is not for financial gain, it is free to play.",
