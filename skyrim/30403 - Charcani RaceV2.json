The Charcani are a race of man that dwelled in a underland underneath the land itself deeper then most dwemer ruins reach and are thought to have existed before them to which all knowledge lost with the destruction of there main city Magmar, The Charcani also used a unique form of smelting and creating arms and iron using the very magma that dwelled on there underlands which also caused thier skin to evolve a grey or blacker tint like that of charcoal giving them a resistance to the magma heat around them and a resistance to the cold due to the skin texure being stronger then most other races. It is only recently that Charcani appeared above land again since the First Era one of which lays at the excecutioners stead.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSkill bonuses\r\n?+10 Heavy Armor (level 25) \r\n?+10 Smithing (level 25) \r\n?+5 Destruction (level 20) \r\n?+5 Alteration (level 20 \r\n?+5 One-handed (level 20) \r\n\r\nStarting spells\r\n?Flames (Destruction).
