  "modName": "Restoration Powers - New voice-equipable spells",
  "summary": "Adds a couple of paladin-friendly restoration and alteration spells. The spells allow the caster to use them as shouts; meaning, that they can be used mid-combat with a raised shield.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r\n\r\nThis mod adds three new power-like spells to the game: Healing Prayer (self healing spell), Cry for strength (an armor rating increasing spell, like oakflesh), and Circle of light (an undead repealling spell). All three can be purchased from Lucan Valerius at the Riverwood trader. Their advantage lies in the fact, that they can be used without having to lower your shield/weapon, and equipping the spells with your hands. \r\n===============\r\nAcquisition:\r\n\r\nAll three spells can be purchased at the Riverwood trader, with two editions  Healing Prayer\r\n also found on a shelf in Helgen Keep and in Farengar\\'s quarters in Dragonsreach.\r\n===========\r\n\r\n*UPDATE 2* I\\'ve added two new spells called \\\"Cry for Strength\\\" with an Oakflesh effect, suggested by Zodiac1245, and \\\"Circle of Light\\\" with the effect of repelling nearby undead. The spell tomes can be purchased at the Riverwood trader. The new main file also contains the Healing prayer spell, which can also be purchased from the Riverwood Trader, as well as obtained in any of the previously mentioned locations. Thanks for the suggestion, Zodiac1245!\r\n\r\n*UPDATE 1* The new version of the spell now causes magicka damage, meaning that it is no longer spammable and as such makes for a better the gaming experience. All credit for this new feature goes to Seronalis, without whom, I\\'d still be stuck in trying to figure out, just how to make it work. Thank you.\r\n===========\r\nBUGS\r\n\r\n * Healing Prayer, Cry for Strength and Circle of Light are powers, and as such cannot increase your magic skills. I am currently looking for ways to fix this issue. Any and all help would be much appreciated.",
