This means you&#39;re on your own for a good minute or two while your companion recovers from the long bleed out.\r<br />\r<br />This a very simple mod.  I tested it on 1.9.32 which is the latest version of Skyrim, but I think it should work on older versions too.\r<br />\r<br />You don&#39;t need anything to make this work just add the esp file as a normal mod to your data folder and enable via launcher.\r<br />\r<br />keywords: bleedout, bleed out, rate, longer, companion, companions, knocked, out, low, health, zero, combat",
