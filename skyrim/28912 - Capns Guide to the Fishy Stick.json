You can find it just a bit north of Dawnstar under the boat in the water.\r\n\r\nFor those that don't know this Easter Egg:\r\n\"The Capn's Guide to the Fishy Stick is an in-game book that is unreadable due to being 'smeared with fishy stick sauce'. The Fishy Stick is a reference to an interesting tradition of the Bethesda official forums, giving fishy sticks to new members, which was started by Captain Eldrad, this tradition has been continued on the Nexus Forums, where a senior member bestows a Fishy Stick upon new members.\" - [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Easter_Eggs#Fishy_Stick]UESPWiki[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso available on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=194495234]Steam Workshop[/url].",
