  "descriptionHtml": "SINCE I ADDED A NEW FILE WITH SOME CHANGES THIS ONE HERE WILL BE DELETED SOON\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.5 Thanks to Chachanshenlee (http://www.thenexusforums.com/index.php?/user/3430425-chachanshenlee/) i managed 2 add a non enchanted version into Toldfrs shop at the Mage College, so Kudo the shit out of him.\r\nIf u want a entchanted version u have 2 replace a existing robe with the textzures from teh first file.\r\nThe 1.5 File is Female ready, so if u want 2 make/add a female version, pm me adn i will send u the files.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nThis Retexture is a work for self-statifaction and its my very first texture mod.\r\nSince i find the Arch Mage Robe ugly at finest and i dont wanted to play with armor; i decided it was time 2 retexture a robe.\r\nSInce i aimed for high quality It was a lot more work that i thought and even with some tricks the gold lines took forever to do.\r\nAnd since i did it for myself, why not share when its done.\r\n\r\n\r\nStuff:\r\n\r\nIts only for Male (since i play male)\r\n and female isnt included, if some wants 2 make a female send me a pm (expierenced users[texture mod released]may get the psd for use).\r\n\r\nIts not 100% done since some things bug me and not all textures are altered (not sure if keep at it or not)\r\n\r\nI may add a female version myself but dont count on that hard.\r\nI might change all 3 Robes if this get enough Endorsments and enough people beg for it^^.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Requests:\r\n\r\nIt would be Nice if someone is able to clean the dirt from the normal maps.\r\nI have no clue how 2 do it and would really appreciate that.\r\n\r\nIt would be very nice if some knew how to add this Robe as a 4th Variant ingame (only buy able at shops) so it player exclusive.[enchented versions pls like the normal robes [enchantments respond 2 player lvl]]\r\nPls pm me if u can do it!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nJust simply copy the Data folder into ur skyrim folder.\r\nI suggest NMM for easy in- and deinstallation.\r\n\r\nIt can replace all the Robe Variants in play.\r\nI changed the Apprentice robe (robe_variant1), for the Adapt robe rename the file simply to \\\"...2\\\".\r\nand for the novice robe just \\\"robe\\\" is enough (same system on hood).\r\n\r\nSo thats it, if u like it endorse it pls.\r\n\r\nDonkalleone\r\n",
