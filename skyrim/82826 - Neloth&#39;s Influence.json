  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=6]Neloth&#39;s Influence\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/font]This mod adds several hundred trees and mushrooms to the southern side of Solstheim. The ashlands now consist of thick exotic forests of\r<br />Emperor Mushrooms and ashen Pines. Don&#39;t worry, some areas, such as the area directly east of Tel Mithryn, are still barren ashy wastes,\r<br />but for the most part the southern half of Solstheim now feels much more alien and strange, as well as more dense. You&#39;ll find glowing\r<br />mushrooms at rivershores, and now and then a lantern hanging off of an old Emperor Mushroom.\r<br />\r<br />Just a small mod to make Solstheim feel new. An alternative to Genesis, which I feel goes a bit too green.\r<br />Also, be sure to download Dusty Travels Again for extra aesthetics&#33;[/center]",
