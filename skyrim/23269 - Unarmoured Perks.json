  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a series of five perks within the Block skill tree, tailored towards playing a character without any armour. Why Block? Well...\r\n\r\n-Block allows you to level up the necessary skills and receive perks while not wearing heavy or light armour; which is exactly what this mod is for!\r\n\r\n-Block means that you\\'ll have to work pretty hard if you also want to use the defensive perks from mage skills to become totally unkillable.  \r\n\r\n-You can run around the battlefield in nothing but a chef\\'s hat!\r\n\r\nYou can start training in this perk tree as soon as you want; it does not have any Block prerequisites.\r\n\r\n================\r\n:::OTHER STUFF:::\r\n================\r\nIf you want to dual wield weapons, that means you won\\'t be able to block, and therefore cannot level up these perks, and that\\'s terrible!  Therefore, I - and others - recommend Dual Wield Parrying, found here:  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9247\r\n\r\nI don\\'t know that guy, he doesn\\'t know me, but he sure did make a mod that eliminates a glaring flaw in mine!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very helpful Kayem237 has created a version of this mod that works with SkyRe, if you\\'re into that sort of thing.  Check it out over at:  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23490\r\n\r\n============\r\n:::UPDATES:::\r\n============\r\n8-30-12\r\n\r\n-Fixed an issue with Tempered Flesh not referencing the proper ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n8-29-12\r\n\r\n-Changed the way damage reduction is calculated to bring it in line with Skyrim\\'s existing damage-reducing abilities. Should no longer give more damage reduction than is intended.\r\n\r\n-Removed rank 5 of Tempered Flesh and Arcane Protection to compensate for some other damage reducing abilities. Max damage reduction is now 45%.\r\n\r\n-Changed the way the perks interacted with other armours. Now no longer locks you out of the perk tree if heavy or light armour are over 30; bonuses will only apply when no armour is worn.\r\n\r\nThese changes come from me learning a good deal more about what exactly I was doing, but may still have some issues simply due to my inexperience. If you notice anything, please speak up and let me know, so I can try to fix it.\r\n\r\n==================\r\n:::KNOWN ISSUES:::\r\n==================\r\n-I\\'ve been told that using this in conjunction with SkyRe makes the Shatter and Dispel SkyRe perks disappear, but you can re-enable them with the appropriate console commands.",
