  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new follower to skyrim located in the Bannered Mare , he is essential and comes with his own custom armor set and a silver sword. He has the lightfoot perk so does not set off traps and he also doesnt effect your stealth meter.\r\n\r\nArmounde Demon-Hunter is a Nord warrior raised in a small camp south of the Winterhold College. His parents were both Great hunters and taught him how to track and kill efficiently. At the age of 14 his parents were killed by a Vampire attack on there camp in the dead of night while he was sleeping. When he awoke there was no sign of the vampire, only a note that read \\'\\'Armounde my son, we can hear them coming , we are not sure how long we have left , I have cast an invisibility spell on you to protect you from these abominations , if we are not there when you wake then i am afraid we did not survive the attack. If this is the case then i just want you to know i am not your mother. The creature comeing for us is your true mother, but you must never side with her for she is a vampire! I dont have much time but please, swear to never go near that creature. The noises are closer now, we believe her and her companions have made it past our traps, i love you my son, me and your father will always be with you.\\'\\'\r\nThis was the last he heard from his parents, when he woke up they where not there. Since the day of his parents deaths he has devoted his life to riding Skyrim off all Deadric creatures and dark arts!",
