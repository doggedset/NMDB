  "modName": "Altars and Amulets Redone",
  "summary": "Changes Altars and Amulets so that your actions in the world of Skyrim affect how powerful the blessings you receive are, as well as making it so that having your diseases cured at altars costs gold, so that diseases are no longer meaningless. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Makes the following changes to the way Altars and Amulets work in Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />                    [center][color=blue][size=6]Blessings aren&#39;t free.[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />Upon activating a shrine you are no longer automatically blessed and cured of disease. Instead a pop-up menu will appear giving a brief description of the Aedra/Daedra in question (henceforth referred to as Gods), with the options to receive a blessing, which will cost 100 gold, to have your diseases and poisons cured, which will cost 200 gold, and to do nothing. \r<br />\r<br />[center][color=blue][size=6]Diseases aren&#39;t meaningless.[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />A side effect of this mod is making it that diseases actually have meaning. In vanilla, diseases serve little to no purpose besides making you wonder if you can still finish the current dungeon, or if you have to take the time to walk to an altar. Now that curing diseases at least costs 200 gold, you&#39;ll at least feel a little bit of pain every time you contract a disease. The base cost on cure disease potions has also been increased to 200 gold to keep Altars relevant. If you find it strange that cure disease potions suddenly are so much more valuable in Skyrim, ask yourself this; how much do you think a bottle of liquid that could instantly cure any disease would be worth in real life?\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=blue][size=6]Your Actions Offend or Please the Gods.[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />Your actions in the game determine how powerful the blessings you receive are; in addition, angering a God will result in them smiting you when you use their shrine. For instance, if you allow Erandur to destroy the Skull of Corruption in Nightcaller Temple, all blessings you receive from Altars of Mara in the future will be more powerful, while if you kill Erandur to claim the staff for your own, using an Altar of Mara will result in her smiting you, doing 100 damage, with a message describing why she is angry at you. Note that this mod removes the Agent of Mara and Agent of Dibella buffs; these passive buffs promote the rapid decline in difficulty found in Skyrim, and can be counter-productive to immersion; if you&#39;re a Daedra-worshipping Necromancer, why would Mara be giving you resistance to magic just because you helped a few couples hook up in her name? Instead the quests that give the Agent buffs now significantly improve the Blessing of Mara and Blessing of Dibella buffs. In the images section there is a spreadsheet detailing what quests have what effects on different blessings.\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=blue][size=6]There&#39;s Nothing Inherently Magical About Religious Amulets.[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />Amulets no longer give any benefits unless you are blessed (NPCs still receive benefits without a blessing). There is nothing inherently magical about amulets, so there should be no reason that simply wearing one should give any benefit. If you are blessed by a god however, you will find that wearing an amulet of that god will double the power of the blessing.\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=blue][size=6]Increased Blessing Variety.[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />To increase variety between the different gods, some of the blessings have been changed:\r<br />Akatosh now gives cheaper Destruction spells instead of Magicka Regeneration. (Too similar to Julianos)\r<br />Zenithar now gives better Tempering quality instead of better sell/buy prices. (Too similar to Dibella)\r<br />Mephala now gives cheaper Illusion spells instead of better sell/buy prices. (Too similar to Dibella, and was the exact same as Zenithar)\r<br />Boethiah now increases one-handed and two-handed damage by 10%. (Normally only increases one-handed damage. I don&#39;t really understand the idea that something can make you better at using a sword one-handed, but use two-hands, and suddenly it&#39;s no help whatsoever)\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=blue][size=6]Compatible with most everything.[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />The only vanilla edits these mods make are to shrines,amulets, cure disease potions (looted, not crafted), and the scripts for the Heart of Dibella and Book of Love quests. Everything else is the result of separate files created for this mod in order to reduce compatibility issues; the only known issue is that this mod will overwrite Requiem&#39;s scripts for how blessings work.\r<br /> \r<br />[center][color=blue][size=6]Covers every DLC.[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />There is a version for users who only have Skyrim, users who have Skyrim and Dawnguard, users who have Skyrim and Dragonborn, and users who have Skyrim, Dawnguard, and Dragonborn.\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=blue][size=6]Covers Frostfall Backpacks with Amulets.[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />Extends the amulet changes to the amulets that go on backpacks with the Frostfall mod. These amulets are half as powerful as normal amulets, but still require a blessing to work. However, quests do not make these amulets more powerful; I couldn&#39;t figure out how to increase the power of the amulets without also increasing the carry weight the backpacks give. \r<br />\r<br />[center][color=blue][size=6]Troubleshooting.[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />Important: If you install this mod mid-game, it will break any altars that you&#39;ve already loaded in that game  (which means that you&#39;ve been in the same cell as these altars). Any altars you haven&#39;t loaded yet however, will work with this mod. If you&#39;ve loaded a good number of altars already (As in, you&#39;ve been present in the cell with these altars), then I would recommend not downloading this mod until you start over.\r<br />\r<br />If you have visited any of the Daedric shrines on Solstheim before installing this mod, they will use both vanilla scripts and this mod&#39;s scripts when you use them, resulting in some weird behavior. This is due to the fact that scripts in the DLCs weren&#39;t compiled, so I can&#39;t directly edit them. Also, if you have a blessing on a character prior to installing this, that blessing will not work for getting amulets to work; the amulets work off what is technically a different spell given by altars after this mod is installed. Finally, if you scan these mods with Tes5edit it will say that there is an incompatibility between these mods and the unofficial Skyrim patch; ignore that. Even when I tried rewriting the mods with the Unofficial Skyrim Patch as a master the incompatibility warning appeared, meaning Tes5edit is just confused over the order of properties; all the features of the Unofficial Skyrim Patch are compatible with these mods.",
