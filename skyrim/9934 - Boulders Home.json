  "descriptionHtml": "Update 0.94\r\nChanged name of Strongboxes.\r\nRemoved respawn from Dragon Altar.\r\nAdded twin sister NPCs to Boulders... Erriana and Elliana. One is a general merchant and the other is a follower. They are usually around the workshop/library/living area.\r\n\r\n*Required mods: Apachii Skyhair (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168)\r\nThanks to Apachii for permission to use her mod. \r\n\r\nUpdate 0.93\r\n\r\nAdded Teleport scripts for NMM\r\nExtended Library for all ingame books\r\nMoved Breezehome portal downstairs\r\n\r\nUpdate 0.92\r\n\r\nWARNING: IF YOU HAVE ANY BOOKS IN THE LEFT HAND BOOKSHELVES AS YOU ENTER THE LIBRARY, PLEASE REMOVE THEM. REMOVE WEAPONS FROM THE RACKS ON THE RIGHT SIDE. The right hand bookselves are fine.\r\n\r\nBookshelves and racks in library all placed on one side of the room.\r\nAdded walkways in the swimming baths and navmeshed for followers.\r\n\r\nNote: Followers will come to Boulders but ONLY through the house portals. The teleport spell only transports the player... not sure whether this is the navmesh bug of a scripting issue yet.\r\nIt will be possible to bring your spouse here but at the moment, the only way could potentially break the marriage quest line, especially if you have any marriage mods. Still investigating\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUpdate 0.91\r\n\r\nAdded Container for first key to make it easier to find.\r\nRemoved Portal from second location, replaced with Spell Tome to learn portal to Boulders (req 25 Conjuration).\r\nPlaced Teleport pads in all bought homes to Boulders.\r\n\r\nThanks to Terra Nova, Sirtaj, AliTheLord and h4wkeye for help with spell scripting\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNeeding to get to grips with the CK, I put together this player home with all the features I would like for my own character. Although I originally intended for the place to be quite small, I always seemed to add \\'just one more thing\\' but I think it\\'s about there now.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nEntrance Hall\r\nShrine Junction\r\nKitchen and Dining Area\r\nMain and Guest Rooms (Open plan with kitchen etc)\r\nLibrary and Trophy Room with Dragon Altar\r\nFully Featured Crafting Area\r\nLarge R and R area with swimming pool, archery targets and showers\r\nTreasury\r\nGarden Tower\r\n\r\nLoads of Storage, 18 mannequins, 16 bookshelves and plenty of weapon racks etc.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nI\\'ve lit this for my taste (I prefer dimly lit by candles) but if people want a brighter version, I will upload one.\r\nI have tried to get everything right but as this is my first mod, I\\'m sure there will be things I\\'ve missed. Please let me know if you find any errors. \r\nI had a nightmare of a time setting up the mannequins with many not being lit until they were equipped but altering the loading order seems to have fixed that. I hope it works on your machines as my desk is not up to me banging my head on it for much longer.\r\nTo get fast travel to Boulders, you need to go up into the tower.\r\nIt is Nav meshed and that seems to be ok. Will wait for feedback from others to change it if need be.\r\n\r\nAcquiring Boulders\r\n\r\nYou will need to buy a book from Belethor in Whiterun. The book is called \\'For a Breath I Tarry\\'. There are two cryptic clues to locations where you can find the two keys needed for entry. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the home.\r\n\r\nThanks for the fun Bethesda:)\r\n\r\n",
