Great for dark Dungeons and nights.\r\n\r\nThere is a quiver with 75 in the Riverwood Trader Shop, Just look to your right as you enter. They are on the box next to you. You can craft them with some, Charcoal, SilverIngot and some Firewood.\r\n\r\nYou only get 75 to start so you have to make your own after that. \r\n\r\nI had to figure the creator out by myself so, I appoligize for not being able to pick them back up from the ground. You can however reclaim the ones from the dead if your lucky.",
