It lasts for 30 days there is 200 bottles of the stuff in a bag at High Hrothgar.\r\n\r\nNo need to transfer items into/out of your inventory to a knapsack etc.\r\n\r\nSome hero of old left part of his kit behind after visiting the Greybeards. It can be found behind the first stone bench as you enter on the left hand side of High Hrothgar. \r\n\r\nI\\'m not much of a mod, but this works on my PC, so I assume that it will work on yours.\r\nJust put in your Data folder ( mine is in: Program Files (x86)\\\\ Steam \\\\ SteamApps\\\\ common \\\\ skyrim \\\\ Data \\\\    )\r\n\r\nPlease place feedback (good or bad) \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\nRob.
