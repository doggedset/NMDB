Also because of the angling it wouldn\\'t sit straight on shield wall displays either. This mesh replacer is an attempt to deal with those issues.\r\n\r\nThe shield is one and a half tenths smaller, reangled and repositioned. It will still clip with some things, but not much more than other shields. It is now closer to the size of the Iron Banded Shield.\r\n\r\n================\r\n= Installation =\r\n================\r\n\r\n1. Copy and paste the meshes folder from the extracted archive into \\\"Skyrim\\\\Data\\\".\r\n\r\n\r\n==================\r\n= Uninstallation =\r\n==================\r\n\r\nDelete the following files:\r\n\r\nData\\\\Meshes\\\\armor\\\\shieldofysgramor\\\\1stpersonshieldofysgramor.nif\r\nData\\\\Meshes\\\\armorshieldofysgramor\\\\shieldofysgramor.nif\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n= Permissions and Usage =\r\n=========================\r\n\r\n1. 1.
