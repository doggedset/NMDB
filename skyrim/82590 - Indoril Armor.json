  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]CREDIT GOES TO MCMUFFIN FOR HIS ORDINATOR ARMOR, AND TO NATTERFORME FOR PORTING IT TO SKYRIM. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Adds &#34;Indoril Armor&#34; Basically just McMuffin&#39;s Ordinator Armor, but truer to the original Morrowind design. \r<br />\r<br />It may not look world&#39;s apart from McMuffin&#39;s design, but there are noticeable differences. I gave more saturation to the textures, placed original Indoril armor textures over, and removed the sash on the front. \r<br />\r<br />You can find the armor on top of Refugee&#39;s Rest near Windhelm. \r<br />\r<br />Textures are from Morrowind so they&#39;re obviously not going to be drop-dead gorgeous. \r<br />\r<br />You do not have to download Natterforme&#39;s mod before this. Everything is there. \r<br />\r<br />[/size]We&#39;re watching you. Scum.",
