  "descriptionHtml": "To celebrate the opening of the Steam Workshop for Skyrim, Valve and Bethesda have teamed up to bring you the Portal 2 Space Core mod, which \r<br />will let the aggressively space-centric little robot tag along on your \r<br />adventures in Tamriel.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Also, since Skyrim was the only major release of 2011 without Nolan North in it, you should consider this mod a patch to fix that problem. \r<br />You can now feel free to include Skyrim in the &#34;Nolan North&#34; section of \r<br />your video game library, which is to say, your video game library.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />To play this mod, all you need to do is click the green Subscribe button. The next time you launch Skyrim, it will download and install \r<br />the mod. That&#39;s all there is to it&#33; If you stay subscribed to a mod, \r<br />future updates will be downloaded automatically.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />_________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />We have identified a fix for the .ckm problem that some users are experiencing. We hope to roll the fix into a Steam update as soon as \r<br />possible. In the meantime, if you are experiencing this problem and \r<br />submit a Steam Support ticket, we can assist you with instructions for \r<br />working around the error.\r<br />",
