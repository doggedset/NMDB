HomeLand of the Nord Race .But there was once a time when Skyrim was as green as a spring day in Cyrodil. Then there were Nords who worshipped Dragons as Gods,Nords Who Worshipped Molag Bal in hopes of gaining his gift of immortality. And even Nords who worshipped the Daedric Prince of the Hunt Hircine and became like Wild Beasts. \r<br />\r<br />During this time there was a group of Hircines Followers Who worshipped the goddes Kyne as well as Hircine. Kyne being the goddess of the Skies and Wildlife was thoguht to be the aedric  Counterpart to Hircine. \r<br />These people prayed to Kyne in hopes of gaining control of their beast blood so their children will not be overcome with bloodlust and animalistic instinct. Kyne Hearing thier prayers bestowed on them the gift of Children who integrated the Aspect of the Wolf that their parents gained From Hircinewith their human will and concience. these children were the beginnings of a new race that balance the forces of daedric and aedric influence. they have some of the characteristics of the beast their parents Turned in to but their overall form was that of a Nord, Argonian and Kahjiit. For instance the Werecats/Khajiit offspring had the bodies of nords but the ears and tails of their khajiit parents.\r<br />The Werecroc/Argonian offspring had the horns tail and feet of an argonian but the bodies of nords. The nords had the combination of werebear and werewolf  forms but the werebears refused to worship Kyne and were banished from the valley and so didn&#39;t recieve her blessing. But some of the werewolves did and so the children with wolf ears and tails and feet were born. However over time the werecat and the werecroc bloodlines began to die off due to the rareness of nord/khajiit,Nord/Argonian intermarriage. the Argonian and Khajiit children were able to be born because their parents had the blessings of Kyne and the animal blood Gift of Hircine. \r<br />   Now there is only one diminished bloodline with the werecat blood and no werecrocs left. The dominant race that is the more well known Race is now what is refered to as the Lycaea race. however this name was meant to mean Blessed of the Wilds. which encompasses more than just the wolf breed. \r<br />  The Kitlings and the wolflings are the remaining races in the valley. However it is the Wolflings who Govern it due to their more prolific bloodline. They were afraid of what the Pure Nords would do if they discovered their existence and so they closed of the valley. Now after thousands of years the valley has been discovered by a silver hand Leader by the name of Kaim SilverSmith.\r<br />  The Alpha of the Wolflings recieved a Vision from Kyne that they were in danger and that a gods blessed Hero would be their salvation. And so they sent out scouts to locate this hero the one called Dragonborn. Seeing as they couldn&#39;t leave personally they sent out their pure nordic werewolf families with instructions to give a note to the nearest Courier service.....\r<br />***************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />**Update 1.0*** \r<br />ok i did a little altering of the village still needs a little more but ill get to that soon \r<br />i also added the map marker to the entrance to the valley but youll still need to discover the location to be able to fast trqavel to it \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-adds the lycaea race as several different hybrids nord imperial breton redguard and so on \r<br />-added a small valley with a village and 2 Lycaea Followers in the mountains south of riften near the burned down farm house \r<br />-some wildlife \r<br />-unque buildings \r<br />- a statue in the middle of the village \r<br />-added an alchemist and Hunter Merchant \r<br />-2 followers one has his own house \r<br />-added interior to a house \r<br />-unique weapon from the hunting merchant \r<br />-added an inn \r<br />-added a wolf pet \r<br />-added a Bard to the Inn \r<br />-added a small bandit campsite to the valley with two lycaea bandits \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-will be added - \r<br />\r<br />-interior for the Player&#39;s House \r<br />-more npcs \r<br />-a couple quests (hopefully) \r<br />-a mine \r<br />-some caves \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />im going to make compatibility patches for some of my mods like im planning to add lycaea adoptible children and a player home for hearthfire patch in the lycaea valley \r<br />\r<br />for the dawnguard patch ill add a room with the totems of hircine and a couple special spell tomes adding new howls to your human form and boosting some stats and things for your werewolf forms \r<br />\r<br />and for the dragon born patch ill add random attacks to the valley by werebears and silver hand \r<br />\r<br />pics coming soon",
