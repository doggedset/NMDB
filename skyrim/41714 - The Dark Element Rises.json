  "summary": "An introduction of a new Element to the world of Skyrim. The Dark element.",
  "descriptionHtml": "When Dawnguard came out and introduced the sun damage element to players siding with the dawnguard i had always hoped that they would also include an element with opposite effects for vampires, but unfortunately they never did. So i decided to create one myself to fill the gap. The dark element works in the same way that the sun element, but instead of dealing damage (or in the case of enchants, extra damage) to undead it effects LIVING creatures instead. Also, instead of working over a certain amount of time it hits only once but carries a paralize effect as well. Although, in order to keep it more balanced, the extra damage of enchants as well as the paralize effect do not effect dragons or otherworldly creatures(think Daedra). While I did intentionally create it for vampires in the dawnguard expansion the spell tome that teaches the spell \\\"Shadow\\'s Caress\\\" should be sold by any mage that sells conjuration spell books and the preset enchanted weapons should also be sold at the respective merchants (and yes, they are dis-enchantable). For now the only preset enchanted weapons are 3 varying iron and 3 varying ebony swords. Like the vanilla enchanted weapons there are 6 different versions of the enchant on the weapons; Iron Sword of Shadow, Shades, and Twilight + Ebony Sword of Nightfall, Eclipse, and Darkness. All of the animations, sound effects, and visuals use the vanilla+dawnguard parts of other spells, shouts, and effects so any mods that change these should be fine with this mod although i cant guarantee it. Because I used some Dawnguard items in the effects for the spell you will probably need Dawnguard for it to fully work (although if you have the CK and want to replace the effects used or dont care if you have them it should work just fine with just vanilla skyrim).\r\n\r\nMods Shown in Screenshots\r\n\r\n          R18Pn 01 - Eisen Platte Armor for UNP and CBBE V3 V2 by NPR. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11050//?\r\n\r\n          The cowl from Arise - Chapter 1 - The Black Sacrament by AmethystDeceiver. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5696/?\r\n\r\n          Skyrim Naruto Anime Overhaul by gyn for the Kamui power-Made the area that i tested the spell on. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15699//?\r\n\r\nPS: I may add more things to this mod as it comes along and any ideas or advise would be more than welcome. I am in the process of adding a new keyword to the different races so that the spells and enchants can be more streamlined as well as adding preset enchants to all of the weapons tiers that have presets in vanilla, dawnguard, and dragonborn.\r\n\r\n\r\nLatest Update\r\n\r\n9/7/2013\r\n\r\n-Added the new spell \\\"Nightfall\\\" which is a Dark element AoE spell. Can be purchased at any merchant that sells Adept level Conjuration spells.\r\n-Added the Living keyword to Dragonborn only enemies as well so they are now affected.\r\n-Added preset sun enchanted weapons which are added to the random drop and vendor\\'s random inventory.\r\n\r\n9/8/2013\r\n\r\n-Added the new spell \\\"Embrace of Shadows\\\" which is a Dark element cloak spell that absorbs the health of enemies with the living keywork in a 10 feet radius around the caster for the duration of the spell. Can be purchased at any merchant that sells Adept level Conjuration spells.\r\n-Added the first 2 spells, \\\"Shadow\\'s Caress\\\" and \\\"Nightfall\\\", to vampires and draugr scourges. Only the higher level draugr have shadow\\'s caress while and only the strongest one has both. Similar for vampires except the only the stronger boss level vampires have nightfall and the normal vampires dont get shadow\\'s caress until the bosses have nightfall.",
