/>-----&gt; [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57031?]here for more fps(c.o.t v5 less fps than v3.1)[/url] &lt;-----\r<br />\r<br />This versions is more upated with tools and versions for more recent and decent graphic cards, this version is the continuity of enb fps lossless cited upper.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd966]First you can use this sweetfx not yet released in fps lossless without use of enb[/color], enb usage is stricly limited to the first effects without objects post processing and almost any other options not even shadows fixes, enb config file is very simple and not optimised for your needs, [color=#6aa84f]using enb is essentially for magic atmosphere amplified due to mods usage[/color].\r<br />\r<br />[color=#5b0f00]INSTALL\r<br />---------[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#6aa84f]You need 2 files and eventually one tool that suit with this sweetfx special version.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />ENB SERIES 0.292(not injector folder but

the one that come from sweetfx into d3d9_sweet.dll[/color]\r<br />\r<br />After all files into skyrim main directory, you finish by pasting all archive content in same folder.\r<br />\r<br

IMPROVMENTS AND MODS\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b6d7a8]O Personnal use of a combined files set(config file of categorized favorite menu) into one for french and english and mods(all mods i found fixing their synthax into one more compliant, maybe not the last if originial author change it regulary in the end&#33;) in english(plus usage of sets as explained not usable dynamically but i ll use numpad due to simple use of others keys due to functionnalities combined and restricted according to mod for changing keys behavior...), the combined file is in progress(a lot of mods you are probably not aware)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />O The use of a trick with ahk to dynamically change the file content of a mod called morehotkeys,because author saidee we can do it and i tested already, i want to use too numpad here by changing the keycode avaible in config files.\r<br />The same that use the key x(or any other with scan codes and virtuals key described in the config file), that key help to remain earlier used hands, exemple keep a magic and weapon before and after usage of one weapon ability to stagger and block, very efficient against all type of ennemies met.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />O Need to rebind keys used with &#39;more hotkey please&#39; mod, it doesnt works as expected while active combat , this mod help to choose same key to be triggered using three modes(principaly),double tap long press and press(normal usage works well for remain other hands),but that fail completly because no response,no acting while attacked,too long to be made,no launch at all using doubletap or holdpress(maybe bad timing but i tried several values for different time configurations in mcm :() , hopefully i use smart cast too :)\r<br />\r<br />OAnother mod to help to use keys but really with modified keys like control alt and altgr(i think i need rebind altgr cause it works only for control and ctrl is not working...), this mod add functionnalities for sure but morehotkeys doesnt do that correctly or the rebing doesnt works as expected, so i never used k to records keys with a modified keys(ctrl,alt,shift, altgr ???, need test numpad on/off too by mods)[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59171/?]AH Hotkeys[/url]\r<br />\r<br />OI just found this mod that can too much things,remain me i used ahk to launch salves of quick fireball launch one by one hand by hand, this mod can too launch command as it was the case with autohotkeys usage in skyrim [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88/?]Interface Hard Coded Key Tweaks[/url]\r<br />\r<br />O Wanna finish all requirements and improvments to achieve completly this quest that give a special object and permanent abilities by killing the height dragon priest by combining them to obtain another ninth dragon priest mask.\r<br
