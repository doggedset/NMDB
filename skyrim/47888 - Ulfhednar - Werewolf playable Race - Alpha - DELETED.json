  "descriptionHtml": "D E S C R I P T I O N\r<br />This race is fully playable and avaliable in the race menu.\r<br />All started when I was exploring the BSA, and in the character assets folder I had a suprise. A werewolf head and the mouth, both coming with a .tri. This is awesome&#33;\r<br />It&#39;s strange nobody realized it before me. It&#39;s a nice opportunity to learn texturing, I thought&#33;\r<br />The race was completely lacking textures, (Bethesda removed them) and I created them from scratch.\r<br />I It took me a while, but I&#39;m satisfied with the result since I&#39;m a newbie at texturing.\r<br />The head is animated, though facial expressions are quite limited.\r<br />\r<br />READ THIS&#33; \r<br />1: This mod IS required, or the game will not start. \r<br />Racecompatibility by TMPhoenix: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24168/? \r<br />\r<br />2: It&#39;s hightly recommended to use Racemenu with this mod, since current color options usually are terrible. For now. \r<br />\r<br />3: Some features require SKSE. You can devour the bodies of humanoids by pressing &#34;n&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />L O R E \r<br />\r<br />There are tales of mysterious werewolves that resemble people, but their heads are twisted, wolflike and their bodies are covered of fur. \r<br />They first of this race, were once powerful, ancient warriors that used to wear wolf pelts in the battle. But Hircine cursed them, fixing the pelts on their skin, turning them into monsters. \r<br />Not the usual lycantrophes everyone knows about. The Ulfhednar are smart, agile but still fierce. \r<br />\r<br />V E R S I O N S\r<br />\r<br />Version 0: Alpha released.\r<br />\r<br />Version 0.1: Lot of new features&#33;\r<br />-Added a tail\r<br />-Added an hairstyle\r<br />-These new features require SKSE&#33; Press n when aiming at a body to feed on it. Thanks to hiryuu19 for his scripts.\r<br />-Custom armors now work, Thanks to hiryuu19.\r<br />-Included racecompatibility.esm by TMPhoenix http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24168/?\r<br />-Fixed face paints\r<br />\r<br />Version 0.2:\r<br />-Some fixes\r<br />-now on Steam Workshop\r<br />\r<br />Version 0.3:\r<br />Better textures, fixed skills.\r<br />\r<br />P L A N N E D\r<br />\r<br />As for 2/6/2015, I have no plans to continue this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[s]-Make a full dungeon, with the possibility to get the curse through the cursed blood. Actually is pretty much coded, but the dungeon isn&#39;t finished.\r<br />I still thinking about a background, and some lore books to add.\r<br />\r<br />-Fix the companion quest.\r<br />\r<br />-Add a tail. \r<br />[b]Added&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />-Maybe some other small fixes.\r<br />\r<br />-Hairstyles?\r<br />[b]One hairstyle added&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />-Improve the role playing (actually people don&#39;t even notice you are a Werewolf)[/s]\r<br />\r<br />C R E D I T S\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda for giving us this awesome game, and be so kind to leave the unused head. But no textures...\r<br />\r<br />hiryuu19 for being awesome, helping me solve problems and providing me nice scripts. Thank you, now I really want to work on this mod :)\r<br />\r<br />KrittaKitty for the textures ported from the Likayos race.Â http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57109/?\r<br />\r<br />TMPhoenix for the racecompatibility mod \r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24168/?\r<br />Lot of thanks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />P E R M I S S I O N:\r<br />As I don&#39;t work on this anymore, feel free to use this as a free resource.
