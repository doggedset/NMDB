  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\r<br />[font=Century Gothic][SIZE=7][color=#c00000][b]The Fox&#39;s Den[/b][/color][/SIZE][/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]70F8lfFfhcM[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Impact][size=5][color=#366092]VERSION 1.6.5[/color][/size][/font]\r<br />[line]\r<br />The newest version update is finally here&#33;  Please make sure to uninstall old versions of the mod and use a clean save before updating since I&#39;ve made quite a few changes to several areas and I don&#39;t want you to lose anything.  Thank you&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />A Vanilla home that&#39;s Starter friendly with the ability to upgrade&#33;\r<br /> After releasing my original Fox Den mod, I realized that the initial starting quest (and therefore the ability to access the player home) was substantially more work to obtain then what the majority of users wanted; I set out to make an easier version of the mod so anyone could get the house.  Due to some of the augments on equipment I placed in the mod, as well as some items and the amount of gold obtainable with the original version in mind, I have initially disabled some of the things that would make the mod overpowered for a beginning character.  Everything in the original version is still there, however in order to access/unlock everything, you still need to complete &#34;Under New Management&#34; and do the original house obtainment quest &#34;The Fox&#39;s Legacy&#34;. Everything will fully unlock once you reach that point.  For a complete list of things that are locked at the beginning, please refer to the ReadMe file.\r<br /> \r<br />I originally made this player home mod after not being satisfied with the reward you get from becoming the Thieves&#39; Guild master.  I came across [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38458]The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal[/url] by Iceburg, and it inspired me to create a house based on the famed Gray Fox. It is my first attempt at a mod for Skyrim. The whole idea is based around the question, &#34;What kind of house would the Gray Fox have in Skyrim?&#34; I tried to make the house as inclusive as I possibly could while trying to stay lore friendly.  Assuming that the Gray Fox was the best thief ever, and he is technically different people throughout the years, he would have collected a great deal of rare and powerful things.\r<br />  \r<br />Therefore The Fox&#39;s Den has some special equipment and gold.  It is for that reason, it could be considered overpowered. To compensate for this, I have made it a prerequisite that you complete the &#34;Under New Management&#34; quest in order to completely unlock all of the content.  I realize that it is a pain to get to that point if you haven&#39;t already completed it, but it was the only way I saw it to fit my storyline that unfolds within my questline.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Impact][size=5][color=#366092]Features[/color][/size][/font][line]\r<br /> The following is included within the house.\r<br />3 Unique Quests that unlock the house, unlock all the features, and a follower\r<br />Main hall\r<br />Dining Hall\r<br />Kitchen\r<br />Master Bedroom\r<br />Master Bathroom with working Hot tub, Shower, Sink, a pool, and of course a latrine\r<br />Teleporters\r<br />Teleportation Room to all the major cities\r<br />Home Teleport Spell\r<br />Follower&#39;s Quarters with enough room for 6 NPCs\r<br />Personal Vault\r<br />Dragon Mask displays\r<br />Dragon Claw displays\r<br />Thieves Guild trophy displays\r<br />Crafting Room\r<br />Armory\r<br />Storage/Display Room\r<br />Prison with a torture room\r<br />Stables\r<br />Airship Dock\r<br />Smuggling tunnel\r<br />Garden\r<br />Mine\r<br />Brewery\r<br />Small Library\r<br />7 exits throughout Skyrim\r<br />Unique Horse\r<br />Chef/Merchant\r<br />Bard\r<br />3 Followers\r<br />Several secret passages\r<br />All of the Shrines\r<br />All of the Doomstones\r<br />3 unique daggers, a unique bow and arrows\r<br />Unique stats on several pieces of Armor\r<br />A new Conjuration spell\r<br />Several Unique books that explain the story behind the house and the legend of the Gray Fox\r<br />Unique challenges\r<br />A lot of gold and crafting supplies\r<br />Every chest, barrel, urn, and furnishing within the mod is safe unless otherwise stated with (Respawns) in the activator&#39;s description.\r<br />over 20 mannequins\r<br />RLO (Real Lighting Overhaul) Friendly\r<br />lots more&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I have intentionally made a trap that should kill you if you make the wrong choice on a path, but I have put various shadowmarks in to help guide you.  I also wanted to make the home something you really had to earn. After you gain access to the home, there are no more real dangers (minus the prison- there are 3 monsters in cells down there... Once you have officially entered the home, be sure to search around everywhere and in everything as there are numerous keys to fully unlock all the doors and chambers as you explore the layout.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Impact][size=5][color=#366092]Planned updates for the future[/color][/size][/font]\r<br />[line]\r<br />After a long break, I&#39;m finally back and had lots of time to be inspired by the potential of what my mod could be.  That being said, current things in the works are expanding the mine, adding a farm with livestock, adding some new storylines to go along with new areas, expanding the sewer and tunnel systems within my mod, adjusting access points for various stages of completion within the Thieves&#39; guild and expanding on weapons and resources available within the house.  Also, in the future, I would like to further enhance the customization of the house to the user in a sense of selecting the type of furnishings and various flags/colour schemes for the various rooms.  However, the customization end will be in distant future due to real life time constraints outside of my modding time.  I&#39;ll continue to keep everyone posted as things progress.  I plan on releasing that advanced version as a separate mod to help people distinguish the two.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Impact][size=5][color=#366092]Current Known Issues[/color][/size][/font]\r<br />[line]\r<br />Load order seems to be an issue this time round and the exact cause is unknown at this time.  Using BOSS and Wrybash to attempt to correct the issue doesn&#39;t seem to work, however since LOOT has been released, I haven&#39;t personally had issues.  Typically keeping it at the bottom of the mod load order does the trick.  Also, there seems to be some sort of occasional CTD happens when using the teleporters, again, I don&#39;t know why this happens, but I&#39;m attempting to correct it as soon as I find out what&#39;s causing it.  City augmenting mods like JK&#39;s City overhaul do interfere with my COS marker and I&#39;m working on a fix for the next patch.  Thank you for your patience.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Impact][size=5][color=#366092]Final Comments[/color][/size][/font]\r<br />[line]\r<br />This is my first mod, and in a sense is a continual WIP, as I learn more about modding or become inspired about various concepts to incorporate within the mod, I add them.  Please feel free to give me any feedback about the house both good and bad via comments, PMs or Youtube and if you liked the mod, ENDORSE PLEASE&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />The Mod has been scrubbed with the latest version of TES5Edit.\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />Check out my other mod here:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52085/?]Suzy&#39;s Dump[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Impact][size=5][color=#366092]Enjoy&#33;[/color][/size][/font][/center]",
