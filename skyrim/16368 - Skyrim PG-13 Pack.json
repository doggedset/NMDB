  "descriptionHtml": "Don\\'t want blood and gore?\r\nLook at Skyrim\\'s rating. \r\nWith this modpack, Skyrim will become as if it\\'s: TEEN for suggestive themes and violence.\r\nThat\\'s right! Finally convince your parents to let you play Skyrim.\r\nUse my mod along with Citizen86\\'s no blood mod (included in pack).\r\nAlso includes instructions to turn off gore in Skyrim.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Brinaq is not affiliated with Citizen86\r\nThere will be a small splash of blood in the very beginning, but that will be all.\r\nView Citizen86\\'s no blood mod on this website for more details on that.\r\n\r\nMy modification edits a few \\\"inappropriate\\\" things out of the game.\r\nAnd the instructions to take away gore works, no downloads required!\r\n\r\nPlease read all the readme\\'s and notes included in the pack!",
