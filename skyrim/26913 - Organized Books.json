  "summary": "Lightweight mod that fixes various titles of books, recipes, and notes, while still staying lore-friendly. Featured on GEMS. Now with DLC support&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/mN0rn.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][center][b]Details[/b][/center][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Organized Books is a lightweight mod I made when frustrated with the inconsistencies and improper sorting of the ingame books. I was also frustrated with not knowing whether I had all the books in a series or not. My mod fixes these issues, while staying as true to lore as possible. Nothing new was added; only names of vanilla books were edited. For example, the book title [i]The Wolf Queen, v4[/i] has been changed to [i]Wolf Queen, Vol. 4 of 8[/i]. Chapters of a book are also labeled as such; for example, [i]A Dance in Fire, v1[/i] is now [i]Dance in Fire, Ch. 1 of 7[/i].\r<br />\r<br />Recipes, including Atronach Forge recipes, have also been renamed; since it was nigh impossible to distinguish a shopkeeper&#39;s recipe from your own without buying it, I assigned each version of a certain recipe a number for easy distinction.\r<br />\r<br />I also removed any articles from the beginnings of titles, unless it modified the meaning of the title itself. For example, [i]The Lusty Argonian Maid, v1[/i] is now [i]Lusty Argonian Maid, Vol. 1 of 2[/i]. and [i]The Legend of Red Eagle[/i] is now [i]Legend of Red Eagle[/i]. Any articles or prepositions within the body of the title have been made lower case as well.\r<br />\r<br />I have plans to scrub each and every book of any inconsistencies, spelling errors, grammar errors, and lore errors; this will take a while, so please be patient. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to message me or add me on Steam (same nick). Thanks&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][center][b]Installation[/b][/center][/size]\r<br />\r<br />If using the Nexus Mod Manager or another mod manager, simply click &#39;Download with Manager&#39; and activate the plugin from there.
