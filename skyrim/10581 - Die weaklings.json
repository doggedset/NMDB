  "descriptionHtml": "Now, I know what you\\'re thinking: \\\"Hasn\\'t this been done a million times before?\\\"\r\nNot the way I do it. With this file, you can have all skills at 100, all perks, and tons of health, magicka, and stamina. BUT you will stay at level 1. The point of this is so that your enemies stay weak instead of at level 81. Let me know if there are any problems, big or small. This mod has been tested and it works perfectly.\r\nInstallation:\r\n1) Extract into Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\n2) Do NOT put it in the Data folder! Very important!\r\n3) Start Skyrim\r\n4) Open the console using ~\r\n5) Type \\\"bat giveskillsnolevel\\\" (no quotes)\r\n6) Enjoy your overpowered character!",
