That&#39;s an honorable path you&#39;re on, friend.\r<br />- I know of your deeds, and am honored to address a member of the Companions.\r<br />- Heard about what you did. Killing those foul witches. Well done, Companion.\r<br />- I heard about the attack on Jorrvaskr, and the killing of your honored leader. You have my  sympathies, Companion.\r<br />- Kodlak White-Mane has been laid to rest, I know. May his soul live forever in the halls of Sovngarde.\r<br />- You... you&#39;re the Harbinger. Of the Companions. It is my honor to stand before you.\r<br />- I hear the East Empire Company has reopened, thanks in no small part to you. Well done. All of Skyrim benefits from their trade.\r<br />- You did this city a great service by catching that killer. Well done.\r<br />- By Ysmir, you&#39;ve helped save the Gildergreen. Words can&#39;t express what that means to this city.\r<br />- That sapling you recovered means the Gildergreen will live again. Your deed honors the people of Whiterun.\r<br />- You&#39;ve actually done it. You&#39;ve found the Sybil of Dibella.

Nothing in your game will change EXCEPT for the animation itself.  The dialogue is the standard game dialogue.\r<br />- DO NOT message me about the screenshots...commenting on how my &#34;guards&#34; are somehow ruining your game, or the integrity of the game.  They are a combination of my own personal mods that I use in my game.  I am aware that they are female.  I am aware that they have boobies.  I am aware that people don&#39;t dress this way in &#34;real life&#34;.  You opinion has been noted.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=yellow][center]***That being said...enjoy the mod for what it&#39;s worth***[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
