They will use existent Skyrim killmove animation, because creating new animations for killmoves is impossible, at least for a while, due to skeletons. [color=red]Video coming soon.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=red]Force the killmoves to play in first person :[/color] Every kilmove in the game ( except the dragon ones and other creatures for the moment, because of script issues ) will now play in first person, no matter what. Yes, even the standard 2H killmoves that don\\'t have any first person counterpart. [color=red]Video coming soon.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=red]A more complete first person experience :[/color] Small things like the animation of your character sitting on a chair ( it\\'s all i managed to fix at the moment ) will play in first person . [color=red]Video coming soon.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=red]Fully created and fully compatible with real 1st person mod :[/color] FPKE was created, and tested with a real 1st person base. You can\\'t have a decent first person experience without it. More informations coming soon.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
