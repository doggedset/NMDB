Just like I did with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50964/?]The Golden Rose[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59483/?]The Bloody Tankard[/url], everything is buyable and droppable for maximum compatibility; none of the items have been added to leveled lists or placed around the world. I made it so you could install it and keep it, instead of feeling you should uninstall the mod once it&#39;s summer and the holiday spirit is gone ;)\r<br />\r<br />German translation available [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58826/]here[/url]. Thanks, Taryl80&#33;[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/qKyRei4.png[/img][/center]\r<br />The Merry Snowberry is located at the [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Solitude_Lighthouse]Solitude Lighthouse[/url], at the very northernmost of Haafingar Hold. There is no map marker specifically made for the little shop, but the Lighthouse itself has a marker that needs to be discovered before you can fast travel.\r<br />\r<br />Inside, you will meet Kavanagh Honey-Hand and Hulgar Stoneback, a young couple who have started a small business. Kavanagh will sell food, while Hulgar will sell wrapped presents, some table decorations, candles, spell and recipe books, festive trees and hats, for you to place around your home.\r<br />\r<br />The food has your usual effects, and I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not planning on making patches for needs mods. I included cooking recipes, in case you&#39;d prefer to make your own meals. I, however, did not make the presents and trees craftable. Why not? Well, all you could use for crafting, say, the trees, is firewood, and that just doesn&#39;t do the trick...\r<br />\r<br />The presents do not do anything, so don&#39;t expect to activate them in your inventory and receive a full set of Daedric armor&#33; The candles also do not emit light, although they have an animated flaming wick. To compensate for this, I made a simple, silent variant of the Magelight spell that will last for 30 days, allows you to place multiple lights, and requires no Magicka to be cast.\r<br />\r<br />About the trees, I made four variants, a plain one with no decorations, a common one with simple round ornaments (based on the model of Meridia&#39;s Beacon), an upper one with retextured Soul Gem pieces (they point to the texture of the Greater Soul Gem, because the original texture was too dark), and a personal favorite, the Dwemer one, with downsized Dwemer gyros. I also included a smaller tree in case you think the others are too big. They have no animations; I tried to give them some visual magic effects, but they kept making my game crash, so I discarded the idea.\r<br />\r<br />All items in the mod, with two small exceptions, use vanilla textures to reduce filesize, so they may look a bit different in your game. The only custom textures are the outside sign, and the festive hat. As I was feeling adventurous, I decided to include some apparel, but after failing spectacularly at making proper clothes (I&#39;m not a very good texture maker and I couldn&#39;t import even vanilla clothing meshes as standalone...), I settled for the hat. The enchanted version will slightly increase the chance of successfully persuading someone when worn.\r<br />\r<br />The store will be open all day for you to browse (because I cannot for the life of mine make working locklists), but items will be sold only from 8 AM to 20 PM. It also is fully navmeshed, so bring along your friends&#33; Just be careful not to bump things and send them flying across the room.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The Merry Snowberry was also included in Skytts&#39; &#34;Fallout New Vegas and Skyrim Mods Weekly - Christmas Special&#33;&#34; Skip to 07:20&#33;\r<br />[youtube]pJFtcn7ydTA[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[center][/center][center][img]http://i.imgur.com/0hTN49O.png[/img][/center]\r<br />Extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/VtE62jQ.png[/img][/center]\r<br />Simply delete the files with the name [font=courier]  &#34;FestiveClutter01&#34;  [/font] from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Although you will have broken my heart...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/mNaQga8.png[/img][/center]\r<br />Because this is Skyrim we&#39;re talking about, my items tend to spazz out and jump around when you place them too close to each other, to other things, or whenever they are touched by an NPC or the player. Not much I can do about that, unfortunately.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to get the items but don&#39;t/can&#39;t afford them, open the console and type [font=courier]  &#34;help festive&#34;  [/font] to get a list of IDs. You can then use the [font=courier]  &#34;player.additem&#34;  [/font] command to get the items you want.\r<br />\r<br />Due to the way the game works, in order to be able to multicast my custom Magelight spell, I had to edit one value in the code that will also allow the regular Magelight spell to be cast more than once. So, if you have a mod that limits the amount of Magelights, there could be conflicts. Besides this, the mod should be compatible with anything, unless there is a mod out there somewhere that makes massive changes to the Solitude Lighthouse. In that case, there may be issues such as the entry to The Merry Snowberry being nothing but a floating door.\r<br />\r<br />The new consumables are compatible out-of-the-box with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60270/?]RND - Universal Compatibility Patch[/url].
