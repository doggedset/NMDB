She can cook, start a business, follow you in your quests, play flute randomly while traveling and still sing requests in The Winking Skeever of Solitude.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/286/lisetteflute.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nPlugin includes:\r\n- Ancient Draugr Armor for her basic traveling armor.\r\n- Package adjustments to allow her to do her job.\r\n- upgraded weapons and spells.\r\n\r\n[u]Install:[/u]\r\nPlace \\\"Lisette Wife Companion.esp\\\" in your \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\ folder.\r\nRead the uploaded Readme on how to get her, even if you have a current wife.\r\n\r\n[u]Uninstall:[/u]\r\nDelete \\\"Lisette Wife Companion.esp\\\" \r\n\r\n[u]Credits:[/u]\r\nBethesda\r\nme\r\n\r\nAlter the mod as you see fit, but I will be improving it more when CK comes out.\r\n\r\n[u]Bugs:[/u]There is an issue of dialogue, but it is due to improper sequence of steps. \r\nFor dialogue issues I performed two tests. Should I go to Solitude first and make her follower? Or should I go to Riften first to get the Amulet of Mara <I didn\\'t have one at this time>.\r\nTest #1:\r\nI started a test beginning at Helgen, redoing my character. I then set tgm, bought a horse in whiterun (without starting that dragon quest), and rode it directly to Solitude. I arrived in Solitude as usual, just in time for the beheading. Skipping the beheading I went directly into Winking Skeever, used command: setrelationshiprank player 4, and NO DIALOGUE. I figured that I would grab her as follower first then head to Riften together and marry there. This path does not work. You must take the following path Test #2.\r\nTest #2: I reverted to earlier save, used command: player.moveto <a form in Riften>, just to expediate the travel because I was in Solitude. I bought the necklace in the Bee and Barb, then fast traveled to Solitude. Upon entering Winking Skeever, I first put the Amulet of Mara on. Walked close to Lisette, used command: setrelationshiprank player 4, I then initiated talk with her, bang! ALL Dialogue for follower and marriage.\r\nThe important key here is that you need to have the Amulet of Mara to force start the dialogue.\r\n\r\n- Aoikani",
