  "descriptionHtml": "My first ever skyrim mod, so please give feedback so I can make this better! :)\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty simple little mod that just adds a small iron mine next to the house in the Build Your Own Home mod. It was driving me crazy that I couldn\\'t find a descent source of iron besides trekking across tamriel to find the nearest blacksmith, just to run all the way back and do it all over again once I made the next house addition.\r\n\r\nSo, I added a mine! \r\n\r\nIts nothing super fancy, but Its functional. Has several veins of iron ore to mine up(I also suggest perhaps using one of the many mining realism mods to make it all the more useful).\r\n\r\nIt doesn\\'t actually require the house mod to work at all and should work completely on its own. I did as little landscape changing as possible to make it as compatible as possible with any other mods that might change the immediate area.\r\n\r\nHigh recommend using B.Y.O.H. with this mod, as this mod was entirely made to go with it.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18480/]Build Your Own Home[/url]\r\n\r\nAs its my first mod, I wouldn\\'t doubt if there\\'s bugs in it, so please give feedback on any ideas or things I should improve on. I\\'m also looking into perhaps adding it into the BYOH building menu like the house is, but I\\'m not a good script monkey, so we\\'ll see.\r\n\r\n",
