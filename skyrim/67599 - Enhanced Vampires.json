  "descriptionHtml": "In this mod, I changed the way vampires work to better fit how they work in most lore. At night their recovery rate of health, stamina, and magicka, is doubled (or at least should be, needs testing), and durring the day the effectiveness is reduced depending on your Vampirism Stage. Stage 1 shou;d reduce your regen by 20%, stage 2 - 40%, stage 3 - 60%, and stage 4, 80%. So durring the night your regen is a lot faster than that of a humanoid, and durring the day is can be drastically reduced but still some regen to make you not useless durring the day. Please leave any comments if this does not work as intended or with any suggestions to improve this mod.",
