  "descriptionHtml": "Note: I\\'m not creating or updating mods anymore. Because of this, I give anyone permission to continue this project, make variations of it, or include it in their own files. \r\n\r\nReplaces a lot of female body armor with less sexual versions... the male versions. The wrists, necks, and ankles don\\'t line up perfectly with the originals. This shouldn\\'t be too much of a problem if you\\'re wearing a full set of armor though, because most of the gloves/gauntlets are big enough to cover the misalignment.\r\n\r\nReplaced armors:\r\nBlades Armor\r\nDaedric Armor\r\nDragonscale Armor\r\nEbony Armor\r\nEbony Mail\r\nElven Armor (Both types)\r\nGlass Armor\r\nNightingale Armor\r\nOrcish Armor\r\nSteel Plate Armor\r\nWolf Armor\r\n\r\nTo Install put \\\"meshes\\\" into your Skyrim data folder. To remove, delete the meshes added by the mod.",
