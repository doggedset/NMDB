  "summary": "Adds four new arrows with Tamriel-shattering effects. ~Balanaced.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A simple mod that adds four new craftable arrows that are somewhat balanced for the type, they are Godly after all. Cool sounds, effects and explosions. They are NOT 1 shot 1 kill arrows on most guards and above either. Retextured four new arrows and quivers from the steelarrow for a little different look as well. Check out the video for in-game demo.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKwhgd8ks0]Arrows of the Gods Demo[/url]\r\n\r\nCrafting\r\n   Forge >> Misc >> \r\nIt\\'s still a WIP so I would really appreciate any feedback on force, damage, effects, etc to better improve it.\r\n\r\nInstall with NMM or extract files to Skyrims data folder.\r\nEnjoy.",
