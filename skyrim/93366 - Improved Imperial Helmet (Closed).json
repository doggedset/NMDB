I always hated the helm's crest as it looked so cheap. Let's make that crest actually look like a crest that an officer or hero would actually wear. Out of the 7 years, the imperial armors are still forgotten about and this helmet needed it to be fixed. \n<br />\n<br />The helmet should look like what it is based off of at least. Right?\n<br />[img]https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/zdcAAOSwx2dYDyQy/s-l300.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Not much to be said about it. \n<br />\n<br />I know it doesn't look too great but it is better than nothing.
