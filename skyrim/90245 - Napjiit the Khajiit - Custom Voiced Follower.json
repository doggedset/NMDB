  "summary": "Napjiit is a custom voiced Khajiit follower. He has a mellow disposition but will fight bravely to defend his friends!",
  "descriptionHtml": "The Napjiit follower mod adds a custom voiced Khajiit follower to The Bee &amp; Barb Inn in Riften.\n<br />\n<br />Napjiit has all the basic follower commands. He comes with a set of thieves guild armor in his inventory, two leveled healing potions and an iron dagger. He will scale to your level (from 1 to a max of 50). He tends to favor melee combat, can dual wield and has the lightfoot perk - so he shouldn't be setting off any traps!\n<br />\n<br />This is my first mod and I still have much to learn so please use this mod with discretion. I have tested it with companion mods such as AFT and the same compatibility issues that occur for many follower mods also apply here. However, loading the napjiit.esp before AFT will allow you to use AFTs Tweak Make Follower command to port Napjiit into the AFT system. To reiterate - be careful and don't add the mod to any important save games!\n<br />\n<br />This mod was created at the request of subscribers who watched the Napjiit roleplay series. Big thanks to them for their encouragement and support!\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15993]Special Edition Version[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCoLDnpHF_w]Mod introduction video\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]WCoLDnpHF_w[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_zSKm-GuA&amp;list=PLj4LkREAU5l-Dk0cz5BcuaCwi04zBt7n9&amp;index=1&amp;t=0s]Watch the Napjiit series\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]b8_zSKm-GuA[/youtube][/url]",
