  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE: I noticed I was having delays/lags in game while selecting or equiping my weapon! This should now be fixed in v2, so I advice everyone to replace the files with the new version!\r\n\r\nMy second mod release. I\\'ve been working on this one for two days and this is the result of testing and playing around with .nif files while I try to understand the way they work.\r\n\r\nI replaced Nightingale Blade original mesh with Blade\\'s Katana and retextured it to fit the Nightingale looks. \r\n\r\nThe Blade should have it\\'s original damage and enchantment.\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\n- Edit the mesh to change the original looks (need some training with Blender and .nif import/export);\r\n- HD retextures (need more photoshop training);\r\n\r\nHow to Install/Uninstall:\r\n- To install simply copy the \\\"Data\\\" folder into your Skyrim directory;\r\n- To uninstall simply delete the files you copied;\r\n\r\nATTENTION! This mod should NOT replace any Katana textures (Blades Katana, Bolar\\'s Oathblade, Dragonbane)! \r\nIf you notice any changes on other weapons let me know so I can correct them.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!\r\nTiago.\r\n\r\n-> Looking for a match for your new Nightingale Blade? Try my Chillrend - The Frost Katana mod: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3965\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- If you like this retexture please leave a comment and an endorsement!\r\n- If you find any bugs leave a comment and I\\'ll do my best to fix them!\r\n- Thought about a mod you\\'d like to have? Post a comment and I\\'ll be glad to check it and maybe give it a try!\r\n- If you have any tutorials/tips that can help me to start making more advanced mods feel free to PM!\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\n- Learn to edit meshes to change the original looks (need some training with Blender and .nif import/export);\r\n- HD retextures (need more photoshop training);",
