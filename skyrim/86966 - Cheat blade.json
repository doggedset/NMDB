  "descriptionHtml": "Hi, this is a remake of my original mod &#34;Cheat sword&#34; which was bugged so I deleted it.  Anyway, this mod works so I thought I would realise it and see if anyone wanted it.  \r<br />\r<br />It is a glass dagger and you can find it in the Riverwood trader underneath the table at the top floor.  Or you can craft it at a smelter with one ale.  Why?  You may ask, because why not?  It will kill almost everything and maybe even Alduin in one hit and on top of that, absorb their health.",
