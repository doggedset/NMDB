  "descriptionHtml": "Hi all! :)\r\n\r\nToday I talk you about Dragonborn Dragonpriest\\'s masks. \r\nVery powerful artfacts but sometimes useless. They covers character\\'s face, and sometimes are not compatible with the trained kind of armor. \r\nSo, why don\\'t wear a DragonPriest\\'s mask with the right armor model and a better beautiful appearance, like circlet?\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThere are 3 DragoPriest\\'s Masks in Dragonborn expansion, for each one there is this chance:\r\nif you have a dragonpriest\\'s mask on your inventory you can craft at forge 3 versions of the same mask, cloth, light and heavy.\r\n\r\nAll models are in Daedric Crafting List, they look like circlets and you need no perk to craft \\'em. \r\n\r\nThe armor rating is the same of the original models. \r\n\r\nThis mod does not change original models, all craftable models are new.\r\n\r\nAll models can not be unenchanted to learn the enchantments.\r\n\r\nYou can temper all light and heavy models but you need arcane blacksmith perk. If you want a better armor you need Daedric perk too.\r\n\r\nCrafting List: \r\ncloth, light and heavy model need the same ingretients:\r\n\r\n3 Ebony Ingots + 2 Silver Ingots. Tempering: 1 Ebony Ingot\r\n\r\nWARNING:\r\n\r\nThere is a little bug: if you have in your inventory different copies of the same mask and you change repeatedly unequiping and equiping the different models may happens that you character gains a PERMANENT boost to elementals damage!! \r\nI think it may happens because the mask\\'s script has been written to work with only copy of the same enchantment at the time.\r\nIf you wear a copy and before change another one with the same bonuses you unequip the first, it works well.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\r\nSkyrim\r\nDragonborn\r\nUpdate.esm updates at version 1.9\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\noverwrite Data Folder\r\nTurn on \\\"Dragonborn DragonPriests Masks by Cybertron77.esp\\\" in the mod list.\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION:\r\nBefore uninstall, unequip all dragonpriest circlets by your characters and save.\r\n\r\nDelete the file \\\"Dragonborn DragonPriests Masks by Cybertron77.esp\\\" in the Data folder.\r\n\r\nIn this page you can find a similar mod for Skyrim DragonPriest\\'s Mask :)\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/39986/?tab=4&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fcomments%2F%3Fmod_id%3D39986%26page%3D1%26sort%3DDESC%26pid%3D0%26thread_id%3D1070359&pUp=1\r\n\r\nHAVE FUN!!! =D",
