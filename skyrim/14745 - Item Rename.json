  "summary": "Renames lots of items for easier grouping.",
  "descriptionHtml": "It can be quite frustrating when looking through the inventory to locate items of a similar nature.  I\\'ve renamed the ones which I look for most of the time so that they group together nicely by adding a prefix based on their type (e.g. \\\"Arrow: Ebony\\\" or \\\"Jewellery - Necklace: Gold\\\").  The sets I\\'ve renamed are:\r\n- Arrows\r\n- Gems\r\n- Ingots & Ore\r\n- Jewellery\r\n- Soul Gems\r\n\r\nI may do more in the future.  The order I would probably do them in is:\r\n- Food (would be useful if you are running the basic needs mod)\r\n- Armour\r\n- Weapons\r\n- Potions\r\n- Clothes\r\n- Ingredients\r\n- Clutter\r\n\r\nNotes: I use SkyUI, which has sorting functionality.  This mod will probably be pointless unless you use it but I strongly recommend getting it anyway if you haven\\'t already.\r\n\r\nBugs: The thieves guild fishing quests may request items, which are named a bit weird as all it does is give an NPC a gem or such and then add \\\"<NPC Name>\\'s\\\" on the front of the item name. (That\\'s why the quest is buggy and will remove the wrong item from your inventory on completion).  There\\'s nothing I can do about it but it doesn\\'t seem to break anything.",
