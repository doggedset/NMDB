  "descriptionHtml": "*** For now this is just a place holder ***\r\n\r\nThe land of Skyrim is about to be introduced to........ Pokemon. As seen in Fallout 3 and Fallout NV, Pokemon are back and this time better than ever.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are familiar with my Pokemon mods for Fallout, I\\'m back and this time I\\'m stepping my game up. Instead of simple retextures of ingame monsters, I am going with new meshes of the actual Pokemon. Actual Pokemon to follow you and fight your battles as well as some roaming around the world.\r\n\r\nAt the movement this is a work in progress so this page is merely a placeholder. I will continue to update and hope to have a alpha/beta file available as soon as possible. The creation kit is out and I will get hard at work on this.\r\n",
