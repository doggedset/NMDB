Enjoy!\r\n\r\n[b]Q & A[/b]\r\n\r\n1) [b]Why multi-powered Items?[/b]\r\nBecause switching between rings & necklaces during combat is quite annoying, don\\'t you think? Same in towns. Plus, they\\'re like a magic set that fits a certain type of player. Don\\'t you have enough carrying tons of trinkets or spending your days at the enchanting table?\r\n\r\n2) [b]Why using vanilla models?[/b]\r\nBecause these ones look awesome, but they\\'re used by weak or useless (or disgusting) artifacts. Who wants to be a cannibal, seriously. Also, the religious trinkets deserved a buff. It\\'s like you\\'ve been chosen by the Divinity! Now, I\\'d like to customize the Iron Banded Shield I used with some colored gems... Anybody?\r\n\r\n3) [b]Isn\\'t that quite overpowered?[/b]\r\nIMHO No, because they cost a LOT of Septims, preventing low level characters to acquire them + they require precious or rare materials to be forged and/or tempered. Ex: you may have to hunt some Ice Wraiths to buff your stuff...\r\nAlso, the level of enchantment is not the max you can get ingame, and all Items are unique.\r\n\r\n4) [b]Why are your pics in French?[/b]\r\nBecause my game is in French but don\\'t worry the main file is 100% in English. I\\'ve put the French version in the Optional section.\r\n\r\n4) Let me know in comments!",
