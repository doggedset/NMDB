  "descriptionHtml": "I made this mod because I started using the crossbow and I was disappointed by the quiver strolling through my back and its distance from the body when crouched.\r\n\r\nI tried several methods to fix the bug but I had various glitches that I could not bring myself.\r\n\r\nFinally I find a sort of solution when i see the mod: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5711/?tab=2&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D5711&pUp=1]Closer Bolts - Closer and Hidden Crossbow Bolts[/url] from [b]EvilDeadAsh34[/b]. \r\n\r\nSo I edited the skeleton.nif to create a new node for a special garment called \"Bolt Quiver\" in game and open the steelbolt.nif and dwarvenbolt.nif to remove the quiver and rework the arrow.\r\n\r\nThis mod hide the \"real\" bolt quiver and add a special garment that you can make at the forge in the misc section.\r\n\r\nNow the quiver is closer to your body and don't go far away when you crouch.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nRequires Dawnguard\r\nAs usual, copy the content in your Data folder.\r\n\r\nIncompatibilty:\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this mod is incompatible with custom skeleton but this can be easily fixed with nifskope.\r\n\r\n",
