  "descriptionHtml": "IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS MOD PLEASE FOLLOW THE UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS AT THE BOTTOM.\r\n\r\nI loved the new perk trees in Dawnguard but I felt they lacked a little something for your supernatural self while not in full-on monster mode. Vampires throughout fiction and mythology gain more proficiency with their supernatural powers as they gain age and experience even if their full wrath isn\\'t on display.\r\nMuch like my werewolf mod, The Beast Within, this mod unlocks minor passive bonuses for your non-transformed state as you master your vampire powers.\r\nThe additions are as follows:\r\n\r\nPower of the Grave: +10 to health, stamina, and magicka\r\nPoison Talons: +15 to unarmed damage, +4% weapon damage\r\nSupernatural Reflexes: +4% weapon damage\r\nUnearthly Will: spells cost 5% less\r\nMist Form: +5% to health, stamina, and magicka regeneration\r\n\r\nMuch like The Beast Within, all of the powers are were designed to be balanced and are attached to a single ability for maximum compatibility with other mods. It shows up in your active effects after your first perk purchase. The addition of the ability depends on a small script added to the transformation trigger abilities, Vampire Lord and Revert Form. For the most part, this should maintain compatibility with other vampire mods. You can even use another mod that mods the Vampire Lord perks and as long as their references haven\\'t been changed this mod will still work (although the descriptions may not show up).\r\n\r\nNEW IN VERSION 1.2\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nI removed all the abilities from the default vampirism immunity and added them to their own ability that is visible in your active effects after your first Vampire Lord transformation. This will make it easier to upgrade or uninstall in the future but as a consequence is slightly less compatible with other vampire mods. Most will work unless they modify the transformation trigger abilities.\r\n\r\nUPGRADING FROM OLD VERSION 1.0 or 1.1 -- ONLY IF YOU WERE ALREADY A VAMPIRE\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe older version 1.1 of this mod worked best if you were not already a vampire before installing. Because of the way it edited existing effects the uninstallation is a little complicated. Starting with version 1.2 this will no longer be necessary going forward.\r\nBefore uninstalling 1.1 or 1.0, either:\r\n- Cure your vampirism with Falion or by becoming a werewolf\r\nOR\r\n- Use the console to remove your vampire immunity with \\\"player.removespell ED0A8\\\" and make a clean save. Once you load the new version add back your vampire immunity by using the console to \\\"player.addspell ED0A8\\\" and proceed as normal. Occasionally the game won\\'t let you add the ability back and you may be stuck using the cure method instead.\r\nIf you need to reinstall 1.1 or 1.0 in order to do this it is available under Old Versions at the Nexus page http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22313\r\n\r\nTO UNINSTALL CURRENT VERSION 1.2\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\nAll you have to do to uninstall and not get stuck with your buffed human form abilities is save in Vampire Lord form. There is a script that automatically removes your human form abilities and adds them back when you change back using Revert Form so saving in Vampire Lord form should produce a clean save for either uninstalling or any future upgrades in abilities.\r\n\r\nCheck out The Beast Within at http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22165 for the werewolf equivalent to this mod. You can run both simultaneously with no issues!\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n-------------\r\nv1.2a -- Removed a redundant resist disease accidentally left in the added ability.\r\nv1.2 -- Removed all the abilities from the default vampirism immunity and added them to their own ability which is scripted to add / remove on form change.\r\nv1.1 -- Some users were reporting issues with the attack speed buff of Supernatural Reflexes so I changed it to weapon damage buff for the time being.\r\nv1.0 -- Release",
