  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/description.jpg[/img]\r<br />Say hello to Supergirl. This is an outfit a long time in the making. I&#39;ve been working to get it right since I first learned to mod Skyrim. As the cape and neckline have been fixed, the latest 2.0 version is the final version.\r<br />\r<br />You also get real super powers if you use the optional ESP. Just put the outfit on and start fighting. You&#39;ll see what I mean. This gal gives new meaning to the words &#34;knuckle sandwich&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/location.jpg[/img]\r<br />You can find the outfit in two places in Skyrim. The first location is a display case in Dragon&#39;s Reach, near the Jarl&#39;s Quarters. The other place is somewhere on the Icerunner, a ship that nearly foundered after some genius put out the lighthouse fire.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/installation.jpg[/img]\r<br />Unrar the archive and place in &#34;Data&#34; folder. If you have any conflicts or issues with any aspect of your game upon installing this mod, please uninstall using the same method, but backwards.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/credits.jpg[/img]\r<br />I&#39;d like to thank Bethesda for the cape.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/permissions.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />You may not upload, alter or distribute any parts of this Skyrim mod without my expressed permission.
