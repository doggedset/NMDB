So aside from sushi... And upgrades & bugfixes large concern will be about creating a larger parkland exterior.\r<br />[/size][/color][/size][/color][b][color=#ff0000][size=4]\r<br />Updates:\r<br />[/size][/color][/b]NEW UPDATE IS OUT GUYS&#33; Verion 1.1 features:\r<br />- Fixed collision issue for the preserved elder lady corridor. \r<br />- Fixed no footstep sounds problem.\r<br />- Added Post Processing & lightning effects to all the rooms of the house.\r<br />- Added 2 new music tracks from Dove218 into the mod, increasing the total music time to 22minutes.\r<br />- Added a decent urban vista to the causal chambers.\r<br />- Added 4 new artworks of mine as portraits in the lobby and casual chambers.\r<br />- Added Jackson the blood Selling Vampire NPC in the casual chambers.\r<br />- Added New modern male outfit from Andrew Clements and Nancy Krantz.\r<br />- Blood Chalice in the bedroom has a script effect applied to it. Now it hurts you for 100 health and grants you a grand soulgem.[b][color=#ff0000][size=4][size=2]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />Description:[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />I was making my Vampire Guild mod and when I started working on the modern environments I liked the modern guild house so much I decided to simply cut it off and make it a standalone Housing mod. The House is comprised of 5 rooms The Main lobby connects to the Bedroom, the Labs (where crafting furniture is located), the Teleportation room (gateway between the World and Cyrodil) and the Casual room. The mod contains paintings I made from my own artworks.\r<br />\r<br />How to get to the house? There&#39;s a new cave on the road off Solitude &#34;Bloodrevan&#39;s Cave&#34;, seek it out and find the portal off Cyrodil :D (Consult the last screenshot to get the detailed location).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4][b]Credits:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />- Linn - Linn&#39;s room resources\r<br />- Mgbeach - rug texture\r<br />- Blary and Stoverjm - Open books resources\r<br />- Evenstar01 - Night Mother re-model\r<br />- Andrew Clements and Nancy Krantz - Modern Male outfit\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][b][size=4]Music:[/size][/b][/color]\r<br />- Death & The Aftermath pt 2 by Dove218\r<br />- Avril Lavigne Let Me Go by Dove218\r<br />- To Begin a New - Dove218\r<br />- The Walk to Alexandoria - Dove218\r<br />[b][size=4]\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Permissions:[/color][/size][/b]\r<br />For the sake of safety, please ask me what you want to use and for what.
