I could use some help so if you have any experience making quests and are willing to help please pm me :)\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/images/1232514-1327444058.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][u][b]Glamdring[/b][/u][/center]\r\nby: Isilmeriel\r\n------------\r\nVersion: 1.01\r\nJan 23, 2012\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis addon introduces the sword Glamdring from Lord of the Rings, wielded by Gandalf. A weathered version of the sword can either be crafted under the steel section or purchased from Eorlund at the skyforge in Whiterun. The sword can be improved at the grinding wheel or visually upgraded (with minor stat increase, but discards any previous improvements) at the forge. I recommend the regular version but it can be further upgraded to a chrome/polished version at the forge if you like shinier weapons.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me for explicit permission before uploading or using any of my mod resources for your own work and credit authorship accordingly.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n---------------------\r\n- 3 versions, can be upgraded at the forge in order (ancient -> regular -> polished)\r\n- Scabbard\r\n- Realistic metal material with reflection\r\n- Upgradable at the grind wheels\r\n- High resolution, hand-painted textures\r\n- Unenchanted for freedom of customization\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n---------------------\r\n- unRAR the content in skyrim\\\\data\\\\, activate isilGlamdring.esp as with any other skyrim mod.\r\n- find the sword at Eorland in Whiterun or craft at the forge (under the steel category)\r\n\r\n[center]* * *[/center]\r\n\r\nPlease pm me if you find any other issues or have suggestions, I\\'ll get to them as soon as I can.\r\n\r\n[CENTER][IMG]http://i522.photobucket.com/albums/w347/bethdeacon/th_TESV2012-01-2100-04-40-57.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i522.photobucket.com/albums/w347/bethdeacon/th_TESV2012-01-2100-15-46-23.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i522.photobucket.com/albums/w347/bethdeacon/th_TESV2012-01-2100-13-45-06.jpg[/IMG][/CENTER]\r\n\r\n[center][u]My other Skyrim addons:[/u][/center]\r\n\r\n- Anduril & Narsil (http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5727)",
