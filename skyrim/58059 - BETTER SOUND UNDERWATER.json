  "descriptionHtml": "Hello&#33; I have made a mod what changes the vanilla sound of underwater\r<br />\r<br />.You can choose between two versions, Ultra and Short versions, the first is 6M and the second one 15M, the only difference is the large of the file duration\r<br />.You could feel like in a deep dark underwater environment, isolated from ground\r<br />\r<br />Install with NMM or put the files on the Skyrim/Data/sound/fx/amb folder\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I have notice and I think you too, the sound keep playing after you get out of the water because an engine thing of the skyrim game, so the game is made to only hear like 3 or 4 seconds of sound, because If the file of sound is large than 4 seconds you will hear the sound after you get out of the water and that should be not immersive or realist, but by other way If you enjoy playing like an Argonian and dive or snorkeling and want a true experience of feel underwater and you pass along time underwater you should install the  Ultra version, but keep in mind that after you get out of the water and the file of sound hasnt stop playing, you should have hear the sound when you are landing until the file sound get off, xP, sound sound (I have spell sound a lot of times xP)\r<br />\r<br />So that&#39;s all, the Underwaterfix version have the same folders than the other files so install just like the others\r<br />\r<br />Use NMM for installation or Put the sound file on your Skyrim Data/sound/fx/amb and enjoy forever\r<br />\r<br />An last a suggestion If you want something new and want to have a real Underwater immersivity you should try this awesome mod what makes Whiterun Underwater by Rakani1112 http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29162\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />You can hear the new video (in videos section the last one) about the new version of BETTER SOUND UNDERWATER and download the file too, names UnderWater nice, this fix the odd sounds and have more quality than Underwater fix version\r<br />\r<br />Have fun&#33;&#33; :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Maredark3d",
