  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/6648/screenshot872y.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />After the creation of Alma (by me) and Megan Fox (by Xannon98), I decided to create a storm mage to complete our set of custom casters. Then I remembered Ororo Munroe from X-Men, and thought how cool it would be to create a follower inspired on her. Thus Storm is now in Skyrim, a Destruction Mage who relies on the lightning school and occasionally uses a very fitting Shout to her. I put her a pair of swords in her inventory, which she uses when her enemy resists her storm spells. I included as well a bow and a set of arrows, but I have yet to see if she uses them.\r<br />\r<br />As I said, Storm is inspired on Ororo Munroe from X-Men. Inspired, not based on, so I really don&#39;t care about comments stating that she is so not Halle Berry lookalike, that her nose does not resemble Storm&#39;s nose, that her hair is totally wrong and so on. I actually like how she is now, so she will probably remain like this.\r<br />\r<br />Where to find her:\r<br />At Winterhold&#39;s College. She spends her mornings at the Hall of the Elements, her afternoons outside at the terrace gazing at the weather (go all the way upstairs from Hall of Attainment/Countenance and you&#39;ll find her outside) and her evenings in the Hall of Countenance, where the other College instructors hang around. She takes her meals and sleeps there as well.\r<br />\r<br />I had a couple of issues developing her, so please report if you find any issues.\r<br />\r<br />Storm is completely standalone, so you will not need any additional mods for her to work on your game. Although her [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii SkyHair[/url] style is included already she may, however, not look exactly like the Storm in these screenshots, so I&#39;ll share with you the mods I am using in case you want to try them out:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14569]Univision Face[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7887]Pretty Face[/url] (overwriting Univision files)\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]Dimonized UNP[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Armor displayed on screenshots: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20077]Tribunal Robes[/url], she looks so much more in character with these. I recommend using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13571]Dual Wield for Followers[/url] as well.\r<br />\r<br />....................................................................................................................................\r<br />\r<br />Credits and Special Thanks to:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii SkyHair[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3552857]Xannon98[/url] for his full support and help, screenshots and beta testing.\r<br />\r<br />....................................................................................................................................\r<br />\r<br />Change log:\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1\r<br />Storm is now standalone. The Apachii hairstyle she uses is included in the mod.\r<br />Install procedure: Remove any items you gave her from her inventory, dismiss, uninstall old version, install new.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0\r<br />Initial release.\r<br />\r<br />....................................................................................................................................\r<br />\r<br />Legal/Permission: Contact-me by PM if you wish to include my mods into your own work.
