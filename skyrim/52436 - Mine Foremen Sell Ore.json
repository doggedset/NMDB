  "modName": "Mine Foremen Sell Ore",
  "summary": "A small mod that lets NPC&#39;s who own or run mines sell the appropriate ore.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=3]Description[/size][/b]\r<br />The Dragonborn is a legendary Smith twice over. She has hundreds of thousands of septims cluttering up her manor. The reason she doesn&#39;t have a second manor? A shortage of nails, iron fittings and locks. Could she craft more? Sure... if she could find some more ore.\r<br />\r<br />I have plenty of mods that add more crafting materials to vendor lists, but still the shortage is enough to irritate me - especially if I don&#39;t want to fast travel all over the map every two days hoarding ore like some kind of frenzied packrat. I don&#39;t like the idea of simply getting more &#39;free&#39; ore from mining. Besides, the Dragonborn is rolling in cash, she should be slaying mighty beasts, not grubbing in a cave for ore.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Details[/b][/size]\r<br />[b]Requirements: - [/b]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19/?]The Unofficial Skyrim Patch[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Conflicts: -[/b]\r<br />Mods that alter the NPC&#39;s edited by this mod. If you need a patch, please request one.\r<br />([url=http://kidhedera.tumblr.com/post/78908928419/making-a-patch-for-uskp-and-your-favourite-npc-mods]Or make your own patch using these instructions[/url])\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]What exactly to the NPC&#39;s sell?[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />- A random amount of the ore available from their mine. Its available in large quantities, you should find anywhere from 50 to 150 chunks of ore. Iron mines also have a low chance to sell a small amount of charcoal.\r<br />\r<br />- A random amount of ingots made from the local ore - significantly less than the amount of ore. Iron mines also have a random chance to sell a small number of steel ingots. (Don&#39;t count on it being available, but you might see the odd bar here and there)\r<br />\r<br />- A very low chance of gems associated with their ore.\r<br />Gem/ore associations are the same as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49791/?]Complete Crafting Overhaul[/url] and are as follows:\r<br />   Iron = Amethysts, Sapphires\r<br />   Corundum = Garnets, Rubies\r<br />   Silver = Rubies, Sapphires, Emeralds\r<br />   Orchialum = Garnets, Amethysts, Rubies, Sapphires\r<br />   Gold = Garnets, Amethysts, Emeralds\r<br />   Quicksilver = Rubies, Emeralds\r<br />   Moonstone = Garnets, Emeralds\r<br />   Malachite = Amethysts, Diamonds\r<br />   Ebony = Amethysts, Diamonds\r<br />\r<br />- An extremely low chance of selling a random assortment of spare tools such as pickaxes, torches, lanterns, axes, firewood, charcoal, leather strips and linen.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=3]How much Gold do the vendors have?[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />The Vendors use the &#39;street vendor&#39; levelled list and so will have 50 gold if you use vanilla merchant gold, and whatever your mods determine if you have altered merchant gold with a mod.\r<br />I know this is a very low amount of gold and not very useful if you want to offload your Fiery Sword of Enchanted Uselessness on the nearest NPC, but these are not wealthy people and they are more interested in making money off you than the other way around.\r<br />\r<br />Will NPC&#39;s sell ore even if their mine is infested with Draugr/Mercenaries/Spiders?\r<br />No.\r<br />Or at least, they shouldn&#39;t. If they do please leave a comment and let me know which NPC is misbehaving and which quest you think should have to be finished before you can buy from them.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]So who sells what?[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Grogmar - Shors Stone[/i]\r<br />Sells Iron\r<br />Requirements: Kill the spiders dead.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Gestur Rock-Breaker - Stonehills[/i]\r<br />Sells Iron\r<br />Requirements: Take a message to Thane Bryling\r<br />\r<br />[i]Skaggi Scar-Face - Markarth[/i]\r<br />Sells Iron\r<br />Requirements: None\r<br />\r<br />[i]Beitild - Dawnstar[/i]\r<br />Sells Iron\r<br />Requirement: None\r<br />\r<br />[i]Liegelf - Dawnstar[/i]\r<br />Sells Quicksilver\r<br />Requirements: None\r<br />\r<br />[i]Kjeld - Kynesgrove[/i]\r<br />Sells Malachite\r<br />Requirements: None\r<br />\r<br />[i]Ainethach - Karthwasten[/i]\r<br />Sells Silver\r<br />Requirement: Evict the silverblood mercenaries\r<br />\r<br />[i]Pavo - Kolskeggr Mine[/i]\r<br />Sells Gold\r<br />Requirements: Reclaim the mine from the Forsworn\r<br />\r<br />[i]Perth - Soljund&#39;s Sinkhole[/i]\r<br />Sells Moonstone\r<br />Requirements: Kill the Draugr\r<br />\r<br />[i]Verner - Darkwater Crossing[/i]\r<br />Sells Corundum\r<br />Requirements: None\r<br />\r<br />[b]In addition the following NPC&#39;s were already merchants, but you should now find them to have more ore available:\r<br />[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Filnjar, Blacksmith - Shor&#39;s Stone[/i]\r<br />- More iron\r<br />\r<br />[i]Gharol, Blacksmith - Dushnikh Yal[/i]\r<br />- More Orichalcum\r<br />\r<br />[i]Shuftharz, Blacksmith - Mor Khazgur[/i]\r<br />- More Orichalcum\r<br />\r<br />[i]Dushnamub, Blacksmith - Gloombound Mine\r<br />[/i]\r<br />- More Ebony\r<br />\r<br />[b][i]What about Thorgar from Whistling Mine?\r<br />[/i][/b]\r<br />- Thorgar is deluded about his prospects, the mine is almost dry. He&#39;s going bust, so the poor bloke doesn&#39;t have any ore to sell you.\r<br />\r<br />[b][i]What about Thane Bryling? She technically owns...\r<br />[/i][/b]\r<br />- Nope. She&#39;s a wealthy woman. She&#39;s not gonna carry around a bunch of ore in her back pocket\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Final notes:[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=2]Anyway, I hope you find this useful. Its been hand polished and checked with TES5 Edit and definitely only edits those items which are required for the mod to function.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />If you are curious about the levelled lists I used everything I added to the game has the prefix &#39;KID_&#39;, so you can load it up in Creation Kit to look at it in more detail. New items from mods will not appear in the Mine foremen&#39;s merchant inventories because they use a custom levelled list I created from scratch. A bashed patch will ensure that my levelled list and lists added by other mods are both used for the blacksmith inventories I edited.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=2]Other Mods by me:[/size][/b]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51566/?]Servants in Livery: Stewards Uniforms\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52878/?]Cultural Armors - The Khajiit[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51886/?]USKP Patch for TK Children[/url]\r<br />[url= http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51860/?]Freckle Face for TK Children[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52671/?]Detailed TreeLOD for Realistic Aspens\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58622/?]Hi Res East Empire Trading Company Sign[/url]",
