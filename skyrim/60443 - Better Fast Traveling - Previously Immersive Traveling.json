They disable it completely and to get back fast travel you have to uninstall the mod itself for the fast travel system to come back. So I made my own version where you can choose to enable or disable Fast Travel Via MCM Menu resulting in never leaving the game to enable/disable fast Travel. this mod also includes a setting for timescale.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]The timescale Setting can be changed from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 1440 (24 Hours)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]Be aware that it takes a couple seconds (Real time) for the Enable/Disable fast travel function to work. It wont immediately be activated after you Enable/Disable the fast travel setting (because the game takes a couple seconds to enable or disable fast travel) but once its done its done.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[size=4]When you install the mod a notification (left corner text) pops up telling you &#34;Timescale: &lt;currentTimescale&gt;&#34; when you see that the mod has been installed[/size]\r<br />[size=4][color=gold]Remember to endorse if you like the mod[/color]\r<br />[color=red]DO NOT Redistribute without my permission[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[[size=4]Q & A]\r<br />Q: What&#39;s Timescale? \r<br />A: Its the setting that lets time pass in game. The default value is 20 so for example 1 minute in real life is 20 minutes in game. Be very careful changing this value. the whole game is tailored around the value of 20. As [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/6133101]livnthedream[/url] has said in the comments you should not set this value below 6 or you will have problems.[/size][size=4]\r<br />[Requirements][/size]\r<br />[size=4]   -SKSE 1.7.1 [/size][url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]Download Here[/url]\r<br />[size=4]   -SkyUI 4.1 [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/?] Download here\r<br />[/url]\r<br />[size=4]   If you dont like the skyUI but like the MCM Functionallity then download this mod [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29440/?]Here \r<br />[/url]\r<br />[size=4]   [Installation][/size]\r<br />[size=4]      -Use Nexus Mod Manager[/size]\r<br />[size=4]      -By Default fast travel is still Enabled so you are going to have  to go to the MCM and change it (if you desire)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]   [Uninstallation][/size]\r<br />[size=4]      [/size][color=yellow]*IMPORTANT*[/color][size=4] Before you uninstall the mod through Nexus mod manager make sure you Re-Enable Fast Travel in the MCM Menu (If you don&#39;t things may mess up and permanently disable fast travel for that save (I don&#39;t really know what it will do if you don&#39;t but its a precaution to re-enable fast travel in the MCM Menu before you uninstall through NMM))[/size]",
