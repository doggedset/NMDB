The Armoury is a shop selling my unique items. It also contains crafting tools, storage and “houses”.\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]\r\n-----How to get the items?----- -----[/color]\r\nBuy:  \r\nGo to the armoury and buy them. Items are sold at different levels, so you cannot buy high level weapons too early. This is why some merchants might have empty lists. They won’t sell at mid night even if they stand there.\r\nForge:  \r\nWeapons can be forged (and sharpened), if you have the skills. All the crafting tools are available at the armoury.\r\nFind:  \r\nWeapons can be found randomly all around and on bandits (leveled).\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]\r\n-----Keys----------[/color]\r\nThe Merchant selling the Fine items also sells Keys -or at least casts for the keys because people in Skyrim don\\'t know how to sell keys. When you buy the cast for a key, you will need in addition an iron/steel/silver ingot to craft it at the forge/anvil.\r\nThese keys will unlock different parts of the armoury:\r\n\r\n-Key to Forge Chests:  \r\nUnlocks two chests at the forge area, which could be used to store ore, ingots, leather etc.\r\n-Key to Storage Tower:  \r\nThis is a beginner level storage area containing 6 containers, 1 mannequin, 7 weapon racks, 5 weapon plaques and 5 shield plaques. It is located near the entrance for quick access. \r\n-Key to Arcane Chamber:  \r\nA Mage themed apartment with alchemy & enchantment tools, 2 mannequins, weaponracks, display cases, containers and respawning ingredients.\r\n-Key to Archery Range :  \r\nA rogue/ranger themed apartment with an archery range, containers, mannequins, weapon racks, display cases …  a secret alchemy lab for assassins and a hidden treasury/armoury for thieves.\r\n\r\nBuy all keys to have one big apartment complex!\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]\r\n-----Collector\\'s Edition Stuff---------- [/color]\r\nAndragorn\\'s Armoury Unlimited Collectors Edition eBook (pdf) contains sketches, drawings and digital paintings is available as well as Andragorn\\'s Armoury Wallpaper pack 1080p.\r\nBoth of which can be downloaded (free) from the links at the right side of 4sk0.Deviantart.com \r\n\r\n[color=cyan]\r\n-----Items in the Mod-----------[/color]\r\n\r\nCurrent Item Setts (and a comparable material):\r\n\r\n-Fine weapons (daedric)\r\n-Lohkrmil (ebony)\r\n-Araentaliorn Barony (Glass)\r\n-Sylarntorian (elven)\r\n-Araentaliorn (Dwemer)\r\n-Irdewirium (orcish)\r\n-Flimsy weapons (iron-steel)\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]\r\n----- Installation----- [/color]\r\n\r\nInstallation: Stuff go under the data-folder.\r\nUninstallation: Stuff go away from the data-folder.\r\n\r\nOr just let the mod managers do the job for you.\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]\r\n------ Other notes----- [/color]\r\n\r\nI do not take requests, orders or demands.
