  "descriptionHtml": "Did you notice that when Mjoll the Lioness uses her sword Grimsever, it\\'s not as good as it could be? Well, that\\'s because her One-Handed skill sucks. However, fear no more, as with this mod, everything is as should be! This mod makes the sword Grimsever a two-handed Glass sword instead of one-handed, meaning that Mjoll\\'s better combat skill is used when wielding it. The enchantment, as it should, is preserved.\r\n(I couldn\\'t find other mods that do this)\r\nBefore installing, make sure that no character has Grimsever equipped, [i]including you[/i]! I haven\\'t tested it yet, but it MIGHT cause glitches.\r\n(This is my first mod and therefore it\\'s very simple)",
