  "descriptionHtml": "So you&#39;ve spent hours honing your smithing skills and just created your first set of Dragon Armor. Now you just need a Daedric longsword and you&#39;ll be good to go. What&#39;s this? Despite your mastery of smithing you can&#39;t make Daedric swords because you chose the left side of the smithing tree? Boo&#33; This mod fixes that problem by giving you all the perks for a skill when you unlock the level 100 perk for that skill. This fixes many issues with the skill trees and leveling in Skyrim. Its unrealistic to say that someone who has mastered a skill can&#39;t use all the abilities associated with it. There&#39;s 251 perks, and only 81 levels. Without this mod, if you wanted to fill a skill tree you had to reset that skill and go through the tedious task of resetting and raising it to 100 again. No more&#33; Skill Master makes you the true master of your profession. You no longer have to chose between two sides of a skill tree. Skill Master makes it rewarding to master a skill. \r<br />\r<br />What this mod does: \r<br />Upon unlocking the level 100 perk, all other perks for that skill are unlocked \r<br />(Note: In the case of Alteration and Conjuration, which have 2 perks at 100, this is triggered by the &#34;Master (insert magic school here)&#34; perk.) \r<br />\r<br />Compatibility: \r<br />This mod is not compatible with any mods that remove or add perks to the skill trees. \r<br />\r<br />F.A.Q. \r<br />Q: Can I use this mod with an existing save? \r<br />A: Yes&#33; If you already have a save with a level 100 perk, Skill Master will unlock the rest of that tree. \r<br />\r<br />Q: The mod didn&#39;t work&#33; I unlocked the level 100 perk and didn&#39;t get the rest of the perks in the tree&#33;\r<br />A: Please leave a comment with your load order and what you were doing\r<br />\r<br />Q: I tried to refund my points using the black book Waking Dreams but it doesn&#39;t work\r<br />A: Deactivate the mod, refund your points and reactivate it.",
