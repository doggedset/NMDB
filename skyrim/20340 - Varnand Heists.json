  "descriptionHtml": "What if there was a darker side to the Thieves Guild? Usually people like Brynjolf just go and intimidate those that owe the Guild money, but what happens to the ones who try to rip the Guild off and can\\'t pay them back? In this questline, you\\'ll meet a man named Varnand who will show you just how dirty some people have to get their hands to keep the Guild running smoothly.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n-Complete new series of quests (In production)\r\n-Brand new NPCs\r\n-Complete with Voice Acting (Currently looking for Voice Actors)\r\n-Unique Items with custom textures\r\n-Skill-based speech challenges\r\n-Ability to choose your path and how to handle certain jobs you are given. But watch out, a bad decision in an early quest may have bad consequences in a later quest (or vice versa).\r\n",
