  "summary": "Unbound Breath for one minute of unlimited stamina.",
  "descriptionHtml": "30 unique (they shouldn\\'t respawn) bottles of Unbound Breath have been placed in various locations all over Skyrim. One bottle will grant you unlimited stamina for one minute in which time you can shield bash a forsworn to death or whatever.\r\n\r\nMost can be found in dungeons and others can be bought/stolen. I didn\\'t place any in the Tamriel world space because I was afraid they might vanish with an attack or fall through the ground.\r\n\r\nStandard potion bottle that\\'s been modified to glow a bright green, this also makes some of them easier to find. Sort of. Not that they\\'re really well hidden.\r\n\r\nInstallation is easy. Just drop the .esp and two folders into you Data folder and activate it with the mod manager. Load order shouldn\\'t bee much of a hassle, somewhere in the middle maybe?\r\n\r\nIf you like it, and I hope you do like my special, once (30) in a lifetime little item, let me know and I might make some more small mods like this. No clue as to what though.",
