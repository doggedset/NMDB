She is a Nord and I\\'ve given her the Combat Warrior 2H class.  She will level with the player and even comes with some of her own gear.\r\n\r\n========\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\n\r\nFind Niia in The Bannered Mare in Whiterun. \r\n\r\n============\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n\r\nApachii Sky Hair (Must)\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\n\r\nApachii Sky Hair Retexture (Nord Style Option, This is optional)\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10357\r\n\r\n=================\r\nInstall/Uninstall\r\n=================\r\n\r\n*SEE UPDATE INFO BELOW BEFORE UPDATING*\r\n\r\nCopy the contents of this mod\\'s data folder to your Skyrim/Data folder.  Activate \\\"CM - Niia v1-1.esp\\\" file.  Load your game.\r\n\r\n===========\r\nUpdate Info\r\n===========\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT* \r\n\r\nBefore Updating to Version 1.1 from 1.0, load up your game, take back any items you\\'ve given Niia that you wish to keep.  Then dismiss her by clicking on \\\"It\\'s time for us to part ways\\\" and then save your game and exit.  Remove all three files  from Version 1.0 from you Skyrim/Data folder (CM - Niia.esp, CM - Niia.bsl, and CM - Niia.bsa).  Then copy over the new files, activate the esp file and load your game.\r\n\r\n=======\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n\r\n4/25/2012: Version 1.1\r\n\r\n- No Longer Requires Lore Friendly Armor Pack\r\n\r\n- Sets Niia\\'s Default Armor to Vanilla Hide Armor, which fixes the issue with the missing body that could occur when a user ran this mod without having the previously required Lore Friendly Armor Pack installed.\r\n\r\n- Also, since LFAP was such a powerful armor set, I think that it prevented some users from being able to equip other armors because, I made LFAP Niia\\'s default and the game automatically uses the best armor a follower NPC has.\r\n\r\n\r\n4/21/2012: Version 1.0\r\n\r\n- Initial Release\r\n\r\n====\r\nBugs\r\n====\r\n\r\nNone known\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nSPACEWALK",
