  "descriptionHtml": "Berserker Wolf Helmet Mod - Ver. 1.0 by Eferas\r<br />\r<br />First of all, I&#39;m not the author of any of these meshes and textures. The original author and owner is Duster451, who kindly agreed to share this work with the comunity.\r<br />\r<br />You can find his Blog at this link --&gt; http://1khz.me.uk/Blog/\r<br />\r<br />Now, what this mod does is adding a new helmet to the game, inspired by the Dark Fantasy Manga &#34;Berserk&#34; by Kentaro Miura.\r<br />\r<br />You can forge it under the dwarven category (no perks required) with 2 dwarven ingots and 1 ebony ingot, then update it with 1 ebony ingot. It has daedric helmet stats, since it&#39;s a demoniac armor created by dwarfs.\r<br />\r<br />Problems with this mod: the helmet clips a little with the character&#39;s head, I can&#39;t fix it because I&#39;m not a 3D modeler, sorry. But there aren&#39;t any problems if you use the custom race mod by Bagserk, that add all Berserk races to the game.\r<br />\r<br />You can find his mod here --&gt; http://bagserk.blogspot.it/2012/09/berserk-races-for-skyrim-with-face.html\r<br />\r<br />How to install:\r<br />Copy everything and past in your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />How to unistall:\r<br />Delete esp and files.\r<br />\r<br />Permits: you MUST ask me or Duster451 before doing anything.\r<br />\r<br />Credits: all credits go to Duster451, thanks a lot&#33; http://1khz.me.uk/Blog/",
