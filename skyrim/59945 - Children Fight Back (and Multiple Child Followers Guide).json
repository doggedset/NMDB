  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=#FF8100]WHAT THIS MOD DOES[/color][/heading]\r<br />This mod simply adds a dialogue option to any children you have recruited as a follower, that allows you to tell them to either fight alongside you or run at the first sign of trouble. This allows you to recruit as many kids as you like using your favorite follower manager (see the guide below) and choose whether each one will run at the first sign of trouble or fight alongside you. You can even set each child to react differently&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF8100]How is this different from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23030/?]Make Any Child Your Follower[/url]?[/color]\r<br />MACYF does allow you to recruit a child as a follower and tell them to &#34;be brave&#34; so that they&#39;ll fight alongside you. Unfortunately, as it also tries to provide a follower framework that sits outside of the vanilla follower faction, it is limited to only being able to recruit a single child and set them to fight.\r<br />\r<br />What I have sought to do with this mod is leave the recruitment to be done by your follower manager of choice (AFT, UFO, EFF, etc.) as they do it far better, and simply provide a method to manage the disposition of children followers in a way that can be applied to as many as you recruit&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]The outcome is that you can recruit as many kids as you like, and have them all fight alongside you&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit and contains two very minor scripts, neither of which run constantly. The source of both scripts have been included in the download for anyone that wants to check them, expand on, or learn from this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=#FF8100]REQUIREMENTS[/color][/heading]\r<br />The main file is a single .esp file with associated scripts and requires Skyrim.esm and Hearthfires.esm.\r<br />\r<br />In order for child followers to be set for fighting, you must be using a child overhaul that removes the &#34;Child&#34; flag from kid NPCs. My favorite, and the one I would strongly recommend, is the Playable version of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55555/?]RS Children Overhaul[/url]. Only the Playable version makes the required changes, and is identical to the Non-Playable version - you don&#39;t [i]have[/i] to play as a child&#33;\r<br />\r<br />If you want to recruit your own apprentice, scribe, page, or any other kind of child follower, you will need a follower manager. I&#39;d strongly suggest [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?]Amazing Follower Tweaks[/url], however any follower manager (UFO, EFF, etc.) that allows the recruitment of non-follower NPCs should work with a similar process (see the guide below on recruiting children).\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=#FF8100]HOW TO INSTALL[/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF8100]Nexus Mod Manager[/color]\r<br />1.

Make sure to sort your load order with LOOT.\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=#FF8100]HOW TO GET CHILDREN TO FIGHT, AND RECRUITING MULTIPLE CHILD FOLLOWERS[/color][/heading]\r<br />[b]IMPORTANT: Before starting, if the child is an adoptable one, adopt them as per vanilla and allow them to travel to your home, then visit your home and let the &#34;Thank you for adopting me&#34; scene play out. If you do not do this, they will continue to beg for money, or complain of being cold, and keep requesting you adopt them throughout your travels.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />You can recruit non-adoptable kids with these methods too, but if you want to have more than two child followers from the pool of available adoptable kids I&#39;d strongly suggest [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249/?]Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions[/url], which will allow up to six children to be adopted. You&#39;ll soon have your own child army (You Monster)&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Most follower managers provide similar functionality, but your mileage may vary. AFT and the process below are the ones I use, and know work.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF8100][color=#FF8100]AFT/[/color]Amazing Follower Tweaks[/color]\r<br />[list][*]Use the &#34;AFT Make Follower&#34; power on the target child[/*]\r<br />[*]Talk to your new recruit and select either &#34;Follow Me...

If set to &#34;None&#34; they will still flee from combat.[/*]\r<br />[*]Give your new recruit a weapon, or they will continue to run when the fighting breaks out.[/*]\r<br />[*]Repeat for each new child you&#39;d like to recruit&#33;[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=#FF8100]EFF/Extensible Follower Framework[/color]\r<br />EFF doesn&#39;t natively contain a mechanism for recruiting non-follower NPCs, but does provide an Optional File on the download page for a &#34;Mind\r<br /> Control&#34; ability. \r<br />\r<br />[list][*]Once the Mind Control plugin is installed, you need to find the FormID of the Mind Control spell by typing:[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=#444444].[/color][color=#32689e]               [/color][font=Courier New][color=#ffe599]help &#34;Mind Control&#34;[/color][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]This will return an entry beginning with &#34;SPEL&#34;, followed by the spell&#39;s name, and then an 8-digit code alongside it.
