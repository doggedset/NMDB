(This spell lasts 30 seconds).\r<br />\r<br />Unleash Eggtor: Eggtor is a chicken god worshipped by a small group of followers.

(This power lasts 5 minutes).\r<br />\r<br />Slow Time: This spell affects the very fabric of time itself; slowing everything around you to a crawl. (This power lasts 10 seconds).\r<br />\r<br />Summon: This summon wrenches a creature&#92;&#39;s soul from the netherworld to help the caster. (This power lasts 5 minutes).\r<br />\r<br />Active Effects\r<br />\r<br />Archon Blood: You are the most powerful Hero in Albion because of your ancient bloodline leading back to the ancient rulers of the Old Kingdom, the Archon. You are a master of the three Hero traits, strength, skill and will.\r<br />(+ 50 HP, Stamina, and Magicka)\r<br />\r<br />------\r<br />Bugs\r<br />------\r<br />\r<br />None.\r<br />\r<br />------\r<br />Notes from the Modder\r<br />------\r<br />\r<br />This is my second mod for Skyrim, and I&#92;&#39;d like this to turn this mod into something that many people can enjoy.
