  "descriptionHtml": "Adds Vampire Themed fortress next to the boat that takes you to Volkihar.\r<br />\r<br />Requires Dawnguard and the unofficial patches\r<br />\r<br />V1.0\r<br />   Problems: Followers might not go over the bridge and if they do, they stop following halfway up the road. Navmesh looks fine to me. But it was my first time using it (seen a tutorial). If you like this and know how to use the Creation Kit better than me then go ahead and make W/e I did wrong, work. Other than that there&#39;s nothing wrong. I plan on adding a basement and Trophy room.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />V1.1:\r<br />   Navmesh works better, more objects inside the walls. Guards patrol the walls (3).\r<br />you can access basement but i blocked off all but the stairway because its nowhere near finished.\r<br />Made some changes to the entrance.  \r<br />Problems:\r<br />A-Hole Vampire merchant still being a pain. followers that are on the wall, that haven&#39;t made it to the ground with you, will keep running into the wall trying to make it to you.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />V1.2-.V1.3\r<br />       Complete for now, All vendors should work but they do have strange hours that they work.\r<br />Followers cant walk on basement stairs (No clue). Is now adult content just in case people don&#39;t like the theme.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please feel free to give suggestions",
