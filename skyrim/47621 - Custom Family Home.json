  "descriptionHtml": "\tThis mod gives you the possibility to move your entire family (children & spouse) to any home you want: be it a house from a mod, a house you made yourself or any place of the game. They will have a normal AI (they will do what they always do and the children will still obey you when you tell them to go outside, do their chores, etc.). You can now also move your steward, housecarl and bard to your house if you want to&#33;\r<br />\r<br />How do I move my family once I&#39;ve installed the mod?\r<br />\tA spell will automatically be given to you. It is of type &#34;power&#34; and called &#34;Move family&#34;. You use it like a shout. Once you cast the spell, it will tell you to go to different places of the house so as to let the game know what all the places of your new house correspond to (for instance, you will be asked to go to your children&#39;s bed so that your children know where to sleep).\r<br />\r<br />Requires Hearthfires.\r<br />Works only if the new home is fully navmeshed.\r<br />\r<br />I give all modders the permission (and even encourage them) to add a link to my mod on their page.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I also made:\r<br />- Skyrim Unadoption Mod (compatible with this mod)\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/47259\r<br />\r<br />But I&#39;m mostly a quest modder.
