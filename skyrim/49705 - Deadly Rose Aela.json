  "descriptionHtml": "This is a facelift of Aela the huntress that i made for myself because i hate how the vanilla Aela looks (upset Hagraven face). She is one of my favorite NPC in the game. YES i know there are a LOT of Aela facelift mods out there, but most of them make her look like a cutie pie or an ultra sexy supermodel and i hate that. I tried to make her lore friendly and similar to the vanilla version. \r<br />\r<br />This is just a facelift mod for Aela the Huntress, it doesn&#39;t change anything besides her face.\r<br />\r<br />- Install:\r<br />\r<br />Make a backup and delete any other Aela&#39;s mod before you install this one (make sure that you delete Aela&#39;s face mesh and face tint too \r<br />before you install my mod, otherwise you will get a grey texture on her face)\r<br />\r<br />The easy way, use NMM (Nexus Mod manager).\r<br />Activate the mod and place it at the bottom of your list.\r<br />\r<br />The hard way.\r<br />\r<br />-Go to the skyrim installation folder C:Program FilesSteamsteamappscommonSkyrim and drop the deadly_rose_aela.esp and \r<br />the folders meshes and textures of my mod inside your Data folder, overwrite if needed. (remember to make a backup first)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- Uninstall:\r<br />\r<br />The easy way, use NMM (Nexus Mod manager).\r<br />Deactivate the mod that&#39;s all.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The hard way.\r<br />\r<br />- Go to the skyrim installation folder and delete the following files:\r<br />\r<br />deadly_rose_aela.esp  C:Program FilesSteamsteamappscommonSkyrimdata\r<br />\r<br />0001A696.nif  C:Program FilesSteamsteamappscommonSkyrimDatameshesactorscharacterfacegendatafacegeomSkyrim.esm\r<br />\r<br />0001A696.dds  C:Program FilesSteamsteamappscommonSkyrimDatatexturesactorscharacterfacegendatafacetintSkyrim.esm\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod should be compatible with everything except with other mods that alters Aela&#39;s looks.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- You&#39;ll need Coverwomen face textures by mrLenski if you want her to look exactly like the photos \r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3563/?  (Look 3)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />She might look a slightly different in your game depending on the textures (and ENB) that you have installed.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you see a grey texture on her face, uninstall my mod and go here: \r<br />\r<br />C:Program FilesSteamsteamappscommonSkyrimDatameshesactorscharacterfacegendatafacegeomSkyrim.esm\r<br />\r<br />C:Program FilesSteamsteamappscommonSkyrimDatatexturesactorscharacterfacegendatafacetintSkyrim.esm\r<br />\r<br />delete these files 0001A696.dds and 0001A696.nif, then install my mod.\r<br />\r<br />",
