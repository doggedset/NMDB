  "summary": "Changes Storm Call shout to a daily use with a much shorter cooldown. Also improves storm call 3 with a knockback effect similar to Fus Ro Dah.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was always dissapointed that while Storm call is imo the coolest shout in the game, I never once used it during normal gameplay, only to have a laugh and then reload. This mod addresses my main issues with the shout by making it castable once a day with a much shorter cooldown (10% of original). In addition Strun Bah Qo (level 3) now has a large AOE knockback akin to Fus Ro Dah instead of just a stagger.\r\n\r\nThis made the shout an actual usable tactic for me with the daily restriction stopping it being completely OP. By the way Storm call works great with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15506]Lightning during thunderstorms[/url], it makes the storm much more intense without making every bolt hit someone and wiping out the whole town in seconds.",
