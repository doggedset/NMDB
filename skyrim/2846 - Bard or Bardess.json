  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i574.photobucket.com/albums/ss189/darydale/bard3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow][b]UPDATED!  Your bard npcs can play in Breezehome in Whiterun or Honeyside in Riften![/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]Description[/color][/b]\r\n===========\r\n\r\nUsing this mod, you can add any npc to the bard faction.  A new file allows them to play in Breezehome in Whiterun!  They should already be able to play in the Honeyside house in Riften in the default game, though I can\\'t test that at the moment.  See details for more info.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are some files to make Erik more bardlike, including a change in his default outfit and a clean face tint from [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2900]Erik the Dirt Slayer Clean NPCs[/url] by Porcelyn!  \r\n\r\nScroll down to \\'Erik the Bard\\' to read about my plans for this character.\r\n\r\nIf you want to add different factions to your npcs, see the \\'Other Factions\\' section for a how-to.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Install[/b][/color]\r\n=======\r\n\r\nDownload using Nexus Mod Manager\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nDrop everything directly into your Skyrim\\\\Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Use[/b][/color]\r\n===\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]1.[/b][/color] Make a save game you can go back to just in case!\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]2.[/color][/b] Open the console in-game (press the ` key in the upper left of your keyboard; has the ~ symbol on it).\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]3.[/b][/color] Target the npc you want to turn into a bard by clicking on them (their id should pop up on the screen).\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]4.[/b][/color] Choose what command you want.  \r\n\r\n-For a [color=orange][b]singing bard[/b][/color], type \\\"bat setbard\\\" without the quotes.  (\\\"bat removebard\\\" to undo)\r\n\r\n-For an [color=orange][b]instrumental only bard[/b][/color], type \\\"bat setint\\\" without quotes.  (\\\"bat removeint\\\" to undo)\r\n\r\n-For a [color=orange][b]bard that only sings on request[/b][/color], and does not automatically start songs, type \\\"bat setonrequest\\\" with no quotes.  (\\\"bat removeonrequest\\\" to undo)\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]\r\nDetails[/b][/color]\r\n=======\r\n[color=orange]\r\n[b]--[/b][/color] NPCs will play in inns and in Honeyside or Breezehome if you download the file for it, but usually not anywhere else.  I have occasionally seen them play randomly under other conditions, but it is rare.  If you want to make a request, or want them to play continuously, they will have to be inside one of the aforementioned areas and NOT currently be your companion.\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]--[/b][/color] Secondly, not every npc will be able to sing.  If the particular npc does not use one of the three voice actors who do bard songs, it won\\'t work; their singing will be silent.  You can check if this is the case by doing \\\"bat setbard\\\" (see Use section), then talking to them and selecting \\\"Can I make a request?\\\"  (This dialog will only appear in places where they can sing.)  If they are silent after you select a song, then that npc can only be an Instrumental Only bard.  Type \\\"bat removebard\\\" to take away their empty singing, and then type \\\"bat setint\\\" to have them randomly play instruments instead.\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]--[/b][/color] Only one NPC can play at a time.  I tried making everyone in the Bannered Mare a bard, and if I made a request to Bob while Jeff was playing, Jeff would stop playing when Bob started.\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]--[/b][/color] Keep in mind that adding factions can sometimes mess with npcs AI.  I\\'ve witnessed an npc trying to make his way to his bedroom to sleep, but having to stop every foot to play a song.  Help me test it out and report what you find!\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]Other Faction Changes[/color][/b]\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nYou can add and remove any other factions from npcs using the same method I did.  If you open up my setbard.txt file, you will find inside:\r\n\r\n\r\naddfac 000CF8F9 0\r\naddfac 00053514 0\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\\'s it!  Typing \\\"addfac 00CF8F9 0\\\" into the console with an npc targeted will add that npc to the lowest rank of the BardSingerFaction (rank 0).  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe ones I use in this mod are:\r\n\r\n000CF8F9 - BardSingerFaction\r\n00053514 - JobBardFaction\r\n000F6F87 - BardSingerInstrumentalOnlyFaction\r\n000163FA - BardSingerNoAutostart\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can do this with any other faction if you know the id.  I got the idea for this mod from abrahan1981\\'s [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2176]Marry and companion free[/url] which makes more npcs follower or marriage candidates.  The codes for those factions and a few others can be found here:  [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Console_Commands_%28Skyrim%29]http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Console_Commands_%28Skyrim%29[/url]\r\n\r\n000E0CD9 - Bandit Ally Faction\r\n000E0CDA - Warlock Ally Faction\r\n000E0CDB - Draugr Ally Faction\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re looking for another faction, you can try searching the console for it.  From Samutz\\'s [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?/topic/1286593-tutorial-making-new-smithing-recipes-pre-ck/]Smithing Recipes Tutorial[/url]:\r\n\r\n\\\"Use the game\\'s console to do a search. To do this use the command help \\\"query\\\" 0, where query is your search term. This will give you a list of all the records in the game containing the query. You can scroll through a long list using PgUp and PgDn keys.\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI typed in:\r\n\r\nhelp faction 0\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are only a few listed in game, so you may have to go a step further like I did.  You can find the entire list of factions by opening up Skyrim.esm with either TESsnip or [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=165]Skyrim Viewer[/url].  To find a faction with Skyrim Viewer:\r\n\r\nExtract and run the executable. Then File > Open.  I unchecked all Record Types except \\'FACT\\' (you don\\'t have to do this, but try it if you experience crashing with everything checked).  Click OK.  Then you can search the list for keywords (like bard) or scroll through and find the faction you want.  Once you know the faction id, you can use it with the addfac console command.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to copy the faction behavior of a particular npc, you can look up their name on the UESP Wiki and find the factions they belong to.  For example, look at Karita\\'s factions: [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Karita]http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Karita[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Erik the Bard[/b][/color]\r\n=============\r\n\r\n[[b]Check out the download section to change Erik\\'s default outfit back to his green shirt!  No more lounging around the house or playing the Lute in full armor.  There is also a file by Porcelyn that gives him a more bard-like clean face.[/b]]\r\n\r\n\r\nI made this mod because I wanted to turn Erik the Slayer into a bard.  He\\'s an ideal candidate for this mod since he lives in an inn that has no bard.  He will play at the inn in Rorikstead when he is not following you on your adventures.  You can even make him a bard before he becomes an adventurer (but you\\'ll have to do the bat command again once he becomes Erik the Slayer because that version of him has a different id).\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Future plans for Erik[/b]:[/color]\r\n\r\nI was able to make an ESP to change Erik\\'s factions, but it only works on a new game so I haven\\'t posted it yet.  Now I am working on changing his AI when he\\'s at home, fixing his behavior to accommodate his new profession.  At the moment, pre-slayer Erik never stops jamming when he\\'s inside, and often spends all day in the potato field playing his lute.  He obviously needs a schedule to temper his obsession (aka an AI package).  The follower version of Erik is less quirky, although he sometimes plays with his back to the audience.\r\n\r\nEventually I\\'d like to make Erik into a more interesting character by adding dialog lines from the same voice actor, and maybe a quest (using the anticipated CK of course).  I\\'ve already found a ton of unused lines for Erik since his voice actor used to play Hadvar.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Uninstall[/b][/color]\r\n========\r\n\r\n1. If necessary, undo the changes by using the remove commands (see Use section).\r\n\r\n2. Either deactivate in the mod manager or delete any of the following files that are in your Skyrim\\\\Data folder:\r\n\r\nreadme_bardfaction.txt\r\nremovebard.txt\r\nremoveint.txt\r\nremoveonrequest.txt\r\nsetbard.txt\r\nsetint.txt\r\nsetonrequest.txt\r\n\r\nErikDefaultClothing.esp\r\nErik the Bard.esp\r\nBreezehomePerformances.esp\r\n\r\nAnd to make Erik dirty again, go to Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\facegendata\\\\facetint\\\\skyrim.esm\\\\ and delete 00065657.dds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Thanks & Recommended Mods[/b][/color]\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nPorcelyn for [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2900]Erik the Dirt Slayer Clean NPCs[/url]!\r\n\r\nSTSG for [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3100]Female bard for your house[/url] and \r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2842]Dragonborn by malukah bard song replacer[/url]\r\n\r\nK3FKA for [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3023]Dragonborn song w lute[/url]\r\n\r\nabrahan1981 for [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2176]Marry and companion free[/url]\r\n\r\nLojack for [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=165]Skyrim Viewer[/url]\r\n\r\nremmy88 for [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1726]Housecarl Clothing[/url]\r\n\r\nexpired6978 for [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3111]Follower Tweaks - Several Flavors[/url]  (Careful what version you pick if you\\'re using my file to change Erik\\'s default clothing, they will conflict or over-write each other.)\r\n\r\nSamutz for his Smithing Recipes Tutorial (where I learned how to make an ESP with TESsnip)\r\n\r\nHolzpullover for [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=812]Colorad Details Elven Armor FM and M[/url] (IMO, a great bard armor.
