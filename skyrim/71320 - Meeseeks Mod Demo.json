  "modName": "Meeseeks Mod Demo",
  "summary": "Here is a very rough version of the Meeseeks mod, based on the popular character from the Adult Swim cartoon, Rick and Morty.",
  "descriptionHtml": "NOTE: This is a demo version of the Meeseeks Box mod. In this mod, you can use a Meeseeks Box to summon a Meeseeks and issue it a few simple fetch commands. It&#39;s a bit buggy, though, and I recommend saving your game before trying it.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Dump the contents of the zip file into your &#34;data&#34; folder. (should be C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;SteamApps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data). Make sure you&#39;ve also installed the separate mod, race compatibility. Start the Skyrim launcher and click &#34;data files.&#34; Make sure only RaceCompatibility.esm and MeeseeksRace.esp are checked. And make sure RaceCompatibility.esm is above MeeseeksRace.esp in the list. If it isn&#39;t, highlight RaceCompatibility.esm and click the up arrow by &#34;modify load order&#34; until it is at the top of the list. Next launch the game. \r<br />\r<br />Find the Meeseeks Box in the Riverwood Trader. Or if you like, bring up the console command, with the ~tilde~ key and type &#34;coc riverwoodriverwoodtrader&#34;. There&#39;s a chest on the second floor, &#34;Rick and Morty Chest,&#34; which contains the Meeseeks Box. I&#39;ve noticed that he sometimes gets stuck, especially when told to bring you armor or weapons. I&#39;ve had the highest success rate with &#34;gold.&#34; \r<br />\r<br />This mod is best demonstrated in a little room I made. Type &#34;coc xxx&#34; in the command console. Retrieve the box from the chest behind the bar. ",
