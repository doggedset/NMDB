  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Alve [/b]is found at Moorside Inn in Morthal. \r<br />\r<br />Info/spec: \r<br />#1 She is marriable \r<br />#2 Serves as a follower (class: vampire) \r<br />#3 Non essential NPC (she can die) \r<br />#4 She is leveled to your character (ranging from level 15 to 999)\r<br />\r<br />Without disrupting the game quests and avoid rendering save files asunder. Closest thing we can have to the original is a clone, a replication. While it is not original. As in her. Only difference in this case of Alva, is that she is not dead. \r<br />\r<br />To be bound together, now and forever. Or die together, fighting together. \r<br />\r<br />(Textures and Meshes directories have been included to avoid a character appearance bug. That causes the head of the NPC to not match the body.)",
