  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i1162.photobucket.com/albums/q524/exraycatt/banner3.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nXRC HD IMPERIAL ARMORY\r\n\r\nThe goal of this mod was to redesign the Imperial Armors to look like they are newer and better cared for, and to provide them with high-res textures.  I personally felt the vanilla Imperial Armor sets looked like they were Halloween costumes found in a garbage dumpster in Morthal.  The Imperial Legion is the most well-funded and powerful entity in Tamriel, and they should have uniforms that reflect this.   I retextured everything from scratch, using new normal and specular maps, and I added environment maps to the metallic portions of armor to give them a more realistic metal appearance.  I designed these for my own use according to my own personal tastes, which of course may not be yours…\r\n\r\nBTW If anyone wants the mesh fix for the male Imperial Studded Armor (I highly recommend this because it makes it look like it was supposed to in the first place, adding the metal plates to the skirt area), but you don\\'t want to use my mod, then you can get the mesh here:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17145/?tab=2&navtag=/ajax/modimages/?user=0|:|id=17145]Studded Imperial Armor Fix[/url]\r\n\r\n2 VERSIONS: \r\nv1 - looks brand new basically with some wear on the metal pieces\r\nv2 - slightly more worn though still fairly clean and new looking, in the images section, if it doesn\\'t say \\\"v2\\\" then the pic is of version 1 - cleanest with the least wear\r\n\r\nGranted the 2 versions may look very similar but in-game you will definitely see a difference\r\n\r\nWHAT YOU GET:\r\nAll cuirasses are 2K in resolution, everything else is 1K\r\n\r\nMale and Female sets of:\r\n\r\nImperial Light Cuirass\r\nImperial Light Boots\r\nImperial Light Gauntlets\r\nImperial Light Gloves\r\nStudded Imperial Armor\r\nImperial Armor (Heavy set)\r\nImperial Boots\r\nImperial Gauntlets\r\nImperial Helmet\r\nImperial Officer’s Helmet\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\n1) Use NMM\r\nOr\r\n2) Manual – drop the “data” folder into your Skyrim folder and merge if asked to do so.\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION:\r\n1) Use NMM\r\nOr\r\n2) Manual – delete the “Imperial” folder from data\\\\meshes\\\\armor and from data\\\\textures\\\\armor\r\n\r\nKNOWN CONFLICTS:\r\n\r\nThis should only conflict with anything that changes the meshes or textures for Imperial Armor.\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nThe Nexus Staff and Community\r\nBethesda\r\nPhotoshop\r\nQuixel for NDO2\r\nShutterstock for material patterns\r\nNiftools team for Nifskope\r\nBellyache for teaching me Photoshop\r\nRegaz for teaching me how to make a mod\r\nCaBaL120 for texturing advice and tips\r\nSpaceinvader91 for fixing the mesh issue on the Studded Imperial Armor and for allowing free use of the fix\r\n\r\n",
