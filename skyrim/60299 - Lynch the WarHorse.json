  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff0000][size=4][b][color=#980000][color=#00ff00]FIX HAS BEEN TESTED AND IT DOES WORK. DELETE OLD FILE AND DOWNLOAD NEW FILE. CHANGED HIM TO HORSERACE INSTEAD OF CUSTOM RACE. WORKS INGAME. PLEASE TELL ME IT FIXES YOUR HORSE OR IF PROBLEMS PERSIST, THANK YOU. There is a second file for the note, so it is now optional (You can just look down at the bottom of the description if you don&#39;t want to be bothered.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />[/color][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />UPDATE 2: Deleted old textures and files, so there should be no more texture problems. Uninstall the mod completely and then download the latest version to make sure that all files are gone from your Skyrim. Sorry about the problems, the old .dds files archived with the new ones in the .bsa file. Thank you for your patience, and I am trying to best to get him to function perfectly. Comment if problems persist, or if are fixed.\r<br />\r<br />Also, people were asking me to make him enabled to carry items. If anyone could tell me how to do that, that would be lovely and I would do it. I don&#39;t have Blender or anything right now, so saddlebags would be out of my area, but I could definitely love to get him to hold items.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE: Minimaps fixed for Lynch and aggression bugs handled.\r<br />\r<br />Future Update: Possibly getting him to carry items.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod is a player horse, that is all yours, once you findhim. The scarred warhorse is wandering the world of Tamriel but a mysterious\r<br />someone named Archibald knows exactly where he is and is willing to give you\r<br />the location, if you can figure out his riddle. This is not a quest mod. While\r<br />there is a quest-like aspect to it, there is not quest scripting in it. You\r<br />find the piece of paper and figure things out. Lynch the WarHorse is twice as\r<br />fast as the dull horses in the Holds stables, and will never die in battle.\r<br />This scarred horse is exactly what you need if you want a horse that will stand\r<br />by your side.\r<br />\r<br />               \r<br />First Version of Lynch:\r<br />New Textures for both saddle and horse.\r<br />Aggressive towards player enemies.\r<br />Is essential and invincible, so will not die.\r<br />Follows ENCBlackSaddledHorse scripting\r<br /> \r<br />(Will update for the horse to follow the player if someonetells me how to do it.)\r<br /> \r<br />To find Lynch, go to the Bannered Mare and find the note.(Should be around the bar.) Solve the riddle. If, for some reason, the note is\r<br />nowhere to be found, here is the information:\r<br /> \r<br />[spoiler]Dragonborn -- \r<br /> \r<br />You might not know me, but I know of you. I was an adventurer like you, until some bloody hags turned me into a wolf. Yes, yes,\r<br />how is a wolf writing to you, eh? Let&#39;s not think about that too hard. I have\r<br />something for you.\r<br /> \r<br />I spent my life running after this horse. Spotted thing with red eyes, but it was more than that. He can&#39;t die, and he&#39;s faster than any\r<br />other horse in Skyrim. Imagine having to never pay for another horse. He&#39;s an\r<br />old war horse, but he&#39;s a good one, a little scarred up, but would be a good\r<br />companion for you. \r<br /> \r<br />Now, I&#39;m not going to just give him to you, of course. Got to solve my riddle. I can&#39;t use the horse anymore, but you got to prove your\r<br />worth: find the location where love and war combines, both lost in time. That&#39;s\r<br />all I&#39;m saying, have fun.\r<br /> \r<br />-- A friend called Archibald[/spoiler]",
