  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Guard\\'s Equipment comment tweak\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nDate: 9/01/2012\r\nCategory: NPCs\r\nAuthor(s): Vroix\r\nSource: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20414\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis mod will change the required condition for the guards to comment your armor/ weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nIn vanilla Skyrim, most guards will comment on your armor and weapons (swords mostly) according to what kind of armor you wear. Usually they comment on the material the armor/ weapon is made of. Then, you start installing some new armors/ weapons from other mods and then you notice the guard stop commenting on your armor/ weapons.\r\nThis happen because the condition for that comment to show up is the player must equip the exact armor (i.e guards will comment about how unreliable iron sword is IF you equip vanilla iron sword).\r\nIf you want the guards to keep commenting your equipment while wearing armor/ weapons from other mods, then this mod is for you.\r\nWhat this mod does is simply change the required condition of the comment from \\\"based on equipping the exact armor/ weapons\\\" to \\\"material based\\\" of the armor or weapons.\r\nfor example, in vanilla the guard will comment about your steel sword because you equip the exact \\'steel sword\\', if you wear another sword made of steel from another mod, the guard will stop giving comments. Now after you activate this mod, the guard will still give comment on your sword whether you\\'re equipping the vanilla steel sword, steel katana from \\'Weapons of Third Era\\\" or even Bastard Sword from \\\"Jaysus Sword\\\".\r\n\r\nTo put it simply, before you install this mod :\r\n1, Guard\\'s comment on sword will show up only if you equip the exact vanilla sword (iron sword/ elven sword/ ebony sword/ steel sword).\r\n2. Guard\\'s comment on armor will show up only if you wear the exact cuirass (iron armor/ iron banded/ dwarven armor/ dragonplate cuirass/ dragonscale cuirass/ leather armor/ hide armor/ steel armor/ steel plate armor/ orcish armor/ scaled armor).\r\n\r\nAfter you install this mod :\r\n1, Guard\\'s comment on sword will show up if you equip any sword that is categorized as iron/ steel/ elven/ ebony/ daedric.\r\n2. Guard\\'s comment on armor will show up if you wear at least 3 apparel (normally chest, boots, and gloves) categorized as iron/ steel/ steel plate/ dwarven/ leather/ hide/ ebony/ orcish/ scaled/ daedric/ dragonplate/ dragonscale.\r\n\r\nNow with the new version, Guard\\'s comment about skill will change too. It will not depends on player\\'s skill level anymore (except for magics skill). I do this because I think it\\'s a little weird that guards comment about your skill based on skill level (comment about light armor skill even if I don\\'t wear light armor at all). Detailed explanation :\r\nOne Handed Weapon Skill Comment : will show up if you wear any kind of one handed weapon.\r\nTwo Handed Weapon Skill Comment : will show up if you wear any kind of two handed weapon.\r\nHeavy/ Light Armor Skill Comment : will show up if you wear at least 3 pieces of the corresponding armor (3 pieces of light armor/ 3 pieces of heavy armor).\r\nArchery Skill Comment : will show up if you wear any kind of bow.\r\nSpeech Skill Comment : will show up if you have successfully persuade people 50 times.\r\nBarter (Speech) Skill Comment : will show up if you have traded with merchants for at least 200 times.\r\nSneaking Skill Comment : will show up if you have tresspass more than 25 times. The other comment will show up if you have more than 50 sneak attacks on your misc stat.\r\nAlchemist Skill Comment : will show up if you have made 50 potions and 50 poisons.\r\nEnchanting Skill Comment : will show up if you have enchant more than 50 weapons.\r\nPickpocket Skill Comment : will show up if you have pickpocket more than 50 times.\r\nLockpcik Skill Comment : will show up if you have picked more than 50 locks.\r\nAll Magic School Comment : will show up if the corresponding skill level is at least 75.\r\n\r\nIf the above settings are awkward or doesn\\'t make any sense, feel free to give me suggestion. I might consider it.\r\n\r\nOptional file is also available for those who doesn\\'t want the skill comment to change or perhaps prefer other alternatives.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re updating, please uninstall the previous version first and create a clean save.\r\n\r\nLoad Order\r\n==========\r\nBOSS will not recognize this (yet), however you can put this in your userlist.txt\r\n\r\nADD: Vrx Guards Equipment Comment Tweak.esp\r\nBOTTOM: Overrides V\r\n\r\nOr if you\\'re familiar with BOSS Userlist Manager, you can edit it with that.\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Install\r\n=========================\r\n1.
