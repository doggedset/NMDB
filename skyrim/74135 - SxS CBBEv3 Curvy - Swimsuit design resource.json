  "descriptionHtml": "After my work with Nereid Pirate I wanted to create a swimsuit collection.\r<br />Many designs came up, different ideas and tested for weight 0.\r<br />But... as I have decided to stop modding I have not completed all designs,\r<br />there might be issues and I have made weight 0 only.\r<br />\r<br />I therefore release this to the community with source files for anyone\r<br />to use and/or build upon to create something else.\r<br />\r<br />SxS is just this mods working title.\r<br />\r<br />The package contains a total of 45 designs, all with blend files and\r<br />all are avaible (as weight 0) in game.\r<br />\r<br />Important notes:\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />It has been designed for CBBEv3 Curvy.\r<br />\r<br />Included in this package is actually working models inside the game but\r<br />for weight 0 only as I haven&#39;t made conversions for weight 1.\r<br />I have it in place for playtesting.\r<br />\r<br />The texture is simply a 4K texture used as a base for all suits.\r<br />\r<br />Only way to obtain them is through the console. Type help &#34;sxs&#34; to get the IDs.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Final words:\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />The journey from never using a 3D model program to this point has been really fun\r<br />and I have learned a lot.\r<br />Still see myself as mediocre model maker and have much to learn still but I have\r<br />decided not to pursue this path any further.\r<br />It&#39;s been as a hobby only while I still have Skyrim installed I am moving away from\r<br />it and I don&#39;t see myself creating something for other games, at least not as involved as I have\r<br />been with this title.\r<br />The community i general is a great one and I hope it will keep being great in the future.\r<br />\r<br />I will not be a stranger here on Nexus but how much I visit or engage myself, only the future can tell :)",
