  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is inspired by both aipex8s Daedra of Coldharbour mod and the overall color theme of Molag Bal and his minions in Elder Scrolls Online. \r<br />\r<br />It also reminds me a little of Death Knights from World of Warcraft, although that was not my original intention.\r<br />\r<br />What this mod does is replace the eyes of the Dawnguard vampires with eyes that more fit a minion of Coldharbour. It makes them glowing and blue. This replaces all the eyes of all the vampires in the game. This includes the eyes of Vampire Lords.\r<br />\r<br />The images has images of how all the different significant Vampire NPCs in Skyrim look with the eyes. I also included a screenshot of each race with the eyes to show how they look on each. \r<br />\r<br />Requires Dawnguard\r<br />\r<br />Note - Dead Thralling a vampire with the mod Necromancy-- Undead FX looks really cool with this mod installed.\r<br />\r<br />Note: Vampire Lord eyes work with any eye replacer. Just download this mod first, then any mod you install over it; your Vampire Lord form will have those eyes.\r<br />\r<br />Future plans:\r<br />Adding an add-on for Dynamic Vampire Appearance that makes the glowing blue eyes become more undead-like the higher stage of Vampire you are.\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts:\r<br />This will conflict with any mods that change the Dawnguard vampire eyes or anything that replaces the mesh for the Vampire Lords. Mods that replace only the Vampire Lord texture will work though. If you want these eyes over a different mod that alters vampire eyes, just download the other one first, then download this mod and over rite. \r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods:\r<br />Daedra of Coldharbour by Aipex8: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51596/?\r<br />Lustmord Vampire Armor by AmethystDeceiver: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25852/?\r<br />Necromancy-- Undead FX by WDog367: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36158/?",
