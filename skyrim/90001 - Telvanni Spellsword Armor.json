  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/O1KR3qy.png[/img]﻿﻿[/center]\n<br />\n<br />This mod adds a set of Telvanni-themed Spellsword armor meant for the Dovahkiin that prefers to run into battle with a sword and a spell at the ready. The armor set is similar to chitin armor in strength and requires the \"Elven Smithing\" perk to craft and temper. Crafting requires chitin plates, netch leather, leather strips and iron ingots.\n<br />\n<br />A \"starter\" set can be found enchanted in an urn in Tel Mithryn, offering Magicka regen, Fortify Destruction, Fortify One-Handed and Muffle. The set was originally created as an alternative to the hood and college robe received by Mirabelle at the college but has since evolved from there.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Notes[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Female version is vanilla body. I do not use CBBE or any other body mods, so I can't create versions for them, nor can I support them. The set is covering from head to toe, however, so you probably won't need to worry about any seams or gaps. That being said, I originally created this set for men.\n<br />\n<br />This is not added to any leveled lists. There are maybe two or three members of the Great House Telvanni in all of Skyrim (not including your Dovahkiin if you are roleplaying as one or as an honorary member after doing Neloth's quests), so it wouldn't make sense for anyone else to wear this set. Though, I imagine it would look nice on Teldryn.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][b][size=3]Credits[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Cuirass mesh from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50339/]Netch Leather[/url] created by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5226693]THusky[/url] with body retexture by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7148503]HeirOfTheSeptems[/url]\n<br />[*]Scarf and chitin parts of the pauldron are from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35776/]Telvanni Robes HD Retexture[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5657210]Rafuel[/url]\n<br />[*]Texture for gloves and boots created by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3231858]Elianora[/url] for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63918/]Blue Telvanni Robes[/url]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=3][b]Special Edition version available [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15830]HERE[/url].[/b][/size][/color]",
