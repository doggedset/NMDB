  "summary": "Awelgriz is a standalone and craftable greatsword powered by a new enchantment: Dark Wind.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Awelgriz looks like a bound greatsword but she don\\'t depend of conjuration perk. She can be crafted in miscellaneous section, but you must have daedric smithing perk because she has damage points like daedric greatsword. Due to her magical nature, she is faster that other two handed weapons.\r\nShe\\'s made for player who walk on the warrior way, you don\\'t need to have conjuration school perk to have her, only daedric smithing. Awelgriz is not enchanted with vanilla enchantment of bound weapons. She has a special enchantment: Power of Dark Wind  with new visual effect when you hit a ennemy. This power drains 20 points of health and stamina, and Awelgriz don\\'t need to be recharged.\r\nYou can learn this power at enchant table and apply it to other weapons. \r\nNB: Power of Dark Wind don\\'t speed up other weapons. The speed of Awelgriz is not due to her enchantment but to her magical nature.",
