  "descriptionHtml": "Adds in Forsworn clothing with the same appearance as Forsworn armor. Why? Because I liked the way Forsworn armor looks, and wanted clothing to wear as a mage using the Mage Armor perks from SPERG and such. Because of this, all of it is considered clothing, with reduced weight, and no armor bonuses. \r<br />\r<br />To get the armor, one must use the console. It all starts with &#34;Forsworn Cloth&#34;, so\r<br />help &#34;forsworn cloth&#34; 4\r<br />in the console will list all four items to add to your inventory.",
