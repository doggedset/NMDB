  "summary": "Makes the Companions Guild a little better.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Okay, the point of this mod is to add some class to the Companions (Guild). I thought they were a little too rag-tag for a supposedly very successful and very well-known mercenary group so I decided to give them a face-lift and make them look more like an organized, well-funded Mercenary/Militia group.\r\n\r\nPossible bugs:\r\nThese are bugs that I experienced while testing my mod. They may not happen to you but then again they might. Best be prepared.\r\n-Wrong Armor\r\nIf for some reason the Companions aren\\'t showing up in their proper armor, leave Whiterun for a few days and come back. If that still hasn\\'t fixed the problem bring up the console (Press the ~ button next to the 1) click on the individual or individuals in question type in \\\"resurrect\\\" without the quotes and hit enter. They should immediately respawn with the proper armor and weapons. If for some reason that doesn\\'t work then you have a mod conflicting with this one. Choose which one you want and remove it.\r\n-No Weapons:\r\nAgain, bring up the console, select the person in question and type in the command \\\"showinventory\\\" without quotes and hit enter. Scoll through the list and you\\'ll see the weapons in their inventory. Then type in the code \\\"equipitem <item code>\\\" and hit enter. For those of you unfamiliar with console commands <item code> will be the 8 digit number in parenthesis next to the name of the item.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n\r\n-Athis now wears Steel Plate Armor and has a Steel Shield\r\n-Brill now wears Fine Clothes\r\n-Eorlund Gray-Mane now wears Blacksmith Clothing\r\n-Njada Stonearm now wears Steel Plate Armor and has a Steel Shield\r\n-Ria now wears Steel Plate Armor and has a Steel Shield\r\n-Skjor now wears the Wolf Armor Helmet and carries the Shield of Ysgramor\r\n-Tilma the Haggard now wears Fine Clothes\r\n-Torvar now wears Steel Plate Armor and has a Steel Shield\r\n-Vignar Gray-Mane (Honorary Companion Member) now wears Wolf Armor\r\n-Aela now wears Wolf Armor and has an Imperial Bow with Steel Arrows\r\n-Farkas now wears Wolf Armor\r\n-Changed stats of Wolf Armor to be equivalent to Steel Plate Armor in Armor Rating, Weight and Price\r\n\r\nPlans for future release:\r\n-Steel Plate Armor set rewarded to player for joining the Companions.\r\n\r\nRecommended mods but not included:\r\nKnight Steel Plate Armor:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5008\r\nWolf Armor Remix:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3896\r\nShield of the Lone Wolf:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1110\r\nWerewolf Beast Run Animation:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2179\r\nBetter Werewolf:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4102\r\n\r\nUtilities used:\r\nSkyrim NPC Editor:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4554\r\nSkyEdit:\r\nhttps://github.com/uesp/skyedit/downloads\r\nTESSnip:\r\nhttp://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2114\r\n\r\nAnd while you\\'re here you might as well check out my other mods:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=2253779",
