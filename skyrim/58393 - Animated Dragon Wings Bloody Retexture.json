I am not very good at texturing.Â Other people with real texture making skills seem to be unable willing to share. This is simply what I ended up with after some trial and error. If people wish to share their version of the textures, I will most likely either replace mine or added it to downloads.\r<br />[size=6]F[/size]uture plans? Depending on interest possibly attempt to improve the current texture. Maybe more colors variants?",
