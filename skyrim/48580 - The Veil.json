  "summary": "I mod I made for my collections and displays",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is for collectors, it has separate rooms/cells for different weapon types and many mannequins for all your display requirements. All crafting stations. The main cell will display new items and teleport locations as you visit new areas and complete certain quests (if you&#39;re using this mod on a game in progress you may find a few of the artifacts in The Veil floating in mid-air, this is because the display pieces for them have been set to &#39;enable&#39; upon visiting certain places, if this happens just re-visit the place where you obtained the item to enable its display).\r<br />\r<br />Note: The Veil garbage bin is exactly what it says...  any items left in the bin when it closes will be deleted immediately and permanently from the game, player discretion is advised. Good for dumping stuff you didn&#39;t want to pick up without cluttering game saves.\r<br /> \r<br />Spell Tome for The Veil Can be found in Dragonsreach on one of the bookshelves in the rear.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />\r<br />Dragonborn DLC\r<br />Hearthfires DLC (If you still have the Hearthfires/Breezehome glitch, this mod will fix it)\r<br />Dawnguard DLC\r<br />General Stores http://bit.ly/1bntutH\r<br />General Displays http://bit.ly/1hEBxKV\r<br />Flexible Containers http://bit.ly/IRVr6i",
