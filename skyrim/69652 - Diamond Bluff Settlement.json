  "descriptionHtml": "[center][u][color=#9fc5e8][size=6]Diamond Bluff Settlement[/size][/color][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Welcome to Diamond Bluff&#33; All it contains are minor changes to the [color=#00ffff]Solitude Lighthouse[/color] area, where 3 new buildings are located. It provides a small fishing area, owned by Clan Vainswith, with a couple merchants that come by to sell their wares and resupply the farm and outpost. It is all cleaned with TES5Edit, and modifies a small area comparatively unused by other mod authors. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#9fc5e8]The town contains: [/color]\r<br />- A permanent location for [color=#00ffff][/color][url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Talsgar_the_Wanderer][color=#00ffff]Talsgar the Wanderer[/color][/url], so he might actually play his talents after you pay him. He will still appear randomly on the roads, but this is his most frequent stop, you could say. \r<br />- A few NPC merchants, including a new farmstead; Vainswith Farm and Windmill.\r<br />- An expansion to the Solitude Lighthouse to reflect the interior cell. \r<br />- Two Solitude town guards with their own shack.\r<br />- Unique exterior details, including rope rails and crystal light sticks, and a giant mudcrab carapace.\r<br />- A new player home&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#6fa8dc]The Player Home contains:[/color]\r<br />- [color=#00ffff]Multiple Adoption friendly&#33; [/color]Yet, it contains only 2 follower/child beds, and a master bed. \r<br />- Four exterior planters, along with regular garden.\r<br />- Spectacular view of the Sea of Ghosts.\r<br />- Moderate storage and space, with enchanting and alchemy workstations. \r<br />(Unfortunately, no blacksmithing stations. Solitude is the best place next for services)\r<br />- Personalized decor, such as privy and washstation mirror.\r<br />- Small, cozy cabin atmosphere on the coast&#33; \r<br />[color=#6d9eeb]\r<br />[color=#76a5af]Requirements: [/color][/color]\r<br />- Dragonborn (Many aesthetic elements)\r<br />- Hearthfire (For crafting and family adoptions)\r<br />[color=#93c47d]\r<br />Incompatabilities: [/color]\r<br />- Any mod that might modify the exterior of the Solitude Lighthouse area.\r<br />\r<br />I made this town as my favored homestead for a new playthrough; Not so close to a town nor too far away when being the Dragonborn, loved and hated by many factions of the game. The player home is &#39;technically&#39; owned by a previous homesteader who has paid for the cabin, but has yet to claim it; He is perhaps lost at sea. The Dragonborn thus takes the claim as their own, and Clan Vainswith is none the wiser. \r<br />[color=#3c78d8]\r<br />[color=#00ffff]Thank you for downloading and trying it out&#33; Version 1.5 might be released in the foreseeable future&#33;[/color][/color]\r<br />[/center]",
