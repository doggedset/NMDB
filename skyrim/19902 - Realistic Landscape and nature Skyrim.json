  "descriptionHtml": "\r\n\r\nInfo\r\ni decided to do this after seeing how bland skyrim is, its good yes, but there\\'s not enough trees or creatures to live off, while i was doing it i started to add little twists as i remembered the unique landscapes from oblivion, i plan to make this more realistic and maybe add some things to do and explore (is the ocean really that empty at the bottom?)\r\n\r\nif you believe certain areas should be modded to look someway please tell me in the comments or PM me, that way i can have a look at the area\r\n\r\nI have a general idea of how i am going to mod the various holds from how i believe they should be\r\n- falkreath i see as a large forested hold with plenty of game\r\n- whiterun i see as a nice plain with a few patches of trees\r\n- makarth needs more rocks, nuff said!\r\n- the snowey areas of windhelm and winterhold ive got a general idea of, wont be long before i start them\r\n\r\nRecommended mods\r\nclaralux - more and brighter lights ( the lanterns in the picture are thanks to this mod\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17605\r\n\r\nFuture plans\r\n- add more to falkreath\r\n- do large areas which you may travel through (encourage you to walk instead of fast travel :D)\r\n- add more realism and beauty (sometimes ugly things as well, not everything can be nice looking)\r\n\r\nif you want anywhere else modded just request it and explain what it is lacking.\r\n\r\nLog\r\nV0.01- added deer and trees to riverwood\r\nV0.02- added elks to whiterun plains, also made some patches of trees bigger, also added primitive structures for giants\r\nV0.04- added trees to falkreath  (planning on expanding), made the dark brotherhood base \\'hidden\\' \r\nV0.05- added more stuff around falkreath\r\n\r\nInstall\r\nto install simply download and extract the files, the place the contents in your skyrim/data folder",
