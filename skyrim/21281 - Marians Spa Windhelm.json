  "descriptionHtml": "This location MOD is as follows;\r\n(Not require the DawnGuard contents)\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n1. Spa resort town\r\n=========================\r\nThe town is connected to Skyrim world by a Loading-door.\r\nThe loading door is very near the Wreck of Winter War near Windhelm (Map marker added)\r\nI show you the place in the pic.\r\n\r\nAlso, EnglishMuffin made a nice video for this mod as follows;\r\n[youtube]8eedunc0X3I&feature=relmfu[/youtube]\r\n(Thanks for EnglishMuffin.  o/  o/)\r\n\r\n=============================\r\n2. Town includes the followings\r\n=============================\r\n\\\\\\\\ Cafe bar (Alchemy sign)\r\nMany merchants/things concerning Alchemy crafts (cheat chests included).\r\nAlso I put Blades/Dark-bro faction people.\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ Wine bar (Winking skeever sign)\r\nSeveral merchants conerning faction goods (cheat chests included).\r\nAlso I put Companions/Thieves faction people.\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ Mead bar \r\nSeveral merchants conerning food crafts (cheat chests included).\r\nAlso I put Storm Cloaks/Khajits people.\r\nStorm Cloaks can use many Shouts when they are in your follower.\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ Black smith\r\nSeveral merchants conerning armor/weapon crafts (cheat chests included).\r\n1 guy sells daedric things.\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\ Player Rest House (I put 2 High-Hroghkar banners as a Dova sign)\r\nSeveral player\\'s butlers \r\nBasic living furnitures/bed/Respawn food chests\r\nAlso I put lore house carls (Mage version of Lydia/Jordis/Iona included).\r\n\r\n--> Player private crafting space\r\nAlchemy space where you can store bunch of alchemy ingredients.\r\nAlso I put several cheats chest containing many ingredients. \r\n(for the purpose of instant craft for interesting mods... I love trying someones crafting mods).\r\n\r\nArmor/weapon crafting space where you can store bunch of materials/weapons/armors.\r\nAlso I put several cheats chest containing many ingots/ores/pelts/jewels.\r\n(for the purpose of instant craft for interesting mods... I love trying someones armor/weapon mods).\r\n\r\n\r\n=============================\r\n3. Town people ready to follow\r\n=============================\r\n3.1 Stats of Town NPCs\r\nI set town people (such as Companions/ DB initiates/ Thieves members/ Colledge mages/ etc.. ) to be ready to fight by giving them many useful combat perks/skills/spells. So when they level according to your char level, they will be able to cast strong spells/ to manuver skills.\r\n\r\nI put major skills on their name, such as \\\"Astrid Fire DualWield\\\". So please refer to their name for their major skills. Basically I put all the perks into them which player can obtain.\r\n\r\nThey are not essential but respawn-type, so even if they die they will pop up again after a while (30 days of Skyrim time-zone,,, i suppose) \r\n\r\n3.2 How to have town NPCs follow you\r\nIf you want my town people follow you as a Follower;\r\n- Open the console\r\n- Click the char whom you wanat to follow you\r\n- Input \\\"bat friend\\\" or \\\"bat friend02\\\" (bat friend02 enables the follower very faster)\r\n- Close the console\r\n- talk to him/her to follow\r\n\r\nOr make a BAT file by yourself by including the following sentences;\r\nsetrelationshiprank player 4\r\naddfac 19809 1\r\naddfac 5c84d 1\r\naddfac 5a1a4 1\r\n\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n4. About Gray-faced NPCs\r\n=========================\r\nFirst of all, when you in the Spa building or in the dark place, the face of NPCs seem to be gray.  Also, some female NPCs are originally relatively gray-ish white skin tone. (I realize this when I check the faces of some female NPCs)\r\n\r\nI put FaceGen file into main file, so you dont need to do the following, but in case of my bad uploading; \r\nput the optional \\\"FaceGen\\\" folder manually in your; Data\\\\\\\\textures\\\\\\\\actors\\\\\\\\character\\\\\\\\FaceGenData\\\\\\\\FaceTint> \r\n\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n5. About replica Airship\r\n=========================\r\nIt just stay there...it doesnt fly around...\r\n\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n6. Known problems\r\n=========================\r\n- If you have many followers (such as 10 @o@), the loading to the bars may stop.\r\ni assume this is because the place is CPU-heavy. \r\n\r\n- When you use my BAT file to a follower in the mist-heavy place like in the bar,\r\nfirst \\\"disable\\\" the fog/mist, then use the \\\"bat friend\\\". \r\n\r\n- Some of the NPCs have a fire-tail (especially Ranger type NPCs), I put the Fire-Atronach ability for those NPCs. This is for the following reason; when they are in sneaking with you, they are transparent. so if they have the fire-tail, you can see where they are (without it, you may mistakenly shoot the arrow in their head.  lol  lol  and they get aggroed with you...). \r\n\r\n=========================\r\n7. My other mod\r\n=========================\r\n- Marians Lake Port Riften\r\nAnother town mod\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18111/\r\n\r\n- Marians usual tools\r\nWhen you feel dull on your follower/enemies/your char, try this ^ ^\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18854\r\n\r\n- Marians Splash Markarth\r\nAnother town mod\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18507/\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n8. Lastly\r\n=========================\r\nInitially this mod was for my own use, so i made this with my taste.\r\nBut as long as i upload the mod, i always listen to your advice/opinion. o/ o/\r\n\r\nAnyway sorry for the inconveniences in DLing or other things...\r\nI still havent understood much about uploading a MOD... T_T\r\n\r\n<<<< Updates Planning >>>\r\n\r\n- Add a shop selling Spell tomes.\r\n\r\n- And some suggestions from you ~~~~ o/ o/\r\n(Though i am humble modder, so Quests kinda are out of range T_T)\r\n(And Quests scripts always bugging lol)\r\n\r\n\r\nIntention of my mod (You dont have to read my personal intention ^ ^):\r\nAt first place (After few weeks of release of the Skyrim), I wanted to make town citizens (such as Ysolda/Ingun Blair/Rorik... etc) to follow me. And also I want the same thing from some special NPCs who cannot be follower due to the key-quest giver Balgraaf/Ulfric/Tulius/Mercer... etc).\r\n\r\nSo I made several crones of them by the CK for my own use. still I felt alittle bit hollow just put my NPCs in the town or somewhere, so I decided to make some town where my Lore-base followers can live. \r\n\r\nIn a sense this town mod itself is my home (or i would like rather to say Player\\'s home ^ ^). When we want some help from the citizens of my mod, we can point them and type \\\"bat friend\\\" (in the console). And I made them various types of combat (1 handed/2 handed/ Dual/ Element/ Con). They are not essential but they are Re-spawning NPCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
