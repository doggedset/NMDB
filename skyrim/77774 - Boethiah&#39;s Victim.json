  "descriptionHtml": "This is a resource for Skyrim&#39;s quest &#34;Boethiah&#39;s Calling&#34;. &#34;Boethiah&#39;s Victim&#34; is as simple as it sounds. It adds a follower NPC to the exterior of the Windhelm Stables. This NPC is intended as a replacement for all other NPC&#39;s one would otherwise choose from as a sacrifice to the Daedric prince. Save the original game characters, and those of its DLC&#39;s for a better purpose.\r<br />\r<br />The mod has been tested and found working. No further updates should be expected. The follower NPC is not respawning, as he&#39;s supposed to be sacrificed anyway.\r<br />\r<br />=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=\r<br />\r<br />Side note:\r<br />\r<br />This is not the only mod I&#39;ve created and released. If you take a look at the list, maybe you&#39;ll find something else you like as well.",
