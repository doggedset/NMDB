  "descriptionHtml": "[b]This Follower is Standalone, meaning she requires no other mods. This follower is available for FREE, as ALL MODS should be. If she appears on the steam workshop as a paid mod, then she was reuploaded.\r<br />\r<br />Vimune can be located in Morthal, at Moorside Inn. She is an adorable 11 year old Khajiit.\r<br />\r<br />She is a mage, and can cast a variety of spells. If you have Hearthfire, you can adopt her.\r<br />[/b]Her body is based on UNP, and she has clothing specific to her in a container called &#34;Vimune&#39;s Clothing Chest&#34;. To change her outfit, type &#34;Help Vimune&#34;, and then type &#34;Placeatme (id of Vimune&#39;s Clothing Chest)&#34;. You can then give Vimune her wardrobe. By default she wears vanilla college robes. [size=4]Do not comment about her outfit being skimpy. If it appears that way, then it means you have installed a modification that effects the vanilla college robes.[/size] I will not assist with this issue. Install a sensible clothing mod.\r<br />\r<br />The optional Hat plugin adds a hat for Khajiits to wear. It includes a speech bonus.\r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods:\r<br />Extensible Follower Framework\r<br />Face Light\r<br />Khajiit Speak\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />CoverKhajiit by mrLenski\r<br />Ohmes Raht textures by Nuska\r<br />Black Mage armor by lRekol\r<br />Hmm What to Wear by Nightasy\r<br />Kankaraya by KANRAx2\r<br />Construction Helmet by Haishao\r<br />HoneyVanity, for the lovely artwork of Vimune",
