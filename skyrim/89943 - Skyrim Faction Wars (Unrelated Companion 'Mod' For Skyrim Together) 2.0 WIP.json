  "summary": "Essentially in response to Skyrim Together, a series of documents that facilitate the changing of Skyrim into a First Person RTS, with the theme of Faction Wars. <br /><br />Skyrim Together + Mods like Pocket Empire Builder, AFT and Flintlock Rifles = Unprecedented gameplay.<br /><br />Given that these are documents, this will be updated fairly reg",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1166258056]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1166258056[/url]﻿    (The Steam Guide version that is more up to date) (The Nexus version will focus on the updated mod lists and faction definitions until they both share each others level of progress)\n<br />[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Recent additions:\n<br />\n<br />3/12/2018:\n<br />\n<br />No longer will individuals have to personally train their units. Instead they will simply pay a tribute to the tribute chest and run a .bat file to spawn them ready made. This is to prevent games that take\n<br />approximately 1020 hours to train a basic army of 20 workers, 20 combatants and 20 leaders.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Content includes:\n<br />\n<br />Faction definitions (to be administered via .bat files and TESV EDIT)\n<br />Gameplay rules\n<br />Variations on War Mode\n<br />Mod Lists\n<br />Install instructions etc.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Examples of the content found in my documents:  (A pictures worth a thousand words, and I recommend looking at the images and imagine the different factions fighting in multiplayer to get a better understanding of this compilation idea). \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />RTS:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The Skyrim RPG dynamics are still intact. Through modding they may get changed up but the spirit remains the same. \n<br />\n<br />One notable inclusion would be the - in a sense, party system (provided via Alternate Actors).\n<br />\n<br />Each unit will have their own separate stats that pertain to their role. For example a Cook will be inefficient in anything that isn't alchemy. \n<br />\n<br />[b]\n<br />Role Playing:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[u]Water:[/u] (Finished)\n<br />\n<br />[u]Kayfabe[/u] - To keep a story alive.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Suspension Of Disbelief [/u]- To understand the limitations of the game and its mods. \n<br />\n<br />[u]Active Involvement[/u] - To be able to act outside of the games mechanics for the sake of kayfabe. \n<br />\n<br />These three ideas give way to the two dynamics of Role Playing.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u]The Honor System:[/u]\n<br />\n<br />The expectation that all players are not intentionally refusing to uphold Active Involvement. \n<br />\n<br />Playing with strangers may make this concept impossible, which is why it would be recommended that one plays with friends that can be trusted to not break the rules or alternatively play under Light Role Play rules. \n<br />\n<br />The most prominent example would be the Economy system in which created / captured towns and settlements have an upkeep cost. This requries players to have a steady source of income &amp; resources so that they may continue to use their settlements. \n<br />\n<br />The Main Quest, Civil War Quests, Guild Quests, Divines/Daedra Quests and DLC Quests of the sort are prohibited.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u]The Party System:[/u]\n<br />\n<br />As mentioned before players will get the opportunity to role play as not just the leader but every single unit in their faction.\n<br />\n<br />Different roles include infantry, settlement leaders, cooks, couriers, hunter / breeders, spies etc. \n<br />\n<br />With the Alternate Actors mod you will be able to undertake tasks pertaining a selected units role. \n<br />\n<br />For example if you play as a cook - you will be restricted to cooking and unable to take on missions. \n<br />\n<br />If you play as a spy you will be able to gather intelligence about the surrounding area, attempt to convert enemy units, assainate targets etc.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u]Light Role Play Version:[/u]\n<br />\n<br />'The Honor System' only applies to the use of Faction exclusives in which mod additions\n<br />will be marked with labels stating what Faction may use them.\n<br />\n<br />Daedra/Divines Quests are allowed.\n<br />\n<br />No need for The Party System. You only need to keep yourself alive under the conditions\n<br />listed under the 'Survival Simulator' section. [b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Survival Simulator\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Survival comes in the form of:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Food\n<br />[*]Thirst\n<br />[*]Sleep \n<br />[*]Warmth\n<br />[*]Cleanliness (+ Diseases)\n<br />[*]Security (+ Health)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />Food, Thirst and Sleep:\n<br />\n<br />Food and Drink will need to be consumed on a regular basis. Hunting and growing crops will be an important element in regards to how settlements are able to survive, no matter who you play as.\n<br />\n<br />In terms of Hunting, Breeding will be available so that a steady source of food will be able to continue to be gathered at a consistent and steady rate. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Warmth:\n<br />\n<br />Players will need to remain warm in order to stave off hypothermia. The most affected areas would be the sea and snowy climates.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Cleanliness (+ Diseases): \n<br />\n<br />Regular bathing and worshiping will be required to stave off diseases and other penalties.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Security (+ Health):\n<br />\n<br />Refers to ones ability to fend off physical attacks. Requires things like walls, weapons, guards etc. \n<br />\n<br />Health may become affected (i.e. injuries - penalties) if one is unable to properly defend themselves.\n<br />\n<br />Survival is not just a matter of being able to fend off enemies but also be able to take care of yourself and your factions populace. [b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Empire Simulator:\n<br />\n<br />[/b]If playing singleplayer - the emphasis will naturally be on roleplaying rather than winning since there is only you.\n<br />\n<br />If Skyrim Together becomes the answer to everybodies prayers then you will be able to play with other people and compete.\n<br />\n<br />After you acquire enough resources you will have the ability to go from humble beginings to a mighty empire. This comes in the form of recruiting NPC's and building settlements. \n<br />\n<br />You can form an alliance or fight all the other players by yourself. Betrayals will be allowed, so there is no team locking \n<br />[b]\n<br />\n<br />Roles:\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Each unit and character will have a set role/s (as well as a mission/s) that they can perform. They cannot deviate from their listed missions and roles.[b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Diplomacy:\n<br />\n<br />[/b]For the first in game week there is a truce between all players in order to establish ample time for them to get aclamated to the modifications and difficulty of the AI.\n<br />\n<br />After that each player faction is automatically neutral to all other parties. It will take an act of war or an act of unification for that to change.\n<br />\n<br />There is no team locking so betrayals and alliances can be formed at literally any moment beyond the first in game week.
