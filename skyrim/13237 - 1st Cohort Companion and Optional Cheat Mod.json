  "modName": "1st Cohort Companion and Optional Cheat Mod",
  "summary": "This mod adds several \\\"bodyguards\\\" at each of the vanilla houses, the Manor in Solitude houses 9 female companions.  There are also craft able God items, and craft able droppable gold coins craft able at the forge. I do plan on creating a non cheat version of this mod later.",
  "descriptionHtml": "=================================Description=====================================\r\nThis is a small .esp mod that adds body guards (they don\\'t have the god weapons or armors they have a weaker variant)  equipped with a variant of the Penitus Oculatus armor of the Legionary Praetorian, to each of the houses in the vanilla game. It also adds 9 recruit-able female companions in the Proudspire manor in Solitude that can wear any armor you give them (I set their default armor rating to 0). They are unfortunately not essential but I set them as Respawnable.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there are Cheat swords and armor craft able in game from the crafting bench. Penitus Occulatus armor God variants are craft able at the forge, and free gold coins/ ingot variants are also craft able at the forge.. ( i made gold coin variants just to have the ability to drop them and look at bling bling :D )\r\n\r\n==============================Versions and Features===============================\r\nV1.0 Companion & Cheat Mod\r\n-Adds \\\"bodyguards\\\" to every vanilla player owned house in Skyrim.\r\n-Craft able God Weapons and armor (Penitus Variants) (No items needed to Craft)\r\n-9 Functioning Followers at solitude Proud spire Manor\r\n-Craft able Droppable Gold Coins (No items needed to Craft)\r\n-Craft able God Arrows (No items needed to Craft)\r\n-Bodyguards and Companions set to Respawn (not tested)\r\n\r\nV1.0 Companion Mod\r\n-Adds \\\"bodyguards\\\" to every vanilla player owned house in Skyrim.\r\n-Craft able Weapons and armor (Penitus Variants) \r\n-9 Functioning Followers at solitude Proud spire Manor\r\n-Craft able Droppable Gold Coins Works Vice Versa\r\n-Craft able God Arrows Requires Firewood\r\n-Bodyguards and Companions set to Respawn (not tested)\r\n\r\n=================================Disclaimer======================================\r\nI am not responsible if this mod corrupts your saves or breaks your game.
