People who block will wreck you if you hit them while they are blocking and you don\\\\\\'t have defense. I have learned a few more things about creation kit and i will tweak some things hopefully. Also it might be craft-able under glass. \r\n\r\nOh and let me know if it doesnt work. Steam is easy mode for uploads in comparison.",
