She is an NPC who uses her own fighting style and has her own class of combat. You can find her just outside of Whiterun, to the west, into the clearing where the stream flows and there are crabs, near the camp of giants.\r<br />Now she is leveled 2.5x the player level, much powerful you are and more mana she gain and more powers she will have.  To be sure to have her properly leveled start the mod with a game saved in an interior cell. If you do not see her is perhaps because she is made invisible; she will find you&#33; Have fun fighting with her. \r<br />Feel free to insert her in your quest but ask permisson to Lustrianna to use the armor. Let me know where you used her.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=orange][b]Magic:[/b] What can she do?[/color][/size]\r<br />[u]Weak shock wave[/u] - Unbalances the opponent.
