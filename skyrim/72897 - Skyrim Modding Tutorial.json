  "summary": "A tutorial on how to mod your Skyrim with NMM in unobtrusive ways that make sense. How Skyrim should have shipped.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my personal version of an &#34;unofficial patch&#34;, this is how I believe Skyrim should have shipped in the first place. I started on it before I found out about STEP, and still find it easier to use, so I continued with it.\r<br />\r<br />If you like a modded game which stays immersive and lore-friendly, but don&#39;t want to pore over thousands of mods to figure out how to combine them, this is for you. For example, our magic mods do not add a ton of new spells, they only fix and balance existing spells.\r<br />\r<br />I actually made this tutorial for myself in case I ever need to reinstall, which came in handy when NMM updated and required all mods to be reinstalled.\r<br />\r<br />You should definitely start this process with a brand new save file, especially if you have any mods already installed. A fresh install with all old files deleted might benefit you if you were suffering from crashes, installed some things manually and don&#39;t remember what they were, or have any similar problems.\r<br />\r<br />There are 3 separate .txt files within the .rar:\r<br />\r<br />1. [b][u]Skyrim Mods[/u][/b] - The main overview of the process of editing your .inis, cleaning the game&#39;s Masters with TES5Edit, downloading your mods with NMM, and sorting them with LOOT + some manual work.\r<br />\r<br />2. [b][u]MCM[/u][/b] - A guide on what MCM settings to use once you start up the game. This can be just as long of a process without knowing what you&#39;re doing. If I didn&#39;t mention something then you can leave it alone.\r<br />\r<br />3. [b][u]Skyrim Alchemy[/u][/b] - My somewhat unrelated personal notes on good potions to make. I chose ingredients which &#34;made sense&#34; in addition to a powerful effect. So you will be using poisonous mushrooms and Deathbell on your poison instead of just dragonflies etc. Useful to know what to look out for - you won&#39;t have to fill your bags with Mora Tapinella in case you will need it later. And your character will feel like he knows what he&#39;s doing&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Thank you so much to all of the amazing mod authors that made the mods in this tutorial, TES5Edit, LOOT, and of course NMM.\r<br />\r<br />Links for the above mentioned programs:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/?]TES5Edit[/url]\r<br />[url=https://loot.github.io/]LOOT[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager/?]NMM[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Shameless plug for my own contribution:Â [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72417/?]Worthwhile Torches\r<br />\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.twitch.tv/jailbar]Come check me out on Twitch, I play mostly Hearthstone and Skyrim[/url]",
