  "descriptionHtml": "[quote]\\\"I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. \r\n\r\nYou may have heard of me. \\\"[/quote]\r\n--from [i]The Name of the Wind[/i] by Patrick Rothfuss\r\n\r\n[size=15]Kvothe[/size]\r\n\r\n=====UPDATE=====\r\nSlightly tweaked visually so he doesn\\'t look like a 35-year-old anymore.\r\nFor best results, use:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2332]Final Younger Characters by Toshiki[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2464]Bright Eyes by Skree000[/url]\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at building a new character. I love The Name of the Wind and wanted to recreate Kvothe as closely as possible. I\\'ve focused mainly on the build and items, leaving you to decide how he should look with other mods. I may play around a bit later to get him closer to the description in the book.\r\nI\\'ve started Kvothe near the the end of book 2, after leaving Ademre and before returning to the University. The main quest is disabled, and you start just outside Riverwood at level 15 (Kvothe\\'s approximate age).\r\nHe has his sword, Caesura, and a few other items mentioned in the second book. They\\'ve all been enchanted fairly nicely. You also start with a nice amount of gold (from the Maer\\'s lockbox) and a good amount of lockpicks. \r\nKvothe has a decently balanced perk set. Speechcraft, Sneak, and Lockpicking are from his time with the troope and Tarbean. Restoration and Destruction are the closest equivalents to skills from Medica and Sympathy. Training in One-handed is from the Adem. I\\'ve also tweaked unarmed damage; Kvothe should do a little more damage than an unarmed Khajit.\r\nI\\'ve tried to keep it as realistically balanced as possible for combat. Kvothe shouldn\\'t have any problems with a single bandit, but a group of them is likely to pose a problem. \r\n\r\n[size=5]This is a W.I.P. and I am terrible at modding items. If anyone would like to help, please let me know.[/size]\r\nI\\'d like to get the book \\\"Rhetoric and Logic\\\" into his inventory. \r\nHelp with the shaed (his cloak made of shadows) would also be MUCH appreciated.\r\nI can\\'t seem to find short, spiky, bright red hair. [quote]\\\"I keep it short but it\\'s unruly. When left to its own devices, it sticks up and makes me look as if I have been set afire.\\\"[/quote]\r\nPlease help if you can!",
