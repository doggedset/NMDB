  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][color=#6060c0]Details\r\n======[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nA letter found in The Ragged Flagon will lead you on a 6-part Radiant Story quest to find the 5 pieces of armour and weapon set.  Everything is Glass equipment.\r\n\r\nBow - Frenzy and Soul Trap Enchantments\r\nHelm - Toggable Nightvision (A lesser power added by a script, with a n enchantment on the helm just for the sake of adding a name for the enchantment)\r\nArmour - Carry Capacity increase\r\nGauntlets - Lockpicking and Pickpocket bonus\r\nBoots - Muffles\r\nShield - Resist Magic\r\n\r\nSince Radiant story does all the locations I can\\'t actually tell you where it\\'ll all be.\r\n\r\nUpdate:  Working on Heavy version, using the Draugr armour as a base for it.  Feedback is much appreciated.\r\n\r\n[url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1383499-rel-shadowgear/page__p__20976459#entry20976459]Bethesda forums Page[/url]  <-- For my convenience\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n[size=4][color=#6060c0]Credits\r\n=======[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nVohcaz - Allowing me to use his Glass retexture: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5157]Black and Blue Glass Armour[/url]\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n[size=4][color=#6060c0]Bugfixes\r\n========[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n**08/09/12**\r\n\r\nFound a weird bug, if you find the Bow before the other pieces then the quest will complete.  The other pieces will still be out there, you just won\\'t have a convienent map marker to take you there :(  Quick fix for this - use the console with \\\"Resetquest SGQuest\\\" then \\\"Setstage SGQuest XX\\\" where XX is the quest stage for what you were looking for before.\r\n\r\nQuest Stages:\r\n\r\n10 - Gauntlets\r\n20 - Boots\r\n30 - Shield\r\n40 - Helm\r\n50 - Armour\r\n60 - Bow\r\n\r\n\r\n**02/07/12**\r\n\r\nIf for some reason the quest won\\'t start when you read the note then type into the console \\\"SetStage SGQuest 10\\\" which should kick-start the quest.",
