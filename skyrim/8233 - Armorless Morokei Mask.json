  "summary": "A small tweak to change Morokei from light armor to clothing for the sake of the \\\"mage armor\\\" perk.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nWhen I first got Morokei I was pretty bummed out that it was light armor because of the fact that it messes with the mage armor perk. But seeing as how it is such a good item for mages I decided to make this little mod which removes the armor from Morokei. I doubt that there will be much of a demand for this, but just to be a bro I decided to upload it anyway :D\r\n\r\nTo install just throw it in your steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data folder.\r\n\r\nThis is my very first mod so if you found this helpful please endorse.",
