  "descriptionHtml": "I was in the midst of goofing around and thought it&#39;d be cool to outfit every Imperial soldier in full Daedric armor. So I started doing it. Then realized &#34;This is taking too damn long..&#34; and wrote BAT files for instantly outfitting a soldier with full Daedric armor and a choice of weapon. At the moment I have Full Daedric sets in Sword/Shield, Greatsword, Battleaxe, and Warhammer variants. \r<br />\r<br />If people want more variety, and different armor sets, let me know and I&#39;ll get them written and posted. If there are any bugs let me know as well, though there shouldn&#39;t be. I also have separate files for equipping full Daedric to the player, also included in the RAR file. All you need to do is extract the files into your main &#92;Skyrim directory. \r<br />\r<br />When in-game, open the console and type in bat [BAT Filename] without the brackets. Ex: bat DaedricWH will equip a full set of Daedric armor and a Daedric Warhammer. \r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT: You must have the NPC you wish to equip the armor to selected while in the console, or it will not work. For the Player BAT files, you do not. All player BAT files have the PC prefix, while NPC BAT&#39;s do not. \r<br />\r<br />&#34;PsychoticSwag, you said 5:00 E.S.T.&#33; That was last week&#33;&#34; \r<br />Yep. It was last week. I&#39;m very sorry about the delay. It IS a little past 5PM Friday ^_^ Hehe I had some health issues, but I finally got the stuff done ^_^ Please forgive me ^_^; I&#39;m going to work on the DLC armors now. I&#39;ll really try to get them done [i]on schedule[/i] this time. I&#39;m really sorry again. Hope these are good. \r<br />\r<br />NOTE: I haven&#39;t gotten the player files done yet. I&#39;m still trying to figure out an efficient way to get these done. Right now I&#39;m trying to use Microsoft Word to make a large group of codes, then copy them to Notepad one by one, but I have to edit each group before I do. I&#39;m slow, I&#39;m sorry ^_^ I&#39;m still trying :)",
