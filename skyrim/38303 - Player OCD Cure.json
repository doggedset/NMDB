I made this\r<br />mod because I cannot seem to get through content very quickly because of my compulsive need to stop and pick up every item that&#39;s not nailed to the floor.\r<br />*END DISCLAIMER*\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/sILLBsK.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />------------------------------\r<br />Uninstallation Note: \r<br />\r<br />As this mod DOES include scripts (which get baked into save files), it is not advised or safe to\r<br />uninstall this mod in the middle of a playthrough. If you must uninstall it, I highly recommend reverting to a save\r<br />point from before you installed this mod.\r<br />------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />The spell will be added to you list the first time you load up the game with this mod enabled. It is listed under\r<br />the lesser powers tab and is called &#34;OCD Cure&#34;. You may enable and disable item picked and activation at will using this\r<br />spell, which opens a menu that lets you choose your option.\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------------\r<br />In Case Of Unforeseen Errors:\r<br />\r<br />If for some reason you cannot re-enable pickup and activation, open the console in-game with \r<br />the ` key (to the left of the non-numbpad 1) and type in &#34;player.enableplayercontrols&#34; without the quotes.\r<br />----------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />*IMPORTANT NOTE*\r<br />It is important to note that anything that makes use of either the enableplayercontrols or disableplayercontrols commands\r<br />will reset the functionality of this mod (an example being shifting in and out of werewolf form). When this happens,\r<br />simply reset the system by first using the menu to select &#34;Enable&#34;, then using it to select &#34;Disable&#34;. this will ensure\r<br />that all the settings for the different kinds of player control flags are propperly set up for this mod.\r<br />*END IMPORTANT NOTE*\r<br />\r<br />-----------\r<br />Credits:\r<br />-----------\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda for Skyrim\r<br />My parents for my AMAZING genetics\r<br />\r<br />-----------------\r<br />Final Notes:\r<br />------------------\r<br />I hope you enjoy this&#33;\r<br />\r<br />-UlithiumDragon",
