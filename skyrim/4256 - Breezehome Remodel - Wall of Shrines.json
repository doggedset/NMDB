  "descriptionHtml": "Wall of Shrines\r\nAdd shrines for each of the divine nine to the dining room of Whiterun\\'s Breezhome player purchasable house, so you can get your preferred blessing before leaving home!\r\n\r\nSee the wiki on Blessings: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Blessings\r\n\r\nYou can use this to make custom changes for each of your characters, and their homes will stay as you create them even when this mod is no longer needed or running.\r\n\r\nThis mod is self contained, and does not require an outside script-engine for use.\r\n\r\nYou do not need Auto-Hotkey to use this mod--simply run the executable file from the download. But, this mod was made by and for Auto-Hotkey, and there is also a standard text-file script for folks who do already use this phenomenally useful utility.\r\n\r\nThis mod requires a certain ceramic pot from the default furnishings still be present in the Breezehome location. If you have removed the right side pot from the table under the weapon plaque in the loft, then you will need to reset the interior of Breezehome to use this mod. Instructions for this follow the general use instructions.\r\n\r\nPLEASE MAKE A NAMED-FILE SAVE OF YOUR GAME BEFORE ATTEMPTING THESE CHANGES. You have been warned, in ALL CAPS!\r\nThis script floods commands to the Skyrim console, keystroke by keystroke. It usually works, but can easily get off track, so SAVE A BACKUP FIRST.\r\n\r\nUsing the Breezhome Shrine-Wall Script for Auto-Hotkey\r\n1. Start the script using either the executable or text-file.\r\n2. In game, enter the Breezehome location.\r\n3. With the console closed (unopened), type the keystroke [Ctrl+Shift+W]\r\n4. Wait for the script to complete, then quicksave and quickload the game to finalize the requested modifications.\r\n5. Exit the running script. You don\\'t need it anymore.\r\n\t\r\n***\r\nInstructions for resetting the interior of Breezehome\r\n\r\nMust Be Done If You Ever Took a Certain Pot Out of the Loft of Breezehome.\r\n\r\nThis will reset the furniture and items in the home. Some containers are reset too!\r\n\r\nGather all your items into your personal inventory before going outside and making the reset or they may be LOST FOREVER\r\nAgain, must be done unless you just now bought the house or are super-double-sure the pot (ID: cb4ab) on the right side of the table under the weapon rack in the upstairs loft still exists.\r\n1) Exit the home. Stand out in the street.\r\n2) Open the console (tilde key) and enter this command line without quotations:\r\n\\\"resetinterior WhiterunBreezehome\\\" (hit Enter)\r\n3) Close the console, quicksave and quickload to effect the requested changes\r\n4) Re-enter the house and add your new furniture!\r\n\r\n",
