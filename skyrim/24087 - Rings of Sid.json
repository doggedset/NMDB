  "descriptionHtml": "Two rings: One will make you nearly invincible via quick regeneration, invulnerable to falls and drowning, punch harder, make stronger potions, sneakier, stronger, and shout more frequently. I suppose you could still die if you get swarmed by the right opposition.\r\n\r\nThe other ring makes you near immortal along with paralyzing you because that\\'s what TRAPS do. Try to plant it on other people to see if it\\'ll do something, I haven\\'t tried. Don\\'t worry, you can still access your menu just fine after being paralyzed. It\\'s more of a joke ring.\r\n\r\nNOW there are 5 rings of crafting that amplify smithing and enchanting (3k, 4k, 6.6k, 6.7k, and 9.1k). I just got tired of using the console to make these rings for crafting 1-3 hit killing weapons.\r\n\r\nThey are at the INN in RIVERWOOD. You have to steal it from behind the counter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation...Just throw the esp in your Skyrim \\\"data\\\" folder and activate it by NMM, Wyre Bash, or the Skyrim launcher.\r\n\r\nIf there are any issues, tell me. Apparently the trap ring stops paralyzing after frequent use. I\\'ll look into it once I get a break from classes...which are starting tomorrow-FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!",
