  "descriptionHtml": "Dark brotherhood Additions.\r\n\r\nThis mod basically adds a few more things to do in the guild after you complete the dark brotherhood main quest. As it stands it adds three new NPC\\'s to the guild, and gives you some more privilages that you would expect to obtain if you were the listener. \r\n\r\nHow to enable the mod once in game:\r\nAfter you have killed the emperor and turned in the quest with Nazir, you can ask him about recruiting even more members, once you do that the mod will be activated.\r\n\r\n - Rachel will be in the dinning hall.\r\n - Rasqaar will be on the lower level where you can purchase nessesary wares from him.\r\n - Torag will be on the upper level near the garden of plants.\r\n\r\nWhen you send off a member to kidnap someone, they are usually take a few hours to complete their task, once they do, they will wait in the torture chamber with the captive untill further instruction. Currently if you kill a captive a certain member retireved and then asked them to retrieve another, they wont do so untill the corpse of the dead captive dissapears and respawns in the world.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, all of the new NPC\\'s arent essential and do not respawn for added realism.\r\n\r\nI intend to add more to the mod so there will be more versions over the next few days. I realise that it may not be 100% bug free as of now, but it has been tested extensively and would ask that you let me know if you come across any bugs that I may have missed.\r\n\r\nThis mod is actually an addition to my other mod The Dark Brotherhood Merchant which is included in this one so there is no need to download it. If you alredy have it however, simply replace it with this version.\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n\r\nMy other mods:\r\nMercenary Company: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29560\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
