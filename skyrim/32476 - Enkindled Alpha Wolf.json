  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds the Enkindled Alpha Wolf animal follower.  Be sure and check out the new video [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW_19T61J_w&feature=youtu.be]here![/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n*-*Requires No DLC*-* \r\n*-*Works with Dawnguard DLC*-*\r\n*-*Works with Hearthfire DLC*-*\r\n*-*Works with Dragonborn DLC*-*\r\n\r\nThere is a new breed of wolf in the land of Skyrim. The Enkindled Wolf. \r\n\r\nThe Enkindled Wolves have been spotted in the cliffs south of Whiterun. They have taken up residence in a large cave along the river now being referred to as the Enkindled Wolf Den. \r\n\r\nLegend has it that if an adventurer is strong enough to destroy the pack, the pack\\'s Alpha will follow their command. \r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Other Information[/b][/u] \r\n\r\nThe Enkindled Wolf Den Can be found north of Riverwood along the river and South of Whiterun (see images).\r\n\r\nDefeat the pack of Enkindled Wolves and make your way inside. There you will find the Enkindled Alpha Wolf. Once his pack has been defeated he will follow you. \r\n\r\nThe Enkindled Alpha Wolf will fight for you and is essential so he cannot die. If sent away he will return to his location inside the Enkindled Wolf Den. \r\n\r\nThe Enkindled Alpha Wolf has attacks similar to a Flame Atronach and will burn near by enemies. \r\n\r\nThis follower works in the same way as \\\"Stray Dogs\\\". Activate once and the Enkindled Alpha Wolf will begin following you. Activate again for Follow/Wait/Dismiss options. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Known Bug** Sometimes after combat Enkindled Alpha Wolf will not speak when activated. Fast travel to resolve this issue. \r\n\r\n \r\n[b][u]Version Information[/b][/u] \r\n\r\nBeta - Please report any bugs!",
