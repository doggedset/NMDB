The overall result is that your character starts taking damage after about 35 seconds and takes more time to die. \r\n\r\nI thought that the default breath hold time before dying of oxygen deprivation in skyrim was pretty weak. Most people can hold their breath and maintain consciousness longer than that. Therefore I just tweaked it a bit. I tried to make it balanced.\r\n\r\nI didn\\'t see any other mods out there that does this so I thought I would upload this.\r\nEnjoy!",
