(you will no doubt instantly recognize that as the year that the Salem Witch Trials began)\r\nlocation: Salem \r\nFighting Style: Hapkido Cane Fighting / alchemy\r\nknow spells/powers  turns you to stone\r\n\r\nBio in Brief: After failing at being a blacksmith, drastically, Xavier turned to his original love: science.  He began experimenting with alchemy and rather than finding a way to turn lead into gold he discovered a way to create a source of cheap, clean-burning energy.  This discovery also fundamentally changed him giving him some powers which seemed like magic, but were completely scientific (the instruction manual claimed).  Unfortunately the people of Salem didn't like hippies back then any more than they liked witches and he was seized and (burned at the stake) for being a warlock before he could reveal his OPEC wrecking secrets to the world.\r\n.....................................................................................\r\n\r\n\r\nmods need it for this to work\r\n\r\n  Grim Reaper Hoods mod (for the hood)\r\n\r\n http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22296\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n install \r\n\r\n  \r\n  install  Grim Reaper Hoods mod\r\n  install  Xavier Pendragon+robes just drop date \r\n  install  his staff pick one thin drop date\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ((if you us  Staves of Skyrim mod theres a staff for you to))\r\n...................................................................................\r\n\r\ncredit\r\n\r\n (Kempalot) for the Grim Reaper Hoods mod with out it the hoods won't be what tha are\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n..........................................................................................\r\nmy other mods\r\nthe krull Glaive http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31315/\r\nflyable Magic Carpet http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31304/\r\nbroom textures http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30822/\r\n\r\n..........................................................................................\r\nsum info\r\n\r\ngrim reaper scythe is frum  Moar Kontent mod\r\n Staves of Skyrim mod   thier here  (bridge) to the  College in Winterhold\r\n\r\n\r\n    sume codes\r\n\r\n robe_variant2. code 0010d67e or 0010cee3\r\n Dragon Priest Staff.
