  "descriptionHtml": "[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/hXQSy.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />==Description==\r<br />A small mod which allows you to ask a bard to take a break when he or she is playing a song.\r<br />If the bard is not performing, you will not see the option to ask for the bard to take a break.\r<br />\r<br />==What does it do?==\r<br />This mod utilizes existing functionality made by Bethesda. In the vanilla game, you could ask bards to take a break if they played the 3 drinking songs, but if they were simply playing an instrumental song, you did not have the option to ask them to take a break. In addition, the request for them to take a break was hidden inside the &#34;Can I make a request?&#34; branch, making it a little known feature. This mod makes the &#34;Can you take a break?&#34; request a top level branch and makes it appear if the bard is performing any song, including instrumentals (exception being the wedding songs).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />==Compatibility==\r<br />Should work with all bards, including custom bards.\r<br />\r<br />==Incompatibility==\r<br />None known.\r<br />\r<br />==Steam==\r<br />Also available in the Steam Workshop -Â http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=356565346",
