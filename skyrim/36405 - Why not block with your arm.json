The main reason is that i have seen a couple of this type of mods available on the nexus and they either don\\'t have crafting or there is no alternate version.\r\n\r\nThis has crafting so they can be made at the forage. and then they can be tempered at the workbench, there is no crafting requirements for this so you can make this when ever you like, as long as you have the materials.\r\n\r\nOk so this is what i have made the shields like.\r\n\r\nLight:\r\nHide based shield:\r\nbase armor rating of 16 1 pt over hide.\r\nIron ingot\r\nLeather\r\n\r\nGlass based shield:\r\nbase armor rating of 27\r\nMalachite ingot\r\nLeather \r\n\r\nHeavy:\r\nSteel based shield:\r\nbase armor rating of 24\r\nSteel ingot\r\nLeather\r\n\r\nDaedric based shield:\r\nbase armor rating of 36\r\nEbony ingot\r\nLeather\r\n\r\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgMl-iZ3tZM]XD would be funny if i could make a right handed shield[/url]",
