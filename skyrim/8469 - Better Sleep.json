  "summary": "Adds some incentives to sleep more often. Also allows werewolves to gain the benefits of sleep via a perk in the Dawnguard Werewolf perk tree.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds some more incentives to hit the sack and catch up on some lost sleep. You get better benefits from better grades of sleep, so you can catch a light nap in the woods just to keep up and then sleep soundly in the embrace of your loved one when you get home. In addition, by sleeping often, you can extend your Well Rested state for up to two days, even if you sleep outside. More details [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/557639-better-sleep/page__view__findpost__p__4877223]here.[/url]\r\n\r\nThis mod does NOT change the bonus gained from the Lover\\'s Stone. Like in vanilla Skyrim, accepting the Lover\\'s Stone bonus will prevent you from receiving the skill XP boosts from sleep, but all other bonuses will be conferred.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a faster comprehension of the nuances of their trade, a rested Dovahkiin boasts slightly better recovery from wounds, less magic wastage with spells, less fatigue from those big swings, and more strength for carrying around their knickknacks. People will often notice how fresh you are and are more likely to offer better prices... including for the things they might not really want to do. In addition, an alert Dovahkiin will find that their knack for crawling unheard and blending with the shadows is just that little bit better. Of course, these effects only last eight hours, so look for beds around Skyrim to keep at your peak.\r\n\r\nWerewolves can also now gain the benefits of sleep, via a perk in the werewolf perk tree once Dawnguard is installed.\r\n\r\nYour home is your stronghold, a safe haven. All the worries of being the Dragonborn, like dragons, bandits, your morgatage, and that irritating civil war will be put of your mind when you rest at your house... and, of course, you can then put that clear head to greater use. Enchanting, tempering, and alchemy will all improved for two hours after you sleep in a house that you own. Don\\'t worry, you\\'ll be notified when this effect fades, so you don\\'t accidentally foul up the enchantment on your favourite piece of armor.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod, so if you can spare the time to leave detailed feedback, please do.\r\n\r\nFull Effect List - Rested, Well Rested, Lover\\'s Comfort\r\n\r\nSkill experience: +5%, +10%, +15% - as in Skynilla\r\nHealth regen over time: +20%, +40%, +60%\r\nSpell Cost: -5%, -10%, -15%\r\nPower Attack Cost: -10%, -20%, -30%\r\nIncreased Encumbrance: +15%, +30%, +50%\r\nSneak buff: +5%, +10%, +15% to stat (should only affect detection)\r\nBuy Prices: -3%, -6%, -10%\r\nSell Prices: +3%, +6%, +10%\r\nBribes: -5%, -10%, -15%\r\n\r\nIf you prefer, you can check out the mod in the Steam workshop [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=9056]here[/url] - however, it does not have the Dawnguard werewolf restedness perk just yet.",
