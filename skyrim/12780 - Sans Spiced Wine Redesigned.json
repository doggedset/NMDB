  "descriptionHtml": "===== San\\'s Spiced Wine Redesigned =====\r\nmade by HitokiriGensai\r\n\r\nThis is a retexture of San\\'s Spiced Wine. To me, the original looked pretty uninspired, so I did a quick design of my own. The resolution is still the same, so it\\'s not technically HD, but I did add some detail to the normal map.\r\n\r\n===== Installation\r\nExtract \\'Textures\\' folder into Skyrim\\\\Data, click \\'yes\\' to overwrite and/or merge folders.\r\n\r\n===== Uninstallation\r\nDelete files \\\"sanspicedwine.dds\\\" and \\\"sanspicedwine_n.dds\\\" in the Data\\\\textures\\\\clutter\\\\wine folder.\r\n\r\n===== Conflicts\r\nNone. This only replaces the San\\'s Spice Wine label texture, not the wine bottle texture, so it\\'s compatible with mods that improve the appearance of the bottles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is officially my first uploaded mod. Give me any feedback you might have!\r\n\r\nArtwork by HitokiriGensai\r\nThanks to Bethesda",
