  "descriptionHtml": "Firstly, it is important that you ACTIVATE THIS MOD AT STAGE 7 OF Rise in the East&#33; Otherwise, the battle will occur beforehand.\r<br />\r<br />Now, why was it that you were sent alone to assault Japhet&#39;s Folly? Didn&#39;t they know your survival chance would be 2 to 1? Well, now its different&#33;\r<br />\r<br />A small landing force consisting of 10 men will assist you (or distract the enemies, depending on how you approach the quest stage) in the assault on Japhet&#39;s Folly. But be careful, eight Blood Horkers will be dispatched to rid the island of the Mercenaries, so act fast or they may be overwhelmed&#33;\r<br />\r<br />And don&#39;t worry, when you leave the Mercenaries will find their way off the Island. Unless their dead.",
