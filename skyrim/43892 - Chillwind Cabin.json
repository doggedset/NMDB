I don\\'t know why they keep being popular after all this time but hey, it\\'s always fun to discover a new location or a new place to rest. \r\nSo, what\\'s new with this mod? Not much, but it rests in a beautiful  little rock formation in the mountains and it has a little lake on the side. And guess what? No load doors! It is not a full house mod with everything you need as a Dragonborn but it is the perfect house to stop by and retire after an hard quest to save the world. There are two versions available for the cabin :\r\n\r\n[color=#DB7900]Crafting:[/color] It has everything a good Dragonborn needs to live his adventurous life including some storage, a crafting, enchanting and alchemy station, a bed, a cooking pot and more. Made for those who want a complete house.\r\n\r\n[color=#DB7900]Basic:[/color] It is a more basic version of the cabin to give it a more authentic and cosy feeling. Made for those who want a more simple yet interesting house to stop by during your journey throughout Skyrim.\r\n\r\n[color=#DB7900]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[b]A LITTLE BIT OF LORE[/b]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/color]\r\nIlvan was a simple man who always loved nature. He grew up as an orphan from Riften and he always wanted to live free by building his own house out there in the nature. At the age of 9, he managed to run away from Greylod the Kind and left Riften. From that moment until he was 34 years old, he lived by doing all sorts of little jobs in the main cities of Skyrim. During this life, he always tried to save some money to build his little cabin in the wild. \r\nSo, at the age of 34, he finally had enough gold to buy a little land and some basic material to start the construction of his house. During 2 years, he worked on it until it was as perfect as he wanted. He then lived there many happy and peaceful year until one day…\r\nIt was the beginning of the First Seed, flowers were growing nicely, fish were following the ascendance of rivers and nature was beautiful as always. Among these fish, there were a lot of salmons but also some darker and more dangerous fish...slaughterfish. \r\nThat day, the temperature was hot and Ilvan decided to go swimming in his lake. At that moment, some slaughterfish were following a river and ended up in a lake, Ilvan\\'s lake. Everything happened too fast for Ilvan who was getting old at that time and they killed him in less than a minute. After an hour, almost nothing was left of him and the rest of his body went down the river and went lost in the waters of Skyrim. And the fish? They just turned around and continued their way through the rivers of Skyrim.\r\nNow the house is all alone, with no owner to take care of it until someone finds it...\r\n\r\n[color=#DB7900]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[b]LOCATION[/b]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/color]\r\nSo, you want to know where to get it? If you just want some hints, follow these instructions : From the big stone bridge of an ancient time, head south east and follow the road until you find a river. Then, follow that river to thsouth until you find a small boat next to an extinguished fire. From that fire, follow the raod that goes up in the mountain and you shall find what you seek.\r\nIf you just want a straight answer, there is a picture of the map in the image section.\r\n\r\n[color=#DB7900]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[b]FUTURE PLANS[/b]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/color]\r\nThere aren\\'t any future plans for this mod because it is all done but I will try to fix any issues and bugs if there are any so don\\'t hesitate to tell me if you encounter an issue with this mod. \r\n\r\n[color=#DB7900]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[b]INSTALLATION[/b]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/color] \r\nTo install this mod you have two options:\r\n1)\tYou can use the NMM by simply downloading it and then click “DOWNLOAD WITH MANAGER”\r\n2)\tOr you can download it manually by clicking “Download manually” and then extract the data file and copy it into the Skyrim folder normaly located under Steam/SteamApps/common\r\n\r\n[color=#DB7900]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[b]UNINSTALL[/b]\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/color]\r\nYou just have to make the inverse process of the installation.
