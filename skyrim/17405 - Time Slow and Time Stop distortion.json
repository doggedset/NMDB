  "descriptionHtml": "This is a modification of nagarian78\\'s effect-less Time Slow and Time Stop ring mods, in his \\\"Time Stop With A Ring\\\" mod page. I was very happy to see someone get rid of that bright hue associated with the Slow Time effect, but when I tried the two mods out, I felt that something was missing. The mechanics behind it worked flawlessly for me, but the aesthetics seemed lacking. I needed a way to immerse myself more with the concept of slowing down and stopping time, so I went ahead and did what I could to achieve that. I\\'ve simply included the wavy screen distortion effect that plays when you use the Slow Time shout, while still leaving out that bright hue that\\'s associated with it.\r\n\r\nI decided to post this up to make it easier for people that desire the same aesthetics without having the hassle of fiddling with the creation kit. Just load the mod and play.\r\n\r\nThis is only an aesthetic change. No gameplay mechanics were modified. Any questions about how to get the mod working should probably be asked at nagarian78\\'s \\\"Time Stop With A Ring\\\" page. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9228\r\n\r\nA big thanks as well to Kthanecraft and nagarian78 for the initial work. It helped me learn quite a bit about how the Creation Kit functions.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHere\\'s a brief explanation about obtaining the rings: \r\nThese rings have been made craftable from any forge in Skyrim. Crafting each ring requires 10 silver ingots.",
