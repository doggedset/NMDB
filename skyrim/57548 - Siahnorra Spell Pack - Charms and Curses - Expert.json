Concentration spell, if you don&#39;t hit a target with magicka it will cost you magicka to keep up the spell.\r<br />Osmosis Link - Link up with your allies or enemies and absorb their magical aura. Great for followers that aren&#39;t mages. Fire and forget spell, lasts 10 seconds. Also this is not hostile.\r<br />Dark Invigoration - Siphon the life force out of your enemy to fuel your spells. Fire and forget spell, not meant for hardcore damage, just mild as it converts their health into magicka. This is a destruction spell, while the other 2 are alteration spells.\r<br />Disarm - The ability to disarm an &#34;armed&#34; opponent (meaning in their hand) without the shout, because less face it, a mage should be able to do this to their enemies, considering naming this &#34;expeliarmus&#34; any upvotes?\r<br />Suffocate - A new illusion spell that allows you to cause your opponent to choke, and stumble about while fleeing combat to catch their breath, it damages them over time.\r<br />Time Ward- (yes I am a Who fan) A new ward spell that allows you to summon a ward for 10 seconds, instead of holding it on. Allows longer time if dual casted, and allows to dual cast spells while ward is up.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;d like to try and keep the spells balanced, I&#39;m not into being OP. I mean I do believe a mage should feel powerful, but nothing like &#34;lets go\r<br /> kill that big bad boss in 2 hits.&#34; So your feedback is VERY welcome, \r<br />tell me if i should strengthen or weaken any aspect, THANKS.\r<br />\r<br />Please feel free to upload your screenshots of when and where you use the spells. But try to keep this as spoiler free as possible&#33; I&#39;ll be uploading new screens of the spells soon.\r<br />\r<br />There are no requirements to download this, just install and play&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Thanks for downloading and the feedback&#33; Hopefully I think of more somewhat unique spells. \r<br />\r<br />HELP WANTED:\r<br />Hey if anyone can make special visual effects to go along with my spells, because I lack the knowledge, I&#39;d greatly appreciate it, PLEASE get in touch with me&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits: \r<br />Bethesda \r<br />My Mom and Dad for creating me. \r<br />BestInSlot for teaching me to not be stupid. \r<br />All the awesome modders who create spells and mods that I use day in and day out.",
