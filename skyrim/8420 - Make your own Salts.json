  "summary": "A small mod that allows you to craft Salt piles using Void, Fire and Frost salts.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Using your cooking pot, you can now turn Void, Frost and Fire salts into regular Salt pile.\r\n\r\n1.1 Edit: \r\nIncreased salt gain.\r\nRecipes wont show up unless you have frost/fire/void salts in your inventory.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really enjoy cooking in Skyrim, but it can be a little hard to find enough salt for all your culinary needs, so i decided to create this small mod to convert special salts for those that you can use in cooking. Obviously, if you use any mods that remove salt requirement from cooking, this mod isn\\'t really useful for you.\r\n\r\nVoid salts give you 20 regular salt,\r\nFrost salts give 15,\r\nFire salts give 10.\r\n\r\nThree recipes are in the \\\"Misc\\\" category of the cooking pot.\r\n\r\nConflicts: None, unless you use any mods that modify item id of any salts.
