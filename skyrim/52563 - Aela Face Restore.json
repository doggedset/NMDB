  "descriptionHtml": "Aela the Huntress face fix to restore the Default face.  To Unbake the her black head pale boby.\r<br />this is not a mod but still very easy. Start the cs check skyrim.ems and update.ems and you select her from actors, Hit (ctr + f4) you get her face back,No saves required. This IS the Original FACE so there a red tattoo warpaint. \r<br />\r<br />It works because the saves and mods have nothing to do with the error.Its a bug with how skyrim handles nif and dds files. Now you can try other mods to alter her to your liking. \r<br />\r<br />if I was less lazy I would make mod that would restore all the games default FaceTints in c:SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimDatatexturesactorscharacterFaceGenDataFaceTint\r<br />\r<br />Or maybe some brave soul will create a skse plugin to add the equivalent of bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=1 to the game fallout has it Skyrim dose not. \r<br />But for now here your fix. I might get ambitious I do something butt like I said this is very easy.",
