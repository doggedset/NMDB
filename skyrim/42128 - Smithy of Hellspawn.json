  "descriptionHtml": "Do you like smithing?  Do you like summoning [b]unspeakable[/b] horrors into our plane of existence?\r\n\r\nIf the answer to both of these questions is yes, you may be interested in our newly improved [s]Atronach Forge[/s] [b]SMITHY OF HELLSPAWN (TM)[/b], now with Conjuration XP!  Going down to the Midden has never been more purposeful!\r\n\r\nNow, I know what you\\'re thinking:\r\n\r\nBut <mod author>, I am a Spheriphem interested in space and mastering the arcane arts in space.  Is the Smithy of Hellspawn [b]space-compatible[/b]?\r\n\r\nTo which I reply:\r\n\r\nYou spherical scamp, Smithy of Hellspawn (TM) is not only space-compatible but it\\'s also [b]space-optional[/b]!  Space only knows why we included this feature!  (Greed, mainly.)\r\n\r\nStill on the fence?  Let me sweeten the pot.\r\n\r\nAct now and you\\'ll also receive an enchanted Imbuing Chamber [b]absolutely free[/b] of charge!  This [b]wondrous[/b] device allows you to earn Enchanting XP and control people\\'s minds WITH SPIDERS!\r\n\r\nNo Dragonborn?  NO PROBLEM!\r\n\r\nWe accept all subscribers, even those who do not wish to be [s]cool[/s] [s]hip[/s] the [b]LORD OF ALL SPIDERS[/b].  You will simply not be able to chuck spiders at people\\'s heads.  (Poor you!)\r\n\r\nBut <mod author>, how are the things you say possible?\r\n\r\n[b]BLACK @#$%ING MAGIC[/b]!  ...eh but seriously, we just stick a guy in front of a computer screen and he writes on a piece of papyrus or something.\r\n\r\n[i]Boiler-plate Disclaimer: Smithy of Hellspawn (TM) is not to be confused with inXile\\'s Hunted: The Demon\\'s Forge.  Smithy of Hellspawn is actually an Atronach forge (with Conjuration XP).\r\n\r\nMaking use of our enchanted Imbuing Chamber is much like making use of a non-enchanted Imbuing Chamber, except that it is [b]1000x[/b] better!\r\n\r\nNo Space Cores were harmed in the making of this product.  Solstheim residency not required (but it helps!)  Download where exhibited.[/i]",
