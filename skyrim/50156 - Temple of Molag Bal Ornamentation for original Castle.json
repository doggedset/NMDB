  "summary": "Enhances Castle Volkihar with Molag Bal based ornamentation.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve enhanced the look of Castle Volkihar by adding Molag Bal based ornamentation based on the mace of Molag Bal. The mod aims to reduce the boxy, plain feeling of the original castle by adding spiked ridges and the face of Molag Bal to the battlements, as would be befitting a vampire sanctuary. The mod only affects the exterior of the castle at this point. \r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />==============\r<br />Dawnguard.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Instructions:\r<br />============\r<br />1. Add TempleOfMolagBal.esp and TempleOfMolagBal.bsa to your Skyrim data folder.\r<br />2. Play.\r<br />3. Enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />To remove:\r<br />\r<br />Delete TempleOfMolagBal.esp and TempleOfMolagBal.bsa from your Skyrim data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Caveat:\r<br />=======\r<br />No other changes to the game have been made. This is not a replacer, and should be safe. It might conflict with mods that make changes to the exterior of Castle Volkihar, or Volkihar courtyard.\r<br />\r<br />The mod has tested ok on my underpowered 32 bit XP POS system. I make no guarantees that it wont cause your system to explode into a ball of incandescant fury.",
