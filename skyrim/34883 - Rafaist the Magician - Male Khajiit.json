  "descriptionHtml": "-------------------------\r\n~ Description ~\r\n-------------------------\r\nSimply put, this is a clean save taken directly after character creation. This means that the game won\\'t yell at you for not having a certain DLC installed if you try and load the game, such as Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn, or the High-Res Texture Packs. The only catch is that a single (1) mod is required. While this file is mostly for my benefit, please enjoy him if you like.\r\n\r\nRafaist was designed to appear kindly and middle-aged; a wise mage with talents in alteration and simple conjuration. Mysticism too, though that school was removed in Skyrim. Of course, beneath the simple clothing and soft demeanor, the wiry Khajiit is well versed in swordplay is very much capable.\r\n\r\nFor users of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21587]CCO[/url], I give him the following skills and statistics: One-Handed, Alteration, Conjuration, Illusion, Restoration, Alchemy, and born under the sign of the Apprentice.\r\n\r\nFor users of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286]SkyRe[/url], I change Restoration for Wayfarer (which is still reported as Lockpicking under CCO).\r\n\r\nOf course, you are free to play him how you want. That\\'s just my vision of him. \r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n~ Required ~\r\n-------------------------\r\nThis character was created using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9557]Alternate Start: Live Another Life[/url] installed. You [b][i]will[/i][/b] need that mod installed to correctly load this game. Honestly, I have no idea what would happen if you tried without it, so don\\'t.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n~ Recommended ~\r\n-------------------------\r\nIn order for Rafaist to look exactly as he does in the screenshots, you will need other mods. They are not required to load the game, but I highly recommend them in order to keep Rafaist\\'s appearance. Other texture mods may have quite a different effect on him, so who knows what you may end up with!\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722]The Eyes of Beauty[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488]Better Males[/url] (Genox Faces w/ Cover Khajiits + Any Body; I use Sundracon)",
