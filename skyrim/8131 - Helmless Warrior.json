  "descriptionHtml": "The Helmless Warrior plugin modifies Heavy Armor and Light Armor perks so they affect characters who are not wearing all 4 pieces of armor. The new, modified perks will work on any character wearing at least 3 pieces of armor, as opposed to the original ones that had only worked while wearing a full set.\r\n\r\nIn essence, you can enjoy the benefits of the various armor perks without wearing a helmet. (Or gauntlets, if you prefer that.)\r\n\r\nAn example perk:\r\nCustom Fit (original): 25% Armor bonus if wearing all Light Armor: head, chest, hands, feet.\r\nCustom Fit (patched): 25% Armor bonus if wearing at least 3 pieces of Light Armor (excluding shields).\r\n\r\nA list of all the perks patched in Helmless Warrior:\r\nCushioned, Custom Fit, Deft Movement, Matching Set (Heavy Armor), Matching Set (Light Armor), Reflect Blows, Well Fitted, Wind Walker\r\n\r\nThe Helmless Warrior plugin was created by Adul.",
