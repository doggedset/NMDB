  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is now OUTDATED. Check this new mod for improved textures and new weapons\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/42280/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Description\r<br />===========\r<br />\r<br />I have remade two main swords from Prince of Persia Warrior Within because I&#39;m awesome. Both have HD textures and pretty much identical to their original concept, from their general shape, to the smaller details like blade cracks, chips, etc.\r<br />\r<br />These were originally intended to be swords, but since my current characters use daggers I have made dagger variations and decided to go the extra mile for two handed versions. I&#39;m sure those would&#39;ve been requested anyway so I made them available from the start.\r<br />\r<br />Both swords and their variations can be crafted at any forge and can be improved and enchanted to whatever level suits you. The eagle sword is under the STEEL category and the serpent sword is under ORCISH. These are intended for middle to end game use.\r<br />\r<br />Now go chop some heads off &#33;\r<br />[img]http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1322/serpentglow2.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Install\r<br />======\r<br />\r<br />1.Extract the archive\r<br />2.Copy the contents of the archive in your SkyrimData folder\r<br />3.Open the Skyrim launcher or your mod manager of choice and check the eaglesword.esp \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall\r<br />========\r<br />\r<br />1.Uncheck the esp plugin\r<br />2.Delete all files that came with the mod\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />I usually do not care that much about the mods I release, but I have put a lot of work into these two swords so please do not modify/reupload without my permission. Thank you and enjoy &#33;",
