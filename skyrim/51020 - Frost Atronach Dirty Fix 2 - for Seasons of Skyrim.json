  "summary": "Restores Frost Atronachs if they are removed by other mods",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is the second version of my mod which restores frost atronachs to a game when they&#39;ve been removed from another mod\r<br />\r<br />I made this mod specifically because of Seasons of Skyrim Summer Edition which removes Frost Atronachs\r<br />\r<br />It was recently brought to my attention that I left Climates of Tamriel as a dependency because of the SoSP Summer Edition â€“ Co T Patch.  If you had a CTD from this mod it should be fixed now\r<br />\r<br />Essentially this mod just marks the important frost atronach settings as changes even though no changes were made.  So if you load Seasons of Skyrim Summer first then this mod you will still have frost atronachs in your game\r<br />\r<br />So, for me\r<br />....\r<br />Seasons of Skyrim Project.esp\r<br />SoSP Summer Edition.esp\r<br />SoSP Summer Edition - Co T Patch.esp\r<br />SoSP Summer Edition - Dense Grass.esp\r<br />SummerFrostAtronachDirtyFix.esp\r<br />...\r<br />\r<br />PM me if you have a problem;\r<br />I also left comments open this time",
