  "descriptionHtml": "LOOk AT PICS TO SEE!!!!\r\n\r\nDeath Skeletons 4096x4096 Reslution BY GameNinjaPro is a complete New skeleton Retexture To and amazing quality of 4096x4096 compacted down in to a 2046x2046 size texture that still retains the quality of a 4096 image :D. for this mod the texture of the skeletons are much darker and feel a bit more \\\"Badass \\\"\r\n\r\nThe idea for this mod was to improve the qualtiy and make the skeletons feel more detailed and evil like. i was dissapointed that bethesda used such low rez textures for these undead walking bones. so i deside to take it upon my self and redo theses poor textures and make them more eye appealing andto make them feel darker and \\\"eviler\\\". if thats even a word :D \r\n\r\ninstalling : This is pretty simple guys :). all u do is take the texture file \\\"skeleton\\\" and place it in the Textures/Actors file. if u dont have the actors file in ur texture directory. just create it and place skeleton file inside and ur ready to go\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n:4096x4096 compacted down in to a 2046x2046 size texture that still retains the quality of a 4096 image\r\n:better eyecandy appeal\r\n\r\nUpdates : There will be updates to come and new diffrent colours if u guys request them\r\n\r\nCredits: GameNinjaPro AND DONT FORGET TO INDORSE AND PLEASE LeAVE A COMMENT ON UR IDEAS AND FEEDBACK\r\n\r\nCheers guys :D\r\n\r\nIF u like this Mod Check OUT MY 2048 Azuras star Texture",
