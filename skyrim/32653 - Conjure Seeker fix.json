  "summary": "Fixes problems with Seekers and Conjuration perks",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was really miffed when I found out that the Conjure Seeker spell is not affected by any of the Conjuration perks (Atromancy, Elemental Potency, Twin Souls).\r\nThis mod aims to fix this problem. The Conjure Seeker spell is now enhanced by these three perks, meaning that it is more viable mid- to end-game.\r\n\r\nAtromancy - Conjured Atronachs last for twice as long.\r\nElemental Potency - Conjured Atronachs are 50% more powerful.\r\nTwin Souls - Can have two Atronachs or raised undead.\r\n\r\nThis mod, of course, requires the Dragonborn DLC.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n1) Use NMM. You know you want to.\r\nOR\r\n2) Take the SeekerFix.esp and dump it in your Data folder.\r\n%SteamDir%/steamapps/common/skyrim/Data\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION\r\n1) Use NMM. You know you want to.\r\nOR\r\n2) Remove SeekerFix.esp from your Data folder.\r\n\r\nNo scripts, no corrupted games. Just a plugin. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nThanks to Terra Nova for showing me how the perks and spells interact with each other!\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://oi49.tinypic.com/2ia3p5y.jpg[/img][/center]",
