  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes the weight and gold values of certain types of animal pelt, hide and animal tusk to better reflect their in-game value for a greater sense of realism. Hunting is no longer a pointless and tedious pastime&#33; Now compatible with Skyrim version 1.9\r<br />\r<br />Better Hunting Prices modifies the weight and gold values of these items according to multiple factors including: \r<br />\r<br />- how hard said animal is to kill \r<br />- how rare said animal is in the game world \r<br />- how much application said animal&#39;s pelt/hide/tusk has in-game \r<br />- and finally how big the item retrieved from said animal is, which ultimately determines the weight of the item, as i found current weight values were off mark and did not really integrate well with the whole hunting experience. \r<br />\r<br />The items changed and their new values are as follows: \r<br />\r<br />Bear Cave Pelt - weight: 6 value: 105\r<br />Bear Pelt - weight: 5 value: 110\r<br />Bear Snow Pelt - weight: 6 value: 125\r<br />Cow Hide - weight: 4 value: 40\r<br />Deer Hide - weight: 2 value: 35\r<br />Deer Pelt - weight: 2 value: 30\r<br />Fox Pelt - weight: 1 value: 20\r<br />Fox Pelt Snow - weight: 1 value: 35\r<br />Goat Hide - weight: 1 value: 10\r<br />Horse Hide - weight: 2 value: 40\r<br />Mammoth Tusk - weight: 11 value: 180\r<br />Werewolf Pelt - weight: 4 value: 135\r<br />Wolf Ice Pelt - weight: 2 value: 55\r<br />Wolf Pelt - weight: 2 value: 45\r<br />Dragon Scales - weight: 12 value: 350\r<br />Horker Tusk - weight: 8 value: 80\r<br />Sabre Cat Pelt - weight: 4 value: 150\r<br />Sabre Cat Snow Pelt - weight: 4 value: 170",
