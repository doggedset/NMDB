  "descriptionHtml": "I couldn\\\\\\'t stand the fact that Brelyna had such a lovely voice but was kinda hard to look at, so I made her a new face. I also mildly tweaked her stats/spells to make her slightly more useful in combat. The younger appearance is due to the Dunmer skin from Final Younger Characters by Toshiki, so grab that and also Natural Eyes by nevenbridge to get her looking exactly like the screenshots. :)\r\n\r\n[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/20785-1-1342720043.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nSimply extract the files to your Skyrim folder\r\n\r\nNotes: If you only want the facial appearance changes, uncheck BrelynaMaryon.esp\r\n\r\n\r\nMods used in screenshots:\r\nFinal Younger Characters by Toshiki - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2332\r\nNatural Eyes by nevenbridge - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589 (darker eyes)",
