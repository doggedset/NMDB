Thank you!

An island far away from \r\nknown land, there these three races live in peace, and harmony. But it have´t always\r\nbeen so, the island were attacked by the fierce Wolvari Race, which almost made them \r\nexstinct. Therefore the Leaders of the three tribes swore an oath to Hircline, the \r\ndaedra god of Nature, to help them defend the island that they hold dear, he cursed them\r\nto become animals and prey on animals, and the wolvari. With this new power the the \r\ntribes easily got the upper hand in the war and toss the wolvari back to where they belong.\r\n\r\nNoone has heard of any Wolvari ever since, some believe that they are all exstinct.\r\nBut some say they still lurks the island, waiting, for revenge.\r\n\r\nWith the Wolvari problem gone, one problem still haunted them.. \r\nThe Curse given by Hircline did not vanish, and they were forced to live as beasts, preying on the weak.\r\nI wasn´t before 500 years after the curse were placed that they had learned how to control their lust.\r\nWith their lust mastered and controlled, they could finally build up everything that they had\r\nlost during the war against the Wolvari.\r\nAnd some of these people took off to sea to discover the world, eager for adventure..\r\n\r\n..You were one of them. And now you find yourself shipwrecked in Skyrim. You tried to \r\nescape but got caught by imperial soldiers when you tried to cross the border.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour beginning has already been written.. But the end is for you to decide... \r\n\r\n\r\n[color=lime]=============================================================================[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Tigerha:[/color]\r\n\r\nThe Tigerha is a born warrior. Hailing from the northern part of the Ysveil Isles. Known for their natural ability to fight, this race are capable of transforming\r\ninto a Mighty tiger, with increased health, stamina and speed. The Tigerha is by far the strongest race of Ysveil Isle.\r\n\r\nskills:\r\nonehanded +5\r\narchery +5\r\ntwohanded +5\r\nheavy armor +10\r\nlight armor +10\r\nhealth +20\r\n1.5 x faster than normal form\r\n\r\nSpecial Ability: Beast Stance\r\n\r\nYour fur gets almost as thick as stone, ( 30% resistance to all damage )\r\nand your life force is greatly enhanced ( +200 health )\r\nhowever maintaining this stance requires alot from your body ( 50% reduced Stamina Regeneration )\r\n\r\n[color=lime]=============================================================================[/color]\r\n\r\n[Color=blue]Panthera:[/color]\r\n\r\nThe Panthera are born in the shadows, and hailing from the darkest parts of Ysveil Isles, the dark forests helps them stay hidden in all situations. \r\nBy other Tribes they are often refered to as Assassin´s of the Jungle. They are capable of transforming into a Deadly Panther to strike their prey from the Shadows.\r\n\r\nskills:\r\npickpocket +5\r\nlockpicking +5\r\nlight armor +5\r\narchery +5\r\nSneak +15\r\nHealth +10\r\nstamina +10\r\n1.7 x faster than normal form\r\n\r\nSpecial Ability: Prowl\r\n\r\nYou allow yourself to be consumed by the shadows, concealing your body and removes you from your prey´s eyes ( Invisibility )\r\nHowever, this costs alot of your energy ( 80% reduced Stamina Regeneration )\r\nBecause of your strong paws, you cannot be totally hidden ( Your enemies may not see you, but they can hear you! )\r\n\r\n[color=lime]=============================================================================[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]Leopaderha:[/color]\r\n\r\nThe Leopaderah is fast and agile, hailing from the southern parts of Ysveil Isles, they were the first to be attacked by the Wolvari during the war. And therefore \r\nused every muscle in there body to become more alert and faster to avoid the daily incoming hordes of the Wolvari. \r\n\r\nskills:\r\nonehanded +5\r\nsneak +5\r\nlight armor +10\r\nStamina +20\r\n2.5 x Faster than normal form\r\n\r\nSPECIAL ABILITY: Enhance Reflexes\r\n\r\nYou use every available muscle in your body, and every inch of your mind to think MUCH faster than your enemies ( The World around you is slowed )\r\nHowever maintaing quickly tires out your energy ( 50% reduced Stamina Regeneration )\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=lime]=============================================================================[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]True Form:[/color]\r\n\r\nControls:\r\nLeft Mouse Button: Claw\r\nRight Mouse Button: Bite\r\nBoth Mouse Buttons: Short Jump attack\r\nSpace Button: Long jump Attack\r\nLeft-CTRL: toggle Instincts\r\nLeft-ALT: Toggle Special Ability\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING:\r\n\r\nit is essential for your survival to feed once in a while on your dead victims since your health does not regenerate while in true form\r\n\r\nFeeding on a npc ( human ) will give you 100 hp and a human heart which can be consumed in your normal form for some health.\r\n\r\nFeeding on an animal will give you 50hp and an animal heart which can be consumed in your normal form for health.\r\n\r\nFeeding on Giants will give you 50hp, however the heart of a giant is very strong. So you essentially hunt giants for their hearts which gives a big health boost.\r\n\r\nFeeding on Dragons are the best but hardest to obtain, you will get 150 hp for feeding on one and a dragon heart which gives you a huge amount of health while in normal form.\r\n\r\nFeeding on Undeads will only cause you to feel sick\r\n\r\n[color=lime]=============================================================================[/color]\r\n\r\n[Color=red]FOLLOWERS:[/color]\r\n\r\nThere is a seperate file which contains a text document with all the locations,names,classes etc if you dont want to find them yourself!\r\n\r\nthere is a total of 9 followers, \r\n\r\n3 Tigerah´s\r\n3 Leopaderah´s\r\n3 Panthera´s \r\n\r\nall of these followers have the possibility to transform into Catform. You simply talk with them and tell them to change form ( see screenshots )\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best thing about the transforming system is that it is so easy to make your own follower, ( given that they are one of the new featured races ofcourse )\r\n\r\n1. create a new mod and name it whatever ( make sure to include my mod so that your mod will load it in the creation kit )\r\n2. Create your companion ( there is guides all over the internet if you dont know how!)\r\n3. make sure that they are either: TTTigerRace, LeopaderahRace or PantherRace\r\n\r\nAnd that´s it! you are free to upload your mod, aslong as you do not include any of my textures, scripts etc. And place a link to my mod as a requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=lime]=============================================================================[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]BUGS[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=red] I know the textures for Females, and tiger males are pretty sucky when you are without armor or clothes, I am currently working on this since i am very new with photoshop, and this is the first big retextures that i´ve ever done so please bare with me and endorse to show me support, and if you are good at photoshop please feel free to PM me if you which to help :)\r\n[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=lime]=============================================================================[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Bluarchon[/color] - for all his help surrounding Scripting, and that i also got to borrow his Skeleton.Nif since mine was not working!\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Steve40[/color] - for his increadible help surrounding bugfixing and fixing a script that did not work for me.\r\n\r\n[color=orange]MuppetPuppet[/color] - For his fine Tiger Textures!\r\n\r\n[color=orange]FrankTheFish[/color] - For his awesome Panther textures used in \\\"Prides of skyrim\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much, this mod would´t have been possible without your help!! :)",
