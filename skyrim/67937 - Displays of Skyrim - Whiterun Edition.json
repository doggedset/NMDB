  "descriptionHtml": "Displays of Skyrim - Whiterun Edition\r<br />\r<br />Adds shelves in an unused part of Whiterun that tells the story of Whiterun hold through objects.\r<br />\r<br />Also adds a place to sit to the Gatehouse entrance and little extras around Skyrim.  I tried to be non-invasive of where I put items to not edit navemeshing.  Followers will NOT follow you. \r<br />\r<br />Lore Friendly? - Liv the Lovely traveled throughout Tamriel giving the people lovely works of art.  But she found Whiterun to be fine just the way it was.  So instead of improving on the paintings she set up little stupid things. She placed some bird nests on Dragonsreach for the kiddies (she would have put a dragons nest up there but they were all dead). She put up windy things (cause moving clutter is fun). She even set up a nice place to see the sun, moon, and stars (because when it&#39;s not raining Whiterun has lovely views). Then she moved on. Because she kept on stealing sweetrolls from Jorrvaskr and they really weren&#39;t happy with that. Werewolves are NOT fun when they are mad.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility \r<br />Dawn of Skyrim\r<br />Texture mods\r<br />Breezehome mods (I was tempted to place things on Breezehome but resisted)\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />blary - Booksets Resource\r<br />Runspect - Resources for Modders\r<br />Stroti and Tamira - Stroti Resource Pack 1 and 2\r<br />Bad Gremlins - Bad Gremlins Halloween Resource 2013\r<br />\r<br />(if I miss credit or err in crediting please tell me as this is a first for me)\r<br />\r<br />All can be found on the Nexus as Modder Resources.   \r<br />\r<br />Please keep this mod on Nexus.
