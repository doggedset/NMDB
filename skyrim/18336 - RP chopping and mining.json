  "modName": "RP chopping and mining",
  "summary": "This mod makes mining and chopping wood time consuming activities for better immersion and realism.",
  "descriptionHtml": "In vanilla Skyrim, mining is nearly instant for the player, while NPCs strike the ore veins endlessly. The player can clean a mine in a matter of minutes, which is good for gameplay but not for immersion.\r\nThis mod allows a player to mine and chop wood in a more realistic maner, by needing to spend time working. For a vanilla install it has only advantages and is intented for players using realism mods adding the need to eat, sleep, etc.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Ore veins are infinite.\r\n- In order to mine ore, click on it and push the wait button to advance time (or look at your screen for an hour, it\\'ll work too).\r\n- Your character is rewarded by a variable number of ore, depending on the metal:\r\n- Iron: 4 per hour\r\n- Orichalcum: 2 per hour\r\n- Corundum: 1.8 per hour\r\n- Quicksilver: 1.6 per hour\r\n- Silver: 1.6 per hour\r\n- Moonstone: 1.5 per hour\r\n- Malachite: 1.5 per hour\r\n- Gold: 1.25 per hour\r\n- Ebony: 1.0 per hour\r\n- Soulgem: 1.0 per hour\r\n- When you have enough, just step back or press e to stop mining.\r\n\r\n- Chopping wood is done the same way and yields 10 firewood per hour.\r\n\r\nThe esp file adjusts the buying price from NPCs who have a dialog option to buy ore and wood. They were buying it for more than you could get at your local smith, which is completely silly.\r\n\r\nNew prices:\r\n- Firewood: 1\r\n- Iron: 2\r\n- Quicksilver & silver: 5\r\n- Orichalcum & Corundum: 8\r\n- Malachite & Moonstone: 10\r\n- Gold: 15\r\n- Ebony: 20\r\n\r\nTogether with the amount of each ore, it\\'s balanced so a miner or wood chopper working for 10 hours can earn around 100-200 gold.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n\r\nManual Install\r\n--------------\r\n1. Go to your skyrim Data\\\\Scripts folder.\r\n2. Make a backup of theses files:\r\n- MineOreFurnitureScript.pex\r\n- MineOreScript.pex\r\n- ResourceFurnitureScript.pex\r\n3. Extract this archive to any folder and then copy the contents to Skyrim\\'s Data\r\nfolder.\r\n2.
