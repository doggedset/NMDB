  "summary": "Prevents Vald from attacking you on sight during the quest \\\"The Pursuit\\\".",
  "descriptionHtml": "During \\\"The Pursuit\\\", did you go through all the effort of clearing Vald\\'s debt, only to have the jerk attack you when you tried to talk to him? Like me, are you sick of having to cast the Calm spell on Vald just so you can talk to him? This mod is for people who like to go the non-violent way to get into Riftweald Manor, and don\\'t like going through a complicated process of simply talking to Vald. And when you have a follower, ugh.\r\n\r\nThis isn\\'t my first mod, but this is the first one I\\'ve uploaded to the Nexus.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know there shouldn\\'t be any conflicts since it simply edits one NPC, but as far as any mods that edit Vald go, I have no idea. If you have any problems with anything, please let me know and I\\'ll try to fix them as best I can.\r\n\r\nEndorse me if you like it!",
