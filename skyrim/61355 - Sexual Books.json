  "modName": "Sexual Books",
  "summary": "This mod adds a few books to Skyrim with adult content in them.",
  "descriptionHtml": "=== What is this mod? ===\r<br />\r<br />This is very simple mod: it just adds 15 new books to the world of Skyrim. These books are centered around nudity and sex, so be warned.\r<br />\r<br />=== Where are the books in game? ===\r<br />\r<br />Every book has its own location in Skryim. For some books the location adds to the story, others can just be found in inns and shops. You could try to find them yourself or you can cheat and look at the list below(&#39;Locations of the Books&#39;). Currently, vendors do not carry the books(well, they aren&#39;t supposed to anyway).\r<br />\r<br />=== How to install? ===\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s very simple: Drop the .esp in your Data folder or use a mod manager(like Nexus Mod Manager or Mod Organizer).\r<br />\r<br />=== Requirements ===\r<br />\r<br />This mod requires all the three DLC&#39;s(Dawnguard, Heartfire and Dragonborn). No other mods are needed.\r<br />\r<br />=== I have an awesome  idea for a story&#33; ===\r<br />\r<br />Ideas are welcome of course, just leave them in the comments.\r<br />\r<br />=== Are they lore friendly? ===\r<br />\r<br />Yes, I think so. If you found a book that breaks lore, please tell me and I will change it.\r<br />\r<br />=== Locations of the Books ===\r<br />\r<br />An Unexpected Assignment:      Warmaiden&#39;s(Whiterun)\r<br />A High Prince:            Belethor&#39;s(Whiterun)\r<br />Alain the Conqueror V1:      Drunken Huntsman(Whiterun)\r<br />Alain the Conqueror V2:      Drunken Huntsman(Whiterun)\r<br />Alain the Conqueror V3:      Honeyside(Riften)\r<br />Alain the Conqueror V4:      Dead Man&#39;s Drink(Falkreath)\r<br />Dibella&#39;s Cult:            Shrine of Dibella south of Dawnstar\r<br />Poleria&#39;s Studies:            Barracks(Dawnstar)\r<br />Not Enough:              Castle Volkihar\r<br />Sexual Art:               Silverblood Inn(Markarth)\r<br />The Haunted Manor:               The Scorched Hammer(Riften)\r<br />The Excitement of Fear:          Fort Dawnguard\r<br />Sex & Culture:               Darkwater Crossing Mine\r<br />Differnt Body Types Of Tamriel:   Darkwater Crossing Mine\r<br />\r<br />=== The Secret Book ===\r<br />\r<br />As you might have noticed, there are 14 books listed above. One book, called &#39;The Odd Statue&#39;, is in a secret location. +5 points to Ravenclaw for the first one who finds it.",
