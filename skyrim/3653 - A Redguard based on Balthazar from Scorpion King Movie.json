  "descriptionHtml": "Hi. You start at Helgen Keep, level 1, with Ralof, after killing those two first imperials to recover the key (it\\'s the earlier save I have). You can level up to level 2 right away. I guest you could make changes with  \\\"showracemenu\\\" code if you want. I just wanted to share my character, later in game he looks great with the hide armor :). Feel Free to make him better. I hope somebody could add the scars and the earring, and in the future turn him in a cm companion or something like that. Well, I hope you like him. ",
