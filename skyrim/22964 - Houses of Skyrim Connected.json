  "modName": "Houses of Skyrim Connected",
  "summary": "This is a simple but effective mod for people who own more than one of the vanilla Skyrim homes. The mod adds basements to each house with doors leading to the other homes. The point is that you can use all of your homes together as if they were one huge building.",
  "descriptionHtml": "If you\\'re thane in some cities in Skyrim, you\\'ll probably own several houses, but you\\'re likely to only use one with the others going completely un-used. This mod aims to resolve this by adding a trap door leading to a basement in every house. Within these basements are doors leading to the other houses.\r\n\r\nThe houses from the 5 main cities are all included:\r\n• Breezehome in Whiterun\r\n• Honeyside in Riften\r\n• Vlindrel Hall in Markarth\r\n• Hjerim in Windhelm\r\n• Proudspire Manor in Solitude\r\n\r\nTo prevent cheating, each door requires a key to open. For maximum convinience I recommend using a house map marker mod too, like [URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8348]Smakit\\'s mod[/URL].\r\n\r\nCOMPATABILITY\r\nThis should work with most mods but it may conflict with mods that place ovjects near the trap doors. Followers will not follow you into the basements (they\\'re pretty small anyway) but they should join you when you enter a house.\r\n\r\nAlternate download on the [URL=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=91422533]Steam Workshop[/URL].",
