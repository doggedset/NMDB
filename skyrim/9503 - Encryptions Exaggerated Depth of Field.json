  "summary": "Small mod that increases the strength of the games Depth of Field to be alot more noticable.",
  "descriptionHtml": "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUpdate 1.1 \r\nAdded an extra .esp file that pushes the DoF curtain further back to more vanilla distances but still has a stronger blur.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis mod adjusts the games DoF settings so that it is alot more noticable everywhere. Since this just modifies the games own Depth of Field settings then there is no impact to FPS if you have been running with DoF enabled.\r\n\r\nThis isn\\'t just a quick change to make the DoF the same in all areas and weather but scales the original values the game had to bring the DoF curtain much closer to the player and make it stronger so there is still a variety in scenes where when its cloudy or foggy the curtain is much closer than it is when its sunny and clear.\r\n\r\nThis mod will definantly be a matter of taste for people but having exaggerated visuals in games has allways been my personal preference and I am sure that I am not alone so I decided to give this out so maybe it can make someone that much happier with skyrim :)\r\n\r\nAlso I should point out that with a much stronger DoF curtain that is closer to the player than normal.. you should be able to get in the ini\\'s and make some LoD adjustments since you really dont need ultra quality behind a curtain of blur and also the furthest DoF setting is 25000 so maybe make adjustments for 30k or so.",
