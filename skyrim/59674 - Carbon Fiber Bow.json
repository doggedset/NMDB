  "descriptionHtml": "[u][b][color=#f4f4f4]The Carbon Fiber Bow:[/color]\r<br />[/b]\r<br />[/u]This is a new bow in the world of Skyrim. Made of hollowed Ebony and Quicksilver, this bow is super fast and light-weight. It packs a punch almost as powerful as the heavier Ebony Bow. There are also matching arrows for this bow, fashioned from the original Steel arrow design, the main components have been replaced with the lighter materials increasing overall velocity, thus the piercing ability of these arrows is much greater.\r<br />\r<br />[i][color=#00ff00]- Where can I find it?[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/i]This bow is sold by Fayt, a short elven merchant just inside the gates to Whiterun. It is quite expensive. The bow can also be crafted at any forge given you have the Ebony smithing perk. Arrows may also be crafted and also require the ebony perk, and the bow can be both improved and enchanted.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][i]- Are there any incompatible mods?[/i][/color]\r<br />\r<br />As this bow is standalone and not a direct replacer for the Nightingale bow, there are no direct incompatibilities. However, if you&#39;re using Open Cities, Fayt will not appear, so your only option will be to forge the bow and arrows.\r<br />\r<br />[i][color=#00ff00]- What&#39;s new?[/color]\r<br />[/i]\r<br />[list][*]1.2 - Updated Normal Maps to give metal parts on bow, quiver and arrows a more reflective surface.[/*]\r<br />[*]1.0 - Initial Release\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=#00ff00][i]- How do I install this mod?[/i][/color]\r<br />\r<br />I recommend using Nexus Mod Manager, it is by far the easiest way (just a couple mouse clicks). If you insist on doing it manually, download the file and extract the contents using 7-zip. Copy the Data folder into your Skyrim installation directory.\r<br />\r<br />[i][color=#00ff00]- I don&#39;t like it, how do I get rid of it?[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/i]If you used Nexus Mod Manager as recommended, uninstalling this is as easy as deactivating the mod and deleting it from your list. If you chose the manual install method, go into your Skyrim&#92;Data folder and delete the Carbon Fiber Bow.esp. Then go into Meshes&#92;Weapons and delete the Carbon Fiber folder. Do the same for the textures by going to Textures&#92;Weapons and deleting the Carbon Fiber folder there. All gone&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[i][color=#00ff00]- Can I use this mod for my own projects, or upload to another site?[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/i]I will not authorize uploading this mod to another site under any circumstances. Please ask me for permission before making any modifications and re-uploading here on the Nexus&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[i][color=#00ff00]- Who all is responsible for this mod?[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[/i]That would be myself and jaredschons. Jaredschons did the original Nightingale Bow retexture which I tweaked slightly. I also did the textures for the arrows and quiver. Other credits go to Bethesda, Adobe, DarkOne and the developers of Nexus Mod Manager&#33;\r<br />\r<br />That&#39;s it, enjoy&#33;",
