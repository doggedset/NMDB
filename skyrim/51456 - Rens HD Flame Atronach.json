I didn't like the vanilla washed-out and ash colors, didn't think it was realistic enough. This texture embodies fire and magma itself without looking silly. Also spent a lot of time on her face, and as a result got high-detailed cuteness ^__^\n<br />\n<br />[b]Succubus:[/b] Thought variety is good, so I did this one for fun. It has a less ragged look, so it appears as if she were wearing body armor. The strokes are smoother and stylized so it doesn't seem like random fire. She has a more red hue rather than black as I thought to make this one 'sexier', hence the smaller armor in some instances.\n<br />\n<br />Each texture is 2048x1024, double than original. There's also 2 new flame colors to choose from. \n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Note: There's animated gif images to show all skin textures[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=6]Installation[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />If using through nexus, the Fomod launcher will appear prompting you with choices between skin textures and flame colors. They will be directly installed into your data folder.\n<br />\n<br />If not using nexus, you'll have to do it manually. I've made it tidy enough so it's easy to know which is which:\n<br />01FlameAtronach is [b]Winged Flame[/b]\n<br />02FlameAtronach is [b]Succubus[/b]\n<br />03Fire is [b]Bright Flame[/b]\n<br />04 is [b]Magma Flame[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][b]Change Log[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Version 2.1[/b]\n<br />Bug fix: The 'Magma Fire' was the wrong resolution for unknown reasons and was making visual glitches.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Version 2.0[/b]\n<br />Main File was released\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Please Endorse if you like this mod!![/b][/size]\n<br />[img]http://zonelessdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/button_title_001.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49747/?][img]http://zonelessdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/button_wispmotherchibi.png[/img][/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50327/?][img]http://zonelessdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/button_shrineschibi.png[/img][/url]",
