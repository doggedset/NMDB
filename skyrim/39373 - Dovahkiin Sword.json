  "summary": "Sword which looks like the one from game trailer, but with powerful enchantment against the dragons, shock damage to any other creature, little faster than other swords and optional ability which makes most of enemies in the game flee from combat on critical strike.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is part of my Dovahkiin armor mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/39184/ (but you don\\'t need it) It adds a new stanalone and lore friendly sword for the later game players which want to look like dovahkiin from the game trailer, but still kick some legendary dragons ass :D\r\n\r\nWhat is special about it? \r\nIt has the strongest possible dragonbane enchantment [40 additional damage to dragons and 10 shock damage to the others], but looks like the steel sword, which dovahkiin from the trailer was carrying.\r\nIt also has optional (choose version in the files section) special ability, when you critical strike someone, it will have the same effect as the Histeria illusion spell - every enemy in range will flee from battle.\r\nAnd it has just a little bit more damage than daedric sword, so it is not overpowered [to people and monsters , dragons would shit their big dragon pants, if they had any]\r\n\r\nHow to get it?\r\nCraft it in the Skyforge, under \\\"Dragon\\\" section, so you need the dragon armor perk.\r\nYou need original steel sword, 2 ebony ingots, 1 dragon bone and 1 dragon scale, and if chosen a version with special ability a Histeria Scroll (you can buy one from the jarls mage)\r\n\r\nThe texture in the screenshots is not included. Use aMidianBorn\\'s Book of Silence texture replacer, found here! \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24909/\r\n\r\nAlso, the dragon I\\'m killing in the screenshot is a Nether Dragon from Deadly Dragons, found here\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3829",
