  "descriptionHtml": "Purpose\r\n\r\nStops guards from bothering you when you use Dragon Shouts inside of settlements. In vanilla Skyrim, guards will force you into a dialogue and request that you not use your Shouts. Initially, it\\'s funny but after a few times it gets annoying. You\\'d think people would be happy that they have a Dragonborn around. Well, now they are, or least they can\\'t complain.\r\n\r\nHow To Install/Uninstall\r\n\r\n1. Drop the file, named no_guard_warning_after_shouts.esp, into the Data folder.\r\n2. Make sure the file is selected by checking it\\'s box in the Skyrim game launcher.\r\n3. Just delete the file if you wish to uninstall.\r\n\r\nWhat I Did\r\n\r\nIt\\'s a simple tweak but I will explain what I did in case anyone can improve on HOW I did it:\r\n\r\n1. Open skyrim.esm with the Creation Kit.\r\n2. Locate Quests > WICastMagic03 (Editor ID)\r\n3. Right-click and select delete and click Yes through all the warnings.\r\n4. Save as .esp file.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n\r\nIf you want to test the effects without waiting for Shout cooldowns try using a mod called Thu\\'um Infinium. It can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8162\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=7784\r\n",
