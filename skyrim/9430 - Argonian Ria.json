  "descriptionHtml": "Argonian Ria version 1.0\r\nA MOD for TES V: Skyrim by LieutenantHawk\r\n\r\nShahvee is a really nice person and a good friend of mine, but she\\'s the only female Argonian in the game available for marriage and, honestly, I\\'m not interested in her like that. I wanted a more fitting wife for my dear Markos, so I altered one of my favorite people in the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n--{Features}--\r\n\r\nRia, one of the new members of the Companions, is now an Argonian. Thankfully Skyrim\\'s voices aren\\'t dependant on race like Oblivion\\'s, so she retains the same dialogue despite her completely altered appearance (She doesn\\'t sound like a lifelong smoker like the other female Argonians. Why do they have such raspy voices while the males are so wonderfully smooth and calm-sounding?) I also changed her outfit a bit, but you can easily change it yourself by giving her something with a higher armor rating in-game.\r\n\r\n\r\n--{Installation}--\r\n\r\nJust place \\\"LtH_Argonian_Ria.esp\\\" in your \\\"Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\" folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n--{Bugs/Conflicts}--\r\n\r\n This will conflict with anything else that changes Ria\\'s appearance, but that\\'s about it. \r\n\r\n\r\n--{Copyright}--\r\n\r\nYou\\'re free to alter this MOD however you like for personal use, but do not redistribute it.\r\n\r\n\r\n--{Credits}--\r\n\r\nBethesda Softworks for the awesomeness that is Skyrim, and me for fiddling with the Creation Kit.\r\n\r\nTo contact me: The most obvious would be via Skyrim Nexus, but I am also on deviantART and Yahoo under the same name.",
