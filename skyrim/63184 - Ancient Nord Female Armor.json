  "descriptionHtml": "This is a retexture of female draugr armor which is heavy. I have placed some ridiculously strong warrior skill enchantments on it as I play with requiem and I am always getting spanked. So anyway, this is my first ever upload here, I hope everything is good. This is female only, and it works on the man and elf races, I am not so sure about beast races, it should work. The armor is in a chest on the little island bit in Riverwood near the tree stump.",
