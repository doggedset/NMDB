  "descriptionHtml": "[left][font=Tahoma][size=5][b]Description:\r<br />[/b][/size][size=3]This mod is a basement extension for Windstad Manor. I always felt that since it was near a swamp, Windstad Manor would be the perfect home for a vampire/werewolf player. As a result, I decided to make an add-on to the basement area that takes these players into account. There are a total of three extra rooms in addition to a cave hallway. Included in one of the rooms is also an underground cave pool with steam to ward off the cold wind of the surface.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=5][b]This mod includes:[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]*Two jail cells\r<br />[/size][/color][/font][font=Tahoma][color=#ffff00][size=3]*Two coffins\r<br />*Two cages\r<br />*A blue, suave underground pool with auto-undress function for companions\r<br />*A nice cavern hallway\r<br />*A table with chairs for vampires or any other companions (looks great with Serana&#33;)\r<br />*A cozy (or sinister) fire pit[/size][/color][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4]First Version:[/size] [size=3]The basement expansion only&#33;[/size]\r<br />[size=4]Optional Version[/size]: [size=3]The basement expansion along with a connecting tunnel to The Tranquil Sanctum.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][size=5][b]Author&#39;s Note:\r<br />[/b][/size][size=3]This is my first house mod. I searched in vain for an expansion to Windstad Manor. I just wanted to find a small expanded basement for darker characters, but eventually I realized that the only way to get the kind of home extension that I wanted was to make it myself. I&#39;ve spent several hours on this mod learning the ropes, and there is a chance I might tweak it a bit more in order to achieve perfection. I&#39;ve got a tough skin, so I can take any constructive criticism you&#39;d like to share. Compliments are always welcome, as well as encouraging:) I originally planned to place npcs in the cells as cattle for vampire characters, but then I decided it might be better to let the players populate their jails themselves, as there are plenty of mods out there that will allow players to customize this location however they want. Maybe I&#39;ll even add an optional version if enough people want npcs. [b]Enjoy&#33;[/b][/size][/left]",
