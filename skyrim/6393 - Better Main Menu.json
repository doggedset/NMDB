  "summary": "Replaces the background texture and the main score. The background is a 1080p image and the score has been edited to preserve the vanilla one but gets to the good stuff sooner.",
  "descriptionHtml": "When I played Oblivion I used to always get a little mesmerized by the opening. The music and the presentation made me always sit for an extra few seconds just to sit and enjoy it.\r\n\r\nWhile Skyrim is easily one of my all time favorite games and better than Oblivion in so many ways, the truth is that the game made a pretty bland first impression. Just a black background, a logo, and what seemed to me like no music. Later I realized that the menu had music, you just had to wait a long time for it to really kick in. \r\n\r\nI decided I wanted to make a mod to improve the Main Menu experience. It\\'s no where near what Oblivion was but I think it\\'s an improvement.\r\n\r\nAdds two things\r\n\r\n* A new background designed for 1080p res\r\n* A revised main score. It starts later in the song and reduced the time it takes for the crescendo to kick in.\r\n\r\nNote: I mainly made this mod for me but thought others might like it. The audio quality could be better and will do so if others enjoy the mod.\r\n\r\nComments and suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\n*************************************\r\nUpdates\r\n*************************************\r\nv 0.1 - rebuilt the audio from the games source. Still not sure if it\\'s load enough so if you agree then please post a comment.\r\n\r\nThanks",
