I am able to play these characters because of my favorite feature from UFO, the ability to give Spell Tomes to followers, then have them learn those spells.  This feature has allowed me to be the Hunter I want to be, while still reaping the benefits of the Spell Tome game mechanic.\r\n\r\nWhile playing Hunter characters, the two issues I ever have are, gold and finding the Tomes I want to buy for my followers to learn.  It\\'s either I don\\'t have the gold (I\\'m a hunter, we don\\'t make a lot of gold), or I actually have the gold but the vendor doesn\\'t have the Tome I want.  This is where The Scribes Lectern comes in.  You see, The Scribes Lectern allows the player to craft most vanilla Tomes, and use them exactly the same as they are in game.  Which is perfect for the types of characters I play, as well as any other player that uses spell casting followers, or someone that plays a spell slinger themselves.\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]How it works[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nAfter gathering the required ingredients, simply use The Scribes Lectern (a new crafting furniture piece) to scribe your item.  Once crafted, the item will be added to your inventory to be used as you see fit.\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]Required For Crafting[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nTo use The Scribes Lectern, the player must have an Inkwell and a Quill.\r\nTo craft an item, the player must have all ingredients required by the recipe.\r\nNote - A new miscitem called Blank Book has been added to the game, this book can only be crafted (you can not buy or find it) and is required to craft \r\nall Tomes.\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]The Scribes Lectern Locations[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nCastle Dour - Entry Chamber\r\nCollege of Winterhold - Arcanaeum\r\nDragonsreach - Farengar\\'s Lab\r\nTemple of The Divines - Entrance Hall\r\nWindhelm Palace - Wuunferth\\'s lab\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]Whats added (67 Tomes, 1 new miscitem)[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nAll Alteration Tomes that have a corresponding vanilla scroll.\r\nAll Conjuration Tomes that have a corresponding vanilla scroll\r\nAll Destruction Tomes that have a corresponding vanilla scroll\r\nAll Illusion Tomes that have a corresponding vanilla scroll\r\nAll Restoration Tomes that have a corresponding vanilla scroll\r\n1 new miscitem called Blank Book.\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]Whats to do[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nAt this point I am waiting to see if there are any bugs that need stomped out, if and when one is found, I will crush it and upload a new version.\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]Future Plans[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nDepending on how this mod is received, I may look into adding Tomes that do not have corresponding vanilla scrolls.\r\nPossibly add skill tomes, though I feel this would make the mod a cheat mod if added.\r\nConsider suggestions posted in the comments.\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]Compatibility[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe only Compatibility issues I can think of, would be any mod that adds furniture to the same locations The Scribes Lecterns are located.\r\nWith that said, very little Compatibility testing has been done, if you find a conflict, please post in the comments.\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]Changelog[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nv 1.2 - Moved the Lectern in Dragonsreach to just left of, and inside the lab doorway.\r\nv 1.1 - Removed inkwell and Quill from 1 Lectern.  Added scripts folder in case there were issues.\r\nv 1 - Initial Release\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]Legal[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe new crafting furniture piece (The Scribes Lectern) and the new miscitem (Blank Book) were extracted from a vanilla BSA, the models and textures are property of their respective owners.\r\nThe Scribes Lectern mod was created by Diamok and may not be redistributed without his consent.\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]Install[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nThe easiest install is to use the Nexus Mod Manager.  If however you prefer to install mods manually, simply download the archive and extract it to your data \r\nfolder.\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]Uninstall[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nAgain, simplest way is Nexus Mod Manager.  But, if you want to manually remove it, delete the \\\"The Scribes Lectern.esp\\\" from your data folder.\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]Credits[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nKorodic - For scripting.
