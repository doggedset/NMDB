  "descriptionHtml": "[b]VERSION 0.3 UPDATE NOTICE!!![/b]\r\n----------------------------------\r\nThe new version of this mod new requires Dawnguard. In addition, to facilitate further updates and to give additional flexibility, players now have the ability to craft memoirs of variable strength. The upside is that you can mix and match now. The downside is that I was forced to change the reference ids of each ability.\r\n\r\nSince ability effects remain on a character if the ability is removed, you need to [b]manually remove the old abilities before you upgrade![/b]\r\n\r\nUpgrade Instrucions\r\n1. Start Skyrim and remove all of your learned abilities. In order to make your life easier, I\\'ve listed all of the refrence IDs for the spells below. I\\'ve also included a batch file. Remember that you have to change the \\\"xx\\\" to the mod load order. If you\\'re not sure what the first two numbers should be, type in \\'help \\\"Oblivion Bound\\\" 4\\' in the console and take note of the first two numbers in the spell.\r\n2. Once all abilities are removed, make a new save.\r\n3. Uninstall the old mod.\r\n4. Install the new mod.\r\n5. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nplayer.removespell xx00694A ; Archmage\r\nplayer.removespell xx00694D ; Bard\r\nplayer.removespell xx006960 ; Blade\r\nplayer.removespell xx006961 ; Brawler\r\nplayer.removespell xx006EC5 ; Guildmaster\r\nplayer.removespell xx006ECA ; Harbringer\r\nplayer.removespell xx006ECD ; Listener\r\nplayer.removespell xx006ECE ; Oblivion Bound\r\nplayer.removespell xx006ED0 ; Pentius Oculatus\r\nplayer.removespell xx006ED2 ; Ritualist\r\nplayer.removespell xx006ED4 ; Way of the Voice\r\nplayer.removespell xx006ED6 ; Word Walker\r\n\r\n[b]Reasoning[/b]\r\n----------------------------------\r\nAfter finishing off all of the various faction and organization quests, I was highly disappointed that my achievements held little to no mechanical impact. This mod aims to provide characters with lore friendly and (hopefully) balanced abilities that reflect their status in the world.\r\n\r\n[b]The Abilities[/b]\r\n----------------------------------\r\nThis mod adds 16 new milestone abilities to the game.

Each memoir requires 2 rolls of paper, 1 leather, and the completion of one or more linked quests. Version 0.3 adds multiple versions of the abilities in varying strengths. Simply craft the version you feel most appropriate and ignore the others.\r\n\r\nTo prevent everyone from gaining all four abilities, I\\'ve placed conditions on each recipe. Once you learn one version of the ability you\\'ll no longer be able to craft the tome again. Yes, I realize that you could craft all four versions of the memoir before reading them, but there\\'s really no way to prevent that. By the same token you could also simply use the console to grant yourself all four abilities.\r\n\r\n[b]Why Memoirs?[/b]\r\n----------------------------------\r\nJust to clear something up, I decided to add the abilities via crafted memoirs for two reasons.\r\n1. Because the abilities aren\\'t added at the time you complete the quest, this mod does deny experience characters their rightful reward.\r\n2. Because I didn\\'t monkey with any quest scripts, mod compatibility will be much higher. It shouldn\\'t conflict with any other mods (to my knowledge) as all of the spells and abilities have unique names.\r\n\r\n[b]Why Multiple Memoirs?[/b]\r\n----------------------------------\r\nI\\'ve changed the way the mod works in order to provide an additional layer of customization. I have no way of really knowing what you think a proper reward for a quest happens to be. Now you can mix and max the size of bonuses instead of being restricted by the strengths I thought were correct.\r\n\r\n[b]Installation[/b]\r\n----------------------------------\r\n[b]IMPORTANT:[/b] Choose only [b]ONE[/b] version of the mod!\r\n1. Unzip the mod into your Skyrim/Data directory.\r\n2. Activate Milestone Memoirs.esp with your choice of mod manager.\r\n3. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nInstall automatically using the Nexus Mod Manager\r\n\r\n[b]Version History[/b]\r\n----------------------------------\r\n9/17/2012 - Release 0.5\r\nAdditional bug fixes. Brawler should now require 5 brawl wins and work correctly. I\\'ve also reverted back to the spell tome versions for now. My script needs some work and there\\'s no sense in keeping a blank book in anyone\\'s inventory. Hopefully I\\'ll get the readable versions right in the next version.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve also ditched the quills in this version, as they were a pointless step in the process. In the future I want to create a power that will grant a hidden perk to determine the strength of the memoir you craft. I need help on that, though, so it\\'s for a future version.\r\n\r\n9/17/2012 - Release 0.4\r\nQuick bugfix. I\\'m an idiot and forgot to include a recipe for the quills! Sorry!\r\n\r\n9/17/2012 - Release 0.3\r\nDawnguard support added!\r\nFour new abilities addded: Dawnguard, Hero of Skyrim, Thane of Skyrim, and Vampire Master.\r\nMemoirs will new remain in your inventory after you use them and can be read. This in in preparation for the readable books in the next release.\r\nVersions have been merged into one mod. You can now choose the strength of each ability on an ability by ability basis.\r\n\r\n9/09/2012 - Release 0.2 - Corrected a few small display bugs in the main file. Modified brawler requirements, as tracking multiple brawl wins isn\\'t currently possible. Added three additional versions of the mod with lesser and greater effects.\r\n9/08/2012 - Initial Release 0.1\r\n\r\n[b]Credits[/b]\r\n----------------------------------\r\nBig thanks to CLAVDISVCAESAR for the suggestion on making the spells readable and his future help in creating the memoir entries.\r\nBig thanks to Shawn Edwards for his excellent tutorial on making spell tomes readable.
