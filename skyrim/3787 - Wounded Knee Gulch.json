  "descriptionHtml": "**********\r\nI, SLuckyD, am no longer developing or supporting this mod.\r\nALSO: this mod is NOT to be used with a game.. it is only for novelty purposes.  I am making it available again, so people can see how I did what I did.. long before the CK was released.\r\nDO NOT SAVE YOUR GAME WITH THIS MOD LOADED!!!!\r\n**********\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBI VIDI VICI VENI!!\r\nI, SLuckyD, by Rights of Wisdom & Skill, as proven in not-so-mortal combat with the savage GECK, and having blazed trails into NEW LANDS for our fledgling Empire... do hereby claim the meaningless title of Caesar pro-tempore of preCKModdery!  I shall be a benevolent Imperator... starting immediately... by giving you the FIRST DUNGEON EVER MODDED IN SKYRIM!  That\\'s right - having conquered those foreign, frozen lands in the North, I bring to you its inhabitants... to do BATTLE for your amusement!!  Let the GAMES BEGIN!!\r\n\r\n\tThis is NOT an Arena/gladiator mod or addon, as some may be led to believe by the above dramatization.. YOU\\'LL BE DOING THE BATTLING.  There is NO QUEST, NO NPCs to talk to, no scripting of any kind.  Just enemies, in a plain dungeon, with a chest of loot and a warm bed at the end.\r\n\r\n[FEATURES]\r\n- an ENTRANCE in Vanilla Sky worldSpace (between Broken Oar Grotto and Brinewater Grotto)\r\n- living ARROW FODDER and/or SWORD QUENCHERS in the form of LEVELED DRAUGRs\r\n- a worthy(?) PRIZE at the end... which should respawn along with all its protectants!\r\n- UNIQUE worldSpace DUNGEON; bona fide, made using VanSky\\'s \\'BlackReach Cave\\' kitset\r\n- NO in-game preview DRAMA for any of my other mods this time!  (I promise)\r\n- a 99% guarantee that you\\'ll come out looking like a porcupine, if you come out at all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[OTHER SLuckyD RELEASES]\r\n(availability may be limited until I can update them to 100% compatible, Skyrim Creation Kit versions)\r\n\r\n- Portable On-demand Disposable Unlimited Mannequins (SPODUM)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10578\r\n\r\n- Vanilla Mannequin Script Fix\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10652\r\n\r\n- Moving Target Practice\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28336\r\n\r\n- Overlook Tower Player Home\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4514\r\n(this was the first Skyrim mod to offer a non-Vanilla Player-home)\r\n\r\n- Gokstad Sailable Viking Ship & Portable Player Home\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5432\r\n(this was the first Skyrim mod to implement real-time sailing/flying with multiple objects)\r\n\r\n- Faster Woodland Creatures\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4799\r\n\r\n- Wounded Knee Gulch\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3787\r\n(this was the first Skyrim mod to offer a new dungeon)\r\n\r\n- Ring of Fortify Carry Weight plus 10000\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8520\r\n\r\n- Bullseye\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2945\r\n(this was the first Skyrim mod to offer a new worldSpace, as well as several other \\'preCK firsts\\')\r\n\r\n\r\n[OTHER PROJECTS I\\'VE ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTED TO]\r\n\r\n- Flyable Dragon Race Revamped\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17178\r\n(I did the ground-detection, which auto-switches the dragon to walking mode) ",
