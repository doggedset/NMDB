  "descriptionHtml": " Retexture of all the new monsters and animals that needed it from Dawnguard Dlc:\r\nSome of them were not changed drastically. Only applied some filters to them to look decent. Some had more drastic color change. Look, judge (please don\\'t judge me! :P ) and decide if you like this better than vanilla dawnguard. \r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\n1. Chaurus hunters\r\n More darker and wasp like texture.\r\n\r\n2. Frost Giant\r\n As the name suggest they should be frosty. Plus new eye texture.\r\n\r\n3. Frozen falmer\r\nFrosty and bloody.\r\n\r\n4. Female Falmer \r\n Whiter skin to match up with retexture done by spiffyjim. And I reccomend his Snow Falmer retexture. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4432\r\n\r\n5. Falmer Warmonger armor\r\n Darker and to match up with Chaurus hunter skin\r\n\r\n6. Death Hounds\r\n More defined skin color.\r\n\r\n7. Vale Animals\r\n More defined skin color. \r\n\r\n8.  Revered dragon\r\n Better colors and changed eye to less ridiculous one with a snake look.\r\n\r\n9. Legendary Dragon\r\n Better colors and changed eyes with a dragonfly eye texture. \r\n\r\n10. Durnehviir. \r\n A bit better. But not much of a diffrence. His texture is so convoluted that I spent half an hour to find where is the eye. And the other half to find out where is the slime texture he is using. \r\n\r\n11. Armored trolls.\r\n Defined skin, armor and more rust to it. \r\n\r\n12. Gargoyles\r\n More defined. \r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\nSimply remove folders:\r\nTextures/actors/dlc01\r\nTextures/dlc01/actors\r\n\r\nIf you do not like some of the textures :\r\nGo to the up mentioned folders and delete the specified folder\r\n ",
