  "summary": "Gives an option for non-thieves to find an improved bonemold formula for Glover Mallory.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple mod that allows you to obtain the Improved Bonemold formula if you are not doing the thieves guild quests. For those of you who did not know, if you are a TG member, talking to Glover Mallory will give one more dialogue option, as the player recognises the shadowmark on his house. That starts the [url=http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Dragonborn:Paid_in_Full]Paid in Full[/url] quest.\r<br />\r<br />With this mod, you can simply ask him if he needs help with anything, and will give you a slightly changed dialogue explaining what has happened (he won&#39;t tell you he is a thief). The dialogue is partially unvoiced.\r<br />\r<br />The reward is also slightly different. Apart from the main reward - ability to create improved bonemold - player will receive 100 gold and a set of enchanted levelled Bonemold armor. This should recompense the loot in Glover&#39;s basement you miss by not being a thief. You also don&#39;t receive the key to his house or basement. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Other mods you might want to check:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41466]Bonemold expanded[/url], by [b]Link815[/b],\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34498/?]Enchanted Bonemold in Lists[/url], by [b]JKalenad[/b]",
