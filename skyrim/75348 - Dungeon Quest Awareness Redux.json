  "summary": "An update to the popular 2012 mod by darkwolfn1 to include more locations and additions for Dawnguard and Dragonborn locations",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=#1e84cc][size=4]What does this mod do?\r<br />[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />Basically it adds a little bit of information to Skyrim&#39;s locations on your map in the same way that the mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9720/?]Dungeon Quest Awareness[/url] by darkwolfn1 did, except that it adds more descriptions, more locations, and includes Dawnguard. Dragonborn isn&#39;t included because it&#39;s a separate worldspace. I updated his mod because after four years it seems unlikely he&#39;s going to do it himself.\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re the kind of person who likes this sort of mod you want to use this mod as a companion: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60445/?]SkyComplete[/url]. This mod allows you to track what quests you have and haven&#39;t done. So when you see a quest pop up on your map from Dungeon Quest Awareness Redux you can look it up in SkyComplete in your MCM menu.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]But, why?[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />In a way this is a cheat. It gives you info on each location to tell what kind of quest might be available, what enemies are present, and is basically a &#34;spoiler.&#34; People who like immersive discovery probably won&#39;t download this. Personally, I like a little extra info on new locations to I know what to expect. It&#39;s especially important if you have difficult mods and want to avoid certain places and enemies.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to see the descriptions on your map right away, use the ~ button to open the console and type &#34;tmm 1,0,0&#34;. It will reveal all map markers (undiscovered) and you can hover over them.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]Can you do x, y, z?[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Maybe, let me know in the comments.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#1e84cc][size=4]Compatibility\r<br />[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />Should be fine with anything. Can be uninstalled whenever. Impossible to cause crashes.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]Requirements\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color]Dawnguard\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]Installation[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Nexus Mod Manager\r<br />[/b]\r<br />1.

      "changelogHtml": " I wasn&#39;t sure whether to change the file version number or not but since I added a bunch of things I felt like I should. Basically I added a fomod installer to make life easier and also edited the files quite a bit:\r<br />\r<br />* Changed map marker style of darkwolfn1 from &#34;Quest Whiterun&#34; to &#34;Quest: Name of specific quest&#34;. This will take up more space on the map but I felt that if people are going to read &#34;Quest Whiterun&#34; they&#39;re not going to know what it refers to. Naming the specific quest allows people to use the mod SkyComplete or use the Skyrim Wiki to find out how they start or complete the quest. I felt more info was useful.\r<br />\r<br />* I also permanently removed the enemy spoilers on map marker locations. I felt people didn&#39;t like that idea and it made more sense that way. I kept info on dragon priests and word walls since I personally dig it that way.\r<br />\r<br />* Lastly, I added support for Atlas Map Markers, as my mod was overwriting several changes to that file. You&#39;ll want to load mine after Atlas for compatibility.\r<br />\r<br />* I noticed that Requiem overwrites a few changes in Dungeon Quest Awareness Redux but nothing major or that would require a patch. <br/> \n",
