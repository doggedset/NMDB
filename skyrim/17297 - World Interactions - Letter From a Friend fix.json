  "summary": "Adds conditions so that friends only send letters if a shouts is used in a nice, quiet part of Tamriel.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever have a naked courier run up to you with a letter for your hands only? Apparently, you\\'ve recently been showing off your thu\\'um and the locals are getting a little nervous. Who cares if \\\"the locals\\\" are recently deceased giants, dragons, bandits, etc?\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a condition to the WICastMagic04 quest so that the only natives getting restless are the ones that live cities, towns, on farms, or around mills. \r\n\r\nThis has not been extensively tested, so if this doesn\\'t work or breaks something, please let me know.",
