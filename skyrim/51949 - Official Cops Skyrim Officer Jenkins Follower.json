  "descriptionHtml": "&#34;Finally, Officer Jenkins of COPS: Skyrim can join you on your quest. This is the OFFICIAL follower mod featuring all new dialogue from Jenkins himself. &#34; - AdjacentGAMES\r<br />\r<br />Hello Fellow Mod lovers&#33;  I&#39;m back with a special follower mod that I&#39;m excited to bring you.  AdjecentGAMES and I have teamed up to bring you Cops: Skyrim&#39;s OFFICIAL Officer Jenkins follower mod&#33;  Pretty awesome right?  Of course is it.  If you don&#39;t think this rocks then I pray Jenkins finds you in the night and brings the justice to your nether parts.  Officer Jenkins will follow you around Skyrim bringing justice to the masses.  It&#39;s like Judge Dredd but with a Dragonborn instead of an annoying Rob Schneider.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/607/9f01.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Location:\r<br />\r<br />Officer Jenkins is on duty in Mistveil Keep (Riften Castle) near the Jarl or walking around.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/607/9f01.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Links:\r<br />\r<br />AdjacentGAMES: \r<br />[url]http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2FadjacentGAMES&h=KAQGB5OtA[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Nerdist: \r<br />[url]http://www.youtube.com/user/Nerdist[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Cops: Skyrim PSAs\r<br />[url]http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA19E6B43D6E3F4C7[/url]\r<br />\r<br />NEXUS version:\r<br />[url]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51949/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/607/9f01.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Bugs:\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE LEAVE COMMENTS REGARDING BUGS.  This is my first follower mod and soon I will have more.  It&#39;s always good to know issues so I can correct them for you.\r<br />\r<br />Jenkin&#39;s Helmet bug:  First, it&#39;s not a bug.  His helmet should always stay where it is regardless of you giving him new armor.  His helmet is the best so enjoy it.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/607/9f01.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />As always, leave comments and suggestions below.
