Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#1E90FF]== WHAT ==[/color][/size]\r<br />As I said, I just made some quick textures for these two meads, based on [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62848/?]quilb&#39;s[/url] beautiful work, and figured I&#39;d share. There are new normal and environment maps for them as well, a PDN file with a layered blank bottle you need to open with [url=http://www.getpaint.net/index.html]Paint.net[/url], and a blank bottle texture in case you want to make your own.\r<br />\r<br />The sample esp has these two drinks as new, standalone consumables, so Dragonborn is not required to load it up. You can find some in a respawning crate outside Lucan&#39;s home in Riverwood.\r<br />\r<br />Yeah, I know these are kinda bad. I don&#39;t really care. I am also not going to make patches or leveled lists for these drinks. [b]THIS IS A MODDER&#39;S RESOURCE. YOU NEED TO ADD IT TO MODS YOURSELF.[/b] Do whatever you want with it, just give credit and link to this page if you decide to use these for something. Thank you~\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#1E90FF]== WHY ==[/color][/size]\r<br />I was bored. Since I like to collect food to merge into my personal big food extravaganza mod, this was a fun waste of an hour or two.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#1E90FF]== HOW ==[/color][/size]\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your [font=Courier New]&#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34;[/font] folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
