  "descriptionHtml": "[center][line]\r<br />[SIZE=7][FONT=Impact][COLOR=#ffffff]HEY YOU&#33;[/COLOR][/FONT][/SIZE]\r<br />Be sure to check out the videos here in the description if your interested in how the place looks inside and out. I think the videos do more justice than the pics I have up. Hope you enjoy ;)\r<br />[line]\r<br />[SIZE=7][FONT=Impact][COLOR=#ffffff]Introduction[/COLOR][/FONT][/SIZE]\r<br />[line]\r<br />The idea of this house mod came from me being not satisfied with any other house mod, I mean none&#33; ok ok well some... Quiet ALOT actually have been pretty good but I quickly grow out of them and move on trying to find another except that berticus guy who made &#34;Breezehome Remodeled&#34; that was a really good house and if you havent tryed it then I suggest you go do so. Anyways I have always stumbled through crabbers shanty from time to time and thought the place was just so beautiful and if only there was a house so I could live there and soo this mod was born. Thanks to other community members for the resources I was able to make a very unique home for myself, its a simple small place with beautiful surroundings I guess you could call it a starter home, nothing to crazy just a cosy and very homely feeling was my aim.\r<br />[line]\r<br />[COLOR=#ffffff][FONT=Impact][SIZE=7]Features[/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\r<br />[line]\r<br />The Cabin features a small cosy 1 room custom interior that is a no reset zone with safe containers so you wont lose your items if you store them, there is a custom storage chest for your belongings and a food container on the kitchen side to store food, also has a fireplace with cooking pot. along with other unique features to give you a very cosy home to call your own. The exterior includes beautiful surroundings and views and there is also an outhouse (toilet).\r<br />[line]\r<br />[FONT=Impact][SIZE=7][COLOR=#ffffff]Update 1.1[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\r<br />Added numerous pines to surrounding area to make it feel not so bunched up in 1 area. If your updating the main file is REQUIRED and then remove &#34;Valley View Cabin.esp&#34; and replace with the one in the update.\r<br />[line]\r<br />[FONT=Impact][SIZE=7][COLOR=#ffffff]Videos[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]\r<br />[line]\r<br />[youtube]O5UmGK6qdrk[/youtube]\r<br />[youtube]PtkeZr_3CB4[/youtube]\r<br />[line]\r<br />[COLOR=#ffffff][FONT=Impact][SIZE=7]Community Comments[/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\r<br />[line]\r<br />&#34;the mod is great loving the location&#34; - Dimitrisgrr\r<br />\r<br />&#34;you&#39;ve done a fantastic job of fitting it into the scenery&#33;&#34; - perrob\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Really awesome house  Thank you for that mod&#34; - sario9\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Wow this is actually a really awesome looking home, fits in great with the surrounding area and its not too much for a beginning home&#33; Love it&#33;&#34; - bellestarr\r<br />\r<br />&#34;beautiful  I can know that everything is located and positioned neatly even from the photos. ^ ^&#34; -MarianHawk\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Just the kind of player home I&#39;ve been looking for - and it looks great&#33;&#34; - kn1ghtfall\r<br />[line]\r<br />[COLOR=#ffffff][FONT=Impact][SIZE=7]Installation[/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\r<br />[line]\r<br />I suggest using NMM for easy installion and so if you wanted to remove the mod it can be easily removed otherwise if you wanted to install manually then copy the included .esp and the meshes and texture files into you skyrim data folder wherever it may be located on your computer and overwrite anything if asked.\r<br />[line]\r<br />[COLOR=#ffffff][FONT=Impact][SIZE=7]Uninstallation[/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\r<br />[line]\r<br />Simply deactivate the mod in NMM or delete the .esp, if uninstalling manually with the meshes and textures you will have to go through and find the files to delete otherwise there is no harm done to you game if they were just left there.\r<br />[line]\r<br />[COLOR=#ffffff][FONT=Impact][SIZE=7]Feedback[/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\r<br />[line]\r<br />To anybody who downloads if you get the chance I would love some feedback on how it is and if it needs any improvements or fixes.\r<br />[line]\r<br />[COLOR=#ffffff][FONT=Impact][SIZE=7]My Other Mods[/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\r<br />[line]\r<br />Unique Follower - Natalie\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52835/?]Nexus Download Link[/url]\r<br />[img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/thumbnails/52835-1-1397064504.jpg[/img]\r<br />[line][/center]",
