  "descriptionHtml": "Well I&#39;m done with it. Mostly. I&#39;ll be doing patches for NPC&#39;s and other minor fixes. You can use Axminster Manor or the top right house on the scaffoldings as a player house. Whenever I release patches I&#39;ll link them in this. If anyone decides to make bug fixes then feel free to do so without contacting me just link here. I originally made this mod just for my own amusement, it&#39;s not the last town-mod I&#39;m going to do and it will be updated eventually, but that would be anywhere within a year, so who knows how much will change within that time. I have a lot on my plate right now so not much time for fun. \r<br />\r<br />[font=Courier New]Plenty of bugs and such that I don&#39;t intend to fix (such as bottoms of the houses), updates will be slow since I don&#39;t know how to add quests or scripts.[/font]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Lore[/b]:\r<br />The Town of Axminster was built in 4E 082 by a Bandit Clan fleeing Cyrodiil; who wanted to start modest simple lives in their own community. The town&#39;s status was acknowledged by the Jarl at the time, and the town began exporting cloathing, armor, weapons, and simple items such as pitch forks and nails. Currently the town is a refuge for criminals of all sorts, a place where fueds are left alone, and Werewolves and Vampires can rest easy. Though no longer exporting goods, they recieve funds from the Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood, as well as most travelers who find their way to Axminster. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Notable Objects[/b]:\r<br />Elderglade (The Tree in the Center)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Location&#39;s[/b]:\r<br />Axminster Manor (Used as a hideaway for criminals. Has a secret passage to Firefly Inn underground.)\r<br />Warren (NPC Owned)\r<br />Prison\r<br />Firefly Inn (NPC Owned, Player owns one room)\r<br />Temple of Talos\r<br />4 Houses (All Uninhabited for now) (Use My Home is Your Home if you want to put NPC&#39;s in them).\r<br />\r<br />[b]NPC&#39;s[/b]:\r<br />Hefrolf Rock-Spear\r<br />Ansteir Rock-Spear\r<br />Valgunn Rock-Spear (Child NPC)\r<br />Hukida Starkad\r<br />Marfwiil Green-Shield (Inn Keeper/Owner)\r<br />Rolzag\r<br />Merelith Alaldessen (Prisoner)\r<br />Ogmmir Whitethorn (Prisoner - Voice not fixed, he still has a woman&#39;s voice because I forgot to fix it x.x)\r<br />\r<br />[i]It&#39;s just west of Skyrim, where Bleakwind Basin would normally be. \r<br />[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[u]Recommended Mods[/u]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045/?]My Home is Your Home[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52871/?]Guild Starter[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?]Amazing Follower Tweaks[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51471/?]Maok Race[/url]",
