  "summary": "Adds a container with unenchanted versions of all Dragonborn-specific clothing",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a RESPAWNING chest in the Abandoned Building in Raven Rock with 20 of each Dragonborn clothing item with the enchantments removed. Some of the items have been renamed for the sake of convenience and specificity. Also, some non-enchanted items were included because they are somewhat rare, and I changed all the weights to 1 for consistency with vanilla clothing.\r\n\r\nCheck the IMAGES for the location, names and formIDs.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in adding these items to leveled lists or merchant inventories, please feel free.",
