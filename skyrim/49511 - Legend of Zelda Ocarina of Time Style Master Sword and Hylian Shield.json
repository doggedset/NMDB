  "descriptionHtml": "This is basically the exact same as my other master sword mod, but with a few minor changes. The meshes now resemble the design from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. When you go to the Sacred Grove, you will not see The master sword, you will instead see a large door leading to the Temple of Time in the past (Like in Twilight Princess) credits to Matt13382 for the Temple of Time Cell, and thanks to Christian of CCRE for his Master Sword and Hylian Shield models. The grove is by Knifepoint ridge, just fast travel there and turn around, or, type in &#34;COW Tamriel -16 -15&#34; Minus the quotes. Thanks to PayneXIII for the awesome pedestal of time retexture. Also, The Zelda Return of A Hero mod is run solely by me, I am working on things, but I can only make models and the likes, I&#39;m not good at the CK past importing weapons, if anyone wants to help, I&#39;d hate to see a mod with so much potential die. Also, the picture with Corvo in it is completely irrelevant, Corvo and Link are my two favorite characters so I thought &#34;Why not?&#34; Don&#39;t ask where I got the Corvo armor from either, It&#39;s a secret to everybody :D.",
