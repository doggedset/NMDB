  "descriptionHtml": "I thought it would be cool to start the game as a vampire. I put a bit of effort into making her look regal and attractive, not just some cave-crawling nosferatu. Be prepared for a challenge, as being a vampire this early on may have more drawbacks than benefits. You start with nothing but the clothes on your back, a few Septims and some basic potions. Such is the price of being a hunter of mortals...\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: You may get an error about missing content. Don\\'t sweat it, pobably just some texture mods I was using.",
